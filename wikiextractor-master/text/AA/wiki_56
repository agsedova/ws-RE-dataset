The Brazilian spelling of his first name is Antônio; António José da Silva in Hebrew is אנטוניו ז'וזה דה סילווה.\n\nHis parents, João Mendes da Silva and Lourença Coutinho, were descended from Jews who had emigrated to the colony of Brazil to escape the Inquisition, but in 1702 that tribunal began to persecute the Marranos or anyone of Jewish descent in Rio, and in October 1712 Lourença Coutinho became a victim. Her husband and children accompanied her to Portugal when António was 7 years old, where she figured among the \"reconciled\" in the \"auto-da-fé\" of July 9, 1713, after undergoing the torment only.\n\nHer husband, having then acquired a fixed domicile in Lisbon, settled down to advocacy with success, and he was able to send António to the University of Coimbra, where he matriculated in the faculty of law. In 1726 António was suddenly imprisoned along with his mother on August 8; on the 16th he suffered the first interrogation, and on September 23 he was put to the torment, with the result that three weeks later he could not sign his name. He confessed to having followed the practices of the Mosaic law, and this saved his life.\nHe then went through the great \"auto-da-fé\" held on October 23 in the presence of King John V and his court, abjured his errors, and was set at liberty. His mother was only released from prison in October 1729, after she had undergone torture and figured as a penitent in another \"auto-da-fé\".\n\nMeanwhile, António had gone back to Coimbra, and finishing his course in 1728–1729 he returned to Lisbon and became associated with his father as an advocate. He found what he believed to be an ignorant and corrupt society ruled by an immoral yet fanatical monarch, who wasted millions on unprofitable buildings though the country was almost without roads and the people had become the most backward in Europe. As his plays show, the spectacle struck António's observation, but he had to criticize with caution.\n\nHe produced his first play or opera in 1733, and the next year he married his cousin, D. Leonor Maria de Carvalho, whose parents had been burnt by the Inquisition, while she herself had gone through an \"auto-da-fé\" in Spain and been exiled on account of her religion. They had their first daughter in 1734, but the years of their happiness and of Silva's dramatic career were few, for on October 5, 1737 husband and wife were both imprisoned on the charge of \"judaizing.\" A slave of theirs had denounced them to the Holy Office. Though the details of the accusation against them seemed trivial and contradictory, and some of his friends testified about his Catholic piety and observation, António was condemned to death. On October 18, like those who wanted to die in the Catholic faith, he was first strangled and after had his body burnt in an \"auto-da-fé\". His wife, who witnessed his death, did not long survive him.\n\nSlight as these sketches are, they show considerable dramatic talent and an Aristophanic wit. The characters are well drawn and the dialogue full of comic strength, the scenes knit together and the plot skillfully worked out. Moreover, Silva possessed a knowledge of stagecraft, and, if he had lived, he might have emancipated the drama in Portugal from its dependence on foreign writers; but the triple licence of the Palace, the Ordinary and the Inquisition, which a play required, crippled spontaneity and freedom. Even so, he showed some boldness in exposing types of the prevailing charlatanism and follies, though his liberty of speech is far less than that of Gil Vicente. His comedies give a truthful and interesting picture of 18th century society, especially his best comedy, the \"Alecrim e Mangerona\", in which he treats of the \"fidalgo pobre\", a type fixed by Vicente and Francisco Manuel de Melo.\n\nHis works bear the title \"operas\" because, though written mainly in prose, they contain songs which Silva introduced in imitation of the true operas which then held the fancy of the public. He was also a lyric poet of real merit, combining correctness of form with a pretty inspiration and real feeling. His plays were published in the first two volumes of a collection entitled \"Theatro comico portuguez\", which went through at least five editions in the 18th century, while the \"Alecrim e Mangerona\" appeared separately in some seven editions. This comedy and the \"Don Quixote\" have been reprinted in a critical edition with a life of Silva by Mendes dos Remedios (Coimbra, 1905).\n\nFerdinand Denis, in his \"Chefs-d'œuvre du théâtre portugais\" (pp. 365–496, Paris, 1823), prints liberal extracts, with a French translation, from the \"Vida de Dom Quixote\", and F. Wolf likewise gives selections from Silva's various compositions. Silva is the subject also of several laudatory poems and dramas, one or two of which were composed by Brazilian compatriots.\n\nHis story was dramatized in the 1996 film \"The Jew\".\n\nHis dramatic works, which were produced at the Bairro Alto theatre between 1733 and 1738, include the following comedies, all played by marionettes:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1858454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858454", "title": "Ferroalloy", "text": "Ferroalloy\n\nFerroalloy refers to various alloys of iron with a high proportion of one or more other elements such as manganese (Mn), aluminium (Al), or silicon (Si). They are used in the production of steels and alloys. The alloys impart distinctive qualities to steel and cast iron or serve important functions during production and are, therefore, closely associated with the iron and steel industry, the leading consumer of ferroalloys. The leading producers of ferroalloys in 2014 were China, South Africa, India, Russia and Kazakhstan, which accounted for 84% of the world production. World production of ferroalloys was estimated as 52.8 million tonnes in 2015.\n\nThe main ferroalloys are:\n\nFerroalloys are produced generally by two methods : in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace. Blast furnace production continuously decreased during the 20th century, whereas the electric arc production is still increasing. Today, ferromanganese can be still efficiently produced in a blast furnace, but, even in this case, electric arc furnace are spreading. More commonly, ferroalloys are produced by carbothermic reactions, involving reduction of oxides with carbon (as coke) in the presence of iron. Some ferroalloys are produced by the addition of elements into molten iron.\n\nIt is also possible to produce somme ferroalloys by processes. For example, the is used in Japan to produce ferronickel.\n\nThe leading world chromite ore-producing countries in 2014 were South Africa (12 Mt), Kazakhstan (3.7 Mt), India (3.5 Mt), and Turkey (2.6 Mt). Most of the chromite ore production was smelted in electric-arc furnaces to produce ferrochromium for the metallurgical industry. The leading world ferrochromium-producing countries in 2014 were China (4.5 Mt), South Africa (3.6 Mt), Kazakhstan (1.2 Mt) and India (0.9 Mt). Most of the 11.7 Mt of ferrochromium produced worldwide was consumed in the manufacture of stainless steel which totalled 41.7 Mt in 2014.\n\nTwo manganese ferroalloys, ferromanganese and silicomanganese, are key ingredients for steelmaking. China is the leading world producer of manganese ferroalloys (2.7 Mt), with output about much greater than that of the next three major producers—Brazil (0.34 Mt), South Africa (0.61 Mt) and Ukraine (0.38 Mt)—combined.\n\nMajor producers of ferromolybdenum are Chile (16,918 t), China (40,000 t) and the United States which accounted for about 78% of world production of molybdenite ore in 2008, whereas Canada, Mexico and Peru accounted for the remainder. Molybdenite concentrates are roasted to form molybdic oxide, which can be converted into ferromolybdenum, molybdenum chemicals, or molybdenum metal. Although the United States was the second leading molybdenum-producing country in the world in 2008, it imported more than 70% of its ferromolybdenum requirements in 2008, mostly for the steel industry (83% of ferromolybdenum consumed).\n\nIn 2008, the major ferronickel-producing countries were Japan (301,000 t), New Caledonia (144,000 t) and Colombia (105,000 t). Together, these three countries accounted for about 51% of world production if China is excluded. Ukraine, Indonesia, Greece,\nand Macedonia, in descending order of gross weight output, all produced between 68,000 t and 90,000 t of ferronickel, accounting for an additional 31%, excluding China. China was excluded from statistics because its industry produced large tonnages of nickel pig iron in addition to a spectrum of conventional ferronickel grades, for an estimated combined output of 590,000 t gross weight. The nickel content of individual Chinese products varied from about 1.6% to as much as 80%, depending upon customer end use.\n\nIn the United States, the steel industry accounted for virtually all the ferronickel consumed in 2008, with more than 98% used in stainless and heat-resistant steels; no ferronickel was produced in the US in 2008.\n\nThe nickel pig iron is a low grade ferronickel made in China, which is very popular since the 2010s.\n\nSilicon ferroalloy consumption is driven by cast iron and steel production, where silicon alloys are used as deoxidizers. Some silicon metal was also used as an alloying agent with iron.\nOn the basis of silicon content, net production of ferrosilicon and miscellaneous silicon alloys in the US was 148,000 t in 2008. China is the major supplier, which in 2008 produced more ferrosilicon (4.9 Mt) than the rest of the world combined. Other major manufacturers are Norway (0.21 Mt), Russia (0.85 Mt) and US (0.23 Mt).\n\nTitanium is used in steelmaking for deoxidation, grain-size control, and carbon and nitrogen control and stabilization. During steelmaking, titanium is usually introduced as ferrotitanium because of its relatively low melting temperature and high density. Steels with relatively high titanium content include interstitial-free, stainless and high-strength low-alloy steels. Ferrotitanium is usually produced by induction melting of titanium scrap with iron or steel; however, it also is produced directly from titanium mineral concentrates. The standard grades of ferrotitanium are 30% and 70% titanium. Ferrosilicon-titanium also is produced to allow the simultaneous addition of silicon and titanium. The leading ferrotitanium producing countries include Brazil, China, India, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nTungsten is an important alloying element in high-speed and other tool steels, and is used to a lesser extent in some stainless and structural steels. Tungsten is often added to steel melts as ferrotungsten, which can contain up to 80% tungsten. World ferrotungsten production is dominated by China, which in 2008 exported 4,835 t (gross weight) of the alloy. Ferrotungsten is relatively expensive, with the prices around $31–44 per kilogram of contained tungsten.\n\nIn 2008, China, Russia (12,000 t) and South Africa (17,000 t) accounted for 98% of world vanadium mine production. In these three countries, vanadium was primarily recovered from titanium-bearing magnetite ore processed to produce pig iron. The process entails aluminothermic reduction of vanadium(V) oxide, aluminium (as oxide getter), and scrap iron. This produces a slag containing 20% to 24% vanadium pentoxide, which can be further processed to ferrovanadium containing 40% to 50% vanadium. Of the 5,090 t of vanadium consumed in the United States in 2008, 84% came from ferrovanadium and nearly all of it (99%) went into steel manufacturing.\n"}

{"id": "1858465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858465", "title": "The Book of Giants", "text": "The Book of Giants\n\nThe Book of Giants is an apocryphal Jewish book which expands the \"Urzeit\" to \"Endzeit\" ('primeval creation' to 'end of time') narrative of the Hebrew Bible and, by its multifaceted elaborations on divine decrees of warning and doom, ties the ancient prophet Enoch (\"ḥanôk\") closer to his generally recognized 'storyline' (as collectively put forth in various Enochic traditions) than does even the story's principal treatise of 1 Enoch. Together with 1 Enoch's \"Book of Watchers\", as Enochian scholar James C. VanderKam maintains, \"it stands as an attempt to explain how it was that wickedness had become so widespread and muscular before the flood; in so doing, it also supplies the reason why God was more than justified in sending that flood.\" The \"Giants\" discovery at Qumran dates the text's creation to before the 2nd century BC.\n\nThe \"Book of Giants\" is an antediluvian (pre-Flood) narrative that was received primarily in Manichaean literature and known at Turfan. However, the earliest known traditions for the book originate in Aramaic copies of a \"Book of Giants\" among the Dead Sea Scrolls. References to the \"Giants\" mythology are found in: Genesis 6:1-4, the books of Enoch (Ethiopic, Slavonic, Hebrew, Greek), Jubilees, Genesis Apocryphon, 2 and 3 Baruch (Slavonic), the Damascus Document, and visions in Daniel 7:9-14. This book tells of the background and fate of these ante-deluvial giants and their fathers, the Watchers (called \"grigori\" in the Slavonic 2 Enoch), the 'sons of God' or 'holy ones' (Daniel 4:13, 17) who rebelled against heaven when — in forbidden violation of the strict \"\" — they commingled, in their lust, with the 'daughters of men.'\n\nTheir even more corrupt offspring, the giants, were variously called thereafter \"nephilim\", \"gibborim\", or \"rephaim,\" being the earthly half-breed races that fought against God and his righteous followers whose numbers diminished as the world was overwhelmed with corruption and evil; the Manichaean fragments give these wicked ones the general name \"demons\" (Greek Enoch calls them \"bastards\"). Though the terms for the Watchers and their offspring are often confused in their various translations and iterations, collectively these rebellious races are referred to as the \"fallen angels\" in the apocryphal sources, as also in the biblical narratives that reference them.\n\nSince before the latter half of the twentieth century, the 'Book of Giants' had long been known as a 'Middle Iranian' work (which some scholars now believe was written originally in 'Eastern Aramaic') that circulated among the Manichaeans as a composition attributed to Mani (\"c\". AD 216 – 274) — a Parthian citizen of southern Mesopotamia who appears to have been a follower of Elkesai, a Jewish-Christian prophet and visionary who lived in the early years of the second century. Some scholars, concordant with supporting evidence for the ancient sect's geographical distribution, have posited both genetic and ritual-custom similarities between the Elcesaites and the earlier Second Temple Jewish sect of the Essenes (\"Essaioi\" 'Saints').\n\nDuring the twentieth century a number of finds shed considerable light on the literary evidence for the Book of Giants. The 1943 publication by W. B. Henning of the Manichaean fragments from the Book of Giants discovered at Turfan in Western China (in what is now Xinjiang Province) have substantiated the many references to its circulation among, and use by, the Manichaeans. Further identification of the Manichaean Book of Giants was revealed in 1971 when Jósef T. Milik discovered several additional Aramaic fragments of Enochic works among the Dead Sea Scrolls; he astonished the scholarly world upon announcing that the fragments bore close resemblance to Mani's \"Book of Giants\", then added to the astonishment his belief, too, that \"Giants\" was originally an integral part of 1 Enoch \"itself\". These fragmentary scrolls in Aramaic, which represented an Enochic tradition that was likely introduced to Mani in his sojourn with the Ecesaites, appeared to have been the primary source utilized by Mani in the compilation of his book, in which he made the legend of the Watchers and the giants \"a cornerstone of his theological speculations.\" And for many scholars, the Qumran fragments confirmed the Book of Giants to originally have been an independent composition from the Second Temple period.\n\nAmong the fragments discovered at Qumran, ten manuscripts of the \"Book of Giants\" are identified by Stuckenbruck. These fragments (1Q23 , 1Q24 , 2Q26 , 4Q203 , 4Q530 , 4Q531 , 4Q532 , 4Q556 , 4Q206 , and 6Q8 ) were found in caves 1, 2, 4, and 6 at the site. These discoveries led to further classification of the Enochic works. In the third group of classification, ten Aramaic manuscripts contain parts of the \"Book of Giants\" which were only known through the Manichaean sources until the recognition of them at Qumran.\n\nThere has been much speculation regarding the original language of the Book of Giants. It was generally believed to have had a Semitic origin. Indeed, the discovery of this text at Qumran led scholars, such as C. P. van Andel and Rudolf Otto, to believe that while these ancient Aramaic compositions of the book were the earliest known, the work probably had even earlier Hebrew antecedents. It was of course the great R. H. Charles, translator and publisher in 1906 of \"The Book of Enoch\", who asserted that Enoch was \"built upon the debris of\" an older Noah saga than that in Genesis which only cryptically refers to the Enoch myth. But Milik himself offered his own hypothesis that Enoch's 'creation story' and law of God account \"naturally predate\" the Mosaic Sinai accounts in Genesis: He saw Genesis 6:1-4 — long a puzzling passage to biblical scholars — as a \"quotation from\" what he believed ultimately to have been the \"earlier\" Enoch source. More recent scholarship, such as that of Klaus Beyer, indicates that the \"Book of Giants\" (parts of which have been found in Hebrew at Qumran) was \"\"originally composed in\" Hebrew during the 3rd century BCE, while the names of the giants Gilgamesh and Hobabish betray a Babylonian provenance\" — which Babylonian-origins claim based on the name appearances, however, is refuted by Martínez (Stuckenbruck [1997], pp. 5 note 22, 30, 208 note 273, 220 note 27; Martínez [2018/1992], p. 114). But whatever the reality, one thing remains certain: the Qumran books and their fragments are now the oldest known Enochic manuscripts in existence.\n\nThe text unearthed at Qumran in 1948 was composed of fragments in Aramaic. Because of the book's fragmentation, it was difficult for the documents' linguistic researchers and specialists to know, in its subsequently varied permutations, the exact order of the content. The 'Giants' work is closely related to the 1 Enoch analogue, which also tells a story of the giants, but one which is far more elaborate. The Qumran \"Book of Giants\" also bears resemblance to the Manichaean \"Book of Giants\" that came after it. Scholars, beyond their many questions of the Enochic tradition's oral or written transmission, still don't know why the Qumran community considered the Enochic texts so important that they possessed and retained so many copies in comparison to other textual traditions found there.\n\n\"The Book of Giants\" is an expansive narrative of the biblical story of the birth of 'giants' in Genesis 6.1-4. In this story, the giants came into being when the Watcher 'sons of God' (who, per the story's corroborative Jubilees account [Jub 4:15; 5:6], God originally dispatched to earth for the purpose of instructing and nurturing humanity \"in proper ritual and ethical conduct,\" \"to do what is just and upright upon the earth\") were seduced by and had sexual intercourse with mortal women, who then birthed a hybrid race of giants. These Watchers (\"grigori\") and giants (\"nephilim\") engaged in destructive and grossly immoral actions which devastated humanity, including the revealing of heaven's holy \"secrets\" or \"mysteries to their wives and children\" and to mankind generally.\n\nWhen Enoch heard of this, he was distressed and petitioned God, who in his longsuffering and by divine revelation and counsel called Enoch to preach repentance unto them, that the earthly races might avoid God's wrath and destruction. In his mercy, God chose also to give the fallen Watchers an additional chance to repent by transmitting dreams to several of their giant-sons, including two brothers named Ohyah and Hahyah who relayed the dreams to an assembly of their \"grigori\" and \"nephilim\" companions. This assembly of Watcher-giant associates were perplexed by the dreams, so they sent a giant named Mahway to Enoch’s abode and to the places of his preaching (for Mahway had been instructed that he must first \"hear\" the prophet speak before petitioning him for the \"oracle\"). Enoch, in his attempt to intercede on their behalf, provided not only the oracle that the Watchers and giants had requested, but also twin \"tablets\" that revealed the full meaning of their dreams and God’s future judgment against them.\n\nWhen the Watchers and giants had at last heard heaven's response, many chose, in their transcendent pride and arrogance, rather than to turn from their evil ways, to act in defiance against God. The Qumran fragments are incomplete at this point.\n\nThe Manichaean version is similar to the one found in Qumran, only adapted to Mani's story of the cosmos. The fallen angels are here archontic demons escaped from their prisons in the sky, where they were placed when the world was constructed. They would have caused a brief revolt, and in the process, two hundred of them escaped to the Earth. While most given names are simply translated into Iranian language, Ohyah and Hahyah are renamed \"Sam\" and \"Nariman\". This version also contains a complete ending, telling how the forces of the Light, led by four angels identified with Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Istrael, subdue the demons and their offspring in battle.\n\nMuch of the content in the \"Book of Giants\" is similar, and most closely relates, to 1 Enoch 7:3-6, a passage which sheds light on the characterizing features of the giants. It reveals that the giants were born of the Watcher 'sons of God' and the 'daughters of men.' The giants, as their 'prostituted' half-breed offspring, began to devour the works of what they perceived to be a lesser race and went on to kill and to viciously exploit them in slavery and sexual debauchery. They also sinned against nature, in the most defiling and violent of ways against the beasts and birds of the sky, creeping things and the fish of the sea, but also against one another. They murdered on a massive scale, and also aborted their own children. The Qumran documents also mention that the giants devoured the flesh of those they exploited and of one another, and drank the blood [7]. This act of drinking blood would have horrified the people [8]. This offence is also mentioned in Leviticus 17:10-16, wherein strict rules are laid forth regarding the blood of animals and all living creatures; verses 10 and 11 warn, “I will set my face against any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who eats blood and I will cut them off from the people. For the life of the creature is in the blood.”\n\nThe Qumran texts that make up its so-called \"Book of Giants\" seem to offer, for various faiths, a more complete picture of the beginnings of evil than perhaps its rather truncated counterpart — the biblical Eden story — is able to give. The Genesis story we read today, as is well known, was greatly altered by ancient Deuteronomist scribes and historians (and others) according to their own religious and political agendas and does not, therefore, represent the pristine form of whatever may have been its primordial message. And while the Book of Giants cannot, by any means, heal that breach, it does begin to answer questions, fill in gaps, and make more clear, perhaps, what was originally intended.\n\nThe Qumran fragments that began to be discovered in 1948 relate how a small cadre of giants – offspring of the 'fallen angels' called Watchers – including Ohyah and Hahyah (alternately, 'Ohya' and 'Hahya'), who were both sons of Shemihazah, chieftain of the Watchers, and also Mahway, giant-son of the Watcher Baraq'el, experience dreams that foresee the biblical Flood [9]. These disturbing omens are told to the assembly of fallen angels that had originally organized their secret society upon Mount Hermon as a body of 200 members, bound together by a dark combination of clandestine oaths and operational pacts by which they might ruthlessly achieve their personal and collective aims. A brief mention of the giant Ohya (Ohyah), is found in the Babylonian Talmud (Nidah, Ch 9), which gives the following: \"סיחון ועוג אחי הוו דאמר מר סיחון ועוג בני אחיה בר שמחזאי הוו\" (\"Sihon and Og [from the Book of Numbers] were brothers, as they were the sons of Ohia the son of Samhazai [alternately, 'Shemihazah' or 'Semiazus,' chieftain of the fallen angels in the Book of Enoch].\") Thus are provided, it would seem, the names of the sons of Ohyah, grandsons of Shemihazah. \"Og king of Bashan,\" ostensibly a giant, presumably escaped the flood (Num 13; Deut 2:2, 3:11, 13; Josh 12:4).\nThe giant Mahway, an associate of Ohyah, is summoned to the assembly of the fallen angels and put under secret oath 'under pain of death' to approach Enoch, the \"distinguished scribe\" and \"apostle from the south\" (Milik, p. 307; \"see\" Jubilees 4:25-6), in order to obtain prophetic interpretation of their sons' ominous visions of what appears threateningly to them as an imminent catastrophe: \"An oracle [I have come to ask you] here,\" declares Mahway, after listening to Enoch's message to the people. \"From you, a second time, [I] ask for the oracle: [We shall listen to] your words, all the \"nephilim\" of the earth also. If God is going to take away ... from the days of their [existence] ... that they may be punished ... [we, of these portents,] should like to know from you their explanation.\"\n\nThe elements of Hahyah's troubling dream include 200 garden-trees and gardeners, an Emperor, mighty winds, water, and fire. Enoch obliges the messenger of the Shemihazah-led assembly with his interpretation of the dreams: the 200 (female) trees watered by corrupt angelic 'gardeners' are, against their original nature, demon-defiled and unfruitful (producing bad fruit) — their waterers are the Watchers (once-good 'protector' or \"guardian\" angels gone bad) and the \"great\" shoots issuing from them, their bad-seed giant progeny — upon whom the \"Emperor of heaven\" will descend as a \"burning Sun\" (as upon a mighty \"whirlwind\" of fury) in great judgment: \"O ye lamentable ones, do not die now prematurely, but turn quickly back!\" is the declaration Mahway claims to have heard in his own dream (in which he is borne aloft on avian wings above the wilderness, the dearth and fray). The other visionary elements, as interpreted by Enoch, represent future exterminations by fire and water (sparing only \"three shoots\" — which Milik explains is an ancient Hebrew expression for Noah's sons). Mahway had also claimed to have heard Enoch \"speaking my name very lovingly\" in his desperate plea and call that the giant follow Enoch to safety.\n\nLater, after the fallen angels of Watchers and giants had asked Enoch to make petition and to intercede for them before God, Enoch (who takes his ascent in the northern land of Dan, at the foot of Mount Hermon) returned from that heavenly attempt (as he would also from his later universal visions and cosmic journeys made in the last year of his earthly sojourn, guided by the archangel Uriel) with two tablets — an 'Epistle' written in 'the distinguished scribe's own hand' from the Lord of Spirits and 'the Holy One,' giving God's answer \"to Shemihazah and all his companions\":\n\nLet it be known to you that ... your works and those of your wives and your children by your prostitution on the earth [the giants themselves being the 'sons of prostitution'] ... It now befalls you [that] the earth complains and accuses you [for your works], and the works of your children also, and her voice rises to the very portals of heaven, complaining and accusing you of the corruption by which you have corrupted her. [But she will mourn] until the coming of Raphael [Metatron-Enoch]. For lo! a destruction upon men and on animals: the birds which fly upon the face of heaven, and the animals which live on the earth, and those which live in the deserts, and those which live in the seas. And [thus does] the interpretation of your [dreams come upon] you for the worst.\n\nWhereupon, after the assembly of fallen angels are read the words of the Epistle (\"see\" 1 Enoch 13:3-5), the giants and Watchers, gathered together at the place Abel-mayyâ ('the spring of Weeping' between Lebanon and Senir), straightaway 'prostrated themselves and began to weep before Enoch,' for their request to heaven for clemency had been rejected, and God had cast them off (it is significant that they weep at the foot of their own mountain of blasphemous oath-taking): all was now 'for the worst.' The only solace that Enoch could therefore offer them at that point, for theirs appears to have been a point of 'no return,' was to \"loosen your bonds (of sin) which tie you up ... and begin to pray.\"\n\nThe archangel Raphael (Metatron-Enoch) was, according to Milik, charged by God to bind Asael (or 'Azazel': Satan, the \"ultimate\" fallen angel and divulger of God's holy Secrets and heavenly Mysteries, whom the others worshipped) hand and foot, and to heal the earth which the fallen angels had corrupted (the name 'Raphael' \"means\" 'God heals'; Asael is confronted by Raphael at 1 En 10:4-8 and by Enoch, as clearly 'both' are charged with the same mission, at 13:2). Milik notes the word-play on the double meaning of the verb \"rafa\" 'to tie' and 'to heal.' Reflecting upon God's decree in rejecting the fallen angels' petition, Milik says that \"the Watchers seem to be \"already\" chained up by the [arch]angels; [for] in order to be able to pray, to lift their arms in the gesture of suppliants, they have to have their bonds loosened\" — that is, \"spiritually\", if they will, through repentance (a genuine yearning for which, however, they appear to be 'past feeling' [Eph 4:19], and it is this stark reality of which Heaven is all too aware).\n\n[Thereupon] the roaring of the wild beasts came and the multitude of the wild animals began to cry out... And Ohyah spoke ... My dream has overwhelmed me ... and the sleep of my eyes has fled ... Then God punished ... the sons of the Watchers, the giants, and all [their] beloved ones [who would] not be spared ... [Then Ohyah said to Hahyah, his brother:] he has imprisoned us and you [as in your dream] he has subdued [\"tegaf\": seized, confined; \"see\" Jubilees 10:5 and 1 Enoch 10:11-15] ...\n\nIn the Manichaean \"Book of Giants\", Milik explains, Raphael (Enoch's 'heavenly double') is the \"conqueror\" of Ohyah and of all the other Watchers and of their giant-sons. The same work intimates that all four archangels (Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, and Uriel) were engaged in the struggle with the 200 Watchers and their offspring: \"and those two hundred demons fought a hard battle with the four angels, until the angels used fire, naphtha, and brimstone...\" The Enochic literature records the collusion of the archangels with the righteous (both seen and unseen - \"see\" 2 Kings 6:16) against their demon-foes: \"Four hundred thousand Righteous ... [came] with fire, naphtha, and brimstone ... And the [fallen] angels moved out of sight of Enoch\" (\"see\" Reeves, pp. 160–161 note 389; in the \"Book of Moses\", at 7:14-15, the giants \"stood afar off,\" in \"great fear\" of Enoch and \"the people of God\"). Then, after the course of more than three hundred years dwelling amidst his \"holy people\" (Moses 7:18, 68-69), when the patriarch-warrior-king suddenly \"was not; for God took him\" (Genesis 5:24; \"see\" Reeves, p. 77), the archangelic Raphael-Metatron sent to Shemihazah a warning-message that brought complete fulfilment to heaven's former decree: \"The Holy One is about to destroy His world, and bring upon it a flood\" (Milik, pp. 316 note 12, 328).\n\nThe archangel Uriel, beyond his role of instructing Enoch among the stars, directs Noah to prepare his escape from the Flood, and figures prominently in the final Judgement of the world in the end times that will be administered by the 'Son of Man' figure as foretold in Enoch's Book of Dreams and Apocalypse of Weeks. Two other archangels, Raguel and Phanuel (sometimes confused with the archangelic name-corruption 'Remiel' > Eremiel > Jeremiel), are also mentioned in the Enochic material. With respect to the archangel Sariel (a name sometimes given in the Qumranic texts as taking the place of Uriel or Phanuel), it is the Manichaean tradition, drawing on the Book of Giants, that preserves that archangelic name more faithfully than do the Greek and Ethiopic traditions.\n\nThe Qumran \"Book of Giants\", like its Manichaean counterpart, affiliates the names of the Sumerian hero Gilgamesh and the monster Humbaba with the Watchers and giants.\n\nAlthough we can glean much information from the fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls narrative, there are still many unknowns and issues that scholars heavily debate. Clearly, the authorship of the Qumran \"Book of Giants\" is still a question among scholars. Some initially believed that the manuscript (despite so many extant copies from Qumran of the overall Enochic work) to have been little used among the desert sectaries; but more recent scholarship declares: \"We know that the Qumran Essenes copied, studied, and \"valued\" the writings and teachings ascribed to Enoch\" (VanderKam, 2008/1995, p. 143). The Qumran discoveries decidedly ruled out any possibility that the Manicheans were the composers of the \"Book of Giants\", for their work followed later.\n\nHowever, the historical transmission of 1 Enoch assumes that the basis of the text must likewise fall to unknown authors, or tend to the idea that it was a pseudepigraphon text. For some scholars, this lends itself, as such texts invariably have, to questioning the originality and legitimacy of the book. But bearing in mind the \"eleven\" Enochic manuscripts discovered at Qumran, which contain one or several of the various Enochic 'booklets' known there — totals \"higher than for most of the books that became parts of the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament,\" and recalling also \"the cost and labor involved in producing a manuscript in antiquity\" — such inordinate numbers representing the Enochic stockpile \"say much about the value accorded\" such writings (VanderKam, 2008/1995, p. 184).\n\nAs far as comparisons that might be made with 'canonical' texts, the books of Daniel and 1 Enoch both have similarities (to give just one of many possible parallels) in their visionary elements: taking up the visions of both Daniel and Enoch, or even of the giants Ohyah, Hahyah, and Mahway. Indeed, Stuckenbruck suggests that \"these similarities ... allow for the possibility that the author of Daniel 7 knew the early Enochic traditions well enough to draw on and then adapt them for his own purposes. Nowhere is this clearer than in the throne-theophany itself\" (p. 119). The biblical and apocryphal accounts speak of a king of heaven sitting upon his throne, and the Aramaic text A12 has other corresponding elements. The texts differ, however, in that, in the giants' account, God comes down from heaven.\n\nSeveral such textual variants of the different 'Book of Giants' versions, moreover, raise many other points of ongoing debate among scholars and experts. For although all are said to derive in some measure from the same 'script,' they are, ultimately, very different in their content, particularly in the way that the Manichaean and Aramaic versions differ — even from later Jewish midrash retellings — in the elements of the giants' dreams or visions.\n\nIn the giant Ohyah's dream, for instance, he apparently sees a large inscribed-stone representation of the 'Book of Life' (from the inclusion in which, by defilement, the names of nearly all of Earth's inhabitants are forfeited) and/or the '' (which the Watchers and their offspring, by their defilement, have broken) that covers the whole earth \"like a table.\" In the midrash retelling, a great \"angel\" descends, but in the Qumranic version, the Lord of Heaven \"himself\" descends with a knife to scrape and efface all of its character-rows, save one, at the end of which only four words remain (the names of Noah and his three sons).\n\nJ.T. Milik believed the Book of Giants originally to have been a part of the entire Enochic work, the five-sectioned 'Enochic Pentateuch' as it is sometimes called, including the Book of Watchers, the Astronomical Book, the Book of Dreams, and the Epistle of Enoch (with its Apocalypse of Weeks); Milik felt that the Qumran \"Giants\" had actually been replaced by the Ethiopic 1 Enoch's 'Similitudes' (or 'Parables') section.\n\nAll of these Enochic writings would have held significance from the beginning of the first century. Indeed, the early Christian church treasured Enoch and held it canonical. However, during the Christian era after the Apostles, the collection was altered and part of its narrative (\"Giants\", it is thought) replaced by the Book of Parables. Also, due in no small part to the influence of the Alexandrian philosophers who ill-favored it — its contents thought by many of the Hellenistic era to be foolish or strange — the overall Enochic work rapidly ran afoul of ideas held by the Christian and Jewish doctors, who damned it forever as a tainted product of the Essenes of Qumran. Milik has speculated the reason why the book was censored by Christian authors was its popular usage by Manichaeans. The book was soon banned by such orthodox authorities as Hilary, Jerome, and Augustine in the fourth century and it gradually passed out of circulation, finally becoming lost to the knowledge of Western Christendom — only sundry 'fragments' remained. The few copies left of the Enoch literature, if indeed they could be found, was therefore attributable, it is thought, to the Christian doctors' suppression of it and their partial replacement with the Book of Parables.\n\nThe name of the giant 'Mahway' — the messenger figure from the Qumran \"Giants\" fragments who, by the 'fallen angels' assembly, is bound by a secret oath 'under pain of death' to secure from Enoch the interpretation of their sons' troubling visions — coincides with a name of very similar spelling that is assigned to this same 'Mahway' story-figure as he appears in the Enochic account found in \"The Book of Moses\" — a canonical work of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Church teaches that this account, consisting of two brief chapters within the greater 'ascension' story of Moses, was translated by the 25-year-old Prophet Joseph Smith in 1830-31 and later published in 1851.\n\nIn that rendition of the Enochic story, the spelling of the name of the 'Mahway' character who inquires after Enoch appears as 'Mahijah' (Moses 6:40). The Masoretic Hebrew text name 'MHWY' written in its transliterated Aramaic form in the Qumran \"Book of Giants\", bears semi-vowels \"w\" and \"y\" that appear very similar in the Aramaic script (confused at times by scribes). Attributable to this, and because the name as written equates in fact with the name MHWY-EL (appearing at Gen 4:18 as 'Mehujael,' who was a descendant of Cain and grandfather of the wicked Lamech, his name appearing a second time in the same verse as 'MHYY-EL'), scholars of this 'Mosaic' tradition of Enoch assert it to be the very same name.\n\nSimilarly, it appears in Smith's account again, not as the place-name 'Mahujah' as has previously been thought, but rather as another iteration of the personal Mahway name — because the verse-use of the second-person plural \"ye\" suggests that Mahijah was \"with\" Enoch when God directs them to 'turn aside' to pray upon mount Simeon (Moses 7:2); indeed, examination of the original manuscript confirms this, for it reads: \"As I was journeying and stood in the place, Mahujah \"and I\" cried unto the Lord. There came a voice out of heaven, saying — Turn ye, and get ye upon the mount\" (\"emphasis\" added; subsequent transcriptions by scribes had given the false impression that 'Mahujah' was a place-name, rather than what it was: simply an alternate spelling of the personal-name 'Mahijah'). In this prayerful context, it is conceivable that 'Mahway' (who recalls from his dream the prophet's loving plea to him) could have been one of Enoch's proselytes, perhaps even a citizen of his later mountain-city refuge. Enoch's grandfather, bore a similar name to MHWY — 'Mahalaleel' (meaning 'God has spoken'; Genesis 5:12-17). MHWY-EL is transliterated in the King James Bible as \"Mehuja-el\", which name also appears in the Greek Septuagint as \"Mai-el\" and in the Latin Vulgate as \"Mavia-el\".\n\nMehujael's grandson, the evil Lamech, and other Cainites like him, in the practice of their forebears, \"entered into a covenant with Satan after the manner of Cain\" wherein they — mimicking the oaths of the giants and Watchers — would constrain one another to \"Swear unto me by thy throat, and if thou tell it thou shalt die\" (Moses 5:29, 49, 52, 55), similar to 1 Enoch 6:5, where \"all swore together and bound one another with a curse.\" Lamech, who reveals to his exogamous wives \"the secrets of their wicked league\" (Moses 5:44, 47-55; 1 Enoch 8:3) also kills his great-grandfather Baraq'el/Virōgdād/Irad when this \"prominent member of the secret combination [the ninth chief under Shemihazah - 1 Enoch 69:3] revealed their secrets in violation of deadly oaths he had taken\" (Moses 5:49-50).\n\n<poem>\nAnd God said: ... And I took him ... and I appointed him (that is) Enoch, the son of Jared, whose name is Metatron ... my servant who is one (unique) among all the children of heaven. I made him strong in the generation of the first Adam. But when I beheld the men of the generation of the flood, that they were corrupt, then I went and removed my Shekina [radiant Presence, Spirit] from among them [\"compare\" Gen 6:3 and Moses 8:13, 15, 17-19, 21-22, 29-30] ...\n\nAnd I took [Enoch] from among the children of men and made him a Throne over against my Throne ... And I lifted him up with the sound of a trumpet and with a [shout] to the high heavens, to be my witness ... I made (of) him the prince over all the princes and a minister of [my] Throne of Glory ... (and I have committed unto him) the Secrets of above and ... of below [\"see\" Amos 3:7] ... And I committed to him Wisdom and intelligence more than (to) all the angels ... I made him higher than all ... I made his Throne great by the majesty of my Throne. And I increased its glory by the honour of my glory ... I made honour and majesty his clothing ... and a royal crown ... (his) diadem. And I put upon him ... the splendour of my glory.\n\nAnd I called his name \"the Lesser YHWH [Yahweh, 'little Jeu'],\" the Prince of the Presence, the Knower of Secrets: for every secret did I reveal to him as a father, and all mysteries declared I unto him in uprightness ... to abase by his word the proud to the ground, and to exalt by the utterance of his lips the humble to the height; to smite kings by his speech, to turn kings away from their paths ... and to give Wisdom unto all the wise ... and understanding (and) knowledge to all who understand knowledge ... to reveal to them the secrets of my words and to teach the decree of my righteous judgement. ~ 3 Enoch 48:1-2, 4-5, 7, 9\n\nAnd Metatron [Enoch] said: All these things the Holy One ... made for me: He made for me a Throne similar to the Throne of Glory. And He spread over [i.e., clothed] me [with] splendour and [glory, a garment of radiance and Light] ... of beauty, grace and mercy similar to [that of] the Throne of Glory ... And He ... seated me on it. And [a] herald went forth [and proclaimed in all the firmament of the heavens], saying: This is Metatron [Enoch], my servant. I have made him ... a prince and a ruler over all the princes of my kingdoms and over all the children of heaven [a divine king]! ~ 3 Enoch 10:1-3\n</poem>\nAs portrayed in other Enochic literature, the Enoch figure in the \"Book of Moses\" account is also a prophet acknowledged as priest and king by his people, but the founder, too, of their sacred society on earth. For after God has delivered to Enoch his verdict upon the unrepentant \"grigori\" and \"nephilim\" (the duplicitous 'sons of God' and their corrupt progeny who had \"trembled\" before him at Moses 6:47; \"see\" Mos 8:18, 21; 1 En 1:5, 13:3), the righteous retire with their leader to a place of safety in the mountains as God fights their battles for them ('Yahweh as warrior'). By his power (and the mouthpiece of his prophet-king), mountains fled, rivers altered their courses (Moses 6:34), and all nations feared the people of God ('holy ones, saints': \"ha-ʾelohîm\" 'sons of God'; Moses 7:13-16; \"see\" 6:68; 7:1). Their refuge city (\"called Zion, a New Jerusalem\" Mos 7:62; \"compare\" \"Jerusalem\" at \"T.\" Levi 10:5) lasted 365 years (Moses 7:17-20, 68) until it, with its king, was taken from a wicked world whose destruction was \"sealed\" and 'translated' to heaven — a blessed 'City of Zion' that according to Enoch's prophecy would return again to the earth in the last days (Moses 7:62-69)\n\nVery like the 'Mahway' character of the Qumran account, the 'Mahijah' of Smith's Enochic account also puts \"bold direct questions to Enoch,\" which similarly give the patriarch (who is viewed by the \"nephilim\" as \"a strange thing in the land\" - Moses 6:38) \"an opening\" for calling upon them to repent. The name MHWY, moreover, whether transliterated in its 'Mahway' or 'Mahijah' or 'Mehujael' forms, is not to be found elsewhere in the world among the various incarnations of the Enochic texts — as neither is the 'Mahway' \"story\" itself: the mission of MHWY to Enoch (and of Enoch to MHWY) is peculiar to the Enochic accounts as found in Qumran's (1948/1976) \"Book of Giants\" and Smith's (1830/1851) \"Book of Moses\".\n\nSmith's account of Enoch's prophetic 'call' (Moses 6:26-32) parallels the pattern of other biblical 'prophetic call narratives' (e.g., Moses at Exod 3-4, and Jeremiah at Jer 1) in its prophetic confrontation with the divine (Moses 6:26-28, 32, 35), the call-commission (6:27), the prophet's objection (6:31), followed by God's reassurance (6:32, 34) and 'sign'. The sign God manifests in 'opening' Enoch's eyes in the Ethiopic account (1 En 1:2), which allows the seer to experience the heavenly vision, mirrors Moses 6:35-36, wherein Enoch's eyes are 'anointed' and opened that he might 'see' the visions of heaven and \"also things which were not visible to the natural eye\" (similar to the calls of Isaiah and Jeremiah, both spokesmen for God, wherein, however, it is their \"lips\", instead, that are touched). Of particular note are several points at which the Enoch account in the \"Book of Moses\" aligns with the \"Book of Giants\" (Aramaic) and 2 (Slavonic) Enoch accounts that first came to light in 1948 and 1896, respectively, many decades after Joseph Smith's lifetime. The prominence of the Metatron-Enochic title 'lad' in 2 Enoch and 3 (Hebrew) Enoch matches its appearance in the Moses chapters, with Enoch's self-descriptive use of the 'lad' title at Moses 6:31. The prophet is similarly called 'little Enoch' in the Mandaean pseudepigraphon text, \"Livre d'Adam\", wherein, moreover, in its tale of Enoch (and similar to Smith's account at Moses 7:13), heavenly powers protectively turn \"the source of the waters ... from its course.\"\n\nOn the heels of the introduction in the \"Book of Giants\" of the battle between the earthly and heavenly hosts, \"the roaring of wild beasts\" from out of the wilderness is said to have been heard. Barker (1987) equates these 'beasts' of antiquity with the archangelic or 'supernatural' adversarial powers that mark similar biblical passages (pp. 131, 139-40 note 24). In the \"Book of Giants\", as witnessed in the words of the rebellious Ohyah to his brother Hahyah, the Watchers and \"nephilim\" are bound by the archangels and confined to their prison (\"until the day of their judgment\" — such is Ethiopic Enoch's description of their punishment in \"the valleys of the earth\" where \"those who led the world astray\" are \"bound in chains\" and \"shut up in the assembly-place of their destruction\" — \"led away to the fiery abyss\" of recompense and imprisonment for \"seventy generations,\" or until Judgement Day at world's end; \"see\" 1 En 10:12-13, 69:28). At these same points in the Enochic literature, Smith's Moses account matches the \"Book of Giants\" and the other Enochic passages remarkably, for therein, too, \"the roar of the lions was heard out of the wilderness\" (Moses 7:13; the 'roaring lion' motif is a 'son of man'-\"messianic\" allusion to an 'anointed one' of great judgment, acting in \"similitude\" of the Son of Man, such as perhaps a 'destroying archangel' might be - \"see\" 4 Ezra 11:37, 12:31-34; D&C 122:4) and the earth's profane inhabitants were relegated by God to \"perish in the floods; and behold, I will shut them up; a prison have I prepared for them\" (Moses 7:38).\n\nMoreover, the \"Moses\" and Ethiopic/Slavonic accounts agree that Enoch envisions the impending Flood (Mos 7:43; 1 En 91:5), foresees after several generations (a time mercifully afforded to allow the wicked a final chance to repent) that Noah and his posterity survive (Mos 7:23-27, 43, 52; 1 En 106:18; with God reducing the lifespan of the earthly races to 120 years at Mos 8:17 - \"see\" Reeves, pp. 117, 157-158 note 353), knows Noah's future through a God-directed eschatological vision (Mos 7:44-45, 51; 1 En 106:13-18), and witnesses and weeps with God for a suffering 'Mother Earth' who bemoans the rebellious 'children' that have issued forth from her (Mos 7:28-33, 41, 48-50; 1 En 7:6; 8:4; 9:2-3, 10; 90:41-42; 95:1; 107:3; and 2 En 1:2-4; \"see\" Reeves, p. 82). Finally, in the 'mystical ascent' tradition of 3 Enoch (10:1, 3; or of even Slavonic 2 Enoch), the antediluvian prophet of the \"Book of Moses\" account is given the \"right\" to the throne of God (Mos 7:59; a Mosaic parallel to this symbolic act of deification is seen in Meeks [2017]; but \"see also\" Orlov [2005], pp. 262–276, which relates, in an ancient work called the \"Exagōgē\", how Moses, in his 'prophet-king' ascent to God's throne, meets the archangel Raguel — thought to be that prophet's 'heavenly double').\n\nAnother striking similarity between the Apocalyptic stories of the 1 Enoch literature and the \"Book of Moses\" is the consistent use of the peculiar title 'Son of Man,' referring to the great figure of Judgement that is referenced in the 'Similitudes' of the Ethiopic account. The identity of that figure, who in the Pre-existence before Creation was, in the sanctuary of the Heavenly Temple, \"named in the presence of the Lord of Spirits\" (1 Enoch 48:2-3, which Elyon-'Lord' or heavenly-king figure is identified in the \"Book of Moses\" as 'Man of Holiness' — Father of the 'Son of Man' - Moses 6:57, 7:35), has been \"hidden,\" but will, according to the prophecy of 1 Enoch, be revealed at the end of days. In the one brief Enochic 'extract' of two chapters found in the \"Book of Moses\", the 'Son of Man' reference is used no fewer than eight times (Moses 6:57; 7:24, 47, 54-56, 59, 65). Other titles common to this 'single referent' figure both in 1 Enoch and the \"Book of Moses\" account are 'Chosen One' (Mos 7:39), 'Anointed One' (i.e., Messiah; \"see\" Mos 7:53), and 'Righteous One' (\"elsewhere\", 'Holy One'; Mos 6:57; 7:45, 47, 67).\n\n\n"}

Alleged ghost sightings and subsequent media attention are said to have added to the allure.\n\nLocated in the central-western part of the Adirondack region, Big Moose Lake covers in surface area. It is approximately long and almost wide, running in an east-west direction along its major axis. The lake ranges in depth from in its deepest parts, with an average depth of .\n\nIn the summer, temperatures average from nightly lows of to daytime highs of .

With minimal road access, the lake's shore had not been developed very much. The population reaches a peak during the summer months, when vacationers arrive to stay at summer homes or local resorts.\n\nThe lake and its surrounding region are a popular spot for tourists year-round; boating, water-skiing, hiking and train rides from Thendara are available in the summer, and cross-country skiing and snowmobiling take place in the winter. It is home to the Big Moose Water Ski Club, whose members are residents of the region.\n\nThe Pigeon Lake Wilderness Area lies just east of the lake.\n\nBig Moose lake also offers sport fishing opportunities for brook trout, lake trout, yellow perch, brown trout, and splake. There is a no state-owned boat launch; however, a commercial marina with a ramp is located on the south shore of West Bay.\n\nThe lake's region was settled by European Americans primarily during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as people gained access to the region by the first railroad constructed through the uninhabited Adirondack wilderness. Early trappers and hunters of the Adirondacks became guides there, eventually establishing permanent camps and hotels. Wealthy businessmen built large, private summer homes and their families lived here for the season, in the style of the Great Camps of the Vanderbilts and Morgans. Some of these lodges still exist. \n\nThe Big Moose Lake area is historically significant for its palisade architectural style, which used vertical half-log construction in lodges and cabins.\n\nBig Moose Lake was the setting of \"An American Tragedy\", a novel by Theodore Dreiser. He based his book on the historic events of the drowning murder of Grace Brown in the South Bay of Big Moose Lake in the early part of the 20th century.

(Dreiser named the lake where the murder took place as Big Bittern Lake, after having visited Big Moose Lake.) and used it as a model for his fictional version.) \n\n\"A Place in the Sun\", a film starring Elizabeth Taylor, Shelley Winters, and Montgomery Clift, was an adaptation of the novel. \n\nClaims of ghost sightings around the lake and associated with Grace Brown continue to be recorded. In 1996, the television series \"Unsolved Mysteries\" aired an episode that reenacted the events. It reported two such ghost sightings. On July 11, 2006 some residents organized a wreath-laying ceremony on South Bay to memorialize the centennial of Brown's murder. People participated from a small flotilla of watercraft.\n\nJennifer Donnelly based her historical novel, \"A Northern Light\" (2003), on this murder. She explores events from the perspective of a young girl working at the Glenmore (a lodge on the lake). Robert Tucker also set his novel, \"Sasquatch Camp\" (2013,) in this community.\n\nThe following places are listed on the National Register of Historic Places:\n\n\n"}

Long drought coupled with South Indian invasion completely neglected the repairs and maintenance of the advanced irrigation systems that was in place. The situation eased with the deaths of five warring princes and the return of King Valagambahu. As soon as Valagambahu took over power in 89 BC, work was done to repair and reconstruct the ill-fated irrigation system which saw the end of the baminitiya seya in 89 BC. Valagambahu is regarded as one of Sri Lanka's greatest heroes.\n\nThe famine is mentioned a number of times in the stories contained in \"Sihalavatthu Pakarana\", the oldest work of Ceylonese literature. It is related that at this time many monks left the island for India or the Maldives.\n\n"}
{"id": "1858488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858488", "title": "Noko", "text": "Noko\n\nNoko (born Norman Fisher-Jones, 1 February 1962, in Bootle, Lancashire, England) is an English multi-instrumentalist musician, composer and producer, has formed and/or played with a number of bands primarily as a guitarist or bassist. In chronological order they were: Alvin the Aardvark and the Fuzzy Ants, The Umbrella, The Pete Shelley Group, The Cure, Luxuria, Apollo 440, Stealth Sonic Soul, Fast, Maximum Roach, James Maker and Noko 440 (also known as Frankenstein), Magazine, Raw Chimp, Levyathan, SCISM, Am I Dead Yet? and The Buzzcocks (at the Pete Shelley Memorial concert at London's Royal Albert Hall in 2019).\n\nIn 1980, he formed his first band called Alvin the Aardvark & the Fuzzy Ants, who played their first gig on 16 January 1981 on \"After All That…This\", a Granada TV show presented by Nick Turnbull. Despite the DJ John Peel being a fan of their music, they never released any material, recording only an unreleased single at Open Eye Studios, in Liverpool and playing a few gigs in the North-West, most notably supporting Cabaret Voltaire at Nathan McGough's Plato's Ballroom in 1981, before disbanding the same year.\n\nIn 1983, he became involved with three bands. He joined The Cure as bassist, playing for some European and UK live–TV dates, and formed two bands, Dynamo Futurista and The Umbrella. The latter group, consisting of Noko (guitar and vocals), Simon Hoare (drums), Mark Sanderson (bass) and James Gardner, released a total of three songs before folding, which were released on an EP called \"Make Hell (For The Beautiful People)\".\n\nFounder Buzzcock and Magazine frontman, Howard Devoto, started writing with Noko in 1986 with a view to putting a band together to play Factory Records' Festival of the 10th Summer at G-Mex stadium in Manchester that summer to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Punk. They played a short set as Adultery, borrowing backline from The Smiths. (Noko also played a set with Pete Shelley at the same gig in a line-up that also included ex Magazine drummer John Doyle).\n\nThe line-up for that Adultery show was: Howard Devoto – vocals, Noko – lead guitar/viola, Leroy James – keyboards/2nd guitar, Pete Kinski – bass, Simon Hoare – drums. Signing to Beggars Banquet in 1987 and deciding on the name Luxuria, Devoto and Noko released two LPs: \"Unanswerable Lust\" (1988) and \"Beastbox\" (1990) and toured Europe and USA throughout 1988 with a line-up of Devoto and Noko on vocals/guitars and viola as usual and Karl Leiker – bass, Mark Rowlett – Drums/Sequential Studio 440, James Gardner – keyboards, programming, Frog – guitar/keyboards. The final Luxuria gig at The Town & Country Club (now the London Forum) in London featured cameo appearances by Barry Adamson (bass) on a rendition of Magazine's \"The Light Pours Out of Me\" for an encore, and Morrissey, who read a passage of Marcel Proust's \"A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu\" over the intro of \"Mademoiselle\" before throwing the tattered book into the crowd as the band kicked into the song. (There is a bootleg recording of the gig in circulation).\n\nWhen Luxuria folded in 1990, Noko got together with school friends, brothers Trevor Gray and Howard Gray, and James Gardner and formed Apollo 440.\n\nThe band released a number of singles and EPs on their own StealthSonic Recordings label: \"Lolita\" (1990), \"Destiny\" (1991), \"Blackout\" (1992) and \"Lolita/Destiny '92\" (1992).\n\nApollo 440 made four albums: \"Millennium Fever\" (1995), \"ElectroGlide In Blue\" (1997), \"Gettin' High On Your Own Supply\" (1999), and \"Dude Descending A Staircase\" (2003) on Sony Records. The band have been playing live in one form or another since their inception in 1990 to the present day and chronologically the touring line-ups are as follows:\n1990–1992: The band featured all founding members on keyboards, sequencers and drum machines and MCs Stevie Hyper-D and Tigga-Max guesting from time to time on vocals.\n\n1993–1995: James Gardner left for New Zealand where he has since established himself as a prominent composer writing music for his ensemble 175 East. Noko moved over to electric guitar and lead vocals, Trevor Gray on keyboards, Howard Gray on bass, and ex-Modern Eon drummer Cliff Hewitt was added to the line-up first on electronic, then onto acoustic drums. (Kenny Cougar briefly replaced Rej on bass during 1999).\n\n1996–2000: Noko – guitar, Trevor Gray – keyboards, Howard Gray – vibe controller/live-mix, Cliff Hewitt – ddrums, Paul Kodish – drums, Reinallt Ap Gwynnedd – bass, Mary Byker (ex-Gaye Bykers on Acid) – lead vocals, Harry-K – DJ/vocals. Simeon Bowring from A1 People replaced Rej on bass for a number of European festivals in 2000.\n\n2007–2008: Noko – guitar, Trevor Gray – keyboards, Howard Gray – vibe controller/live-mix. Cliff Hewitt – drums, Reinallt Ap Gwynnedd – bass, Ewan MacFarlane – lead vocals, Ashley Krajewski – MPC/keyboards.\n\n2008–present: Chuck Sabo briefly replaced Cliff Hewitt on drums in 2008 (and again in 2009) as Cliff had touring commitments with German artist Schiller; Steve Barney did the same in early 2010 and Mikey Cusick (who had previously played with Noko in Maximum Roach from 2004–2005) replaced Rej on bass in 2008 and remains the current Apollo 440 bassman.\n\nThe current 2010 Apollo 440 touring line-up: Noko – guitar, Trevor Gray – keyboards, Howard Gray – vibe controller/live-mix. Cliff Hewitt – drums, Mikey Cusick – bass/vocals, Ewan MacFarlane – lead vocals, Ashley Krajewski – MPC/keyboards/vocals.\n2004 saw Noko in a two-man band with James Maker which was at first called Frankenstein, but was later renamed to James Maker and Noko 440. The band released only one EP via Morrissey's Attack imprint (\"I'm Unbearable/Born That Way\") and the two musicians parted early 2005 after touring with a full band line-up on Morrissey's European and UK dates including his Meltdown at the Royal Festival Hall supporting the newly reformed New York Dolls. That line-up included Paul Kodish on drums, Simeon Bowring on bass, and Ashley Krajewski on keyboards.\n\nIn November 2008, Noko was announced as the guitarist of the reformed Magazine, joining his former collaborators Howard Devoto, Barry Adamson, John Doyle and Dave Formula.\n\nIn summer 2009, Magazine played \"The Soap Show: Episode 2009\" at the Royal Festival Hall. It was shown in two halves, the first of which was \"The Correct Use Of Soap\" LP in its original running order followed by the B-sides and the song \"Upside Down\" which had never been performed live before. They also played selected European festivals with a set culled from the \"Real Life & Thereafter\" tour.\n\nThe band rounded off the year's activities with appearances on BBC TV's \"Later – with Jools Holland\" and The BBC Electric Proms.\n\nMagazine have released a brand new live DVD and CD, \"Real Life & Thereafter: Live at Manchester Academy 17.02.09\".\n\n2009 also saw the completion and release of Noko's first full movie score. \"Une Affaire D'etat\", a French-language political thriller based on best-selling novel \"Nos Fantastiques Années Fric\" by Dominique Manotti was directed by Éric Valette and stars André Dussollier, Thierry Frémont and Rachida Brakni. European cinema release was in October of that year. A soundtrack CD is available on Milan Musique.\n\n2010 also saw the formation of Raw Chimp with Noko (guitar/vocals), his wife Deborah Fisher-Jones (bass), and Constance Kaler (lead vocals). Raw Chimp played their live debut that same year at the Download Festival.\n\nNoko also scored Éric Valette's next movie, \"La Proie\" which was released in France in April 2011 with worldwide distribution to follow later in 2012. Another French-language thriller, it was written by Laurent Turner and the movie's producer Luc Bossi, \"La Proie\" stars Albert Dupontel, Alice Taglioni, Stéphane Debac and Sergi Lopez. \nIt's a dark high-octane edgy chase movie starting in a prison and culminating in a tense mountain denouement. The score is essential orchestral with touches of electronica and a multitude of Noko's trademark guitar-textures.\nThe soundtrack CD is again available on Milan Musique.\n\nMagazine completed their \"No Thyself\" LP at the end of 2011, the first new material from the band since 1981's \"Magic, Murder and The Weather\", which was released on the Wire-Sound label. The band toured the UK in November. The LP and tour and BBC radio session were the first to feature new bass-player Stan White who replaced Barry Adamson.\n\nApollo 440's 5th LP \"The Future's What It Used To Be\" was released at the beginning of 2012 and the group continue to play live.\n\nIn 2012, Noko stepped in on bass guitar and backing vocals with London neo-grunge trio Levyathan, alongside Simon Maxwell on drums and David Norris on guitar and lead vocals. The band recorded a Noko-produced debut LP later that year at Apollo Control but it was never released. \n\nIn February 2013, Noko and Brad Lee from Discoordinated performed at Matthew Glamorre's multi-media series of art-happenings, C.R.U.X. at Zero-One Gallery in Hopkins St. Soho, London W1.\nThey revisited their 2-man version of Roxy Music's classic, \"In Every Dream Home A Heartache\" last performed in 2007.\n\nIn March 2013, Noko composed and performed his one-man live music score on electric guitar to Theatre Of Post Eroticism's production of BDSM Faust : an adaption of Johann Wolfgang Goethe's 1808 \"Faust\" (Part 1). There was another UK run of the production in June and the show was performed in Romania later in the year.\n\nIn 2014, Noko co-wrote/ co-produced some tracks for Japanese \"Kill Bill\" superstar guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei's LP \"New Beginnings\" (released in Japan Virgin/Universal TYCT-60046).\nThese were \"Sons Of Sorrow\", \"New Chemical\" and \"Barrel Of My Own Gun\". Noko played bass guitar on \"Sons Of Sorrow\" and \"Barrel Of My Own Gun\" and vocals on \"Barrel of my own Gun\" and \"New Chemical\".\nWhen Hotei later signed to Universal's Spinefarm imprint, this LP was repackaged with some extra tracks for release outside of Japan as \"Strangers\" (SPINE663762) and included a re-worked version of \"New Chemical\" titled \"Move It\", featuring a lead vocal by Richard Z. Kruspe from Rammstein.\nIt was at Noko's suggestion that Hotei approached Iggy Pop to sing two other tracks on the album, which became \"How The Cookie Crumbles\" and \"Walking Through The Night\".\n\nHotei and Noko have been friends since 1997, first meeting when Apollo 440 remixed one of Hotei's tracks. They share a birthday, having both been born on exactly the same day, 1 February 1962.\nSince 2014 Noko has periodically toured with Hotei in Europe, U.S. and Japan, playing bass guitar in various line-ups, including drummers Steve Barney, Cliff Hewitt and Zachary Alford.\n\nLater in 2014, Noko produced and mixed Pop Will Eat Itself's \"Reclaim The Game (Funk FIFA)\" unofficial Brazil World Cup 2014 theme featuring Brazilian rap artist BNegão.\n\nNoko went on to produce and mix some tracks for the band's 2015 \"Anti-Nasty League\" album (RUMJOINT0005): \"Sacrifice And Pain\", \"Director's Cut\" and \"Mental Pollution\" (to which he had a writing contribution), playing additional guitar, bass and various keyboard/programming enhancements along the way.\nThis led to the band he formed with Brad Lee, $HirtLiftA supporting PWEI on their UK tour that summer: Brad Lee on vocals, Noko on guitar and Frank Horovich on guitar and electronics.\n\nIn 2016, Noko reunited with Matthew Glamorre to form SCISM, the 'house-band' at his SCISM audio-visual, multi-media art-happening nightclub on EU Referendum night in London.\nThey recorded and released \"Dalston Bump\" to coincide with a series of events at Vogue Fabrics in Dalston.\nIn Summer 2017 SCISM played a set at Churchtown festival in Cornwall and again in September at The Bargehouse in London as part of Open London weekend.\n\nIn April 2017, Magazine released the vinyl-only \"Old World Charm\" (WIRED42) : 6 tracks recorded at the BBC Electric Proms at Roundhouse, London in 2009. The Graeme Oxby pic on the rear of the sleeve featured Noko's MXR 'flanger-on-a-stick'.\n\nNoko composed and produced the music score for director Darren Cavanagh's feature-length documentary \"Ex-Dominatrix\", for release in December 2017.\nThe movie opened the 2019 London Fetish Film Festival, at which it won Best Feature.\n\nIn 2017, Noko and Mary Byker started work recording a body of songs that would become the debut Am I Dead Yet? album, which was released on the Wire-Sound label in April 2019 (WIRED#48). A 5-track remix EP, “Never Mind The Bolex…Am I Dead Yet? reimagined on 35mm”(WIRED#49), which featured cinematic dub remixes of some of the album highlights, was released as a download only, free with advance-orders of the album during the crowd-fun run-up to the actual release. Live dates promoting the album saw the live line-up expanded with the addition of Cliff Hewitt from Apollo 440 on drums and Derek ‘Hoodlum Priest’ Thompson on bass guitar.\n\nThe nature of the Apollo 440 remix and production process means Noko has played on too many records by other artists to list usefully here.\n\nStealthSonicSoul was an alter-ego spin-off project by the three members of Apollo 440. One release \"StealthSonicSoul\" came out in 1992 on Scottish 23rd Precinct affiliated Limbo label. A further track \"StealthSonic Sun In Her Hair\" appeared on a Limbo compilation the following year.\n\nThe EZ Drum & Bass Orchestra consisted of Noko and Frederick Pasquan and made one commercially available EP \"Beat Girl\" b/w \"EZ Beat Girl\" and \"Slow Beat Girl\" on the Sliced label in 1996.\n\nThe duo also remixed a number of other artists e.g. \"Carrerra Rapida -EZ Drum&Bass Orchestra Remix\" by Apollo 440 on Sony in 1997.\n\nNoko played bass in 1991 on the \"Total Abandon\" EP and \"Jubilee Twist\" LP in 1992 by The Heart Throbs, a group from Reading who folded in 1993.\nNoko played a number of gigs with the band in 1991 and was in the line up that was joined onstage on 25 October of that year by Only Ones frontman, Peter Perrett at Underworld, Camden Town,London, for a version of The Only Ones' \"Lovers Of Today\" along with a few other songs.\nIn the same year, he played abstract guitar on the song \"Ventriloquists and Dolls\" from Momus's album \"Hippopotamomus\".\n\nIn 1992, Noko produced the one and only LP by Hyperhead, \"Metaphasia\", which came out on the Devotion label. The band was formed by Mary Byker. \nAfter Gaye Bykers on Acid split, Mary joined and toured with industrial supergroup Pigface before forming Hyperhead, which included contributions from his Pigface colleagues Martin Atkins (also formerly of PiL and Killing Joke) and William Tucker (also previously of Revolting Cocks and My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult), along with bassist Karl Leiker (who had previously played with Noko in Luxuria) and guitarist Paul Dalloway.\n\nAlso in 1992, Noko collaborated with Stuart Crichton as Johnny Potatohead, releasing a single, \"Johnny Potatohead\" on Reverb Records.\n\nOn 14 July 1998, Apollo 440 played \"La Nuit Electronique\" concert with Jean Michel Jarre, with whom they had collaborated twice that year : firstly on the single \"Rendezvous '98\" (which became the ITV World Cup Theme in UK and reached #10 in the singles chart) and an @440 remix of \"Oxygene 10\". Apollo performed the two tracks live onstage with JMJ in front of the Eiffel Tower to an audience of over 600,000. It was Bastille Day and only two days before, France had won the World Cup. Immediately after they won on 12th, the Mayor of Paris asked Jarre to put together this impromtu free concert for the people of Paris to extend the euphoria. At the climax of the show, an enormous firework display went off on the Eiffel tower behind the stage.\nThis was the largest concert Noko has ever played. Noko and both Gray brothers all played synthesiser and Jean Michel Jarre played theremin.\n\nFrom 2002–2004, Noko was involved as Producer/Musical Director for The Prada Meinhof Gang, an all-female Art-Terrorist troupe active between 2002–2004, whose activities included performance/installations at the Venice Biennalle, Tate Britain, ICA etc. Their track \"Want Is Your Master\" was included on the free CD compilation that accompanied the \"Music\" issue of \"Modern Painters\" magazine.\n\nIn March 2007, Apollo 440 played the \"A Tribute To Billy MacKenzie\" charity concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire alongside British Electric Foundation (their first ever live show),Glenn Gregory (Heaven 17), Claudia Brücken (Propaganda) and Paul Humphries (OMD) and Paul Haig, amongst others. It was 10 years after his death.\nApollo, with Ewan MacFarlane on vocals closed the show with \"Pain In Any Language\" from their 2nd LP \"Electroglide In Blue\".\nThis collaboration was the last song MacKenzie finished before his tragic suicide only weeks later. \nThe Apollo set also included their cover of The Smiths' \"William, it was really nothing\" - the only time it was ever performed live. \n\nNoko made his feature-film debut with a brief cameo appearance as an accordion-playing Parisian street musician in Éric Valette's \"Une Affaire D'Etat\" movie in 2009.\nHe also had a cameo in Éric Valette's next movie \"La Proie\" in 2011 as a harpsichord player in a music-recital scene set in a prison which culminates in a full-scale riot.\n\nIn 2011, Noko contributed guitar to two tracks on \"The Organ Of Corti\", an LP by Magazine's Dave Formula and cellist Christine Hanson.\n\nAfter the passing of Pete Shelley in December 2018, Noko was asked to perform with the current Buzzcocks, Steve Diggle, Danny Farrant and Chris Remington, at a special memorial concert at London's Royal Albert Hall on June 21. The concert featured original Buzzcocks drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey alongside a number of special guests, including Pauline Murray (Penetration), Captain Sensible (The Damned), Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth), Peter Perrett (The Only Ones), Richard Jobson (Skids), Dave Vanian (The Damned) and Tim Burgess (The Charlatans).\nNoko played Pete Shelley's guitar parts and solos for the duration of the show, which was MC'd by Paul Morley and included tributes by original Buzzcocks manager and New Hormones label founder Richard Boon, original Buzzcock Howard Devoto, who provided a short film featuring a world premiere of a \"Buzzkunst\" track that he'd recorded with Pete, but was never released and, to end the show, a eulogy and special thanks from Pete's wife Greta.\nAppropriately, Noko played two songs, \"Boredom\" and \"Time's Up\" on a red 1960s Starway guitar - the same model made famous by Pete during the early \"Spiral Scratch\" days of the band, with its missing top-section.\n\nFor Apollo 440 live, throughout the late 1990s Noko used the following guitars: a green Parker Fly Classic, a blue Parker Fly Deluxe and a pink Fender 1962 reissue Stratocaster through a pair of Digitech 2112 rack FX units, an 1980s Roland GP-8 and Fender Twins, but whilst the guitars remain the same, the preamps have been upgraded to Digitech GSP 1101 units with Control 2 foot controller through either a Marshall JCM2000 TSL through a Marshall 1960AX 4x12\" cab or a Marshall EL34 50/50 power-amp and a pair of 4x12\"s \n\nNoko's 2017 @440 rig was the same 3 guitars into a Kemper Powerack (Fender Tube Reverb tank in FX loop) into a Marshall 1936 2 x 12\" cab with a pedalboard incorporating Kemper Remote, a Boss DM-3 and a Boss FT-2 in conjunction with 2 EV-5 expression pedals.\n\nWhile he was touring with Magazine in 2009, Noko used a pair of green Yamaha SG1500 guitars with an MXR dyna comp, MXR flanger, Boss DM-3 and Boss PS-5. The flanger was stand-mounted as per John McGeoch and Robin Simon's setup with the band in the late 1970s. For amplification, Noko used two late 1970s Marshall JMP 2x12\" combos with Marshall 4x12'cabinets and a Fender Twin. A Variax 700 Acoustic was used for the intro of \"I Want To Burn Again\" through another late 1970s MXR flanger.\n\nNoko used a 1978 Black Ovation Magnum II bass guitar with Levyathan through a Boss CE-2 and boss OC-2 into a Sansamp Bass Driver and EBS Fafner Bass rig. A jetglow '74 Rickenbacker 4001 was used for one or two gigs during his time with the band.\n\nWhilst on tour with Tomoyasu Hotei, Noko's bass rig was as follows : Ibanez Black Eagle(Reissue), 1978 Antoria Snow Eagle, 1982 G&L L-1000(natural), 1978 Ovation Magnum II (black)\ninto : EBS Fafner MkI through EBS Neo 210 and EBS Neo 115 cabs, with the top-end (up an octave through electroharmonix POG2) split through Kemper Powerack into Marshall 1936 cab.\n\nNoko's 2019 live rig for both Apollo 440 and Am I Dead Yet? is the same 3 guitars into the Kemper and either a Mission Engineering Gemini GM-2 FRFR system, or a Matrix GT800FX stereo power amp and stereo Marshall 1960 4x12\"cab(s) for international shows. His pedalboard now includes an Xotic EP boost and the Boss FT-2 and Fender reverb tank have gone. \nTwo Gretsch White Falcons (single and double cut-aways) were used extensively during the making of the \"Am I Dead Yet?\" album, but not live shows, so far.\n\nFor the Pete Shelley Memorial show with The Buzzcocks at London's Royal Albert Hall, he used Pete's old Marshall JCM-900 and a sunburst late '70s Ibanez AR-300 Artist, his green Yamaha SG-1500 and a red 1960s Starway J-1. The only pedals were MXR Flanger, Xotic EP boost and Boss Hyper Fuzz.\n\n"}

Two albums' worth of material had resulted from these sessions, but were unfinished and not intended for release. Later, when Vangelis was becoming famous, the label published the material without his permission, using forged signatures, and in 1978 two albums appeared in shops, on the Affinity label (a subsidiary of Charly Records) - \"Hypothesis\" and \"The Dragon\". Vangelis won a court case to have both LPs taken off the market. He said greed was the motivation for releasing the sub-par albums: \"I don't agree with that music at all.\"\n\nThe album takes the form of an extended jam session of experimental jazz.\n\nAn alternative release of \"Hypothesis\" was titled \"Visions of the Future\".\n\nIn Germany \"Hypothesis\" and \"The Dragon\" were issued together as a double album titled \"Portrait\".\n\nThe cover artwork for \"Hypothesis\" is by Angus McKie, and is merely a \"borrowed\" illustration he drew for a series of novels by SF author Brian Stableford, featuring the spacecraft Hooded Swan, mentioned in the books.\n\n\n"}

It facilitates development of multi-processor designs with large numbers of controllers and components with a bus architecture. Since its inception, the scope of AMBA has, despite its name, gone far beyond microcontroller devices. Today, AMBA is widely used on a range of ASIC and SoC parts including applications processors used in modern portable mobile devices like smartphones. AMBA is a registered trademark of ARM Ltd.\n\nAMBA was introduced by ARM in 1996. The first AMBA buses were the Advanced System Bus (ASB) and the Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB). In its second version, AMBA 2 in 1999, ARM added AMBA High-performance Bus (AHB) that is a single clock-edge protocol. In 2003, ARM introduced the third generation, AMBA 3, including Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) to reach even higher performance interconnect and the Advanced Trace Bus (ATB) as part of the CoreSight on-chip debug and trace solution. In 2010 the AMBA 4 specifications were introduced starting with AMBA 4 AXI4, then in 2011 extending system-wide coherency with AMBA 4 ACE. In 2013 the AMBA 5 CHI (Coherent Hub Interface) specification was introduced, with a re-designed high-speed transport layer and features designed to reduce congestion.\n\nThese protocols are today the de facto standard for embedded processor bus architectures because they are well documented and can be used without royalties.\n\nAn important aspect of an SoC is not only which components or blocks it houses, but also how they interconnect. AMBA is a solution for the blocks to interface with each other.\n\nThe objective of the AMBA specification is to:\n\n\nThe AMBA specification defines an on-chip communications standard for designing high-performance embedded microcontrollers. It is supported by ARM Limited with wide cross-industry participation.\n\nThe \"AMBA 5 specification\" defines the following buses/interfaces:\n\nThe \"AMBA 4 specification\" defines following buses/interfaces:\n\n\nAMBA 3 specification defines four buses/interfaces:\n\n\nAMBA 2 specification defines three buses/interfaces:\n\n\nAMBA specification (First version) defines two buses/interfaces:\n\n\nThe timing aspects and the voltage levels on the bus are not dictated by the specifications.\n\nACE, defined as part of the AMBA 4 specification, extends AXI with additional signalling introducing system wide coherency. This system coherency allows multiple processors to share memory and enables technology like ARM's big.LITTLE processing. The ACE-Lite protocol enables one-way aka IO coherency, for example a network interface that can read from the caches of a fully coherent ACE processor.\n\nAXI, the third generation of AMBA interface defined in the AMBA 3 specification, is targeted at high performance, high clock frequency system designs and includes features that make it suitable for high speed sub-micrometer interconnect:\n\nAHB is a bus protocol introduced in Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture version 2 published by ARM Ltd company.\n\nIn addition to previous release, it has the following features:\n\n\nA simple transaction on the AHB consists of an address phase and a subsequent data phase (without wait states: only two bus-cycles). Access to the target device is controlled through a MUX (non-tristate), thereby admitting bus-access to one bus-master at a time.\n\nAHB-Lite is a subset of AHB formally defined in the AMBA 3 standard. This subset simplifies the design for a bus with a single master.\n\nAPB is designed for low bandwidth control accesses, for example register interfaces on system peripherals. This bus has an address and data phase similar to AHB, but a much reduced, low complexity signal list (for example no bursts).\nFurthermore, It is an interface designed for a low frequency system with a low bit width (32bits).\n\nA family of synthesizable intellectual property (IP) cores \"AMBA Products\" is licensable from ARM Limited that implement a digital bus in an SoC for the efficient moving and storing of data using the AMBA protocol specifications. The AMBA family includes AMBA Network Interconnect (CoreLink NIC-400), Cache Coherent Interconnect (CoreLink CCI-500), SDRAM memory controllers (CoreLink DMC-400), DMA controllers (CoreLink DMA-230, DMA-330), level 2 cache controllers (L2C-310), etc.\n\nA number of manufacturers utilize AMBA buses for non-ARM designs. As an example Infineon uses an AMBA bus for the ADM5120 SoC based on the MIPS architecture.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a commentator on the Hebrew Bible. He was one of two people now known as Rabbeinu Behaye, the other being philosopher Bahya ibn Paquda.\n\nHe is considered by Jewish scholars to be one of the most distinguished of the biblical exegetes of Spain. He was a pupil of Rabbi Shlomo ibn Aderet (the \"Rashba\"). Unlike the latter, Bahya did not publish a Talmud commentary. In his biblical exegesis, Bahya took as his model Rabbi Moses ben Nahman (Nachmanides) or \"Ramban\", the teacher of Rabbi Shlomo ibn Aderet, who was the first major commentator to make extensive use of the Kabbalah as a means of interpreting the Torah. He discharged with zeal the duties of a \"darshan\" (\"preacher\") in his native city of Zaragoza, sharing this position with several others.\n\nAmong Bahya's principal works was his commentary on the Torah (the five books of Moses), in the preparation of which he thoroughly investigated the works of former biblical exegetes, using all the methods employed by them in his interpretations.\n\nHe enumerates the following four methods, all of which in his opinion are indispensable to the exegete:\n\nGenerally speaking, Rabbi Bahya does not reveal any of his Kabbalistic sources, other than generally referring to \"Sefer HaBahir\" and the works of Nachmanides. He only mentions the Zohar twice.\n\nBahya's commentary is considered to derive a particular charm from its form. Each parashah, or weekly lesson, is prefaced by an introduction preparing the reader for the fundamental ideas to be discussed; and this introduction bears a motto in the form of some verse selected from the Book of Mishlei / Proverbs. Furthermore, by the questions that are frequently raised the reader is compelled to take part in the author's mental processes; the danger of monotony being also thereby removed.\n\nThe commentary was first printed at Naples in 1492; and the favor which it enjoyed is attested by the numerous supercommentaries published on it. Owing to the large space devoted to the Kabbalah, the work was particularly valuable to Kabbalists, although Rabbi Bahya also availed himself of non-Jewish sources. Later editions of the commentary appeared at Pesaro, 1507, 1514, and 1517; Constantinople, 1517; Rimini, 1524; Venice, 1544, 1546, 1559, 1566, and later. Not less than ten super-commentaries are enumerated by Bernstein (\"Monatsschrift\" xviii. 194-196), which give further evidence of the popularity of the work.\n\nHis next most famous work was his \"Kad ha-Kemah\" (\"The Flour-Jar\") (Constantinople, 1515.) It consists of sixty chapters, alphabetically arranged, containing discourses and dissertations on the requirements of religion and morality, as well as Jewish ritual practices. \"Kad ha-Kemah\" is a work of Musar literature, the purpose of which is to promote a moral life. In it Bahye discusses the following subjects: belief and faith in God; the divine attributes and the nature of providence; the duty of loving God, and of walking before God in simplicity and humility of heart; the fear of God; Jewish prayer; benevolence, and the love of mankind; peace; the administration of justice, and the sacredness of the oath; the duty of respecting the property and honor of one's fellow man; the Jewish holidays, and halakha (loosely translated as \"Jewish law\".)\n\nAnother work of Bahya, also published frequently, and in the first Mantua edition of 1514 erroneously ascribed to Nachmanides, bears the title of \"Shulkhan Arba\" (\"Table [of] Four\"). It consists of four chapters, the first three of which contain religious rules of conduct regarding the various meals, while the fourth chapter treats of the banquet of the righteous in the world to come.\n\nA work might have been written by Rabbi Bahye under the title of \"Hoshen ha-Mishpat\" (\"Breastplate of Judgment\"). Reference to this work is made only once by him, and it is unknown if this work was actually written or not.\n\nA number of works whose author is simply \"Bahya\", or whose authors are unknown, have been attributed to Rabbi Bahye ben Asher. Many modern day authorities on Rabbi Bahya's writings have shown that many of these attributions are spurious.\n\n\nOne book ostensibly written by Bahya, edited by M. Homburg under the title of \"Soba Semakhot\" (\"Fulness of Joy\"), as being a commentary on the Book of Job, is actually a compilation made by a later editor from two of Bahye's actual works, \"Kad ha-Kemah\" (Constantinople, 1515) and \"Shulhan shel Arba\" (Mantua, 1514).\n"}
{"id": "1858505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858505", "title": "ARexx", "text": "ARexx\n\nARexx is an implementation of the Rexx language for the Amiga, written in 1987 by William S. Hawes, with a number of Amiga-specific features beyond standard REXX facilities. Like most REXX implementations, ARexx is an interpreted language. Programs written for ARexx are called \"scripts\", or \"macros\"; several programs offer the ability to run ARexx scripts in their main interface as macros.\n\nARexx can easily communicate with third-party software that implements an \"ARexx port\". Any Amiga application or script can define a set of commands and functions for ARexx to address, thus making the capabilities of the software available to the scripts written in ARexx.\n\nARexx can direct commands and functions to several applications from the same script, thus offering the opportunity to mix and match functions from the different programs. For example, an ARexx script could extract data from a database, insert the data into a spreadsheet to perform calculations on it, then insert tables and charts based on the results into a word processor document.\n\nARexx was first created in 1987, developed for the Amiga by William S. Hawes. It is based on the REXX language described by Mike Cowlishaw in the book \"The REXX Language: A Practical Approach to Programming\". ARexx was included by Commodore with AmigaOS 2.0 in 1990, and has been included with all subsequent AmigaOS releases. This later version of ARexx follows the official REXX language closely; Hawes was later involved in drafting the ANSI standard for REXX.\n\nARexx is written in 68000 Assembly, and cannot therefore function at full speed with new PPC CPUs, a version of ARexx has not been rewritten for them and is still missing from MorphOS 3.0. William Hawes is no longer involved in development of Amiga programs and no other Amiga-related firm is financing new versions of ARexx. Notwithstanding this fact, the existing version of ARexx continues to be used, although it is not distributed with MorphOS.\n\nFrom the ARexx manual:\nARexx was developed on an Amiga 1000 computer with 512k bytes of\nmemory and two floppy disk drives. The language prototype was\ndeveloped in C using Lattice C, and the production version was written\nin assembly-language using the Metacomco assembler. The documentation\nwas created using the TxEd editor, and was set in TeX using AmigaTeX.\nThis is a 100% Amiga product.\nARexx is a programming language that can communicate with other applications. Using ARexx, for example, one could request data from a database application and send it to a spreadsheet application. To support this facility, an application must be \"ARexx compatible\" by being able to receive commands from ARexx and execute them. A database program might have commands to search for, retrieve, and save data — the MicroFiche Filer database has an extensive ARexx command set. A text editor might have ARexx commands corresponding to its editing command set — the Textra editor supplied with JForth can be used to provide an integrated programming environment. The AmigaVision multimedia presentation program also has ARexx port built in and can control other programs using ARexx.\n\nARexx can increase the power of a computer by combining the capabilities of various programs. Because of the popularity of a stand-alone ARexx package, Commodore included it with Release 2 of AmigaDOS.\n\nLike all REXX implementations, ARexx uses \"typeless\" data representation. Other programming languages made distinctions between integers, floating point numbers, strings, characters, vectors, \"etc\". In contrast, REXX systems treat all data as strings of characters, making it simpler to write expressions and algorithms.\nAs is often the case in dynamically scoped languages, variables are not declared before using them, they come into being on their first use.\n\nARexx scripts benefit from an error handling system which monitors execution and responds accordingly. The programmer can choose to suspend and resume the execution of the program as needed.\n\nThe ARexx command set is simple, but in addition to the commands there are the functions of its Amiga reference library (rexxsyslib.library). It is also easy to add other libraries or individual functions. ARexx scripts can also be invoked as functions from other ARexx scripts. Any Amiga program which has an ARexx port built in can share its functions with ARexx scripts.\n\nIf end user is using a program which builds animations by joining various bitmap image files but which lacks image processing capabilities, he could write an ARexx script which performs these actions:\n\n\nEqFiles.rexx is a well-known example of a simple ARexx script written to automate repetitive and boring procedures. This script uses the ALeXcompare program to compare files, and then finds all duplicates in a set of files and returns output by highlighting any results in a different color.\n\nOne of the main features of ARexx is the fact it could expand the capabilities of the AmigaOS by adding some procedures the OS lacked. For example, a simple ARexx program could be written to print a warning message on the screen of the monitor, or play an audio alert signal if a certain Amiga program stops, faults or has finished its scheduled job.\n\nThe following script is a minimal ARexx script that displays warnings depending on events that take place.\n\n\n\n"}

The municipality Wallisellen has its origin between 400 and 700 BC, after the Germanic migration of the peoples. Wallisellen is named according to both parts \"Walchen\" and \"Seller\". The Germanic peoples described as \"Walchen\" its Celtic and Romanic neighbours (see Walensee, lake of the Walchen). The word \"Seller\" stands for immigrated farmers, in contrast to long-established farmers, who cultivated small and modest farms. Linguists think that the name originated because Franks or Alemanni gave the name \"Wallisellen\" to a small farmer settlement, which was inhabited or founded by Celts or Romans.\n\nWith inauguration of the NOB-line Zürich–Wallisellen–Winterthur on 25 June 1856 Wallisellen had its first connection with the Swiss railway network. \n\nIn 1916, the municipality of Rieden merged with Wallisellen. In the interwar period Wallisellen developed from a village to a growing suburb-municipality of Zurich, but didn't want to have a town charter.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Wallisellen took part hugely in the \"Anbauschlacht\" (\"cultivation battle\", i.e. increase in domestic food production due to reductions in imports) (Plan Wahlen). \n\nIn 1958 the Roman Catholic church of St. Antonius was built.\n\nWallisellen has an area of . Of this area, 23.8% is used for agricultural purposes, while 20.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 54.5% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (1.5%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains).\n\nWallisellen has a population (as of ) of . , 25.5% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 11.8%. Most of the population () speaks German (83.2%), with Italian being second most common ( 3.8%) and Serbo-Croatian being third (1.9%).\n\nIn the 2007 election the most popular party was the SVP which received 38.6% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the SPS (19%), the FDP (15.4%) and the CSP (9.8%).\n\nThe age distribution of the population () is children and teenagers (0–19 years old) making up 19.1% of the population, while adults (20–64 years old) make up 64.4% and seniors (over 64 years old) make up 16.5%. In Wallisellen about 76.9% of the population (between age 25-64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a \"Fachhochschule\").\n\nWallisellen has an unemployment rate of 3.21%. , there were 50 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 16 businesses involved in this sector. 3085 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 137 businesses in this sector. 8950 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 731 businesses in this sector.\n\nThe large Shopping Center Glatt is an indoor shopping mall in the municipality, which opened in 1975.\n\nBetween it and Wallisellen railway station lies Richti Shopping, an open-air shopping center, which was officially opened in winter 2013 and was completed by end of 2014.\n\nWallisellen Bahnhof is a stop of the Zürich S-Bahn on the lines S8, S14, S19 and on the Stadtbahn Glattal light rail system. It takes 9-10 minutes to get to Zürich Hauptbahnhof from the Wallisellen railway station.\n\n\nThe largest sports club of Wallisellen is the FC Wallisellen (Football club Wallisellen), which first team in the season 06/07 was promoted to the 2. league. Other successful sports clubs are the EHC Wallisellen (Ice hockey club Wallisellen) and Faustball Wallisellen (Fistball Wallisellen). Also very active is the TV Wallisellen (Gymnastic club Wallisellen). That club has organised since 1993 the Walliseller Lauf (Run of Walisellen), from which all of the earnings go to children who are suffering from cancer. In Wallisellen there are two scout troops: scout troop Gryfensee and scout troop Winkelried.\n\nWallisellen is known in the German part of Switzerland due to a rhyme: \"Aazelle, Bölle schelle, d'Chatz gaht uf Walliselle, chunnt si wider hei, hät si chrummi Bei, piff paff puff und du bisch (ehr und redlich) duss\".\n\nA song of the Bernese dialect-band Stiller Has is \"Walliselle\".\n\nToday the native German-speaking population speaks a mixture of Swiss German dialects. A levelled Zurich-German with a tendency of integration of elements of German is widespread. Long-time residents recognise only in its pronunciation of the toponym Wallisellen with sharp \"s\".\n\n\n"}

(1271 – 4 July 1336; \"Elisabet\" in Catalan, \"Isabel\" in Aragonese, Portuguese and Spanish), was queen consort of Portugal, a tertiary of the Franciscan Order and is venerated as a saint of the Catholic Church.\n\nBorn in 1271 into the royal house of Aragon, Elizabeth was the daughter of \"Infante\" Peter (later King Peter III) and his wife Constance of Sicily and the sister of three kings: Alfonso II and James II of Aragon and Frederick III of Sicily. \n\nElizabeth showed an early enthusiasm for her faith. She said the full Divine Office daily, fasted and did other penance, as well as attended twice-daily choral Masses.\n\nHer marriage to King Denis of Portugal was arranged in 1281 when she was 10 years old, receiving the towns of Óbidos, Abrantes and Porto de Mós as part of her dowry. It was only in 1288 that the wedding was celebrated, when Denis was 26 years old, while Elizabeth was 17. Denis, a poet and statesman, was known as the \"Rei Lavrador\" (), because he planted a large pine forest near Leiria to prevent the soil degradation that threatened the region.\n\nElizabeth quietly pursued the regular religious practices of her youth and was devoted to the poor and sick. Such a life was taken as a reproach to many around her and caused ill will in some quarters. Eventually, her prayer and patience succeeded in converting her husband, who had been leading what she considered a sinful life.\n\nElizabeth took an active interest in Portuguese politics and was a decisive conciliator during the negotiations concerning the Treaty of Alcañices, signed by Denis and Fernando IV of Castile in 1297 (which fixed the borders between the two countries). In 1304, the Queen and Denis returned to Spain to arbitrate between Fernando IV of Castile and James II of Aragon, brother of Elizabeth.\n\nShe had two children:\n\nElizabeth would serve as intermediary between her husband and Afonso, during the Civil War between 1322 and 1324. The Infante greatly resented the king, whom he accused of favoring the king's illegitimate son, Afonso Sanches. Repulsed to Alenquer, which supported the Infante, Denis was prevented from killing his son through the intervention of the Queen. As legend holds, in 1323, Elizabeth, mounted on a mule, positioned herself between both opposing armies on the field of Alvalade in order to prevent the combat. Peace returned in 1324, once the illegitimate son was sent into exile, and the Infante swore loyalty to the king.\n\nAfter Denis' death in 1325, Elizabeth retired to the monastery of the Poor Clare nuns, now known as the Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha (which she had founded in 1314) in Coimbra. She joined the Third Order of St. Francis, devoting the rest of her life to the poor and sick in obscurity. During the great famine in 1293, she donated flour from her cellars to the starving in Coimbra. She was also known for being modest in her dress and humble in conversation, for providing lodging for pilgrims, distributing small gifts, paying the dowries of poor girls, and educating the children of poor nobles. She was a benefactor of various hospitals (Coimbra, Santarém and Leiria) and of religious projects (such as the Trinity Convent in Lisbon, chapels in Leiria and Óbidos, and the cloister in Alcobaça.\n\nShe was called to act once more as a peacemaker in 1336, when Afonso IV marched his troops against King Alfonso XI of Castile, to whom he had married his daughter Maria, and who had neglected and ill-treated her. In spite of age and weakness, the Queen-dowager insisted on hurrying to Estremoz, where the two kings' armies were drawn up. She again stopped the fighting and caused terms of peace to be arranged. But the exertion brought on her final illness. As soon as her mission was completed, she took to her bed with a fever from which she died on 4 July, in the castle of Estremoz. She earned the title of \"Peacemaker\" on account of her efficacy in solving disputes.\n\nAlthough Denis' tomb was located in Odivelas, Elizabeth was buried in the Convent of Santa Clara in Coimbra, in a magnificent Gothic sarcophagus. After frequent flooding by the Mondego River in the 17th century, the Poor Clares moved her mortal remains to the Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Nova (also in Coimbra). Her body was transferred to the main chapel, where it was buried in a sarcophagus of silver and crystal.\n\nShe was beatified in 1526 and canonized by Pope Urban VIII on 25 May 1625. Her feast was inserted in the General Roman Calendar for celebration on 4 July. In the year 1694 Pope Innocent XII moved her feast to 8 July, so it would not conflict with the celebration of the Octave of Saints Peter and Paul, Apostles. In 1955, Pope Pius XII abolished this octave. The 1962 Roman Missal changed the rank of the feast from \"Double\" to \"Third-Class Feast\". The 1969 revision of the Calendar classified the celebration as an optional memorial and restored it to 4 July. Her feast is also kept on the Franciscan Calendar of Saints. Since the establishment in 1819 of the Diocese of San Cristóbal de La Laguna (Canary Islands, Spain), Saint Elizabeth is the co-patron of the diocese and of its cathedral pursuant to the papal bull issued by Pope Pius VII.\nIn the United States her memorial has been transferred to 5 July since 4 July is the date of the independence of that nation, a national holiday.\n\nSt. Elizabeth is usually depicted in royal garb with a dove or an olive branch.\n\nShe was the subject of a 1947 Portuguese-Spanish film, \"The Holy Queen\", in which she was played by Maruchi Fresno. In Portuguese popular culture, she is commonly associated with a \"miracle of the roses\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1858534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858534", "title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor", "text": "Vascular endothelial growth factor\n\nVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), originally known as vascular permeability factor (VPF), is a signal protein produced by cells that stimulates the formation of blood vessels. To be specific, VEGF is a sub-family of growth factors, the platelet-derived growth factor family of cystine-knot growth factors. They are important signaling proteins involved in both vasculogenesis (the \"de novo\" formation of the embryonic circulatory system) and angiogenesis (the growth of blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature).\n\nIt is part of the system that restores the oxygen supply to tissues when blood circulation is inadequate such as in hypoxic conditions. Serum concentration of VEGF is high in bronchial asthma and diabetes mellitus.\nVEGF's normal function is to create new blood vessels during embryonic development, new blood vessels after injury, muscle following exercise, and new vessels (collateral circulation) to bypass blocked vessels.\nIt can contribute to disease. Solid cancers cannot grow beyond a limited size without an adequate blood supply; cancers that can express VEGF are able to grow and metastasize. Overexpression of VEGF can cause vascular disease in the retina of the eye and other parts of the body. Drugs such as aflibercept, bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and pegaptanib can inhibit VEGF and control or slow those diseases.\n\nIn 1970, Judah Folkman \"et al\". described a factor secreted by tumors causing angiogenisis and called it \"tumor angiogenesis factor\". In 1983 Senger \"et al.\" identified a \"vascular permeability factor\" secreted by tumors in guinea pigs and hamsters. In 1989 Ferrara and Henzel described an identical factor in bovine pituitary follicular cells which they purified, cloned and named VEGF. A similar VEGF alternative splicing was discovered by Tischer \"et al.\" in 1991. Between 1996 and 1997, Christinger and De Vos obtained the crystal structure of VEGF, first at 2.5 Å resolution and later at 1.9 Å.\n\nFms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (flt-1) was shown to be a VEGF receptor by Ferrara \"et al.\" in 1992. The kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) was shown to be a VEGF receptor by Terman \"et al.\" in 1992 as well. In 1998, neuropilin 1 and neuropilin 2 were shown to act as VEGF receptors.\n\nIn mammals, the VEGF family comprises five members: VEGF-A, placenta growth factor (PGF), VEGF-B, VEGF-C and VEGF-D. The latter members were discovered after VEGF-A; before their discovery, VEGF-A was known as VEGF. A number of VEGF-related proteins encoded by viruses (VEGF-E) and in the venom of some snakes (VEGF-F) have also been discovered.\n\nActivity of VEGF-A, as its name implies, has been studied mostly on cells of the vascular endothelium, although it does have effects on a number of other cell types (e.g., stimulation monocyte/macrophage migration, neurons, cancer cells, kidney epithelial cells). In vitro, VEGF-A has been shown to stimulate endothelial cell mitogenesis and cell migration. VEGF-A is also a vasodilator and increases microvascular permeability and was originally referred to as vascular permeability factor.\n\nThere are multiple isoforms of VEGF-A that result from alternative splicing of mRNA from a single, 8-exon \"VEGFA\" gene. These are classified into two groups which are referred to according to their terminal exon (exon 8) splice site: the proximal splice site (denoted VEGF) or distal splice site (VEGFb). In addition, alternate splicing of exon 6 and 7 alters their heparin-binding affinity and amino acid number (in humans: VEGF, VEGFb, VEGF, VEGF, VEGFb, VEGF, VEGF; the rodent orthologs of these proteins contain one fewer amino acids). These domains have important functional consequences for the VEGF splice variants, as the terminal (exon 8) splice site determines whether the proteins are pro-angiogenic (proximal splice site, expressed during angiogenesis) or anti-angiogenic (distal splice site, expressed in normal tissues). In addition, inclusion or exclusion of exons 6 and 7 mediate interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and neuropilin co-receptors on the cell surface, enhancing their ability to bind and activate the VEGF receptors (VEGFRs). Recently, VEGF-C has been shown to be an important inducer of neurogenesis in the murine subventricular zone, without exerting angiogenic effects.\n\nAll members of the VEGF family stimulate cellular responses by binding to tyrosine kinase receptors (the VEGFRs) on the cell surface, causing them to dimerize and become activated through transphosphorylation, although to different sites, times, and extents. The VEGF receptors have an extracellular portion consisting of 7 immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane spanning region, and an intracellular portion containing a split tyrosine-kinase domain. VEGF-A binds to VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1). VEGFR-2 appears to mediate almost all of the known cellular responses to VEGF. The function of VEGFR-1 is less well-defined, although it is thought to modulate VEGFR-2 signaling. Another function of VEGFR-1 may be to act as a dummy/decoy receptor, sequestering VEGF from VEGFR-2 binding (this appears to be particularly important during vasculogenesis in the embryo). VEGF-C and VEGF-D, but not VEGF-A, are ligands for a third receptor (VEGFR-3/Flt4), which mediates lymphangiogenesis. The receptor (VEGFR3) is the site of binding of main ligands (VEGFC and VEGFD), which mediates perpetual action and function of ligands on\ntarget cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor-C can stimulate lymphangiogenesis (via VEGFR3) and angiogenesis via VEGFR2. Vascular endothelial growth factor-R3 has been detected in lymphatic endothelial cells in CL of many species, cattle, buffalo and primate.\n\nIn addition to binding to VEGFRs, VEGF binds to receptor complexes consisting of both neuropilins and VEGFRs. This receptor complex has increased VEGF signalling activity in endothelial cells (blood vessels). Neuropilins (NRP) are pleitrophic receptors and therefore other molecules may interfere with the signalling of the NRP/VEGFR receptor complexes. For example, Class 3 semaphorins compete with VEGF for NRP binding and could therefore regulate VEGF-mediated angiogenesis.\n\nVEGF-A production can be induced in cell that is not receiving enough oxygen. When a cell is deficient in oxygen, it produces HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor, a transcription factor. HIF stimulates the release of VEGF-A, among other functions (including modulation of erythropoiesis). Circulating VEGF-A then binds to VEGF receptors on endothelial cells, triggering a tyrosine kinase pathway leading to angiogenesis. The expression of angiopoietin-2 in the absence of VEGF leads to endothelial cell death and vascular regression. Conversely, a German study done \"in vivo\" found that VEGF concentrations actually decreased after a 25% reduction in oxygen intake for 30 minutes. HIF1 alpha and HIF1 beta are constantly being produced but HIF1 alpha is highly O labile, so, in aerobic conditions, it is degraded. When the cell becomes hypoxic, HIF1 alpha persists and the HIF1alpha/beta complex stimulates VEGF release. the combined use of microvesicles and 5-FU resulted in enhanced chemosensitivity of squamous cell carcinoma cells more than the use of either 5-FU or microvesicle alone. In addition, down regulation of VEGF gene expression was associated with decreased CD1 gene expression\n\nVEGF-A and the corresponding receptors are rapidly up-regulated after traumatic injury of the central nervous system (CNS). VEGF-A is highly expressed in the acute and sub-acute stages of CNS injury, but the protein expression declines over time. This time-span of VEGF-A expression corresponds with the endogenous re-vascularization capacity after injury. This would suggest that VEGF-A / VEGF could be used as target to promote angiogenesis after traumatic CNS injuries. However, there are contradicting scientific reports about the effects of VEGF-A treatments in CNS injury models.\n\nVEGF-A has been implicated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. Numerous studies show a decreased overall survival and disease-free survival in those tumors overexpressing VEGF. The overexpression of VEGF-A may be an early step in the process of metastasis, a step that is involved in the \"angiogenic\" switch. Although VEGF-A has been correlated with poor survival, its exact mechanism of action in the progression of tumors remains unclear .\n\nVEGF-A is also released in rheumatoid arthritis in response to TNF-α, increasing endothelial permeability and swelling and also stimulating angiogenesis (formation of capillaries).\n\nVEGF-A is also important in diabetic retinopathy (DR). The microcirculatory problems in the retina of people with diabetes can cause retinal ischaemia, which results in the release of VEGF-A, and a switch in the balance of pro-angiogenic VEGF isoforms over the normally expressed VEGFb isoforms. VEGF may then cause the creation of new blood vessels in the retina and elsewhere in the eye, heralding changes that may threaten the sight.\n\nVEGF-A plays a role in the disease pathology of the wet form age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of blindness for the elderly of the industrialized world. The vascular pathology of AMD shares certain similarities with diabetic retinopathy, although the cause of disease and the typical source of neovascularization differs between the two diseases.\n\nVEGF-D serum levels are significantly elevated in patients with angiosarcoma.\n\nOnce released, VEGF-A may elicit several responses. It may cause a cell to survive, move, or further differentiate. Hence, VEGF is a potential target for the treatment of cancer. The first anti-VEGF drug, a monoclonal antibody named bevacizumab, was approved in 2004. Approximately 10–15% of patients benefit from bevacizumab therapy; however, biomarkers for bevacizumab efficacy are not yet known.\n\nCurrent studies show that VEGFs are not the only promoters of angiogenesis. In particular, FGF2 and HGF are potent angiogenic factors.\n\nPatients suffering from pulmonary emphysema have been found to have decreased levels of VEGF in the pulmonary arteries.\n\nVEGF-D has also been shown to be over expressed in lymphangioleiomyomatosis and is currently used as a diagnostic biomarker in the treatment of this rare disease .\n\nIn the kidney, increased expression of VEGF-A in glomeruli directly causes the glomerular hypertrophy that is associated with proteinuria.\n\nVEGF alterations can be predictive of early-onset pre-eclampsia.\n\nGene therapies for refractory angina establish expression of VEGF in epicardial cells to promote angiogenesis.\n\n\n"}

He became a feature attraction in America, competing in a distinctly western sport, long before it was adopted in Japan.\n\nSorakichi was born Koujiro Matsuda (Kanji: 松田幸次郎, Hiragana: まつだ こうじろう) in Japan. He trained and competed in sumo, under the sumo name Torakichi (荒竹光二郎). These names were later corrupted by American promoters and the sporting press into \"Matsada Korgaree Sorakichi,\" as he would be known in America for the rest of his life. To colleagues he was known as \"Mat\" or \"The Jap.\"\n\nMatsuda came to the United States in 1883 and had his first match in New York City on January 14, 1884. He lost to the Englishman Edwin Bibby. In March, 1884, Matsuda beat Bibby and then James Daley in New York City. Over the next few months he went on the road and wrestled in Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo, Rochester, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Chicago and Peoria. His opponents included Duncan C. Ross, Jack Gallagher, Benny Jones, Joe Acton, Carlos Martino, Andre Christol and Ted George.\n\nGreco-Roman Champion William Muldoon was Matsuda's most famous opponent. Muldoon beat Matsuda in Chicago on July 18, 1884. Matsuda returned to New York City in August, 1884, where he lived until June, 1885. While in New York City he beat James Quigley and Jack Herd, drew with Karl Abs and William Muldoon, and lost twice to Abs. In June 1885 he wrestled in Cleveland and Scranton, Pennsylvania in December.\n\nOn May 5, 1885 William Muldoon challenged Sorakichi to a handicap match, wagering $100 that he could pin the Japanese wrestler five times in one hour. Muldoon failed in his endeavor.\n\nDuring a February 15, 1886 match with Evan \"Strangler\" Lewis Sorakichi reportedly had his leg broken in a leg lock but was back in action one month later. In March, 1886, Matsuda lost to the British World Heavyweight Champion Tom Cannon in Cleveland and drew with the German World Heavyweight Champion Ernest Roeber in New York City. The match against Roeber took place at the Germania Assembly Roon, in the Bowery.\n\nMatsuda was on the road the rest of 1886, wrestling in Cleveland, Philadelphia, Ashland, Wisconsin and St. Louis. opponents included Duncan Ross, Joe Acton, Jack Carkeek, James Doner, James Faulkner and Bernarr MacFadden.\n\nDuring 1887, he wrestled in Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, Rio de Janeiro and Baltimore. In 1888 he toured Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Erie and Scranton) and also visited Lowell, Massachusetts. His opponents included Jesse Clark, Joe Acton, Jack Hart, Jim Connors, H.M. Dufar, Harvey Parker, William Muldoon, and John McMahon. In January and February, 1889 he wrestled August La Grange, William Muldoon and Ted George in Philadelphia. His last match was on May 13, 1891 against Martin \"Farmer\" Burns in Troy, New York.\n\nMatsuda tried, unsuccessfully, to bring American wrestling to Japan. On August 16, 1891, he died destitute in New York City at age 32. He is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.\n\nIn February, 1902, eleven years after his death, Jack Carkeek told the British sporting paper Mirror of Life that he held \"a high opinion of Sorakichi, the Jap, whom he considers to probably be the cleverest man in the world at his weight. The plucky little Jap has suffered numerous defeats simply because he has tackled all the best men of the day, no matter what their size or weight might be, and the good little ones must ever go down to big ones\".\n\nMatsuda's European American wife, complained that Matsuda and his friends squandered her inheritance and threatened her with violence when she complained. She also said that Matsuda kept his Japanese girlfriend at their home.\n\n"}

Being fans of early EBM music, Naghavi and Ruiz decided to follow in the footsteps of new wave/synthpop band Depeche Mode by using two keyboards and a beatbox. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic called their 1990 single, \"Metal Hammer\", a \"significant club hit\". The duo became a trio with the addition of Alex Two, prior to the release of their debut album, \"Anguish\" in 1991. That same year, they were honored as the Best New Artist in Germany.\n\nGoing into the release of \"Anguish\", they had already garnered a decent following through touring and appearances at various parties. With their debut release, they took home the Best New Artist award in Germany in 1991. Chris Ruiz left in 1992 (he would later return in 2001) while Steve Naghavi remained with the band. And One released three more albums with Machinery Records, \"Flop!\" (1992), \"Spot\" (1993) and \"I.S.T.\" (1994). The band left Machinery around 1996–1997 and signed to Virgin Schallplatten. And One would release four albums on this label between 1997 and 2003: \"Nordhausen\" (1997), \"9.9.99 9 Uhr\" (1998), \"Virgin Superstar\" (2000) and \"Aggressor\" (2003).\n\nThe next And One album, \"Bodypop\", was released on 1 September 2006 by Out of Line in Europe and on 7 November 2006 on Metropolis Records in the US.

His life and work both inside and outside the ring attracted great public interest in the late 19th century. In 1891 a book about the life of Carl Abs as a championship wrestler and a champion for the poor was published called \"Carl Abs, der Meisterschafts-Ringer der Welt: Sein Leben u. Wirken\" (\"Carl Abs, the wrestling Champion of the world: his life and work\").\n\nCarl Johann Theodor Abs was the son of Carl and Sophie Abs (née Jürgens) in Groß Godems, in the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. As the son of a Carpenter the younger Carl Abs learned his fathers craft and the intention was for his to succeed him in the business. Showing little interest in school Abs was more interested in farm work and through this discovered a keen interest in the environment. Later in his life his family moved to Hamburg. In Hamburg he began working in a factory in Langenstein. In 1873 he did his military service with the 76th Infantry Regiment. At the time military service was a three-year ordeal, but through devotion to duty and punctuality Abs had his service time shortened by two years. Following his discharge he began working at a wine shop and later became a coach driver. When business turned bad Abs lost his job and returned to Groß Godems, visiting his ill father before his father died. In 1877 he met Maria Augusta Katharina Warncke and married her later that year.\n\nIn 1880 Abs wrestled his first wrestling match, challenging \"Iron Wilhem\", the two wrestled to a draw in the first match and Abs won the rematch. Spurred by the fights Abs wanted to pursue a career in wrestling, which at the time was more of a side-show attraction than anything else. In 1881 he opened a gym in the basement of an art school. In 1882 he won a medal for his feats of strength. Due to his initial success he caught the attention of several German circus owners. Working with circus ringmaster Renz he toured German performing feats of strength as well as wrestle on occasion. After touring with the circus he returned to Hamburg where he wrestled against Mathias Sobien and Willy Henry. In 1885 worked for Circus Blumenthal, introducing the concept of professional wrestling to cities such as Karlsruhe. With professional wrestling still being more of a side show than anything else Abs decided to tour the United States, hoping to learn from American promotions and wrestlers to improve the wrestling scene in Germany. In the United States he defeated the Japanese wrestler Sorakichi Matsuda as well as Edwin Bibby. He even defeated the high ranking William Muldoon in a match. Upon his return to Germany he resumed working in the circus performing strongman acts but also wrestled in several cities, turning back the challenge of Gustav Bachmann and Frenchman Piere Rigal twice. Working for Circus d'hiver Abs toured in France, where he was actually billed as being from Denmark to not have to face any German/French tension that had been building, but the deception only lasted for a short while before his true background was revealed. On July 25, 1891 Carl Abs defeated Tom Cannon to win the European Greco-Roman Heavyweight Championship, one of the earliest recognized championships in wrestling. After wrestling in Germany he traveled to Vienna, Austria working for Circus Schumann as well as wrestling against local champion Cheri Robinet. The first meeting between the two ended in a draw. Later he fought French wrestler Masson, in a match where the referee ruled it a draw. In January 1893 Abs fought and defeated Antonio Pierri in Altona, Hamburg, but Pierri contested the loss, claiming that he was not thrown by Abs but merely slipped. The controversial ending led to a rematch between the two, which Pierri won, leading to a third and deciding match between the two. The match was originally scheduled for February 9, but had to be postponed when Pierri suffered a dislocated shoulder. When the two finally met on March 9, 1893 Abs threw his opponent and won the match in only 16 minutes.\n\nFollowing his victory over Pierrie Carl Abs gradually withdrew from the ring and focused more on weightlifting. He had his last match on December 26, 1894. In January 1895 he became ill with a liver and kidney disease, and dropsy. Abs died on February 18, 1895, in Hamburg after a month-long battle with the disease. At the time of his death his daughter was 17 years old and his son was 13. On February 22, 1895 he was buried in the Ohlsdorf cemetery in Hamburg.\n\nThe county of Groß Godems named a street after Carl Abs in 2002. The road connects a freight route to a new housing estate and bears Abs' name. Since 2008 project \"Diversity - absolutely fair\" has been active, a volunteer organization of youth workers who help train kids and teenagers for free, teaching them to socialize with other kids and adults but without having to pay a fee. This project awards a \"Carl Abs\" Cup each year.\n\n\n"}

It was the most disastrous in the race's history, with the loss of six lives and five yachts. 55 sailors were rescued in the largest peacetime search and rescue effort ever seen in Australia.\n\nThe Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race is an annual event hosted by the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia, starting in Sydney, New South Wales on Boxing Day then heading south through the Tasman Sea, past Bass Strait, into Storm Bay and up the Derwent River, to cross the finish line in Hobart, Tasmania. The race distance is approximately . \n\nThe race is run in co-operation with the Royal Yacht Club of Tasmania, and is widely considered to be one of the most difficult yacht races in the world.\n\nThe 1998 race, like every other edition, began on Sydney Harbour, at noon on Boxing Day (26 December 1998), with 115 starters heading south. The yachts ranged in size from the \"Sayonara\" to the \"Berrimilla\".\nA favourable current running south at 4 knots with strengthening north to north-easterly winds of generally 25-35 knots prevailing off the NSW southern coast allowed a record-breaking dash south down the Australian East Coast.

Of the 115 boats which started, 71 retired and 44 yachts completed the race.\n\nOn the 2nd day of the race (27 December) severe weather conditions struck the fleet off the south-eastern Australian coast. An unusually strong low pressure depression developed which resulted in unseasonal mid-summer snow across parts of south-east Australia. The weather system built into an exceptionally strong storm with winds in excess of 65 knots (+32.8 m/s, +118 km/h, +73 mph, Force 12) and gusts to 80 knots. The rising storm caused the sinking of five boats, seven were abandoned and 55 other sailors had to be rescued from their yachts by ships and helicopters. Overall, the rescue efforts involved 35 military and civilian aircraft and 27 Royal Australian Navy vessels, and proved to be Australia's largest ever peacetime rescue operation.\n\nThe six sailors who died were: Phillip Charles Skeggs (\"Business Post Naiad\", drowned, 27 December 1998); Bruce Raymond Guy (\"Business Post Naiad\", heart attack, 27 December 1998); John Dean, James Lawler and Michael Bannister (\"Winston Churchill\", all drowned, 28 December 1998); and Glyn Charles (\"Sword of Orion\", drowned, 27 December 1998).\n\nOn 1 June 1999 the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia released the \"Report, Findings and Recommendations of the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Race Review Committee\". The report listed a multitude of recommendations and resulted in changes both for future Sydney to Hobart races and yachting events worldwide.\n\nA coroner's inquest into the deaths was critical of both the race management at the time and the Bureau of Meteorology.\n\nThe results of the inquest were released on 12 December 2000, NSW coroner John Abernethy finding that the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia had \"abdicated its responsibility to manage the race\". He wrote: \"From what I have read and heard, it is clear to me that during this crucial time the race management team played the role of observers rather than managers and that was simply not good enough.\" But he acknowledged the club's actions to upgrade safety precautions and sailor qualifications.\n\nAbernethy also criticised the Bureau for making insufficient efforts to inform race officials of a dramatically upgraded weather forecast about the severe storm developing south of Eden, when it was common public knowledge the race was scheduled to begin. As a remedial measure, he required the Bureau to add maximum wind gust speed and wave height to its forecasts.\n\nThe day after the coroner's findings, the club's race director, Phil Thompson, resigned his position. According to the coroner's report, \"Mr Thompson's inability to appreciate the problems when they arose and his inability to appreciate them at the time of giving his evidence causes me concern that (he) may not appreciate such problems as they arise in the future.\"\n\n115 yachts registered to begin the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht race.

Falgalas (born Heiko Duus) joined the band in 1993, first for live touring, later as full member. Chris L. (born Christian Lorenz) joined in 1998, so far only for live performances. As of January 2018, three band members (Wagner, Falgalas and Chris L.) have teamed up to start a new band called Darkness on Demand, maintaining the DoD acronym and musical style. \n\nTheir first, eponymously titled, mini album was the initial release of Berlin-based label Machinery Records. Its title track became one of the most frequently played titles in Central and Northern Europe. As summarized by Zillo, \"in the 1990s [\"Dance or Die\"] formed the link between Gothic [rock] and Electro, and were a pioneer at that\". They continued their collaboration with Jor until the label's demise.\n\nIn 1997 they signed with Polydor, but after one album (\"Dehumanizer\") that partnership ended - clearly the dark electronic sound didn't fit in with \"Polydor\"'s dance-label \"What's Up?!\". On \"Dehumanizer\" the band was briefly joined by Norri as drummer.\n\n2001 they released their album \"Schlafende Energie\" on Synthetic Symphony in Germany. It was licensed to Energy Rekords in Sweden and Soyuz Music in Russia.\n\nAfter ten years, in 2011, they released their album \"Nostradamnation\" on Out of Line in Europe and Metropolis Records in North America.\n\nIn December 2014, Wagner released an album with a new project named \"Ruhestätte Schwarz\".\n\nIn 2015, Dance or Die were still described as a \"well-known Berlin cult Electro [band]\" by music magazine Sonic Seducer. Their music combines cold techno sounds with a deep voice (vocalist Gary Wagner even sings as guest on other artist's records, as on \"Take Some More\" by And One) and cyber-themed lyrics about life in the machine age. The albums were thus appropriately named, \"3001\" for the future, \"Psychoburbia\" taking psycho and burb together, while \"Dehumanizer\" seems to stand for itself. (Though it may have been named after the album of Black Sabbath, whose song \"Black Sabbath\" Dance or Die did cover on \"Psychoburbia\".) \"Schlafende Energie\" (literally: sleeping energy) is a term coined by German television series Raumpatrouille and means an energy reserve.\n\nDance or Die are members of a media collective called \"Clan of Nihil\". For some American versions of their records, they were renamed Do or Die by their label Machinery.\n\n\n\n\n"}

On April 20, 2019, J-Novel Club announced their license of \"Banner of the Stars\", along with their retranslated release of \"Crest of the Stars\". The novels include:\n\nThree years after the outbreak of hostilities between the Abh Empire and the Alliance, Lafiel becomes captain of the brand new assault ship Basroil and Jinto who has finished his training joins her crew as a supply officer. They are attached to the imperial fleet assigned to defend the strategically important Laptic Gate from a force 15 times larger than their own. And to make things more worrisome, not only is their commanding officer the younger sister of the third baron Febdash, the admiral of their fleet and his chief-of-staff are from the Bebaus family notoriously known for their \"Spectacular Insanity\". \n\nLafiel and Jinto are appointed ambassadors and given a mission to form a government on a newly conquered planet, which turns out to be a detention planet full of prisoners. Jinto is kidnapped during a rebellion and Lafiel is forced to withdraw due to the military actions of the enemy, leaving Jinto behind. Weeks later she returns to rescue him.\n\nThe main characters go to the Hyde star system (Jinto's home world and recently recovered imperial territory). On the way, Jinto encounters his friend Dorin Ku and is informed that a military war game will be held in the Hyde star system. Martine, the system's capital, refuses to surrender to the Abh Empire. Count Jinto negotiates with the Martinese government and seeks terms of surrender. At last, at the cost of the planet's autonomy and exile of the Count, Martine joins the Empire.\n\nThe main characters have returned to the Imperial fleet and Lafiel is now captain of a new ship, the assault frigate Flicaubh. Lafiel's younger brother Duhiel enlists in the navy and is dispatched to a battleship. The so far neutral Hania Federation unexpectedly offers to join the Abh Empire and Empress Ramaj accepts. While Jinto and Lafiel are returning to the Imperial capital, Lakfakalle, the Hania Federation fleet suddenly attack the Abh Empire and advances towards the capital.\n\nThe three enemy nations launch a surprise attack on Lakfakalle from Hania territory with help from sympathetic elements within the Hania military. Unable to recall the fleets in time to mount a defense, the empire prepares to abandon its capital for the first time in its history. The empress leads the small fleet available to meet the enemy in a desperate attempt to buy time for the civilians and crucial production structures to be evacuated. Meanwhile, Lafiel and Jinto are assigned to an old cruiser and tasked with transporting the Memorial Stones, markers etched with the name of every person who has ever died for the empire and important cultural artifacts. At the same time Duhiel is trapped behind enemy lines, and his superiors must get him back to Imperial territory.\n\n\nAmong fans, \"Banner of the Stars\" is a title used to describe all anime except \"Crest of the Stars\" (which Hiroyuki Morioka has said was not intended as the main idea of the story, but just an introduction to how Jinto and Lafiel met). Two TV series and an OVA have been released adapting the first three books:\n\nFM Osaka broadcast radio drama adaptations of \"Banner of the Stars\" novels and they were later released on CDs. The latest episode, \"Banner of the Stars IV\", was broadcast in 2006, but has not been released on a CD.\n\nManga adaptations of the \"Banner of the Stars\" and \"Banner of the Stars II\" anime series have been released by Dengeki Comics in October 2001 and July 2002, drawn by Toshihiro Ono and Wasoh Miyakoshi respectively. The manga were released in English by Tokyopop in 2004. These volumes were referred to by Tokyopop as the second and third parts of the \"Seikai Trilogy\". This was because at the time of publishing, only three anime series were adapted from Hiroyuki Morioka's works, and \"Banner of the Stars III\" was yet to be made. \"Crest of the Stars\" was considered the first part of the trilogy.\n\nThe \"Banner of the Stars\" series was adaptated into a Japanese video game for Windows. Named after the series, Gainax released \"Seikai no Senki\" on September 26, 2003. It is a member of the wargame genre, featuring interactions with some characters from the novel in-between the battles. A port for the PlayStation 2 console was released on April 21, 2005.\n\n"}
{"id": "1858592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858592", "title": "Les Châtiments", "text": "Les Châtiments\n\nLes Châtiments (\"Castigations\") is a collection of poems by Victor Hugo that fiercely attack Napoléon III's Second Empire.\n\nLouis-Napoléon had previously made unsuccessful attempts to gain power, leading to his exile in London. His final attempt resulted in a \"coup d'état\" on 2 December 1851. French guards opened fire on a group of protesters, causing several deaths. This did little to help achieve the reputation that Louis-Napoléon had hoped for. In addition to this, he proceeded to change the constitutional laws governing the length of time that an emperor could rule.\n\nHugo's sympathies lay with the working classes, and he was appalled by what he saw as a willingness to kill in order to gain power. Viewed as the voice of the masses in France, Hugo used his substantial influence to gather support against Louis-Napoléon. His contempt was best illustrated in a speech delivered to the Académie française, where he declared, \"Quoi? Après Augustus, nous avons Augustule!\" This is a reference to the Roman emperor Augustus, and the suffix \"-ule\" derives from a Latin diminutive, indicating an object or person that is smaller in stature. This deliberately antagonistic declaration encapsulates Hugo's view: Louis-Napoléon was far removed from the great military leader that his uncle, Napoleon Bonaparte, had been.\n\nIn addition, Louis-Napoléon's legitimacy was also brought into question. Rumours abounded (although none was ever proven) that he was an illegitimate child — a product of one of his mother's numerous affairs — and therefore could claim no right to his title. Hugo seizes on this in an attempt to discredit his position and title.\n\nHis vociferous condemnation of Louis-Napoléon as a traitor, usurper and dictator put Hugo and his family in danger . Realising this, Hugo fled his beloved France, vowing never to return until a new order was installed. After stopping in Brussels and then Jersey, Hugo settled with his family in Guernsey and remained there until 1870. Despite the distance from his readership, Hugo's influence remained strong and the years in exile produced a flurry of literary activity.\n\nWritten in 1853, \"Les Châtiments\" is arguably Hugo's most scathing work, including \"Les Égouts\" (\"The sewers\"), which contrasts the lives of the poor whom Hugo claims Louis-Napoléon ignored with the pompous grandeur to which the emperor aspired. Even the editor of the collection claimed that Hugo had gone too far with his vehement criticisms of the Second Empire. However, even if Hugo's comments did exaggerate the failings of Louis-Napoléon's regime, they present a strong critique of a society bound by censorship of the press and the arts.\n\nHugo resorts to extreme measures to portray Louis-Napoléon as ruler with much blood on his hands, and \"Les Châtiments\" is littered with references to corrupt and flawed historical figures. Some better known than others, they all gained notoriety for their corrupt and cruel natures. A device particularly favoured by Hugo is the comparison to Roman emperors, such as Caligula, Claudius and Julius Caesar. Allusions to the Bible include Judas Iscariot, Barabbas and Cain. Others include European leaders and French criminals who were well known in their days.\n\nNot satisfied with evil despots and tyrants, Hugo also turns to animalistic imagery as a means of implying that Louis-Napoléon is less than human. References to snakes, crocodiles, worms, bees, wasps and spiders can be found.\n\nHugo reserves the \"vous\" form of address for Napoleon Bonaparte. Along with being the polite form of address in French, it also denotes respect for someone in a higher position of power. The \"tu\" is used in a disparaging way for Louis-Napoléon. It would be unthinkable that anybody should address the Emperor of the French in such a way. This form of address may denote familiarity between friends, but this is not Hugo's intention and it is used purely to belittle a futile leader.\n\nIt is said that Napoleon III read the work thoroughly and kept a copy by his bedside. He is said to have been so devastated by Hugo's vicious condemnation that he never fully recovered from the shock of his first reading. There was even an attempt to reconcile with Hugo, with Louis-Napoléon publicly extending an invitation for Hugo to return to France.\n\nOne could equally argue that the failings of that same regime would indeed be difficult to exaggerate in terms of the time in which Hugo lived. This is very important to keep in mind: while Napoleon III, who was influenced by Saint-Simonianism, was no Hitler, and some of his policies are recognized as liberal, Hugo was a much-needed voice for continued social change in an impoverished, 19th-century France.\n\n\"L'Expiation\", about the Battle of Waterloo, is parodied in Asterix in Belgium when Caesar fights a battle against the Belgians resembling the Battle of Waterloo. The actions on the battlefield are accompanied by verses which parody this poem.\n\n\"Les Châtiments\" has never been out of print and is still studied in universities today. \n"}

The film was written for the screen by\nRichard Levinson, William Link and by Lamont Johnson who was the director, the film stars Martin Sheen, and also features Charlie Sheen in his second film in a small role.\n\nThe book and the film tell the story of Private Eddie Slovik, the only American soldier to be executed for desertion since the American Civil War. The film starred Martin Sheen as Private Slovik, a performance for which he received an Emmy Award nomination for Best Lead Actor in a Drama. Sheen said he did not think actors should be compared, and made it clear he would refuse the award. Many critics and viewers consider this to be one of Sheen's finest performances. Among the other Emmy Award nominations, the film was named for \"Outstanding Special\". The film also won a Peabody Award.\n\nIn 1960 Frank Sinatra announced that he would produce a film adaptation of \"The Execution of Private Slovik\", with the screenplay to be written by Albert Maltz, who was one of the Hollywood 10 blacklisted after they refused to testify to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in the McCarthy era. This announcement evoked tremendous outrage, with Sinatra accused of being a Communist sympathizer. As Sinatra was campaigning for John F. Kennedy for President, the Kennedy campaign became concerned and ultimately prevailed upon Sinatra to cancel the project.\n\nIn 1949, a Pentagon source revealed to Huie a European graveyard containing the remains of unidentified American soldiers. Huie's investigation identified Slovik's name and grave. Huie's account of Slovik is an example of his style of reporting and his tendency to anger Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had authorized the execution as commander of the Allied Forces, and who tried to stop publication of the book. Award-winning filmmaker Richard Dubelman acquired the film rights from Sinatra. Some years later, Dubelman persuaded Universal Studios to help him produce it as a television movie.\n\nTelevision critic Matt Zoller Seitz in his 2016 book co-written with Alan Sepinwall titled \"\" named \"The Execution of Private Slovik\" as the third greatest American TV-movie of all time, behind \"Duel\" (1971) and \"The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom\" (1993). Seitz praised Martin Sheen's performance as \"one of his finest\" and stated that the film is \"as close to a perfect character study as network TV has produced, quietly outraged yet somehow resolutely unsentimental\".\n\nThe military service record of Slovik, which is now a public archival record available from the Military Personnel Records Center, provides a detailed account of his actual execution. It was upon this that most of the film was based. The execution in the film, including the missed shots by the firing squad which led to Slovik dying slowly on the firing post over a course of five minutes, are accurate as compared to the actual execution. A slight dramatic license does occur in the final scene, as there is no evidence that the priest attending Slovik's execution shouted \"give it another volley if you like it so much\" after the doctor indicated Slovik was still alive.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1858609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858609", "title": "Medieval hunting", "text": "Medieval hunting\n\nThroughout Western Europe in the Middle Ages, humans hunted wild animals. While game was at times an important source of food, it was rarely the principal source of nutrition. Hunting was engaged by all classes, but by the High Middle Ages, the necessity of hunting was transformed into a stylized pastime of the aristocracy. More than a pastime, it was an important arena for social interaction, essential training for war, and a privilege and measurement of nobility.\n\nHieratic formalized recreational hunting has been taking place since Assyrian kings hunted lions from chariots in a demonstration of their royal nature. In Roman law, property included the right to hunt, a concept which continued under the Frankish Merovingian and Carolingian monarchs who considered the entire kingdom to be their property, but who also controlled enormous royal domains as hunting reserves (\"forests\"). The biography of the Merovingian noble Saint Hubert (died 727/728) recounts how hunting could become an obsession. Carolingian Charlemagne loved to hunt and did so up until his death at age seventy-two.\n\nWith the breakup of the Carolingian Empire, local lords strove to maintain and monopolize the reserves and the taking of big game in forest reserves, and small game in warrens. They were most successful in England after the Norman Conquest, and in Gascony from the 12th century. These were large sanctuaries of woodland—the royal forest—where populations of game animals were kept and watched over by gamekeepers. Here the peasantry could not hunt, poaching being subject to severe punishment: the injustice of such \"emparked\" preserves was a common cause of complaint in populist vernacular literature. The lower classes mostly had to content themselves with snaring birds and smaller game outside of forest reserves and warrens.\n\nBy the 16th century, areas of land reserved for breeding and hunting of game were of three kinds, according to their degree of enclosure and being subject to Forest Laws: \"Forests\", large unenclosed areas of wilderness, \"Chases\", which normally belonged to nobles, rather than the crown, and \"Parks\", which were enclosed, and not subject to Forest Laws.\n\nOne of the striking things about Medieval Hunting is its devotion to terminology. All aspects of the hunt - each different animal to be hunted, in each year of its development, each of its body parts, each stage of the chase, each feature of the hounds' behaviour - had its separate term. Knowledge and (partly whimsical) extension of this terminology became a courtly fashion in the 14th century in France and England.\n\nMedieval books of hunting lay huge stress on the importance of correct terminology, a tradition which was further extended to great lengths in the Renaissance period.\n\nThe invention of the 'fair terms' of hunting was attributed by Malory and others to the Arthurian knight Sir Tristram, who is seen both as the model of the noble huntsman, and the originator of its ritual:\nAs he (Sir Tristram) grew in power and strength he laboured in hunting and hawking - never a gentleman that we ever heard of did more. And as the book says he devised good fanfares to blow for beasts of venery, and beasts of the chase and all kinds of vermin, and all the terms we still have in hawking and hunting. And therefore the book of venery, of hawking and hunting, is called Sir Tristram's. Therefore all gentlemen who bear old (\"coats of\") arms ought to honour Sir Tristram for the goodly terms that gentlemen have and use, and shall until Doomsday, that through them all men of respect may distinguish a gentleman from a yeoman and a yeoman from a villein. (\"Modernised\")\nEnglish and French accounts agree on the general makeup of a hunt—they were well-planned so that everyone knew his role before going out. The hunt \"par force\" required each participant to have a specific role. If someone slipped in his role, not only could he easily get lost, but it put the rest of the group in danger by exposure. Many nobles hunted \"par force\", for a multitude of reasons, but above all because it was considered the purest and noblest form of hunting. The ritual of the hunt was meant to heighten danger within a controlled context. Gaston, Duke of Orleans, argued against hunters taking game in more efficient ways such as by bow and arrow or by setting traps, saying, \"I speak of this against my will, for I should only teach how to take beasts nobly and gently\" (\"mes de ce parle je mal voulentiers, quar je ne devroye enseigner a prendre les bestes si n'est par noblesce et gentillesce\"). Hunters like Gaston hunted not to kill the largest game, but rather for the process of the hunt, preferring ritual over efficiency. This mode of hunting was also important in the upbringing of noble youths. Boys at the age of 7 or 8 years began to learn how to handle a horse, travel with a company in forests, and utilize a weapon, practicing these skills in hunting groups. As a result, young men in the nobility and royalty were able to transfer acquired skills such as horsemanship, weapons management, wood-crafting, terrain assessment, and strategy formation from the hunting grounds to the battlefield in wars. Hunting also cultivated their education, and taught them the importance of ritual and noble acts.\n\nThe weapons used for hunting would mostly be the same as those used for war: bow, crossbow, lance or spear, knife and sword. Bows were the most commonly used weapon. Although the crossbow was introduced around the time of the First Crusade (1100), it was not generally used for hunting until the second half of the 15th century. Cudgels (clubs) were used for clubbing small game in particular by women who joined the hunt. \"Boar spears\" were also used. With the introduction of handheld firearms to hunting in the 16th century, traditional medieval hunting was transformed.\n\nThe hunter would also need a horn for communication with the other hunters. In addition to this the hunter depended on the assistance of certain domesticated animals. Three animals in particular were essential tools for the medieval hunter: the horse, the hound and the hawk or falcon.\n\nThe horse was the most important animal of the great medieval household. The stables, also called the \"marshalsea,\" would be separate from the rest of the household, and its head officer—the marshal—would be one of the household's senior officers. The marshal would have pages and grooms serving under him to care for the horses.\n\nA large household would have a wide array of horses for different purposes. There were cart- and packhorses employed in the day-to-day work of the household, palfreys used for human transport, and destriers, or warhorses, a powerful and expensive animal that in late medieval England could obtain prices of up to £80. Although it had the necessary qualities, the destrier would not be used for hunting, due to its value. Instead, a special breed called a courser would be used. The courser, though inferior to the destrier and much smaller than today's horses, still had to be powerful enough to carry the rider at high speeds over large distances, agile, so it could maneuver difficult terrain without difficulty, and fearless enough not to be scared when encountering wild beasts.\n\nThe dog was essential for several purposes. Its good sense of smell made it invaluable in finding the quarry. It would then assist in driving the hunted animal and, when the animal was finally at bay, the dog would either be the instrument of attack, or distract the quarry while the hunter moved in for the kill. Different breeds would be used for different tasks, and for different sorts of game, and while some of these breeds are recognizable to us today, the dogs were nevertheless somewhat different from modern breeds.\n\nForemost among the hunting breeds was the greyhound. This breed was valued first and foremost for its speed, but also for its ability to attack and take down the game. Since the greyhound did not have much stamina, it was essential that it be not released before the quarry was in sight, toward the end of the hunt. Furthermore, greyhounds, though aggressive hunters, were valued for their docile temper at home, and often allowed inside as pets.\n\nThe alaunt, or alant, was a somewhat more robust animal than the greyhound, and therefore used against larger game, such as bears or boars. The alaunt was considered a reckless animal, and had been known to attack domestic animals, or even its owner. The mastiff was an even more rugged breed, and though also used on the larger game, was mostly considered useful as a guard-dog.\n\nWhat all these dogs lacked was the ability to follow the scent of the quarry, and run it down. For this purpose the running-hound was used. The running-hound was somewhat similar to today's foxhound. This dog had, as the name indicates, excellent stamina, as well as a good nose. Another dog valued for its scenting skills was the lymer, a forerunner of today's bloodhound. Handled on a long leash, the lymer would be used to find the lay of the game before the hunt even started, and it was therefore important that, in addition to having a good nose, it remained quiet. Silence in the lymer was achieved through a combination of breeding and training. Other dogs used for hunting were the kennet (a small hunting dog, from ONF 'kenet', a diminutive of 'chien'), the terrier, the harrier and the spaniel.\n\nThe hounds were kept in a kennel, inside or separate from the main domicile. Here the dogs would have oak beds to sleep on, and often also a second level where the dogs could go when the ground level became too hot or too cold. Outside the kennel there would be grass for the dogs to eat whenever they had digestive problems. To care for the dogs would be a hierarchy of servants such as pages, varlets, aides and veneurs; the page being the lowest, often a young boy. Pages would often sleep in the kennels with the dogs, to keep them from fighting and care for them if they got sick. Though this might seem harsh by modern standards, the warm dog house could often be much more comfortable than the sleeping quarters of other medieval servants.\n\nMedieval terminology spoke of hawks of the tower and hawks of the fist, which roughly corresponds to falcons and hawks, respectively. The female hawk was preferred, since it was both larger than the male and easier to train. A male saker falcon is approximately two thirds of the weight of a female; falconers call male peregrines \"tiercels\", derived from the Latin word for \"third\". Hawks were captured all over Europe, but birds from Norway or Iceland were considered of particularly good quality.\n\nFalconry, a common activity in the Middle Ages, was the training of falcons and hawks for personal usage, which included hunting game. Falcons and hawks have different physical makeups which affects their mode of hunting. Ducks, herons, and cranes were the common game hunted by falcons and hawks. The main differences between the two species of birds lies in their wings and tails. Falcons have long, narrow wings with a long tapered tail. As a result, they fly at incredibly high levels. To kill game, they elevate high up in the sky and then dive at their target. Their dives can go up to 200 mph. They utilized their talons on the downward dive to slash game. Usually their strikes kill the game with the first slash. Hawks, however, have shorter, rounder wings and longer tails. They glide along at lower altitudes. To kill their game, they glide toward their target and then use a burst of speed to close in. They utilize their talons to dig in and clutch onto their game until it is dead. As a result of their makeups, falcons and hawks were utilized by owners for different terrains. Falcons were used in open fields while hawks were used in marshlands and woodland.\n\nTraining a hawk was a painstaking process. It was normal at first to \"seel\" the bird's eyelids—sew them shut—so that it would not be scared or distracted. The trainer would then carry the hawk on his arm for several days, to get it accustomed to human presence. The eyes would gradually be unseeled, and the training would begin. The bird would be encouraged to fly from its perch to the falconer's hand over a gradually longer distance. Hunting game would be encouraged first by the use of meat, then a lure, and eventually live prey. Such prey included herons, sometime with their legs broken to facilitate the kill.\n\nHawks would be housed in mews, a special edifice found in most large medieval households, mostly a certain distance from the main domicile, so that the hawks would not be disturbed. The mews could be rather elaborate structures. There would be windows in the wall, and the ground would be kept clean so that the bird's regurgitations could be found and analyzed.\n\nAmong the species used were:\n\nOf all the falcons, the gyrfalcon was considered the best one. They were thought of the highest quality when white ones were imported from Greenland. King Frederick II of England considered them the best \"out of respect to their size, strength, audacity, and swiftness\". Of the hawks, the goshawk was the most highly valued. They were more expensive and brought in more money for training. Goshawks from Scandinavia in particular were highly sought after.\n\nMost of the larger, wild mammals could be hunted. Different animals were valued for different qualities; both in the hunt itself, and in the meat and the fur they produced.\n\nThe king of all the wild animals was the deer, and more precisely the hart, which is an adult male of the red deer. The hart was classified by the number of tines, or points, on its antlers. An animal should have at least ten tines to be considered worthy of hunting; this was referred to as a \"hart of ten.\" Deer could be hunted in two different ways: \"par force\" (\"by strength\" and thereunder \"par force de chiens\" (\"by force of dogs\" )), and bow and stable.\n\nHunting \"par force\" was considered the noblest form of hunting. In this process the game was run down and exhausted by the dogs before the kill was made. \"Par force\" hunting consisted of eight parts: the quest, the assembly, the relays, the moving or un-harboring, the chase, the baying, the unmaking and the \"curée\".\n\n\nHunting \"by bow and stable\" had less prestige, but could produce greater results. The quarry, often a whole herd, would be driven by hounds to a predetermined place. Here archers would be ready to kill the animals with bow and arrow. The subtlest form of hunting, and also the most productive relative to the forces used, was described by the German knight Guicennas. This was a party of two or three men on foot advancing slowly and quietly with partial concealment from horses (literal 'stalking horses' - because deer are relatively unalarmed by quadrupeds), so as to induce the deer to move without undue alarm into range of concealed archers. This required patience, a low profile attitude, and a deep appreciation of animal psychology.\n\nThe hart was a highly respected animal, and had great symbolic and mythological significance. It was often compared to Christ for its suffering; a well-known story tells of how St. Eustace was converted to Christianity by seeing a crucifix between the antlers of a stag while hunting. A similar story is attributed to St. Hubert. Other stories told of how the hart could become several hundred years old, and how a bone in the middle of its heart prevented it from dying of fear.\n\nUnlike the Romans for whom hunting boar was considered a simple pastime, the hunting of boars in Medieval Europe was mostly done by nobles for the purpose of honing martial skill. It was traditional for the noble to dismount his horse once the boar was cornered and to finish it with a dagger. To increase the challenge, some hunters would commence their sport at the mating season, when the animals were more aggressive. Records show that wild boar were abundant in medieval Europe; this is correlated by documents from noble families and the clergy demanding tribute from commoners in the form of boar carcasses or body parts. In 1015 for example, the Doge Ottone Orseolo demanded for himself and his successors the head and feet of every boar killed in his area of influence. The boar was a highly dangerous animal to hunt; it would fight ferociously when under attack, and could easily kill a dog, a horse, or a man. It was hunted \"par force\", and when at bay, a hound like a mastiff could perhaps be foolhardy enough to attack it, but ideally it should be killed by a rider with a spear. The boar was sometimes considered a malicious animal, and even had satanic associations. It was also respected for its tenacity and appears frequently as a heraldic charge.\n\nWolves were mainly hunted for their skins, to protect livestock, and in some rare cases to protect humans. Pelts were the only considered practical use for wolves, and were usually made into cloaks or mittens, though not without hesitation, due to the wolf's foul odour. There were generally no restrictions or penalties in the civilian hunting of wolves, except in royal game reserves, under the reasoning that the temptation for an intruding commoner to shoot a deer there was too great. In 9th-century France, Charlemagne founded an elite corps of crown-funded officials called \"Luparii\", whose purpose was to control wolf populations in France during the Middle Ages. In England of 950, King Athelstan imposed an annual tribute of 300 wolf skins on Welsh king Hywel Dda, an imposition which was maintained until the Norman conquest of England. The Norman kings (reigning from 1066 to 1152 AD) employed servants as wolf hunters and many held lands granted on condition they fulfilled this duty. King Edward I, who reigned from 1272 to 1307, ordered the total extermination of all wolves in the counties of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Shropshire and Staffordshire, where wolves were more common than in the southern areas of England. James I of Scotland passed a law in 1427 requiring 3 wolf hunts a year between 25 April and 1 August, coinciding with the wolf's cubbing season. The wolf became extinct in England during the reign of Henry VII (1485–1509). Before its extinction in the British Isles, the wolf was considered by the English nobility as one of the five so called \"Royal Beasts of the Chase\".\n\nHunting of bears, especially on the Iberian Peninsula, was popular because of the animal's stamina and strength, and the danger of the hunt. Hunting the agile hare using greyhounds or hounds was a popular pastime; though opinions differed as to the edibility of the hare itself.\n\nSome animals were considered inedible, but still hunted for the sport. Foremost among these was the fox, well known for its cunning. Other inedibles were the otter and the badger. Curiously enough, medieval writings on hunting often carried detailed instructions on how to hunt a unicorn. Notoriously evasive, the unicorn could only be captured if enticed to fall asleep in the lap of a virgin.\n\nThe royal forest was an area of land designated to the king for hunting and forestry; it included woodland, heathland, and agricultural land. As of the 12th century nearly a third of England's territory was assigned as royal forest. Only the king and other permitted members of the nobility were allowed to hunt game in the assigned area. To maintain this restriction, forest law was introduced to enforce the boundaries. Special officials known as foresters were in charge of overseeing forest law. The foresters were among the most hated of royal officials as they were often corrupt, having a reputation for making illegal side profits on royal forest property by farming, extracting natural resources, and poaching game. They exacted many punishments for poaching game, farming, and other illegal activities on the royal forest. Heavy fines and imprisonment were the common discipline. While foresters were in charge of the upkeep of forest law, sometimes the king would employ the local sheriff to get involved. Hunting, however, was not the only function for the royal forest. Kings would also use these territories for cattle upbringing, farming, and extracting the land's resources. They also notably served as reserves for all kinds of wildlife. King Henry I of England was known for having a fascination with pet animals. His parks included wild animals like lions and leopards. Forest laws in regards to hunting created class distinctions. King Richard II of England issued the first game law in 1390. It constituted a property requirement of certain value to have hunting dogs or other hunting equipment.\n\nPoaching was a common offense in the Middle Ages. It was an act that was engaged by all of society and was widely tolerated by it. All kinds of poachers engaged in this illegal act, but sometimes it was a highly organized activity. Poachers worked together in rings to accomplish their goals. They would poach game off royal forest property and sell it to commoners for a profit. Sometimes, these rings worked for other lords and even monks to supply them. The lords and monks in turn would either keep the game for their own consumption or sell it in the common marketplace for a profit. Game would not be the only item poached from royal forests. Many sought after its resources with wood in particular a highly sought commodity. Often the arresting of poachers did not end cleanly. Poachers would resist arrest, sometimes resorting to assaulting and shooting foresters to escape. There is a recorded instance of St Thomas Becket performing a miracle by healing a forester shot in the throat by poachers. Sometimes the nobility would engage in poaching by either taking more game than permitted or by hunting in a restricted area.\n\nLike everything else in the Middle Ages, hunting was full of symbolism. Religious symbolism was common; the hart or the unicorn was often associated with Christ, but the hunt itself could equally be seen as the Christian's quest for truth and salvation. In the more secular literature, romances for instance, the hunter pursuing his quarry was often used as a symbol of the knight's struggle for his lady's favor.\n\nHagiography, notably the lives of Saint Eustace, Saint Hubert and Saint Julian provided many opportunities for medieval artists to express hunting in illuminated manuscripts and stained glass. The \"minor arts\" such as wooden chests, tapestries and wall paintings also depict such scenes. In the 14th and 15th centuries the most detailed hunting images are found in illuminated manuscripts.\n\nHunting could be extremely dangerous and serious injuries and deaths among the hunters were not uncommon. Even kings and emperors were not immune to hunting accidents. Those killed while hunting include:\n\nHunting was a subject considered worthy of the attention of the greatest of men, and several prominent peers, kings and emperors wrote books on the topic. Among the best known sources for medieval hunting we have today, by nobles or others, are:\n\n\n\n"}

Before reaching the CMC, the surface tension changes strongly with the concentration of the surfactant. After reaching the CMC, the surface tension remains relatively constant or changes with a lower slope. The value of the CMC for a given dispersant in a given medium depends on temperature, pressure, and (sometimes strongly) on the presence and concentration of other surface active substances and electrolytes. Micelles only form above critical micelle temperature.\n\nFor example, the value of CMC for sodium dodecyl sulfate in water (no other additives or salts) at 25 °C, atmospheric pressure, is 8x10 mol/L.\n\nUpon introduction of surfactants (or any surface active materials) into the system, they will initially partition into the interface, reducing the system free energy by:\n\n\nSubsequently, when the surface coverage by the surfactants increases, the surface free energy (surface tension) decreases and the surfactants start aggregating into micelles, thus again decreasing the system's free energy by decreasing the contact area of hydrophobic parts of the surfactant with water. Upon reaching CMC, any further addition of surfactants will just increase the number of micelles (in the ideal case).\n\nThere are several theoretical definitions of CMC. One well-known definition is that CMC is the total concentration of surfactants under the conditions:\n\nThe CMC generally depends on the method of measuring the samples, since \"a\" and \"b\" depend on the properties of the solution such as conductance and photochemical characteristics. When the degree of aggregation is monodisperse, then the CMC is not related to the method of measurement. On the other hand, when the degree of aggregation is polydisperse, then CMC is related to both the method of measurement and the dispersion.\n\nThe common procedure to determine the CMC from experimental data is to look for the intersection of two straight lines traced through plots of the measured property versus the surfactant concentration. This visual data analysis method is highly subjective and can lead to very different CMC values depending on the type of representation, the quality of the data and the chosen interval around the CMC. A preferred method is the fit of the experimental data with a model of the measured property. Fit functions for properties such as electrical conductivity, surface tension, NMR chemical shifts, absorption, self-diffusion coefficients, fluorescence intensity and mean translational diffusion coefficient of fluorescent dyes in surfactant solutions have been presented. These fit functions are based on a model for the concentrations of monomeric and micellised surfactants in solution, which establishes a well-defined analytical definition of the CMC, independent from the technique.\n\nThe CMC is the concentration of surfactants in the bulk at which micelles start forming. The word \"bulk\" is important because surfactants partition between the bulk and interface and CMC is independent of interface and is therefore a characteristic of the surfactant molecule. In most situations, such as surface tension measurements or conductivity measurements, the amount of surfactant at the interface is negligible compared to that in the bulk and CMC can be approximated by the total concentration.\n\nThere are important situations where interfacial areas are large and the amount of surfactant at the interface cannot be neglected. For example, if we take a solution of a surfactant above CMC and start introducing air bubbles at the bottom of the solution, these bubbles, as they rise to the surface, pull out the surfactants from the bulk to the top of the solution creating a foam column thus bringing down the concentration in bulk to below CMC. This is one of the easiest methods to remove surfactants from effluents (foam flotation). Thus in foams with sufficient interfacial area there will not be any micelles. Similar reasoning holds for emulsions.\n\nThe other situation arises in detergents. One initially starts off with concentrations greater than CMC in water and on adding fabric with large interfacial area and waiting for equilibrium, the surfactant concentration goes below CMC and no micelles are left. Therefore, the solubilization plays a minor role in detergents. Removal of oily soil occurs by modification of the contact angles and release of oil in the form of emulsion.\n\nIn petroleum industry, CMC is considered prior to injecting surfactant in reservoir regarding enhanced oil recovery (EOR) application. Below the CMC point, interfacial tension between oil and water phase is no longer effectively reduced. So, it is redundant to add more surfactant since it does not work well. Hence, it is better to use surfactant a little bit higher than CMC. This little additional value is to cover the dissolution with existing brine in reservoir. It is desired that the surfactant will work at the lowest interfacial tension (IFT).\n\nThere is increasing interest in simulating micelles for industrial applications. The reliability of some experimental data has been questioned by some authors who have proposed standard data sets. Attempts have also been made to use machine learning and other statistical models to predict CMC. Some of these statistical prediction attempts have also curated data sets from literature..\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1858623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858623", "title": "Ecohydrology", "text": "Ecohydrology\n\nEcohydrology (from Greek , \"oikos\", \"house(hold)\"; , \"hydōr\", \"water\"; and , \"-logia\") is an interdisciplinary scientific field studying the interactions between water and ecological systems. It is considered a sub discipline of hydrology, with an ecological focus. These interactions may take place within water bodies, such as rivers and lakes, or on land, in forests, deserts, and other terrestrial ecosystems. Areas of research in ecohydrology include transpiration and plant water use, adaption of organisms to their water environment, influence of vegetation and benthic plants on stream flow and function, and feedbacks between ecological processes and the hydrological cycle.\n\nThe hydrologic cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface on the earth. This flow is altered by ecosystems at numerous points. Transpiration from plants provides the majority of flow of water to the atmosphere. Water is influenced by vegetative cover as it flows over the land surface, while river channels can be shaped by the vegetation within them. Ecohydrology was developed under the International Hydrological Program of UNESCO.\n\nEcohydrologists study both terrestrial and aquatic systems. In terrestrial ecosystems (such as forests, deserts, and savannas), the interactions among vegetation, the land surface, the vadose zone, and the groundwater are the main focus. In aquatic ecosystems (such as rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands), emphasis is placed on how water chemistry, geomorphology, and hydrology affect their structure and function.\n\nThe general assumptions of ecological hydrology is to decrease ecosystem degradation using concepts that integrate terrestrial and aquatic processes across scales. The principles of Ecohydrology are expressed in three sequential components:\n\nTheir expression as testable hypotheses (Zalewski et al., 1997) may be seen as:\n\nThe ecological hydrology in a specific system can be assessed by answering a few basic questions (Abbott et al., 2016). Where does the water come from and where does it go? This is defined as the flowpath taken by the water entering the watershed being assessed. How long does the water stay in a specific flux or pool of water? This is defined as residence time, in which the rate the water enters, exits, or is stored can be observed. What reactions and changes does the water undergo through those processes? This is defined as biogeochemical reactions, which have the potential to change the solutes, nutrients, or compounds in the water. Many methods are used to observe and test watersheds for the answers to these questions. Namely, hydrographs, environmental and injected tracers, or equations such as Darcy's Law. These three factors are interactive and interdependent. The connectivity of a watershed often defines how these traits will interact. As seasonal or event-scale flows occur, changes in connectivity of a watershed affect flowpath, residence time, and biogeochemical reactions. Places of high reaction activity in a specific place or time are called hot spots or hot moments (Pedroli, 1990)(Wand et al., 2015)(Krause et al., 2017)(Fisher et al., 2004)(Trauth et al., 2014)(Covino, 2016).\n\nA fundamental concept in ecohydrology is that plant physiology is directly linked to water availability. Where there is ample water, as in rainforests, plant growth is more dependent on nutrient availability. However, in semi-arid areas, like African savannas, vegetation type and distribution relate directly to the amount of water that plants can extract from the soil. When insufficient soil water is available, a water-stressed condition occurs. Plants under water stress decrease both their transpiration and photosynthesis through a number of responses, including closing their stomata. This decrease in the canopy forest, canopy water flux and carbon dioxide flux can influence surrounding climate and weather.\n\nInsufficient soil moisture produces stress in plants, and water availability is one of the two most important factors (temperature being the other) that determine species distribution. High winds, low atmospheric relative humidity, low carbon dioxide, high temperature, and high irradiance all exacerbate soil moisture insufficiency. Soil moisture availability is also reduced at low soil temperature. One of the earliest responses to insufficient moisture supply is a reduction in turgor pressure; cell expansion and growth are immediately inhibited, and unsuberized shoots soon wilt.\n\nThe concept of water deficit, as developed by Stocker in the 1920s, is a useful index of the balance in the plant between uptake and loss of water. Slight water deficits are normal and do not impair the functioning of the plant, while greater deficits disrupt normal plant processes.\n\nAn increase in moisture stress in the rooting medium as small as 5 atmospheres affects growth, transpiration, and internal water balance in seedlings, much more so in Norway spruce than in birch, aspen, or Scots pine. The decrease in net assimilation rate is greater in the spruce than in the other species, and, of those species, only the spruce shows no increase in water use efficiency as the soil becomes drier. The two conifers show larger differences in water potential between leaf and substrate than do the hardwoods. Transpiration rate decrease less in Norway spruce than in the other three species as soil water stress increases up to 5 atmospheres in controlled environments. In field conditions, Norway spruce needles lose three times as much water from the fully turgid state as do birch and aspen leaves, and twice as much as Scots pine, before apparent closure of stomata (although there is some difficulty in determining the exact point of closure). Assimilation may therefore continue longer in spruce than in pine when plant water stresses are high, though spruce will probably be the first to “run out of water”.\n\nSoil moisture is a general term describing the amount of water present in the vadose zone, or unsaturated portion of soil below ground. Since plants depend on this water to carry out critical biological processes, soil moisture is integral to the study of ecohydrology. Soil moisture is generally described as water content, formula_1, or saturation, formula_2. These terms are related by porosity, formula_3, through the equation formula_4. The changes in soil moisture over time are known as soil moisture dynamics.\n\nRecent global studies using water stable isotopes show that not all soil moisture is equally available for groundwater recharge or for plant transpiration.\n\nEcohydrological theory also places importance on considerations of temporal (time) and spatial (space) relationships. Hydrology, in particular the timing of precipitation events, can be a critical factor in the way an ecosystem evolves over time. For instance, Mediterranean landscapes experience dry summers and wet winters. If the vegetation has a summer growing season, it often experiences water stress, even though the total precipitation throughout the year may be moderate. Ecosystems in these regions have typically evolved to support high water demand grasses in the winter, when water availability is high, and drought-adapted trees in the summer, when it is low.\n\nEcohydrology also concerns itself with the hydrological factors behind the spatial distribution of plants. The optimal spacing and spatial organization of plants is at least partially determined by water availability. In ecosystems with low soil moisture, trees are typically located further apart than they would be in well-watered areas.\n\nA fundamental equation in ecohydrology is the water balance at a point in the landscape. A water balance states that the amount water entering the soil must be equal to the amount of water leaving the soil plus the change in the amount of water stored in the soil. The water balance has four main components: infiltration of precipitation into the soil, evapotranspiration, leakage of water into deeper portions of the soil not accessible to the plant, and runoff from the ground surface. It is described by the following equation:\n\nformula_5\n\nThe terms on the left hand side of the equation describe the total amount of water contained in the rooting zone. This water, accessible to vegetation, has a volume equal to the porosity of the soil (formula_3) multiplied by its saturation (formula_7) and the depth of the plant's roots (formula_8). The differential equation formula_9 describes how the soil saturation changes over time. The terms on the right hand side describe the rates of rainfall (formula_10), interception (formula_11), runoff (formula_12), evapotranspiration (formula_13), and leakage (formula_14). These are typically given in millimeters per day (mm/d). Runoff, evaporation, and leakage are all highly dependent on the soil saturation at a given time.\n\nIn order to solve the equation, the rate of evapotranspiration as a function of soil moisture must be known. The model generally used to describe it states that above a certain saturation, evaporation will only be dependent on climate factors such as available sunlight. Once below this point, soil moisture imposes controls on evapotranspiration, and it decreases until the soil reaches the point where the vegetation can no longer extract any more water. This soil level is generally referred to as the \"permanent wilting point\". This term is confusing because many plant species do not actually \"wilt\".\n\nDamkohler Number\n\nThe Damkohler number is a unitless ratio that predicts whether the time in which a particular nutrient or solute is in specific pool or flux of water will be sufficient time for a specific reaction to occur. \n\nDa = \n\nWhere T is the time of either the transport or the reaction. Transport time can be substituted for T exposure to determine if a reaction can realistically occur depending on during how much of the transport time the reactant will be exposed to the correct conditions to react. A Damkohler number greater than 1 signifies that the reaction has time to react completely, whereas the opposite is true for a Damkohler number less than 1. \n\n\n"}

The top markets for Gordon's are (in descending order) the United Kingdom, the United States and Greece. It is owned by the British spirits company Diageo and, in the UK, is made at Cameron Bridge Distillery in Fife, Scotland (although flavourings may be added elsewhere). It is the world's best-selling London dry gin. Gordon's has been the UK's number one gin since the late 19th century. A 40% ABV version for the North American market is distilled in Canada.\n\nGordon's London Dry Gin was developed by Alexander Gordon, a Londoner of Scots descent. He opened a distillery in the Southwark area in 1769, later moving in 1786 to Clerkenwell. The \"Special London Dry Gin\" he developed proved successful, and its recipe remains unchanged to this day. Its popularity with the Royal Navy saw bottles of the product distributed all over the world.\n\nIn 1898 Gordon & Co. amalgamated with Charles Tanqueray & Co. to form Tanqueray Gordon & Co. All production moved to the Gordon's Goswell Road site. In 1899, Charles Gordon died, ending the family association with the business.\n\nIn 1904 the distinctive square-faced, green bottle for the home market was introduced. In 1906 Gordon's Sloe Gin went into production. The earliest evidence in recipe books for the production of Gordon's Special Old Tom was in 1921.\n\nIn 1922 Tanqueray Gordon & Co. was acquired by the Distillers Company. In 1924 Gordon's began production of a 'Ready-to-Serve' Shaker Cocktail range, each in an individual shaker bottle.\n\nIn 1925 Gordon's was awarded its first Royal Warrant by King George V. In 1929 Gordon's released an orange gin followed by a lemon variety in 1931.\n\nIn 1934 Gordon's opened its first distillery in the US, at Linden, New Jersey.\n\nBy 1962 at least it was the world's highest selling gin.\n\nIn 1984 British production was moved to Laindon in Essex. In 1998 production was moved to Fife in Scotland, where it remains to this day.\n\nEvery label and bottle top of Gordon's gin bears a depiction of a wild boar. According to legend a member of Clan Gordon saved the King of Scotland from the animal while hunting.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer, Gordon's gin is triple-distilled and contains juniper berries, coriander seeds, angelica root, licorice, orris root, orange, and lemon peel, though the exact recipe has remained a closely guarded secret since 1769. It differed from others at the time in that it didn't add sugar, which made it a \"dry\" gin. It takes ten days' distillation after receiving the wheat to create a finished product of a bottle of Gordon's Gin.\n\nIn the UK Gordon's is sold in a green glass bottle, but in export markets, it is sold in a clear bottle. Some airport duty-free shops sell it in plastic bottles in the 75cl size.\n\nGordon's is sold in several different strengths depending on the market. In the US, the strength is 40% ABV. Until 1992, the ABV in the UK was 40%, but it was reduced to 37.5% to bring Gordon's gin into line with other white spirits such as white rum and vodka, and also reduce production costs (the other leading brands of gin in the UK, Beefeater gin and Bombay Sapphire, are both 40% ABV in the UK). In continental Europe and in some duty-free stores, a 47.3% ABV version (Traveller's Edition) is available in addition to the 37.5% one, while in New Zealand and Australia, as of 2011, it is sold at 37.2% ABV, and in South Africa, it is 43% ABV.\n\nIn addition to the main product line, Gordon's also produces a sloe gin; a vodka (US & Venezuela only), two alcopop variants, Space and Spark; three vodka liqueur variants, Cranberry, Parchita and Limon (Venezuela only) and a canned, pre-mixed gin and tonic as well as a canned Gordon's and Grapefruit (500ml - Russia only).\n\nOn 11 February 2013, Gordon's announced the release of Gordon's Crisp Cucumber, a flavored gin, which blends the original gin with cucumber flavor. In early 2014, Gordon's Elderflower was added to their \"flavored\" gin collection, and is made in much the same way, with a natural elderflower flavoring being added to the original recipe.\n\nIn August 2017, Gordon's began selling Gordons Pink, a pink-colored gin flavored with several types of red berries.\n\nIn February 2020, Gordon’s launched two new flavours in lemon and peach.\n\nIn April 2020, it was announced that Gordon’s were launching an orange flavoured gin.\n\n\nA range of pre-mixed drinks:\n\n\nGordon's Gin is specified by name in the recipe for the Vesper Cocktail given by James Bond in Ian Fleming's 1953 novel \"Casino Royale\".\n\nGordon's was Ernest Hemingway's favourite gin, which he claimed could \"fortify, mollify and cauterize practically all internal and external injuries\".\n\nIn the movie \"The African Queen\" Katharine Hepburn's character pours Humphrey Bogart's entire crate of Gordon's bottles into the river and floats away from the empties.\n\nIn the 14th episode of the anime series \"\", towards the end of the episode, a hospital patient reveals that he snuck in a bottle of Gordon's Gin and the label was in its export colors.\n\nIn the film The Sting, Paul Newman's character drinks Gordon’s Gin whilst playing cards with Robert Shaw's character.\n\nIn the film The Big Heat, Gloria Grahame's character mixes a cocktail with Gordon's Gin.\n\nAccording to an eyewitness account cited in \"A Night to Remember\" (book) by Walter Lord, a passenger of the RMS Titanic \"drained\" a bottle of Gordon’s Gin and survived the sinking.\n\n"}

With over 200 credits to his name, he had a highly prolific career in the American, British and Italian entertainment industries, supervising in and participating in the post-production dubbing both foreign and domestic, often overseeing the English-language dubbing of foreign actors' dialogue.\n\nBorn in 1923, Rietti was the younger of two sons of the Italian actor Victor Rietti and Rachel Rosenay. In 1932, at the age of nine, he joined his father's company \"Teatro Italiano\", making his stage debut in \"Mysterious Currents\". His father (under whom Ida Lupino and June Duprez had studied acting) developed his son's acting career under the name Bobby Rietti. He made his motion picture debut as Fattorino in Monty Banks' comedy \"Heads We Go \" (1933). He soon caught the eye of David O. Selznick, who offered him an extended film contract. Despite letting down Alfred Hitchcock, who handpicked him to play the lead in \"Sabotage\" (1936), he made 17 motion pictures during the 1930s, remaining a popular child actor throughout that decade. They would later work together in Hitchcock's film \"Frenzy\".\n\nRietti was also active on the stage. At the age of twelve to play Jonathan across Elisabeth Bergner in James Barrie's last play, \"The Boy David\" (1936), which dramatised the Biblical story of King Saul and the young David. Altogether, in his boyhood years he acted in eighteen films and over one hundred and twenty plays.\n\nHis successful career on the stage and in motion pictures was interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War. Rietti and his brother, being Italian, were interned at Ascot internment camp. He later he joined the Rifle Brigade, but accepted the army's request for him to head \"Stars in Battledress\", a group of young actors, which included the young Peter Ustinov and Terry-Thomas, who toured England, and were flown throughout liberated Europe, to entertain Allied troops. In 1945, he was invited by John Gielgud to join his production of \"Hamlet\" for troops in the Far East. After the war, he returned to work in the theatre, films, radio, and the latest medium, early television.\n\nIn radio, he teamed up with Orson Welles in the radio series \"The Third Man\" (1951), and then again on the popular series \"The Black Museum\" (1952), which was broadcast to the US Armed Forces. This was to be the beginning of many collaborations between Rietti and Orson Welles, who remained close friends. He was also a regular on the radio series \"Horatio Hornblower\" (1952) with Michael Redgrave, \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" (1952), \"Theatre Royal\" (1954) with Sir Laurence Olivier, and the classic \"Sherlock Holmes\" (1954) with John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson.\n\nHis frequent work in television and many guest appearances made him a familiar face in the 1950s and 1960s. He is credited with 164 television appearances. He guest starred together with his father in \"The Jack Benny Program\" (1957) and in \"Harry's Girls\" (1960), which were both directed by his friend Ralph Levy, director of \"The Burns and Allen Show\". They also performed together in three versions of his father's television success \"To Live in Peace\" and his father's television play \"Against the Stream\" (1959). In 1958, George Sanders presented \"Candle for the Madonna\", an original television play Robert had written, in which Robert also played the lead.\n\nAmong the earliest of his film appearances were with Leslie Howard in \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" and with Douglas Fairbanks in \"The Private Life of Don Juan\" (both 1934). Of his 83 film appearances throughout his career, he is best remembered for contribution to the original James Bond pictures: besides Sean Connery, he was the only actor who appeared in both \"Thunderball\" (1965) and the re-make \"Never Say Never Again\" (1983). Other popular films he appeared in include \"The Italian Job\" (1969), \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" (1971), \"The Omen\" (1976), as well as a cameo in \"Hannibal\" (2001). He played Robert Grant in \"Hell is Empty\" (1967) for his brother, the producer Ronald Rietti.\n\nWith the growing popularity of epic international films in the 1950s, Rietti gained a reputation for directing the ADR in many international films like \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) and the James Bond films. Rietti Directed ADR in more than 700 Films and received international recognition as the foremost Director in this field. He was nominated in Hollywood for the Golden Reel Award (a technical Oscar) for his ADR direction of the English version of \"Once Upon a Time in America\" (1984), in which he directed Robert De Niro's post syncing. He often cast a young Catherine Zeta Jones as a re-voicing artist. Impressed with her talent, he pushed Samuel Goldwyn Jr. to cast her at a time when the actress was unknown.\n\nHis own voice was used to re-voice Gregory Peck's German dialogue in \"Guns of Navarone\" (1961); and Orson Welles' in \"Treasure Island\" (1972). His voice was used in eight of the James Bond films, for which he directed the ADR; his best known work in the series was replacing the voice of Adolfo Celi in \"Thunderball\" (1965) and Tetsurō Tamba in \"You Only Live Twice\" (1967). In the last ten films of Jack Hawkins, who had lost his voice to throat cancer, Hawkins was dubbed by Rietti.\n\nRietti was also a prolific playwright who translated and adapted many Italian plays (notably those of Luigi Pirandello), from his native Italian into English. He also wrote several original plays which were produced on the stage, for television, and for radio. He founded and served as executive editor for 18 years of \"Gambit\", a theatre quarterly which published international plays, including many of his own. In recognition of their contribution to the arts, he was knighted together with his father, Victor Rietti, by the Italian government in 1959. Rietti's title Cavaliere was upgraded in 1988 to Cavaliere Ufficiale.\n\nIn 1957, Rietti played Satan in the York Mystery Plays; one of these performances was attended by the Queen.\n\nIn 2012, he received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Florida for his lifetime achievements and contribution to the Arts. The year also marked an 80-year milestone for the then 89-year-old actor. Rietti remained active in his last years. He lectured to film students at film academies and universities, published an anthology of Italian Plays and was an active member of BAFTA.\n\nRietti died on 3 April 2015 in London, England, aged 92.\n\n"}

It has been traditionally used as the office of the Chief Whip although the upper floor forms part of the residential apartment for the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. It has been owned and used by the Crown since 1803, first housing the Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces and then the Colonial Office, before the office of the Chief Whip moved into the premises in 1879 until 2001. It is a Grade II listed building.\n\nThe offices of the Prime Minister in 10 Downing Street have spread into 12 Downing Street, connected by a corridor which runs through 11 Downing Street. Under the current government the building is being used to house the Prime Minister's Press Office and Strategic Communications Unit. Although historically the house was used as the office of the Chief Whip, that is now located in 9 Downing Street. The upper floor of 12 Downing Street forms part of the Prime Minister's personal apartment. This stretches from No. 12 across to No. 10 as a joint apartment.\n\nThe land on which 12 Downing Street is built was first sold by Charles Downing to James Steadman in 1723. The house was then sold in 1772 to William Maseres, who leased it three years later to Henry Hunt. This lease was bought out by Simon Frazer, who also acquired Maseres' stake in the property. After Frazer's death in 1783, it was sold by the executors to James Martin, who in turn sold it to the East India Company in 1803. It was purchased that year by the Crown, and was first used to house the Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces. In 1827, it was taken over by the Colonial Office.\n\nWhen Downing Street was remodelled in 1846, the houses at 10, 11 and 12 were joined together as a single overall building, No. 12 continuing to accommodate the Colonial Office. After that moved out in 1879, the house at 12 Downing Street was for many decades used as the office of the Chief Whip of the Government, and also for parliamentary dinners. Herbert Gladstone, the son of then-Chancellor of the Exchequer William Ewart Gladstone, was born at 12 Downing Street in 1854. Herbert later became Home Secretary and the first Governor-General of the Union of South Africa.\n\nDuring the First World War the premises were the headquarters of the Parliamentary Recruitment Committee. It was formed across parties, and managed by the three Chief Whips during the Asquith coalition ministry of 1915–16. Following the breakup of the coalition government, the Liberal Party Chief Whip John Gulland was blamed in some parts of the media for disconnecting the phone line running to 12 Downing Street. This was denied, and a statement was issued to say that \"At no time was the telephone temporarily disconnected.\" The building became Grade II listed on 14 January 1970.\n\nThe residency of the Chief Whips at 12 Downing Street ended in 2001, when Press Secretary Alastair Campbell was moved there from an office in 10 Downing Street by Prime Minister Tony Blair. The Whips were moved to 9 Downing Street, previously only known as the Privy Council building. During Gordon Brown's period as Prime Minister, he moved the Press Office back out of 12 Downing Street and instead used it as an open-plan office for himself and his key advisers, because it contained an individual space large enough for him and his advisers—something not available in 10 Downing Street.\n\n"}

She stayed there until 1830, when her father moved to Champagné Saint Hilaire, where he was a judge. She left the region in 1851, to Lausanne in Switzerland, where she married Gregoire Champseix. He was there since the Spring 1849 after fleeing the repression due to his contribution to the 1848 revolution and later, the Napoleon III police.\n\nIn 1866 a feminist group called the \"Société pour la Revendication du Droit des Femmes\" began to meet at the house of André Léo in Paris. Members included Paule Minck, Louise Michel, Eliska Vincent, Élie Reclus and his wife Noémie, Mme Jules Simon and Caroline de Barrau. Maria Deraismes also participated.

{"id": "1858650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858650", "title": "Kon Kan", "text": "Kon Kan\n\nKon Kan is a Canadian synthpop project conceived and formed in 1988 by Barry Harris in Toronto, Ontario. Kon Kan were awarded a 1990 Juno for the song \"I Beg Your Pardon\" and nominated for a 1991 Juno Award for the single \"Puss N' Boots/These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\".\n\n\"I Beg Your Pardon\" was inspired in part by both the Pet Shop Boys hit single \"Always on My Mind\" and an increasingly prevalent use of sampling by artists such as Public Enemy, M/A/R/R/S and Coldcut. The track sampled Lynn Anderson's 1971 hit \"(I Never Promised You a) Rose Garden\", Silver Convention's 1976 hit \"Get Up and Boogie (That's Right)\", GQ's \"Disco Nights (Rock-Freak)\", Tones on Tail's \"Go!\", Spagna's \"Call Me\", \"National Lampoon\"'s \"Disco Hotline\" sketch from their \"That's Not Funny, That's Sick\" album, and the opening bars from the theme music from \"The Magnificent Seven\" (which was also well known as the theme to a commercial for Marlboro cigarettes in the 1960s).\n\nIt was recorded part-time during weekends in a home basement midi studio in Hamilton, Ontario, in March, April and May 1988. It was here that Barry Harris met Kevin Wynne who was hired to sing the song's verses.\n\nThe resulting single was released in June 1988 on (now defunct) indie label Revolving Records, in Toronto.\n\nIn a 1989 \"Billboard\" magazine interview, Harris reported it was a trip to Portugal that inspired him to write \"I Beg Your Pardon\", stating that he \"got frustrated not getting anywhere as a DJ, so I went to Portugal to clear my mind. That's where the idea for 'Beg' came.\" The record was Harris' first studio project.\n\nMarc Nathan, a New York-based Atlantic Records employee (and radio promoter) who was on vacation in Toronto, heard \"I Beg Your Pardon\" in a dance club, where Barry Harris was DJing. Nathan bought several copies of the single from a record store around the corner from the club and took them back to New York. The single was sent to four radio stations and was received particularly enthusiastically in Houston.\n\nBy fall of 1988, Kon Kan were signed by Atlantic Records, and marketed as a duo. \"I Beg Your Pardon\", eventually re-released in the spring of 1989, was a worldwide hit, and reached the Top 5 in several countries (including the UK) and the Billboard Top 20 in the US. The song earned Kon Kan a Juno Award for Best Dance Recording in 1990.\n\nKon Kan's debut album, \"Move to Move\", was recorded in Los Angeles in January and February 1989. Later that year it appeared on the RPM Top 100 Albums chart. As well as \"I Beg Your Pardon\", it also spawned the singles, \"Harry Houdini\", \"Move to Move\" and another original/cover combination, \"Puss N' Boots\". The latter track included recreations (rather than samples) of Led Zeppelin's \"Immigrant Song\" and Nancy Sinatra's \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\".\n\nThe album also featured collaborations with Bob Mitchell (who had co-written Cheap Trick's number one hit, \"The Flame\"), Jon Lind (co-writer of Madonna's \"Crazy for You\") and Dennis Matkosky. The album also featured a cover version of the smash hit \"Bite the Bullet\" by fellow Canadian group They Never Sleep.\n\nThe album was mixed by Alan Meyerson, who was later a film score mixer.\n\nKon Kan embarked on a world tour with backing vocalist Kim Esty and were particularly well received in South America and Asia.\n\nKevin Wynne, who sang on all but two tracks from \"Move to Move\", left Kon Kan in 1989 and entered the club business. He is now involved in graphic design and print. Wynne also recorded a Depeche Mode-inspired solo single in the 1990s called \"Last Chance\", but it was not released.\n\nKon Kan, now effectively a solo vehicle for Barry Harris, released their second album, \"Syntonic\" late 1990. Harris again teamed up with several writers (including Bob Mitchell), fusing dance and pop tracks with original songs such as Jimmy Soul's \"If You Wanna Be Happy\" (on \"(Could've Said) I Told You So\") and Canadian band Trooper's \"We're Here for a Good Time\" (on \"Time\"). The album was produced by a number of established producers, including renowned disco producer John Luongo, who had also worked with Blancmange, and Martyn Phillips (who had produced The Beloved's \"Happiness\" album that year). Paul Robb of Information Society also produced a couple of tracks.\n\nThe album was preluded by the single \"Liberty\", which featured vocals by Debbe Cole. At the time, Cole was a well established session vocalist, who is best known for her work on Malcolm McLaren's \"Madam Butterfly\". Cole also provided backing vocals on the subsequent \"Syntonic\" tour. Another single, \"(Could've Said) I Told You So\" was also released but, like the previous single and parent album, it was not a hit.\n\nFollowing the commercial failure of \"Syntonic\", Kon Kan was dropped from Atlantic Records’ roster. Marc Nathan (who had been fired in April 1991 following an altercation with the record company's president) stayed loyal to Barry Harris and, in his new role with management company Between the Ears, helped to secure a new deal for Kon Kan with Hypnotic, a subsidiary of A&M Records.\n\nFor the next album, \"Vida!...\" (Hypnotic Records), Harris resumed songwriting duties with Bob Mitchell and Kon Kan expanded to a 4-piece band. Along with original songs such as the album's lead single \"Sinful Wishes\", there was a remake of \"Move to Move\" and a cover of David Bowie's \"Moonage Daydream\". The second single released from the album was \"S.O.L.\" (short for \"shit outta luck\"), a collaboration with Crash Morgan.\n\nThe album, released only in Canada, failed to regain Kon Kan's earlier success and Harris wound up the Kon Kan brand over the next few years.\n\nIn 1994, Harris re-recorded \"I Beg Your Pardon\" without any samples and re-recorded all the vocals. It was released as an EP double pack 12\" with various remixes on Hi-Bias Records in early 1994.\n\nIn 1994, Barry Harris teamed up with fellow DJ and Canadian compatriot, Terry Kelly, and formed the house music project, Top Kat. They released a series of independent singles (on the Stickman label) and one album, \"Hi-Energy House\" on the Hypnotic label. The album featured revisits of Kon Kan's \"I Beg Your Pardon\" (\"Pardon Me/Rose Garden\"), \"Liberty\" (\"There's a Voice in My Heart\") and \"S.O.L.\" (\"Come Unto Me...Sing\").\n\nBarry Harris then collaborated with Rachid Wehbi in the Eurodance band Outta Control, featuring the vocals of Kimberley Wetmore. They released a self-titled album in 1996 which featured versions of Kon Kan's \"Sinful Wishes\" and Joan Osborne's \"One Of Us\". The album also featured a version of Giorgio Moroder and Philip Oakey's \"Together In Electric Dreams\" sung by Barry Harris (but credited to guest vocals by Kon Kan).\n\nIn 1997, Barry Harris recorded a one-off single, \"I Can't Take the Heartbreak\" with Rachid Wehbi, under the name Killer Bunnies.\n\nHarris gained his greatest post-Kon Kan popularity as one half of Thunderpuss (named Thunderpuss 2000 from 1997–1999), collaborating with producer, remixer and DJ, Chris Cox. Cox had worked with Harris on the Outta Control album. Together they produced and remixed dozens of dance hits for many major music artists in the late 1990s and early 2000s, most notably \"It's Not Right but It's Okay\" by Whitney Houston. The duo also concurrently released material under the Thunderpuss moniker, such as covers of \"Papa's Got a Brand New Pigbag\" and David Bowie's \"Heroes\".\n\nHarris also continued to release singles in his own name, such as \"Why'd Ya Let Her\" and the tribal dance anthem, \"Dive in the Pool\".\n\nTwo Thunderpuss albums were released, \"Dancemania 20\" (2001) and \"Thunderpuss\" (2002), while Harris has released a couple of \"continuous mix\" albums, as part of 4-Play's \"Circuit Session\" series. \"Volume 3\" (released in 2000) included the single \"Beg for It\", another reprisal of Kon Kan's \"I Beg Your Pardon\".\n\nConcurrent to his remixing activities, Harris also resumed his DJing career, securing regular employment in clubs in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and other major cities. He was also a popular draw at various circuit parties around the world, and particularly successful on a Japanese tour in 2000.\n\nFollowing a solo remix for Chaka Khan, Harris took a break from the music industry. Following a four-year hiatus he re-emerged in 2009 with \"Drama Queen (Texting You)\", a collaboration with Simone Denny whom he'd worked with in the 1990s.\n\nIn 2011, Harris formed Sick Seconds, a rock band featuring Anton Cook (who had provided drums on Kon Kan's \"Vida!...\" album) and other local musicians. They released their self-titled debut album via iTunes in March 2013.\n\nIn June 2013, Barry Harris and Kevin Wynne reunited as Kon Kan.\n\nOn March 25, 2014, Harris announced on Kon Kan's Facebook Page that they were to begin writing and producing a new Kon Kan song with Rachid Wehbi.\n\n"}
{"id": "1858657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858657", "title": "Falsework", "text": "Falsework\n\nFalsework consists of temporary structures used in construction to support a permanent structure until its construction is sufficiently advanced to support itself. For arches, this is specifically called centering. Falsework includes temporary support structures for formwork used to mold concrete in the construction of buildings, bridges, and elevated roadways.\n\nThe British Standards of practice for falsework, BS 5975:2008, defines falsework as \"Any temporary structure used to support a permanent structure while it is not self-supporting.\"\n\nFalsework has been employed in bridge and viaduct construction since ancient times. The Romans were renowned for its use, as at the Limyra Bridge in Turkey. Until the turn of the 20th century almost all falsework was constructed from timber. To compensate for timber shortages in different regions and to rationalize labor and material usage, new systems were developed.\n\nThe major developments include the design of connection devices (coupler), transitions to other spanning beams such as steel pipes or profiles or reusable timber beams, and adjustable steel props. In 1935 W.A. de Vigier designed an adjustable steel prop which revolutionized many aspects of the construction industry including to support slab formwork, wall formwork, trench sheeting and falsework. Materials from which falsework systems are manufactured have also diversified from traditional steel and timber to aluminium components.\n\nIn the UK, BS 5975 gives recommendations for the design and use of falsework on construction sites. It was first introduced by the British Standards Institute in March 1982 and the third version was published in 2008 with Amendment 1 in 2011. The new revisions bring the code up to date with methodology developed in the new CDM 2007 regulations and also the requirements of the new European codes EN 12811-1:2003 Temporary works equipment - Part 1: Scaffolds, and EN 12812:2004, Falsework - Performance requirements and general design.\n\nHere we see the use of modern pipe-column falsework, used to support the formwork for a post-tensioned reinforced concrete flyover connector for the eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. When the supports are complete, wood beams and plywood or reusable metal forms will be placed, reinforcing and tenon conduits added, and concrete poured. After curing and any tenon tensioning, wedges will be removed and forms and falsework disassembled.\n\nA certain type of bridge, the self-anchored suspension bridge, \"must\" be supported during construction, either by the use of cantilever or suspension methods or by support from below.

To avoid confusion with the 1931 Marx Brothers film of the same name, this film is sometimes referred to as Howard Hawks' Monkey Business.\n\nDr. Barnaby Fulton (Cary Grant), an absent-minded research chemist for the Oxly chemical company, is trying to develop an elixir of youth. He is urged on by his commercially minded boss, Oliver Oxly (Charles Coburn). One of Dr. Fulton's chimpanzees, Esther, gets loose in the laboratory, mixes a beaker of chemicals, and pours the mix into the water cooler. The chemicals have the rejuvenating effect Fulton is seeking. \n\nUnaware of Esther's antics, Fulton tests his latest experimental concoction on himself and washes it down with water from the cooler. He soon begins to act like a 20-year-old and spends the day out on the town with his boss's secretary, Lois Laurel (Marilyn Monroe). When Fulton's wife, Edwina (Ginger Rogers), learns that the elixir \"works\", she drinks some along with water from the cooler and turns into a prank-pulling schoolgirl. \n\nEdwina makes an impetuous phone call to her old flame, the family lawyer, Hank Entwhistle (Hugh Marlowe). Her mother, who knows nothing of the elixir, believes that Edwina is truly unhappy in her marriage and wants a divorce. \n\nBarnaby takes more elixir and befriends a group of kids playing as make-believe \"Indians\" (Native Americans). They capture and \"scalp\" Hank (giving him a Mohawk hairstyle), later fleeing when police show up. Meanwhile, Edwina lies down to sleep off the formula. Meanwhile, a woman leaves her baby with the Fultons' housekeeper as she needs an emergency babysitter. When Edwina awakens, a naked baby is next to her and Barnaby's clothes are nearby. She mistakenly presumes he has taken too much formula and regressed to a baby. She takes the child to Oxly to resolve the problem. Together the two attempt to find an antidote and when the baby grows sleepy, Edwina tries to put him to sleep in the hopes of reversing the effects. \n\nMeanwhile, more and more scientists (and Mr Oxly) at the laboratory are drinking the water and reverting to a second childhood. The formula is lost with the last of the water poured away. As the water is poured away, Barnaby crawls into the laboratory through the window and lays down to sleep next to the baby. Edwina later discovers him and realizes her mistake with the baby. Later at home as Barnaby and Edwina are planning to go out, their spirits and marriage renewed, Barnaby notes that \"you're old only when you forget you're young.\"\n\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 88% based on 25 reviews and an average score of 6.9/10.\n\nHawks said he did not think the film's premise was believable, and as a result thought the film was not as funny as it could have been. Peter Bogdanovich has noted that the scenes with Cary Grant and Marilyn Monroe work especially well and laments that Monroe was not the leading lady instead of Ginger Rogers. However, Gregory Lamb of \"The Christian Science Monitor\" described Rogers as \"a comedienne par excellence\" in the film.\n\nIn the book \"Film Dialogue\" Jeff Jaeckle criticized the film's depictions of Native Americans during a scene of Grant playing cowboys and Indians, stating that \"Smearing war paint on his face and adopting the name of Red Eagle, he coaches the children in a war song: 'We wantum wampum, we wantum wampum/Ugha ugha goo goo', and so on. In such nonsense speech Indianness and childishness are the same thing. It seems worth making a distinction between this and the evident good intentions of such liberal films as \"Broken Arrow\".\"\n\n"}

He is usually known as 'Diddy David Hamilton' which was a name given to him by the late English comedian Ken Dodd.\n\nHe attended Glastonbury Road Grammar School at St Helier in Surrey, until aged 17. While at school he became a columnist on the weekly national magazine Soccer Star.\n\nOn leaving school Hamilton became a script-writer for the TV series, \"Portrait of a Star\".\n\nIn 1960 he became an in-vision television announcer for ABC TV (Associated British Corporation) based in Didsbury, Manchester and appeared with Ken Dodd in the TV series, \"Doddy's Music Box\", acquiring the nickname, 'Diddy'. Throughout the 1960s he hosted shows for the ITV franchises Tyne Tees, Anglia and Westward.\n\nHe joined the then-new Thames Television as an announcer in 1968, subsequently hosting many shows for them including \"Miss TV Times\", \"TV Times Gala Awards\", \"The World Disco Dance Championships\", as well as many outside broadcasts, circus and sports shows. He appeared alongside comedians Benny Hill and Tommy Cooper and hosted Thames TV's showcase weeks on television in New York City and Los Angeles. Later he hosted ATV's Saturday night series, \"Up For the Cup\", and four series of ITV's hangman-style game show, \"All Clued Up\".\n\nFor BBC TV he hosted \"Top of the Pops\" and \"Seaside Special\" and the \"Eurovision Song Contest Previews\" in 1986. For seven years he was the main host of one of the earliest satellite TV stations, Lifestyle. Hamilton was one of the final people on the network when it closed on 24 January 1993, appearing on the final segment wishing viewers goodbye.\n\nIn February 2012 at the age of 73 he danced to the 1988 hit \"Push It\" with fellow DJ Tony Blackburn as contestants on the charity show \"Let's Dance for Sport Relief\"\n\nHamilton made his broadcasting debut with the British Forces Network in Germany in 1959. His first UK broadcast was as the host of \"The Beat Show\" from the Playhouse Theatre, Manchester, in 1962. He hosted the show on the BBC Light Programme until 1965. He presented the final edition of \"Housewives' Choice\" in 1967 and was first heard on Radio 1 in November 1967, presenting \"Family Choice\". By the late '60s Hamilton was presenting many shows for BBC radio, including \"Music Through Midnight\", \"Roundabout\", \"Pop Inn\", \"Radio 1 Club\" and shows featuring the music of Frank Chacksfield.\n\nIn 1970 he joined the team of \"Late Night Extra\" and in 1973 was offered his own daily show on Radio 1 every weekday afternoon from 2pm to 5pm. A regular feature was his \"Tea at Three\" slot which used as its jingle based on the 1961 version (by the Syncopators) of Jack Buchanan's 1935 hit \"Everything Stops For Tea\" recorded for the show by Mud. In 1975 the show was simultaneously broadcast on Radio 1 and Radio 2 (listeners being able to hear the show in stereophonic sound on Radio 2's VHF frequency), giving it the biggest audience of the day. In December 1977, the show moved to Radio 2 and remained there until the end of 1986 when Hamilton quit the station, complaining of its 'geriatric' music policy.\n\nSince January 1987, Hamilton has been heard on many commercial stations in the UK. He joined Reading's Radio 210 initially to present a mid-morning show from 9am to 12 noon although the show was quickly brought forward an hour, starting at 8am. He then joined Capital Gold in November 1988 to present its daily 10am to 1pm show. In addition to that, he also presented a weekly oldies show which was heard on various ILR stations around the UK. This was usually heard on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nIn late 1994, Hamilton presented the Breakfast show on Melody FM (now Magic 105.4) for four years before moving to London's Liberty Radio to present an afternoon show. He also did a show on the Classic Gold Network on a Sunday.\n\nAs well as Classic Gold, in 2000 he joined PrimeTime Radio, presenting the weekday mid-morning show, where he remained until its demise in 2006. In addition to this, in October 2001 he left Classic Gold and presented the breakfast show on Birmingham's Saga 105.7 FM before moving to Nottingham's Saga 106.6 FM in early 2003. From 2004 to 2006, he was heard on various radio stations around the UK, presenting his Million Sellers show, which would usually go out on a Saturday lunchtime, and was repeated at midnight. Around this time he also had a sojourn at Big L 1395.\n\nIn April 2012, Hamilton was one of the launch presenters on \"The Wireless\", an Internet-based radio station operated by Age UK and aimed at older people throughout the UK.\n\nOn stage Hamilton has compered shows by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, David Cassidy and many other pop acts. He has hosted shows at venues like the Royal Albert Hall and the London Palladium, and headlined in four major pantomimes.\n\nIn 2016 he embarked on a 40-theatre tour, David Hamilton's Rock `n` Roll Back The Years, with band, The Fugitives, and singers.\n\nHamilton was the compere for the Wembley Lions Speedway team in 1970 and 1971.\nDuring the 1970s Hamilton was also the match day presenter for the Reading Racers Speedway Club. Latterly he was seen regularly on BBC1's \"Match of the Day\" and BSkyB's \"Football First\" as he is the matchday compère at Fulham F.C.\n\nHamilton is the author of three books: The Music Game (autobiography) 1986, A Fulhamish Tale, 2012, and The Golden Days of Radio One, 2017.\n\nBy 2015 Hamilton was hosting daily four hour shows for The Wireless, and The Million Sellers for Decades Radio.

{"id": "1858725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858725", "title": "William Bradford Huie", "text": "William Bradford Huie\n\nWilliam Bradford \"Bill\" Huie (November 13, 1910 – November 20, 1986) was one of the most successful American journalists and authors of the 20th century. Huie was a prolific writer, investigative reporter, editor, national lecturer, television host, and masterful storyteller. His credits include twenty-one books that sold over 30 million copies worldwide. In addition to writing 14 bestsellers, he wrote hundreds of articles that appeared in all of the major magazines and newspapers of the day. \n\nHuie wrote several books about controversial topics related to World War II and the Civil Rights Movement. He was also known for the practice of checkbook journalism, paying subjects to gain interviews and articles about them. In January 1956 he published an interview in \"Look\" magazine in which the two white men who killed Emmett Till admitted their guilt and described their crime. They had been acquitted at trial several months previously by an all-white jury.\n\nSix of Huie's books were adapted as feature films during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.\n\nBorn in Hartselle, Alabama in 1910, William Bradford Huie was the son of John Bradford and Margaret Lois (Brindley) Huie, and was the eldest of three children. He attended Morgan County High School and graduated as class valedictorian. He attended the University of Alabama, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1930.\n\nFrom 1932 to 1936, Huie worked as a journalist for the \"Birmingham Post\" newspaper. In 1934, he married his grammar school sweetheart, Ruth Puckett. Their wedding took place in her parents' home in Hartselle. Huie later described the scene in his largely autobiographical first novel, \"Mud on the Stars\" (1942).\n\nIn late 1938, Huie was in Los Angeles and worked independently as an undercover reporter to gather information on gangster Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel. He reported on his experiences in the \"Los Angeles Times\" and later in the December 1950 issue of \"The American Mercury,\" a literary magazine.\n\nHuie's first national recognition came from his article \"How To Keep Football Stars In College\", \"Collier's Weekly\", 1 January 1941. This piece about the University of Alabama 1940s football program included provocative quotes, such as \"We who have recruited Alabama's players know who our competitors have been. And we've offered no higher prices than were necessary to compete in the open market.\"\n\nDuring World War II, Huie served in the United States Navy as a lieutenant and a war correspondent from 1943 to 1945, including a period as aide to Vice Admiral Ben Moreell of the Seabees. While chronicling the wartime activity of the Seabees, Lieutenant Huie had special permission to continue his own writing projects, both fiction and nonfiction. He drew from his Navy experiences, including his participation in D-Day, for his 1959 novel \"The Americanization of Emily.\" It was adapted as the 1964 film of the same name starring James Garner and Julie Andrews. Both Garner and Andrews consider it the personal favorite of their films.\n\nDischarged in 1945 from the Navy, Huie went immediately to the Pacific theatre as a war correspondent. His experiences at Iwo Jima became the basis for the nonfiction work, \"The Hero of Iwo Jima\", published in \"The Hero of Iwo Jima and Other Stories\" in 1962. It was an account of the life of flag-raiser Ira Hayes. Huie's account was developed into the 1961 film \"The Outsider,\" starring Tony Curtis. He drew from his experiences in Hawaii during the war for his novel \"The Revolt of Mamie Stover\" (1951). This was adapted as the 1956 film of the same name starring Jane Russell. He was on every war front except Russia during WWII.\n\nBefore the war, Huie had been writing for \"The American Mercury,\" a literary magazine founded by H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan. Like Mencken, Huie was a critic of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"New Deal\" policies during the Great Depression. After the war, he returned to the \"Mercury\", becoming associate editor, then editor. In 1950, publisher Clendenin J. Ryan bought the magazine. Ryan and editor Huie wanted to develop the magazine as a journal of the fledgling American conservative movement, introducing new, mass-appeal writers such as evangelist Billy Graham, former communist Max Eastman, and long-time Federal Bureau of Investigation director J. Edgar Hoover. Young William F. Buckley, future \"National Review\" founder and editor, was one of Huie's early staffers.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, however, Huie and Ryan were unable to overcome financial difficulties and were forced to sell the magazine to one of its investors, Russell Maguire. After Huie's departure, Maguire and other owners drove the new \"American Mercury\", in author William A. Rusher's phrase, \"toward the fever swamps of anti-Semitism.\" He believed that they destroyed its legitimacy and contributed to its end. To Huie's disgust, the journal that had once featured the work of W. E. B. Du Bois and Langston Hughes became a periodical advocating racism.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1955, Huie was a popular speaker, traveling back and forth across the country on the professional lecture circuit. During the same period, he also became well known through his appearances on the weekly television current events program, \"Longines Chronoscope,\" produced in New York City. As a co-editor of the hour-long talk show, he interviewed newsmakers John F. Kennedy, Joseph McCarthy, and Clare Boothe Luce, as well as international figures, politicians, scientists, and economists. His program co-editors included figures such as Henry Hazlitt and Max Eastman. Domestic issues, Congressional activity, military defense, the Olympics, and foreign policy were all topics discussed on the program.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Huie and his wife resettled permanently in their native Hartselle. Ruth worked as a first grade schoolteacher. Huie continued to write full-time at home as freelance journalist and novelist.\n\nDuring this period, activism in the Civil Rights Movement increased and Huie was commissioned by periodicals such as the \"New York Herald Tribune\" and \"Look\" magazine to cover breaking events in the South. In 1954 the US Supreme Court ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, but most southern jurisdictions made no changes to their schools.\n\nHuie attended the appeal and second trial in 1954 of Ruby McCollum, a wealthy married black woman in Florida who had shot and killed her white paramour, physician and state senator-elect Dr. Leroy Adams. She testified that he had forced her to have sex and bear his child when she got pregnant. The popular married doctor was being groomed to run for Governor of Florida. Huie had been contacted about the case by writer Zora Neale Hurston, who had worked with him earlier at \"The American Mercury\" and had covered the first McCollum trial in Live Oak, Florida for the \"Pittsburgh Courier.\" The judge had prohibited McCollum from talking to the press.\n\nHuie attended the appeal and second trial, and conducted background investigations of the figures and events. He was arrested on contempt of court charges; the judge cited him for \"meddling\" in a trial that \"could embarrass the community\". Huie was soon freed from jail and he was pardoned years later. His book on the sensational case, \"Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail\" (1956), became a bestseller; it was banned in Florida. \"Ebony,\" \"Time,\" and other journals publicized McCollum's story worldwide.\nHuie also reported on the lynching of African-American Chicago teenager Emmett Till in Money, Mississippi in 1955. After an all-white jury found the two defendants not guilty, Huie paid the men $4,000 for an interview. They described how and why they committed the murder, and were protected by double jeopardy from being tried again for the crime. Huie published his account in \"Look\" magazine in January 1956. Some mainstream journalists criticized what they called his \"checkbook journalism\". Huie also published a full-length book on the case, \"Wolf Whistle\" (1959). Simeon Wright, Till's cousin and an eyewitness to the events at the store and to Till's abduction, refuted the killers' version in his 2010 memoir, written with Her Boyd, \"Simeon's Story: An Eyewitness Account of the Kidnapping of Emmett Till.\"\n\nHuie also reported on various Ku Klux Klan activities, including the 1964 killing of \"Freedom Summer\" workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner. His books on the latter included \"The Klansman\" (1965) and \"Three Lives for Mississippi\" (1965). The KKK to burned a cross on his front lawn in 1967 to try to intimidate him.\n\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Council (SCLC), wrote the Introduction for the second edition of Huie's \"Three Lives for Mississippi.\" He said that it \"is a part of the arsenal decent Americans can employ to make democracy for all truly a birthright and not a distant dream. It relates the story of an atrocity committed on our doorstep.\" Subsequent editions of the work include an \"Afterword\" by Juan Williams. In 1970, Huie published \"He Slew the Dreamer,\" an account of the Memphis assassination of King, for which he had interviewed assassin James Earl Ray.\n\nHuie's book \"The Execution of Private Slovik\" (1954) related the historic account of World War II G.I. Eddie Slovik, the only soldier since the American Civil War to be executed for desertion. The government had kept this quiet, not telling his widow how he died. After the book revealed Slovik's story, Huie and others tried for years to get the government to pay his widow a pension, but had no success. He had discussions with Frank Sinatra about adapting the work as a movie. Sinatra dropped it in 1960 due to objections to his choice of screenwriter, a man who was one of the Hollywood Ten blacklisted after refusing to testify to HUAC. The singer was campaigning at the time for John F. Kennedy as president. The book was later adapted as a television movie, entitled as \"The Execution of Private Slovik\" (1974), starring Martin Sheen, and aired by NBC.\n\nIn 1973 Huie's father died. This loss was followed several months later by the death of Huie's wife Ruth from cancer. In 1975 Huie met Martha Hunt Robertson of Guntersville, Alabama, an art instructor at a local college. They married in Huntsville, Alabama on July 16, 1977. They divided their time between their Hartselle and Guntersville homes. In a few years, the Huies moved to Scottsboro. By 1985 they resettled in Guntersville.\n\nHuie wrote one more significant book after Ruth's death. \"In the Hours of Night\" is the story of the development of the atomic bomb and its effect on its creators and policy makers. It is loosely based on the life of James Forrestal, Secretary of Defense during the height of the development.\n\nOn November 20, 1986, Huie died of a heart attack. He left an unfinished novel, \"The Adversary\", which was intended to be the second of a trilogy that began with \"In the Hours of Night.\" Martha Huie, his widow and heir, continued to represent her late husband's literary properties. She managed ongoing projects until her death in Memphis in May 2014. Martha Huie's daughter, Mary Ben Heflin, now handles William Bradford Huie's literary properties and ongoing projects.\n\nThe library has a permanent biographical display of Huie's work as well as bibliographical resources.\n\nAfter Huie's death, his widow Martha Hunt Robertson Huie donated his papers, manuscripts, artifacts, correspondence to The Ohio State University and The University of Alabama Special Collection Libraries.\n\nWilliam Bradford Huie wrote over twenty books, fourteen of which became best sellers.\n\nSince Huie's death in 1986, dozens of publications have cited, quoted, referenced and analyzed his work. Recent examples include: David Halberstam's \"The Fifties\"; both volumes of \"Reporting Civil Rights: American Journalism 1941-1963 and 1963-1973\"; \"The Race Beat\" by Gene Roberts and Hank Klibanoff, 2006; and Devin McKinney's \"An American Cuss,\" in \"Oxford American\", Issue 57, 2007.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The four survivors were disposed of soon after the war.\n\nThe \"Devonshire\" class was designed as improved versions of the preceding \"Monmouth\" class and were also intended for commerce protection.\nThe armament of the new design was made more powerful by the replacement of the twin six-inch (152 mm) turrets and the forward double six-inch casemates by four 7.5-inch (190 mm) single turrets in a diamond arrangement.

The ships also carried 18 quick-firing (QF) 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes. Her two 12-pounder 8-cwt guns could be dismounted for service ashore.\n\nAt some point in the war, the main deck six-inch guns of the \"Devonshire\"-class ships were moved to the upper deck and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve seakeeping and the four 3-pounder guns displaced by the transfer were landed.\n\nThe ships' waterline armour belt had a maximum thickness of and was closed off by transverse bulkheads.

None of these figures are mentioned anywhere other than in Matthew and nothing else is known about them. As with most of the later section of Matthew's genealogy it conflicts with that given in Luke 3. There is some similarity in this passage Matthew gives Joseph's grandfather as Matthan and Luke as Matthat, the other names, however, are wholly different. Eleazar was a common Old Testament name, appearing many times in that work.\n\nRobert H. Gundry, who is highly skeptical of the earlier parts of Matthew's genealogy, believes that these later figures are likely accurate as it is unlikely no one would know who Joseph's father and grandfather were. Even if the author of Matthew did not known their names it is unlikely he would risk being creative as he could be fairly sure that somebody would spot his error. Gundry posits that Eleazar is the last fictional creation and that Matthan and Jacob were real people.\n"}

The film is arguably one of his best for the studio, and a precursor to a key Essanay Studios short, \"The Bank\". The film also demonstrates the differences that Chaplin had with Keystone comedy in that it is a coherent whole in which the stock characters actually fill some emotional center. Chaplin brings a certain complexity to his janitor, unusual to the comedy factory of Mack Sennett. The film, which stars among Sennett's bit players Jess Dandy, Al St. John, John T. Dillon, and Helen Carruthers, is far more centered and clear in direction. Comedy flows from within the story rather than as a by-product of story. After all this is a typical bank robbery storyline.\n\nThe hero, a janitor played by Chaplin, is fired from work for accidentally knocking his bucket of water out the window and onto his boss, the chief banker (Dandy). Meanwhile, one of the junior managers (Dillon) is being threatened with exposure by his bookie for his unpaid gambling debts. Thus the manager decides to steal from the company. He is caught in the act of raiding the vault by the bank secretary (Carruthers) who rings for help. Chaplin comes to the rescue only to be misjudged by the chief banker as the thief. The secretary fingers the manager and Charlie receives a just reward and a handshake for foiling the robbery.\n\nMoving Picture World commented, \"...A ripping good comedy number with Chas. Champman [sic] playing the part of the janitor. He interpolates a lot of his inimitable funny business and the plot is better than usual.\"\n\nMotion Picture News also got Chaplin's surname wrong in its review: \"The comical Charles Chapman [sic] in a laughable farce that will arouse peals of laughter from any audience.\"\n\n"}

Savić was born in the village of Garaši, south of Belgrade. His father Sava \"Saviša\" Bošković settled in Garaši from Bjelopavlići (in Montenegro). His paternal great-grandfather Vukašin Bošković was a knez of the Bošković brotherhood in Bjelopavlići.\n\nIlija was homeschooled with private teachers, he went to a Greek school in Zemun, and was for a time in Orahovica where he learnt German. He helped his father in business. Prince Miloš Obrenović put him in governmental work, appointing him customs officer in Višnjica, on the Danube, and later Belgrade. After serving in the regular army, Knez Miloš promoted him to colonel in 1837, he commanded the regular army and military police. \n\nHis father was part of the \"Defenders of the Constitution\", who managed to overthrow Miloš Obrenović and appointed Aleksandar Karađorđević in his place (Aleksandar was the son of Karađorđe, who was assassinated by Obrenović in 1817). In 1842, his father and brother were killed in revolts against \"knez\" Mihailo. Toma Vučić-Perišić, his father's colleague and Interior Minister, appointed Ilija his assistant, and in 1843, when Toma was exiled by Russia, he became the new Interior Minister.\n\nThe primacy Garašanin gave to inter-state consideration is most clearly elaborated in his 1844 \"Načertanije\" (\"The Draft\"), which he wrote a year after he got the new post. The ideas expressed in the draft guided his policies throughout his career, but were never implemented. \"Načertanije\" became a 19th-century statement on the Serbian nation and its vital interests as well as the root of aspirations for a Greater Serbian state. The document was publicly referred to for the first time in an 1888 book by Serbian historian Milan Milićević but was only known to a few people at the time and remained unpublished until 1906. Because \"Načertanije\" was a secret document until 1906, it could not have affected national consciousness at the popular level, at least not in the 19th century. \n\nAlthough written by a statesman and politician identifying Serbian needs with those of the new Principality, Garašanin was strongly influenced by broader views of the Polish \"émigré\" Adam Jerzy Czartoryski and his advisers, as well as French and British attitudes toward nationality and statehood. Ideologically, Garašanin combines in his \"Načertanije\" the German and French models of a nation while politically attempting to balance the interests of the present Serbian state with contemporary demographics (the fact that many Serbs were then still living under the yoke of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires) and past, medieval possessions in Old Serbia (i.e., present-day Kosovo and Metohija, and Macedonia).\n\nInsecurity, more so than Yugoslavism or Serbian nationalism, was the prevailing reasoning behind the idea of expanding Serbian borders. \"Načertanije\" was a revised version of a programme entitled \"The Plan\" proposed to Garašanin by Czatoryski and his Czech envoy to Belgrade, František Zach. Zach presented his plan for regional politics to Garašanin in December 1843, which called for the unification by Serbia of the South Slav lands (Croatia-Slavonia, Dalmatia, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Slovenian lands), thus creating a basis for Serbian resistance to both Russian and Austrian influence. In his revision of Zach's plan, Garašanin envisioned a reconstruction of the medieval Serbian empire and the unification of 'Serbian lands' (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, northern Albania, parts of Dalmatia and the Habsburg Military Border) with a plan for unification of the other South Slavs (Croatians and Bulgarians) under a Serbian dynasty. \n\nThe basic idea was the liberation and unification of South-Slavic lands with Serbia playing the role of a 'Piedmont' for the South Slavs. Garašanin however did not put forth the idea of a broader national unification that would have encompassed Serbs in the Ottoman and Habsburg lands. He assessed that because Serbia was small, its future security would be in jeopardy due to the current International system. Strengthening Serbia through enlargement was the primary goal and this could be done through an alliance with her neighbours and incorporating all Serbs into that state. Garašanin had to consider the imminent collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the geo-strategic interests of European great powers and the identity of the populations surrounding Serbia in order to successfully achieve this goal. He did not have a single strategy for all neighbouring provinces. His strategy seems to have depended on whether he thought a society in question had or did not have a national identity. Hence, the non-national Catholic and Muslim South Slav population were to be assimilated into the Serbian nation where as the nationally conscious Bulgarian population was recognized as a distinct nation.\n\nOf all the Serbian politicians Garašanin's view had not only the greatest breadth but also the most realism with respect to the national problems of both Serbia and other neighbouring states in 1848. The time of great uprisings against the Turks was on the wane then, and the role of opposition to the Turks was assumed by the recently created Balkan states. Garašanin perceived that such a role could be assumed by a modern bureaucratic administration—modern for Serbia and for the Balkans—for it was harsh, arbitrary, and rapacious. It was a matter of superimposing a European model on the chaotic orient and on but recently liberated and still-self-willed and defiant Balkan people. But the model was a suitable one in that it did unite and ensure some measure of order and stability.\n\nThe effective scope of Garašanin's activities extended beyond the Serbian border and opened a way to the modernization of the country. One felt in Garašanin the irrepressible pulsation of the recently pacified uprisings, but also a sober program for an effective administration and free trade. His strength was all the more apparent in the light of Prince Alexander's impotence for the Prince merely reflected the glory of his great father Karađorđe. \"You best see the state of affairs, you are the greatest friend of the Serbian people, and everything else is but trifling and trivial\", Petar II Petrović Njegoš wrote to Garašanin toward the close of 1850. Njegoš also had a personal, intimate feeling for Garašanin, engendered by the force of spontaneous attraction great men have for one another. Though they never met, and the only real contact they had centered around the year 1848, Njegoš felt close enough to Garašanin to confide to him his personal troubles, which the latter would understand were also the obstacles to their common aims. Njegoš's letter, dated 5 July 1850, reads as follows:\n\nJust prior to the outbreak of the Crimean War, Garašanin faced another dilemma, equal in gravity with the previous one (the 1848 Revolution that took place in the Habsburg Empire). As minister for foreign affairs in 1853 Garašanin was decidedly opposed to Serbia joining Russia in war against Ottoman Turkey and the western powers. His anti-Russian views resulted in Prince Menshikov, while on his mission in Constantinople, 1853, peremptorily demanding from the prince Aleksandar Karađorđević, his dismissal. But although dismissed, his personal influence in the country secured the neutrality of Serbia during the Crimean War. He enjoyed esteem in France, and it was due to him that France proposed to the peace conference of Paris (1856) that the old constitution, granted to Serbia by Turkey as suzerain and Russia as protector in 1839, should be replaced by a more modern and liberal constitution, framed by a European international commission. But the agreement of the powers was not secured.\n\nGarašanin induced Prince Aleksandar Karađorđević to convoke a national assembly, which had not been called to meet for ten years. The assembly was convoked for St Andrew's Day 1858, but its first act was to dethrone Prince Aleksandar and to recall the Prince Miloš Obrenović. After the death of his father Miloš (in 1860) Prince Mihailo Obrenović ascended the throne, he entrusted the premiership and foreign affairs to Ilija Garašanin. The result of their policy was that Serbia was given a new constitution, and that he obtained the peaceful withdrawal of all the fortresses garrisoned by Turkish troops on Serbian territory, including the Kalemegdan (1867).\n\nGarašanin was preparing a general rising of the Balkan nations against the Turkish rule, and had entered into confidential arrangements with the Romanians, Albanians, Bulgarians and Greeks. But the execution of his plans was frustrated as in 1867 Garašanin was suddenly discharged, probably because he objected to the proposed marriage of Prince Michael and Katarina Konstantinović. His dismissal caused energetic protests of Russia, and more especially by the assassination of Prince Michael a few months later (10 June 1868). When the assassination took place, he was in Topčider and immediately went to Belgrade to inform the ministers about the assassination and measures were taken to preserve order. The last years of his life were spent away from politics, on his estate in Grocka.\n\nIlija Garašanin was conservative in internal politics. He believed that bureaucracy was the only way for administration to work. In foreign politics, he was the first pro Yugoslavia statesman among Serbs. He believed that a great Yugoslav state had to maintain its independence from both Russia and Austria. Garašanin left behind a vast (still not published) political correspondence. He was one of the more talented politicians of 19th century Serbian politics.\n\nHe was awarded the Order of Prince Danilo I.\n\nHe is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.\n\n\n"}

It follows the crew of the deteriorating starship \"Dark Star\", twenty years into their mission to destroy unstable planets that might threaten future colonization of other planets.\n\nBeginning as a University of Southern California student film produced from 1970 to 1972, the film was gradually expanded to feature film length by 1974, when it appeared at Filmex before receiving a limited theatrical release in 1975. Its final budget is estimated at $60,000. While initially unsuccessful with audiences, it was relatively well received by critics and continued to be shown in theaters as late as 1980. The home video revolution of the early 1980s helped the film achieve \"cult classic\" status, and O'Bannon collaborated with home video distributor VCI in the production of multiple versions on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD.\n\nThe feature directorial debut for Carpenter, and the feature debut for O'Bannon, \"Dark Star\" was also produced and scored by Carpenter, while O'Bannon also served as editor, production designer, and visual effects supervisor and appeared as Sergeant Pinback.\n\nIn the mid-22nd century, mankind has begun colonizing the far reaches of the universe. Armed with artificially intelligent \"Thermostellar Triggering Devices,\" the scout ship \"Dark Star\" and its crew have been alone in space for 20 years on a mission to destroy \"unstable planets\" which might threaten future colonization of other planets.\n\nThe ship is in a state of deterioration and there are frequent system malfunctions (for example, an irreparable radiation leak, their cargo of intelligent talking bombs lowering from their bomb bay without a command to do so, and an explosion destroying their sleeping quarters), and only the voice of the ship's computer for company. The \"Dark Star\"′s commanding officer, Commander Powell, was killed during hyperdrive as a result of an electrical short-circuit behind his rear seat panel, but remains aboard the ship in a state of cryogenic suspension. The ship's remaining crew consists of its new commanding officer, Lieutenant Doolittle (helmsman, and originally second-in-command), Sergeant Pinback (bombardier), Corporal Boiler (navigator), and Talby (target specialist). As the tedium of their tasks over 20 years has driven them \"around the bend\", they have created distractions for themselves: Doolittle, formerly a surfer from Malibu, California, has constructed a musical bottle organ; Talby spends his time in the ship's observation dome, content to watch the universe go by; Boiler obsessively trims his moustache, smokes cigars, and shoots targets with the ship's emergency laser rifle in a corridor.\n\nPinback plays practical jokes on the crew members, maintains a video diary, and has adopted a ship's mascot in the form of a mischievous \"beach ball\"-like alien who refuses to stay in a storage room, forcing Pinback to chase it around the ship and eventually kill it with a gun. Pinback claims he is actually liquid fuel specialist Bill Frug, who inadvertently took the \"real\" Sergeant Pinback's place after he committed suicide by jumping into a fuel tank.\n\nEn route to their next target (the Veil Nebula), the \"Dark Star\" is hit by a bolt of electromagnetic energy during a storm, resulting in yet another on-board malfunction, with \"Thermostellar Bomb #20\" receiving an order to deploy. The ship's computer convinces Bomb #20 that the order was in error, and persuades the bomb to disarm itself and return to the bomb bay. Talby notes the malfunction, and investigates the fault. He discovers a damaged communications laser in the emergency airlock while the crew is engaging in their next bombing run. While Talby attempts to repair it, the laser malfunctions, blinding Talby and knocking him unconscious, causing extensive damage to the main computer, and damaging the bomb release mechanism on Bomb #20.\n\nDue to the damage to the ship's computer, the crew members cannot activate the release mechanism and attempt to abort the drop. After two prior accidental deployments, Bomb #20 refuses to disarm or abort the countdown sequence. The computer activates dampers to confine the blast to a diameter of one mile, but that is all it can do at the moment. As Pinback and Boiler try to talk the bomb out of blowing up underneath the ship, Doolittle revives Commander Powell, who advises him to teach the bomb the rudiments of phenomenology. After donning a space suit and exiting the ship to approach the bomb directly, Doolittle engages in a philosophical conversation with Bomb #20 until it decides to abort its countdown and retreat to the bomb bay for further contemplation.\n\nWhen attempting to assist Doolittle in re-entering the ship, Pinback inadvertently jettisons Talby out of the airlock. As Doolittle tries to rescue the now-conscious Talby, Pinback addresses the bomb over the intercom in another attempt to disarm it. Doolittle has mistakenly taught the bomb Cartesian doubt and, as a result, Bomb #20 determines that it can only trust itself and not external input. Convinced that only it exists, and that its sole purpose in life is to explode, Bomb #20 detonates. The \"Dark Star\" is destroyed, and Pinback and Boiler are killed instantly. Commander Powell is flung into space encased in ice, and Talby and Doolittle are blown in opposite trajectories. Talby drifts into the Phoenix Asteroids (a cluster he has long had a fascination with), destined to circumnavigate the universe for eternity. As Doolittle loses contact with Talby, he sees that he is falling toward the unstable planet. Realizing he will burn up upon entering its atmosphere, he drifts into debris from the \"Dark Star\", finds a surfboard-shaped hunk of debris, and \"surfs\" down into the atmosphere, dying as a falling star.\n\n\nThe screenplay was written by John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon while film students at the University of Southern California. Initially titled \"The Electric Dutchman\", the original concept was Carpenter's, with O'Bannon \"fleshing out many of the original ideas\" and contributing many of the funniest moments. According to O'Bannon, \"The ending was copped from Ray Bradbury's story \"Kaleidoscope\"\", found in the short story collection \"The Illustrated Man\" (1951). O'Bannon references one of his USC teachers, William Froug, when Pinback says in a video diary entry \"I should tell you my name is not really Sergeant Pinback, my name is Bill Frug.\"\n\nThe film began as a 45-minute 16mm student project with a final budget of six thousand dollars. Beginning with an initial budget of one thousand dollars from USC in 1970, Carpenter and O'Bannon completed the first version of the film in 1972. Carpenter had to replace the voice of Pahich with his own as Talby. To achieve theatrical length, an additional fifty minutes were filmed with the support of Canadian distributor Jack Murphy (credited as \"Production Associate\"). Through John Landis, a friend of O'Bannon, the film came to the attention of producer-distributor Jack H. Harris, who obtained the theatrical distribution rights to the film, and insisted on extensive cuts to the existing film as well as the shooting of additional 35mm footage to bring the movie back up to feature film length O'Bannon would later lament that as a result of the padding into a feature-length movie, \"We had what would have been the world’s most impressive student film and it became the world’s least impressive professional film\".\n\nMany special effects were done by Dan O'Bannon, ship design was by Ron Cobb, model work by O'Bannon and Greg Jein, and animation was done by Bob Greenberg. Cobb drew the original design for the \"Dark Star\" ship on a napkin while eating at the International House of Pancakes.\n\nThe completed film premiered on March 30, 1974 at Filmex, the Los Angeles International Film Exposition, for which Carpenter described the film as \"\"Waiting for Godot\" in outer space.\" Harris sold the film to Bryanston Pictures, who released it to fifty theatres on January 16, 1975. Following the success of \"Alien\" and \"Halloween\", \"Dark Star\" was re-released June 1979 by the Atlantic Releasing Corporation as \"...from the author of 'Alien' & the director of 'Halloween'...\" with the tag line, \"The Ultimate Cosmic Comedy!\"\n\nVCI Entertainment released a theatrical cut of \"Dark Star\" on videocassette in August 1983. After criticism of the release by O'Bannon in 1983, a new widescreen video master copy was created based on his personal 35mm print, and a widescreen \"Special Edition\" was released by 1986.\n\nO'Bannon re-edited the film into a seventy-two minute \"director's cut\" released on LaserDisc in 1992, removing much of the footage shot for the theatrical release.\n\nThe film was released on DVD March 23, 1999 and included both a sixty-eight minute \"special edition\" and the longer original theatrical release. A two-disc \"Hyperdrive Edition\" DVD was released on October 26, 2010, which again included both versions of the film, as well as the feature-length documentary \"Let There be Light: The Odyssey of Dark Star\", exploring the origins of \"Dark Star\" and how it was produced. In 2012, a \"Thermostellar Edition\" Blu-ray was released, including only the theatrical version, along with the special features of the 2010 DVD release.\n\nWhile greeted enthusiastically by the crowd at Filmex, the film was not well received upon its initial theatrical release. Carpenter and O'Bannon reported seeing nearly empty theatres and a lack of reaction to the film's humor. The home video cassette revolution of the early 1980s saw \"Dark Star\" become a cult film among sci-fi fans.\n\nAn early review from \"Variety\", recalled by Carpenter as \"the first bad review I got\", described the film as \"a limp parody of Stanley Kubrick’s \"\" that warrants attention only for some remarkably believable special effects achieved with very little money.\" After its re-release in 1979, Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, writing: \"\"Dark Star\" is one of the damnedest science fiction movies I've ever seen, a berserk combination of space opera, intelligent bombs, and beach balls from other worlds.\" Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an 80% fresh rating from 25 reviews, with the following consensus: \"A loopy \"\" satire, \"Dark Star\" may not be the most consistent sci-fi comedy, but its portrayal of human eccentricity is a welcome addition to the genre.\" Leonard Maltin awarded the film two and a half stars, describing it as \"enjoyable for sci-fi fans and surfers\", and complimenting the effective use of the limited budget.\n\nThe \"Beachball with Claws\" segment of the film was reworked by Dan O'Bannon into the science fiction-horror film \"Alien\" (1979). After witnessing audiences failing to laugh at parts of \"Dark Star\" which were intended as humorous, O'Bannon commented, \"If I can't make them laugh, then maybe I can make them scream.\"\n\nDoug Naylor has said in interviews that \"Dark Star\" was the inspiration for \"\", the radio sketches that evolved into the television science fiction situation comedy \"Red Dwarf\". The character Pinback also inspired the character name Pinbacker, the antagonist in Danny Boyle's film \"Sunshine\" (2007). \"Dark Star\" has also been cited as a large inspiration for Machinima series \"Red vs. Blue\" by the series' creator, Burnie Burns.\n\n\"Metal Gear\" series creator Hideo Kojima revealed the iDroid's voice was inspired by the female computer voice from \"Dark Star\".\n\nThe indie rock band Pinback adopted its name from the character Sergeant Pinback, and frequently used samples from the movie in its early work. British synth-pop band Erasure sampled dialogue from this film (along with \"Barbarella\") in their song, \"Sweet, Sweet Baby\", the B-side to \"Drama!\", the debut single off their album, \"Wild!\" (1989). The Human League also used a sample from the film at the end of \"Circus of Death\", the b-side of their debut single, \"Being Boiled\". Cem Oral, under the alias of Oral Experience, also sampled dialogue from this film in his song \"Never Been on E\".\n\nThe music for \"Dark Star\" is chiefly a pure electronic score created by Carpenter using a modular synthesizer.\n\nThe song played during the opening and closing credits is \"Benson, Arizona.\" The music was written by John Carpenter, while the lyrics were written by Bill Taylor, concerning a man who travels the galaxy at light speed and misses his beloved back on Earth. The lead vocalist was John Yager, a college friend of Carpenter's who was not a professional musician, \"apart from being in a band in college.\" Not coincidentally, there is actually a Dark Star Road in Benson, Arizona.\n\n\n\n"}

To highlight their agency in staying uncontacted or isolated, international organizations emphasize calling them \"indigenous peoples in isolation\", \"in voluntary isolation\" or \"in initial contact\".\n\nExisting knowledge of indigenous peoples in isolation comes mostly from encounters with neighbouring communities like other indigenous peoples, as well as for example from aerial footage.\n\nIndigenous rights activists call for indigenous peoples in isolation to be left alone, saying that contact will interfere with their right to self-determination as peoples. Countries have been legislating policy to leave them alone, though such laws are often difficult to enforce or suffer deprioritization. Since isolated peoples lack immunity to common infectious diseases, up to half of them can die of respiratory disease following first contact. It has been proposed that isolated populations are not viable in the long term and that a controlled contact is more humane than the uncontrolled contact that is currently happening. Controlled contact for example has been occasionaly used by the Brazilian state organization National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) to prevent conflicts and deliver vaccinations. Some isolating peoples might even want to have trading relationships and positive social connections with others, but choose isolation out of fears of conflict or exploitation. Other threats are usually related to the outside world's desire to exploit their lands. This can include lumbering, ranching and farming, land speculation, oil prospecting and mining, and poaching. Evangelical missionaries may also pose a threat.\n\nAdditionally uncontacted peoples have been fetishized, objectified and used for satisfying modern fascinations for claiming first contact or claiming a projected state of nature, historically by colonial endeavours and contemporarily by people paying tour operators who offer adventure tours to search them out.\n\nIn 2013 there were roughly 100 uncontacted peoples worldwide, half of whom live in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe Sentinelese people of North Sentinel Island, which lies near South Andaman Island in the Bay of Bengal, reject contact; attempts to contact them have usually been rebuffed, sometimes with lethal force. Their language is markedly different from other languages on the Andamans, which suggests that they may have remained isolated for thousands of years. They have been called by experts the most isolated people in the world, and they are likely to remain so. However private people have attempted to intrude upon them repeatedly. Such attempts are against the law. During the 2001 Census of India, a joint expedition conducted during 23–24 February 2001 identified at least a few dozen individuals, but it was not exhaustive. Helicopter surveys after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami confirmed the Sentinelese survived, and there have been a few limited interactions with them since. The local Andaman and Nicobar administration has adopted an \"eyes-on and hands-off\" policy to ensure that no poachers enter the island. A protocol of circumnavigation of North Sentinel Island has been made and notified in consultation with the Indian government.\n\nAnother Andamanese tribe, the Jarawas, live on the main islands, largely isolated from other peoples. They are thought to number a few hundred people.\n\nAbout 50 groups of indigenous peoples of the Americas live in isolation.\n\nThe Toromona are an uncontacted people living near the upper Madidi River and the Heath Rivers in northwestern Bolivia. The government has created an \"exclusive, reserved, and inviolable\" portion of the Madidi National Park to protect the Toromona.\n\nA small number of Ayoreo people in the Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area\n\nPacahuaras living in voluntary isolation are believed to be in Pando Department.\n\nUntil the 1970s Brazil attempted unsuccessfully to assimilate or move anyone on lands that could be commercially cultivated. Then, in 1987, it set up the Department of Isolated Indians inside the Fundação Nacional do Índio, facilitating the work of Sydney Possuelo or José Carlos Meirelles, and declared the huge Vale do Javari as perpetually sealed off. In 2007, the Fundação Nacional do Índio reported the presence of 67 uncontacted indigenous peoples in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005.\n\nThe Awá are people living in the eastern Amazon rainforest. There are approximately 350 members, and 100 of them have no contact with the outside world. They are considered highly endangered because of conflicts with logging interests in their territory.\n\nThe Kawahiva live in the north of Mato Grosso. They are usually on the move and have little contact with outsiders. Thus, they are known primarily from physical evidence they have left behind – arrows, baskets, hammocks, and communal houses.\n\nThe Korubu live in the lower Vale do Javari in the western Amazon Basin.\n\nOther tribes may include the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, and the Himarimã. There may be uncontacted peoples in Terra Indigena Uru-Eu-Uaw-Uaw and Terra Indigena Xinane Isolados.\n\nWith the creation of gigantic tribal reserves and strict patrolling, Colombia is now regarded as one of the countries where uncontacted indigenous people are offered maximum protection.\n\nThe Nukak people are nomadic hunter-gatherers living between the Guaviare and Inírida rivers in south-east Colombia at the headwaters of the northwest Amazon basin. There are groups, including the Carabayo, Yuri and the Passé, in Río Puré National Park.\n\nTwo isolated indigenous peoples live in Ecuador's Amazon region. They are both eastern Huaorani peoples living in Yasuni National Park, called the Tagaeri and the Taromenane. These semi-nomadic people live in small groups, subsisting on hunting, gathering, and some crops. They are organized into extended families. In 2013, more than 20 Taromenane were killed by Indians. Since 2007 there is a national policy which mandates: untouchability, self-determination, equality, and no contact.\n\nApproximately 100 Ayoreo people, some of whom are in the Totobiegosode tribe, live uncontacted in the forest. They are nomadic, and hunt, forage, and conduct limited agriculture. They are the last uncontacted peoples south of the Amazon basin, and are in Amotocodie. Threats to them include rampant illegal deforestation. According to Survival International, Brazilian company Yaguarete Porá S.A. is converting thousands of hectares of the Ayoreo-Totobiegosode tribe's ancestral territory into cattle ranching land. The Union of Ayoreo Natives of Paraguay is working for their protection, with support from the Iniciativa Amotocodie.\n\nThe Mashco-Piro are nomadic Arawak hunter-gatherers who inhabit Manú National Park in Peru. In 1998, the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs estimated their number to be around 100 to 250. They speak a dialect of the Piro languages. Amid incursions on their land, the tribe has made it clear they do not wish to be contacted. As of 2013, all the bands seem to be surviving. Other groups include the Machiguenga, Nanti, Asháninka, Mayoruna, Isconahua, Kapanawa, Yora, Murunahua, Chitonahua, Mastanahua, Kakataibo, and Pananujuri. Many of them speak dialects of Panoan languages. There are five reserves for uncontacted peoples. However the law designed to protect those people does not prevent economic operations there.\n\nIn Venezuela some groups from the Hoti, Yanomami, and Piaroa tribes live in relative isolation. The Ministry of Indigenous Peoples has no policies designed to protect these people specifically.\n\n\n\n"}

That same year, Swedish nobles exiled their uncle, King Birger of Sweden, after which the infant Magnus was elected King of Sweden. Their mother Ingeborg had a seat in the guardian government as well as the position of an independent ruler of her own fiefs, and played an important part during their childhood and adolescence.\n\nThe 24 July 1321 marriage contract for Euphemia was signed in Bohus Castle in her mother's fief in Bohuslän. Her mother had plans to take control over Danish Scania, next to her duchy. The marriage was arranged with the terms that Mecklenburg, Saxony, Holstein, Rendsburg and Schleswig would assist Ingeborg in the conquest of Scania. This was approved by the council of Norway but not Sweden. When Ingeborg's forces under command of her lover Knut Porse invaded Scania in 1322–23, Mecklenburg betrayed her and the alliance was broken. Eventually, the affair of Euphemia's marriage led to a conflict between Ingeborg and the governments of Sweden and Norway, which led to the demise of Ingeborg's political position in the guardian governments. The marriage took place anyway, after a fifteen-year engagement. Euphemia did not lack influence in Sweden. She is known to have acted as the witness of seals in several documents. In 1335, when King Magnus appointed Nils Abjörnsson (Sparre av Tofta) to drots, the condition that Euphemia would act as his adviser was included in his appointment.\n\nEuphemia was married in Rostock on April 10, 1336, to her distant kinsman, Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg (1318 – 2 February 1379), a North-German lord deeply interested in obtaining some power in Scandinavia, e.g. fiefs or income. Later, Albert was to gain the nickname \"Fox of Mecklenburg\", to reflect his intrigues as well as avarice. Later the same year, the couple returned to Sweden with Rudolf of Saxony and Henry of Holstein to be present at the coronation of her brother and sister-in-law Blanche of Namur. In Germany, Euphemia's life as a Duchess consort of Mecklenburg does not appear to have affected her status in Sweden, as she was still a political factor there and her name was still placed on various documents. She was the mistress of a very expensive ducal court. In 1340–41, she convinced Magnus to grant renewed trading privileges in Norway to the Hanseatic cities of Mecklenburg, Rostock and Wismar. On 15 April 1357, she granted her inheritance after her brothers Håkan and Knut, the estates Hammar and Farthses, to Skänninge Abbey. It is not known if she was involved in the succession of her son to the throne of Sweden in 1363. She is last confirmed alive 27 October 1363, when she gave up the ownership of her dower estate Hagenow. Her death year is not known, but she is confirmed dead 16 June 1370, when her widower made a vicaria to her memory.\n\nEuphemia lived long enough to see her brother's branch of the family get into severe difficulties, albeit its extinction (which happened in 1387) was not necessarily foreseeable then. Euphemia saw her own second son depose her brother from the Swedish throne, and ascend as King Albert of Sweden. Already in Euphemia's lifetime it was evident that her genealogical position would become a pivotal point to many future claims to the Scandinavian thrones.\n\nAlthough her spouse married a second time after her death, all his legitimate children were born of Euphemia.\n\nAt the time of her death, she had five surviving children:\n\n\n"}

There also are three other lakes around the city. They are Xingyun Lake, Qilu Lake, Yangzong Lake.\n\nTempered by the low latitude and moderate elevation, Yuxi has a mild subtropical highland climate (Köppen \"Cwb\"), with short, mild, dry winters, and warm, rainy summers. Frost may occur in winter but the days still generally warm up to around . During summer, a majority of the days features some rainfall, and daytime temperatures rise to . A great majority of the year's rainfall occurs from June to October.\n\n\nThe city was founded in 960 AD, at a time when Yunnan was not yet part of China. Yuxi was once the core area of Yunnan Province during the Previous Qin Dynasty (period before 221 BC). In the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD), it became a county of Yizhou Shire. The following dynasties witnessed the continuous separations and unifications of the area.

The gas guzzler tax had applied only to cars (not trucks) and was collected by the IRS. Other countries have followed suit and introduced their own version of a gas-guzzler tax such as Canada's \"green levy\".\n\nThere are several reasons for bad fuel economy in cars, vans and trucks:\n\nThen there is the reduction of vehicle weight, with a switch to monocoque construction instead of body on frame construction and an increased use of lightweight materials, aluminium, plastics and high strength HSLA steels instead of ordinary mild carbon steel.\n\nGas-guzzlers are not only seeing a scale back in engine size and weight but also in the type of fuel used to power it to prevent environmental damage caused by the use of fossil fuels. The problem with these alternative fuel technologies is that they are either too expensive for widespread use and/or they are scarcely available especially in smaller countries.\n\nDiesel technology is widespread in light trucks, especially in Japan and Europe. The bad reputation of diesel fuel and the previously bad quality of the fuel, however, have led to the rarity of such vehicles in the U.S market. The excessive particle emissions of diesel engines have also been cut back with particulate filters, which are offered for most modern diesel engines.\n\nFuel-efficient driving habits and vehicle maintenance are easy to change and can have a big impact on fuel consumption. Sudden acceleration and braking, traveling at high speeds, poorly maintained vehicles (frequency of oil changes and brand), and gasoline brands can also impact overall fuel consumption by over 25%. There are many other ways to reduce your fuel consumption.\n\nThe U.S government introduced the Gas Guzzler Tax as a part of the Energy Tax Act. The tax was introduced to tax the purchase of inefficient vehicles at the same time that Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards were introduced. The Gas Guzzler Tax applies only to vehicles classified as cars, as opposed to light trucks. Since 1991, cars with a combined fuel economy rating under have been subject to the tax. Light trucks, which includes virtually all sport-utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans, are not subject to the tax.\n\nThe primary criticism of the tax is that it does not apply to light trucks. As a result, relatively few vehicles are subject to the tax. When the tax was first introduced, light trucks were viewed as primarily utilitarian work related vehicles. With the shift towards consumer uses for SUVs and pickups, as automakers discontinued the large body-on-frame sedans and station wagons long preferred by many Americans to meet the CAFE standards the original rationale for exempting trucks is considered invalid by critics of the current tax law. Many Americans, especially soccer moms, who once drove the large cars that were classified as gas guzzlers switched to equally inefficient upscale four-door SUVs that are classified as light trucks and therefore exempt from the tax.\n\n"}

Nour unsuccessfully ran against Hosni Mubarak in the 2005 presidential election. He was arrested in 2005 prior to the election and freed six weeks later, and again after the election. He was released from his second imprisonment on 18 February 2009. Nour left Egypt following the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état. In 2014, he spent time in Lebanon for treatment of a wound he sustained while in prison, and expressed his hope for returning to Egypt.\n\nNour was the first man to ever compete against President Hosni Mubarak in the 2005 presidential election. Nour was stripped of his parliamentary immunity and arrested on 29 January 2005. He was charged with forging PAs (Powers of Attorney) to secure the formation of the el-Ghad party. Nour vehemently denied the charges. The arrest, occurring in an election year, was widely criticized by governments around the world as a step backwards for Egyptian democracy. Few seem to regard the charges as legitimate. Nour remained active despite his imprisonment, using the opportunity to write critical articles and make his case and cause better known.\n\nIn February 2005, Condoleezza Rice abruptly postponed a visit to Egypt, reflecting U.S. displeasure at the jailing of Nour, who was reported to have been brutally interrogated. That same month, the government announced that it would open elections to multiple candidates in the following month.\n\nIn March 2005, following a strong intervention in Cairo by a group of Members of the European Parliament led by Vice-President Edward McMillan-Scott (UK, Conservative), Nour was freed and began a campaign for the Egyptian presidency.\n\nIn the election in September 2005, Nour was the first runner-up, with 7% of the vote according to government figures and estimated at 13% by independent observers, although no independent observers were allowed to monitor the elections. Shortly after placing a distant second, in what are widely believed to have been corrupt elections, he was again imprisoned by Mubarak under allegations of \"forgery\" which were widely criticized to have been politically motivated and corrupt charges. \n\nOn 24 December 2005 he was sentenced to five years in jail. Though diabetic, Nour engaged in a two-week long hunger strike to protest against his trial. Nour's verdict and sentencing made global headlines and were the first item of news on many international news broadcasts, including the BBC.\n\nOn the day of Nour's guilty verdict and sentencing, the White House Press Secretary released the following statement denouncing the government's action:\nThe United States is deeply troubled by the conviction today of Egyptian politician Ayman Nour by an Egyptian court. The conviction of Mr. Nour, the runner-up in Egypt's 2005 presidential elections, calls into question Egypt's commitment to democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. We are also disturbed by reports that Mr. Nour's health has seriously declined due to the hunger strike on which he has embarked in protest of the conditions of his trial and detention.\nThe United States calls upon the Egyptian government to act under the laws of Egypt in the spirit of its professed desire for increased political openness and dialogue within Egyptian society, and out of humanitarian concern, to release Mr. Nour from detention.\n\nIn February 2006, Rice visited Mubarak yet never spoke Nour's name publicly. When asked about him at a news conference, she referred to his situation as one of Egypt's setbacks. Days later, Mubarak told a government newspaper that Rice \"didn't bring up difficult issues or ask to change anything.\" From prison, Nour stated \"I pay the price when [Rice] speaks [of me], and I pay the price when she doesn't,\" Nour said. \"But what's happening to me now is a message to everybody.\"\n\nIn June 2007 President Bush, speaking at a conference of dissidents in the Czech Republic, revisited the issue of Ayman Nour, saying:There are many dissidents who couldn't join us because they are being unjustly imprisoned or held under house arrest. I look forward to the day when a conference like this one include Alexander Kozulin of Belarus, Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, Oscar Elias Biscet of Cuba, Father Nguyen Van Ly of Vietnam, Ayman Nour of Egypt. (Applause.) The daughter of one of these political prisoners is in this room. I would like to say to her, and all the families: I thank you for your courage. I pray for your comfort and strength. And I call for the immediate and unconditional release of your loved ones.\nI have asked Secretary Rice to send a directive to every U.S. ambassador in an un-free nation: Seek out and meet with activists for democracy. Seek out those who demand human rights.\n\nNour was released, officially on health grounds, on 18 February 2009, just a few months before he would have completed his prison sentence. It has been alleged that his release from prison was due to U.S. President Obama demanding his release as a condition to meet with Mubarak.\n\nFollowing the fall of Mubarak in the 2011 Revolution, Nour intended to run for the 2012 Egyptian presidential election, but was disqualified by the Presidential Election Commission.\n\nNour left Egypt following the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état. In 2014, he spent time in Lebanon for treatment of a wound he sustained while in prison, and expressed his hope for returning to Egypt.\n\nIn December 2019, Nour launched the Egyptian National Action Group (ENAG), a group of Egyptian expatriates calling to overthrow military rule in Egypt.\n\n\n"}

The island today is home to the Mocha Island National Reserve, a nature reserve that covers approximately 45% of the island's surface. The island is noted as the location of numerous historic shipwrecks. The waters off the island are a popular place for recreational sea fishing.\n\nGeologically, the island is a basement high and it also contains strata of Ranquil Formation whose main outcrops lie in the continent.\n\nThe island was historically inhabited by an indigenous coastal population of Mapuches known as the Lafkenches. The first European to document Mocha was Juan Bautista Pastene on September 10, 1544, who named it \"Isla de San Nicolas de Tolentino\".\n\nAccording to Juan Ignacio Molina, the Dutch captain Joris van Spilbergen observed the use of chilihueques (a South American camelid) by native Mapuches of Mocha Island as plough animals in 1614.\n\nMocha Island was regularly visited by pirates from the Netherlands and England. Francis Drake and Olivier van Noort are known to have used the island as a supply base. When Drake was visiting it during his circumnavigation of the globe he was seriously hurt by hostile Mapuches that inhabited the island. Eventually the Mapuche on the island were transported in 1685, from Mocha Island by Governor José de Garro to a reducción on the plain on the right bank of the Bio Bio River called the Valley of Mocha that later became the location of the modern city of Concepción, Chile.\n\nThe waters off the island are also noted as the home to a famous 19th century sperm whale, Mocha Dick as depicted by American explorer and author Jeremiah N. Reynolds who published an account, \"Mocha Dick: Or The White Whale of the Pacific: A Leaf from a Manuscript Journal\" in May, 1839 in \"The Knickerbocker\" magazine in New York. Mocha Dick was, in part, the inspiration for the fictional whale Moby Dick in the 1851 novel \"Moby-Dick\" by Herman Melville.\nIn the 21st century, considerable evidence has emerged suggesting pre-Columbian contact between the Mapuche and Polynesians. In December 2007, several human skulls with Polynesian features, such as a pentagonal shape when viewed from behind, were found lying on a shelf in a museum in Concepción. These skulls originated from Mocha Island. Professor Lisa Matisoo-Smith of the University of Otago and José Miguel Ramírez Aliaga of the University of Valparaíso hope to win agreement with the locals of Mocha Island to begin an excavation search for Polynesian remains on the island.\n\n\n"}

Several Chauhan inscriptions name a legendary hero called Chahamana as their ancestor, but none of them state the period in which he lived.\n\nThe earliest extant inscription that describes the origin of the Chauhans is the 1119 CE Sevadi inscription of Ratnapala, a ruler of the Naddula Chahamana dynasty. According to this inscription, the ancestor of the Chahamanas was born from the eye of Indra.\n\nThe 1170 CE Bijolia rock inscription of the Shakambhari Chahamana king Someshvara states that his ancestor Samantaraja was born at Ahichchhatrapura (possibly modern Nagaur) in the gotra of sage Vatsa. The 1262 CE Sundha hill inscription of the Jalor Chahamana king Chachiga-deva states that the dynasty's ancestor Chahamana was \"a source of joy\" to the Vatsa. The 1320 Mount Abu (Achaleshwar temple) inscription of the Deora Chauhan ruler Lumbha states that Vatsa created the Chahamanas as a new lineage of warriors, after the solar dynasty and the lunar dynasty had ceased to exist.\n\nThe Ajmer inscription of the Shakambhari Chahamana ruler Vigraharaja IV (c. 1150–64 CE) claims that Chahamana belonged to the solar dynasty, descending from Ikshavaku and Rama. The 12th-century \"Prithviraja Vijaya\" mahakavya, composed by Prithviraja III's court poet Jayanaka, also claims a solar dynasty origin for the ruling dynasty. According to this text, Chahamana came to earth from \"Arkamandal\" (the orbit of the sun).\n\nThe 15th-century \"Hammira Mahakavya\" of Nayachandra Suri, which describes the life of the Ranthambore branch ruler Hammira, gives the following account: Once Brahma was wandering in search of an auspicious place to conduct a ritual sacrifice. He ultimately chose the place where a lotus from his hand fell; this place came to be known as Pushkara. Brahma wanted to protect his sacrificial ceremony against interference from danavas (miscreant beings). Therefore, he remembered the Sun, and a hero came into being from the sun's orb. This hero was Chohan, the ancestor of the Hammira's dynasty. The earliest extant recension of \"Prithviraj Raso\" of Chand Bardai, dated to 15th or 16th century, states that the first Chauhan king – Manikya Rai – was born from Brahma's sacrifice. The 16th-century \"Surjana-Charita\", composed by the Bengali poet Chandra Shekhara under patronage of the Ranthambore ruler Rao Surjana, contains a similar account. It states that Brahma created the first Chahamana from the Sun's disc during a sacrificial ceremony at Pushkara.\n\nDespite these earlier myths, it was the Agnivanshi (or Agnikula) myth that became most popular among the Chauhans and other Rajput clans. According to this myth, some of the Rajput clans originated from Agni, in a sacrificial fire pit. This legend was probably invented by the 10th-century Paramara court poet Padmagupta, whose \"Nava-sahasanka-charita\" mentions only the Paramaras as fire-born. The inclusion of Chauhans in the Agnivanshi myth can be traced back to the later recensions of \"Prithviraj Raso\". In this version of the legend, once Vashistha and other great sages begin a major sacrificial ceremony on Mount Abu. The ritual was interrupted by miscreant daityas (demons). To get rid of these demons, Vashistha created progenitors of three Rajput dynasties from the sacrificial fire pit. These were Parihar (Pratiharas), Chaluk (Chaulukya or Solanki), and Parmar (Paramara). These heroes were unable to defeat the demons. So, the sages prayed again, and this time a fourth warrior appeared: Chahuvana (Chauhan). This fourth hero slayed the demons.\n\nThe earliest available copies of \"Prithviraj Raso\" do not mention the Agnivanshi legend. It is possible that the 16th-century bards came up with the legend to foster Rajput unity against the Mughal emperor Akbar. Adaptions of the \"Prithviraj Raso\" occur in several later works. The \"Hammira Raso\" (1728 CE) by Jodharaja, a court poet of prince Chandrabhana of Neemrana, states that once the Kshatriyas (warriors) became extinct. So, the great sages assembled at Mount Abu and created three heroes. When these three heroes could not defeat the demons, they created Chahuvanaji. A slight variation occurs in the writings of Surya Malla Mishrana, the court poet of Bundi. In this version, the various gods create the four heroes on Vashistha's request. According to the bardic tale of the Khichi clan of Chauhans, the Parwar (Paramara) was born from Shiva's essence; the Solankhi (Solanki) or Chaluk Rao (Chalukya) was born from Brahma's essence; the Pariyar (Parihar) was born from Devi's essence; and the Chahuvan (Chauhan) was born from Agni, the fire.\n\nDenzil Ibbetson, an administrator of the British Raj, classified the Chauhans as a tribe rather than as a caste. He believed, like John Nesfield, that the society of the Northwest Frontier Provinces and Punjab in British India did not permit the rigid imposition of an administratively defined caste construct as his colleague, H. H. Risley preferred. According to Ibbetson, society in Punjab was less governed by Brahmanical ideas of caste, based on varna, and instead was more open and fluid. Tribes, which he considered to be kin-based groups that dominated small areas, were the dominant feature of rural life. Caste designators, such as Jat and Rajput, were status-based titles to which any tribe that rose to social prominence could lay a claim, and which could be dismissed by their peers if they declined. Susan Bayly, a modern anthropologist, considers him to have had \"a high degree of accuracy in his observations of Punjab society ... [I]n his writings we really do see the beginnings of modern, regionally based Indian anthropology.\"\n\nThe Chauhans were historically a powerful group in the region now known as Rajasthan. For around 400 years from the 7th century CE their strength in Sambhar was a threat to the power-base of the Guhilots in the south-west of the area, as also was the strength of their fellow Agnivanshi clans. They suffered a set-back in 1192 when their leader, Prithviraj Chauhan, was defeated at the Second Battle of Tarain but this did not signify their demise. The kingdom broke into the Satyapura and Devda branches after the invasion of Qutbu l-Din Aibak in 1197.\n\nThe earliest Chauhan inscription is a copper-plate inscription found at Hansot.\n\nThe ruling dynasties belonging to the Chauhan clan included:\n\n\nThe princely states ruled by families claiming Chauhan descent include:\n\n\n\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n"}

Ernst Rüdiger von Starhemberg fought in the 1660s under Imperial Lieutenant general Raimondo Montecuccoli against French and Ottoman forces.\n\nIn 1683 he was military commander of the city of Vienna, with fewer than 20,000 men to oppose about 120,000 besieging Ottomans. On 15 July 1683 Starhemberg refused an offer by the Turkish commander Kara Mustafa Pasha to capitulate, counting on the speedy arrival of an Imperial army, sent by the Habsburg emperor Leopold I who had fled his residence, and the strength of city walls which had been fortified after the first Ottoman Siege of Vienna in 1529.\n\nWhen after two months the relief army under the command of Polish king Jan Sobieski arrived in the first half of September, Vienna was on the brink of collapse. Its walls were breached by Turkish sappers who had tunnelled under the walls, packed the tunnels with gunpowder, and detonated the explosive charges. Finally, on 12 September, 80,000 Polish, Venetian, Bavarian, and Saxon troops attacked the Turks and were able to defeat them in the Battle on the Kahlenberg.\n\nErnst Rüdiger von Starhemberg was promoted to the rank of a field marshal by the Emperor, recognizing Starhemberg's action in saving the imperial capital. He was also made a minister of the state. Going after the retiring Ottoman troops, Starhemberg was severely wounded in 1686 during the Siege of Buda by a shot in his left hand and had to abandon his command. In 1691 he was made President of the Hofkriegsrat and was responsible for the organisation of the Habsburg army.\n\nStarhemberg died at Vösendorf on 4 January 1701, aged 62. His tomb (by Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach) is situated in the Vienna Schottenkirche.\n\nThe later Austrian politician Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg (1899-1956) was a collateral descendant.\n\nLater generations have idealized Starhemberg as saviour of the Western world and culture. By order of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, a statue was erected in his honour in 1872 at the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum in Vienna, where the Battle of Vienna is thoroughly documented, with Starhemberg's épée and armour on display.\n\nAdolf Schinzl: Starhemberg, Ernst Rüdiger Graf von.

It was licensed to Namco, who in turn licensed it to Atari, Inc. for release in the United States, thus the game is considered a successor to \"Pole Position II\". It was also released in the United Kingdom, Ireland and mainland Europe via Atari Ireland.\n\n\"TX-1\" placed a greater emphasis on realistic simulation racing than previous games in the genre, with details such as forcing players to brake or downshift the gear during corners to avoid the risk of losing control, and let go of the accelerator when going into a skid in order to regain control of the steering. It was also the first car driving game to use force feedback technology, which caused the steering wheel to vibrate, and the game also featured a unique three-screen arcade display for a more three-dimensional perspective of the track. It also introduced nonlinear gameplay by allowing players to choose which path to drive through after each checkpoint, eventually leading to one of eight possible final destinations.\n\nA sequel, \"TX-1 V8\", was released by Tatsumi in 1984 and was licensed to Namco, however this game was not licensed by Atari and was extremely rare in North America.\n\nThough \"TX-1\" used raster graphics similar to the 1982 release \"Pole Position\", developed by Namco and published by Atari, \"TX-1\" used a unique surround-style, sit-down three-screen display. In this design, the primary monitor was mounted directly in front of the steering wheel and a secondary monitor, angled at thirty degrees, was mounted both to the left and the right of the primary monitor. At the top of the left monitor was a display of the score and the car's current position; at the top of the right monitor was a running total of cars passed during the race. A display of stage, speed, and time remaining was at the top of the primary screen. The immense size of the cabinet limited the number of arcades which could display this game.\n\nGameplay was similar to \"Pole Position\", in that the player, piloting a Formula One racecar, needed to reach a check point in a certain period of time in order to continue playing. While negotiating the course, the driver needed to exercise caution in the turns, as excessive speed would cause the car to skid; additionally, the driver needed to pass slower cars carefully to avoid a fiery crash.\n\nUnlike \"Pole Position\", each stage ended at a branch point; depending on which way the driver turned, the course would be substantially different. The final two stages of this five-stage game were based upon famous Formula One races of the time and were identified by the name of the country; the path chosen during the previous three stages determined which \"races\" could be run in the final two stages. \"TX-1\" was a pioneer in this style of play, which would be copied by myriad other games, especially Sega's successful \"Out Run\" series.\n\n\n"}

The highway runs northeast from Muskegon to Hesperia. In between, the road passes through suburban Muskegon, forests and farmland. Some 5,900–26,000 vehicles use the highway each day on average as it runs long a series of roads that follow county lines in the area.\n\nThe current highway to bear the M-120 designation is the third in the state. The first was a spur route in the Lansing area in the 1930s. The second was a route that connected to like-numbered state highways in both Ohio and Indiana. The current M-120 was originally part of M-20 until that highway was rerouted between New Era and US Highway 31 (US 31).\n\nThe current route starts at Business US 31 (Bus. US 31) where Muskegon Lake and the Muskegon River meet in Muskegon. As it crosses the river, it is known as the Veterans Memorial Causeway, with a section of Veterans Memorial Park between the northbound and southbound sections of the road. This road continues north as Whitehall Road, which connects Muskegon to Whitehall. At Whitehall Road, M-120 turns east on Holton Road and continues in a northeastern direction through the suburb of North Muskegon. The south side of the roadway abuts residential areas and Reeths-Puffer High School; the north side is largely undeveloped. M-120 meets the US 31 freeway in Muskegon Township. Holton Road continues northeasterly past Oak Hill Cemetery and turns northerly at Bard Road. The highway curves to the northeast again through Twin Lake to avoid several lakes in the area. The landscape along the road between Twin Lake and Holton, like much of the overall route of the highway, is woodland. Northeast of Holton, those forests transition to farm land as M-120 turns to the north. The highway meets B-31 as it turns north to run along the Muskegon–Newaygo county line.\n\nAs M-120 continues north along the county line, it runs in Holton Township in Muskegon County to the west and Sheridan Township in Newaygo County to the east along Maple Island Road. West of Fremont, the highway meets an intersection with M-82 and B-86. B-86 runs along the Muskegon–Oceana county line, and M-82 runs along a township line in Newaygo County. North of this intersection, M-120 follows the Oceana–Newaygo county line that divides Greenwood Township from Dayton Township. Maple Island Road enters the south side of Hesperia on Division Street. M-120 terminates at an intersection with M-20 in the middle of the village, from its starting point.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) maintains M-120 like all other components of the Michigan state trunkline highway system. As part of these responsibilities, the department tracks traffic volumes along the highway. MDOT uses a metric called average annual daily traffic, which is a calculation of the traffic along a roadway segment for any average day of the year. In 2009, the highest traffic levels were near the southern terminus at 26,736 vehicles each day. The lowest levels MDOT calculated were in Holton at 5,936 vehicles daily. The section between the south end and US 31, M-120 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. The remainder of the highway has not been listed.\n\nThe M-120 designation was originally used on two different roadways in the state. In 1930, a road from US 16 for about a mile at the northwest corner of Lansing was numbered M-120. In early 1939, the M-174 designation replaced the M-120 moniker on the road. Later that year, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) used the number for a road along the Michigan-Ohio state line. This highway connected to State Route 120 on its east end at the state line and ran west to US 127 at Meridian Road along the Hillsdale–Lenawee county line. By the end of 1940, M-120 was extended through Hillsdale County to connect to State Road 120 along the short north–south Michigan–Indiana border. By the middle of 1961, the M-120 designation was retired by the MSHD again. The Ohio and Indiana SR 120 highways are still in place today with only the county road in Michigan connecting them.\n\nThe MSHD's successor, the Michigan Department of State Highways, realigned the route of M-20 through Western Michigan in 1969. In the aftermath of the reroute, the M-20 designation was moved from Muskegon to New Era. The former routing of M-20 south of Hesperia to Muskegon was renumbered M-120, including a segment that ran concurrently with M-82. That concurrency was removed in 1978.\n\n</table>\n\n"}

He also lent his voice to Pathe News's RKO newsreels. He was known for his gravelly voice and dramatic style, a \"whiskey tenor\" as sports announcer and executive David J. Halberstam has called it.\n\nMcCarthy was born Charles Louis McCarthy in East Bloomfield, New York. His father's work as a dealer and auctioneer of horses gave the young McCarthy frequent access to horse fairs and race tracks across the United States. Although he wanted to be a jockey, he grew too big and instead began reporting on horse writing in Southern California in the 1920s.\n\nAs Halberstam's book \"Sports on New York Radio\" notes, McCarthy is considered one of horse racing's great callers, setting the stage for well-known voices from Cawood Ledford to Dave Johnson. He was the first public-address announcer at a major American racetrack, Arlington Park in Arlington Heights, Illinois. Installation of a public address system there in 1927 provided that opportunity.\n\nIn addition to being a race caller for racetracks and NBC Radio, he was a top boxing announcer, too. His most often replayed boxing sportscast is probably his NBC radio call of the 1938 Joe Louis-Max Schmeling rematch at Yankee Stadium:\n\nLater that same year he called the famous Seabiscuit / War Admiral match race, including this phrase in the final stretch run, as Seabiscuit shocked the horse racing world by outrunning the heavily favored War Admiral:\n\nMcCarthy is also known for having mis-called the 1947 Preakness Stakes when a crowd standing on a platform blocked his view of the far turn, just as two horses with similar silks switched places. (Chic Anderson, one of McCarthy's most famous descendants as a track announcer, made a similar mistake in the 1975 Kentucky Derby.) As with Anderson later, McCarthy's quick and humble admission of the mistake helped the criticism eventually blow over. Years after McCarthy's death, sports film maker Bud Greenspan compared the audio of the race call with newsreel film of the race, and discovered that McCarthy had stated, \"...and the crowd blocks me for a moment...\" at the exact point where the two horses had switched places.\n\nMcCarthy's career also included work at local radio stations, beginning at KYW in Chicago in 1928. From there, he went to WMCA in New York City.\n\nIn 1929, McCarthy married vaudeville actress Vina Smith. They had no children, and they remained married until her death in 1954. He suffered serious injury in an automobile accident in 1957, and in his final years he had Parkinson's disease.\n\nMcCarthy died on June 4, 1962.\n\nThe National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association inducted McCarthy into its Hall of Fame in 1970. In 1987, McCarthy was inducted into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame along with veteran ABC Sports announcer Jim McKay.\n\nComedian Doodles Weaver mimicked McCarthy in his 1948 novelty recording (with Spike Jones) of the \"William Tell Overture\".\n\n\"Clem McCarthy, the Voice of American Sports\", an LP record, was produced in 1962.\n\n"}

He and his wife had one daughter.\n\nAccording to Professor Ivan Sutherland and Phong's friends, Phong was intelligent, affable and modest. About improving the quality of synthesized images he wrote, \"We do not expect to be able to display the object exactly as it would appear in reality, with texture, overcast shadows, etc. We hope only to display an image that approximates the real object closely enough to provide a certain degree of realism.\"\n\nTwo years after receiving his Ph.D., Phong died in 1975 of end-stage leukemia.\n\nPhong was the inventor of the Phong reflection model and the Phong shading interpolation method, techniques widely used in computer graphics. He published the description of the algorithms in his 1973 PhD dissertation and a 1975 paper.\n\nHe developed the first algorithm for simulating specular phenomena. When working on his doctorate, he was very focused on selecting a topic and completing his dissertation very fast. Professor David C. Evans very enthusiastically supported him in this project. Professor Ivan Sutherland worked with him for improving the previous Mach banding problems, and on using normals for shading. His fellow students also supported him very much, including James H. Clark, Franklin C. Crow, George Randall, Dennis Ting and John Riley. He finished his dissertation much faster than other students of the time did.\n\nPhong, Robert McDermott, Jim Clark and Raphael Rom had created the very first computer graphics generated picture that looked like its physical model: the Volkswagen Beetle. As a computer graphics icon, it still crops up in highly respected journals and animated features.\n\n"}

A major downturn in the price of tea in 2007 caused severe economic distress in the area. The price of Pu'er has since recovered and Pu'er tea still contributes much to the income of the area.\n\nThe settlement is named after pu'er tea, whose name it first took in 1729. Its name was changed to Simao in 1950 following the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, while its surrounding county was known as Pu'er. In 2007, the town's name was changed back to Pu'er; the surrounding area became known as Ning'er County; and the name Simao was taken by a town and district within the city. The change had an effect on the size of the official Pu'er tea production area, a major regional product.\n\nPu'er is located in southern/southwestern Yunnan, on the lower reaches of the Mekong (known in Chinese as the Lancang), with the bordering prefectures being Yuxi to the northeast, Honghe to the east, Xishuangbanna to the south, Lincang to the northwest, and Dali and Chuxiong.

It runs from Cedarville to Sault Ste. Marie. South of Nine Mile Road in Chippewa County (and in all of Mackinac County), M-129 overlays the Michigan Meridian. The section of M-129 that overlays the meridian is named Meridian Road. The highway between M-48 and the northern terminus is a part of the larger Lake Huron Circle Tour.\n\nOriginally a part of M-12 and US Highway 2 (US 2), the current roadway was formerly designated M-5 from 1930 until 1939. Two other highways were also previously designated M-129. The first was in the western UP in the late 1920s; it was replaced by M-64. The second was in the Keweenaw Peninsula and was replaced by M-26.\n\nM-129 starts at an intersection between Meridian Road and M-134 in Cedarville. This intersection is northwest of Lake Huron and a ferry connection to the long La Salle Island, part of Les Cheneaux Islands. The islands are a quiet tourist destination that \"Hunt's Guide to Michigan's Upper Peninsula\" describes as \"off the beaten tourist track\" and full of \"low-key charm\". From here north, M-129 follows the Michigan Meridian on Meridian Road. The highway forms part of the north–south Mackinac–Chippewa county line as it approaches the community of Pickford. South of Pickford, M-129 and M-48 merge along Meridian Road at 26 Mile Road. M-129 picks up the Lake Huron Circle Tour designation and the two roads cross together over the Munuscong River, which empties into Munuscong Lake, a part of the St. Marys River. These two highways run concurrently through Pickford to 22 Mile Road.\n\nAt 22 Mile Road, M-48 turns westerly and M-129 continues north. This intersection is also the location of the Munscong Golf Club. M-129 meets the eastern termini of M-80 and M-28 at 17 Mile Road and 9 Mile Road, respectively. Just before meeting 9 Mile Road, M-129 jogs to the east, leaving Meridian Road to meet up with McKnight Road, which runs parallel to the Michigan Meridian. McKnight Road and I-75 run roughly parallel approaching Sault Ste. Marie from the south. At 3 Mile Road, M-129 enters the city of Sault Ste. Marie east of the southern terminus of BS I-75, and the roadway is renamed Ashmun Street. When BS I-75 meets Ashmun Street, M-129 ends and BS I-75 takes over the Ashmun Street name into downtown. M-129 ends south of the Lake Superior State University campus, home of the annual Banished Words List.\n\nThe modern M-129 was originally part of M-12 from 1919 until 1926 and US 2 from 1926 to 1933.\n\nThe first usage of M-129 on a highway in Michigan was on a roadway connecting Lake Gogebic State Park to Marenisco and south to the Wisconsin state line; this routing was designated M-64 in 1930. The second usage was for a highway in the Keweenaw Peninsula connecting Phoenix with Eagle Harbor. This second designation was extended in 1933 to Copper Harbor and replaced by M-26 in 1935.\n\nM-5 was used as the designation for the former US 2 in Mackinac and Chippewa counties until 1939, when it was redesignated as M-129 on maps. The last gravel sections of roadway were paved in 1960 south of Sault Ste. Marie, and the highway was truncated to end at M-134 in Cedarville in 1963. Previous to this, the highway continued south into downtown Cedarville on Merdian Road. A small realignment moved the northern terminus to a new intersection with BS I-75 in Sault Ste. Marie in late 1967.\n\n"}

The two went on to form the now legendary Rustic Overtones, and formed PSC after the original demise of Rustic Overtones in 2002.\nThe recurring \"Axis\" theme in the band's album titles began as a joke that tied in nicely with band's name. PSC's debut release, Axis II refers to personality disorders, including paranoia. The theme continued when the band released the double album Axis I & III, with Axis I disorders dealing with clinical syndromes and Axis III disorders being acute physical conditions. Axis IV disorders are brought on by direct physical and environmental factors.

{"id": "1858892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858892", "title": "Exiles (play)", "text": "Exiles (play)\n\nExiles is James Joyce's only extant play and draws on the story of \"The Dead\", the final short story in Joyce's story collection \"Dubliners\". The play was rejected by W. B. Yeats for production by the Abbey Theatre. Its first major London performance was in 1970, when Harold Pinter directed it at the Mermaid Theatre.\n\nIn terms of both its critical and popular reception, \"Exiles\" has proven the least successful of all of Joyce's published works. In making his case for the defence of the play, Padraic Colum conceded: \"...critics have recorded their feeling that [\"Exiles\"] has not the enchantment of \"Portrait of the Artist\" nor the richness of [\"Ulysses\"]... They have noted that \"Exiles\" has the shape of an Ibsen play and have discounted it as being the derivative work of a young admirer of the great Scandinavian dramatist.\"\n\nJoyce himself described the structure of the play as \"three cat and mouse acts\".\nThe play follows four players and two couples, Richard Rowan, a writer and his \"common-law wife\" Bertha, and Robert Hand with his cousin and previous lover Beatrice, both old friends of the previous couple.\n“The plot is deceptively simple: Richard, a writer, returns to Ireland from Rome with Bertha, the mother of his illegitimate son, Archie. While there, he meets his former lover and correspondent Beatrice Justice and former drinking partner and now successful journalist Robert Hand. Robert was also Beatrice’s lover, and here the complications begin.\" \n\nAs jealousy develops throughout the relationships the action meditates mostly in a budding relationship between Hand and Bertha and thus in Hand's attempts at seduction with the lover of his friend.\n\nThe first act takes place at Rowan's house where Hand makes his first advance at Bertha. After kissing her \"with passion\" several times Hand requests she join him in his home for a second meeting later that evening. Bertha in turn confides in Rowan and questions whether or not to accept his invitation. To this, Rowan retorts she must do whatever she pleases.\n\nIn the second act, Hand waits, expecting Bertha at the appointed hour but instead is surprised when Rowan appears. Calmly, Rowan explains his knowledge of Hand's attempts at wooing Bertha but is interrupted when Bertha herself knocks at the door. Rowan returns home, leaving his wife alone with Hand who continues his advances toward Bertha. The act ends inconclusively, with Hand asking if Bertha loves him, and Bertha explaining: \"I like you, Robert. I think you are good... Are you satisfied?\"\n\nThe third act returns to Rowan's home at seven o'clock the following morning. Bertha's maid informs her of Rowan's departure from the home an hour earlier, as he left for a walk on the strand. Printed in the morning newspapers is a favourable article written about Rowan, written the previous evening by Hand himself.\n\nThe events of the previous night between Bertha and Hand are unclear, as both parties agree it was a \"dream.\" But appearances demonstrate Hand and Bertha shared \"a sacred night of love.\"\n\nHand reports to Rowan, assuring him Bertha in fact did not stay the night but instead Hand spent the night alone. Claiming to have visited the Vice-Chancellor's lodge, returned home to write the newspaper article, then gone to a nightclub where he picked up a divorcée and had sex with her (\"what the subtle Duns Scotus calls a death of the spirit took place\") in the cab on the way home. Following this conversation, Hand leaves his cousin's house in Surrey while Rowan and Bertha are reconciled. Bertha admits that she longs to meet her lover, but asserts that the lover is Rowan himself.\n\nThe resolution of the play lies precisely in the sense of doubt about what occurred between Hand and Bertha between Acts Two and Three. Rowan is wounded by the sense of doubt that he admits he longed for. Indeed, he sees this sense of doubt as what enables him \"to be united with [Bertha] in body and soul in utter nakedness\".\n\nThere are obvious parallels to be drawn with Joyce's own life – Joyce and Nora Barnacle lived, unmarried, in Trieste, during the years the fictional Rowans were living in Rome. During this time, Joyce and his lover considered themselves to be living in Exile, directly mirroring the setting of \"Exiles\".\n\nRobert Hand too, draws a connection to Joyce's personal life as he resembles two friends of Joyce's, Oliver St. John Gogarty and Vincent Cosgrave, and even shares a few defining characteristics with them both.\nSimilarly, the character of Beatrice Justice has been said to reflect a cousin of Joyce's, Elizabeth Justice, who died in 1912.\n\nHowever, \"Exiles\" is by no means straightforwardly autobiographical.\n\n\"The great question which Joyce sought to use as the basis for a drama was that of human freedom and human dignity. It is exposed and focused in terms of love and sexual relationships.\"\"\n\n\"Exiles\" was forced into publication before production, despite the best efforts of both Joyce and Ezra Pound, to whom Joyce had shown the transcript in the fall of 1915. The production eventually premiered in Munich to largely unfavorable reviews.\n\nHarold Pinter’s staging of \"Exiles\" in 1970 received greater praise, with many critics claiming that the play had been “revived.” A 2006 production directed by James Macdonald at the National Theatre also enjoyed a positive reception. Some critics have claimed that \"Exiles\" may have been reviewed poorly in its time due to Joyce’s progressive ideas about love and relationships.\n\n"}

The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs defeating the Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons 4 games to 3 in the NBA Finals. Tim Duncan was named Finals MVP.\n\nThe NBA Finals marked the first time since 1987 that the two previous champions met in the Finals (the Spurs won in 2003, the Pistons in 2004). For the Spurs, it was their third title (they also won in the lockout-shortened season of 1998–99).\n\nThe Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards ended long playoff droughts in 2005, meeting each other in the first round. For Washington it was their first playoff appearance since 1997 (and even more ironic their opponents for that postseason appearance were the Bulls who swept them on their way to their fifth NBA title), and only their second since 1988. Their 4–2 series victory over the Bulls was their first since 1982.\n\nThe Miami Heat became the first team to go 8–0 through the first two rounds after the first round was made into a best-of-7 in the 2003 playoffs. The 2009 Cavaliers, 2010 Magic, 2012 Spurs, 2016 Cavaliers, 2017 Cavaliers and the 2017 Warriors followed suit. No team (until 2016) has made the finals after going 8–0 in the first two rounds, let alone win 12 straight games going to the NBA Finals (until the 2017 Warriors), though the Spurs came close in 2012 when they won their first 10 playoff games, then lost their next four to the Oklahoma City Thunder. In 2016, the Cleveland Cavaliers became the first team to go 8–0 through the first two rounds and make the NBA Finals. In 2017, the Golden State Warriors became the second team to go 8–0 through the first two rounds and make the NBA Finals as well as going 16–1 in the playoffs, the best winning percentage (.941) in NBA postseason history.\n\nIt was the Bulls' first post-Michael Jordan playoff appearance, as their last playoff game was Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. They consistently placed at or near the bottom of the Central Division in between, but their 47–35 season in 2005 was a 24-game improvement from 2004.\n\nFor the 3rd straight year (5th overall) the Pacers met the Celtics in the first round. Boston won in 2003 4–2, while Indiana swept Boston in 2004. It would be Boston's last playoff appearance until 2008.\n\nFor the Los Angeles Lakers, it marked the first time in 11 seasons (dating back to 1994) and the fifth time in NBA history that they missed the playoffs. This is also the most recent time when the playoffs were played entirely outside of Los Angeles.\n\nThis was the last time that the Seattle SuperSonics would be in the playoffs before they relocated to Oklahoma to become the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns won their first playoff series since 2000 and advanced to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 1993, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs in five games.\n\nUntil 2019, this was the last NBA playoffs not to feature LeBron James as a player as his team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, missed the playoffs.\n\nBeginning with the 2004–05 season, with the addition of the 30th NBA franchise, the Charlotte Bobcats, the NBA realigned its divisions. Each conference now has three divisions of five teams each, and at this point in time, the winner of each division was guaranteed a top three playoff seed, regardless of whether the team had one of the top eight records in its conference. However, the division champion was not guaranteed home court advantage; a division-leading team with a poor record could be ranked number three but face a sixth seed with a better record, which would then have home court advantage.

She grew up in an era of political and social turmoil – the time of the Tây Sơn rebellion and a three-decade civil war that led to Nguyễn Ánh seizing power as Emperor Gia Long and starting the Nguyễn dynasty. She wrote poetry using chữ nôm (Southern Script), which adapts Chinese characters for writing demotic Vietnamese. She is considered to be one of Vietnam's greatest classical poets. Xuân Diệu, a prominent modern poet, dubbed her \"The Queen of Nôm poetry\".\n\nThe facts of her life are difficult to verify, but this much is well established: she was born in Nghệ An Province near the end of the rule of the Trịnh lords, and moved to Hanoi while still a child. The best guess is that she was the youngest daughter of Ho Phi Dien.\n\nAccording to the first researchers of Hồ Xuân Hương, such as Nguyen Huu Tien and Duong Quang Ham, she was a daughter of a Ho Phi Dien (born in 1704) in Quynh Doi Village, Quynh Luu District, Nghệ An Province (*). Ho Phi Dien acquired the baccalaureate diploma at the age of 24, under Le Bao Thai's Dynasty. Due to his family's poverty, he had to work as a tutor in Hai Hung, Ha Bac for his earnings. At that place, he cohabitated with a girl from Bac Ninh, his concubine – Hồ Xuân Hương was born as a result of that love affair.\n\nNevertheless, in a paper in \"Literature Magazine\" (No. 10, Hanoi 1964), Tran Thanh Mai claims that Hồ Xuân Hương's hometown was the same as mentioned above, but she was a daughter of Ho Si Danh (1706–1783) and a younger stepsister of Ho Si Dong (1738–1786)\"\n\nShe became locally famous and obtained a reputation of creating poems that were subtle and witty. She is believed to have married twice as her poems refer to two different husbands: Vinh Tuong (a local official) and Tong Coc (a slightly higher level official). She was the second-rank wife of Tong Coc, in Western terms, a concubine, a role that she was clearly not happy with (\"like the maid/but without the pay\"). However, her second marriage did not last long as Tong Coc died just six months after the wedding.\n\nShe lived the remainder of her life in a small house near the West Lake in Hanoi. She had visitors, often fellow poets, including two specifically named men: Scholar Ton Phong Thi and a man only identified as \"The Imperial Tutor of the Nguyễn Family.\" She was able to make a living as a teacher and evidently was able to travel since she composed poems about several places in Northern Vietnam.\n\nA single woman in a Confucian society, her works show her to be independent-minded and resistant to societal norms, especially through her socio-political commentaries and her use of frank sexual humor and expressions. Her poems are usually irreverent, full of double entendres, and erudite.\n\nBy composing the vast majority of her works in Nôm, she helped to elevate the status of Vietnamese as a literary language. Recently, however, some of her poems have been found which were composed in classical Chinese, indicating that she was not a purist. In modern times, Chữ nôm is nearly a dead script, having been supplanted by Quốc Ngữ, a Latin alphabet introduced during the period of French colonization. For details, see Vietnamese language. Some of her poems were collected and translated into English in John Balaban's \"Spring Essence\" (Copper Canyon Press, 2000, ).\n\nAn important Vietnamese poet and her contemporary is Nguyễn Du, who similarly wrote poetry in demotic Vietnamese, and so helped to found a national literature.\n\nA few cities in Vietnam have streets named after Hồ Xuân Hương.\n\n\"My body is like a jackfruit swinging on a tree, <br>\nMy skin is rough, my pulp is thick. <br>\nDear prince, if you want me then pierce me upon your stick <br>\nDon't squeeze, i'll ooze and stain your hands.\" <br>\n\nBecause I pitied, this happened, <br>\nI wonder if he knows? <br>\nOur match had not begun <br>\nWhen fate intervened. <br>\nThe sin he will have to bear, for a hundred years - <br>\nRight now, love's burden is all mine. <br>\n\nÐằng Kingdom is now a small place <br>\nBetween Sở and Tề. <br>\n\nGently Spring evening comes to the pavilion, <br>\nUnclouded in the least by worldly sins. <br>\nThree times the temple's bell surges like a wave <br>\nUnsettling the puddle where sky and water mingle. <br>\nTruly the sea of Love cannot be emptied <br>\nAnd the stream of Grace flows easily everywhere. <br>\nNow, where, where is Nirvana? <br>\nNirvana's here, nine parts in ten. <br>\n\nIn the empire building game Europa Universalis IV, the introduction Hồ Xuân Hương and her \"The Jackfruit\" will probably appear in the game after the player occupies Hanoi for a while.\n\n\n"}

American explorer and author Jeremiah N. Reynolds published his account, \"Mocha Dick: Or The White Whale of the Pacific: A Leaf from a Manuscript Journal\" in 1839 in \"The Knickerbocker\". Mocha Dick was an albino and partially inspired Herman Melville's 1851 novel \"Moby-Dick\".\n\nMocha Dick survived many skirmishes (by some accounts at least 100) with whalers before he was eventually killed. He was large and powerful, capable of wrecking small craft with his fluke. Explorer Jeremiah N. Reynolds gathered first-hand observations of Mocha Dick and published his account, \"Mocha Dick: Or The White Whale of the Pacific: A Leaf from a Manuscript Journal\", in the May 1839 issue of \"The Knickerbocker\". Reynolds described Mocha Dick as \"an old bull whale, of prodigious size and strength... \"white as wool\". According to Reynolds, the Mocha Dicks' head was covered with barnacles, which gave him a rugged appearance. The whale also had a peculiar method of spouting:\n\nMocha Dick was most likely first encountered and attacked sometime before 1810 off Mocha Island. His survival of the first encounters coupled with his unusual appearance quickly made him famous among Nantucket whalers. Many captains attempted to hunt him after rounding Cape Horn. Mocha Dick was quite docile, sometimes swimming alongside the ship, but once attacked he retaliated with ferocity and cunning, and was widely feared by harpooners. When agitated he would sound and then breach so aggressively that his entire body would sometimes come completely out of the water.\n\nIn Reynolds' account, Mocha Dick was killed in 1838, after he appeared to come to the aid of a distraught cow whose calf had just been slain by the whalers. His body was 70 feet long and yielded 100 barrels of oil, along with some ambergris—a substance used in the making of perfumes and at times worth more per ounce than gold. He also had nineteen harpoons in his body.\n\nA decade later, \"The Knickerbocker\" reported another sighting of Mocha Dick in the Arctic Ocean, concluding \"Vive 'Mocha Dick'!\".\n\nMocha Dick was not, apparently, the only white whale in the sea. A Swedish whaler claimed to have taken a very old white whale off the coast of Brazil in 1859. In 1902, the New Bedford whaling bark \"Platina\", captained by Thomas McKenzie, harpooned and killed an albino sperm whale near the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean, using a harpoon tipped with an explosive device. Amos Smalley harpooned the white whale and recounted his experience to \"Reader's Digest\". He remembers Captain McKenzie estimating by the wear on the whale's teeth that it was \"at least a hundred years old, maybe two hundred\". Smalley was a guest at the premiere of John Huston's film \"Moby Dick\", 1956, where he was introduced as \"the man who killed Moby Dick\".\n\nIn 1952, \"Time\" Magazine reported the harpooning of a white whale off the coast of Peru. Since 1991, there have been sightings reported of a white humpback whale near Australia, nicknamed Migaloo. In 2012, a white humpback, nicknamed Willow the White Whale, was filmed off the coast of Norway. Sightings of white sperm whales have been recorded off Sardinia in the Mediterranean Sea in 2006 and 2015.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1858922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858922", "title": "Illinois Tollway oasis", "text": "Illinois Tollway oasis\n\nAn Illinois Tollway oasis is a type of commercialized rest area sited over Interstate Highways that are part of the Illinois Tollway system in northern Illinois, United States. The seven oases offer food and gasoline vendors and are found in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, DeKalb, and Belvidere. Although the oases date back to the original tollway construction in 1958, they were redeveloped in 2003–2005 by Wilton Partners, a private developer. The redevelopment of the oases has been the focal point of alleged political corruption. The seven oases are administered by a court-appointed manager following default of Wilton Partners.\n\nAs is typical for rest stops on toll highways, these areas are full service, or \"commercialized\", as a result of concessions awarded by the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA).\n\nIn 2011, over 11.8 million people visited the seven oases. These facilities in Illinois have gas stations (Mobil) with 24-hour automated car washes, fast food restaurants (McDonald's, Panda Express, Subway, etc.) and other various shops (such as Krispy Kreme, Starbucks, Coleman Distributors, and TravelMart). Oases also have automatic teller machines. Six of the oases are built as a bridge-restaurant, directly over the Interstate Highway they service. The oasis in DeKalb is the only exception, with the facility located along the southern (eastbound) side of Interstate 88, and a vehicle overpass allows westbound traffic to access a segregated parking lot and gas station along one side of the facility. All the oases provide free WiFi access for visitors. The oases have a drive-thru lane for the McDonald's. All oases, except for the Hinsdale and DeKalb oases, have Tollway Customer Service Centers, where I-Pass toll transponders are sold and serviced. The oases have a total of of retail space. As of 2009, the oases were 45 percent to 65 percent vacant. ISTHA has established a special task force to study the oases' future.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Transportation has proposed a route for a new limited access highway on the west side of O'Hare Airport which would connect with the Jane Addams Tollway at the site of the Des Plaines Oasis. The oasis there will be demolished for the new road. As such, the Des Plaines Oasis was closed on March 16, 2014; this allowed vendor contents to be removed and demolition to proceed.\n\nThe Tollway announced plans to widen the Tri State Tollway, which will result in the closure of the Hinsdale Oasis and has already resulted in the closure of the O'Hare Oasis.\n\nThe five original oases were built in conjunction with the original tollway construction in 1959. They featured Standard Oil (Amoco) gas stations and Fred Harvey restaurants, and were something of a novelty in the region—becoming destinations in and of themselves for driving customers. Because the Illinois State Toll Highway Commission (ISTHC) did not have the money to build the oases, they were built and paid for by the American Oil Company, which operated the Amoco/Standard Oil service stations and also sub-leased the restaurant areas to the Fred Harvey restaurant chain. The title of the oases reverted to the ISTHC after the original 25-year operating contract ended. During this initial operating period the state received 2.51 cents for each gallon of gas sold as well as 10% of the restaurant profits.\n\nThe Lincoln Oasis was added in 1968 and was different from the previous five oases in that it was an all-steel building designed by architect David Haid, a one-time student and employee of architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The DeKalb Oasis opened in 1975 and was different from the prior six in that it was the only one of seven oases to not be constructed over the tollway. In the mid-1970s, Howard Johnson's took over the restaurants. One of the oases made an appearance on the silver screen when Carrie Fisher attacks The Blues Brothers at the Des Plaines Oasis in the 1980 film. In 1984, individual fast food restaurants took over from Howard Johnson, with the oases on I-90 and I-88 and the Hinsdale on I-294 being run by McDonald's and the oases on I-294 alternating between Wendy's and Burger King.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005, an extensive renovation program of the oases was completed, which involved demolishing the old structures down to the bridge deck and replacing them with new buildings. Where in the previous buildings the views of the highways were blocked by the vendor restaurants, in the new buildings large expanses of glass are used to create a sense of openness, and to give patrons better views of the highway. The steel truss design also has greater roof height (nearly ) than the old buildings, which increases visibility for the oases. The architects for the project were Cordogan Clark & Associates. The gas stations were rebuilt with canopies to cover the gas pumps. The oases were redeveloped at no cost to the ISTHA or the Illinois taxpayers. The $95 million investment was provided by Wilton Partners of Los Angeles, California and ExxonMobil in exchange for a 25-year lease. Under the lease, Wilton would pay ISTHA a percentage of vendor sales with a minimum of $750,000 per year.\n\nThe lease agreements between ISTHA, Wilton Partners, and various vendors have come under investigation by U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald. This investigation, reported on December 30, 2005, will determine if a conflict of interest existed between the lessees and a political fund-raiser for Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich (Antoin Rezko). DuPage County State's Attorney Joe Birkett had also requested documents pertaining to these leases earlier in 2005. According to the \"Chicago Tribune\", the Subway restaurants in two oases are managed by the nephew of Tony Rezko, a controversial political fundraiser. In response, tollway spokesmen noted that Wilton Partners was selected during the administration of Governor George Ryan and that the lease gives Wilton discretion to select the individual vendors.\n\nNews accounts quoted businessmen who claimed that Jay Wilton, the President of Wilton Partners, encouraged them to donate funds to Blagojevich's 2003 gubernatorial campaign. In December 2003, Wilton Partners reportedly gave Rezko's Panda Express franchise a 50% reduction in its rent at the oases. In January 2007, Wilton stopped making required payments to ISTHA for the oases, and by February 2008, when the back rent grew to $1.4 million, Wilton and ISTHA entered into settlement negotiations. However, in July 2008, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan rejected a proposed settlement where ISTHA would forgo the $1.4 million in back rent in exchange for Wilton dropping a claim of $4.7 million for lost business due to tollway construction. In the spring of 2009, Wilton Partners' lender, iStar Financial, foreclosed on the oases. Subsequently, the court appointed U.S. Equities, a Chicago firm, to manage the oases pending the outcome of the foreclosure. Further, another food vendor operating in all seven oases who donated to Blagojevich has also received press attention for failure to pay sales taxes and state unemployment insurance. In 2010, SFI Chicago Tollway LLC became the oases' operator. In 2012, SFI paid the Tollway $813,000 for a long-term lease to operate all seven oases, excluding the fuel stations and convenience stores operated by 7-Eleven.\n\nOn December 9, 2009, a truck driver standing at the gas station parking lot of the Belvidere oasis was killed when debris thrown by an explosion at an adjacent factory struck him. The six-story factory building was hundreds of feet away from the oasis.\n\nOn September 26, 2013, ISTHA announced that the Des Plaines Oasis over the Jane Addams Tollway would be closed in April 2014. The structure was demolished to make way for the widening of the toll road and the O'Hare West Bypass.\n\nAdditionally, ISTHA has proposed rebuilding and widening the Central Tri-State Tollway (I-294) to five lanes in each direction with a wide shoulder that could be used as a \"flex lane\". Under these plans, the Hinsdale and O'Hare Oasis will have to be demolished in order to make room for the wider road. On September 5, 2018 the O'Hare oasis closed to prepare for the widening project. They haven't announced the closure date for the Hinsdale Oasis.\n\nThe oases are spread along the tollway system, with each oasis serving traffic in both directions. The Lincoln Oasis is strategically placed to serve east-west traffic crossing Illinois on Interstate 80. The DeKalb Oasis serves traffic crossing Illinois on Interstate 88, and the Belvidere Oasis serves traffic travelling between Madison, Wisconsin, and Chicago on Interstate 90. The O'Hare Oasis also benefits from serving traffic, including returning rental cars, associated with O'Hare Airport. The only tollways that do not have any oases are the Veterans Memorial Tollway (Interstate 355) and the Elgin–O'Hare Tollway (Illinois Route 390), which were designed to serve local traffic and opened decades after the other tollways and oases were built. On March 16, 2014, the Des Plaines Oasis closed as part of construction on the Elgin–O'Hare Expressway expansion. On September 5, 2018, The O'Hare Oasis closed to make way for Tri State Tollway widening. The Hinsdale Oasis is also scheduled to close on a future date as well.\n\n"}

No doubt in both cases, lobbying by the pharmaceutical industries influenced the inclusion of a requirement to place some scientific and medical experts on the board. However, the influence of Harry J. Anslinger and his Canadian counterpart Charles Henry Ludovic Sharman, both narcotics control officials, could be seen in the decision to allow the Commission to select some members (thus allowing law enforcement officials to be appointed to the Supervisory Body).\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the drug control treaties, the revisions instituted by the Protocol did not require ratification to enter into force. For each party, the treaty entered into force immediately upon their (a) signature without reservation as to approval, (b) signature subject to approval followed by acceptance or (c) acceptance. Since there were far fewer independent nations in the 1940s than there are today, the Protocol's initial 40 parties – including populous empires and unions such as the United Kingdom and Soviet Union – encompassed the vast majority of the world's population. As of 2013, the Protocol has 62 state parties; of the ratifying states, the Netherlands has denounced the treaty.\n\nThe Protocol was superseded by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, except as it affected the 1936 Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs.

NBS can be a convenient source of Br, the bromine radical.\n\nNBS is commercially available. It can also be synthesized in the laboratory. To do so, sodium hydroxide and bromine are added to an ice-water solution of succinimide. The NBS product precipitates and can be collected by filtration.\n\nCrude NBS gives better yield in the Wohl-Ziegler reaction. In other cases, impure NBS (slightly yellow in color) may give unreliable results. It can be purified by recrystallization from 90–95 °C water (10 g of NBS for 100 mL of water).\n\nNBS will react with alkenes 1 in aqueous solvents to give bromohydrins 2. The preferred conditions are the portionwise addition of NBS to a solution of the alkene in 50% aqueous DMSO, DME, THF, or \"tert\"-butanol at 0 °C. Formation of a bromonium ion and immediate attack by water gives strong Markovnikov addition and \"anti\" stereochemical selectivities.\n\nSide reactions include the formation of α-bromoketones and dibromo compounds. These can be minimized by the use of freshly recrystallized NBS.\n\nWith the addition of nucleophiles, instead of water, various bifunctional alkanes can be synthesized.\n\nStandard conditions for using NBS in allylic and/or benzylic bromination involves refluxing a solution of NBS in anhydrous CCl with a radical initiator—usually azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) or benzoyl peroxide, irradiation, or both to effect radical initiation. The allylic and benzylic radical intermediates formed during this reaction are more stable than other carbon radicals and the major products are allylic and benzylic bromides. This is also called the Wohl–Ziegler reaction.\n\nThe carbon tetrachloride must be maintained anhydrous throughout the reaction, as the presence of water may likely hydrolyze the desired product. Barium carbonate is often added to maintain anhydrous and acid-free conditions.\n\nIn the above reaction, while a mixture of isomeric allylic bromide products are possible, only one is created due to the greater stability of the 4-position radical over the methyl-centered radical.\n\nNBS can α-brominate carbonyl derivatives via either a radical pathway (as above) or via acid-catalysis. For example, hexanoyl chloride 1 can be brominated in the alpha-position by NBS using acid catalysis.\n\nThe reaction of enolates, enol ethers, or enol acetates with NBS is the preferred method of α-bromination as it is high-yielding with few side-products.\n\nElectron-rich aromatic compounds, such as phenols, anilines, and various aromatic heterocycles, can be brominated using NBS. Using DMF as the solvent gives high levels of para-selectivity.\n\nNBS, in the presence of a strong base, such as DBU, reacts with primary amides to produce a carbamate via the Hofmann rearrangement.\n\nIt is uncommon, but possible for NBS to oxidize alcohols. E. J. Corey \"et al.\" found that one can selectively oxidize secondary alcohols in the presence of primary alcohols using NBS in aqueous dimethoxyethane (DME).\n\nNBS electrophilically brominates the amine, which is followed by decarboxylation and release of an imine. Further hydrolysis will yield an aldehyde and ammonia. (cf. non-oxidative PLP dependent decarboxylation)\n\nAlthough NBS is easier and safer to handle than bromine, precautions should be taken to avoid inhalation. NBS should be stored in a refrigerator. NBS will decompose over time giving off bromine. Pure NBS is white, but it is often found to be off-white or brown colored by bromine.\n\nIn general, reactions involving NBS are exothermic. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken when used on a large scale.\n\n\n"}

It is located in the valley of the Daxia River (a right tributary of the Yellow River), (by road) southwest of the provincial capital Lanzhou.\n\nThe population of the entire county-level city of Linxia (which includes both the central city and some rural area) is estimated at 250,000; of which, 58.4% is classified as urban population. According to the prefectural government, 51.4% of Linxia City's population belongs to the \"Hui nationality\", i.e. the Chinese-speaking Muslims. Some members of Linxia Prefecture other minority ethnic groups, such as Bonan, Dongxiang and Salar, live in the city.\n\nFor centuries, Hezhou/Linxia has been one of the main religious, cultural and commercial centers of China's Muslim community, earning itself the nickname of \"the little Mecca of China\".\nIt remains the main center of China's Qadiriyyah and Khufiyya Sufi orders; it was also the home of Ma Mingxin, the founder of the Jahriyya order, although that order's \"center of gravity\" has shifted elsewhere since.\n\nAdministratively, Linxia City is an incorporated county-level city. Unlike many Chinese county-level cities, which include a county-size expanse of the countryside, the boundaries of Linxia City include only a fairly small area (88.6 km), stretched along the Daxia River, which in this region flows towards the northeast. The wide fertile valley of the river is flanked by loess plateau escarpments on both sides, and the countryside beyond these limits, to the northwest and southeast of the valley, belongs to a separate administrative unit, called Linxia County. Linxia City borders on Linxia County in the southwest as well, but in the northeast it has a short border with Dongxiang Autonomous County.\n\nThe main urban area of Linxia City (i.e., the city proper) is located roughly in the center of the city's administrative boundaries, on the left (northwestern) bank of the Daxia River. Administratively, the County-level City of Linxia is divided into 10 township-level units: 6 \"jiedao\" within the main urban area, and four towns (formerly, townships) in the adjacent rural and semi-rural areas upstream and downstream of the central city and across the river from it.\n\nThe central business district of Linxia City, corresponding to the former walled city of Hezhou, is located a couple of kilometers to the north of the Daxia River, and contains the city's more upscale shopping and entertainment precincts, as well as the prefectural government. The old city wall is gone, but its existence is remembered in many place names: Xi Guan Lu (\"West Gate Street\"), Chengjiao ([SW] \"Corner of the City Wall\") Mosque, Nanmen Guangchang (\"South Gate Square\") with Nanguan (\"South Gate\") Mosque, Dongguan (\"East Gate\") neighborhood, Bei Chengjiao Gongbei (\"The \"Gongbei\" at the Northern Corner of the City Wall\", a.k.a. Yu Baba Gongbei). A small river, called Hongshui He, flows along what must have been the southern part of the city wall. The main street within this central area is Tuanjie Lu (\"Unity Street\"), running north–south.\n\nThe area between the former south gate (Nanguan) and to the Daxia River is primarily commercial, with vibrant markets taking up much of the street space on market days. Beyond Nanguan, Tuanjie Lu becomes Jiefang Lu (\"Liberation St\"), and, after reaching the river, it continues south as Provincial Highway 309.\n\nMany of the city's mosques and \"gongbei\" shrines are located in the historically Muslim district to the west and southwest of the city center. Hongyuan Square, with Hongyuan Park, the Prefecture Museum, and a sports complex are in this area as well.\n\nThe northeast of this city is mostly a modern multi-story residential area. Campuses of a number of educational institutions as well as the local garrison compound are located there.\n\nA major landmark of Linxia City is the Taoist temple, Wanshou Guan. Its pagoda is perched on top of the loess plateau bluff that forms the natural northern limit for the city expansion. Great views of the city open from the bluff, and the pagoda can be seen from everywhere in the city as well.\n\nIn the past, Linxia City was called Hezhou (), and the surrounding area was sometimes known as Hezhou Prefecture.\n\nThroughout its history, Hezhou often was the crossing of important trade routes: one of the alternative paths of the east-way Silk Route, connecting China's heartland with Central Asia, and the north–south route linking Mongolia and Tibet.\nDuring parts of the Song Dynasty period, when the Western Xia took control of the more northerly path of the Silk Route, the more southerly Didao-Hezhou-Xining alternative path of the Silk Route may have become particularly important, making all three cities important commercial centers. Historians think that it was then, during the Song Dynasty, that the Muslims of Hezhou probably built their first mosque.\n\nHezhou was already an important Islamic center in the 1670s, when the Kashgarian Sufi master Āfāq Khoja made his tour of the Muslim communities of Qing Empire's northwestern borderlands. While his preaching in Xining, Didao and Lanzhou is better documented, he most likely preached in Hezhou as well.\nIn any event, both Āfāq Khoja's Chinese disciple Ma Tai Baba and another Chinese Sufi master, Qi Jingyi-the founder of the Chinese branch of the Qadiriyyah school-were buried in Hezhou. The \"gongbei\" shrines around their tombs on Linxia City's west side continue to be important centers of Islamic scholarship.\n\nHowever, it was a Hezhou native and Tai Baba's most promising student, Ma Laichi who revolutionized the life of northwestern China's Muslims in the mid-18th century by making Hezhou the center of the Hua Si \"menhuan\", the main organization of the Khufiyya Sufi movement. Soon enough, many people from the Hui and Salar communities were embroiled in conflicts between the followers of Ma Laichi's Khufiyya and those of another Sufi order - the Jahriyya, founded in the 1760s by Ma Mingxin. The conflict came to a head in 1781 when Salar land in Xunhua County a few score kilometers to the west of the city was briefly besieged by the Salar rebels who passed by on the way to Lanzhou, in an unsuccessful bid to save the imprisoned Ma Mingxin.\n\nSoon after the beginning of the Massive Muslim Armed Rebellion in Northwestern China in 1862, Hezhou became one of the main strongholds of the Muslim rebels who fought against Qing Dynasty and killed many non-Muslim Han and Manchu people in Northwestern China. The leader of the rebellion in the Hezhou region was Ma Zhan'ao, the leader of the Hezhou-based Huasi \"menhuan\", a Khufiyya Sufi order founded over a century before by Ma Laichi. His top lieutenants were Ma Haiyan and Ma Qianling. A pragmatic leader, Ma Zhan'ao apparently preferred to avoid unnecessary bloodshed; soon after seizing the city, he made an effort to enable the Qing officials to flee the rebel city with whatever assets they could carry.\nBy late 1872, Qing armies led by general Zuo Zongtang had destroyed the Hui rebels in the regions to the east of Hezhou (Shaanxi and Ningxia), and reached the Tao River, separating today's Linxia Prefecture from its eastern neighbor, Dingxi. Zuo's attempts to gain a foothold west of the Tao River were stymied by Ma Zhan'ao's Muslim fighters. But Ma realized that he could not hold against the Qing armies forever, and in early 1873 he sent his son, who was soon to become known as Ma Anliang, to Zuo's headquarters in Anding to negotiate switching sides. Pursuant to the agreement, Ma Zhan'ao surrendered Hezhou to the government forces, executed those locals who objected to the surrender, and joined the government side himself, to fight against the rebels farther west. In exchange, Zuo Zongtang treated the Hezhou Muslim community much better than he had the people of Ma Hualong's Jinjipu, or than he would treat the defenders of Suzhou later this year. \nThe Hezhou Muslims were spared a massacre or a relocation to a remote region; instead, in a unique gesture during that war, Zuo acted to reduce the inter-communal tension by relocating some of the local non-Muslim \"Han\" people away from the Muslims. Nonetheless, in order to ensure the government's control over the region, the Muslims were prohibited to live within the city walls of Hezhou. For many decades thereafter, the walled city remained the non-Muslim Han territory, with its mosques converted to Buddhist temples, while the Hui Muslims lived and built their mosques outside of the city walls, in particular in the southern suburb of Bafang.\n\nMa Zhan'ao himself went to fight along with Zuo Zongtang against the Muslim rebels farther west. For his efforts (and on Zuo's request), Ma was later rewarded by the \"feathered cap of the fifth rank\" (); his and his lieutenants' descendants went to play an important role in the region's history for decades to come.\n\nLinxia City has over 80 mosques, built in a variety of architectural styles. There are also a number of \"gongbei\" shrines centered on graves of Sufi masters.\n\nLinxia City's major \"gongbei\" shrine complexes are:\nThere are also a number of smaller \"gongbeis\" throughout the city.\n\nLinxia City has long been the region's commercial hub. One of the traditional local products are a certain style of round glasses worn during the Qing Dynasty that are still made there today.\n\nLinxia City is the main transportation center of Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture. It is the junction of the prefecture's two main roads. China National Highway 213 (G213) runs from the northeast to the southwest, from Lanzhou via Yongjing County and Dongxiang Autonomous County to Linxia City, and then continue via Linxia County to Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Provincial route 309 (S309) comes from Lintao County in Dingxi City (to the east of Linxia Prefecture), and crosses Guanghe County and Hezheng County on its way to Linxia City; it then continues further west to Jishishan Bonan, Dongxiang and Salar Autonomous County.\n\nAnother important route, not yet designated as a national or state highway, allows for an alternative connection between Linxia City and Liujiaxia Town (the county seat of Yongjing County). It goes north from Linxia City, crosses a section of Linxia County and then, using ferry, the Liujiaxia Reservoir, and arrives to Liujiaxia Town from the west.\n\nLinxia is also connected by G1816 Wuhai–Maqên Expressway. Travel time to Lanzhou via G75 Lanzhou–Haikou Expressway is around 2 hours, and to Hezuo takes around 90 minutes.\n\nThe South Bus Station, situated near the Daxia River bridge over which S309 enters the city from the southeast, is served by for frequent (hourly or half-hourly service) buses to Lanzhou, Xiahe, Hezuo, Kangle, Hezheng. The same South Bust Station and the West Bus Station (located on G213 in the northern part of the city) also have a number of departures every day to major cities throughout Gansu and to Xining in the neighboring Qinghai.\nThe East Bus Station, located on G213 on the northeastern outskirts of the city, is primarily the hub for shuttle buses serving major towns in nearby counties.\n\nThere are no railways, airports, or navigable waterways near Linxia City, but the popular Lianhua Tai () dock, also known as Lianhua Gudu (), at the Liujiaxia Reservoir in the neighboring Linxia County serves as Linxia City's marine gate of sorts.\n\nThe city is served by a local public bus system with 13 routes.\n\nLanzhou–Hezuo railway is under construction and will offer intercity service to Lanzhou and Hezuo.\n\nThe Linxia Olympic Sports Centre Stadium is located in Linxia. The 20,000-capacity football stadium opened in 2016.\n\n"}

Degra, however, cannot remember his time as Archer's cell-mate and friend, and remains suspicious despite having a prison tattoo and long greying hair. Archer convinces him that this memory loss is due to the blood worms in his system (used because they excrete a truth drug, but sometimes causes the victim to suffer amnesia afterwards), and removes a worm from Degra's arm.\n\nIt soon unfolds that they are in fact inside a simulator aboard \"Enterprise\" (and still in December, 2153) and the whole set up is a ploy to learn where the weapon is being constructed. Degra and his crew, for example, had been captured near the test site of the weapon, the worm was inserted by Doctor Phlox, and the fake ship was constructed by the crew. The ruse is partially successful, and Degra reveals information about his family, and inputs coordinates into the navigation system. He later becomes suspicious after a malfunction in which one of the windows of the simulator briefly glitches due to ship-wide power fluctuations, and attacks Archer.\n\nThis leaves Archer with a dilemma; travelling to the red giant star, Azati Prime, would take them three weeks, time they do not have to waste on a wild goose chase. Instead they again deceive Degra into thinking that they have utilized Xindi warp technology to open subspace vortices, and trick him into thinking that they have already arrived at the coordinates. Degra shouts that they will never be able to breach the base's defenses, thus proving that the coordinates do in fact relate to the weapon. The episode ends with a third deception, with the mind-wiped Degra and his crew being placed back on their ship.\n\n"}
{"id": "1858942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858942", "title": "Chinese Australians", "text": "Chinese Australians\n\nChinese Australians () are Australian citizens of Chinese ancestry. Chinese Australians are one of the largest groups of Overseas Chinese people, forming the largest Overseas Chinese community in Oceania. Per capita, Australia has more people of Chinese ancestry than any country outside Asia. Many Chinese Australians have immigrated from Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan as well as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, while many are descendants of such immigrants. Chinese Australians are also a subgroup of Asian Australians and East Asian Australians and represent the single largest non Anglo-Celtic ancestry in the country. As a whole, Australian residents identifying themselves as having Chinese ancestry made up 5.6% of those nominating their ancestry at the 2016 census and numbered 1,213,903.\n\nThe early history of Chinese Australians involved significant immigration from villages of the Pearl River Delta in Southern China. Less well-known are the kinds of society Chinese Australians came from, the families they left behind and what their intentions were in migrating. Gold rushes lured many Chinese to the Australian colonies. (From the mid-19th century, Chinese dubbed Australia the \"New Gold Mountain\" after the \"Gold Mountain\" of California in North America.) They typically sent money to their families in the villages, regularly visited their families, and retired to their home villages after many years working as a market gardeners, shopkeepers or cabinet-makers. As with many overseas Chinese groups the world over, early Chinese immigrants to Australia established Chinatowns in several major cities, such as Sydney (Chinatown, Sydney), Melbourne (Chinatown, Melbourne, since the 1850s) and Brisbane (Chinatown, Brisbane), as well as in regional towns associated with the goldfields such as Cairns (Cairns Chinatown).\n\nChinese peoples have a long and continuing role in Australian history. There were early links between China and Australia when Macau and Canton were used as an important trading ports with the fledgling colony. Mak Sai Ying (also known as John Shying) was the first officially recorded Chinese migrant in 1818. After his arrival he spent some time farming before, in 1829, he became prominent as the publican of \"The Lion\" in Parramatta. Early 19th Century migration was in limited numbers and sporadic, primarily those who came in this period were free merchants or adventurers and, the more common, indentured labourers.\n\nThe Australian Gold Rushes are what first lured thousands of Chinese to the country. In 1855 in Melbourne there were 11,493 Chinese arrivals. This was startling considering that barely five years previous, Melbourne's entire population had only been around 25,000 people. Due to the widespread racist sentiments in parliament and on the goldfields, the first of many immigration restrictions and Chinese targeting laws was passed in late 1855. However, due to the long, poorly regulated borders between the colonies of Australia the numbers of Chinese on the goldfields continued to swell. Upon the goldfields Chinese peoples faced many hardships. There were violent anti-Chinese riots; the Buckland Riot, the Lambing Flats Riots, as well as general discrimination and prejudice. However, there were many establishments in this period that would have a lasting effect on the history of Australia and the history of Chinese in Australia. One of these establishments were the Chinese camps, which most often, later, became Chinatowns in Australia. There was also the establishment and the consolidation of power for Chinese societies, many of these are still active in Australia today. These societies provided support and community for the Chinese in the colonies.\n\nAfter the gold rushes the numbers of Chinese living in the cities swelled and their businesses and industries contributed much to growth of Melbourne and Sydney in the late 19th century. Mei Quong Tart was a prominent business figure in Sydney. However, there were very few Chinese women migrating to Australia. At one point in the 1860s the numbers of Chinese in Australia was around 40,000. Of these, it is believed only 12, were women. This gender imbalance meant that some Chinese men married women of European descent but many had it in their hearts to return to China.\n\nAnti-Chinese sentiment also strongly contributed to the establishment of the Federation of Australia. Some of the first Acts of the new federation would establish the White Australia Policy. This policy made it almost impossible for anyone new to migrate from China to Australia. After federation the population of Chinese in Australia steadily declined. Despite the declining numbers people with Chinese heritage still played their part in Australian history. There were over 200 people with Chinese heritage who fought for Australia in World War I, including the decorated sniper Billy Sing. A similar number fought for Australia in World War II.\n\nThe final end of the White Australia Policy from the 1960s saw new arrivals from the Chinese diaspora and for the first time significant numbers from non-Cantonese speaking parts of China. The first wave of arrivals were ethnic Chinese refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia during the 1970s. This was followed by economic migrants from Hong Kong and Taiwan in the 1980s and 1990s, whose families often settled in the capital cities. New institutions were established for these arrivals and old ones such as the Chinese Chamber of Commerce revived, while numerous Chinese language newspapers were once again published in the capital cities.\n\nAfter the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, then-Australian Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, allowed students from Cina to settle in Australia permanently. Since the 2000s, with the rapid development of China's economy, there has been an explosion in the number of immigrants from China, which have frequently been Australia's largest source of new immigrants since 2000. In 2015-16, China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau) was the second largest source of immigrants to Australia behind India. China (excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) is now the third largest foreign birthplace for Australian residents, after England and New Zealand.\n\nThe White Australia Policy of the early 20th century severely curtailed the development of the Chinese communities in Australia. However, since the advent of multiculturalism as a government policy in the 1970s, many people of Chinese ethnicity from Asia (especially China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and Cambodia) have immigrated to Australia.\n\nAs a whole, Australian residents identifying themselves as having Chinese ancestry made up 5.6% of those nominating their ancestry at the 2016 census and numbered 1,213,903. At the 2016 census, 509,555 people declared that they were born in Mainland China, 86,886 declared that they were born in Hong Kong, while 46,882 declared that they were born in Taiwan. There are also a large number of persons of Chinese ancestry among those born in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nBefore the end of the 20th century, Chinese Australians were predominately of Cantonese and Hakka descent from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, and Cantonese was the dominant language. Due to more recent immigration from other regions of China, Mandarin has surpassed Cantonese by number of speakers. At the 2016 census, 596,711 persons declared that they spoke Mandarin at home (the most common language spoken at home in Australia after English at 2.5%), followed by Cantonese at 280,943 (the third most common after English at 1.2%). In total, there were 927,944 people who spoke a Chinese language at home, a figure which includes Mandarin and dialects such as Shanghainese, Cantonese, Hokkien and Hakka. Second or higher generation Chinese Australians are often either monolingual in English or bilingual to varying degrees with Chinese.\n\nAt the 2016 census, Sydney was home to 44% of the Mainland China-born population of Australia, while Melbourne was home to 31%. Brisbane had the largest Taiwanese-born population in the country.\n\nAt the 2016 census, 487,976 (or 10.8%) of the inhabitants of Sydney who nominated their ancestry nominated Chinese ancestry solely or along with another ancestry. In Melbourne, the number was 356,324 (or 8.5%), while in Brisbane it was 99,593 (or 4.7%) and in Perth it was 99,229 (5.5%).\n\nIn a 2004 study on the intermarriage pattern in Australia, the proportion of second-generation Chinese Australians with spouses of Anglo-Celtic ancestry was approximately 21% and for third generation it was 68%.\n\nAccording to Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 2012 Chinese immigrant mothers had a total fertility of 1.59 children per woman, lower compared to the Australian average of 1.94.\n\nAccording to the census data collected in the last twenty years, among Australians with full or partial Chinese ancestry there has been a general decline of institutional religions (between 2006 and 2016, Buddhism fell from 24.1% to 15.7% and Christianity fell from 29.8% to 23.4%). In 2016, 55.4% of the Chinese Australians fit within the census category of \"not religious, secular beliefs or other spiritual beliefs\", rising significantly from 37.8% in 2006. These shiftings in religious demography may be due to the incoming of new immigrants from China who generally do not have a formal religious affiliation, and many of whom are involved in the native Chinese religion which has been on the rise in China over the last decades.\n\nIn 2006, 55.0 percent for Chinese-born Australians aged 15 years and over had some form of higher non-school qualifications compared to 52.5 percent of the Australian population. Among Chinese-born Australians, 42.2 percent had Diploma level or higher* qualifications and 4.8 percent had Certificate level qualifications. For Chinese-born Australians, 88,440 had no higher non-school qualification, of which 35.3 percent were still attending an educational institution. In 2006, 57.3 per cent of the Hong Kong-born Australians aged 15 years and over had some form of higher non-school qualifications compared to 52.5 percent of the Australian population. Among the Hong Kong-born Australians, 45.7 per cent had Diploma level or higher qualifications and 6.1 percent had Certificate level qualifications. From the Hong Kong-born Australians, 28,720 had no higher non-school qualification, of which 44.7 per cent were still attending an educational institution.\n\nIn 2006, 31.9% of Chinese Australians attained a bachelor's degree compared to just 14.8% for the general Australian population. 36.1% of Hong Kong Australians attained a bachelor's degree or higher. Chinese Australians born overseas reported high educational attainment with over 50% of them holding at least bachelor's degree. When all these rates are melded, approximately 42 percent of (first and second generation) Chinese Australians have achieved a bachelor's degree, making it roughly three times the national average of 14 percent.\n\nThe pathways Chinese-Australian families choose to motivate their children is partly based on their cultural values which emphasise scholastic excellence, and partly on their own experiences in their native as well as in the host country. Customarily, activities taking place in Chinese-Australian homes were related to the education of their children. Regular family discussions on educational matters and career paths had a modelling effect. The key feature of these families was that parental involvement in their children's school-related activities remained high throughout the high school time of their children. Chinese-Australian families indicated that diligence, a deep cultural respect for education and motivation to become educated was quite strong among first generation immigrants. Chinese-Australians have a significant influence and place considerable pressure on their children to academically. In addition, mathematics achievement and participation of high school students have a strong correlation towards the success or achievement goals and sense of competence. In addition, Chinese students from migrant backgrounds, in comparison to those from refugee backgrounds, are more academically successful.\n\nAmong Hong Kong-born Australians aged 15 years and over, the participation rate in the labour force was 63.3 percent and the unemployment rate was 6.6 percent. The corresponding rates in the total Australian population were 64.6 and 5.2 percent respectively. Of the 39,870 Hong Kong-born Australians who were employed, 42.2 percent were employed in a Skill Level 1 occupation, 12.3 percent in Skill Level 2 and 8.5 percent in Skill Level 3. The corresponding rates in the total Australian population were 28.7, 10.7 and 15.1 percent respectively.\n\nMany Chinese Australians work in white collar middle class jobs. But Chinese Australians are under-represented in occupations such\nas journalism, law and other professions that require language skills and face to face contact. First-generation Chinese Australians\nalso experience problems in getting white collar jobs commensurate with their qualifications and work experience instead they go\ninto business and operate convenience stores, car dealerships, grocery stores, coffee shops, news agencies and restaurants while\nsacrificing to pay for their children education as perceiving education as the only available channel of social mobility, substantial\ninvestment in their children's education at a disproportionate sacrifice to family finance and social well-being is an indication of\nparental concerns and expectations.\n\n33.8% of Chinese Australians and 46.6% Hong Kong Australians work as white collar professionals compared to 32% for the total Australian population. 63.3% of Hong Kong Australians and 56.3% of Chinese Australians participate in the Australian workforce which was below the national average of 67.1%. Chinese Australians and Hong Kong Australians also have an unemployment rate of 11.2% and 6.6% respectively. Both figures were higher than the national average of 4.9%.\n\nIn 2006, the median individual weekly income for Chinese-born Australians aged 15 years and over was $242, compared with $431 for all overseas-born and $488 for all Australia-born. The total Australian population had a median individual weekly income of $466. In 2006, the median individual weekly income for Hong Kong-born Australians aged 15 years and over was $425, compared with $431 for all overseas-born and $488 for all Australia-born. The total Australian population had a median individual weekly income of $466. Therefore, median weekly earnings for Chinese Australians are relatively lower than the population average.\n\nThere have been numerous notable Chinese Australians in various fields throughout Australia's history. Current Chinese-Australian federal Members of Parliament include Penny Wong, Ian Goodenough and Gladys Liu. Active Chinese-Australian atheletes include Les Fong, Lin Jong, Cheltzie Lee, Melissa Wu, Cruze Ah-Nau, and Brendan Ah Chee.\n\n\n\n"}

The Security Forces (SF) were formerly known as Military Police (MP), Air Police (AP), and Security Police (SP) at various points in its history. Due to its significant ground combat mission, the Security Forces are sometimes regarded as integral infantry within the Air Force.\n\nThe USAF Security Forces lineage can be traced to its beginning in WWII with the German blitzkrieg. Blitzkrieg relied on swift attacks by land and air. One of the tactics employed by blitzkrieg was the use of paratroops and airborne forces to capture, or destroy in advance, air bases. A key turning point in air base defensive thinking came with the loss of the Battle of Crete to German forces and capture of the British air base at Maleme in 1941. This single action led then Prime Minister Winston Churchill to study British air base defense policy, and in a condemning memo to the Secretary of State for Air and to the Chief of the Air Staff dated 29 June 1941, Churchill stated he would no longer tolerate the shortcomings of the Royal Air Force (RAF), in which half a million RAF personnel had no combat role. He ordered that all airmen be armed and ready \"to fight and die in defense of their air fields\" and that every airfield should be a stronghold of fighting air-ground men and not \"uniformed civilians in the prime of life protected by detachments of soldiers.\" Churchill's directive resulted in formation of the RAF Regiment.\n\nOn 12 February 1942 the United States adopted the British air defense philosophy. The Army Chief of Staff, Gen. George C. Marshall, approved the allocation of 53,299 African-Americans to the Army Air Forces with the \"stipulation that air base defense 'for the number of air bases found necessary' be organized and that 'Negro personnel' be used for this purpose as required.\" This order formed the Army Air Forces (AAF) air base security battalions in June 1942. Units were deployed throughout the European, Asian and African theaters and designed to defend against local ground attacks. These units were armed with rifles, machine guns and 37mm guns.\n\nOn 29 March 1943, General Hap Arnold, the commander of the Army Air Forces, established the Office of the Air Provost Marshal, which established three separate organizations for the law enforcement and security role: Guard Squadrons, Military Police Companies (Aviation), and Air Base Security Battalions. Guard Squadrons were assigned to provide interior law enforcement and security to bases within the continental United States, with a technical guard school at Miami Army Air Field and a military police school at Buckley Field. Outside the United States the duties of law enforcement and internal security were carried out by Military Police Companies (Aviation), which, while a part of the Army Air Forces, were still part of the Army's Military Police Corps. Their training was conducted at Camp Ripley. Air Base Security Battalions, the direct predecessors to the USAF Security Forces, were formed to be the ground combat force of the Army Air Forces, much like the RAF Regiment is for the Royal Air Force. The battalions operated machine guns, mortars, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, half-tracks, self-propelled guns, and even light tanks, with the official history of the USAF Security Forces referring to them as the Army Air Forces' \"infantry\"\n\nWhen the Air Force was created with the signing of the National Security Act of 1947, all members of the AAF were transferred to the new branch, to include military police attached to the Army Air Forces.\n\nOn 2 January 1948 the Military Police were reformed into the Air Police and established the Air Provost Marshal. Immediately twenty-two military police companies were predesignated Air Police squadrons, however the term Air Police did not come into full usage until November 1948. The transfer of personnel fully from the Army to the Air Force was supposed to be completed by December 1948, however it was not fully completed until 1953. In April 1952 Army grade titles and MOS designations were replaced with Air Force AFSCs.\n\nIn June 1950 the Air Force began urgent operations focused on air base defense with the outbreak of the Korean War. A buildup of ground combat forces began. The center of this buildup was the expansion of the Air Force Air Police from 10,000 in July 1950 to 39,000 in December 1951. Still, one year into the war the Air Provost Marshal reported that \"the Air Force is without policy or tactical doctrine for Air Base Ground Defense.\" In haste, Air Police serving as the cadre of this force were outfitted with armored vehicles, machine guns and recoilless rifles. Air base defense was officially implemented by Air Force Regulation (AFR) 355-4 on 3 March 1953. AFR 355-4 defined air base defense \"as all measures taken by the installation commander to deny hostile forces access to the area encompassing all buildings, equipment, facilities, landing fields, dispersal areas and adjacent terrain.\" However, the regulation did not include provisions for sustained ground defense operations. Performance of this mission fell to the provisional base defense task forces to be organized and equipped like infantry. It was the Strategic Air Command's (SAC) October 1952 edition of the SAC Manual 205-2 that rejected the notion that the USAF's ground defense mission conflicted with Army functions. SAC officials felt that success of the Air Force mission might require point defense elements that the Army could not afford to protect, much less have the Air Force rely on the Army to come to the rescue. After the Korean War, General Curtis LeMay had the Air Police begin the Combat Arms Program, to better train airmen in the use of weapons.\n\nOn 1 September 1950 the Air Police School was established at Tyndall Air Force Base. In 1952 the Air Police school was transferred to Parks AFB, California, and re-designated the \"Air Base Defense School\" to emphasize on air base defense capabilities. It soon became evident the emphasis on air base defense was not making much headway. On 13 October 1956 Air Police training was transferred to Lackland AFB, Texas, where it evolved into Security Police training and eventually became the US Air Force Security Forces Academy.\n\nToward the end of the 1950s and into the 1960s, the Air Police began to reemphasize the security aspect of their mission, with a strong focus being given to protecting the Air Force's strategic nuclear weapons, and a greater amount of centralization regarding training occurred. The Air Provost Marshal was also redesignated the Director of Security and Law Enforcement.\n\nOn 1 November 1964, between 12:25 and 12:33 am, Vietnamese Communist (VC) troops attacked Bien Hoa Air Base with six 81mm mortars positioned about 400 meters north, outside the air base. The VC fired 60-80 rounds into parked aircraft and troop billets, then withdrew undetected and unabated. The attack killed four US military personnel, wounded 30 and destroyed and/or damaged 20 B-57 bombers. U.S. air bases had become targets and became routine targets thereafter. The Air Force was not allowed to patrol the perimeter of their bases. That role was left up to the Vietnamese Air Force. Also, the U.S. Army was cited as being tasked to control the security of the area around the air base, and after-action scrutiny along with politics served to foster distrust and jealousy between services, chains of command and the U.S. and Vietnamese services. As a result, air bases in South Vietnam were left vulnerable. By striking at USAF air bases the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and VC employed Giulio Douhet's military concept, which stated the only effective way to counter air power was to destroy its bases on the ground. This concept has also been proven effective during the Indochina War from 1946–54, when the Viet Minh regularly and successfully attacked French air bases.\n\nThe USAF Sentry Dog program was a product of the Korean War. On 1 May 1957 the Air Force gained responsibility for training all working dogs in the Department of Defense. By 1965 the USAF had a pool of sentry dog teams available for deployment to South Vietnam. Nightly at every air base, sentry dog teams were deployed as a detection and warning screen in the zone separating combat forces from the perimeter. Nearly all air base defense personnel agreed that the Sentry Dog Teams rendered outstanding service, with some going as far to say \"Of all the equipment and methods used to detect an attacking enemy force, the sentry dog has provided the most sure, all-inclusive means.\"\n\nDuring their time in Korea and early in Vietnam, the Air Police found themselves in a number of ground combat roles, some of which more accurately reflected an infantry-type role than that of the military police. In 1966 the Air Police were redesignated the Security Police, in an effort to more accurately reflect the security and combat aspect of their mission.\n\nShortly after the creation of the Security Police, in 1967 the \"Safe Side\" program was activated, which resulted in certain Security Police squadrons being trained in the use of light infantry tactics and special weapons to better enhance air base defense. Many of the squadrons that were part of the Safe Side project, such as the 1041st Security Police Squadron (Test), established observation posts, listening posts, conducted reconnaissance and ambush patrols, and served as mobile response forces to protect the airbases. The successes of this initial squadron resulted in the creation of 82nd Combat Security Police Wing and the development of ground combat training for all security policemen. In 1968 the Air Force accepted the Safe Side Program's recommendation to establish 559-man Combat Security Police Squadrons (CSPS) organized into three field flights. Three CSPS were incrementally activated, trained and deployed in 179-day TDY rotations to South Vietnam. On 15 March 1968 the 821st CSPS began a hasty training program at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and was in place at Phan Rang Air Base on its TDY deployment by 15 April. The 822nd CSPS was organized, more completely trained and replaced the 821st in August 1968. The 823rd CSPS was trained at Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, and replaced the 822nd in March 1969, remaining until August 1969 when it was replaced by the 821st.\nThe vindication for the Safe Side program occurred during the Battle of Tan Son Nhut, as part of the Tet Offensive, on 31 January 1968, when Tan Son Nhut Airbase was attacked by a combined force of seven North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong battalions, composing an enemy force of 2,500 enemy troops. The combat trained Security Police were able to hold off the North Vietnamese forces, preventing the loss of the airbase. The Vietnam War demonstrated to the Air Force the need for whole base defense measures,\nand demonstrated that airmen, regardless of AFSC, could be vulnerable to attack, just the same as Army and Marine forces.\nBy January 1971 the Security Police career field was split into two separate functions: Law Enforcement Specialist (AFSC 812XX) and Security Specialist (AFSC 811XX). In November 1971 the first female airmen trained into the law enforcement specialty, and in November 1976 100 female airmen were trained as security specialists. Although the female security specialist program was soon after shut down, they have the distinction of being the first women permitted into any combat role in the entire U.S. Armed Forces. Law enforcement specialists, who had excelled in their career field, could be selected as criminal investigators and attend Military Police Investigations training at the 3280th TCHTG OLA Air Force Liaison at Ft. McClellan, AL, or attend the Air Force Office of Special Investigations basic agent's course at Bolling AFB, Washington DC.\n\nIn May 1975, Security Police units were tasked with a high priority rescue operation of the SS Mayaguez merchant ship, and with Air Force helicopters, were preparing to perform a boarding of the ship. Prior to the rescue mission one of the helicopters crashed, killing 18 security policemen, and forcing the mission to be aborted. The loss of this aircraft was attributed to a failure to properly assemble a blade sleeve during overhaul nearly a year earlier.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1989 the Security Police were responsible for protecting the USAF's ground launched cruise missiles in Europe, providing security for them during the height of the Cold War. In 1983, during Operation Urgent Fury, Security Police forces were among the first on Grenada, responsible for securing runways and POWs. In January 1985 women were finally permitted to enter the security field - the first since 1976.\n\nIn 1987 the standard weapon of the Security Police Law Enforcement Branch was changed from the Smith & Wesson Model 15 .38-cal. six-shot revolver to the Beretta M9, a 9mm semi-automatic pistol with a standard 15-round magazine, which brought the Security Police in line with the rest of the United States Armed Forces. Also in 1987 the Air Base Ground Defense School was moved from Camp Bullis to Fort Dix, where the Army was given control of the training. In 1989, as a part of Operation Just Cause, Security Police units were responsible for securing airfields during the Invasion of Panama and performing drug interdiction and humanitarian missions.\n\nIn August 1990, Security Police were deployed to Saudi Arabia as a part of Operation Desert Shield, where they were responsible for guarding airbases, dignitary support, and counter terrorism. In August 1995 Air Base Ground Defense Training was moved from Fort Dix back to Camp Bullis, and control was shifted from the Army back to the Air Force. During Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia, Security Police forces conducted convoy operations and acted as a peacekeeping force. In 1996 the Khobar Towers Bombing\noccurred, with 19 airmen killed and 260 injured. Security Policemen SSgt Alfredo Guerrero, SrA Corey Grice and A1C Christopher Wager received the Airman's Medal for their actions prior to and after the terrorist attack.\n\nIn response to the Khobar Towers bombing, the Air Force reevaluated how the Security Police was organized, and came to the realization it could not afford to have only a few specialize in the security aspect of the mission. On 31 October 1997, the Security Police became the Security Forces, with all individual specialties being merged into one Security Forces specialist AFSC. The Security Forces brought back the principles of Safe Side, transforming the Security Forces into a combat force.\n\nIn 1997 the Air Force activated the 820th Base Defense Group, a Force Protection unit based at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia. The unit is a trained force protection unit of 12 Air Force Specialty Codes with an airborne capability, and is intended to serve as a quick reaction force, capable of deploying anywhere in the world. Air Mobility Command also activated the Raven program, which attached Security Forces specialists to its aircraft to provide on-site security in hostile or remote environments.\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks in 2001, Security Forces prepared for additional attacks and combat operations, both in the United States and abroad. On 16 December 2001, airmen with the 786th Security Forces Squadron deployed to Manas International Airport, Kyrgyzstan, to provide security while the airbase was under construction, to support U.S. operations in Afghanistan. Three months later the 822nd Security Forces Squadron assumed the role, and conducted patrols outside the airbase to deter attack and build relations with local villagers.\n\nOn 19 March 2003 the United States invaded Iraq, and on the same day members of the 161st Security Forces Squadron arrived in country, securing the newly captured Tallil Air Base. On 26 March 2003, elements of the 786th Security Forces Squadron performed the first Security Forces combat jump in Air Force history, taking Bashur Air Base in conjunction with the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade.\n\nThroughout the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, Security Forces specialists, and airmen as a whole were pressed into more ground combat roles, to include running convoys. This resulted in the formation of The Aerospace Expeditionary Force Transport Company. These companies were not divided into flights, but rather platoons, with the first, the 2632nd Aerospace Expeditionary Force Transport Company, deploying in April 2004. Some Security Forces specialists were also attached to Army and Marine infantry units to provide either manpower or military working dogs.\n\nOn 1 January 2005 Task Force 1041 was formed by elements of the 820th Security Forces Group to execute Operation Desert Safe Side. The objective was to conduct outside the wire \"kill or capture\" missions in one of the most violent areas of Iraq. At the end of the operation, they had reduced attacks on the local airbase to almost zero, while capturing 18 high-value targets, eight major weapons caches, and 98 other insurgent or terrorist targets. Units, such as the 824th Security Forces Squadron, were responsible for training Iraqi security forces. In Summer 2008 the 332nd Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron stood up at Balad Airbase, and for the first time since the Vietnam War a Security Forces Squadron assumed full responsibility for the security, both on and off base, of a major air base in a war zone.\n\nThe Strategic Air Command's Elite Guard, an Air Police unit first established in December 1956 to provide security at USAF SAC headquarters, was the first USAF unit officially authorized to wear a blue beret (with affixed SAC patch) in 1957 as part of their distinct Elite Guard uniform. The Elite Guard's dark blue serge wool beret was worn on duty, at both guard and ceremonial functions, from 1957 onwards.\n\nIn 1966–67, during Operation Safe Side, the first Security Police beret was issued by the 1041st Security Police Squadron. This experimental and specially trained Air Base Ground Defense (ABGD) unit adopted a light blue beret displaying a falcon as its emblem. Operation Safe Side developed into the 82nd Combat Security Police Wing, consisting of three \"combat security police\" squadrons, but was inactivated in December 1968, ending the unofficial use of the light blue beret.\n\nElsewhere, during the Vietnam War, although not an authorized uniform item, some local security police commanders approved a dark blue beret similar to the SAC Elite Guard beret for their units as a less-conspicuous alternative to the official white Security Police cover for certain specialized personnel. In Thailand during the late 1960s and early 1970s, Military Working Dog handlers assigned to the 6280th SPS at the Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base sported a dark blue beret with no insignia. Other units adopted a beret to distinguish their guards.\n\nIn 1975 Brig Gen Thomas Sadler was appointed Air Force Chief of Security Police with the task of bringing the Security Police career field into the mainstream of the Air Force. One tool he employed was recognition of members of a distinctive portion of the force, with the beret proposed as a uniform change. Significant opposition to the beret from senior colonels and Major Command (MAJCOM) Chiefs was gradually overcome by the popularity of the concept with personnel. The uniform board approved the proposal, and the beret was officially worn worldwide starting in February 1976.\n\nThe 1976 beret was worn with the MAJCOM crest of the appropriate major command to which the unit was assigned. It continued in this manner for 20 years until the forming of the Security Forces. In March 1997 the 82nd CSPW was reactivated and re-designated the 820th Security Forces Group. The heraldry of the 820th SFG then replaced the individual MAJCOM emblems as beret insignia. Enlisted personnel wear the dark blue SF beret which bears the fabric SF \"Flash\" depicting a falcon over an airfield with the SF motto \"\"Defensor Fortis\"\", meaning \"Defenders of the Force\", underneath. An officer's \"Flash\" is similar in appearance but replaces the embroidered falcon and airfield with either metal \"pin-on\" or embroidered rank.\n\nSince March 2004 the Air Force has provided airmen to serve combat support roles, despite the stress of working outside their usual duties. As a result, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen T. Michael Moseley has sounded warnings about having airmen filling Army jobs they are not trained to do. Nevertheless, the Air Force steadily increased the number of airmen serving in combat support roles for its sister services. The Air Force calls such missions \"in lieu of\" taskings, or ILO for short.\n\nIn January 2006 Brig Gen Robert Holmes, Director of Security Forces and Force Protection, stated, \"We want to make our airmen more proficient, and to do that we need to adapt. We're going to change our training, our tactics and our procedures and the Air Force will be better for it.\" Brig Gen Holmes calls these transformations a \"refocus\" on how Security Forces train and fight. He elaborated, \"We're not in the Cold War anymore; we have to alter our mentality and our practices for today's reality. Because of the nature of the threat, our airmen are fighting the global war on terror on the front lines, and we owe it to them to provide training, equipment and resources to be effective. Essentially, Security Forces will focus on preparing for their war-fighting mission at forward locations, as well as security at a fixed installation. Our airmen are going 'outside the wire' to conduct missions and are proving successful in keeping people safe.\" Gen. Holmes also said one of the transformation goals is bringing security forces back in step with standard Air Force 120-day deployments. He explained, \"Right now our folks are going out for 179-day rotations. Our airmen need time to reconstitute and train. So it's important to get them in line with the rest of the Air Force. We aim to do just that.\" Overall, Brig Gen Holmes said the changes would make Security Forces more effective and relevant to Air Force needs in the face of the current changing nature of warfare.\n\nIn November 2007 it was announced that the Air Force was going to triple the number of Security Forces personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan to back-fill Army and Marine Corps mission tasks.\n\nIn September 2010 the Air Force announced it was increasing all combat deployments to 179 days beginning in 2011. Lt. Col. Belinda Petersen, a spokeswoman for the Air Force Personnel Center, said the increase in deployment duration is an effort to \"improve predictability and stability for airmen and their families.\" Peterson added that by revising the policy, airmen affected by the change will also \"ideally\" get more time at home. The dwell time for those airmen is expected to increase from 16 to 24 months. Despite these \"improvements\", Security Forces, civil engineers, contractors and intelligence are among the busiest in the Air Force, with six-month deployments, followed by only six months at home.\n\nOn 2 March 2011, a senior airman assigned to the 48th Security Forces Squadron at Royal Air Force Lakenheath, England, and an Airman 1st Class assigned to the 86th Vehicle Readiness Squadron at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, were shot and killed by a 21-year-old Kosovo native of Albanian descent, at Frankfurt International Airport, Germany. The shooter's relatives in Kosovo told the Associated Press that he was a devout Muslim and German federal prosecutors said they suspect he was motivated by extremist, Islamist ideology. A U.S. law enforcement official says the shooter shouted \"Allahu Akbar\", or \"God is Great\" in Arabic, as he opened fire. The Air Force says most of the airmen attacked were part of a Security Forces team passing through Germany on their way to a deployment in Afghanistan. In addition to the two dead, two other airmen were wounded.\n\nThree Security Forces members have been killed in action while serving in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. On 5 September 2013 a SSgt assigned to the 105th Base Defense Squadron while attached to the 820th Base Defense Group, was killed by small-arms fire after his unit was ambushed and attacked by insurgents outside of Bagram Airfield. \nOn 21 December 2015 a TSgt and a SSgt, both serving in the 105th Base Defense Squadron, part of the New York Air National Guard's 105th Airlift Wing, were killed, along with four special agents with the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations, outside of Bagram Airfield by a suicide bomber utilizing a motorcycle.\n\nAs of 30 May 2011 12 Security Forces members have died while supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. These personnel total 22% of all Air Force casualties during OIF. Of those fatalities, seven were the result of hostile action such as small arms fire and improvised explosive devices. The remaining five were the result of non-hostile action such as vehicle accidents, suicide and medical problems.\n\nOn 2 October 2015 during Operation Freedom's Sentinel, a senior airman and an airman 1st class were killed when their C-130J, assigned to the 774th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron, crashed on takeoff while they performed Fly Away Security Operations.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1858952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858952", "title": "History of Joseph the Carpenter", "text": "History of Joseph the Carpenter\n\nThe History of Joseph the Carpenter (\"Historia Josephi Fabri Lignari\") is a compilation of traditions concerning Mary (mother of Jesus), Joseph, and the \"holy family,\" probably composed in Byzantine Egypt in Greek in the late sixth or early seventh centuries, but surviving only in Coptic and Arabic language translation. The text bears witness to the belief in the perpetual virginity of Mary.\n\nIt is one of the texts within the New Testament apocrypha concerned with the period of Jesus' life before he was 12.\n\nThe text is framed as an explanation by Jesus on the Mount of Olives concerning the life of Joseph, his stepfather. Agreeing with Mary's continued virginity, the text proclaims that Joseph had four sons (Judas, Justus, James, and Simon) and two daughters (Assia and Lydia) by a previous marriage. \n\nAfter this basic background, the text proceeds to paraphrase the Gospel of James, stopping at the point of Jesus' birth. The text states that Joseph was miraculously blessed with mental and physical youth, dying at the age of 111. His oldest sons (Justus and Simon) get married and have children, and likewise his two daughters get married and live in their own houses. \nJoseph's death takes up a substantial portion of the text. He first lets out a significant prayer, including in his last words a series of lamentations about his carnal sins. About 50% of the work is an extension of the death scene, in which the angel of death, as well as the archangels Michael and Gabriel, appear to him. At the conclusion of the text, Jesus affirms that Mary remained a virgin throughout her days by addressing her as \"my mother, virgin undefiled.\"\n\nThe text says \"And the holy apostles have preserved this conversation, and have left it written down in the library at Jerusalem.\"\n\nSome information indicates the text was written in Egypt in the fifth century. Two versions survive, one in Coptic, the other in Arabic, with the Coptic version likely being the original. Much of the text is based on material in the Gospel of James.\n\nThe early third century apocryphal \"First Apocalypse of James\" from the Nag Hammadi library states: Jesus speaking to James, \"For not without reason have I called you my brother, although you are not my brother materially.\" This adds an additional record of Mary's relationship to Jesus' brothers, allowing the explanation of her perpetual virginity.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1858964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858964", "title": "Troy Van Leeuwen", "text": "Troy Van Leeuwen\n\nTroy Van Leeuwen (born January 5, 1970) is an American rock musician and producer. He is best known as the guitarist for the rock band Queens of the Stone Age (QOTSA), for which he has served since 2002. He is also known for his work with the rock band Failure, and with alternative rock supergroup A Perfect Circle, as well as recordings with QOTSA members' side projects such as the Desert Sessions, Mondo Generator, Eagles of Death Metal and the Gutter Twins. Van Leeuwen created his first side-project, Enemy, in 2005, Sweethead, in 2008, Gone Is Gone, in 2016, and toured with Iggy Pop supporting his album \"Post Pop Depression\" made with QOTSA bandmates Josh Homme and Dean Fertita.\n\nVan Leeuwen has a Dutch surname (he has ancestors from the Netherlands and has described himself as a third-generation American). He became interested in music at an early age and his dad would play early rock and roll records such as Chuck Berry. His first big influence in learning how to play rock came through listening to Led Zeppelin records. Playing drums initially, Van Leeuwen sought to imitate Zeppelin drummer, John Bonham, but later switched to guitar and discovered that he had an aptitude for it. He cites Jimmy Page as a big influence:\nIn the late 1980s, Van Leeuwen played in Jester, a successful southern California band fronted by vocalist Eric Book. Jester released an EP, which is the earliest and most rare recording of a 16-year-old Van Leeuwen. He then played in a small band called Little Boots, with which he recorded a number of demos and played a few shows before the band's breakup. His next band was 60 Cycle, which released their debut \"Pretender\" in 1995, and their self-titled album the following year. It was during his time in 60 Cycle that Van Leeuwen met Kellii Scott, and the two started working on a project (later to be known as Enemy). Van Leeuwen went on to play in Failure. The band released three records and didn't enjoy any commercial success, but was praised by critics as a talented and almost revolutionary group. It was during a tour with Failure when Van Leeuwen met former Kyuss guitarist Josh Homme, who was presently playing rhythm guitar with The Screaming Trees. After the breakup of Failure, Van Leeuwen became a session musician and recording engineer, working with groups such as Orgy, Crazy Town, Coal Chamber and KoRn.\n\nIt was during his time as a session musician that Van Leeuwen met Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan, who offered him a spot in his and Billy Howerdel's new band, A Perfect Circle. The band played their first show at LA's Viper Club Reception on August 15, 1999. After playing shows in Los Angeles, the band entered the studio to begin work on their debut album, \"Mer de Noms\". The album was released on May 23, 2000, making it the highest ever debut for a new rock band, selling over 188,000 copies in its first week, and appearing at number four on the \"Billboard\" 200. Van Leeuwen toured extensively with the band, initially as the opening act for Nine Inch Nails, followed a number of headlining tours around the world. Van Leeuwen recorded guitar parts on only three tracks of A Perfect Circle's second album, \"Thirteenth Step\", before successfully auditioning for a spot in Josh Homme's Queens of the Stone Age.\n\nAfter outperforming Jeordie White and others in the audition, Van Leeuwen was welcomed as the band's second guitarist for their \"Songs for the Deaf\" tour. Besides playing guitar, Van Leeuwen also performed on lap steel guitar, keyboards, backing vocals and occasionally bass guitar. Due to the band's schedule, Van Leeuwen had only one week to learn 30 songs before the tour began. For the European leg of the album's supporting tour, Dave Grohl left to return to his main band Foo Fighters. He was replaced with former Danzig drummer Joey Castillo. \"Songs for the Deaf\" was a critical and commercial success, and the singles \"No One Knows\" and \"Go with the Flow\" became hits on both radio and MTV. The tour culminated in a number of headline dates in Australia in January 2004.\n\nVan Leeuwen's first recording with QOTSA was \"Lullabies to Paralyze\". The band entered the studio with long-time collaborator and multi-instrumentalist Alain Johannes, who replaced Nick Oliveri on the album. Van Leeuwen aimed to fill in some of the gaps in the music where he felt the sound could be expanded through atmospheric and ambient textures made by guitar, lap steel and piano. The album (the title of which is taken from a lyric in \"Mosquito Song\" from Songs for the Deaf) featured several guest appearances, most notably ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, who performed backing vocals and lead guitar on \"Burn the Witch\" and the ZZ Top cover, “Precious and Grace”. Despite reportedly turning down an invitation to remain with the band, Mark Lanegan recorded vocals on new tracks, and appeared with the band on the supporting tour when scheduling and his health permitted. The album was leaked onto the internet in February 2005, and was aired by Australian radio on March 3, 2005 as an unsubstantiated 'World Premiere'. The album was then officially released on March 22, 2005 in the USA, and debuted as number 5 on the Billboard Music Chart: the greatest initial success of any QOTSA record to date. On November 22, 2005, the band released a live album/DVD set called \"Over the Years and Through the Woods\", which featured a live concert filmed in London, and bonus features (including rare videos dating from 1998 to 2005).\n\nAfter touring to support the album, the band headed back into the studio in July 2006. A year later, Van Leeuwen reported that the band had written new material that was \"still in its infancy\", which Homme later suggested might be released as an EP. This matured into their 2007 release \"Era Vulgaris\", to which Van Leeuwen contributed a significant amount of material.\n\nSeveral sites reported that the album would include many guest vocalists, including Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails, Julian Casablancas from The Strokes, Mark Lanegan, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, and wittingly, deceased humorist Erma Bombeck. Josh Homme described the record as \"dark, hard, and electrical, sort of like a construction worker\". \"Era Vulgaris\" was completed in early April 2007 and released in June 2007 in the US The tracks \"Sick, Sick, Sick\" and \"3's & 7's\" were released as singles in early June. Bassist Michael Shuman (Wires on Fire, Jubilee) and keyboardist Dean Fertita (The Waxwings, The Raconteurs) took over touring duties from Alain Johannes and Natasha Shneider respectively.\n\nFollowing a subsequent interview with Homme, \"The Globe and Mail\" reported that the EP \"could contain as many as 10 B-sides recorded during the \"Era Vulgaris\" sessions.\" It was since reported however that the EP would not be released due to the record label's unwillingness to put out another QOTSA release at this time. In a September issue of NME Magazine, Homme stated that he was going back to make the new QOTSA and Desert Sessions records, along with remastering the 1998 (QOTSA) self-titled album for an early 2009 release. Homme also stated Queens' new album is going to be a \"desert orgy in the dark\".\n\nIn 2013, QOTSA released ...Like Clockwork, Van Leeuwen's third full album with the band. On the album, Van Leeuwen plays guitar, percussion, twelve-string guitar, twelve-string slide guitar, lap steel, synthesizers, acoustic guitar and provides vocals. The album was the first QOTSA album to reach number one on the \"Billboard\" 200. It also reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Album.\n\nIn 2005, Van Leeuwen released \"Hooray For Dark Matter\" with his side project Enemy. The album features bassist Eddie Nappi from the Mark Lanegan Band, and his former bandmate from Failure Kelli Scott on drums (who had replaced Quicksand's Alan Cage). Van Leeuwen describes Enemy as his \"big, dumb rock trio\", and \"a vehicle driven by pure and utter disgust of mediocrity and general frustration with the human condition\". During Van Leeuwen's time with A Perfect Circle, Enemy recorded a five track demo in what he called \"Guerilla-style recording\" at various studios. The band (unusually) offered to be signed by a record label by advertising for the princely sum of $250,000 on eBay. Enemy was ultimately signed by Control Group/TCG, who released their debut album. After joining the Queens of the Stone Age, Van Leeuwen has also contributed music to band members' various side projects: such as The Desert Sessions, Mondo Generator, Eagles of Death Metal, The Gutter Twins and Mark Lanegan's solo album \"Bubblegum\". After the Era Vulgaris tour's end, Van Leeuwen began touring with his current side project, Sweethead.\n\nIn 2016, Van Leeuwen toured with Iggy Pop, Josh Homme, Matt Helders and Matt Sweeney in support of their album \"Post Pop Depression\". He also formed Gone Is Gone, a supergroup also consisting of Troy Sanders, the singer and bass player from Mastodon, Tony Hajjar, the drummer for At the Drive-In, and Mike Zarin, a multi-instrumentalist who appeared with Van Leeuwen on Sweethead's \"Descent To The Surface\". An EP will be released in the summer of 2016, and the band is developing a studio album for release later in the year. In 2017, he contributed guitar parts to Chelsea Wolfe's fifth studio album, Hiss Spun.\n\nAccording to Van Leeuwen, Queens of the Stone Age (and Homme in particular) have a \"veil of secrecy\" regarding their exact setup, in order to maintain a unique guitar sound. However, over time Van Leeuwen eventually disclosed some information regarding his gear. When he first joined the band in 2002 for the \"Songs for the Deaf\" promotional tour, he leaned toward duplicating Josh Homme's setup, favoring Ampeg guitar combos and specific pedals. All of his guitars were fitted with a variety of Seymour Duncan pickups, most often Customs or JB. During the \"Lullabies to Paralyze\" period, both Homme and Van Leeuwen favored semi-hollow guitars with P-90 pickups due to their natural resonance. To prohibit \"bad feedback\", he stuffed pieces of foam into the F-holes of some. On \"Era Vulgaris\" he switched to Fender Telecasters and Jaguars, recorded through small, cheap amps. His guitars are tuned in standard 440, mostly E, and C, though one-off tunings have appeared on a few songs.\nHe is a steady user of Mastery Bridges, utilizing their Offset and Tele models in addition to the Offset Vibrato. Troy has also said that his live rig is considerably different than what he uses during recording, due to the fact that he considers most of his vintage equipment too unreliable for touring. He uses custom gauge Dunlop 11's for standard tuning and 12's for lower tunings. Van Leeuwen uses Silver Hercos .75mm picks, the same picks Jimmy Page uses, and got a signature version of them in early 2017.\n\nIn addition to guitar and lap steel, Troy has also played a Clavia Nord Electro keyboard and later a Moog Little Phattie synthesizer during live performances and recordings. After Nick Oliveri's departure from the band, Troy also played an Epiphone Rivoli bass or a Custom Yamaha SA-bass during several Queens of the Stone Age recordings and the tour following \"Lullabies to Paralyze\", sharing bass playing duties with Alain Johannes, as well as using a blue 1967 Mosrite Ventures bass in the \"Little Sister\" video. Following \"Era Vulgaris\" in which bassist Michael Shuman and keyboardist/guitarist Dean Fertita were hired, Troy went back to being primarily the lead guitarist live—although he also occasionally contributes with synths, lap steel, and back up vocals.\n\nVan Leeuwen has appeared on a wide range of albums from various bands and performers from many genres.\n\n"}

It was written by Dr. Kalam and Arun Tiwari.\n\nKalam examines his early life, effort, hardship, fortitude, luck and chance that eventually led him to lead Indian space research, nuclear and missile programs. Kalam started his career, after graduating from Aerospace engineering at MIT (Chennai), India, at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and was assigned to build a hovercraft prototype. Later\nhe moved to ISRO and helped establish the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre and pioneered the first space launch-vehicle program. During the 1990s and early 2000, Kalam moved to the DRDO to lead the Indian nuclear weapons program, with particular successes in thermonuclear weapons development culminating in the operation Smiling Buddha and an ICBM Agni (missile). Kalam died on 27 July 2015, during a speech at Indian Institute of Management in Shillong, Meghalaya.\n\nThe autobiography first published in English, has so far been translated and published in 13 languages including Hindi, English, Bangla bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Marathi, and Gujarati. Outside of the major Indian languages, \"Wings of Fire\" was translated into Chinese (titled \"Huo Yi\", by Ji Peng), and into French.\n\n\"Wings of Fire\" unfolds the story of Dr.A.P.J.Abdul Kalam from his childhood in the following seven sections:\n\n\nKalam was born in 1931, the son of a little-educated boat owner in Ramaeswaram, Tamil Nadu. His father was also the imam of the small mosque in Rameswaram. He had an unparalleled career as a defence scientist, culminating the highest civilian award of India, Bharat Ratna. As a chief of the country's defence research and development programmer, Kalam demonstrated a great potential for dynamics and innovations that existed in seemingly moribund research establishment. This is the story of Kalam's own rise from obscurity and his personal and professional struggles, as well as the story of AGNI, TRISHUL and NAG missiles that have become household names in India and that have raised the nation to the level of a missile power of international reckoning. Since independence, India has sought in various ways, to self-realization, and to adulation and success.\n\nThe book begins with the childhood of Kalam's life. In the beginning, he introduces us to his family and tries to familiarize us with his birthplace Rameswaram. In the childhood, he was a great admirer of his father, Jainulabdeen. He was a man of great wisdom and kindness, and Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, a close friend of his father and the head priest of the Rameswaram Temple. He had an ideal helpmate in his mother, Ashiamma. He was also influenced by his close friend, Ahmed Jallaluddin; he was about 15 years older than Kalam. With his friend, he talked about spiritual matters. This shows that he believed in spirituality and also believed in God or Khudah. He always went to Lord Shiva's temple with his friends.\nThe later part of the opening chapters, he introduces his cousin Samsuddin, his school teachers and all the people who were felt any difference amongst them. Here he expresses one event, which happened in his school days,\n\"Rameswaram Sastry, a new teacher of his school he could not stomach a Hindu Priest's son sitting with a Muslim boy. In accordance with our social ranking as the new teacher saw it, I was asked to go and sit on the back bench. I felt very sad, and so did my parents about the incident. Lakshmana Sastry summoned the teacher, and in our presence, told the teacher that he should not spread the poison of social inequality and communal intolerance in the minds of innocent children\".\n\nHe completed his school education in the Rameswaram Elementary School and Schwartz High School, Rameswaram. In 1950, he joined St. Joseph's College Trichi, to study for the B.Sc degree course when he realized that physics was not his subject. Then, at last, he applied in Madras Institute of Technology, [MIT]. He or his family could not afford to spend that much of money for the course at MIT. Zohara, his sister stood with him. When he had in a specific branch of aeronautical engineering, the goal was very clear in his mind at that time. And he tried to communicate with different kinds of people. At MIT, their teachers shaped his thoughts, Prof. Sponder, Prof. Kal Pandalai and Prof. Narasingalu Rao. Each of them had carried distinct personalities. Last year MIT was a year of transition and had a great impact on his later life. From MIT, he went out to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, [HAL], at Bangalore as a trainer. There he worked on engine overhauling as part of a team. He had trained in radial engine-cum- drum operations.\nAfter the completion of engineering, he had applied for the Air Force and Directorate of Technical Development and Production –DTP and PC (Air) of the Ministry of Defence. But he was not selected in Air Force because he failed to pass the physical fitness standards. Later, he was appointed in DTP and PC (Air) as senior scientific Assistant on basic salary only of Rs. 250 per month, in 1950. He had to create opportunities on his own. At the stage, he covered 32 eventful years of his life when he was just on the threshold of his career after graduation.\n\nThe section 'Creation' traverses seven chapters, from chapters four to chapter ten; and covers Kalam's life and work for 17 years, from the year 1963 until 1980. It begins with his recollection of works at the Langley Research Center, NASA, in Houston, Virginia, U.S., and at other facilities in the US, including the Wallops Flight Facility at Wallops Island in East Coast of the United States, Virginia. At a NASA facility, he remembers to have seen a painting, prominently displayed in the lobby. The painting depicted a battle scene with a rocket flying in the background. On closer examination, he found that the painting depicted Tipu Sultan's army fighting the British. Kalam felt happy to see an Indian glorified in NASA as a hero of rocketry warfare.\n\nHis association with Thumba and Satellite Launch Vehicle and related projects are vividly presented in the section 'Creation'. During the period covered under 'Creation', Kalam, in the year 1976, lost his father who lived up to 102 years of age. Kalam took the bereavement with courage and remembered these words written on the death of William Butler Yeats by his friend Auden, and his father:\n\nThe period covered in the section 'Creation' also brought Kalam national recognition. A pleasant surprise came in the form of conferment of Padma Bhushan on the Republic Day,1981.\n\nSection \"Propitiation\" covers the period 1981 to 1991.\nThis section covers the scientist's journey towards becoming the \"Missile Man of India\". In this section, his excellent leadership qualities as taking up the responsibility of shaping up the Guided Missile Development Program, are clearly visible. In this phase of the life, Kalam was responsible for the development of the five missiles – Prithvi, Trishul, Akash, Nag and Agni.\n\nThe book has 24 plates with photographs associated with the life and work of Kalam:\n\n"}

His father, Zhang Cuishan, is the fifth apprentice of Zhang Sanfeng, the founder of the Wudang Sect. His mother, Yin Susu, is the daughter of Yin Tianzheng, the leader of the Heavenly Eagle Cult. He was named by his godfather, Xie Xun, in memory of Xie Xun's deceased son, Xie Wuji. He spends his childhood on the island and learns some basic survival skills, martial arts and literacy skills from his parents and godfather. When he turns nine, he returns to the mainland with his parents, while Xie Xun refuses to leave and remains on the island.\n\nUpon their return to the mainland, the Zhang family attract much attention from many martial artists in the \"wulin\" (martial artists' community) who are after Xie Xun and the Dragon Slaying Saber. The Xuanming Elders kidnap Zhang Wuji and severely injure him with their 'Xuanming Divine Palm', but Zhang Sanfeng saves the boy. Zhang Wuji's parents commit suicide after refusing to reveal Xie Xun's whereabouts. Zhang Sanfeng brings the orphaned boy back to the Wudang Sect and tries to cure him of his injuries, but with minimal success. After two years, Zhang Sanfeng brings Zhang Wuji to seek treatment elsewhere and they encounter Chang Yuchun and Zhou Zhiruo. Zhang Sanfeng saves them and entrusts Zhang Wuji to Chang Yuchun's care. Chang Yuchun brings Zhang Wuji to Butterfly Valley to seek help from the eccentric physician Hu Qingniu. Hu Qingniu partially succeeds in healing Zhang Wuji by slowing down the effects of his injuries, and indirectly imparts his medical knowledge to the boy. Zhang Wuji also learns some toxicology from Wang Nangu, Hu Qingniu's wife.\n\nWhile recuperating in Butterfly Valley, Zhang Wuji meets Ji Xiaofu of the Emei Sect and her daughter, Yang Buhui, and becomes close to them. After Ji Xiaofu is killed by Abbess Miejue, Zhang Wuji brings Yang Buhui to her father, Yang Xiao, in the Kunlun Mountains. He encounters Zhu Jiuzhen later and has a crush on her. Her family accepts him and agrees to let him marry her. However, he discovers later that the Zhu family and others are actually planning to trick him into revealing his godfather's whereabouts. He narrowly escapes from death and ends up in Nameless Valley.\n\nZhang Wuji lives in the valley for the next five years. Once, he performs surgery on a white ape suffering from abdominal pain and finds a bundle containing the \"Nine Yang Manual\" inside the ape abdomen. He masters the skills in the manual and fully heals himself in the process. At the same time, he builds up immense inner energy and learns to use the Nine Yang Divine Skill.\n\nZhang Wuji returns to civilisation and meets a disfigured girl, Zhu'er. Through a series of encounters, he reunites with Zhou Zhiruo, who is now a member of the Emei Sect. He also learns that the six major orthodox sects in the \"wulin\" are planning to attack the Ming Cult on Bright Peak. He ventures to the peak ahead of the attackers and uncovers an evil plot by Cheng Kun, his godfather's sworn enemy, to stir up conflict between the Ming Cult and the other sects. He escapes death again narrowly with Xiaozhao, a servant of Yang Xiao's family, whom he meets there. He finds the manual of the 'Heaven and Earth Great Shift' in a secret chamber and masters the skill, which allows him to reach a near-superhuman level of martial arts prowess.\n\nZhang Wuji resolves the conflict between the Ming Cult and the six sects by representing the cult in fighting challengers from the other sects. He exposes Cheng Kun's evil plot and earns the respect of the orthodox sects. At the same time, he is also reunited with his father's fellows from the Wudang Sect and his maternal grandfather, Yin Tianzheng. The Ming Cult's members are grateful to Zhang from saving them and want him to take the cult's leadership position, which has been vacant since the death of the previous leader, Yang Dingtian. Zhang Wuji reluctantly agrees and reforms the cult to improve its relations with the other sects. Eventually, after Zhang Wuji after reunites with Zhang Sanfeng, and under his father's teacher's tutelage, he refines all the martial arts he had learned.\n\nWhile departing to fetch his godfather back to the mainland, Zhang Wuji learns that the members of the six sects have been captured by the Yuan military after they left Bright Peak. The Yuan forces are led by the Mongol princess Zhao Min, who is attracted to Zhang Wuji after encountering him in a few skirmishes. Zhang Wuji succeeds in rescuing the captives and earns further respect from them. The sects finally resolve their animosity with the Ming Cult and become its allies. Meanwhile, Zhao Min has fallen in love with Zhang secretly and she frees the martial artists after an agreement with Zhang, telling him that he must fulfil three conditions. The first one is to allow her to follow him on his adventures, and she will tell him the other two conditions later.\n\nZhang Wuji returns to Ice Fire Island with Zhao Min, Zhou Zhiruo and Xiaozhao, with Golden Flower Granny and her apprentice Yin Li (Zhu'er) secretly tracking them. When Zhang Wuji reunites with his godfather Xie Xun, their reunion is filled with danger as their enemies are coveting the Dragon Slaying Saber. They also meet members of the Persian Ming Cult. Xiaozhao agrees to leave with the Persians to be their leader to replace her mother. Meanwhile, Zhou Zhiruo secretly murders Yin Li and knocks out Zhang Wuji, Zhao Min and Xie Xun with drugs so that she can seize the Dragon Slaying Saber and Heaven Reliant Sword.\n\nZhou Zhiruo frames Zhao Min for Yin Li's murder by casting her adrift while she was unconscious. When Zhang Wuji awakes, he is shocked to see that Yin Li is dead and believes that Zhao Min is responsible. He returns to the mainland with Zhou Zhiruo and his godfather. Xie Xun and Zhou Zhiruo are captured by Cheng Kun and Chen Youliang, who are planning to stir up conflict in the \"wulin\" again. Zhang Wuji finds Zhao Min and wants to kill her to avenge Yin Li, but refrains from doing so as he still loves her and thinks she might be innocent.\n\nZhang Wuji saves Zhou Zhiruo from Chen Youliang's clutches and foils Song Qingshu's attempt to take over the Wudang Sect. A love triangle gradually develops between him, Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo. He decides to marry Zhou Zhiruo to prove his loyalty to her. Zhao Min disrupts the wedding by saying that she knows where his godfather is held captive and telling him that her second condition (per their earlier agreement) is that he cannot marry Zhou Zhiruo. Zhou Zhiruo hates Zhao Min for disrupting the wedding and attacks her viciously with the 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw'.\n\nZhou Zhiruo swears to make Zhang Wuji pay for betraying her love and vows to kill Zhao Min. Zhang Wuji saves Zhao Min and they attend the Lion Slaying Ceremony at Shaolin Monastery, which is actually part of Cheng Kun's plot to destroy the \"wulin\". Xie Xun is used as bait to lure everyone into a trap – as his fate will be decided by the champion of the martial arts contest. Zhou Zhiruo appears at the ceremony and defeats all challengers. Zhang Wuji almost defeats her but he hesitates at the critical moment and loses.\n\nZhou Zhiruo agrees to allow Zhang Wuji to help her fight the three Shaolin elders guarding Xie Xun, as defeating them will clear the last obstacle to claiming the prisoner. Zhang Wuji succeeds in rescuing his godfather while Zhou Zhiruo meets her match at the hands of the Yellow Dress Maiden.\n\nZhang Wuji becomes a key figure in leading the Ming Cult and other rebel forces to overthrow the Yuan dynasty. The rebels defeat the Yuan forces numerous times and draw closer to achieving victory. Meanwhile, he discovers that Yin Li has survived and returned to take her revenge on Zhou Zhiruo. By then, it is clear to him that Zhou Zhiruo was behind the mysterious events on the island. Zhou Zhiruo feels guilty for her deeds and explains to Zhang Wuji that she has been bound by her oath to do so. Meanwhile, Zhang Wuji announces his plans to marry Zhao Min, whom he has finally decided is his true love.\n\nZhang Wuji leaves the Ming Cult after mistakenly believing that the cult members are plotting to assassinate him. However, he is unaware that it is actually Zhu Yuanzhang's plan to take control of the cult's military. Zhang Wuji permanently retires from the \"jianghu\" and names Yang Xiao as his successor. In the last chapter, Zhao Min tells Zhang Wuji that her third condition is for him to help her paint her eyebrows. The story ends here, but in another version, Zhou Zhiruo visits them and makes some cheeky remarks, reminding Zhang Wuji that he has also promised her to do something. She says, \"I haven't thought of it yet. But I'm afraid that I might think of it on your wedding day with Zhao Min.\" Zhang Wuji looks at Zhao Min, then at Zhou Zhiruo, and drops the paintbrush.\n\nZhang Wuji has a more complicated personality as compared to Guo Jing and Yang Guo. He possesses less heroic traits than them and has an equal balance of strengths and weaknesses. The presence of these humanly traits in him makes him more realistic as compared to the other two protagonists in the \"Condor Trilogy\". Zhang Wuji's personality is strongly influenced by social factors and the people around him. He is often placed in situations in which he has no other choice but to adapt to. He has no chance of escaping from harsh reality.\n\nHis relationships with his four love interests (Zhao Min, Zhou Zhiruo, Xiaozhao and Yin Li) are extremely complicated. He is very hesitant and indecisive on who his true love is. Apparently, he loves Zhao Min the most and makes that clear to Zhou Zhiruo at the end of the novel. However, one can really speculate whether, deep inside his heart, he really knows who his true love is.\n\nAlthough Zhang Wuji is a formidable martial artist and probably one of the best of his age, he is not a suitable candidate to be a leader. Undeniably, he maintains a morally upright character and adopts an altruistic approach to his fellows. However, he lacks the qualities and prerequisites of becoming a great leader. On a personal level, he is reluctant to become a leader and only obliges to take up the Ming Cult's leadership position to please his subordinates. He lacks strong power hungry ambitions that a typical leader must have in order for him/her to remain in power. The absence of this important trait in him clearly indicates that he will not become a strong leader and may eventually fail as one.\n\n\n"}

Scientific drilling is a critical tool in understanding of Earth processes and structure. It provides direct insight into Earth processes and critically tests geological models. Results obtained from drilling projects at critical sites can be applied to other areas worldwide. It is, therefore, believed that international cooperation in continental scientific drilling is an essential component for a responsible management strategy for the Earth's natural resources and environment.\n\nThe ICDP was founded in February 1996 in the German Embassy in Tokyo as a result of the German Continental Deep Drilling Program (KTB; 1987-1995). The serves as the headquarters for both the current ICDP and the former KTB project.\n\nICDP supports international science teams with a proven need for continental-based drilling. The proposed projects help to answer societal challenges related to dynamics of planet Earth, contributing to major advances in understanding Earth's environment and life, sustainable geo- and energy resources, as well as safeguarding from natural disasters.\n\nICDP proposals seek to help understand how both the climate and the environment have changed on global and regional scales. Areas of research within this theme include paleoclimate studies investigating the manner in which Earth's past climate has changed, the reasons for such changes, as well as the role of environmental forcing in human evolution, for example in the Eastern Rift Valley of Africa. Other ICDP proposals focus on the effects of volcanism and major impacts on climate and mass extinctions. Deep biosphere research has also become an important component of drilling projects to help get a better understanding of evolution and extent of life on Earth. Other proponents of deep-life that coincide with ICDP goals include addressing metabolic rates, carbon cycling, and energy sources of subsurface microbial activity, how microbial life has adapted to the more extreme conditions of subsurface habitats, and the role of the deep biosphere on the geosphere and atmosphere.\n\nThere is a rise in demand for renewable and clean energy resources to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Knowing the composition, structure and evolution of Earth's crust can help to understand how best to manage and use Earth's resources and environment. Research is needed in this area to determine sustainable practices in exploring and exploiting natural resources. ICDP undertakes a variety of scientific drilling projects to study the origin of mineral resources and to discover new unconventional resources such as gas hydrates and geothermal energy.\n\nResearch areas within sustainable georesources include the nature of the deep biosphere and its relation to geologic processes such as hydrocarbon maturation, ore deposition and energy resources, the origin and evolution of sedimentary basins and hydrocarbon resources, and the role of various geologic settings, including volcanoes and plate boundaries, in ore deposit formation. Other georesource studies include understanding the stresses, such as urbanization and sea-level-rise, on freshwater resources and heat and mass transfer. The transfer of heat and mass, i.e. magma, hot fluids, groundwater and sediment, controls the concentration of metals and hydrocarbons as well as providing renewable geothermal energy resources.\n\nICDP has accepted many proposals related to formation, potential hazard, and mitigation associated with fault boundaries, volcanoes, impact structures and plate margins. Topics include, but are not limited to, earthquakes generated on fault boundaries like San Andreas Fault and North Anatolian Fault Zone, geophysical and geochemical properties of different volcanic sources, impact basin evolution and effect on Earth's environment and ecology, and tsunamis generation.\n\nThe International Continental Scientific Drilling Program accepts proposals each year by January 15 from individual or groups of scientists from member countries (See Members). Proposals are selected based primarily on scientific merits and expected impacts. The steps from project to proposal include submission of a pre-proposal letter by the Principal Investigators followed by the development of Workshop Proposal and Full Proposal if the pre-proposal is recommended.\n\nCurrently, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States and UNESCO are members of the ICDP.\n\n\n"}

The band was composed of singer-songwriter Howie Payne, guitarist Luke Thomson, bassist Dean Ravera and drummer Steve Pilgrim.\n\nThey released two albums, before Pilgrim and Thomson left the band following the release of their second album. The band toured the album with drummer Graeme Robinson and guitarist Paul Molloy. They split up in November 2005, shortly after parting ways with their label Echo Records.\n\nThe Stands were formed by Howie Payne in 2002 following the split of the Edgar Jones fronted The Big Kids, for whom Payne had played lead guitar. Early local shows featured a revolving cast of backing musicians, including brother Sean Payne and Russell Pritchard (both fellow ex-Big Kids members and later of The Zutons) and session player Martyn Campbell. Payne then set about putting together a more permanent lineup and recruited local acoustic singer-songwriter/drummer Steve Pilgrim on drums and Luke Thomson on guitar. The trio, along with Campbell on Bass, recorded a selection of demos at Parr St Studios in Liverpool, which were reportedly financed by Payne roadying for The Zutons on the first UK tour.\n\nIn September 2002, the ITV program \"This Is Music\" filmed a special episode focusing on the emerging new music scene in Liverpool, centered on The Bandwagon night, ran by members of local band The Bandits at The Zanzibar venue. Due to the band being newly formed and having performed few shows, they were not set to appear until the other bands petitioned the producers of the show to add The Stands to the program, which they did and the band performed All Years Leaving, with Russell Pritchard filling in on bass. Having watched the band perform, local musician Dean Ravera asked to join the band after the show. He joined the band a week later and the band were shortly after invited to support The Coral on their imminent autumn UK tour. During the tour, Payne received a phone call from Noel Gallagher who had been given a copy of the Parr St demos by Martyn Campbell at the Oasis show at Old Trafford Cricket Ground, where Campbell was playing with support act Richard Ashcroft. Gallagher invited the band to support Oasis at their upcoming show in Liverpool at the Royal Court in December 2002, and were subsequently asked to support Oasis again for two nights at the NIA in Birmingham. In early 2003 and still unsigned without management, the band supported the likes of The Burn, Alfie, Stephen Fretwell, The Zutons and further shows with The Coral. The band were also invited to play Glastonbury, V Festival, T in the park and two further shows with Oasis at the Point Theatre in Dublin.\n\nIn Spring 2003, the band signed to Echo Records and began recording their debut album at Noel Gallagher's Wheeler End recording studio. In the middle of recording, the band joined Jet on their Get Born tour in the UK and Europe. The two bands formed a friendship that resulted in Jet inviting the band to join them on their homecoming tour of Australia.\n\nThe band released their debut single \"When This River Rolls Over You\" in August 2003 and follow-up single \"I Need You\" in October 2003.\n\nThe band's debut album \"All Years Leaving\" was released in February 2004 and entered the UK Albums Chart at number 28. The album produced three Top 40 singles in the UK Singles Chart. Gallagher and Coral guitar Bill Ryder-Jones appear on the album\n\nIn 2004, the band supported Gomez and Paul Weller, and along with their first headline tours of the UK and Europe, the band played their first US shows in L.A's Troubador and El Rey clubs. The band again played the Glastonbury, V and T festivals along with The Isle of Wight Festival and the Asagari Jam Festival in Japan. In October 2004 The Stands relocated to Los Angeles, California to record their second album, \"Horse Fabulous\" with Beck and Elliott Smith producer Tom Rothrock at Sunset Sound Studios. Shortly after the recording of this album, Steve Pilgrim left the band to pursue a solo career.\n\nThe band recruited new drummer Graeme Robinson, and supported Brendan Benson in the US and Oasis again in Europe. During a return break to England during the Oasis support tour, Luke Thomson left the band. Paul Molloy (later of The Zutons) was recruited to play the remaining shows. \"Do It Like You Like\", the band's fifth single, entered the UK Top 30 in May 2005, and the band embarked on a second tour of the U.S. and toured the UK festival circuit through the summer. \"Horse Fabulous\" was released on 25 July 2005 and spent one week in the UK Albums Chart.\n\nIn Summer 2005, the Chrysalis Group announced a restructuring of The Echo Label after announcing a loss of over £2.0 million.. This resulted in a change of direction at the label and dropping many of its roster including I Am Kloot, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and The Stands. The band's second album \"Horse Fabulous\" was released just two weeks prior to this announcement and it is likely the changes affected the album's promotion. Without a record deal, The Stands embarked on a fourth UK tour in September 2005, climaxing in their final show at the Carling Academy Islington, London. The band broke up in November 2005 shortly after their final gig as part of the Love Music Hate Racism campaign in memory of murdered schoolboy Anthony Walker at University of Liverpool on Thursday 27 October 2005.\n\nHowie Payne released his debut solo album \"Bright Light Ballads\", produced by Ethan Johns in April 2009 under his full name Howard Eliott Payne. Five songs written by Payne were recorded by Ren Harviue for her debut album \"Through The Night\", released in April 2012.\n\nSteve Pilgrim recorded with Cast frontman John Power on his solo albums \"Willow She Weeps\" and \"Stormbreaker\" and toured as The John Power Band with bassist Jay Lewis. He has released two solo albums, collaborated with Japanese folktronica artist Akeboshi and is currently a member of Paul Weller's live band..\n\nLuke Thomson and Steve Pilgrim played together in Cuckolds from 2005 to 2006. Luke is currently working on a solo project.\n\nDean Ravera played electric and double bass on Payne's debut solo album. He now plays double bass, keys and drums for folk group The Unthanks and played double bass on their fourth album, \"Last\". He played double bass on the debut album \"Kite\" by Jonny Kearney & Lucy Farrell, which was released on 10 October 2011, and also on Bill Ryder-Jones debut EP \"A Leave Taking Soundtrack\" and album \"If...\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1859006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859006", "title": "Spiroplasma", "text": "Spiroplasma\n\nSpiroplasma is a genus of Mollicutes, a group of small bacteria without cell walls. \"Spiroplasma\" shares the simple metabolism, parasitic lifestyle, fried-egg colony morphology and small genome of other \"Mollicutes\", but has a distinctive helical morphology, unlike \"Mycoplasma\". It has a spiral shape and moves in a corkscrew motion. Many \"Spiroplasma\" are found either in the gut or haemolymph of insects where they can act to manipulate host reproduction, or defend the host as endosymbionts. \"Spiroplasma\" are also disease-causing agents in the phloem of plants. Spiroplasmas are fastidious organisms, which require a rich culture medium. Typically they grow well at 30 °C, but not at 37 °C. A few species, notably \"Spiroplasma mirum\", grow well at 37 °C (human body temperature), and cause cataracts and neurological damage in suckling mice. The best studied species of spiroplasmas are \"Spiroplasma poulsonii\", a reproductive manipulator and defensive insect symbiont, \"Spiroplasma citri\", the causative agent of citrus stubborn disease, and \"Spiroplasma kunkelii\", the causative agent of corn stunt disease.\n\nThere is some disputed evidence for the role of spiroplasmas in the etiology of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), due primarily to the work of Frank Bastian, summarized below. Other researchers have failed to replicate this work, while the prion model for TSEs has gained very wide acceptance. A 2006 study appears to refute the role of spiroplasmas in the best small animal scrapie model (hamsters). Bastian et al. (2007) have responded to this challenge with the isolation of a spiroplasma species from scrapie-infected tissue, grown it in cell-free culture, and demonstrated its infectivity in ruminants.\n\nMany \"Spiroplasma\" strains are vertically-transmitted endosymbionts of \"Drosophila\" species, with a variety of host-altering mechanisms similar to \"Wolbachia\". These strains are from the \"Spiroplasma poulsonii\" clade, and can have important effects on host fitness. The \"S. poulsonii\" strain of \"Drosophila neotestacea\" protects its host against parasitic nematodes. This interaction is an example of defensive symbiosis, where the fitness of the symbiont is intricately tied to the fitness of the host. The \"D. neotestacea\" \"S. poulsonii\" also defends its fly host from infestation by parasitic wasps. The mechanism through which \"S. poulsonii\" attacks nematodes and parasitic wasps relies on the presence of toxins called ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), similar to Sarcin or Ricin. These toxins depurinate a conserved adenine site in eukaryotic 28s ribosomal RNA called the Sarcin-Ricin loop by cleaving the N-glycosidic bond between the rRNA backbone and the adenine. \"Spiroplasma\" associations highlight a growing movement to consider heritable symbionts as important drivers in patterns of evolution.\n\nThe \"S. poulsonii\" strain of \"Drosophila melanogaster\" can also attack parasitoid wasps, but is not regarded as a primarily defensive symbiont. This is because this \"D. melanogaster\" \"Spiroplasma\" (called MSRO) kills \"D. melanogaster\" eggs fertilized by Y-bearing sperm. This mode of reproductive manipulation benefits the symbiont as the female fly has a greater reproductive output than males. The genetic basis of this male-killing was discovered in 2018, solving a decades-old mystery of how the bacteria targeted male-specific cells. In an interview with the Global Health Institute, Dr. Toshiyuki Harumoto said this discovery is the first example of a bacterial effector protein that affects host cellular machinery in a sex-specific manner, and the first endosymbiont factor identified to explain the cause of male-killing. Thus it should have a big impact on the fields of symbiosis, sex determination, and evolution.\n\nBeyond \"Drosophila\", \"Spiroplasma\" of the \"apis\", \"chrysopicola\", \"citri\", \"mirum\", and \"poulsonii\" clades are found in many insects and arthropods, including bees, ants, beetles, and butterflies. Male-killing is also found in the \"Spiroplasma\" of the ladybug \"Harmonia axyridis\" and the plain tiger butterfly. In the plain tiger butterfly, the consequences have led to speciation.\n\n\"Spiroplasma citri\" is the causative agent of Citrus stubborn disease, a plant disease affecting species in the genus \"Citrus\". It infects the phloem of the affected plant, causing fruit deformities. \"Spiroplasma kunkelii\" is also referred to as Corn Stunt Spiroplasma as it is the causative agent of Corn stunt disease, a disease of corn and other grasses that stunts plant growth. \"Spiroplasma kunkelii\" represents a major economic risk, as corn production in the United States is an industry worth over $50 billion. Both \"Spiroplasma citri\" and \"Spiroplasma kunkelii\" are transmitted by leafhoppers.\n\n\n"}

It is endemic to Kenya.\n\nIt is 16–17 cm long, with upperparts heavily marked with buff and rufous streaks, yellow underparts, and white outertail feathers in flight.\n\nThis bird is endangered, with an estimated population of less than 20,000. Its grassland habitat is being replaced by cultivation and woodlots.\n\nThe common name and Latin binomial name commemorate the British zoologist Richard Bowdler Sharpe.\n\nSharpe's longclaw was described by the English ornithologist Frederick John Jackson in 1904 from specimens collected in the Mau Plateau area of Kenya. He coined the binomial name \"Macronyx sharpei\". Both the common name and the specific epithet honour the English ornithologist and museum curator Richard Bowdler Sharpe.\n\nThe Sharpe's longclaw is a member of the family Motacillidae, which includes the pipits and wagtails. Some ornithologists place the species with the yellow-breasted pipit in the separate genus \"Hemimacronyx\". The two species are closely related and form a superspecies. This genus, along with the golden pipit in the genus \"Tmetothylacus\" and the longclaws form an exclusively African clade within the family, separate from the true pipits in the genus \"Anthus\" and the wagtails.\n\nThe Sharpe's longclaw is found in the highlands of west and central Kenya. It has a restricted distribution, occurring on the northern slopes of Mount Kenya, the southern slopes of the Aberdares, on the Gishu, Mau and Kinangop Plateaus around the Rift Valley, and the Kenyan slopes of Mount Elgon (possibly the Ugandan slopes as well).\n\nThe natural habitat of the species is open treeless grassland with short and often tussocky grasses. It ranges between in altitude, although more commonly below . It occurs at higher altitudes than the yellow-throated longclaw, with little overlap between the ranges of the two species. It is generally non-migratory, but will travel short distances when its habitat becomes too dry.\n\nThe Sharpe's longclaw feeds on insects, particularly grasshoppers and beetles. Other invertebrates are taken as well. Within its range it has a higher feeding rate in grasslands with tussocks. The species forages alone or in pairs, sometimes in small family groups.\n\nThe Sharpe's longclaw is a monogamous and solitary breeder that defends a territory. The breeding season is during or after the rains, from March to June, September to October and in December. The species has a brief aerial breeding display, where the bird flies up and then drops, singing rapidly as it drops. The nest is a well-made cup of dried grass lined with roots and placed near the ground at the base of a grass tussock or under a shrub or plant. Between two and three eggs are laid.\n\n"}

He attended/graduated Charles P. Caldwell Elementary School and James H. Bowen High School. Smith spent most of his young life as a construction worker, but has written poetry since he was 19. He considers himself a socialist.\n\nSmith started at an open mic night at the Get Me High lounge in November 1984 called the Monday Night Poetry Reading. Even as poets scoffed at artists \"performing\" their work, rather than genteelly \"reading\" it, the event grew in popularity. Smith saw his approach as an \"up yours\" to establishment poets he considered snooty and effete, because at their events, \"no one was listening\".\n\nAccording to Smith, who once attended a conventional reading with his manuscripts concealed inside a newspaper, \nWith a like-minded troupe, Smith hosted the first poetry slam at the Get Me High Lounge in the Bucktown neighborhood in 1986. The event soon migrated to the Green Mill, a tavern and jazz lounge in Chicago's Uptown neighborhood, where it has remained ever since. Other poets in the first slam were Mike Barrett, Rob Van Tuyle, Jean Howard, Anna Brown, Karen Nystrom, Dave Cooper, and John Sheehan, all fellow members of the Chicago Poetry Ensemble. According to Smith, the first slam was more variety show than competition. Though all slams vary in format, Smith is considered responsible for key features, including the selection of judges from the audience and cash prizes.\n\nAs stated in the PBS television series, \"The United States of Poetry\", a \"strand of new poetry began at Chicago's Green Mill Tavern in 1987 when Marc Smith found a home for the Poetry Slam.\" Smith had found a crowd-inclusive, entertaining method for nurturing the poetry scene. Since then, the poetry slam has spread throughout the world, exported to over 500 cities large and small.\n\nIn the book, \"Words in Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam\", author Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz describes the influential Smith:\n\nSince July 1986, Smith has run the Uptown Poetry Slam, a three-hour show featuring an open mic (1 hour), feature—poet or professional touring act (1 hour), and the poetry slam. It is the longest-running, weekly poetry show in the country, and one of the longest-running shows in Chicago history.\n\nIn 1990, the first National Poetry Slam was held in San Francisco (with three city teams attending including Chicago and New York City), and has continued to rotate among cities. The National Poetry Slam currently sees over 80 teams of poets vying for the title.\n\nOver the years, Smith has turned down offers to commercialize the slam, including movie offers and bids for corporate sponsorship. Smith says that what he considers to be Slam's increased commercial exploitation, and Def Poetry Jam in particular, as having \"diminished the value and aesthetic of performance poetry.\" This, combined with a continuing lack of Slam's recognition by \"big literature festivals and institutions\" in America, has led Smith to become more invested in performance poetry in Europe, where he says the \"audiences are growing over there. And the aesthetic is growing and evolving.\" \n\nSmith has published several books about the poetry slam movement, as well as publishing two books of his own work. He tours extensively, performing his own, blue-collar, Carl Sandburg-influenced poetry and hosting poetry slams. He also tours with a show titled \"Sandburg to Smith-Smith to Sandburg,\" which combines the work of both poets with live jazz.\n\n\n\n"}

Although the Mongol system of administration and governance during the brief era was not exactly peaceful, the Pax Mongolica was a time of relative peace throughout the Old World that led to an increase of trade, as well as an increase in awareness, between distant nations. In essence, the Mongol Empire administered political order over a very large area of land which enabled relative political and economic stability to follow.\n\nIn the face of the ethnic, religious and tribal diversity of the civilians and soldiers of the Mongol Empire, which eventually included modern day Persians, Chinese and many Turkic peoples, Genghis Khan insisted on focusing all loyalty on himself as Great Khan and no others. Thus, Genghis Khan had no room for the traditional clan- and kindred-based divisions that were common in central Asian society. Obedience was expected from everyone from the lowest to the highest classes. Any disobedience by a subordinate officer to any order from a superior officer was reason for death.\n\nGenghis Khan revolutionized his military by incorporating the decimal system in his army. He arranged his army into \"arbans\" (inter-ethnic groups of ten), and the members of an \"arban\" were commanded to be loyal to one another regardless of ethnic origin. The military units sizes were based on factors of 10: arbans (10 people), zuuns (100), Mingghans (1000) and tumens (10,000). This decimal system organization of Genghis Khan's strong military proved very effective in conquering, by persuasion or force, the many tribes of the central Asian steppe, but it also strengthened Mongol society as a whole.\n\nGenghis Khan’s united Mongol nation formed the foundation of the largest continuous land empire ever known. A wise statesman, Genghis also established Mongolian-style democracy that respected the ethnic and cultural diversity of his and other businesses were also found out of their own way in terms that they would sell more \n\n\nGenghis Khan preferred to rule through existing hierarchies, but where he was resisted he destroyed the existing aristocracy. Nevertheless, he created at the same time a rough meritocracy among the Mongols. Positions of honor were given on the basis of bravery in battle or outstanding loyalty, as opposed to the old system of inheritance through families. This was far ahead of any other system in Europe at the time.\n\nVarious languages spread, such as Turkish, replacing long-established Persian-speaking populations who were mostly wiped out. Many different kinds of religion existed under a limited degree of freedom of religion.\nHowever, in later life, Genghis began to research the various religions of the people he had suppressed. Theories differ as to why. The outcome was a general freedom of religion, and an exemption of taxes for priests.\n\nHaving conquered a vast land, Genghis Khan and his successors encouraged trade and exchange. Mongols valued goods that came from other lands and peoples. A unified Mongol Empire made travel across Asia far easier for Europeans than it had been under a fractured group of minor kings, facilitating greater exposure to the West and travel for Western traders such as Marco Polo.\nBecause of the extent of his empire, Genghis Khan deeply affected the cultures of many Asian countries, most notably Russia.\n"}

His father was a confederate soldier who went on to become mayor of Tuskegee and sheriff of Macon County. He was educated in public schools and graduated from Tuskegee's Park High School in 1878. From there Thompson attended Bryant & Stratton Business College. Thompson married Estelle Alley on April 20, 1880. The couple had two children, Ernest W. and Charles Winston Jr., before her death on March 19, 1894.

Her socialite grandmother introduced her to the world of fashion, taking young Carolina to shows by Balenciaga and buying her outfits at Lanvin and Dior. She has said, \"My eye was accustomed to seeing pretty things.\"\n\nIn 1965, Herrera began her career working as a publicist for Emilio Pucci, a Florentine Marquis himself and a close family friend. She began working at Pucci's Caracas boutique, and moved to New York in 1980. Frequently associating with Mick and Bianca Jagger and Andy Warhol, at Studio 54, she became well known for her dramatic style. She first appeared on the International Best Dressed List in 1972, then was elected to its Hall of Fame in 1980. In 1981, her friend Diana Vreeland, then Editor-in-Chief of \"Vogue\" suggested that Carolina design a clothing line. She did so, having samples made in Caracas, and debuted her collection at Manhattan's Metropolitan Club to critical acclaim. A well known Park Avenue boutique, Martha's, agreed to showcase her clothing in their prominent windows.

In 2008, they launched a ready-to-wear brand called CH Carolina Herrera; as of 2012, there were 18 Carolina Herrera and CH Carolina Herrera boutiques in the world, and her lines were carried in 280 stores in 104 countries. As of 2011, her daughters Carolina Jr. and Patricia Lansing participated in the creative direction and design. In February 2016, it was reported by \"WWD\" that the fragrance side of the business had more than 25,000 points of sale across the globe while the CH brand included 129 freestanding stores.\n\nIn 2015, the first advert for the brand was released, featuring models Elisabeth Erm and Joséphine Le Tutour.\n\nIn July 2016, Herrera announced the release of her new women's fragrance to be available for purchase in September, her biggest fragrance launch in 14 years. The scent is called 'Good Girl' and Karlie Kloss is the face of the fragrance.\n\nIn 2018, Herrera showed her last line for her eponymous brand and handed creative directorship of the brand over to Wes Gordon.\n\nIn 2008, Herrera was awarded the Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, and \"Womenswear Designer of the Year\" in 2004. Herrera is a recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence as well as Spain's Gold Medal for Merit in the Fine Arts, which was presented to her in 2002 by King Juan Carlos I. She was awarded the Gold Medal of the Queen Sofía Spanish Institute in 1997.\n\nShe received the Fashion Group International Superstar Award, the Style Awards Designer of the Year in 2012 and the \"Mercedes-Benz Presents\" title for her 2011 collection. She has been on the cover of \"Vogue\" seven times.\n\nSince 2004, she has been a member of the board of directors of jewelry designer Mimi So, and since 1999 on the board of the CFDA.\n\nIn 2014, she earned the 2014 Couture Council Award for Artistry of Fashion.\n\nIn 1957, at the age of 18, Herrera married Guillermo Behrens Tello, a Venezuelan landowner. Before their eventual divorce in 1964, they became the parents of two daughters:\n\n\nIn 1968, in Caracas, she married Reinaldo Herrera Guevara, who had inherited the Spanish title The in 1962 upon his father's death. Reinaldo was the host of \"Buenos Días\", a Venezuelan morning-television news program and the elder son of Don Reinaldo Herrera Uslar, 4th Marquis of Torre Casa, a prominent Venezuelan sugarcane plantation owner, aristocrat and art collector. Therefore, by marriage, Carolina held the title The Marquise consort of Torre Casa, until it was retracted in 1992, as Reinaldo had issued no son. Her husband is a special-projects editor of \"Vanity Fair\" magazine. Together, they have two daughters, and six grandchildren, including:\n\n\nIn 2009, Herrera became a naturalized United States citizen.\n\n"}

He sat on the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, and in 2006 he became a Shadow Minister for Wales under Menzies Campbell.\n\nMark Williams is a graduate of the University of Wales, Aberystwyth and the University of Plymouth, and was Deputy Headteacher of a school in Llangorse near Brecon before becoming an MP.\n\nMark Williams was born in Hertfordshire on 24 March 1966. His mother worked as a classroom assistant, and his father ran a printing business. He has two older sisters. He attended the local village primary school and then Richard Hale Secondary School, Hertford, from where he moved on to the University of Wales, Aberystwyth in 1984 to study politics. It was at school during the days of the SDP-Liberal Alliance that he become involved in Liberal politics, later saying: \n\nWithin a week of arriving in Aberystwyth, Williams became secretary of the student group and had met local Liberal MP Geraint Howells. After graduating, he became a part-time researcher to the Liberal Peers in the House of Lords, but was determined to stay in Ceredigion and spent half the week and all Parliamentary holidays as assistant to Geraint Howells in Ceredigion until Howells lost Ceredigion in the 1992 General Election.\n\nHe then returned to student life at the teacher training college in Exmouth, part of the University of Plymouth. After securing this qualification he taught in primary schools in Penzance and Barnstaple before becoming a Deputy Head teacher in Llangors School, Powys, in 2000. During this time Williams fought Monmouth at the 1997 general election, finishing third.\n\nIn February 2000, after a spell as President of Ceredigion Liberal Democrats, Williams was selected to fight the Ceredigion seat in the by-election caused by the resignation of Cynog Dafis. In that by-election the Liberal Democrats rose back into second place, and in the general election of 2001 consolidated that second, and were just 3,944 votes behind Plaid Cymru. In May 2005, 13 years after Geraint Howells had been defeated, the Liberal Democrats regained Ceredigion with Mark Williams as MP by a very narrow majority of 219 votes. Williams is the first non-Welsh-speaking Member of Parliament to represent the constituency since the widening of the electoral franchise in 1867. In 2010, Williams substantially increased his majority, winning just over 50% of the vote; this was the first time any candidate had won more than 50% of the vote in Ceredigion since 1959.\n\nWilliams sat on the Welsh Affairs Select Committee between 2005 and 2017 and held various shadow ministerial roles in the 2005–2010 Parliament.\n\nHe called for Saint David's Day to be made a public holiday in Wales.\n\nHe proposed a private member's bill with the backing of a leading charity to update child protection legislation. It will amend the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 because it only covers physical harm and does not cover psychological neglect. The bill is backed by Action for Children.\n\nWilliams was defeated in the 2017 general election by Ben Lake of Plaid Cymru, whose majority of 104 made the seat one of the most marginal in the country. The result left the Liberal Democrat Party without an MP in Wales, a situation which had not existed since the founding of the Liberal Party in 1859. He resigned as leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats shortly after.\n\nWilliams unsuccessful re-contensted Ceredigion in the next general election, following the election he paid tribute to his Plaid Cymru opponent and then subsequently announced he would not stand for parliament again.\n\nWestminister Parliament elections\nMark Williams and his wife Helen have four children, Eleanor, Anna, and twins Eliza and Oliver.\n\n"}

The primary goal of the IPS is to encourage the sharing of ideas among its members through conferences, publications, and networking. By sharing their insights and creative work, IPS members become better planetarians.\n\nIPS membership is open to anyone interested in planetariums. Members include directors, teachers, technicians, writers, artists, media specialists, digital artists and producers, presenters, vendors, scientists, students, and sponsors and friends of the planetarium dome and its starry sky.\n\nMore than 20 regional and national planetarium associations from around the world are affiliated with IPS. Representatives from those affiliates, together with the elected officers, make up the Executive Council, the ruling body of the organization.\n\nIPS members receive the quarterly journal \"Planetarian\"; attend biennial conferences on even-numbered years; receive conference proceedings, and special publications. Member-only benefits are available through the IPS website at ips-planetarium.org, where interested persons also can join.\n\n\"Planetarian\" is the IPS quarterly membership journal and an important member benefit.

{"id": "1859061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859061", "title": "Red slug", "text": "Red slug\n\nThe red slug (Arion rufus), also known as the large red slug, chocolate arion and European red slug, is a species of land slug in the family Arionidae, the roundback slugs.\n\nSlugs in the genus \"Arion\" have the pneumostome (respiratory pore) in the front part of the mantle and a round back without a keel. \"Arion rufus\" is one of the largest species in the genus, up to 150 mm extended. As an adult it lacks the lateral bands found in many smaller congeners, but in some forms the sides are paler than the back. The body colour is often reddish, sometimes vividly so, but orange, yellowish, brown and greyish forms are also usual, and some individuals may be black. The foot fringe is vertically striped and is often a different colour than the back. The head and tentacles are often darker than the rest of the body. The mucus is sticky and colourless or orange. Externally the species is not reliably distinguishable from several other species, including \"A. ater\" and \"A. vulgaris\", and can be difficult to distinguish from less closely related species such as \"A. flagellus\", especially in the Iberian Peninsula where further similar species exist.\n\nEggs are typically about 5 mm in diameter, slighly ovoid. They are opaque white, because of a calcareous layer in the shell. Juveniles often have lateral bands.\n\nAdult \"A. rufus\" and \"A. ater\" are straightforward to distinguish from \"A. vulgaris\" and \"A. flagellus\" by dissection; in the former pair the oviduct is thinner because the ligula is positioned in the upper atrium, not the oviduct. The anatomical differences between \"A. rufus\" and \"A. ater\" are more subtle: the latter tends to have a larger lower atrium, and its ligula differs (e.g. bowl-shaped rather than C-shaped).\n\n\"Arion rufus\" will often rock spectacularly from side to side when irritated, which is useful to distinguish it from \"A. flagellus\" and generally from \"A. vulgaris\", but not from \"A. ater\".\n\nLinnaeus described \"A. rufus\" together with \"Arion ater\" in 1758. His description consisted mainly of references to earlier published descriptions from around Europe. Recently a lectotype for \"A. rufus\" has been designated from amongst the specimens to which Linnaeus indirectly referred. This is a non-surviving specimen amongst those that Martin Lister described from Almondbury in West Yorkshire, England.\n\n\"Arion rufus\" can be externally indistinguishable from \"Arion ater\". There are anatomical differences between the taxa in their genitalia, but they hybridise, and so they have often been considered conspecific, particularly by British authors. The appropriate name is then \"Arion ater rufus\" (i.e. a subspecies of \"A. ater\"), following the decision of Fleming (\"the first reviser\", in 1822) to give \"A. ater\" precedence over \"A. rufus\".\n\nDifferences in mitochondrial DNA and minor anatomical differences exist between populations of \"A. rufus\" found in the British Isles and the commonest form found on the European continent. These have been given the status of species or subspecies. Because of the designation of the lectotype, the name \"rufus\" now refers to the British form, which may be called \"Arion rufus\", \"Arion rufus rufus\" or \"Arion ater rufus\" depending on which taxa are considered as species or subspecies. Garsault (1764) appears to have been the first to describe the Continental form under a name other than \"rufus\", so its name should be \"Arion ruber\", \"Arion rufus ruber\" or \"Arion ater ruber\". Quite possibly there are further forms of similar status from elsewhere in France and Spain.\n\n\"Arion rufus\" is widespread in western Europe, including France, the Low Countries, Germany, western Poland, Switzerland and the southern parts of the British Isles. In Scandinavia and northern Britain the closely related species \"A. ater\" occurs in its place, but \"A. rufus\" has invaded parts of Scandinavia over the last 200 years. It is also extending its range further eastward in Europe, and even in eastern Germany it is possibly an old introduction. Its status in Spain is uncertain because of the presence there of other similar species. \"Arion rufus\" is also known as an introduction in North America. A related form, reddish in coloration but perhaps more closely related to \"A. ater\" s.s., has recently turned up in Turkey, on both sides of the Bosphorus.\n\nIt is familiar from gardens and parks as well as disturbed agricultural landscapes, but also from a diversity of natural habitats including woodland, meadows, margins of water bodies, coastal habitat, and moorland. However, in much of its range \"A. rufus\" has declined dramatically over the last decades due to replacement by the externally similar \"Arion vulgaris\".\n\nThe species is adult in summer, although the timings vary by a month or so between localities. Typical would be for some individuals to reach adult size in May, but to mature only in July, with some surviving until October. The eggs hatch over a broad period from late autumn to spring and studies find great variation in growth rate. Adults are on average over 300 times the mass of hatchlings. The life cycle is predominantly annual; but possibly a few late hatchlings overwinter as juveniles and mature only 18 months or so after hatching.\n\nAt rest \"A. rufus\" contracts into a hemispherical shape. When disturbed, it performs a rocking motion, sometimes for many minutes. Although predominantly nocturnal, rain brings it out during daylight. It is an omnivore.\n\n\"Arion rufus\" is hermaphrodite and during its mating spermatophores are swapped reciprocally. Mating typically starts with one slug following the other, periodically nibbling its tail. When the leading slug doubles back, they may form a wheel configuration circling clockwise, with each nibbling the other. This soon evolves into the yin-yang configuration (or the wheel step may be skipped), with each animal hooked around the other, their genital pores pressed together, the configuration no longer rotating. The genitalia take some minutes to engage and evert, the epiphallus (spermatophore producing organ) connecting to the bursa trunk of the other, mutually. This may take several attempts and sometimes is unsuccessful. Then the genital atria evert, and swell rapidly (1–2 min) to form a large, white, spherical mass between the bodies. The slugs remain like this for 90 minutes or longer, during which time a spermatophore is manufactured, filled with sperm, and in part passed over to the partner, hidden by the enveloping atria. Eventually one partner starts to become active, the configuration consequently rotates, the atria contract, and the genitalia separate. The spermatophores, anchored in the bursa trunk, are thereby pulled out of the donor's epiphallus. As the genitalia fully retract the spermatophore is taken in.\n\n"}

Anderson was known to have a knack for stepping up in big games, which garnered him the reputation of a \"money\" player. His five playoff overtime goals rank third in NHL history, while his 17 playoff game-winning goals put him fifth all-time. During the playoffs, Anderson accumulated 93 goals, 121 assists, and 214 points, the fourth, ninth, and fourth most in NHL history. Anderson is also first all-time in regular season game winning goals in Oilers history with 72.\n\nAt a young age, Anderson admired the European aspects of the game. He was known to have a liking for participating in international tournaments, more so than his NHL contemporaries. When he was drafted by the Oilers in 1979, he chose to play for Team Canada at the 1980 Winter Olympics instead of immediately joining the Oilers. Anderson won gold at the 1984 and the 1987 Canada Cup and he was a silver medalist at the 1989 Ice Hockey World Championships. During his NHL career, Anderson was part of six Stanley Cup winning teams (he won five as a member of the Oilers and one as a member of the Rangers) and he was a participant at four All-Star Games. He is one of only seven Oilers players to have won all five Cups in franchise history. Anderson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 10, 2008 and his jersey number, 9, was retired by the Oilers on January 18, 2009.\n\nAnderson was born in Vancouver and raised in Burnaby, British Columbia. His father, Magnus, is the son of a Norwegian immigrant, and his mother, Anne, is of Ukrainian origin. He has two brothers (Allan and David) and a sister (Pam). As a young child, Anderson did not enjoy the game of ice hockey. His first ever goal was in his own net. However, as he grew older, and developed his skills, Anderson's love of the game increased over time. As a youth, he and teammate Ken Berry played in the 1972 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Burnaby.\n\nGrowing up, Anderson played hockey with his childhood friends. Anderson's hockey idol was not Canadian; instead, his favourite player was Russian Alexander Yakushev, whom he had watched play during the 1972 Summit Series. Glenn eventually produced the one hour documentary \"To Russia With Love\", released in September 2012, about the way Russia changed the Canadian ice hockey game.\n\nAnderson began his junior hockey career with the Bellingham Blazers of the British Columbia Junior Hockey League (BCJHL) during the 1977–78 season. In 64 games, Anderson recorded 62 goals, 69 assists, and 131 points, the third most goals and eighth most points in the league. To top off his lone season in the BCJHL, he was named to the league's Second All-Star Team.\n\nIn 1978–79, Anderson was recruited to play for the hockey team of the University of Denver in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) by Marshall Johnston, the University team's head coach. Anderson played in 41 games, and led the team in points with 55.\n\nIn the 1979 NHL Entry Draft Anderson was drafted 69th overall by the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He opted to play for Team Canada during the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. Father David Bauer, in charge of the national team program, accepted Anderson. Father Bauer's influence on Anderson was significant as he would cite him as a major reason for his later success. The team toured the world playing different opponents in preparation for the Olympics. The practice Anderson received during this time helped \"greatly improve\" his skills. Anderson scored four points in six games during the tournament.\n\nThe Canadian National Team program was discontinued in the Fall of 1980. Facing a choice of whether to rejoin the University of Denver, or to join the Oilers, Anderson chose the latter. Making his professional debut with the Oilers, Anderson recorded 30 goals, 23 assists, and 53 points in 58 games in his first season. The Oilers made the playoffs that year and defeated the Montreal Canadiens in the preliminary round, three games to none. This was deemed a huge upset since the Canadiens had finished eleven spots higher than the Oilers in the overall standings. The Oilers moved on to the quarter-finals where they were defeated in six games by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, New York Islanders. During the playoff run, Anderson scored 12 points in 9 games, establishing himself as a \"fierce\" playoff performer. Anderson's sophomore season saw him record career highs in both assists and points with 67 and 105, respectively. His team jumped from fourth place to first place in the Smythe Division. In the playoffs, the Oilers were the victims of one of the biggest upsets in hockey history.\n\nThe following season, Anderson tallied 48 goals and 56 assists for a total of 104 points to help the Oilers remain atop their division. In the playoffs, the Oilers managed to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history. Anderson and his team were matched up against the Islanders who were looking for a fourth consecutive Stanley Cup victory. During the Finals, Anderson had several noted run-ins with Islanders goaltender Billy Smith. During game one, a slash on Anderson's knee earned Smith a two-minute slashing penalty.\nIn game four, when the two crashed into each other, Smith's dive resulted in referee Andy Van Hellemond handing a five-minute penalty to Anderson. The Oilers Were The Spoilers|date=May 28, 1984|first=Jack|last=Falla|journal=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref> The season ended in disappointment for the Oilers as they were defeated in four games in a best of seven series. Anderson's team would cite the loss as a valuable lesson in their quest for their first Stanley Cup.\n\nThe Oilers again repeated as division champions in 1983–84. Anderson set a career high in goals with 54 and he made his first All-Star Game appearance. In the playoffs, the Oilers made their second consecutive Finals appearance. Once again, Anderson and his team faced the Islanders who were now looking to become the second team in NHL history to win five consecutive Stanley Cups. This time though, the Oilers emerged victorious in five games. This marked the ending of the Islanders' dynasty and the beginning of the Oilers' dynasty. Anderson scored 17 points in the playoffs.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1984–85 season, Anderson signed an eight-year contract with the Oilers. Anderson recorded 42 goals and 81 points and once more his team were the division champions. Anderson was also selected to play in the All-Star Game. For the third straight season, the Oilers reached the Finals. The Oilers defeated their opponent, the Philadelphia Flyers, in five games. Anderson set a career high in assists with 16 during the playoff run. The 1985–86 season saw Anderson score 54 goals, 48 assists, adding up to 102 points. This was the second time Anderson had reached the 50 goal plateau in his career and the third time he had reached the 100 point plateau. He was also selected to play in his third consecutive All-Star Game. For the fifth consecutive season, the Oilers sat atop the Smythe Division. However, the Oilers were eliminated in the division finals by the Calgary Flames on an own goal by defenceman Steve Smith. The loss did not seem to faze Anderson and his team, as they won their third Cup the next season by beating the Flyers once again, but this time in seven games. Anderson set career highs in goals (14), points (27) and PIM (59) during the playoff run.\n\nThe Oilers failed to win the division title in 1987–88 for the first time since the 1981–82 season, as they finished runner-up to the Calgary Flames. Anderson scored 88 points during the season, and he was selected to play in the All-Star Game. In the midst of the 1988 playoffs, Anderson's friend, Dr. George Varvis, died after falling into Anderson's pool. His friend's death inspired his on-ice production. He scored 9 goals, and 16 assists for a total of 25 points to help the Oilers win their fourth Cup. His 16 assists tied a career high. After being eliminated from the playoffs, Anderson chose to play for Team Canada at the World Championships in Sweden. Anderson credits his time in Sweden for rejuvenating his love of the game. \nLooking to rebound after a disappointing season, Anderson and his team made a surprise appearance in the Finals. The Oilers defeated their opponents, the Boston Bruins, in five games to win their fifth Stanley Cup. Anderson scored 22 points and became one of only seven players to be a part of the entire Oilers dynasty. Wanting to rebuild the team with a younger core, the Oilers were involved in a blockbuster trade at the end of the 1991-92 season with the Toronto Maple Leafs that included seven players. Anderson, along with Grant Fuhr and Craig Berube, were sent to Toronto in exchange for Scott Thornton, Vincent Damphousse, Luke Richardson, Peter Ing and future considerations.\n\nDuring his time with the Oilers, Anderson scored 417 goals, 489 assists, and 906 points, ranking him third, fourth, and fourth most respectively in franchise history. His 183 playoff points are fourth all-time in franchise history and his 126 powerplay goals are the most in franchise history.\n\nAnderson spent two seasons and part of another with the Maple Leafs. He recorded consecutive 20-goal seasons, and he reached the career milestone of 1000 points with them. During the Maple Leafs playoff run in 1992–93, Anderson recorded 18 points in 21 games, including an overtime goal in Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals against the Kings, which gave the Leafs a 3-2 series lead but turned out to be their last win of the season.\n\nIn 1993–94, Anderson played 73 games with the Maple Leafs before being traded to the New York Rangers for Mike Gartner. In New York, Anderson was reunited with many of his former teammates from his days in Edmonton. The Rangers featured six former Oilers, including future Hall of Famer and Anderson's long-time friend and linemate Mark Messier. The Rangers qualified for the playoffs and were able to advance to the Finals. Matched up against the Vancouver Canucks, the Rangers defeated them in seven games. This was the Rangers' first Stanley Cup victory since 1940. After being held scoreless in the previous rounds, Anderson scored three playoff goals in the Finals, two of them being game-winners. This would be Anderson's sixth Stanley Cup victory.\n\nDue to the 1994–95 NHL lock-out, Anderson went to Europe to play hockey. He played with the Augsburger Panther of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in Germany and the Lukko Rauma of the SM-liiga in Finland, as well as the Canadian National Team. After the lock-out was resolved, Anderson signed as a free agent with the St. Louis Blues and played 42 regular season and playoff games combined. At the end of the season, Anderson did not re-sign with the Blues. After playing part of the next season with Augsburger and the National Team again, Anderson signed with the Canucks as a free agent. His reasons for joining the team were because of former Oiler teammate Esa Tikkanen already playing there, and a desire to finish his career in his hometown. However, Anderson never played for the Canucks as the Oilers picked him up on re-entry waivers. Anderson expressed his disappointment at these turn of events, as he wanted to play in Vancouver instead. He spent 17 games with the Oilers, before being put on waivers that same season. The Blues claimed him, and he spent his last days in the NHL with them. The 1996–97 season saw Anderson return to Europe and play with HC La Chaux-de-Fonds of the National League A in Switzerland and with Bolzano HC of the Alpenliga in Italy.\n\nAnderson was known to have a liking for participating in international competitions. His first test at the international stage was during the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. Canada finished sixth in the tournament while Anderson scored four points in six games. Later on, Anderson credited the practice he received in preparation for the Olympics as a key to his future success in the NHL.\n\nAnderson was chosen to participate in the 1984 Canada Cup. The roster included eight of Anderson's teammates from the Edmonton Oilers. Canada advanced to the finals and defeated Sweden 2–0 in a best of three series to win the Cup. Anderson scored five points during the tournament. The 1987 Canada Cup also saw Anderson participate. Once more, Canada reached the finals, but this time they were up against the Soviet Union. The finals required all three games as Canada defeated the Soviet Union. All three games needed overtime and had a final score of 6–5. Anderson recorded three points during the tournament.\n\nIn 1989, Anderson played at the Ice Hockey World Championships for the first time. With four points in six games, Anderson helped Canada win the silver medal, as the Soviets took home the gold. Three years later, Anderson made his second and final appearance at the World Ice Hockey Championships, this time in Czechoslovakia. Canada was eliminated by Finland in the quarterfinals by a score of 4–3. Anderson registered three points during the tournament.\n\nWanting to participate in the Olympics again, Anderson did what he could to play at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. He negotiated a clause with his team, the Toronto Maple Leafs, to grant him the right to play for Team Canada. This was not enough as Anderson also had to obtain permission from the league. The league had instituted a policy that only players with less than one year of National Hockey League experience could join and therefore turned down his request. The league's decision caused an outrage in Canada. Canada won silver as they lost the gold medal game to Sweden.\n\nAnderson was noted for his aggressive \"to the net\" playing style, typifying the NHL power forward in the early 1980s. He credits coach Clare Drake's drills during his time with the Olympic team for his love of driving the net. He also liked to stay behind the net and pass to his teammates in front of the goal for scoring chances. Noted as a \"money\" player, Anderson was able to elevate his game in high pressure situations. He scored five playoff overtime goals and 17 playoff game-winning goals, good for third and fifth all-time in NHL history. During the playoffs, Anderson accumulated 93 goals, 121 assists, and 214 points, the fourth, ninth, and fourth most in NHL history. In addition, his 72 regular season game-winning goals with the Oilers put him first all time in franchise history.\n\nAnderson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 10, 2008 in the players category. His jersey number 9 was retired on January 18, 2009, by the Oilers, before a game against the Phoenix Coyotes. The date for Anderson's number retirement was specifically selected because his former Oilers teammates, Wayne Gretzky and Grant Fuhr, were serving as the Coyotes' head coach and goaltending coach respectively at the time.\n\nAnderson's post-playing career was mired by a legal battle over child support. He was accused of reneging on child support payments to a woman with whom he had fathered a child out of wedlock. The case has since been settled. It was reported that the bad publicity from this case had kept Anderson out of the Hockey Hall of Fame for a long time.\n\nHe resides in Manhattan, New York with his wife Susan, and their daughter, Autumn Kristy. Anderson is an investor, teaches and runs fantasy camps, which give fans a chance to play hockey alongside him. On occasions, Anderson appears as a commentator and analyst for the New York Rangers.\n\nAnderson was a participant in season one of \"Battle of the Blades\". Anderson and his partner, Isabelle Brasseur, were the second pair to be eliminated from the competition. For their efforts, Brasseur's charity, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, and Anderson's charity, the Cross Cancer Institute, each received a $12,500 donation.\n\n1996 Spengler Cup in Davos, Switzerland\n\n\n"}

His father was an admiral in the Greek navy and the young Dertouzos often accompanied him aboard destroyers and submarines. This experience cultivated his interest in technology so that he learned Morse code, shipboard machinery, and mathematics at an early age. When he was 16, he came across Claude Shannon's work on information theory and MIT's attempt to build a mechanical mouse robot; these were said to have driven him to study in the university.\n\nDertouzos graduated at Athens College. He was able to come to the United States to study after the end of World War II and was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study electrical engineering. Dertouzos completed his bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Arkansas in 1957 and 1959, respectively.

He attended Shrewsbury School and then Jesus College, Cambridge. \nIn 1884 he went to Africa on a shooting trip, joining J. G. Haggard, the British consul at Lamu. On this trip he explored the coast of what is now Kenya, the Tana River and Mount Kilimanjaro. As well as shooting big game, he collected birds and butterflies. Soon after the 1886 treaty was signed to delimit the German and British spheres of influence in East Africa he joined the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC).\n\nIn 1889 Jackson led an IBEAC expedition that included his friend and fellow explorer Arthur Neumann in the party designed to open up the regions between Mombasa and Lake Victoria, which was largely unknown to Europeans at that time, and if possible to obtain news of Emin Pasha. At Kavirondo he received a letter from King Mwanga II of Buganda in Uganda describing a state of great confusion there owing to rivalry between different Christian factions. He went north, exploring the country beyond Mount Elgon. On his return to Kavirondo he found that the German Karl Peters had passed him and raised the German flag, which he pulled down. He went on to Uganda where he found the Baganda uncertain about whether to accept an IBEAC administration. The decision was made for them by the Heligoland treaty of 1900 in which Britain was given Uganda.\n\nThe British government took over the administration of British East Africa from IBEAC in 1894, and Jackson became an official. He was Lieutenant-Governor of the East African Protectorate (1907–1911) and Governor of Uganda (1911–1917).\n\nHe was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) for services during the mutiny of Sudanese troops in Uganda in 1898. For his administrative work he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list on 26 June 1902, and knighted as a Knight Commander (KCMG) of the same order in 1913. He retired in 1917.\n\nJackson joined the British Ornithologists' Union in 1888.\nThat year a paper by Jackson and Captain Shelley was published describing birds collected during his 1884–1886 trip to Africa. He collected many specimens in an 1898–1891 expedition to Uganda, and descriptions of this collection were published in a five-part paper in the \"Ibis\" in 1891–1892. Other papers described new species appeared in the \"Ibis\" and other journals between 1890 and 1917.\nJackson was elected President of the East Africa and Uganda Natural History Society in 1910.\nHe wrote nine of the nineteen chapters of \"Big Game Shooting\", published in 1894.\nAfter retiring, he worked on a complete history of the Birds of East Africa and Uganda, which was unpublished when he died in 1929, following pneumonia. \"The Birds of Kenya Colony and the Uganda Protectorate\" was completed by William Lutley Sclater and published in 1938.\n\nThree species of reptiles are named after Frederick John Jackson: Jackson's centipede eater (\"Aparallactus jacksonii\" ), Jackson's black tree snake (\"Thrasops jacksonii\" ), and Jackson's chameleon (\"Trioceros jacksonii\" ).\n\nJackson's mongoose (\"Bdeogale jacksoni\" ), and Jackson's pipit (\"Anthus latistriatus\") are named after him.\n\n"}

It forms stable hydrophobic complexes with some metals; these complexes are soluble in organic solvents as well as supercritical CO. The major uses of TBP in industry are as a component of aircraft hydraulic fluid, brake fluid, and as a solvent for extraction and purification of rare-earth metals from their ores.\n\nTBP finds its use as a solvent in inks, synthetic resins, gums, adhesives (namely for veneer plywood), and herbicide and fungicide concentrates.\n\nAs it has no odour, it is used as an anti-foaming agent in detergent solutions, and in various emulsions, paints, and adhesives. It is also found as a de-foamer in ethylene glycol-borax antifreeze solutions. In oil-based lubricants addition of TBP increases the oil film strength. It is used also in mercerizing liquids, where it improves their wetting properties. It can be used as a heat-exchange medium. TBP is used in some consumer products such as herbicides and water-thinned paints and tinting bases.\n\nA 15–40% (usually about 30%) solution of tributyl phosphate in kerosene or dodecane is used in the liquid–liquid extraction (solvent extraction) of uranium, plutonium, and thorium from spent uranium nuclear fuel rods dissolved in nitric acid, as part of a nuclear reprocessing process known as PUREX.\n\nThe shipment of 20 tons of tributyl phosphate to North Korea from China in 2002, coinciding with the resumption of activity at Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center, was seen by the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency as cause for concern; that amount was considered sufficient to extract enough material for perhaps three to five potential nuclear weapons.\n\nIn contact with concentrated nitric acid the TBP-kerosene solution forms hazardous and explosive red oil.\n"}

During various periods of his life, he ruled Pinsk and Polatsk. In 1333 he was invited by Novgorod's nobles to rule and protect territories in the north, Ladoga, Oreshek and Korela. He started the tradition of Lithuanian mercenary service north of Novgorod on the Swedish border that lasted until Novgorod's fall to Moscow in 1477.\n\nAbout 1338, the Golden Horde took him as prisoner. The Muscovite ruler, Ivan Kalita, ransomed him from Tatars, keeping him as hostage in Moscow for a few years.\n\nNarimantas supported his brother Jaunutis when he was deposed by Algirdas and Kęstutis in 1345. In order to avoid getting killed by his younger brothers, he escaped Vilnius in autumn 1344. Narimantas travelled to Jani Beg, Khan of the Golden Horde, asking for support against Algirdas. Though he failed to solicit support, he is rumoured to have married a Tatar princess. (possibly as second wife.) After returning, Narimantas reconciled with Algirdas and was killed leading the Battle of Strėva against the Teutonic Knights on 2 February 1348. His descendants include Princes Kurakin, Galitzine, Khovansky, Korecki.\n\nHe took baptism in 1333 in or before Veliki Novgorod.

{"id": "1859120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859120", "title": "Duke of Aveiro", "text": "Duke of Aveiro\n\nThe Dukedom of Aveiro () was an aristocratic Portuguese title, granted in 1535 by King John III of Portugal to his 4th cousin, John of Lencastre, son of Infante George of Lencastre, a natural son of King John II of Portugal.\n\nJohn of Lencastre was already Marquis of Torres Novas when the King granted him the new title of Duke of Aveiro. Later, their descendants strongly supported Philip II of Spain during the 1580 Portuguese succession crisis. Thus the Dukes became the second aristocratic House of Portugal, after the Braganzas.\n\nRaimundo of Lencastre, 4th Duke of Aveiro maintained his House's traditional support for the Habsburg monarchy, even after the 1640 national revolution in Portugal. Therefore the Aveiro property was confiscated by the new Kings of the Braganza Dynasty, and granted in 1668 to his uncle, Peter of Lencastre, who already was Archbishop of Évora and general Inquisitor, becoming 5th Duke of Aveiro. He died in 1673 without issue.\n\nThe succession was given to his niece, Maria de Guadalupe of Lencastre, who was married to the Spanish Duke of Los Arcos. She returned to Portugal with her younger son, while her husband and her older son stayed in Spain. She regained the control of her House and estates and recognised the Braganzas royalty.\n\nDue to the participation of the 8th Duke of Aveiro in the Távora affair (a conspiracy against the King), all the possessions of the Dukes of Aveiro were confiscated, their coat-of-arms destroyed from the public places, their houses demolished and their lands salted. Only the Palace of the Dukes of Aveiro in Azeitão, Portugal remains (albeit with the destroyed coat of arms on its facade) as a testament to the family's previous might and power.\nThe Aveiro palace in Lisbon, demolished and salted, gave place to a stone memorial in order to perpetuate the memory of the shame of the Aveiro House. In it the following text can be read (in Portuguese): \"Aqui foram arrasadas e salgadas as casas de José Mascarenhas, exautorado das honras de Duque de Aveiro e outras condemnado por sentença proferida na Suprema Juncta de Inconfidencia em 12 de Janeiro de 1759. Justiçado como um dos chefes do barbaro e execrando desacato que na noite de 3 de Septembro de 1758 se havia commetido contra a real e sagrada pessoa de D.José I. Neste terreno infame se não poderá edificar em tempo algum.\" (\"In this place were put to the ground and salted the houses of José Mascarenhas, stripped of the honours of Duque de Aveiro and others, convicted by sentence proclaimed in the Supreme Court of Inconfidences on the 12th of January 1759. Put to Justice as one of the leaders of the most barbarous and execrable upheaval that, on the night of the 3rd of September 1758, was committed against the most royal and sacred person of the Lord Joseph I. In this infamous land nothing may be built for all time.\")\n\nAfter 1759 the title was extinct. However, in 1939, Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza, authorized the use of the personal title of Duke of Aveiro to Caetano Henriques Pereira Faria Saldanha de Lancastre, Count of Alcáçovas, who did not use the prerogative. The only legitimate relatives of José de Mascarenhas da Silva e Lencastre, 8th Duke of Aveiro, are descended from his sister Francisca das Chagas Mascarenhas and her husband the 1st Marquis of Lavradio.\n\n\n\nWhen Peter of Lencastre, 5th Duke of Aveiro died in 1673, his niece Maria de Guadalupe of Lencastre was finally recognised by the Portuguese King as Duchess of Aveiro in 1679, on condition that she return to Portugal although she was married to the Spanish Duke of Los Arcos. Her husband opposed this; she divorced him, returned to her homeland and regained the House of Aveiro and their estates.\n\nWhile the divorce was pending, King Carlos II of Spain tried to prevent her return to Portugal by granting her, in 1681, the Spanish title of Duchess of Aveyro (Spanish spelling). This title belongs today to the Spanish \"Carvajal\" family, with no relationship to the Lancastre family of Portugal. It is not a Portuguese title and is entirely separate from its Portuguese homonym.\n\nThe family name associated with the Dukes of Aveiro is \"Lancastre\", referring to King John I's wife Philippa of Lancaster, daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster and head of the House of Lancaster. The Marquess of Lavradio is currently the Chief of Name and Arms of the Lancastre family in Portugal.\n\n\n\n\"Nobreza de Portugal e do Brasil\" – Vol. II, pages 342/347.

It was first envisioned as a three-division force in 1979 as the Rapid Deployment Force, or RDF, a highly mobile force that could be rapidly moved to locations outside the normal overseas deployments in Europe and Korea. Its charter was expanded and greatly strengthened in 1980 as the RDJTF.\nIt was inactivated in 1983, and re-organized as the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM).\n\nAfter the end of the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War, U.S. attention gradually focused on the Persian Gulf region. The Yom Kippur War of 1973, the Soviet-U.S. confrontation and the subsequent 1973/1974 oil crisis led to President Richard Nixon issuing a U.S. warning, \"...that American military intervention to protect vital oil supplies\" was a possibility, served to increase attention on the area as being vital to U.S. national interests.\n\nWith the new administration elected in 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed Presidential Review Memorandum (PRM) 10, which undertook an evaluation of US strategy. The President signed Presidential Directive (PD) 18 on August 24, 1977, a part of which called for the establishment of a mobile force capable of responding to worldwide contingencies that would not divert forces from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or Korea. In 1978, three Army divisions (the 9th, 82nd, and 101st) and one Marine division were earmarked for such duties. There were however no substantial funds allocated and it remained a paper exercise.\n\nThere were several reasons why the move to a Rapid Deployment Force did not occur in the 1970s. Unlike previous Cold War administrations, the US foreign and defense policies under President Carter saw retrenchment, not intervention in foreign affairs. Also, the Carter Administration had NATO as its focus with conventional force policy as a result of the buildup of Warsaw Pact forces. Domestically, there were many objections from the Congress and the media with regards to the use of United States military forces in the wake of the Vietnam War and in addition within the Defense Department, the Armed Services were just not enthusiastic about the establishment of another limited contingency organization.\n\nA concerted effort to establish the envisioned force was not made until world events in 1979 ended the post-Vietnam malaise in the United States after the Fall of Saigon. The 1979 SALT II agreement with the Soviet Union led to a vigorous debate (and subsequent rejection by Congress of the treaty) which illustrated how far the United States military had fallen into disrepair during the 1970s. The 1979 Iranian Revolution; the 1979 energy crisis; the April 1980 failure of Operation Eagle Claw to rescue United States diplomatic personnel from Tehran, and the 1979 acknowledgment of a Soviet Army combat brigade in Cuba reinforced the appearance of weakness.\n\nHowever, even before the 4 November 1979 seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran by a group of Islamist students and militants in support of the Iranian Revolution, President Carter announced the establishment of the Rapid Deployment Force, or RDF. The RDF concept was to develop a mobile strike force of Army, United States Navy, Marine and Air Force elements that could independently operate without the use of established forward bases or the facilities of friendly nations globally. The orientation of the RDF, however, was on the Middle East.\n\nThis statement was followed-up in Carter's 1980 State of the Union address when he announced that any attempt by a foreign power to gain control of the Persian Gulf and surrounding area would be regarded as an attack on the vital interests of the United States, and be stopped by all means necessary including the use of military force. This was the first formal commitment of US military power to the region.\nThe Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force (RDJTF), as the organization was officially designated, was activated on 1 March 1980 at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. The RDJTF was established as a part of U.S. Readiness Command (REDCOM) and initially commanded by Lieutenant General Paul X. Kelley, USMC. The mission of the RDJTF was that of deterrence—against possible Soviet or proxy invasion, conflict among the states of the area and subversion and insurrection within the states and thus \"help maintain regional stability and the Gulf oil-flow westward\".\n\nThe RDJTF was planned from the beginning to be highly mobile, its components to be drawn from central pool of resources allocated by the combined services as required to meet mission objectives and the nature of the specific threat to US interests.\n\nInitially conceived as a force with a global orientation, the RDF soon focused its attention and planning to the Persian Gulf region. This narrowing of emphasis was precipitated by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan on 26 December 1979 and the subsequent announcement of the Carter Doctrine which stated that because of its oil fields, the Persian Gulf area was of vital interest to the United States, and that any outside attempt to gain control in the area would be \"repelled by use of any means necessary, including military force.\"\n\nThus, the 1980 RDJTF area of responsibility included Egypt, Sudan, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, the People's Republic of Yemen, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and the Yemen Arab Republic.\n\nThe Commander of RDJTF was a three star position, first held by General P.X. Kelley and then by General Robert Kingston, USA (the commander alternated between the Army and Marine Corps). The Deputy Commander was usually an Air Force two star general officer.\n\nIts command staff was drawn from all four armed services. Component commanders of RDJTF consisted of:\n\n\nA Washington Liaison Office also existed.\n\nIn the event a conflict had occurred these personnel would have controlled deployment and operations and been augmented by around 200 personnel from REDCOM and another 250 if they were to go to a remote area. The headquarters at MacDill AFB in Tampa created some tension between the commands. This command relationship proved unsatisfactory, because in 1980, before the 1986 Goldwater–Nichols Act, there was significant separation within the chain of command of the separate Armed Services and no single channel of communication through which the RDF commander could communicate directly to the United States Secretary of Defense on matters specifically relating to the RDF.\n\nDesignated Army elements of the force were: \n\n\n\n\nDesignated USMC elements of the force were: \n\nDesignated United States Navy elements of the force were: \n\nThe Navy also operated Military Sealift Command (MSC) which would have been tasked in providing the RDJTF with long term sustainability. The heavier items of equipment would also have to be transported by sea such as the 100,000 tons of equipment for the 24th Mechanized Division (which would take five weeks by air using every transport available). While bulky items and sheer tonnage are the advantages of sealift, its main disadvantage was speed—as it would take longer to deploy, and be more vulnerable to enemy action.\n\nDesignated United States Air Force elements of the force were from Tactical Air Command (TAC): \n\nAdditional secondary units consisted of squadrons deployed from the following USAFE-committed TAC wings: \n\nThe Air Force also controlled the Military Airlift Command (MAC), which put the \"Rapid\" into the RDJTF. The RDJTF relied upon the C-5 Galaxy (70 aircraft), C-141 Starlifter (234 aircraft), and C-130 Hercules (490) of MAC to deploy the fastest reacting ground forces, the forward elements of the 82d Airborne, Special Forces and USMC personnel of the 7th MAB.\n\nThe RDJTF could also call upon the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) of 111 long-range cargo and 231 long-range passenger aircraft.\n\nIndividuals assigned for Rapid Deployment assigned to the Air Force Communications Command consisted of Air Traffic Controllers staged for deployment around the world to handle the increased level of Air Traffic.\n\nOn 24 April 1981, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger announced that the RDJTF would evolve into a separate command with specific geographic responsibilities. The planned change was favorably received in the Congress, though not unanimously. Both the Senate Committee on Armed Services and the Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed their concern \"about the absence of an organized effort to plan and provide for possible power projection requirements in other Third World areas which are also critical to U.S. interests.\" The decision to focus the attention of the RDJTF solely on the Middle East and Central Asia—to the exclusion of other areas, such as central and southern Africa—did little to ease this concern.\n\nOn 1 January 1983 the RDJTF became a separate Unified Combatant Command known as the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM). The USCENTCOM commander enjoys the same stature as other theater commanders, and he reports directly to the Secretary of Defense. His operational planning responsibility is limited to the Middle East and Central Asia only.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1859140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859140", "title": "Fainting goat", "text": "Fainting goat\n\nThe Myotonic or Tennessee Fainting is an American breed of meat goat. It is characterised by myotonia congenita, a hereditary condition which may cause it to stiffen or fall over when startled. It may also be known as the Fainting, Falling , Stiff-legged or Nervous goat, or as the Tennessee Wooden Leg. Four goats of this type were brought to Tennessee in the 1880s. \n\nMyotonic goats tend to be less preferred for sustainable meat production.\n\nThe myotonic goat is important in history for researching and clarifying the role of chloride in muscle excitation.\n\nFainting goats were first brought to Marshall County, Tennessee, in the 1880s.\n\nThe fainting was first described in scientific literature in 1904, and described as a \"congenital myotonia\" in 1939. The mutation in the goat gene that causes this muscle stiffness was discovered in 1996, several years after the equivalent gene had been discovered in humans and mice.\n\nThe experiments of Brown and Harvey in 1939 with the myotonic goat made a major contribution to the understanding of the physiological basis of this condition and influenced many other theories of myotonia and its causes.\n\nIn 2019 its conservation status was listed as \"at risk\" in the DAD-IS database of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nMyotonic goats vary heavily in their characteristics in comparison to other goat breeds, and they possess certain traits that other goat breeds do not. Distinctly, their head and body formation tends to be different. Myotonic goats have a wide body, and a heavier mass. The muscle condition of the myotonic goats usually leads to an increased muscle mass with a broader build. Slightly smaller than standard breeds of the goat, fainting goats are generally to tall and can weigh anywhere from to . Males, or billies, as they are often referred to, can be as heavy as . Broadness is shown throughout the back and shoulders, due to muscle density.\n\nThey have large, prominent eyes in high sockets that tend to protrude, and are fairly distinct features. They are sometimes called \"bug-eyed\" for this feature. The heads tend to be medium length with a broad muzzle. Jaws tend to be broad as well, and distinct. The face is usually straight or convex. The ears tend to be normal-sized, and closer to the face. The ears also exhibit a ripple half-way down the length of the ear. The horns tend to run large and have 1-2 inches between. The neck tends to be muscle dense and more round than dairy breads. The skin on many male's necks is wrinkled and thick. The neck can also run horizontally and therefore, the head can be lower.\n\nMyotonic goats are vigilant animals that are quieter than other goat breeds. Other important differential characteristics of the myotonic goat include very teachable/trainable, stiffness, high quality adaptation to low-input farm land and foraging, and cross-breeding creating hybrids leading to physical strength and good health.\n\nTheir hair can be short or long, with certain individuals producing a great deal of cashmere during colder months. Coats can demonstrate any color or pattern.\n\nMyotonia congenita is caused by an inherited disorder of a chloride channel in the muscles of the skeleton (skeletal muscle chloride channel 1, CLCN1). Congenital myotonia can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (with incomplete penetrance) or a recessive trait, resulting in the varying severity of the condition. In affected goats, the CLCN1 gene contains a missense mutation; the amino acid alanine is replaced with a proline residue. This small change causes the chloride channel in the muscle fibres to have a reduced conductance of chloride ions. This missense mutation occurs in a sequence of seven amino acids that are included in a group of closely related channels including that of humans and rats. This causes a delay in the relaxation of the muscles after the goat has made an involuntary movement. After stimulation, in myotonia congenita there is an increased tendency of the muscle fibers to respond with repetitive action potentials and after discharges. It has been shown that the increased muscle excitability is largely accounted for by the lack of chloride permeability in these fibers. Myotonia congenita is also characterized by a significant increase in the fast isomyosins in each muscle type. The muscle fibers of the myotonic goat were found to be highly (electrically) resistive, corresponding to the blocking of chloride conductance. In a study, normal goat muscle fibers could be made myotonic by blocking the chloride conductance using myotonia inducing drugs, or by substituting in an anion that is unable to pass through a semi-permeable membrane.\n\nIsolated intercostal muscle from goats with the condition was shown to be significantly different than that of normal goats in terms of the temperature dependence of the resting membrane resistance and potassium efflux. These differences help to explain increases in the severity of myotonia in the whole animal that occurs upon decreasing the temperature of the involved muscles.\n\nIt has been observed that there are no abnormalities in percussion responses or stiffness during the first 14 days of a newborn goat’s life. The first percussion responses were observed during days 18-143, and the stiffening and/or falling begins to occur during days 20-173.\n\nAlthough there is no known treatment for myotonia congenita, in a study testing the effect of hydration on myotonia in goats, it was found that upon depriving goats of water, the myotonic symptoms disappeared within 3 days and returned fully within 2–3 days of water being provided. Previous studies have also reported that taurine, an amino sulphonic acid, when given to myotonic patients can reduce the symptoms of the condition. However, it has been shown that it neither antagonizes the condition, nor prevents it.\n\nIn order to study myotonia in goats, researchers relied on the isolation of RNA protein. Samples of skeletal muscles and tissue were collected from a normal goat as a control group, and a myotonic goat. The diseased goat in the study showed severe myotonia, demonstrating muscle relaxation issues and severe fainting episodes. They then used a Northern Blot Analysis in which the total RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and physically explored with antisense RNA probe transcribed from a human. What followed was isolation and cloning of the goat in which cDNA was formulated from myotonic goat skeletal muscle. cDNA synthesis was conducted with a random or gene-specific primer. Products were identified, sub-cloned into plasmids, and sequenced. Next followed the Single-Strand Conformational Analysis, where synthesis was provoked from normal or myotonic goat skeletal muscle. Then they performed mutagenesis and functional expression, where plasmid constructs were transcribed and expressed. The voltages were assessed between -145 mV and +35 mV. Using the Northern Blot Analysis, they verified that the fainting episodes are caused by decreased chloride production in the muscle cell membrane.\n\nThe myotonic goat is very similar to the condition in humans which is known as congenital myotonia. They are similar in the way that both the human and the goat are not typically consumed by the condition and can more or less lead perfectly normal lives. Similar to goats, in humans the condition is described as a chloride channel disorder known for delayed muscle relaxation, and also caused by mutations in the skeletal muscle chloride channel gene. Also, like the goats, it can range from mild to severe. In an experiment with humans using muscle biopsy, after Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining with diastase digestion, there was PAS positive material within myotonic goat fibers.\n\nFrom the study above, it was found that a change in the nucleotide sequence caused a proline substitution for alanine residue in the carboxyl terminus of the goat's chloride channel. A goat demonstrating the disease had a +47 mV shift in the channel activation, which created less open chloride channels located near the rested membrane of the skeletal muscles, which demonstrates a molecular basis- decreased chloride production in the myotonic muscles.\n\nMost all myotonic goats seem to come from an origin in Tennessee, in the 1880s. White and Plaskett reported seeing these goats in five counties in Tennessee- Marshall, Giles, Lawrence, Maury, and Coffee. There were also goats in Texas that were brought over from Giles county in Tennessee, solely for a farmer who claimed to know of the goats existence to prove it as fact to his neighbors. The goats were unable to jump over normal sized fences, and found holes in the ground to crawl underneath the fences, similar to a hog. This unusual behavior made the goats more desirable in this era, as many farmers used stone walls for fences, therefore containing their goats. In Marshall country, there was also a buck goat brought over from Canada. The A. & M. College in Texas owned a zoo during 1926-1927 in which a myotonic goat was presented. Dr. White (in a letter to the author) stated that in the summer of 1929 in Egypt, he witnessed several fainting goats between the Suez Canal and the Palestine border. He also stated that he shipped some of the goats from Tennessee to a professor by the name of Nagel, at the Nervous Disease Institute in Germany for studies.\n\nThe myotonic goat is important in history for researching and clarifying the role of chloride in muscle excitation.\n\nThe fainting was first described in scientific literature in 1904, and described as a \"congenital myotonia\" in 1939. The mutation in the goat gene that causes this muscle stiffness was discovered in 1996, several years after the equivalent gene had been discovered in humans and mice. However, the tendency of goats to spasm has been attested to as early as the Hippocratic Corpus, where analogies are drawn from the phenomenon to human illness. \n\nThe experiments of Brown and Harvey in 1939 with the myotonic goat made a major contribution to the understanding of the physiological basis of this condition and influenced many other theories of myotonia and its causes.\n\nJohne's disease is a serious disease which is more prevalent in myotonic goats than other breeds. Johne's disease is a bacterial disease that causes parts of the body to progressively become weaker. It tends to occur in middle-aged goats. Causes for this disease tend to be rotting teeth, Caseous Lymphadenitis, and tumors. The disease is typically spread from a mother to her offspring, with the most likely time being right after birth. The infection is typically widepread in the udder, which is how the offspring get exposure to the disease. The bacteria are found in parasite larvae, which can greatly increase spreading of the disease. Myotonic goats are also susceptible to the disease through foraging in soil, as the bacteria can last in soil from one up to two years. The best way to contain and prevent this disease is to quickly diagnose the problem to take the proper measures.\n\nDiagnosis is best done by the AGID test or the ELISA test, which tests the goats positive or negative for the disease. The AGID test tends to be more specific, and nearly all goats that are positive for the disease tend to come up as positive. Fecal culturing is another option, but takes longer and the cost tends to be high.\n\nMeat production from goats uses maternal breeds that demonstrate high levels of fitness under non-optimal situations. The Myotonic goat lacks abilities for proper assessment of female fitness. However, 80 Myotonic goats were studied in an experiment, and were compared to traits regarding health and reproduction in Spanish goats, Kiko goats, and Boer goats. The study measured Fecal Egg Count (FEC) and Packed Cell Volume (PCV). Myotonic goats tended to have a lower body mass and a lower FEC, but a greater PCV than Boer goats. Weaning rates, annual kidding rates, doe retention rates and kid crop weaned were relatively the same in all goats except the Myotonic goat. Myotonic goats had the lowest FEC in comparison to the other breeds. These results provoke the idea that Myotonic goats are less preferred for sustainable meat production under non-optimal conditions.\n\nThe MGR (Myotonic Goat Registry) believes maintaining the breed is of great significance, and that the breed is much more than just muscular stiffness. Important factors the MGR states to maintain the breed include quiet behavior, parasite resistance, and good mothering ability. Therefore, to protect the Myotonic goat species, the MGR registers all crossbreeds. This allows for identification of purebred species by making sure that breeds are not misidentified. Registering the goats allows for reduction in labeling offspring as purebreds if they are not. It has been controversial over the years, as some breeders think crossbreeding should not occur. The main reasons known for continuing to breed these goats have been for the observation of their fainting behavior as well as their ability to be kept in minimally fenced farms due to their lack of desire to jump over anything over 0.5m, as it is an issue for most farmers that most goat breeds tend to jump over the fences enclosing them.\n"}

PUREX is the \"de facto\" standard aqueous nuclear reprocessing method for the recovery of uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel (spent nuclear fuel, or irradiated nuclear fuel). It is based on liquid–liquid extraction ion-exchange.\n\nPUREX is applied to spent nuclear fuel, which consists primarily of very high atomic-weight (actinoid or \"actinide\") elements (e.g. uranium, plutonium, americium) along with smaller amounts of material composed of lighter atoms, notably the so-called fission products.\n\nThe actinoid elements in this case consist primarily of the unconsumed remains of the original fuel (typically U-235, U-238, and/or Pu-239).\n\nThe fuel is first dissolved in nitric acid at a concentration of ca. 7 M. Solids are removed by filtration lest they form emulsions, referred to as third phases in the solvent extraction community.\n\nThe organic solvent consists of 30% tributyl phosphate (TBP) in a hydrocarbon, such as kerosene. Uranium ions are extracted as UO(NO)·2TBP complexes, and plutonium as similar complexes. Other fission products remain in the aqueous phase, including americium and curium. The nature of the organic soluble uranium complex has been the subject of some research. The nature of uranyl nitrate complexes with trialkyl phosphates have been characterized.\n\nPlutonium is separated from uranium by treating the kerosene solution with reducing agents to convert the plutonium to the +3 oxidation state. Typical reducing agents include N,N-diethyl-hydroxylamine, ferrous sulphamate, and hydrazine. The plutonium 3+ passes into the aqueous phase. The uranium is stripped from the kerosene solution by back-extraction into nitric acid at a concentration of ca. 0.2 M.\n\nThe term \"PUREX raffinate\" describes the mixture of metals in nitric acid which are left behind when the uranium and plutonium have been removed by the PUREX process from a nuclear fuel dissolution liquor. This mixture is often known as high level nuclear waste.\n\nTwo PUREX raffinates exist. The most highly active raffinate from the first cycle is the one which is most commonly known as PUREX raffinate. The other is from the medium-active cycle in which the uranium and plutonium are refined by a second extraction with tributyl phosphate.\n\nDeep blue is the bulk ions, light blue is the fission products (group I is Rb/Cs) (group II is Sr/Ba) (group III is Y and the lanthanides), orange is the corrosion products (from stainless steel pipework), green are the major actinides, violet are the minor actinides and magenta is the neutron poison)\n\nCurrently PUREX raffinate is stored in stainless steel tanks before being converted into glass. The first cycle PUREX raffinate is very radioactive. It has almost all of the fission products, corrosion products such as iron/nickel, traces of uranium, plutonium and the minor actinides.\n\nThe PUREX Plant at the Hanford Site was responsible for producing 'copious volumes of liquid wastes', resulting in the radioactive contamination of groundwater.\n\nGreenpeace measurements in La Hague and Sellafield indicated that radioactive pollutants are steadily released into the sea, and the air. Therefore, people living near these processing plants are exposed to higher radiation levels than the naturally occurring background radiation. This additional radiation is small but not negligible according to Greenpeace.\n\nThe PUREX process was invented by Herbert H. Anderson and Larned B. Asprey at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, as part of the Manhattan Project under Glenn T. Seaborg; their patent \"Solvent Extraction Process for Plutonium\" filed in 1947, mentions tributyl phosphate as the major reactant which accomplishes the bulk of the chemical extraction.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is believed to have been written around the second century CE, and then buried and lost until it was rediscovered amongst 52 other Gnostic Christian texts spread over 13 codices by an Arab peasant, Mohammad Ali al-Samman, in the Egyptian town of Nag Hammadi late in December 1945.\n\nThe gnostic text contains many Jewish-Christian themes, making many scholars think it to be one of the earlier texts, originally from the early or mid-second century. One of the most curious features of the second apocalypse of James is that this range of dating, of its original text, assigned to it by scholars, requires that it was written before the \"First Apocalypse of James\".\n\nA number of differences are seen from the more canonical history that the text describes. For example, it names James' father Theudas rather than Joseph, who is presented as the biological father of James by the mid-second-century Protevangelium of James. Notably, the names Theudas and Alpheus (father of James the Less) have similar meanings. The name 'Theudas' means \"flowing with water\", and the Greek name 'Alpheus' means \"changing\" or \"god of the rivers\".\n\nThe wife of this Theudas is named Mary; whether or not this Mary is the same woman as the mother of Jesus, and whether this Mary is supposed to be the biological mother of James, is never explicitly stated in the text. \n\nThe First Apocalypse of James explicitly claims that James and Jesus are not biological brothers. In contrast, the Second Apocalypse of James (which was likely written prior to the \"First\" Apocalypse of James) states that Jesus and James share the same mother, presumably being Mary.\nIt then explains that they have different biological fathers.\n\nThe text features a kiss between James and Jesus, on the lips, in a similar manner to the way in which Jesus is said to have kissed Mary Magdalene in the apocryphal Gospel of Phillip.\nHowever, the text also describes how such a kiss was a metaphor for the passing of gnosis, explaining the references to it elsewhere, making it clear that this is not the homosexual relationship it might appear to be. \n\nJames Tabor cites Jesus referring to James as \"my beloved\" (twice) in this passage as evidence for James being the Beloved Disciple.\n\nThe text ends with the rather gruesome death of James by stoning, possibly reflecting an early oral tradition of what became of James:\n\n"}

Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (2001) was a landmark intellectual property case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the ruling of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, holding that defendant, peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing service Napster, could be held liable for contributory infringement and vicarious infringement of the plaintiffs' copyrights. This was the first major case to address the application of copyright laws to peer-to-peer file-sharing.\n\nSince the case is referred to as A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, the full list of plaintiffs included a number of record companies, all members of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The plaintiffs in the District Court suit were:\n\n\nUniversal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, EMI, and Warner Music Group are known as the \"big four\" in the music industry. Of this list, only A&M, Geffen, Interscope, Sony, MCA, Atlantic, Island, and Motown are listed as plaintiffs on the appeal. Additionally, American songwriters and producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller are included on the Circuit Court appeal, representing the interests of \"all others similarly situated.\"\n\nNapster was started in 1999 by Shawn Fanning, then an 18-year-old freshman computer science student at Northeastern University. It provided a platform for users to access and download compressed digital music files, specifically MP3s, from other users' machines. Unlike many peer-to-peer services, however, Napster included a central server that indexed connected users and files available on their machines, creating a searchable list of music available across Napster's network. Napster's ease of use compared to other peer-to-peer services quickly made it a popular service for music enthusiasts to find and download digital song files for free.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged both contributory and vicarious copyright infringement by Napster, and soon filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in order to stop the exchange of plaintiffs' songs on the service immediately.\n\nJudge Marilyn Hall Patel of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted the preliminary injunction, on the grounds that the plaintiffs demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success. She issued an injunction which preliminarily enjoined Napster\nNapster appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nOn appeal, the Ninth Circuit ordered a stay of the District Court's injunction, pending resolution. The Ninth Circuit issued its opinion on February 12, 2001, affirming in part and reversing in part the District Court's decision.\n\nThe Circuit Court agreed with the district court's threshold determination that Napster users were probably engaging in direct infringement of plaintiffs' copyrights.\n\nTurning to the question of fair use, the Circuit court agreed with the district court's \"general analysis of Napster system uses\" as well as with its analysis of the three \"alleged fair uses identified by Napster\" – which were \"sampling, where users make temporary copies of a work before purchasing; space-shifting, where users access a sound recording through the Napster system that they already own in audio CD format; and permissive distribution of recordings by both new and established artists.\"\n\nThe court first considered these four factors on an abstract level of the system itself.\n\nThe court then turned to the three uses Napster identified as fair use in the conduct of its users:\nBy contrast, the court found that the owners of Napster could control the infringing behavior of users, and therefore had a duty to do so. The Ninth Circuit affirmed this analysis, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in proving that Napster did not have a valid fair use defense.\n\nIn order to prove contributory infringement, a plaintiff must show that a defendant had knowledge of infringement (here, that Napster knew that its users were distributing copyrighted content without permission across its network) and that defendant supplied material support to that infringement.\n\nKnowledge. The District Court ruled that the \"law does not require knowledge of 'specific acts of infringement'\" and rejected Napster's assertion that, because they could not distinguish between infringing and non-infringing files, they did not have knowledge of copyright infringement. The Ninth Circuit upheld this analysis, accepting that Napster had \"knowledge, both actual and constructive, of direct infringement.\"\n\nThe Ninth Circuit also held that Napster was not protected under \"Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.\", \"the Betamax case\", because of Napster's \"actual, specific knowledge of direct infringement.\" \"We are compelled to make a clear distinction between the architecture of the Napster system and Napster's conduct in relation to the operational capacity of the system.\"\n\nMaterial contribution. The Ninth Circuit briefly approved the district court's analysis of this element.\n\nThus, the court affirmed the District Court ruling that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on a claim of contributory infringement.\n\nAddressing the vicarious infringement claim, the court then considered the necessary factors: whether Napster benefited financially from the infringement and whether they were capable of supervising and controlling infringing conduct. The Ninth Circuit sided with the District Court, who held that the infringing activity was a draw to potential users and that, since Napster's future business model was predicated on expanding the number of users, Napster stood to benefit financially from the infringing activity. As for supervision, the Circuit court agreed in part with the District Court's finding that Napster had \"the right and ability to supervise its users' conduct.\" However, the Ninth Circuit felt that Napster's ability to patrol and enforce infringing use was limited by the design of the system itself. The system was not designed to read the contents of MP3s or check for copyright ownership or permissions, only to index by name and ensure they are valid MP3 files. Despite this departure from the District Court's reasoning, they argued that these indices and infringing files were just as searchable by Napster as they were by the plaintiffs in locating infringing files for evidence in the case. Because of Napster's failure to police within its means combined with the financial interest factor, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's finding of vicarious infringement.\n\nIn its defense against the injunction, Napster also cited the Audio Home Recording Act (17 U.S.C. §§ 1001-10). and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's safe harbor clause (17 U.S.C. § 512). The Ninth Circuit agreed with the District Court's finding that downloading MP3 files is not covered by the Audio Home Recording Act. The Ninth Circuit disagreed slightly with the District Court on the safe harbor issue, however, finding that the contributory infringement does not necessarily exclude a party from safe harbor protection. The court held that the safe harbor issue would be explored further at trial.\n\nNapster also argued that the record companies waived their rights to copyright protection because they \"hastened\" the spread of MP3s on the web and had their own plans to get into the digital market. Rejecting this argument, Judge Patel wrote, \"This limited evidence fails to convince the court that the record companies created the monster that is now devouring their intellectual property rights.\" The Ninth Circuit agreed, and also rejected Napster's claim that, by creating and providing digital files via the Internet, the plaintiffs had granted Napster an \"implied license\". Finally, Napster argued that the plaintiffs were using copyright to control online distribution, which Napster considered beyond the scope of the limited monopoly provided by the Copyright Office. The court rejected this as well, finding that MP3s were the same works as those that appeared on CDs, just in a different format, thus the plaintiffs had every right to control their distribution of digital music files because they are the plaintiffs' copyrighted works.\n\nNapster contended that the injunction violated the company's First Amendment rights because it was overbroad. While the Ninth Circuit rejected this argument due to the lack of a fair use defense, they did order a stay of the injunction and agreed that the injunction was overbroad because \"it places on Napster the entire burden of ensuring that no 'copying, downloading, uploading, transmitting, or distributing' of plaintiffs' works occur on the system.\" Recognizing that Napster's system simply indexed files with imperfect file names and did not automatically verify copyright ownership, the court found that it was the plaintiffs' burden to notify Napster of any infringing files on the system, which Napster would then remove. But the court also again noted that Napster must police the system within its means: \"In crafting the injunction on remand, the district court should recognize that Napster's system does not currently appear to allow Napster access to users' MP3 files.\" The court also declined to adjust the bond amount and called imposition of a compulsory royalty scheme an \"'easy out' for Napster\" that would destroy the plaintiffs' ability to control their intellectual property.\n\nAmong a number of amicus briefs filed on behalf of both sides of the dispute, one particularly critical brief filed by a consortium of eighteen copyright law professors at United States universities argued that the District Court misread \"Sony\" and took too narrow a view of fair use. They wrote:\nThe professors further argued that the overbroad nature of the injunction threatened the development and deployment of any future peer-to-peer file-sharing network on the Internet because it insisted on a restructuring that defeated peer-to-peer technology itself. They also argued that the finding of contributory liability was erroneous because of Napster's significant non-infringing uses and because not all unauthorized uses within the system were infringement. They concluded, \"If Plaintiffs want copyright law extended to allow the suppression of new technologies, they must make their case to Congress.\"\n\nNapster struggled to comply with the demands of the rewritten injunction, and in April 2001 Judge Patel called their policing efforts \"disgraceful.\" The company turned to digital fingerprinting to try to identify infringing files. However, at a hearing on July 11, 2001, Judge Patel's dissatisfaction with Napster's 99.4% efficacy in removing infringing material prompted her to order the service shut down until it could be 100% effective. In September 2001, Napster settled with songwriters and music publishers, agreeing to pay $26 million. Napster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2002, and when a judge blocked its sale to Bertelsmann in September 2002, the first incarnation of Napster was finished.\n\nA number of file-sharing networks surfaced in Napster's wake, including Morpheus, Grokster, and KaZaA, many of which faced their own legal challenges over infringing material on the network. In 2005, a similar file-sharing service, Grokster, was sued by MGM. The case, \"MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.\", went to the Supreme Court and is considered by many to be the sequel to the Napster case, another technology that \"outpaced the law.\" Over the next few years, BitTorrent, another P2P technology, became the target of copyright scrutiny. Popular torrent trackers like the Pirate Bay faced long legal battles, but their opponents have had little success in shutting down these services permanently. These file-sharing networks paved the way for the streaming media platforms that dominate the music market.\n\nMGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. (2005) Issues related to peer-to-peer file sharing were litigated a few years later in a case involving a successor company to Napster named Grokster.\n"}

Hans Hofmeyer led as Chief Judge the \"criminal case against Mulka and others\" (reference number 4 Ks 2/63).\n\nOverall, only 789 individuals of the approximately 8,200 surviving \"SS\" personnel who served at Auschwitz and its sub-camps were ever tried, of whom 750 received sentences. Unlike the first trial in Poland held almost two decades earlier, the trials in Frankfurt were not based on the legal definition of crimes against humanity as recognized by international law, but according to the state laws of the Federal Republic.\n\nMost of the senior leaders of the camp, including Rudolf Höss, the longest-standing commandant of the camp, were turned over to the Polish authorities in 1947 following their participation as witnesses in the Nuremberg Trial. Subsequently, the accused were tried in Kraków and many sentenced to death for violent crimes and torturing of prisoners. Only \"SS-Untersturmführer\" Hans Münch was set free, having been acquitted of war crimes. That original trial in Poland is usually known as the first Auschwitz Trial.\n\n\"SS-Sturmbannführer\" Richard Baer, the last camp commandant, died in detention while still under investigation as part of the trials. Defendants ranged from members of the SS to \"kapos,\" privileged prisoners responsible for low-level control of camp internees, and included some of those responsible for the process of \"selection,\" or determination of who should be sent to the gas chambers directly from the \"ramp\" upon disembarking the trains that brought them from across Europe (\"selection\" generally entailed inclusion of all children held to be ineligible for work, generally under the age of 14, and any mothers unwilling to part with their \"selected\" children). In the course of the trial, approximately 360 witnesses were called, including around 210 survivors. Proceedings began in the \"Bürgerhaus Gallus\", in Frankfurt am Main, which was converted into a courthouse for that purpose, and remained there until their conclusion.\n\nState Attorney General (Hessian Generalstaatsanwalt) Fritz Bauer, himself briefly interned in 1933 at the Heuberg concentration camp, led the prosecution. Bauer was concerned with pursuing individual defendants serving at Auschwitz-Birkenau; only 22 SS members were charged of an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 thought to have been involved in the administration and operation of the camp. The men on trial in Frankfurt were tried only for murders and other crimes that they committed on their own initiative at Auschwitz and were not tried for genocidal actions perpetrated \"when following orders\", considered by the courts to be the lesser crime of accomplice to murder.\n\nAt a 1963 trial, KGB assassin Bohdan Stashynsky, who had committed several murders in the Federal Republic in the 1950s, was found by a German court not legally guilty of murder. Instead, Stashynsky was found to be only an accomplice to murder as the courts ruled that the responsibility for his murders rested only with his superiors in the KGB who had given him his orders.\n\nThe legal implication of the Stashynsky case were that the courts had ruled that in a totalitarian system only executive decision-makers could be convicted of murder and that anyone who followed orders and killed someone could be convicted only of being accomplices to murder. The term executive decision-maker was so defined by the courts to apply only to the highest levels of the \"Reich\" leadership during the National Socialist period, and that all who just followed orders when killing were just accomplices to murder. Someone could be only convicted of murder if it was shown that they had killed someone on their own initiative, and thus all of the accused of murder at the Auschwitz trial were tried only for murders that they had done on their own initiative.\n\nThus, Bauer could only indict for murder those who killed when not following orders, and those who had killed while following orders could be indicted as accomplices to murder. Moreover, because of the legal distinction between murderers and accomplices to murder, this meant that an SS man who killed thousands while operating the gas chambers at Auschwitz could only be found guilty of being accomplice to murder because he had been following orders, while an SS man who had beaten one inmate to death on his own initiative could be convicted of murder because he had not been following orders.\n\nBauer is said to have been opposed in the former purpose by the young Helmut Kohl, then a junior member of the Christian Democratic Union. In furtherance of that purpose Bauer sought and received support from the Institute for Contemporary History in Munich. The following historians from the Institute served as expert witnesses for the prosecution; Helmut Krausnick, Hans-Adolf Jacobsen, Hans Buchheim, and Martin Broszat. Subsequently, the information the four historians gathered for the prosecution served as the basis for their 1968 book, \"Anatomy of the SS State\", the first thorough survey of the SS based on SS records.\n\nInformation about the actions of those accused and their whereabouts had been in the possession of West German authorities since 1958, but action on their cases was delayed by jurisdictional disputes, among other considerations. The court's proceedings were largely public and served to bring many details of the Holocaust to the attention of the public in the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as abroad. Six defendants were given life sentences and several others received the maximum prison sentences possible for the charges brought against them.\n\nThe trial comprised 183 days of hearings held from 1963 to 1965. The 430 hours of the testimony of 319 witnesses, including 181 survivors of the Auschwitz concentration camp and 80 members of the camp staff, the SS, and the police were recorded on 103 tapes, and 454 volumes of files that were stored at the Hessian State Archives in Wiesbaden.\n\nIn 2017, the original magnetic tapes recording the main proceedings of the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial, which focused the world's attention on the systemic industrialized mass-murder of the Holocaust, were submitted by Germany and included in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register.\n\nThe trial attracted much publicity in Germany, but was considered by Bauer to be a failure. Bauer complained that the media treated the accused in such a manner as to imply that they were all freakish monsters, which allowed the German public to distance themselves from feeling any moral guilt about what had happened at Auschwitz, which was instead presented as the work of a few sick people who were not at all like normal Germans. Moreover, Bauer felt that because the law treated those who had followed orders when killing as accomplices to murder it implied that the policy of genocide and the Nazi rules for treating inmates at Auschwitz were in fact legitimate.\n\nBauer wrote that the way that the media had portrayed the trial had supported the\n\nFurthermore, Bauer charged that the judges, in convicting the accused, had made it appear that Germany in the Nazi era had been an occupied country, with most Germans having no choice but to follow orders. He said,\n\nA public opinion poll conducted after the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials indicated that 57% of the German public were not in favor of additional Nazi trials.\n\nIn September 1977 an additional trial was held in Frankfurt against two former members of the \"SS\" for killings in the Auschwitz satellite camp of Lagischa (Polish: Lagisza), and on the so-called \"evacuation\" (i.e. death march) from Golleschau (Goleszow) to Wodzisław Śląski (German: Loslau).\nThis and the previous trial inspired the one in the film \"The Reader\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Johnston\n\nOlin DeWitt Talmadge Johnston (November 18, 1896April 18, 1965) was a Democratic Party politician from the US state of South Carolina. He served as the 98th Governor of South Carolina, 1935–1939 and 1943–1945, and represented the state in the United States Senate from 1945 until his death from pneumonia in Columbia, South Carolina in 1965. He has become well known for denying clemency to George Stinney, a 14 year-old African-American boy who was sentenced to death in 1944 after a trial that lasted for one single day, a conviction overturned 70 years later.\n\nJohnston was born near Honea Path, South Carolina in Anderson County. His family maintained a farm and worked in the Chiquola Manufacturing Company's textile mill. Johnston's youth was divided between schooling, work on the farm, and work in the mill. He could attend school only while the family was on the farm, usually in the summer. Johnston eventually enrolled in the Textile Industrial Institute, now Spartanburg Methodist College, in Spartanburg and here Johnston earned his high school diploma in thirteen months, graduating in 1915. He entered Wofford College in the fall of 1915, where he worked his way through school by holding a variety of jobs, but his studies were interrupted by service in the United States Army during World War I.\n\nJohnston enlisted in the Army National Guard in 1917 and served with the 117th Engineer unit, which was attached to the 42nd Division, the Rainbow Division, in France. He served eighteen months overseas and attained the rank of sergeant. Following his discharge in June 1919, he returned to Wofford where he received his bachelor's degree in 1921. In the fall of 1921, Johnston entered the University of South Carolina where he earned both an M.A. in Political Science in 1923 and an LL.B. in 1924. That same year established the law firm of Faucette and Johnston in Spartanburg, and in December, married Gladys Atkinson of Spartanburg. She would serve throughout his career as his most trusted counselor.\n\nIn 1922, while still attending college, Johnston was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives as a Democrat and represented Anderson County for one term before he stepped down in 1924 to run his law practice. He was elected to the same body in 1927 as a representative from Spartanburg County and served for two terms. Johnston proved a capable and popular campaigner. As a young legislator, Johnston was an advocate of the state's textile mill workers, and his major accomplishment was shepherding a law that required mill owners to install sewers in mill villages.\n\nJohnston made his first campaign for governor in 1930, and led the slate of candidates in the primary, but lost by around 1,000 votes in the runoff election. Undeterred by the loss, he ran again and was elected Governor of South Carolina in 1934, serving for one term. In his inaugural address of 1935, Johnston stated--\"This occasion marks the end of what is commonly known as 'ring rule' in South Carolina.\" Among his achievements as governor were the repeal of the state's personal property tax; the initiation in South Carolina of the country's first rural electrification program, a pilot program personally authorized by President Roosevelt; the $3.00 license plate; and the establishment of the Industrial Commission, Labor Department, Planning and Development Board, and Ports Authority.\n\nOn taking office, Johnston proposed a series of bills to aid the state's textile workers. An ardent New Dealer, he managed to push his legislative program through the state house of representatives only to meet defeat in the Lowcountry-dominated state senate. In what has become the most famous fight between a governor and legislature in South Carolina history, Johnston tried to dismiss a number of members of the powerful State Highway Commission. After the commissioners refused to leave their posts, Johnston mobilized the National Guard to occupy the offices of the Highway Department. Ultimately, he lost his battle with the Highway Commission, and severely wounded his already poor relationship with the legislature. Johnston lost his power to name highway commissioners, a power that the governor's office has never regained.\n\nIn 1935, Johnston passed the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law to regulate the sale of alcohol in the state following the end of national prohibition. In 1937, he signed the South Carolina Public Welfare Act into law and established a state system for social security, worker's compensation and unemployment compensation. Where previous governors used the National Guard and martial law to crush strikes, Johnston used both to protect strikers and seal off mill precincts from strikebreakers. He often forced management to accept him as mediator and occasionally found state jobs for strikers whom mills refused to rehire.\n\nUnable to run for re-election in 1938, Johnston challenged \"Cotton Ed\" Smith for his seat in the United States Senate. The race brought national interest, as Smith had developed into an opponent of the New Deal and Johnston was a strong supporter. Smith was one of the senators whom President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to purge. Ultimately, Johnston lost the race to Smith. However, it was widely accepted that Smith was highly unpopular in South Carolina and that Johnston would have won the primary if Roosevelt had not intervened on his behalf or if he had focused on either pleasing the state's influential textile mill owners or preserving racial segregation. Though Johnston did not defend rights for African Americans, he would largely ignore the issue of preserving racial segregation, believing that improving the public welfare was more important. Meanwhile, Smith had opposed Roosevelt's labor reform and for years campaigned on a two-plank platform to \"keep the Negro down and the price of cotton up,\" and had recently demonstrated that he intended to maintain his fight to preserve racial segregation after he had walked out of the 1936 Democratic National Convention when he heard that a black minister was going to deliver the invocation.\n\nFollowing Roosevelt's re-election, Johnston drew more ire from the state's local businessmen when he showed his support for the President's new push for labor reform and outspokenly supported the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. South Carolina US Senator James F. Byrnes, though also an ardent New Dealer, opposed this new push, claiming it would make the state's textile mills uncompetitive. As a result of Johnston's support for new labor reform, Byrnes—a highly popular and influential figure in the state who won re-election in the 1936 Democratic primary with over 87% of the vote-- declined to endorse Johnston and instead supported the re-election of Smith. Following his loss in 1938, Johnston then ran for the Senate in a 1941 special election to replace Byrnes, who had just been appointed to the Supreme Court, but lost to South Carolina Governor Burnet R. Maybank.\n\nJohnston was elected Governor of South Carolina again in 1942. He won a narrow victory in the Democratic primary, and ran unopposed in the general election. However, he still desired a Senate seat. The outbreak of World War II meant that labor issues would not be as prominent in Johnston's second term. During that second term, he focused more on preserving racial segregation and signed laws which attempted to circumvent the \"Smith v. Allwright\" decision, which declared racially segregated primaries to be unconstitutional, by allowing political parties in the state to operate as private organizations separate from state control and therefore beyond the reach of the U.S. Supreme Court. He served until his resignation on January 3, 1945, the same day he was sworn into the U.S. Senate seat that he had been seeking for several years.\n\nJohnston had finally been elected to the Senate in 1944, defeating \"Cotton Ed\" Smith in a rematch of their 1938 race. He was subsequently re-elected three times and served in the Senate until his death in 1965. Johnston served on the committees on Agriculture and Forestry, District of Columbia, Judiciary, and Post Office and Civil Service. He became chairman of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee in 1950 and gained the nickname \"Mr. Civil Service\" for his leadership on that committee and dedication to the needs and interests of postal and other federal employees. He also joined with fellow Southerners as part of the conservative Southern Democratic coalition.\n\nJohnston was not as conservative as most other Senators from the Deep South, retaining a populist position on many economic issues. In the Senate, Johnston was a staunch advocate of public power, parity programs for farmers, a broad strong social security program, and the provision of lunches to needy school children. He also generally opposed foreign aid, viewing it as support of foreign interests at the expense of American industry and consumers. Unlike most Southern Democrats, Johnston opposed the anti-union Taft-Hartley labor law in 1947 and he voted for both the War on Poverty in 1964 and for Medicare shortly before his death in 1965. However, like virtually all other politicians from the Deep South during this period, Johnston was regionally orthodox on the \"race question\", opposing all civil rights legislation and signing the 1956 Southern Manifesto that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in \"Brown v. Board of Education\".\n\nWhile not a prominent figure nationally, Johnston was very well entrenched in his home state. He may be the only Senator to have defeated two future Senators. He retained his seat despite challenges from Strom Thurmond in the Democratic primary in 1950 and Ernest Hollings in the 1962 primary. He then turned aside the first Republican challenger, journalist W. D. Workman, Jr. In each of these races Johnston was the more liberal candidate. Hollings, who was governor in 1962, attacked Johnston as \"the tool of the Northern labor bosses\", but Johnston defeated Hollings by a 2–1 margin.\n\nHe also denied clemency to George Stinney, a 14 year-old boy who was sentenced to execution by the electric chair in 1944. Stinney had been wrongfully convicted for the murder of two girls aged 7 and 11 in his hometown of Alcolu, South Carolina. Johnston wrote in a response to one appeal for clemency that \n\nIt may be interesting for you to know that Stinney killed the smaller girl to rape the larger one. Then he killed the larger girl and raped her dead body. Twenty minutes later he returned and attempted to rape her again, but her body was too cold. All of this he admitted himself.\n\nIt is reported that these statements were merely rumours, and were contradicted at the time by the medical examination report on the girl's body.\n\nJohnston died on April 18, 1965, following a long battle with cancer. In eulogizing Johnston, his longtime associate, Senator George Aiken of Vermont, noted\"During his entire career in the Senate, he worked for those who needed his help most and whom it would have been easy to ignore and neglect.\" At the dedication of the Johnston Room at the South Caroliniana Library, Governor Robert McNair described Johnston as \"a working man, and those who made his public life possible were working people...He was a man of conviction who arrived at a time when hard decisions had to be made.\" Johnston was interred in a cemetery at Barkers Creek Baptist Church, where he attended Sunday services during his boyhood years, near Honea Path, South Carolina.\n\nJohnston's daughter, Elizabeth Johnston Patterson, served in the U.S. House of Representatives from South Carolina's 4th congressional district from 1987 to 1993. In the 1986 general election she defeated Mayor Bill Workman of Greenville, the son of the man whom her father had defeated in his last race for the U.S. Senate in 1962. Patterson was the unsuccessful 1994 Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor.\n\n\n"}

Russell made her film debut in \"The Last Tycoon\" (1976), followed by a lead role in \"Straight Time\" (1978). She was then cast in Nicolas Roeg's controversial thriller \"Bad Timing\" (1980), which earned her critical praise. After marrying Roeg in 1982, she appeared in many films directed by him, mainly arthouse and experimental films, including \"Eureka\" (1983), \"Insignificance\" (1985), and \"Cold Heaven\" (1991).\n\nRussell starred in \"Whore\" and \"Kafka\", both released in 1991. Russell appeared in the box-office hit thriller \"Wild Things\" (1998), starred in the critically acclaimed drama \"The Believer\" (2001) and, in the later 2000s, appeared in HBO miniseries \"Empire Falls\" (2005) and had a minor role in \"Spider-Man 3\" (2007).\n\nRussell was born Theresa Lynn Paup in San Diego, California, the daughter of Carole Platt (née Mall) and Jerry Russell Paup. Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and she relocated with her mother and stepfather to Burbank, where she was raised. Russell is the oldest of five siblings. According to Russell, she grew up in poverty, and her family was on food stamps to help support herself and her siblings. She attended Burbank High School, but did not graduate. At sixteen, she dropped out of high school and moved in with a 28-year-old boyfriend who was a primal scream therapist. At age seventeen, Russell enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Institute in West Hollywood to study acting.\n\nRussell had begun modeling at the age of 12, and acquainted with photographer Peter Douglas (son of Kirk Douglas) as a teenager. Through Douglas, she was introduced to film producer Sam Spiegel, who suggested her for the part of Cecilia Brady in Elia Kazan's \"The Last Tycoon\" (1976), starring Robert De Niro. After meeting with Kazan, Russell was cast in the part, playing the daughter of Robert Mitchum. Russell's next notable appearance was in the crime drama \"Straight Time\" (1978), opposite Dustin Hoffman and Kathy Bates.\n\nIn 1979, she was cast as Milena Flaherty in the thriller \"Bad Timing\" (1980), the first of six films starring Russell directed by Nicolas Roeg, whom she married in 1982. Though \"Bad Timing\" was controversial upon release, Russell's performance was praised by critic Roger Ebert, who wrote: \"If there is any reason to see this film, however, it is the performance by Theresa Russell (who was Dustin Hoffman's lover in \"Straight Time\"). She is only 22 or 23, and yet her performance is astonishingly powerful. She will be in better films, I hope, and is the only participant who need not be ashamed of this one.\" Other Roeg/Russell collaborations include \"Insignificance\", \"Eureka\", \"Track 29\", \"Cold Heaven\", and \"Aria\". Overall, however, Russell and Roeg's film collaborations were box-office failures and critically divisive.\n\nShe is the subject of a photocollage by David Hockney entitled \"Nude 17th June 1984 #10\".\n\nIn 1987, she played Catharine Peterson, a serial killer who seduces and murders wealthy men in the \"noir\" thriller \"Black Widow\", co-starring Debra Winger. Russell's performance earned praise; Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" said Russell's \"clear-eyed sweetness...adds unexpected dimension to the homicidal Catharine.\" She has also received positive comment for her roles in \"The Razor's Edge\" (1984) and \"Impulse\" (1990).\n\nRussell was then cast in Ken Russell's \"Whore\" (1991), based on the play by David Hines, playing a Los Angeles prostitute. Though the film received a mixed reception from critics, Russell's performance was praised by \"The New York Times\" and Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\". The same year, she was cast in a lead role opposite Jeremy Irons in Steven Soderbergh's \"Kafka\" (1991), a black-and-white surrealist adaptation of Franz Kafka stories.\nRussell was the narrator of the British drama \"Being Human\" (1994), starring Robin Williams, followed by the British comedy \"The Grotesque\" (1995), opposite Alan Bates and Sting. Russell was then cast in the thriller \"Wild Things\" (1998), playing the mother of Denise Richards, which was a box office success. After appearing in the crime drama \"Luckytown\" (2000) opposite James Caan and Kirsten Dunst, Russell was then cast in \"The Believer\" (2001), a drama written and directed by Henry Bean, and starring Ryan Gosling as a Jewish man who becomes a neo-Nazi. The film was critically acclaimed and received the Special Jury Prize—Drama at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Russell mainly appeared in low-budget and independent films, such as \"The House Next Door\" (2002), \"Now & Forever\" (2002), and \"The Box\" (2003).\nIn 2005, she was cast in the role of Charlene in the HBO mini-series \"Empire Falls\", opposite Ed Harris. She also appeared in the supporting role of Emma Marko in \"Spider-Man 3\" as the wife of Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church). \"Spider-Man 3\" was a major box office success, grossing nearly $900 million worldwide. The following year, she appeared in the independent drama \"Jolene\", starring Jessica Chastain, and also had a minor role playing the mother of Scarlett Johansson's character in the romantic comedy \"He's Just Not That into You\" (2009), though her scenes were eventually cut from the film.\n\nIn 2012, she appeared in the Lifetime television film \"Liz & Dick\", playing Sara Taylor, the mother of Elizabeth Taylor (portrayed by Lindsay Lohan).\n\nRussell married English film director Nicolas Roeg in February 1982 in Westminster, London. The couple had two sons, Statten (born 1983) and Maximillian (born 1985); Roeg and Russell divorced at an unspecified date.\n"}

In parts of South America, including Peru and Ecuador, it is referred to as cancha in Peru and chulpi in Ecuador.\n\nCorn nuts are prepared by soaking whole corn kernels in water for three days, then deep-frying them in oil until they are hard and brittle.\nThe kernels are soaked because they shrink during the harvesting and cleaning process, and rehydration returns them to their original size.\n\nAlbert Holloway of Oakland, California introduced corn nuts to the United States in 1936. He originally sold them to tavern owners to be given away free to their patrons as a snack that would be great with beer, calling them Olin's Brown Jug Toasted Corn.\n\nHolloway later renamed his product CornNuts. After Holloway and his sons Maurice and Rich learned of a breed of corn grown in Cusco, Peru (often referred to as Cuzco corn) that grew large kernels (some said to have been bigger than a U.S. quarter coin), the company researched developing a hybrid of the Cusco corn that could be grown effectively in California. After a decade of research, the company introduced CornNuts made with the hybrid variety in 1964. CornNuts sold on the market today are no longer of the large Cusco corn size.\n\nThe most popular brand, CornNuts was owned by Holloway's original family company until the company was purchased by Nabisco in 1998. Cornnuts is a registered trademark of Kraft Foods. It is available in six flavors: Original, BBQ (barbecue-flavored), Chile Picante con Limon, Ranch, Jalapeño Cheddar, and Nacho. \n\nA Filipino variant of corn nuts is \"cornick\". Compared to the American variety, cornick pieces are typically smaller and crispier. Garlic is the most common flavor of cornick, with other common flavors including: chili cheese, adobo, barbecue, lechón manok (also known as roasted chicken), and sweet. Major brands include Boy Bawang (literally \"Garlic Boy\" in Tagalog, commonly sold in small packets), Corn Bits, and Safari.\n\nA popular variety of cornick is the lighter, chicharrón-like \"chichacorn\", a semi-popped style of cornick using glutinous corn from the Ilocos Region which is treated with lime before frying.\n\nDiana, a snack company in El Salvador, makes a variety of corn-nut-like snacks. These are called \"elotitos\" in Spanish, or \"cornbits\". These come in a variety of seasonings, such as Lemon, Cheese and Chili, and Barbecue. These are sold throughout Central America.\n\nIn Spain they are a popular snack known as \"maíz tostado\" (\"toasted corn\"), \"maíz frito\" (\"fried corn\"), \"quicos\" (\"Frankies\") and \"pepes\" (\"Joes\"). \nThe base flavor is very salty, though barbecue is also available.\nRecently, crushed corn nuts are being introduced as a cover for battering.\n\n\n"}

The town was part of the Tarnopol Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic until September 1939. The town itself was founded in 1522 by Polish King Sigismund I the Old. The dynasty had a large following before the Second World War, but most of its adherents perished in the Holocaust.\n\nChortkov is one of the branches of the Ruzhiner dynasty, together with the Bohush, Boyan, Husiatyn, Sadigura, Kapishnitz, Vasloi, and Shtefanesht dynasties.\n\nThe first Rebbe of Chortkov was Rabbi Duvid Moshe Friedman (1828-1903), son of Rabbi Yisroel Friedman of Ruzhyn. He was born in 1828 on the festival of Shavuos. His first wife was the daughter of Rabbi Aaron Twerski of Chernobyl. His second wife was his first cousin, a daughter of his brother Rabbi Shalom Yosef Friedman of Sadigura. In 1865, 14 years after his father's death, he settled in Chortkov forming his own community there. His followers were one of the largest Hasidic groups in Galicia, numbering in the thousands. He led an ascetic life, secluding and preoccupying himself with study and prayer day and night. Although he preferred to detach himself from world affairs and distance himself from communal disputes, he was nevertheless considered a major leader of Central European Jewry. To this instance, he agreed to meet with Theodore Herzl who had sent him a personal letter hoping to garner his support for the Zionist Movement, although the meeting never materialised. His oldest son, Reb Nuchem Mordechai, died aged 21 in 1880. He died on Hoshana Rabbah, 1903, and was succeeded by his second son, Reb Yisroel. His teachings have been published in \"Divrei Dovid\", \"Beis Yisroel\" and \"Knesset Yisroel\".\n\nRabbi Dovid Moshe's son was Rabbi Yisroel Friedman. Rabbi Yisroel ran his Chasidic court with the concept of \"Hod ShebaTiferes\" (\"Majesty in Glory\"; in kabalistic terms). He died in 1934. After Rabbi Yisroel, his sons, Rabbi Nochum Mordechai Friedman and Rabbi Dov Ber Friedman, served as Rebbes. Rabbi Dov Ber died in 1936. Rabbi Nochum fled to the British Mandate of Palestine in 1939, and died in Jerusalem in 1946. His son Rabbi Shlomo Friedman led the Chortkover Hasidim until his death in Tel Aviv in 1959.\n\nAmong the current leaders of the Chortkover Hasidim are Rabbi Yisroel Friedman of Manchester, England, and Rabbi Dov Ber Friedman of Antwerp, Belgium. Both are grandsons of the Chortkover Rebbe Dov Ber, but have refused the title of Chortkover Rebbe. In addition to the Chortkover communities in Manchester and Antwerp, there is also one in Jerusalem, and one in Safed (Tzefas).\n\nThe Chortkov Manchester UK community are building a new synagogue to be completed in 2020 which will be a new world centre for Chortkov. The building has unique beauty, and replicates the original Chortkov dynasty synagogue, originally designed and built by the first Rebbe Dovid Moishe of Chortkov in 1876.\n\nThe building will stand as a memory to the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust, and to reinstate one of the thousands of synagogues and yeshivas destroyed by the Nazis in World War II.\n\n"}
{"id": "1859203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859203", "title": "History of lacrosse", "text": "History of lacrosse\n\nLacrosse has its origins in a tribal game played by eastern Woodlands Native Americans and by some Plains Indians tribes in what is now the United States of America and Canada. The game was extensively modified by European colonizers to North America to create its current collegiate and professional form. There were hundreds of native men playing a ball game with sticks. The game began with the ball being tossed into the air and the two sides rushing to catch it. Because of the large number of players involved, these games generally tended to involve a huge mob of players swarming the ball and slowly moving across the field. Passing the ball was thought of as a trick, and it was seen as cowardly to dodge an opponent. Years later lacrosse is still a popular sport played all over the world.\n\nModern day lacrosse descends from and resembles games played by various Native American communities. These include games called \"dehuntshigwa'es\" in Oee (\"little war\"), \"begadwe \" in Mohawk language (\"little brother of war\"), \"baaga`adowe\" in Ojibwe (\"bump hips\") and \"kabucha\" in Choctaw.\n\nLacrosse is one of the oldest team sports in North America. There is evidence that a version of lacrosse originated in what is now Canada as early as the 17th century. Native American lacrosse was played throughout modern Canada, but was most popular around the Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic seaboard, and American South.\nTraditional lacrosse games were sometimes major events that could last several days. As many as 100 to 1,000 men from opposing villages or tribes would participate. The games were played in open plains located between the two villages, and the goals could range from to apart.\n\nRules for these games were decided on the day before. Generally there was no out-of-bounds, and the ball could not be touched with the hands. The goals would be selected as large rocks or trees; in later years wooden posts were used. Playing time was often from sunup until sundown.\n\nThere were traditionally three areas of scoring on the stickball pole. There would be a mark, about chest high on the pole, which, when the ball hit above this mark, would award one point. Contact below that point was not scored. The top half of the pole, well above arms' reach, was usually worth two points when hit. The very top of the pole, usually embellished with a large figure of a fish or other sacred animal, was worth three points. In recreational games, scoring was loosely kept, most times by the audience or a few players. Games typically would reach around twenty points before concluding.\n\nThe game began with the ball being tossed into the air and the two sides rushing to catch it. Because of the large number of players involved, these games generally tended to involve a huge mob of players swarming the ball and slowly moving across the field. Passing the ball was thought of as a trick, and it was seen as cowardly to dodge an opponent.\n\nThe medicine men acted as coaches, and the women of the tribe were usually limited to serving refreshments to the players. There was also a women's version of lacrosse called amtahcha, which used much shorter sticks with larger heads.\n\nLacrosse traditionally had many different purposes. Some games were played to settle inter-tribal disputes. This function was essential to keeping the Six Nations of the Iroquois together. Lacrosse was also played to toughen young warriors for combat, for recreation, as part of festivals, and for the bets involved. Finally, lacrosse was played for religious reasons: \"for the pleasure of the Creator,\" and to collectively pray for something.\n\nPregame rituals were very similar to rituals associated with war. Players would decorate their bodies with paint and charcoal. Players also decorated their sticks or stick racks with objects representing qualities desired in the game. Strict taboos were held on what players could eat before a game, and the medicine man performed rituals to prepare players and their sticks. The night before a game, players wore ceremonial regalia and held a special dance. Sacrifices were held, and sacred expressions were yelled to intimidate opponents.\n\nOn the day of the game, teams walked to the field and were slowed by constant rituals. One ceremony was \"going to water\", in which players dunked their sticks in water and the shaman gave a spiritual and strategic pep talk. Sometimes players would receive ceremonial scratches on their arms or torso.\n\nBefore the game, every player was required to place a wager. Items such as handkerchiefs, knives, trinkets and horses were part of the wager. The bets would be displayed on a rack near the spectators, and items would be awarded proportionally to the winner of each quarter.\n\nWhen the game was over ceremonial dance took place, along with a large feast for the hungry players.\n\nSome early lacrosse balls were fashioned out of wood. Others were made of deerskin stuffed with hair. They were typically three inches in diameter.\n\nThe first lacrosse sticks were essentially giant wooden spoons with no netting. A more advanced type had one end bent into a 4 to diameter circle, which was filled with netting. This netting was made of wattup or deer sinew. The most recent Native American sticks use a U-shape instead of a circle.\n\nThese sticks were bent into shape after being softened through steaming, and lengths typically ranged from 2 to . Lacrosse sticks often had elaborate carvings on them intended to help players in the game. Lacrosse sticks were so treasured that many players requested to be buried with their stick beside them upon death.\n\nSome versions of lacrosse used unusual stick designs. In the St. Lawrence Valley a version was played in which the head took up two thirds of the stick. In the Southwestern United States a double-stick version was played with sticks about two and a half feet long.\n\nNo protective equipment was worn in traditional lacrosse.\n\nThe first westerners to encounter lacrosse were French Jesuit missionaries in the St. Lawrence Valley. During the 1630s, they witnessed the game and condemned it. They were opposed to lacrosse because it was violent, betting was involved, and it was part of the religion they sought to eradicate.\n\nOne missionary, Jean de Brébeuf, was the first to write about lacrosse and thus gave it its name. He described the Hurons in present-day Ontario playing \"crosse\" in 1637. Some say the name originated from the French term for field hockey, \"le jeu de la crosse\".\n\nDespite Jesuit opposition, many other European colonists were intrigued by lacrosse. Betting on games became common, and around 1740 many French colonists were taking up the game. However, it is widely believed they could not match the skill of the Native Americans.\n\nJames Smith described in some detail a game being played in 1757 by his fellow tribe members \"wherein they used a wooden ball, about three inches diameter, and the instrument they moved it with was a strong staff about five feet long, with a hoop net on the end of it, large enough to contain the ball.\"\n\nIn 1763, Ojibwas used a lacrosse game to capture Fort Michilimackinac (now Mackinac). Natives invited the fort's British troops to watch a lacrosse game. The players gradually worked their way close to the gates, and then rushed into the fort and carried out a general massacre.\n\nIn 1805 during an expedition up the Mississippi River, U.S. army officer Lt. Zebulon Pike observed a group of young Ho-Chunk (also known as Winnebago) and Sioux men playing this game, or one resembling it, near the east bank of the river, in what is now west-central Wisconsin. He named the region \"Prairie de la Crosse\", which in turn inspired the name of both the Wisconsin county and its principal city. Today, two statues in the city of La Crosse commemorate the game observed by Pike.\n\nIn 1834 a team of Caughnawaga Indians demonstrated lacrosse in Montreal. Although response to the demonstrations was not overwhelming, interest in lacrosse steadily grew in Canada.\n\nIn 1856, William George Beers, a Canadian dentist, founded Montreal Lacrosse Club. He codified the game in 1867 to shorten the length of each game, reduce the number of players, use a redesigned stick, and use a rubber ball. The first game played under Beers' rules was at Upper Canada College in 1867. During the 1860s lacrosse became Canada's national game. The first overseas exhibition games were played in 1867. In 1876, Queen Victoria witnessed an exhibition game and was impressed, saying \"The game is very pretty to watch.\" Her endorsement was enough for many English girls' schools to adopt the sport in the 1890s. The Mohawk Lacrosse Club in Troy, New York became the first organized club in the United States.\n\nAs lacrosse grew, opposition to its violent aspects was a major obstacle. The game was banned in some areas when, in 1900, Choctaw Indians attached lead weights to their sticks to use them as skull-crackers.\n\nBy the 20th century, many high schools, colleges and universities had adopted lacrosse as a league sport. Lacrosse became an Olympic sport for the 1904 and 1908 Summer Olympics, but was then dropped as an official sport. After 1908, lacrosse was a sport in the World Games.\n\nIn the 1930s, an indoor version of the game, box lacrosse, was introduced in Canada. It quickly became the dominant form of the sport in Canada, in part due to the severe winter weather that limited outdoor play.\nMinor leagues developed for box lacrosse and college lacrosse. Two professional leagues also were created: In 1987 the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League was founded; it eventually became the Major Indoor Lacrosse League, and then the National Lacrosse League (NLL). In the summer of 2001, a professional field lacrosse league, known as Major League Lacrosse (MLL), was inaugurated. In 2019, the Premier Lacrosse League was created, which offered higher wages and better benefits for the players.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1859216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859216", "title": "Kuy teav", "text": "Kuy teav\n\nKuy teav or kway teow () is a Cambodian noodle soup consisting of rice noodles with pork stock and toppings. A popular breakfast dish in Cambodia, \"kuy teav\" can be found at marketplace (\"phsar\") stalls, roadside vendors, restaurants and in shophouses across the country, and is distinguished by its clear broth and array of herbs, aromatics and other garnishes and condiments.\n\nThe word \"kway teow\" derives from the Teochew Chinese word (peng'im: \"guêdiao\") and refers to cut noodles made from long-grain rice flour (as opposed to glutinous rice flour). This term also refers to the dish: a rice noodle soup with minced meat and various other toppings and seasonings. In Khmer, \"kuy teav\" is properly pronounced but is often elided to (romanized as \"k'tieu\", \"katieu\", \"kateav\", etc.) due to the sesquisyllabic nature of the Khmer language. The term has cognates in Southeast Asia with \"hủ tiếu\" in Vietnamese, \"kway teow\" in Malaysia and Singapore, and \"kuai tiao\" () in Thai being analogues.\n\n\"Kuy teav\" is prepared with partially dry thin squarish rice noodles cooked by quickly immersing the noodles in boiling water. The noodles are then strained, placed into a bowl, and moistened with nutty, caramelised garlic oil. After dressing with a sticky brown liquid made of oyster sauce, soy sauce and a pinch of sugar, the bowl is then filled with a clear broth made from pork bones, dried squid, and sugar, and seasoned with a bit of fish sauce. Then the meat toppings are added, which may include an assembly of different types of meat, such as pork loaf, minced pork, pork belly, duck, seafood or offal. Availability is the main factor in what toppings are used in \"kuy teav\"; some versions can be quite humble and basic, using only some ground pork and perhaps some dried shrimp for protein, while others can be more time-consuming and extravagant. Finally, when the dish is presented at the table, the diner may add a number of garnishes and aromatics to customise the dish in accordance with his or her preferences.\n\nIn Cambodia, \"kuy teav\" is still primarily a breakfast dish, and will typically be sold out by vendors before midday. As the pork broth is intended to be subtle rather than spicy, a plethora of optional herbs and other aromatics is always presented, allowing the diner to adjust the textures and flavours of the dish to his or her liking. In fact, in Cambodia it is precisely the use of garnishes and condiments that defines the main flavour profile of the dish (garlic, limes and pepper are a common flavour trio in Cambodian cuisine), rather than the broth. The dish is served with garnishes that can include lettuce leaves, bean sprouts, fresh herbs (such as spring onions (scallions), sawtooth coriander and holy basil), crushed black kampot pepper, lime juice, and caramelised garlic oil. Many types of chilli (fresh, dried, pickled) and chilli sauce are also normally present at the table, to either add into the broth or to be used as a dipping sauce for the meat toppings, as well as soy sauce, fish sauce and sugar. \"Kuy teav\" is also sometimes eaten with deep fried breadsticks, similar to how the Cambodians would eat congee (rice porridge).\n\nMoreover, \"kuy teav\" may be presented in one of two ways: with all the ingredients in the soup, or with the soup on the side. Both versions can have exactly the same ingredients but allow the diner to control the balance of flavours, spiciness and textures. When the dish is served this way (“dry” as opposed to “wet”) the dish takes on the appearance of a noodle salad. Finally, the Phnom Penh version of \"kuy teav\" is the most extravagant and features the most embellishments, owing to the city’s historical wealth and importance. \"Kuy teav Phnom Penh\" may contain some or all of the following toppings: sliced pork belly, ground pork, pig’s blood jelly, chopped pork offal (such as intestine, heart, liver and lung), roast duck, Mekong River prawns, sliced fish cake and squid. Modern-day versions of \"kuy teav\" featuring beef, chicken or seafood (rather than the original pork broth) have also evolved, but the plethora of garnishes that distinguish \"kuy teav\" remains the same.\n\n or is eaten in Vietnam as a breakfast dish. It may be served either as a soup () or dry with no broth (). became popular in the 1960s in southern Vietnam, especially in Saigon.

The Stephen in question is one of the Seven Deacons to the Apostles.\n\nThe text describes a conflict at the very beginnings of Christianity about the nature of Jesus of Nazareth. Stephen appears on the scene and recounts Revelation as a literal truth, to which the crowd declare blasphemy, and Caiaphas has him arrested and beaten.\n\nThe text then has Stephen appear before Pilate whom he tells to not speak, and orders him to recognize Jesus. The tale is set before Paul of Tarsus' conversion, and so proceeds to describe how Paul persecutes Stephen by having him crucified. However, an angel rescues Stephen, so Saul/Paul has molten lead poured into his mouth and ears, and nails into his heart and feet, but an angel heals him again.\n\nThe next day, the text proclaims that Stephen was led out to be judged before the crowd, but instead Stephen recounts a supposed prophecy by Nathan of Jesus' coming, which annoys the guards to the extent that they bind him and take him to the head of the guard. The Sanhedrin decide that Stephen should be stoned, but Nicodemus and Gamaliel (the Jewish scholar) try to defend him with their bodies, dying in the process.\n\nAfter ten hours, Stephen eventually dies, and is buried in a silver coffin by Pilate, against Stephen's wishes. An angel moves the body to where Stephen wished to be buried, making Pilate shocked by the loss of the bodies. Pilate then receives a vision of Stephen, and converts. Likewise the memory of Stephen is said by the text to have made Paul convert.\n\nMany scholars think that Pilate was a later addition to the text, the involvement of Pilate in the story looking somewhat clumsy, and the text being primarily an attempt to explain Paul's motives for conversion, but also his prior villainy. The text also highlights Stephen as the first ever Christian martyr.\n\nhttp://www.gnosis.org/library/revstev.htm\n"}

The unit consists of Company sized units which have their headquarters in Auckland and Whangarei. The unit is part of Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) headquartered at Waiouru (see Structure of the New Zealand Army).\n\nThe Auckland and Northland Regiments can trace their roots back to the early colonial days of New Zealand. The oldest unit it traces its heritage back is the Auckland Fencibles, a militia defence unit of Auckland formed in 1846. They were a key player in the Invasion of Waikato. The unit then moved on to play other key roles in the New Zealand land wars, in which earned the battle honour 'New Zealand', which was not added to the Auckland Regiments battle honours and recently there has been agitation to keep it that way.\n\n1st Auckland Infantry (Countess of Ranfurly's Own) Battalion was then formed from the amalgamation of the Victoria Rifles, New Zealand Native Rifles, Auckland Rifles, Gordon Rifles, Avondale Rifles and Newtown Rifles in 1898. In Northland a similar amalgamation took place in 1911 after Sir Alexander Godley's reforms of the Territorial Cadre in 1910.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I both the Auckland and Northland Regiments provided a 250-man company to the 1000 strong infantry battalion that was raised from the Auckland region. This was named the 1st Battalion Auckland Regiment with 2nd and 3rd Battalions being raised later in the war. Three Victoria Crosses were awarded to members of the Auckland Regiment in the Great War.\n\nDuring World War II the Auckland and Northland Regiments contributed mainly to the 18th, 21st, 24th and 29th Battalions. The Regiments were awarded 10 battle honours in recognition of the role played by soldiers in these battalions. The Northland Regiment also has strong links to 28th Maori Battalion.\n\nIn 1948 the two regiments were reformed as part of the post-war Territorial Force. The 11/4 Artillery Battery can trace its lineage to 1/1 Battery and 4 Medium Battery of the New Zealand Artillery Regiment. Then, in 1964 they were amalgamated as a Battalion under the umbrella of a single Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment and formed the current unit; the 3rd Auckland (Countess of Ranfurly's Own) Battalion Group.\n\nThe 3rd Battalion was formed by the amalgamation of the 3rd Auckland (Countess of Ranfurly's Own) and 15th Northland Regiments in 1965. The amalgamation saw the new battalion become a TF battalion of the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment.\n\nThis was until the later reorganisation of 1999, which saw the TF battalions split from the RNZIR to become multi-function battalion groups. The Auckland and Northland Regiment became the 3rd Auckland (Countess of Ranfurly's Own) and Northland Battalion Group.\n\nIn recent years, members of the unit have once more been called upon to volunteer for overseas service. In 2000 and 2001, many members of the unit served with NZBatt 3, the third rotation of Kiwi troops in East Timor. Soldiers from the unit have also formed part of two deployments to the Solomon Islands, the first in 2007 and the second in 2008.\n\nThe role of the unit is to provide trained volunteers for overseas operations as required, as well as a trained pool of personnel to be able to respond to civil emergency tasks within New Zealand. In order to meet these roles the Unit trains regularly throughout the year. Training is broken down into three-hour training nights, regular weekend exercises and an annual two-week exercise.\n\nThe unit is a multi-combat role Battalion Group in which CO 3rd Auckland and Northland Battalion Group can call on a range of different arms to achieve an objective. It consists of Light Infantry; Light Artillery, Field Engineers, Medical Personal, Combat Service Support (CSS) and Communication support.\n\n\n\nOn 9 October 2007 former Governor-General of New Zealand Dame Catherine Tizard was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Regiment, a largely ceremonial role. In 2011 this appointment passed to Lieutenant Colonel (Retd) Grant Ellis ED, RNZIR, a former Commanding Officer of the regiment (1994–1997).\n\n\n"}

However, his sons and grandsons founded their own dynasties which are collectively known as the \"House of Ruzhin\". These dynasties, which follow many of the traditions of the Ruzhiner Rebbe, are Bohush, Boyan, Chortkov, Husiatyn, Sadigura, and Shtefanesht. The dynasties of Vizhnitz and Vasloi are related to the Ruzhiner Rebbe through his daughters.\n\nRabbi Yisroel Friedman was a direct descendant through the male line of Rabbi Dov Ber, the Maggid of Mezritch (1704-1772), the main disciple of the Baal Shem Tov. Friedman's father, Rabbi Sholom Shachne of Prohobisht (1769-1802), died when he was six years old. He had an older brother, Avrohom (1787–1812), who became Rebbe of their father's Hasidim upon their father's death. When Rabbi Avrohom died without issue in 1812, Rabbi Yisroel became Rebbe first in Skvyra and then in Ruzhyn, where he attracted thousands of followers.\n\nThe Ruzhiner Rebbe set a regal tone for his court, living in a palatial home with splendid furnishings; riding in a silver-handled carriage drawn by four white horses; being accompanied by an entourage of attendants; and wearing a golden yarmulke and stylish clothing with solid-gold buttons. In addition to his thousands of Hasidim, he wielded significant influence in Ukraine and Volhynia through the marriages of his six sons and four daughters, who married into other Hasidic rabbinical courts as well as wealthy banking families.\n\nThe Rebbe's extravagant lifestyle and prestige aroused the envy of Tsar Nicholas I and the ire of the Jewish \"maskilim\" (members of the Jewish Enlightenment movement); the latter continually plotted to bring about the Rebbe's downfall. In 1838, at the height of a two-year investigation of the murder of two Jewish informers, the Rebbe was accused of complicity in the murders and jailed by the Tsar. He was released after 22 months and put under police surveillance, since the Tsar still believed he was fomenting opposition to the government. The Rebbe fled to Austria, which granted him citizenship and protection from extradition.\nThe Rebbe re-established his court in Sadigura, Bukovina, Austria (Carpathian Mountains), where he built another palatial home and synagogue and drew thousands of followers from throughout Galicia, Russia and Romania. All the Jews in Sadigura became Ruzhiner Hasidim. He was also active in Israel as president of Kollel Vohlin, raising and distributing the money to support the Hasidic community in the Land of Israel, and initiated the construction of Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue in the Old City of Jerusalem, which was completed by his son, Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman, in 1872.\n\nThe Rebbe spent his last decade in Sadigura, where he died at the age of 54 on 9 October 1850. His gravesite in Sadigura, which eventually became the burial place of two of his sons, Avraham Yaakov of Sadigura and Dov Ber of Leova, and other family members, became a shrine for Ruzhiner Hasidim. His gravestone was destroyed during World War I and afterwards replaced by a large white concrete slab.\n\nThe Ruzhiner Rebbe's eldest son, Rabbi Sholom Yosef Friedman (1813–1851), led his father's Hasidim until his untimely death less than a year later. The Ruzhiner's second son, Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman (1820–1883) then became the first Sadigura Rebbe and the other sons founded their own Hasidic courts in other locales.\n\nTo this day, the Rebbes of the House of Ruzhin conduct their courts regally, claiming descent from the royal lineage of King David. Among the traditions practiced by Rebbes of the House of Ruzhin are:\n\n"}

{"id": "1859264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859264", "title": "Gospel of Marcion", "text": "Gospel of Marcion\n\nThe Gospel of Marcion, called by its adherents the Gospel of the Lord, was a text used by the mid-2nd-century Christian teacher Marcion of Sinope to the exclusion of the other gospels. The majority of scholars agree the gospel was an edited version of the Gospel of Luke.\n\nAlthough no manuscript of Marcion's gospel survives, scholars such as Adolf von Harnack and Dieter T. Roth have been able to largely reconstruct the text from quotations in the anti-Marcionite treatises of orthodox Christian apologists such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Epiphanius.\n\nLike the Gospel of Mark, Marcion's gospel lacked any nativity story. Luke's account of the baptism of Jesus was also absent. The gospel began, roughly, as follows:\nOther Lukan passages that did not appear in Marcion's gospel include the parables of the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son.\n\nWhile Marcion preached that the God who had sent Jesus Christ was an entirely new, alien god, distinct from the vengeful God of Israel who had created the world, this radical view was not explicitly taught in Marcion's gospel. The Gospel of Marcion is, however, much more amenable to a Marcionite interpretation than the canonical Gospel of Luke, because it lacks many of the passages in Luke that explicitly link Jesus with Judaism, such as the parallel birth narratives of John the Baptist and Jesus in Luke 1-2.\n\nScholars have entertained three possible hypotheses concerning the relationship between Marcion's gospel and the Gospel of Luke. The traditional view, espoused by early Church Fathers in their polemics against Marcion, is that the Gospel of Marcion was produced by removing passages from Luke that contradicted Marcion's theological views. The two other possibilities are that Luke was created by adding anti-Marcionite passages to Marcion's gospel, or that both Luke and Marcion's gospel are edited versions of some lost prior gospel. Those who espouse this last view usually maintain that the Gospel of Marcion is closer to the original than canonical Luke.\n\nChurch Fathers wrote, and the majority of modern scholars agree, that Marcion edited Luke to fit his own theology, Marcionism. The late 2nd-century writer Tertullian stated that Marcion, \"expunged [from the Gospel of Luke] all the things that oppose his view... but retained those things that accord with his opinion\".\n\nAccording to this view, Marcion eliminated the first two chapters of Luke concerning the nativity, and began his gospel at Capernaum making modifications to the remainder suitable to Marcionism. The differences in the texts below highlight the Marcionite view that Jesus did not follow the Prophets and that the earth is evil.\n\nLate 19th- and early 20th-century theologian Adolf von Harnack, in agreement with the traditional account of Marcion as revisionist, theorized that Marcion believed there could be only one true gospel, all others being fabrications by pro-Jewish elements, determined to sustain worship of Yahweh; and that the true gospel was given directly to Paul the Apostle by Christ himself, but was later corrupted by those same elements who also corrupted the Pauline epistles. In this understanding, Marcion saw the attribution of this gospel to Luke the Evangelist as a fabrication, so he began what he saw as a restoration of the original gospel as given to Paul. Von Harnack wrote that:\n\nBiblical scholars as varied as Johann Salomo Semler, Johann Gottfried Eichhorn, Albrecht Ritschl, John Knox, Joseph B. Tyson, and David Trobisch have dissented from the traditional view, arguing that the Gospel of Luke is either a later redaction of the Gospel of Marcion, or that both gospels are redactions of some prior gospel, with Marcion's text being closer to the original. Several arguments have been put forward in favor of this view.\n\nFirstly, there are many passages found in Marcion's gospel that seem to contradict his own theology, which is unexpected if Marcion was simply removing passages from Luke that he didn't agree with. Matthias Klinghardt has argued:\nSecondly, Marcion himself claimed that the gospel he used was original, whereas the canonical Luke was a falsification. The accusations of adulteration are therefore mutual:\n\nThirdly, John Knox and Joseph Tyson have shown that, of the material that is omitted from Marcion's gospel but included in canonical Luke, the vast majority (79.5-87.2%) is unique to Luke, with no parallel in the earlier gospels of Mark and Matthew. They argue that this result is entirely expected if canonical Luke is the result of adding new material to Marcion's gospel or its source, but that it is very much unexpected if Marcion removed material from Luke.\n\nSome proponents of the priority of Marcion's gospel have explored the implications of their view for the broader synoptic problem. In 2008, Matthias Klinghardt proposed that Marcion's gospel was based on the Gospel of Mark, that the Gospel of Matthew was an expansion of the Gospel of Mark with reference to the Gospel of Marcion, and that the Gospel of Luke was an expansion of the Gospel of Marcion with reference to the Gospels of Matthew and Mark. In Klinghardt's view, this model elegantly accounts for the double tradition— material shared by Matthew and Luke, but not Mark— without appealing to purely hypothetical documents, such as the Q source.\n\n\n"}

During a brief sponsorship period with Fortis, its sponsored name was \"Fortis Türkiye Kupası\". Now Ziraat Bankası is the sponsor and the sponsored name for the cup is \"Ziraat Türkiye Kupası\".\n\nThe cup was created in 1962 and has taken place every year since then. Many different formats, including a pure knockout competition and group stages, have been tried and finally for the 2012–13 season, an expanded tournament format has been adopted. A record 156 teams compete in the tournament. After five knockout rounds, a round-robin group stage is contested. Group winners and runners-up play in semi-finals and finals. Galatasaray are the current holders of the cup.\n\nThe current format of the Turkish Cup consists of 156 clubs from the top four leagues of the Turkish football league system and the Turkish Regional Amateur League. The first round consists of 86 clubs from the TFF Third League and Turkish Regional Amateur League. The second round consists of winners from the first round alongside clubs from the Süper Lig, TFF First League and TFF Second League. Teams playing in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League enter at the fourth round. After the fifth round, 8 winners are drawn into two groups of four teams and play in a round-robin tournament. Winners and runners-up of the groups play in semi-finals as two-legged ties. Winners of the semi-finals play the final match in a neutral ground.\n\nThe final consists of a single match that takes place in a neutral setting. The winner of the cup earns a spot in the play-off round of the UEFA Europa League, and also plays in the Turkish Super Cup against the Süper Lig champions. If the winner of the cup has already secured a spot in a European competition because of their league finish, the runners-up are sent to compete. Because of this, Kayseri Erciyesspor competed in the 2007–08 UEFA Cup despite being relegated to the TFF First League that season.\n\nTurkish Football Federation awards the \"Turkish Cup trophy\" (current design is seen on the right) to the winners of the final. Cup winners and runners-up receive 50 medals each. Also prize money is given away. TFF awards prizes not by winning a round, but just by reaching the round. The final match is an exception, where runners-up receive less than cup winners. The prize money is in United States dollars. A sum of $10,500,000 worth prize money is awarded to participating teams. As an honour of the tournament, the cup winner club wears a roundel of the Turkish flag in the next footballing season.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The trail is named for Henry Hudson, who explored the harbor at Atlantic Highlands and the Raritan Bayshore coastline in the early 1600s. The trail is not near the Hudson River.\n\nThe , paved multi-use\ntrail is part of the Monmouth County Park System. The rail trail\ntraverses the Raritan Bayshore and connects inland\nto Freehold Borough using the former\nrights of way of several rail lines. Although trees line much of the trail, it affords some views of surrounding wetlands, streams, woodlands and fields.\n\nThe Garden State Parkway is the dividing line between the northern and southern sections of the trail. The northern section runs 12 miles east from the Aberdeen-Keyport border to Highlands, north of and roughly parallel to NJ Route 36. A missing link in Atlantic Highlands requires on-road travel between Avenue D and the Atlantic Highlands marina. The southern (inland) section runs south from Matawan to Freehold. A long missing link in Marlboro divides this inland section into its own north and south segments.\n\nThe property for the inland sections is currently railbanked by New Jersey Transit (NJT), which leases the line for trail usage to the Monmouth County Park System. The trail is administered by the Monmouth County Park System and is leased through 2020 for use as a trail. If future economic conditions warrant resuming operation, NJT reserves the right to restore rail service at any time. The railroad line was never officially abandoned, unlike most rail trails.\n\nThe Henry Hudson Trail was the first rail-trail developed in Monmouth County,\nand was joined by the Union Transportation rail-trail in 2010.\n\nThe southern segment of the inland section runs from County Route 537 in Freehold (where it runs past a closed youth detention center) north to Allen Road in Marlboro (near Marlboro High School and Route 79). This section was opened in 2006. In 2013 a connecting trail was built from a point near the Allen Road terminus to the trails of the county's Big Brook Park.\n\nThe northern segment of the inland section runs from Wyncrest Road in Marlboro north to Stillwell Street in Matawan, generally paralleling Route 79 for much of the way. This section was opened in 2006, with a short additional stretch completed in 2011. This segment has an old train station which has fallen into disrepair due to no longer being used.\n\nThe Atlantic section running east-west was the first to be developed, opening in 1992. The route roughly parallels Route 36 from the Garden State Parkway to Atlantic Highlands, with trail heads at Lloyd Road and Clark Street in Aberdeen/Keyport and Avenue D in Atlantic Highlands. This section suffers from many busy road crossings. East of Avenue D, a on-road detour is required to connect to the Bayshore extension to Highlands.\n\nThe Bayshore extension (formerly Bayshore Trail) opened in April 2009 and extends the Henry Hudson Trail eastward from the Atlantic Highlands marina below the bluffs of Atlantic Highlands, ending at Popamora Point Park at the western end of Highlands..\n\nThe Marlboro Township section of the rail line began in the 1860s as the Monmouth County\nAgricultural Railroad. The initial discussion concerning the construction of the railroad began in the 1840s, as an improved means of hauling produce to Keyport docks. The initial effort failed and began again in 1867 with work being completed about 1880. The railroad carried produce, manufactured goods and marl\nfertilizer to the rail pier in Keyport. The marl was dug from the large pits owned by many local farmers such as O.C. Herbert or Uriah Smock in Marlboro. The railroad can be seen on a map from 1873. All\nservice ceased in the 1950s. The\noriginal \"Atlantic\" section is built on the former right-of-way\nof the Freehold and Atlantic Highlands Railroad, which was later absorbed by\nthe Central Railroad of New Jersey.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, railbanking of the line between Freehold and\nMatawan was considered. Freight service over this stretch of track had ceased in phases; first\nin 1973 and then completely by Conrail in 1983. Ownership of the line changed hands several\ntimes, eventually going to New Jersey Transit (NJT). NJT, in turn, selected the rail corridor as one of three\noptions for its MOM (Middlesex–Ocean–Monmouth) commuter\nrail line proposal.\nEventually, NJT removed the Freehold-Matawan line from MOM consideration and leased the\nline to Monmouth County park system for trail usage.\n\nIn September 2009, a portion of the southern section of the trail from Texas Road (Matawan) to Greenwood Road (Marlboro) was closed for an 18-month project for a Superfund cleanup at the site of the former Imperial oil company.\n\nThe final two \"missing links\" are on hold as NJT has resurrected the idea of utilizing the\nrail corridor for its MOM commuter rail line.\nAccording to the Sierra Club, should the transit agency opt to restore commuter service along\nthe line, it would be the first instance in U.S history where a rail trail reverted to\nrailway usage.\n\n"}

The Sanz-Klausenburger Hasidim are located in Borough Park, New York City, while the Sanzer Hasidim are based in Kiryat Sanz, Netanya, Israel. There are also followings in Jerusalem; Stamford Hill, London; Antwerp; and Union City, New Jersey.\n\nThe Klausenburger Rebbes are descended from Rabbi Chaim Halberstam of Sanz, who was a disciple of Rabbi Naftoli Tzvi of Ropshitz. Rabbi Naftoli was a disciple of Rebbe Elimelech of Lizhensk author of \"Noam Elimelech\". Rebbe Elimelech was a disciple of Rebbe Dovber, the \"Maggid\" (Preacher) of Mezritch, the primary disciple of the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism.\n\nThe Klausenburger dynasty was founded by Rabbi Yekusiel Yehudah Halberstam in 1927, when he assumed the position of Rav of Klausenburg, the capital city of Transylvania in western Romania. Halberstam was the great-grandson of Rabbi Chaim of Sanz, founder of the Sanz Hasidic dynasty.\n\nRabbi Yekusiel Yehudah Halberstam grew up in Rudnik, Poland, and was known as a child prodigy and an excellent scholar. In the town of Klausenburg, which he led until the outbreak of World War II, he attracted many followers, and a great number of Sanz Hasidim began to follow the young Rebbe.\n\nAs a result of the Holocaust, almost the entire community was destroyed. Approximately 15% survived the Holocaust, including the Rebbe, who lost his wife and eleven children. He emerged as a leader in the displaced persons camps in Europe as he created a communal survivors organization called She'aris Hapleitah (\"the surviving remnant\"), which operated religious schools for boys and girls and yeshivas for young men in 19 different DP camps, as well as a host of religious services.\n\nIn 1947, he emigrated to America and established his court in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, where he began a widescale movement to increase Jewish observance. He founded many Jewish day schools and institutions of higher learning. He launched revolutionary programs for comprehensive study of the Talmud. He created a program called Mifal HaShas, in which students would master thirty folios of the Talmud in one month. His influence permeated areas as far as Canada, Mexico, and Israel.\n\nIn 1957, he established the Kiryat Sanz neighborhood in the beachside city of Netanya, Israel. Over the next few years, he raised money for the establishment of girls' and boys' schools and yeshivas, an orphanage, an old-age home, and a hospital to serve this community. He moved to Kiryat Sanz in 1960. In 1968, he founded yet another Sanz community in Union City, New Jersey, and afterwards divided his time between that community and his residence in Netanya.\n\nHalberstam died on June 18, 1994, and was buried in Netanya. In his will, he divided leadership of the Klausenburger Hasidim between his two sons (both born in his second marriage after World War II). His elder son, Zvi Elimelech Halberstam, became the Sanz-Klausenburger Rebbe (also called Sanzer Rebbe) of Netanya, and Shmuel Dovid Halberstam became the Sanz-Klausenburger Rebbe of Brooklyn.\n\n\nThe Rebbe's sons-in-law are:\n\nIn contrast to the custom among many Rebbes, the Klausenburger Rebbe did not take sons-in-law exclusively from rabbinic families; rather, he chose the best students of his yeshiva to marry his daughters. The only exception was Rabbi Shlomo Goldman, an accomplished Torah scholar even in his youth, who is the son of the previous Zhviller Rebbe in Israel.\n\nOther figures in Sanz-Klausenburg are:\n\n"}
{"id": "1859275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859275", "title": "Petroform", "text": "Petroform\n\nPetroforms, also known as boulder outlines or boulder mosaics, are human-made shapes and patterns made by lining up large rocks on the open ground, often on quite level areas. Petroforms in North America were originally made by various Native American and First Nation tribes, who used various terms to describe them. Petroforms can also include a rock cairn or inukshuk, an upright monolith slab, a medicine wheel, a fire pit, a desert kite, sculpted boulders, or simply rocks lined up or stacked for various reasons. Old World petroforms include the Carnac stones and many other megalithic monuments.\n\nPetroforms are shapes and geometrical patterns made from arranging large rocks and boulders, often over large areas of open ground, unlike the smaller petroglyphs and graphs which are inscribed on rock surfaces. They were originally made in North America by native peoples for astronomical, religious, sacred, healing, mnemonic devices, and teaching purposes. The specific names of these rock formations and the uses varied by political and religious group. Presently, some of these sites are still being used by First Nations, elders, and others.\n\nThe first stone phase at Stonehenge has been dated to about 2600 BCE. Stone circles are still being made in Wales as part of the Eisteddfod movement, which incorporates this among other elements from the Druidic revival. Desert kites were used possibly by 3000 BCE; they fell out of use in the Neolithic as prey populations declined and the human population rose.\n\nSome of the North American petroform shapes are over 2,500 years old. It is difficult to date all of them accurately because of a lack of soil deposits in some areas. Like the petroglyphs, many petroforms have complex and lengthy teachings that have been passed down orally by the Ojibway, other First Nations, and the Midewiwin. Some teachings may have been lost, along with the peoples that originally made some of the oldest petroforms in North America. In some North American states and provinces, there are laws to protect these important archaeological and historical sites. There were very few studies or specific mention of Manitoba petroform sites until the 20th century. The first detailed studies and descriptions of some sites in Manitoba were done by J. Steinbring and R. Sutton after the 1950s.\n\nPresently, many Ojibway or Anishinaabe ceremonies in North America involve the making of turtle shaped fire pits for sacred fires. In some instances, rocks are aligned near the entrance and fire of sweat lodge ceremonies that symbolize the Moon, the Sun and other things. Rock piles are still made to mark trails and important locations. A large turtle petroform of piled up boulders was recently made in the Whiteshell Park area of Manitoba.\n\nIn some cases, petroforms were made by non-literate cultures who have left no written record of whatever reasons led them to construct these forms. Oral history was passed along by many native groups, and a few groups had very complex symbolic writings on rock, petroglyphs, birch bark scrolls, and other media.\n\nSome petroforms were used as astronomical calendars, with rocks aligned to solstice and equinox sunrises and sunsets. They are often found in higher areas, on hills, mounds, ridges, and natural rock formations. Higher ground allowed humans to carefully observe the horizon to mark and measure astronomical events. Some rock alignments point out four or more directions, lunar events, the rising and setting of planets, some stars, and other astronomical events. Some petroforms can also be used in more complex ways for astronomical predictions, mapping of the sky and ground, and for complex ceremonies that help to memorize many oral stories and songs. Petroforms are similar in some ways to medicine wheels which are also aligned with sunrises and sunsets, equinoxes, solstices, lunar events, and star patterns. Petroforms also mirrored the night sky, and the patterns of the stars, similar to astrological signs and symbols. The Sioux have oral stories of the serpent in the sky, a turtle, a bear, and other patterns seen in the stars. What is often known today as Orion's belt was one prominent, bright star formation, along with the central and stationary north star, now named as Polaris. What is now known as the planet Venus is the very bright morning and evening star that is very noticeable and at times is the first and last to appear. Petroform sites in North America can be found in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Wyoming, Montana, along the Mississippi River, the Missouri River, and elsewhere. It has been suggested that megalithic monuments including Stonehenge may have incorporated important astronomical alignments.\n\nThe desert kites of Syria, Jordan, and the Negev—long lines of stones—are interpreted as aids to hunting large game animals like gazelles, ibexes, wild asses. There are similar structures on most continents.\n\nThe inuksuit of the Arctic act as navigation aids, an aid for hunting, or to mark important locations. The rock marker helped the traveler or hunter to find the best route across the land. Someone left a marker to help anyone else passing through the area, and to help with not getting lost. These markers can have very practical and universal purposes. Some petroforms are located along portage routes and canoe routes as well. Human made markers can be easier to remember than common natural features of the landscape. Rock ridges would have been natural trails through dense forest or wet terrain. Whiteshell Provincial Park petroforms are located on top of the granite ridges that snake through the forest and wetlands landscape.\n\nThe Dolmens widespread in Europe and much of Asia are interpreted as Neolithic burial chambers. Large boulders make excellent long term markers for important and sacred places, just as burial plots are marked by large stones today. Some petroforms could be close to ancient burial areas, or near sacred areas associated with the dead. Large rocks are a universal marker that can last for generations. Boulders will last for tens of thousands of years. In memory of a person or the history about a place, these markers help future generations to learn about the past. These markers help to provide long term memories and reminders of a time long ago.\n\nIndigenous peoples have an oral tradition of story telling. Many of these rock shapes are used to memorize and to help tell stories and legends. Some petroforms go in the order of the story, helping one to memorize the successive steps. Large rocks are very permanent, thereby helping to pass along certain memories, knowledge, and wisdom. Some large boulders in North America have long stories that relate to the area and a memory about that place. A large boulder, sitting alone, catches the eye as a major landmark. Many petroforms in Whiteshell Provincial Park have long stories associated with each one.\n\nAboriginal groups also made shapes of humans, snakes, turtles, fish, bears, cougars, thunderbirds, medicine wheels, circles, rectangles, and other complex geometric shapes that are still intact today. There was certainly an attempt to leave their mark upon the landscape, and large boulders or rocks are very permanent markers. The Nazca Lines include many animal and other shapes. Petroforms in North America are often related to earthen mounds. Mounds were sometimes built over the older petroforms, or later made near them. Petroforms also marked out the area for various ceremonies, sweatlodges, fasting, and sacred fires. They often mark an important or sacred area, or point to an important place. Offerings and prayers are made in these areas, along with initiations and vision quests. The exact, original purposes of the Carnac stones, Stonehenge, and many other megalithic monuments are lost.\n\nOne of the locations of petroform sites, including effigies, is in Southeastern Manitoba, in Whiteshell Provincial Park, Canada. Whiteshell Park is named after the white cowrie shells used by some Anishinaabe peoples in ceremonies. The natural landscape of the park, with many movable rocks and boulders left behind after the last ice age, gave humans the easy opportunity to arrange them into many human-made patterns. It is an area where three rivers meet, along the edge of the Canadian Shield, close to the edge of prairie grasslands. The rivers were ancient highways and trade routes, bringing humans from far and wide to the area. Some large boulders appear to be carved, chipped, or altered to look like turtle heads and other animals. A very wide variety of petroform shapes are found in the park, including snakes, turtles, geometric lines, patterns, and large circles. Most of the known petroforms are found on the top of granite ridges. The granite ridges and hills are often very flat in areas, resembling a large concrete parking lot. These open areas have a very smooth granite left behind from the last ice age. In some areas there is no soil, no lichen, and the surface is polished to a shine. The large boulders aligned are in striking contrast to the flat granite beneath them. Local First Nations have teachers and elders that pass along the stories associated with some of these petroforms. Many of the sites and their past use is a mystery, with no certain answers. Some elders refer to one site as extremely sacred and important, and few people should venture there. The Midewiwin have oral teachings about some of the petroforms, but no one group claims to know all the history of the area.\n\nThe petroform sites in Wisconsin are being studied more closely, and can be dated more easily because of soil deposits over centuries. Many other sites have no layers of soil deposited around the petroforms. Forested areas and soil cover have partially protected many of the petroforms in Wisconsin and Minnesota. In many areas across the prairies, large circular medicine wheels were made as astronomical devices, directional maps, and for ceremonial use. Some of these medicine wheels are large, and many were destroyed for agricultural needs by clearing the grasslands of any rocks. Some are intact, such as in the Turtle Mountains, and other sandy, rocky, or more remote areas that had less crop farms and settlements. Mound building was also associated in some way with petroform use. Petroforms originally predated the use of mounds and other human-made earthen works that required more time and effort. Although mound building could have originally been necessary and practical to provide some higher ground during floods. There is some speculation that larger mounds would have served as dikes and defensive fortifications, including providing higher ground to keep watch.\n\n\n\n"}

He reigned as the head of the House of Mecklenburg. His princely seat was located in Schwerin beginning in the 1350s.\n\nAlbert was born in Schwerin as the second (but eldest surviving) son of Lord Henry II of Mecklenburg (c. 1266–1329), Lord of Stargard (Stari Gard), of the old Vendic princely clan of the Obotrites, and his second wife Princess Anna of Saxe-Wittenberg (d. 1327), of the princely Ascanian House.\n\nDuke Albert succeeded his father as reigning Prince (or Lord) of Mecklenburg in 1329. He was also keenly interested in obtaining influence in Scandinavia, e.g. fiefs or income. The Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund elevated Mecklenburg to the status of a Duchy on 1 July 1347, through which Albert (together with his younger brother John) became the first Duke of Mecklenburg.\n\nOn 10 April 1336, Albert married a kinswoman, the Scandinavian heiress Euphemia of Sweden and Norway. Her father was Eric of Sweden, Duke of Södermanland and Halland, her mother was Princess Ingeborg of Norway, the heiress and the only legitimate daughter of King Haakon V of Norway. Through this marriage, Albert gained standing in Sweden by means of his wife's hereditary estates and ancestral connections. These enabled him to participate in the internal politics of Scandinavia. Albert acquired the nickname \"The Fox of Mecklenburg\" from the Swedes to evoke his scheming and avarice.\n\nAlbert arranged for his eldest son, the future Henry III of Mecklenburg, to marry Ingeborg, the eldest daughter and potential heiress of King Valdemar IV of Denmark. Prince Henry married her some time around 1362, and their infant son was soon offered unsuccessfully as heir to the kingdom of Denmark in competition with Waldemar's youngest daughter, Queen Margaret of Norway, the future ruler of the Kalmar Union.\n\nAlbert's brother-in-law King Magnus IV of Sweden faced grave difficulties beginning in the 1350s. Influential nobles attempted to curb the concentration of royal power in Sweden and set up Magnus' own elder son Eric as a rival king. After young Eric's death, Albert's second son and namesake Albert became the next puppet claimant of the noble party in Sweden.\n\nDuke Albert was deeply involved in trying to make his son king in Sweden, but with himself as the real power behind the throne. The younger Albert deposed his uncle Magnus IV from the Swedish throne and ascended as King Albert of Sweden.\n\nAlready in Albert and Euphemia's lifetime it was recognized that her genealogical position would become a pivotal point for any future claims to the Scandinavian thrones.\n\nWhen his first wife died, Duke Albert married a second time to Countess Adelheid of Hohenstein, daughter of Count Ulrich of Hohenstein. That marriage apparently was childless.\n\nDuke Albert had five surviving children born from his marriage with Euphemia: sons Henry, Albert and Magnus and daughters Ingeborg and Anna.\n"}

It was a response to a letter that Paul wrote to the Christian settlement he had founded in Greece. \n\nPaul wrote his first letter to the Corinthians in 50 AD. The text of this letter was later lost and is unknown to present-day scholars. The Corinthians responded in a series of questions. This writing claims to describe the teachings of Simon Magus, including the ideas that God was not almighty, that the resurrection was false, that Christ was not truly bodily incarnated God (i.e. Docetism), that angels made the world (see Demiurge), and that the prophets were inaccurate. A response to this letter from Paul also appears in the Acts of Paul and is known as the Third Epistle to the Corinthians.

Grown for its scented purple flowers in spring, this large shrub or small tree is widely cultivated and has been naturalized in parts of Europe and North America. It is not regarded as an aggressive species, found in the wild in widely scattered sites, usually in the vicinity of past or present human habitations.\n\n\"Syringa vulgaris\" is a large deciduous shrub or multistemmed small tree, growing to high. It produces secondary shoots (suckers) from the base or roots, with stem diameters up to , which in the course of decades may produce a small clonal thicket. The bark is grey to grey-brown, smooth on young stems, longitudinally furrowed, and flaking on older stems. The leaves are simple, and 3–8 cm broad, light green to glaucous, oval to cordate, with pinnate leaf venation, a mucronate apex, and an entire margin. They are arranged in opposite pairs or occasionally in whorls of three. The flowers have a tubular base to the corolla 6–10 mm long with an open four-lobed apex 5–8 mm across, usually lilac to mauve, occasionally white. They are arranged in dense, terminal panicles long. The fruit is a dry, smooth, brown capsule, 1–2 cm long, splitting in two to release the two-winged seeds.\n\n\"Syringa vulgaris\" was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 and the description was published in \"Species Plantarum\". The Latin specific epithet \"vulgaris\" means \"common\" (in the sense of \"widespread\"}.\n\nLilacs—both \"S. vulgaris\" and \"S.\" × \"persica\" the finer, smaller \"Persian lilac\", now considered a natural hybrid—were introduced into northern European gardens at the end of the 16th century, from Ottoman gardens, not through botanists exploring the Balkan habitats of \"S. vulgaris\". The Holy Roman Emperor's ambassador, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, is generally credited with supplying lilac slips to Carolus Clusius, about 1562. Well-connected botanists, such as the great herbalist John Gerard, soon had the rarity in their gardens: Gerard noted that he had lilacs growing \"in very great plenty\" in 1597, but lilacs were not mentioned by Shakespeare, and John Loudon was of the opinion that the Persian lilac had been introduced into English gardens by John Tradescant the elder. Tradescant's Continental source for information on the lilac, and perhaps ultimately for the plants, was Pietro Andrea Mattioli, as one can tell from a unique copy of Tradescant's plant list in his Lambeth garden, an adjunct of his \"Musaeum Tradescantianum\"; it was printed, though probably not published, in 1634: it lists \"Lilac Matthioli\". That Tradescant's \"lilac of Mattioli's\" was a white one is shown by Elias Ashmole's manuscript list, \"Trees found in Mrs Tredescants Ground when it came into my possession\" (1662): \"Syringa alba\".\n\nIn the American colonies, lilacs were introduced in the 18th century. Peter Collinson, F.R.S., wrote to the Pennsylvania gardener and botanist John Bartram, proposing to send him some, and remarked that John Custis of Virginia had a fine \"collection\", which Ann Leighton interpreted as signifying common and Persian lilacs, in both purple and white, \"the entire range of lilacs possible\" at the time.\n\nThe lilac is a very popular ornamental plant in gardens and parks, because of its attractive, sweet-smelling flowers, which appear in early summer just before many of the roses and other summer flowers come into bloom.\n\nIn late summer, lilacs can be attacked by powdery mildew, specifically \"Erysiphe syringae\", one of the Erysiphaceae. No fall color is seen and the seed clusters have no aesthetic appeal.\n\nCommon lilac tends to flower profusely in alternate years, a habit that can be improved by deadheading the flower clusters after the color has faded and before seeds, few of which are fertile, form. At the same time, twiggy growth on shoots that have flowered more than once or twice can be cut to a strong, outward-growing side shoot.\n\nIt is widely naturalised in western and northern Europe. In a sign of its complete naturalization in North America, it has been selected as the state flower of the state of New Hampshire, because it \"is symbolic of that hardy character of the men and women of the Granite State\". Additional hardiness for Canadian gardens was bred for in a series of \"S. vulgaris\" hybrids by Isabella Preston, who introduced many of the later-blooming varieties. Their later-developing flower buds are better protected from late spring frosts. The \"Syringa \"×\" prestoniae\" hybrids range primarily in the pink and lavender shades.\n\nMost garden plants of \"S. vulgaris\" are cultivars, the majority of which do not exceed tall. Between 1876 and 1927, the nurseryman Victor Lemoine of Nancy, France introduced over 153 named cultivars, many of which are considered classics and still in commerce today. Lemoine's \"French lilacs\" extended the limited color range to include deeper, more saturated hues, and they also introduced double-flowered \"sports\", with the stamens replaced by extra petals.\n\nIn the UK these cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: \n"}
{"id": "1859325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859325", "title": "Demetrius of Pharos", "text": "Demetrius of Pharos\n\nDemetrius of Pharos (also Pharus) () was a ruler of Pharos involved in the First Illyrian War, after which he ruled a portion of the Illyrian Adriatic coast on behalf of the Romans, as a client king.\n\nDemetrius was a regent ruler to Pinnes, the son of Agron who was too young to rule as king. When the Romans were occupied with their own problems, he had grown stronger as an ally of Macedonia and also by conquering Dimallum. Together with Scerdilaidas, he sailed south of Lissus and broke the Roman treaty, attacking Roman allies in the Adriatic and by devastating and plundering many cities in the Cyclades and the Peloponnese. He was expelled from Illyria by Rome after the Second Illyrian War and became a trusted counselor at the court of Philip V of Macedon. He became a strong political influence to Philip V and encouraged him to clash with Rome. Demetrius remained there until his death at Messene in 214 BC while attempting to take the city.\n\nDemetrius, described as Illyrian or Greek, was from the Greek colony on the island of Pharos (modern Hvar, founded in 385 BC, in Croatia), in the Adriatic Sea off the coast of Dalmatia. Under the Illyrian king Agron, he ruled Pharos, from his stronghold (Stari Grad), overlooking a sheltered harbor. After Agron's death in 230 BC, Demetrius continued as ruler of Pharos under the regency of Queen Teuta, Agron's second wife and stepmother of Agron's son Pinnes, who was too young to rule.\nIn 229 BC, continuing the expansion of Illyrian power that Agron had begun, Teuta systematically attacked Issa, the polis of Korkyra and Epidamnus. Lissus, Apollonia and Corcyra Nigra were all threatened. In a naval battle off the island of Paxos the Illyrian fleet, arguably commanded by Demetrius, defeated the allied Achaeans and Aetolians. As a result, the Korkyreans were forced to accept an Illyrian garrison in their city which was put under the command of Demetrius.\n\nWhen the Romans were on their way to relieve Corcyra during the First Illyrian War, Demetrius felt that he was slandered by Teuta. Fearing her wrath, he betrayed her and gave up Corcyra to the Romans. Going over to the Roman side, he now acted as their guide for their campaign in Illyria. With Demetrius’ help Rome achieved a quick victory, Teuta fled to Rhizon in Dalmatia (modern Risan, Montenegro), and Demetrius was placed in charge of most of the rest of Ardiaean Kingdom, as a client of Rome. Demetrius was rewarded with the rule of his birthplace, the island of Pharos, and a part of the land next to it, but this was only temporary. The Romans annexed the southern conquests of Teuta and following the war, due to one of the conditions imposed by Rome, Illyrian warships south of Lissus were expressly prohibited.\n\nThe decade after 229 BC witnessed a revival of Illyrian power under Demetrius who succeeded Teuta. Following the war, Demetrius married Triteuta in or around 222 BC, Agron's first wife and mother of Pinnes which consolidated his position. His marriage to Triteuta mean that Demetrius formally took over the regency of the Ardiaean Kingdom. Demetrius' own influence was thereby greatly extended, and the fundamental weakness of the Ardiaean Kingdom after 229 BC, that there was no competent regent for Pinnes was relieved. The king began to renew traditional Illyrian ties with Macedonia. In 222 BC an Illyrian corps of 1600 men under the command of Demetrius fought with distinction at the Battle of Sellasia, where the Macedonians won a conclusive victory over the Spartans. After Sellasia, Demetrius began attempting to extend his control over Illyria at the expense of Rome.\n\nBefore 222 BC Rome was preoccupied with a war against the Celtic peoples of the Po (225-222 BC), Demetrius detached the Illyrian Atintani from their Roman alliance. In addition, he sailed south of Lezhë and engaged in piracy in contravention of the settlement in 228 BC. In 221 BC Demetrius also created an alliance with the Illyrian Histri at the head of the Adriatic, who were interfering with Roman supply ships. A Roman fleet soon attacked the Histri. Early in the summer of 221 BC, when tension was rising in Greece as Macedonia made an alliance with the Achaean League against the Aetolian League, the Illyrians attacked in their traditional manner.\n\nIn 220 BC Demetrius and the Illyrian commander, Scerdilaidas sailed south of Lissus with ninety lembi. After an assault on Pylos in the western Peloponnese had failed they separated their forces, with Demetrius taking his chances in plundering the Cyclades while Scerdilaidas returned north. On putting in at Naupactus with forty ships Scerdilaidas was encouraged by his brother-in-law Amynas, king of the Athamanes, to join the Aetolians in their planned invasion of Achaea. With help from Cynaethan traitors, they attacked, seized and burned Cynaetha, a town in the north of Arcadia, located on the northern slope of the Aroanian Mountains. They also attacked but failed to take Cleitor. Meanwhile, Demetrius continued on into the Aegean with 50 ships. He sailed to the Cyclades, where he extorted tribute from some of the islands and plundered the others. Chased by Rhodian warships, Demetrius put into Cenchreae, the Aegean port of Corinth. At the same time the Macedonian commander in Corinth, Taurion, learned of Scerdilaidas' and the Aetolians' invasion. Taking his cue from the Aetolians, Taurion agreed to drag Demetrius' ships across the Isthmus to bring them into play in the Gulf of Corinth, in return for Demetrius' assistance against the Aetolians. Although Demetrius conducted a few raids on the Aetolian coast, he was too late to hinder the Aetolians' return from Achaea.\n\nAfter returning to the Ardiaean Kingdom, Demetrius continued operations during the following winter, attacking and seizing Roman allied cities and communities in southern Illyria. The Romans who hitherto ignored the activities of their former ally, decided that the harbors on the coast of the Ardiaean Kingdom had now to be made secure, in view of the threat of another war with Carthage. These events precipitated the Second Illyrian War.\n\nUnlike Teuta in 229 BC, Demetrius was well prepared for the Roman invasion. He first placed a garrison in Dimallum, an Illyrian city-fortress from Apollonia. He eliminated his opponents in other places, those Illyrians who opposed his rule, and stationed 6,000 of his best forces on his home island Pharos. As before, both consuls of the year accompanied the Roman expedition, but the leading role was given to Aemilius Paullus, who was to be killed in the great Roman disaster at Cannae three years later. The Adriatic took on particular importance in Rome's preparations for the Second Punic War which was to last from 218 to 201 BC. Anticipating a long and difficult war far away from Rome, the Roman Senate decided first to set matters right in Illyria.\n\nIn 219 BC, having decided that Dimallum was crucial to Demetrius' power in the region, the consul prepared to besiege the city but was able to take it by direct assault within seven days. As a result, all the Illyrian towns and cities of the area submitted to Roman protection, each receiving the appropriate terms and conditions. Next, the Romans moved against Demetrius on the island of Pharos, who awaited the attack with good troops, ample provisions and war materials behind strong fortifications, that of the city of Issa (modern Vis). In order to avoid a long siege, Aemilius decided to risk another frontal attack. The Roman army moved from the mainland to a wooded area of the island. The next day, a small force of ships was sent out to tempt Demetrius from behind his fortifications. Demetrius marched down to the harbor to oppose the Roman landing. The strategy worked, and when the main Roman army appeared from another direction on the island, the Illyrian army was forced to give battle cut off from their city. Attacked on two sides, and cut off from the protection of the city walls, the battle was lost. In 218 BC, the Illyrian forces soon surrendered while Demetrius deserted the island and fled to Macedonia, making his way to the court of Philip V of Macedon, who was now the Macedonian king following the death of Antigonus.\n\nThe Romans destroyed the fortifications of Pharos and before the summer was over Aemilius was back in Rome receiving congratulations for a job well done. Any threat to the Roman holdings in Illyria had been eliminated, all the gains of the First Illyrian War had been secured, and the old restrictions of movement reimposed on the Illyrian kings. Demetrius may have returned to the Ardeaian State and have been attacked by another Roman force, although the regime of Pinnes, now confirmed as king, was left intact. Rome supported a small Ardeaian State ruled by Pinnes and his successors. The Roman republic called for the extradition of Demetrius, but Phillip refused. Pinnes was ordered to pay the arrears of tribute and reparations imposed after the war.\n\nThe weak Ardaeai State soon fell prey to Macedonia while the partial destruction brought onto the scene the urban koina of the Parthini, Byllines, Amanatini and others.\n\nDemetrius was received warmly by the young king whose father was also called Demetrius, becoming one of Philip's most trusted advisors. According to Polybius, Demetrius was instrumental in turning Philip's ambitions toward Illyria and Rome. In 217 BC when Philip learned of the victory of Hannibal, the Carthaginian general, over the Romans, at Lake Trasimene, Philip at first showed the letter only to Demetrius. Perhaps seeing a chance to recover his possessions in Illyria and exact a measure of revenge on Rome, Demetrius immediately advised the young king to make peace with the Aetolians, with whom Philip was at war, and turn his attentions westward. In summarising the strategy needed for the situation, Polybius states that Demetrius said:\n\nPhilip was easily convinced and followed Demetrius' advice. Evidence of Demetrius' influence can be seen in the treaty of alliance between Philip and Hannibal of 215 BC. One of its articles specified that any peace made with Rome would include as terms that the Romans would relinquish control of Corcyra, Apollonia, Epidamnus, Pharos, Dimale, Parthini, and Atintania and to restore to Demetrius of Pharos all those of his territories now in the dominion of Rome. In 217 BC Philip made war against Scerdilaidas, to recover some territory recently lost and to expand his control westward. Polybius gives as Philip's (and Demetrius') motives that:\n\nSuch \"dreams\" eventually led to war with Rome, the First Macedonian War, and then the Second Macedonian War.\n\nPolybius also blamed Demetrius' influence for Philip's tyrannical behavior. One incident involved Philip's apparent role in a massacre carried out by the people against their leaders that occurred at Messene in 215 BC. Arriving on the scene the day after the massacre and wanting to seize the acropolis, Philip asked his advisors whether the entrails of a sacrifice which had been made indicated that he should quit the citadel or hold it. Demetrius responded by saying: if you have the heart of an augur, quit it as quick as you can, but as a gallant and wise king, keep it, lest if you quit it now you may never have so good an opportunity again, for it is by thus holding the two horns that you can alone keep the ox under your control.\n\nHowever, in this instance Philip took the more moderate advice of Aratus of Sicyon, who advised him to leave. Nevertheless, the incident at Messene marked, the beginning of Philip's deterioration of character, as well as his loss of popularity. Comparing Demetrius to Aratus, Polybius says that the life of Aratus sufficiently proved that he would not have committed such an act of wickedness, but that such principles exactly suited Demetrius of Pharos. The moderating influence of Aratus had caused the Greeks to regard Philip with favour, owing to the greatness of character which he displays, while under Demetrius' guidance, Philip lost the goodwill of the allies and his credit with the rest of Greece\n\nDemetrius was killed the following year attempting to take Messene. After having rejected Demetrius' advice the previous year, Philip had returned in 214 BC, resolved to follow it.\n\n\n\n"}

They play their home matches at The Grange, Edinburgh, and also some other venues.\n\nScotland became Associate Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1994 after severing links with the England cricket team two years earlier. Since then, they have played in three Cricket World Cups (1999, 2007 and 2015) and three ICC World Twenty20 tournaments (2007, 2009 and 2016). However, their first win in either of these events did not come until they beat Hong Kong in the 2016 World Twenty20. Scottish cricket team is governed by Cricket Scotland.\n\nScotland have also played in every ICC Intercontinental Cup tournament, winning the inaugural edition in 2004. Between 2010 and 2013, the team competed in the ECB 40 as the Scottish Saltires.\n\nKyle Coetzer became captain of the side in November 2016 after Preston Mommsen who had captained the side since September 2014 stepped down. The coach is South African Shane Burger, who took on the role in January 2019.\n\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Scotland and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 are a full T20I.\n\nThe first recorded cricket match in Scotland took place in Alloa in 1785. It would be another eighty years, however, before Scotland played their first full match, against Surrey in 1865, which they won by 172 runs.\n\nThe first Scottish Cricket Union was formed in 1879, and the national team beat Australia by 7 wickets three years later. The cricket union became defunct in 1883, and Grange Cricket Club took over the administration of the game until 1909. The first match against Ireland took place in Dublin in 1888, with Ireland winning. They also played South Africa, West Indies, an all-Indian team, and New Zealand before the start of World War II.\n\n1948 saw Australia visit Scotland for two games at the end of their tour of England. These games, both of which were won by the Australians, were to be the last international games for Don Bradman. The Don signed off in typical style, making a fine unbeaten 123 in the innings victory.\n\nScotland first competed in English domestic cricket in 1980, when they competed in the Benson & Hedges Cup for the first time. Three years later they took part in the NatWest Trophy. Their first Benson & Hedges win came against Lancashire in 1986.\n\nThe most famous cricketers to have come from Scotland are probably the former England captain, Mike Denness, Warwickshire all-rounder Dougie Brown, and former England Test player Gavin Hamilton. Another great Scottish cricketer was Brian Hardie, who was a major contributor to the successful Essex side of the 1970s and 1980s. Possibly one of the best spinners and certainly a respected journalist was the aptly named Ian Peebles, who was one of the cricketers of the year in 1931 alongside Don Bradman.\n\nThe most infamous cricketer, a man who was vilified in Australia, was a Scot, Douglas Jardine, father to and inventor of \"Body Theory\", which is well documented under \"Bodyline\". Jardine was born in British India, and died in Switzerland, spending most of his life in England. However, his parents were Scottish. He asked for his ashes to be scattered in Scotland and gave his own children Scottish names.\n\nIn 1992 Scotland severed their ties with the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) and England, and gained Associate Membership of the ICC in their own right in 1994. They competed in the ICC Trophy for the first time in 1997, finishing third and qualifying for the 1999 World Cup, where they lost all their games. The 2001 ICC Trophy saw them finish 4th, losing a play-off game to Canada, but they won the 2005 tournament, beating long-time rivals Ireland in the final. 2004 saw Scotland first confirm themselves as one of the leading associate nations by winning the inaugural Intercontinental Cup. However, they did not progress beyond the first round in the 2005 tournament.\n\nMarch 2006 saw Scotland embark on a pre-season tour to Barbados. They performed with some credit, although they only won one of their 6 games, against a Barbados XI. They owed much of their success to Dougie Brown, who re-qualified to represent Scotland internationally in 2004. They competed in the C & G Trophy in English domestic cricket in the early part of the 2006 English cricket season. They performed better than expected, winning three of their nine games, and finishing eighth in the Northern conference.\n\nIn June, they played their first ODI since the 1999 World Cup when they took on Pakistan in Edinburgh. Without key players Dougie Brown and Navdeep Poonia, they lost by five wickets. They finally got their first ODI win in the European Championships in August with a win over Holland in a rain-shortened game. They again missed key players for some games in this tournament though, and thanks to their loss against Ireland, finished second in the tournament.\n\nDuring 2006 and early 2007, Scotland participated in the third edition of the Intercontinental Cup. They beat Namibia by an innings in May 2006, but draws against Ireland in August and the United Arab Emirates in January 2007 meant that they failed to reach the final. In December 2006, they travelled to Test nation Bangladesh for a two-match ODI series – their first outside the UK – but lost both matches heavily.\n\nIn January 2007, after the Intercontinental Cup match against United Arab Emirates in Sharjah, they travelled to Kenya, first playing in a tri-series against Canada and Kenya in Mombasa, which they finished second in. This was followed by Division One of the World Cricket League in Nairobi, where Scotland finished as runners up.\n\nThey then travelled to West Indies for their second World Cup. They again lost all their games and failed to progress beyond the first round. Back in the UK, they competed in the Friends Provident Trophy, their only win coming against Lancashire. They also drew an Intercontinental Cup match against United Arab Emirates and an ODI against Pakistan in July was washed out.\n\nIn July, Scotland took part in a quadrangular series in Ireland against the hosts, Holland and West Indies. However, the endeavour was not a success. They lost their matches against Ireland and West Indies with the match against Holland being abandoned due to rain.\n\nAt the beginning of August, Scotland were on Intercontinental Cup duty as they won against Holland by an innings and 59 runs. They then drew with Ireland in a rain affected match, only gaining 3 points however after a poor 1st innings display. India were Scotland's next ODI opponents in mid-August, which was shown live on BBC Scotland from Titwood, Glasgow. The match was reduced slightly to 46 overs after a couple of brief showers, but India won by 7 wickets.\n\nHaving reached the final of the World Cricket League earlier in the year, Scotland qualified to play in the Twenty20 World Championship held in South Africa. They lost by 51 runs to Pakistan in their first game, and did not get a chance to play their other Group D opponents India, as the game was washed out without a ball being bowled.\n\nIn July 2008, Scotland played a tri-series against New Zealand and Ireland in Aberdeen, Scotland. Scotland beat Ireland but lost their match against New Zealand.\n\nIn early August, Scotland participated with five other Associate nations in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in Belfast. Despite an initial loss to hosts Ireland, victory against Bermuda secured a semi final slot. Throwing off the disappointment of an unexpected loss to Holland in the semi-final a few hours earlier, Scotland bounced right back for a 9 wicket victory over Kenya (who had advanced ahead of Canada), to secure third place. However, with only two nations guaranteed to progress, qualification for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 was only granted when Zimbabwe confirmed that they would not attend the tournament.\n\nOn 18 August, Scotland played their first ODI encounter against England. Hosting the Auld Enemy, at the Grange Cricket Club in Edinburgh. However the match was abandoned due to rain after less than 3 overs of England's reply to Scotland's 156/9.\n\nIn December 2008, Cricket Scotland, the governing body of Scottish cricket, took the historic act of giving three Scotland players central contracts. Bowlers Gordon Goudie and Dewald Nel and captain Ryan Watson became the first full-time professional cricketers based in Scotland. Nineteen other cricketers have been offered part-time professional deals.\n\nScotland participated in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England in June 2009. They were drawn alongside Test nations New Zealand and South Africa in Group D, with both matches being played at The Oval in London.\n\nThe first match, against New Zealand, was shortened to 7 overs per side due to rain. Scotland batted first and made 89/4, with Kyle Coetzer top-scoring with 33. However, three no-balls and a dropped catch enabled New Zealand to win by seven wickets with an over to spare.\n\nIn the second match, South Africa made 211/5, with AB de Villiers hitting 79 not out off only 34 balls. In response, Scotland were bowled out for 81, more than half of which was scored by Coetzer (42). The 130-run margin of defeat was the second-largest in terms of runs in a Twenty20 International.\n\nIn 2010, Scotland took part in the inaugural ECB 40 tournament.\n\nScotland competed in the qualifiers in the United Arab Emirates, to compete for a place in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 in the West Indies. They competed for a place with Afghanistan, Canada, Ireland, Kenya, Holland, United Arab Emirates and USA. The tournament was disappointing for Scotland, going out in the group stage without winning a single match.\n\nScotland's Intercontinental Cup campaign was more successful as they reached the final in December – against Afghanistan – at the bespoke new cricket stadium in Dubai. Scheduled as a four-day first-class match of two innings each side, Afghanistan won the game in eight sessions. This was also the first cricket match of any kind that was live-streamed online – by two Scottish fans, with the agreement of the ICC.\n\nDuring March and April 2009 Scotland attempted to defend the ICC Trophy they won in 2005. To secure qualification for the 2011 Cricket World Cup a top four place was targeted. They were also attempting to secure ODI status by finishing in the top six.\n\nScotland started the tournament badly by losing three of their five group games. With only the points earned against Namibia being taken through to the Super Eights, Scotland faced a difficult route to the World Cup.\n\nScotland started the Super Eights well by beating Holland in their first match. Defeats against Kenya and Afghanistan followed. The result of which threatened Scotland's qualification for the World Cup as well as the possibility of losing their ODI status if they finished out of the top six.\n\nVictory against United Arab Emirates in their last game, and an improved run-rate, thanks to the 122 run victory, ensured a top six place for the Scots, securing ODI status until the next round of World Cup qualifiers.\n\nThe Scottish team qualified for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 in Australia and New Zealand, but was eliminated after six straight losses out of six matches.\n\nIn August 2014, Scotland played a three match series against New Zealand A at Cambusdoon New Ground, Ayr. In the first match Grant Elliott and captain BJ Watling scored centuries and ensured that New Zealand A won by 199 runs. Scotland conceded nearly 150 runs in the last ten overs.\n\nIn January 2017 Scotland took part in the 2017 Desert T20 Challenge. They won all three of their group fixtures, before losing to Ireland in the semi-finals.\n\nScotland achieved their first victory against a full member of the ICC when it defeated a touring Zimbabwe side.\n\nScotland achieved their second victory against a full member of the ICC when it defeated a touring England side.\n\n‡ Only the matches between Scotland, Ireland and Netherlands in the 2006 tournament have official ODI status.\n\nThis lists all the active players who have played for the Scotland in the past year (since 2 January 2019) and the forms in which they have played, or any players (in italics) outside this criteria who have been selected in the team's most recent squad.\n\nKey\n\n\nThe following people have coached the Scottish national side at various stages.

{"id": "1859402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859402", "title": "Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones", "text": "Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones\n\nPrince of Persia: The Two Thrones is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Ubisoft Montreal. It was released in December, 2005 in North America for the Xbox, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and the Nintendo GameCube. It was ported to the PlayStation Portable and Wii, under the title Prince of Persia: Rival Swords with the Wii version utilizing the motion-sensing functionality of its controller, while the PSP version added exclusive content. A remastered, high-definition version of \"The Two Thrones\" was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on December 21, 2010.\n\n\"The Two Thrones\" marked the third and final chapter for \"The Sands of Time\" saga, until the release of prequel \"The Forgotten Sands\".\n\nThe game combines exploration and combat. Both elements make use of the Prince's acrobatic capability and agility. Throughout much of the game, the player must attempt to traverse the palace by running across walls, ascending or descending chasms by jumping back and forth between walls, avoiding traps, climbing structures and jumping from platform to platform, making other types of well-timed leaps, solving puzzles and using discovered objects to progress.\n\nDuring combat, many of the same moves vital to the player in other situations can be put to use to overpower enemies. An example is the ability of the Prince to jump off walls in order to strike enemies decisively. The player generally attacks enemies and blocks using a dagger, although other objects or factors, such as the Dagger of Time and its time-control abilities eventually prove to be critical to victory.\n\nIn \"The Two Thrones\", the Prince's acrobatic skills have improved and is now able to launch himself off walls at 45 degree angles at strategically placed vertical shutters, slide down chutes and balance on swinging poles, among other things. The designers have also improved the stealth system. Instead of merely being able to do more damage when striking without being seen, the game uses a speed-kill system. If the player does not complete the speed kill, the enemy knocks him off and the speed kill fails. The number of moves or the length of time required depends on how strong the opponents are. The same system is also used in some of the boss battles.\n\nThe Prince also develops a split personality, known as the Dark Prince, and this alter ego constantly bickers with him in his mind about right and wrong. At times, the Prince physically transforms into the Dark Prince. These transformations are scripted and not controlled by the player. During these times, however, the Prince retains control of his body, and the player still has control over the character. For the most part, the Prince's dark side is simply an inner voice.\n\nWhen controlling the Dark Prince, the player loses the ability to wield a secondary weapon, instead using the \"Daggertail\", a bladed whip fused to his arm. This allows medium range combat moves and new interactions with the environment. The Dark Prince also constantly loses health as a result of the semi-transformation, with eventual death from the loss. He goes back to full health whenever he collects Sand, from either a monster or object. Also, his Daggertail gives him a different button combination for speed kills, in which he strangles his victims. Coming into contact with water allows the Prince to return to normal\n\nThe game is set after the events of \"\", in which the Prince kills the Dahaka, saves Kaileena and prevents the Sands of Time from being created. Unlike the previous games, the story is narrated by Kaileena. The Prince's actions alter the timeline of events that took place before that point. In the original timeline, the Vizier and Maharajah traveled to the Island of Time and found an hourglass filled with the Sands of Time. In the modified timeline, they find the hourglass empty. Since the Vizier never released the Sands of Time and fought the Prince, he is still alive at the beginning of this game. Farah, who helped the Prince during the events for \"Sands of Time\", has never met the Prince.\n\nAs The Prince and Kaileena return to the city of Babylon, they find it being ravaged by war. Their ship is attacked and destroyed, and he and Kaileena wash ashore. The Prince awakens and watches as enemy soldiers take Kaileena away. The Prince fights his way into the palace and confronts the Vizier, who kills Kaileena with the Dagger of Time, unleashing the Sands again. The Vizier then impales himself with it and makes himself immortal. The Prince is also affected, having a whip-like weapon known as a Daggertail embedded in his skin when the Sands infect the wound. However, in the confusion following the release of the Sands, the Vizier throws the Dagger aside and the Prince manages to steal it before the Sands infected him completely.\n\nThe Prince falls into the sewers and gets carried to the outskirts of Babylon. As he travels through the city once again to kill the Vizier, he finds that the infection caused by the Sands of Time is affecting his mind, giving rise to an alter ego called the Dark Prince (voiced by Rick Miller), manifested by a voice within. The Dark Prince is cold, cruel, arrogant and sarcastic; he attempts to convince the Prince that he should strive to serve only himself, using his vengeance as a catalyst for his other emotions. On many occasions, the Dark Prince seizes control of the Prince's body and the Prince is fully transformed into a hybrid sand monster with abilities that allow the Prince to pass otherwise insurmountable obstacles.\n\nLater, the Prince encounters Farah (voiced by Helen King), who is surprised that the Prince knows her name. Despite this, the pair begin to grow an entirely new romance together. The Prince eventually starts to ignore the Dark Prince, and begins to fight against the suffering of his people, which the Dark Prince had always spoken against.\n\nIn the palace gardens, the Vizier captures Farah and casts the Prince into an ancient well, where the long silent Dark Prince emerges once again and tries to take permanent control. The Prince desperately tries to resist the power, driving slowly deeper into the well looking for an escape, but he slowly weakens. At the bottom of the well, the Prince stumbles upon the dead body of his father Sharaman. He mourns for him, accepting the consequences of what he has done and wields his father's sword to resist the Dark Prince's power.\n\nAt the top of the Tower of Babel, the Prince confronts and kills The Vizier with the Dagger of Time. The Sands are released from the Vizier and his soldiers who die slowly. Seeing this the people of Babylon rejoice. The Sands take the shape of Kaileena who cleanses the Prince's infection and destroys the Dagger of Time. She tells that this world wasn't meant for her but there will be other worlds for her where she will find her place. She tells the Prince that he's free and his journey is at an end and disappears. As the Prince finds Sharaman's crown, the Dark Prince takes it and tells him that whatever the Prince owns will be rightfully be his and lures the Prince into his mind, where the two struggle until the Prince abandons his shadow. The game ends with Farah asking how the Prince knows her name and the Prince beginning to tell \n\nBy the end of December 2005, sales of \"The Two Thrones\" had surpassed 1.5 million copies. The game received a \"Gold\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe game and \"Rival Swords\" have received positive to mixed reviews. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 86.45% and 85 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 86.35% and 85 out of 100 for the Xbox version; 85.25% and 84 out of 100 for the GameCube version; 82.81% and 85 out of 100 for the PC version; 82.40% for the mobile version; 71.22% and 70 out of 100 for the Wii version; and 70.44% and 74 out of 100 for the PSP version.\n\nIGN gave the PC version 9 out of 10, saying, \"Two Thrones is great. The story is cool, the heroes are likable, the weak are pitiable, the villains are bastards, the major plot points are exciting, the art is grand, the sound is wonderful...and then the gameplay comes.\" GameSpy gave it four stars on all platforms except the PSP and Wii versions, saying of the PC version, \"All of [the] settings, without exception, are stunning. As might be expected, the sharper, more detailed graphics for the PC version of the game are the clear winner when compared with the consoles, especially at higher resolutions.\" GameSpot gave the PC version 8.4 out of 10.\n\nNon video-game publications gave the game some positive reviews. \"The A.V. Club\" gave the game an A− and stated: \"The nice thing about sequels to successful games is that all the rough edges are buffed out, and \"The Two Thrones\" honors its graceful hero with impeccable controls and design.\" \"Maxim\" gave it a score of eight out of ten and said that the game \"gets points for cribbing Sam Fisher's stealth skills and using a whip-like weapon that will send \"God of War\" fans scurrying to gaming chat rooms to voice their displeasure with the similarities. Thankfully, the controversy is worth it for this energetic adventure.\" \"The Times\" gave it a favorable review and said, \"The graphics are superb, especially on the Xbox, and if you can cope with the frustration of replaying tricky scenes again and again, this could be the game for you.\" \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" also gave it four stars out of five and stated that \"One of the best new features is the Speed Kill, a stealth attack that requires timed button presses for successful take-downs - a brilliant addition to the already exhilarating game play.\" \"Detroit Free Press\" gave the PS2 version three stars out of four and said, \"The fighting in \"The Two Thrones\" is superb. The prince has a nice array of combination moves that accompany his acrobatic skills. But the signature part of combat is the speed kill, which allows you some nifty and gruesome stealth kills.\" However, Charles Herold of \"The New York Times\" gave it an average review and stated that \"I felt all the considerable pleasure the game had given me had been taken back.\"\n"}
{"id": "1859407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859407", "title": "Lilium candidum", "text": "Lilium candidum\n\nLilium candidum, the Madonna lily, is a plant in the true lily family. It is native to the Balkans and Middle East, and naturalized in other parts of Europe, including France, Italy, and Ukraine, and in North Africa, the Canary Islands, Mexico, and other regions. It has been cultivated since antiquity, for at least 3,000 years, and has great symbolic value since then for many cultures. It is susceptible to several virus diseases common to lilies, and especially to \"Botrytis\" fungus. One technique to avoid problems with viruses is to grow plants from seed instead of bulblets.\n\nIt forms bulbs at ground level, and, unlike other lilies, grows a basal rosette of leaves during winter, which die the following summer. A leafy floral stem, which generally grows tall, but exceptionally tall, emerges in late spring and bears several sweetly and very fragrant flowers in summer. The flowers are pure white and tinted yellow in their throats.\n\nIt is commonly known as the Madonna lily. \n\nMadonna lilies are depicted in the fresco titled \"Prince of the Lilies\" in the ruins of the ancient Minoan palace of Knossos.\n\nSome translations of the Bible identify the Hebrew word \"Shoshannah\" as \"lily\" in the \"Song of Songs\": \"As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.\" (\"Song of Songs\", 2:2 (KJV)) Customarily it is translated as \"rose\". For example, Abraham ibn Ezra described it as a white flower, which has a good fragrance, and has a six petaled flower and six stamens. But its identity is uncertain, because it typically grows in montane places and not in valleys as the phrase \"the lily of the valleys\" would have it. \n\nThe Bible describes King Solomon's Temple as adorned with designs of Madonna lilies on the columns, and on the brazen Sea (Laver).\n\nThe lily symbolizes purity for Roman Catholics. Medieval depictions of the Blessed Virgin Mary, especially at the Annunciation, often show her with these flowers in her hands or nearby. Additionally, Saint Joseph is frequently depicted with them to stress the Catholic belief in his chaste marriage with Mary, whom the Church teaches was always a virgin.\n\nThe French adopted the symbol of the fleur de lis, which is can be described as a stylized Madonna lily, however the shape of this symbol more accurately resembles that of a flag iris or \"Iris florentina\". The lily appears on ancient coins from Yehud Medinata, as well as on medieval banners from Syria in the time of Saladin. The first time it appears in a Western context is in a stone carving decorating the refectory of the Hospitaller compound at Akko, possibly indicating the link to its adoption by the House of Valois-Anjou.\n\nCats are extremely sensitive to the toxicity of the plant and ingestion is often fatal; households and gardens which are visited by cats are strongly advised against keeping this plant or placing dried flowers where a cat may brush against them and become dusted with pollen which they then consume while cleaning. Suspected cases require urgent veterinary attention. Rapid treatment with activated charcoal and/or induced vomiting can reduce the amount of toxin absorbed (this is time-sensitive so in some cases vets may advise doing it at home), and large amounts of fluid by IV can reduce damage to kidneys to increase the chances of survival.\n"}

The dish originates from the Jiangxi province of southern China, and is a specialty of Ningdu. The dish has become especially popular in Taiwan, being introduced to the island by the Hakka people.\n\nThere are several versions for the origins of sanbeiji. These stories often involve a cook who placed three cups of sauces into an earthenware pot and simmered it for a long time. One version is that of Wen Tianxiang, a national hero and Jiangxi native during the Song dynasty. Wen was captured by the invading Yuan armies of Kublai Khan and tortured for four years during his imprisonment. It was during this time that a sympathetic prison warden cooked the dish for him (using these limited resources) before Wen Tianxiang's execution.\n\nThe dish derives its name from the three cups of sauces required. For each chicken, a cup each of soy sauce, rice wine (usually \"mijiu\" although it may be mixed with \"Shaoxing jiu\"), and sesame oil are added. Lin Shangquan, a famous chef in Taiwan, believes that the traditional recipe called for a cup each of soy sauce, sesame oil, and sugar, with added ginger, garlic, and basil.\n\nThe chicken, together with the sauces, is cooked in an earthenware pot on high heat for ten minutes, then on low heat to allow the sauces to be absorbed by the meat. \"Sanbeiji\" is served with no sauce; the dish is cooked until all the sauce evaporates and is absorbed by the chicken. When it is served at the table, the chicken should be sizzling—even popping—on the cusp of burning. This gives the chicken a crisper texture (and richer flavor) unlike most other Chinese or Taiwanese stewed dishes. The dish is then eaten with either steamed rice or rice congee.\n\nOther meats, such as pork or frog, can be substituted for chicken in this dish without detracting from the taste.\n\n"}

Empyrium are often referred to as a dark folk or apocalyptic folk band, expressing in their music sentiments akin to those expressed by some other 'legislators' of the genre, Forseti, Orplid, and Ulver (Kveldssanger). Like the Norwegian black metal band Burzum, Empyrium also used Theodor Kittelsen's drawing on one of their album covers (\"Where at Night the Wood Grouse Plays\").\n\nTheir first two albums, \"A Wintersunset\" and \"Songs of Moors and Misty Fields\", following a demo entitled \"...Der wie ein Blitz vom Himmel fiel...\", considered doom metal (or folk metal) with folk and symphonic influences. They combine harsh and operatic male vocals, with deep slow guitar parts and atmospheric sounds.\n\nThe following two albums, \"Where at Night the Wood Grouse Plays\" and \"Weiland\" are acoustic, display a constantly heavier neofolk influence. Instead of keyboards, the band switched to acoustic instruments such as acoustic guitars, violins, cellos and the flute. Operatic male vocals are still used, and in \"Weiland\" the band uses choir vocals and the piano. Though the music remains dark and melancholic, Empyrium's music has largely moved away from heavy metal. Many people consider these two albums to be the apex of Empyrium's skill and some accomplishment of the band's - or rather Schwadorf's goal.\n\nAfter their 2002 album, \"Weiland\", the band decided to stop recording. As Schwadorf himself put it, \n\"Empyrium has explored nature-mystics since 1994, and after 8 years we feel to move on and made a glorious farewell to the concept with \"Weiland\"\"\nIn August 2006, Empyrium's label, Prophecy Productions, announced publicly for the first time that a new album was going to be released in late November the same year. Called \"A Retrospective\", it is a look back on the history of the band. Aside from ten remastered tracks from their previous albums, it contains a re-recorded version of \"The Franconian Woods In Winter's Silence\" from the album \"A Wintersunset\", as well as two new tracks in the neofolk style of late Empyrium (\"Der Weiher\" and \"Am Wolkenstieg\"). The sixty-page booklet provides an extensive account of the musical influences of the band, and how Empyrium has changed over the years.\nThe album leaked onto the Internet in early November 2006.\n\nOn September 17, 2010, Prophecy Productions and Schwadorf personally announced that the band had reunited and revealed plans to release a new album soon, beside contributing to the label's upcoming v/a compilation \"Whom The Moon A Nightsong Sings\".\n\nWe are incredibly happy to announce that Empyrium, the most renowned Prophecy act ever, has decided to reunite and to record new music! Here's the official statement of Schwadorf on the reunion: \"Since the rumours start to spread we think it's about time to make this official: Empyrium is alive again! Our first new sign of life will be the song 'The Days Before The Fall' on the Prophecy Prod. compilation 'Whom The Moon A Nightsong Sings' but we have plans for more! The spirit is back and it really feels right to us to start writing songs with Empyrium again. We are not in a rush though so don't expect a full length today or tomorrow but we have the patience and faith to make this new songs outstanding and unique. Just as Empyrium ever was...\"\nQuote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Congregation for the Clergy handles requests for dispensation from active priestly ministry, as well as the legislation governing presbyteral councils and other organisations of priests around the world. The Congregation does not deal with clerical sexual abuse cases, as those are handled exclusively by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\n\nIt was first set up as the by Pope Pius IV in the apostolic constitution \"Alias Nos\" of 2 August 1564 to oversee the proper application and observation of the disciplinary decrees of the Council of Trent throughout the Catholic Church. It was commonly known as the Sacred Congregation of the Council. Pope Sixtus V's Apostolic Constitution \"Immensa aeterni Dei\" of 22 January 1587 expanded the Congregation's functions, entrusting it with the proper interpretation of the canons of the Council of Trent, resolving controversial questions relating to it, and monitoring provincial councils. It later lost many of its powers, retaining only those relating to disciplining secular clergy, but still held onto its original name prior to Pope Paul VI's apostolic constitution \"Regimini Ecclesiae Universae\" of 31 December 1967, which renamed it the \"Congregation for the Clergy.\"\n\nBy 2009, Pope Benedict XVI made the Congregation responsible for managing the guidelines concerning clergy who maintained their clerical status after violating their vows of celibacy. On 25 January 2012, Pope Benedict XVI gave it responsibility for regulating Catholic seminaries, which until then was the responsibility of the Congregation for Catholic Education.\n\nIn January 2013, the \"motu proprio\" \"Fides per doctrinam\" transferred the competency on Catechesis from the Congregation for the Clergy to the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation.\n\nIn February 2019, Cardinal Beniamino Stella, Prefect of the Congregation, said that the Congregation manages the cases of priests who violate their vows of celibacy for approximately ten years. He said that \"In such cases there are, unfortunately, Bishops and Superiors who think that, after having provided economically for the children, or after having transferred the priest, the cleric could continue to exercise the ministry.\" In February 2020, the Congregation made public its guidelines for managing cases of priests who have fathered children. The guidelines were previously secret, though in 2019 the Congregation offered to provide then to a bishops conference upon request.\n\nSince 21 September 2013, the Prefect of the Congregation has been Cardinal Beniamino Stella. The Secretary of the Congregation is the French Archbishop Joël Mercier. Jorge Carlos Patrón Wong is the Secretary for Seminaries. Fr. Andrea Ripa, a former professor of matrimonial and canon law for the Higher Institute of Religious Sciences in Rimini and of the “General Norms” at the Lugano Faculty of Theology and the Pontifical Lateran University and licensed canon law and Roman Rota a lawyer, and a former judge and vicar of the Ecclesiastical Tribunal of Flaminio in Bologna, serves as the Under-Secretary.\n\n\n\n"}

Situated off Water Sound at the head of a calm bay on the island's northern coast, it is connected to the Orkney Mainland by the A961 road running across the Churchill Barriers.\n\nSt Margaret's Hope is believed to have been named after either Margaret, Maid of Norway, who died in Orkney and possibly in this location in 1290, or Saint Margaret of Scotland (c.1045-1093), the wife of Malcolm III.\n\nThe village has a primary school, a small blacksmith's museum, several shops and cafes, and one restaurant.

{"id": "1859446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859446", "title": "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)", "text": "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a science fiction comedy radio series written by Douglas Adams (with some material in the first series provided by John Lloyd). It was originally broadcast in the United Kingdom by BBC Radio 4 in 1978, and afterwards the BBC World Service, National Public Radio in the US and CBC Radio in Canada. The series was the first radio comedy programme to be produced in stereo, and was innovative in its use of music and sound effects, winning a number of awards.\n\nThe series follows the adventures of hapless Englishman Arthur Dent and his friend Ford Prefect, an alien who writes for \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", a pan-galactic encyclopaedia and travel guide. After Earth is destroyed in the first episode, Arthur and Ford find themselves aboard a stolen spaceship piloted by Zaphod Beeblebrox (Ford's semi-cousin and Galactic President), depressed robot Marvin, and Trillian, the only other human survivor of Earth's destruction.\n\nA pilot programme was commissioned in March 1977, and was recorded by the end of the following June. A second series was commissioned in 1979, transmitted in 1980. Episodes of the first series were re-recorded for release on LP records and audio cassettes and Adams adapted the first series into a best-selling novel in 1979. After the 1980 transmissions of the second radio series, a second novel was published and the first series was adapted for television. This was followed by three further novels, a computer game, and various other media.\n\nAdams considered writing a third radio series to be based on his novel \"Life, the Universe and Everything\" in 1993, but the project did not begin until after his death in 2001. Dirk Maggs, with whom Adams had discussed the new series, directed and co-produced the radio adaptation as well as adaptations of the remaining \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" novels \"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\" and \"Mostly Harmless\". These became the third, fourth and fifth radio series, transmitted in 2004 and 2005. A sixth series, adapting Eoin Colfer's sixth part in the \"trilogy\", \"And Another Thing...\" was broadcast in March 2018.\n\nDouglas Adams had contributed comedy sketches for BBC radio programmes produced by Simon Brett (including \"The Burkiss Way\" and \"Week Ending\"), and was asked to pitch a radio sitcom in February 1977. Adams initially pitched a \"bedsit comedy\" because that \"seemed to be what most situation comedies tended to be about.\" Adams said in an interview that when Brett proposed a radio science fiction comedy series, he \"fell off his chair...because it was what I'd been fighting for all these years\". Adams wrote his first outlines in February 1977.\n\nOriginally to be called \"The Ends of the Earth,\" each episode would have ended with the planet Earth meeting its demise in a different way. While writing the first episode, Adams realised that he needed a character who knew what was going to happen to Earth before the other characters. He made this character an alien and, remembering an idea he supposedly had had while lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria in 1971, decided that this character would be a \"roving reporter\" for \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" a pan-galactic encyclopaedia and travel guide. Recollections by his friends at the time indicate that Adams first spoke of the idea of \"hitchhiking around the galaxy\" while on holiday in Greece in 1973.\n\nAs the first episode's writing progressed, the \"Guide\" became the central focus of his story, and Adams decided to base the whole series around it, with the initial destruction of Earth being the only holdover from the \"Ends of the Earth\" proposal. In Adams' February 1977 outline, the character of Arthur Dent was called \"Aleric B\", the joke being that the audience initially assume the character is also an alien rather than a human. Adams renamed the character for the pilot to \"Arthur Dent\". Adams' biographer M. J. Simpson suggested that the character was almost certainly named after the 17th century puritan writer Arthur Dent, author of \"The Plain Man's Pathway to Heaven\" first published in 1601, although Adams himself claimed no recollection of consciously choosing the name.\n\nA pilot episode was commissioned on 1 March 1977 and the recording was completed on 28 June 1977. Brett and Adams recounted different parts of the pilot episode's genesis, including convincing the BBC that such a programme could not be recorded with a studio audience, and insisting that the programme be recorded in stereo sound. To win the latter argument, \"Hitchhiker's\" was briefly classified internally as a drama instead of a comedy, as in 1977 BBC Radio Drama programmes were allowed to be recorded in stereo, whereas BBC Radio Comedy programmes were not.\n\nA full series of six episodes (five new episodes, plus the pilot) was commissioned on 31 August 1977. However, Adams had in the meantime sent a copy of the \"Hitchhiker's\" pilot episode to the BBC's \"Doctor Who\" production office, and was commissioned to write a four-part \"Doctor Who\" serial (\"The Pirate Planet\") a few weeks later. In addition, Brett had left the BBC, and the final five episodes in the first series were produced by Geoffrey Perkins.\n\nWith conflicting writing commitments, Adams engaged his friend and flatmate John Lloyd to assist in writing the fifth and sixth episodes. The second episode was produced in November 1977. The script of the last episode of the first series (later retitled \"The Primary Phase\") was completed in February 1978, and production (including sound mixing and effects) was completed on 3 March 1978.\n\nAdams wrote the main parts of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect with actors Simon Jones and Geoffrey McGivern in mind. According to Jones, Adams telephoned him when he was writing the pilot to ask whether he would essentially play himself; Adams later stated that although Dent was not a portrayal of Jones, he wrote the part to play to Jones's strengths as an actor.\n\nThe radio series (and the LP and TV versions) featured narration by comedy actor Peter Jones as \"The Book\". He was cast after a three-month search for an actor with sonorous, avuncular tones who sounded like Jones, after which the producers hired Jones himself. Following another actor dropping out of the production, Bill Wallis was called in at short notice to play two parts, Mr Prosser and Vogon Jeltz. One character appearing in the pilot who was dropped from subsequent incarnations of the story was Lady Cynthia, an aristocrat who helps demolish Dent's house, played by another ex-Cambridge Footlights actress, Jo Kendall.\n\nThe pilot featured only a small cast of characters, and following its commission into a series there was a need for additional characters. Many were picked for their roles in previous series; Mark Wing-Davey had played a character in \"The Glittering Prizes\" \"who took advantage of people and was very trendy\", making him suitable for the role of Zaphod, according to Adams. Richard Vernon, noted for his portrayal of \"grandfatherly types\", was chosen as Slartibartfast. Other characters included Susan Sheridan as Trillian and Stephen Moore as Marvin.\n\nEarthman Arthur Dent learns his house is about to be demolished to make way for a new road. His friend Ford Prefect informs him that the planet is about to be demolished by a Vogon constructor fleet \"to make way for a hyperspace bypass\", and that Ford is in fact an alien writer for \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", a pan-galactic encyclopaedia and travel guide. Hitching a ride aboard the Vogon ship which has just destroyed Earth, the pair find themselves aboard a stolen spaceship, \"The Heart of Gold\". On board is Ford's semi-cousin and President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox; a woman Dent met at a party, Trisha \"Trillian\" McMillan; and a depressed robot, Marvin. Beeblebrox is searching for the mythical planet of Magrathea, where Arthur meets Slartibartfast and learns the answer to the \"Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything\", which it turns out is \"42\". Dent and the others find themselves at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, then held captive aboard a Golgafrincham ship about to crash-land on prehistoric Earth.\n\nIn series two, Zaphod, wanted for stealing the \"Heart of Gold\" among other misdemeanours, attempts to contact the editor of \"The Guide\" while escaping mercenaries from Frogstar, \"the most totally evil place in the Galaxy\". Arthur and Ford are rescued after being stranded on prehistoric Earth for years and reunited aboard the \"Heart of Gold\", where they are pursued by Vogons. Finding themselves on the planet of Brontitall, populated by a race of bird people, they hear about the rudest word in the universe and the Shoe Event Horizon. Escaping using a 900-year-old spaceship, the three find themselves in the offices of the \"Guide\" editor, Zarniwoop, and we discover that it was Zaphod who accidentally signed off the Earth for destruction.\n\nOne of Adams's stated goals was to be experimental in the use of sound. Being a fan of Pink Floyd and the Beatles, and especially the experimental concept albums both bands produced in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Adams wanted the programme to have the feel of a \"rock album ... to convey the idea that you actually were on a spaceship or an alien planet—that sense of a huge aural landscape\".\n\nThe first series was therefore the first BBC radio comedy to use stereophonic techniques. Adams later said that before \"Hitchhiker's\", stereo was deemed impossible for radio comedy and after it was made compulsory. Producer Geoffrey Perkins recalled that the technology available in 1978 for mixing sound effects at the BBC's Paris Theatre radio studio was limited. The production had one eight track tape recorder at their disposal and so many of the effects in the programme were mixed \"live\" with tape loops of background sound effects strung around the recording studio. Actors whose speech needed to be modified in post-production by radiophonic technicians, such as Stephen Moore's performance as Marvin the Android, were recorded in isolation from the main \"humanoid\" characters. Moore recorded most of his performance in a cupboard and met the other actors only after the first session was complete.\n\nSound and effects were created by Paddy Kingsland, Dick Mills and Harry Parker of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Several of the sound effects recorded by Dick Mills for the first series were released on the album \"BBC Sound Effects No. 26 – Sci-Fi Sound Effects\". Other BBC staff members who worked on the first two radio series included Alick Hale-Munro (chief sound engineer) and Anne Ling (production secretary) and the \"Technical Team\" is given as: Paul Hawdon, Lisa Braun (studio manager), Colin Duff (studio manager), Eric Young, Martha Knight, Max Alcock and John Whitehall.\n\nThe first radio series (first six episodes) was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in March and April 1978. A seventh episode was broadcast on 24 December 1978. This seventh episode was commonly known as the Christmas Episode. This had nothing to do with Christmas except in an early draft (which would have had Marvin the Paranoid Android as the \"star\" that was followed by the Three Wise Men); it was called the Christmas Episode because it was first broadcast on Christmas Eve.\n\nProduction on the second series was delayed several times. While Adams was meant to be working on scripts for a stage adaptation of \"Hitchhiker's\" in April 1979, he was also employed as Script Editor for \"Doctor Who\" and turned down an offer from John Lloyd to submit material for \"Not the Nine O'Clock News\". The recording on the first day scheduled for the second radio series, 19 May 1979, was left incomplete because Adams had not yet finished the script. Further scheduled recordings on 11 July and 1 August of that year were also cancelled, this time due in part to Adams trying to work on the LP re-recordings of the first series, as well as its novelisation.\n\nFurther recording attempts were made on 23 October and 3 December. The recording of the final episode in the second series was completed on 13 January 1980: the audio mixing of the episode was not finished until 25 January, the day it was transmitted. The tape \"arrived just a few minutes before transmission\". The final five episodes, completing the second radio series, were broadcast in January 1980.\n\nThe theme tune used for the radio series (and all subsequent adaptations) is \"Journey of the Sorcerer\", an instrumental piece composed by Bernie Leadon and recorded by the Eagles on their album \"One of These Nights\". Adams chose this song for its futuristic-sounding nature, but also for the fact that it had a banjo in it, which, as Geoffrey Perkins recalls, Adams said would give it an \"on the road, hitch-hiking feel\".\n\nAdams also wanted to incorporate music from a variety of pop, rock and classical artists. Series one (\"The Primary Phase\") included an eclectic range of modern classical, experimental rock and electronic music. \"\" lists works including \"A Modern Mass for the Dead\" (Requiem) by György Ligeti, \"A Rainbow in Curved Air\" by Terry Riley, \"Volumina\" by György Ligeti, \"Wind on Water\" by Robert Fripp and Brian Eno, \"Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band\" by Terry Riley, \"Cachaca\" by Patrick Moraz, \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" (intro) by Pink Floyd, \"Rock and Roll Music\" by The Beatles, \"Also sprach Zarathustra\" (intro) by Richard Strauss, \"Katakomben\" by Gruppe Between, \"Space Theme\" by Stomu Yamashta, \"Oxygène\" by Jean Michel Jarre, \"That's Entertainment\" by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz, \"Over Fire Island\" by Eno (with Fripp), \"Miracles of the Gods\" by Absolute Elsewhere, \"Mikrophoniet\" by Karlheinz Stockhausen, \"Melodien\" by György Ligeti, \"The Engulfed Cathedral\" by Isao Tomita, \"Volkstanz\" by Gruppe Between and \"What a Wonderful World\" by Louis Armstrong.\n\nThis diverse range of music was only featured during the first series due to the difficulty in obtaining rights for commercial releases (leading to episodes of the first series being remade as an LP album without the proprietary background music in 1979). For series two Paddy Kingsland was commissioned to provide background music and for the third to fifth series Paul 'Wix' Wickens was chosen.\n\nThe series was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 10.30pm on Wednesday 8 March 1978. Simon Jones recalled that Adams was initially disappointed at the scheduling as the timeslot was allegedly guaranteed to turn a programme into a \"cult\" (i.e. a small but dedicated listenership). As it happened, the programme gained listeners through the lack of any competition elsewhere on television or radio, but primarily through word of mouth; several Sunday newspapers included reviews and it was mentioned in Radio 4's \"Pick of the Week\". As a result of its exposure through these reviews, the BBC received numerous requests for a repeat from people who had missed the initial episodes. A repeat of the series was broadcast on 23 April, only two weeks after the last episode had aired.\n\nIn the end, the complete first series was rebroadcast twice by the BBC in 1978 and once in 1979, as well as on the BBC World Service. The complete second series was rebroadcast once in 1980, and the complete original run of 12 episodes was broadcast twice over a twelve-week period, once from April to June 1981 and the second time from the end of March to the start of June 1983.\n\nBroadcasting by National Public Radio in the United States followed in March 1981 with a repeat broadcast in September. This was one of their first transmissions in stereo. The following year, 1982, the series was carried by CBC Radio (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation). A German radio version of the first six radio episodes, \"Per Anhalter ins All\" was transmitted in 1981 and the twelve original radio episodes have been translated and transmitted in Finland, France, The Netherlands and Sweden.\n\nAll of the episodes, including those completed after Adams's death, are referred to as \"Fits\" after Lewis Carroll's \"The Hunting of the Snark: an Agony in Eight Fits\". In 1981, upon a rebroadcast of the twelve episodes of the first two series, it was decided that the Christmas episode, which previously had no episode number, would be called \"Fit the Seventh\" and the episodes in the second series, which had first been billed as Fit the First to Fit the Fifth (representing five parts of the second series) would become Fit the Eighth to Fit the Twelfth.\n\nThe first series was noted for its unusual concept, out-of-context parodies, \"semantic and philosophical jokes\", compressed prose and \"groundbreaking deployment of sound effects and voice techniques\".\n\nThe programme was a hit with listeners, although a BBC World Service listener in India allegedly \"strongly objected to 'Robots taking part in a comedy show'\" and another in Sierra Leone thought that \"as a source of information it is misleading\". One listener complained to the \"Radio Times\" that \"In just about 50 years of radio and latterly TV listening and watching, this strikes me as the most fatuous, inane, childish, pointless, codswallopping drivel...It is not even remotely funny\".\n\nBBC Radio 3's \"Critics Forum\" thought the show had \"the sort of effect that a \"Monty Python\" programme actually has, of making everything that appears immediately after it on radio or television or whatever, seem absolutely ludicrous\". By the time the sixth episode was broadcast, the show had become a cult hit.\n\nThe success of the series encouraged Adams to adapt it into a novel, which was based on the first four Fits and released in the second week of October 1979. While the second radio series was being recorded in 1979, Adams was commissioned to deliver a pilot script for a television adaptation, which, after a number of delays, was delivered by 1981. The storyline set out by the initial radio series has since appeared in numerous formats including a 1984 video game and a 2005 feature film.\n\nThe original series was the recipient of a number of awards including the Imperial Tobacco Award (1978), The Sony Award (1979), The Society of Authors/Pye Awards Best Programme for Young People (1980) and the Mark Time Awards 'Grand Master Award' (Adams) and 'Hall of Fame' (1998). It was the only radio show ever to be nominated for the Hugo science fiction awards, in 1979, in the 'Best Dramatic Presentation' category.\nAs a result of the series, Douglas Adams was inducted into the Radio Academy's Hall of Fame.\n\nIn November 2003, two years after Adams's death and 23 years after the production on the Secondary Phase had ceased, a new radio adaptation of Adams' unadapted novel \"Life, the Universe and Everything\" was announced. This would become the third series of the \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" on radio. Dirk Maggs, a friend of Adams, was chosen to create, direct and co-produce the adaptations. Maggs had previously consulted with Adams on potential radio adaptations for the final three books in 1993 and 1997. The project was restarted in September 2001 by Maggs, Helen Chattwell and Bruce Hyman, with help from Jane Belson and Ed Victor.\n\nAt the time of the announcement, it was stated that the original goal was to transmit the six-part adaptation of the third novel starting in February 2004, with the remaining eight episodes comprising the final two novels. A fourth and fifth series based on \"So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish\" and \"Mostly Harmless\" were to have been transmitted in September 2004.\n\nSoon after the six episodes comprising the third series had been recorded by Above the Title Productions, a minor legal dispute over the online availability of episodes arose between the production company and The Walt Disney Company, which had started production on the \"Hitchhiker's\" movie, also in 2003. This led to a delay in transmitting the third series and an immediate cessation in the production of series four and five. Eventually a deal was worked out, and the Tertiary Phase was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 21 September 2004.\n\nMaggs stated in the series' script book that he felt bound by his promise to Douglas Adams to allow the scripts of the Tertiary Phase to closely follow the plot of the third book; \"I myself was willing to give the Tertiary Phase 7 out of 10 on the grounds that I was a little too reverential to the text and the pace suffered as a result.\" But in adapting the final two novels, the only instructions Maggs got from Adams was \"They don't need more than four episodes each.\" Thus Maggs was able to use many of the major plot elements of the final two books (though not necessarily in the same order), and attempt to reconnect plot threads from all five radio series.\n\nThe new episodes reunited most of the living original cast. The parts of The Book, Eddie the Computer and Slartibartfast were recast to replace actors who had died, with William Franklyn, Roger Gregg and Richard Griffiths taking over these three roles, respectively. Peter Jones, the original narrator, had died in 2000; Richard Vernon, the original Slartibartfast, had died in 1997; and David Tate, who had voiced Eddie the Computer (among many other roles), had died in 1996.\n\nBill Wallis, who played Mr. Prosser and Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz in the original series, was unavailable, and Toby Longworth took the role of Jeltz in the new series. John Marsh, who had been the continuity announcer for Fits Two to Twelve, was rehired to reprise this role. There was also a posthumous cameo role by Adams as Agrajag, edited from his BBC audiobook recording of the novel.\n\nIn series 3, after the events of series 2 are revealed to be a hallucination, Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect find themselves again stuck on prehistoric Earth. After being rescued, they find themselves transported to Lord's Cricket Ground just before it is destroyed by 11 white robots. Slartibartfast teaches Dent how cricket is based on the history of the worst wars in the galaxy, and the pair travel to Krikkit in order to prevent another war. In the final part, Dent and Trillian meet the computer behind the Supernova Bomb and there is another attempt to find the Ultimate Question to Life, the Universe and Everything.\n\nIn the fourth series, Dent discovers that Earth has been recreated again and meets Fenchurch, the woman of his dreams. Meanwhile, a spaceship lands in Knightsbridge, God's Last Message to his Creation is discovered, and Marvin makes his last appearance. In the fifth series, a tenth planet in the solar system is discovered and Ford discovers that \"The Guide\" has become a much more sinister place to work. Arthur Dent discovers that he is a father and his new daughter, Random, flies to Earth to meet him. There are three potential endings to the series.\n\nThe third series ran on BBC Radio 4 from Tuesday 21 September to 26 October 2004, with repeats on the following Thursdays. The series was also streamed in RealPlayer and Windows Media formats (including versions in a 5.1 surround mix) were made available on Radio 4's website until the following Thursday. In another continuity nod, the term \"Fit\" is still used in place of \"episode\"; episodes of the third series were subtitled \"Fits the Thirteenth\" to \"Eighteenth\".\n\nThe six-part \"Tertiary Phase\" was broadcast in September and October 2004. The four-part \"Quandary Phase\" was broadcast in May 2005, and the four-part \"Quintessential Phase\" was broadcast immediately following, in May and June 2005. The names for these series were chosen because they sound \"less daunting, more memorable and are a bit easier to spell\" than the standard terms quaternary and quinary.\n\nA six episode series dubbed the \"Hexagonal Phase\" was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 beginning on 8 March 2018, exactly 40 years after the first series' initial broadcast in 1978, and concluding 12 April 2018. The series is based on the sixth novel \"And Another Thing...\" by Eoin Colfer and adapted by the director Dirk Maggs who included some dialogue and material based on unfinished ideas in Adams's papers. Dirk Maggs produced the series which features members of the original radio and television casts.\n\nThe first two series were first released on record (as broadcast radio in 1979), audio cassette (revised from radio) and CD in 1988, marking the tenth anniversary of the first broadcast of the first episode. These were the first programmes of any kind released on CD by the BBC Radio Collection. The two radio series were known simply as \"the first series\" and \"the second series\" until 1992 when the BBC made its first re-release in separate boxes as \"The Primary Phase\" and \"The Secondary Phase\". The episodes were released with those titles in 1993, and again in 1998, for the series' twentieth anniversary. In 2001, they became the first programmes of any kind re-released by the BBC Radio Collection in an MP3-CD format.\n\nA three-CD set of the Tertiary Phase was released in mid-October 2004, before the final episodes were broadcast. These CDs contain extended material, previously cut to make 27-minute episodes for radio. A two-CD set of the Quandary Phase was released at the end of May 2005, and a two-CD set of the Quintessential Phase was released at the end of June 2005. Both sets again include material that was originally cut for reasons of timing. The sixth series is scheduled for release on CD on 13 April 2018.\n\nA script book for the final fourteen episodes was released in July 2005. The book is entitled \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases.\" Dirk Maggs writes in his introduction that the \"book is a companion volume to \"\"...\"\n\nA box set entitled \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Complete Radio Series\" was released on 3 October 2005. It contains fifteen CDs, subdivided per radio series, and bonus material exclusive to the box set. BBC Audio released a DVD version of the \"Tertiary Phase\", featuring that series in 5.1 surround sound, in October 2006. Contrary to previous announcements, this was merely a DVD-Video disc with Dolby Digital sound and other features, rather than a DVD-Audio disc. While it had been stated that BBC Audio plans on also releasing the fourth and fifth radio series on DVD, no dates have been set.\n\nSpecial editions of the Primary and Secondary Phases were released in November 2008. These have, according to the BBC, been given \"a thorough clean-up and remaster\" by Dirk Maggs. This includes using the new Philip Pope signature tune, so the material can be released worldwide, which has required John Marsh to re-record his announcements so they could be mixed in. Cleaning up the recordings aims to reduce the hiss produced by the overdubbing in the original and also re-levelling the episodes to produce a greater clarity in the sound.\n\nAccording to the inlay which comes with the Special Edition, all previous CD editions of the Primary & Secondary Phases played back slightly fast due to capstan wear on the mastering tape machine, with the result that the audio was pitch-shifted up by half a semitone. That was corrected for the special editions and has the effect of making the episodes nearly a minute longer.\n\nA number of scenes from Fit the Third were cut from commercially released recordings of the radio series because they featured copyrighted music. For example, in one scene Marvin \"hums\" like Pink Floyd, using the opening to \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", then \"sings\" \"Rock and Roll Music\" by The Beatles, and finally the theme music from \"\", the opening \"Sunrise\" movement from Richard Strauss's \"Also sprach Zarathustra\". It would have been very cost prohibitive in the 1980s to get clearances to release a recording of Fit the Third with this music, though agreements were reached on most of the rest of the copyrighted music used during the first series. As a result, all commercial recordings of Fit the Third are about two minutes shorter than other episodes. Recordings of the original radio broadcasts still contain it.\n\nFor the CD and cassette releases of the Tertiary Phase in the United States, and all CD and cassette releases of the Quandary and Quintessential Phases, the instrumental title theme, \"Journey of the Sorcerer\", composed by Bernie Leadon and originally recorded by US rock band the Eagles, was re-interpreted by The Illegal Eagles, a tribute band, using an arrangement by Philip Pope. This was done for licensing reasons (though the original track was used for the original radio transmissions and the on-demand downloads). In a 2005 interview with Simon Jones, the use of this song was mentioned as a major cause for the delay in releasing recordings of the new series in the United States.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1859447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859447", "title": "Revolutionary Left Movement (Peru)", "text": "Revolutionary Left Movement (Peru)\n\nThe Revolutionary Left Movement (in Spanish: \"Movimiento de la Izquierda Revolucionaria\") was a Marxist group founded in Peru in 1962 by Luis de la Puente Uceda and his group \"APRA Rebelde\", a splinter group from the APRA which had rallied the government in the 1950s and 1960s. Inspired by the Cuban Revolution and close to a non-aligned position which opposed itself to the Communist Party of Peru, the Soviet Union and China, the group initiated guerrilla actions against the government in 1965. After its leader's death at the end of 1965, the MIR split into three different factions. One of them, the MIR-EM, merged with the Revolutionary Socialist Party (Marxist-Leninist) in 1982 to create the Movimiento Revolucionario Túpac Amaru (MRTA). The two others factions, MIR-VR and MIR-IV, joined the parliamentary left-wing coalition Izquierda Unida in the early 1980s.\n\nThe MIR was born out of a split with the APRA, a formerly leftist group which increasingly began to collaborate with the government in the 1950s-60s. Luis de la Puente Uceda's faction created the APRA Rebelde at the end of the 1950s, which became the MIR in 1962. The MIR was part of the \"New Left\", as was the group Vanguardia Revolucionaria, characterized by its criticisms against both the APRA and the Communist Party, and its independence towards China and the Soviet Union. Instead, it turned itself toward the contemporary Guevarist foco strategy.\n\nFollowing the 1963 election to the presidency of Fernando Belaunde Terry, and his failure to implement social reforms, the situation in the impoverished countryside became more critical. The first guerrilla movement, the ELN (National Liberation Army), appeared, but was quickly defeated by the military. 1964 was marked by the continuing failure of governmental reforms and clashes during land occupations by landless peasants, and the MIR launched its armed struggle the following year.\n\nLuis Felipe de La Puente Uceda divided the country into three zones of influence, with the intent of creating various \"focos.\" Manco Cápac in the North led by Gonzalo Fernández Gasca, Pachacutec in the South headed by Rubén Tupayachi Solórzano, and Túpac Amaru in the Center directed by Guillermo Lobatón.\n\nHowever, the MIR did not manage to find sufficient popular support, while the divisions between rival revolutionary groups, such as the ELN, the Revolutionary Left Front (Frente de Izquierda Revolucionaria) headed by Hugo Blanco or the MIR prevented any concerted action. Confined in the jungles, the MIR unsuccessfully battled against the military forces, assisted by the CIA who, according to former CIA official Victor Marchetti, created a \"miniature Fort Bragg\" in the jungle. The MIR leader Luis Felipe de la Puente Uceda died on October 23, 1965 in an armed confrontation. A few months later, the movement was all but annihilated.\n\nTwo years after Luis Felipe de la Puente Uceda's death in 1965, the MIR split into rival factions, including MIR El Militante (MIR-EM), MIR Voz Rebelde (MIR-VR) and MIR IV Etapa (MIR-IV), each claiming political orthodoxy.\n\nDuring the elections for a Constituent Assembly, the MIR-VR and the MIR-IV participated to the left-wing Unidad Democrática Popular (UDP) coalition, thus merging with the legalist left, and then to the Izquierda Unida coalition in the 1980s. On the other hand, the MIR-EM continued armed struggle, merging in 1982 with the Partido Socialista Revolucionario - Marxista Leninista (PSR-ML) to create the Movimiento Revolucionario Túpac Amaru (MRTA).\n\n\n"}

She was also the first wife of Pablo Picasso, one of his early artistic muses and the mother of his son, Paulo. \nOlga Khokhlova was born in the town of Nezhin, Chernigov Governorate, (Ukraine, then located in the Russian Empire). Her mother Lydia Zinchenko was of Ukrainian descent. Her father was a Russian officer. The Khokhlovs family had three sons and two daughters. Olga wanted to be a ballerina from the time she visited France and saw Madame Shroessont perform. She became a member of the Ballets Russes of Sergei Diaghilev.\n\nOn May 18, 1917, Olga danced in \"Parade\" – a ballet by Sergei Diaghilev, Erik Satie and Jean Cocteau – on its opening night at the Théâtre du Châtelet. Pablo Picasso had designed the costumes and set for the ballet. After meeting Picasso, Olga left the group, which toured South America, and stayed in Barcelona with him. He introduced her to his family. At first his mother was alarmed by the idea that her son should marry a foreigner, so he gave her a painting of Olga as a Spanish girl (\"Olga Khokhlova in Mantilla\"). Later Olga returned with Picasso to Paris, where they began to live together on the Rue La Boétie.\n\nOlga married Picasso on July 12, 1918, at the Russian Orthodox Cathedral at the Rue Daru. Jean Cocteau and Max Jacob were witnesses to the marriage. She was one of Picasso's first artistic muses.\n\nIn July 1919, Pablo and Olga went to London for the performance of \"Le Tricorne\", for which Picasso had designed costumes and sets, according to Diaghilev's wishes. The ballet was also performed at the Alhambra, in Spain, and was a great success at the Paris Opera in 1919.\n\nOn February 4, 1921, Olga gave birth to a boy named Paulo (Paul). From then on, Olga and Picasso's relationship deteriorated. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with a seventeen-year-old French woman, Marie-Thérèse Walter. In 1935, Olga learned of the affair from a friend, who also informed her that Walter was pregnant. Immediately, Olga took Paulo, moved to the South of France, and filed for divorce. Picasso refused to divide his property evenly with her, as required by French law, so Olga stayed legally married to him until her death from cancer in Cannes, France, in 1955.\n\nPaulo, who died on June 5, 1975, was married to Emilienne Lotte and divorced in 1953. They had two children: Pablito (born on May 5, 1949 – committed suicide on July 2, 1973) and Marina (born on November 14, 1950). Paulo, later in life, married Christiane Pauplin. The couples' only child, Bernard Ruiz-Picasso, co-founded the Picasso Museum in Malaga along with his mother.\n\nIn 1990, Marina Picasso founded an orphanage in Thu Duc, Vietnam (a former military base). Named \"The Village of Youth\", it was funded by Marina’s inheritance from her grandfather, Pablo Picasso. Marina’s foundation has also organized the digging of wells in inland Vietnam, sends regular shipments of milk to orphanages and hospitals and grants farming subsidies and scholarships.\n\n\n"}

It is a spin-off entry in the \"Star Ocean\" series, acting as a direct sequel to the 1998 PlayStation title \"\". It was later remade for mobile devices, releasing in 2009.\n\n\"Blue Sphere\" is set two years after the events of \"The Second Story\" on the planet Edifice, a world currently in a pre-space flight state but holding remnants of an advance civilization. Protagonists from the events of \"The Second Story\" are brought down onto the planet by an unknown force, and must work to discover its source and leave. The gameplay carries over multiple \"Star Ocean\" elements, including real-time combat and optional side conversations between party members. New elements include item creation tied to the skill system, and local multiplayer options unlock through the Game Link Cable.\n\nDevelopment began in 2000 as a spin-off from the main \"Star Ocean\" series, taking approximately one year to complete. Multiple core staff from earlier \"Star Ocean\" titles returned, including series composer Motoi Sakuraba. The character designs were created by manga artist Mayumi Azuma. The production period proved difficult for the team, with the programmers collapsing from exhaustion. In addition to tri-Ace, developer tri-Crescendo helped with the sound design. \"Blue Sphere\" has garnered a positive reception from journalists, and has sold 130,000 copies in Japan as of 2007.\n\n\"Star Ocean: Blue Sphere\" is an action role-playing game set on the planet Edifice. Navigation of field, dungeon and interior environments takes place from a top-down perspective, while battles are displayed from a side angle. Various actions can be performed in the field, such as jumping or interacting with objects, and taking photographs of enemies in the field outside battle to build up a compendium. Carried over from earlier mainline entries are \"Private Actions\", optional sequences between characters which improve their relationship with each other and affect their performance in battle.\n\nBattles are initiated when the party encounters enemies in field environments, transitioning to a separate battle arena. Outside battle, the battle party can be organized as the player pleases out of the 12 possible playable characters. The battle system takes place in real-time, with three party members facing a single enemy. Enemies have various body parts that can be attacked separately, and in turn can attack in distinct ways. In addition to standard attacks are character-specific finishing moves which deal high damage to enemies.\n\nInstead of experience points, each battle rewards the party with Skill Points (SP) in addition to in-game currency. SP are collected in a single pool shared between all playable characters, and can be allocated at the player's discretion. SP can be used to increase statistics such as health and magic, or unlock and increase skills related to both in-battle abilities such as character-specific moves; or field actions. These skills are themselves tied to attributes such as Strength and Intelligence, with the types of skills unlocked tied to which attribute has been raised. Skill growth is interconnected with Create Feats, a minigame where new items such as swords, restoratives or other types of items which can be equipped in battle once forged. The types of items forged in Create Feats depend on what skills are active with each character. A local multiplayer option is available: using the console's Game Link Cable, players can fight each other with their parties, or exchange items.\n\nTaking place in S.D 368 (A.D 2454), 2 years after \"\" and the defeat of the 10 Wise Men, all the characters have since moved on with their lives. Claude has taken Rena, Leon, and Precis to live on Earth with him. While constantly being sent on missions into space, Claude's relationship with Rena doesn't change much at all. Ashton, Celine, Dias, Noel, Chisato, and Bowman still live on Planet Expel. Ernest and Opera are treasure hunting when their ship crash lands on Planet Edifice. Opera manages to send out an S.O.S. to Precis, who then rounds up the entire gang (sans Claude and Rena, who are on a Federation mission) in her self-built ship and heads to the planet. They are also mysteriously pulled down through the planet's atmosphere and crash-land. They decide to explore their surroundings and search for their missing comrades, hoping that Claude and Rena will rescue them, but they too crash-land on Edifice later on in the game.\n\nDevelopment on \"Blue Sphere\" began in 2000, lasting approximately one year. \"Blue Sphere\" was specifically designed as a side story within the \"Star Ocean\" series, in addition to being a sequel to \"The Second Story\". The decision to create the side story was inspired by the wish to fill the gap between the release of \"The Second Story\" and the in-development \"\". The initial scenario had only three protagonists, but this was later expanded to sixteen. As with earlier \"Star Ocean\" titles, the setting was primarily based on fantasy with science fiction elements incorporated. The battle system was an entirely original creation, designed to work within the Game Boy Color's limited specifications while retaining the action-based system of the main series. The game uses a four megabyte cartridge, of which a third is used for dungeons.\n\nThe character designs were originally going to be created by artist Shinnosuke Hino. He ultimately stepped down early in production, and Mayumi Azuma—who had previously worked on the of \"The Second Story\"—was brought in as a replacement. Hino's early work remained in the sprite art. The music was composed by regular series composer Motoi Sakuraba: he created the soundtrack on a PC-9801 Composing for the Game Boy Color presented multiple limitations in cord numbers and quality. The battle theme, \"Hand to Hand\", was a track Sakuraba particularly remembered, as he tried to capture the momentum of battle despite the limited hardware. The game's sound design received development help from tri-Crescendo. According to producer Yoshinori Yamagishi, the work environment for the production was so harsh that the programming staff collapsed from exhaustion, causing work on the programming to come to a temporary halt.\n\n\"Blue Sphere\" was first announced in 2000 by publisher Enix. The publicity was coordinated by Syuichi Kobayashi, a newcomer to Enix who would later go on to act as publicity producer for multiple tri-Ace properties including \"Star Ocean\". It released on June 28, 2001, and was designed to be compatible with both the original Game Boy and the Game Boy Color. A manga adaptation, written and illustrated by Aoi Mizuki, began serialization in 2002.\n\nAlthough the game was initially tentatively planned to be released in North America as well as in Japan, by June 2001, immediately prior to the game's release, Enix had decided not to localize the game. This was partially due to the size of the game and therefore the difficulty in fitting the translated version onto a cartridge, but primarily due to Enix's change in strategy to focus on the newly released Game Boy Advance rather than the Game Boy Color; the company did not want to release any more GBC games and was unwilling to devote the resources to port the game from the GBC to the Advance.\n\nThe game's popularity in Japan, primarily for its story and gameplay systems, prompted tri-Ace to remake it for mobile devices. The remake included redrawn graphics and a remastered soundtrack. The latter was handled by Sakuraba. The game released for NTT DoCoMo's i-mode service on June 8, 2009. Versions for Yahoo! Mobile and EZweb were released on December 16 and 17 respectively.\n\nIn its debut week on sale, \"Blue Sphere\" reached the top of sales charts, selling 69,932 units. According to a 2005 report by tri-Ace on its developed games, \"Blue Sphere\" had sold 130,000 copies in Japan to that date.\n\n"}

After a fight broke out between Jason Varitek and Alex Rodriguez, Sturtze tangled with Gabe Kapler, David Ortiz, and Trot Nixon, and he emerged from the fight with a cut below his ear and blood smeared on his jersey. He missed most of the season after having season-ending surgery to repair a slight tear in his right rotator cuff.\n\nOn December 3, 2006, Sturtze signed a one-year $750,000 contract with the Atlanta Braves. The contract paid him an additional $350,000 if he spent one day on the active 25 man roster. However, \nin March , Sturtze was placed on the 15-day DL, he was transferred to the 60-day DL in May 2007 and given his unconditional release on August 21.\n\nSturtze was signed to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training by the Los Angeles Dodgers on December 12, 2007. He was assigned to the Dodgers Double-A affiliate, the Jacksonville Suns and was later promoted to the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s. He was called up to the majors on August 14, , but was designated for assignment on August 28, and was sent outright to the minors a few days later. Sturtze requested to stay with the team in some capacity, so he was made a bullpen catcher for the remainder of the season and into the playoffs.\n\nIn January , Sturtze re-signed with the Dodgers to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. He did not make the Major League roster and was assigned to the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes.

One of the most successful record producers of the mid-to-late 1990s, Jordan won a 1997 Grammy Award for his work on Puff Daddy's debut album \"No Way Out\" and produced for a number of artists including Mariah Carey, Tevin Campbell, The Notorious B.I.G., 112, Jodeci, Faith Evans, Jay-Z, and Eve.\n\nSteven Aaron Jordan was born on November 2, 1971 in Utica, New York to Moses Jordan and Penny Daniels. Jordan was raised in Buffalo, New York and Rochester, New York by his father after his mother abandoned the family.\n\nJordan first rose to fame as a member of Bad Boy Records' \"Hitmen\" roster of in-house producers and writers during the 1990s. He worked often with label owner Sean \"Puffy\" Combs, producing on several Bad Boy projects, such as the self-titled debut album of R&B quartet 112. Jordan produced their lead single \"Only You\" featuring The Notorious B.I.G.. Jordan produced several records on Notorious B.I.G.'s \"Life After Death\" album, such as \"Mo Money Mo Problems\", \"Nasty Boy\", \"Notorious Thugs\" (featuring Bone Thugs-N-Harmony), \"Another\", \"You're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You)\", and \"Last Day\". Jordan went on to win a Grammy Award for production work on Combs' \"No Way Out\" album, most notably the Notorious B.I.G. tribute song, I'll Be Missing You. Outside of his association with Bad Boy, he has also produced for artists including Mariah Carey, with whom he was nominated for a Grammy Award for the contribution on her album \"Butterfly\" (1997). From the album, he produced songs like \"Honey\" (the album's lead single), \"Breakdown\" (featuring Bone Thugs-n-Harmony), \"Babydoll\", and for Carey's \"#1's\" (1998) \"I Still Believe\" and \"Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)\". In the summer of 1997, three of the aforementioned Stevie J-produced records (I'll Be Missing You, Mo Money Mo Problems, and Honey) topped the Billboard Hot 100 consecutively from the chart weeks of June 14 through September 27, 1997. He has also produced for Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Brian McKnight, Ma$e, Lil' Kim, Deborah Cox, Simbi Khali, Tamia and Tevin Campbell. Jordan also co-wrote the 2001 hit single \"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\" for Eve.\n\nPrior to joining Bad Boy Records, Stevie J often performed with Jodeci as one of their live musicians, playing the bass guitar. Stevie also appeared on their 1995 album \"The Show, The After Party, The Hotel\". Jordan was a member of Swing Mob, a Rochester, New York-based record label and music compound founded by Jodeci member DeVante Swing. After Swing Mob folded and Jordan signed with Bad Boy, he continued a working relationship with Swing's younger brother and fellow Jodeci member Dalvin DeGrate, producing and singing on DeGrate's solo debut album, \"Met.A.Mor.Phic\" (2000).\n\nIn 2012, Stevie J began appearing as a primary cast member of the VH1 reality TV series, \"\", which featured him involved in a love triangle involving his then-girlfriend, Mimi Faust, and new girlfriend, Puerto Rican rapper, Joseline Hernandez. It was alleged that Stevie and Joseline Hernandez were married, but later revealed that they were actually not legally married.\n\nSince the show premiered in 2012, Jordan and Hernandez have become a popular couple in the hip-hop world, making cameo appearances in music videos such as former labelmate Faith Evans' \"I Deserve It\", featuring Missy Elliott and Sharaya J and Trey Songz's Hail Mary, featuring Young Jeezy and Lil Wayne. In 2016, Jordan announced that he will be producing and starring in a movie \"That Time of the Month\" which is set to be released by the end of the year.\n\nJordan has been previously romantically linked to Eve and Alex Martin. Jordan has six children:\n\n\nBoth Mimi and Joseline appear with Stevie on \"Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta\". Jordan was always known as a bad boy with wild relationships, but his show \"Leave It To Stevie\" chronicles not only him as a father and family man, but his growth and maturity, while falling for his best friend [Faith]. \n\nHe married Faith Evans, whom he had known and been friends with for over 20 years, in 2018. He has a grandson, Zion from his eldest son, Dorian.\n\n"}

The MEI hoped to replace the Greens as the major green party, but due to the Green's electoral deals with larger parties, it failed to do so. They claim to be purely ecologist, and neither on the left or right. Waechter failed to win enough endorsements to be a candidate in the 1995 French presidential election. The party ran candidates in the 2004 regional elections and in the 2004 European Parliament election in France and were able to prevent the Greens from gaining more seats, such as in the Eastern EU parliamentary region where the MEI's 3% were enough to prevent the Greens from taking 2 seats there instead of one.\n\nIn the 2007 presidential election, Antoine Waechter rallied the centrist Francois Bayrou after failing to be a candidate himself. Before the 2007 general election, the party signed an electoral deal with Ecology Generation, the Greens and CAP21 having refused to join. 133 MEI candidates nationwide ran for the assembly's 577 seats. 84 candidates obtained 1% or more, even with Green opposition. The MEI seems to have become France's second green party.\n\nDespite being openly favourable to the Europe Écologie coalition, for the 2009 European Parliament election, the party ran as part of the Independent Ecological Alliance which won 3.63% of the vote.\n\nThe party continued its participation in the Independent Ecological Alliance during the 2010 regional elections, except notably in Alsace where it participated in a joint Europe Écologie-MEI list, which later merged with the Socialist list. Antoine Waechter was elected regional councillor for the Haut-Rhin and the party received 2 other regional councillors across France.\n\n"}

In 1992, John Little decided to focus on developing Portal's internal software for other ISPs, which he saw as a fast evolving market. Their ISP business was shut down and the accounts sold to Sprint. The company was renamed Portal Software in 1993 and Dave Labuda joined the new company as co-founder. Little and Labuda developed a scalable and flexible real-time enterprise software architecture, which they applied to the management of customers and revenue for internet and telecom service providers.\n\nPortal Software developed a billing and revenue software suite (Portal Infranet) primarily targeted at telecommunications companies and ISPs. It was one of the largest companies in its business. Customers of Portal Software included PSINet, AOL Time Warner, China Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, France Télécom, iG Brazil, Juno Online Services, KPN, Orange UK, Reuters, SIRIUS Satellite Radio, Sprint Canada, Telefónica, Telenor, Telstra, TIM, U.S. Cellular, Vodafone, SaskTel and XM Satellite Radio.

This serial marks the first appearance of Jackie Lane as companion-to-be Dodo Chaplet. Although audio recordings and still photographs of the story exist, no footage of this serial is known to have survived.\n\nThe arrival of the TARDIS in Paris, France in 1572 places its occupants, the First Doctor and Steven, in a dangerous situation. Tensions between Protestants and Catholics are at fever pitch in the city. Despite the danger, the Doctor heads off alone to visit the apothecary Charles Preslin, leaving Steven alone. Steven enters a tavern and meets Nicholas Muss, a Huguenot. When the Doctor does not return as arranged, Steven decides to spend the night at the home of his new friend. While Steven and Nicholas are wandering home, they find a frightened serving girl, Anne Chaplet. Anne is terrified because she has overheard some Catholic guards speaking of a coming religious massacre of Huguenots here in Paris. To protect her and her knowledge, Nicholas arranges for Anne to go into the service of his master, Admiral Gaspard de Coligny.\n\nThe next day, the Abbot of Amboise arrives at his Parisian residence. Convinced that Anne has discovered the threat to the Protestants, the Abbot sends his secretary Colbert to find her. Steven sees the two talking, and becomes convinced that the Abbot is the Doctor in disguise. He then tries to track down Preslin, the apothecary the Doctor went to meet, but learns he was arrested two years ago for heresy. He heads to the Abbot's house to wait for the Doctor. While hidden he overhears Colbert and an assassin plotting to kill someone they call \"the sea beggar\" tomorrow. With night falling again, Steven heads out and finds Anne following him. They hide for the night at Preslin's empty shop, planning to search for the identity of the sea beggar. They call upon the Abbot, but are forced to flee after Steven realises that the Abbot is not the Doctor.\n\nAnne and Steven meet back at Preslin's shop after the Abbot is killed, and a little later the Doctor himself arrives. After Anne tells the Doctor what day it is, he is very insistent that he and Steven must depart the city as soon as possible. He sends Anne to her aunt’s house, warning her that she must stay there. Meanwhile, Steven and the Doctor head across the city. They make it to the TARDIS just as the curfew is falling and depart as the massacre begins. Steven is worried for Anne and his friends, and angry that the Doctor made him leave. The Doctor insists that history could not be changed. Steven cannot accept that the Doctor left Anne behind, and is so disgusted with his colleague that he determines to leave his company. When the TARDIS lands in 1966 on Wimbledon Common, Steven offers a terse goodbye and ventures outside. The Doctor is left totally alone for the first time, and reflects on the other companions that have travelled with him and then left him, and his inability to return home. A young girl mistakes the TARDIS for a Police Box and enters to report a road accident. Steven comes in too, saying that policemen are approaching, and his heart softens when the young woman introduces herself as Dorothea or Dodo Chaplet.\n\nThe Doctor, hearing Steven's warning of the approaching policemen, hurriedly dematerialises the TARDIS, not noticing until after it has left 1966 that Dodo is still aboard. Steven informs her that there's no way back, and \"we could land anywhere,\" but Dodo seems either unworried or simply doesn't believe him. She says she is an orphan who lives with her great aunt and thus has few ties, as the TARDIS continues to hum, hurtling them toward the next great adventure.\n\n Episode is missing\n\nScript editor Donald Tosh rewrote much of the script delivered by John Lucarotti. In a monograph on \"The Massacre\", James Cooray Smith argues that the Doctor's similarity with the Abbot of Amboise was inspired by a real historical event, the impersonation in 1562 of the Abbot responsible for Marmoutier Abbey in the commune of Amboise by a man called Chastillon, who was later executed. He suggests that Lucarotti's original script (which no longer exists) involved the Doctor extensively impersonating the Abbot with the audience's connivance, whereas Tosh's preference was for the audience to be left unsure whether or not the Abbot was really the Doctor, leading to the disagreements between the two. There are conflicting accounts as to whether Lucarotti's name was removed from the credits at his request. Tosh is credited with co-writing the final episode, on which incoming script editor Gerry Davis was credited as script editor in his place.\n\nAccording to the book \"Doctor Who: Companions\" by David J. Howe and Mark Stammers, the final episode of the serial was to have included a cameo appearance by William Russell and Jacqueline Hill reprising their roles as former companions Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright. The scene had Ian and Barbara witnessing the dematerialisation of the TARDIS after Dodo enters. Although the scene was scheduled, it was not filmed.\n\nOriginal production documents state the name of the serial as \"The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve\", although this is an anachronism, as the actual massacre took place on St Bartholomew's Day.\n\nThe BBC Radio Collection release gives the title as, variously, The Massacre and The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve. The packaging uses the title \"The Massacre\", but the accompanying booklet uses both titles. The CDs have \"The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve\" printed on them and this is also the title announced by Peter Purves on the discs themselves.\n\nWilliam Hartnell was on holiday during filming of episode two; the Doctor does not feature in the episode, and the Abbot appears in a pre-filmed scene only.\n\nLeonard Sachs later played Borusa in \"Arc of Infinity\" (1983). Michael Bilton later played Collins in \"Pyramids of Mars\" (1975) and a Time Lord in \"The Deadly Assassin\" (1976). Christopher Tranchell later played Jenkins in \"The Faceless Ones\" (1967) and Commander Andred in \"The Invasion of Time\" (1978). David Weston later played Biroc in \"Warriors' Gate\" (1981).\n\nJohn Lucarotti's 1987 novelisation of this serial for Target Books, entitled simply \"The Massacre\", returned the story to a previous draft before both a scheduled holiday for Hartnell and technical limitations forced a number of rewrites (allowing Hartnell to not have to be present during recording of the second episode and removing the need for Hartnell to be doubled throughout the story).\n\nThis is one of only three stories, along with \"Marco Polo\" and \"Mission to the Unknown\", of which no footage survives. However, a fan-recorded soundtrack, with linking narration provided by Peter Purves, was released by the BBC Radio Collection on both audio CD and cassette in 1999.\n\nA book length study of the serial, written by James Cooray Smith, was published as part of The Black Archive series from Obverse Books in 2016.\n\nThe serial was covered in number 7 of the book series, which reprinted Andrew Pixley's \"Archive\" features from \"Doctor Who Magazine\" and the various \"Doctor Who Magazine Special Editions\", as well as new articles created specifically for the book.\n\n"}

The basic cargo version was designed to transport a cargo load over all types of terrain in all kinds of weather. Most of these were exported to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease by the USA during World War II, since the competing GMC 6x6 CCKW design proved to be more suitable for Western Front conditions.\n\nIn 1939-1940 the US Army Ordnance Corps was developing -ton (2,300 kg) tactical 6×6 trucks that could operate off-road in all weather. Studebaker, Yellow Coach (a GM company) and International Harvester all submitted designs that were accepted and went into production in 1941.\n\nA total of 219,882 -ton 6x6 trucks and similar 5-ton (4,500 kg) 6x4 versions in thirteen variations were built. Studebaker was the primary manufacturer, which built 197,678 of them at their South Bend IN plant, while REO produced 22,204 more at their Lansing, Michigan plant from 1944 under a sub-contract. REO trucks are identical to Studebakers, but REO only built cargo-model trucks with the long wheelbase and without the front-mounted winch, more specifically referred to as the US6 U9. All production by both manufacturers ended in 1945.\n\nThe US6 was manufactured primarily for export under Lend-Lease. The Soviet Union would become the largest foreign operator. The first Studebaker US6 trucks arrived in the USSR in the autumn of 1941. The Red Army organized a test of eleven 6x6 \"Studebekkers\" (as they become referred to in the USSR) which took place between July 1942 and May 1943. The results were used to direct the enlargement of the payload from to 4 tons (2,300 to 3,600 kg). In 1945, it was lowered to tons (3,200 kg), although on improved roads they could carry up to a maximum of 5 tons (4,500 kg).\n\nLarge numbers of Studebaker US6 trucks were supplied to the Soviet Union via the Persian Corridor in Iran under the USA's Lend-Lease program. The truck fulfilled many important roles in service with Soviet military forces during the war, such as towing artillery pieces and anti-tank guns and transporting troops over long distances. It was renowned for its overall ruggedness and reliability, including its ability to run on poor-quality fuel. The Soviet Red Army also found them to be a suitable platform for conversion into Katyusha rocket launchers, although this was not their main purpose. The truck became affectionately known as the \"Studer\" by Soviet troops and was even recognised of its importance (to the Soviet war effort) by Joseph Stalin, who sent a personal letter of appreciation to Studebaker, in which he thanked them for the superb quality of the US6 for Soviet service.\n\nStudebaker US6 trucks were also used by the US military in the construction of the Ledo Road in Burma, and the Alcan Highway in North America, during WWII.\n\nFollowing the end of WWII, the US6 strongly influenced the USSR's design of the ZiS/ZiL-151 truck, which, in turn, evolved into the similar (and succeeding) ZiL-157.\n\nThe US6 used a Hercules JXD engine, with an L-head inline 6 cylinder gasoline engine developing at 2800 rpm and of torque at 1150 rpm. A conservative-type and highly-reliable engine with a compression ratio of only 5.82:1, it could use 68-octane gasoline. This same engine was also used in the M3 Scout Car and, later, M8 Greyhound and M20 armoured cars (the latter was a variant (lacking the gun turret) of the M8 Greyhound).\n\nThe Warner T 93 5 speed transmission had a very low first, a direct fourth and an overdrive fifth gear. A power take-off could be fitted to operate a winch (mounted just below in front of the radiator) and/or the hydraulic hoist on dump trucks (the U10/U11 and U12/U13 dump truck models).\n\nThe Timken T-79 transfer case had high and low ranges, a neutral position and could either engage or disengage the front axle. There was one output shaft mounted forward to the front axle (not used in 6x4 trucks) and two to the rear, with one for each rear axle.\n\nBoth front and rear axles were of the Timken split-type with a ratio of 6.6:1. The front axle had ball-type constant-velocity joints while the two at the rear were full-floating.\n\nThe US6 had a ladder frame with three beam axles, the front on semi elliptical leaf springs, the rear tandem on quarter elliptical leaf springs with locating arms.\n\nThere were two wheelbases, the short , used in semi tractors, dump trucks, and short cargo models, and the long , used in tankers, long cargo models, and the U9 chassis cab (measurements are from the centerline of the front axle to the centerline of rear bogie). All models had 7.50-20” tires and dual rear tires. 6x4 models, intended for on road use only, were rated at , twice the 6x6's off-road rating.\n\nThe US6 carried the design of Studebaker’s civilian truck cab, although it was modified for military use. Studebaker trucks were different from other 6x6 trucks built for the war effort of the USA because vent windows were included in each door. These vent windows were separate from the main window that rolled down into the door-frame and could be swung out to help with the truck cab's ventilation.\n\nStudebaker also designed the open-type military truck cab which was featured on the GMC CCKW (later models), but their major customer, the USSR, preferred the closed cab for their generally harsh (cold-weather) climate. While Studebaker's open-type truck cab became the American standard, production of the US6 with the closed-type truck cab was restarted after only 10,000 units of the former.\n\nThe U1 and the U2 cargo trucks (which had a frontally-mounted winch) had a short wheelbase and the spare tire was mounted behind the cab, thus allowing a truck-bed measuring only long. These “prime mover”-style bodies were not a success as the US6 was to be mainly used for transporting cargo.\n\nThe U3/U4 and the 6x4 U7/U8 cargo trucks had a longer wheelbase, which allowed the spare tire to be mounted under the truck-bed. 197,000 trucks with the truck-bed were built.\n\nThe U5 tank truck had a long wheelbase and a two-compartment tank mounted on the truck-bed. Tanker trucks were not equipped with winches.\n\nThe 6x4 U6 semi-tractor was the only semi-tractor version in the entire US6 truck series. Semi-tractors have limited off-road performance and, therefore, the U6 was rated for a 5-ton load on improved roads. For this same reason, they had no frontally-mounted winch.\n\nThe U9 cargo truck had a long wheelbase and lacked a frontally-mounted winch. The Soviet Katyusha multiple rocket launcher could be mounted on their truck-beds (most of the US6 trucks in Red Army service were of the U9 model).\n\nThe U10/U11 (end-type) and the U12/U13 (side-type) dump trucks had a short wheelbase. Both types had the dump-body mounted on a sub-frame at the rear of the truck, with the end-type dump having a hydraulic cylinder attached to the chassis with a lever arrangement while the side-type dump had the hydraulic cylinder mounted directly to the truck body.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1859543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859543", "title": "The Berzerker", "text": "The Berzerker\n\nThe Berzerker are an extreme metal band from Melbourne, Australia and was formed in 1995. The band's music, heavily influenced by older death metal and grindcore, can be characterized as a fusion of these with speedcore, and gabber. The band's founding member Luke Kenny described the band's style as industrial death metal.\n\nThe Berzerker has produced five full-length albums, \"The Berzerker\" (2000), \"Dissimulate\" (2002), \"World of Lies\" (2005), \"Animosity\" (2007) and \"The Reawakening\" (2008). These were released through Earache Records, with the exception of the last album, which was self-released through Berserker Industries. During the early part of their career as a live act, band members were identified only as The Vocalist, The Guitarist, The Bassist and The Drummer, distinguishable on stage only by the masks they wore. However, the group eventually abandoned this device, after the masks became unhygienic with age, and to avoid unfavorable comparisons with Slipknot.\n\nA DVD documentary, \"The Principles and Practices of The Berzerker\" (2004), includes several hours of live concert footage, as well as the first public images of the band members without their masks.\n\nMost of the band's music videos have been banned from broadcast for reasons such as the possible epileptic seizure-inducing imagery contained in the video \"Forever\", and the horrific imagery of \"Reality\". The latter features graphic images of cadavers and body parts.\n\nThe Berzerker gained the attention of worldwide metal audiences through remixes of songs by death metal bands Deicide and Morbid Angel. They did this by remixing the song with the screams of mentally ill patients with their good friends Stalaggh. Earache signed the act, then consisting only of Luke Kenny as a one-man DJ/programmer. Kenny had previously been a drummer in various Melbourne bands, including an early death metal group called Mystic Insight, but after suffering injuries in a motor vehicle accident which involved twenty 18-wheeler trucks, was forced to give up playing. Earache Records' website suggests that the album was supposed to be recorded at Devin Townsend's Vancouver studio with contributions from well-known metal artists David Vincent (Morbid Angel), Kevin Sharp (Brutal Truth, Damaged), Dan Lilker (Brutal Truth, Nuclear Assault), and Jed Simon (Strapping Young Lad, Zimmers Hole) until they were all injured in a mysterious event. After disagreements and financial issues, Kenny returned to Australia and worked with friend Sam Bean, who recorded guitar parts, as well as backing vocals. Also enlisted was another Sam contributing backing vocals, dubbed \"Toby\" due to Bean's seniority. Guitarists Jason and Ed Lacey from local metal band The Wolves were also recruited, and after a lengthy recording session, the band's first album, \"The Berzerker\", was released. The album received wide praise in underground metal magazines, and the band was compared to Napalm Death and Strapping Young Lad. The band's masks and live performances earned them further publicity. Videos for the songs \"Reality\" and \"Forever\" were released, but were rarely aired on MTV and other mainstream outlets. MTV refused after they received threats for \"heads to roll.\"\n\nThe Berzerker had their first full U.S. tour after performing fewer than half a dozen shows, touring with other underground bands Dying Fetus, Gorguts and Skinless. Although the shows were well received, the band did not function through the rigors of touring as a unit and at the end of the tour the session musicians, drawn from Melbourne band Alarum, departed. For some months it seemed doubtful that The Berzerker would last for long. There had been constant setbacks at every stage and any momentum gained was now lost with the departure of the live act. However, the arrival of two replacement members injected new life into the band – drummer Gary Thomas from Perth band Plague and guitarist Matt Wilcock from Melbourne death metal band Abramelin, currently in Akercocke.\n\nWith the arrival of these new members The Berzerker set about recording their follow up album \"Dissimulate\". The song 'No-one Wins' was also released as a video. It was claimed that Thomas' drumming on this song was considered for submission to the Guinness Book of Records as fastest drumming performance and while the band has since dismissed this as a fan-fueled rumour, it was included in official press releases at the time. Around this time the band's dragon logo was redone by designer Ivan Kenny-Sumiga. The band celebrated by playing live shows which resulted in onstage violence in Melbourne for months before heading off for a world tour lasting from 2002 to 2003.\n\nAfter covering Australia, The Berzerker toured the US with Immolation, Vader and Origin, then travelled to the UK for a headlining tour with Labrat, Insision and Red Harvest. This culminated in an infamous Earache Christmas Party appearance, where the band terrorised both record label and the audience. This exceptionally violent and drunken performance was captured on the DVD \"Principles and Practices of The Berzerker\". The band continued on to the US after a brief Christmas break to do another full US tour with Nile, Napalm Death, Strapping Young Lad and Dark Tranquillity. Disaster struck in New York however when Thomas had an altercation with a bouncer that resulted in a broken foot and cracked vertebrae. The band could not pull out of the tour as there was still a week left, and each show had to be played to allow them to afford to make plane flights to the next tour because members of the band were poor. To solve the problem, Kenny took on playing the drums as well as vocals. Nile drummer Tony Laureano played the Carcass cover \"Corporal Jigsore Quandary\" each night. The footage of this would later be added to the DVD \"The Berzerker\".\n\nAt the end of that tour, the band spent ten days in Florida before their headline tour of the UK and Europe began. With no drummer, auditions were organised and the band selected a local drummer to take on tour. The new drummer was required to learn the full headlining tour set in six days. The Berzerker hit the UK for its next round of headlining shows featuring snuff footage, locals being abducted, and audiences getting punched in the face, then headed out to Europe for their first-ever appearance there. Finally after five months of touring the band headed home.\n\nLuke Kenny decided to focus the downtime into compiling all the footage he had recorded of the band, producing a DVD titled \"The Principles and Practices of The Berzerker\". This DVD ended up being over four hours long, consisting of one professionally shot show, another concert-worth of assorted bootleg footage, backstage recordings, band rehearsals, and touring. Also included was documentary-style footage of the recording of both albums (including many unflattering incidents), full interviews with band members, the making of the masks and artwork, and contributions from fans, including one who had tattooed the dragon logo onto her back. The DVD was recommended by \"Kerrang!\" for aspiring metal bands.\n\nThe DVD brought with it a change in The Berzerker – for the first time, the band members' faces were unmasked. Following this, a decision was made to lose the masks altogether.\n\nWith Thomas healing in Perth and Wilcock moving to the UK to join Akercocke, The Berzerker decided to record the third album \"World of Lies\" over Christmas 2004 with the original lineup from the debut album. It was recorded spontaneously over a week, with no prior planning in direct opposition to how they had created albums in the past. In other changes, all guitar tracks were recorded directly into a laptop via an analog-to-digital converter without a guitar amp and no live drumming featured on the album. Subsequent live performances featured Dave Gray of Akercocke taking over drumming duties. The album was well received by many critics and one said that \"it is a masterpiece of work, that was created in only a matter of minutes\".\n\nA year after the release of \"World of Lies\", The Berzerker released their fourth studio album \"Animosity\" on February 12, 2007. This recording saw the band return to their older style of music with a drum machine included for the drum parts as well as a faster tempo in most of the tracks compared to the previous album. A special edition version of this album was also available which included a bonus live CD by the band recorded at London Dome on December 16, 2006 featuring the then new track \"Heavily Medicated\", a selection of tracks from their previous albums, as well as several covers of songs by Morbid Angel and Carcass.\n\nAnimosity was the last record the band were contracted with Earache Records. For the next album \"The Reawakening\" the band released it through their own label 'Berzerker Industries'. The album was only available through their official online store. Following the release they toured extensively in several parts of the world sharing the stage with other acts including Satyricon, Napalm Death, Suicide Silence, and Zonaria.\n\n2009 would be the last known year where the band were actively touring the world and playing shows. After October 2009 the band ceased updates. No new tours or future plans were announced. The band appeared to be on hiatus for just over a year, and in late 2010 it seemed the band had indeed split up following several status updates on their Myspace profile referring to 'It's Finally Over' and 'Last Berzerker show in Melbourne'. Furthermore, Kenny has stated that he had lost interest in carrying on with the band and has since moved on to a photography job for \"Evokke\" magazine. Since the break-up, former bassist, Sam Bean has released an album with his new band, The Senseless. He also stated in an interview that The Berzerker were on \"indefinite hiatus\", adding that this \"is the best way to describe it.\"\n\nAccording to the official Facebook page of the band, The Berzerker will release a new album in March 2020, which will mark their first studio album in 12 years. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1859553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859553", "title": "Ramón Grau", "text": "Ramón Grau\n\nDr. Ramón Grau San Martín (September 13, 1881, La Palma, Pinar del Río Province, Spanish Cuba – July 28, 1969, Havana, Cuba) was a Cuban physician and President of Cuba (1933–1934, 1944–1948). He was the last president other than an interim president, Carlos Manuel Piedra, to be born during Spanish rule. He is sometimes called Raymond Grau San Martin in English.\n\nGrau's father, a rich tobacco grower, wanted Ramón to continue in his footsteps, but Ramón himself wanted to be a doctor. He studied at the University of Havana and graduated in 1908 with a Doctor of Medicine degree, then expatriated to Europe in order to expand his medical knowledge. He returned to Cuba in 1921 and became a professor of physiology at the University of Havana.\n\nIn the 1920s he was involved with the student protests against then-President Gerardo Machado, and was jailed in 1931. Upon his release he was exiled from Cuba, temporarily migrating to the United States.\n\nAfter the 1933 Cuban Revolution Grau initially became one of the five members of the Pentarchy of 1933 government (). Thereafter, on , members of the Directorio Estudiantil Universitario met in the Hall of Mirrors in the Palacio de los Capitanes Generales and after intensive debate between various proposed candidates, it was agreed that Ramón Grau would be the next president. Grau's presidency became known as the One Hundred Days Government and ended on .\n\nCarlos E. Finlay for Secretary of Health, Antonio Guiteras Holmes for Secretary of Government, Ramiro Copablanca for Secretary of the Presidency, Germán Álvarez Fuentes for Secretary of Agriculture, Joaquin del Rio Balamaseda for Secretary of Justice, Julio Aguado for Secretary of War & Navy, Gustavo Moreno for Secretary of Public Works and Manuel Marquez Sterling for Secretary of State\n\nThe One Hundred Days government was in part a mixture of reformist-moderate minded individuals such as Grau and radicals including Antonio Guiteras Holmes. The One Hundred Days government is mainly remembered for left-leaning or progressive reforms such as the establishment of the 8-hour work day as per Grau's presidential decree no. 1693, a raise of minimum wage, nationalization of Cuban Electric Company, and granting autonomy to the University of Havana. \nDespite the government's progressive agenda, the government faced significant political power struggles. On the one hand it was not recognized by the U.S. government, secondly there were still other groups especially members of the traditional parties such as the Liberal, Conservative and Union Nacionalista parties as well as the ABC who either did not support Grau's government or wanted a more inclusive administration. Finally, while the Army Chief of Staff Fulgencio Batista, nominally surrendered the power of the army to the new government, in reality Batista was having talks, making behind-doors deals with Sumner Welles and other political groups. \n\nEventually Batista would force Grau's resignation on January 15, 1934. Grau, however, still maintained significant power throughout the beginning of his presidency and on one occasion various ranking members of Grau's cabinet as well as students from the Directorio Estudiantil Universitario wanted Batista removed or assassinated. This was partly because Batista was holding talks with Sumner Welles and other members of the Cuban opposition regarding a potential change in government without the knowledge or public sanctioning of Grau's administration. \n\nIn addition to the political struggles, the dire state of the economy due to the Depression of the 1930s and the massive debt left over by Machado's administration, there was also the issue of the army officials regrouping and setting up camp in the Hotel Nacional de Cuba. After failed negotiations between army officials and Grau's government, this deadlock would ultimately end with the Battle of the Hotel Nacional of Cuba on October 2, 1933.\n\nIn 1934 Grau went on to found the Partido Auténtico. His niece, Pola Grau Alsina (1915– 2000), served as First Lady of Cuba during his first presidency.\n\nGrau was instrumental in passing the 1940 Constitution of Cuba. For much of the Constitutional Convention, he served as the presiding officer (even after his coalition was pushed into the minority after the defection of one of the parties that formed it). He would eventually come to be replaced by Carlos Márquez Sterling.\n\nIn 1940 Grau ran in the presidential election and lost to Fulgencio Batista. Most independent observers at the time qualified the 1940 election as free and fair elections.\n\nIn 1944 Grau won the popular vote in the presidential election, defeating Carlos Saladrigas Zayas, Batista's handpicked successor, and served until 1948. Despite his initial popularity in 1933, accusations of corruption tainted his administration's image, and a sizable number of Cubans began to distrust him.\n\nAs Grau assumed the presidency, he was forced to address many financial problems left by his predecessor, Batista. In a July 17, 1944 dispatch to the U.S. Secretary of State, U.S. Ambassador Spruille Braden stated: It is becoming increasingly apparent that President Batista intends to discomfit the incoming Administration in every way possible, particularly financially. A systematic raid on the Treasury is in full swing with the result that Dr. Grau will probably find empty coffers when he takes office on October 10. It is blatant that President Batista desires that Dr. Grau San Matin should assume obligations which in fairness and equity should be a matter of settlement by the present Administration.\n\nIn 1947, Cuba was the only Western country to vote against the creation of Israel.\n\nAfter turning over the presidency to his protégé, Carlos Prío, in 1948, Grau virtually withdrew from public life. He emerged again in 1952 to oppose Batista's \"coup d'état\". Grau ran for president in the 1954 and 1958 Batista-sponsored elections but withdrew just prior to each election day, claiming government fraud. After the Cuban Revolution and the rise of Fidel Castro in 1959, Grau retired to his home in Havana and maintained a low profile. He died there on July 28, 1969.\n\n\n"}

He was the brother of actress Julie Depardieu, and half-brother of Roxane and Jean Depardieu.\n\nGuillaume shared the screen with his father several times throughout his career, beginning with his first film role, aged three, playing Gérard's son in Claude Goretta's \"That Wonderful Crook\" (\"Pas Si Méchant Que Ça\") in 1974. His next appearance beside his father was in \"Tous les matins du monde\" in 1991, followed by \"Count of Monte Cristo\" in 1998, and \"Aime Ton Père\" (\"A Loving Father\") in 2002. In 1996 he won a César Award (France's national film award) as the most promising newcomer in \"Les Apprentis\". In 2007, he began rebuilding his career with the films \"Don't Touch the Axe\" (\"Ne Touchez Pas La Hache\") and \"La France\", and starred in the 2008 film \"De la guerre\".\n\nDepardieu had a relationship with actress Clotilde Courau from 1997 to 1999, then married actress Elise Ventre on 30 December 1999.

He appeared in over 220 films in Kannada, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam. He was called 'The Phoenix of Indian Cinema'. He made his debut in the 1972 film, \"Vamsha Vriksha\", in a supporting role. The same year he played the lead role in Puttanna Kanagal's \"Naagarahaavu\", and was recognized as 'The Angry Young Man of Kannada Cinema'. He has played a variety of roles in different genres.\n\nIn 2008, a poll conducted by CNN-IBN listed Vishnuvardhan as the most popular star in the Kannada Film Industry. A road stretching 14.5 km from Banashankari Temple to Kengeri in Bengaluru has been named after the superstar. It is the longest road in Asia to be named after a celebrity. He was a martial artist, In an interview with \"The Hindu\", he had said that it was the era of Bruce Lee and it was only Kamal Haasan and himself who had learnt martial arts in his generation. He was also the story writer of the 1997 movie \"Ganesha I Love You\" directed by Phani Ramachandra.\n\nHe was also fondly called as Sahasasimha and Abhinava Bhargava by the people of Karnataka.\n\nVishnuvardhan was born in Mysore to H. L. Narayana Rao and Kamakshamma. His ancestors are from Hallegere, Mandya district of Karnataka. His father was an artist, music composer and a screenwriter who was known for his collection of musical instruments. He had six siblings. His sister Rama was a Kathak dancer at the Mysore Palace, and brother Ravi was a child actor who appeared in the 1955 Tamil language and Kannada bilingual film \"Modala Thedi\". Vishnuvardhan was educated first in Mysore's Gopalswamy School and then at Bangalore's Kannada Model High School. He attended high school and obtained a degree from National College, Basavanagudi, Bangalore.\n\nVishnuvardhan married actress Bharathi on 17 February 1975 in Bangalore. They have adopted two children, Keerthi and Chandana.\n\nVishnuvardhan started his career with the National Award-winning movie \"Vamshavruksha\" (1972) directed by Girish Karnad based on the novel written by S. L. Bhyrappa. His first lead role was in \"Naagarahaavu\", directed by Puttanna Kanagal and based on a novel by T. R. Subba Rao. It was the first in Kannada film history to complete 100 days in three main theatres of Bangalore. In his 37-year career, he has played a variety of roles in more than 200 films.\n\nHe appeared on television for the first time in the 1980s. Shankar Nag directed \"Malgudi Days\" and introduced Vishnuvardhan as the main character Venkat Rao, in an episode called \"Rupees Forty-five a Month\". Here, his co-star was Gayatri Nag.\n\nVishnuvardhan started an organisation called Sneha Loka to promote harmony and to help during calamities like floods. He conducted a 'padayatra' to collect funds for the flood-affected people in the northern part of the state. Vishnuvardhan and his wife Bharathi had adopted the Melukote town in Mandya district where he had dug borewells in the water-starved temple town. Many of his other charitable donations were revealed only when the beneficiaries came forward and spoke about it. In January 2005, Vishnuvardhan, cricketer Syed Kirmani and Shivram participated in a Cancer Awareness Walkathon organised by Bangalore Institute of Oncology (BIO) to commemorate its 15 years of public service in Bangalore.\n\nS. P. Balasubrahmanyam is record-holder for having sung more than 40,000 songs in Indian languages including Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Hindi.

Balasubrahmanyam as music director, composed all the songs for Vishnuvardhan's \"Sowbhagyalakshmi\". Vishnuvardhan never missed any of the birthdays of S. P. Balasubrahmanyam. In every film of the actor, he had to sing couple of songs and Vishnu would insist. Balasubrahmanyam has sung all the five songs in his last Kannada film \"Aptharakshaka\" and was awarded the Best Playback Singer Filmfare Award for the song \"Gharane Ghara Gharane\". He dedicated his award to Vishnuvardhan.\nAfter Vishnuvardhan's death, Balasubrahmanyam paid tribute to him in musical nights and one such show happened in Bengaluru and Mysuru.\n\nVishnuvardhan's pairing with director H.R. Bhargava is considered as one of the best pairings of Kannada film industry. His first film with H.R. Bhargava was Asaadhya Aliya which was a successful one. He has a total of 23 films with H.R.

{"id": "1859578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859578", "title": "Christian People's Party (Peru)", "text": "Christian People's Party (Peru)\n\nThe Christian People's Party () is a center-right and conservative political party based on the principles of Christian democracy. It was founded in 1966 by a group of Peruvian Christian Democrat Party (\"Democracia Cristiana\") dissidents, led by Luis Bedoya Reyes. In 2000 its inscription was renewed, and it became part of National Unity, albeit not in a permanent basis.\n\nLeaders of the party have included Mario Polar Ugarteche, Roberto Ramírez del Villar, Ernesto Alayza Grundy, Felipe Osterling Parodi and Lourdes Flores Nano.\n\nThe party was founded on December 18, 1966 by a group of members of the Democracia Cristiana party that defected by ideological motifs. While their former party supported a constitutional break to accelerate the reforms needed by the country, the founders of the PPC, led by Luis Bedoya Reyes still believed in the constitutional order. Thus they retired from Democracia Cristiana and founded the new party.\n\nIn 1968, General Juan Velasco Alvarado staged a coup d'etat against President Fernando Belaúnde Terry, an ally of Luis Bedoya Reyes. The PPC did not support the military regime and was one of its most fierce opponents, along with the Partido Aprista Peruano (APRA). The latter was declared illegal.\n\nIn 1979 the government of General Francisco Morales Bermúdez called for elections for a Constituent Assembly. The PPC attained the second place in the polls, after the APRA. Bedoya Reyes, widely preferred by the Assembly members to become its president, gave the position to the veteran APRA leader, Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre.\n\nLuis Bedoya Reyes ran as the PPC's candidate for president in the General Elections of 1980, with Ernesto Alayza and Roberto Ramírez del Villar as first vice-president and second vice-president. Despite Bedoya finishing in the third place, the PPC got six Senators elected, as well as some deputies.\n\nDuring the elections, the PPC allied with the soon-to-be elected President Fernando Belaúnde Terry, from Acción Popular. The PPC-Alianza Popular coalition gave Belaúnde the majority in the Senate and in the Deputies Chamber. The coalition also designated four PPC members as Ministers, including its leader Bedoya Reyes and Felipe Osterling Parodi.\n\nFor the General Elections of 1985, the coalition with Acción Popular was finished, and thus, both parties presented separate candidates. Bedoya Reyes finished in third again, trailing behind Alfonso Barrantes Lingán. During Alan García's government, the PPC criticised the heterodox economic model designed by the APRA.\n\nThe PPC had only a few members in both chambers. Its most important representatives were Felipe Osterling Parodi in the Senate of Peru and Javier Bedoya – son of the founder of the PPC – in the Chamber of Deputies. When Alan García sought to take control of private banking, Luis Bedoya Reyes and Lourdes Flores rallied in the streets against the proposal. They were joined in the manifestations by the famous Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa. The movement did stop the government from passing the polemical Law.\n\nIn 1990 the PPC enters a liberal coalition with Acción Popular and Mario Vargas Llosa's Movimiento Libertad (Liberty Movement), forming the Frente Democrático (FREDEMO, Democratic Front), which launched Vargas Llosa as a candidate for the presidency. Although he did not get elected, the coalition's participation in the Deputies Chamber was a success: it got 25 representatives, attaining the majority, including Javier Bedoya, one of the most voted deputies nationwide.\n\nThe PPC held the presidency of the Senate under Felipe Osterling Parodi's leadership when, in 1992, Alberto Fujimori staged a self-coup, dissolving both Chambers of the Congress, neutralising the FREDEMO and the APRA.\n\nFujimori held polls to elect a Democratic Constituent Congress, where his party, Cambio 90-Nueva Mayoría, got an absolute majority. The PPC was divided between those who wanted to be part of the elections and those who did not want to. Amongst those who did not want to participate where Natale Amprimo, Alberto Borea and Alberto Andrade, arguing that the PPC should not be part of a non-democratic process. In the other hand, Luis Bedoya Reyes, Lourdes Flores and Xavier Barrón contended that the PPC should present itself to guarantee democracy in the Constituent Congress. The decision of being part of the elections led to the resignations of Amprimo, Borea and Andrade. The PPC was the second most-voted party, but it was far behind of Cambio 90-Nueva Mayoría.\n\nIn the General Elections of 1995, the PPC nominated Lourdes Flores as its candidate for president, but in the end she resigned to support Javier Pérez de Cuéllar's candidacy. Fujimori won without a run-off and the PPC only got the seventh place in the elections for Congressmen.\n\nWhen Alberto Fujimori wanted to run for a third period in the General Elections of 2000, he was strongly opposed by the PPC. Congressmen Xavier Barrón, Antero Flores Aráoz and Lourdes Flores proposed a law project that gave way to a referendum, where the people could decide whether Fujimori could participate in the elections. The Congress, controlled by Cambio 90-Nueva Mayoría did not let the Law pass. After the proposal of the law, the National Jury of Elections withdrew the PPC's inscription as a party, so it could not present candidates for the Congress. Because of that, Alejandro Toledo's Perú Posible party decided to support the PPC, including Xavier Barrón and Antero Flores Aráoz, as guests in its list for the Congress. Both of them were elected to Congress.\n\nIn 2001, during the interim government of Acción Popular's Valentín Paniagua, the PPC recouped its inscription. It became part of a political coalition with Renovación Nacional and Cambio Radical, named Unidad Nacional (National Unity). The alliance's candidate for president was Lourdes Flores, who achieved the third place by a narrow margin.\n\nIn 2006 the Unidad Nacional coalition continued, maintaining Lourdes Flores as its candidate. She did not pass to the round-off, again for a narrow margin, and again trailing behind Alan García, who would become Peru's President for a second time.\n\n"}

It drains a suburban and urban area of the northwestern Denver Metropolitan Area. It rises in the foothills in northeastern Gilpin County, in southern Golden Gate Canyon State Park. It descends through a valley eastward into Jefferson, following Drew Hill Road (County Road 57), emerging from the mountains approximately 3 miles (5 km) north of Golden, where it is impounded to form Ralston Reservoir and Arvada/Blunn Reservoir on both sides of State Highway 93. It flows eastward through Arvada and joins Clear Creek from the north in southeast Arvada, near the intersection of Sheridan Avenue and Interstate 76.\n\nThe first documented discovery of gold in the Rocky Mountain region occurred in June 1850, when Lewis Ralston, a Georgia prospector headed for the California gold fields, dipped his sluice pan into this stream near its mouth at Clear Creek. Ralston found about 1/4 ounce (6 g) of gold worth about five dollars. Ralston's companions named the stream Ralston's Creek in his honor, but they all left the next morning, drawn by the lure of the California gold fields.\n\nIn the spring of 1858, William Green Russell and his brothers searched the creek for gold. Later in the year, Lewis Ralston brought another group of prospectors back to the site of his first discovery.\n\nIn 2010 officials discovered that the defunct Schwartzwalder uranium mine was contaminating groundwater near the reservoir, threatening the Denver water supply with concentrations of uranium some 1000 times the human health standard. The owners of the mine, Cotter Corp., rerouted the Ralston Creek around the mine site after uranium levels of between 40 and 50 parts per billion were discovered in the creek, greater than the 30 ppb federal drinking water standard. Cotter hopes the rerouting will be temporary while it cleans the contaminated mine using bioremediation.\n\n"}

The film title is an acronym of the French title of the novel, \"Pierre ou les ambiguïtés\", plus the Roman numeral \"X\" indicating the tenth draft version of the script that was used to make the film.\n\nThe film was entered into the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. \"Pola X\" has been associated with the New French Extremity.\n\nPierre (Guillaume Depardieu) lives with his sister Marie (Catherine Deneuve) in a chateau in Normandy by the riverside of the Seine. They are very beautiful, rich, carefree and they like themselves. Every morning, Pierre leaves on the inherited motor bike of his father to visit Lucie, his fiancée. One night, Marie announces to Pierre that she arranged the date for his marriage to Lucie. Pierre leaves to announce the good news to his fiancée. On the way, in the forest, a funereal beauty appears. She speaks with a strong accent from the countries of the East: \"Pierre...you are not the only child. I am your sister, Isabelle.\" A passionate incestuous relationship will ensue.\n\nThe soundtrack was produced by Scott Walker and features some instrumental tracks by him, as well as contributions by Sonic Youth and Bill Callahan, who also has a cameo appearance in the film.\n\nAn alternate longer TV version entitled \"Pierre ou les ambiguïtés\", edited in three episodes with an additional 40 minutes of footage, was shown for the first time on 24 September 2001 on Arte German-French TV channel. The episodes were titled \"A la lumière,\" \"A l'ombre des lumières\" and \"Dans le sang.\"\n\nCarax edited the TV version along the lines of serials from his childhood, in particular Vidocq.

A precursor movement was the \"Ukonusko\" (\"Ukko's Faith\", revolving around the god Ukko) of the early 20th century. The main problem in the revival of Finnish paganism is the nature of pre-Christian Finnish culture, which relied on oral tradition which may be subject to change over time. The primary sources concerning Finnish native culture are written by latter-era Christians.\n\nThere are two main organisations of the religion, the \"Association of Finnish Native Religion\" (\"Suomalaisen kansanuskon yhdistys ry\") based in Helsinki and officially registered since 2002, and the \"Pole Star Association\" (\"Taivaannaula ry\") headquartered in Turku with branches in many cities, founded and officially registered in 2007. The Association of Finnish Native Religion also caters to Karelians and is a member of the Uralic Communion.\n\nPagan beliefs, traditions and myths survived for a long time side by side with official Lutheranism in Eastern Finland and in Karelia, at least until the first part of the 20th century. The first efforts of recovery of ancient mythology were carried out to enrich national Finnish culture.\n\nNature worship, respect for traditions, and equality are typical features of the Neopagan movement. The Finnish native religion can be defined as \"ethno-pagan\", as it is related to national consciousness and identity. Finnish native religion followers do not necessarily consider themselves \"Neopagans\" or identify with new religions such as Wicca.\n\nThey emphasise love for the motherland as a key content of a balanced relationship of humans with nature, old and new generations, as well as individual and community. The Finnish native faith believers hold sacred many unspoiled natural places, woods, springs and rocks. They consider the numinous presence of the gods, the ancestors and the spirits, as pervading the natural sites and environments (\"hiisi\").\n\nIn 2013 the Taivaannaula launched a national project on Finnish holy places and sites in order to increase awareness and protection. In 2014 Karhun kansa (\"People of the Bear\") was officially registered as an organised religious community, becoming the first neopagan association given such status in Finland. The status brings the authority for example to marry, bury and give names.\n\nThe Finnish native religion is polytheistic, with a pantheon of many deities worshipped: Ukko the sky god, and chief deity in the Finnish pantheon, Akka the goddess of fertility, and wife of Ukko, Ahti, Tapio, Pekko, Nyyrikki, Mielikki, Ilmarinen (the god of sky and weather, whom some consider to be the same as Ukko), Louhi, Turisas, Haltijas (genius loci), Lemminkäinen (mythical hero), Väinämöinen (mythical hero, creator god, and god of poetry, music and magic), Hiisi (spirit of the holy place, genius loci), Jumi (fertility god or statue that gives fertility).\n\nThe religion also includes an element of ancestor worship. For Finnish native religion adherents, the afterlife is a place called Tuonela, and it is a place where several different deities live, including Tuoni.\n\nVarious traditional festivals are followed, including Hela, a festival celebrating the coming of spring and the new growing season, Juhannus or Ukon juhla, the midsummer festival, Kekri, a celebration of harvest and the ancestors, and Joulu, the midwinter festival.\n\nSome Finnish Neopagans visit sacred forests, where wooden god-images or sacred stones can sometimes be found. Some celebrate the circling of the year at certain dates, for example by burning bonfires, dancing, sacrificing, or making other kinds of rituals. One ritual, which is also an authentic practice of the ancestors, is to drink a toast for the thunder god Ukko at the midsummer festival (Finnish: \"Ukon juhla\").\n\n\n\n"}

Like \"Silent Hunter II\", it places the player in command of a German U-boat during the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II.\n\n\"Silent Hunter III\" features a dynamic campaign. Instead of giving the player a specific set of objectives for each mission, \"Silent Hunter III\" simply assigns the player a certain patrol grid, and appropriate naval traffic, such as convoys, destroyer escorts, and task forces are automatically generated by the simulation engine. How the mission proceeds and what targets are attacked is determined by the player.\n\n\"Silent Hunter III\" features two methods of play - either a dynamic campaign or select historically-inspired missions, such as an operation to save the , or the sinking of in Scapa Flow.\n\nGerman World War II veteran and sub commander Jürgen Oesten was a technical advisor for the game.\n\nIn the campaign version of the game, a player begins their career as a \"Lieutenant, Jr.\" (corresponding to \"Leutnant zur See\"), with the choice of initial assignments to a U-boat base between the years 1939 and 1943. The war time and political situation of World War II is reflected in the geographical area and time period which the player begins their career.\n\nThe \"Silent Hunter III\" campaign will assign the player a certain patrol grid with appropriate naval traffic (such as convoys, destroyer escorts, and task forces) automatically generated by the simulation engine. How the mission proceeds and what targets are attacked is left totally up to the player. The player also has the option to change realism settings on the submarine, adding challenges such as fuel being limited as well as various game play assistance features involving navigation, weapons, and the ability to switch to external camera mode to view the submarine's surroundings.\n\nThe most difficult realism setting in the game allows a player to manually target torpedoes for an attack on enemy vessels. In the manual targeting feature, the player must observe vessels, determine their class and nationality, as well as calculate speed, angle on the bow, and gyro angle for torpedo launch. The player also has the option to set torpedo depth and spread shot with multiple weapons. De-selecting manual targeting allows a \"Weapons Officer\" to make these determinations for the player, although approaching targets at certain angles and determining relative motion is still a factor.\n\nThe simulation engine further generates various coastal and port cities, which appear as large harbors surrounded on the outskirts by town buildings, churches, and factories. It is possible for the player to sail into such ports (friendly, neutral, or hostile) and either dock or engage moored targets. Some of the cities available are Portsmouth, Scapa Flow, New York City, Norfolk, Virginia, and Tampa, Florida. Although possible to sail to South America and into the Pacific, the simulation will not generate traffic or port cities for these regions.\n\nThe game features a fully 3D U-boat control room, allowing the player the ability to look around the interior of certain submarine rooms. Unlike other submarine simulations, where the crew is often heard but not seen, \"Silent Hunter III\" allows the player to see and interact with crew members. The game also tracks the stats of individual crew members, such as rank, experience, morale, and decorations between missions.\n\nThe game received \"universal acclaim\" upon release according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. According to NPD Group, \"Silent Hunter III\" sold 26,600 copies by June 2005.\n\nThe editors of \"Computer Games Magazine\" presented \"Silent Hunter III\" with their 2005 \"Best Simulation\" award, and named it the year's third-best computer game. They wrote, \"Are sims dead? Not when they're this good.\" It also won the \"Best Simulation 2005\" award from \"PC Gamer US\", whose editors called the game \"simply an amazing voyage.\"\n\n"}

Aaron also made a narration appearance on Dreambreed's \"Sometime\" mini-album in 1995.\n\nHe was born in England but moved to Germany when he was six months old, because his British army officer father was stationed in the country. He lives in Halifax, West Yorkshire. He has a baritone vocal range.\nHe is an avid reader of Romantic poets such as Percy Bysshe Shelley and often draws on the Bible for inspiration. In a 2004 interview with Live 4 Metal, Stainthorpe commented that:\n\n\"\"I have no religious beliefs but I do like to use the Bible as a source of inspiration because it’s an obvious wealth of delicious tales and characters.\" \"\n\nDespite the morose nature of his lyrics, Stainthorpe insists they do not give a full overview of his personality. In 2004 he said:\n\n\"\"Some of the stuff is influenced by personal mishaps in life. Nobody has lived a perfectly good life without tragedies and we’ve used them as part of our songwriting. I think that dwelling on the darker side of life seems much more interesting and evocative than the happier things...I’ve got somewhere to put my depression and it’s called My Dying Bride...I'm generally a happy guy!\"\"\n"}

This book and her subsequent work on what she terms the \"Carroll Myth\" have been major sources of upheaval and controversy in recent years and she has produced very polarized responses from Carroll scholars and lay enthusiasts.\n\nLeach was born in Liverpool. She studied acting and worked as both actor and director in British theatre before becoming a writer.\n\nHer first professional produced work as a writer was an adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Snow Queen\", commissioned by Orchard Theatre Company in 1989. \"The Mysterious Mr Love\" was produced in London's West End in 1997. Under the new title of \"Tryst\" that play opened off-Broadway at the Promenade Theatre, on 6 April 2006, and has subsequently been produced in many cities around the world, including Athens, Warsaw, Houston, Los Angeles and Montreal.\n\nLeach's theory of a \"Carroll Myth\" created a furor when first suggested, and continues to divide scholars, although in recent years the idea has been gaining ground, with authors such as Carolyn Siger offering it support. However, authors including Morton N. Cohen and Martin Gardner continue to downplay or dismiss her importance. Cohen, who is also a Dodgson biographer, repudiates Leach's position as being simply a plea for the defence, and, in a 2003 article in the \"Times Literary Supplement\" labeled Leach and her supporters as 'revisionists' attempting to rewrite history.\n\nIn 2004 Leach founded the Association for New Lewis Carroll Studies, that aims to promote reassessment of Carroll's life in light of the alleged 'Myth'. Its membership, as of 2010, includes scholars such as Hugues Lebailly, Carolyn Sigler, Sherry L. Ackerman, John Tufail and Cristopher Hollingsworth.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1859663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859663", "title": "Indian Ocean (band)", "text": "Indian Ocean (band)\n\nIndian Ocean is an Indian rock band formed in New Delhi in 1990, who are widely recognized as the pioneers of the fusion rock genre in India. Susmit Sen, Asheem Chakravarty, Rahul Ram and Amit Kilam were band members till Chakravarty's demise on 25 December 2009, after which Tuheen Chakravorty and Himanshu Joshi were officially inducted into the band as replacements. After the departure of Susmit Sen in 2013, Rahul Ram is the only founding member who appeared on the band's debut album \"Indian Ocean\". Sanjeev Sharma has collaborated with them as lyricist on many Albums.\n\nThe musical style of the band can be at best classified as folk and fusion music. It is an experimental genre, fusing raga (traditional Indian tunes) with rock music, guitars and drums, sometimes using Indian folk songs. It has also been described by some music critics as \"Indo-rock fusion with jazz-spiced rhythms that integrates shlokas, sufism, environmentalism, mythology and revolution\".\n\nSince 2010, the band has moved against the lines of record labels. They released their latest album \"16/330 Khajoor Road\" online for free. The main reason for this move was the frustration over negotiating contracts with record companies and fighting over copyright issues. They have turned to concerts and sponsorships for generating revenue rather than playing in the hands of record labels. For a brief amount of time they had the sponsorship of Johnnie Walker. They are also a part of the world's first Music Personalisation Initiative named DRP as one of the five Featured Artists. In its 2014 listing of \"25 Greatest Indian Rock Songs of the last 25 Years\", \"Rolling Stone India\" featured two songs, \"Ma Rewa\" and \"Kandisa\" from the album, \"Kandisa\" (2000).\n\nIn the early 1980s, Asheem Chakravarty played tabla for a Bengali band Niharika. In 1984, Susmit Sen, a fan of Niharika, met him during a concert. Chakravarty was impressed by Sen's guitar-playing and his vision to evolve a new sound, while Sen, learned the nuances of rhythm from Chakravarty.\n\nFor the next 3 years, with Sen as the guitarist and Chakravarty on tabla and drums, they experimented with their music without writing original lyrics. Apart from a concert at Roorkee University, there were not many notable performances by them.\n\nThe name Indian Ocean was suggested by Sen's father in 1990. Shaleen Sharma was taken on as the drummer, and Indrajit Dutta and Anirban Roy as bassists. The band recorded a demo, with the help of Sen selling his electric guitar to raise the required money. The tape was 45 minutes long and consisted of 7 songs, all recorded in a single day. Despite the rushed recording, the quality of the demo tape impressed HMV and they were offered an album deal.\n\nIn 1991, Rahul Ram who was Sen's schoolmate at St. Xaviers, Delhi, joined the band replacing Anirban Roy on bass. They started work on their first album. To their frustration, the album took about a year to get finished. But when their eponymous debut album came out in 1993, it sold over 40,000 copies within a year of its release. It became the highest selling record by any Indian band at that time.\n\nIn 1994, drummer Shaleen Sharma left the band. He was replaced by Amit Kilam who was much younger than the other band members. Barely out of his teens, he was still taking his college exams. This line-up with Susmit Sen, Asheem Chakravarty, Rahul Ram and Amit Kilam became the most recognisable and the most successful in the band's timeline so far. Since then they rolled out a live album recorded and mixed on two tracks by Vikram Mishra \"Desert Rain\" and two studio albums \"Kandisa\" and \"Jhini\". They also composed the soundtrack of \"Black Friday\" and contributed a couple of tracks to the soundtrack of \"Peepli Live\".\n\nIn December 2009 the band lost Asheem Chakravarty. He was hospitalised in Doha in October, after suffering a heart attack. He was comatose for a brief period and recovered well. On 25 December 2009 he died in New Delhi due to a cardiac arrest.\n\nIndian Ocean has so far not announced any permanent replacement for Chakravarty. However, they have brought Himanshu Joshi to fill in for Chakravarty's vocals and Tuheen Chakravarty for tabla and other percussion which Asheem Chakravarty used to play.\n\nThe band announced release of their first studio album after the death of Asheem Chakravarty, \"16/330 Khajoor Road\". The band made the whole album available for download from their site by adding one new song each month.\n\nThe album \"16/330 Khajoor Road\" was released in a two-CD pack. The album was recorded at Kshitij Studios, New Delhi and mixed by Aakash Gupta and Amit Kilam.\n\nLater in 2015, the band was highly acclaimed by the critics and audience alike for their music in the film Masaan.\n\nAsheem (1957–2009) showed his rhythmic ability at an early age, surprising musicians who learned that he never had any formal training. He quit a career in advertising, along with Susmit Sen to form Indian Ocean, where he played the tabla, tarang and other percussion instruments while also being band's vocalist. Indian Ocean fans call him \"the man with the golden voice\". He sang and played the tabla simultaneously, a difficult feat rare by Indian percussionists. His rhythm structures were unique and contributed a large part to Indian Ocean's signature sound. He improvised vocal lines while on stage and was innovative with traditional Indian percussion instruments. He was brought up in an atmosphere of Indian classical, folk and other Indian forms of music.\n\nChakravarty was hospitalised in Doha after suffering a heart attack in October and was in a state of coma for a brief period, but was recovering well. He died after suffering a cardiac arrest in New Delhi in the afternoon on 25 December 2009. He is survived by wife Sunita Chakravarty and son, Ekansh Chakravarty.\n\nAmit's drumming is a balance between the conventional and non-conventional. Largely self-taught, he believes in layering rhythm rather than a heavy drum layer, since he believes in simplicity, not technical wizardry, thus becoming the backbone of the solid sound that the band has. He incorporates Indian rhythms into his drumming in a unique fashion, moving in cycles of 8, 10, 12 14, 16, rather than simple 4/4 or ¾ styles. Not a \"psychotic drummer\", he goes easy on the skins, yet his playing is very dynamic. He was introduced to music at the age of 4 by his parents, learning the guitar (Hawaiian – Indian classical). He plays several instruments and sings also. He loves listening to various kinds of music – Hindi filmi, rock, pop – his favourites are A. R. Rahman, Trilok Gurtu and Deep Purple.\n\nRam's bass playing moves smoothly – from melodic enmeshing with vocal and guitar lines to the more standard laying of foundations over which the band soars. His stage presence is an essential part of Indian Ocean's live concerts. His vocals have a power and edge that emphasises the folk roots of the band. Rahul also does most of the talking at live shows. His experiences as an activist/supporter with the Narmada Bachao Andolan (1990–1995) and during his four years studying in the US have exposed him to a variety of musical styles from all over India and the world, and have strongly influenced his musical expression. Rahul got an M.Sc. in Chemistry from IIT Kanpur and has PhD in Environmental Toxicology from Cornell University in New York (1986–90). He's also a member of comedy group, \"Aisi Taisi Democracy\".\n\nRam and Chakravarty have also sung \"Yaara Maula\" in Anurag Kashyap's \"Gulaal\", a Hindi movie based on politics.\n\nAfter Asheem, couple of percussionists jammed with the band. But The new line up became permanent when Tuheen joined the band in 2010.\n\nFrom a college boy who travelled 40 km each side to watch the band play live, just a day before his exam, to a full-time band member his journey has been full of unexpected turns. Nikhil, an engineer by qualification, had not thought of music as a career option. He met the band in Singapore while he was studying. In 2013, he was offered to be a part of the same after Susmit Sen’s departure.\n\nNikhil Rao replaced Susmit Sen as lead guitarist in 2013.\n\nSusmit who co-founded the group, is credited to have virtually invented a new style of playing the guitar, an Indian sound where \"purity of scale reigns, strong melodic lines woven around the drone of open strings\". His guitar style formed the basis of Indian Ocean's sound. According to him, his personal vision is towards finding a new vocabulary for his music. Susmit Sen released his solo debut album \"Depths of the Ocean\" in 2011 – an album which had been in the making for the last ten years. Sen left the band in 2013 and was replaced by Nikhil Rao.\n\n\n"}
