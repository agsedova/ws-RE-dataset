{"id": "2318732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318732", "title": "Najm al-Din Razi", "text": "Najm al-Din Razi\n\nAbū Bakr 'Abdollāh b. Moḥammad b. Šahāvar b. Anūšervān al-Rāzī () commonly known by the \"laqab\", or sobriquet, of Najm al-Dīn Dāya, meaning \"wetnurse\" (573 AH/1177 – 654 AH/1256) was a 13th-century Persian Sufi from Khwarezmia. Hamid Algar, translator of the Persian \"Merṣād\" to English, states the application of \"wetnurse\" to the author of the \"Merṣād\" derives from the idea of the initiate on the Path being a newborn infant who needs suckling to survive. Dāya followed the Sufi order, Kubrawiyya, established by one of his greatest influences, Najm al-Dīn Kubrā. Dāya traveled to Kārazm and soon became a \"morīd\" (pupil, one who follows the shaykh master and learns from him, undergoing spiritual training) of Najm al-Dīn Kubrā. Kubrā then appointed Shaikh Majd al-Dīn Bagdādī as the spiritual trainer who also became Dāya's biggest influence. Dāya constantly refers to al-Dīn Bagdādī as \"our shaikh.\"\n\nWhen his master, Najm al-Dīn Kubrā, was murdered in 618/1221, Dāya fled to Hamadan, then to Ardabil, and then to Anatolia where he finally settled with a fellow contemporary master Rumi.\n\nThere he put the teachings of his master Najmeddin Kubra into a writing in Persian called by the Arabic title \"Mirṣād al-ʻibād min al-mabdaʼ ilāʼl-maʻād\" (ِِArabic: مرصاد العباد من المبدأ الی المعاد) which is shortly known as Merṣād al-ʻebād, and has gained prominence as a major reference text on Sufism and Islamic theology. The critical edition of Merṣād al-ʻebād by Mohammad-Amin Riahi was published in 1973 in Tehran and since then has been continued to be in print. This is a closely annotated scholarly edition, along with a comprehensive introduction on the life and works of Najmeddin Razi, which has been the major reference for later studies on Najmeddin Razi and Sufism. Merṣād al-ʻebād was translated by Hamid Algar into English as \"The Path of God's Bondsmen: From Origin to Return.\"\n\nDāya was born in Rey, then one of the major centers of urban life and culture in pre-Mongol Iran, in 1117. At the age of 26, Rāzī travelled through Syria, Egypt, Ḥejāz, Iraq, and Azerbaijan. He finally settled in Kārazm and soon become a morīd to Najm al-Dīn Kubrā, a mystical Sufi and founder of the Kubrawiyya Order. Rāzī was then tutored by Shaikh Majd al-Dīn Baḡdādī, who Rāzī often refers to as \"our shaikh.\" Rāzī then flees Kārazm due to Kubrā’s prophecy of a Mongol invasion. Finally, Rāzī fled Rey as well, willingly abandoning his family to the Mongol invasion. Traveling via Hamadān, Erbīl, and Diyarbekir, he reached Kayseri in central Anatolia in Ramadān 618/October 1221. Thanks to Seljuq patronage, Anatolia was a center for the cultivation of Persian literature.\n\nAt Malatya, Razi met Shaikh Sehab al-Din Abu Hafs ‘Omar al-Sohravardi, nephew of the founder of the Sohravardi order. In October 1221 he reached Kayseri. He completed the \"Merad\" at Sivas in August 1223.\n\nThe term \"Merṣād\" refers to the path from Qur'anic verse 89:14; \"Verily thy Lord watches over the path\". The divine vigilance implied here is generally taken as referring to God's omniscience of men's deeds, but it is plain that Dāya takes it in a slightly different sense, that of a protective and guarding vigilance. The second part of the title, \"men al-mabda' elā' l-ma'ād\" (\"from origin to return\") is to be found in the titles of many works that purport to treat in comprehensive fashion both cosmogony and eschatology and all that lies between.\n\nThe comprehensiveness promised in this title of the work is amply fulfilled in its text. It deals, in a systematic manner, with the origins of the various realms and orders of creation, prophethood and the different dimensions of religion, the ritual practices, mores, and institutions of Sufism, the destinations that await different classes of men in the hereafter, and the fashion in which different professions and trades may come to yield spiritual benefit and heavenly reward.\n\nA particular virtue of the book is its clear demonstration of the Qur'anic origins of Sufism. The numerous quotations from the Qur'an are not to be regarded as mere ornament, nor even as scriptural proofs adduced in support of various statements. Rather, they bear witness to the fact that for Dāya, as for other Sufis, the Qur'an constitutes a well-structured, seamless, and coherent universe. The Qur'anic verses encountered throughout the book are the loom on which it is woven, a particular sense for each verse being implied by the context in which it occurs.\n\nAnother prominent feature of the book is the frequency with which it draws parallels between the inner and the outer worlds, particularly with references to processes of growth and development i.e. seed, tree, branch, fruit; the emergence of the hen from the egg. Dāya says in his commentary of the Qur'an, \"Verily all that God created in the world of form has its like in the world of meaning; all that He created in the world of meaning- this being the hereafter- has its true essence in the world of reality, which is the uttermost unseen. Know too that of all that God created in all the worlds, a specimen and sample is present in man.\" It follows, then, that inner and unseen processes may be accurately described in terms of their outer counterparts.\nThe literary importance of the \"Merṣād\" is considerable: it ranks among the masterpieces of Persian literature, and certain sections – particularly the narrative of the creation and appointment of Adam – bear comparison with the best prose written in Persian. Dāya's choice of illustrative verses- both those of his own composition and those of his predecessors -is judicious, and makes of his work an incidental anthology of Sufi poetry, particularly quatrains.\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of the historical centres of the ancient region of Pokuttya, whose name derives from the township. \n\nKuty, which means \"angles\" or \"corners\" in Ukrainian, was first mentioned in records of 1469 as a village in the estate of Jan Odrowąż, then Polish archbishop of Lwów (now Lviv) and personal adviser to several Polish kings. Over time the settlement grew and in 1715 at the request of Jan Potocki, the voivod of Kiev, King Augustus II the Strong granted it a town charter. Two churches were founded for local Uniates and Armenians. With expansion and the proximity of Bukovina, the town became the seat of a starost in the region of Halych and an administrative centre within the Ruthenian Voivodship of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nThe town was the Fiefdom of the Potocki family until the partitions of Poland. In 1772 it came under Austrian administration and on May 1, 1782 Kuty lost its town privileges. As a result, its economic growth halted and Kuty remained a provincial backwater inhabited mostly by Jewish and Armenian merchants. Around 1850 the town was linked to the rest of Galicia by the Kołomyja-Czerniowce railway. However, as both Galicia and Bukovina were under Austrian rule, it could not capitalize on its status as a border town. From the 19th-century onwards, Kuty acquired fame as a holiday resort owing to its picturesque location, on a river surrounded by hills and blessed with a balmy climate. It was known as a fruit-growing area and associated festivals. It was home to the largest Armenian community in Poland, many of whom had settled there from Moldova.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Central Powers in 1918 the town was briefly under the control of the West Ukrainian People's Republic. After seizure by Romania Kuty returned to newly independent Polish administration. It became the most important border crossings between Poland and Romania. In 1930 the Polish Army built a new wooden bridge across the Cheremosh river. \n\nIt was in Kuty that the Polish president, Ignacy Mościcki, spent his last days in Poland before crossing the border into exile during the 1939 Polish Defensive War against the Germans and the Soviets attacking on two fronts. The town was defended by the Polish Army until September 20, 1939. Among the last soldiers to be killed by the Red Army in heavy fighting for the bridge was the notable Polish writer, Tadeusz Dołęga-Mostowicz. Except for the term of German occupation between 1941 and 1944, Kuty was annexed by the USSR in 1939 and was administered by Soviet Ukraine. In the spring of 1944 Ukrainian nationalists killed about 200 Poles and Armenians. \n\nSince 1991 Kuty has been part of independent Ukraine.\n\nIn the spring of 1942 during the German occupation, the entire Jewish population of Kuty was killed by the Nazis. Many died in the town while the rest were rounded up and deported to the ghetto in Czernowitz. Only a handful survived. \n\nIn 1849 the town had roughly 3,700 inhabitants, in 1880, 6,300 and in the late 1920s – 8,000. Of these 3,300 were Jews, 1,900 Hutsuls, 1,300 Poles and over 500 Armenians.\nIn 2001, the population was 4,272, and in 2016 ca. .\n\n\n"}

It was badly mauled during the Soviet offensive of January 1944 near Leningrad. It was later merged with the 225th Infantry Division.\n\nThe 9th \"Luftwaffe\" Field Division, one of several such divisions of the \"Luftwaffe\" (German Air Force), was formed in October 1942 in Eastern Prussia, in the Arys Troop Maneuver Area, under the command of \"Oberst\" Hans Erdmann. Intended to serve as infantry, its personnel were largely drawn from the 62nd Air Regiment. In December 1942, it was assigned to Army Group North on the Eastern Front. Posted to a sector near Leningrad, it defended its frontlines for over 12 months.\n\n\n"}

It is known for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Petersen Automotive Museum, and the Miracle Mile shopping district.\n\nAccording to the city's official community plan, the Wilshire Community Plan Area (CPA), also known as the Wilshire District, \"is bounded by Melrose Avenue and Rosewood Avenue to the north; 18th Street, Venice Boulevard and Pico Boulevard to the south; Hoover Street to the east; and the Cities of West Hollywood and Beverly Hills to the west.\" The adjacent CPAs are Hollywood to the north; South Central Los Angeles and West Adams–Leimert–Baldwin Hills to the south; Silver Lake–Echo Park–Elysian Valley and Westlake to the east; and West Los Angeles to the west.\n\nThe Wilshire area includes the neighborhoods of (roughly from east to west) Wilshire Center, Koreatown (part of which extends outside the CPA), Windsor Square, Hancock Park, Larchmont, Mid-Wilshire, Mid-City, Miracle Mile, Beverly–Fairfax, and the Carthay neighborhoods (commonly known as Carthay Circle, South Carthay, and Carthay Square).\n\nWithin the Wilshire CPA, the neighborhood of Mid-Wilshire is bounded roughly by Crenshaw Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, Fairfax Avenue, and Wilshire Boulevard. Part of Miracle Mile overlaps with Mid-Wilshire.\n\nAccording to the \"Los Angeles Times\" Mapping L.A. project, Mid-Wilshire is bounded on the north by West Third Street, on the northeast by La Brea Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard, on the east by Crenshaw Boulevard, on the south by Pico Boulevard and on the west by Fairfax Avenue.\n\nMid-Wilshire is flanked by Fairfax, Hancock Park, and Windsor Square to the north; Koreatown and Arlington Heights to the east; Mid-City to the south; and Mid-City West (Carthay and Beverly-Fairfax) to the west and northwest.\n\nMid-Wilshire includes the following neighborhoods:\n\nLittle Ethiopia is a block-long stretch of Fairfax Avenue between Olympic Boulevard and Whitworth Drive in Los Angeles, California. The area has a high concentration of Ethiopian restaurants, as well as a significant concentration of residents of Ethiopian and Eritrean ancestry.\n\nMiracle Mile is a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) stretch of Wilshire Boulevard between Fairfax and Highland Avenues. In the early 1920s, Wilshire Boulevard west of Western Avenue was an unpaved farm road, extending through dairy farms and bean fields. Developer A. W. Ross saw potential for the area and developed Wilshire as a commercial district to rival downtown Los Angeles.\n\nOxford Square is an historic neighborhood which, according to the Oxford Square Neighborhood Association, lies between Pico Boulevard and Olympic Boulevard and includes both sides of Victoria Avenue and South Windsor Boulevard.\n\nIn 1910 the neighborhood was laid out between Wilshire Boulevard on the north and Pico Street on the south, west of the Los Angeles Country Club. It was served by the Pico Street streetcar line. The unimproved lots offered by developer Emil Firth ranged from 50 to 100 feet on the street and were 171 feet deep. The streets were 70 feet wide, with 15-foot sidewalks and parkways, which were to be planted with palm trees and flowers. Ornamental electroliers were to be placed every 300 feet. Lot prices ranged from $1,000 to $2,500.\n\nEarlier, in 1907. the Harriman interests had begun a four-track subway line across Oxford Square, south of Wilshire Boulevard.\n\nIn 1991 the City Council approved a request by Oxford Square - Windsor Village residents to close 10th Street at Victoria Avenue in an effort to reduce crime in the communities after a recent outbreak of burglaries and robberies, as well as one homicide.\n\nIn February 2015 the neighborhood association was lobbying to form an Historic Preservation Overlay Zone (HPOZ). That would have put a temporary moratorium on the issuance of city building and demolition permits. Los Angeles City Council approved the HPOZ, adopting its preservation plan effective March 26, 2017.\n\nPark La Brea is an apartment complex bounded by 3rd Street on the north, Cochran Avenue on the east, Sixth Street on the south and Fairfax Avenue on the west. With 4,255 units located in eighteen 13-story towers and 31 two-story \"garden apartment buildings,\" it is the largest housing development in the United States.\n\nPark Mile is a commercial strip that lies along Wilshire Boulevard between Highland Avenue on the west, Wilton Place on the east, Sixth Street on the north and Eighth Street on the south. Some of the office buildings in the district have been designed to harmonize with the nearby Hancock Park area, with long, horizontal warm look of brick and other textures rather than a vertical high-tech design. Construction is regulated by the Park Mile Ordinance, adopted by the city in 1979. It was designed to protect the single-family nature of the residential area and to promote development that provided Park Mile with an \"image and sense of continuity.\" There is a three-story height limit along Park Mile, as well as a ban on painted signs on the outside of buildings. In 1990 a Park Mile-Wilshire District neighborhood design review board, composed of five to seven volunteers appointed by City Council members, was one of four such local boards throughout the city that oversaw architectural planning.\n\nSycamore Square is a Mid-Wilshire neighborhood located between Hancock Park to the north, Miracle Mile to the west, and Brookside to the east. It is bordered by Wilshire Boulevard to the north, Olympic Boulevard to the south, La Brea Avenue to the west, and both sides of Citrus Avenue to the east.\n\nWilshire Vista is a Neighborhood of 1700 homes. It contains two Los Angeles Cultural Historic Monuments. \n\nThe 2000 U.S. Census counted 41,683 residents in the 2.78-square-mile neighborhood—an average of 14,988 people per square mile, among the highest population densities for the city and the county. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 47,176. The median age for residents was 34, about the city's average.\n\nMid-Wilshire was said to be \"highly diverse\" when compared to the city at large. The ethnic breakdown in 2000 was whites, 33.6%; blacks, 22.7%; Latinos, 19.9%; Asians, 19.8%; and others, 3.9%. Mexico (16.1%) and Korea (24%) were the most common places of birth for the 25.1% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that was considered average for the city as a whole.\n\nThe median household income in 2008 dollars was $58,483, average for Los Angeles. The average household size of 2.1 people was low for Los Angeles. Renters occupied 78.3% of the housing units, and home- or apartment owners the rest.\n\nMid-Wilshire residents aged 25 and older holding a four-year degree amounted to 45.2% of the population in 2000, a high rate for both the city and the county.

{"id": "2318758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318758", "title": "Sacrifice (video game)", "text": "Sacrifice (video game)\n\nSacrifice is a real-time strategy video game published by Interplay Entertainment in 2000 for Microsoft Windows platform. Developed by Shiny Entertainment, the game features elements of action and other genres. Players control wizards who fight each other with spells and summoned creatures. The game was ported to Mac OS 9.2 in 2001.\n\nUnlike many of its contemporary real-time strategy games, \"Sacrifice\" places little emphasis on resource gathering and management. There is no system of workers; the players' wizards collect souls to summon creatures, and their mana—energy for casting spells—constantly regenerates. Players customize their attacks by choosing from spells and creatures aligned to five gods. To defeat an opponent, the player's wizard sacrifices a friendly unit at the opposing wizard's altar, thereby desecrating it and banishing the enemy wizard. Aside from a single-player campaign, \"Sacrifice\" offers a multiplayer mode, in which up to four players can play against each other over computer networks.\n\n\"Sacrifice\" was created by a small team of developers; most of the work was done by four key personnel. The graphic engine of the game uses tesselation: thousands of polygons are used to display an object and as lesser details are needed, the number of polygons is reduced. By adjusting the required level of detail, \"Sacrifice\" can be run on various machines with the highest possible quality of graphics. Complementing the graphics of the game were the voice work of professional actors, such as Tim Curry, and the musical compositions of Kevin Manthei. \"Sacrifice\" was praised by reviewers for the novel designs of its creatures and for its humorous content. The high level of attention needed to manage its frenetic combat was mentioned as a flaw. Despite winning several awards, \"Sacrifice\" was not a commercial success, and no sequels are planned.\n\nPublished in 2000 for the Windows 98 platform (and in the following year for Mac OS 9.2), \"Sacrifice\" is a real-time strategy video game that incorporates elements of the action genre. Players control wizards, looking over their characters from behind. Each match starts the player with a wizard and an altar. Using the keyboard and mouse, players move their wizards around a virtual world, directing armies and casting spells to eliminate their opponents. A player's wizard defeats an opponent by desecrating his or her altar through the magical \"sacrifice\" of a friendly unit.\nWizards can cast spells that harm opponents (combat spells), heal damage taken, or summon creatures. More advanced combat spells affect large areas of the battlefield, taking the form of tornadoes and volcanoes. Casting spells requires energy, which the game represents in the form of mana. Recovery of mana is slow, but a wizard accelerates the process by staying close to his or her altar. Close proximity to one of several fountains of mana scattered across the world increases his or her recovery rate as well. A wizard can monopolize a mana fountain by erecting a structure known as a manalith over it. Because mana can always be regained, it is an infinite resource. Souls are the other type of resource in this game; they are used, along with mana, to summon creatures, who form the mainstay of the players' offensive capability. Unlike mana, souls are limited in quantity. Players start with a few souls and increase their resources by locating unclaimed souls, or by converting the souls of unfriendly creatures their wizards have killed.\n\nSummoned creatures are mainly classified into three classes: melee, ranged, and air (flyers). In a rock-paper-scissors manner, each class is a counter to another. Melee creatures inflict more damage to their ranged opponents, but cannot retaliate against flyers, which in turn are vulnerable to those who can attack at range. Several creatures also have special abilities, such as creating protective magical barriers, becoming invisible, or immobilizing their opponents. Two units, manahoars and sac doctors, have special purposes. Manahoars help to recharge their summoner's mana by channeling energy from manaliths to him or her. Sac doctors are summoned to extract the souls of fallen opponents and bring them back to the altar for conversion. These units are also summoned to hold the sacrificial rituals required for desecrating enemy altars; killing a sac doctor disrupts the process.\n\nThe spells and abilities of the creatures are designed along the ethos of five gods. Persephone, the Great Healer, bestows her followers with powers of regeneration and nature. Her counterpart, Charnel, God of Strife, celebrates death and decay; his creatures are undead and his spells drains the life of others. The other three gods—James, Stratos, and Pyro—govern natural elements, granting their followers abilities associated with earth, air, and fire, respectively.\n\nUnlike other real-time strategy games released in or before 2000, \"Sacrifice\"s gameplay is not focused on large-scale management of resources and bases. Instead, the game emphasizes micromanagement of the players' units; success in the game is linked to meticulous control of individuals or small groups to overcome enemies. Players order their armies to assume formations by pressing an assigned key or navigating through a pop-up menu. The order can also be given by moving the mouse in specific patterns without waiting for the menu to appear.\n\n\"Sacrifice\"s single-player campaign begins with a meeting between the protagonist Eldred and the blind seer Mithras on a war-torn world. Through voiceovers and cut scenes rendered by the game engine, Eldred recounts to Mithras his background and the events that led to the world's current state. Eldred was a tyrannical emperor who ruled over the world of Jhera. However, his days of rule were numbered: his subjects were rebelling, and his enemies gathered at the borders of his realm. Turning to the mystical arts for a solution, Eldred summoned a demon, Marduk, to eliminate opposition to his rule. Marduk proved uncontrollable and ravaged Jhera. Eldred fled to the world that he and Mithras stand on. The world—having suffered a past cataclysm—was riven into a collection of five floating islands. A god rules over each realm, seeking to impose his or her own agenda. The rivalries among the gods are aggravated by Mithras's prophecy of a traitor amongst them. Sensing the opportunity for a new lease on life, Eldred offers his service to the gods.\n\nThe campaign spans ten missions. In each mission, the player chooses a god for Eldred to champion, receiving creatures and spells from that god. The player can build up a selection of units and spells from different gods by changing Eldred's allegiance between missions; the selections are used in later missions or multiplayer sessions. As the game progresses, the player's choices align Eldred with one god. Aside from the stated goals in each mission, there are secret objectives that if accomplished bestow bonuses to Eldred's attributes (magical and physical resistance, more mana, etc.).\n\nMidway through the campaign, Eldred encounters Marduk again. The demon taunts the wizard and announces that this world will suffer the same fate as Jhera. Eldred warns the gods; they believe one of them supports the demon and fall upon each other to eliminate the traitor. By the last stage of the campaign, Eldred has helped one god to kill the others. After the end of the wizard's narration, Mithras reveals himself as Marduk. Stratos, the traitor, had planned for the demon to appear on this world and deliver the prophecy to the gods. Marduk berates Eldred for his naivety and starts the final battle. After defeating the demon, the player chooses one of two endings for Eldred: stay and help the last god rule the world, or leave and seek his destiny in other worlds.\n\n\"Sacrifice\" features the capability for players to play matches against each other over computer networks; up to four players (human- or computer-controlled) can participate in a multiplayer match. Four modes of play are available: Skirmish, Slaughter, Soul Harvest, and Domination. Skirmish's gameplay is similar to that of the single-player mode; a player wins the match by banishing the others' wizards. The winner of Domination is the wizard who controls a certain number of manaliths. The goal in Slaughter is to amass the most kills, while wizards in Soul Harvest have to collect the most souls.\n\nInitially, the multiplayer games could only be played over small-area networks of computers (local area networks), or over the internet through an integrated matchmaking service. Later software patches added online rankings and the capability to connect computers via Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP), allowing play over the internet without the matchmaking service. The Macintosh version's matchmaking, handled by GameRanger, had to be installed through a patch. Multiplayer matches cannot be played between different computer platforms.\n\n\"Sacrifice\"s development started in August 1997. The game's lead programmer, Martin Brownlow, was inspired by \"\", which was released in 1985 for the ZX Spectrum computer. In the old game, players take turns to control wizards, summoning creatures and casting spells to eliminate each other. Shiny desired to avoid repeating the bad experience of marketing their last product \"Messiah\". Released in March 2000, the game was extravagantly promoted by Shiny during its development, and the resulting heavy scrutiny from the media greatly stressed the team who worked on the game. \"FiringSquad\" claimed that until the year of its release, no one outside the company knew of the game. However, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" printed a number of details about the game in an issue cover dated December 1997, and \"Eurogamer\" reported that \"Sacrifice\" \"has been hyped almost incessantly in the press, and if you placed every screenshot of the game which has been posted on the web end to end, they would easily reach to the moon and back.\" According to Brownlow, his team was able to concentrate on developing the game without the media or \"fan base questioning every decision that gets made along the way\".\n\nThe bulk of the work was done by a small team. Game designer Eric Flannum, formerly of Blizzard Entertainment, recalls that there were only three other key personnel: two programmers and an animator. As more game features were developed, the team expanded. Flannum was tasked to lead four level designers, and Jon Gwyn joined Joby Otero on the art team. After the basic features of the game had been completed, James Phinney, lead designer and producer of Blizzard's 1998 real-time strategy game \"StarCraft\", was hired to write the plot for the single-player campaign. His first draft was used as the script for recording placeholder voiceovers, which helped the team to judge the atmosphere in the game. Later, Shiny employed professional actors, such as Tim Curry and Brad Garrett, and various voice artists, such as Jennifer Hale, to record the final voices for the game's characters. Audio filters altered the voices for the gods, giving them a supernatural edge appropriate to their roles. For background music, Shiny hired Kevin Manthei, who had composed many scores for video games and big- and small-screen entertainment, such as \"Scream 3\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". His compositions for \"Sacrifice\" were played by an orchestra of 25 instruments. Shiny's founder, David Perry, was so busy with the game's development that he passed over the opportunity to create a video game for the science-fiction movie \"The Matrix\".\n\n\"Sacrifice\"s graphics engine was developed from \"Messiah\"s. The older game renders its characters by tesselation, using thousands of polygons to make up character models and decreasing the number of polygons when lesser details are required, such as drawing the object at a distance. A typical object in \"Sacrifice\" comprises 200 to 2,500 polygons. Shiny expanded the technology's application to the game's virtual world. The environment is not decorated with grass, flowers, and rocks by overlaying two-dimensional images of such objects on the terrain model. Instead, many tiny models of these terrain features litter the landscape. Objects in the game are composed of isosceles right triangles, each of which is infinitely divisible into two smaller isosceles right triangles. The array of infinite triangles derived from these divisions is stored in a binary triangle tree data structure, and the simplicity of the division and its data management algorithms frees up the graphic processor for other duties, allowing more resources to be spent on managing the level of detail. \"Sacrifice\"s spell effects are composed of parametric surfaces, which also can be broken down into triangles, facilitating tessellation.\nIn early 2000, the computer industry released the first video graphics cards capable of processing transform, clipping, and lighting (T&L) instructions. With the appropriate software, these new cards took over the burden of T&L processing from the computer's processor, allowing more detailed graphics and smoother animation. Shiny capitalized on the breakthrough, spending a few weeks to rewrite a portion of \"Sacrifice\"s software. Brownlow and his team refined and improved the game's graphics, increasing the number of polygons per model and setting the software to scan through scenes a few more times to determine what objects to render and how to display them. \"Sacrifice\" was acknowledged as the first game on the market to make full use of the new graphic cards (the GeForce 2 and Radeon series). Because of the adopted technology, animation in the game was smooth, without the jerkiness associated with overstressed graphical engines.\n\nFor the character models, Otero and his team eschewed conventional designs inspired by \"The Lord of the Rings\" and other fantasies. Otero's ideal was that of \"form follows function\", by which a creature's capabilities or purposes are readily apparent from its appearance. In his opinion, a creature designed to kill enemies by exploding itself would simply be a \"cartoon-ish bomb with feet\". Otero's simple designs were expanded and fleshed out in detail by Gwyn, who was also responsible for creating Eldred's model. The artists' incorporation of humor in their work did not escape the video game industry's notice; many pointed out the quirky allusion of James, God of Earth, to Earthworm Jim, star of Shiny's previous games.\n\nBy June, the major features of the game had been implemented, and Shiny proceeded to the next stage of development. It selected a thousand members of the public to participate in a beta test of \"Sacrifice\"s multiplayer modes, receiving feedback on software bugs, performance issues, and possible improvements. The game's publisher, Interplay Entertainment, assigned its quality assurance department to test the single-player mode. Perry promoted the game by visiting professional game reviewers, such as FiringSquad, and giving copies of the beta version to them. On November 17, 2000, Interplay released the game for the Windows platform. Shiny packaged a level editor, Scapex, with the finished product, allowing gamers to create their own levels. The tool displays the user's changes as they are added to the level. Users have total control over the positioning of models and scripting of events, although the tool does not provide the capability to create new spells or creatures. User-created maps can be shared with other players during the connection phase of multiplayer games.\n\nEarlier in the same month, Macintosh software publisher MacPlay announced that it was porting \"Sacrifice\" to the Apple computers. It took the company several months to adapt the source code to the Macintosh architecture, and on December 14, 2001, the Macintosh version of the game was released. It has almost the same features as the original version; however, Scapex was excluded from the port. Another feature left out was multiplayer mode, which MacPlay added through a software patch.\n\n\"Sacrifice\" was developed and released during a period of growth for the video games market; the amount United States consumers spent on video games increased from US$3.2 billion in 1995 to $6.0 billion in 2000. \"Solid\" real-time strategy games could sell more than 100,000 copies, and those that sold less than 75,000 copies were considered commercial failures by the publishers. Many real-time strategy game developers concentrated on enhancing their game's visuals without concern for innovations in gameplay. Shiny was recognized by the industry for its unconventional games, which exhibited humorous content and unique artistic designs. When it became known that the company was developing \"Sacrifice\" as its first real-time strategy game, several industry observers were keen to see whether it could deliver a quality product.\nInitial reactions were favorable. \"Sacrifice\"s art was a point of focus for reviewers: the fantasy creatures' novel designs made deep impressions on the industry. The designs were so unconventional that gaming journalist Michael Eilers remarked, \"It is as if Salvador Dalí and H. R. Giger got together and played around with 3D Studio Max for a few weeks with a cooler full of Bass Ale between them.\" To fellow journalist Kieron Gillen, \"Sacrifice\" resembled a version of the strategy game \"Command and Conquer\" as designed by Renaissance painter Hieronymus Bosch. Aside from being impressed by the details in the graphics, GameSpy's Lee Haumersen found the creatures' movements fluid and believable, remarking, \"flying dragons heave their bodies through the air reminiscent of Draco in the movie \"Dragonheart\".\" Journalist Tom Chick summed up the weird experience of seeing his wizard at the head of \"a troop of flapping, crawling, loping, whirling, hopping things\" as the essence of \"what gaming is all about.\"\n\nThe game's spell effects also elicited positive reactions. \"Next Generation\" magazines Samuel Bass called them \"awe-inspiring\", while it was \"positively breathtaking\" for Eurogamer's John Bye to see \"flaming missiles raining down on the battlefield, tornados lifting [his] men up into the sky, or the ground swelling up beneath [his wizard's] feet\". Although such effects were implemented in other games, as Gillen pointed out, it was a vastly different experience to watch them from the first person perspective. Reviewers of FiringSquad and \"PC Gamer\" were equally overwhelmed by the stunning visual effects. Despite filling the screen with \"winged, fully animated demons\" and \"multiple gigantic twisters spiraling gorgeously into the clouds\", \"Sacrifice\" performed smoothly on the reviewers' machines, impressing the staff of \"Edge\" magazine.\n\nAside from the visuals, the game's audio attracted comments. GameSpot's staff enjoyed listening to the story unfold through the recorded voices. They found that the voice actors did not overact their roles despite the extravagant appearances of the characters. Instead, the actors' performance conveyed an extra depth to the personalities of these characters. Haumersen noted a few flaws in the game's vocal presentation: the character models' lip movements did not match their speech, and they had a limited number of gestures to accompany the words. Michael House of Allgame was not altogether impressed, finding the voice acting to be \"spotty[,] ... ranging from hilarious to obnoxious.\"\n\nTo several reviewers, \"Sacrifice\" was flawed in its handling of combat. They found that the game's interface—which presented a viewpoint that looked over the wizard from behind—hindered them from having a clear picture of their characters' surroundings. The game's fast-paced combat ensured that fights tended to be messy affairs, where aside from picking out their units from a chaotic mass to issue commands, players had to see to their wizards' safety, and cast spells to support their army. Reviewers commented that once a player had lost a number of early battles, his or her army could never recover from its losses to win the match. \"Sacrifice\"s multiplayer games, as GameSpot's Sam Parker observed, tended to be long-drawn stalemates until the wizards obtained more powerful spells. \"PC Zone\"s Keith Pullin was disappointed that the game was not designed to reward tactics; in his experience, he achieved victory by continually summoning groups of creatures to attack the enemy. Bass agreed that the game was lacking in tactical play, but other aspects impressed him enough to downplay this failing in his assessment.\n\nThe intensity and excitement generated by the frenetic gameplay pleased IGN's Dan Adams, but Bye was so frustrated by his experience that he claimed to have suffered a massive increase in blood pressure. The game's heavy demand for micromanagement convinced \"Maximum PC\" to name \"Sacrifice\" the \"best argument for gamers [to grow] a third hand\", an opinion in line with Chick's comment that the interface \"[seemed] to have been designed for one of the game's 13-fingered beasts\". \"Sacrifice\"s gameplay had its supporters; the staff at \"Edge\", impressed with the game's controls and visual perspective, named it one of the \"few titles [that took] strategy into the third dimension and convincingly used the extra plane for more than a dazzling 3D makeover\".\n\nNo sales figures were released for \"Sacrifice\", but several members of the video game industry acknowledged the game did not sell well. James Bell, Infogrames's Senior Vice President of Creative Development, said that \"Sacrifice\", although an excellent game, suffered poor sales because it was badly marketed and released at the wrong time. Another reason, offered by Gillen, for \"Sacrifice\"s commercial failure was the small size of its development team. Based mostly on the efforts of four people, the game was built around their gaming preferences, failing to take into account the opinions of a wider variety; hence, the game became a niche product.\n\nImpressing IGN with its \"wonderful land full of character and imagination\", \"Sacrifice\" was the gaming site's choice for the best strategy game of 2000. It was honored in the same year by European Computer Trade Show as the Best PC Game of the Show. Since its release, \"Sacrifice\" has been one of \"PC Gamer\"s Top 100 Games for at least eight consecutive years. Looking back at the history of real-time strategy gaming, Geryk pointed out that \"Sacrifice\"s \"depth and originality\" was unparalleled in the genre and often overlooked in favor of its graphics. The staff of gaming site UGO shared a similar opinion, naming the game in 2009 as its eighteenth top strategy game of all time.\n\nAlthough \"Sacrifice\" was honored as a quality game, industry observers pointed out that its qualities were forgotten by most people; the staff of GamesRadar said the game was \"practically invisible to the gaming public\", and according to Gillen, few remembered \"Sacrifice\" as the pioneer of the mouse-gesture control system, which was praised as revolutionary in Peter Molyneux's later game \"Black & White\". Gillen further lamented that \"Sacrifice\"s release heralded the end of Shiny's forays into creative game development, as the company switched to producing more mainstream products, such as \"Enter the Matrix\". Despite receiving numerous calls for a sequel, Shiny said in 2002 that it would not produce one. Seven years later, GamesRadar repeated the call for a sequel while proclaiming \"Sacrifice\" \"one of the most underappreciated games of all time\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2318761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318761", "title": "Lego Trains", "text": "Lego Trains\n\nLego Trains is a product range and theme of the construction toy Lego, which incorporates buildable train sets. The Lego Trains theme became a sub-theme of Lego City in 2006. Products in the range have included locomotives, tracks, rolling stock, stations, signal boxes, and other track-side buildings. The theme is popular among adult fans, as well as children, and has spawned international associations and conventions. The train system is sometimes referred to as 'L-gauge' among fans, in reference to traditional model railway scales. Lego trains use a nominal gauge of 37.5mm, 5.5mm wider than O gauge, derived from a centreline gauge of 40mm (five lego studs).\n\nThe design of Lego trains has developed substantially, with several different systems introduced, with varying degrees of cross-compatibility.\n\nLego trains were first introduced in 1966 with Lego set number 080. The train sets used blue rails, and the first train sets were simply push-along. Set number 115 introduced 4.5 volt battery-operated trains (initially the battery box was handheld, but train sets soon contained a railcar that carried the battery box), and train sets numbered 720 (1969) and up operated on 12-volt electrified rails, introduced in 1969. In 1972, 4.5-volt trains gained a monolithic railcar that carried the batteries and contained both a bottom-mounted stop button to be actuated by signals, as well as a side-mounted lever for manual go/stop/back control and tripping by a track-side pivot. All three kinds (push trains, 4.5-volt battery-operated trains and 12-volt electric trains) existed next to each other and even allowed for upgrade. The motors were the same size, the push trains used a motor-shaped dummy block of bricks, and all used the same wheel style. These wheels had the same press-fit metal axles as used in the two larger sizes of rubber-tire Lego wheels, which also meant that both 4.5-volt and 12-volt motors were not restricted to use in trains. A push train could be updated to a battery-operated train, and a battery-operated train could be updated to an electric train. Since 1969 the motor housings for 4.5-volt and 12-volt are equal and can be equipped with either a 4.5-volt or 12-volt Bühler motor unit. These motor units were sold separately as a replacement part until around 1990. In or before 1976, the 4.5-volt motor gained a hole for driving the then white cross-axles of the size that would later be known as Technic. Railcars began as spartan constructions of train-specific wheels and couplers attached to car bases made from universal plates and bricks, but these were quickly replaced by black single-piece bases in two lengths that included captive wheels and couplings.\n\nIn 1980 the trains theme received a major overhaul. The builds were adapted to the minifigure, having appeared a few years earlier. The colour of the tracks was changed from blue to grey, and the 12-volt transformer changed to support utility functions in a more streamlined style with control switches that docked alongside the transformer, following the design style of increasingly streamlined model train controls of the time. The utility functions now included remotely controlled points, signals, wagon de-couplers and level crossings. The models gained a much more realistic appearance, including some with much longer carriage/wagon bodies and swivel bogies, and there were special windows which simulated having a pull-down glass section. The railcar bases were now again assembled from train-specific wheels and coupler and a greatly increased number of universal pieces.\n\nBattery-operated trains were still available. The motor was kept unchanged. Upgrading a battery-operated train to a 12-volt electric train required changes to the train to fit the smaller, redesigned 12-volt motor underneath. The fixed wheels of the new 12-volt motor were black, finalizing the color scheme that had developed in the blue-track era, where 12-volt locomotives started to be distinguished by black wheels.\n\nThe 1980 train catalog enticed Lego fans with nighttime dioramas featuring lampposts and lights inside the trains. Even though light bricks of the same size were available in both 12-volt and 4.5-volt guise, the train headlight/taillight (using unique prisms and holder bricks) and lamppost sets were normally only available with the expensive 12-volt light bricks included. Making these theoretically universal features available only as 12-volt items served to further elevate the 12-volt system away from the more limited 4.5-volt system.\n\nNotable train sets include the Electric Intercity (7740) and Steam Locomotive (7750), particularly for its large wheel pieces not found in any other set.\n\nThe 12-volt line was promoted in a 1983 UK television advert featuring a group of adults planning a 'mail train robbery'.\n\n1991 saw again a major overhaul in the train line. Tracks gained a new appearance with power being transmitted directly through metal strips on the two running rails. The new line abandoned the 12-volt power in favor of the 9-volt system to make it compatible with the battery-operated elements found in the Lego 'Light & Sound' line of sets. The remote-controlled accessories from the 12-volt system were also abandoned, with only manual point control available and no signaling capabilities. At the same time, the 9-volt train motor was made train-specific by its fixed wheels, while the similarly sized 9-volt universal motor changed from individual metal axles wheel holes to axle holes for Technic axles, for which there were no train wheels available.\n\nPrevious 12-volt locomotives were not compatible with the new system without modification, due to the change in voltage and means of powering the motor, although it was possible to retrofit them with 9-volt motors. The gauge did not change, therefore older rolling stock could still be used.\n\nThe continuing availability of the train system was thrown into doubt in 2006, with the release of the first 'remote control' train sets, which used battery-powered motors and did not have metal conducting strips in the tracks. For about a year, both systems were available, with the 9-volt system being marketed under a \"Hobby Train\" brand, available direct from Lego. By the end of 2007, the 9-volt system had been discontinued.\n\nIn 2006, Lego introduced a new line of remote control trains. In an effort to reduce the cost of the track, Lego returned to making track entirely made out of plastic (foregoing the metal rails), and introduced a new train motor powered by batteries and controlled via an infrared remote control. To enable the models to be battery-powered, the powered vehicles had a specific train base, which was 6 studs wide to accommodate a snap-fitting battery pack.\n\nThe new battery-powered system had some advantages over the 9-volt trains; it allowed more than one train to be controlled independently at once, and track layouts did not have to worry about matching up the polarity of the rails. However, the infrared remote control introduced problems of range, and the use of batteries required them to be replaced or recharged at regular intervals.\n\nThe lower production costs of the plastic track allowed Lego to introduce a new double crossover track piece (first produced in 2007, now discontinued), and the track itself was available at a cheaper price than the 9-volt track.\n\nOn 1 October 2007 Lego announced that they would discontinue both the 9-volt and the RC train formats in favour of a new system. The announcement cited a lack of sufficient demand for the 9-volt product line to be profitable, caused partly by the need to replace key machinery and place minimum orders for motors and power regulators. The new range was announced as launching in 2009, and would use the new 'Power Functions' system also used in the Technic line, which would allow the company to \"amortize the development and on going cost across multiple themes\".\n\nA new train was introduced in the summer of 2009 called the \"Emerald Night\", modelled on a steam locomotive. This train was sold without a motor as set number 10194. Necessary part numbers were listed on the rear of the box to convert the Emerald Night to a Power Functions compatible train. These parts were available separately, but mainly online. There was an additional 'collection' pack available with all the necessary parts to power the Emerald Night. These included a rechargeable battery box, a new infrared remote controller, plus a Power Functions motor and infrared receiver. Although this is a \"Power Functions\" setup, this particular setup existed only for the Emerald Night, as a new motor was in development.\n\nThe track was unchanged from the RC Trains sets, and in 2009 flexible track was introduced.\n\nFollowing the Emerald Night, the new 88002 Power Functions-compatible train motor and controller were introduced in two 2010 sets, the 7938 Passenger Train and 7939 Cargo Train. This new motor utilized the universal Power Functions connections, used by all components. The standardization of the Power Functions system meant that any of the motors in the Power Functions line could be used and builders were not limited to using a single type of motor as they had been with previous Lego train systems.\n\nIn the year 2018, Lego decided to introduce a new Power Functions system, known as Powered Up, or else Power Functions 2.0. This system was brought to replace the old Power Functions brought about in 2009. This system was introduced with the Passenger Train 60197 and the Cargo Train 60198.\n\nLego trains are popular among adult fans of Lego, and Lego Train clubs around the world.\n\nA number of these Lego train clubs exhibit large model train layouts at various community functions, train shows, and Lego conventions, such as BrickFest. Some of the largest layouts in the United States have been the result of ILTCO's lead combined efforts by several train clubs at the 2005, 2006, and 2007 National Model Railroad Association national conventions. Lego has also introduced train sets designed by members of the Lego community, for example, Santa Fe set by James Mathis, and the Train Factory set in March 2007.\n\nThe community was also supported by a magazine about Lego trains called \"Railbricks\", created by Jeramy Spurgeon and written by Lego train fans from around the world. Unfortunately, \"Railbricks\" is no longer active.\n\nA computer program called \"Track designer\" was created by Matt Bates to help fans plan track layouts. This program is no longer supported, but was the inspiration for similar programs such as TrackDraw by Cary Clark (no longer supported), and \"BlueBrick\" by Alban Nanty which is still supported at the time of writing.\n\nIn late December 2016, prominent train builder Cale Leiphart along with several others created Brick Model Railroader (BMR), which was created to replace \"Railbricks\" as a hub of the train building community. Brick Model Railroader is a news and blog site with the intention of spreading insightful ideas and techniques to all fans of Lego trains.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2318782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318782", "title": "Terminology of the British Isles", "text": "Terminology of the British Isles\n\nThe terminology of the British Isles refers to the words and phrases that are used to describe the (sometimes overlapping) geographical and political areas of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and the smaller islands which surround them. The terms are often a source of confusion, partly owing to the similarity between some of the actual words used but also because they are often used loosely. Many of the words carry geographical and political connotations which are affected by the history of the islands.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to explain the meanings of and relationships among the terms in use; many of these classifications are contentious .\n\nThe use of terms depend on context; words and phrases can be grouped into geographical, political, linguistic and sporting terms. In brief, the main terms and their simple explanations are as follows:\n\nBelow is a visual reference guide to some of the main concepts and territories described in this article:\n\n\n\n\n\"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" is the official full title of the state. This name appears on official documentation such as British passports. For convenience, the name is usually shortened to \"United Kingdom\", \"UK\" or \"Britain\".\n\nThe United Kingdom is a sovereign state. Its four constituent countries are sometimes considered to be of different status. This view may be supported by the existence of devolved governments with different levels of power in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales (see Asymmetrical federalism).\n\nWales is also often erroneously described as a principality of the United Kingdom. The title of Prince of Wales is usually given to the heir apparent to the British throne but it has no political or other role in respect of Wales. The International Organization for Standardisation (ISO) has defined Wales as a \"country\" rather than a \"principality\" since 2011, following a recommendation by the British Standards Institute and the Welsh Government.\n\nNorthern Ireland is sometimes described by United Kingdom citizens as a province of the United Kingdom, which derives from the Irish province of Ulster, of which Northern Ireland is a part. Northern Ireland also had, until 1972, a far greater degree of self-government than the other constituent parts of the UK.\n\n\"Great Britain\" is both a geographical and a political entity. Geographically, it is one island, but as a political entity it also includes the smaller offshore islands that are administered as part of its constituent nations – England, Wales and Scotland – such as England's Isle of Wight, Wales' Anglesey and Scotland's Inner Hebrides, Outer Hebrides, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands.\n\nThe abbreviation \"GB\" is sometimes officially used for the United Kingdom, for example in the Olympics, or as the vehicle registration plate country identification code for UK-registered cars \"(see also British car number plates)\". \"SCO\" in Scotland, \"CYM\" for Wales (Cymru), \"NI\" for Northern Ireland, or \"ENG\" for England can also be used.\n\nThe internet code \".gb,\" although allocated to the UK, is virtually unused and UK web domains use \".uk\".\n\nThe four constituent parts of the UK are also known, particularly in sporting contexts, as \"Home Nations\" or the \"Four Nations\". The BBC refers to its UK-wide broadcasting operation as \"Nations and Regions\" (\"regions\" referring to geographic regions of England. Thus the UK naming conventions tend towards describing distinct \"regions\" or \"nations\" which exist within a single sovereign \"state\".\n\nIn sport, the UK Nations mostly have their own separate national teams – England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, for example in football. Sporting contests between the Four Nations are known as \"Home internationals\" (an example is the British Home Championship in football).\n\nThe governing body for football in Northern Ireland is called the Irish Football Association (the IFA), having been in existence since some forty years before Partition. Its counterpart in the Republic (plus Derry City FC) is the Football Association of Ireland (the FAI). The Northern Ireland national team retained the name \"Ireland\" for some fifty years after partition. Since around 1970 the two teams have been consistently referred to as \"Northern Ireland\" and \"Republic of Ireland\" respectively. The UK competes as Great Britain at the Olympic Games. According to the Olympic Charter the Olympic Council of Ireland represents the entire island of Ireland. Olympic athletes from Northern Ireland may choose whether to represent the UK or the Republic of Ireland.\n\nSince the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent implementation legislation, sporting organisation (and several other organisations, e.g. tourism, Irish Gaelic and Ulster Scots language boards) on the island of Ireland has increasingly been cross-border.\n\nCitizens of the UK are called \"British\", \"Brits\", \"Britons\" or \"Britisher\" (archaic). The term \"Unionists\" may also be used, sometimes pejoratively, for example by supporters of Scottish independence when referring to supporters of the Union. Some older slang names for Britons are \"Tommy\" (for British soldiers) and \"Anglo\". Anglo properly refers only to England, but it is sometimes used as a broader reference as an element in compound adjectives: for example, \"Anglo-French relations\" may be used in newspaper articles when referring to relations between the political entities France and the United Kingdom. \"Anglo-Saxon\" may be used (particularly in Continental European languages) when referring to the whole English-speaking world.\n\nSince the adoption of the Constitution of Ireland in 1937, Ireland has been the English name of the state which covers approximately five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The name Éire is used when writing in Irish.\n\nSince the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, the term \"Republic of Ireland\" is the term used as the additional \"description\" of the state. This term is useful in avoiding ambiguity between the name of the island and the name of the state. However, the term \"Ireland\" is always used in formal diplomatic contexts such as the European Union or the United Nations. The passport of the Republic of Ireland bears the name \"Éire – Ireland\".\n\nBefore the introduction of the 1937 constitution and the new name, the Irish Free State occupied the same territory as the modern state of Ireland. The Irish Free State became an autonomous dominion of the British Empire in 1922 when it seceded from the United Kingdom through the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The King ceased to be its Head of State in 1936 and the state ceased to be a Dominion and left the Commonwealth in 1948.\n\nTraditionally, the island of Ireland is divided into four provinces – Leinster, Connacht, Munster and Ulster, with each of the provinces further divided into counties. The Republic of Ireland takes up 83% of the island, twenty-six of the thirty-two traditional counties of Ireland. Northern Ireland takes up the remaining area, six of the traditional nine counties of Ulster.\n\nOn the island of Ireland the naming of places often raises political issues. The usage of \"Ireland\" as the official name of the state causes offence to some Unionists in Northern Ireland, who believe it implies that the state still has a territorial claim to the whole island – the terminology of \"Republic of Ireland\" or \"Éire\" is much preferred by Northern Irish unionists when referring to that political state. Similarly, some Nationalists in Northern Ireland also prefer to reserve the usage of \"Ireland\" to refer to the whole island.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, Irishness is a highly contested identity, with fundamentally different perceptions of national identity between unionists (who generally perceive themselves as being British) and nationalists (who generally consider both communities to be part of the Irish nation).\n\nThe Republic of Ireland is often referred to by the Nationalist and Republican communities by the term \"the Twenty-six Counties\", with the connotation that the state constituted as such forms only a portion of the ideal political unit of the Irish Republic, which would consist of all of the thirty-two counties into which the island is divided. The term \"the Six Counties\" (of Northern Ireland) is also used. Other Nationalist terms in use include \"the North of Ireland\" and \"the North\". These latter are terms also used by the Irish national broadcaster RTÉ. More extreme terms for Northern Ireland include \"the occupied six counties\" or \"occupied Ireland\", which are often used by people who reject the idea of Northern Ireland as a separate entity from the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe Irish passport is available to Irish citizens and can also be applied for abroad through Irish Consular services and the local Irish Embassy. As per the Irish nationality law, any person born on the island of Ireland before 2005, or otherwise a first generation descendant of such a person, is allowed to apply for an Irish passport. As such, people born in Northern Ireland and their children may be Irish citizens and hold an Irish passport if they choose.\n\nUnder the Interpretation Act 1978 of the United Kingdom, the legal term British Islands (as opposed to the geographical term \"British Isles\") refers to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, together with the Crown dependencies: the Bailiwicks of Jersey and of Guernsey (which in turn includes the smaller islands of Alderney, Herm and Sark) in the Channel Islands; and the Isle of Man.\n\nSpecial British passports are issued to citizens of the Crown dependencies. On the front of passports issued to residents of the Crown dependencies, the words \"\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\"\" are replaced with \"\"British Islands\"\" followed by the name of the issuing state or island. This design applies to Jersey passport, Guernsey passport and Isle of Man passport. Pre-Brexit, Crown dependency also bore the title \"\"European Union\"\" for border control purposes, like UK passports. Crown dependency citizens who have no family ties to the United Kingdom were granted a special limited 'Islander Status' under EU law (article 6 of Protocol 3 in the Treaty of Accession of the UK to the European Community).\n\nSome suggest an early known for the term might be from ancient Greek writings. Though some of the original texts have been lost, excerpts were quoted or paraphrased by later authors. Parts of the Massaliote Periplus, a merchants' handbook describing searoutes of the sixth century BC, were used in translation in the writings of Avienus around AD 400. Ireland was referred to as \"Ierne\" (\"Insula sacra\", the \"sacred island\", as the Greeks interpreted it) \"inhabited by the race of \"Hiberni\"\" (\"gens hiernorum\"), and Britain as \"insula Albionum\", \"island of the Albions\". Several sources from around 150 BC to AD 70 include fragments of the travel writings of the ancient Greek Pytheas around 320 BC, use the terms \"Albion\" and \"Ierne\" and have been described as referring to the British Isles, including Ireland, as the \"Prettanic\" or \"Brettanic Islands\" () or as , literally \"the Britains\".\nGreek writers called the peoples of these islands the , later (alternative spellings of this and of all relative words have a single tau or a double nu), a name that possibly corresponds to the \"Priteni\". These names may have derived from a \"Celtic language\" term which may have reached Pytheas from the Gauls who may have used it as their term for the inhabitants of the islands.\n\nThe Romans called the inhabitants of Gaul (modern France) \"Galli\" or \"Celtae\", the latter term deriving from the Greek name for a central European people. Antiquarians of the seventeenth century who found language connections developed the idea of a race of Celts inhabiting the islands, but this term was not used by the Greeks or Romans for the inhabitants of Britain or Ireland, nor is there any record of the inhabitants of the British Isles referring to themselves as such. Nevertheless, Roman administration later incorporated the province of Britannia into the praetorian prefecture of Gaul, in common with Hispania, which had Celtiberians. Armorica, where the Bretons would settle, was part of \"Gallia Celtica\", so there were tertiary relations between the Britons and Gallic Celts at least. In addition, the Parisii of Gallia Celtica are thought to have founded Aldborough in Britain. Belgae and Silures also came from Gallic areas, although not strictly \"Celtic\", but from \"Gallia Belgica\" and \"Aquitainia\".\n\n\"Priteni\" is the source of the Welsh language term Prydain, \"Britain\", and has the same source as the Goidelic term Cruithne. The latter referred to the early Brythonic speaking inhabitants of the Scottish highlands and the north of Scotland, who are known as the Cruithne in Scottish Gaelic, and who the Romans called Picts or Caledonians.\n\nCaesar's invasions of Britain brought descriptions of the peoples of what he called \"Britannia pars interior\", \"inland Britain\", in 55 BC. Throughout Book 4 of his \"Geography\", Strabo is consistent in spelling the island Britain (transliterated) as \"Prettanikē\"; he uses the terms \"Prettans\" or \"Brettans\" loosely to refer to the islands as a group – a common generalisation used by classical geographers. For example, in Geography 2.1.18, \"…οι νοτιώτατοι των Βρεττανών βορειότεροι τούτων εισίν\" (\"…the most southern of the Brettans are further north than this\"). He was writing around AD 10, although the earliest surviving copy of his work dates from the 6th century.\nPliny the Elder writing around AD 70 uses a Latin version of the same terminology in section 4.102 of his \"Naturalis Historia\". He writes of Great Britain: \"Albion ipsi nomen fuit, cum Britanniae vocarentur omnes de quibus mox paulo dicemus.\" (\"Albion was its own name, when all [the islands] were called the Britannias; I will speak of them in a moment\"). In the following section, 4.103, Pliny enumerates the islands he considers to make up the Britannias, listing Great Britain, Ireland, and many smaller islands.\nIn his \"Geography\" written in the mid 2nd century and probably describing the position around AD 100, Ptolemy includes both Great Britain (Albion) and Ireland (Iwernia) in the so called \"Bretanic\" island group. He entitles Book II, Chapter 1 of as \"Iwernia, Bretanic Island\", and Chapter 2 as \"Alwion [sic], Bretanic Island\".\n\nThe name \"Albion\" for Great Britain fell from favour, and the island was described in Greek as Πρεττανία or Βρεττανία, in Latin \"Britannia\", an inhabitant as Βρεττανός, \"Britannus\", with the adjective Βρεττανικός, \"Britannicus\", equating to \"British\". With the Roman conquest of Britain the name Britannia was used for the province of Roman Britain. The Emperor Claudius was honoured with the agnomen \"Britannicus\" as if he were the conqueror, and coins were struck from AD 46 inscribed or . With the visit of Hadrian in AD 121 coins introduced a female figure with the label as a personification or goddess of the place. These and later Roman coins introduced the seated figure of Britannia which would be reintroduced in the 17th century.\n\nIn the later years of Roman rule Britons who left Latin inscriptions, both at home and elsewhere in the Empire, often described themselves as \"Brittanus\" or \"Britto\", and where describing their citizenship gave it as \"cives\" of a British tribe or of a \"patria\" (homeland) of \"Britannia\", not \"Roma\". From the 4th century, many Britons migrated from Roman Britain across the English Channel and founded Brittany.\n\nWhile Latin remained the language of learning, from the early mediaeval period records begin to appear in native languages. The earliest indigenous source to use a collective term for the archipelago is the \"Life of Saint Columba\", a hagiography recording the missionary activities of the sixth century Irish monk Saint Columba among the peoples of what is now Scotland. It was written in the late seventh century by Adomnán of Iona, an Irish monk living on the Inner Hebridean island. The collective term for the archipelago used within this work is Oceani Insulae meaning \"Islands of the Ocean\" (Book 2, 46 in the Sharpe edition = Book 2, 47 in Reeves edition), it is used sparingly and no \"Priteni\"-derived collective reference is made.\n\nAnother early native source to use a collective term is the \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\" of Bede written in the early eighth century. The collective term for the archipelago used within this work is \"insularum\" meaning \"islands\" (Book 1, 8) and it too is used sparingly. He stated that Britain \"studies and confesses one and the same knowledge of the highest truth in the tongues of five nations, namely the Angles, the Britons, the Scots, the Picts, and the Latins\", distinguishing between the Brythonic languages of the \"ancient Britons\" or Old Welsh speakers and other language groups.\n\nBrythonic, Saxon and Viking kingdoms such as Strathclyde, Wessex, and Jórvík amalgamated, leading to the formation of Scotland, and England. Wales was sometimes united under princes or kings such as Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. Between 854 and 1171, a kingship of Ireland was established by kings of the regional kingdoms such as Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, and Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, something not achieved in Britain until 1707. In subsequent Norman Ireland, local lords gained considerable autonomy from the Lordship of Ireland until it became the Kingdom of Ireland under direct English rule.\n\nAbraham Ortelius makes clear his understanding that England, Scotland and Ireland were politically separate in 1570 by the full title of his map: \"Angliae, Scotiae et Hiberniae, sive Britannicar. insularum descriptio\" ('A representation of England, Scotland and Ireland, or the Britannic islands'). George Lily's 1546 map divides Britain into the two kingdoms of England and Scotland, with Ireland alongside. Some maps from this period also appear to mark Wales, and sometimes Cornwall, as separate areas within Britain, while the history of England created by Polydore Vergil for Henry VIII states, \"The whole country of Britain is divided into four parts, whereof the one is inhabited by Englishmen, the other of Scots, the third Welshmen and the fourth of Cornish people.\"\n\nMaps of the Mediaeval, Renaissance and later periods often referred to \"Albion\". This archaic term was originally used by Ptolemy and Pliny to mean the island of Great Britain. In later centuries its meaning changed to refer only to the area we now call Scotland (\"Albany\", or \"Alba\" in Gaelic). \"Albion\" has survived as a poetic name for Britain but it is not in everyday use.\n\nFollowing the Acts of Union 1707, a fashion arose, particularly in Scotland, for referring to Scotland and England as \"North Britain\" and \"South Britain\" respectively. These terms gained in popularity during the 19th century. The most lasting example of this usage was in the name of the North British Railway, which became part of the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923, and in the name of the North British Hotel, built by the railway in Edinburgh in 1902, which retained the name until it reopened in 1991 as the Balmoral Hotel.\n\nThe diagram on the right gives an indication of the further evolution of kingdoms and states. In 1603 the Scottish King James VI inherited the English throne as \"James I of England\". He styled himself as \"James I of Great Britain\", although both states retained their sovereignty and independent parliaments, the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England. (The term \"Great Britain\" itself reportedly dates from as early as 1474, and was in common usage from the mid-16th century onwards.)\n\nThe 1707 Act of Union united England and Scotland in the Kingdom of Great Britain under the Parliament of Great Britain, then in 1800 Ireland was brought under British government control by the Act of Union creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Irish unrest culminated in the Irish War of Independence and the 1922 separation of the Irish Free State, which later became a republic with the name Ireland. The majority Protestant northeast continued to be part of what became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nBritish overseas territories such as Bermuda, Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands have various relationships with the UK. The Commonwealth of Nations, initially formalised in 1931 (the British Commonwealth until 1949), is an association of independent states roughly corresponding to the former British Empire. (This has no connection with the Commonwealth of England, a short-lived republic replacing the previous kingdoms during the English Interregnum (1649–1660).)\n\nThe adjectives used to describe the contents and attributes of the various constituent parts of the British Isles also cause confusion.\n\nIn the absence of a single adjective to refer to the United Kingdom, \"British\" is generally used to refer to the United Kingdom as a whole. However, in a specifically physical geographical sense, \"British\" is used to refer to the island of Great Britain. The adjectival phrase \"Great British\" is very rarely used to refer to Great Britain, other than to contrive a pun on the word \"great\", as in \"Great British Food\".\n\n\"Irish\", refers to people or a characteristic \"of Ireland\". As such, its meaning is contextual on the meaning of \"Ireland\" being used: it can relate both to the Irish state, and to the island of Ireland. Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, can thus be both \"British\" or \"Irish\", reflected in the ability for residents of Northern Ireland to take either British or Irish citizenship. In order to be more specific, \"Northern Irish\" is therefore in common usage. Members of the Nationalist communities would not describe themselves as \"British\" and would only use the terms \"Irish\", or specifically \"Northern Irish\" where needed.\n\nThe term \"Ulster\" can also be used as an adjective (e.g. \"Royal Ulster Constabulary\"), but this is more likely to be used by Unionists and has political connotations in the same fashion as its use as a proper noun (because only six of the traditional nine counties of Ulster, namely Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone, are included in Northern Ireland with the remaining three counties Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan forming part of the Republic). The term \"Ulsterman\" (or \"Ulsterwoman\") is common and holds no such political connotation. Likewise, Nationalists might describe, say, a lake in Northern Ireland as \"Irish\".\n\nNote that the geographical term Irish Sea thus far appears to have escaped political connotations, even though territorial control of the waters of the Irish Sea is divided between both the Republic of Ireland and the UK, and also includes a British Crown dependency, the Isle of Man—as yet there appears to be no controversy with the term’s usage to mirror that of \"British Isles\". The \"Northern\" in \"Northern Ireland\" is not completely accurate. The most northerly point on the island, Malin Head, is in the Republic of Ireland—in County Donegal's Inishowen Peninsula.\n\nThe dictionary definition of British Isles is that it is a geographical term that refers to the whole of Ireland and Great Britain as well as the surrounding islands. It is sometimes incorrectly used as if identical to the UK; or to refer to Great Britain and the surrounding islands, excluding the island of Ireland entirely. The BBC and \"The Times\" have style guides that mandate the dictionary definition but occasional misuse can be found on their web sites.\n\nThe term \"British Isles\" can also be considered irritating or offensive by some on the grounds that the modern association of the term \"British\" with the United Kingdom makes its application to Ireland inappropriate.\n\nThe term \"British Isles\" can also be considered to imply a proprietary title on the entire archipelago.\n\nThe policy of the government of Ireland is that no branch of government should use the term, and although it is on occasion used in a geographical sense in Irish parliamentary debates, this is often done in a way that excludes the Republic of Ireland. In October 2006, \"The Times\" quoted a spokesman for the Irish Embassy in London as saying that they would discourage its use.\n\nDuring a stop-over visit to the Republic of Ireland in 1989, the leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, indicated that he assumed Ireland's head of state was Queen Elizabeth II, given that she was the British Queen and his officials said that Ireland was a part of the British Isles.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, some nationalists reject the term and instead use \"these islands\", \"these isles\" or \"Britain and Ireland\" as an alternative.\n\nThere have been several suggestions for replacements for the term \"British Isles\". Although there is no single accepted replacement, the terms \"Great Britain and Ireland\", \"The British Isles and Ireland\" and \"Britain and Ireland\" are all used.\n\nThe word \"England\" is often used synecdochically to refer to Great Britain—or the United Kingdom as a whole—which often causes offence, particularly to those from the non-English parts of Britain. In a similar way, references to England as an island, to an \"English passport\", or to Scottish or Welsh places as being in England are examples of this usage of the term \"England\".\n\nBecause of the offence likely to be taken by Scots, Welsh and Irish at this usage, most politicians and official figures have avoided this usage since the early 20th century. However, there are frequent examples of this usage from earlier times. For a long time it was common for fans of the England football team to wave the British Union Flag—with the use of the specifically English St George's Cross flag only gaining popularity at the Euro 96 tournament.\n\nThe colloquial usage of \"England\" as a synonym for \"Britain\" is still widespread outside the UK. In Germany, the term \"England\" is often used to mean Great Britain or even the entire United Kingdom. In many other languages, such as Chinese, Japanese or Korean, the word for \"English\" is synonymous with \"British\"—see the article on Alternative words for British for more detail.\n\nThe term \"Europe\" may be used in one of several different contexts by British and Irish people: either to refer to the whole of the European continent, to refer to only to Mainland Europe, sometimes called \"continental Europe\" or simply \"the Continent\" by some people in the archipelago. \"Europe\" may also be used in reference to the European Union (or, historically, to the European Economic Community). A comedic treatment of the different uses of this word appears in an episode of the BBC sitcom \"To the Manor Born\". When tradesmen are taking measurements in metric, and Audrey fforbes-Hamilton objects on the grounds that the house was built \"in feet and inches\", a tradesman says \"We're in Europe now\", referring to the European Economic Community. Audrey fforbes-Hamilton retorts \"Well you may be, but I'm staying here!\" - implying that to her, the word \"Europe\" referred only to mainland Europe, excluding Britain and Ireland.\n\nThe word \"Great\" means \"larger\", in comparison with Brittany in modern-day France. One historical term for the peninsula in France that largely corresponds to the modern French province is \"Lesser\" or \"Little Britain\". That region was settled by many British immigrants during the period of Anglo-Saxon migration into Britain, and named \"Little Britain\" by them. The French term \"Bretagne\" now refers to the French \"Little Britain\", not to the British \"Great Britain\", which in French is called \"Grande-Bretagne\". In classical times, the Graeco-Roman geographer Ptolemy in his \"Almagest\" also called the larger island \"megale Brettania\" (great Britain). At that time, it was in contrast to the smaller island of Ireland, which he called \"mikra Brettania\" (little Britain). In his later work \"Geography\", Ptolemy refers to Great Britain as \"Albion\" and to Ireland as \"Iwernia\". These \"new\" names were likely to have been the native names for the islands at the time. The earlier names, in contrast, were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made.\n\nThe word \"Britain\" is ambiguous, being used variously to mean Great Britain, the United Kingdom, and for some, England. Use of \"Britain\" can be contentious, with many people in Northern Ireland objecting to its application to their province. While some organisations including the BBC and British Government prefer to use \"Britain\" as shorthand for Great Britain, others prefer, where precision is not required, to use \"Britain\" to mean the United Kingdom.\n\nThe word \"Ireland\" has two meanings.\n\n\nThe terminology and usage of the name \"Ulster\" in Irish and British culture varies. Many within the unionist community and much of the UK press refer to Northern Ireland as \"Ulster\"whereas the nationalist community refer to the traditional Irish province of Ulster, which is a nine-county entity that incorporates the three counties of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan (which are in the Republic) along with the counties of Armagh, Antrim, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone in Northern Ireland.\n\nThus, the word \"Ulster\" has two usages:\n\nThe Isle of Man and the two bailiwicks of the Channel Islands are Crown dependencies; that is, non-sovereign nations, self-governing but whose sovereignty is held by the British Crown. They control their own internal affairs, but not their defence or foreign relations. They are not part of the United Kingdom or part of the European Union.\n\nThere are five Celtic languages in current use in the region. Each has names for the islands and countries of the British Isles. They are divided into two branches:\n\nSome of the above are:\n\nThe English word \"Welsh\" is from a common Germanic root meaning \"Romanised foreigner\" (cognate with Wallonia and Wallachia, and also cognate with the word used in Mediaeval German to refer to the French and Italians).\n\nThe English names \"Albion\" and \"Albany\" are related to \"Alba\" and used poetically for either England or Scotland, or the whole island of Great Britain.\n\nEnglish \"Erin\" is a poetic name for Ireland derived from \"Éire\" (or rather, from its dative form \"Éirinn\").\n\nIn Irish, the term \"Oileáin Bhriotanacha\" is a translation of the English term \"British Isles\". Another translation is \"Oileáin Bhreataineacha\", which was used in the 1937 translation from English to Irish of a 1931 geography book.\n\nEarlier dictionaries give \"Oileáin Iarthair Eorpa\" as the translation, literally meaning \"West European Isles\". Today the most common term \"Éire agus an Bhreatain Mhór\" is used, meaning literally as \"Ireland and Great Britain\", as provided by terminological dictionaries.\n\n\"Blighty\" is a slang word for Britain derived from the Hindustani word \"bilāyatī\" (\"foreign\"). Depending on the user, it is meant either affectionately or archly. It was often used by British soldiers abroad in the First World War to refer to home.\n\n"}

Written by David Fury and directed by James A. Contner, it was originally broadcast on October 12, 1999 on the WB network. In \"Lonely Heart\", Angel Investigations looks into a series of killings linked to a trendy L.A. singles club. While there, Angel (David Boreanaz) meets Kate Lockley (Elisabeth Röhm), an LAPD detective also tracking the serial killer - who believes, because of circumstantial evidence, that the murderer is Angel himself. After discovering the murderer is actually a body-hopping demon, Angel seeks Kate's help in tracking down the bartender, now possessed by the demon, and killing him. Kate, believing the bartender committed the murders, accepts a provisional truce with a circumspect Angel.\n\nFury wrote this script to replace \"Corrupt,\" which introduced a darker characterization of Kate Lockley.\n\nAt the office, Angel sits in the dark, alone. He blinks when the lights come on and Doyle arrives, with a Friday-night plan for the three of them to go out together. He wants Angel to get out but also wants him to put in a good word for him with Cordelia without letting her know he's half-demon. Shortly after Cordelia arrives with a box of the calling cards she had printed up for Angel Investigations. Doyle is seized by a vision of a night club, and they all go to the club.\n\nMeanwhile at D'Oblique, the club in Doyle's vision, the lonely and desperate Sharon and Kevin meet and leave the club together, just after the Angel Investigations team arrives. Cordelia immediately begins to pass around Angel's business cards until Doyle stops her, cautioning her to stay \"under the radar\". Angel makes no progress with people near the bar or the bartender until a woman named Kate asks if he's all right. They awkwardly strike up a conversation, and despite a slow start, Angel and Kate find they have some things in common. Across the room, a guy mockingly speculates that the AI calling cards give Cordelia's number for services of a more personal kind. Cordelia is indignant and Doyle tries to stand up for her, but the guy is backed up by his friend, so Doyle stops negotiating and wades in. Having just declined Kate's invitation to go someplace quieter (making Kate suddenly very frosty), Angel charges into the fight and thrashes both guys, before the bartender kicks the guys out.\n\nThe next morning after spending the night with Kevin, Sharon calmly gets dressed, unperturbed by the bloody sheets and Kevin's dead body on the bed. At the office, the team spends the day researching any past incidents connected to D'Oblique. Their search turns up a badly mutilated woman and an eviscerated man. While Doyle and Cordelia look for more links, Angel goes back to D'Oblique to see if he can spot the killer. On his way in, Angel bumps into Kate, who takes umbrage when he tries to warn her of a suspiciously non-specific danger. Inside, Angel finds out that Kevin disappeared after going home with Sharon. He finds her in the phone book and runs straight to her place to try to prevent the next murder. Angel arrives at the apartment just in time to see that Sharon is dead while Neil, the geeky guy she took home, is alive and hosting a parasitic demon. Angel and the demon fight, but it gets away just as Kate arrives and finds Angel at the crime scene. Pulling a gun on Angel, Kate reveals she's a detective with the LAPD, and tries to arrest him. Knowing Kate won't be convinced he's not the killer, Angel breaks away and dives out the third floor window. Meanwhile, the demon goes back to D'Oblique. As dawn approaches, Angel makes his way to Cordelia's dingy apartment, not knowing that Kate has gone to illegally search his own place. Waking Cordelia and Doyle, Angel asks them to research eviscerating burrowers—demons that move from body to body, endlessly seeking the perfect one to live in forever. They discover their burrower is vulnerable to fire. Seeking help to destroy the powerful demon, Angel calls Kate and requests a meeting to prove that he isn't the killer. That night at the club, Kate asks the bartender to notify her when Angel arrives. A few minutes later the bartender tells Kate he thinks Angel is out back but, when they get there, the bartender smashes a wine bottle into the back of Kate's head. Angel arrives just in time to keep the burrower demon from transferring to Kate's body, forcing it back inside the bartender. Though weakening, the bartender host is still strong enough to fight Angel until Kate recovers. Then, not wanting to deal with them both at once, the demon tosses Kate and Angel down into the basement and locks them in.\n\nWhile the demon cruises for a fresh, undamaged body, Kate and Angel escape the basement and split up to search. Angel locates the bartender first and again battles the demon in its bartender host, which is still strong enough to injure Angel. Angel barely manages to throw the demon into a nearby burn barrel before collapsing to the pavement. Engulfed in flames and howling, the demon lurches purposefully toward Angel, who is on the ground and unable to move. Circling back, Kate arrives just in time to shoot the bartender, knocking him to the ground and halting the attack on Angel. After more police and emergency services arrive on scene, Kate gets a moment alone with Angel. She admits that she never would have guessed the bartender was the killer and thanks Angel for saving her life earlier. Agreeing that the bartender had ample opportunity, Angel makes no mention of a body-hopping, parasitic demon being the real killer. After Angel thanks Kate for saving his life as well, she apologizes for searching his apartment. She wants the two of them to start over from the beginning with no secrets between them; Angel pauses almost imperceptibly, then agrees. He offers her his new business card and invites her to call if she has future problems, then characteristically disappears when her back is turned.\n\nAt the office, Angel generously and very awkwardly suggests that the three of them go out together, but is deeply relieved and gratified when Cordelia and Doyle instead take pity on him and leave him to brood in the dark, alone.\n\nSpecial effects supervisor Loni Peristere explains that to get the effect of the demon burrowing through the characters' bodies, Dave Miller built a prosthetic back to identically match the actor. \"We shot the actor doing his action with tracking points, little marks on his back, and I just soft edged, matted and tracked in a locked-off version of the actors back with the burrowing demon and stuck it on there,\" Peristere says.\n\nDavid Boreanaz's stunt double, Mike Massa, says the scene in which he is tossed across the room upside down is his favorite stunt of this season. To get the effect, he was shot across the room using an air ram. \"The reason I like it so much is because it really knocked the heck out of me,\" he says. \"It was 900 pounds of thrust on the air-ram. I had to hit the corner just right. If I was off, if I hit dead center of the corner with my shoulders spread it could have broken a collarbone. I had to hit it sideways, my back flat to the wall and kind of skip into it, but it just pile drove me right to the ground.\" Director Jim Contner \"was jumping up and down... He thought that was the best stunt he'd ever seen.\"\n\nIn an essay examining the use of cinematic effects of time on \"Angel\", Tammy Kinsey points out Doyle's visions are depicted on film for the first time in this episode. Although short and simple compared to later visions, the quick cuts and flashes of light establish the aesthetic approach of \"Angel\" compared to the more conventionally filmed \"Buffy\".\n\nDavid Fury wrote this episode to replace his original script, titled \"Corrupt\", which also introduces the character of Kate. However, in Fury's first script, Kate had a crack cocaine addiction and worked undercover as a prostitute. Producer Tim Minear says the episode was \"a little bit too hopeless, a little too grim\"; after the WB Network rejected the episode it was completely rewritten.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This was where fighters were given their start to become famous depending on how well they fare on \"BAD\" they might have a title fight on \"World Championship Boxing\" or could fall back (Ex: Jason Litzau had many entertaining fights on ESPN before moving up to \"BAD\" to face Jose Hernandez. After Litzau lost by knockout he returned to \"FNF\")\n\nIt usually aired at least once a month, following a \"World Championship Boxing\" card on HBO. \"Boxing After Dark\" debuted on HBO Canada beginning January 17, 2009 at 9:45 pm. ET/7:45 pm. MT\n\n\"Boxing After Dark\", or \"BAD\" for short, got its start on February 3, 1996 with commentators Jim Lampley and Larry Merchant. The first fight shown was an exciting 12-rounder featuring a then-unknown Marco Antonio Barrera and Kennedy McKinney. Barrera won by KO. Since then, \"BAD\" has prided itself on promoting fights between lesser-caliber fighters with something to prove, though occasionally well-known fighters, usually those signed by HBO, may make appearances.\n\nIn 2006, \"BAD\" entered its tenth season with an all-new lineup. Lampley and Merchant would now call only \"WCB\" and pay-per-view fights. Replacing them were Fran Charles, former ESPN and Fox Sports Net analyst Max Kellerman who received \"something in the neighborhood of $10,000 for each \"Boxing After Dark\" telecast\" (according to Thomas Hauser) and former world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis. Kellerman and Lewis had previously appeared on world championship and pay-per-view events for HBO as analysts and continue to do so. This season has featured mostly fights at lesser weights, a \"BAD\" staple, as well as new theme music and logo.

Lampley has also on occasion stepped in for Charles.\n\nBeginning in 2013, the teams for \"BAD\" and \"World Championship Boxing\" became identical.

In 1988, future Big Mountain frontman Joaquin \"Quino\" (pronounced \"Kino\") McWhinney joined as the lead singer of the band Shiloh. Quino is of Mexican/Irish heritage, and several members of his family were mariachi musicians. His interest in reggae began after seeing a documentary about Bob Marley and Rastafari. In 1989, Shiloh secured their first record deal and put out one album titled \"California Reggae\". In 1991, the band changed the name to Big Mountain which was the name of a Native American reservation in Arizona. The original line-up was a sextet consisting of Quino (vocals), Lynn Copeland (bass), Gregory Blakney (drums), Jerome Cruz (guitar), Manfred Reinke (keyboards), and Lance Rhodes (drums).\n\nThe band first reached the charts with the song \"Touch My Light\" in spring 1993, a song taken from their debut album \"Wake Up\". Prior to the band recording their second album, \"Unity\", in 1994, Blakney, Cruz, Reinke, and Rhodes all departed the band, with McWhinney and Copeland finding replacements in Jamaican duo Tony Chin (guitar) and Carlton \"Santa\" Davis (drums), along with keyboard players Michael Hyde and Billy \"Bones\" Stoll, and percussionist James McWhinney. Following this lineup change, the band went on to receive major airplay on mainstream radio stations. \"Baby, I Love Your Way\" was included on the soundtrack for the film \"Reality Bites\", and peaked at No. 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, and its follow-up, \"Sweet Sensual Love\" reached No. 51 in the UK, whilst \"Unity\" went on to sell over a million copies worldwide. Big Mountain's follow up single \"Get Together\" became a top five hit in Brazil and Norway.\n\nThe band appeared at both the 1994 and 1995 Reggae Sunsplash festivals in Jamaica. In 1998 Jamaican drummer/producer Paul \"Groove Galore\" Kastick replaced Carlton \"Santa\" Davis as full-time drummer and primary producer in the group. Kastick spearheaded the production on the next six Big Mountain albums, spanning from 1998 and 2007. After 10 consecutive years of touring, Big Mountain decided to take a break in 2005. During this time, Quino McWhinney started to teach at Olympian High School, which received the highest test scores on their CAHSEE exams during his tenure. During the period between 2005 and 2013, Big Mountain would occasionally reunite for primarily international live performances and various benefit causes. In 2013, Quino, Hyde, and Kastick reformed the band with an extended lineup including Carlos Arias (bass), Richard \"Goofy\" Campbell (keyboards), Reggie Griffin (guitar, saxophone), Stephen Kamada (guitar), Danny Lopilato (guitar, vocals), Tim Pacheco (percussion, vocals). Further lineup changes have ensued, and the band now consists of Quino and James Mcwhinney, Paul Kastick, Goofy Campbell, Chizzy Chisholm and Michael (Mikey) Ortiz. In May 2016 the band released their first album in 14 years, \"Perfect Summer\".\n\nCurrent members\n\nFormer members\n"}

If the assumption holds, many aspects of daily human life can be understood in terms of these results. The naturalization of sunlight helps our bodies to stay awake and keep motivated. The darkness that comes with night tells our body to slow down for the day and get some rest. The ability to survive comes with generality. Experiments have been done to test inescapability and insolubility.\n\nFergus Lowe has questioned the generality of schedule effects in cases of fixed-interval performance among humans and non-humans.\n\nThe ability to generalize information from one situation to another is a function of several factors: the reliability of the original information; the paradigm's validity; one's understanding of the paradigm, the true determinants of the behavior, and the relevant details of the situations in question; and the similarity between the original source of the data and the situation to which it is to be applied.\n\nThere are both similarities and differences between the terms \"stimulus generalization\" and \"generality of a functional relationship.\" Stimulus generalization is the description of the fact that an organism behaves in a similar way to similar stimuli, and that the more different the stimuli, the more different the behavior. The generality of a finding refers to the degree to which a functional relationship obtained in one situation is able to predict the obtained relationship in a new situation.\n\n\"Generality\" refers more to functional relationships than individual events. That responses occur to X about the same as to Z is irrelevant; rather, that distributed practice helps in learning nonsense syllables and in learning other tasks.\n"}
{"id": "2318833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318833", "title": "The Haunter of the Dark", "text": "The Haunter of the Dark\n\n\"The Haunter of the Dark\" is a horror short story by American author H. P. Lovecraft, written between 5–9 November 1935 and published in the December 1936 edition of \"Weird Tales\" (Vol. 28, No. 5, p. 538–53). It was the last-written of the author's known works, and is part of the Cthulhu Mythos. The epigraph to the story is the second stanza of Lovecraft's 1917 poem \"Nemesis\".\n\nThe story is a sequel to \"The Shambler from the Stars\", by Robert Bloch. Bloch wrote a third story in the sequence, \"The Shadow from the Steeple\", in 1950.\n\nIn Providence, Rhode Island, Robert Blake, a young writer with an interest in the occult, becomes fascinated by a large disused church on Federal Hill which he can see from his lodgings on the city's Upper East side. His researches reveal that the church has a sinister history involving a cult called the Church of Starry Wisdom and is dreaded by the local migrant inhabitants as being haunted by a primeval evil.\n\nBlake enters the church and ascends the tower, where he discovers the skeleton of Edwin M. Lillibridge, a reporter who disappeared in 1893. Blake also discovers an ancient stone artifact known as the \"Shining Trapezohedron\" which has the property of being able to summon a terrible being from the depths of time and space. The trapezohedron rests in a metal box with a hinged lid; the box is incised with designs representing living but distinctly alien creatures. The whole sits atop a column which is also incised with alien designs or characters. Blake's interference inadvertently summons the malign being of the title, and he leaves the church aware that he has caused some mischief.\n\nThe being can only go abroad in darkness, and is hence constrained to the tower at night by the presence of the lights of the city. However, when the city's electrical power is weakened during a thunderstorm, the local people are terrified by the sounds coming from the church and call on their Catholic priests to lead prayers against the demon. Blake, aware of what he has let loose, is also terrified and prays for the power to remain on. However, a power outage occurs and the being flies towards Blake's quarters. He is subsequently found dead, staring out of his window at the church with a look of horror on his face. His last words refer to his perception of the approaching being. \"I see it-- coming here-- hell-wind-- titan-blur-- black wings-- Yog-Sothoth save me-- the three-lobed burning eye...\"\n\nRobert Harrison Blake is a fictional horror writer who first appears, unnamed, in Robert Bloch's 1935 story \"The Shambler from the Stars\". In Lovecraft's sequel, Blake dies while investigating the Starry Wisdom cult of Enoch Bowen. Lovecraft modeled Blake on Bloch, but also gave him characteristics that evoke Clark Ashton Smith and Lovecraft himself.\n\nLovecraft indicated in his letters with then-young writer Robert Bloch, that the character Robert Blake was an intentionally thinly veiled gesture at killing off one of his friendly correspondents. In 1936, Bloch published a story that continued the professional fun, in which Blake did not actually die, but was possessed by Nyarlathotep, and kills off a character based on Lovecraft.\n\nBlake's death is the starting point for another sequel by Bloch, \"The Shadow from the Steeple\" (1950). Blake's fiction is referred to in Ramsey Campbell's “The Franklyn Paragraphs” (1973) and Philip José Farmer's “The Freshman” (1979).\n\nLovecraft's tale names five stories written by Robert Blake: \"The Burrowers Beneath\"; \"Shaggai\"; \"The Stairs in the Crypt\"; \"In the Vale of Pnath\" and \"The Feaster from the Stars\" which as Robert M. Price has pointed out are friendly spoofs of tales written by Robert Bloch (for more info see Price's anthology \"The Book Eibon\" (Chaosium, 2002, p. 191)). Author Lin Carter wrote stories which are pastiches of either Lovecraft or Clark Ashton Smith utilising all five titles. Shaggai is mentioned in \"The Haunter of the Dark\" as a planet more distant from Earth than Yuggoth; this may suggest that Blake's writing of a story with that title is a foreshadowing of his mental link with the 'Haunter', which Blake believes to be an avatar of Nyarlathotep.\n\nBrian Lumley borrowed the title \"The Burrowers Beneath\" for his first novel (1974). Fritz Leiber also used the title \"The Burrower Beneath\" for a story which became \"The Tunneler Below\" and finally \"The Terror from the Depths\" (in \"Disciples of Cthulhu\" Cthulhu Mythos anthology). Robert M. Price has also used the title \"The Burrower Beneath\" for a story set in the Eibonic mythos of Clark Ashton Smith - see Price's anthology \"The Book of Eibon\" (Chaosium, 2002).\n\nLeigh Blackmore's poem \"The Conjuration\" (in his collection \"Spores from Sharnoth and Other Madnesses\", P'rea Press, 2008) was inspired by the title \"The Feaster from the Stars\". Blackmore's story \"The Stairs in the Crypt\" (not to be confused with Lin Carter's story of the same title) was also inspired by the name of Robert Blake's tale.\n\n\nLovecraft wrote this tale as a reply to \"The Shambler from the Stars\" (1935) by Robert Bloch, in which Bloch kills the Lovecraft-inspired character. Lovecraft returned the favor in this tale, killing off Robert Harrison Blake (aka Robert Bloch). Bloch later wrote a third story, \"The Shadow from the Steeple\" (1950), to create a trilogy.\n\nSeveral of the surface details of the plot were taken directly from Hanns Heinz Ewers' \"The Spider\", which Lovecraft read in Dashiell Hammett's anthology \"Creeps By Night\" (1931).\n\nIn Blake's final notes, he refers to \"Roderick Usher\", an allusion to Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\", which Lovecraft described in \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\" as featuring \"an abnormally linked trinity of entities...a brother, his twin sister, and their incredibly ancient house all sharing a single soul and meeting one common dissolution at the same moment.\" \"An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia\" suggests that this interpretation is the key to understanding the ending of \"The Haunter of the Dark\": \"[W]e are to believe that the entity in the church--the Haunter of the Dark, described as an avatar of Nyarlathotep--has possessed Blake's mind but, at the moment of doing so, is struck by lightning and killed, and Blake dies as well.\"\n\n\nIn a discussion of Lovecraft's work, Fritz Leiber described the \"Haunter of the Dark\" as \"one of his finer tales (and his last)\". The horror historian R. S. Hadji included \"The Haunter of the Dark\" on his list of the most frightening horror stories.\n\n\nThe Robert Bloch Award is presented at the annual Necronomicon convention. Its recipient in 2013 was editor and scholar S.T. Joshi. The award is in the shape of the Shining Trapezohedron.\n\n\n"}

He was probably originally from Lombardy, perhaps born in Val d'Intelvi. It is believed from the Provençal style of his art that he served as apprentice at Saint-Trophime d'Arles. In 1178 he was at work at the Parma Cathedral, where, in the right transept, he executed a bas-relief of the Deposition from the Cross. His name and the date are inscribed in the work, which, in addition to the Provençal element, shows both classical and Byzantine influence.\n\nLater, in 1196, he was working with the sculptural decoration of the Baptistry of Parma, a building of which he was probably also the architect. Here, between 1196 and 1214, he made the lunettes of the three portals: on the outside portraying the Adoration of the Magi, the Last Judgement and an allegory of life, on the inside the Flight into Egypt, the Presentation at the Temple and David playing the harp. Also on the interiori can be seen alto-relievo personifications of the months and the seasons. These were probably intended for a portal on the facade of the Cathedral, but the work was interrupted by Antelami’s death.\n\nBenedetto's sculpture is also to be found in the Fidenza Cathedral, dedicated to Saint Domninus of Fidenza.\n\nThe main west door of the Basilica di San Marco, Venice, is also attributed by some to Antelami or his school, and the current replacement version of the Holy Face of Lucca (the \"Volto Santo\") is ascribed to his circle.\n\nAntelami's works are characteristic for their realism, and strong emotion, within the formalist context of their time.\n\n"}

Chornyi Cheremosh is 87 km long with a basin of 856 sq km and Bilyi Cheremosh is 61 km long with a basin of 606 sq km. The river starts in the Carpathian Mountains and flows roughly SW to NE. It leaves the \"Bukovina Obchinas\" (a mountain range in Outer Eastern Carpathians stretching in Ukraine and Romania) to the river's right, and the historic subregion of Pokuttya to the river's left side.\n\nIt flows along the borderline of the historic regions of Bukovina and Galicia. In the Middle Ages and the early modern era, it was part of the borderline between the Principality of Moldavia and Kingdom of Poland. Currently it runs along the borderline between the Ivano-Frankivsk and Chernivtsi Oblasts.\n\nBoth banks in the upper part of the river are inhabited by Hutsuls.\n\nIt's hard to find another river on the territory of the former USSR that would be so popular and respectable among water tourists irrespective of its relatively small length. The tradition to hold sports rafting was initiated at the end of the 1950s and in 1967 near the village of Biloberizka and Petrashi the first all-Ukrainian competitions in water tourism on canoe. Since then the Cheremosh has become an avowed arena for holding national competitions, which actually turned into international events due to participation of crews from other countries. The traditions have not been lost up to now and the international popularity of the river grows with every passing year. Why is the Cheremosh so attractive? First, it attracts by unsurpassed beauty of the nature, diversity of the very water-way and the full complex of natural obstacles peculiar for mountain rivers ranging to the highest categories of complexity. The river is full of sudden turns, rapids, shivers (chaotic conglomeration of rocks in the river), floodgates, gorges, and whirlpools that do not allow the knights of oars and a life jacket to relax even for a single minute. The Cheremosh has two faces: mountainous and flat, consequently, after stormy scuffles and troubles in its head water you will feel the pleasure of quiet rest in its lower reaches. A very important advantage of the Cheremosh is the proximity of populated localities where you can stop for night in tourist camps or in private houses since the crucial element in any water trip is the issue of overnight stay under normal conditions: you cannot put too much equipment to a kayak or a canoe! Another important and favourable factor is the convenience of access roads and sufficiently long season of rafting — from early spring to late autumn.\n\n\n\n"}

He received offers to large teams including Ajax Amsterdam, Feyenoord Rotterdam and Real Madrid Club de Fútbol. However, he turned down the offers because he chose not to play professionally.\n\nHis mother’s last name was Hatot, but the Civil Registry couldn’t place the name, so they decided to spell Ergilio’s last name “Hato”. Hato was always an avid soccer player. Back in the day, school yards were set up as soccer fields and monks encouraged playing before school, during breaks, and after school. Hato (19 in 1945) would have been drafted for military service had the Curaçao Soccer Federation not hosted a large international competition with teams from Colombia, Aruba, Suriname and the Netherlands Feyenoord in 1945. Curaçao’s “Dream Team” delivered a clean sweep. Feyenoord came in second. A huge disappointment for the Dutch, and a testament to Curaçao’s innate talent despite its small size and limited resources.\n\nHato became known as the best goalkeeper in Latin America and the Caribbean. He took the Netherlands Antilles team to the Olympics in 1952 (they lost against Turkey) and led Curaçao’s team to a Bronze medal at the Pan American Games in 1955.

He's the best known for being the lead singer, occasional guitarist, and founder of the band Dokken. He is known for his vibrato-laden, melodic vocal style which has made him an influential figure in American hard rock and heavy metal.\n\nAfter enjoying mainstream success with Dokken, he parted ways with the band in 1988 and pursued a solo career. His 1990 solo album, \"Up from the Ashes\", spawned two singles, and achieved modest success. He released his second solo album, titled \"Solitary\" in 2008; it was a stylistic departure from his Dokken material.\n\nDon reformed Dokken in the early 1990s and has been continuing on with the band ever since. He is the only remaining original member of Dokken. Don joined forces with TTM Guitars and has his very own Don Dokken Signature Model TTM Guitar.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Don Dokken was playing in a Los Angeles-based band called \"Airborn\", and had the opportunity to reach a record deal in Germany. After seeing the band \"Xciter\", and future bandmates George Lynch and Mick Brown, he knew that they would complete the band that would land the record deal. Although Lynch and Brown were not interested in joining forces with him when he first contacted them, he went ahead to Germany. Don, with the help of one of Xciter's songs, did get the record deal, and he finally convinced Lynch and Brown, along with bassist Juan Croucier, to join him in Dokken soon after he received it.\n\nDuring his time in Germany, Dokken befriended the German band Scorpions, and sang with them in rehearsals for their \"Blackout\" album while lead vocalist Klaus Meine was being treated for nodes on his vocal cords. Don has stated that he recorded scratch vocals for \"No One Like You,\" \"You Give Me All I Need,\" and \"Dynamite.\" Don has also stated, \"I was just helping Klaus out,\" and \"You'll never hear those (tracks)...because it's not fair to the Scorpions.\" Meine recovered and returned to record the album.\n\nIn 1983, America saw the release of the first Dokken album, \"Breaking the Chains\" which had a moderate reception. However Juan Croucier left the band to join Ratt. Jeff Pilson was brought in for their second release, \"Tooth and Nail\", and at this time metal fans and critics began to take notice of the band. Don's strong, melodic vocals, coupled with Lynch's blazing guitar playing, guided Dokken to national fame.\n\nIn the late 1980s, however, personal tension between Dokken and Lynch took its toll on the band. In 1988, after the Monsters of Rock Tour and a further platinum album, Don Dokken decided to break up the band and they went on their separate ways. Don Dokken originally wanted to continue on under the Dokken moniker, but since the other three members shared partial ownership over the Dokken name, he was forced to put out his next album under his own name, and it became known as his first solo album. \n\nThe album, titled \"Up from the Ashes\", was released in 1990, and was very similar to the Dokken catalog. This project was a supergroup of sorts, made up of guitarists John Norum (of Europe fame) and Billy White (of Watchtower fame), bassist Peter Baltes (of Accept fame), and drummer Mikkey Dee (of King Diamond and Motörhead and Scorpions). John Norum's drummer Hempo Hildén was initially part of the band but was replaced by Dee before the album was recorded. Baltes had previously been a member of Dokken during the late 1970s for a brief period. Two music videos were made for the singles \"Mirror Mirror\" and \"Stay,\" respectively. Also, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, Don spent time as a producer for the metal band XYZ.\n\nHe also made a guest appearance on the German progressive metal band Vanden Plas's \"Spirit of Live\" album as the vocalist for their live performance of Dokken's \"Kiss of Death,\" the studio version of which can be found on Vanden Plas's \"Far Off Grace\" album.\n\nAround late 1993, Don started to talk with Mick Brown, who had recently left George Lynch's new group, Lynch Mob. They joined up with Jeff Pilson, and started to write new songs. In 1994, they sent what they had written to George Lynch, who was impressed with the material. Together, they decided to reunite and tour again. This reunion lasted for three years and resulted in two new Dokken albums, an acoustic live disc, and a full live concert recorded in Japan in 1995.\nIn the late-1990s, Dokken once again parted ways with George Lynch, gained guitarist Reb Beach, and later kicked off a new era with guitarist John Norum after the departure of Reb Beach. That union didn't last long as Norum departed quickly to re-unite with Europe. Norum was briefly replaced by Italian guitarist Alex De Rosso for the live tour until Don managed to find a permanent replacement and in 2003 guitarist/lawyer Jon Levin filled that position where he continues to this day at Don's side.\n\nSince 1994, Dokken has released six studio albums, two live albums, a Greatest Hits album, as well as their first two DVDs. Don Dokken released a new solo album titled \"Solitary\" in 2008 and Dokken released a new album titled \"Lightning Strikes Again\" during the same year. On March 1, 2010, the band Dokken's second greatest hits album, aptly titled Greatest Hits, was digitally released to iTunes and Amazon.com. The physical album with additional tracks is set to release from King Records (Japan) on April 21, 2010 and will be available in the United States through Cleopatra Records at a later date.\n\nOn September 22, 2010, in an interview with BraveWords.com, Don Dokken revealed that he would be undergoing vocal surgery, to correct problems with nodes and tears in his vocal chords. February 4, 2011 Anchorage, Alaska was Dokken's first show since surgery. In addition to the vocal chord surgery, Dokken underwent treatment for cancer around the same time.

It lies about west of Banff, near the village of Sandend, between Cullen and Portsoy. The cliffs here contain quartz; the name \"Findlater\" is derived from the Scots Gaelic words \"fionn\" (\"white\") and \"leitir\" (\"cliff or steep slope\").\n\nThe first historical reference to the castle is from 1246. King Alexander III of Scotland repaired this castle in the 1260s in preparation for an invasion by King Haakon IV of Norway. The Vikings took and held the castle for some time. The castle remains that are still there are from the 14th-century rebuilding, when the castle was redesigned based on the Roslyn Castle model.\n\nJames V of Scotland visited Findlater in November 1535 after a pilgrimage to Tain. In September 1562 Mary, Queen of Scots sent an army equipped with artillery from Dunbar Castle to besiege Findlater, which was held against her by John Gordon of Findlater, a son of the Earl of Huntly. When Mary was nearby on 20 September, she had sent her trumpeter messenger to deliver the castle to the captain of her guard, but he was refused. The previous Laird of Findlater, an Ogilvy, had been a Master of Household to Mary of Guise. He lost his inheritance following sexual misconduct with his mother-in-law and making a plan to imprison his father in a cellar to deprive him of sleep and drive him insane to obtain his lands. After his father's death his mother married John Gordon who then took possession of the castle and lands, and promptly imprisoned her. In October the Earl of Huntly sent Mary the keys of Findlater and Auchindoun, but she was suspicious of the low status of the messenger.\n\nThe castle is a scheduled monument.\n\n"}

Blair would later go on to lead Labour to a landslide victory in the 1997 general election. The existence of any deal was denied for many years by both men.\n\nThe existence of the deal was publicly dismissed by Blair, Brown and many of their associates for several years, prompting much speculation as to what, if anything, was agreed.\n\n\"The Guardian\" published a written note in June 2003 which, it said, outlined the policy areas proposed by Brown that Blair would commit to as part of the deal, namely a \"fairness agenda\" consisting of \"social justice, employment opportunities and skills\" under a Labour Government.\n\nIn October 2003, columnist Tom Brown told the BBC that Brown had informed him of the deal the day after it had been made. Tom Brown said to BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nI'm in absolutely no doubt there was a deal since Gordon phoned me the morning after it was made and told me about it. But at the same time I also believe that both men left the restaurant with a different version of the deal in their minds. They hadn't actually written it down on paper. Gordon believed Blair would step down about now actually, and Blair believed that he... hadn't committed himself to any timetable.\nA programme of \"Dispatches\" in May 2007, entitled \"Gordon Brown: Fit For Office?\" reported that Brown felt betrayed after losing support from Peter Mandelson and other friends and that this lack of support, rather than any deal, made him decide not to run for the leadership.\n\nAn account of the pact between the two politicians was presented in detail in the book of 2001, \"The Rivals: The Intimate Story of a Political Marriage\", written by BBC journalist James Naughtie.\n\nThe relationship between Blair and Brown from the years 1983 to 1994 – culminating in an in depth dramatisation of the Granita meeting – was the focus of a 2003 made-for-television film directed by Stephen Frears and written by Peter Morgan, based in part upon Naughtie's book. The film, titled \"The Deal\", starred Michael Sheen as Blair and David Morrissey as Brown.\n\nA caption in the opening titles (directly inspired – according to Frears – by the identical epigraph at the start of the film of 1969, \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\") informed viewers that \"much of what follows is true\".\n\nIn a televised interview with Piers Morgan in February 2010, Brown admitted that he deferred contesting the Labour leadership and that Blair had promised to hand over power to him at a later point, but that the two men later fought bitterly after – from Brown's perspective – Blair failed to keep to his end of the bargain. Brown also stated that the deal had not been made in Granita but had been struck before the men met in the restaurant.\n\nIn her autobiography, Cherie Blair writes that the deal took place at a neighbour's home, not at Granita. In an interview with Peter Hennessy on BBC Radio 4, Blair claimed that the agreement had been struck '...in a couple of different places in Edinburgh', claiming that by the time they dined at Granita, minds had been made up as to what was going to happen.\n\n"}

Arandaspids represent the oldest known craniates, a proposed group of chordates that contain all chordates with a cartilage-derived skull (i.e., lampreys, armored agnathans, and gnathostomes), and hagfish. The group represents a subclass within the class Pteraspidomorphi, and contains only one order, the Arandaspidiformes. The oldest known genus of this group is \"Sacabambaspis\" found in South America.\n\nThe head armor of arandaspids is elongated, fusiform, with a rather flat dorsal shield, and a bulging ventral shield. In the anterior part of the dorsal shield are two closely set holes, which have been thought to be a paired pineal opening, but which are more likely the external openings of the endolymphatic ducts.\n\nThe eyes, surrounded by a sclerotic ring, are housed in a notch at the anterior end of the dorsal shield. The nostrils are not clearly located, but may have been situated between the eyes. Ventrally, the ventral lip of the mouth is armed with long series of small oral plates which recall those of heterostracans.\n\nThe gill openings are probably numerous (more than 15) and minute. They opened between the diamond-shaped platelets which separate the dorsal from the ventral shield.\n\nThe body is covered with rod-shaped scales arranged in chevrons, and the tail is probably pad-shaped and diphycercal. The dermal bones of arandaspids consist of aspidine (acellular bone) and are ornamented with oakleaf-shaped tubercles which seem to contain no dentine. The sensory-lines were housed in narrow grooves between the tubercles.\n\n"}

On June 1, 2007, the airline was integrated into mainline SAS, and changed its name to SAS Scandinavian Airlines Norge. The airline operated from its hub at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, and was also the largest national branch of Scandinavian Airlines. SAS Braathens had its head office in Diamanten on the grounds of Fornebu Airport in Fornebu, Bærum, Norway.\nSAS Braathens was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) Group and was established in the spring of 2004, based on SAS Norway and Braathens. SAS Braathens operated routes in Norway, and also between Norway and the rest of Europe. The airline was the largest in Norway, and had 440 departures daily. SAS Braathens carried around 9 million passengers in 2006. Profit for the first half of 2005 came to NOK 206 million.\n\nSAS Braathens had a route network covering 40 destinations from Longyearbyen in the north to Las Palmas in the south. The route network was operated by a total of 57 aircraft: 51 Boeing 737s and 6 Fokker 50s. Through its parent Scandinavian Airlines, SAS Braathens was a member of the global Star Alliance network. Since it was established in April 2004, SAS Braathens has created or announced a total of 18 new international routes. Around 3,750 employees work for the airline, which is based in Fornebu, close to Oslo.\n\nScandinavian Airlines was founded on 1 August 1946 when the flag carriers of Denmark, Sweden and Norway formed a partnership to handle intercontinental traffic to Scandinavia. Operations started on 17 September 1946. Det Norske Luftfartselskab (DNL) is the former Norwegian flag carrier which was founded in 1927. The companies embarked on coordination of European operations in 1948 and finally merged to form the current SAS Consortium in 1951. Upon foundation the airline was divided between SAS Danmark (28.6%), SAS Norge (28.6%) and SAS Sweden (42.8%), all owned 50% by private investors and 50% by their respective governments. SAS gradually acquired control of the domestic markets in all three countries by acquiring full or partial control of several local airlines. The ownership structure of SAS was changed in June 2001, with a holding company being created in which the holdings of the governments changed to Sweden (21.4%), Norway (14.3%) and Denmark (14.3%) and the remaining 50% publicly held and traded on the stock market.\n\nBraathens was founded on March 26, 1946. For many years, Braathens was known as Braathens S.A.F.E, the latter part being an acronym standing for South American and Far East, for the destinations Braathens originally served. The company was founded by Norwegian ship owner Ludvig G. Braathen, with the intention of serving his ships in other parts of the world. In 2001 Braathens formed an alliance with KLM and Northwest Airlines. Alitalia was supposed to also join that alliance, but later decided not to. Braathens also dropped the SAFE from their name, and the company was known as Braathens until 2004. In 2001, after tough economic times, Braathens was bought by the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), although they were able to keep operating under their name until SAS Braathens became operative 1 April 2005.\n\nThe first months of 2006 were marked by conflict, and ill pilots caused several flights to be cancelled. Negotiations between cabin personnel and management failed on 6 April, leading to a strike grounding most of the flights, though a deal between management and the unions ended the strike on April 8.\n\nBy 2007 the airline was one of Norway's most prominent companies, but the lack of reliability caused by the number of cancelled and delayed flights has put the airline at the bottom of 140 Norwegian companies ranked by consumer confidence. The April 2006 strike benefitted SAS Braathens' main competitor, Norwegian Air Shuttle.\n\nSAS Braathens CEO Petter Jansen was forced to leave office in June 2006 after disputes with the SAS management in Stockholm, causing much controversy and debate in Norway, since Jensen was leading the only national branch of Scandinavian Airlines that made a profit.\n\nHowever, in 2007 the airline was rebranded as Scandinavian Airlines itself.\n\nAll SAS Braathens flight were operated with the IATA code BU, but all of the SAS Braathens flights were sold and screened at airports as SK flights.\n\nAs of June 1, 2007 SAS Braathens served 46 destinations, 17 domestic and 29 European destinations.\n\nThe SAS Braathens fleet included the following aircraft as of June 2012:\n\nSAS Braathens operated with three classes on the European business destinations and with two classes on leisure destinations. In April 2007 SAS Braathens upgraded its Economy Extra and Business class. In Economy class they introduced the new buy on board concept \"Cloudshop\".\n\n\n\n\nSAS Braathens used the SAS EuroBonus frequent flyer program. They also had a membership club (shared with SAS) for Scandinavians living abroad called Fly Home Club.\n\nSAS Braathens had its head office in Diamanten on the grounds of Fornebu Airport in Fornebu, Bærum, Norway. In 2010, the main competitor of SAS Braathens, Norwegian Air Shuttle, bought the former Braathens head office at Fornebu Airport.\n\n"}

{"id": "2318915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318915", "title": "Armoured recovery vehicle", "text": "Armoured recovery vehicle\n\nAn armoured recovery vehicle (ARV) is typically a powerful tank or armoured personnel carrier (APC) chassis modified for use during combat for towing or repair of battle-damaged, stuck, and/or inoperable armoured fighting vehicles, such as tanks and armoured personnel carriers (APCs). Most ARVs have motorized tracks, like a tank or bulldozer, enabling the ARV to operate on uneven ground. The term \"Armoured Repair and Recovery Vehicle\" (ARRV) is also used. \n\nARVs may have winches, jibs, cranes, and/or bulldozer blades to aid in tank recovery. Typically, any specialized lifting and recovery equipment replaces the turret and cannon found on a regular tank. ARVs may in some cases have electric generators, blowtorches, chainsaws and fuel pumps to help with recovery operations, or spare parts, to facilitate field repairs. Some ARVs have a spade component to anchor the vehicle when it is towing or lifting. Since most ARVs are based on tank or APC chassis, they have an armored crew cockpit and engine, which means that ARVs can be operated in combat conditions. Rarely, an ARV may be armed, such as some M32s, which have an 81 mm mortar for screening purposes, and the M88, which has a .50 cal heavy machine gun. One WWII Sherman-based ARV had a dummy gun installed where the turret would normally go.\n\nEarly ARVs in WWII were often repurposed tanks, with the turret and cannon removed and replaced with some type of winch. In the 2010s, ARVs are generally factory-built. Even so, ARVs often use a shared chassis that is used on an army's other fighting vehicles, as this facilitates repair and maintenance of the ARV (as parts from tanks using the same chassis can be used to repair the ARV). \n\nSome ARVs are operated in tandem with armoured bulldozers. ARVs generally can only tow an equivalent-class vehicle or one that is lighter in weight. As such, an APC chassis-based ARV can only tow and recover an APC, but not a much heavier tank. While most ARVs are made from or based on APC or tank chassis, more rarely, an ARV may be based on an artillery tractor chassis. Some ARVs have specialized equipment that enables them to operate on beaches or in shallow water.\n\nDuring World War I, some British Mark IV heavy tanks were fitted with jibs to produce \"salvage tanks\", but the majority of their work was at the tank parks in aid of moving, maintaining, and repairing damaged tanks.\n\nThe first true ARVs were introduced in World War II, often by converting obsolete or damaged tanks, usually by removing the turret and installing a heavy-duty winch to free stuck vehicles, plus a variety of vehicle repair tools. Some were also purpose-built in factories, using an existing tank chassis with a hull superstructure to accommodate repair and recovery equipment. Many of the latter type of ARV had an A-frame or crane to allow the vehicle's crew to perform heavy lifting tasks, such as removing the engine from a disabled tank.\n\nAfter World War II, most countries' MBT models also had corresponding ARV variants. Many ARVs are also equipped with a bulldozer blade that can be used as an anchor when winching or as a stabiliser when lifting, a pump to transfer fuel to another vehicle, and more. Some can even carry a spare engine for field replacement, such as the German Leopard 1 ARV.\n\nARVs are normally built on the chassis of a main battle tank (MBT), but some are also constructed on the basis of other armoured fighting vehicles, mostly armoured personnel carriers (APCs). ARVs are usually built on the basis of a vehicle in the same class as they are supposed to recover; a tank-based ARV is used to recover tanks, while an APC-based one recovers APCs (it does not have the power to tow a much heavier tank). ARVs with a crane can be used to lift and place concrete fortifications in place and help with other battlefield engineering.\n\nSome combat engineering vehicles (CEVs) are based on ARVs.\n\nThe following is a list of ARVs by country, either designer/manufacturer or user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Russian acronym BREM (cyr. БРЭМ) stands for \"бронированная ремонтно-эвакуационная машина\", literally \"armoured repair and recovery vehicle\".\n\n\nThe British tested their first ARV designs in early 1942. The decision at the time was to focus on the Churchill infantry tank as the basis, but cruiser tank based ARVs were also produced. When the UK received supplies of US medium tanks - first the M3, then M4 Sherman, conversions were made of these to operate alongside and so simplify support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2318916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318916", "title": "Angiolo Mazzoni", "text": "Angiolo Mazzoni\n\nAngiolo Mazzoni (May 21, 1894 – September 28, 1979) was a state architect and engineer of the Italian Fascist government of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nMazzoni designed hundreds of public buildings, post offices and train stations during the Interwar period in Italy.\n\nMazzoni was born in Bologna, was moved to Rome in 1905 with his parents, but returned to the Academy of Fine Arts, Bologna for his education. In 1920 Mazzoni practiced for about a year under Marcello Piacentini. The following year he was engaged as an engineer with the Special Section of Railway Workers in Milan, then rose to a position in the newly formed Ministry of Communications in 1924, producing significant independent work by 1926.\n\nPolitically astute, Mazzoni also joined the National Fascist Party in 1926. He owed much of his success and influence to his intimate connections with the Fascist regime, and played a decisive role in using architecture to consolidate positive images of Fascism.\n\nThe Fascist regime engaged in a comprehensive national program of public works. As chief architect for the Ministry of Communications and for the State Railways, both key modernizing sectors of Fascist rebuilding programs, Mazzoni designed many of them. Italy still contains hundreds of his large and small railway and telecommunications buildings, extant and functioning, a tribute to his mastery of robust, hard-working construction. In many of these he collaborated with architect and engineer Roberto Narducci.\n\nMazzoni's relationship with Fascism made it politically difficult for subsequent scholars to acknowledge his importance. Construction on his major commission, the vast Roma Termini railway station, was suspended in wartime Italy and redesigned by others after the Fascist defeat. Other important buildings by Mazzoni were crudely altered or demolished in the post-war period. His own personal advocacy of Fascism worked against his legacy, even after the end of World War II when he voluntarily exiled himself in Bogota, Colombia until 1963.\n\nMore recently academics and scholars such as Ezio Godoli, Giorgio Muratore, and Enrico Crispolti have begun a rehabilitation process and a critical re-evaluation of Mazzoni. His archive is now kept at the Museum of Modern Art in Trento, and efforts are being made to ensure the conservation of his most important surviving buildings.\n\nMazzoni's early works shows connections to the Viennese School of Josef Hoffman and Otto Wagner, with a neo-classical influence.\nStylistically eclectic, Mazzoni joined in 1933 to the so-called \"second phase\" of the Italian artistic movement Futurism, signing in 1934 the \"Manifesto of Aerial Architecture\" with F.T. Marinetti and the journalist Mino Somenzi, architectural evolution of the futurist aeropittura.\n\nThroughout his work, his stylistic approach varied dramatically, from the overtly bombastic and classical to the dynamically modern. In every case, his handling of composition, solids and voids, light and shade, surfaces and materials, was originally conceived, spirited, poetic, erudite, strong, and full of conviction.\n\nMazzoni's works include:\n\n\nOne classic example of Mazzoni's work is the railway station in Trento, a city in the north-eastern Italian Alps, built during 1934–36. Trento had a special significance for the Fascist regime as the capital of the Trentino-Alto Adige (Welschtirol-Südtirol) region, annexed to Italy from Austria at the Treaty of Versailles after World War I.\n\nTrento's railway station represents Mazzoni's interpretation of the functionalist style typical of the times; the building's continuous windows and dynamic structural lines are said to express Futurist ideas of speed and streamlining. The station stands out due to its innovative use of steel, glass, and several varieties of local stone.\n\nThe station offers platforms on four rail tracks and its design is intended to facilitate the flow of people from the street to the trains. Wide wood-frame doors open on the entire facade. A wide, shallow staircase leads to the underpassage to the 2nd and 3rd tracks. Spacious waiting space is provided under cover or indoor.\n\nIn addition to ticket offices, a tobacconist, a news-stand and baggage store, the station also provided office space for administration, restrooms, a restaurant and bar (today only a bar remains) and conference rooms and meeting space. Mazzoni was more than an architect. He also was an important interior and furniture designer, and all the components of his buildings, from wall decorations to brass door-handles and glazed screens, were designed by his office. The main hall of Trento railway station was decorated with large mosaics depicting the life of the people, and the natural beauties of the mountainous region around Trento. These depictions were typical of the time and served an educational-propagandistic purpose. Originally, the ceiling is said to have been painted light green.\n\n\n"}

Situated about 147 metres above mean sea level, the lake has an area of and has a maximum depth of 60 metres. The lake is shared between the administrative kommunes of Ydre, Kinda, Boxholm and Tranås and the area around it is sparsely populated.\n\nThe lake has very clear water, with a visibility of 8 to 10 metres deep, if conditions are good. This makes Sommen one of the greatest clear-water lakes in Sweden. According to tradition Sommen has 365 islands, one for each day of the year. The actual number is around 260.\n\nIn and around the lake various rare species are protected in a series of nature reserves, bird sanctuaries and areas closed for fishing. Måltorpet Granbo in Sommen is a Natura 2000 area.\n\nThe visitor centre and natural history museum, Naturum Sommen, lies at the northern end of Torpön island, near the central part of the lake.\n\nAccording to the \"Svensk ortnamnslexikon\" the lake name was given as Sooma in 1447 and is derived from the local dialect word \"somma\" meaning an oversized vessel. This may be in relation to the lake's size or the cliffs along its shores. Scholar Robert Norrby considered that the name Sommen originated as a noa-name - an unknown sacred or taboo name that the lake had.\n\nLocal mythology asserts that the lake was created by a cow called Urkon or Sommakoa. The lake basin was carved by Urkon with her hooves during an outburst of wrath; subsequently the basin was filled with water which became the lake. Following this, the wizard Somme from Tullerum locked Urkon in a cave, Urkons Grotta. It was said that she would escape when a crowned king visited the district of Ydre, where the lake lies, and kill him. According to folklore this was the fate of the legendary king Frode. As Frode was passing through Ydre, Urkon escaped and chased him; when he thought he had left Ydre and was thus safe, the cow killed him. At present there are two commemorative raised stones at Fruhammar, the location of this purported event.\n\nIn Urkons Grotta, the cow is said to rest on a bed of mineral coal and fur. Each Christmas Urkon eats one hair straw from the fur, and when she has eaten all straws it is said that she will come out and bring about the end of the world.\n\nIn 1568, amidst the Northern Seven Years' War, a Danish raiding party led by Daniel Rantzau managed to escape back to Denmark by crossing over the frozen lake, avoiding Swedish defences to the west and east. The escape made it possible for the raiding party to burn down Eksjö further south along their retreat.\n\nDuring much of the 19th and 20th century the lake was used for log driving. This activity peaked around World War I and declined as the road network around the lake improved. Wood and coal from various charcoal piles near the lakeshore were also transported in large wooden barges. By 1945 fifteen barges were operating in the lake as were the steamboats \"Boxholm I\" and \"Boxholm II\" that served as tugboats. At present only one barge survives at the naturum Sommen museum. In 1973 log driving ceased for good.\n\nThe lake is known for its unique wooden boats called \"sommaskep\". \"Sommaskep\" are for rowing, and differ from ordinary small traditional wooden boats in Sweden for having a longer stem. An explanation for this design is that it makes boats easier to navigate in the typically short-wavelength waves of Sommen. The tradition of building \"sommaskep\" has been kept alive as Gunnar Gustavsson, a local carpenter, was tasked by the local history society of Torpa with building \"sommaskep\" in the early 1990s; he made a copy of an antique \"sommaskep\" in Malexander. In recent times \"sommaskep\" boats have been built in Malexander (2007, 2016).\n\nRelative to other areas of southern Sweden, Sommen stands out for its low precipitation and low humidity. The rainiest months of the year are September followed by July and August. Each of these months have a precipitation of around 70mm. The driest months are February and March, with around 35mm each. The hottest months are June, July and August averaging 14–15 °C. The coldest months are January and February with an average temperature of about -4 °C. The climate is expected to become warmer and drier in future.\n\nThe growing season around Sommen is of about 216 days with 2614 degree days. The vegetation around the lake is mostly dominated by pine and spruce forest. Broad-leaf forest and open agricultural fields can also be found at some locations. In particular the southern side of the lake contains more lush vegetation and broad-leaf forest than the northern side, which has more cliffs and contiguous pine forest. The rare and endangered flower \"Anthericum liliago\" can be found along the lake's rocky shores. This is one of the northernmost locales where it grows.\n\nOn Torpön island is Sweden's largest wych elm and at Asby, a few kilometres from the southern shores, grows Sweden's thickest spruce. The name Ydre, which was formerly applied to most of the area around Sommen, is interpreted to mean \"place of yews\". One locality in particular appears to be further associated with yews; this is Idebo along Norra Vifjärden.\n\nSome plants usually associated with carbonate rock areas appear as rarities near Sommen, since there are no known carbonate rock outcrops in the area. The plants are \"Vicia pisiformis\" and the orchids \"Ophrys myoides\", \"Malaxis monophyllos\" and \"Herminium monorchis\".\n\nGeographically the lake lies within the South Swedish highlands at a place where the Sub-Cambrian peneplain is uplifted. The present landscape is one of a hilly joint valley terrain. Topography displays local height differences as large as 100 m.\n\nGranite weathered into grus can be found at various locations around the lake. Red granite is a common rock around the lake and various parts are covered with till, including ground till deposited during the Ice Age. During the Weichsel glaciation, glacier ice moved over the Sommen area from the north-northwest. Drumlin-like forms and crags are also found throughout the area around Sommen. The ice sheets brought in carbonate rock and sediment from more northern latitudes to the Sommen area, depositing carbonates near the southern shores. This has made soils there richer in calcium than those further south.\n\nFollowing its maximum extent about 20,000–17,000 years ago the Fennoscandian ice sheet began to shrink gradually. The ice sheet's northward retreat brought the ice-front to the area of Sommen about 12,000 years ago. At this point the ice remained locally stagnant as it melted, with ice persisting longer in valleys than in hills and ridges. Thus the ice-front during deglaciation is thought to have been highly sinuous. Stagnation of the ice led to the formation of hummocky moraine and glacifluvial deposits. With its water surface at 146 metres above sea level, Sommen is slightly above the highest postglacial coastline () at 137 metres. This ancient coastline corresponds to the coastline of the Baltic Ice Lake during the Younger Dryas. These are near the lake's eastern shores with patterned ground which presumably formed during the periglaciation of the area during the Younger Dryas. The biogeography of various aquatic species deemed glacial relicts that are found in Sommen is likely related to a different geography during the early history of the lake. One theory claims that aquatic species were transferred from the Baltic Ice Lake through a natural lock system in connection with a temporary advance of the ice-front during the Younger Dryas. On land, the unusual occurrence of dwarf birch near Sund is also judged to be a leftover from a cold geological past.\n\nAt present the post-glacial rebound of the crust in the lake area is uneven. At the lake's outlet in the northwest it is 2.36mm per year while in the eastern Svanaviken it is 2.05mm. This means the lake is being slowly tilted and the southeastern shores drowned while near the outlet land is being dried up.\n\nLarge birds that breed in the area include fish hawk, European herring gull, heron and black-throated loon. Inventories of these four birds were taken in 1974, 1980, 1994 and 2012. According to this data, populations of European herring gulls and heron appear to have declined. Other water birds that breed in the area include oystercatcher, common gull, black-headed gull, common tern, common sandpiper, goosander, great crested grebe, mute swan and Canada goose, together with two duck species; mallard and common goldeneye. Various pairs of peregrine falcon nest in the lake area; this species was almost extinct in Sweden in the 1970s.\n\nAn inventory made in 2018 showed that during summer about 1,000 cormorants live in the lake area. As cormorants feed on fish, their population is thought to impact on the amount of fish, possibly producing an ecological disturbance. Hunting of cormorants is allowed under certain conditions from 2019 to 2023.\n\nTwenty-two species of fish are found in Sommen. Common fish in the lake are Eurasian perch, northern pike, brown trout, common whitefish, Sommen charr, smelt, burbot, European eel, ruffe and vendace. Less common fishes include common roach, common bream, tench, vimba and common bleak.\n\nLake Sommen is home to a subspecies of charr called Sommen charr (). This subspecies originated in the distant past in connection with the deglaciation of the lake basin and the formation of various ephemeral ice-dammed lakes (\"Sydsvenska issjökomplexet\"). Subsequently, the population was left isolated for thousands of years. Populations of Sommen charr declined over the 20th century, leading to the fish being declared endangered in 1970. The causes of the decline are likely to include overfishing, fishing of immature individuals, unnatural lake level changes (as the lake is regulated), and competition from introduced species. The largest known Sommen charr weighed almost 9 kg, and was for a while the largest ordinary charr () fished in Sweden.\n\nThe three largest arms of Sommen, Tranåsfjärden, Asbyfjärden and Norra Vifjärden, host most of the Sommen charr population. The bays near Malexander and Norravifjärden (the central and southeastern part of the lake) host most of the fish. Lek locations lie chiefly along the eastern shores of Norravifjärden and around Malexander in the north-central parts of the lake.\n\nCompared to the charr of Lake Vättern, only large individuals of Sommen charr breed; this may be the result of overfishing. In Sommen, charr reach sexual maturity at around 7 years of age. At 6 years Sommen charrs are estimated to reach an average length of 54 cm, while at 7 years of age average length is 60 cm. For comparison, charr in Lake Vättern reach sexual maturity (lek for the first time) at 6 to 8 years when the females have reached lengths of 40–55 cm and the males 35–45 cm. The implication of this difference is that Sommen charr either reach maturity later than charr in Vättern, or that they grow faster.\n\nThe two large crustaceans of the lake, the signal crayfish and the noble crayfish, are not as abundant as fish. The signal crayfish is an introduced species. The lake stands out for having three crustacean species that are relicts from the time of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet deglaciation about 12,000 years ago. These species are \"Pallasea quadrispinosa\", \"Mysis affinis\" and \"Limnocalanus macrurus\". However, the lake lacks the most common relict crustacean found in the lakes of southern Sweden, the \"Mysis relicta\".\n\nWhile the eastern parts of the lake have higher eutrophication values than the west, it does not qualify as an environmental problem in the lake as a whole. Neither is there any considerable acidification as seen in other Swedish lakes; however high cadmium and fluoride contents are an environmental concern.\n\nExtremely high concentrations of dioxin have been found in the vicinity of Brandnäs sågverk, a former lumber mill that closed in the 1950s. Most of this pollution is concentrated in the soil next to the mill in northern Torpön.\n\n\n"}

These programs may later use the supplementary copies to restore the original contents in the event of data loss. Hence they're very useful to users.\nThere are several features of backup software that make it more effective in backing up data.\n\nVoluming allows the ability to compress and split backup data into separate parts for storage on smaller, removable media such as CDs. It was often used because CDs were easy to transport off-site and inexpensive compared to hard drives or servers. \n\nHowever, the recent increase in hard drive capacity and decrease in drive cost has made voluming a far less popular solution. The introduction of small, portable, durable USB drives, and the increase in broadband capacity has provided easier and more secure methods of transporting backup data off-site.\n\nSince hard drive space has cost, compressing the data will reduce the size allowing for less drive space to be used to save money.\n\nMany backup solutions offer a plug-in for access to exclusive, in use, and locked files.\n\nBackup solutions generally support differential backups and incremental backups in addition to full backups, so only material that is newer or changed compared to the backed up data is actually backed up. The effect of these is to increase significantly the speed of the backup process over slow networks while decreasing space requirements.\n\nBackup schedules are usually supported to reduce maintenance of the backup tool and increase the reliability of the backups.\n\nTo prevent data theft, some backup software offers cryptography features to protect the backup.\n\nTo prevent loss of previously backed up data during a backup, some backup software (e.g. Areca Backup, Argentum Backup) offer \nTransaction mechanism (with commit / rollback management) for all critical processes (such as backups or merges) to guarantee the backups' integrity.\n\n"}

The first identifiable heterostracans appear in the fossil record during the Early Silurian, and all, save for the Psammosteids, became extinct by the start of the late Devonian. This last group of heterostracans died out in the extinction event at the end of the Devonian.\n\nThe Heterostracans differed from other Paleozoic agnathan taxa both in the arrangement and histology of their scales.\n\nMost heterostracans had two plates which form a large dorsal shield and a large ventral shield, and had series of scales arranged in various patterns on the sides of their bodies, the exact pattern differing from one group to another. In a few primitive forms, such as \"Lepidaspis\", the dorsal and ventral shields are composed of a mosaic of tiny scales. In most other known forms, though, these tiny scales have fused together to form the shield-plates.\n\nThe scales of heterostracans are histologically distinct from other vertebrates, having three layers composed of dentine and aspidine, an acellular bony tissue unique to animals of this class and Thelodonti. The middle layer was honeycombed with tiny spaces called \"cancella.\"\n\nAs with many agnathan groups, heterostracans had no fins besides the tail or caudal fin. In some pteraspids, especially in the psammosteids, the ends of the branchial plates (the plates that covered the gills) is drawn out to form wing-like extensions.\n\nHeterostraca is divided into several orders, including the two most diverse orders, Cyathaspidiformes (\"Cup Shields\"), and Pteraspidiformes (\"Wing Shields\"), as well as the Cardipeltida, Corvaspidida, Tolypelepidida, Tesseraspidida, and the Traquairaspidiformes. The predominantly Silurian Tolypelepidida (the best known member being \"Athenaegis\"), is regarded as being a sister group of the Cyathaspids and Pteraspidids, while the Early Devonian \"Lepidaspis\" is regarded as being \"incertae sedis\", possibly close to the original basal forms.\n\nCyathaspidiformes is divided into two main subgroups: the Amphiaspidida of Early Devonian Siberia (i.e., \"Amphiaspis\", \"Gabreyaspis\", and \"Edaphaspis\", grouped together with their relative \"Ctenaspis\" of Canada), and the Cyathaspidida (i.e., \"Cyathaspis\", \"Poraspis\", and \"Anglaspis\"), grouped together with their relative \"Nahanbiaspis\".\n\nThe Pteraspidiformes is divided up into five families, four of which, Anchipteraspididae, Gigantaspididae, Pteraspididae, and Protaspididae are monophyletic: Protopteraspididae has recently been determined to be paraphyletic within Pteraspidiformes, and thus, no longer valid, while Psammosteidae is now regarded as a separate subtaxon within Pteraspidiformes, \"Psammosteida,\" as the sister taxon of the most basal family, Anchipteraspidae. Pteraspididae, Gigantaspididae and Protaspididae, in turn form the suborder Pteraspidoidei, with various genera of Protopteraspididae as sister taxa.\n\n\n"}

Spears played tight end, fullback and defensive end as a freshman in 2001, recording two catches for 20 yards on offense and eight tackles, a sack and a tackle for loss on defense. His play earned him freshman All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) honors as a tight end.\n\nThe 2002 season marked his first as a full-time defensive player, in which he recorded 46 tackles, 16 quarterback pressures, 3.5 tackles for losses and three sacks. In 2003, during LSU's national championship season, Spears contributed 49 tackles, 23 quarterback pressures, 13 tackles for losses, six sacks and six passes defensed to earn First-team All-SEC honors. Playing against the Oklahoma Sooners for the national championship in the Sugar Bowl, Spears returned an interception 20 yards for a touchdown to give the Tigers a 21–7 advantage in their 21–14 victory.\n\nDuring his 2004 senior season, Spears put together a career year, earning first-team All-America honors from the Walter Camp Foundation, American Football Coaches Association, and AP, and second-team All-America honors from \"Sports Illustrated\", first-team All-SEC honors, and was a semifinalist for the Bednarik Award and Lombardi Award. He finished the year tying his career-high in tackles (49) while setting career-highs for tackles for losses (17) and sacks (nine, a figure that ranks fourth in the LSU single-season records). He also recorded 21 quarterback pressures to help the Tigers finish the year third in the country in total defense.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys entered the 2005 NFL Draft with two first round draft choices. Spears was considered by head coach Bill Parcells to be the key to the team's eventual move to a 3-4 defense and wanted to take him with the first selection (11th overall pick). Owner/GM Jerry Jones overruled Parcells and drafted DeMarcus Ware instead, who the team thought would not be available later in the draft. Spears was eventually selected by the Cowboys with the 20th overall pick.\n\nSpears suffered from injury problems in his first two training camps. In his first training camp in 2005 as a rookie, He sprained his right knee and ankle while straining his calf. What could have been a serious injury was only a minor setback for him. He missed the first three preseason games but bounced back in time for the final preseason game and recorded three tackles and a sack.\n\nHe started the season as a backup in the team's 4-3 defense and eased into a right defensive end starting role midway through the season, to earn All-Rookie honors from \"Pro Football Weekly\". His 35 tackles were good for 12th on the team - third among linemen and rookies while his six quarterback pressures were fourth. He added 1.5 sacks and a pass defensed.\n\nIn his NFL debut at the San Diego Chargers, Spears was in the defensive line rotation but did not record a tackle. He recorded his first sack - one he split with Greg Ellis - and his first career tackle against the Washington Redskins. Spears then led all defensive linemen with four tackles at the San Francisco 49ers. He helped limit the Philadelphia Eagles to 129 yards, including just 19 rushing, the fourth lowest in franchise history. Spears earned his first NFL start at defensive end at the Seattle Seahawks and responded with three tackles and a batted pass while helping limit Shaun Alexander, the NFL's leading rusher to 21 carries for 61 yards (2.9 avg.). He officially moved into the starting lineup full-time against the Arizona Cardinals and led all linemen with four tackles. Spears logged his third career start in Philadelphia and posted a season-high seven tackles to lead all linemen and finish second on the team. He had a three-tackle game at the New York Giants. Against the Kansas City Chiefs, Spears recorded four and a fumble recovery. With 1:16 remaining in the first half and Dallas trailing 14–10, Spears scooped up a Trent Green fumble at the Cowboys 15-yard line and returned it 59 yards to the Chiefs 26-yard line. It was the eighth-longest return in franchise history and the longest ever by a Dallas rookie. Three plays later, Drew Bledsoe completed a pass to Jason Witten for a touchdown and a 17-14 halftime lead. In Washington, Spears recorded three tackles. In the season finale against the St. Louis Rams, he recorded two tackles and his first solo sack of the season.\n\nBefore the 2006 season, Spears underwent minor knee surgery to repair meniscus damage, which forced him to miss the first two weeks of training camp. The Cowboys moved to a 3-4 defense and Spears earned the starting role at left defensive end, finishing ninth with 48 tackles (31 solo), one sack, three pass deflections, two tackles for loss and tied for fifth on the squad with three quarterback pressures.\n\nIn the season opener at the Jacksonville Jaguars, Spears had two tackles and a tackle for loss. In Week two's Sunday night game against the Redskins, Spears recorded his only sack of the season, sacking quarterback Mark Brunell in the first quarter, he also recorded two tackles. After the Cowboys' bye week, Spears led all defensive linemen with four tackles against the Tennessee Titans. The Titans, in rookie quarterback Vince Young first career start, only rushed 27 times for 78 yards. Spears recorded two tackles the next week in Philadelphia, where he also broke up a pass at the line of scrimmage. Against the Houston Texans, Spears recorded three tackles and a quarterback pressure. He recorded three tackles against the Giants in a Monday night loss at Texas Stadium. At the Carolina Panthers, in a Sunday night victory, Spears had two more tackles and a quarterback pressure. He had five tackles the following week in Washington, followed by four tackles in Arizona. Against the eventual Super Bowl champion Indianapolis Colts, Spears had three tackles and one for loss, limiting the Colts to a season-low 14 points. In the annual Thanksgiving Day game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he had three tackles. He had two tackles in the Cowboys' 23–20 win over the Giants at the Meadowlands. The following week Spears recorded a season-high six tackles against the Saints in a home loss. He recorded four tackles in a road win against the Atlanta Falcons, helping provide pressure on the defensive line that sacked Falcons quarterback Michael Vick four times. Spears had three tackles in the Cowboys' Christmas Day loss to the Eagles and did not record a stat in the season finale against the Detroit Lions. In his postseason debut, Spears had one tackle and led the team with two quarterback pressures against the Seahawks.\n\nIn 2007, he appeared in all 16 regular season game and Dallas' lone post season game. For the season Spears recorded 32 tackles (19 solo), two forced fumbles, and a career-high two sacks and three passed defensed on the season.\n\nIn the season opener against the New York Giants, Spears recorded one tackle (one solo). During week two at the Miami Dolphins, he recorded two tackles (two solo). In the week three victory over the Chicago Bears, Spears recorded two tackles (one solo). During the week four victory over the St. Louis Rams, he recorded two tackles (one solo), and 0.5 sack. In week five at the Buffalo Bills, Spears recorded two tackles (one solo). During the Cowboys first loss of the season, to the New England Patriots, he recorded four tackles. In the week seven win over the Minnesota Vikings, Spears did not record any stats. During week nine at the Philadelphia Eagles, he recorded one tackle and 0.5 sacks and a forced fumble. In the week 10 win over the New York Giants, Spears recorded two tackles (two solo). During the week 11 win over the Washington Redskins, he recorded one tackle. In the week 12 victory over the New York Jets, Spears recorded two tackles and one pass defensed. During the week 13 victory over the Green Bay Packers, he recorded one tackle, and a pass defensed. In the week 14 win over the Detroit Lions, Spears recorded one tackle. During a week 15 loss to the Eagles, he recorded three tackles (two solo). In a week 16 victory over the Carolina Panthers, Spears recorded one tackle and one pass defensed. During the season finale against the Washington Redskins, he recorded a season high five tackles (four solo), one sack, and one forced fumble.\n\nIn the Cowboys lone playoff game against eventual Super Bowl XLII champion New York Giants, Spears recorded two tackles.\n\nMarcus Spears started 15 games of the 16 games he played in the 2008 season. He registered 35 tackles (with 23 being solo, and 12 being assisted tackles), a sack, and a forced fumble.\n\nIn 2009, he started 14 games and recorded 50 tackles (2 for losses), a career-high 2.5 sacks and a career-high tying 16 quarterback pressures and 2 pass breakups.\n\nSpears played a key role in the playoffs, registering a tackle and three pressures in the wildcard playoff win against the Philadelphia Eagles, as the defense did not allow a rushing first down for the first time in postseason team history. He had a postseason career-high six tackles and a pressure in the divisional game against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nAfter playing in only eight games (7 starts), his streak of 88 consecutive games played ended on November 10, when he was placed on the injured reserve list, with a left calf injury. Playing mostly in running downs, he registered 24 tackles (1 for loss) and 3 quarterback pressures.\n\nSpears signed a 5-year, $19.2 million contract during the off-season. He injured his groin in the second preseason game and missed the rest of the preseason.\n\nNew defensive coordinator Rob Ryan selected Kenyon Coleman and Jason Hatcher as the starters at defensive end, relegating Spears into a reserve role for the first time in his career. He was used mostly on running downs and registered 29 tackles (one for loss), 15th on the team and fifth among defensive linemen, one sack, two pass deflections and one quarterback pressure.\n\nIn 2012, he again had a reserve role, but got a chance to start in six games because of injuries. Spears finished the season with 35 tackles (2 for loss) and 1 sack. He missed one game with a knee injury.\n\nOn March 13, 2013, Spears was released because of a degenerative knee condition and he was not seen as a good fit in the team's plan to change to a 4-3 defense. While he never developed into a Pro Bowl player like fellow 2005 first-round pick DeMarcus Ware, he was durable, an excellent locker room presence and fulfilled his primary responsibility in the 3-4 defense, which was to create rushing lanes for the outside linebackers.\n\nOn March 15, 2013 Spears signed a two-year, $3.55 million deal with the Baltimore Ravens. On October 30, 2013, he was waived after registering 10 tackles as a reserve defensive end.\n\nSpears was actively involved in community service projects during his time at LSU. His sister, Deidre was a three-year letterwoman on the basketball team at LSU, while starting two of those years for the Lady Tigers. As a rookie, Spears was a member of the Cowboys 2005 Rookie Club, a program designed to introduce rookie team members to community service in the Dallas area which included work with The Salvation Army, Children's Medical Center Dallas and Meals on Wheels. In the spring,\nSpears was a co-chair, along with teammate DeMarcus Ware, for the second annual Taste of the NFL: The Ultimate Dallas Cowboys Tailgate Party at Abacus restaurant that benefited The North Texas Food Bank. The event raised enough money to provide 330,000 meals to North Texans in need.\n\nIn 2008 Marcus Spears donated $6,500 to a highschool student by the name of Willie Forbes who was going on a trip to Europe for 21 days with People to People Student Ambassadors. In Europe, Willie visited France, Italy, and Greece. While in those countries, Willie visited sites such as the Eiffel Tower and the Parthenon. He and Marcus now share a great friendship.\n\nSpears and his wife, Aiysha Smith, have two daughters, Macaria Reagan (born 2/23/07) and Miko Reign Spears (born January 3, 2013), and one son, Marcus Rayshon Spears (born 4/8/09).\n\nHis wife Aiysha Kenya Spears played for the Washington Mystics of the WNBA.\n\nIn 2015 Spears began hosting a TV show called \"DFW Outdoorsman\" The show covers hunting, fishing, and other similar activities in the North Texas area. He is a regular contributor to the \"Paul Finebaum Show\", broadcast daily on the SEC Network. He is affectionately referred to as \"The Big Swagu\". In August 2014, Spears started as co-host of \"SEC Nation\", the SEC/ESPN Network's flagship show. \"SEC Nation\" is a weekly college football preview show offering insight into upcoming national and SEC football games. Beginning with the 2017 College Football season, Spears began hosting \"Thinking Out Loud\" on the SEC Network with former University of Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy. Spears now appears regularly on ESPN morning shows \"Get Up!\", \"First Take\", and their flagship NFL studio show, \"NFL Live\".\n\n"}

She directed and co-wrote the independent dramatic feature-length film \"Picture Bride\", which won the Sundance Film Festival Audience Award in 1995 for Best Dramatic Film.\n\nBorn in Honolulu, Hawaii, Hatta grew up in New York. She graduated from Stanford University and obtained a master's degree in film from UCLA.\n\n\"Picture Bride\" was an Official Selection at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section, and received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for best first film. Distributed worldwide by Miramax, the film was praised for its authenticity (including extensive use of Hawaiian pidgin dialogue), and continues to be used in the curriculum at a number of Hawaii universities and schools.\n\nWhile at UCLA, she began \"Picture Bride\" as a short film, but felt the material deserved to be feature length. Hatta describes the long process of developing and finding financing for the film on the DVD version of \"Picture Bride\", released by Miramax Home Entertainment, in 2004. The DVD includes a \"making of\" documentary featuring an extensive interview with Hatta and cast members, archival historical footage, and behind-the-scenes clips from the movie set. She recounts how the film encountered many technical difficulties during production, and ran out of funding halfway through the shooting. However, the lead actress, Japanese star Youki Kudoh, was able to make phone calls from the set to convince a Japanese lingerie company, for whom she had modeled, to buy the Japanese rights to the film, and production was able to continue. Hatta was also able to enlist the participation of a number of other established actors, such as legendary Japanese actor Toshirō Mifune, and Tamlyn Tomita.\n\nHatta directed a number of short films, including \"Otemba\" (\"Tomboy\") (1988), a semi-autobiographical film which the Pan-Asian Filmmakers Foundation cited as one of three \"Defining Moments in Asian American Cinema.\" Despite the success of \"Picture Bride\", however, Hatta was unable to find studio financing for her subsequent feature film projects, which included a screen adaptation of Cynthia Kadohata's acclaimed novel \"The Floating World\" (1989), about the transient life of a young Japanese-American girl and her family following their release from the World War II internment camps. In 1999, Hatta narrowly lost out on the chance to direct the film adaptation of \"Snow Falling on Cedars\", in which Youki Kudoh played a starring role.\n\nAs a collaborator, Hatta played key roles in the development and production of several independent films. She was co-producer of the award-winning film \"The Olive Harvest\" (2003), a romantic allegory of Palestinian culture today, directed by Hanna Elias . The film was the Palestine Authority's entry to the 2005 Academy Awards and the Golden Globe Awards, and was recognized at the 2003 Cairo International Film Festival as \"Best Arabic Film.\" Hatta was cinematographer \" for Liz Cane's documentary film \"Eager for Your Kisses: Love and Sex at 95\" (2006) a portrait of the filmmaker's 95-year-old grandfather. She is also remembered for her involvement in social justice issues , and for her mentorship and support for emerging Asian American artists and filmmakers . She served on the Board of Directors for Independent Feature Projects/West \"Project Involve\" Mentorship Program and was Assistant Professor at UCLA's School of Theater, Film and Television and the Art Institute of Los Angeles, where she taught film directing and video production. She also served on the dramatic film jury at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nIn 2005, Hatta completed work on \"Fishbowl\" \"\", which she wrote, directed, and co-edited; the film is based on the novel, \"Wild Meat and the Bully Burgers\", by Hawai'i author Lois-Ann Yamanaka. Hatta had intended to adapt the novel into a feature-length film but was unable to secure sufficient funding, so she decided to develop a 30-minute short film from a few key episodes in the book. . The coming-of-age tale of plantation kids searching for a better life premiered at the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival and aired nationally on PBS in March 2006. \"Fishbowl\" won the 2006 Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Hawaii Film & Videomaker Award. In May 2007 the film also won a Regional Emmy Award (Northern California/Hawaii Area), in the category of Historical/Cultural – Program/Special.\n\nOver the course of her career, Hatta received numerous honors, including the Asian CineVision's Asian American Media Award for Outstanding Achievement and Contribution to Asian American Media; the Asian American Arts Foundation Golden Ring Award for Artistic Achievement; and the MANAA (Media Action Network for Asian Americans) Media Achievement Award. Her honors in Hawaii include the Hawaii Council of the City and County of Honolulu Certificate Honoring Women Filmmakers of \"Picture Bride\" for Outstanding Achievement in Film; a Hawaii State Senate Testimonial of Commendation; and a Hawaii State House of Representatives Testimonial of Commendation.\n\nIn July 2005, Hatta drowned in Encinitas, CA outside of San Diego. She did not live to see the reaction to her last work.\n\nIn October 2005, three months after her death, the State of Hawai`i posthumously recognized Hatta with its Film in Hawai’i Award at the Hawaii International Film Festival, \"presented by the State of Hawai‘i to the film or television entity that has significantly contributed to promoting the local film industry.\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2318990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318990", "title": "Protaspididae", "text": "Protaspididae\n\nProtaspididae is an extinct family of pteraspidid heterostracan agnathans. Fossils of the various genera are found in early Devonian-aged marine strata. Protaspidids were once thought to represent a transitional form between the Pteraspididae and the Psammosteida, bearing the broad head shield shape of the latter, due to a more benthic (bottom-dwelling) existence, but recent phylogenical comparisons demonstrate that the protaspidids are actually highly derived pteraspidids, and that the anchipteraspidids, the most primitive of pteraspidids, are the sister-group of the Psammosteids.\n\nMany genera are found in Lower Devonian marine deposits of the United States, especially of Utah and Wyoming. Others are found in Lower Devonian marine strata of Europe, especially of Svalbard, Norway, and Podolia, Ukraine.\n\nThis genus is known from several species from the Early Devonian-aged Beartooth Butte Formation strata of Wyoming and Utah. \"Europrotaspis\", \"Cosmaspis\", \"Lampraspis\", \"Gigantaspis\", \"Eucyclaspis\", and \"Cyrtaspidithchys\" have been formerly placed within \"Protaspis\" as subgenera, or otherwise have been treated as species therein.\n\nSpecies of this genus are very similar to those of \"Protaspis\", but, are found in Early Devonian-aged strata of Western Europe and Podolia, Ukraine.\n\nSpecies of \"Eucyclaspis\" are found in marine strata of the Water Canyon Formation, in Lower Devonian Utah. This genus differs from \"Protaspis\" by having unique processes emanating behind the eye on the orbital plate.\n\n\"Cosmaspis\" is restricted to marine environments of Early Devonian Wyoming, and possibly of Utah, as well, where it coexisted with species of \"Protaspis\", \"Lampraspis\", \"Eucyclaspis\", \"Oreaspis\" and \"Cyrtaspidichthys\".\n\n\"Lampraspis\" is known from Early Devonian-aged marine environments of Utah and Wyoming. It is closely related to \"Oreaspis\" and \"Psephaspis\", and the three genera were, at one time, placed together in a subfamily, \"Oreaspidinae.\"\n\nSpecies of \"Cyrtaspidichthys\", originally \"Cyrtaspis,\" are very similar to those of \"Protaspis\". Fossils of \"Cyrtaspidichthys\" are found in Early Devonian-aged marine strata of Beartooth Butte, Wyoming.\n\n\"Oreaspis\" differs from \"Protaspis\" in ornamentation, and that the postbranchial plate (the plate posterior to the exhalant opening of the animal's gills) forms a tiny, wing-like process. Species of \"Oreaspis\" are found in Early Devonian marine strata of Water Canyon, Utah, and Beartooth Butte of Wyoming. At one time, this genus, together with \"Lampraspis\" and \"Psephaspis\", was placed within its own subfamily, \"Oreaspidinae.\"\n\nSpecies of \"Psephaspis\", which are restricted to Idaho and Utah, have broad, flat, rounded and heart-shaped dorsal shields, and ornamentation similar to those of psammosteids. Because of these two traits, species of this genus were originally described as being North American psammosteids closely related to \"Drepanaspis\" by Orvig. Denison then redescribed them as being pteraspidids closely related to \"Protaspis\", noting that the overall anatomy is that of a typical pteraspidid. Denison also notes that \"Psephaspis\" is the youngest genus of pteraspidid, as specimens of \"P. idahoensis\" are found in Middle Devonian-aged strata of Lemhi County, Idaho, which are younger than the latest strata other pteraspidids are found in.\n\nThis genus was established by Blieck in 1984 when he elevated \"Protaspis (Protaspis) brevispina\" into a separate genus, noting its cornual processes are distinct from \"Protaspis\".\n\n\"Tuberculaspis\" is known from Early Devonian marine strata of Nevada, where it coexisted sympatrically with the protopteraspidid \"Lamiaspis\", and fellow protaspid \"Pirumaspis\" in a shallow-water marine environment. It is named for tubercule-like growths that decorate the borders of its dorsal shield.\n\nThis Spitzbergen protaspid was originally named \"Spitsbergaspis\", but that name was discovered to be preoccupied by an Ordovician trilobite. It is similar in form and related to \"Zascinaspis\" and \"Woodfjordaspis\".\n\nSpecies of \"Zascinaspis\" are found in Early Devonian marine strata of Spitzbergen, and are similar in form to \"Xylaspis\", \"Woodfjordaspis\" and \"Gigantaspis\", the former two genera being closely related.\n\n\"Woodfjordaspis\" is known from an incomplete, partially articulated armor found in early Devonian-aged marine strata of Spitzbergen. It is similar in form and is closely related to \"Zascinaspis\" and \"Xylaspis\".\n\nThis protaspid is from the Sevy Dolomite Fauna of Late Emsian-aged marine strata in Nevada, where it coexisted sympatrically with \"Tuberculaspis\", and the protopteraspidid \"Lamiaspis\".\n\n"}

They were developed for use as a military horse following the Russian Revolution and are currently used as an all-purpose competition horse and for driving.\n\nBudonny stallions stand on average , mares . The coat is generally chestnut with a golden sheen, although they may also be bay, gray or black. They have a well-proportioned head with a straight profile, a long neck, pronounced withers, sloping shoulders, a wide, deep chest, a long, straight back, and a slightly sloping croup. Their legs are long and strong with good joints and well-formed hooves. The modern horse has a strong build, good bone, and are quite similar to the Thoroughbred. Conformation problems include occasional offset cannon bones in the forelegs and overly straight hind legs.\n\nIn the beginning, “Massive,” “Eastern,” and “Middle” types of the breed were recognized.\n\n\nLater, demand for competition horses led to the creation of a single type with a larger proportion of Thoroughbred blood. This breed is of interest because it is the result of the complex state-sponsored cross-breeding programs that were implemented after the Russian Revolution and are still in place today. The Budyonny is bred today in the Ukraine and in the Kazakh and Kirghiz republics in the southern part of the former USSR.\n\nThe Budyonny was named after Marshall Semyon Budyonny, a Bolshevik cavalry commander who became famous during the Russian Revolution. The breed was created by Budyonny, a well-known horse breeder himself, in the early 1920s in the Rostov region of Russia with the intent of producing cavalry horses to replace those lost during and after World War I. The resulting horses were used in Russian cavalry divisions during World War II and after.\n\nBudyonnys were bred from a cross of local Don and Chernomor mares and Thoroughbred stallions. The Chernomor (also known as the Tchernomor or the Cherkassky) is a type of Cossack horse similar to the Don, although smaller. They are descendants of the horses raised by Zaporozhian Cossacks, and were first bred around Krasnodar, north of the Caucasus Mountains. During the first round of breeding for the Budyonny horse, blood from Kirghiz and Kazakh horses was also used, but the progeny was found to be not as hardy or conformationally sound, and later the Budyonny was used to improve these two breeds.\n\nThe first Budyonny horses were known as Anglo-Dons, and the best were inter-bred, with the foundation stock for the Budyonny selected from their offspring. The foundation stock consisted of 657 mares of Anglo-Don, Anglo-Chernomor, and Anglo-Don/Chernomor crosses. These mares were crossed with Anglo-Don and Thoroughbred stallions. The broodmares were given the best of care with feed and management. The young stock, when between two and four years old, were tested for performance on the racecourse and in cavalry equitation courses. In 1949 the breed was officially recognized.\n\nIn the 1950s an experiment was performed to gauge the ability of the Budyonny breed to adapt to harsh conditions without human help. A number of horses were turned loose on a large island in Manych Lake in the Rostov district. The horses have since survived and thrived, proving that they are capable of living in the wild for extended periods without human assistance.\n\nThe Budyonny is used as an all-round competition horse, competing in dressage, steeplechasing, three-day eventing, and endurance. The breed is fast, agile, and enduring, which allows them to be used for many different events. They are also used as light carriage horses.\n\n"}

{"id": "2318997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318997", "title": "Stencil buffer", "text": "Stencil buffer\n\nA stencil buffer is an extra data buffer, in addition to the \"color buffer\" and \"Z-buffer\", found on modern graphics hardware. The buffer is per pixel, and works on integer values, usually with a depth of one byte per pixel. The Z-buffer and stencil buffer often share the same area in the RAM of the graphics hardware.\n\nIn the simplest case, the stencil buffer is used to limit the area of rendering (stenciling). More advanced usage of the stencil buffer makes use of the strong connection between the Z-buffer and the stencil buffer in the rendering pipeline. For example, stencil values can be automatically increased/decreased for every pixel that fails or passes the depth test.\n\nThe simple combination of depth test and stencil modifiers make a vast number of effects possible (such as stencil shadow volumes, Two-Sided Stencil, compositing, decaling, dissolves, fades, swipes, silhouettes, outline drawing or highlighting of intersections between complex primitives) though they often require several rendering passes and, therefore, can put a heavy load on the graphics hardware.\n\nThe most typical application is still to add shadows to 3D applications. It is also used for planar reflections.\n\nOther rendering techniques, such as portal rendering, use the stencil buffer in other ways; for example, it can be used to find the area of the screen obscured by a portal and re-render those pixels correctly.\n\nThe stencil buffer and its modifiers can be accessed in computer graphics by using APIs like OpenGL and Direct3D.\n\nThe stencil buffer typically shares the same memory space as the Z-buffer, and typically the ratio is 24 bits for Z-buffer + 8 bits for stencil buffer or, in the past, 15 bits for Z-buffer + 1 bit for stencil buffer. Another variant is 4 + 24, where 28 of the 32 bits are used and 4 ignored. Stencil and Z-buffers are part of the frame buffer, coupled to the color buffer. The first chip available to a wider market was 3Dlabs' Permedia II, which supported a one-bit stencil buffer.\n\nThe bits allocated to the stencil buffer can be used to represent numerical values in the range [0, 2-1], and also as a Boolean matrix (n is the number of allocated bits), each of which may be used to control the particular part of the scene. Any combination of these two ways of using the available memory is also possible.\n\nStencil test or stenciling is among the operations on the pixels/fragments (Per-pixel operations), located after the alpha test, and before the depth test. The stencil test ensures undesired pixels do not reach the depth test. This saves processing time for the scene. Similarly, the alpha test can prevent corresponding pixels to reach the stencil test.\n\nThe test itself is carried out over the stencil buffer to some value in it, or altered or used it, and carried out through the so-called stencil function and stencil operations. Stencil function is a function by which the stencil value of a certain pixel is compared to a given reference value. If this comparison is logically true, stencil test passes. Otherwise not.\n\nIn doing so, the possible reaction caused by the result of comparing three different state-depth and stencil buffer:\n\nFor each of these cases can be set different operations over the examined pixel. \nIn the OpenGL stencil functions, the reference value and mask, respectively, define the function glStencilFunc. In Direct3D each of these components is adjusted individually using methods SetRenderState devices currently in control. This method expects two parameters, the first of which is a condition that is set and the other its value. Order that was used above, these conditions are called D3DRS_STENCILFUNC, D3DRS_STENCILREF and D3DRS_STENCILMASK.\n\nStencil operations in OpenGL adjust glStencilOp function that expects three values. In Direct3D, again, each state sets a specific method SetRenderState. The three states that can be assigned to surgery are called D3DRS_STENCILFAIL, D3DRENDERSTATE_STENCILZFAIL and D3DRENDERSTATE_STENCILPASS.\n\nAlthough the range of stencil buffer applications is rather wide, we can mention several well-known applications. \n\nOn the picture above the ground with the picture is just above the white surface, which is not enough to prevent the effect of deep struggle. In contrast, in stensilinga (lower figure) this effect is completely removed, even when they are coplanar surfaces.\n\nDue to the lack of precision Z-buffer, coplanar polygons that are short-range, or overlapping, are portrayed as a single plane with a multitude of irregular cross-section. These sections can vary depending on the camera position and other parameters, and are rapidly changing. This is called Z-fighting. There exists multiple solutions to this issue: \n\n- Bringing the far plane closer to restrict the scene's depth, thus increasing the accuracy of the Z-buffer, or reducing the distance at which objects are visible in a scene. \n\n- Increasing the number of bits allocated to the Z-buffer, which is possible at the expense of memory for the stencil buffer. \n\n- Moving polygons farther apart from one another, which could give subpar results for elaborated scene. \n\nAll of these approaches to the problem can only reduce the likelihood that the polygons will experience Z-fighting, and do not guarantee a definitive solution in the general case. \n\nA solution that includes stencil buffer is based on the knowledge that a polygon to be in front of which it stands. After this, the silhouette of the front polygon is drawn into the stencil buffer. After that, the last polygon line only where the silhouette is not charted, and the rest of the scene can be deleted normally.\n\nShadow volume is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to add shadows to a rendered scene. They were first proposed by Frank Crow in 1977 as the geometry describing the 3D shape of the region occluded from a light source. A shadow volume divides the virtual world in two: areas that are in shadow and areas that are not.\n\nThe stencil buffer implementation of shadow volumes is generally considered among the most practical general purpose real-time shadowing techniques for use on modern 3D graphics hardware. It has been popularised by the video game \"Doom 3\", and a particular variation of the technique used in this game has become known as Carmack's Reverse.\n\nReflection of a scene is drawn as the scene itself transformed and reflected relative to the \"mirror\" plane, which requires multiple render passes and using of stencil buffer to restrict areas where the current render pass works:\n\nWhile drawing plane of shadows, there are two dominant problems: \nThe first concerns the problem of deep struggle in case the flat geometry is not awarded on the part covered with the shadow of shadows and outside. See the section that relates to this. \nAnother problem relates to the extent of the shadows outside the area where the plane there. \n\nAnother problem, which may or may not appear, depending on the technique, the design of more polygons in one part of the shadow, resulting in darker and lighter parts of the same shade. All three problems can be solved geometrically, but because of the possibility that hardware acceleration is directly used, it is far more elegant implementations using the stencil buffer: \n1. Enable lights and the lights \n2. Draw a scene without any polygon that should be projected shadows \n3. Draw all polygons which should be projected shadows, but without lights. In doing so, the stencil buffer, pixel of each polygon to be assigned to a specific value for the ground to which they belong. The distance between these values should be at least two, because for each plane to be used two values for two states: in the shadows and bright. \n4. Disable any global illumination (to ensure that the next steps will affect only individual selected light) For each plane: For each light: 1. Edit a stencil buffer and only the pixels that carry a specific value for the selected level. Increase the value of all the pixels that are projected objects between the date of a given level and bright. \n2. Allow only selected light for him to draw level at which part of her specific value was not changed.\n\nStencil buffer implementation of spatial drawing shadows is any shadow of a geometric body that its volume includes part of the scene that is in it. If any part of the scene belongs to this volume, light is not illuminated given, otherwise it is. This problem is compounded by the increase in the number of lights, but does not address the number of areas on which the shadows fall. There are several solutions to the problem, but we followed the following algorithm: \n1. Draw a scene without light \n2. Lock the Z-buffer and color buffer, so that the two can not make changes For each light 1. Using in-depth information about the scene (Z-buffer) to fill the stencil buffer only on parts of the scene where volume shadow does not exist or are not visible from the existing buildings. \n2. Unlock buffer for color, and adjust the function of the Z-buffer to allow amendments only where the depth value equal to an existing \n3. Draw the scene illuminated only by this light, but only for part of the scene passing stencil test \n\nEach of these passages implies that a clean stencil buffer can be used. \n\nAs for the shadows, this technique can be used to illuminate parts of space which are under strong light. For example, the brightness of the spotlight in a dark room with a large presence of dust in the air could be seen illuminating the appropriate volume of space.\n\nA further example is the so-called soft shadow, in which the transition between the illuminated and shadowed part of the scene is out of focus. Specifically, one way to achieve this effect stencil buffer is to multiply the volume of the shadow, and that as the copies, respectively are scaled according to a geometric series with a low magnification, e.g.. 1.04. Center of scaling can be the center of gravity of the polygon that represents the top volume. This in itself will give a series of composite shadows that give the desired effect. \n\nAnother implementation includes the field of visualization during the modeling technique solids Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG), wherein stencil buffer, together with the Z-buffer, it can successfully solve the problems of the Boolean operations of the SOLiD .\n\nglEnable(GL_STENCIL_TEST); // by default not enabled\nglStencilMask(stencilMask); // allow writing to stencil buffer, by default (0xFF) no mask.\nglClearStencil(clearStencilValue); // clear stencil value, by default = 0\nglStencilFunc(func, ref, mask); // by default GL_ALWAYS, 0, 0xFF, always pass stencil test\nglStencilOp(fail,zfail,zpass); // by default GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, do not change stencil buffer\nglClear(GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT); // clear stencil buffer, fill with (clearStencilValue & stencilMask)\nTest: ( ref & mask ) func (stencilValue & mask)\n\nDepending on the three possible conditions of stencil function/depth function.\n\n1. Stencil Test Function fails: \n\n2. Stencil Test Function passes/Depth Test Function fails: \n\n3. Stencil Function passes/Depth Function passes: \n\nTypically Stencil buffer is initialized by setting Z-buffer and color buffer masks to false. and then setting appropriate ref value to stencil buffer by failing the stencil test every time.\n\nNow use the initialized stencil buffer and stencil test to write only in the locations where stencil value is 1\n\n"}

At the age of 14, he began to study law in the office of Frederick de Peyster, which he soon left to enter the studio of James Herring, and in less than a year he became a pupil of Samuel F. B. Morse, through whom he also enrolled at the National Academy of Design. His drawings in the antique class at the National Academy won him the silver medal, but, having joined the Presbyterian Church, he determined to enter its ministry. For two years, he studied theology at Andover and Amherst, at the end of which time he returned to art.\n\nAfter painting portraits in Albany for a year, he went to New York, where he executed likenesses of William L. Marcy and John Quincy Adams. In 1836, he was elected a National Academician, and he was president of the National Academy from 1871 until 1873. About 1844 he moved to Boston, but in 1847 he returned to New York for a stay of two years.\n\nPage then went to Italy, where he resided for eleven years in Florence and Rome, coming back to New York in 1860. \nWhile he was in Italy, he painted the portraits of Robert and Elizabeth Browning and other well-known Englishmen and Americans. \nHe also took occasion to study the works of the great masters, notably Titian, whom he admired and emulated, and whose method of painting he strove to discover. \nThe copies that he executed of Titian's paintings were so remarkable that one of them was seized by the Florentine authorities under the belief that it was the original. \nHe was also a friend of William Wetmore Story and of James Russell Lowell, who dedicated his first collection of poems to him in 1843.\n\nHe died in 1885, aged 74 on Staten Island. \nAlthough extravagantly praised as an artist from the 1830s into the 1860s, Page's reputation suffered in later life because he changed his style so frequently and, more particularly, because technical characteristics of his painting method soon caused much of his work to darken excessively.\n\nIn Italy, he produced his “Venus,” “Moses and Aaron on Mount Horeb,” “Infant Bacchus,” and “Flight into Egypt.” His work also includes a full-length portrait of Admiral David Farragut at the Battle of Mobile Bay (purchased by a committee in 1871, and presented to the emperor of Russia), the “Holy Family” (1837, now at the Boston Athenaeum) and “The Young Merchants” (now at Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia). In 1870, Page exhibited a portrait head of Jesus Christ which attracted great attention and excited much controversy. Other paintings include: “The Last Interview” (1838), “Ruth and Naomi,” and “Cupid” (1880).\n\nAmong his many portraits, for which he was most noted, are those of Hiram Powers (painted in Florence about 1848), Henry Ward Beecher, Wendell Phillips, Charles P. Daly (1848, in New York Historical Society), James Russell Lowell, Josiah Quincy III, Gov. Reuben E. Fenton (1870), Charlotte Cushman, Ulysses S. Grant (1880), Thomas Le Clear (1883), and Charles Sumner (left unfinished upon Sumner's death). In 1874 Page made a second visit to Europe, in order to study Ludwig Becker's supposed death mask of William Shakespeare preserved in Germany, and on his return he executed a large bust and several portraits of Shakespeare (1874–78).\n\nHe wrote \"A New Geometrical Method of Measuring the Human Figure\" (1860), and invented and patented various improvements in boats and guns.\n\nAttribution\n"}

{"id": "2319031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319031", "title": "Standard of care", "text": "Standard of care\n\nIn tort law, the standard of care is the only degree of prudence and caution required of an individual who is under a duty of care.\n\nThe requirements of the standard are closely dependent on circumstances. Whether the standard of care has been breached is determined by the trier of fact, and is usually phrased in terms of the reasonable person. It was famously described in \"Vaughn v. Menlove\" (1837) as whether the individual \"proceed[ed] with such reasonable caution as a prudent man would have exercised under such circumstances\".\n\nIn certain industries and professions, the standard of care is determined by the standard that would be exercised by the reasonably prudent manufacturer of a product, or the reasonably prudent professional in that line of work. Such a test (known as the \"Bolam Test\") is used to determine whether a doctor is liable for medical malpractice. The standard of care is important because it determines the level of negligence required to state a valid cause of action. In the business world the standard of care taken can be described as Due Diligence or performing a Channel Check.\n\nA standard of care is a medical or psychological treatment guideline, and can be general or specific. It specifies appropriate treatment based on scientific evidence and collaboration between medical and/or psychological professionals involved in the treatment of a given condition.\n\nSome common examples:\n\n1. Diagnostic and treatment process that a clinician should follow for a certain type of patient, illness, or clinical circumstance. Adjuvant chemotherapy for lung cancer is \"a new standard of care, but not necessarily the only standard of care\". (\"New England Journal of Medicine\", 2004)\n\n2. In legal terms, the level at which an ordinary, prudent professional with the same training and experience in good standing in a same or similar community would practice under the same or similar circumstances. An \"average\" standard would not apply because in that case at least half of any group of practitioners would not qualify. The medical malpractice plaintiff must establish the appropriate standard of care and demonstrate that the standard of care has been breached, with expert testimony.\n\n3. A physician also has a \"duty to inform\" a patient of any material risks or fiduciary interests of the physician that might cause the patient to reconsider a procedure, and may be liable if injury occurs due to the undisclosed risk, and the patient can prove that if he had been informed he would not have gone through with the procedure, without benefit of hindsight. (Informed Consent Rule.) Full disclosure of all material risks incident to treatment must be fully disclosed, unless doing so would impair urgent treatment. As it relates to mental health professionals standard of care, the California Supreme Court, held that these professionals have \"duty to protect\" \nindividuals who are specifically threatened by a patient. [\"Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California\", 17 Cal. 3d 425, 551 P.2d 334, 131 Cal. Rptr. 14 (Cal. 1976)].\n\n4. A recipient of \"pro bono\" (free) services (either legal or medical) is entitled to expect the same standard of care as a person who pays for the same services, to prevent an indigent person from being entitled to only substandard care.\n\nMedical standards of care exist for many conditions, including diabetes, some cancers, and sexual abuse.\n\nA special standard of care also applies to children, who, in a majority of jurisdictions, are held to the behavior that is reasonable for a child of similar age, experience, and intelligence under like circumstances. (Restatement (Second) of Torts §283A; \"Cleveland Rolling-Mill Co. v. Corrigan\", 46 Ohio St. 283, 20 N.E. 466 (1889).) In some cases it means that more may be required of a child of superior intelligence. (Compare \"Jones v. Fireman's Insurance Co. of Newark, New Jersey\", 240 So.2d 780 [La.App. 1970] with \"Robinson v. Travis\", 393 So.2d 304 (La.App. 1980). An exception is for children engaged in \"adult activity.\" \"Dellwo v. Pearson\", 107 N.W.2d 859 (Minn 1961) \"Nicholsen v. Brown\", 232 Or. 426, 374 P.2d 896 (1962) (automobile); \"Daniels v. Evans\", 102 N.H. 407, 224 A. 2d 63 (1966) (motor scooter); \"Neumann. v. Shlansky\", 58 Misc. 2d 128, 294 N.Y.S.2d 628 (1968 (playing golf)) What constitutes an \"adult standard\" may depend on local statute, and some have arbitrary age distinctions. Another exception is if the child is engaged in an \"inherently dangerous activity.\" It is up to the trier of fact to decide if the activity is inherently dangerous. If they find that it is, the child must be held to an adult standard of care. \"Robinson v. Lindsay\", 92 Wash.2d 410, 598 P.2d 2392 (1979) (snowmobile);\n\nA person with a disability is held to the same standard of care that an ordinary reasonable person would observe if he suffered from that same disability. (\"Roberts v. State of Louisiana\", 396 So.2d 566 (1981) (blind postal employee)) However, courts do not recognize a person with a \"mental\" disability to be subject to any such special standard, and are held to the \"reasonable prudent person\" standard, except when the onset of mental illness is unforeseeable and sudden (e.g., \"Breunig v. American Family Insurance Co\"., 45 Wis.2d 536, 173 N.W.2d 619 (1970) (sudden hallucinations while driving).) In some situations, this could work an injustice. Physical handicaps and infirmities, such as blindness,\ndeafness, short stature, or a club foot, or the weaknesses of age or sex, are treated merely\nas part of the “circumstances” under which a reasonable man must act.\n\nA person engaged in a special and potentially dangerous activity must know or inquire of possible hazards or of any special duties and responsibilities inherent in that activity that might affect their ability to exercise reasonable prudent caution (\"cf, Delair v. McAdoo\", 324 Pa. 392, 188 A. 181 (1936) (driving on worn tires).) Custom and practice of usage may be useful evidence for determining the usual standard, but not determinative of what a reasonable prudent person \"ought\" to be required to do or know (cf., \"Trimarco v. Klein\", 58 N.Y. 2d 98 (1982) (showerdoor glass).) As Justice Holmes classic statement expresses it, \"What usually is done may be evidence of what ought to be done, but what ought to be done is fixed by a standard of reasonable prudence, whether it is complied with or not.\"\n\nA person of substandard intelligence is held under common law to the same standard of a reasonable prudent person, to encourage them to exert a decreased effort of responsibility to their community, in light of their handicap, and as a result of the practical difficulty of proving what reduced standard should apply (\"Vaughn v. Menlove\", 3 Bing. (N.C.) 468, 432 Eng.Rep.490 (1837).) Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 289 cmt. n (noting that the “reasonable person” standard makes allowances for age and physical disability but not “attention, perception, memory, knowledge of other pertinent matters, intelligence, and judgment. Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Common Law, 108 (Little, Brown, & Co. 1881): “The standards of the law are standards of general application. The law takes no account of the infinite varieties of temperament, intellect, and education which make the internal character of a given act so different in different men.”\n\nAn attorney is held to the standard that any reasonable attorney in possession of the same knowledge and skill that an ordinary member of his or her profession possesses, as long as he is acting with reasonable care and diligence, in good faith and honest belief that his advice and acts are well founded at the time. Here, mere errors in judgment are excusable (Best Judgment Rule) and cannot be judged solely with the gift of hindsight without substantial injustice. He or she is required to exercise ordinary care and caution (diligence) in the use of that skill (Due Care Rule), and procedural and technical failures are held to be the most common breaches. (cf, \"Hodges v. Carter\", 239 N.C. 517, 80 S.E.2d 144 (1954). (failed service of process).)\n\nIn \"Cordas v. Peerless Taxi Company\", 27 N.Y.S.2d 198 (1941), Justice Carlin held that a taxicab driver hijacked at gunpoint by a fleeing mugger in New York City may be excused from negligence for jumping out of the moving taxicab to save his own life, leaving the cab on an unguided trajectory towards bystanders. While some persons might choose to be singularly heroic, that standard is not one that is required for an ordinary prudent person. Such a person is held excused from liability, even if such failure might endanger others. An ordinary prudent person is not under any obligation to undertake a heroic duty at the risk of his own life. \"The first duty in an emergency is to one's own self, as long as that person did not contribute to or cause the emergency.\" (Emergency Doctrine.)\n\nWhen a statute, which is designed to protect the public, is violated while performing an allegedly negligent act, a court may adopt the statute as establishing the standard of care for tort liability. This is negligence \"per se\". There is no negligence \"per se\" doctrine in federal law.\n\nFour elements are deemed necessary for a statute to apply in a negligence case. First the person harmed must be a member of the class of persons which the law was intended to protect. Second, the danger or harm must be one that the law was intended to prevent. Thirdly, there must be some causal relationship established between the breach of the statute and the harm caused. Fourthly, the criminal statute must be concrete, specific and measurable enough to clearly establish a standard of breach. Courts are reluctant to create new torts out of criminal statutes. (See Restatement (Second) of Torts, sections 297, 288.)\n\nHowever, there are five valid excuses that are available for a defendant to defeat a standard of negligence \"per se\". (Restatement (Second) of Torts section 288.1(2).) First, the defendant may not know of the breach due to incompetence. Secondly, he might either lack knowledge or reason to know of the breach or duty. Furthermore, for some explainable reason, he may be unable to comply, despite diligence. The breach may be due to a sudden emergency not of one’s own making. And lastly, in special situations it may be safer to not comply than to comply. In cases where these defenses are applied, negligence \"per se\" doctrine creates no more than a rebuttable presumption of negligence that shifts the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant.\n\nIn balancing risks to establish a reasonable person's standard of ordinary care, the calculus of negligence establishes that the probability of the harm potentially caused (P) must be balanced along with the gravity of the harm which could result (G), against the burden of conforming to a new and less dangerous course of action (B) along with the utility of maintaining the same course of action as it was (U). This is sometimes noted in shorthand as P+G v. B+U, deriving from a formulation expressed by Judge Learned Hand. (\"United States v. Carroll Towing Co.\", 159 F.2d 169 (1947).)\n\nIn the Hospitality industries, the standard of care is higher, as the Innkeeper is expected to seek out potential danger and prevent it. \" Innkeeper/Common Carrier - very high degree of care - liable for slight negligence\" \n\n"}

{"id": "2319037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319037", "title": "Stephen II of Hungary", "text": "Stephen II of Hungary\n\nStephen II (; ; ; 1101 – early 1131), King of Hungary and Croatia, ruled from 1116 until 1131. His father, King Coloman, had him crowned as a child, thus denying the crown to his uncle Álmos. In the first year of his reign, Venice occupied Dalmatia and Stephen never restored his rule in that province. His reign was characterized by frequent wars with neighbouring countries.\n\nStephen and his twin brother, Ladislaus, were sons of the Hungarian king Coloman by his wife, Felicia of Sicily. According to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\", they were born \"... in the year of our Lord 1101.\" Stephen was named after the first king of Hungary, who had been canonized in 1083, implying that he was his father's heir from birth. A document written in Zadar in approximately 1105 AD makes mention of \"Stephen, our most renowned king\" along with Coloman, proving that the latter had his four-year-old son crowned king. \n\nBy the time of Stephen's coronation, Coloman had demonstrated his intention to secure the succession for his son. Coloman's ambitious brother, Álmos who had already rebelled against the king in 1098 opposed this plan and left Hungary. He first sought the assistance of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, followed by an appeal to Duke Boleslaw III of Poland. When all of his efforts ended in failure, Álmos submitted to Coloman and returned to Hungary, although he made several abortive attempts to dethrone Coloman in the following decade. In order to bring an end to the menace these plots presented to Stephen's succession, Coloman had Álmos and Álmos's little son, Béla, blinded.\n\nWhen he fell gravely ill in early 1116, Coloman also had his brother imprisoned. The \"Illuminated Chronicle\" narrates that the dying king \"instructed his son and his great men\" to invade Rus' in order to take vengeance for Coloman's failure in the 1099 siege of Peremyshl (Przemyśl), Poland. Coloman died on 3 February 1116.\n\nStephen was crowned king by Archbishop Lawrence of Esztergom in Székesfehérvár within thirty days of his father's death. His peaceful succession showed the effectiveness of the measures Coloman had implemented to prevent Álmos from usurping the throne. Upon his councilor's advice, Stephen initiated a meeting with Vladislaus I, Duke of Bohemia, in order to improve the countries' relations, which had deteriorated in the previous decade. The two monarchs met on the river Olšava, which marked the border of their realms. However, the lack of mutual confidence hindered the opening of negotiations, leading to armed conflicts which evolved into a battle on 13 May. On the battlefield, the Bohemian army inflicted a serious defeat on Stephen's troops. The contemporaneous Cosmas of Prague blamed the young king's advisors for the fiasco, but later medieval Hungarian chronicles all completed under kings descending from Stephen's opponent, Álmos wrote that the king acted without consulting his advisors \"... for he was of an impetuous nature\".\n\nDoge Ordelafo Faliero, who had conquered an island in the Gulf of Kvarner during the last year of Coloman's reign, returned to Dalmatia at the head of the Venetian fleet in May 1116. On 15 July, he vanquished the Hungarian troops which had arrived to relieve Zadar. Thereafter all towns including Biograd na Moru, Šibenik, Split, and Trogir surrendered to Venice, terminating Stephen II's suzerainty along the coastline of the Adriatic Sea. However, in either 1117 or 1118, the Hungarian troops were able to defeat the Venetians, during which Ordelafo Faliero himself died at a battle near Zadar, enabling Biograd na Moru, Split, and Trogir to rejoin the sovereignty of the Hungarian monarch. However, the new Doge, Domenico Michele, invaded and reconquered all Dalmatia. A five-year truce, which was concluded in 1117 or 1118, confirmed the \"status quo\": the seizure of Dalmatia by Venice. \nStephen's troops launched a plundering raid into Austria in 1118, provoking a counter-attack by Leopold III, Margrave of Austria, later that same year. Bořivoj II, Duke of Bohemia, supported Leopold and pillaged the northwestern regions of the Kingdom of Hungary. Despite this, when Vladislaus I dethroned his brother Bořivoj in 1120, Bořivoj fled to Hungary and settled at Stephen's court.\n\nStephen married a daughter of Robert I of Capua, in the early 1120s. Historian Paul Stephenson wrote that Stephen's marriage alliance with the Normans of Southern Italy \"... must have been partly directed against the Venetians.\" The Norman Princes of Capua had been the Pope's staunch supporters during the Investiture Controversy, suggesting that his marriage also continued his father's pro-Papal foreign policy. According to Włodzimierz Dworzaczek, Stephen in 1121 married Adelhaid, daughter of Heinrich, burgrave of Regensburg.\n\nStephen's cousin and the daughter of his uncle Álmos, Adelaide, whose husband Soběslav had been expelled from Moravia, arrived in Hungary in early 1123. According to Cosmas of Prague, Stephen \"kindly received her ... acknowledging her as his relative\", which implies that his relations with his uncle were cordial around that time. In the same year, the young king launched a military expedition against the Principality of Volhynia in order to assist its expelled prince, Iaroslav Sviatopolkovich, regain his throne. Even though Sviatopolchich was assassinated at the beginning of the siege of his former seat, Volodymyr-Volynskyi, Stephen decided to continue the war. However, according to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\", his commanders threatened to dethrone him if he continued the aggression, forcing Stephen to lift the siege and return to Hungary.\n\nTaking advantage of the absence of the Venetian fleet from the Adriatic Sea because of a naval expedition in the Levant, Stephen invaded Dalmatia in the first half of 1124. His charter confirming the liberation of Split and Trogir in July 1124 is evidence that the central regions of Dalmatia returned to his rule. However, upon the return of the Venetian armada the Dalmatian towns once again surrendered, one after another. According to the \"Historia Ducum Veneticorum\", only the citizens of Biograd na Moru \"... dared resist the doge and his army ...\", but \"... their city was razed to its foundations.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\", the blind Álmos, \"... fearing death at the hands of King Stephen ...\", fled to the Byzantine Empire. Many of his partisans followed him, and Emperor John II Komnenos settled them in a town in Macedonia. The Byzantine historian John Kinnamos confirmed that the emperor looked upon Álmos \"... favorably and received him with kindness.\" He added that Stephen \"sent his envoys to the emperor and demanded that ...[Álmos]... be expelled from\" the Byzantine Empire, but his request was rejected. The sources do not specify the date which Álmos's fled, but it likely occurred circa 1125. Historian Ferenc Makk wrote that Álmos was forced to flee from Hungary because he had taken advantage of Stephen's failures in Volhynia and Dalmatia, and conspired against Stephen.\n\nStephen met the new Duke of Bohemia, Sobeslav whose wife was Adelhaid in October 1126. The meeting of the two monarchs' brought an end to the hostilities between their two countries. Around the same year, Stephen also concluded an agreement with Archbishop Conrad I of Salzburg.\n\nAccording to the Byzantine chronicler Niketas Choniates, the citizens of the Byzantine town Braničevo \"attacked and plundered the Hungarians who had come to\" the Byzantine Empire \"to trade, perpetrating the worst crimes against them.\" In retaliation, Stephen decided to wage war against the Byzantine Empire. The \"Illuminated Chronicle\" relates that the childless Stephen \"... so ordered the succession to the throne that after his death the son of his sister Sophia, by name Saul, should reign.\" The chronicle does not specify the date of this event, but Ferenc Makk says that Stephen most probably declared Saul as his heir during the first half of 1127, before storming the Byzantine Empire.\nStephen broke into the empire in the summer. His troops sacked Belgrade, Braničevo and Niš, and plundered the regions around Serdica (Sofia, Bulgaria) and Philippopolis (Plovdiv, Bulgaria), before returning to Hungary. In response, Emperor John II marched against Hungary in 1128, where he defeated the royal troops in a battle at Haram, and \"captured Frangochorion, the richest land in Hungary\" (now in Serbia). Stephen was unable to participate in the fighting because \"he happened to be sickly in body and was recuperating someplace in the midst of his land\", according to John Kinnamos. The \"Illuminated Chronicle\" said that his illness was so serious that \"all expected his death.\" The chronicle added that \"traitors\" went so far as to elect two kings, the \"Counts Bors and Ivan\". Upon regaining his health, Stephen had Ivan executed and expelled Bors from his kingdom.\n\nJohn Kinnamos wrote of a second campaign by Stephen against the Byzantine Empire. The Hungarian troops, supported by Czech reinforcements under the command of Duke Vaclav of Olomouc, took Braničevo by storm and destroyed its fortress. Emperor John II Komnenos was forced to retreat and sue for peace. Historian Ferenc Makk writes that the resulting peace treaty was signed in October 1129.\n\nFor many years, Stephen believed that his cousin, Béla, had died after being blinded on the orders of Stephen's father. Having learnt, around 1129, that Béla was alive, the king \"... rejoiced with great joy ...\", according to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\". He even granted Béla the town of Tolna and arranged Béla's marriage with Helena of Rascia.\n\nThe \"Illuminated Chronicle\" recounts that Stephen showed blatant favoritism towards the \"Comans\", identified as Pechenegs or Cumans by historians, who had arrived in Hungary in the 1120s. In his last years, he even tolerated the crimes they committed against his subjects, causing a revolt. Before his death, Stephen \"... laid aside his royal state and took the habit of a monk ...\". He died of dysentery in the spring of 1131. No source recorded the exact date of his death, but most of his biographies wrote that he died on 1 March. He was buried in the Várad Cathedral (Oradea, Romania).\n\nAccording to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\", Stephen had no \"wish to marry a lawful wife but took to himself concubines and harlots\". However, his advisors, \"grieving that the kingdom was in a sorry state and the King without a heir\", persuaded him to marry. They chose a daughter of the late Robert I of Capua as their monarch's wife, although her name was not recorded. Stephen died childless.\n\nThe following family tree presents Stephen's ancestors and some of his relatives who are mentioned in the article.\n\n\"*Whether Géza's first or second wife was his children's mother is uncertain.\"\n\n"}

Many of these drinks end with the Sino-Korean word \"-ju\" (), and some end with the native Korean word \"-sul\". The Sino-Korean \"-ju\" is not used as an independent noun.\n\nThere are an estimated 1,000 or more kinds of alcoholic drinks in Korea. Most are made from rice, and are fermented with the aid of yeast and \"nuruk\" (a wheat-based source of the enzyme amylase). Fruits, flowers, herbs and other natural ingredients have also been used to craft traditional Korean alcoholic drinks. There are six distinct flavors: sweet, sour, pungent, roasted, bitter and spicy. When the flavors are balanced, the alcohol is considered good quality.\n\nMost traditional Korean alcoholic drinks are rice wines, fermented with the aid of yeast and \"nuruk\" (a wheat-based source of the enzyme amylase). Main varieties include clear rice wines (\"cheongju\"), milky rice wine (\"takju\"), distilled liquor (\"soju\"), fruit wine (\"gwasil-ju\"), flower wines, and medicinal wines.\n\n\"Makgeolli\" (also known as \"takju\" and \"nongju\"), is a milky, sweet alcoholic drink made from rice. It is one of Korea's most-popular alcoholic drinks. The oldest traditional Korean rice wine, its alcohol content is six to seven percent. It is fermented naturally and not filtered, which gives it its milky-white color and leaves a chalky residue at the bottom. Thick and smooth. It tastes sweet and slightly tangy, with a cool aftertaste. \"Makgeolli\" is served in a bowl, rather than a cup.\n\nIn \"Poetic Records of Emperors and Kings\", written during the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392), the drink was first mentioned in the founding story of the Goguryeo Kingdom during the reign of King Dongmyeong (37-19 BC). \"Makgeolli\" is brewed with classical methods, using \"nuruk\" (molded cereal which produces hydrolysable enzymes, decomposing macromolecules to monomers for yeast growth) cooked rice, water, barley and yeast. The brewing process has two steps: seed and main mash and main fermentation. Seed mash is the process of obtaining actively-growing yeasts and enzymes in the mixture of yeast and \"nuruk\". The main mash acquire tastes and aromas from the transformation of nutrients and amino acids derived from the rice. Main fermentation lasts for about a week.\n\nDue to the microorganisms present during fermentation, it contains 1.9 percent protein, over 10 amino acids, vitamin B, inositol and choline. \"Makgeolli\" is reported to increase metabolism, relieve fatigue and improve the complexion.\n\nA regional, slightly-creamier variant, originally from Gyeonggi-do, is called \"dongdongju\". Another variety, called \"ihwaju\" (hangul: ; hanja: ; \"pear-blossom wine\") is so named because it is brewed from rice with rice malt which ferments during the pear-blossom season. \"Ihwaju\" is often so thick that it is eaten with a spoon. A similar drink is known as \"Gamju\"; this name is also used for non-alcoholic sweet drinks, including \"Sikhye\" ().\n\n\"Cheongju\", or \"yakju\", is a refined rice wine made from steamed rice which has undergone several fermentation stages. Also known as \"myeongyakju\" or \"beopju\", it is distinguished from \"takju\" by its relative clarity. Varieties include \"baekhaju\" (백하주), made from glutinous rice and \"nuruk\", and \"heukmeeju\" (hangul: 흑미주; hanja: 黑米酒; \"black rice wine\", made from black rice).\n\n\"Yakju\" is brewed with boiled rice, yeast and water. If chrysanthemum is included, it is called \"gukhwaju\"; if azalea is added, it is called \"dugyeonju\"; if pine sprouts are used, it is called \"songsunju\"; if lotus leaves are added, it is called \"ywonyeopju\"; if ginseng is used, it is called \"insamju\". \"Takju\" and \"cheongju\" are sometimes distilled, with medicinal herbs added to the distilled liquor. This mixed liquor is brewed to enhance the medicinal effects of the herbs.\n\n\"Cheongju\" is similar to Japanese \"sake\". Chung Ha is a popular brand which is widely available in Korean restaurants. Local variations include \"beopju\", brewed in Gyeongju.\n\nThis \"yakju\" is brewed with flowers and leaves for a distinctive flavor. \"Kookhwaju\" (chrysanthemum wine), \"omijaju\", \"songjeolju\" and \"dugyeonju\" are types of \"gahyanggokju\".\n\nA number of Korean traditional wines are produced from flowers. These include wines made from chrysanthemums (\"gukhwaju\"), acacia flowers, \"maesil\" and peach blossoms, honeysuckle, wild roses, and sweet-briar petals and berries. One famous variety of flower wine, called \"baekhwaju\", is infused with herbs as well as 100 varieties of dried flowers.\n\n\"Dugyeonju\" (두견주, 杜鵑酒) is a wine made from azalea petals which is produced in Chungcheong Province. Sweet, viscous and light-yellowish-brown in color, it contains about 21 percent alcohol. \"Myeoncheon Dugyeonju\" is the South Korean government's Important Intangible Cultural Property No. 86-2.\nMedicinal liqueurs, known as \"yagyongju\" (, ), are produced by combining seeds, herbs and roots with alcohol.\n\n\"Honju\" is brewed with grain by adding \"soju\". \"Gwaha-ju\" and \"songsun-ju\" are types of \"honju\".\n\n\nIn the 13th century, during the Goryeo dynasty, Mongol invaders brought \"soju\" (known as \"araki\") with them. \"Araki\" is derived from the Arabic \"araq\" (liquor). \"Soju\" was originally developed in Arabia, and passed through Mongolia on its way to Korea. Distilled liquor was new to Koreans, who were accustomed to fermented alcoholic drinks such as \"makgeolli\". Mongol camps such as Kaesong, Andong and Jeju Island are well-known \"soju\"-producing regions. During the late 20th century, \"soju\" flavored with lemon or green tea became available. The Japanese version is known as \"shōchū\".\n\n\"Danyangbeop\" (single-brew) or \"leeyangbeop\" (double-brew) are traditional grain-wine brewing methods. \"Takju\" or \"cheongju\" is distilled to produce \"soju\". Andong \"soju\" distinctive flavor is well known in the city. \"Okroju\" from Gyeonggi Province originated in Hanyang during the late Joseon dynasty. \"Munbae-ju\" is South Korea's Important Intangible Cultural Property 86‑1. It is a traditional liquor made from malted millet, sorghum, wheat, rice and \"nuruk\", with a strength of 40 percent alcohol by volume. \"Munbae-ju\" originated in the Pyongyang region and is known for its fragrance, which is said to resemble the flower of the \"munbae\" (pear) tree.\n\nDistilled liquors also include \"goryangju\" and \"okroju\".\n\n\"Yagyong-jeungryuju\" (medicinal liquor) include:\n\nKorea has a number of traditional fruit wines, produced by combining fruits or berries with alcohol. \"Podoju\" (포도주, 葡萄酒) is made from rice wine which is mixed with grapes. The most popular fruit wines include \"maesil-ju\" (made from plums), \"bokbunja-ju\" (made from Korean black raspberries), and wines made from Chinese quinces, cherries and pomegranates.\n\"Gwasilju\" is usually made from fruits or grains. In the spring, people make alcoholic drinks with azaleas, forsythia, peaches and pears. In the summer, lotuses and roses are often used. In the fall, chrysanthemum, yuzu, Korean wild grapes, black raspberries and apples are often infused. In the winter, Asian apricot is sometimes used.\n\nBeer (called \"maekju\"; hangul: 맥주; hanja: 麥 酒 in Korean) was introduced to Korea by Europeans, and there are several breweries in South Korea.\n\n\n"}

Her father, Karol, whose background was Armenian, was a trustee of a farm for a Polish baron. Although she has Czech origins, she always emphasized her Polish nationality. She finished her primary and secondary school extramural (at home) with very good grades. After baccalaureate she started studies in the Music Conservatory of Lwów, when she discovered talents in poetry and sculpture. She was also an instructor of physical education in Sokół, and a member of the Eleusis organization, where she met Andrzej Małkowski. He convinced her to join Zarzewie, a Polish independence organization, where she became a Lieutenant.\n\nOlga Drahonowska was introduced to Scouting by her friend, and later husband, Andrzej Juliusz Małkowski. She became Scoutmaster (harcmistrzyni) of the 3rd Lwów Girl Scout Company (the 1st, 2nd and 4th Companies were Boy Scouts). This consisted of about twenty girls aged between 15 and 20 years. She was also first chief of Girl Guides in Poland (1911–1912). She and Ignacy Kozielewski were co-authors of the lyrics to the Polish Scout anthem \"Wszystko co nasze\". In 1913 she moved to Zakopane to benefit her health. There she married Andrzej Małkowski. The priest who tied the knot was Kazimierz Lutosławski.\n\nIn the summer of 1914, just before the start of World War I, her health having recovered, Drahonowska-Małkowska organised the first national Scout camp. Girls (by now renamed Guides) who originated from the Russian and German-controlled areas of Poland came to the camp under assumed names and false passports. One girl turned out to be a spy and was caught looking through Drahonowska-Małkowska's tent for a list of these Guides names.\n\nOne morning a detachment of the Secret Military Police (some of whom were brothers to the Guides) came to announce that war had been declared. Andrzej Małkowski wrote to say the camp should close at once and that, as the borders had closed, he had found accommodation in Zakopane for those girls who could not get home. The Małkowski's were asked by the Mayor of Zakopane to organise the night watch for the town because there was insufficient police and older people were too scared.\n\nAndrzej Małkowski decided to join the Polish Legions, along with many of the boys in his Scout troop. Before he left, he organised a cottage for his wife and the boys and girls who had no homes, and she opened a café to earn her living. After Małkowski left, there was one Boy Scout troop and one large Girl Guide Company of 300 girls. They paraded each morning in the central square and gave reports to and took orders from Drahonowska-Małkowska. They took on a huge number of tasks including supplementing the postal service, organising a children's home, helping with the harvest, and setting up a hospital. In 1915 they were forced to leave Zakopane by the Austrian government, and they moved through Switzerland to the United States. Their son Lutyk, was born in the USA on 30 October 1915, and after that returned to Switzerland in 1916, where she worked as a teacher and custodian of the Polish museum. In 1919 Andrzej Małkowski died on a mission given him by Polish Army. She never remarried.\n\nIn 1921 Małkowska decided to come back to Poland, where she started working as a teacher in Zakopane, and started scoutmaster courses in Kuźnice. In 1924 she was chief of Girl Guides meeting in Świder (near Warsaw), and chief of the Polish contingent for Girl Guides Scoutmasters Meeting in Foxlease, England. In 1925 she set up the School of Scout Work in Sromowce Wyżne which was an orphanage and boarding school for Polish children. Her school was considered a very modern centre of new education and promoter Scouting principles. She was also given the rank of Harcmistrz Rzeczypospolitej.\n\nIn 1932 she was leading VII World Girl Guides Conference in Bucz, where she was elected to the Girl Guides World Committee. She was also elected Scout delegate to the Committee of Child and Adolescent in the League of Nations. The Polish government awarded her the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta and the Cross of Independence.\n\nAt the start of World War II, Drahonowska-Małkowska was running a school using Scouting principles. When war broke out she took the children by train to a neutral country. The train was frequently under fire from machine guns mounted on aeroplanes. Drahonowska-Małkowska claimed that the children's Scouting training saved their lives, as when the train was attacked, the children were disciplined enough to obey her order to scatter, which made them far less easy targets for snipers than other passengers who formed huddles. She decided to move to the U.K. When she reached the UK, the Girl Guides Association (now Girlguiding UK) awarded her their Bronze Cross for Gallantry. She set up a Polish orphanage, and worked in the Polish Scout organization. She was also organising food transport for children in Warsaw. \n\nBetween 1948-60 Małkowska was leading the Polish Children's Home in Hawson Court in Buckfastleigh, Devon. She moved to Poland in 1961, first living in Wrocław ul. Nowa 8 in the former house of Corps Borussia Breslau and then in Zakopane. She was given the Honour Medal of Friend of Children.

The River Wensum flows through the village. The village has a large maltings which has been producing malt on a traditional malting floor for two centuries. The village and maltings were formerly served by Ryburgh station on the Great Eastern Railway branch from Wymondham and East Dereham to Fakenham and Wells-next-the-Sea.

It was historically part of the East Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It is on the edge of the Yorkshire Wolds, approximately south-west of Filey, south of Scarborough and north of Bridlington. The village is on the route of the Centenary Way.\n\nAccording to the 2011 UK census, Hunmanby parish had a population of 3,132, a decrease on the 2001 UK census figure of 3,279.\n\nIt is served by Hunmanby railway station on the Yorkshire Coast Line, which runs between Hull and Scarborough.\n\nThe village's name of Hunmanby originated with the Danes, appearing in King William's \"Domesday Book\" (published in 1086) as 'Hundemanbi' meaning 'farmstead of the hounds men', relating to the hunting down of wolves on the Yorkshire Wolds.\n\nEvidence exists showing that Hunmanby was occupied by much earlier people than the Danes. A landslip occurred in 1907 revealing a British chariot burial site from the 1st or 2nd century BC, in which a chariot was buried horse and all. A tumulus on a local farm was opened up to reveal an ancient burial site containing 15 skeletons. Roman pottery and flint axe and arrowheads are frequently found in and around Hunmanby.\n\nGiven by William the Conqueror to Gilbert de Gant, De Gant lived in a house \"without the town\" named Le Burlyn (Old French for wool house), regarded to be built on the site where now stands Low Hall, the manor of Hunmanby became one of the most powerful in the North of England. His son Walter founded Bridlington Priory. Hunmanby was the site of a castle (fortress in some descriptions) which was built by Gilbert de Gant. It was destroyed during the \"Battle of Hunmanby\" by William le Gros (the Earl of York) and the Constable of Chester, Eustace fitz John during a period of history known as The Anarchy. The site of the castle is now known as Castle Hill.\n\nThe manor changed hands through the centuries many times the manor maintained its importance until the end of the 19th century, when the hereditary Lords of the Manor sold the estate piece by piece. The manor belonged from the 1620s to the 1830s to the Osbaldestons, a branch of a prominent Lancashire family; the most notable member of the family was Richard Osbaldeston, Bishop of London 1762–64. The manor passed by inheritance to the Mitford family, of whom the most notable was the novelist Bertram Mitford.\n\nIt was the main market town for the East Riding of Yorkshire and is said to be the last place in England where King Stephen kept his wolfhounds. It has a number of important buildings including Low Hall. The original hall, which dates from the 11th century, and Hunmanby Hall, a Queen Anne era building erected to replace the original hall on a more elevated site. The lodge and gateway to the hall were built using stones taken from Filey Brigg.\n\nAfter the death of Lord Nunburnholme in the early part of the 19th century, the Hall was bought by the Methodist Education Committee and re-opened in April 1928 as a boarding school for girls. The school closed in 1991 and could take up to 300 girls.\n\nAll Saints' Church is partly 12th century (though it is believed a Saxon church stood on the site before the present one). It was renovated in 1845 and is now grade II* listed.\n\nHunmanby used to be on the main coaching road between Scarborough and Hull. The A165 road bypasses the town by a to the east. The village is served by an hourly bus service between Bridlington and Scarborough with a one-day stopping coach service between Scarborough and London serving a holiday park to the east on the A165 at Hunmanby Moor.\n\nThe holiday park at Hunmanby Moor used to be the Filey Butlin's resort. This had its own spur railway from the railway line between Scarborough and Hull (now the Yorkshire Coast Line). Whilst the railway to the holiday park closed down in 1977, a railway station has been located at Hunmanby since October 1847 when the line first opened. Services are hourly between Hull and Scarborough each way, with the station being on an isolated two track section on a largely single line between and .\n\nHunmanby has a number of businesses located within the village, despite its small size. These include Deep Sea Electronics Plc, Cirrus Research Plc, Humprenco, Peninsula Group, Barcodereaders.com, the Apollo Group and the Beck Engineering Group. In 2017 Yorkshire's first Whisky distillery was opened on Hunmanby Industrial Estate by the owners of the nearby Wold Top Brewery.\n\nThe dinosaurs for Blackgang Chine on the Isle of Wight were manufactured in Hunmanby by Beck Engineering and featured on the TV series \"Blue Peter\". Historically it was the home of the Solar Dome greenhouse company, who made an unusual geodetic dome-shaped greenhouse and also had one of only two car manufacturers in Yorkshire in 1911.\n\nHunmanby is also the location of a television transmitter which acts as a local relay filler for Filey, Bridlington and the surrounding villages which are unable to receive transmissions from Oliver's Mount and Belmont. It also is a terminal for the VSNL Northern Europe submarine telecommunications cable connecting with De Marne in the Netherlands. Hunmanby receives a daily news service from local commercial radio station Yorkshire Coast Radio.\n\nIn 2010, Hunmanby won a Silver-gilt at the Britain in Bloom awards, this was the first time the village had entered the competition.\n\nThere is also an Autograss track just outside the village. In July 2018, actress and radio presenter Roxanne Pallett crashed whilst racing at the site. She was cut free from the wreckage and airlifted to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.\n\n\n"}

The Institute is part of the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) and is supported by the Science Mission Directorate of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Located at 3600 Bay Area Boulevard in Houston, Texas, the LPI maintains an extensive collection of lunar and planetary data, carries out education and public outreach programs, and offers meeting coordination and publishing services. The LPI sponsors and organizes several workshops and conferences throughout the year, including the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC) held in March in the Houston area.\n\nIn his March 1968 speech at the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) in Houston, Texas, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced the formation of the Lunar Science Institute (LSI).\n\n\"We will welcome here all who are interested in the sciences of space. We will strengthen the cooperation between NASA and our universities. And we will set new patterns of scientific cooperation which will have profound effects on man's knowledge of his universe.\"\n-- President Lyndon B. Johnson, March 1, 1968\n\"The institute will provide a base for outside scientists, encouraging them to visit the Manned Spacecraft Center and use its laboratories, lunar photographs, and (ultimately) its rock samples. LSI is viewed as a major potential stimulus to lunar science at MSC and elsewhere.\"\n\nThis announcement was the culmination of meetings and events involving NASA, the National Academy of Sciences, Universities Research Association and several major universities. Initially operated by the National Academy of Sciences, USRA took over the management of the Lunar Science Institute on December 11, 1969.\n\nDr. William W. Rubey was appointed the first director of the Lunar Science Institute. Dr. Rubey led the institute through the transition to the new management operation under USRA. A program of visiting university-based scientists was established, the first symposium was organized, and the first lecture of the LSI seminar series was presented. The Lunar Science Institute was formally dedicated on January 4, 1970, at the former West Mansion on NASA Road 1 near the Manned Spacecraft Center.\n\nDr. Thomas R. McGetchin was appointed director in 1977. Under his leadership, Dr. McGetchin expanded the focus of the Lunar Science Institute to include the study of the entire Solar System, and the name was changed to the Lunar and Planetary Institute.\n\nIn 1991, under the leadership of Dr. David C. Black, the LPI moved into a new facility. This new building combined several USRA divisions and operations into one location. The building, dedicated in January 1992, provided more office, meeting, computer and library space and improved USRA-Houston operations.\n\nThe LPI continues to operate in the USRA-Houston building under the direction of Dr. Louise Prockter.\n\nResearch topics of the LPI include the formation and evolution of the Solar System, petrology and geochemistry of planetary materials and volatiles, planetary interiors, volcanism, tectonism, and impact cratering. Research interests range from Mercury to Pluto and the icy moons of the Solar System.\nThe LPI currently maintains a staff of resident scientists as well as visiting scientists, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate fellows. Resident scientists provide planetary science expertise necessary for the LPI to achieve its goals and maintain their scientific proficiency through peer-reviewed activities.\n\nThe Center for Lunar Science and Exploration, a collaborative effort of the Lunar and Planetary Institute and the Johnson Space Center and an integral part of the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) (formerly the NASA Lunar Science Institute), was established in 2009. The Center is designed to develop a core, multi-institutional lunar science program, provide scientific and technical expertise to NASA, support the development of a lunar science community, and develop lunar science education and outreach programs.\n\nThe LPI provides support for a number of NASA's community analysis groups, including:\n\nCuration and Analysis Planning Team for Extraterrestrial Materials (CAPTEM) - responsible for the care and distribution of all extraterrestrial samples collected by NASA including the Apollo lunar samples, materials from sample return missions, and solid materials of the Solar System\n\nLunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG) - responsible for analyzing scientific, technical, commercial, and operational issues associated with lunar exploration in response to requests by NASA\n\nMars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) - responsible for providing science input for planning and prioritizing future Mars exploration activities for the next several decades\n\nOuter Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) - responsible for identifying the scientific priorities and pathways for exploration in the outer solar system\n\nOptimizing Science and Exploration Working Group (OSEWG) - responsible for guiding exploration and science investigations during lunar sortie and outpost missions, with extensibility to future Mars missions\n\nSmall Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) - responsible for identifying scientific priorities and opportunities for the exploration of asteroids, comets, interplanetary dust, small satellites, and trans-Neptunian objects and for providing scientific input on the utility of asteroids and comets in support of human space activities\n\nVenus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) - responsible for identifying scientific priorities and strategy for the exploration of Venus\n\nMapping and Planetary Spatial Infrastructure Team (MAPSIT) - ensuring that planetary data are usable for any purpose, now and in the future\n\nThe LPI hosts a Summer Intern Program providing undergraduates an opportunity to participate in cutting-edge research in the planetary sciences. LPI Summer Interns work one-on-one with scientists at the LPI or at the Johnson Space Center to complete research projects of current interest. The Summer Intern Program allows participants to experience a real research environment, to learn from leading planetary scientists, and to preview careers in research.\n\nFrom 2008 through 2013, the LPI also hosted a Lunar Exploration Summer Intern Program designed to evaluate possible landing sites for robotic and human exploration missions. Interns worked with LPI scientific staff and other collaborators. The program was open to graduate students in geology, planetary science, and related fields, and undergraduates with at least 50 semester hours of credit. In 2015, a new Exploration Science Summer Intern Program was established, building on the success of the previous program, but with a broader scope that includes both the Moon and near-Earth asteroids.\n\nThe LPI organizes and sponsors a number of planetary science workshops and conferences throughout the year in both domestic and international locations, including the annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. This important five-day meeting held in the Houston area in March brings together international specialists in petrology, geochemistry, geophysics, geology, and astronomy to present scientific findings in planetary science. The LPSC dates back to the days of the Apollo program and the early meetings focusing on the study of the lunar samples. After 50 years, this conference continues to thrive, drawing planetary scientists and researchers from around the world.\n\nThe LPI has collaborated on a number of publications in the prestigious Space Science Series of the University of Arizona Press, including \"Asteroids III\" (), \"Comets II\" (), \"Europa\" (), \"Meteorites and the Early Solar System II\" (), \"Origin of the Earth and Moon\" (), \"Protostars and Planets V\" (), \"The Solar System Beyond Neptune\" (), and \"Comparative Climatology of Terrestrial Planets\" (). The LPI also publishes a large number of planetary science workshop and meeting documents every year as well as a quarterly newsletter, \"Lunar and Planetary Information Bulletin\". Since June 2014, eighteen lunar and planetary science books, most published by LPI such as \"Traces of Catastrophe\" and \"Lunar Stratigraphy and Sedimentology\", have been available online.\n\nThe LPI has a long tradition of space science education and public outreach through a number of programs and resources. This effort serves a wide variety of audiences, including K-12 students and educators, undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students, and the public in formal and informal venues and on local, regional, and national levels.\n\nThese programs and resources include the following:\n\n\"Explore!\" Fun with Science - a program designed to bring space science into libraries and informal learning environments\n\nSkyFest - a series of free programs open to all ages that offers night sky viewing opportunities and hands-on activities about four times a year\n\nCosmic Explorations: A Speakers Series - a series of free public lectures presented by international experts in space science (past lectures are made available online at the LPI website)\n\nThe LPI library contains more than 60,000 cataloged books, documents, maps, films and videos, and print and electronic journals and newsletters. The subject emphasis of the collection is planetary science and geology, with limited collection development extending into the secondary support field of computer science remote sensing. There is an ongoing effort to scan and make available to the scientific community and the general public a number of out-of-print planetary science books, NASA documents and images, and related works. (These publications are copyright-free or made available with permission.)\n\nThis collection is a NASA Regional Planetary Image Facility (RPIF) and includes photographs, maps, and other data from planetary missions including Apollo, Lunar Orbiter, \"Clementine\", \"Mars Pathfinder\", \"Voyager 1\", \"Voyager 2\", Magellan, \"Galileo\", and Mars Global Surveyor.\n\n"}

{"id": "2319156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319156", "title": "Great Oil Sniffer Hoax", "text": "Great Oil Sniffer Hoax\n\nThe Great Oil Sniffer Hoax was a 1979 scandal involving French oil company Elf Aquitaine. The company spent millions of dollars to develop a new gravity wave-based oil detection system, which was later revealed to be a scam. Elf lost over $150 million to the hoax. In France, the scandal is known as the \"Avions Renifleurs\" (\"Sniffer Aircraft\").\n\nAlthough Bonassoli's \"sniffer\" was a hoax, gravity is used by professional geologists to locate oil using very sensitive gravity meters. This works because gravity is a function of the mass of an object, and oil-rich deposits' mass is different than the surrounding subterranean geology.\n\nAldo Bonassoli, a telephone-company electrician in Ventimiglia in Italy, invented a new type of desalination system. In 1965, Belgian Count Alain de Villegas became interested in the idea and later said that \"We can live without oil, but not without water.\" When the device proved not to work as expected, the team started work on a related concept, a \"water sniffer\" that would find water.\n\nDe Villegas was also a member of the Pan-European Union, an anti-communist group headquartered in Brussels. Through contacts in this group, in 1969 they met Jean Violet, a lawyer who worked for the Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage (SDECE), the French intelligence agency. Violet, who was an influential behind-the-scenes player in the pro-Europe anti-communist world, had formed the Pinay Circle in the 1950s around its titular leader, Antoine Pinay.\n\nViolet expressed interest in the water sniffer, and agreed to attempt to arrange development funding. An attempt to interest Crosby Kelly in New York failed when Kelly stated he would only put up money if the device first proved itself able to work. A friend of Violet's, Italian industrialist Carlo Pesenti, proved more interested and agreed to start funding early development. A new company formed in Switzerland: Fisalma, Inc. (registered in Panama), under the direction of Philippe de Weck, president of Union des Banques Suisses (later part of UBS AG from the 1990s). Through contacts in Opus Dei, Violet arranged for Spain's tourism minister, Alfredo Sánchez Bella, to put several test sites in Spain at the team's disposal.\n\nAlthough the tests found the sniffer to be unsuccessful, in the midst of the testing the Yom Kippur War of October 1973 broke out and oil prices quadrupled. De Villegas kept his project alive by announcing that the machines could also detect oil, persuading Pesenti to invest additional funds. Using contacts provided by Pinay, they flew their equipment to South Africa and gained government authorization to conduct tests over Zululand. Pesenti's engineers fitted one of the machines into a Douglas DC-3 for the surveys. A site claimed to be promising was identified and drilling began, but by the end of 1975 the costs had become so great that Pesenti opted out. The Zululand bore eventually bottomed out at 6,000 metres with a drill stem and no oil.\n\nAlthough the connection remains unclear to this day, some time in 1976 de Villegas and Bonassoli were introduced to Elf officials, apparently through de Villegas or Violet's connections in the French intelligence services. Bonassoli explained that he had been tinkering with televisions when he hit upon the idea of building his gravity wave detector that could be used to detect masses underwater - not just oil, but submarines as well. He had developed these into two machines, \"Delta\" detected oil from the air and output a paper report, while \"Omega\" mapped out the resources from closer ranges and displayed on a TV screen. He was willing to demonstrate the devices, but only if there were no scientists present, claiming that they might steal his ideas. Information about the pair's invention quickly made their way up the French political hierarchy.\n\nIn spite of the obvious scientific problems that would have turned up had they been investigated, there is no record of anyone involved having attempted any sort of scientific due diligence. Nor is there any record of any sort of background check, which would have turned up the string of previous failures. Such an obvious oversight on the part of the officials might sound odd, but writers have commented on a sort of political chauvinism that surrounded the project. At the time Elf was almost wholly controlled by the government, as were similar companies in other European nations and Canada. Unlike those companies, Elf had little crude oil supply of its own, and few known deposits for future commercialization. Elf was in danger of losing its status as a producer, at some point becoming nothing more than another refiner. If the devices could find new sources of oil practically anywhere, as was being claimed, Elf might remain among the small family of oil-producing European nations. This possibility was so attractive that the official involved overlooked any doubts that were expressed, while also keeping the project completely secret.\n\nBetween 30 April and 7 May 1976 the devices were demonstrated for Elf officials, who obliged Bonassoli's \"no scientists\" request. The devices, not much larger than a few photocopiers, were installed in a transport plane behind curtains and flown around over known oil fields. Sure enough the device flashed lights, drew lines on the attached TV, and printed paper with a sort of topographical map on it. The map looked almost identical to previously published public exploration reports. The Elf observers, including company founder Pierre Guillaumat, were completely convinced that the devices were real.\n\nIn May 1976 Elf signed a 200 million Swiss Franc (USD 80 million) contract for a two-year exclusive use while the device was tested. When this contract was complete, a second would take over in 1978 for an additional 250 million Francs (USD 130 million), expenses not included. This was apparently done without Elf's civilian board of directors being made aware of the project.\n\nFrance's president, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, was told of the devices in June 1976 and was aware of the development contracts being given to de Villegas' Fisalma. Four months later the new prime minister, Raymond Barre, learned of devices when his signature was required to waive various currency restrictions in order to transfer the funds abroad to the company's Swiss bank account. To keep the project secret, the funds were transferred through previously small Elf bank accounts.\n\nIn spite of numerous \"successful\" flights, every attempt to drill at the indicated locations came up empty. Bonassoli repeatedly stated that it appeared to be \"too accurate\" to be used and required further development. Their Elf contacts remained confident in the devices in spite of the failures, and would happily provide documentation of previous studies on the fields that were going to be flown over in the tests. These studies were then parroted back through the devices, further convincing the Elf managers that the devices worked.\n\nThings started to change when management of Elf passed from Guillaumat to Albin Chalandon. Initially a supporter of the project, after examining project documentation, Chalandon was forced to admit that there was not a single usable result from the tests. In May 1979 he arranged for Jules Horowitz, chief of research and development for France's atomic energy agency, to visit the lab and examine \"Omega\". Instead of examining the device itself, he started asking Bonassoli questions about the Omega's capability to detect various common objects through a wall. After two failures, Bonassoli eventually agreed that it could easily detect a metal ruler. Bonassoli turned on the device, and sure enough out came a piece of paper with a short line on it. Horowitz returned from behind the wall and held up the ruler, which he had bent into a L shape while hidden from view.\n\nOddly, work continued. A month later another demonstration further revealed the hoax. Omega was shown to be outputting graphics projected from within the box. Further investigation showed that what was inside one cabinet did not simply appear to be a photocopier, but actually \"was\" a photocopier. This was the reason the devices' output always looked so similar to previous reports; Bonassoli was hand-copying them, and then simply pressed \"copy\" to generate output that looked similar, but slightly different, than the originals they had provided. Bonassoli attempted to deflect all criticism by stating that the entire secret of the device was one key component, which was locked in a box that he refused to open. But it was too late, Elf realized they had been hoodwinked.\n\nEven after the hoax was discovered, the government did little to address the problem. Bonassoli managed to successfully return to Italy, where he became something of a folk hero. Elf never completed paying for the final contract, but nevertheless had spent over $150 million in total.\n\nAll of France's quasi-public corporations were audited by the Cour des Comptes. In 1979 the magistrate in charge of Elf's audit, François Giquel, asked about the sudden change in certain accounts. These had contained only small amounts of money for many years, around 3 million Francs, and then suddenly grew to hundreds of millions of Francs over the last three years. The President personally informed Giquel that it was a matter of military secret, and he was sworn to secrecy. In 1982, Bernard Beck, president of the Cour des Comptes and a political ally of Giscard d'Estaing, shredded three key documents about the case at the auditor's office, as well as Giquel's office copy.\n\nThe story finally broke in December 1983. The junior Secretary for the Treasury publicly accused Beck of \"forfaiture\" (\"abuse of authority\") for destroying the documents. The same week Pierre Péan published a complete history of the story in the satirical magazine \"Le Canard Enchaîné\", apparently tipped off by government insiders. The new president, François Mitterrand, seized on the story to attack his predecessor for his involvement in the \"cover up\", going on to claim that they had destroyed all of the documents. Giscard d'Estaing responded on television, brandishing another copy of the report which he had in his own possession, and claiming that its existence proved that the entire affair was simply a case of political maneuvering.\n\nThis proved to be a bad idea; the report was seized and subsequently published in full. On 2 January 1984 it was released live on television by the new Prime Minister, Pierre Mauroy. Mauroy sarcastically accused Barre and Giscard of trying to cover up the embarrassing story. Giscard appeared on television a second time, attacking Mitterrand for \"having allowed his predecessor to be attacked\". \"The Economist\" claimed that Mitterrand used his influence to have a public investigation into Giscard quashed.\n\nIn January 1984, Bonassoli held a press conference in Italy, claiming that he would hand over all the data on his machine to the Italian National Research Council (CNR). He also stated that the Soviets had expressed an interest in the machine. When asked about the claims of fraud, Bonassoli simply replied that the machine had been greatly improved since the 1970s. Nothing ever came of the announcement.\n\n"}
{"id": "2319157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319157", "title": "Rock cycle", "text": "Rock cycle\n\nThe rock cycle is a basic concept in geology that describes transitions through geologic time among the three main rock types: sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous. Each rock type is altered when it is forced out of its equilibrium conditions. For example, an igneous rock such as basalt may break down and dissolve when exposed to the atmosphere, or melt as it is subducted under a continent. Due to the driving forces of the rock cycle, plate tectonics and the water cycle, rocks do not remain in equilibrium and change as they encounter new environments. The rock cycle explains how the three rock types are related to each other, and how processes change from one type to another over time. This cyclical aspect makes rock change a geologic cycle and, on planets containing life, a biogeochemical cycle.\n\nWhen rocks are pushed deep under the Earth's surface, they may melt into magma. If the conditions no longer exist for the magma to stay in its liquid state, it cools and solidifies into an igneous rock. A rock that cools within the Earth is called intrusive or plutonic and cools very slowly, producing a coarse-grained texture such as the rock granite. As a result of volcanic activity, magma (which is called lava when it reaches Earth's surface) may cool very rapidly while being on the Earth's surface exposed to the atmosphere and are called extrusive or volcanic rocks. These rocks are fine-grained and sometimes cool so rapidly that no crystals can form and result in a natural glass, such as obsidian, however the most common fine-grained rock would be known as basalt. Any of the three main types of rocks (igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks) can melt into magma and cool into igneous rocks.\n\nEpigenetic change (secondary processes occurring at low temperatures and low pressures) may be arranged under a number of headings, each of which is typical of a group of rocks or rock-forming minerals, though usually more than one of these alterations is in progress in the same rock. Silicification, the replacement of the minerals by crystalline or crypto-crystalline silica, is most common in felsic rocks, such as rhyolite, but is also found in serpentine, etc. Kaolinization is the decomposition of the feldspars, which are the most common minerals in igneous rocks, into kaolin (along with quartz and other clay minerals); it is best shown by granites and syenites. Serpentinization is the alteration of olivine to serpentine (with magnetite); it is typical of peridotites, but occurs in most of the mafic rocks. In uralitization, secondary hornblende replaces augite; chloritization is the alteration of augite (biotite or hornblende) to chlorite, and is seen in many diabases, diorites and greenstones. Epidotization occurs also in rocks of this group, and consists in the development of epidote from biotite, hornblende, augite or plagioclase feldspar.\n\nRocks exposed to high temperatures and pressures can be changed physically or chemically to form a different rock, called metamorphic. Regional metamorphism refers to the effects on large masses of rocks over a wide area, typically associated with mountain building events within orogenic belts. These rocks commonly exhibit distinct bands of differing mineralogy and colors, called foliation. Another main type of metamorphism is caused when a body of rock comes into contact with an igneous intrusion that heats up this surrounding country rock. This \"contact metamorphism\" results in a rock that is altered and re-crystallized by the extreme heat of the magma and/or by the addition of fluids from the magma that add chemicals to the surrounding rock (metasomatism). Any pre-existing type of rock can be modified by the processes of metamorphism.\n\nRocks exposed to the atmosphere are variably unstable and subject to the processes of weathering and erosion. Weathering and erosion break the original rock down into smaller fragments and carry away dissolved material. This fragmented material accumulates and is buried by additional material. While an individual grain of sand is still a member of the class of rock it was formed from, a rock made up of such grains fused together is sedimentary. Sedimentary rocks can be formed from the lithification of these buried smaller fragments (clastic sedimentary rock), the accumulation and lithification of material generated by living organisms (biogenic sedimentary rock - fossils), or lithification of chemically precipitated material from a mineral bearing solution due to evaporation (precipitate sedimentary rock). Clastic rocks can be formed from fragments broken apart from larger rocks of any type, due to processes such as erosion or from organic material, like plant remains. Biogenic and precipitate rocks form from the deposition of minerals from chemicals dissolved from all other rock types.\n\nIn 1967, J. Tuzo Wilson published an article in Nature describing the repeated opening and closing of ocean basins, in particular focusing on the current Atlantic Ocean area. This concept, a part of the plate tectonics revolution, became known as the \"Wilson cycle\". The Wilson cycle has had profound effects on the modern interpretation of the rock cycle as plate tectonics became recognized as the driving force for the rock cycle.\n\nAt the mid-ocean divergent boundaries \"new\" magma is produced by mantle upwelling and a shallow \"melting zone\". This \"juvenile\" basaltic magma is an early phase of the igneous portion of the cycle. As the tectonic plates on either side of the ridge move apart the new rock is carried away from the ridge, the interaction of heated circulating seawater through fractures starts the retrograde metamorphism of the new rock.\n\nThe new basaltic oceanic crust eventually meets a subduction zone as it moves away from the spreading ridge. As this crust is pulled back into the mantle, the increasing pressure and temperature conditions cause a restructuring of the mineralogy of the rock, this metamorphism alters the rock to form eclogite. As the slab of basaltic crust and some included sediments are dragged deeper, water and other more volatile materials are driven off and rise into the overlying wedge of rock above the subduction zone, which is at a lower pressure. The lower pressure, high temperature, and now volatile rich material in this wedge melts and the resulting buoyant magma rises through the overlying rock to produce island arc or continental margin volcanism. This volcanism includes more silicic lavas the further from the edge of the island arc or continental margin, indicating a deeper source and a more differentiated magma.\n\nAt times some of the metamorphosed downgoing slab may be thrust up or obducted onto the continental margin. These blocks of mantle peridotite and the metamorphic eclogites are exposed as ophiolite complexes.\n\nThe newly erupted volcanic material is subject to rapid erosion depending on the climate conditions. These sediments accumulate within the basins on either side of an island arc. As the sediments become more deeply buried lithification begins and sedimentary rock results.\n\nOn the closing phase of the classic Wilson cycle, two continental or smaller terranes meet at a convergent zone. As the two masses of continental crust meet, neither can be subducted as they are both \"low density\" silicic rock. As the two masses meet, tremendous compressional forces distort and modify the rocks involved. The result is regional metamorphism within the interior of the ensuing orogeny or mountain building event. As the two masses are compressed, folded and faulted into a mountain range by the continental collision the whole suite of pre-existing igneous, volcanic, sedimentary and earlier metamorphic rock units are subjected to this new metamorphic event.\n\nThe high mountain ranges produced by continental collisions are immediately subjected to the forces of erosion. Erosion wears down the mountains and massive piles of sediment are developed in adjacent ocean margins, shallow seas, and as continental deposits. As these sediment piles are buried deeper they become lithified into sedimentary rock. The metamorphic, igneous, and sedimentary rocks of the mountains become the new piles of sediments in the adjoining basins and eventually become sedimentary rock.\n\nThe plate tectonics rock cycle is an evolutionary process. Magma generation, both in the spreading ridge environment and within the wedge above a subduction zone, favors the eruption of the more silicic and volatile rich fraction of the crustal or upper mantle material. This lower density material tends to stay within the crust and not be subducted back into the mantle. The magmatic aspects of plate tectonics tends to gradual segregation within or between the mantle and crust. As magma forms, the initial melt is composed of the more silicic phases that have a lower melting point. This leads to partial melting and further segregation of the lithosphere. In addition the silicic continental crust is relatively buoyant and is not normally subducted back into the mantle. So over time the continental masses grow larger and larger.\n\nThe presence of abundant water on Earth is of great importance for the rock cycle. Most obvious perhaps are the water driven processes of weathering and erosion. Water in the form of precipitation and acidic soil water and groundwater is quite effective at dissolving minerals and rocks, especially those igneous and metamorphic rocks and marine sedimentary rocks that are unstable under near surface and atmospheric conditions. The water carries away the ions dissolved in solution and the broken-down fragments that are the products of weathering. Running water carries vast amounts of sediment in rivers back to the ocean and inland basins. The accumulated and buried sediments are converted back into rock.\n\nA less obvious role of water is in the metamorphism processes that occur in fresh seafloor volcanic rocks as seawater, sometimes heated, flows through the fractures and crevices in the rock. All of these processes, illustrated by serpentinization, are an important part of the destruction of volcanic rock.\n\nThe role of water and other volatiles in the melting of existing crustal rock in the wedge above a subduction zone is a most important part of the cycle. Along with water, the presence of carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds from abundant marine limestone within the sediments atop the down going slab is another source of melt inducing volatiles. This involves the carbon cycle as a part of the overall rock cycle.\n\n\n"}

He was the head of the \"Mecelle\" commission that codified Islamic law for the first time in response to the Westernization of law. He is often regarded as a pioneer in the codification of a civil law based on the European legal system. The Mecelle remained intact in several modern Arab states in the early and mid-20th-century. In addition to Turkish, he was proficient in Arabic, Persian, French and Bulgarian. He wrote numerous books on history, law, grammar, linguistics, logic and astronomy. \n\nAhmed Cevdet Pasha was born in 1822 in Lofça, Ottoman Bulgaria. He came from the notable family of Yularkiranoglu that had served the state and the faith as military, administrative, and religious officials. It was his grandfather's, Hacı Ali Efendi, wish that Ahmed pursued a career in the religious, \"ilmiye\", ranks. Ahmed was his original name; the name \"Cevdet\" (Jevdet) was given to him by his tutor Süleyman Fehim Efendi in 1843.\n\nAhmed Cevdet began his education at a very early age. He started with his study of Arabic grammar from Hafız Ömer Efendi, who was the \"mufti\" of Lovech at the time. With his demonstrated rapid progress, Ahmed was soon introduced to the Islamic sciences. In 1836, he started reading with Hacı Esref Efendi, the deputy judge of Lovech who had a son that was Ahmed Cevdet's age. These two boys, who were both named Ahmed, went on to become famous as Ahmet Cevdet Pasha and Ahmed Midhat Pasha. So far, his elementary education had followed the traditional Muslim Ottoman pattern, being acquired through informal study with the local ulema.\n\nIn 1839, having finished primary school in Lofça, Ahmed's education took a more advanced turn. He moved to Constantinople (now Istanbul), studied theology, mathematics, geology, and astronomy. He learned Arabic literature in several medreses, and received a diploma, , which qualified him to serve in an \"Ilmiye\" position. Ahmed also studied Persian under Mehmed Murad Efendi (died 1848) and Süleyman Fehim Efendi, studying the \"divans\" of Orfi Shirazi and Showkat (died 1695/6). In 1844, Ahmed was granted the permission to teach the \"Masnavi\" of Rumi. Following the death of his tutor Süleyman Fehim Efendi in 1845, Ahmed completed a Turkish commentary for the Persian \"divan\" of Saib Tabrizi.\n\nAhmed also studied the mathematical sciences at the Imperial Military Engineering School (Hendesehâne). In addition, he developed an interest in the science of history as a study of the human experience by means of critical evaluation of the sources. He even went on to supplement his interests with studies of Islamic, French, and international law, before the age of 30.\n\nAfter graduation, Ahmed made a contact that would fundamentally alter the rest of his career, Mustafa Reşid Pasha, who was about to enter his first term as grand vizier. Mustafa Reşid was seeking a member of the ulema that could teach him enough about Islamic religious law so that he could avoid immediate open conflict when introducing reforms. He also needed someone who was open-minded and willing to discuss problems. Ahmed Cevdet was assigned to Mustafa's house, where he tutored Mustafa and his children and stayed at this position until his patron's death in 1858. Ahmed Cevdet's new association with leaders of the Tanzimat exposed him to novel influences and ideas that drew him into the world of bureaucracy and politics. Even though Ahmed retained his connection with the ulema until 1866, he primarily functioned as a bureaucrat, taking a prominent role in education, language, and provincial reform.\n\nIn 1850–51, Mustafa Reşid appointed Cevdet as director of a school established to train teachers for the new secular school system. Ahmed also became chief scribe to the Council on Education, which would prepare new laws and regulations for the secular schools. His career as a historian began in 1852 with the Society of Knowledge. He was assigned to compile a history of the Ottoman Empire from the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca to the destruction of the Janissary corps, so from 1774-1826. Ahmed also served as state chronicler from 1855 to 1861. Finally in 1856, he achieved his first \"Ilmiye\" position, becoming kadı (judge) of Galata, in addition to his secular duties.\n\nWhen Mustafa Reşid rose to his sixth term as grand vizier, he made Ahmed a member of the Council of the Tanzimat. The Council was established to codify the actions sanctioned by the Tanzimat reforms. Ahmed played a prominent role in preparing laws, virtually writing the new regulations on landownership and cadastral surveys. His role as a member of Council of the Tanzimat also influenced his history projects. He abandoned the old annalistic approach for one emphasizing problems and topics, with an increasingly critical examination of the sources. Additionally, Ahmed was the principal author of the regulation that created the new Supreme Council of Judicial Ordinances, of which he became a member, in place of the Council of the Tanzimat in 1861.\n\nAhmed Cevdet recognized that military and administrative reforms were necessary, but being a conservative, was reluctant to use European law as an example, opting for Islamic law. His proposed answer was two-fold. The first step was to appeal to traditional values of improving education and communication. The second part involved creating conditions which would eliminate corruption and increase efficiency, while preserving the fundamental political and social concepts upon which the Ottoman Empire was based. His attempts at reconciling modernization with Islamic law are most notably present in his drafting of the \"Mecelle\".\n\nIn the 1860s, Ahmed Cevdet officially transferred from the \"Ilmiye\" to the Scribal Institution.\nIn 1861, he was sent as a special agent to Albania to suppress revolts and develop a new administrative system. It was rumored that Ahmed would become vizier then, but he was denied of this honor due to strong opposition among the ulema. They resented his enlightened and liberal interpretation of religious matters. As a result, Mehmed Fuad Pasha became vizier and Ahmed Cevdet become the inspector general in Bosnia from 1863 to 1864. There, he extended Tanzimat reforms, despite opposition from the Habsburgs and Slavic national groups. This identified him as a leading provincial troubleshooter. Living up to this role, Ahmed attempted to settle the nomadic tribes and establish order in Kozan, located in southeastern Anatolia, in 1865. Finally in 1866, his transfer to the Scribal Institution was official and he was able to accept regular administrative positions. Ahmed became governor of Aleppo Eyalet, which was formed to apply recent Tanzimat provincial reforms introduced by Fuad, the Grand Vizier.\n\nIn 1868, the Supreme Council was divided into separate legislative and judicial bodies, and Ahmed was appointed chairman of the judicial branch. He subsequently became the first Minister of Justice and wrote major pieces of legislation, which established the beginnings of a secular \"Nizamiye\" court system in the Empire for the first time. In addition to this, Ahmed Cevdet led an opposition group against Mehmed Emin Ali Pasha's desire to introduce an entirely secular, French-inspired civil law for the court system. He convinced the sultan that the new civil code should be based on principles derived from Islamic law, modernized to meet the current situation. Ahmed served as chairman of the commission established to create this new law code, \"Mecelle\".\n\nThe \"Mecelle\", Islamic Code, was the new Ottoman civil law code proposed by Ahmed Cevdet Pasha for the newly established secular court system. It was based on traditional Islamic law, but also included many important modifications with the idea of updating the sharia according to the requirements of the time. It was the code that prevailed against Ali Pasha's push for the application of French Civil Law. The \"Mecelle\" combined Civil law with Islamic Law of Obligations in a final product consisting of 1,851 articles. This arduous task occupied Ahmed Cevdet until the last volume was published in 1876, for a total of about 16 years. It was the first systematic compilation incorporating both Islamic Law and Civil Law.\n\nThe \"Mecelle\" could not completely curtail the penetration of Western law in Ottoman society, but it was an important compromise to the demand for a standard law and for a fundamental change in the structure of Islamic legal system. Codification and enactment of Islamic law were essential for the proper functioning of a modern bureaucracy. The \"Mecelle\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s approach acknowledges the importance of social change and reflects the traditional attitude towards such change. For example, according to ulema, social change was acceptable unless it \"contradicted the general norms.\" This careful consideration for upholding the general norms in order to receive the support from the ulema was seen in the articles. They primarily consisted of provisions on Law of Obligations, but also include provisions on real rights and trail procedure laws. However, the articles did not incorporate law on persons, foundations, family, or inheritance, so the \"Mecelle\" is not a true compilation of civil law. Studies were launched in 1914 in order to correct the discrepancies, but could not be completed due to World War I.\n\nDuring the last two decades of his life, Ahmed Cevdet Pasha mainly served in ministerial positions, such as education and justice. In 1873 and 1874, he became Minister of Pious Foundations and Minister of Education, respectively. He undertook major changes in the secular system of education that had been introduced. This included reforming the elementary and middle schools, establishing a new level of preparatory schools for students wishing to go on to secondary and technical schools, and expanding teacher-training schools. While all of this was happening, efforts were made to depose Abdülaziz to secure a constitution. Ahmed opposed the idea but also opposed the government of Mahmud Nedim. As a result, he was disliked by constitutionalists and sent out of Istanbul. The grand vizier occupied Ahmed by making him inspector general to Rumelia and then governor of Syria for a year. Ahmet Cevdet Pasha's relative conservatism and experience in the ulema left him inimical towards the reformers who deposed Abdülaziz and promulgated the 1876 Ottoman constitution. However, Abdulhamid II succeeded Murad V in 1876 and soon began to dismantle the newborn First Constitutional Era in favor of a return to absolute monarchy with himself holding sole power. He succeeded in this in 1878, suspending the Ottoman parliament and the constitution. Ahmed Cevdet Pasha was close to Abdulhamid, serving as Minister of Justice in 1876, Minister of the Interior in 1877, Minister of Pious Foundations in 1878, Minister of commerce in 1879, and Minister of Justice again from 1880 to 1882.\n\nAhmed Cevdet retired from public office for a couple of years in order to educate his daughters, Fatma Aliye and Emine Semiye, and to finish his book of Ottoman history, now known as \"Tarih-i Cevdet\" (\"History of Cevdet Pasha\"). He also completed two other historical compilations, \"Tezakir\" (\"Memoirs\") and \"Maruzat\". In 1886, he returned as Minister of Justice, but resigned four years later due to quarrels with Prime Minister (Grand Vizier) Yusuf Kamil Pasha. From that point on, Ahmed Cevdet Pasha acted as an elder statesman until his death in Constantinople on 25 May 1895. He is buried in the graveyard of the Fatih Mosque.\n\nAhmed Cevdet had three children, a son, Ali Sedat (1857–1900), and two daughters. His daughters went on to become prominent figures of late Ottoman and early Turkish history. One daughter Fatma Aliye Topuz (1862–1936) is credited as the first female writer in Turkish literature. His other daughter Emine Semiye Önasya (1864–1944) was one of the first Turkish feminists and a political activist for women in the late Empire and early Republic.\n\n\n\n"}

The band signed to WEA Records, but were dropped without releasing the album they had recorded after Clive Black, who had signed the band, left the label. Harris and Rowe left soon after before Crewdson and Ryder Prangley recruited drummer Robin Guy and released several E.P.s through their own label 'Bitch Vinyl'. The band built up a considerable live following and received favourable coverage from magazines such as Kerrang!, Melody Maker and Metal Hammer. They appeared in the film 'G.M.T. Mean Time' produced by Taylor Hackford. Keyboard player Shaheena Dax joined the band in time to record \"Hymns For Strange Children\", their first official album release. It was recorded in two weeks with John Fryer (HIM, Nine Inch Nails, White Zombie) as record producer, and upon its release went to the top of the \"NME\"'s Independent Chart. Around this time the band headlined the 2000 capacity Astoria Theatre in London, England. The band next signed to Pure Stirling Records, who released their second album \"Oceans Of Venus\" in the UK. It was subsequently released in the US by Captiva Records, and in Germany through Sony Music. The video for the single 'Black Cherry' was playlisted on music channel VH1.

He is married with four children and has lived in the Highlands of Scotland since 1969.\n\nHaving been born into an ancient established family who for many generations had been Yorkshire landowners, distinguished political figures and successful industrialists with interests in both quarrying and mining, John Lister-Kaye's early fascination with natural history was something his family hoped he would eventually grow out of. In 1959, at the age of 13, his parents sent him to Allhallows School, near Lyme Regis in Devon. This was situated within an national nature reserve and near the wilderness of the Lyme Regis landslip (to which he returned with his daughter, as documented in \"Nature's Child\"). After five years in such an environment Lister-Kaye's love of nature was deep and permanent.\n\nAfter leaving school in 1964, Lister-Kaye worked in the steel industry at Port Talbot in Wales, initially as a management trainee, and continuing until 1969. He has claimed he was persuaded against his wishes to accept the post.\n\nAfter witnessing the ecological disaster that resulted from the sinking of the supertanker Torrey Canyon [off the Isles of Scilly] in 1967, Lister-Kaye then knew that a long-term career in industry was not for him. In 1968 he was invited by naturalist and author Gavin Maxwell, to move to Maxwell's home on Eilean Bàn (White Island) in the Scottish Highlands, to help him work on a book about British wild mammals and to assist with a project to build a private zoo on the island. Lister-Kaye readily accepted Maxwell's invitation, resigned from his job, and moved to Scotland in 1969. After Maxwell's unexpected death from cancer later that same year, both the book and the zoo project had to be abandoned. Rather than return to a career in industry he remained in Scotland and went into isolation to write a book about the short but eventful time he had spent with Maxwell on Eilean Bàn. His acclaimed first book, \"The White Island\", was published by Longman in 1972. It has remained in print for 30 years.\n\nIn 1970, after the completion of \"The White Island\", Lister-Kaye formed Highland Wildlife Enterprises, a natural history guiding service based at the village of Drumnadrochit, near Loch Ness. Initially he was assisted in the venture by friend and ex-employee of Gavin Maxwell, Richard Frere. Two years later this was to become Scotland's first field studies centre, and in 1972, Lister-Kaye and the field centre moved to a remote valley near Glen Affric.\n\nHe married Sorrel Bentinck, a daughter of Henry Bentinck (who later became Earl of Portland). Four years later, needing to accommodate a growing family and to be able to extend the facilities of the field centre, Lister-Kaye persuaded Inverness-shire County Council to sell him the remains of a Victorian sporting estate near Beauly called Aigas, which had previously been used by the council as an old people's home. In 1977, the Aigas Field Centre was opened by Sir Frank Fraser Darling, Scotland's most celebrated ecologist.\n\nLister-Kaye was commissioned to write a Penguin Special 'SealCull' (published 1979) on the political row that surrounded a proposal by the UK government to cull thousands of grey seals off the coast of Scotland. The book was adopted by Aberdeen University as a conservation and zoology textbook, cementing Lister-Kaye's reputation as a writer on nature and wildlife and career in the Highlands.\n\nLister-Kaye's second autobiographical work, \"The Seeing Eye: Notes of a Highland Naturalist\", which was published by Allen Lane in 1979, continues the story of his life from when he left Eilean Bàn in 1970 up until his purchase of Aigas in 1976. In his third, the best-selling\"Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey\", published in 2003, Lister-Kaye chronicles the place Aigas from the Bronze Age to development of Aigas Field Centre from its humble beginnings to what has become Scotland's premier field centre, winning international awards for environmental education and hosting travel study groups from all over the world. The book's success was to establish Lister-Kaye as one of the UK's foremost nature writers.\n\nA novel \"One for Sorrow\" followed in 1994 published by Balnain. It is a real life environmental saga, murder mystery based in the Highlands. In 2003 Lister-Kaye was appointed a \"Times\" columnist; as well as contributing features and articles to a wide variety of publications. A subsequent technical paper discussing land use paper for Scottish Natural Heritage, 'Ill Fares the Land' predicted the demise of the Highlands forecasting is current ecological predicament. A foreword by the Prince of Wales did nothing to alleviate his concerns, despite sharing a profound interest in organic sustainability for landscape cultivation.\n\nLister-Kaye's seventh book is the sequel to Song of the Rolling Earth, 'Nature's Child – Encounters with Wonders of the Natural World' (Time Warner 2004), and is about exciting expeditions and adventures with his youngest daughter Hermione. His eighth is 'At the Water's Edge' published by Canongate in 2010, subtitled 'A Personal Quest for Wildness.'\n\nIn 2000, to celebrate the millennium Lister-Kaye took ten members of his family and Aigas Field centre staff on an expedition to follow the footsteps of Laurens van der Post's across the Kalahari Desert (recounted in Nature's Child). In 2008, with his son Warwick and daughter Hermione, Lister-Kaye mounted a private Land Rover expedition up 8,000 miles of Africa's Great Rift Valley from Malawi to Ethiopia to explore and write about the human ecology of the seven countries they passed through. They returned to Scotland in time for the official opening in 2009 of Aigas Field Centre's new environmental education centre by Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay, and the Duchess of Rothesay.\n\nIn 1989 Lister-Kaye was appointed to the board of the Nature Conservancy Council, later the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland (1990) and was appointed the first Regional chairman for the Highlands & Islands of Scotland for Scottish Natural Heritage in 1991. He has also served as Chairman of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in Scotland, President of the Scottish Wildlife Trust, the Forestry Commission, and the UK's Environmental Training Agency, and is Vice-President of the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland.\n\nIn 1983 John Lister-Kaye was awarded the Wilderness Society's Gold Award for environmental education for the work of his field studies centre. In 2003 he was appointed OBE for services to the Scottish environment, in 1995 received an honorary doctorate from the University of Stirling and was awarded Honorary Membership of the Scottish Wildlife Trust. In 2006 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of St Andrews, and was made a Vice-President of the RSPB.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2319202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319202", "title": "Snow gauge", "text": "Snow gauge\n\nA snow gauge is a type of instrument used by meteorologists and hydrologists to gather and measure the amount of solid precipitation (as opposed to liquid precipitation that is measured by a rain gauge) over a set period of time.\n\nThe first use of snow gauges were precipitation gauges that was widely used in 1247 during the Southern Song dynasty to gather meteorological data. The Song Chinese mathematician and inventor Qin Jiushao records the use of gathering rain and snowfall measurements in the Song mathematical treatise \"Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections\". The book discusses the use of large conical or barrel-shaped snow gauges made from bamboo situated in mountain passes and uplands which are speculated to be first referenced to snow measurement.\n\nThe snow gauge consists of two parts, a copper catchment container and the funnel shaped gauge itself. The actual gauge is mounted on a pipe outdoors and is approximately 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) high, while the container is 51.5 cm (4 ft 2.25 in) long.\n\nWhen snow is collected, the container is removed and replaced with a spare one. The snow is then melted while it is still in the container, and then poured into a glass measuring graduate. While the depth of snow is normally measured in centimetres, the measurement of melted snow (water equivalent) is in millimetres.\n\nAn estimate of the snow depth can be obtained by multiplying the water equivalent by ten. However, this multiplier can vary over a wide range (many say the range is 5 to 30, but the National Snow and Ice Data Center has quoted a range as wide as 3 to 100), depending on the water content of the snow (how \"dry\" it is), so this only provides, at best, a rough estimate of snow depth.\n\nThe snow gauge suffers from the same problem as that of the rain gauge when conditions are windy. If the wind is strong enough, then the snow may be blown across the wind gauge and the amount of snow fallen will be under-reported. However, due to the shape and size of the funnel this is a minor problem.\n\nIf the wind is very strong and a blizzard occurs then extra snow may be blown into the gauge and the amount of snow fallen will be over-reported. In this case the observer must judge how much of the water is from snow blown into the container and how much is fallen snow.\n\nAnother problem occurs when both snow and rain fall before the observer has time to change the gauge. In all of these cases the observer must judge how much of the water is snow and how much is rain.\n\nRemote reading gauges, such as used by weather stations, work similarly to rain gauges. They have a large catch area (such as a drum sawn in half, top to bottom) which collects snow until a given weight is collected. When this critical weight is reached, it tips and empties the snow catch. This dumping trips a switch, sending a signal. The collection then repeats. If the catch container has a heater in it, it measures the snow weight accurately. It is also possible to tip based on volume instead of weight, with appropriate fill sensing.\n\nAnother snow sensor called a snow pillow looks like a round bag lying on the ground. Inside the pillow is a liquid such as an environmentally safe antifreeze. Usually the snow pillow will be connected to a manometer. The manometer reading will vary based on how much snow is sitting on the pillow. This type of sensor works well for many locations but is more difficult to use in areas of hard blowing snow.\n"}

He probably was the son and successor to Senakhtenre Ahmose and Queen Tetisheri. The dates of his reign are uncertain, but he may have risen to power in the decade ending in 1560 BC or in 1558 BC (based on the probable accession date of his son, Ahmose I, the first ruler of the eighteenth dynasty, see Egyptian chronology). With his queen, Ahhotep I, Seqenenre Tao fathered two pharaohs, Kamose, his immediate successor who was the last pharaoh of the seventeenth dynasty, and Ahmose I who, following a regency by his mother, was the first pharaoh of the eighteenth. Seqenenre Tao is credited with starting the opening moves in a war of revanchism against Hyksos incursions into Egypt, which saw the country completely liberated during the reign of his son Ahmose I.\n\nNew Kingdom literary tradition states that Seqenenre Tao came into contact with his Hyksos contemporary in the north, Apepi or Apophis. The tradition took the form of a tale, nowadays called \"The Quarrel of Apophis and Seqenenre\", in which the Hyksos king Apepi sent a messenger to Seqenenre in Thebes to demand that the Theban hippopotamus pool be done away with, for the noise of these beasts was such that he was unable to sleep in far-away Avaris. Perhaps the only historical information that can be gleaned from the tale is that Egypt was a divided land, the area of direct Hyksos control being in the north, but the whole of Egypt paying tribute to the Hyksos kings.\n\nSeqenenre Tao participated in active diplomatic posturing, which went beyond simply exchanging insults with the Asiatic ruler in the North. He seems to have led military skirmishes against the Hyksos and, judging from the vicious head wounds on his mummy in the Cairo Museum, may have died during one of them.\n\nHis son and successor Wadjkheperre Kamose, the last ruler of the seventeenth dynasty at Thebes, is credited with launching a successful campaign in the Theban war of liberation against the Hyksos, although he is thought to have died in the campaign. His mother, Ahhotep I, is thought to have ruled as regent after the death of Kamose and continued the warfare against the Hyksos until Ahmose I, the second son of Seqenenre Tao and Ahhotep I, was old enough to assume the throne and complete the expulsion of the Hyksos and the unification of Egypt.\n\nThe relatively short length of the reign of Seqenenre Tao did not allow for the construction of many monumental structures, but it is known that he had built a new palace made of mud brick at Deir el-Ballas. On an adjacent hillside overlooking the river, the foundations of a building were found that almost certainly was a military observation post.\n\nA relatively large amount of pottery known as Kerma-ware was found at the site, indicating that a large number of Kerma Nubians were resident at the site. It is thought that they were there as allies of the pharaoh in his wars against the Hyksos.\n\nSeqenenre's mummy was discovered in the Deir el-Bahri cache, revealed in 1881. He was interred along with those of later, eighteenth and nineteenth dynasty leaders, Ahmose I (his second son to be pharaoh), Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose II, Thutmose III, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX.\n\nThe mummy was unwrapped by Eugène Grébaut when \n\nA vivid description provides an account of the injury that was done to the pharaoh at his death:\nThe wound on his forehead was probably caused by a Hyksos axe and his neck wound was probably caused by a dagger while he was prone. There are no wounds on his arms or hands, which suggests he was not able to defend himself.\n\nUntil 2009 the main hypotheses have been that he died either in a battle against the Hyksos or was killed while sleeping. A reconstruction of his death by Egyptologist Garry Shaw and archaeologist and weapons expert Robert Mason suggested a third, which they saw as the likeliest, that Seqenenre was executed by the Hyksos king. Garry Shaw also analysed the arguments for the competing hypotheses and other physical, textual and statistical evidence concluding \"that the most likely cause of Seqenenre’s death is ceremonial execution at the hands of an enemy commander, following a Theban defeat on the battlefield.\"\n\nHis mummy appears to have been hastily embalmed. X-rays that were taken of the mummy in the late-1960s show that no attempt had been made to remove the brain or to add linen inside the cranium or eyes, both normal embalming practice for the time. In the opinion of James E. Harris and Kent Weeks who undertook the forensic examination at the time the x-rays were taken, his mummy is the worst preserved of all the royal mummies held at the Egyptian Museum, and they noted that a \"foul, oily smell filled the room the moment the case in which his body was exhibited was opened\", which is likely due to the poor embalming process and the absence of the use of absorbing natron salts, leaving some bodily fluids in the mummy at the time of burial.\n\nHe is the earliest royal mummy on display in the recently revamped (2006) Royal Mummies Hall at the Egyptian Museum, Cairo.\n\n"}

He was on the podium three times in the Tour de France general classification: second in 1990, third in 1991 and second again in 1992.\n\nAfter a quiet start to his career he burst onto the scene in the 1990 Tour de France. Chiappucci found himself almost casually wearing the yellow jersey after a stage one attack which the favourites allowed him to arrive with a 10-minute time advantage. In subsequent stages he resisted the return of Greg LeMond, only losing the lead of the race in stage 20, the final time trial. In the end, LeMond won the Tour by 2' 16\", Chiappucci came home with a surprising second place and, moreover, the status of a cycling star. He was the first Italian cyclist to arrive on the podium at the Tour since Felice Gimondi in 1972. This first successful campaign highlighted Chiappucci's main weakness, the time trial. Although vowing to return the following year as a better racer against the clock, Chiappucci never was able to master this discipline.\n\nThe year of 1991 confirmed to the cycling community that Chiappucci was able to perform consistently. Beginning with a win in the opening classic of the season, the Milan San-Remo, Chiappucci rode the Giro d'Italia and the Tour of France.\n\nHowever, Chiappucci declined quickly. After riding a solid Giro it looked like his 1993 Tour de France was to be a big showdown with Miguel Indurain. But from the first mountain stage Chiappucci was obviously struggling. Although he had a revival later on in the race, Chiappucci finished sixth overall. He won the Clásica de San Sebastián a few weeks after the Tour de France, but this marked the end of his major results. His level of performance declined sharply from around 1994/1995, and he retired in 1998 after suspicions of doping in 1997.\n\nHis most famous victory was stage 13 of the 1992 Tour de France, when he attacked on the first climb of the day, 245 km from the finish, and arrived in Sestriere after holding off a thrilling chase by Miguel Indurain and Gianni Bugno. On that occasion, Chiappucci was first and alone on top of all five main climbs, of which 3 were \"première catégorie\" and 1 \"hors catégorie\". He had wanted to replicate the same accomplishment as Fausto Coppi exactly 40 years earlier.\n\nAmong the awards received by Chiappucci is a silver medal earned in 1994 at the World Cycling Championship in Sicily.\n\nNot gifted with an exceptional physique, Chiappucci was distinguished by a gritty, combative style, always ready to attack; he did not hold back in the face of any climb or time trial.\n\nClaudio Chiappucci used the services of doctor Francesco Conconi, who is accused of applying EPO to cyclists. Conconi was found 'morally guilty', but not convicted, because the statute of limitations had expired. The judge had looked at medical reports of 33 cyclists in the period from 1993 to 1995, including Chiappucci's, and all blood tests showed largely fluctuating hematocrit-values, indicative for EPO-use.\nIn 1997, Claudio Chiappucci told prosecutor Vincenzo Scolastico that he had been using EPO since 1993, but later he retracted that statement.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2319209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319209", "title": "Hung Up", "text": "Hung Up\n\n\"Hung Up\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her tenth studio album \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\" (2005). Initially used in a number of television advertisements and serials, the song was released as the album's lead single on October 17, 2005. Written and produced by Madonna in collaboration with Stuart Price, \"Hung Up\" prominently features a sample from the instrumental introduction to ABBA's hit single \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\", for which Madonna personally sought permission from its songwriters, Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus.\n\nMusically the song is influenced by pop from the 1980s, with a chugging groove and chorus and a background element of a ticking clock that suggests the fear of wasting time. Lyrically the song is written as a traditional dance number about a strong, independent woman who has relationship troubles. \"Hung Up\" received critical praise from reviewers, who considered it among Madonna's best dance tracks and believed that the track would restore her popularity, which had diminished following the release of her 2003 album \"American Life\". \"Hung Up\" became a global commercial success, peaking atop the charts of 41 countries and earning a place in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\". It was Madonna's 36th top 10 single on the \"Billboard Hot\" 100, tying her with Elvis Presley as the artist with most top ten hits. It also became the most successful dance song of the decade in the United States. \"Hung Up\" remains one of the best-selling singles of all time, with sales of over nine million copies worldwide.\n\nThe music video is a tribute to John Travolta and his movies, and to dancing in general. Directed by Johan Renck, the clip starts with Madonna clad in a pink leotard dancing alone in a ballet studio and concludes at a gaming parlor where she dances with her backup troupe. Interspersed are scenes of people displaying their dancing skills in a variety of settings, including a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, a small restaurant and the London Underground. Madonna has performed the song in a number of live appearances, including as the final number of 2006's Confessions Tour, a heavy metal-inspired arrangement in the 2008 leg of the Sticky & Sweet Tour, and 2012's The MDNA Tour, where the singer performed the song while slacklining.\n\nIn 2004, after the release of her ninth studio album \"American Life\", Madonna began working on two different musicals: one tentatively called \"Hello Suckers\" and another one with Luc Besson, who previously directed the music video for her single \"Love Profusion\", which would portray her as a woman on her deathbed looking back on her life. Madonna collaborated with Patrick Leonard, Mirwais Ahmadzaï and Stuart Price to write new songs, and told Price to pen disco songs that sound like \"ABBA on drugs\". However, Madonna found herself dissatisfied with the script written by Besson and scrapped it. When she began composing \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\", she decided to rework \"Hung Up\" and include it in her record.\n\n\"Hung Up\" was one of the first songs written for the album, along with \"Sorry\" and \"Future Lovers\". It was inspired by aspects of the 1970s disco era, including the music of ABBA and Giorgio Moroder and the film \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977). Madonna imagined it to be a cross between the music played at Danceteria, the New York City night club she frequented in her early days, and the music of ABBA. Their 1979 hit \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\" formed the basis of the song. Songwriters Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus generally do not allow anyone to sample any of their tracks, an exception being Fugees, who sampled their song \"The Name of the Game\" for their single \"Rumble in the Jungle\". In order to gain the rights to sample \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!\", Madonna had to send her emissary to Stockholm with a letter which begged them to allow her to sample the song and also telling how much she loved their music. To the BBC she explained: \"[T]hey never let anyone sample their music. Thank God they didn't say no. [...] They had to think about it, Benny and Björn. They didn't say yes straight away.\" The pair agreed to let Madonna use the sample only after making a copyright agreement that entitled them to a significant share of the royalties from subsequent sales and airplay. Andersson, in an interview with \"The Daily Telegraph\" in October 2005, declared \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!\" to be the essence of \"Hung Up\" while joking that it was his favourite Madonna song thus far. He further said:\n\n\"We get so many requests from people wanting to use our tracks but we normally say 'no'. This is only the second time we have given permission. We said 'yes' this time because we admire Madonna so much and always have done. She has got guts and has been around for 21 years. That is not bad going.\"\nThe song premiered in September 2005, during a television advertisement for Motorola's ROKR mobile phone. The advertisement featured Madonna and other artists jammed in a phone booth. On October 17, 2005, the song made its premiere during a live ten-minute radio interview between Ryan Seacrest and Madonna. It was also made available as a master ringtone with various mobile service providers. \"Hung Up\" was sent to mainstream radio in the United States on October 18. The song was added to episodes of \"\" and \"\" on November 7 and 9, 2005, respectively. While promoting \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\", Madonna played both \"Hung Up\" and the next single \"Sorry\" at Luke & Leroy's nightclub in Greenwich Village, where she was invited by Junior Sanchez to perform briefly as the DJ, mixing the two songs. Regarding her decision to release the song for digital download, Madonna said: \"I'm a businesswoman. The music industry has changed. There's a lot of competition, and the market is glutted with new releases – and new 'thises and thats'. You must join forces with other brands and corporations. You're an idiot if you don't.\"\n\nMusically, \"Hung Up\" is a dance-pop and disco song. According to \"The New York Times\", the song has vaguely familiar hooks, sustained overlays of the string arrangement and acoustic guitar enfolding the music to create a haze like sound. \"Billboard\" described the music as frothy, nonsensical and joyous. The instant familiarity of the sampled music is changed by Stuart Price and Madonna by adding a chugging groove and a chorus which singles it out as an independent song. Alongside the ABBA sample, \"Rolling Stone\" said that the song also incorporates elements of Madonna's older songs like \"Like a Prayer\" and \"Holiday\" and features fleeting quotes from bands like S.O.S. and the Tom Tom Club.\n\nAccording to Musicnotes.com, \"Hung Up\" is set in common time, and has a moderate dance-beat tempo of 120 beats per minute. The key of the song is in D minor with Madonna's vocal range spanning from G to B. The song progresses in the following chord progressions of Dm–F–C–Dm in the verses and Dm–F–Am–Dm in the chorus, and changes to B–F–A–Dm for the bridge. \"Hung Up\" uses the sound of a ticking clock to symbolize fear of wasted time, which was incorporated by composer Stuart Price, from his remix of Gwen Stefani's 2004 single \"What You Waiting For?\". According to Slant Magazine, the song embodies some of Madonna's old hits, incorporating them into the song's pitched-upward vocals while presenting an archetypical key change/tonicization during the bridge.\n\nLyrically, the song is written from the perspective of a girl who once had nothing and the theme centers around love. About.com compared the lyrics of \"Hung Up\" and another song \"I Love New York\" from the \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\" album, to the style of the songs in Madonna's \"American Life\" album. According to About.com, the song is written as a very traditional dance number which is rooted in relationship issues. Also present in the lyrics is Madonna's enduring embrace of strong, independent women. The song's hook, \"Time goes by so slowly for those who wait,\" is taken from Madonna's 1989 collaboration with Prince, \"Love Song,\" as is the line, \"Those who run seem to have all the fun.\"\n\nKeith Caulfield from \"Billboard\", while reviewing \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\", called the song \"a fluffier cut\". Chris Tucker from \"Billboard\" explained that \"Madonna returns with a song that will restore faith among her minions, fans of pop music and radio programmers\". Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" said that Madonna kept her pop touch in \"Hung Up\" and called it a love song which is both happy as well as sad. Alan Light from \"Rolling Stone\" called the song candy coated. David Browne from \"Entertainment Weekly\" was impressed by the song and said \"'Hung Up' shows how effortlessly she [Madonna] can tap into her petulant inner teen\". Sal Cinquemani of \"Slant Magazine\" compared the song to the remix of Gwen Stefani's 2004 single \"What You Waiting For?\". Ed Gonzalez from the same magazine called the song the biggest hit of her career. Margaret Moser from \"The Austin Chronicle\" said that the song strobes and pulses along with another album track \"Forbidden Love\". Peter Robinson from \"The Observer\" commented that \"Hung Up\" is Madonna's \"most wonderfully commercial single since the mid Eighties\". Alexis Petridis from \"The Guardian\" called the track a \"joyous...single that could theoretically have been more camp, but only with the addition of Liza Minnelli on backing vocals and lyrics about Larry Grayson's friend Everard.\"\n\nBen Williams from \"New York\" magazine described the song as sounding both throbbing as well as wistful. Christian John Wikane from \"PopMatters\" called the song a propulsive track. Alan Braidwood of BBC Music noted of the track: \"full-on dance, dark, disco, fun, big\" and compared it to other Madonna songs like \"Vogue\", \"Deeper and Deeper\" and \"Ray of Light\". Tom Bishop from BBC Music commented that Madonna has either reinvigorated her career or she is \"merely throwing one final dance party for her long-term fans before settling down to record more sedate material\". Jason Shawhan from About.com commented that the song has \"way too much Abba in it for its own good.\" He went on to elaborate that \"[t]he only reason I can think of for this to be chosen as the first single was the Motorola ad campaign. It's not a bad song by far, it has pep and a sense of fun, but it's not even close to being one of the best songs on the record\". Bill Lamb of About.com said that the ABBA sample sounded completely effortless like much of Madonna's best dance music. He further elaborated that what \"'Hung Up' amounts to is a big gushy love note to Madonna's core fans, those club kids who pack the floor every time they hear the pounding beats of a Madonna classic and the dj's who can't get enough of spinning her records. 'Hung Up' will send those fans into ecstasy, and it sounds good on the radio, too\". Thomas Inskeep of \"Stylus Magazine\" declared that \"Hung Up\" and the next single \"Sorry\" might not have the same sleaze as Madonna's older songs like \"Physical Attraction\" or \"Burning Up\", but have the same \"modus operandi\" of being designed for \"sweaty up-all-night dancing\". Rob Harvilla from \"The Village Voice\" called the song a triumphant jazz exercise.\n\n\"Hung Up\" was ranked at number 76 on \"Rolling Stone\"s 100 Best Songs of the 2000s list, calling it \"One of her [Madonna's] most captivating hits ever — and thanks to those deceptively hard-hitting lyrics, one of her most personal.\" \"NME\" placed it at number 39 on their list of the best tracks of 2005. \"Slant Magazine\" listed the song at number 36 on their list of Best of the Aughts: Singles, saying: \"'Hung Up' employs a ticking clock to represent fear of wasted time, but Madonna isn't singing about aging or saving the world—she's talking about love. It had been years since Madge sounded this vapid. With its pitched-upward vocals, infectious arpeggio sample from ABBA's 'Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight),' and the bridge's unironic, archetypical key change, the track decidedly points to the past, and it proved that, 20 years into her career, Madonna was still the one and only Dancing Queen\". The song was also named the 26th best single of 2005 by \"Pitchfork\". \"Stylus Magazine\" included \"Hung Up\" on their ranking of the best singles from 2005 at number 11. In 2016, \"Hung Up\" was named in the online poll by \"Digital Spy\", as \"The Biggest Pop Song of the 21st Century\".\n\n\"Hung Up\" was a worldwide commercial success, peaking at number one in charts of 41 countries and earning a place in the \"2007 Guinness Book of World Records\", as the song topping the charts in most countries. It also remains one of the best-selling singles of all time, with sales of over 9 million copies worldwide. In the United States, \"Hung Up\" debuted at twenty on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on the issue dated November 5, 2005. It became her highest opening position since \"Ray of Light\" entered the chart at five in 1998. The same week the song entered the Hot Digital Songs chart at number six and became the highest debuting single of the week on the Pop 100 Airplay, where it debuted at number 38. On the issue dated December 3, 2005, the song reached a peak of number seven on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, jumping from number 14 from previous week. The song became the chart's greatest digital gainer for that week and claimed the top position on the Hot Digital Songs chart. It also tied Madonna with Elvis Presley for 36 top ten hits, which was subsequently broken by Madonna's 2008 song \"4 Minutes\", which peaked at number three on the Hot 100. \"Hung Up\" debuted at numbers 25 and 10 on the Hot Dance Club Play and Hot Dance Airplay charts respectively ultimately reaching the top of both. It became the most successful dance song of the 2000s in the United States, by topping the Dance/Club Play Songs Decade-end tally. The song also reached a peak of seven on the Pop 100 chart. In 2008, the single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling at least a million copies in paid digital downloads. As of December 2016, the song has sold 1.4 million digital units in the United States.\n\n\"Hung Up\" became the fastest rising single on radio in Canada, according to Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems. On the second week itself, the song reached the top of the Contemporary Hit Radio chart of Canada, while reaching the top five of the Adult Contemporary and Canadian Airplay charts. Paul Tuch from Nielsen clarified that \"Hung Up\" achieved this feat within 10 days only. Consequently, \"Hung Up\" also peaked atop the Canadian Singles Chart for 15 non-consecutive weeks, and was certified double platinum by Music Canada for sales of 160,000 copies. In Australia, the song debuted atop the ARIA Singles Chart on November 20, 2005, breaking her tie with Kylie Minogue as the female artist with most number-one singles in Australian chart history. It was present within the top 50 of the chart for 23 weeks. The song was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 70,000 copies. \"Hung Up\" debuted at number 67 in the French singles chart and jumped to the top next week, remaining there for five non-consecutive weeks. It received a gold certification from Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP) for sales of 150,000 copies. \"Hung Up\" reached a peak position of number two in New Zealand, being kept from the top spot by Kanye West's single, \"Gold Digger\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Hung Up\" debuted at number one on the issue dated November 13, 2005, thus giving Madonna her 11th number one single on this chart. It sold 105,619 copies becoming the first single to sell more than 100,000 copies in a week since Crazy Frog's \"Axel F\" did it 23 weeks earlier. The first week sales of \"Hung Up\" were a little lower than Madonna's last UK number one, \"Music\" (2000), which opened with 114,925 sales, but exceeded her last single \"Love Profusion\", which debuted at number 11 with 15,361 sales in December 2003. The next week the single had a decline in sales of 43% to 59,969 copies, but remained on the top as \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\" debuted atop the UK Albums Chart. It remained at the top position for three weeks and a total of 40 weeks on the Singles Chart. According to the Official Charts Company, by the end of 2005, \"Hung Up\" was Madonna's biggest selling single with 339,285 copies since \"Music\" sold 390,624 copies in 2000. It was certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and has sold 625,600 copies in the UK to date. In Ireland, the song debuted at number two on the chart dated November 10, 2005 becoming the highest debut of the week. The song also topped \"Billboard\"s European Hot 100 Singles chart where it soared from 73 to the top of the chart on the issue dated November 21, 2005. The song was able to peak the charts in almost all the European nations including Austria, Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.\n\nOriginally the video for \"Hung Up\" was to be directed by photographer David LaChapelle. He wanted the video to have a \"documentary\"-style look, much like that of his 2005 film, \"Rize\", in which five of the dancers from the \"Hung Up\" video appeared. LaChapelle and Madonna disagreed on the concept, prompting the project to be reassigned to Johan Renck, who worked with Madonna in her video for \"Nothing Really Matters\". According to an interview with MTV, Renck was directing Kate Moss for a H&M commercial when he received a phone call from Madonna who desperately wanted to work with him. The next day he went to Los Angeles to meet the stylist and the choreographer hired by Madonna, who mailed him with her ideas for the video. The director explained that he \"kind of liked that we didn't have time to over-think this and be too clever, I like being out on a limb and not know what we're doing and why. Just deal with it, the mayhem, you know?\"\n\nMadonna clarified that the video was a tribute to John Travolta and to dance in general. Her dance moves for the video, which were inspired by Travolta's movies like \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977), \"Grease\" (1978) and \"Perfect\" (1985) took three hours to shoot. Madonna had broken eight bones in a horseback-riding accident a few weeks before shooting the video and faced difficulty doing the steps devised by choreographer Jamie King. Renck said,\n\n\"She was such a trooper, [...] She just fell off a horse! [Madonna said] 'If you were a real dance choreographer, you could tell I can't lift my left arm higher than this' — and it was like, what, a 20-centimeter difference? [...] But when she said it 'hurts like f---,' she'd take a break and sit down for two minutes. [Madonna]'I have broken ribs, remember that!' I just can't imagine dancing like that. Talk about priorities.\"\nMadonna wanted to use a few performers from her tour, such as Daniel \"Cloud\" Campos, Miss Prissy (dancer) from LaChapelle's \"Rize\" crew and traceur Sebastien Foucan, a practitioner of Parkour, a philosophical French sport. Renck said that \"It's not about the music, but the bodily expression, [...] We wanted to show the whole spectrum, be it krumping, breakdancing, jazz or disco.\" Since they could not shoot all over the world, Madonna wanted the video to have an \"omnipresent feel\", with the middle section of the song generating a sense of congregation. Renck suggested that they include a boombox, used as a means of uniting everyone and everything since it was through listening to songs on a boombox that street dancing started. Though some scenes in the video feature cities like London, Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai and Tokyo, in reality the actual sets were constructed in Los Angeles and London only. A London suburb was made to look like a Parisian one, where the routine for Parkour takes place, whereas a restaurant in London's Chinatown was used for the Shanghai sequence and Compton stood in for the Bronx. The dancers' scenes were shot in early October 2005 within half a day, for a total of six days of shooting.\n\nMadonna was also associated with the editing process of the video. She was Renck's editing supervisor. Madonna wanted a raw documentary look for the video which allowed her to be portrayed more realistically. Regarding the making of \"Hung Up\", Renck said that it was a massive work to undertake, \"It's like you form this little family that's flourished and prospered for the month, and then you chop it down like a tree, [...] You come out with a sense of yearning and longing, like, 'Can we just do that again? Please?'\"\n\nThe video starts with Madonna coming to a ballet studio carrying a boombox. She switches it on as the clock ticking sound of the music starts. Wearing a pink leotard, Madonna starts gyrating to the music while doing warm up exercises. The scene interchanges with a group of people on the street who start dancing to the music while listening to a similar boombox. They also display aspects of the physical discipline Parkour, while climbing over buildings and jumping from staircases. As the song starts, Madonna dances to the music in the ballet studio. The second verse shows her continuing dancing while the people from the street take their boombox and board a taxi. Scenes are interspersed with people dancing in a Chinese restaurant and Parisian streets. In the meantime, Madonna finishes her workout in the ballet studio, drops her towel, changes her clothes and comes out on the street. The people on the taxi, leave it and take the Underground instead. After another round of dancing in the train, the intermediate music starts. Madonna is shown mingling with some dancers on a dance floor and riding on a boombox. As the song starts again, Madonna and the people from the street, who act as her background dancers, all dance on a \"Dance Dance Revolution\" machine in a gaming parlor. The video ends showing Madonna lying on the ballet studio floor. The video was nominated for five awards at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards including Best Female Video, Dance Video, Pop Video, Best Choreography and the Video of the Year award although it did not win any of them. In 2009, the video was included on Madonna's compilation, \"\".\n\nOn November 4, 2005, Madonna opened the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards at the Pavilhão Atlântico in Lisbon, Portugal with her first performance of \"Hung Up\". She emerged from a glitterball to perform the song while wearing a purple leotard and matching leather boots. During next days, Madonna performed \"Hung Up\" on TV shows such as \"Wetten, dass..?\" in Germany, \"Parkinson\" in England and \"Star Academy\" in France, as well as on the Children in Need 2005 telethon in London. She opened her concerts at Koko and G-A-Y nightclubs in London with \"Hung Up\", respectively on November 15 and 19. In December Madonna travelled to Tokyo, Japan, where \"Hung Up\" was performed on TV show \"SMAP×SMAP\" and her concert at Studio Coast. On February 8, 2006, Madonna opened the 2006 Grammy Awards at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. She sang the song by pairing up with the fictional animated band Gorillaz. The band appeared on the stage via a three dimensional technique which projected their holograms on the stage. They performed their song \"Feel Good Inc.\" while rappers De La Soul made a guest appearance. Madonna then appeared on the stage and started performing the song while interchanging places with the hologram figures of the band. She was later joined by her own group of dancers and the performance was finished on the main stage rather than the virtual screen. Another performance of \"Hung Up\" came on April 30, 2006, during the\nCoachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California.\n\nThe song was performed as the last song of her 2006 Confessions Tour. It was performed at the last \"disco fever\" segment of the tour. During the performance, her dancers displayed the Parkour routine all over the stadium as the familiar ABBA sample played. Madonna changed her aerobics costume for a purple leotard. As the music progressed, she and her dancers appeared on the center stage and she started singing. During the second verse, she left her sunglasses and jacket and proceeded towards the front of the stage. A boombox appeared in the center with Madonna playing with it. The song starts again as balloons fall on the crowd from the top. The finale had Madonna engaging the audience to sing-along with her to the song while making a contest as to which side of the stadium can sing the loudest. Madonna then uttering the line \"I'm tired of waiting for you\" while the backdrop showed the phrase \"Have You Confessed?\". \"The New York Times\" Ginia Belafonte compared this performance with that of Ethel Merman. Slant Magazine commented that the performance reminded Madonna's ability to encapsulate the audience as a part of her performance. On July 7, 2007, Madonna closed her set during the Live Earth concert at the Wembley Stadium in London with \"Hung Up\".\nThe song was also added to the six song set list of the Hard Candy Promo Tour in 2008. Madonna wore a shiny black outfit with black tails, Adidas track pants and high-heeled, lace-up boots. \"Hung Up\" was the fourth song of the set list. It was re-invented as a heavy-metal version. As the performance of \"4 Minutes\" ended, Madonna picked up an electric guitar and played the first few chords of The Rolling Stones single \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\". She then asked the crowd whether they thought they had come to a Rolling Stones concert. When the crowd responded negatively, she started \"Hung Up\", while dedicating it to all the people who had waited outside in the queue to watch the show. She declared that the noisy, metallic guitar breakdown of the song symbolised what waiting sounded like in the brain of all those who had waited. The song was performed in the futuristic rave with Japanese influences segment of the 2008 Sticky & Sweet Tour. Madonna wore a futuristic robotic outfit designed by Heatherette, with plates on her shoulder and a wig with long curled hair. The similar heavy-metal version of \"Hung Up\" was performed but it later gave way to the ABBA music. Before starting the performance, she played a capella versions of her older hit songs on audience demand, mostly \"Express Yourself\" and \"Like a Virgin\". However, after that, the electric guitar was played to make noises, which Madonna dedicated to Republican vice-presidential nominee for the 2008 election, Sarah Palin. She said, \"I'd like to express myself to Sarah Palin right now. [Playing a screeching note on her guitar] This is the sound of Sarah Palin thinking. [...] Sarah Palin can't come to my party. Sarah Palin can't come to my show. It's nothing personal.\" The performance ended with Madonna playing the guitar riff of \"A New Level\" by heavy-metal band Pantera. For the second European leg of the tour in 2009, \"Hung Up\" was removed from the setlist and was replaced by an up-beat version of \"Frozen\".\nFor The MDNA Tour of 2012, \"Hung Up\" was added to the setlist as part of the opening segment, known as \"Transgression\". After performing a fragment of \"Papa Don't Preach\", several dancers wearing tribal masks, surrounded Madonna, tied her up and proceeded to carry her to the center of the main stage just as the song's opening riffs, underpinned by the dramatic sound of church bells with vocoder vocals, started to play in the background. Dressed in a black skintight outfit with an ample cleavage, gloves of the same color and heeled boots, Madonna and her dancers performed the song while at the same time slacklining on some ropes held on the middle of the stage. As Madonna sang the song, her dancers slid under the ropes. This performance received generally mixed reviews, Jon Pareles from \"The New York Times\" believed that changing the composition of the song in lieu of the theme for the segment made it \"ominous and obsessive\", while making it \"a memory of distant innocence\". Jim Farber from the \"Daily News\" felt that the introduction of slacklining gave the whole tour \"some needed bounce\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine was negative on his review of the performance, as he felt it was out of place on the show's segment, and compared it negatively to the performance of the Sticky & Sweet Tour, concluding that the song \"should never be performed in any way other than its original form.\" The performance of the song at the November 19–20, 2012 shows in Miami, at the American Airlines Arena, were recorded and released in Madonna's fourth live album, \"MDNA World Tour\".\n\nOn April 13, 2015, Madonna made a surprise appearance at the Coachella Festival and performed a medley of her 1994 song \"Human Nature\" and \"Hung Up\" during Drake's act, sporting thigh-high boots and a tank top that read \"Big as Madonna\". She then went on to kiss Drake, whose shocked expression went viral on the Internet. The rapper then revealed that he actually enjoyed the kiss, posting a picture of the moment to his Instagram account which read: \"Don’t misinterpret my shock!! I got to make out with the queen Madonna and I feel 100 about that forever\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The style is so named as it is traditionally the first haircut given to new male recruits during initial entry into many of the world's armed forces, but most particularly in the United States.\n\nThe induction haircut has both practical and psychological purposes. Originally, one of the reasons for the induction haircut was to reduce the chances of disease among closely quartered recruits from different geographical areas (with varying immunities), such as head lice. Furthermore, short hair also prevents the enemy from grabbing a soldier with long hair and slashing his/her neck. The haircut also has the psychological purpose of stripping recruits of their individuality and promoting the \"team\" mentality desirable in a platoon of military recruits.\n\nFor U.S. male recruits, the induction haircut has become a sometimes-dreaded symbolic rite of passage for entry into the armed forces and is usually performed within minutes or hours of arrival at boot camp. It is one of several techniques used to mentally shock recruits into adapting to their decision to become a member of the armed forces. Although all branches of the U.S. armed forces employ the tradition of the induction haircut, the U.S. Marines have adopted the most severe version – a \"zero-length\" clipper blade to the scalp, although not shorter to avoid any minor injuries to recruits' head moles or other lesions.\n\nSome Army drill sergeants have referred to this cut as the \"Mighty Fine\". Other names for this haircut are the \"buzz cut\" or a \"number zero\", \"on the floor\" and \"the Army's #1 haircut\".\n\nAlthough the term \"induction cut\" is generally used to refer to male military haircuts, females also endure a form of an induction haircut, in that their hair may be trimmed to chin-length. The concept of an \"induction haircut\" has also been the focus of litigation, such as in the case of The Citadel where attorneys for the first female cadet, Shannon Faulkner, argued that the \"knob haircut\" (referring to the college's freshman class's traditional nickname) would \"implement rules which altogether denigrate Ms. Faulkner's identity as a woman.\"\n\nA buzz cut is any hairstyle where the hair is cut short to a consistent length all over using clippers. The induction cut is distinguishable by the clippers being used without any guard or attachment, resulting in the shortest possible cut. The scalp is not shaved with a razor, but only very short stubble is left. Some people may refer to this haircut as a number 0.\n\nAs with many other short hairstyles, including a shaved head, the induction cut is becoming increasingly popular as an everyday hairstyle. It is one of the hairstyles that balding men often choose.\n\nIn the French Foreign Legion this form of haircut, used by all recruits and many légionnaires, is termed \"boule à zéro\" (zero ball). In recent years, the U.S. military style of high and tight has also become popular in the Légion.\n"}

It was a leader in promoting France's post-war economic boom, especially the expansion of the advertising industry; it was successful because of its close ties with top officials of the French government, its clever use of symbols to promote itself, and its ability to attract clients from widely diverse growing industries.\n\nIt is one of the \"Big Four\" agency companies, alongside WPP, Interpublic and Omnicom. Publicis Groupe S.A. is headed by Arthur Sadoun, and its agencies provide digital and traditional advertising, media services and marketing services (SAMS) to national and multinational clients.\n\nThe company was founded by 20 year old Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet in 1926. \n\nIn 2011, Publicis was named the third-largest marketing group worldwide by revenue, surpassing Interpublic.

Senakhtenre reigned for a short period over the Theban region in Upper Egypt at a time where the Hyksos 15th dynasty ruled Lower Egypt. Senakhtenre died c.1560 or 1558 BC at the latest.\n\nHe may or may not have been the son of Nubkheperre Intef, the most prominent of the Intef kings. The Danish Egyptologist Kim Ryholt observes that \"since \"Senaktenre\" was remembered as one of the Lords of the West alongside Seqenenre and Kamose, he is generally believed to have been a member of the family of Ahmose and as such identified with the otherwise unidentified spouse\" of Queen Tetisheri, Ahmose's grandmother. He was succeeded by his son, Seqenenre Tao. King Senakhtenre would also be the husband of Tetisheri who is called the \"great king's wife\" and \"the mother of my mother\" in a stela at Abydos by pharaoh Ahmose I. Senakhtenre was, therefore, the grandfather of Ahmose I.\n\nUnlike his two successors, Tao and Kamose, Senakhtenre is a relatively obscure king and, until 2012, was not attested \"by [any] contemporary sources (by his prenomen) but exclusively by sources dating from the New Kingdom: the Karnak king list [of Tuthmose III] and [in] two Theban tombs.\" Donald Redford's book mentions these 2 Theban tombs. The archaeological evidence prior to 2012 suggests that his reign was brief and lasted several months or 1 year at the most. However, in 2012, two important contemporary monuments of this king were uncovered at Karnak: a doorway found carved with his royal name as well as a fragmentary limestone lintel. The doorway or gate is carved with other hieroglyphic inscriptions which state that Senaktenre had this monument, which is carved from limestone blocks, transported from Tura (modern Helwan, south of Cairo), which was under Hyksos rule during his reign.\n\nFrom a reference in the Abbott Papyrus (Column III, 1.10) it was for a long time believed that Senakhtenre's nomen was \"Tao\" (\"The Elder\"). Indeed, the papyrus mentions two kings with the name Tao. The second king Tao was identified with Senakhtenre because the first mention of a Tao refers to Seqenenre Tao for which the complete name is written. Consequently, the hypothesis that Senakhtenre's nomen was Tao was dominant in egyptology until 2012 and was shared for example by Darrell Baker, although it also remained controversial. For example, the Egyptologist Claude Vandersleyen rejected this view as early as 1983. Furthermore, in his 1997 study of the second intermediate period, the egyptologist Kim Ryholt proposed that Senakhtenre's nomen may have been \"Siamun\" rather than \"Tao\":\nThe situation completely changed in March 2012 when French egyptologist Sébastien Biston-Moulin of the CFEETK (Centre Franco-Égyptien d'Étude des Temples de Karnak) published hieroglyphic inscriptions discovered on a large 17th dynasty limestone doorjamb built for a granary of a temple of Amun at Karnak. The doorjamb bears Senakhtenre's full royal name and reveals his nomen to have been \"Ahmose\". This is the same name as that of his grandson, Nebpehtyre Ahmose I, who founded the 18th dynasty by defeating the Hyksos and ousting them from Egypt. Inscriptions on the door indicate that it was built following the orders of Senakhtenre himself. The door was subsequently re-used and discovered in the foundations of a later building adjoining the temple of Ptah at Karnak. Senakhtenre's royal titulary as revealed by the door is \"Hr mry-mAa.t nswt bjty snxt-n-ra sA ra jaH-ms\", which translates as \"The Horus Merymaat, the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Senakhtenre, the Son of Re Ahmes.\" The inscription on the reused door proceeds to state that Senakhtenre \"made a monument for his father Amun-Re (i.e., the door itself)...from the beautiful white stone of Anu.\" Anu is the modern Tura, located near Cairo, which could mean that Senakhtenre imported the limestone from the then Hyksos controlled area of Tura in Lower Egypt. However, Biston-Moulin cautions that \"beautiful white stone of Anu\" was sometimes used as a generic term for stones which were actually taken from local quarries. Meanwhile, a fragmentary lintel uncovered by the same team of French scholars bore this inscription which mentioned Senakhtenre's nomen:\nThese two separate inscriptions on the granary door and fragmentary lintel found in January–February 2012 at Karnak demonstrate that king Senakhtenre's nomen or birth name was 'Ahmose' ('Ahmes' in Ancient Egyptian) and not 'Tao' as previously thought. Biston-Moulin writes in the summary of his article:\n"}
{"id": "2319234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319234", "title": "Filene's", "text": "Filene's\n\nFilene's (originally Filene’s Sons and Co.) was an American department store chain; it was founded by William Filene in 1881. The success of the original full-line store in Boston, Massachusetts was supplemented by the foundation of its off-price sister store Filene's Basement in 1908. Filene's, in partnership with Abraham & Straus, Lazarus, and Shillito's, was an original member of the holding company Federated Department Stores upon its establishment in 1929.\n\nFilene's expanded into shopping malls throughout New England and New York in the later half of the twentieth century, and was rivaled by fellow Boston-based department store Jordan Marsh. Federated sold Filene's to The May Department Stores Company, and spun off Filene's Basement into a separate company, in 1988. With this reorganization, the Filene's nameplate replaced the Hartford-based G. Fox & Co. in 1992 and Steiger's in 1994; the store assumed control of the Pittsburgh-based department store chain Kaufmann's in 2002.\n\nMay itself was ultimately acquired by Federated in 2005; the Filene's brand was retired and most stores were converted into the Federated-owned, Cincinnati-based Macy's nameplate by September 2006. Federated itself was renamed Macy's, Inc. in 2007. The former Filene's flagship store at Downtown Crossing in Boston is listed in the National Register of Historic Places; its current tenants include advertising agencies Arnold Worldwide and Havas Media, and fast fashion retailer Primark.\n\nThis building was designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 2006.\n\nThe precursor of the main company was a store opened in 1881 by William Filene. William Filene was a German Jewish immigrant from Posen, Prussia, who immigrated to Boston in 1848. Although William Filene is credited with creating Filene’s, it was his sons, Edward Filene and Abraham Lincoln Filene, who expanded the business greatly. Edward and Lincoln were two of the best known businessmen in America and were responsible for converting their father’s clothing store into one of the largest department stores in the country. The two sons assumed management of the store in 1891 and inherited the store upon their father’s death in 1901; by that the company was known as William Filene's Sons & Company.\n\nIn 1908 Edward Filene opened \"the automatic bargain annex\" or Filene's Basement as a way to sell excess merchandise from the upstairs department store. He also developed an automatic mark-down schedule to reduce the price of merchandise, used thereafter for decades. Edward's influence gave Filene’s an early reputation as a customer oriented store with slogans like “money back if not satisfied.”\n\nA new main store, Filene's Department Store, was completed in 1912 in Boston on the corner of Washington and Summer streets, by Chicago architect Daniel Burnham as his last major project. By 1929 Filene’s expanded the main building, converting the block around Washington, Summer, Hawley and Franklin streets into one department store.\n\nAlso during 1929, Filene’s joined Abraham & Straus and Lazarus as the founding members of Federated Department Stores. From the 1930s through 1990s Filene’s continued expanding beyond New England with the country growing and adapting to new shopping malls. Filene’s main rival company during this period was Jordan Marsh, whose main store, like Filene's, was located in Downtown Crossing in Boston, and was also making the transition, expanding into shopping malls. In 1947, the Filene’s Basement trade-name was first applied to an annual bridal gown sale. Lines extending around the store made it famous.\n\nIn 1988, after the leveraged buyout of Federated Department Stores by Campeau Corp. of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the division was sold to May Department Stores Co. along with Foley's of Houston. It was then that the Filene's and Filene's Basement trade-names were disassociated. In 1992, Filene's absorbed G. Fox & Co. of Hartford, Connecticut, and Steiger's in 1994, two other divisions of May Company. During the 1990s there was a doubling of the Filene's organization as May invested in new stores and variegated Filene's price and product assortments. In 2002 Filene's assumed operational control of the Kaufmann's stores in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and western New York state.\n\nSpeculated since the early 2000s, Federated announced its planned acquisition of May in February 2005. The likelihood that the May nameplates would be replaced by the Federated-owned Macy's was acknowledged, citing the \"considerable success in re-branding [Federated's] regional stores as Macy's\" and that \"operating regional stores primarily under one brand means [they] can advertise nationally, unlike regional retailers, which is more cost-effective;\" the changes were unlikely to occur before 2006. Indeed, the company-wide conversion to Macy's was confirmed in July, and the merger was completed in August.\n\nFederated continued to divest \"duplicate\" properties in shopping malls where Filene's and Macy's were both present; prior to consolidation, Filene's operated 47 locations across Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. In regards to Downtown Crossing, however, the company remained uncertain whether the Filene's Department Store or the neighboring former Jordan Marsh flagship store (that became Macy's in the mid-1990s) would be retained. Then-Boston Mayor Thomas Menino expressed his preference for \"marrying Macy's to the Filene's building.\" Ultimately, the existing Macy's location was left intact and the Filene's store was closed in 2006.\n\nThe last remaining Filene's stores closed on September 9, 2006, with the conversion of the May-owned nameplates, Macy's had become a national retailer with over 800 stores. Upon receiving approval from shareholders that Federated itself be renamed Macy's, Inc. in 2007, then-CEO Terry Lundgren admitted that business was struggling from \"[having thrown] a lot of change on the May company stores very quickly.\"\n\nWhen Filene's closed, the Boston Landmarks Commission voted unanimously to protect the two oldest buildings that housed Filene's, the main 1912 store and a 1905 former glassware and china seller's building on the opposite corner. Two newer buildings, built in 1951 and 1973, were demolished in 2008.\n\nSurprisingly, though many Bostonians felt a sense of loss, the public did not protest the closing, unlike that of Marshall Field's in Chicago, and Kaufmann's in Pittsburgh. Boston had already lost many local companies to larger companies in the region, especially New York City, including \"The New York Times\"'s acquisition of the \"Boston Globe\" and the subsumption of the Bank of Boston and Fleet Bank into Bank of America. The Boston Landmarks Commission only protected the façade of each buildings, allowing developers to rip out the building's interior, including the original paneling installed in 1912. When the project ran out of money, the buildings were left completely gutted.\n\nIn mid-2014, advertising and public relations company Havas opened offices for several of its divisions (including advertising agency Arnold Worldwide and media planning division Havas Media) in the former Filene's Department Store. Earlier that year, Irish fast fashion retailer Primark announced that they would open their first location in the United States in the since-renamed Burnham Building. The four-level, flagship store opened in September 2015; a mural inspired by the Filene's origin of the building was installed on the second floor.\n\nBy the direction of company president Edward Filene, Filene's opened its famous \"Automatic Bargain Basement\" in 1909, which became a much-visited tourist attraction. The concept of the bargain basement was not new (Marshall Field's created the first in 1879), but Filene's basement was well lit and decorated ostentatiously. The basement had its own staff which bought surplus, factory clearances, overstock, or closeout merchandise - Filene boasted that he had once sold more than 7,000 pairs of woolen underwear during two July days. Goods were marked down according to an automatic schedule; an item that had been on sale for 12 days was marked down by 25 percent, after 18 days by 50 percent, after 24 days by 75 percent, and after 30 days it was given away. Ninety percent of goods sold in the basement were purchased within the first 12 days of sale. Filene's Basement was separately owned and operated by Retail Ventures, Inc. until 2009 when it was sold to Buxbaum Group, a liquidation company. The Filene's Basement stores were not affected by the Filene's/Macy's merger. However, in 2007, the original Filene's Basement location was closed while the old Filene's building was being gutted and rebuilt. At the time of the closing, the store was expected to relocate back into its basement space in 2010; however, the Filene's Basement company began its third Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2011, liquidating and permanently closing all of its stores in December 2011.\n\n\n\n"}

It has a stop on the MARC commuter rail (on the Camden line), and hosts a dinosaur park.\n\nMuirkirk was the historic location of Muirkirk Furnace, from which the area takes its name. The ironworks were established before the American Civil War. After the conflict began, the US government hired a manager from the North, Charles Coffin, to ensure the works were kept under federal control.\n\nLocated along Old Muirkirk Road, near Muirkirk station and just east of the former furnace, is the historic African-American community of Rossville, originally composed mostly of families of men who labored at the ironworks. It has existed for more than 100 years. In 1868 after the Civil War, six black men purchased property for a church and cemetery, forming the Queens Chapel Methodist Episcopal Church in the rural enclave colloquially referred to as \"Swamp Poodle.\" Part of the property was already in use as a burial ground. They intended to use the church building, originally a small log structure, as a school for their children. This was the start of a postwar cohesive black community in which freedmen established a church independent of white supervision. The Queen's Chapel church was rebuilt in the 1950s.\n\nAround 1885, the estate of landowner Mark Duvall, who owned considerable property in the Vansville area, provided for the sale of just east of Queen's Chapel. The twelve lots made available were quickly settled by African Americans, many of whom worked at nearby Muirkirk Furnace. Augustus Ross, after whom the community was named, built one of the first houses.\n\nThe largest lot was purchased by Rebecca Lodge #6, Benevolent Sons and Daughters of Abraham, a black fraternal organization whose members established the historic Abraham Hall. The lodge hall functioned for years as the community school for black children, as the state had segregated facilities. In 1922 the black community raised matching funds and gained white school board members' approval to build a Rosenwald School to improve the educational facilities for black children. Historically black schools were underfunded. This former school was more recently used as an American Legion post.\n\nCharles H. Stanley of Laurel sold of land to blacks in Rossville, as documented with the Maryland Historical Trust.\n\nThe following is a list of historic sites in Rossville, near Muirkirk, identified by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission:\n\nPrince George's County Public Schools operates public schools serving Muirkirk.\n\nDuring the era of legally-required racial segregation of schools, black students from Muirkirk attended Lakeland High School in College Park in the period 1928–1950; Fairmont Heights High School, then near Fairmount Heights, replaced Lakeland High and served black students only from 1950 to 1964; around 1964, legally-required racial segregation of schools ended.\n"}

{"id": "2319242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319242", "title": "Merankhre Mentuhotep", "text": "Merankhre Mentuhotep\n\nMerankhre Mentuhotep VI was a Theban king of the 16th dynasty based in Upper Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period. He was perhaps the 14th king of the dynasty.\n\nMerankhre Mentuhotep is only attested through two statuettes, JE 37418/CG 42021 and BM EA 65429. The first, discovered in the Karnak cachette by Georges Legrain, is missing its head and feet and gives the king's nomen and prenomen as well as a dedication to the god Sobek, lord of \"smnw\". The second statuette whose origin is unknown also bears the titulary of the king but with no dedication.\n\nAnother possible attestation of Merankhre Mentuhotep VI is given by a fragment of a wooden coffin, now in the British Museum under the catalog number BM EA 29997. The coffin bears the following text: \n\nThe prenomen of the king Mentuhotep is missing and the identification of this Mentuhotep remains problematic. Kim Ryholt notes however that the coffin is also inscribed with an early version of passages of the Book of the Dead, which is one of only two pre-New Kingdom inscriptions of this text. Thus, Ryholt argues that this Mentuhotep must have reigned during the late Second Intermediate Period. Thus three kings could possibly be the one mentioned on the coffin: Seankhenre Mentuhotepi, Sewadjare Mentuhotep V and Merankhre Mentuhotep VI. Although it sounds similar to Mentuhotep, Ryholt has shown that Mentuhotepi is a different name than Mentuhotep and would therefore not have been reported as Mentuhotep. To decide between the two remaining kings, Ryholt notes that the other instance of the Book of the Dead is found on the coffin of queen Mentuhotep, wife of Djehuti, the second pharaoh of the 16th Dynasty who reigned c. 1645 BC. In this case, the text is almost identical to that found on Herunefer's coffin, which argues for a close proximity in time between the two. While Sewadjare Mentuhotep reigned c. 10 years before Djehuti, Merankhre Mentuhotep is believed to have reigned 60 years after him. Hence, Ryholt concludes that Sewadjare Mentuhotep is the Mentuhotep of the coffin, Sitmut his queen and Herunefer his son.\nThis identification is far from certain however, and Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton have instead dated the coffin to the end of the 16th dynasty, thereby giving Herunefer as the son of Merankhre Mentuhotep VI and Sitmut as his wife.\n\nMerankhre Mentuhotep is not attested on the surviving fragments of the Turin canon, his reign and those of 4 other kings of the end of the 16th dynasty being lost in a lacuna. For this reason, the exact chronological position as well as the length of his reign cannot be ascertained. Ryholt proposes that Merankhre Mentuhotep was a king of the late 16th dynasty based on two arguments. First, his prenomen Merankhre has the form \"X-ankh-re\", similar to that of Djedankhre Montemsaf and both kings bear the nomen \"Montu-X\" which indicates that they succeeded one another closely in time. Second, the first statuette of Merankhre Mentuhotep is dedicated to Sobek of \"smnw\" (Sumenu) and was therefore probably set up at el-Mahamid Qibli near Gebelein where both Dedumose II and Djedankhre Montemsaf are attested before being moved to the Karnak cachette at a later point in time, perhaps at the collapse of the dynasty.\n\nIn an older study conducted in 1964 by Jürgen von Beckerath, Merankhre Mentuhotep was classified as a king of the 13th dynasty.\n"}

During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 23 categories. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gil Cates and directed by Jeff Margolis. Actress Whoopi Goldberg hosted the show for the first time. Nearly a month earlier in a ceremony held at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California on February 26, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Laura Dern.\n\n\"Schindler's List\" won seven awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Steven Spielberg. Other winners included \"Jurassic Park\" and \"The Piano\" with three awards each, \"Philadelphia\" with two awards, and \"The Age of Innocence\", \"Belle Époque\", \"Defending Our Lives\", \"The Fugitive\", \"\", \"Mrs. Doubtfire\", \"Schwarzfahrer\" and \"The Wrong Trousers\" with one. The telecast was watched by more than 46 million viewers in the United States.\n\nThe nominees for the 66th Academy Awards were announced on February 9, 1994, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Academy president Arthur Hiller, and actress Christine Lahti. \"Schindler's List\" led all nominees with twelve nominations; \"The Piano\" and \"The Remains of the Day\" tied for second with eight.\n\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 21, 1994. Best Director nominee Jane Campion was the second woman to be nominated in that category. Holly Hunter and Emma Thompson's nominations in both lead and supporting acting categories marked the first and so far only occurrence that two performers earned double acting nominations in the same year. Best Supporting Actress winner Anna Paquin, at age 11, became the second youngest winner of a competitive acting Oscar, behind Tatum O'Neal, who won at age 10 for \"Paper Moon\".\n\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double-dagger ().\n\n\n\nThe following 16 films had multiple nominations:\n\nThe following four films received multiple awards:\n\nThe following individuals, listed in order of appearance, presented awards or performed musical numbers:\n\nDue the negative reception received from the preceding year's ceremony, actor Billy Crystal announced that after overseeing four consecutive Oscar ceremonies, he would not be hosting the 1994 telecast. In a statement released by his publicist, he stated, \"After three Grammys, four Oscars and six \"Comic Reliefs\", I'm going to take a break from my hosting duties. I always felt honored to host the show and did my best to carry on the tradition of Bob Hope and Johnny Carson. I hope the new host has as good a time as I did.\" With Crystal absent to host the Oscars, many media outlets wondered whom producer Gil Cates would hire to emcee the program. Film columnist Jack Matthews suggested that actor Tom Hanks, who would eventually win Best Actor for \"Philadelphia\", should host the show writing that he \"has charm, dignity, wit, intelligence and, it's worth mentioning, he's a movie star!\" Cates also offered the role to performers Steve Martin, Bette Midler, and Johnny Carson, but they all turned down the opportunity.\n\nAfter several days of speculation, Cates announced that he hired Oscar-winning actress and comedian Whoopi Goldberg to host the festivities for the first time. By virtue of her selection, Goldberg became both the first African American to host as well as the first woman to host the telecast solo. In an interview with the \"Los Angeles Times\", Cates explained the decision to hire her saying, \"She is a highly recognizable star who has millions of fans.\" He also addressed the media's concerns regarding Goldberg's raunchy and outspoken humor stating, \"Some people may think she's potentially dangerous, and she says things that come to her mind. It's going to be exciting for me. The main thing is she wants to do it and she's smart. Whatever she says will be appropriate.\" Goldberg expressed that she was thrilled to be selected to emcee the 1994 ceremony commenting, \"To go from watching to winning to hosting in one lifetime is major.\"\n\nAs with previous ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show around a theme. This year, he christened the show with the theme \"People Behind the Camera\" commenting that \"It will be a salute to those unseen men and women who make what we see on the screen, the artist and craftspeople responsible for the magic of the movies.\" In tandem with the theme, the ceremony's opening number featured a montage produced by Chuck Workman saluting the many individuals such as directors, editors, and composers who are involved in moviemaking. During that segment, singer Bernadette Peters performing a modified version of Stephen Sondheim's song \"Putting It Together\" from his musical \"Sunday in the Park with George\". Filmmaker and editor Carol A. Streit assembled another montage featuring a salute to the work of cinematographers and their contributions to film.\n\nSeveral other people and elements were also involved with the production of the ceremony. Production designer Roy Christopher designed a new stage for the ceremony which prominently featured five giant Oscar statues each flanked inside metal cones that were illuminated recurrently throughout the show. Film composer and musician Bill Conti served as musical director of the ceremony. Dancer Debbie Allen choreographed a dancer number showcasing the Best Original Score nominees featuring eight prestigious ballet and dance troupes from around the world.\n\nAt the time of the nominations announcement on February 9, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $261 million, with an average of $52.2 million per film. \"The Fugitive\" was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $179 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by \"Schindler's List\" ($29.6 million), \"The Piano\" ($25.7 million), \"The Remains of the Day\" ($19.5 million), and finally \"In the Name of the Father\" ($6.5 million).\n\nOf the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 36 nominations went to 14 films on the list. Only \"The Fugitive\" (3rd), \"The Firm\" (4th), \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (6th), \"In the Line of Fire\" (7th), \"Dave\" (13th), \"Philadelphia\" (29th), \"What's Love Got to Do With It\" (38th), and \"The Age of Innocence\" (49th) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting, or Best Picture. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were \"Jurassic Park\" (1st), \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" (2nd), \"Cliffhanger\" (9th), \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" (24th), \"Addams Family Values\" (25th), and \"Beethoven's 2nd\" (27th).\n\nThe show received a positive reception from most media publications. \"The New York Times\" film critic Janet Maslin raved that the telecast had \"less silliness and less small talk, with more emphasis on cleverly chosen film clips and the bona fide Hollywood magic being celebrated.\" She also praised host Goldberg saying that she \"sustained a tone of levity, which became particularly important as the sweep by \"Schindler's List\" threatened to bring out great ponderousness in some quarters.\" \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" television critic Robert Bianco commended Goldberg's performance writing that \"She never acted like she was too smart or to hip for the show she was hosting; she never smirked like there was a joke she alone was cool enough to get.\" He also extolled producer Cates by commenting, \"In place of the extraneous jokes and terrible production numbers, he gave us a theme that worked and a generous selection of clips to back it up.\" Anne Thompson of \"Entertainment Weekly\" lauded Goldberg by stating, \"Her elegant appearance (at least during the first half), her uncharacteristic restraint (she didn't cuss), and her ability to make it funny (despite the very somber speeches) made the ho-hum telecast worth watching.\"\n\nSome media outlets were more critical of the show. Television critic Howard Rosenberg of the \"Los Angeles Times\" lamented that Goldberg's humor \"wilted in a blessedly brief 3-hour-and-18-minute telecast.\" He also wrote that compared with Billy Crystal, her hosting skills were \"balmy\". \"Orlando Sentinel\" film critic Jay Boyar bemoaned that \"this year's Oscarcast was only a little more exciting than a wine snob droning on about his favorite vintages.\" Harold Schindler of \"The Salt Lake City Tribune\" remarked that Whoopi's preference for \"insider\" jokes \"left the audience murmuring and most viewers probably scratching their heads.\" He also added the biggest letdown of the telecast was \"Goldberg's seeming ineptness at understanding the moment\"\n\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 46.26 million people over its length, which was a 1% increase from the previous year's ceremony. However, the show drew lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.86% of households watching over a 49.28 share. It also drew a lower 18–49 demographic rating with a 19.73 rating over a 40.53 share among viewers in that demographic.\n\nIn July 1994, the ceremony presentation received seven nominations at the 46th Primetime Emmys. Two months later, the ceremony won one of those nominations for Outstanding Technical Direction/Camera/Video for a Miniseries or Special (Averill Perry, Jim Ralston, Kenneth R.

He was educated at Malvern College and Balliol College, Oxford, which he entered in 1913 to read history. His studies were interrupted by service in a hospital in France from 1915 and then work in the Foreign Office. He did not complete his degree.\n\nIn the 1920s, he was in Paris, writing fiction. A Francophile, Mortimer broke down in tears when he heard on 21 June 1940 that France had signed an armistice with Germany, saying it was as if half of England had just fallen into the sea. He later became literary editor of the \"New Statesman\", worked at the BBC and in liaison with the Free French in World War II, and subsequently as a book reviewer for \"The Sunday Times\". He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1955 Birthday Honours.\n\nHe was a friend of the poet and novelist Vita Sackville-West, and was involved in a long-term relationship with her husband, author and British diplomat Harold Nicolson.

{"id": "2319263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319263", "title": "Thelodonti", "text": "Thelodonti\n\nThelodonti (from Greek: \"feeble teeth\") is a class of extinct jawless fishes with distinctive scales instead of large plates of armor.\n\nThere is much debate over whether the group of Palaeozoic fish known as the Thelodonti (formerly coelolepids) represent a monophyletic grouping, or disparate stem groups to the major lines of jawless and jawed fish.\nThelodonts are united in possession of \"thelodont scales\". This defining character is not necessarily a result of shared ancestry, as it may have been evolved independently by different groups. Thus the thelodonts are generally thought to represent a polyphyletic group, although there is no firm agreement on this point. On the basis that they are monophyletic, they are reconstructed as being ancestrally marine and invading freshwater on multiple occasions.\n\n\"Thelodonts\" were morphologically very similar, and probably closely related, to fish of the classes Heterostraci and Anaspida, differing mainly in their covering of distinctive, small, spiny scales. These scales were easily dispersed after death; their small size and resilience makes them the most common vertebrate fossil of their time.\n\nThe fish lived in both freshwater and marine environments, first appearing during the Ordovician, and perishing during the Frasnian–Famennian extinction event of the Late Devonian. Traditionally they were considered predominantly deposit-feeding bottom dwellers, but more recent studies have showed they occupied various ecological roles in various parts of the water column, much like modern bony fishes and sharks. In particular, a large variety of species preferred reef ecosystems, and it has been suggested that this preference was the reason for the development of their unique scales, protecting against abrasion and allowing for the development of more flexible bodies than other jawless fish, which had inflexible armors and were restricted to open habitats.\n\nVery few complete thelodont specimens are known; fewer still are preserved in three dimensions. This is due in part to the lack of an internal ossified (i.e. bony) skeleton; it does not help that the scales are poorly, if at all, attached to one another, and that they readily detach from their owners upon death.\n\nThe exoskeleton is composed of many tooth-like scales, usually around 0.5-1.5mm in size. These scales did not overlap, and were aligned to point backwards along the fish, in the most streamlined direction, but beyond that, often appear haphazard in their orientation. The scales themselves approximate the form of a teardrop mounted on a small, bulky base, with the base often containing a small rootlet with which the scale was attached to the fish. The \"teardrop\" often contains lines, ridges, furrows and spikes running down its length in an array of sometimes complex patterns. Scales found around the gill region were generally smaller than the larger, bulkier scales found on the dorsal/ventral sides of the fish; some genera display rows of longer spikes.\n\nThe scaly covering contrasts them with most other jawless fishes, which were armor-plated with large, flat scales.\n\nAside from scattered scales, some specimens do appear to display imprints, giving an indication of the structure of the whole animal – which appeared to reach 15–30 cm in length. Tentative studies appear to suggest that the fish possessed a more developed braincase than the lampreys, with an almost shark-like outline. Internal scales have also been recovered, some fused into plates resembling gnathostome tooth-whorls to such a degree that some researchers favour a close link between the families.\n\nDespite the rarity of complete fossils, these very rare intact specimens do allow us to gain an insight into the internal organ arrangement of the Thelodonts. Some specimens described in 1993 were the first to be found with a significant degree of three-dimensionality, ending speculations that the Thelodonts were flattened fish. Further, these fossils allowed the gut morphology to be interpreted, which generated much excitement: their guts were unlike those of any other agnathans, and a stomach was clearly visible: this was unexpected, as it was previously thought that stomachs evolved \"after\" jaws. Distinctive fork-shaped tails – usually characteristic of the jawed fish (gnathostomes) – were also found, linking the two groups to an unexpected degree.\n\nThe fins of the thelodonts are useful in reconstructing their mode of life. Their paired pectoral fins were combined with a single, usually well-developed, dorsal and anal fins; these and the hypercercal and much larger hypocercal lobes forming a heterocercal tail resemble features of modern fish that are associated with their deftness at predation and evasion.\n\nDue to the small number of intact fossils, the taxonomy of thelodonts is based primarily on scale morphology. In fact, some thelodont families are only recognised based on their scale fossils.\n\nA recent assessment of thelodont taxonomy by Wilson and Märss in 2009 merges the orders Loganelliiformes, Katoporiida and Shieliiformes into Thelodontiformes, places families Lanarkiidae and Nikoliviidae into Furcacaudiformes on the basis of scale morphology, and establishes Archipelepidiformes as the basal-most order.\n\nA newer taxonomy based on the work of Nelson, Grande and Wilson 2016 and van der Laan 2016.\n\nThe bony scales of the thelodont group, as the most abundant form of fossil, are also the best understood – and thus most useful. The scales were formed and shed throughout the organisms' lifetimes, and quickly separated after their death.\n\nBone – being one of the most resistant materials to the process of fossilisation – often preserves internal detail, which allows the histology and growth of the scales to be studied in detail. The scales consist of a non-growing \"crown\" composed of dentine, with a sometimes-ornamented enameloid upper surface and an aspidine (acellular bony tissue) base. Its growing base is made of cell-free bone, which sometimes developed anchorage structures to fix it in the side of the fish. Beyond that, there appear to be five types of bone-growth, which may represent five natural groupings within the thelodonts – or a spectrum ranging between the end members, meta- (or ortho-) dentine and mesodentine tissues. Each of the five scale morphs appears to resemble the scales of more derived groupings of fish, suggesting that thelodont groups may have been stem groups to succeeding clades of fish.\n\nScale morphology, alone, has limited value for distinguishing thelodont species. Within each organism, scale shape varies greatly according to body area, with intermediate scale forms appearing between different areas; furthermore, scale morphology may not even be constant within a given body area. To confuse things further, scale morphologies are not unique to specific taxa, and may be indistinguishable on the same area of two different species.\n\nThe morphology and histology of the thelodonts provides the main tool for quantifying their diversity and distinguishing between species – although ultimately using such convergent traits is prone to errors. Nonetheless, a framework of three groups has been proposed, based upon scale morphology and histology.\n\nThelodonts displayed similar squamation patterns as modern sharks, so functionally they served a similar role. This allows for a clearer observation of their ecological niches. In particular, protection against abrasion seems to have been the original role for these scales.\n\nMost thelodonts were considered deposit feeders, but more recent studies have shown that several species were active swimmers and thus more pelagic. A large variety of species in particular preferred reef ecosystems. They are mainly known from open shelf environments, but are also found nearer the shore and in some freshwater settings.\nThe appearance of the same species in fresh- and salt-water settings has led to suggestions that some thelodonts migrated into fresh water, perhaps to spawn. However, the transition from fresh- to salt- water should be observable, as the scales' composition would change to reflect the different environment. This compositional change has not yet been found.\n\nThelodont scales are globally widespread during the Silurian and Early Devonian times, becoming restricted in range to Gondwana, until their extinction in the Late Devonian (Frasnian). The morphology of some species diversified rapidly enough for the scales to rival the conodonts in utility as biostratigraphic markers, allowing precise correlation of widely spaced sediments.\n\nThe first major pattern or group of jawless fish with exoskeletons or plated armour, was the Laurentian group, which existed during the Cambrian-Ordovician time. However, the thelodonts (as well as the conodonts, placoderms, acanthodians, and chondrichthyans) are the second major group which are believed to have emerged in the middle Ordovician and lasted near the Late Devonian period. Due to their similar characteristics and chronological time frame of existence, many believe the thelodonts have Laurentian origins.\n\n\n\n"}

She has been a Member of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament) since 1999. She previously served as the Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats from December 2008 to May 2016 and subsequently from June 2017 to November 2017 in an acting capacity.\n\nWilliams was born in Taunton, Somerset to Welsh parents, whilst her librarian father was working there. After moving to Liverpool, in 1974 the family moved to the village of Bynea, Carmarthenshire, where she grew up.\n\nEducated at the independent St Michael's School, Llanelli, she then graduated from the Victoria University of Manchester with an honours degree in American studies, including a period studying at the University of Missouri. She then returned to work for the learning resources department of Carmarthenshire College in Llanelli, before taking up a post as a marketing and public relations executive for a small business in Cardiff.\n\nShe is married to a farmer; the couple have three daughters and live on the family farm outside Brecon.\n\nWilliams joined the Welsh Liberal Democrats at the age of 15. In the 1997 general election, she contested the constituency of Ogmore, coming third. For a long time she was a keen advocate of a Welsh Assembly, and she campaigned hard in the 1997 referendum for the creation of the National Assembly for Wales. She was subsequently appointed to the National Assembly Advisory Group by Welsh Secretary Ron Davies.\n\nShe was elected as an Assembly Member of the National Assembly of Wales for the constituency of Brecon and Radnorshire in May 1999. In her first term she became her party's health spokesman. She also served as Chair of the Welsh Assembly Health and Social Care Committee between 1999 and 2003.\n\nIn the 2006 Welsh Yearbook Political Awards, she was voted \"Member to Watch 2006\" In a poll at the end of 2006, Williams was voted \"Sexiest Female Liberal Democrat\" on Stephen Tall's \"Liberal Goes a Long Way\" blog.\n\nOn 8 December 2008, Williams became leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, having defeated Cardiff Central Assembly Member Jenny Randerson.\n\nIn 2011, as leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, she agreed to support the Welsh Labour Government's 2012–2013 £14.5bn Budget on the basis, amongst other things, of securing the Welsh Pupil Premium: an extra £20m to spend on the education of the poorest pupils. Teaching Unions welcomed the deal, with ATL Cymru director Philip Dixon saying, \"Our children are our future and investment in them is investment for all. Labour and the Lib Dems deserve credit for ensuring that our children, especially those in most need, will now get a better start in life.\"\n\nIn 2013, Williams and the Welsh Liberal Democrats more than doubled investment for the Welsh Pupil Premium in exchange for abstaining on the Welsh government's annual budget.\n\nWilliams has gained a reputation for campaigning on health issues. In 2012, the Welsh Government agreed to take forward the Welsh Liberal Democrat idea of a Health Technology Fund to allow patients better access to innovative treatments. The following year, the Welsh Liberal Democrats achieved a further £9.5m investment into the Health Technology Fund as well as the establishment of a £50m Intermediate Care Fund to drive integration of health, social services and housing.\n\nWilliams has been part of a long-running ‘More Nurses’ campaign for a law requiring minimum staffing levels for nurses in Welsh hospitals. In 2014, Assembly Members voted to allow Williams's proposed legislation on this issue to be taken to the next legislative stage.\n\nIn December 2012, Williams won ITV Wales' Assembly Member of the Year Award in a ceremony at Cardiff's City Hall. In the Queen's Birthday Honours 2013, Williams was appointed Commander of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire \"for public and political service\".\n\nIn the elections to the Welsh Assembly on 5 May 2016 Williams retained her Brecon and Radnorshire seat with an increased majority. However, as the sole Liberal Democrat representative in the new Assembly, she stood down as leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats the day after the election. First Minister Carwyn Jones appointed her to the Welsh Cabinet as Education Secretary; 31 seats are needed for a majority in the Welsh Assembly, Labour had 29, so Williams joining with the Labour administration created a working majority.\n\nOn 16 June 2017, Williams once again became leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, having been chosen to do so by the outgoing Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, after the defeat of the previous leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Mark Williams MP, in the 2017 general election.\n\n"}

During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 23 categories. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gil Cates and directed by Jeff Margolis. Actor Billy Crystal hosted the show for the fourth consecutive year. In related events, during a ceremony held at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles on March 6, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Sharon Stone.\n\n\"Unforgiven\" won four Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director for Clint Eastwood, and Best Supporting Actor for Gene Hackman. Al Pacino and Emma Thompson won lead acting honors for \"Scent of a Woman\" and \"Howards End\", respectively. Marisa Tomei won Best Supporting Actress for \"My Cousin Vinny\". The telecast garnered 45.7 million viewers in the United States.\n\nThe nominees for the 65th Academy Awards were announced on February 17, 1993, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Robert Rehme, president of the Academy, and actress Mercedes Ruehl. \"Howards End\" and \"Unforgiven\" led all nominees with nine nominations each.\n\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 29, 1993. Best Director winner Clint Eastwood became the seventh person nominated for lead acting and directing for the same film. Best Actor winner Al Pacino was the sixth performer to receive nominations in the lead and supporting categories in the same year. He also became the first person to win in the lead acting category after achieving the aforementioned feat. By virtue of his second straight win in both music categories, Alan Menken became the third person to win two Oscars in two consecutive years.\n\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger ().\n\n\nThe award recognizes individuals whose humanitarian efforts have brought credit to the motion picture industry.\n\n\nThe following individuals (in order of appearance) presented awards or performed musical numbers:\n\nAfter the success of the previous year's ceremony which won several Emmys and critical acclaim, the Academy rehired producer Gil Cates for the fourth consecutive year. In February 1993, actor and comedian Billy Crystal was chosen by Cates as host also for the fourth straight time. Cates justified the decision to hire him saying, \"He is a major movie star with a talent for moving the evening's entertainment along.\" According to an article by Army Archerd published in \"Variety\", Crystal initially declined to host again citing his busy film schedule that included \"Mr. Saturday Night\" and \"\". However, after Cates sent him a funeral wreath with a poem declaring \"The show and I are dead without you\" followed by a head of a fake dead horse similar to one featured in the film \"The Godfather\", Crystal accepted the role as emcee.\n\nAs with previous ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show around a theme. Inspired by the Year of the Woman in which a record four women were elected to the United States Senate, Cates christened the 1993 show with the theme \"Oscar Celebrates Women and the Movies\". In tandem with the theme, AMPAS gathered 67 female Oscar winners of every category for a photo that was later shown at the start of the telecast. Actress and singer Liza Minnelli performed \"Ladies' Day\", a song written by Fred Ebb and John Kander specifically for the broadcast. Oscar-winning documentarian Lynne Littman assembled a montage highlighting women in film.\n\nThere was a minor controversy when Snow White (Disney character) was presenting an award for Best Animated Short Subject. She was voiced by Mary Kay Bergman, Adriana Caselotti, the original voice of Snow White was not aware of this. She was reportedly offended that Disney didn't ask her to voice Snow White during the ceremony.\n\nSeveral other people participated in the production of the ceremony. Bill Conti served as conductor and musical supervisor for the ceremony. Choreographer Debbie Allen supervised the Best Song nominee performances and the \"Ladies' Night\" musical number. Voice actress Randy Thomas served as announcer of the telecast becoming the first woman to do so.\n\nAt the time of the nominations announcement on February 17, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $252 million, with an average of $50.4 million per film. \"A Few Good Men\" was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $120 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by \"Unforgiven\" ($75.2 million), \"Scent of a Woman\" ($34.1 million), \"The Crying Game\" ($14 million), and finally \"Howards End\" ($8.7 million).\n\nOf the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 38 nominations went to 13 films on the list. Only \"A Few Good Men\" (6th), \"Unforgiven\" (17th), \"Malcolm X\" (30th) and \"Scent of a Woman\" (38th) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting, or Best Picture. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were \"Aladdin\" (1st), \"Batman Returns\" (3rd), \"Basic Instinct\" (8th), \"The Bodyguard\" (9th), \"Under Siege\" (12th), \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" (14th), \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (16th), \"Death Becomes Her\" (22nd), and \"Alien³\" (26th).\n\nThe show received a negative reception from most media publications. Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore lamented that Crystal \"seemed incredibly listless\". He also questioned the purpose of the \"Year of the Woman\" theme writing, \"The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme.\" Robert Bianco from the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" derided Allen's musical production numbers, comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989. Columnist Matt Roush of \"USA Today\" complained, \"Crystal, in a by-now-familiar performance, has, in four years, taken a plum assignment and, by repetition, reduced it to shtick.\" He also wrote that, \"The song medley is getting old hat,\" and the \"smug references to his flop \"Mr. Saturday Night\" were out of an improv amateur night.\"\n\nThe telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures. In an interview with \"Los Angeles Daily News\" author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the \"Year of the Woman\" theme commenting, \"It had no basis in reality. On behalf of women directors, cinematographer, and producers, I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute.\" Likewise, President of the National Organization for Women's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony's feminist tribute as \"one of the most hypocritical, patronizing things I saw in my whole life.\" In response, Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating, \"The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive, not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically.\" He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying, \"It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness\"\n\nDespite the adverse reception, the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length, which was a 3% increase from the previous year's ceremony. The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2% of households watching over a 51 share. It also drew a higher 18–49 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They began working with Prince in the early 1980s and were part of his band The Revolution, before branching out on their own and releasing their debut album in 1987. In recent years they have turned their attention to writing music for film and television and have won an Emmy Award.\n\nThey have released five full-length albums, the most recent being \"White Flags of Winter Chimneys\", released in December 2008.\n\nIn 1980, Lisa Coleman replaced Gayle Chapman in Prince's touring band on keyboards and piano. Coleman was asked to contribute vocals to several tracks over his next few albums. In 1983, guitarist Dez Dickerson left the band over religious conflicts. Prince invited Wendy Melvoin (Lisa's girlfriend at the time) into the band as they began to record \"Purple Rain\". The film and album turned Prince and the newly named Revolution into superstars. Prince's personal life also became intertwined with Melvoin's when he began dating her twin sister Susannah.\n\nAfter \"Purple Rain\", Prince and The Revolution recorded \"Around the World in a Day\" and then \"Parade\", the soundtrack to Prince's film \"Under the Cherry Moon\". In interviews, the two reported they felt they were not getting the recognition and credit they deserved despite their growing contributions to his work. During 1986, Melvoin and Coleman became increasingly disillusioned with Prince's decision to expand The Revolution with non-musicians, such as Wally Safford and Greg Brooks, and Prince's increasing \"machismo\" that these new members brought with them. Unhappy and vocal about their feelings, they were eventually convinced to remain with the band through the end of the Hit N Run - Parade Tour. However, Prince felt spurned and as a result he had already decided he would dissolve The Revolution once the tour was complete. Hence, by October 1986, Melvoin and Coleman (along with Bobby Z.) were dismissed by Prince, disrupting the \"Dream Factory\" album that was already completed and effectively dissolving The Revolution.\n\nThe next year, the duo released an album simply entitled \"Wendy and Lisa\" with Columbia Records. They released a follow up album, \"Fruit at the Bottom,\" in 1989. The albums and singles from them garnered minor chart success (including a Top 30 single in the UK).\n\nIn 1990, the duo signed with Virgin Records in the US (which was already their label in Europe) and released \"Eroica\". However, this too met only minor chart success. In 1991, Virgin UK released the remix album \"Re-mix-In-a-Carnation\", a selection of club mixes from the first three albums as remixed by producers like The Orb, William Orbit, and Nellee Hooper.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Wendy & Lisa worked on several movie projects with record producer Trevor Horn. They also worked on an album with him as producer, but had a falling out (according to them, due to Horn and his wife's homophobia) and the project was shelved, leaving the master tapes in Horn's hands and acrimony between the parties involved. They have also done session work and/or written songs with Seal, k.d. lang, Joni Mitchell, Meshell Ndegeocello, Pearl Jam, Terence Trent D'arby, Lisa Germano, Lisa Marie Presley, Liz Phair, Michael Penn, Grace Jones, Tricky, The Three O'Clock, Uh Huh Her, Sheryl Crow, Victoria Williams, Rob Thomas, Gwen Stefani, Skye Edwards, Scritti Politti, Nerina Pallot, OK Go, Madonna, The Like, Nina Gordon, fDeluxe, The Family, Doyle Bramhall II, Nikka Costa, André Cymone, Kate Earl, Eric Clapton, Bettye LaVette and more and vocals on the soundtrack for \"Toys\" and their first scoring work, for \"Dangerous Minds\". They have since raised their profile considerably in that arena, scoring the popular TV shows \"Crossing Jordan\", \"Heroes\" and more recently \"Touch\", all of them created and produced by Tim Kring, and \"Nurse Jackie\" for Showtime.\n\nNot being signed to any label, their next solo effort – the 1998 album \"Girl Bros.\" – was the first to be independently released, with all subsequent releases also self-released. \n\nIn 2004, the duo reached a rapprochement with Prince and contributed to several tracks on his \"Planet Earth\" album.\n\nIn December 2008, \"White Flags of Winter Chimneys\" was released. The title is taken from a line in the Joni Mitchell song \"Hejira\". 2011 saw the release of the \"Snapshots\" EP, which came with limited edition artwork, autographs and a photo book. It is a 6-track collection of songs that were recorded over the preceding 20 years of their careers but had previously never been released.\n\nWendy and Lisa technically share the honor of winners of a Grammy and Oscar for being part of The Revolution, as \"Purple Rain\" won two Grammys, and the Oscar for Best Original Score. In 2010, they received the Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music for their work on \"Nurse Jackie.\" They received the ASCAP award for Composers of the Year for their work on \"Dangerous Minds\", the theme to HBO's \"Carnivàle\", \"Crossing Jordan\" and \"Heroes\". They were nominated for an Emmy in 2012 for the main title theme for the Fox show \"Touch\".\n\nMelvoin and Coleman have made numerous contributions to television themes. They wrote theme music and background scores for TV shows such as \"Shades of Blue\", \"Crossing Jordan\", \"Bionic Woman\", \"Carnivàle\", \"Heroes\", \"Mercy\" and Showtime's \"Nurse Jackie\". \n\nIn 2001, they worked with Neil Finn on his second solo album, \"One Nil\".\n\nThey have also been featured on several film scores and soundtracks, including \"Wine Country\", \"Something New\", \"Hav Plenty\", and \"Dangerous Minds\". The film \"Toys\" featured their song \"The Closing of the Year\", and they also produced the full-length \"\", released in April 2009, composed entirely of their full-length compositions for each of the show's characters. They scored the TV series \"Touch\" created by \"Crossing Jordan\" and \"Heroes\" creator, Tim Kring.\n\nMelvoin and Coleman collaborated with Grace Jones for her 2008 album \"Hurricane\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following songs, which appear on releases by Prince or associates, are registered with ASCAP as partial Wendy & Lisa compositions.\n\n\n"}

He was founding Chair of Primestock Producers Cymru, a national farmers cooperative, and also helped to found Montgomeryshire Rural Enterprises in 1997. In 1999 Bates was elected as Welsh Assembly Member for Montgomeryshire. He announced in the summer of 2009 his intention to retire at the 2011 election.\n\nOn 10 December 2010, Bates was convicted of three counts of common assault and public disorder, while drunk, having punched a paramedic on 20 January 2010, and was ordered to pay fines, compensation, and costs totalling £5,490. The Welsh Liberal Democrats began proceedings to terminate his membership of the party. Bates resigned from the party before the Welsh Liberal Democrats could convene a committee of enquiry and served the remaining months of his term of office in the Assembly as an independent. He did not stand for re-election. \n\nThey are sustainability and the environment, agriculture, community regeneration and the voluntary sector, infrastructure and ensuring prosperity for rural communities.\n\nWhile in the Assembly, Bates campaigned for extra money for rural schools and to put major road schemes into the Welsh Government Transport Plan, including the Newtown bypass, Buttington improvements, the Four Crosses bypass, and the Glandyfi bends.\n\nHe also promoted and secured free school milk for key stage one students in Wales, helped to establish the Small Schools Fund, and wrote a Biomass Strategy based on a local project in Llanwyddyn to provide heat and hot water for the school and surrounding houses.\n\nOn agriculture, Bates designed the unique concept of Farming Connect, a free business advisory service to help farmers throughout Wales. He campaigned successfully for the creation of an independent appeals panel to resolve subsidy disputes.\n\nThe environment was an important issue for Bates, and he was a founder member of the cross party National Assembly Sustainable Energy Group (NASEG) which sought to promote the development of a sustainable energy industry in Wales.\n\n\n\n"}

They were classically regarded as the ancestors of lampreys. Anaspids were small marine agnathans that lacked a heavy bony shield and paired fins, but have a striking highly hypocercal tail. They first appeared in the early Silurian, and flourished until the early Devonian, when they disappear from the fossil record.\n\nCompared to other prehistoric agnathan groups, such as the Heterostraci and Osteostraci, anaspids did not possess a bony shield or armor, hence their name. The anaspid head and body are instead covered in an array of small, weakly mineralized scales, with a row of massive scutes running down the back, and, at least confirmed among the birkeniids, the body was covered in rows of tile-like scales made of aspidine, an acellular bony tissue. Anaspids all had prominent, laterally placed eyes with no sclerotic ring, with the gills opened as a row of holes along either side of the animal, typically numbering anywhere from 6-15 pairs. The major synapomorphy for the anaspids is the large, tri-radiate spine behind the series of the gill openings.\n\nNow that \"Jamoytius\" and its close cohorts, i.e., \"Euphanerops\", have been moved to Jamoytiiformes, Class Anaspida now consists of two orders, the monogeneric Lasaniida, which contains the genus \"Lasanius\" and represents a basal anaspid group, and Birkeniida, which contains all other recognized anaspid taxa. Birkeniida is further divided into several families, including Birkeniidae, Pterygolepididae, Rhyncholepididae and Pharyngolepididae, which contain those taxa known from whole body fossils (in addition to several taxa known only from scales) and the family Septentrioniidae, whose subtaxa are known exclusively from scales. Two recently described genera, \"Kerreralepis\" and \"Cowielepis\", are considered to be Birkeniida \"incertae sedis\".\n\nA newer taxonomy based on the work of Mikko's Phylogeny Archive, Nelson, Grande and Wilson 2016 and van der Laan 2018.\n\n\n"}

Corbett, a coal miner, and his wife Florence, née Ramsden.\n\nDeafness in one ear precluded Corbett from pursuing his musical ambitions to become a concert pianist, although he played the piano in the Guiseley fish and chip restaurant owned by his mother's brother Harry Ramsden. His parents had a fish and chip business in Guiseley called Springfield, which remains open and is now known as Midgley's. He worked as an engineer with Leeds City Council prior to his time in show business. \n\nIn order to entertain his children while on holiday in Blackpool in 1948, he bought the original yellow bear glove puppet, then called Teddy, in a novelty shop on the end of the resort's North Pier for seven shillings and six pence (7s/6d) (which would become 37½p after decimalisation, not allowing for inflation). ‘Even now I can’t tell you exactly what it was about him,' he later recalled, 'but I just couldn’t leave him.’\n\nHis first appearance with the silent Sooty was in a 1952 BBC TV show, \"Talent Night\". He was given a part in Peter Butterworth's TV show \"Saturday Special\". Sooty was such a hit that the BBC offered Corbett six programs at 12 guineas each. In a 1970 interview, Corbett recalled the conversation he had with his wife Marjorie about his next steps:\n\n‘\"Well, lass... what’s it to be?”\n\n'“Well, lad,” she replied, “it’s now or never. Best take the plunge.” \n\n'So I did. I threw up my job. We changed Teddy’s appearance, gave him black ears, and called him Sooty.' \n\nSooty soon had his own show and he and Corbett were immensely successful in Britain. The show combined music, simple magic tricks with slapstick comedy in which Sooty usually poured liquid over or attacked Corbett. Sooty and Corbett were also regularly featured on the Mickey Mouse Club in the USA in the mid-to-late 1950s.\n\nIn early 1968, producers at the BBC told Corbett that, while he should remain as puppeteer, an actor should interact with Sooty. Corbett declared this ‘A horrible American idea’. Instead, he moved the show to commercial television. \n\nAfter he suffered a heart attack at Christmas 1975, his younger son, Peter (stage name Matthew), took over, buying out his father for £35,000. However he did make occasional appearances on 'The Sooty Show' for several years with his son. Harry continued his one-man stage show after he gave up his television appearances, and he died in his sleep on 17 August 1989, after playing to a capacity audience at Weymouth Pavilion in Weymouth, Dorset.\n\nIn 1988, Corbett was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\", commemorating forty years in the entertainment industry and the debut of Sooty. He married Marjorie ('Tobes') Hodgson in 1944. Corbett and his wife lived in the Dorset village of Child Okeford for most of their married life. He had a younger brother, Les, a saxophonist, whom Corbett played duets with, and would sometimes appear on The Sooty Show.\n\nHe was a Freemason under the jurisdiction of the United Grand Lodge of England. He was initiated in 1951 in Chevin Lodge No. 6848 in West Yorkshire. He became the lodge organist. The lodge still meets at Otley.\n\n\nWhen Prime minister Harold Wilson wished to have \"Steptoe and Son\" actor Harry H. Corbett awarded an OBE, the middle initial \"H\" was lost in the bureaucratic process, and the award went to Harry Corbett instead. Both were awarded the OBE on 1 January 1976, Harry Corbett being cited \"for charitable services\".\n\n"}

Due to arrest of Tadeusz Kostrzewski \"Niemira\" on 2 January 1944 it changed its name to \"Pegaz\" (\"Przeciw Gestapo – Against the Gestapo\"), and after another arrest it was reorganized as \"Parasol\" (\"umbrella\") battalion.

The osteostracans were more similar to lampreys than to jawed vertebrates in possessing two pairs of semicircular canals in the inner ear, as opposed to the three pairs found in the inner ears of jawed vertebrates. They are thought to be the sister-group to pituriaspids, and together, these two taxa of jawless vertebrates are the sister-group of gnathostomes. Several synapomorphies support this hypothesis, such as the presence of: sclerotic ossicles, paired pectoral fins, a dermal skeleton with three layers (a basal layer of isopedin, a middle layer of spongy bone, and a superficial layer of dentin), and perichondral bone.\n\nMost osteostracans had a massive cephalothorac shield, but all Middle and Late Devonian species appear to have had a reduced, thinner, and often micromeric dermal skeleton. This reduction may have occurred at least three times independently because the pattern of reduction is different in each taxon.\n\nThey were probably relatively good swimmers, possessing dorsal fins, paired pectoral fins, and a strong tail. The shield of bone covering the head formed a single piece, and so presumably did not grow during adult life. However, the way in which the bone was laid down makes it possible to examine the imprints of nerves and other soft tissues. This reveals the presence of complex sensory organs and the sides and upper surface of the head, which may have been used to sense vibrations.\n\nBelow is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic relationships of osteostracans from Sansom (2009):\n\n\n"}

During the ceremony, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 23 categories. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gil Cates and directed by Jeff Margolis. Actor Billy Crystal hosted the show for the third consecutive year. Three weeks earlier, in a ceremony held at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles on March 7, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Tom Hanks.\n\n\"The Silence of the Lambs\" won five awards including Best Picture. Other winners included \"\" with four awards, \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Bugsy\", and \"JFK\" with two, and \"City Slickers\", \"\", \"The Fisher King\", \"In the Shadow of the Stars\", \"Manipulation\", \"Mediterraneo\", \"Session Man\", and \"Thelma & Louise\" with one.

Moreover, it was the third film to win the \"Big Five\" major categories for picture, directing, lead acting performances, and screenwriting. The other two films to achieve this feat were 1934's \"It Happened One Night\" and 1975's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". \"Beauty and the Beast\" became the first animated film to be nominated for Best Picture. Best Actress winner Jodie Foster became the eleventh person to win the aforementioned category twice and at the age of 28, became only the second person after Luise Rainer to win two Academy Awards before the age of 30. \"Boyz n the Hood\"'s John Singleton became the first African-American to be nominated for Best Director and the youngest nominee in that category.

He christened the 1992 ceremony with the theme \"Pure Joy of the Movies\" explaining that \"Motion pictures provide us with laughter, romance, adventure and a deeper understanding of ourselves. With all the extraordinary events that are taking place today, it's wonderful that we can still get away to see a film.\"\n\nA month before the festivities, Cates recruited actor and comedian Billy Crystal to host the ceremony for the third straight year. According to \"Variety\" columnist Army Archerd, Crystal planned to perform a bungee jump stunt as part of his entrance at the beginning of the ceremony. However, the act was scrapped due to high insurance costs for the Academy and Crystal coming down with the flu. Instead, Crystal, who was wearing Hannibal Lecter's mask from \"The Silence of the Lambs\", was hauled onto the stage by two men.\n\nSeveral other people were involved in the production of the ceremony. Choreographer Debbie Allen supervised the Best Song nominee performances and the Best Original Score dance number. Film composer and musician Bill Conti served as musical director of the ceremony. In tandem with the theme of the ceremony, Chuck Workman produced a montage highlighting famous movie scenes from past and present.\n\nAt the time of the nominations announcement on February 19, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $393 million with an average of $78.7 million per film. \"The Silence of the Lambs\" was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $130.7 million in domestic box office receipts.

The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" (1st), \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" (2nd), \"Hook\" (5th), \"The Addams Family\" (7th), \"Backdraft\" (12th), and \"Star Trek VI: the Undiscovery Country\" (13th).\n\nSeveral days before the ceremony, LGBT activist groups such as Queer Nation and Out in Film announced plans to stage a protest outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. The organizations were voicing their complaints regarding derogatory and unflattering portrayals of homosexuals in film such as \"The Silence of the Lambs\", \"JFK\", and the upcoming film \"Basic Instinct\". Queer Nation spokesman Rick Wilson said that the demonstrators \"would stop cars from getting to the Oscars. It'll be a stall-in\". Wilson also announced plans to disrupt the proceedings inside the theater. In response, producer Gil Cates stated, \"Anyone can protest about anything they want outside the show.\" But he said that the standard, \"generic response\" to something happening during the ceremony on camera, \"would be to cut to a commercial.\" Moreover, Academy spokesman Bob Werden reiterated that while security plans would not be as stringent as the previous year, firemen and police officers would be on hand in case of fallout from the protests.\n\nOn the day of the telecast, several protesters carried various signs that contained statements such as \"Stop Hollywood's Homophobia\" and \"Hollywood Stop Censoring Our True Queer Lives.\" One man who had purchased tickets to the ceremony yelled statistics regarding AIDS in protest as John Candy was introducing a Best Song performance. The protester was immediately escorted out by security without any arrests, nor were his remarks heard during the broadcast.\n\nThe show received a positive reception from most media publications. \"The New York Times\" film critic Janet Maslin raved that the telecast was \"uncharacteristically lively.\" She also praised host Crystal saying that his opening monologue \"set the evening's clever and iconoclastic tone.\" Columnist Scott Williams of the Associated Press wrote that \"Crystal was charming from the moment he was wheeled onstage and strolled into the audience wearing the face mask of the demonic Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter from \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" which was named best picture.\" Ray Richmond from the \"Orange County Register\" commented that Crystal \"is such a magnificent Oscar host that the job should be his as long as he wants it.\"\n\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 44.44 million people over its length, which was a 5% increase from the previous year's ceremony. The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 29.84% of households watching over a 50.26 share. In addition, it also drew a higher 18–49 demo rating with a 20.71 rating over a 39.51 share among viewers in that demographic.\n\nIn July 1992, the ceremony presentation received nine nominations at the 44th Primetime Emmys. The following month, the ceremony won three of those nominations for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Program (Hal Kanter, Buz Kohan, Billy Crystal, Marc Shaiman, David Steinberg, Robert Wuhl, Bruce Vilanch), Outstanding Music Direction (Bill Conti, Jack Eskew, Julie Giroux, Ashley Irwin, Hummie Mann), and Outstanding Costume Design for a Variety or Music Program (Raymond Aghayan).\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2319323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319323", "title": "Elizabeth Bennet", "text": "Elizabeth Bennet\n\nElizabeth Bennet is the protagonist in the 1813 novel \"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen. She is often referred to as Eliza or Lizzy by her friends and family. Elizabeth is the second child in a family of five daughters. Though the circumstances of the time and environment push her to seek a marriage of convenience for economic security, Elizabeth wishes to marry for love.\n\nElizabeth is regarded as the most admirable and endearing of Austen's heroines. She is considered one of the most beloved characters in British literature because of her complexity. Austen herself described Elizabeth as \"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print.\"\n\nElizabeth is the second eldest of the five Bennet sisters of the Longbourn estate, situated near the fictional market village of Meryton in Hertfordshire, England. She is 20 years old by the middle of the novel. Elizabeth is described as an intelligent young woman, with \"a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous\". She often presents a playful good-natured impertinence without being offensive. Early in the novel, she is depicted as being personally proud of her wit and her accuracy in judging the social behaviour and intentions of others.\n\nHer father is a landowner, but his daughters cannot inherit because the estate is entailed upon the male line (it can only be inherited by male relatives). Upon Mr Bennet's death, Longbourn will therefore be inherited by his cousin and nearest male relation, Mr William Collins, a clergyman for the Rosings Estate in Kent owned by Lady Catherine de Bourgh. This future provides the cause of Mrs Bennet's eagerness to marry her daughters off to wealthy men.\n\nElizabeth is her father's favourite, described by him as having \"something more of quickness than her sisters\". In contrast, she is the least dear to her mother, especially after Elizabeth refuses Mr Collins' marriage proposal. Her mother tends to contrast her negatively with her sisters Jane and Lydia, whom she considers superior in beauty and disposition, respectively, and fails to understand her husband's preference. Elizabeth is often upset and embarrassed by her mother's and three younger sisters' impropriety and silliness.\n\nWithin her neighbourhood, Elizabeth is considered a beauty and a charming young woman with \"fine eyes\", to which Mr Darcy is first drawn. Darcy is later attracted more particularly to her \"light and pleasing\" figure, the \"easy playfulness\" of her manners, her mind and personality, and eventually considers her \"one of the handsomest women\" in his acquaintance.\n\nFrom the beginning, opinions have been divided on the character. Anne Isabella Milbanke gave a glowing review of the novel, while Mary Russell Mitford criticizes Elizabeth's lack of taste. The modern exegetes are torn between admiration for the vitality of the character and the disappointment of seeing Elizabeth intentionally suppress her verve and submit, at least outwardly, to male authority. In Susan Fraiman's essay \"The Humiliation of Elizabeth Bennett\", the author criticises the fact that Elizabeth must forgo her development as a woman in order to ensure the success of \"ties among men [such as her father and Darcy] with agendas of their own\". The Bennet sisters have only a relatively small dowry of £1,000; and as their family's estate will pass out of their hands when their father dies, the family faces a major social decline, giving the Bennet girls only a limited time in which to find a husband. About feminist criticism of the character, the French critic Roger Martin du Gard wrote that primary purpose of Austen was to provide \"jouissance\" (enjoyment) to her readers, not preach, but the character of Elizabeth is able to manoeuvre within the male-dominated power structure of Regency England to assert her interests in a system that favours her father, Mr Darcy, and the other male characters. Gard noted that the novel hardly glorifies patriarchy since it is strongly implied that was the financial irresponsibility of Mr Bennet that has placed his family in a precarious social position. Furthermore, it is Elizabeth who criticises her father for not doing more to teach her sisters Lydia and Catherine the value of a good character, which Mr Bennet disregards, leading to Lydia's eloping with Wickham. Unlike the more superficial and/or selfish characters like Lydia, Wickham, Mr Collins, and Charlotte, who regard marriage as a simple matter of satisfying their own desires, for the more mature Elizabeth marriage is the cause of much reflection and serious thought on her part.\n\nThe British literacy critic Robert Irvine stated that the reference in the novel to the militia being mobilised and lacking sufficient barracks, requiring them to set up camps in the countryside dates the setting of the novel to the years 1793–1795 as the militia was mobilised in 1793 after France declared war on the United Kingdom and the last of the barracks for the militia were completed by 1796. Irvine argued that a central concern in Britain in the 1790s, when Austen wrote the first draft of \"Pride and Prejudice\" under the title \"First Impressions\" was the need for British elites, both national and regional to rally around the flag in face of the challenge from revolutionary France. It is known that Austen was working on \"First Impressions\" by 1796 (it is not clear when she began working on the book) and finished off \"First Impressions\" in 1797. Irvine states while the character of Elizabeth is a clearly middle-class while Mr Darcy is part of the aristocracy. Irvine wrote \"Elizabeth, in the end, is awed by Pemberly, and her story ends with her delighted submission to Darcy in marriage. It is \"gratitude\" that forms the foundation of Elizabeth Bennet's \"love\" for Fitzwilliam Darcy: caught in a reciprocal gaze with Darcy's portrait at Pemberly, impressed with the evidence of his social power that surrounds her, Elizabeth 'thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before' ... Elizabeth's desire for Darcy does not happen \"despite\" the difference in their social situation: it is \"produced\" by that difference, and can be read as a vindication of the hierarchy which constructs that difference in the first place\". Irvine observes that Darcy spends about half his time in London while for people in Meryton London is a stylish place that is very far away, observing that a key difference is when one of the Bennet family is ill, they use the services of a local apothecary while Mr Darcy calls upon a surgeon from London. In this regard, Irvine argued that the marriage of Elizabeth and Darcy stands for the union of local and national elites in Britain implicitly against the challenge to the status quo represented by the French republic.\n\nBy contrast, the American scholar Rachel Brownstein argued that Elizabeth rejects two offers of marriage by the time she arrives at Pemberley, and notes in rejecting Mr Collins that the narrator of the novel paraphrases the feminist Mary Wollstonecraft that Elizabeth cannot love him because she is \"a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart\". Brownstein notes that it after she reads Darcy's letter following her first rejection of him that leads her to say \"Till this moment, I never knew myself\". Brownstein further states that Austen has it both ways in depicting Elizabeth as she uses much irony. After Elizabeth rejects Darcy and then realizes she loves him, she comments \"no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was\" as if she herself is aware that she is a character in a romance novel. Later, she tells Darcy in thanking him for paying off Wickham's debts and ensuring Lydia's marriage might be wrong \"for what become of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject?\".\n\nBrownstein argues that Austen's ironical way of depicting Elizabeth allows her to present her heroine as both a \"proto-feminist\" and a \"fairy-tale heroine\". At one point, Elizabeth says: \"I am resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to \"you\", or to any other person wholly unconnected with me\". The American scholar Claudia Johnson wrote this was a surprisingly strong statement for a female character in 1813. Likewise, Elizabeth does not defer to the traditional elite, saying of Lady Catherine's opposition to her marrying Darcy: \"Neither duty nor honor nor gratitude have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with Mr Darcy\". In the same, Elizabeth defends her love of laughter as somewhat life-improving by saying: \"I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good\". Elizabeth regarded herself as a competent to judge what is \"wise and good\", and refuses to let others dictate to her what she may or may not laugh at, making her one of the most individualistic of Austen heroines. However, Johnson noted that Austen hedged her bets here, reflecting the strict censorship imposed in Britain during the wars with France; Elizabeth reaffirms her wish to be part of the elite by marrying Darcy, instead of challenging it, as she says: \"He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal.\" In the same way Austen avoids the issue of filial obedience – questioning of which would have marked out as a \"radical\" – by having Mrs Bennet tell her daughter she must marry Collins where her father says she must not. However, the way in both Elizabeth's parents are portrayed as if not bad parents, then at least not entirely good parents, implies that Elizabeth is more sensible and able to judge people better than both her mother and father, making her the best one to decide who her husband should be. Reflecting her strong character, Elizabeth complains that Bingley is a \"slave of his designing friends\", noting for all his pleasantness that he does not have it in him to really stand up for himself; Johnson wrote the \"politically potent metaphor\" of a \"slave\" would had cut deeply at a time when slavery was still legal in the British Empire.\n\nSusan Morgan regards Elizabeth's major flaw to be that she is \"morally disengaged\" – taking much of her philosophy from her father, Elizabeth observes her neighbours, never becoming morally obligated to make a stand. Elizabeth sees herself as an ironic observer of the world, making fun of those around her. Elizabeth's self-destination is one of skepticism and opposition to the world around her, and much of the novel concerns her struggle to find her own place in a world she rejects. At one point, Elizabeth tells Darcy: \"Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies do divert me, I own, and I laught at them whenever I can\". Though Elizabeth is portrayed as intelligent, she often misjudges people around her because of her naivety – for example, misunderstanding the social pressures on her friend Charlotte to get married, is taken in completely for a time by Wickham and misjudges Darcy's character. After hearing Wickham's account disparaging Darcy's character, and being advised by her sister Jane not to jump to conclusions, Elizabeth confidently tells her \"I beg your pardon – one knows exactly what to think\".\n\nHowever, Elizabeth is able to see, albeit belatedly, that Wickham had misled her about Darcy, admitting she was too influenced by \"every charm of air and address\". Gary Kelly argued that Austen as the daughter of a Church of England minister would have been very familiar with the Anglican view of life as a \"romantic journey\" in which God watches over stories of human pride, folly, fall and redemption by free will and the ability to learn from one's mistakes. Kelly argued that aspects of the Anglican understanding of life and the universe can be seen in Elizabeth who after rejecting Darcy and then receives his letter explaining his actions rethinks her view of him, and comes to understand that her pride and prejudice had blinded her to who he really was, marking the beginning of her romantic journey of \"suffering and endurance\" that ends happily for her.\n\nAfter seeing Pemberley, Elizabeth realizes Darcy's good character, and as a chance to become part of society without compromising her values. At Pemberley, Elizabeth sees the \"whole scene\" from one viewpoint and then sees the \"objects were taking different positions\" from another viewpoint while remaining beautiful, which is a metaphor for her subjectivity had influenced her view of the world. Like other Austen heroines, Elizabeth likes to escape into the gardens and nature in general when under pressure. For Austen, gardens were not only places of reflection and relaxation, but also symbols of femininity and of England. The American scholar Alison Sulloway wrote: \"Austen had seen and suffered enough causal exploitation so that she took the pastoral world under her tender but unobtrusive fictional protection, just as she felt protective towards human figures under the threat of abuse or neglect\". Beyond that, Napoleon had often talked of desire to make England's fair gardens and fields his own, speaking if England \"...was a mere woman, ripe for his exploitation\", so for Austen, the beauty of the English countryside served as a symbol of the England her brothers serving in the Royal Navy were fighting to protect. Elizabeth's connection with nature leads to appreciate the beauty of Pemberley, which allows hers to see the good in Darcy. Notably, Elizabeth is not guided by financial considerations, and refuses to seek favour with the wealthy aristocrat Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Despite Mr Darcy's wealth, Elizabeth turns down his first marriage proposal and only accepts him after she realises that she loves him. Johnson wrote that given the values of Regency England that it was inevitable and expected that a young woman should be married, but Elizabeth makes it clear that what she wants to marry a man she loves, not just to be married to somebody, which was a quietly subversive message for the time.\n\nIn the early 19th century, there was a genre of \"conduct books\" settling out what were the rules for \"propriety\" for young women, and the scholar Mary Poovey argued in her 1984 book \"The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer\" examining the \"conduct books\" noted one of the main messages was that a \"proper young lady\" never expresses any sexual desire for a man. Poovey argued that in this context that Elizabeth's wit is a merely her ways of defending herself from the rules of \"propriety\" set out by the conduct books as opposed of being a subversive force. In this regard, Poovey argued that Austen played it safe by having Elizabeth abandon her wit when she falls in love with Darcy, taking her struggle into effort to mortify Darcy's pride instead of seeking him out because she loves him. The conduct books had a double meaning of the word modesty, which meant both to be outwardly polite in one's conduct and to be ignorant of one's sexuality. This double meaning of modesty placed women in a bind, since any young woman who outwardly conformed to expectations of modesty was not really modest at all, as she was attempting to hide her awareness of sexuality. In the novel, when Elizabeth rejects Mr Collins's marriage proposal, she explains she is being modest in rejecting an offer from a man she cannot love, which leads her to be condemned for not really being modest. Mr Collins often cites one of the more popular \"conduct books\", \"Sermons to Young Women\", which was published in 1766, but was especially popular in the decades from 1790 to 1810. Unlike the conduct books which declared that women should look back on the past as a way of self-examination, Elizabeth says: \"Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure\".\n\nJohnson wrote that changes in expectations for women's behavior since Austen's time has led many readers today to miss \"Elizabeth's outrageous unconventionality\" as she breaks many of the rules for women set out by the \"conduct books\". Johnson noted that Collins approvingly quote from \"Sermons to Young Women\" women should never display any \"briskness of air and levity of deportment\", qualities that contrasted strongly with Elizabeth who has \"a likely, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous\". The liveliness of Elizabeth also extends to the physical sphere, as she displays what Johnson called \"an unladylike athleticism\". Elizabeth walks for miles, and constantly jumps, runs and rambles about, which was not considered conventional behavior for a well-bred lady in Regency England. The narrator says that Elizabeth's temper is \"to be happy\", and Johnson wrote that her constant joy in life is what \"makes her and her novel so distinctive\". Johnson wrote: \"Elizabeth's relationship with Darcy resonates with a physical passion...The rapport between these two from start to finish is intimate, even racy\". Johnson wrote the way in which Elizabeth and Darcy pursue each in secret put their relationship \"on the verge of an impropriety unique in Austen's fiction\". Many of the remarks made by Elizabeth to Darcy such as \"Despise me if you dare\" or his \"I am not afraid of you\" resound with sexual tension, which reflected \"Austen's implicit approval of erotic love\".\nIn her letter to Cassandra dated 29 January 1813, Jane Austen wrote: \"I must confess that I think her as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print, and how I shall be able to tolerate those who do not like her at least I do not know\". Austen herself wrote to Cassandra about one fan of her books that \"Her liking Darcy & Elizth is enough\". The book notes that \"Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies\" are what delight Elizabeth, which Brownstein noted also applied to Austen as well. This mix of energy and intelligence, and her gaiety and resilience make Elizabeth a true Stendhal heroine according to Tony Tanner, and he adds that there are not many English heroines that we can say that of. Elizabeth Bowen, however, found her charmless, whilst to Gervase Fen she and her sisters were \"intolerable...those husband-hunting minxes in \"Pride and Prejudice\"\".\n\nThe character of Elizabeth Bennet, marked by intelligence and independent thinking, and her romance with the proud Mr Darcy have carried over into various theatrical retellings. Helen Fielding's novel \"Bridget Jones's Diary\", as well as the film series of the same name, is a modern adaptation of \"Pride and Prejudice\", with Elizabeth as Renée Zellweger's title character. In Gurinder Chadha's Bollywood adaptation, \"Bride and Prejudice\", Aishwarya Rai plays the Elizabeth character, Lalita Bakshi. In the 2008 television film \"Lost in Austen\", actress Gemma Arterton plays a version of Lizzy who switches places with a modern-day young woman. Lily James starred as the zombie-slaying Elizabeth Bennet in the film version of \"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\", a popular novel by Seth Grahame-Smith.\n\nOne of the most notable portrayals of the character has been that of Keira Knightley in \"Pride & Prejudice\", directed by Joe Wright. Knightley received a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her performance.\n\nThe character has most recently been used in \"The Lizzie Bennet Diaries\", a project which is partly headed by YouTube vlogger Hank Green, and depicts Elizabeth (played by Ashley Clements) as a modern-day woman in America posting video blogs about her life along with her friend 'Charlotte Lu' a character based on Charlotte Lucas.\n\n"}

In addition, the pass-through expansion bus provided was stripped, only allowing a ZX Printer to be attached.\n\nAvailability of cartridge software is very limited: The cost was almost twice as much as the same game on cassette tape, and each cartridge can only hold 16 KiB, making it almost immediately obsolete as the majority of Spectrums sold were 48K-models, which the software publishers targeted.\n\nOnly ten games were commercially released:\n\n\nPaul Farrow has demonstrated that it is possible to produce custom ROM cartridges, including the ability to exceed the 16 KiB design limitation of the ROM cartridges.\n\nThe interface two comes with two joystick ports that (unlike the Kempston which used the IN31 command) are mapped to actual key presses. Player 1 is mapped to – and player 2 is mapped to –. This initially seemed at odds with Sinclair's own keyboard layout, given that the keyboard itself has the cursor keys mapped to – with typically being used by games as a fire button.

During the ceremony, Academy Awards (commonly referred to as the Oscars) were presented in 23 categories. The ceremony, which was televised in the United States on ABC, was produced by Gil Cates and directed by Jeff Margolis. Actor Billy Crystal hosted for the second consecutive year. Three weeks earlier in a ceremony held at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California on March 2, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Geena Davis.\n\n\"Dances with Wolves\" won seven awards including Best Picture. Other winners included \"Dick Tracy\" with three awards, \"Ghost\" with two awards, and \"American Dream\", \"Creature Comforts\", \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", \"\", \"Goodfellas\", \"The Hunt for Red October\", \"Journey of Hope\", \"The Lunch Date\", \"Misery\", \"Reversal of Fortune\", and \"Total Recall\" with one. The telecast garnered nearly 43 million viewers in the United States.\n\nThe nominees for the 63rd Academy Awards were announced on February 13, 1991, at 5:38 a.m. PST (13:38 UTC) at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Karl Malden, president of the Academy, and actor Denzel Washington. \"Dances with Wolves\" led the nominations with twelve total; \"Dick Tracy\" and \"The Godfather Part III\" tied for second with seven each.\n\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 25, 1991. Kevin Costner became the fifth person to earn the Best Director Award for his directorial debut and to earn nominations for Best Actor and Best Director for the same film. Best Supporting Actress winner Whoopi Goldberg was the second African American woman to win an award. Hattie McDaniel previously won in the same aforementioned category for \"Gone With the Wind\".\n\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface and indicated with a double-dagger ().\n\nThe following 15 films had multiple nominations:\n\nThe following three films received multiple awards.\n\nThe following individuals, listed in order of appearance, presented awards or performed musical numbers.\n\nRiding on the critical praise from last year's ceremony, the Academy rehired former film producer and former Directors Guild of America president Gilbert Cates to oversee production of the Oscar ceremony for the second straight time. Two months before the awards gala, Cates selected actor and comedian Billy Crystal to host the show for the second consecutive year. In a statement released by AMPAS, Crystal joked, \"It's a great honor, and I hope to bring the show in under nine hours.\"\n\nAs with the last year's theme of \"Around the World in 3 1/2 Hours,\" Cates centered the show around a theme. He christened the ceremony with the theme \"100 Years of Film\" in celebration to the centennial of the development of both the kinetoscope by Thomas Edison and celluloid film by Eastman Kodak. In tandem with the theme, the show featured an ambitious opening segment. Actor Michael Caine introduced the segment live via satellite from the Salon Indien du Grand Café in Paris, where the short film \"L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat\" made its debut in 1895. After a brief clip of the film, the show cut back to the Shrine Auditorium stage where actress Jasmine Guy and other dancers performed whilst a montage of film clips were projected in the background. Filmmaker Chuck Workman filmed a vignettes featuring actors such as Sally Field, Andy García, and Anjelica Huston discussing the first movie he or she watched.\n\nSeveral other people participated in the production of the ceremony. Film composer and musician Bill Conti served as musical director for the ceremony. Dancer Debbie Allen choreographed a dancer number showcasing the Best Original Score nominees. Despite losing eight members of her band in a plane crash, a visibly emotional Reba McEntire performed the Best Original Song nominee \"I'm Checkin' Out\" from the film \"Postcards from the Edge\". At the beginning of the ceremony, wrangler Lisa Brown escorted host Crystal, and Beechnut, a horse that was prominently featured in the upcoming film \"City Slickers\".\n\nThis ceremony was the last year in which there were no official nominees for Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. \"Back to the Future Part III\", \"Dick Tracy\", \"Ghost\" and \"Total Recall\" advanced to a second stage of voting, but only \"Total Recall\" received a requisite average and it was given a special achievement Oscar.\n\nAt the time of the nominations announcement on February 12, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $458.2 million with an average of $41 million per film. \"Ghost\" was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $213.5 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by \"Dances with Wolves\" ($104.3 million), \"The Godfather Part III\" ($62.5 million), \"Goodfellas\" ($41 million), and finally \"Awakenings\" ($36.7 million).\n\nOf the top 50 highest-grossing films of the year, 51 nominations went to 12 films on the list. Only \"Ghost\" (2nd), \"Pretty Woman\" (3rd), \"Dances with Wolves\" (8th), \"Dick Tracy\" (9th), \"The Godfather Part III\" (17th), \"Goodfellas\" (30th), and \"Awakenings\" (34th) were nominated for Best Picture, directing, acting or screenwriting. The other top 50 box office hits that earned the nominations were \"Home Alone\" (1st), \"The Hunt for Red October\" (5th), \"Total Recall\" (6th), \"Days of Thunder\" (12th), and \"Edward Scissorhands\" (22nd).\n\nThe show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Rick DuBrow of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"It was a long day's journey into night for Oscar, one of the most effective sleeping pills of the year.\" He also added that while host Crystal started out strong, his jokes fell flat as the night progressed. \"The Washington Post\" television critic Tom Shales noted that Crystal, \"followed many gags by instantly rating the reaction of the audience, as if it were up to them to please him instead of the other way around.\" In addition, he commented, \"The Oscars seemed more of a fizzle than usual this year.\" Columnist Dan Craft of \"The Pantagraph\" remarked, \"The Oscar show has become innocuously hip and yuppified. Kitsch and nostalgia have given way to efficiency and upward mobility. Everyone is tiresomely well-behaved and, worse, well-dressed.\" He also commented that host Crystal's insider showbiz jokes fell flat and were confusing to television audiences.\n\nOther media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Columnist Harold Schindler of \"The Salt Lake Tribune\" wrote, \"Billy Crystal kept things moving Monday night in such a manner that the extra quarter-hour was scarcely noticeable.\" He also said of the telecast's theme of film history, \"The Academy used its film library to excellent advantage.\" Film critic Leonard Maltin remarked, \"Emotions ran high and they gave us all a chance to feel vicariously what it might be like to win this kind of award...good guys finishing first and the part of Hollywood we like best, a happy ending.\" \"Orlando Sentinel\" film critic Jay Boyar complimented Crystal for invigorating the gala noting that his \"clever remarks at the academy's 63rd annual awards presentation struck an entertaining balance between inside-Hollywood quips and general-audience jests.\"\n\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 42.7 million people over its length, which was a 6% increase from the previous year's ceremony. An estimated 76 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 28.4% of households watching over a 48 share. It was the most watched Oscars telecast since the 56th ceremony held in 1984.\n\nIn July 1991, the ceremony presentation received nine nominations at the 43rd Primetime Emmys. The following month, the ceremony won three of those nominations for Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Program (Gil Cates), Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program (Billy Crystal), and Outstanding Writing for a Variety or Music Program (Hal Kanter, Buz Kohan, Billy Crystal, David Steinberg, Bruce Vilanch, and Robert Wuhl).\n\n\n\nOfficial websites\n\nAnalysis\n\nOther resources\n"}

Shortly after their arrival, they were met by the indigenous people that inhabited the land. The Nationality law is set forth in the Aliens and Nationality Law of 1973, based on its 1847 Constitution. Current citizenship laws explicitly state being Black as a prerequisite to citizenship. The first constitution allowed for women to transmit their nationality to their children, although multiple citizenship was not permitted nor is it permitted in revisions of the constitution.\n\nLiberia confers nationality solely on the basis of race. Under the current Liberian constitution, only persons of black African origins may obtain citizenship, although Liberian law allows members of other races to hold permanent residency status. Within Liberia itself, the wider implications of the policy are part of a heated debate in which some native Liberians themselves have acknowledged that non-black African permanent residents are crucial contributors to the country's economic activities and innovation system, mainly the wealthy Lebanese community.\n\nFeatures of the first constitution that have been upheld include:\n\n\nThe Liberian legislature was charged with establishing criteria for naturalisation. All applicants must be black Africans to be naturalized.\n\nUnder the terms of Chapter 20 of the Aliens and Nationality Law (based on Article 27(b) of the Constitution), citizenship applies to any \"person who is a Negro, or of Negro descent, born in Liberia and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" or \"person born outside Liberia whose father (i) was born a citizen of Liberia; (ii) was a citizen of Liberia at the time of the birth of such child, and (iii) had resided in Liberia prior to the birth of such child.” These provisions have been criticised as discriminatory on the basis of both race and sex.\n\nCitizenship through naturalisation is governed by Chapter 21 of the Aliens and Nationality Law. Naturalisation requires a two-step process of first making a declaration of intent to naturalise before a Circuit Court, followed by the actual petition for naturalisation which must be filed between the second and third anniversary dates of the declaration of intent. The eligibility requirements for naturalisation are as follows:\n\nSection 21.31 provides that the non-citizen child whose father is naturalised as a Liberian citizen also becomes a Liberian citizen provided that the child is under 21 years of age and residing in Liberia as a lawful permanent resident at the time of the father's naturalisation. No similar provisions are available for the non-citizen children of women naturalised as Liberian citizens.\n\nSection 21.32 restored the citizenship of women who, under the operation of previous nationality law, had lost citizenship as a result of a marriage to a non-citizen husband but had not acquired any foreign nationality except any automatically conferred by marriage.\n\nLiberian nationality law provides no special considerations for the non-citizen spouse of a Liberian citizen. Such a non-citizen can only acquire Liberian citizenship through the same naturalisation procedure laid out for other non-citizens.\n\nThe circumstances leading to loss of Liberian citizenship are principally described in Chapter 22 of the Aliens and Nationality Law, although circumstances leading to revocation of naturalisation are given in Chapter 21. The following acts are listed in Chapter 22 as effecting a loss of Liberian citizenship:\n\nChapter 21 gives the following as criteria for revocation of naturalisation:\n\nThe provision allowing for revocation of naturalisation as a consequence of residence abroad has been criticised as creating two classes of Liberian citizens and for reducing the capabilities of naturalised Liberians to pursue employment and educational opportunities abroad. The provision for the revocation of a minor's naturalisation following the revocation of the father's naturalisation has been criticised as unfair to the child.\n\nThe Aliens and Nationality Law prohibits dual citizenship except in limited circumstances. This has been criticised as detrimental to links between Liberia and the diaspora.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2319364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319364", "title": "Claudius Buchanan", "text": "Claudius Buchanan\n\nRev Claudius Buchanan DD FRSE (12 March 1766 – 9 February 1815) was a Scottish theologian, an ordained minister of the Church of England, and an evangelical missionary for the Church Missionary Society. He served as Vice Provost of the College of Calcutta in India.\n\nBuchanan was born in Cambuslang near Glasgow. His father, Alexander Buchanan, was the local schoolmaster in Inverary.\n\nHe was educated at the University of Glasgow and the Queens' College, Cambridge. He was ordained in 1795 by the Bishop of London.\n\nAfter holding a chaplaincy in India at Barrackpur (1797–1799), Buchanan was appointed Calcutta chaplain and vice-principal of the college of Fort William. In this capacity he did much to advance Christianity and native education in India, especially by organizing systematic translations of the scriptures.\n\nDuring a visit to Malabar in 1806, present day South-western state of Kerala, he visited Mar Thoma VI, head of the Malankara Church at Angamali, near Kochi. Mar Thoma was very happy to hear Buchanan’s intention of translating the Bible into Malayalam, the local language, and he presented a Syriac Bible said to be of some antiquity to Buchanan. The Bible was subsequently deposited among the Oriental Manuscripts in the public library of the University of Cambridge.\n\nIn January 1806, Buchanan was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\n\nHe died in Broxbourne in Herefordshire in 1815 where he was superintending an edition of the Syriac Scriptures (c.f. his extensive memorial inscription). He is buried, along with his wife Mary and two infant children, in the churchyard of Holy Trinity, Little Ouseburn, North Yorkshire. His former residence, Moat Hall, is adjacent to the church.\n\nBuchanan was influential in introducing the Jagannath tradition and Hinduism to Western audiences in the early 19th-century. He called Jagannath \"Juggernaut\" and Hindu \"Hindoo\" in the letters he wrote from India. According to Michael J. Altman, a professor of Religious Studies, Buchanan presented Hinduism through \"Juggernaut\", as a \"bloody, violent, superstitious and backward religious system\" that needed to be eliminated and substituted with the Christian gospel. He described \"Juggernaut\" with Biblical terminology for his audience, called him the Moloch, and his shrine as Golgatha – the place where Jesus Christ was crucified – but with the difference that the \"Juggernaut tradition\" was of endless meaningless bloodshed, and fabricating allegations that children were sacrificed in the \"valley of idolatrous blood shed to false gods\". In his letters, states Altman, Buchanan \"constructed an image of Juggernaut as the diametric opposite of Christianity\". In his book \"Christian Researches in Asia\", published in 1811, Buchanan built on this theme and added licentiousness to it. He called hymns in the language he did not comprehend as \"obscene stanzas\", artworks on temple walls as \"indecent emblems\", and described \"Juggernaut\" and Hinduism to his readers as the religion of disgusting Moloch and false gods. Buchanan's writings formed the \"first images of Indian religions\" to the evangelical audience in the early 19th century and were promoted by American magazines such as The Panoplist. His book on \"Juggernaut\" attracted enough reader demand that it went through numerous editions.\n\nBuchanan's pamphlets moved Christian missionaries and triggered a bitter debate between them and officials of the East India Company. His writings led to many emotional sermons and mission advocates lectured on the need to \"combat immorality and convert the unsaved\" Indians. The writings of Buchanan and other missionaries constructed and exploited cultural and religious differences, which had a profound and lasting effect on how Americans saw non-Christian peoples.\n\nAn account of his travels in the south and west of India is given in his \"Christian Researches in Asia\" (Cambridge, 1811). After his return to the United Kingdom in 1808, he still took an active part in matters connected with India, and, by his book entitled \"Colonial Ecclesiastical Establishment\" (London, 1813), he assisted in settling the controversy of 1813, which eventually ended in the establishment of an Anglican Indian episcopate in 1878 in the Travancore-Cochin states. This Church, known as CMS Church, merged with other Churches in South India on 27 September 1947 to form The Church of south India (CSI).\n\nA collection of 'Sermons on interesting subjects' by Buchanan was published by J Ogle in Edinburgh in 1812. It consists of the texts of eight sermons preached in the Britain between 26 February 1809 and 2 June 1811. The first sermon was entitled \"The Star in the East\". It was preached in the parish church of St James, Bristol, on the author's return from India.\n\n\n"}

He became first became interested in the language at school in St. Finian's College and later again when he chanced upon Irish lessons in the nationalist newspaper \"Young Ireland\". He had help at first from a few old people who spoke the language, and while at St Patrick's College, Maynooth, where he continued his studies for the priesthood from the year 1882, he spent his holidays in Irish-speaking areas in the north, west and south. He got to know the Aran Islands and wrote about them in the bilingual \"Gaelic Journal\" (\"Irisleabhar na Gaedhilge\"), which he was later to edit. \nHe was ordained priest in 1888.\n\nHe served for a short time as a curate in the Diocese of Meath but because of his proficiency in the language was appointed in the re-established Chair of Irish at Maynooth in 1891. He was editor of the \"Gaelic Journal\" between 1894 and 1899 and during his tenure ensured that more material was published in Irish.\n\nFor O’Growney language, nationality and religion were closely linked. In 1890, writing in the \"Irish Ecclesiastical Review\", he described literature in Irish as “the most Catholic literature in the world”. He was aware, however, of its other aspects, adding that “even if Irish were to perish as a spoken language, it would remain valuable from the pure literature point of view”.\n\nHis \"Simple Lessons in Irish\", first published in the newspaper the \"Weekly Freeman\", proved so popular that they were published in booklet form. There were five books in the series, and by 1903 320,000 copies had been sold. In a foreword he states:\n\nHe was a founding member of the Gaelic League, which was created in Dublin in 1893 \"for the purpose of keeping the Irish language spoken in Ireland\", and later became its vice-president.\n\nIn 1894, failing health caused him to go to Arizona and California, where he died. Some years after, with the aid of Irish sympathisers in the United States, his body was brought back to Ireland\n\nHis funeral, held on 26 September 1903 at the Catholic Pro-Cathedral, Dublin, was attended by 6,000 people, including members of the trade guilds, clerics, politicians, members of the nationalist Gaelic Athletic Association and students.\n\nHe is buried in the cemetery attached to St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.\n\nCaerwyn Williams J.E & Ní Mhuiríosa, Máirín. \"Traidisiún Liteartha na nGael\".

It is located in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China, with an elementary school campus on Ersha Island, Yuexiu District and a middle and high school campus in Science Park, Huangpu District (formerly Luogang District). Founded in 1981, it is the oldest international school in South China. AISG offers an international curriculum guided by American educational standards and principles.\n\nAISG was founded in 1981 under the auspices of the U.S. Consulate. Originally named the American School of Guangzhou (ASG), its purpose was to educate the American children of consular employees. The first year, seven students attended classes taught by volunteer teachers in the Dong Fang Hotel. The aim was to enable students to integrate smoothly into the American educational system when they returned to their home country. The children of other consulates' employees were soon admitted and the school relocated to the Garden Hotel in 1985. In 1994, with over one hundred students from 21 nations, ASG moved into a purpose-built school in the Greenery, a housing estate in the Tianhe District. The school expanded to include high school (grades 9 through 12) during the 1996–97 academic year, and its first three graduates received their diplomas in 1998.\n\nASG was reorganized legally in 1998 as a non-profit corporation in the United States, which then contracted with the school entity registered in China for the provision of educational services. As part of this process, the school changed its name to the American International School of Guangzhou and gained official recognition by the People’s Republic of China as a school serving expatriate children. In 2001, AISG received authorization from the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) to offer the IB Diploma Programme. In August 2002, AISG moved to a new, purpose-built facility on Ersha Island, and in 2004 received permission from the IBO to offer the Primary Years Program. Grades K–12 were all housed at the Ersha Campus until 2007, when the middle school and high school divisions moved to a separate, purpose-built campus in Science Park, a district in eastern Guangzhou. AISG’s Early Childhood Center, which teaches preschool students from age 3, was added to the Ersha campus site at this time. AISG celebrated its 35th anniversary during the 2016–17 school year.\n\n\nThere are two campuses: Ersha Island Campus (二沙岛校区) and Science Park Campus (科技城校区).\n\n\n\nIt the Elementary School, activities in the arts, sports, community service, and academic extension are available. Activities include art and crafts, drama, choir, sudoku, language study, lego building, martial arts, student council, and STEM.\n\nMiddle and High School students are involved in many extracurricular activities. Student may join music and drama clubs as well as Model United Nations, Global Issues Network, Quiz Bowl, student government, science, robotics, and media activities. Community service initiatives include Habitat for Humanity, Roots and Shoots, and working with mentally challenged adults in Guangzhou. High School and Middle School students also participate in China trips, during which each grade travels to an area in China, including Hong Kong, and Macau.\n\nClub involvement is considered an integral aspect of the educational experience at the American International School of Guangzhou. AISG has a variety of clubs students may join, many with a focus on community service. Clubs include:\nThe Beacon is the school's student-run newsmagazine and is published regularly throughout the academic year.\n\nThe Mosaic is the school's yearbook.\n\nArtistic License is an annual literary magazine publishing poetry, prose, and artwork by members of the AISG community.\n\nLIPHY is a magazine with articles and word definitions created for distribution to local students learning English.\n\nAt the Elementary School, after school sports include volleyball, soccer, floor hockey, taekwondo, table tennis and badminton.\n\nAISG fields sports a large number of teams at the High School and Middle School level. Some of the sports that many students participate competitively in are volleyball, basketball, soccer, tennis and badminton, in which they play against other international schools and Chinese universities in the region. In 2008, AISG joined the Asia Pacific Activities Conference, which allows the students to compete against the top international Schools from China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, and the Philippines. APAC also includes activities such as Drama, Forensics and Debate, Orchestra and Band. AISG has withdrawn from ACAMIS for the high school teams since it is member of APAC. The middle school is a member of the Southern Delta Region Conference (SDRC), which provides opportunities to play other international schools in the region.\n\n\n\nAISG is a member of the Asia Pacific Activities Conference. APAC includes 12 international schools in the Asia-Pacific area, including International School of Beijing (ISB), Western Academy of Beijing (WAB), Concordia International School, Shanghai (CISS), Shanghai American School-Puxi (SAS-PX), Shanghai American School-Pudong (SAS-PD), Hong Kong International School (HKIS), Brent International School (BISM), Taejon Christian International School (TCIS), Canadian Academy (CA), Seoul Foreign School (SFS) and United Nations International School of Hanoi. APAC sponsors athletic and fine/performing arts events throughout the school year. For each event, high school students from participating schools travel to a designated school and are housed by host families. APAC athletics include basketball, volleyball, soccer, badminton, tennis, table tennis, baseball, softball, rugby, cross country, swimming, and track and field. Performing arts activities include orchestra, choir, dance, band, and theatre.\n\nMeals are prepared on-site on each campus, and students use a prepaid lunch card system to purchase them. The cafeterias and cafes serve nutritionally balanced options. Students may also bring their own food.\n\nAISG promotes a best fit policy, guiding students in finding the best college matches for who they are and what they want to do. With students heading to highly-regarded undergraduate institutions such as the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, Washington University in St. Louis, University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Hong Kong University, University College London (UCL), École hôtelière de Lausanne, Seoul National University, and Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in the Classes of 2019 and 2020, AISG is highly respected by many admissions teams.\n"}

The team was founded in 1923. They play at the Tzar Samuil Stadium in Petrich, which has a capacity of 9,500. The club last played in the first tier of Bulgarian football during the 2008-09 season.\n\nBelasitsa Petrich was founded in 1923 as FC Manush Voivoda. From 1957 the club was called DFS Belasitsa after the union of the local football clubs \"Stroitel\", \"Cherveno zname\", \"Torpedo\" and \"Spartak\", i.e. all the teams from Petrich. \n\nIn 1980, Belasitsa promoted to A PFG for the first time ever. In its debut season in the Bulgarian elite in season 1980-81, the team finished in 13th place. In that same season, Belasitsa recorded its best appearance at the Bulgarian Cup, reaching the semifinals. They eliminated then holders of the cup, Slavia Sofia along the way. In the semifinal played on April 22 1981, in Karlovo, Belasitsa lost to eventual winners Botev Plovdiv, by 6-0. \n\nDuring these years, Belasitsa earn themselves a reputation for playing very strong home games, losing only 2 games in 4 years. The team relied almost entirely on youth academy players. They played in the Bulgarian elite up until season 1983-84, when they were relegated after playoffs. \n\nIn 2001, 17 years after their relegation, Belasitsa returned to A PFG through administrative decisions made by the BFU. That year Belasitsa united with Hebar Pazardzik, who finished 9th in the 2000-01 season, thus entering the elite once again. The team however, finished 13th during the 2001-02 season and were relegated back to B PFG. \n\nA year later, Belasitsa returned to the elite, and began its best ever campaign in the Bulgarian elite, managing to stay 6 straight seasons, up until 2009. One of the reasons for such strong results during these years was the fact that the team had brought a lot of talented Brazilian players, including Marcelo Vava, Dianu, Marquinos, and Eduardo Du Bala. In 2005, the team hired Macedonian coach Stevica Kuzmanovski, under whose guidance Belasitsa achieved its best ever result in the Bulgarian league, finishing in 6th place. Next season 2006-07, Belasitsa also performed strongly, finishing in 8th place. \n\nHowever, after that season, a decline starts, as the team finished in 13th place during the 2007-08 season, saving themselves from relegation in the last round. Unfortunately for Belasitsa, they finished last during the 2008-09 season, thus being relegated. \n\nAfter they were relegated to the B PFG in 2009, it was discovered that the team was in serious financial and administrative irregularities, and their future was very unclear. Belasitsa could not register enough players for the 2009-10 B PFG, so they were disqualified before the season started. They were administratively relegated to the V AFG for that season. In 2012, further economic problems began and the team was in danger from ceasing its operations. However, the team is eventually saved, with the financial support coming from the Municipality of Petrich. Belasitsa was further relegated to the fourth tier of Bulgarian football, the regional amateur league for the 2012-13 season. They achieved first place and were promoted back to the V AFG, where they still play as of 2019.\n\nBulgarian First League:\n\nBulgarian Cup:\n\n\n\n"}

During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 23 categories. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gil Cates and directed by Jeff Margolis. Actor Billy Crystal hosted the show for the first time. Three weeks earlier in a ceremony held at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California on March 3, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by hosts Richard Dysart and Diane Ladd.\n\n\"Driving Miss Daisy\" won four awards including Best Picture and Best Actress for Jessica Tandy, the oldest person at the time to win a competitive acting Oscar. Other winners included \"Glory\" with three awards, \"Born on the Fourth of July\", \"The Little Mermaid\", and \"My Left Foot\" with two, and \"The Abyss\", \"Balance\", \"Batman\", \"Cinema Paradiso\", \"\", \"Dead Poets Society\", \"Henry V\", \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\", \"The Johnstown Flood\", and \"Work Experience\" with one. The telecast garnered more than 40 million viewers in the United States.\n\nThe nominees for the 62nd Academy Awards were announced on February 14, 1990 at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Karl Malden, president of the Academy, and the actress Geena Davis. \"Driving Miss Daisy\" received the most nominations with nine total; \"Born on the Fourth of July\" came in second with eight. Winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 26, 1990. \"Driving Miss Daisy\" became the third film to win Best Picture without a Best Director nomination. At age 80, Jessica Tandy became the oldest winner of competitive acting Oscar at the time. Kenneth Branagh was the fifth person nominated for Best Lead Actor and Best Director for the same film.\n\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface and indicated with a double-dagger ().\n\n\n\nThe following 19 films received multiple nominations:\n\nThe following five films received multiple awards:\n\nThe following individuals presented awards or performed musical numbers.\n\nAfter the negative reception received from the preceding year's ceremony, AMPAS created an Awards Presentation Review Committee to evaluate and determine why the telecast earned such a negative reaction from the media and the entertainment industry. The committee later determined that Carr's biggest mistake was allowing the questionable opening number to run for 12 minutes. Producer and former Directors Guild of America president Gilbert Cates, who headed the committee, said that Carr would have not received such harsh criticism if the number had been much shorter. Newly elected AMPAS president Karl Malden also commented on the last year's telecast, \"Some of the people in the Academy felt the show got a little out of control.\"\n\nIn September 1989, Cates was chosen as producer of the 1990 telecast. Malden explained the decision to hire him saying, \"Cates, a veteran film and TV director known for his tasteful work in both media will attempt to rectify the damage the last Oscar show did to the Academy's reputation.\" The following January, actor and comedian Billy Crystal was chosen as host of the ceremony. \"We are extremely pleased to have Billy host the show,\" Cates said in a press release justifying his choice. \"His unique talents and his ability to handle the unexpected will be important assets this year.\"\n\nCates christened the show with the theme \"Around the World in 3 1/2 Hours\" commenting that it would \"a party thrown around the world\". He also explained, \"The world is changing, and hopefully the awards show is changing, matching the changes in the world.\" In tandem with the program's theme, several presenters announced the winners from various international locales such as Buenos Aires, London, Moscow, and Sydney, Australia.\n\nSeveral other people participated in the production of the ceremony. Documentary filmmaker Chuck Workman assembled a montage saluting \"100 Years at the Movies\" that was shown at the beginning of the telecast. Film composer and musician Bill Conti served as musical director for the ceremony. Dancer and singer Paula Abdul supervised the Best Song nominee performances and a dance number featuring the Best Costume Design nominees. Singer Diana Ross performed the Oscar-winning song \"Over the Rainbow\" in a tribute to the 50th anniversary of \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nAt the time of the nominations announcement on February 14, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $244 million with an average of $48.9 million. \"Dead Poets Society\" was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $95.8 million in the domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by \"Field of Dreams\" ($64.4 million), \"Born on the Fourth of July\" ($48.6 million), \"Driving Miss Daisy\" ($35.6 million) and \"My Left Foot\" ($2.1 million).\n\nOf the 50 grossing movies of the year, 43 nominations went to 14 films on the list. Only \"Parenthood\" (8th), \"Dead Poets Society\" (9th), \"When Harry Met Sally...\" (10th), \"Field of Dreams\" (17th), \"Born on the Fourth of July\" (25th), \"Driving Miss Daisy\" (36th) and \"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\" (45th) were nominated for Best Picture, acting, directing, or screenwriting. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nomination were \"Batman\" (1st), \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" (2nd), \"Lethal Weapon 2\" (3rd), \"Back to the Future II\" (6th), \"The Little Mermaid\" (12th), \"The Abyss\" (22nd), and \"Black Rain\" (27th).\n\nThe show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Film critic Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" gave an average review of Crystal but lamented, \"The effort to make this year's Academy Awards show an international media miracle led to nothing but headaches.\" \"The Washington Post\" television critic Tom Shales bemoaned, \"while Crystal's opening monologue seemed to hit the right notes, he hit fewer and fewer as the evening wore on; his interjected quips between awards were mostly uninspired.\" He also criticized the dance numbers and numerous \"Around the World\" cutaways calling it pointless. Howard Rosenberg of the \"Los Angeles Times\" quipped that the broadcast was \"a conventional telecast that was arguably an extension of an industry calcified by convention.\" He gave positive remarks toward Crystal but felt that \"The Oscarcast was an old kid on the block.\"\n\nOther media outlets received the broadcast more positively. \"USA Today\" television critic Matt Roush lauded \"To the glib and savvy Billy Crystal, who kept things as lively and funny as he could all night long. What a chore, too.\" He concluded that, \"Hollywood no doubt went to bed happy (maybe early), because for a change Oscar didn't embarrass himself.\" Mike Drew of the \"Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\" remarked, \"While too \"inside\" and not as funny as Hollywood thinks he is, Crystal was an efficient host.\" Film critic Carrie Rickey of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" wrote, \"It was encouraging that director Gilbert Cates took the opportunity to emphasize films instead of chorus girls.\" She also extolled Crystal's performance acknowledging that his \"nimble opening number set a Johnny Carson comic tone.\"\n\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 40.24 million people over its length, which was a 5% decrease from the previous year's ceremony. An estimated 69.31 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The show also drew lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 27.82% of households watching over a 49.42 share.\n\nIn July 1990, the ceremony presentation received five nominations at the 42nd Primetime Emmys. Two months later, the ceremony won one of those nominations for Outstanding Art Direction for a Variety or Music or Programming (Roy Christopher and Greg Richman).\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2319377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319377", "title": "PFC Beroe Stara Zagora", "text": "PFC Beroe Stara Zagora\n\nBeroe () is a Bulgarian professional association football club based in Stara Zagora, that competes in the First League, the top division of the Bulgarian football league system. The club was founded in 1916 under the name \"Vereya\". The club's colours are green and white.\n\nSince then the home ground of Beroe has been the homonymous Beroe Stadium in Stara Zagora with a seating capacity of 12,128. Beroe were the 1986 champions of Bulgaria and they also won the Bulgarian Cup twice in 2010 and 2013. In terms of international achievements, Beroe hold the record for Balkans Cups titles, having won the tournament four times. The club's most noted and successful player is Petko Petkov, 2 times A Group Top Scorer: 1974 (with 20 goals) and 1976 (with 19 goals).\n\nFootball was played in Stara Zagora as early as 1916, however with no organized championship in Bulgaria until the late 1920s, numerous clubs enjoyed regional success in those early years for the game in both the city and Bulgaria itself. Beroe can trace its roots back to 4 May 1924, when it was founded as Beroya, after the merger of two other clubs – Borislav and Rekord.\n\nThe club withstood the almost constant chaos and strife of the times, often caused by numerous shifts in the political regimes of Bulgaria, and despite many mergers and name changes throughout the first four decades of its history, it is constantly among the top 3 clubs in the city. It has also often been the platform for attempts to unite all the clubs in Stara Zagora, which foreshadowed its role and meaning for the city in the years to come.\n\nThe establishment of an organized league to determine the champion of Bulgaria in the late 40s coincided with the consolidation of football in Stara Zagora, the city finally seeing a one single strong club emerge to represent it at the highest level of Bulgarian football. That club was Beroe, at first bearing the names of Udarnik and Botev, before finally restoring its old name in 1959.\n\n1968 marked the beginning of Beroe's golden age. During the summer transfer period, the forward Petko Petkov joined the club. In the next 12 years he scored 144 goals for the club in A Group. Beroe became all-powerful, winning the Balkans Cup in 1968 (beating in the final Spartak Sofia with a 6–4 on aggregate) and 1969 (beating Dinamo Tirana with a 4–0 on aggregate).\n\nIn season 1971–72 in the domestic league was very successful for the team, which finished 3rd, and qualified for the UEFA Cup. The club's first participation in UEFA Cup was also promising, with Beroe eliminating the Austrian Austria Wien (7–0 and 3–1) and the Hungarian Honvéd (3–0 and 0–1) respectively and reaching the third round (but being knocked out by the Yugoslav OFK Beograd).\n\nIn season 1973–74 Beroe reach the quarter-finals of the Cup Winners' Cup: after eliminating the Luxembourg Fola Esch and the Basques of Athletic Bilbao, they were stopped in DDR by 1. FC Magdeburg (2–0 and 1–1).\n\nBeroe have had some success in Europe, such as the 1–0 win over Juventus in a Cup Winners' Cup first-leg in 1979 and a 3–0 win over Athletic Bilbao in 1973. Moreover, Beroe is one of the two Bulgarian football clubs that has a positive record of the matches played in European club competitions.\n\nIn 1982 and 1984 Beroe won the Balkans Cup for the third and fourth times.\n\nIn 1986, the team led by the coach Evgeni Yanchovski won the Bulgarian title, the first in the club's history. Beroe finished the season with 43 points (after 20 wins, 4 draws and 6 losses). Beroe played in the 1986–87 UEFA European Champions Cup where they were eliminated in the first round to Dynamo Kyiv of the Soviet Union after 1–1 at Beroe Stadium and 0–2 loss in Kiev.\n\nThe 1990s would see a gradual decline as Beroe were relegated to B Group in season 1994–95, finishing in last place with twelve points.\n\nThe advent of democracy in Bulgaria ushered a new period of chaos and economical hardship for the country, and that didn't pass by Beroe. Nevertheless, despite several seasons of crisis the club again withstood the test of time, and despite needing a helpful merger with another team – Olimpik (Teteven) – remained a key player on the Bulgarian football scene.\n\nThe first two seasons back in top division saw Beroe fight relegation, with safety being achieved by second-half runs. In 2001–02 season the team again relegated.\n\nIn the autumn of 2007 the actual majority shareholder of Professional Football Club Beroe JSCo Nikolay Banev gave up the financial support of the team. In spite of that, the team demonstrated good football in most of the games. On the 10th of January, 2008 23 players and 3 coaches terminated their contracts with the club after a planned sale of the shares had failed.\n\nBeroe got out of trouble on the 3rd of February 2008, when the Beroe veterans’ club and the national fanclub, assisted by lawyer Damian Georgiev initiated, through related firms, insolvency proceedings in respect of the club in the Regional Court of Stara Zagora. The appointed administrator Elka Petrova transferred all the assets and liabilities of the club to a newly established joint-stock company Professional Football Club Beroe Stara Zagora JSCo.\n\nThe new entity succeeded Professional Football Club Beroe JSCo as regard of the license, the membership in the Bulgarian Football Union and the running of the football team itself.\n\nIn the summer of 2009 due to the world economic crisis most of the shareholders left the club due to financial problems. The club's main sponsor Brikel JSCo transferred its shares to Beroe veterans’ club and the national fanclub, who appointed a new Board of Directors. It consists of Damyan Georgiev – Chairman, Genyo Petrov – Executive Director and Tsvetelin Zhoevski.\n\nIn the 2007–08 season Beroe lost their place in A Group, due to a controversial match between Belasitsa Petrich and Marek Dupnitsa in the last round of the season. In the very next season, however, Beroe won first place in B Group and returned to the top flight. At that time Ilian Iliev had already been manager of the club for the last 2 years. In the year to follow, Beroe achieved its best season in over 20 years, beating all of the main competitors for the Bulgarian Cup. Beroe eliminated CSKA Sofia in the quarter-finals, which paved the way for them to obtain the trophy, winning against second-division Chernomorets Pomorie 1–0 in the final at Lovech Stadium. The winning goal was scored dramatically in the very last seconds of the added time by Beroe's former youth player Doncho Atanasov, who also went on to become top goalscorer of the tournament with 4 goals. Beroe became one of the only two Bulgarian teams that have won the cup without succeeding any goals. This success led to Ilian Iliev being awarded with the Coach of the Season award, as well as Ivo Ivanov (defender) being proclaimed best defender in A Group for 2009. Besides him other players that played a main role throughout the season were Iskren Pisarov, Georgi Andonov, Zdravko Iliev, Slavi Zhekov, Dian Genchev. One of the players with most matches in A Group for all times Kostadin Vidolov ended up his career mid-season with Beroe and went on to become a coach for Beroe's second team.\n\nBeroe started 2010–11 season with the debut of the team in the UEFA Europa League. Beroe entered the competition in the third qualifying round and faced the Austrian side Rapid Wien. The game in Bulgaria ended in a 1–1 draw. Rapid Wien won the rematch with 3–0 putting an end to the international campaign of the Bulgarian team.\n\nBeroe started 2012–13 season in Bulgarian Cup eliminating Akademik Svishtov in the second round.\nIn the quarter-finals Beroe eliminated Lokomotiv (Mezdra) with aggregate result of 8–1, and then Pirin (Gotse Delchev) in the quarter-finals and Slavia Sofia in the semi-finals. In the final match at Lovech Stadium in Lovech against Levski Sofia, the result after 90 minutes was 3–3. After Beroe had taken the lead with 3–1 in the 80th minute, Levski Sofia with 10 men restored the tie, after Hristo Yovov received a second yellow card in the end of the first half. At the penalty shoot-out Levski Sofia scored just 1 from 4 penalties and Beroe, 3 of 5 which meant that Beroe had won the cup for the second time in the club's history.\n\nBeroes colours are green and white.\n\nFirst League:\n\nBulgarian Cup:\n\nBulgarian Supercup:\n\nSecond League:\n\nEuropean Cup/Champions League\n\nUEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League\n\nCup Winners' Cup\n\nBalkans Cup\n\nTopscorers (5)\n\n \n\n\"For recent transfers, see Transfers summer 2019 and Transfers winter 2019–20.\"\n\nUp to five non-EU nationals can be registered and given a squad number for the first team in the A PFG however only three can be used during a match day.

The team has also three training grounds, the Beroe stadium base includes also tennis facilities and covered training hall. Built in 1959, the stadium is currently being renovated and has around 13,000 seating places, most of which are covered. The stadium has its own gymnastics, acrobatics and boxing hall. There is also a table-tennis facility. The stadium's overall capacity is about 15,000. The Beroe stadium has the fastest athletics lane and was often used for such competitions. The biggest attendance was in 1986 when the team won the championship title and more than 40,000 spectators were celebrating together with the players.\n\nThe club has very strong support in the country. Their group is called Zara Boys.\n\nBeroe's main rival is Botev Plovdiv. The match between these two teams is called Thracian Derby. They also have a strong rivalry with the two most popular teams in the country – Levski Sofia and CSKA Sofia. Other teams that are in bad relations with Beroe are Lokomotiv Plovdiv and especially Neftochimic Burgas.\n\nThe only team with which fans Zara Boys have a strong friendship is Etar Veliko Tarnovo.\n\nEvgeni Yanchovski holds Beroe's overall appearance record – he played 341 matches over the course of 14 seasons from 1960 to 1974. This is also the record for League appearances. Beroe's all-time leading scorer is Petko Petkov, who scored 144 goals while at the club from 1968 to 1980. Beroe's biggest victory is 8–0 in A Group against Minyor Pernik in 1973–74 and Chernomorets Burgas Sofia in 2006–07. Beroe's 7–0 defeat of Austria Wien in 1972 was its largest Europe win. Beroe's heaviest defeat, 2–10, came against CSKA Sofia in 1991–92.\n\n\n"}

It is headquartered in Dunstable, England. \n\nCosta Coffee was founded in London in 1971 by two Brothers Bruno and Sergio Costa as a wholesale operation supplying roasted coffee to caterers and specialist Italian coffee shops. Acquired by Whitbread in 1995, it was sold in 2019 to The Coca-Cola Company in a deal worth £3.9bn, and has grown to 3,401 stores across 31 countries and 18,412 employees. The business has 2,121 UK restaurants, over 6,000 Costa Express vending facilities and a further 1,280 outlets overseas (460 in China).\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company announced its intention of acquiring Costa Limited from parent company Whitbread PLC for $5.1 billion. The deal, which closed on 3 January 2019, gives the cola giant a strong coffee platform across parts of Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa. It is the second largest coffeehouse chain in the world, and the largest in the UK.\n\nBrothers Bruno and Sergio Costa founded a coffee roastery in Lambeth, London, in 1971, supplying local caterers. The family had moved to England from Parma, Italy, in the 1960s. Costa branched out to selling coffee in 1978, when its first store opened in Vauxhall Bridge Road, London.\n\nIn 1985, Sergio bought out Bruno's share of the company. Bruno went on to found a tableware company. By 1995, the chain had 41 stores in UK, and was acquired by Whitbread, the UK's largest hotel and coffee shop operator, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary. In 2009, Costa opened its 1,000th store, in Cardiff. In December 2009, Costa Coffee agreed to acquire the Polish chain Coffeeheaven for £36 million, adding 79 stores in central and eastern Europe.\n\nIn 2018, Whitbread faced pressure from two of its largest shareholders, activist group Elliott Advisers and hedge fund Sachem Head to sell or demerge Costa Coffee, the theory being the individual businesses would be worth much more than as one company. On 25 April 2018, Whitbread announced its intention to fully demerge Costa within two years. Subsequently, Coca-Cola announced a deal to acquire the chain. On 3 January 2019, The Coca-Cola Company completed the acquisition of Costa Coffee for $4.9 billion from Whitbread.\n\nOn 20 November 2019, Costa Coffee announced that Dominic Paul would step down as CEO of the company and be succeeded by Jill McDonald.\n\nIn March 2020, all UK coffee shops were forced to close indefinitely due to nationwide lockdown rules introduced by the government to limit the spread of COVID-19. In late May, a select few branches reopened for takeaway only, whole many more branches opened for drive-through orders. \n\nCosta sells:\n\nCosta Coffee moved its own roastery from Lambeth to Basildon, Essex, in May 2017 with an investment of £38 million, increasing the roasting capacity from 11,000 to 45,000 tons of coffee beans per year.\n\nCosta Coffee employs Gennaro Pelliccia as a coffee taster, who had his tongue insured for £10m with Lloyd's of London in 2009.\n\nCosta Coffee operates 2,467 outlets in the United Kingdom as of October 2019. Overseas, it operates 1,413 stores in 32 countries. The first Costa store outside the UK opened in the UAE in 1999 and, in September 2017, was the first coffee shop worldwide to start delivering coffee via drones to customers sunbathing on Dubai's beaches.\n\nFollowing Whitbread's £59.5m acquisition of Coffee Nation, a chain of coffee machines, the machines were re-branded as Costa Express. The company plans to expand to target hospitals, universities and transport interchanges. In Denmark, Costa Express machines are located in Shell stations. Costa Express machines were previously available in Shell locations in Canada, but have since been removed. In the UK, grocery store chain SPAR has become a major operator of petrol station stores, most of which have Costa Express machines installed.\n\nAs of September 2018, Costa Coffee was available on 3 continents in 32 countries, with 3,882 total locations.\n\nOn 19 August 2019 Costa Coffee attracted media attention due to claims of unfair deductions from the pay of its employees. Reports stated that current and former employees had £200 deducted from their pay for training as well as additional deductions for till discrepancies and running costs.\n\nClaims of unfair deductions were triggered by a Twitter post suggesting that staff at a Costa store were forced to reimburse money lost to scammers who came into the store.\n\nTrying to distance themselves from the controversy, Costa said contracts for franchise stores are managed by partners and that some staff contracts did have \"clauses relating to deductions\".\n\nOn 23 August additional claims appeared in the media that Costa Coffee franchise workers are \"not treated like humans\".\n\nThe report included managers' alleged refusal to pay for sickness or annual leave, working outside of contracted hours and the retention of tips.\n\nIt cited an anonymous former employee at a store under Goldex Essex Investments Ltd who claimed they had almost £1,000 of their holiday pay deducted from their salary, despite being contracted to work 48 hours a week.\n\nThe report went on to say that baristas and employees at managerial level have complained about the numerous deductions outlined in Costa Coffee contracts written by franchise partners. A former manager is quoted as saying she had £150 deducted from her wages because she was five minutes late opening the store.\n\nOther fines outlined in the contracts were for used uniform that was damaged when returned to the employer, excessive waste and till discrepancies.\n\nIn response to this article a Costa Coffee spokesperson said an independent audit has been launched.\n\nCosta Coffee has been the sponsor of the Costa Book Awards (formerly the Whitbread Book Awards) since 2006.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2319384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319384", "title": "Books in the Cthulhu Mythos", "text": "Books in the Cthulhu Mythos\n\nMany fictional works of arcane literature appear in H.P. Lovecraft's cycle of interconnected works often known as the Cthulhu Mythos. The main literary purpose of these works is to explain how characters within the tales come by occult or esoterica (knowledge that is unknown to the general populace). However, in some cases the works themselves serve as an important plot device. Thus, in Robert Bloch's tale \"The Shambler from the Stars\", a weird fiction writer seals his doom by casting a spell from the arcane book \"De Vermis Mysteriis\".\n\nAnother purpose of these tomes was to give members of the Lovecraft Circle a means to pay homage to one another. Consequently, Clark Ashton Smith used Lovecraft's \"Necronomicon\" (his most prominent creation) in Smith's tale \"Ubbo-Sathla\". Likewise, Lovecraft used Robert E. Howard's \"Nameless Cults\" in his tale \"Out of the Aeons\". Thereafter, these texts and others appear in the works of numerous other Mythos authors (some of whom have added their own grimoires to the literary arcana), including August Derleth, Lin Carter, Brian Lumley, Jonathan L. Howard, and Ramsey Campbell.\n\nHe must meet the Black Man, and go with them all to the throne of Azathoth at the centre of ultimate Chaos. That was what she said. He must sign in his own blood the book of Azathoth and take a new secret name now that his independent delvings had gone so far.\n<br>—H.P. Lovecraft, \"The Dreams in the Witch House\"\nThe Book of Azathoth is a creation of Lovecraft's. It is mentioned in \"The Dreams in the Witch House\" as a book harbored by Nyarlathotep in the form of the Black Man (or Satan). The protagonist, Walter Gilman, is forced to sign the book in his blood, pledging his soul to the Other Gods. The idea of the book is likely based on classical descriptions of witch-cults, Satanic rites, and the signing away of souls.\n\nOther authors have expanded on the Book. Michael Alan Nelson writes (in his \"Fall of Cthulhu\" series for Boom! Studios) that the signer attracts the attention of the Other Gods by writing their name in the book. Glynn Owen Barrass states (in \"The Starry Wisdom Library\") that the book praises the Lovecraftian pantheon and renounces/mocks the Christian scripture.\n\n. . . \"The Book of Eibon\", that strangest and rarest of occult forgotten volumes ... is said to have come down through a series of manifold translations from a prehistoric original written in the lost language of Hyperborea.\n<br>—Clark Ashton Smith, \"Ubbo-Sathla\"\nThe \"Book of Eibon\", or \"Liber Ivonis\" or \"Livre d'Eibon\", is attributed to Clark Ashton Smith. It appears in a number of Lovecraft's stories, such as \"The Haunter of the Dark\" (\"Liber Ivonis\"), \"The Dreams in the Witch House\" (\"Book of Eibon\"),\"The Horror in the Museum\" (\"Book of Eibon\"), \"The Shadow Out of Time\" (\"Book of Eibon\") and \"The Man of Stone\", a collaboration with Hazel Heald (\"Book of Eibon\").\n\nThe book is supposed to have been written by Eibon, a wizard in the land of Hyperborea. It was an immense text of arcane knowledge that contained, among other things, a detailed account of Eibon's exploits, including his journeys to the Vale of Pnath and the planet Shaggai, his veneration rituals of Zhothaqquah (Eibon's patron deity), and his magical formulae—such as for the slaying of certain otherworldly horrors. Unfortunately, only one complete fragment of the original is known to exist, scattered in different places of our world, though there are translations in English, French, and Latin—\"Liber Ivonis\" is the title of the Latin translation.\n\nSmith presents his short story \"The Coming of the White Worm\" as Chapter IX of the Book of Eibon.\n\nThe \"Book of Iod\" was created by Henry Kuttner and first appeared in his short story \"Bells of Horror\" (as Keith Hammond; 1939). The original \"Book of Iod\", of which only one copy exists, is written in the \"Ancient Tongue,\" possibly a combination of Greek and Coptic. Although its origin is unknown, the book may have been written by the mysterious author \"Khut-Nah,\" which sounds remarkably like Kuttner. The \"Book of Iod\" contains details about Iod, the Shining Hunter, Vorvados, and Zuchequon. The Huntington Library of San Marino, California is said to hold an expurgated translation, possibly in Latin, by Johann Negus.\n\n\"The Book of Iod\" was also the title of a short-story collection published by Chaosium in 1995, containing ten Cthulhu Mythos stories by Henry Kuttner, along with three related stories by Kuttner, Robert Bloch, Lin Carter, and Robert M. Price.\n\nThe Celaeno Fragments is credited to August Derleth. In his novel \"The Trail of Cthulhu\", \"Celaeno\" refers to a distant planet that contains a huge library of alien literature. Professor Laban Shrewsbury and his companions traveled to Celaeno several times to escape Cthulhu's minions. Shrewsbury later wrote the Celaeno Fragments, a transcript of what he remembered of his translations of the books in the Great Library of Celaeno. He submitted the transcript, which consisted of about fifty pages, to the Miskatonic University's library in 1915.\n\nThe \"Cthäat Aquadingen\", possibly meaning \"Things of the Water\" (As Aquadingen can be translated from Dutch into Water/Aqua things), was created by Brian Lumley for his short story \"The Cyprus Shell\" (1968). This text, by an unknown author, deals with Cthulhu and other sea-horrors, such as Inpesca. It also contains many so-called \"Sathlattae\", rituals and spells related to Ubbo-Sathla. It is first mentioned as appearing in northern Germany around 400 AD. A Latin version was apparently written between the 11th and 12th century, as was an English translation that appeared sometime in the 14th century.\n\n\"Cultes des Goules\", or \"Cults of Ghouls\", was created by Robert Bloch (August Derleth claimed to have invented the fictional text, but this was denied by both Lovecraft and Bloch himself). The work is often misattributed to August Derleth because the fictional author is the \"Comte d'Erlette\". . It is a book on black magic, and the uses of the dead written by Francois-Honore Balfour (Comte d'Erlette) in 1702. It was first published in France, and later denounced by the church. Only a handful of copies are in existence. One of the known copies was kept for 91 years in an arcane library of the Church of Starry Wisdom in Providence, Rhode Island. After Robert Blake’s mysterious death in 1935, Doctor Dexter removed the grimoire and added it to his library.\n\n\"Cultes des Goules\" is mentioned numerous times in the works of Caitlin R. Kiernan and plays an especially important role in her 2003 novel \"Low Red Moon\". The text is also prominently mentioned in her short story \"Spindleshanks (New Orleans, 1956)\" — collected in \"To Charles Fort, With Love\" (2005).\n\nThe book \"Cultes des Goules\" is also mentioned in passing as being part of a collection that was discovered in the titular castle in the 1981 novel \"The Keep\", but does not appear in the 1983 movie based on the book.\n\n\"De Vermis Mysteriis\", or \"Mysteries of the Worm\", is a grimoire created by Robert Bloch, first appearing in Bloch's short story 'The Secret in the Tomb\" (\"Weird Tales,\" May 1935) and featured extensively in Bloch's \"The Shambler from the Stars\" (1935). It also was used by Stephen King in his short story \"Jerusalem's Lot\" and novel \"Revival\".\n\nThe \"Dhol Chants\" was first mentioned in the short story \"The Horror In The Museum\" (1932) by Lovecraft and Hazel Heald. They are alluded to in passing as a semi-mythical collection of chants attributed to the almost-human people of Leng. The chants themselves are never described, nor do they appear in any other of Lovecraft's works. August Derleth later used the chants in his stories \"The Gable Window\" (1957), \"The Lurker at the Threshold\" (1945), and \"The Shadow Out of Space\" (1957).\n\nMiskatonic University's library is said to hold a copy of the \"Dhol Chants\".\n\nRichard F. Searight invented \"The Eltdown Shards\" in a head-note (which purported to be a quotation from this text) to his story \"The Sealed Casket\" (Weird Tales, March 1935). The story was actually published in that issue without the headnote. Lovecraft later quoted the unpublished headnote in a letter to Clark Ashton Smith, \"leading some to believe that he wrote it\". He cited the book in \"The Shadow Out of Time\" and \"The Challenge from Beyond\".\n\nThe Eltdown Shards are mentioned in numerous mythos stories. They are mysterious pottery fragments found in 1882 and named after the place where they were discovered, Eltdown in southern England. The shards date to the Triassic period and are covered with strange symbols thought to be untranslatable. Nonetheless, several authors have penned their own interpretations of the markings, including Gordon Whitney and his \"The Eltdown Shards: A Partial Translation\". Many of these works, as well as a number of non-academic versions, have circulated among secretive cults.\n\nWhitney's translation is remarkably similar to the Pnakotic Manuscripts, a text produced by the Great Race of Yith. The translation describes Yith, the planet from which the Great Race came, and the Great Race's fateful encounter with the Yekubians. A magical formula from the nineteenth shard is for the summoning of the \"Warder of Knowledge\"; unfortunately, the dismissal portion of the ritual is garbled, so the summoning of this being could prove calamitous. Despite its connections to the Great Race, the Eltdown Shards were most likely inscribed by the Elder Things, who probably buried the ceramics in England when it was part of the great supercontinent Pangaea.\n\nThe G'harne Fragments first appeared in the works of Brian Lumley. They are described as a set of miraculously preserved shards of obsidian or some other black stone that record the history of the pre-human African city of G'harne. The lost city is located somewhere in the southern Sahara Desert, and is currently a frequent haunt of the chthonians.\n\nThe two primary translators of the fragments are Sir Amery Wendy-Smith and Gordon Walmsley. Both of these scholars died in Lumley's works: Sir Amery in \"Cement Surroundings\" (1969) and Walmsley in \"In the Vaults Beneath\" (1971).\n\n\"The King in Yellow\" is a widely censored play. Its author is unknown, and is believed to have committed suicide after publishing it in 1889. The play is named after a mysterious supernatural figure featured in it, who is connected to a peculiar alien symbol, usually wrought in gold, called the Yellow Sign. Though the first act is said to be \"innocent\", all who read the play's second act either go mad or suffer another terrible fate. Its setting and events include mysterious places and entities such as Carcosa, Hastur, and the Lake of Hali, names that Chambers borrowed from the writings of Ambrose Bierce.\n\nThe play was first imagined in a collection of short stories by Robert W. Chambers also named \"The King in Yellow\", published in 1895 and set in a hypothetical year 1920. Lovecraft was a fan of the book and included references to the Lake of Hali and the Yellow Sign in his short story \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" (1930). August Derleth later expanded on this connection in his own stories, rendering Hastur as an evil deity related to Cthulhu and the King In Yellow as one of his incarnations.\nKarl Edward Wagner and Joseph S. Pulver returned Chambers creations to their original cosmic horror roots. Both are great advocates of Chambers' work and have written many stories that utilize Chambers creations. Pulver also edited an anthology of Chambers inspired stories called \"A Season in Carcosa\".\n\nSee Book of Eibon.\n\nThe Haunter of the Dark\n\nThe \"Necronomicon\" is arguably the most famous (or infamous) of Lovecraft's grimoires. It appears in a number of Lovecraft's stories, as well as in the writings of other authors.\n\n\"On the Sending Out of the Soul\" appears in Henry Kuttner's short story \"Hydra\" (1939). It is an eight-page pamphlet on astral projection. The pamphlet appeared in Salem, Massachusetts in 1783 and circulated among occult groups. Most copies were destroyed in the wake of a series of grisly murders.\n\nThe first seven pages of the pamphlet contain vague mystic writing; however, the eighth page details a formula for effecting astral travel. Among the required ingredients are a brazier and the drug \"Cannabis indica\". The formula is always successful but has an unforeseen side effect: it invokes the horrid Outer God the Hydra.\n\nThe Parchments of Pnom is a manuscript written by Hyperborea's leading genealogist and soothsayer. It is written in the \"Elder Script\" of that land and contains a detailed account of the lineage of the Hyperborean gods, most notably Tsathoggua.\nThe Pnakotic Manuscripts is named after the place where it was kept, the city of Pnakotus, a primordial metropolis built by the Great Race of Yith. The Great Race is credited with authoring the Manuscripts, though other scribes would add to it over the ages.\n\nF. Paul Wilson is among the authors who have referred to this collection in their own work; a collated version of the Manuscripts appears in Wilson's novel \"The Keep\".\nAlso known as \"Puahotic Fragments\" mentioned in H. P. Lovecraft's ghost writing \"The Horror in the Museum\".\n\nThe \"Ponape Scripture\" first appeared in Lin Carter's short story \"Out of the Ages\" (1975). The \"Scripture\" is a manuscript found in the Caroline Islands by Captain Abner Exekiel Hoag sometime around 1734. The book showed signs of great age—its pages were made of palm leaves and its binding was of an ancient, now-extinct cycadean wood. It was written in Naacal (the language of Mu) and appears to have been authored by Imash-Mo, high priest of Ghatanothoa, and his successors. The book contains details of Mu and of Zanthu, high priest of Ythogtha. With the help of his servant Yogash (hinted to be a Deep One hybrid), Hoag managed to write a translation of the manuscript. But when he tried to have it published, his efforts were thwarted by religious leaders who strongly objected to the book's references to Dagon. Nonetheless, copies of the \"Scripture\" have circulated among secretive cults (such as the Esoteric Order of Dagon) and other occult groups. After Hoag's death, his granddaughter, Beverly Hoag Adams, published an expurgated version of the book.\n\nIn contemporary times, other versions of the \"Ponape Scripture\" have seen print. Harold Hadley Copeland, a leading authority on the \"Scripture\", produced a translation of the book, published in 1907 by Miskatonic University Press. Copeland also cited the book in his work \"The Prehistoric Pacific in Light of the 'Ponape Scripture\"' (1911). The original version of the manuscript remains at the Kester Library in Salem, Massachusetts.\n\n\"Las Reglas de Ruina\" (literally \"the Rules of Ruin\") first appeared in Joseph S. Pulver's novel \"Nightmare's Disciple\". It is a tome written by Philip of Navarre in 1520, a Spanish friar of the 16th century. The book has been translated in English by Professors Theodore Hayward Gates and Pascal Chevillion in 1714 and describes the Great Old One Kassogtha, sister and incestuous bride of Cthulhu. The book also foretells of the coming of a messiah of destruction, who would be born in the western land of the red savage across the great ocean in Columbus' New World, a man that shall set the Great Old One free from her stellar prison. Livia Llewellyn elaborated on this, describing the violent sexual acts committed by Kassogtha worshipers.\n\nThe \"Revelations of Gla'aki\" first appeared in Ramsey Campbell's short story \"The Inhabitant of the Lake\" (1964). It was written by the undead cult worshipping the Great Old One Gla'aki. Whenever Gla'aki slept, the members of his cult had periods of free will, and, since they were part of Gla'aki and shared his memories, they wrote down what they remembered of their master's thoughts. The cult's handwritten manuscripts later came to be known as the \"Revelations of Gla'aki\". The text originally contained eleven volumes, nine in the carefully abridged published edition, but it may have had more at different times in the past. Rumor has it that Mythos Scholar, Antonius Quine, once published a corrected edition of the Revelations of Gla'aki bound in a single volume.\n\nThe \"Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan\" is a collection of writings mentioned by Lovecraft in \"The Other Gods\" (1921) and \"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\" (1926). In both stories, the books are mentioned in conjunction with the Pnakotic Manuscripts. They are kept in the temple of the Elder Ones in the city of Ulthar; no other existing copies are mentioned in Lovecraft's works. Barzai the Wise studied the books before his journey to see the gods dancing on Mount Hatheg-Kla, while Randolph Carter consulted them during his quest to reach Kadath. Other than that, little is known about them.\n\nThe collection can be considered to be an analogue to the \"I Ching\", a Chinese text of cosmology and divination.\n\nThe Tarsioid Psalms are a collection of writings dating back the early Cenozoic Era, probably attributed to a primate-folk which lived in North America during Paleocene/Eocene times. They describe the evil destructive entity named \"Ngyr-Korath\" and its spawn, the Great Old One 'Ymnar.\n\nNow, as he sat there in a state half terror, half stupor, his eyes were drawn to the wizard volume before him: the writings of that evil sage and seer, Carnamagos, which had been recovered a thousand years ago from some Graeco-Bactrian tomb, and transcribed by an apostate monk in the original Greek, in the blood of an incubus-begotten monster. In that volume were the chronicles of great sorcerers of old, and the histories of demons earthly and ultra-cosmic, and the veritable spells by which the demons could be called up and controlled and dismissed.\n<br>—Clark Ashton Smith, \"The Treader of the Dust\"\n\"The Testament of Carnamagos\" was created by Clark Ashton Smith and first appeared in his short story \"Xeethra\" (1934). The text is featured more prominently in Smith's \"The Treader of the Dust\" (1935). Confusedly, Xeethra is set in the far distant future on Zothique, earth's last continent, whereas \"The Treader of the Dust\" is set in (Smith's) current times.\n\nThe book gives a description of the Great Old One Quachil Uttaus, among others. Only two copies are known of, though one was destroyed during the Spanish Inquisition. The only remaining copy is bound in shagreen, and fastened with hasps of human bone.\n\n\"Unaussprechlichen Kulten\" was created by Robert E. Howard, and was written by the fictional Friedrich von Junzt. Howard originally called the book \"Nameless Cults\", but both Lovecraft and Derleth gave it the German title which can translate to either Unspeakable Cults or Unpronounceable Cults (both meaning of the word are in common usage).\n\nThe name is grammatically incorrect. In proper German it would be named either 'Unaussprechliche Kulte' or 'Von Unaussprechlichen Kulten' (Of Unspeakable Cults).\n\nThe Zanthu Tablets first appeared in \"The Dweller in the Tomb\" (1971), by Lin Carter. The centerpiece of the story is the discovery of the tablets, which are an important part of Carter's Xothic legend cycle.\n\nThe tablets themselves are twelve engraved pieces of black jade inscribed by Zanthu, a wizard and high priest of Ythogtha. They are written in a hieratic form of Naacal, the language of the sunken continent of Mu. The tablets reveal a partial history of Mu, describing Zanthu's struggle against the rising cult of Ghatanothoa and his own religion's lamented decline. He also describes his failed attempt to release the god Ythogtha from its prison. Upon witnessing three black, beaked, slimy heads, \"vaster than any mountain\", rising from a gorge, he flees in terror when he realizes that they are merely the god's fingertips. According to Zanthu, he and some of his people escaped the destruction of Mu, which was sunk by the wrath of the Elder Gods.\n\nIn 1913, guided by the \"Ponape Script\", Harold Hadley Copeland led an expedition into Indochina to locate the plateau of Tsang and to find the tomb of Zanthu. After the other members of the expedition died or deserted him, Copeland pressed on, eventually reaching his goal. Opening the tomb, he was horrified to discover that the mummified face of Zanthu resembled his own. Later wandering into a Mongolian outpost, a starving and raving Copeland was the only survivor of the expedition.\n\nCopeland published a brochure entitled \"The Zanthu Tablets: A Conjectural Translation\" in 1916. He made the rough translation using a key borrowed from the estate of Colonel Churchward, the last qualified translator of ancient Naacal, and heavily edited it out of a concern for \"public sanity\". The controversial brochure was later denounced by the academic community and was suppressed by the authorities. Copeland's later manuscripts were never published. Ten years after the publication of the brochure, Copeland died in an asylum.\n\nCarter's story \"The Thing in the Pit\" in his \"Lost Worlds\" purports to be a translation from the Zanthu Tablets.\n\nAn ancient manuscript found in Asia, written circa in 1100 BC during Zhou dynasty.

It mainly consisted of members of the Szare Szeregi paramilitary Boy Scouts. It was formed in late August 1943. A part of the Radosław Group, the battalion played a major role in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.\n\nZośka was named after Tadeusz Zawadzki, who used the name as his pseudonym during the AK's early days. He was killed during a partisan action.\n\nZośka fighters liberated prisoners of the concentration camp Gęsiówka in the August 1944. The 383 able-bodied prisoners (including 348 Jews), both men and women who were left in Gęsiówka to assist with the destruction of the evidence of mass murder, were rescued from certain death. Most of these survivors joined the Zośka unit and fought in the Warsaw uprising.\nOther famous Home Army battalions were: Miotła, Czata, Pięść, and Batalion Parasol. Between 1944 and 1956, all of the former members of Batalion Zośka were incarcerated in the Soviet NKVD prisons.\n\n"}

During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 23 categories. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Allan Carr and directed by Jeff Margolis. Ten days earlier, in a ceremony held at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Angie Dickinson.\n\n\"Rain Man\" won four awards, including the Best Picture. Other winners included \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", also four wins (three competitive and one special); \"Dangerous Liaisons\", with three awards; and \"The Accused\", \"The Accidental Tourist\", \"A Fish Called Wanda\", \"The Appointments of Dennis Jennings\", \"Beetlejuice\", \"Bird\", \"\", \"The Milagro Beanfield War\", \"Mississippi Burning\", \"Pelle the Conqueror\", \"Tin Toy\", \"Working Girl\", and \"You Don't Have to Die\" with one each. The telecast garnered almost 43 million viewers in the United States, the highest since the 56th ceremony in 1984.\n\nThe nominees for the 61st Academy Awards were announced on February 15, 1989, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Richard Kahn, president of the Academy, and actress Anne Archer. \"Rain Man\" led all nominees, with eight nominations; \"Dangerous Liaisons\" and \"Mississippi Burning\" tied for second with seven each.\n\nThe winners were announced at the award ceremony on March 29, 1989. Best Actress winner Jodie Foster became the eighth person in history to win the aforementioned category for a film with a single nomination. The last person to achieve this feat was Sophia Loren when she won for \"Two Women\" in 1961. Best Actor winner Dustin Hoffman was the fifth person to win the aforementioned category twice. Sigourney Weaver became the fifth performer to receive two acting nominations in the same year but did not win in either category. John Lasseter and William Reeves won Best Animated Short Film for \"Tin Toy\", which was Pixar's first Oscar ever and was the first CGI film to win an Oscar.\n\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface and indicated with double dagger ().\n\nAt the time of the nominations announcement on February 15, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $188 million, with an average of $37.7 million per film. \"Rain Man\" was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees, with $97 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by \"Working Girl\" ($42.1 million), \"The Accidental Tourist\" ($24.2 million), \"Mississippi Burning\" ($18.6 million), and finally \"Dangerous Liaisons\" ($6.69 million).\n\nOf the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 52 nominations went to 13 films. Only \"Big\" (3rd), \"Rain Man\" (5th), \"Working Girl\" (21st), \"The Accused\" (32nd), \"The Accidental Tourist\" (38th), \"Gorillas in the Mist\" (40th), \"Mississippi Burning\" (45th), and \"Tucker: The Man and His Dream\" (50th) were nominated for Best Picture, directing, acting, or screenwriting. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1st), \"Coming to America\" (2nd), \"Die Hard\" (7th), \"Beetlejuice\" (9th), and \"Willow\" (12th).\n\n\n\nThe following 17 films received multiple nominations:\nThe following three films received multiple awards:\n\nNote: \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" received 3 competitive Academy Awards of Merit. In addition, the film received a Special Achievement Award.\nThe following individuals, listed in order of appearance, presented awards or performed musical numbers:\n\nIn an attempt to attract viewers to the telecast and increase interest in the festivities, the Academy hired film producer and veteran Oscar ceremony executive talent coordinator Allan Carr to produce the 1989 ceremony. In interviews with various media outlets, he expressed that it was a dream come true to produce the Oscars.\n\nNotable changes were introduced in the production of the telecast. For the first time, presenters announced each winner with the phrase \"And the Oscar goes to...\" rather than \"And the winner is...\". The green room where Oscar presenters, performers, and winners gathered backstage was transformed into a luxurious suite complete with furniture, pictures, refreshments, and other amenities called \"Club Oscar\". Instead of hiring a host for the proceedings, Carr heavily relied on presenters often grouped in pairs that had some connection, either through family or the film industry (a theme he billed as \"couples, companions, costars, and compadres\"); not until 2019 would another ceremony lack a host.\n\nSeveral other people were involved in the production of the ceremony. Jeff Margolis served as director of the telecast. Lyricist and composer Marvin Hamlisch was hired as musical supervisor of the festivities. Comedian and writer Bruce Vilanch was hired as a writer for the broadcast, a role he has had ever since. Carr had also rounded up eighteen young stars, including Patrick Dempsey, Corey Feldman, Ricki Lake, and Blair Underwood, to perform in a musical number entitled \"I Wanna Be an Oscar Winner\". Unlike in most Oscar ceremonies, however, Carr announced that none of the three songs nominated for Best Original Song would be performed live.\n\nThe telecast was also remembered for being the final public appearance of actress and comedian Lucille Ball, where she and co-presenter Bob Hope were given a standing ovation. On April 26, almost a month after the ceremony, she died from a dissecting aortic aneurysm at age 77.\n\nIn an effort to showcase more glamour and showmanship in the ceremony, producer Carr hired playwright Steve Silver to co-produce an opening number inspired by Silver's long-running musical revue \"Beach Blanket Babylon\". The segment consisted of an elaborate stage show centered on actress Eileen Bowman dressed as Snow White from Disney's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", who comes to Hollywood and is entranced by its glamour. Like \"Beach Blanket Babylon\", the opening act also featured dancers wearing giant, elaborate hats. In a setting designed to resemble the Cocoanut Grove nightclub, Hollywood dignitaries such as actresses Alice Faye, Dorothy Lamour, Cyd Charisse, her husband Tony Martin, as well as Buddy Rogers and Vincent Price were prominently featured, while singer and television producer Merv Griffin sang a rendition of the song \"I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts\" (of which he had had a hit recording in 1949). Bowman and actor Rob Lowe then sang a reworked version of Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Proud Mary\", with lyrics rewritten to refer to the film industry; it is this song for which the act is infamously remembered.\n\nThe show was panned by most of the media publications. \"Los Angeles Times\" television critic Howard Rosenberg lamented, \"the Academy Awards telecast on ABC was surprisingly devoid of magic. It was on the musty side, and compared with last month's Grammycast, absolutely moribund.\" Film critic Janet Maslin chastised the opening number, saying it \"deserves a permanent place in the annals of Oscar embarrassments\". She also bemoaned that the \"I Wanna Be an Oscar Winner\" number \"was confusingly shot and inspired no confidence in Hollywood's future\". Television editor Tony Scott of \"Variety\" complained, \"The 61st Annual Academy Awards extravaganza—seen in 91 different countries including, for the first time, the Soviet Union—turned out to be a TV nyet\" He also observed that the \"Break-Out Superstars number\" looked like they were \"cavorting around a giant Oscar as if it were the golden calf\".\n\nThe telecast also received a mixed reception from professionals within the show business industry. Talent agent Michael Ovitz praised Carr saying that he had \"brought show business back to the movie business\". Actress Jennifer Jones thanked Carr in a written letter to the producer, which read \"You delivered.\" On the other hand, seventeen people, including actors Paul Newman, Gregory Peck, and Julie Andrews, and directors Billy Wilder and Joseph L. Mankiewicz, signed an open letter deriding the telecast as \"an embarrassment to both the Academy and the entire motion picture industry\".\n\nThere has been speculation that some of the blowback against the ceremony, which was the first produced by an openly gay person and which prominently featured a musical number based on a gay nightclub show, was homophobic in nature, although others, such as Bruce Vilanch and David Geffen, have challenged that assessment.\n\nIn addition, The Walt Disney Company filed suit against AMPAS for use of the likeness of Snow White. The lawsuit demanded unspecified damages for \"copyright infringement, unfair competition, and dilution of business reputation\". Academy President Richard Kahn immediately issued an apology to the studio, and the lawsuit was subsequently dropped.\n\nBowman has claimed that she was made to sign a gag order the next day prohibiting her from speaking to the press about her performance for the next 13 years. She finally spoke about it publicly in a 2013 interview, in which she described the performance as looking \"like a gay bar mitzvah\".\n\nDespite the criticism regarding the production of the ceremony, the American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 42.68 million people over its length, which was a 1% increase from the previous year's ceremony. The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony, with 29.81% of households watching over a 50.41 share. It was the highest-rated Oscar broadcast since the 56th ceremony, held in 1984.\n\nNevertheless, AMPAS created an Awards Presentation Review Committee to evaluate and determine why the telecast earned such a negative reaction from the media and the entertainment industry. The committee later determined that Carr's biggest mistake was allowing the questionable opening number to run for 12 minutes. Producer and former Directors Guild of America president Gilbert Cates, who headed the committee, said that Carr would have not received such harsh criticism if the number had been much shorter. Cates was subsequently hired as producer of the succeeding year's telecast.\n\nAccording to various showbiz insiders and reporters, the criticism and backlash from the ceremony resulted in Carr never again producing a film or theatrical show. He died from complications resulting from liver cancer on June 29, 1999, at the age of 62.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was created in 1979 when the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 went into effect under President Jimmy Carter.\n\nAccording to the Office of Personnel Management, the SES was designed to be a corps of executives selected for their leadership qualifications, serving in key positions just below the top Presidential appointees as a link between them and the rest of the Federal (civil service) workforce. SES positions are considered to be above the GS-15 level of the General Schedule, and below Level III of the Executive Schedule. Career members of the SES ranks are eligible for the Presidential Rank Awards program.\n\nUp to 10% of SES positions can be filled as political appointments rather than by career employees. About half of the SES is designated \"Career Reserved\", which can only be filled by career employees. The other half is designated \"General\", which can be filled by either career employees or political appointments as desired by the administration. Due to the 10% limitation, most General positions are still filled by career appointees.\n\nSenior level employees of several agencies are exempt from the SES but have their own senior executive positions; these include the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Transportation Security Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, Government Accountability Office, Members of the Foreign Service, and government corporations.\n\nUnlike the General Schedule (GS) grades, SES pay is determined at agency discretion within certain parameters, and there is no locality pay adjustment.\n\nThe minimum pay level for the SES is set at 120 percent of the basic pay for GS-15 Step 1 employees ($126,148 for 2018). The maximum pay level depends on whether or not the employing agency has a \"certified\" SES performance appraisal system:\n\nTotal aggregate pay is limited to the salary of the Vice President of the United States ($230,700 for 2015).\n\nPrior to 2004, the SES used a six-level system. It was replaced with the current open band system on January 1, 2014.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2319404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319404", "title": "Proof-of-payment", "text": "Proof-of-payment\n\nProof-of-payment (POP) or proof-of-fare (POF) is an honor-based fare collection system used on many public transportation systems. Instead of checking each passenger as they enter a fare control zone, passengers are required to carry a ticket, pass or a transit smartcard to prove that they have paid the valid fare. Fares are enforced via random spot-checks by inspectors such as conductors or enforcement officers, to ensure that passengers have paid their fares and are not committing fare evasion. On many systems, a passenger can purchase a single-use ticket or multi-use pass at any time in advance, but must insert the ticket or pass into a validation machine immediately before use. Validation machines in stations or on board vehicles time stamp the ticket. The ticket is then valid for some period of time after the stamped time.\n\nThis method is implemented when the transit authority believes it will lose less money to the resultant fare evasion than it would cost to install and maintain a more direct collection method. It may be used in systems whose passenger volume and density are not very high most of the time—as passenger volumes increase, more-direct collection methods become more profitable. However, in some countries it is common even on systems with very high passenger volume. Proof-of-payment is usually applied on one-man operated rail and road vehicles as well as on automatically operated rail lines.\n\nThe honor system can be complemented with a more direct collection approach where this would be feasible—a transit authority utilizing POP will usually post fare inspectors, sometimes armed as a police force, to man entrances to stations on a discretionary basis when a high volume of passengers is expected. For example, transit users leaving a stadium immediately following a major concert or sporting event will likely have to buy a ticket from an attendant (or show proof of payment) to gain access to the station serving the stadium. Direct fare collection methods may also be used at major hubs in systems that otherwise use POP. An example of this is the Tower City station on Cleveland's RTA Rapid Transit Red Line, which uses faregates.\n\nTravel without a valid ticket is not usually considered a criminal offense, but a penalty fare or a fine can be charged.\n\nAdvantages of proof-of-payment include lower labor costs for fare collection, simpler station design, easier access for mobility-impaired passengers, easier access for those carrying packages or in case of an emergency, and a more open feel for passengers. On buses, proof-of-payment saves drivers the time needed to collect fares, and makes it possible for all doors to be used for boarding. Validated tickets can double as transfers between lines.\n\nDisadvantages include potentially higher rate of fare evasion, reduced security on station platforms when no barrier is used, increased potential of racial profiling and other unequal enforcement as \"likely fare evaders\" are targeted, and regularly exposing passengers to unpleasant confrontational situations when a rider without the proper proof is detained and removed from the vehicle. Visitors unfamiliar with a system's validation requirements who innocently misunderstand the rules are especially likely to get into trouble.\n\nProof-of-payment is popular in Germany, where it was widely introduced during the labor shortages resulting from the Economic Miracle of the 1960s. It has also been adopted in Eastern Europe and Canada and has made some inroads in newer systems in the United States. The first use of the term \"POP\" or \"Proof of Payment\" on a rail line in North America is believed to have been in Edmonton in 1980. Since then, many new light rail, streetcar, and bus rapid transit systems have adopted the procedure, mainly to speed up boarding by avoiding the hassles of crowding at doors to pay fares at a farebox beside the driver as is common practice on traditional buses. San Francisco's MUNI system became the first North American system-wide adopter of the proof-of-payment system on July 1, 2012 across its buses, light rail and heritage streetcars, with the exception of cable cars, allowing boarding on all the available doors.\n\n"}

During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 22 categories honoring films released in 1987. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Samuel Goldwyn Jr. and directed by Marty Pasetta. Actor Chevy Chase hosted the show for the second consecutive year. Two weeks earlier in a ceremony held at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on March 27, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Shirley Jones.\n\n\"The Last Emperor\" won nine awards including Best Picture and Best Director for Bernardo Bertolucci. For their performances in \"Moonstruck\", Cher and Olympia Dukakis won Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. Michael Douglas won Best Actor for his role in \"Wall Street\"; Sean Connery won Best Supporting Actor for \"The Untouchables\". The telecast garnered 42.2 million viewers in the United States.\n\nThe nominees for the 60th Academy Awards were announced on February 16, 1988, at 5:38 a.m. PST (13:38 UTC) at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Robert Wise, president of the Academy, and actress Shirley MacLaine. \"The Last Emperor\" received the most nominations with nine total; \"Broadcast News\" came in second with seven.\n\nThe winners were announced at the awards ceremony on April 11, 1988. \"The Last Emperor\" became the second film after 1958's \"Gigi\" to earn nine Oscar nominations and win all of them. For the first time in Oscar history, all five Best Director nominees were born outside the United States. Best Actor winner Michael Douglas became the second person to win Oscars for both acting and producing; he previously won a Best Picture award as co-producer of \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\".\n\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger ().\n\nThe award honors \"creative producers whose bodies of work reflect a consistently high quality of motion picture production\".\n\n\nThe following individuals, listed in order of appearance, presented awards or performed musical numbers.\n\nIn view of the 60th anniversary of the Academy Awards, the Academy hired film producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. in October 1987 to oversee the telecast for the second straight year. Three months later, Goldwyn selected actor and comedian Chevy Chase to emcee the 1988 ceremony. In addition, after being held at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for almost two decades, AMPAS decided to move the telecast to the Shrine Auditorium in order to accommodate more rehearsal time and take advantage of the large venue's seating capacity. This marked the first time the facility served as the site for the Oscars since the 20th ceremony held in 1948. Additionally, Goldwyn and Passetta originally planned to feature pre-recorded red carpet arrivals footage of actors who had roles in the 59 previous Best Picture winners. However, the segment was dropped altogether due to traffic problems amongst guests arriving to the ceremony.\n\nFurthermore, the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, which began more than a month before the ceremony, affected the telecast and its surrounding events. Despite the Writers Guild of America refusing to grant a waiver permitting writers to work on the scripted dialogue for the gala, the three head writers for the telecast, Ernest Lehman, Melville Shavelson, and Jack Rose, assured to the Academy and ABC that more than half of the material had already been completed. To compensate for the missing portions of the script, Goldwyn heavily utilized comedians such as John Candy, Billy Crystal, Eddie Murphy, and Robin Williams to ad lib and improvise jokes. During the show, many of the participants expressed support for the writers such as Best Supporting Actor winner Sean Connery who remarked in his acceptance speech, \"If such a thing as a wish accompanied this award mine would be that we ended the writers' strike.\"\n\nAt the time of the nominations announcement on February 16, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $221 million with an average of $48.9 million. \"Fatal Attraction\" was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $142 million in the domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by \"Broadcast News\" ($36.7 million), \"Moonstruck\" ($25.4 million), \"The Last Emperor\" ($11.9 million), and \"Hope and Glory\" ($5.2 million).\n\nOf the 50 highest-grossing movies of the year, 39 nominations went to 17 films on the list. Only \"Fatal Attraction\" (2nd), \"The Untouchables\" (4th), \"Good Morning Vietnam\" (10th), \"Throw Momma from the Train\" (14th), \"Full Metal Jacket\" (21st), \"Broadcast News\" (26th), \"Wall Street\" (30th), and \"Moonstruck\" (39th) were nominated for Best Picture, acting, directing, or screenwriting. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nomination were \"Beverly Hills Cop II\" (1st), \"Lethal Weapon\" (7th), \"The Witches of Eastwick\" (8th), \"Dirty Dancing\" (9th), \"Predator\" (11th), \"RoboCop\" (15th), \"Mannequin\" (23rd), \"The Princess Bride\" (38th), and \"Innerspace\" (45th).\n\nThe telecast received a negative reception from media outlets. \"Los Angeles Times\" television critic Howard Rosenberg commented, \"Monday night's Academy Awards telecast on ABC was the Michael Dukakis and George Bush of TV awards programs: parched, drab and leaden. You kept hoping they'd draft Mario Cuomo.\" Tom Shales from \"The Washington Post\" wrote, \"Of hope there was little and of glory almost none last night at the 60th annual Academy Awards, telecast live from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on ABC. Even considering the low standards set in previous years, the program seemed unusually lackluster from the word go.\" Columnist Matt Roush of \"USA Today\" quipped, \"Chevy Chase stopped the show. Cold. Over and over. As the ever-unctuous host, he tried to get laughs by picking his nose and sneezing into his hand when his ad-libs failed, which was often.\" He also observed that \"The Last Emperor\" domination of the awards created a dull and anticlimactic atmosphere to the proceedings.\n\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 42.2 million people over its length, which was a 13% increase from the previous year's ceremony. An estimated 70 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 29.2% of households watching over a 49 share.\n\nIn July 1988, the ceremony presentation received four nominations at the 40th Primetime Emmys. The following month, the ceremony won one of those nominations for Outstanding Variety Music Events Programming (Samuel Goldwyn, Jr.).\n\n\n\nOfficial websites\n\nAnalysis\n\nOther resources\n"}

Security is achieved by using digital certificates and encryption.\n\nAS2 was created in 2002 by the IETF to replace AS1, which they created in the early 1990s.\n\nThe adoption of AS2 grew rapidly throughout the early 2000s because major players in the retail and fast-moving consumer goods industries championed AS2. Walmart was the first major retailer to require its suppliers to use the AS2 protocol instead of relying on dial-up modems for ordering goods. Amazon, Target, Lowe's, Bed, Bath & Beyond and thousands of others followed suit. Now, many other industries use the AS2 protocol, including healthcare, as AS2 meets legal HIPAA requirements.\n\nIn some cases, AS2 is seen as a way to bypass expensive value-added networks previously used for data interchange.\n\nAS2 is specified in RFC 4130, and is based on HTTP and S/MIME. It was the second AS protocol developed and uses the same signing, encryption and MDN (as defined by RFC3798) conventions used in the original AS1 protocol introduced in the late 1990s by IETF . In other words:\n\nLike any other AS file transfer, AS2 file transfers typically require both sides of the exchange to trade X.509 certificates and specific \"trading partner\" names before any transfers can take place. AS2 trading partner names can usually be any valid phrase.\n\nUnlike AS1 or AS3 file transfers, AS2 file transfers offer several \"MDN return\" options instead of the traditional options of \"yes\" or \"no\". Specifically, the choices are:\n\n\"Return Synchronous MDN via HTTP(S) (\"AS2 Sync\")\" - This popular option allows AS2 MDNs to be returned to AS2 message sender clients over the same HTTP connection they used to send the original message. This \"MDN while you wait\" capability makes \"AS2 Sync\" transfers the fastest of any type of AS file transfer, but it also keeps this flavor of MDN requests from being used with large files (which may time out in low-bandwidth situations).\n\n\"Return Asynchronous MDN via HTTP(S) (a.k.a. \"AS2 Async\")\" - This popular option allows AS2 MDNs to be returned to the AS2 message sender's server later over a different HTTP connection. This flavor of MDN request is usually used if large files are involved or if your trading partner's AS2 server has poor Internet service.\n\n\"Return (Asynchronous) MDN via Email\" - This rarely used option allows AS2 MDNs to be returned to AS2 message senders via email rather than HTTP. Otherwise, it is similar to \"AS2 Async (HTTP)\".\n\n\"Do not return MDN\" - This option works like it does in any other AS protocol: the receiver of an AS2 message with this option set simply does not try to return an MDN to the AS2 message sender.\n\nAS2 filename preservation feature will be used to communicate the filename to the trading partner. The banking industry relies on filenames being communicated between trading partners. AS2 vendors are currently certifying that implementation of filename communication conforms to the standard and is interoperable. \nThere are two profiles for filename preservation being optionally tested under AS2 testing: \n\nFor many businesses, the use of AS2 and electronic data interchange (EDI) is not a choice so much as it is a requirement of doing business with a large customer or partner.

The stems are normally spineless, but some species have spiny leaf sheaths or spines. Those species that have upright trunks grow tall with stems that are in diameter.\n\nThe leaves of all but one species, \"S. smithii\", are pinnately compound.

{"id": "2319437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319437", "title": "General Schedule (US civil service pay scale)", "text": "General Schedule (US civil service pay scale)\n\nThe General Schedule (GS) is the predominant pay scale within the United States civil service. The GS includes the majority of white collar personnel (professional, technical, administrative, and clerical) positions. , 71 percent of federal civilian employees were paid under the GS. The GG pay rates are identical to published GS pay rates.\n\nThe remaining 29 percent were paid under other systems such as the Federal Wage System (WG, for federal blue-collar civilian employees), the Senior Executive Service and the Executive Schedule for high-ranking federal employees, and other unique pay schedules used by some agencies such as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the Foreign Service. , some federal employees were also paid under Pay Bands.\n\nThe GS was enacted into law by the Classification Act of 1949, which replaced Classification Act of 1923. The GS is now codified as part of Chapter 53 of Title 5 of the United States Code sections 5331 to 5338 (). The pay scale was originally created with the purpose of keeping federal salaries in line with equivalent private sector jobs. Although never the intent, the GS pay scale does a good job of ensuring equal pay for equal work by reducing pay gaps between men, women, and minorities, in accordance with another, separate law, the Equal Pay Act of 1963. \n\nPrior to January 1994, GS personnel were generally paid the same amount (for a given grade and step) regardless of where they worked. This system ignored the growing reality of regional differences in salaries and wages across the United States, and this led to a perception that in many locations federal civil service salaries were increasingly uncompetitive with those in the private sector, thus affecting recruiting and retention efforts by federal agencies. In January 1994, the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA) introduced a \"locality pay adjustment\" component to the GS salary structure. Both Republican and Democratic administrations have complained about the methodology used to compute locality adjustments and the projected cost of closing the pay gap (as determined by FEPCA) between federal salaries and those in the private sector. In December 2007, the President's Pay Agent reported that an average locality pay adjustment of 36.89 per cent would be required to reach the target set by FEPCA (to close the computed pay gap between federal and non-federal pay to a disparity of five per cent). By comparison, in calendar year 2007, the average locality pay adjustment actually authorized was 16.88 per cent. As a result, FEPCA has never been fully implemented. \n\nThe United States Office of Personnel Management administers the GS pay schedule on behalf of other federal agencies.\n\nChanges to the GS must normally be authorized by either the president (via Executive Order) or by Congress (via legislation). Normally, the President directs annual across-the-board pay adjustments at the beginning of a calendar year after Congress has passed the annual appropriations legislation for the federal government.\n\nUnder FEPCA, the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts annual surveys of wages and salaries paid to non-federal workers in designated locality pay areas. Surveys are used to determine the disparity, if any, between federal and non-federal pay in a given locality pay area. The Federal Salary Council (created by FEPCA) prepares recommendations concerning the composition of the designated locality pay areas and the annual comparability adjustment for each area, as well as an adjustment for all other workers outside these areas, referred to as \"Rest of U.S.\". The council's recommendations are transmitted to the President's Pay Agent (also created by FEPCA), which then establishes, modifies, or disestablishes individual locality pay areas and makes the final recommendation on pay adjustments to the president, who may either accept the agent's recommendations or (in effect) reject them through the submission of an alternative pay plan.\n\nFEPCA also provides for an automatic annual across-the-board adjustment of GS pay rates. A common misconception is that the annual federal pay adjustments are determined according to cost of living fluctuations and other regional considerations. In fact, the across-the-board adjustments to the GS (but not locality pay) are determined according to the rise in the cost of employment as measured by the Department of Labor's Employment Cost Index, which does not necessarily correlate to the better-known Consumer Price Index, which tracks consumer prices.\n\nThe GS is separated into 15 grades (GS-1, GS-2, etc. up to GS-15); each grade is separated into 10 steps. At one time, there were also three GS \"supergrades\" (GS-16, GS-17 and GS-18); these were eliminated under the provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and replaced by the Senior Executive Service and the more recent Senior Level (non-supervisory) pay scale.\n\nMost positions in the competitive service are paid according to the GS. In addition, many positions in the excepted service use the GS as a basis for setting pay rates. Some positions in the excepted service use the grade designator \"GG\"—for example, \"GG-12\" or \"GG-13\". The GG pay rates are generally identical to published GS pay rates.\n\nThe GS-1 through GS-7 range generally marks entry-level positions, while mid-level positions are in the GS-8 to GS-12 range and top-level positions (senior managers, high-level technical specialists, or physicians) are in the GS-13 to GS-15 range. A new GS employee is normally employed in the first step of their assigned GS grade, although the employer has discretion to, as a recruiting incentive, authorize initial appointment at a higher step (other agencies may place the employee at a higher grade). In most professional occupations, entry to mid-level positions are classified at two-grade intervals—that is, an employee would advance from GS-5 to GS-7, then to GS-9 and finally to GS-11, skipping grades 6, 8 and 10.\n\nPermanent employees below step 10 in their grade normally earn step increases after serving a prescribed period of service in at least a satisfactory manner. The normal progression is 52 weeks (one year) between steps 1–2, 2–3, and 3–4, then 104 weeks (two years) between steps 4–5, 5–6, and 6–7, and finally 156 weeks (three years) between steps 7–8, 8–9, and 9–10. However, an employee can be rewarded for outstanding work performance via a \"quality step increase\" (\"QSI\"), which advances the employee one step within grade regardless of time at the previous step. (When a QSI is awarded, the date of the QSI becomes the starting date for the next step increase, which (if future step increases are awarded on the normal progression) will shorten the overall time for an employee to reach the final step within a grade.)\n\nDepending on the agency and the work description, a GS position may provide for advancement within a \"career ladder,\" meaning that an employee performing satisfactorily will advance between GS grades, normally on an annual basis, until he(she) has reached the top GS grade for that job (which represents full performance). Advancement beyond the top grade (to either a specialized technical position or to a managerial position) would be subject to competitive selection.\n\nNot all positions, however, provide for such a \"career ladder,\" thus requiring employees who seek advancement to consider other career paths, either within their agency or outside it.\n\nAn example is the \"career ladder\" for auditors within the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). The traditional \"entry level\" grade within DCAA is the GS-7 level (some employees come in either at the lower GS-5 level or higher GS-9 or GS-11 levels) and the \"career ladder\" is GS-7 to GS-9 to GS-11 and finally to GS-12, with the employee expected to advance between grades after one year and to reach the GS-12 level after three years. Beyond the GS-12 level, advancements to the higher levels (GS-13, GS-14, and GS-15, most of which are managerial positions) are based on competitive selections.\n\nFurthermore, if an employee is promoted to a grade which is not part of the career ladder (such as a promotion to a supervisory position), the employee's salary is set at the step within the higher grade nearest the employee's current salary (but never below the current salary), plus additional steps to reward the employee for the promotion and to account for the increased responsibilities that go along with the new position. As an example (and not including locality adjustments), an employee at GS-12 Step 10 (base salary $) being promoted to a GS-13 position would initially have his/her salary set at GS-13 Step 4 (base salary $, as it is the nearest salary to GS-12 Step 10 but not lower than it), and then have his/her salary adjusted to a higher step (such as GS-13 Step 6, having a base salary of $).\n\nSalaries under the GS have two components: a base salary and a \"locality pay adjustment\".\n\nThe base salary is based on a table compiled by Office of Personnel Management (the 2020 table is shown below), and is used as the baseline for the locality pay adjustment. The increases between steps for Grades GS-1 and GS-2 varies between the steps; for Grades GS-3 through GS-15 the increases between the steps are the same within the grade, but increase as the grade increases. The table is revised effective January of each year to reflect the basic cost of living adjustment (known as the General Schedule Increase).\n\nSome positions have their own unique GS scales. One notable example being patent examiner positions who can receive a supplement of more than 50% from the standard GS scale. Under the laws governing special GS scales, employees whose positions are covered by those scales earn either the special scale salary, or the standard GS scale salary plus a locality adjustment (see below), whichever is higher.\n\nThe second component of the GS salary, the locality pay adjustment, was introduced in 1994 as part of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA). Prior to FEPCA, all GS employees received the same salary regardless of location, which failed to reflect both the disparity between public sector and private sector pay as well as differences in cost of living in major metropolitan areas. As noted earlier, an employee in a position with a special GS scale does not receive a locality adjustment unless the pay under the special scale is lower than using the locality pay adjustment.\n\nUnder FEPCA, specified metropolitan areas, plus Alaska and Hawaii, are designated to receive pay adjustments in excess of the general adjustment provided to the \"Rest of U.S.\". Salary adjustments in other U.S. Territories and for overseas employees are separate from this adjustment. , 52 areas, plus the entire states of Alaska and Hawaii, have been designated to receive this excess adjustment.\n\nThe total pay with locality is calculated as follows:\n\nFEPCA places a cap on the total salary of highly paid employees (mainly those at the higher GS-15 Grade steps) – the total base pay plus locality adjustment cannot exceed the salary for employees under Level IV of the Executive Schedule.\n\nThe locality pay adjustment is counted as part of the \"high-3\" salary in calculating Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) annuities, as well as the baseline for individuals having a percentage of salary deducted for deposit into the Thrift Savings Plan.\n\nPersonnel based outside the United States (e.g. U.S. territories, foreign overseas areas) receive a lower locality adjustment (4.76 percent for 2010). However, they may also receive certain non-taxable allowances such as cost-of-living allowances, post allowances and housing allowances in accordance with other laws, such as the Foreign Service Act. Federal civilian workers based in CONUS do not normally receive housing allowances or government-furnished housing. Also, some civilian personnel stationed overseas do not receive housing allowances; this may include military dependents working in federal civilian positions overseas, military members that left the service while overseas and were hired into an overseas position, and U.S. citizens hired into overseas positions while traveling abroad.\n\nIn contrast, the tax-free allowances paid during overseas assignments (especially the housing allowances) are generally considered to be an incentive to serve overseas, as they can be quite generous. While this situation may be advantageous to some personnel during their assignment overseas, these tax-free allowances are not considered to be part of one's salary, therefore they are not counted when computing a civil service annuity at retirement. CONUS locality adjustments, however, are counted when computing annuities.\n\nEmployees stationed in Alaska and Hawaii were formerly considered OCONUS and received a cost of living adjustment, but are being phased into the domestic locality pay system.\n\nNOTE:\"Employees of the U.S. Government are not entitled to the foreign earned income exclusion or the foreign housing exclusion/deduction under section 911 because “foreign earned income” does not include amounts paid by the U.S. Government as an employee. But see Other Employment, later\"\n\nProtocol Precedence Lists for civilian and military personnel have been developed by each of the Department of Defense organizations to establish the order of government, military, and civic leaders for diplomatic, ceremonial, and social events. Protocol is a code of established guidelines on proper etiquette. Precedence is defined as priority in place, time, or rank. In the government, military and diplomatic corps, precedence among individuals' positions plays a substantial role. Equivalency between civilian pay grades and military rank is only for protocol purposes and informally for delegated supervisory responsibilities. While the authority of military rank extends across services and within each service, the same does not exist for civilian employees and therefore, there is no equivalency of command or supervisory authority between civilian and military personnel external to the local organization. The \"Department of the Army Protocol Precedence List\" is developed by the Army Protocol Directorate. Another form of the Army \"Precedence List\" can be found in Appendix D of DA PAM 600-60: A Guide to Protocol and Etiquette for Official Entertainment. The Department of the Navy \"Civilian and Military Pay Grades\" list can be found in Annex D of OPNAVINST 1710.7A: Social Usage and Protocol. The Department of the Air Force \"Military and Civilian Rank Equivalents\" can be found in Attachment 10 of AFI 34-1201. Consolidated DOD lists have been compiled by JMAR.\n\nThe comparison of GS and military ranks with respect to financial accounting has different rules than those treating protocol. According to DoD 7000.14-R Financial Management Regulation Volume 11A, Chapter 6 Appendix B (January 2011):\n\nIn recent years, there have been several attempts to eliminate the GS and replace it with various pay systems emphasizing \"pay for performance\" (i.e., a system in which pay increases are awarded based more on merit and work performance and less on seniority and length of service). The pay structure which enables this is typically known as pay banding. The best known efforts in this area are the pay systems created for the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense (the National Security Personnel System) in 2002 and 2003, respectively. These efforts were challenged by federal labor unions and other employee groups. Many supervisory and non-bargaining-unit employees, however, were converted from their GS positions into equitable NSPS positions. As part of his fiscal 2007 and 2008 budget proposals, President George W. Bush proposed the eventual elimination of the GS to be replaced by a pay-for-performance concept throughout the Executive Branch of the government. The Office of Management and Budget prepared draft legislation, known as the \"Working for America Act\", but Congress has not implemented the proposal. President Barack Obama signed the legislation repealing the NSPS system on October 29, 2009. Under the terms of the 2010 Defense Authorization Act, Public Law 111-84, all employees under NSPS must be converted back to their previous pay system not later than January 1, 2012. The law also mandates that no employees lose pay as a result of this conversion. In order to ensure this, a set of conversion rules has been developed. In most cases, if an employee's current NSPS salary falls between two step levels of the GS grade to which their position is classified, their salary will be increased to the higher step. Employees whose salary was increased beyond the GS step 10 amount while under NSPS will be placed on retained pay, meaning they will receive 50% of the annual cost of living increase until the GS table catches up to the level of salary they are earning.\n\n\n\n"}

Morning Musume producer Tsunku said he chose Niigaki because she \"shined during the final studio recording\" for the audition song that all the finalists had to sing. She debuted and lead on the group's 13th single, \"Mr. Moonlight (Ai no Big Band)\" making her one of the few members of Morning Musume who was able to lead on her debut single.

{"id": "2319491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319491", "title": "Unaussprechlichen Kulten", "text": "Unaussprechlichen Kulten\n\nUnaussprechlichen Kulten (also known as Nameless Cults or the Black Book) is a fictional book of arcane literature in the Cthulhu Mythos. The book first appeared in Robert E. Howard's 1931 short stories \"The Children of the Night\" and \"The Black Stone\" as \"Nameless Cults\". Like the \"Necronomicon\", it was later mentioned in several stories by H. P. Lovecraft.\n\nThe name was the result of Lovecraft's efforts to come up with a German translation of \"Nameless Cults\". The title \"Unaussprechlichen Kulten\" is from August Derleth.\n\n\"Unaussprechliche Kulte\" would be the German for \"unspeakable cults\". The form \"Unaussprechlichen Kulten\" is the dative case, suggesting a full title of \"Von unaussprechlichen Kulten\" (\"Of Unspeakable Cults\", as it were \"de cultibus ineffabilibus\") or similar or a dedication (i.e. \"(dedicated) to unspeakable cults\").\n\nSince the German adjective may not only translate to \"unspeakable, unutterable, ineffable\", but also to \"unpronouncable, tongue-twisting\", the title might serve as a description of the names invented by Lovecraft.\n\nThe following is a fictional account of the origin of \"Unaussprechlichen Kulten\" and its significance in the mythos.\n\n\"Unaussprechlichen Kulten\" is believed to have been written by Friedrich Wilhelm von Junzt. The first edition of the German text (referred to by some as \"the Black Book\") appeared in 1839 in Düsseldorf. The English edition was issued by Bridewall in London in 1845, but (being meant to sell purely based on shock-value) contained numerous misprints and was badly translated. A heavily expurgated edition was later issued in New York by Golden Goblin Press in 1909, but sold few copies as its high production costs made it prohibitively expensive. Original editions in German have a heavy leather cover and iron hasps. Few copies of the earliest edition still exist because most were burnt by their owners when word of von Junzt's gruesome demise became common knowledge. An edition is known to be kept in a locked vault at the Miskatonic University library and some book collectors/occult scholars have managed to find copies. At least one copy is known to have been present at the abandoned church on Federal Hill in Lovecraft's short story \"The Haunter of the Dark\".\nThe text contains information on cults that worship pre-human deities such as Ghatanothoa and includes hieroglyphs relating to the latter. There is also information on more recent cults including that of Bran Mak Morn, The Dark Man. It is from this work that the tale of the doomed heretic T'yog is most commonly sourced. The principal obscurity of the book is von Junzt's use of the word \"keys\"—\"a phrase used many times by him, in various relations\"—in connection with certain items and locations, such as the Black Stone and the Temple of the Toad (possibly associated with Tsathoggua) in Honduras.\n\nIn F. Paul Wilson's 1981 novel \"The Keep\", Captain Klaus Woermann reads an excerpt from the \"Unaussprechlichen Kulten\" and finds it a disturbing experience. However, the text does not appear to be the same absolute forerunner of doom as the \"Necronomicon\".\n\n\"Triumff\" by Dan Abnett features a page of the \"Unaussprechlichen Kulten\" shown to the titular hero as a test to see if he has ever studied Goetia. It induces instinctive nausea in those never previously exposed to pure Lore.\n\n\"Von Unaussprechlichen Kulten\" is the title of a song by death metal band Nile from their 2005 album \"Annihilation of the Wicked\". Unaussprechlichen Kulten is also the name of a death metal band from Chile; the lyrics of many of their songs reference the Cthulhu Mythos.\n\nThere is a reference to \"Unaussprechlichen Kulten\" in the 1992 PC game, \"Alone in the Dark\". There is also a reference to the book, along with one to the \"Necronomicon\", in the 2015 video game \"\".\n\n"}

It features Mr. Incredible and Frozone fighting The Underminer's legion of robot minions. The game features cameo appearances by the rest of the Incredibles, though they are not playable characters and don't talk in the game as well. John Ratzenberger reprises his role of the Underminer in the video game, while Craig T. Nelson and Samuel L. Jackson are replaced by Richard McGonagle and Isaac C. Singleton Jr. as Mr. Incredible and Frozone, respectively.\n\nThe game picks up directly where the movie ended, as The Underminer drills out of the ground and declares his intention to rule the world. The Incredibles prepare to battle him when Frozone arrives. Mr. Incredible orders his family to take care of the Underminer's minions while he and Frozone defeat him. The two reach the Underminer's machine, but he quickly escapes underground. Mr. Incredible and Frozone pursue him. The two discover a computer containing the Underminer's plans and learn that he has created the Magnomizer, intending to reverse the position of the earth's crust and fill the sky with extreme pollution to create an artificial underground.\n\nMr. Incredible and Frozone make their way to the Sludge Station, where the Magnomizer is located. After defeating the Magnomizer Guardian, they reach the roof of the Magnomizer and destroy it. As the entire Magnomizer building begins to collapse, Mr. Incredible and Frozone quickly escape through a giant drill, and it falls down a deep pit the machine makes when it falls through the ground. The Underminer, aware that Mr. Incredible and Frozone have destroyed the Magnomizer, activates the Crustodian, his most powerful robot. The Underminer begins his backup plan to create 100 giant Gilgenbots to conquer the world with. Mr. Incredible and Frozone fight their way to the Crustodian, destroying three Gilgenbots in the process. The Crustodian decides to cover up its failure by destroying the other 96 Gilgenbots. After defeating the Crustodian, who escapes, Mr. Incredible and Frozone take an elevator down to an underwater plant that originally supplied power to the Magnomizer, and now powers the Corrupterator, a giant machine meant to help the Underminer further his world-dominating goals.\n\nMr. Incredible and Frozone encounter a friendly robot named Dug who agrees to help them save a group of scientists that are trapped in the Corrupterator. Dug sabotages the Corrupterator and opens an elevator that leads Mr. Incredible and Frozone to the scientists. They rescue the captive scientists and confront the Underminer, but he escapes in the last remaining Gilgenbot. Mr. Incredible and Frozone take an elevator back to the surface on a rainy night, where the Underminer confronts them while piloting a smaller personal battle mech, with help from the Gilgenbot. After a struggle, the heroes finally defeat the Underminer, knocking him into the Gilgenbot and destroying both of them in a massive explosion. No sooner after the Underminer's demise, the rest of the Incredibles arrive to celebrate saving the world once more.\n\nThe game received \"mixed or average reviews\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where Sega ported the game onto the GameCube, Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation 2 on February 9, 2006, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of three sevens and one six for the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions; one seven, one six, and two fives for the DS version; and one six, one five, and two fours for the Game Boy Advance version.\n\n"}

Its campus lies in the Brussels commune of Watermael-Boitsfort, about southeast of the city centre.\n\nThe International School of Brussels opened in October 1951 with four teachers and twenty-seven students between the ages of 5 and 11. It was located in the Brussels commune of Woluwe-Saint-Pierre.\n\nBy the end of the 1953 term the school was home to about one hundred students and had moved to its current location at the Château des Fougères, in the Brussels commune of Watermael-Boitsfort. It also changed its name from the American School of Brussels to the International School of Brussels.\n\nIn its early years, the entire school was housed in the old Château des Fougères. ISB became an International Baccalaureate school on 1 January 1977 making it the 50th IB school worldwide.\n\nIn February 2006 the school board opted to begin fundraising because it determined that the tuition charged to its students was insufficient for its needs.\n\nISB is located on a wooded campus. Green is the predominant colour on campus. All of the buildings use new 'green' technologies, and trees planted by Middle School students dot the grounds. Surrounding the school is managed forest, with entries to the Brussels region's extensive forest trails across the campus.\n\nThe campus includes an outdoor track, a performing arts center, two gymnasiums, and of playing fields and woods are located on the campus.\n\nThe 19th century building called the \"Château\" is the school's administration building. Decorated with pillars, the building houses a reception area that hosts parents of prospective students. It is the first building that visitors see and houses the reception area and administrative offices. The remaining buildings, which include the four schools, the performing arts centre and the gymnasiums are scattered throughout the campus, which also has extensive sports fields, covered play areas and a running track.\n\nMost classes at ISB are housed in one of four main buildings.\n\n\n\nISB offers the four core courses – Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Science. In addition, ISB students take either French, English Language Development, or Study Skills. High School Students at ISB are offered either the International Baccalaureate or a combination of International Baccalaureate certificate courses and ISB courses both of which routes lead to a US High School Diploma accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The most recent reaccreditation occurred in 2010. The school itself offers two tiers of diplomas. Unique among many international schools, ISB also offers a Special Education Diploma. ISB also offers courses in a varied selection of other languages. \n\nA total of 45 IB courses are offered\n\nAs of 2017 it had 1,500 students ranging in age from 2 to 19. The students originate from 65 countries.\n\nAs of 2012 most high school-aged Japanese residents of Brussels attend ISB. The Japanese companies employing the parents of these children subsidize their tuition.\n\nPang Ching-lin (彭靜蓮, Pinyin: \"Péng Jìnglián\"), author of \"Negotiating Identity In Contemporary Japan: The Case of Kikokushijo\", wrote that due to a language barrier and different after-school social life many Japanese students felt isolated from Anglophone student groups such as the Americans and Swedes and often clustered together. Japanese students are enrolled in an English as a second language programme which has a different curriculum than the regular programme. Students who succeed in English ability move on to the regular programme. The Japanese students made their friends within the ESL programme and continued to socialize with these friends even after they graduate to the English-medium courses. Japanese students did participate in after-school activities depending on the gender. Pang wrote that the ESL program for Japanese students \"is often referred to both by school administrators, parents and youngsters as one of the major reasons for the rather insular character of the Japanese in the overall school environment.\"\n\nPang wrote that many Japanese students had difficulties in writing and speaking English, and he added that because they translated their thoughts from Japanese to English, many \"did not succeed in producing an essay in Standard English\". Pang added that there were some Japanese students who had previously lived in English-speaking countries and had gained proficiency or mastery in English.\n\nThe school charges different levels of tuition based on age. As of January 2019 the price for a pre-kindergarten student is €19,710 per year, rising to €38,400 for a student in the High School. As of 2019 its income in the 2017-2018 year was €45,088,195 million.\n\nISB’s athletic program offers more than 50 individual and team sports over a three-season year. These include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, swimming and soccer. ISB is also the only international school in Europe to have American football and lacrosse teams as of 2011. These U12, junior varsity, and varsity sports compete in both the International School Sports Tournament (ISST) and Sports Council of International School (SCIS) Non-competitive and intramural programs are also offered for younger children.\n\nISB has a range of sports facilities. There is an outdoor grass field, and two full-size artificial ones as well as a track for running and field events. There are two indoor tennis courts, two large gymnasiums, and an Outdoor Education Centre.\n\nISBPlus is an extra-curricular programme at ISB that offers students opportunities for extended learning in areas that interest them.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2319526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319526", "title": "Egri Bikavér", "text": "Egri Bikavér\n\nEgri Bikavér (Bull's Blood of Eger) is a red blend produced in Eger. It is very representative of the red wines of Eger, a terroir wine, which carries the flavour of the soils of local production sites, the mezzo-climate unique to the region and the traditions and mores of local residents, from the selection of varieties to choosing the period and method of grape processing and mellowing.\n\nThe exact date of the emergence of Egri Bikavér is unknown. One thing is certain; the word Bikavér (bull's blood) was recorded as early as the beginning of the 19th century. Under the name Bikavér, full-bodied red wines were sold, not only in Eger and Szekszárd but other places as well. Legends grew up around the name, which tied it to the 1552 siege of Eger as related by Gárdonyi Géza.\nIn its present form, also accepted by the public, Egri Bikavér is associated with the name of Grőber Jenő, Eger vigneron. Sugár István (1981) writes: 'I have searched different sources for the composition of grape types constituting bull's blood. The earliest record dates back to 1912, when, in addition to kadarka, I have found blue frank, cabernet and merlot'.\n\nContemporary vignerons and winemakers have been refining the conditions of the production, name, classification and control of this wine for the past two decades. The result of this activity is that Egri Bikavér became the first quality wine in Hungary's history to be produced in a specified region. (Egri Bikavér Regulation of 1997)\n\nAt present, Egri Bikavér is produced in accordance with a regulation designating 3 tiers of quality: classicus, superior and grand superior. The product description contains the rules of yield restriction, fermentation sur marc, aging in barrels and bottles, as well as the marketing and trading of the wines, for the different tiers.\n\nEgri Bikavér is a Kékfrankos-based dry red wine blend, ranging from garnet red to deep ruby, with flavours and aromas presenting rich, spicy and fruity characteristics, without a tannin accent. Aging and fresh fruit aromas are both characteristic of the wine; its complexity is well illustrated by the fact that the characteristic feature of the wine is that no single grape type can dominate the wine in question. Due to the riper, more concentrated grape produce, as well as the extended aging in barrels and bottles, Superior and Grand Superior wines have marked aromas of mellowing, lasting flavours, full body and a long shelf-life with minerality and ideas in harmony with the production areas (sites). The difference between them is usually manifested in the fullness and duration of the aroma.\n\nEgri Bikavér is a blend that has varied over the years, although the blend is anchored by the ancient Kékfrankos variety.\n\nOfficially Egri Bikavér must contain at least three of the following 13 grapes:\n\nBíbor kadarka, Blauburger, Cabernet franc, Cabernet sauvignon, Kadarka, Kékfrankos, Kékoportó, Menoire, Merlot, Pinot noir, Syrah, Turán, Zweigelt\n\nAccording to legend, the name originates from the invasion of Suleiman the Magnificent around 1552.\n\n\"To motivate and support the small group of soldiers during the Siege of Eger castle they were served delicious food and a lot of red wine. Among the Turkish soldiers it was rumored that bull's blood was mixed into the red wine, as otherwise the strength and firm resistance of the town and castle of Eger could not be explained. Finally the enemy gave up.\" \n\nIt has been suggested that the term Bikavér was coined by poet János Garay in 1846.\n\nIn Finland, the wine is colloquially known as Erkin pikakivääri (Erkki's Automatic Rifle).\n\nUnder the Turks, the Hungarians' traditional white grapes were replaced by Kadarka and its relatives. In the 18th century German immigrants brought with them the Blauer Portugieser. Hungary did not escape the effects of the phylloxera epidemic in 1882, after which Kékfrankos and small amounts of the Bordeaux varieties were introduced. At this time the different varieties were often grown together as field blends in the vineyard, and vinified together; towards the end of the 19th century they began to be processed separately into wine and then blended.\n\nUnder Communism, Kadarka was largely replaced by the Bordeaux varieties and in particular the easy-to-grow Zweigelt. This and the industrialisation of production saw Egri Bikavér become a much lighter, simpler wine during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nFollowing the fall of Communism, much Kadarka has been planted and since the mid-1990s there has been a return to a more traditional, much darker style of wine. In order to eliminate some quality problems, a stricter regulation was planned in the mid 90s. The regulation was introduced in 1997, thus Hungary's first Districtus Hungaricus Controllatus - DHC was created (similar to the French Appellation d'Origine Controllée (AOC) or more like the Austrian Districtus Austriae Controllatus (DAC) system), enacting the rule specifying that Egri Bikavér must contain 3 out of 11 traditional grape varieties.\n\nIn 2004 a new level, Egri Bikavér Superior was introduced. In this case, at least 5 out of the 13 recommended varieties must be used and also a lower yield must be applied (maximum 60 hl/ha). It needs to age at least 12 months in wooden cask and 6 months in bottle before releasing on the market. Regulations on the composition of the blend, the wine making technology and minimum alcohol level also differs from normal Egri Bikavér. All those regulations are aiming for an overall higher quality wine.\n\nThe raw materials necessary for the production of this wine can be produced only in the Eger district of the wine region, within that only in blue grape plantations with grape cadastre over 300 points, by abiding by the minimum must level (18-20 M/M) and maximum production quantity (80 q/ha) described in the rules and regulations. The wine, which is to be produced through the proportionate blending of at least four kinds, is to be mellowed in oak barrels and is to be bottled after the first day of November of the year following the harvest, following preliminary classification. After mellowing in bottles for six months, and following yet another classification, the wine can be marketed.\nThe vitality of this wine can already be guessed from its colour. In its warm, spicy fragrance, the different fruits are mixed, which is completed by a harmony nice in flavours, fine structure and round tannins, with a long and playful subsiding.\n\nDespite considerable investment in vineyards and wineries, Egri Bikavér is still quite variable. The difference in quality between good ones and the cheap mass-market versions can be immense. High-quality Egri Bikavér requires two or three years of oak aging, and is best with game, beef, or other spicy food. Egri Bikavér should be served at 15-17 °C. \n\nhttp://egriborvidek.hu/hu/pinceszetek-borozok\n\nEger wine region's website: http://egriborvidek.hu/en/our-wines\n"}

It was released by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalogue numbers BD 6065, IM 1476 and HE 2793.\n<br>\nPeggy Lee included the song on her 1958 album Jump for Joy.<br>\nAn instrumental version was recorded by Bill Haley & His Comets in 1959 and released as a single in 1960; it was the band's final release for Decca Records and was only a minor hit. <br>\nIn 1961, Ray Charles recorded another instrumental version for his album \"The Genius After Hours\". <br>\nThe R&B group the Sensations released an updated rendition in 1961. <br>\nThe song was also covered by the Happenings in the late 1960s. <br>\nMelanie sampled the song in her 1972 hit \"The Nickel Song\", also included on her 1976 album \"Photograph\". <br>\nGuy Mitchell also released a version that can be found on several of his greatest hits albums.\n\nTeresa Brewer recorded several renditions of the song during her career. In addition to the London version, the Coral label made a recording for their catalog, which had a larger orchestral arrangement, faster tempo, and stronger beat. When she moved to the Philips label in 1962, Brewer made a new recording in Nashville. In 1973, she recorded a rendition with a strong rock and roll beat on the Amsterdam label. When Brewer was with the RCA label in 1974–75, she recorded yet another new version. Finally, in 1976 she recorded a disco version for her husband Bob Thiele's Signature imprint. Only the original London release was a national chart hit, although the 1973 version was a regional hit in some markets, including Milwaukee (it charted on Top 40 station WOKY's survey). In 1977, she performed the song on \"The Muppet Show\".\n\nThe lyrics imply that the \"Nickelodeon\" in the song is a device such as a jukebox, that is to say, a coin-operated music making machine of some type. (The rinky-tink piano in the original Teresa Brewer recording suggests a player piano; alternately, there were once coin-operated radios in some public places.) Indeed, \"Nickelodeon\" is usually capitalized in the printed lyrics, as though it were being used as a brand name.\n\nHowever, at the time - before the popularity of the song - \"Nickelodeon\" in fact referred to a five-cent silent movie theater.\n\nThe tune was used in the most famous version of Nestlé Maggi advertisement, especially in India.\n\nThe \"Come closer\" bridge is from Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2.\n\n\n"}

The album was also the last studio appearance of guitarist Rick Hunolt.\n\n\"Tempo of the Damned\" is the first Exodus studio album to accredit founding guitarist Kirk Hammett for a song, (\"Impaler\").\n\nThis album was released two years to the day after the death of former member Paul Baloff.\n\nAlthough he produced the band's 1997 live album \"Another Lesson in Violence\", this album was the first time Andy Sneap had produced, mixed, engineered or mastered an Exodus studio album; he would provide either role on the band's subsequent albums.\n\n\"Tempo of the Damned\" marked their first full-length album of new material since 1992's \"Force of Habit\". This is Exodus' first studio album to feature Jack Gibson on bass. This album is also the result of Steve \"Zetro\" Souza's return to the band, after Exodus reunited with \"Bonded by Blood\"-era lead singer Paul Baloff for the release of their live album \"Another Lesson in Violence\" in 1997. Baloff died of a stroke in 2002 and Souza was invited back into the band, although this would prove to be the last album to feature him until 2014's \"Blood In, Blood Out\", for he abandoned the group during their tour in South America in support of the album, which resulted in a feud between himself and guitarist Gary Holt. \"Tempo of the Damned\" was also the last Exodus album to feature longtime guitarist Rick Hunolt.

The GSCC inherited the mantle of the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work (CCETSW), a previous body which had responsibility solely for managing and funding Social Work education.

{"id": "2319597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319597", "title": "Śāriputra", "text": "Śāriputra\n\nŚāriputra (; Tibetan: ཤཱ་རིའི་བུ་, Pali: \"Sāriputta\", lit. \"the son of Śāri\", born Upatiṣya, Pali: \"Upatissa\") was one of the top disciples of the Buddha. He is considered the first of the Buddha's two chief male disciples, together with Maudgalyāyana (Pali: \"Moggallāna\"). Śāriputra had a key leadership role in the ministry of the Buddha and is considered in many Buddhist schools to have been important in the development of the Buddhist \"Abhidharma\". He frequently appears in Mahayana sutras, and in some sutras, is used as a counterpoint to represent the Hinayana school of Buddhism. \n\nBuddhist texts relate that Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana were childhood friends who became spiritual wanderers in their youth. After having searched for spiritual truth with other contemporary teachers, they came into contact with the teachings of the Buddha and ordained as monks under him, after which the Buddha declared the friends his two chief disciples. Śāriputra was said to have attained enlightenment as an \"arhat\" two weeks after ordaining. As chief disciple Śāriputra assumed a leadership role in the Sangha, doing tasks like looking after monks, assigning them objects of meditation, and clarifying points of doctrine. He was the first disciple the Buddha allowed to ordain other monks. Śāriputra died shortly before the Buddha in his hometown and was cremated. According to Buddhist texts, his relics were then enshrined at Jetavana Monastery. Archaeological findings from the 1800s suggest his relics may have been redistributed across the Indian subcontinent by subsequent kings. \n\nŚāriputra is regarded as an important and wise disciple of the Buddha, particularly in Theravada Buddhism where he is given a status close to a second Buddha. In Buddhist art, he is often depicted alongside the Buddha, usually to his right. Śāriputra was known for his strict adherence to the Buddhist monastic rules, as well as for his wisdom and teaching ability, giving him the title \"General of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: \"Dharmasenāpati\"; Pali: \"Dhammasenāpati\"). Śāriputra is considered the disciple of the Buddha who was foremost in wisdom. His female counterpart was Kṣemā (Pali: \"Khemā\").\n\nAccording to Buddhist texts, when a fully enlightened Buddha appears in the world, he always has a set of chief disciples. For the current Buddha, Gautama, his chief male disciples were Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana, while his chief female disciples were Kṣemā and Utpalavarṇā. According to the \"Buddhavaṃsa\", all Buddhas of the past followed this pattern of selecting two chief male disciples and two chief female disciples. German Buddhist scholar and monk Nyanaponika Thera states that the reason Buddhas always select two chief disciples is to balance responsibilities according to each disciple's specific skills.\n\nAccording to the Pali Canon, in the distant past Śāriputra was born a wealthy \"brahmin\" named Sarada who gave away his wealth to become an ascetic who developed a large following. At that time, Sarada and his followers were visited by the past Buddha, Anomadassī, and were given a sermon given by Anomadassī Buddha's chief disciples. Upon hearing the sermon from Anomadassī Buddha's first chief disciple, Nisabha, Sarada became inspired and resolved to become the first chief disciple of a future Buddha. He then made this wish in front of Anomadassī Buddha, who looked into the future and then declared that his aspiration would come true. Upon hearing the prediction, Sarada went to his close friend Sirivaddhana and asked him to resolve to become the second chief disciple of the same Buddha. Sirivaddhana then made a large offering to Anomadassī Buddha and his following and made the wish as suggested. The two friends then spent the rest of their lives and several future lives doing good deeds. According to Buddhist legend, the aspiration came true in the time of Gautama Buddha with Sarada being reborn as Śāriputra and Sirivaddhana being reborn as Maudgalyāyana.\n\nBuddhist texts describe that Śāriputra was born with the birth name Upatiṣya (Pali: \"Upatissa\") to a wealthy \"brahmin\" family in a village near Rājagaha in the ancient Indian kingdom of Magadha. He is described as having had a \"golden complexion\".\n\nTexts from the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition state he was named after his father, while the Pali commentaries of the Theravada tradition state he was named after his birth village. Upatiṣya had six siblings; three brothers named Upasena, Cunda and Revata, and three sisters named Cāla, Upacālā and Sīsupacālā. Each of his siblings would grow up to become \"arhat\" disciples of the Buddha. According to the Pali tradition, Upatiṣya's father was named Vangunta, while according to Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition his father was named Tiṣya (Pali: \"Tissa\"). Upatiṣya's mother was named Śārī (alternatively called Rūpaśārī, Śārika, or Śāradvatī), because she had eyes like a śārika bird. His mother was the reason Upatiṣya later became known as Śāriputra (son of Śāri) and sometimes Śāradvatīputra (son of Śāradvatī).\n\nUpatiṣya was born the same day as Kolita (who would later be known as Maudgalyāyana), a boy from a neighboring village whose family had been friends with Upatiṣya's family for seven generations, and became friends with him as a child. Upatiṣya and Kolita both became masters of the Vedas through their education and each developed a large following of \"brahmin\" youths. One day the realization that life is impermanent overtook the two friends during a festival in Rājagaha and they developed a sense of spiritual urgency.\n\nRealizing the pointlessness of the impermanent material world, the two friends set out as ascetics to search for an end to rebirth. In Mūlasarvāstivāda texts, the two friends visited all six major teachers of India at the time before realizing none of them had the right path. According to Pali texts, the two friends and their following of \"brahmin\" youths became students under only one of the teachers, the ascetic Sañjaya Vairatiputra (Pali: \"Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta\"), who was staying nearby. Pali texts describe Sañjaya as a teacher in the Indian Sceptic tradition, with Upatiṣya and Kolita eventually becoming dissatisfied with his teachings and leaving. In Mūlasarvāstivāda texts, the Chinese Buddhist Canon and in Tibetan accounts, however, he is depicted as a wise teacher with meditative vision who becomes ill and dies. In some accounts, he predicts the coming of the Buddha through his visions. After being unable to find what they were looking for, the two friends went their separate ways but made a pact that if one was to find the path to Nirvana, he would tell the other.\n\nAfter leaving Sañjaya, Upatiṣya encountered the monk Aśvajit (\"\"), one of the Buddha's first five \"arhat\" disciples. Upatiṣya noticed how serene the monk appeared and approached him to ask for a teaching. Aśvajit said he was still newly ordained but would teach what he can, and proceeded to teach the famous \"Ye Dharma Hetu\" stanza:\n\nThis stanza has become particularly famous in the Buddhist world, having been inscribed onto many Buddhist statues. According to philosopher Paul Carus, the stanza breaks away from the idea of divine intervention prevalent in ancient Brahmanism at the time and instead teaches that the origin and end of all things depends on its causation.\n\nFollowing the teaching, Upatiṣya attained \"sotapanna\", the first stage of enlightenment. Upatiṣya then went to Kolita to tell him about the incident and, after reciting the stanza for him, Kolita also attained \"sotapanna\". The two friends, along with a large chunk of Sañjaya's disciples, then ordained as monks under the Buddha, with everybody in the group becoming \"arhats\" that day except for Upatiṣya and Kolita. Nyanaponika Thera states that the friends required longer preparatory periods before enlightening in order to fulfill their roles as chief disciples. Several texts describe the ordination with miraculous elements, such as the disciples' clothes suddenly being replaced with Buddhist robes and their hair falling out on its own. After ordaining, Upatiṣya started being called Śāriputra (Pali: \"Sāriputta\"), and Kolita started being called Maudgalyāyana (Pali: \"Moggallāna\").\n\nAfter Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana ordained, the Buddha declared them his two chief disciples (Pali: \"aggasavaka\"), following the tradition of appointing a pair of chief disciples as the past Buddhas did, according to Buddhist belief. Since they were newly ordained some of the monks in the assembly felt offended, but the Buddha explained that he gave them the roles because they had made the resolve to become the chief disciples many lifetimes ago. Maudgalyāyana attained \"arhatship\" seven days after ordaining following intense meditation training. Śāriputra attained \"arhatship\" two weeks after ordaining while fanning the Buddha as the Buddha was delivering the \"Vedanāpariggaha Sutta\" to a wandering ascetic. Pali texts state that the ascetic was Śāriputra's nephew but Chinese, Tibetan and Sanskrit texts state he was Śāriputra's uncle. According to commentaries such as the \"Atthakatha\", Śāriputra took longer to achieve enlightenment than Maudgalyāyana because his knowledge had to be more thorough as first chief disciple, and thus required more preparation time.\n\nŚāriputra is considered to have been the Buddha's first chief disciple, foremost in wisdom, a title he shared with the nun Kṣemā (Pali: \"Khemā\"). He shared the title of chief male disciple with Maudgalyāyana, together described in the \"Mahāpadāna Sutta,\" as \"the chief pair of disciples, the excellent pair\" (Pali: \"sāvakayugaṁ aggaṁ bhaddayugaṁ\"). In the \"Mahavagga\", the Buddha declared his two chief male disciples as being foremost in wisdom and foremost in psychic powers, referencing Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana respectively. Buddhist tradition maintains that the first chief disciple, Śāriputra, customarily sat to the Buddha's right hand side, while the second chief disciple, Maudgalyāyana, sat to the left. The disciples have thus been stylized as the right hand and left hand disciples of the Buddha in Buddhist tradition and art accordingly. Texts describe that none of the Buddha's other disciples could answer questions that Maudgalyāyana was able to answer while Maudgalyāyana was unable to answer questions Śāriputra was able to answer. As the first chief disciple, Śāriputra's role was the systematization and analysis of the Buddha's teachings. The Buddhist canon often shows Śāriputra asking the Buddha questions and entreating the Buddha to teach, as well as himself clarifying points and questioning disciples, in some cases seemingly to test the knowledge of fellow disciples. The Buddha would often suggest a topic and have Śāriputra elaborate and deliver a sermon on it. In two discourses recorded in the Tripitaka, the \"Dasuttara Sutta\" and the \"Saṅgīti Sutta\", the Buddha declared he needed to rest his back, and had Śāriputra teach in his place while the Buddha listened in the audience. His ability to teach the Dharma earned him the title of \"General of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: \"Dharmasenapati\"). Buddhist texts indicate that Śāriputra still had some flaws, however. In the \"Catuma Sutta\", when a group of young monks made noise and were ordered by the Buddha to leave, the Buddha reprimanded Śāriputra for not concluding that it was the chief disciples' responsibility to look after the monks, something Maudgalyāyana was able to conclude. On another occasion the Buddha reprimanded Śāriputra for teaching the dying \"brahmin\", Dhanañjani, in a way that led him to rebirth in the Brahma realm rather than teaching in a way that led to enlightenment.\n\nAs chief disciple, Śāriputra assumed a leadership role in the Buddha's monastic community, or Sangha. Buddhist texts describe that Śāriputra routinely took charge of monastic affairs usually handled by the Buddha himself, such as attending to sick monks or visiting lay followers before their deaths. In one instance, when a group of monks planned to travel elsewhere, the Buddha told them to ask Śāriputra for permission first. Śāriputra was the first disciple of the Buddha who was asked to ordain monks in his place, with the Buddha giving him the ordination procedure. He was also entrusted to ordain the Buddha's son Rahula. When Śāriputra trained pupils, he gave them material and spiritual help, and assigned them an object of meditation. In the \"Saccavibhanga Sutta\", the Buddha compared Śāriputra to a mother who gives birth to a child while comparing Maudgalyāyana to a nurse who raises a child. Śāriputra would train students to \"sotapanna\", the first stage of enlightenment, and Maudgalyāyana would train students to \"arhatship\", the highest stage of enlightenment. However, Nyanaponika Thera notes that there are several individual cases where Śāriputra guided monks to the higher stages of enlightenment as well.\n\nBuddhist texts portray Śāriputra as someone who took an active role in debating and converting heretics, considered to have been one of his great prerogatives. In the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, when the six heretical teachers of the time challenged the Buddhists to a contest, the Buddha had Śāriputra contend against them. Mūlasarvāstivāda texts state that Śāriputra used psychic powers to create a huge storm and transform himself into various forms, subduing the rival teachers and converting the residents of Savatthi. When the monk Devadatta created a schism in the Buddha's monastic community and led some of the Buddha's disciples away, Śāriputra played a key role in restoring the community. According to texts, upon hearing about the schism, Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana pretended to join Devadatta's community. After the chief disciples joined, Devadatta claimed to have had a backache and had Śāriputra preach in his place, but Devadatta fell asleep and Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana used the opportunity to get the following to return to the Buddha.\n\nBuddhist texts generally credit the establishment of the monastic rules to Śāriputra, with Śāriputra being the one to ask the Buddha to create the rules. When Śāriputra asked the Buddha, he said he would lay them down at the right time. Śāriputra was known for his conscientiousness and meticulous adherence to monastic rules. In one story, Śāriputra became ill with an ailment that could be treated with garlic, but refused it because the Buddha had previously laid down a rule forbidding monks to eat garlic, with Śāriputra only taking it after the Buddha rescinded the rule. In another story, Śāriputra found that meal cakes tended to make him greedy and then made a vow to abstain from them. A Buddhist commentary describes that one time when the other monks had left to collect alms, Śāriputra meticulously cleaned and organized the monastery to keep heretics from criticizing the disciples. Several Buddhist texts relate that Śāriputra was reborn as a snake in a previous life and that this was the reason for some of his stubbornness. In a Mahāsāṃghika text the Buddha punished Śāriputra by making him stand in the sun for failing to prevent some monks from making incorrect remarks. When the other monks later asked the Buddha to stop the punishment, the Buddha said that Śāriputra's decision to receive the punishment could not be changed, just as he was unwilling to change his mind when he was a snake. In a Mahīśāsaka text, Śāriputra refused to take a type of fruit, even when prescribed as medicine, after another monk suspected him of sneaking delicious food, the Buddha likewise references Śāriputra's life as a snake to explain his stubbornness.\n\nAlthough Maudgalyāyana is described as having been foremost in psychic powers, Buddhist texts state that Śāriputra also exhibited such powers himself. In various texts, Śāriputra is reported to have exhibited several psychic abilities such as levitation and the ability to visit other realms of existence, as well as abilities common among \"arhats\" such as recalling past lives and clairvoyance. In one story, a \"yaksha\", or spirit, hit Śāriputra in the head while he was meditating. When Maudgalyāyana saw the incident and came to ask Śāriputra if he was okay, Śāriputra stated he didn't even notice the blow and suffered only a minor headache. Maudgalyāyana then praised Śāriputra for his psychic abilities by being able to sustain a blow with little notice, described in the \"Patisambhidamagga\" text as an example of “the power of intervention by concentration” (Pali: \"samādhivipphāra-iddhi\"). In Mūlasarvāstivāda texts, Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana descended to hell to give Devadatta the prophecy that he will become a \"pratyekabuddha\" in the future. During the visit, it is said that Maudgalyāyana attempted to relieve the suffering of those in hell by creating rain but the rain dispersed. After Śāriputra saw this, he created a rain that did relieve the suffering of those in hell, using a wisdom based meditation. In another Mūlasarvāstivāda text, the Buddha sent Maudgalyāyana to retrieve Śāriputra, who was doing sewing work. When Śāriputra stated he would go after his sewing work was complete, Maudgalyāyana attempted to force him to come by using his psychic powers to shake the ground but Śāriputra was unaffected. When Śāriputra told him to return first, Maudgalyāyana went back to the Buddha and found that Śāriputra had already arrived. When Maudgalyāyana saw this, he stated that the power of psychic abilities was no match for the power of wisdom.\n\nBuddhist texts all state that Śāriputra died shortly before the Buddha, with texts generally indicating he died in his hometown. According to Pāli commentaries, Śāriputra arose from meditation one day and realized through his meditative insight that the chief disciples were supposed to achieve \"parinirvana\" before the Buddha, and that he had seven more days to live. Śāriputra then traveled to his hometown to teach his mother, who was yet to be converted to Buddhism. After he converted his mother, Śāriputra died peacefully on the full moon day of Kartika a few months before the Buddha. According to Mūlasarvāstivāda texts, however, it is said that Śāriputra achieved \"paranirvana\" voluntarily because he didn't want to witness the Buddha's death, in some accounts he was also motivated by Maudgalyāyana intending to achieve \"paranirvana\" after being beaten and mortally injured by a rival religious group. In the Sarvāstivāda account, Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana both achieved \"paranirvana\" voluntarily on the same day, because they didn't want to witness the Buddha's death. In several versions of the story, various heavenly beings from Buddhist cosmology are said to have come to pay respect to Śāriputra near his time of death. \n\nA funeral was held for Śāriputra in the city of Rajgir where his remains were cremated. His relics were then brought by Śāriputra's assistant, Cunda, to the Buddha in Śrāvastī. In the \"Anupada Sutta\", the Buddha gave a eulogy of Śāriputra, praising his intellect and virtue. According to a \"Dighanikaya\" commentary, the Buddha enshrined Śāriputra's relics in a \"cetiya\" at Jetavana. In Mūlasarvāstivāda texts, the relics were given to the lay disciple, Anathapindika, and it is him who builds a \"stupa\" and enshrines the relics at Jetavana.\n\nŚāriputra is said to have played a key role in the development of the \"Abhidharma\" texts of the Buddhist Tripitaka. Buddhist scholar monks Rewata Dhamma and Bhikkhu Bodhi describe the \"Abhidharma\" as \"an abstract and highly technical systemization of the doctrine\". According to Theravada tradition, the \"Abhidharma\", or \"Higher Dharma\", is said to have been preached by the Buddha to \"devas\" while he was spending the rainy season in \"Tavatimsa\" Heaven. It is said that the Buddha returned to earth daily to give a summary to Śāriputra, who classified and reordered the teachings and relayed it to his disciples, in what would become the \"Abhidharma Pitaka\". Various sets of the Sarvastivada school of Buddhism, however, attribute each of the seven books of the \"Abhidharma\" to different authors, with Śāriputra being attributed as the author of just the \"Sangitiparyaya\" in the Chinese Sarvastivada tradition and as the author of the \"Dharmaskandha\" in the Sanskrit and Tibetan Sarvastivada traditions. In the Vatsiputriya tradition, a subset of the Sarvastivada school, Śāriputra is said to have transmitted the \"Abhidharma\" to Rahula, who later transmitted it to the school's founder, Vatsiputra. As the author of the \"Abhidharma\" in Buddhist tradition, Śāriputra is considered to be the patron saint of the Abhidharmists.\n\nFrench religion writer André Migot, argues that the \"Abhidharma\" was formulated no earlier than the time of Emperor Asoka, and thus cannot really be attributed to the historic Śāriputra, at least not the version known by modern scholars. English historian Edward J. Thomas dates the development of the \"Abhidharma\" as being sometime between the third century BCE and the first century CE. However, Migot states that a simpler version of the \"Abhidharma\" likely existed in early Buddhism, before it evolved and was written down in its current form. Migot points to the mention of the \"\"Matrka\" Pitaka\" in Cullavagga texts as the precursor to the \"Abhidharma Pitaka\". Migot argues that the \"Matrka Pitaka\", recited by Mahākāśyapa at the First Buddhist Council according to \"Ashokavadana\" texts, likely began as a condensed version of Buddhist doctrine that developed over time with metaphysical aspects to become the \"Abhidharma\". Thomas also states that the \"Abhidharma\" had earlier roots and was developed based on existing material, likely a method of discussing the principles of the Buddha's teachings. According to Thomas, different Buddhist schools compiled their own \"Abhidharma\" works separately, but based it on common existing material. \nŚāriputra frequently appears in Mahayana sutras, often asking the Buddha to teach or engaging in the dialogue himself. Migot states that it is significant that Śāriputra has a continuity in Mahayana texts, as most of the Buddha's great disciples are usually absent from Mahayana literature. Migot credits the importance of Śāriputra in the early Vatsiputriya Buddhist school with why Śāriputra often appeared in Mahayana texts. While depictions of Śāriputra in the Pāli Canon generally portray him as a wise and powerful \"arhat\", second only to the Buddha, Mahayana texts give him a wider range of depictions. Some Mahayana sutras portray him as a great Buddhist disciple while others portray him as a counterpoint with insufficient understanding of Mahayana doctrine, representative of the Hinayana tradition. Buddhist studies scholar Donald S. Lopez Jr. describes the latter as \"intentional irony\" aimed at depicting how profound Mahayana doctrine is by showing that even the wisest \"Hinayana\" disciple had difficulty understanding it. \n\nIn the \"Vimalakīrti Sūtra\", Śāriputra is depicted as being unable to grasp Mahayana doctrines such as non-duality and emptiness. In the sutra, a goddess listening to Vimalakīrti scatters flowers which fall onto Śāriputra's robes. Not wanting to break the monastic rules, which forbid decorating oneself with flowers, he tries to remove them but is unable to. The goddess then accuses Śāriputra of being attached to the duality of what is proper and improper. Later in the sutra, Śāriputra asks that if the goddess is so spiritually advanced, why doesn't she transform out of her female state, indicative of cultural sexism. The goddess responds by using her powers to switch bodies with Śāriputra to demonstrate that male and female is just an illusion because, according to Mahayana doctrine, all things are empty and so male and female don't really exist.\n\nIn \"prajñāpāramitā\" sutras Śāriputra is often depicted as the counterpoint to the true meaning of \"prajñāpāramitā\". In the \"Astasahasrika Prajñāpāramitā Sutra\", Śāriputra is portrayed as being unable to understand the ultimate meaning of \"prajñāpāramitā\" and instead must be instructed by the disciple Subhūti. According to Buddhist scholar Edward Conze, the sutra depicts Śāriputra as being preoccupied with dualities, making him unable to grasp the true meaning of \"prajnaparamita\". In the \"Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra\", Śāriputra is one of the principal interlocutors, asking questions and being instructed. Conze states that Śāriputra has to be instructed in this sutra because, despite his great wisdom, \"prajnaparamita\" doctrine was too advanced for his comprehension. The \"Da zhidu lun\" commentary to the sutra describes Śāriputra as someone who pursued the \"bodhisattva\" path in a past life but gave up and turned to the \"Śrāvaka\" path after donating his eye to a beggar who threw the eye on the ground. \n\nReligious studies scholar Douglas Osto argues that Śāriputra is portrayed as such in \"Prajñāpāramitā sutras\" due to his association with the \"Abhidharma\", which teaches that \"dharmas\" are the final reality. This is in contrast to the core teachings of \"Prajñāpāramitā sutras\", which teach that all \"dharmas\" are empty, thus making Śāriputra the ideal counterpoint. \n\nŚāriputra plays a major role in the \"Heart Sutra\", where the teaching is directed at him. Śāriputra prompts the teaching of the sutra by asking the Mahayana \"bodhisattva\" Avalokiteśvara how to practice wisdom. Avalokiteśvara's response to Śāriputra, then makes up the body of the sutra. When Avalokiteśvara finishes the sutra the Buddha shows approval of the teaching, and Śāriputra, Avalokiteśvara, and the audience then rejoice. In the \"Lotus Sutra\", the Buddha starts talking about the higher wisdom of buddhas and his use of skillful means (Sanskrit: \"upāya\") to teach the Dharma, which leaves the \"arhats\" in the assembly confused. Śāriputra then asks the Buddha to explain his teachings for the benefit of other beings, prompting the Buddha to teach the \"Lotus Sutra\". Later in the sutra, the Buddha explains that Śāriputra had followed the \"bodhisattva\" path in past lives but had forgotten and followed the \"Śrāvaka\" path in this life. The Buddha then assures Śāriputra that he will also achieve buddhahood and declares that Śāriputra will become the future Buddha Padmaprabha. In the listing of the great \"arhats\" in the assembly at the beginning of the \"Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra\", Śāriputra is mentioned as the fifteenth of the great \"arhats\", while in the \"Shorter Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra\" he is placed as the first. \n\nAccording to accounts from the 7th century Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, Śāriputra's as well as Maudgalyāyana's relics could be found in the Indian city of Mathura in \"stupas\" built by King Asoka. However, as of 1999, no archaeological reports had confirmed such findings at the sites mentioned by either Chinese pilgrims or Buddhist texts, although findings were made at other sites. \n\nIn 1851, archaeologists Alexander Cunningham and Lieutenant Fred. C. Maisey discovered a pair of sandstone boxes with encased bone fragments inside during an excavation of one of the \"stupas\" in the city of Sanchi, with Śāriputra's and Maudgalyāyana's names inscribed on them in Brāhmī text. Śāriputra's casket contained pieces of sandalwood, which Cunningham believed was part of Śāriputra's funeral pyre. Śāriputra's box was positioned at the south, while Maudgalyāyana's was positioned at the north. According to Cunningham, people in ancient India sat facing the east during religious ceremonies and even used the word east (\"para\") for \"front\", as well as the word south (\"dakshina\") for \"right\" and the word north (\"vami\") for \"left\", meaning the positioning of the caskets symbolized each disciple's relative positions as right and left hand disciple respectively. This positioning has also been explained by the fact that the Buddha traditionally sat facing the east, which would make the south his right hand side, and the north his left hand side. Another excavation by Cunningham and Maisey at \"stupas\" in the nearby town of Satdhāra found another pair of caskets with encased bone fragments with the two chief disciples' names inscribed. Cunningham concluded that the relics were enshrined in \"stupas\" near Rajagaha after the disciples' deaths until the time of King Asoka, who then redistributed them in \"stupas\" throughout India. Scholars have also theorized that a Sunga king may have also have done a similar redistribution of the relics of the Buddha and his leading disciples and built \"stupas\" such as the one in Sanchi to enshrine them.\n\nCunningham and Maisey later divided their findings among each other, with Maisey bringing the Satdhāra relics to Britain and eventually loaning them to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 1866. The relics were eventually purchased by the Museum in 1921 from Maisley's son. Cunningham brought his findings to Britain on two ships, one of which sank, thus the Sanchi relics are believed to have been lost. However, historian Torkel Brekke argues that Maisey took all the relics with him, and thus the Sanchi relics went to Britian along with the Satdhāra ones. In the early 20th century, Buddhist organizations in India and Burma began pressuring the British government to return the relics to India, where they can be properly venerated. Although the Victoria and Albert Museum initially resisted, the British government eventually ordered them to return the relics for diplomatic reasons. The relics were transferred to predominantly Buddhist Sri Lanka in 1947 in accordance with an agreement made with Buddhist organizations, where they were put on temporary display at the Colombo Museum. In 1949, the relics were sent to India where they were put on tour around northern India and various parts of Asia. In 1950, the relics were sent on tour to Burma, with Burmese Prime Minister U Nu later asking India for a portion of the relics. Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to make a \"permanent loan\" of a portion of the relics to Burma where they were enshrined in the Kaba Aye Pagoda in 1952. Sri Lanka also obtained a portion of the relics, which were brought from Sanchi in 1952 and kept at the Maha Bodhi Society in Sri Lanka. The portion of the relics that remained in India were enshrined at the Chethiyagiri Vihara in Sanchi, also in 1952. \n\nAs the chief disciple of the Buddha, Śāriputra is considered to be a particularly important figure in Buddhism, especially in the Theravada tradition. According to Buddhist academic Reginald Ray, Śāriputra was the greatest \"arhat\" in the Pali Canon and is ranked in the canon as being close to a second Buddha. In one text, he is referred to as \"King of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: \"Dharmaraja\") a title generally reserved for the Buddha, and is described in several texts as one who \"spins the wheel of the Dharma\", a prerogative generally associated with Buddhas. In the Pali Canon, Śāriputra is credited as the main expounder of several \"suttas\", due to the Buddha trusting in his profound teaching ability. Indologist Alex Wayman describes Śāriputra as being exemplary of the four \"brahma-vihārās\", and credits these virtues with why the Buddha entrusted him with leadership of the Sangha.\n\nIn Buddhist art, he is often depicted alongside the Buddha and Maudgalyāyana, with Śāriputra usually depicted on the Buddha's right hand side and Maudgalyāyana usually depicted on the Buddha's left hand side. According to Nyanaponika Thera, this imagery symbolizes the relative positions they held in life, with Śāriputra being the Buddha's right hand monk. In Mahayana Buddhism this iconography of flanking the Buddha on his right and left is sometimes used for other figures as well, such as the Mahayana \"bodhisattvas\" Samantabhadra and Mañjuśrī, or the disciples Ānanda and Mahākāśyapa. In Burma, Śāriputra is believed to grant wisdom to worshippers, and is one of eight \"arhats\" commonly shown devotion to in protective rituals.\n\nŚāriputra is notable for being representative of scholarship and settled monasticism, rather than the forest Buddhism that most of the Buddha's principal disciples are associated with. Ray describes Śāriputra as the \"prototypical\" Buddhist saint who embodied the ideal of the Southern Buddhism that developed in ancient Kosambi. However, Ray points out that some Pali texts, such as the \"Udana\" and \"Theragatha\", portray Śāriputra as a forest saint. He concludes that there are at least two traditions linked to him in Pali texts, forest and scholarly. Migot identifies texts that exclude Śāriputra's scholastic character as the earliest sources, and goes on to argue that the historic Śāriputra was different than the person preserved in the Pali Canon. He argues that Śāriputra was venerated as a saint in the ancient Kosambi region and that the early Sthavira school of Buddhism developed his scholarly side in accordance to the tradition's values in the region at the time, indicating that Śāriputra may originally have been a forest saint. According to Ray, it is possible Śāriputra's scholastic character was the result of texts that were added later, but states there is insufficient evidence to conclude to this.\n\n\n"}

His work has been honoured with numerous Eisner, Harvey, and Joe Shuster Awards.\n\nDarwyn Cooke was born in Toronto on November 16, 1962. Cooke's father was a construction worker and later ran a union. Darwyn and his brother Dennis grew up in Etobicoke.\n\nCooke's interest in creating comics began after watching \"Batman\" starring Adam West. Cooke's grandmother saved some of his earliest drawings, at 5 years old, of Batman and Robin in crayon on construction paper, with Cooke keeping them after her death. He discovered comics as a child, but did not become passionate about them until he was a teenager.\n\nCooke's desire to be an artist crystallized at 13 years old after reading a reprint of \"Spectacular Spider-Man\" #2, with Cooke purchasing markers and boards the day after reading the comic and attempting to copy John Romita's artwork. The following week, Cooke purchased \"Detective Comics\" #439, featuring the story \"Night of the Stalker,\" and had found his calling. Cooke also recalled tracing panels of Will Eisner's \"The Spirit\" as a teenager. He attributed the ability to develop his own style as a byproduct of limited entertainment choices, allowing him to focus on deconstructing the comics that inspired him. His father, however, did not think that comics were a good avenue for a career.\n\nCooke attended George Brown College, but was expelled after a year.\n\nIn 1985, Cooke left his family on his own for the first time in order to show his samples at DC Comics' New York City offices. The trip resulted in his first published comic book work as a professional artist in a five-page crime story in DC Comics' \"New Talent Showcase\" #19, which was coincidentally edited by \"Night of the Stalker\" artist Sal Amendola. Economic pressure, however, made Cooke leave comics, as he was only paid $35 per page and produced one page a week. Deciding that comics was not an economically feasible job, Cooke worked in Canada as a magazine art director, graphic and product designer for the next 15 years. He eventually established his own design studio.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Cooke decided to return to comics, but found little interest for his work at the major publishers. Eventually, he was hired by Warner Bros. Animation after replying to an ad for storyboard artists in \"The Comics Journal\" placed by animator Bruce Timm, with Cooke shocked that there were positions available. His successful pitch included 14 pages that eventually would be published in 2000 as \"Batman: Ego\".\n\nOriginally freelancing from Toronto, Cooke met his animation colleagues at San Diego Comic-Con and was approached about moving to Los Angeles full-time. Despite no desire to live in Los Angeles, Cooke moved there to take advantage of \"an opportunity to be a part of something that was never going to come around again this way,\" the ability to associate with creators such as Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, Alan Burnett, and Eric Radomski. Cooke worked as a storyboard artist for four episodes of \"The New Batman Adventures\" as well as a handful of episodes of \"\".\n\nIn 1999, he designed and animated the opening sequence for \"Batman Beyond\". In contrast to most cartoon openings—which adapt music to a finalized group of shots—\"Batman Beyond\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s visuals were specifically cut to suit the music, after Cooke's successful pitch of the concept to Bruce Timm. Surprisingly, Cooke employed his personal Macintosh computer in his spare bedroom and Adobe After Effects for most of the animation, as opposed to Warner Bros.' resources. According to Cooke, the \"Batman Beyond\" team created a strong show in light of what he considered \"kind of a disheartening mandate from the network,\" which wanted a show about the Batman of the future. He believed the WB Network ultimately disliked the show's level of violence and prematurely ended the show once it could be syndicated. Cooke then worked as a director for Sony Animation's \"\" for a year.\n\nIn April 2014, Cooke released a \"Batman Beyond\" animated short celebrating the 75th anniversary of Batman.\n\nIn July 2006, it was announced that Warner Bros. Animation and DC Comics would release a series of direct-to-DVD DC Universe Animated Original Movies based on important DC comic books. Due to the adamance of DC's then-Senior Vice-President of Creative Affairs Gregory Noveck, the second film to be adapted was Cooke's \"\", produced by Bruce Timm.\n\nDue to Cooke's obligations on \"The Spirit\", Stan Berkowitz wrote the film, while Cooke storyboarded ten percent of the film, rewrote and polished dialogue, as well as provided art direction and most of the character design. Cooke praised both Berkowitz and Timm for their ability to preserve many important character moments within the necessary shortening of the story to accommodate the film's runtime, shifting the movie's focus specifically to the Justice League characters. During the scripting process, Cooke intervened to preserve both Wonder Woman and Lois Lane's places in the film, which had originally been eliminated due to time constraints. Without them, Cooke joked that \"We might as well just rename this 'White Guys in the '50s,' because everything else is gone,\" describing the women as \"the heart of the story.\"\n\nCooke also admitted fearing for the film's outcome until he learned that his former Warner colleague David Bullock would be directing it, praising Bullock as \"probably the only person in the world I would have picked ahead of myself to direct it.\" He also credited his strong previous relationships at Warner Bros. with his comfort on the project.\n\nIn the late 1990s, DC Comics art director Mark Chiarello discovered Cooke's years-old proposal for a Batman story while throwing out old pitches, and hired Cooke for what became the 2000 graphic novel \"Batman: Ego\", marking Cooke's permanent move from animation to comics at 37 years old. Described by Cooke as \"What if Batman and Bruce Wayne were able to sit down and talk about what it is they do?\", the internal dialogue of \"Batman: Ego\" between Bruce Wayne and Batman was inspired by the 1981 film \"My Dinner with Andre\".\n\nIn 2001, Cooke and writer Ed Brubaker revamped the Catwoman character. They started with a four-issue serial \"Trail of the Catwoman\" in \"Detective Comics\" #759–762 in which private detective Slam Bradley attempts to investigate the death of Selina Kyle (a.k.a. Catwoman). According to Cooke, he and Brubaker bonded over the re-introduction of Bradley, who first appeared in 1937's \"Detective Comics\" #1 and pre-dated the super-hero era of comics. The story led into a new \"Catwoman\" title in late 2001 by Brubaker and Cooke, in which the character's costume, supporting cast, and modus operandi were all redesigned and redeveloped. Cooke would stay on the series until issue #4. In 2002, he would write and draw the \"Selina's Big Score\" prequel which detailed what had happened to the character directly before her new series. Cooke regarded \"Selina's Big Score\" as the \"single thing I did that I liked the most.\" While developing \"\", Cooke also drew a short Catwoman back-up story within 2002's \"Just Imagine Stan Lee with Chris Bachalo creating Catwoman\". An untold story concept Cooke held onto involved the return and revenge of Catwoman's betrayed ex-lover Stark in a similar manner to the lead character of the film \"Point Blank\".\n\nCooke's next project was 2004's \"DC: The New Frontier\", a six-issue miniseries which bridged the gap between the end of the golden and the start of the silver age of comic books in the DC Universe. Cooke began brainstorming \"The New Frontier\" after completing \"Batman: Ego\" and being steered by Mark Chiarello to do a Justice League story. Preferring not to write a story tied to modern continuity or with short-term consequences, Cooke quickly realized he had little interest in writing about the Justice League unless the focus was on \"who they were before they became the Justice League.\"\n\nThe story, set in the 1950s, featured dozens of super-heroes and drew inspiration from the period's comic books and movies as well as Tom Wolfe's non-fiction account of the start of the U.S. space program \"The Right Stuff\" and the novels of James Ellroy due to Ellroy's skill in weaving fictional characters into real history. The major DC characters are introduced in \"The New Frontier\" in the same order that DC originally published them, even down to the correct month and year in the story's timeline. For the book's visual style, Cooke was inspired by 1950s advertising along with the works of Marvel Comics' Jack Kirby and Hanna-Barbera's Alex Toth.\n\nAs Cooke formulated \"The New Frontier\", DC's editorial board pushed major changes from Cooke's original concept including accommodations for DC Comics' present-day continuity; the mandated changes were undone by Paul Levitz, who allowed Cooke to preserve his original intent both by setting the story out of continuity as well as offering Cooke an advance payment on his work. Cooke subsequently worked on \"Catwoman\" and \"Selina's Big Score\" before returning to work on \"The New Frontier\".\n\nCooke employed non-linear narrative that increasingly tied together toward the conclusion, likening the approach to films like \"Memento\", \"Pulp Fiction\", and \"The Limey\".\n\nCooke placed a significant focus on Green Lantern Hal Jordan, intending to illustrate \"why the character was cool\" in light of the character's dramatic changes in the 1994 \"Emerald Twilight\" story arc, which he regarded as a wholly out-of-place gimmick for Jordan to merely boost sales. To be accurate regarding Jordan's role as a United States Air Force pilot, Cooke spoke with two fighter pilots as well as fellow comic writer & artist Mike Allred, who had previously been stationed in Germany while serving in the Air Force.\n\nWhile clarifying that he did not approve of John F. Kennedy's personal flaws, Cooke cited Kennedy's 1960 \"New Frontier\" speech—which both inspired the title and concluded the book—as \"the first time [the promise of modern America] was ever properly articulated.\"\n\nFor 2006's collected Absolute Edition of the series, Cooke proposed including up to 48 additional pages, later negotiated down to 13 in order to hit a 400-page page count. The additional material provided more backstory for The Flash and J'onn J'onnz, as well as the Suicide Squad on Dinosaur Island. Cooke admitted surprise at this deluxe edition being released so soon after the original release due to retailer demand, citing a three-year wait for an Absolute Edition of Alan Moore's \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\".\n\nIn a 2014 interview, \"New Frontier\" co-editor Chiarello named the book as the work he was the most proud of his involvement in, calling it \"as pure a comic-reading experience as any comic that's ever been published.\"\n\nIn 2004, Cooke also contributed to DC's artist-centric anthology project \"Solo\". His issue (#5, Aug. 2005) featured several different stories in different styles with a framing sequence featuring Slam Bradley, and was originally intended by Cooke to be his final mainstream comic before other palatable DC projects pulled him back. In 2006, \"Solo\" #5 won an Eisner Award for \"Best Single Issue.\"\n\nIn November 2006, Cooke and writer Jeph Loeb produced a \"Batman/The Spirit\" intercompany crossover. This was followed in December by an ongoing \"Spirit\" series written and drawn by Cooke. At the time, Cooke considered \"The Spirit\" \"the most exciting and horrifying offer I'd been made in my career,\" and later described himself as \"incredibly reluctant to step into [\"Spirit\" creator Will] Eisner's shoes,\" despite it \"paining him\" when he was younger that he might never professionally draw the character. Cooke also expressed regret that he—while having met Will Eisner in the past—never got to consult with Eisner specifically for \"The Spirit\"; Eisner had died in 2005. Along with adding new characters such as Ginger Coffee and Hussein Hussein, Cooke revised Ellen Dolan and Ebony White, in particular discarding White's exaggerated blackface-inspired appearance and dialect. In June 2007, Cooke and J. Bone won a Joe Shuster Award for \"Outstanding Canadian Comic Book Artists\" for their work on \"Batman/The Spirit\", and Cooke won \"Outstanding Canadian Comic Book Cartoonist\" for his work on \"The Spirit\". Despite intending a second year of the series, Cooke announced at the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con that his run on \"The Spirit\" would conclude after one year, after artist J. Bone had to step down, and an editorial reshuffle at DC moved editors Scott Dunbier and Kristy Quinn from the book, believing that resulting quality would not be up to his standards.\n\nDarwyn Cooke also wrote the first six-issue story arc of the Superman monthly series \"Superman Confidential\", which debuted on November 1, 2006 and featured stories set in Superman's early career. As Cooke developed the plot with artist Tim Sale, he realized he had no creative hook for a Superman story until discovering that, surprisingly, none had been told regarding the character's early fear and uncertainty at the limits of his invulnerability. In June 2007, Cooke was awarded the Joe Shuster Award for \"Outstanding Canadian Comic Book Writer\" for \"Superman Confidential\". Feeling more comfortable with human characters like Catwoman and Batman, Cooke nonetheless had pitched one other unrealized Superman graphic novel around 2002 in collaboration with artist and future \"Justice League: The New Frontier\" director David Bullock.\n\nIn 2008, Cooke collaborated with Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray on an issue of \"Jonah Hex\" out of a desire to work with the pair, write a Western story, as well as craft a cliché-breaking tale for Hex set within Canada. Cooke playfully made fun of American conventional wisdom that Canadian weather was always a blizzard, but accepted the premise as a central plot element.\n\nCooke was the writer/artist of \"Before Watchmen: Minutemen\" and the writer of \"Before Watchmen: Silk Spectre\" in 2012–2013. After originally being pitched to author the entire \"Before Watchmen\" series, Cooke was able to reduce his commitment to only two books, eventually accepting the project after successfully conceptualizing the \"Minutemen\" series. Cooke did not view \"Watchmen\" as \"the Holy Grail\" of comics, nor did he feel concerned about original \"Watchmen\" author Alan Moore's opinion on the \"Before Watchmen\" series, but he did initially turn down the project for two years out of concern that his work would not measure up either to the original book or its reputation within the comics industry.\n\nVertigo editor Shelly Bond encouraged Cooke to produce a collaborative work. Cooke proposed Gilbert Hernandez as the writer, believing Hernandez would not be interested. Their collaboration, \"The Twilight Children\", takes place in a Latin American fishing village and mixes elements of science fiction and magic realism. The lives of the villagers are disrupted by a sudden increase in supernatural activity and an influx of suspicious investigators.\n\nWhile preparing for \"DC: The New Frontier\" and before creating \"Selina's Big Score\", the success of \"Batman: Ego\" led Cooke to Marvel Comics freelance work such as \"X-Force\", \"Wolverine/Doop\" and \"Spider-Man's Tangled Web\".\n\nCooke later had a falling out with Marvel and then-Senior Editor Axel Alonso after Marvel solicited and praised his business plan for the Marvel Adventures children's line, yet subsequently passed it onto other creators without the company's communication or his involvement.\n\nIn July 2009, IDW Publishing published Cooke's \"\", an adaptation of the Donald Westlake novel, \"The Hunter\", the first of four Parker novels Cooke adapted for IDW. The second, \"The Outfit\", was released in October 2010, \"The Score\" was released in July 2012, and \"Slayground\" was published in December 2013, with Cooke handling the entire art direction and physical design.\n\nIn January 2015, Image Comics announced a three-part fully creator-owned project by Cooke entitled \"Revengeance\", originally intended to launch June 2015. Compared by Cooke to Mickey Spillane's \"I, the Jury\", the psychological thriller and dark comedy had been tentatively titled \"Thunder Bay\", and was to be set in Toronto in 1986.\n\nCooke initially pitched the art duties to Tim Sale, but decided to take them up himself after an unsuccessful five-year wait for Sale's availability. \"Revengeance,\" however, remained unreleased at the time of Cooke's death in 2016.\n\nCooke married Marsha Stagg in Las Vegas, Nevada in November 2012 and lived in western Florida.\n\nHis personal favorite movie was \"The Wizard of Oz\", which he described as \"the first movie to scare me [and] ignite my imagination.\"\n\nOn May 13, 2016, Cooke's wife announced on his official blog that he was battling an \"aggressive\" form of cancer, stating, \"It is with tremendous sadness that we announce Darwyn is now receiving palliative care following a bout with aggressive cancer. His brother Dennis and I, along with our families appreciate the outpouring of support we have received. We ask for privacy as we go through this very difficult time.\" Cooke died the next morning on May 14, 2016.\n\nComic creators such as Dan DiDio, Brian Michael Bendis, Gail Simone, Jimmy Palmiotti, Ed Brubaker, and Mark Waid expressed condolences, reminisced on working with Cooke, and made recommendations of Cooke's works to fans.\n\nUpon Cooke's passing, DC Comics issued a statement describing Cooke as \"one of our medium's true innovators,\" comparing his \"bold, direct style\" with Joe Kubert, Alex Toth, and Jack Kirby.\n\nCooke acknowledged himself as difficult to work with, a trait that was ultimately recognized as beneficial by his comic book industry peers. Artist Cliff Chiang noted that Cooke's uncompromising nature \"opened doors for lots of us.\"\n\nCooke won thirteen Eisner Awards, eight Harvey Awards, and five Joe Shuster Awards for works produced for DC Comics and IDW Publishing, primarily for \"DC: The New Frontier\" and \"Richard Stark's Parker\". In a 2007 interview, Cooke admitted to—while appreciating them—not paying much attention to awards. However, upon winning his first Eisner Award in 2005 for \"DC: The New Frontier\", Cooke did feel gratification for his pursuit of comics as a career and understood that he was genuinely on the right path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2319613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319613", "title": "Lawrence Biondi", "text": "Lawrence Biondi\n\nLawrence H. Biondi of the Society of Jesus was President of Saint Louis University from 1987 to 2013, a period that saw notable improvements in the facilities and campus of the university.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, Biondi studied at St. Ignatius College Preparatory School where he first became interested in the Society of Jesus. Before joining the Jesuit order's Chicago province in 1973, Biondi taught French and Latin at St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, from 1965 to 1967.\n\nBiondi earned six degrees. His master's degree in linguistics (\"A Comparative Study of Tagmemic and Stratificational Grammars\", 1966) and his doctorate in sociolinguistics (\"The Linguistic Development and Socialization of Italian-American Children in Boston’s North End\", 1975) both were conferred by Georgetown University. He earned three degrees from Loyola University Chicago and a licentiate in sacred theology from the Jesuit School of Theology at Chicago.\n\nIn August 1987, Biondi was chosen to be succeed Thomas R. Fitzgerald, S.J. (1979-87) and be installed as the 31st President of Saint Louis University (SLU).\n\nThe timeline of Biondi's quarter-century of leadership at SLU shows the following major initiatives. In 1991 SLU opened Missouri's first school of public health, known as Saint Louis University College for Public Health and Social Justice. In 1993 West Pine Boulevard that cuts across campus was replaced by a spacious walkway and Clocktower Plaza. Two museums were opened on campus, one of religious art in 1993 and in 2002 the SLU Museum of Art that also includes memorabilia of Jesuit history from Florissant to the Great Plains. In 1999 the Paul C. Reinert, S.J., Center for Transformative Teaching and Learning opened. In 2007 the $82 million Edward A. Doisy Research Center opened, with 80 research labs on 10 floors. It would grow to include a Center for World Health and Medicine, given to the research of medicines to treat diseases that predominantly affect the world's poor and underserved. The following year saw the completion of the $80.5 million Chaifetz Arena seating 10,600 and bringing SLU basketball games back to campus. The old practice gym would become a Cross-Cultural Center welcoming people of all backgrounds, cultures, and identities. In 2013 the law school moved closer to the law courts downtown, with the acquisition of a large facility that housed also the Law Library and legal clinics. In line with training men and women for others and global citizens, new initiatives included: in 1998 Make a Difference Day involving the entire university community at over 100 sites around town; in 2001 the Campus Kitchen Project for the needy; and in 2010 the Center for Sustainability, with masters and a doctoral program on urban and global development.\n\nBiondi was a controversial figure for his approach to leadership for accomplishing his bold vision, once describing himself as a \"my-way-or-the-highway kind of guy.\" \n\nCentering on issues about shared governance with regard to an increase in parking fees, SLU's Student Government Association passed a motion of no confidence in Biondi on March 30, 1999. Student or faculty governance bodies at SLU considered but did not finally act upon no-confidence measures in Biondi in 2002, 2004, 2009, and 2010. In a 2012 interview Biondi said, \"My vision of my legacy is for SLU to be the finest Catholic university in the United States.\"\n\nIn October, 2012, the Faculty Council of the College of Arts and Science and then the University's Faculty Senate voted no confidence in Fr. Biondi. The primary reason for the votes of no confidence against Biondi was his continued support for Vice President-Academic Affairs Manoj Patankar and Patankar's controversial and widely unsupported proposed policies regarding faculty evaluations. As the no confidence movement against Biondi grew, faculty voiced other grievances, including Biondi's disregard for shared governance, the University's declining academic rankings, low alumni giving, and \"a pervasive culture of fear.\" SLU's Student Government Association voted no-confidence in Biondi.\n\nThe votes came after turmoil on campus early in the 2012-2013 academic year, first with the abrupt resignation of the dean of the school of law and then with the release of proposed policy changes in faculty evaluations by Vice President for Academic Affairs Manoj Patankar. In August 2012, the School of Law Dean Dr. Annette Clark resigned in protest over Biondi's transfer of more than $800,000 from law school funds to The President's Opportunity Fund and over disputes with Biondi and Patankar about funding of law professors' academic research. Biondi and Patankar said that they had intended to fire Clark before her resignation. On the heels of Clark's resignation, campus dissension erupted with the release of Vice President Patankar's proposed policies on faculty evaluations which attempted to apply uniform metrics in evaluating faculty with diverse areas of expertise and weakened the status of tenure at Saint Louis University. The controversy over the proposed policies prompted a vote of no confidence by the Faculty Senate against Patankar—a vote upon which Biondi refused to act.\n\nOn May 3, 2013, at a gala attended by some 800 persons celebrating his 25 years as university president, Biondi announced his intention to retire as president, and did so the following September.\n\n"}

The company is based in London and New York City, with additional offices in Paris and Berlin. With over 1,500 titles in print, Phaidon books are sold in over 100 countries and are printed in English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Mandarin, and dozens of other languages. Since the publisher's founding in Vienna in 1923, Phaidon has sold more than 42 million books worldwide.\n\nPhaidon Verlag was founded as a history and art-book publisher in Vienna, Austria, in 1923 by Ludwig Goldscheider, Dr. Béla Horovitz, and Frederick \"Fritz\" Ungar. The founders named the company Phaidon (the German form of Phaedo) after Phaedo of Elis, a pupil of Socrates, to reflect their love of classical antiquity and culture, and the company's distinctive logo derives from the Greek letter phi, which represents the golden ratio, employed by artists, architects, and designers since the fourth century BC. The publisher became known throughout Europe for its affordable, high-quality books about art and architecture. Phaidon's large-format art books first emerged in 1937 with the publication of books featuring works by Vincent van Gogh, Sandro Botticelli, and the French Impressionists.\n\nTo avoid the effects of the Nazi annexation of Austria, Horovitz and Goldscheider moved the company to England in 1938, reestablishing it as Phaidon Press. Following the sudden death of Horovitz in 1955, Phaidon was taken over by his son-in-law, Harvey Miller. A decade later, in 1967, it was acquired by Encyclopædia Britannica.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1981, Phaidon was owned by Elsevier, when it was sold in a management buyout. It was acquired by entrepreneur Richard Schlagman in 1990. Schlagman hired renowned designer Alan Fletcher in 1993 to be the creative lead, and in 1998 Fletcher brought on board the young German designer Julia Hasting, who began focusing on conceptual book design, emphasizing the art book as an object. This approach was translated into the architecture and photography books, as well as the cookery program. Leon Black purchased Phaidon in 2012, heralding a new era for the publisher. Phaidon continues to push the boundaries of creative arts publishing in content, design, and production.\n\nPhaidon publishes monographs on the work of twentieth-century masters including Marcel Breuer, Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, Alvar Aalto, and Eero Saarinen. It also publishes monographs on contemporary international architecture practices. Recent examples include Tadao Ando (Japan), Peter Marino (USA), John Pawson (UK), MAD (China), and Snøhetta (Norway).\n\nPhaidon also publishes historical and geographical surveys on architecture. In 2004, it published the giant format Atlas of Contemporary World Architecture, followed by The Phaidon Atlas of 21st Century World Architecture, Atlas of Brutalist Architecture, and Atlas of Mid-Century Modern Houses.\n\nPhaidon publishes monographs on established and emerging artists, as well as surveys of contemporary and historical art movements and genres. The company has published two of the world's best selling art surveys: The Story of Art, Ernst Gombrich's narrative survey of the history of art from ancient times to the modern era, which has sold over 8 million copies and has been translated into over 30 languages and released in 18 editions since it was first published in 1950; and The Art Book, which presents the work of 600 artists from different periods, schools, visions, and techniques, from medieval to modern times.\n\nThe program includes nonfiction writers, including Alain de Botton, Martin Gayford, and Calvin Tomkins. Phaidon has published monographs on Lucian Freud, Olafur Eliasson, Ellsworth Kelly, Willem de Kooning, Agnes Martin, Bruce Nauman, Harland Miller, and JR. Phaidon has worked with The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts since 1977 to publish The Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonné, which currently spans five volumes.\n\nPhaidon's Contemporary Artists Series, launched in 1996, features over 70 titles. Recent publications in the series include Kerry James Marshall, Yayoi Kusama, Frank Stella, Wolfgang Tillmans, Sarah Sze, and Mark Bradford. Phaidon works with the online art marketplace Artspace to create limited editions of its books.\n\nPhaidon publishes children's books in a wide range of formats including illustrated nonfiction, picture books, and interactive board books. Phaidon's children's book program is partly inspired by the company's traditional publishing categories and is designed to meet the developmental needs and interests of specific age groups. Phaidon publishes children's books by authors and illustrators including Gabrielle Balkan, Jason Fulford and Tamara Shopsin, Sara Gillingham, Jean Jullien, Lotta Nieminen, Chris Raschka, JR, Julia Rothman, Joshua David Stein, Hervé Tullet, and Tomi Ungerer.\n\nPhaidon publishes monographs on product, furniture, and graphic designers, design histories, and, since 2014, surveys on interior, garden, and floral design.

It publishes the best selling The Fashion Book and has collaborated on monographs with creative directors Grace Coddington and Fabien Baron; designers Marc Jacobs, Viktor&Rolf, and Thierry Mugler; and fashion house Yves Saint Laurent, among others.\n\nPhaidon has published monographs with some of the world's leading chefs including Massimo Bottura, Magnus Nilsson, Enrique Olvera, Virgilio Martínez, René Redzepi, and Ferran Adrià, with whom it published the seven-volume set 2005–2011.\n\nPhaidon publishes surveys of world cuisines, a program launched in 2005 with the Italian cookbook The Silver Spoon. Other world cuisines published include American, Chinese, Cuban, French, German, Greek, Japanese, Mexican, Nordic, Peruvian, Spanish, Thai, and Turkish. In 2013 Phaidon published Where Chefs Eat, a global dining guide based on chef recommendations. The series has been extended and adapted to include Where to Eat Pizza, Where to Drink Coffee, Where to Drink Beer, and Where Bartenders Drink.\n\nPhaidon publishes books on popular culture, such as its bestselling advice books by leading creative voices, including It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want to Be by Paul Arden and Damn Good Advice by George Lois.

The school was founded at a time when many parents were reluctant to send their children to schools managed and run by the British, in this case, the English East India Company.\n\nThe schools roots are in two boys' schools in the Triplicane area of Madras, the Dravida Pathasala (Pathasala means school in Sanskrit) for Tamil boys and the Hindu Balura Pathsala for Telugu boys. In 1860, these two Pathsalas were merged, the new entity being named the \"Triplicane Andhra Dravida Balura Pathasala\". The school was later again renamed \"The Triplicane Anglo-Vernacular High School\". Finally, in 1897, the school’s name was changed to \"Hindu High School\".\n\nConstruction of a large school building was completed in 1897, the L-shaped red brick building having been designed by the architect Henry Irwin. The three-storey building was constructed by Namberumal Chetty, on a plot of . Wide and broad verandas and big windows ensured proper ventilation, while high ceilings and rows of arches imparted an imposing look to the school building.

{"id": "2319623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319623", "title": "J.League", "text": "J.League\n\nThe ( is Japan's professional football league including the first division J1 League, second division J2 League and third division J3 League. J1 League is one of the most successful leagues in Asian club football. It is currently sponsored by Meiji Yasuda Life and thus officially known as the .\n\nBefore the inception of the J.League, the highest level of club football was the Japan Soccer League (JSL), which consisted of amateur clubs. Despite being well-attended during the boom of the late 1960s and early 1970s (when Japan's national team won the bronze Olympic medal at the 1968 games in Mexico), the JSL went into decline in the 1980s, in general line with the deteriorating situation worldwide. Fans were few, the grounds were not of the highest quality, and the Japanese national team was not on a par with the Asian powerhouses. To raise the level of play domestically, to attempt to garner more fans, and to strengthen the national team, the Japan Football Association (JFA) decided to form a professional league.\n\nThe professional association football league, J.League was formed in 1992, with eight clubs drawn from the JSL First Division, one from the Second Division, and the newly formed Shimizu S-Pulse. At the same time, JSL changed its name and became the Japan Football League, a semi-professional league. Although the J.League did not officially launch until 1993, the Yamazaki Nabisco Cup competition was held between the ten clubs in 1992 to prepare for the inaugural season.\n\nJ.League officially kicked off its first season with ten clubs on 15 May 1993, when Verdy Kawasaki hosted Yokohama Marinos at the Tokyo National Stadium.\n\nDespite the success in the first three years, in early 1996 the league attendance declined rapidly, coincided with the economic slump of Japan. In 1997, the average attendance was 10,131, compared to more than 19,000 in 1994. Yokohama Flügels were merged with Yokohama Marinos due to the withdrawal of one of their major sponsors, right after they became the winners of the 1998 Emperor's Cup on 1 January 1999.\n\nThe league's management realized that they were heading in the wrong direction. In order to solve the problem, the management came out with two solutions.\n\nFirst, they announced the J.League Hundred Year Vision, in which they aim to make 100 professional association football clubs in the nation of Japan by 2092, which would be the hundredth season. The league also encouraged the clubs to promote football or non-football related sports and health activities, to acquire local sponsorships, and to build good relationships with their hometowns at the grass-root level. The league believed that this would allow the clubs to bond with their respective cities and towns and get support from local government, companies, and citizens. In other words, clubs would be able to rely on the locals, rather than major national sponsors.\n\nSecond, the infrastructure of the league was heavily changed in 1999. The league acquired nine clubs from the semi-professional JFL and one club from J. League to create a two-division system. The top flight became the J.League Division 1 (J1) with 16 clubs while J.League Division 2 (J2) was launched with ten clubs in 1999. The second-tier Japan Football League (former), now became third-tier Japan Football League.\n\nAlso, until 2004 (with the exception of 1996 season), the J1 season was divided into two. At the end of each full season, the champion from each half played a two-legged series to determine the overall season winner and runners-up. Júbilo Iwata in 2002, and Yokohama F. Marinos in 2003, won both \"halves\" of the respective seasons, thus eliminating the need for the playoff series. This was the part of the reason the league abolished the split-season system starting from 2005.\n\nSince the 2005 season, J.League Division 1 consisted of 18 clubs (from 16 in 2004) and the season format became similar to the European club football. The number of relegated clubs also increased from 2 to 2.5, with the third-from-bottom club going into Promotion / Relegation Series with the third-placed J2 club. Since then, other than minor adjustments, the top flight has stayed consistent.\n\nJapanese teams did not treat the Asian Champions League that seriously in the early years, in part due to the distances travelled and teams played. However, in the 2008 Champions League, three Japanese sides made the quarter-finals.\n\nHowever, in the recent years, with the inclusion of the A-League in Eastern Asia, the introduction of FIFA Club World Cup, and increased marketability in the Asian continent, both the league and the clubs paid more attention to Asian competition. For example, Kawasaki Frontale built up a notable fan base in Hong Kong, owing to their participation in the AFC Champions League during the 2007 season. Continuous effort led to the success of Urawa Red Diamonds in 2007 and Gamba Osaka in 2008. Thanks to excellent league management and competitiveness in Asian competition, the AFC awarded J.League the highest league ranking and a total of four slots starting from the 2009 season. The league took this as an opportunity to sell TV broadcasting rights to foreign countries, especially in Asia.\n\nAlso starting the 2008 season, Emperor's Cup Winner was allowed to participate in the upcoming Champions League season, rather than waiting a whole year (i.e. 2005 Emperor's Cup winner, Tokyo Verdy, participated in the 2007 ACL season, instead of the 2006 season). In order to fix this one-year lag issue, the 2007 Emperor's Cup winner, Kashima Antlers' turn was waived. Nonetheless, Kashima Antlers ended up participating in the 2009 ACL season by winning the J.League title in the 2008 season.\n\nThree major changes were seen starting in the 2009 season. First, starting that season, four clubs entered the AFC Champions League. Secondly, the number of relegation slots increased to three. Finally, the AFC Player slot was implemented starting this season. Each club will be allowed to have a total of four foreign players; however, one slot is reserved for a player that derives from an AFC country other than Japan. Also, as a requirement of being a member of the Asian Football Confederation, the J.League Club License regulations started in 2012 as one criterion of whether a club was allowed to stay in its division or to be promoted to a higher tier in the professional level league. No major changes happened to J.League Division 1 as the number of clubs stayed at 18.\n\nFrom 2015 the J.League system changed to a three-stage system. The year is split into first and second league stages, followed by a third and final championship stage. The third stage is composed of stage one and two's total point champions and up to four other teams. These additional four teams consist of the following: Stage one and stage two's top point accumulator, and stage one and two's second placed points accumulator. These five teams then take part in a championship playoff stage to decide the winner of the league trophy.\n\nIn 2017, the single-table format returned due to a negative reaction from hardcore fans and a failure to appeal to casual fans.\n\nSince the inception of the second division in 1999, promotion and relegation follow a pattern similar to the European leagues, where the two bottom clubs of J1 and the top two clubs of J2 are guaranteed to move. From the 2004 to 2008 season, the third-placed J2 club entered the Promotion / Relegation Series against the sixteenth-placed J1 club and the winner had a right to play in the top flight in the following year. Starting on the 2009 season, the top three J2 clubs receives J1 promotion by default in place of three bottom J1 clubs. However, promotion or right to play the now-defunct pro/rel series relies on the J2 clubs meeting the requirements for J1 franchise status set by the league. This has generally not been a hindrance, in fact, no club is yet to be denied promotion due to not meeting the J1 criteria.\n\nUntil the 2004 season, the J1 season was divided into two halves, with an annual championship series involving the champions from each half (with the exception of the 1996 season). However, from the 2005 season, the single-season format is adopted as the top flight was expanded to eighteen clubs. Currently, 18 clubs compete in double round robin, home and away. Starting on the 2008 season, the top three clubs, along with the Emperor's Cup winner receive ACL berths for the following season. If the Emperor's Cup winner happens to be one of the top three J1 finishers, the 4th-place club receives the final berth. Starting on the 2009 season, the bottom three clubs are relegated to Division 2 at the end of the year. The two-halves format returned in 2015 but was abandoned again after 2016.\n\nStarting in 2012, Division 2 established promotion playoffs for the clubs ranked 3rd to 6th, in a manner similar to the EFL Championship in England, the Serie B in Italy and the Segunda División in Spain. However, the semifinals would be only one leg and all matches that ended in draws would enable the higher ranked club in the table to advance or be promoted. In 2013 the J3 League was established, and while its champion was promoted automatically, the runner-up had to play a Promotion/Relegation series until 2017.\n\n\n\n"}

The airport is unique, being the only one in the world where scheduled flights use a tidal beach as the runway. The airport is operated by Highlands and Islands Airports Limited, which owns most of the regional airports in mainland Scotland and the outlying islands. Barra Airport opened in 1936. The airport's only destination is Glasgow.\n\nThe beach is set out with three runways in a triangle, marked by permanent wooden poles at their ends, in directions 07/25, 11/29, 15/33. This almost always allows the Twin Otters that serve the airport to land into the wind. At high tide these runways are under the sea: flight times vary with the tide. Emergency flights occasionally operate at night from the airport, with vehicle lights used to illuminate the runway and reflective strips laid on to the beach.\n\nBarra Airport also has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P792) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Highlands & Islands Airports Limited).

Like all Lotus vehicles, it was given a type designation—Type 104 in this case. The exterior changes were minimal with the addition of a rear spoiler, cooling vents on the bonnet, Lotus badges on the front wings and bootlid, a bodykit and considerably wider wheel arches distinguishing it from a standard Carlton/Omega. The car was only sold in one colour, a shade of green called \"Imperial Green\" (similar to British Racing Green).\n\nPerformance modifications started with an upgraded engine, which was enhanced by Lotus from the standard Opel 24v straight six unit (used in the GSi). The engine was enlarged to a capacity of . Lotus then added two Garret T25 turbochargers, which provide up to of boost from about 1,500 rpm. The original distributor ignition system of the engine was replaced with a three-coil wasted spark system. The distributor drive was re-purposed as a water pump drive for the water-air intercooler circuit. The intercooler itself is manufactured by Behr and is capable of reducing the temperature of the compressed charge from to .\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned engine modifications, Lotus directed a number of engineering changes to the engine so that it would perform reliably with the higher power output. To cope with the higher cylinder pressures (about ), the external webbing on the engine block was reinforced. The crankshaft was replaced as well; early development crankshafts were machined from billet steel in Italy, but the production units were forged by Opel and sent to Maschinenfabrik Alfing Kessler for machining. The cylinder head was left mostly the same as the 4 valves per cylinder from the donor car, although the combustion chamber was milled to reduce the static compression ratio to 8.2:1 (from 10.0:1). The engine was fitted with forged slipper pistons produced by Mahle. Piston connecting rods were replaced with new units made to an original Lotus design.\n\nThe same ZF 6-speed manual transmission as fitted to a contemporary Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1 was used to transfer power output to the rear wheels via a rear limited-slip differential shared with the V8 Holden Commodore.\nThe multi-link suspension of the Omega, already praised by the automotive press, was modified by Lotus for better high-speed stability and improved handling dynamics. To combat the problem of significant camber change (seen with the car at high speed and when fully laden), the self-leveling suspension from the Opel Senator was fitted. Also borrowed from the Senator was the Servotronic power steering system, which provides full power assist at parking speeds, and reduces the power assist as the road speed increases. The Lotus engineers would have preferred using a rack and pinion steering arrangement, but cost and space constraints limited them to the worm-and-roller arrangement.\n\nInitial sketches for the wheels showed a split-rim composite design, but this was ultimately abandoned in favor of a monoblock wheel design, with cited concerns over the durability of the wheels in poor road conditions. The final design for the 17-inch wheels was manufactured by Ronal, along with wider tyres than those used on the Omega. The Omega is fitted with Goodyear Eagle tyres. The tyre compound used is the same as that on the Esprit Turbo SE, with a combination of oils and low hysteresis. This allows for improved high-speed stability and better performance in wet conditions.\n\nThe car is fitted with brake discs with four-piston AP calipers at the front and discs with two-piston calipers at the rear.\nThe twin-turbocharged inline-6 engine in the Carlton (code-named C36GET) has a power output of at 5,200 rpm and of torque at 4,200 rpm, of which was available from 2,000 rpm. The car was capable of accelerating from 0– in 5.2 seconds, and going from 0–124–0 km'h in less than 17 seconds. Tall gearing allows it to achieve approximately in first gear. The Lotus Carlton/Omega held the title of the second fastest four-door saloon for some years, after the Alpina B10 Bi-Turbo.\n\nBecause the Carlton/Omega could equal or exceed the performance of many contemporary sports cars from the likes of Ferrari and Porsche, while also comfortably carrying four passengers, it generated some controversy among the automotive and general press. Bob Murray, then editor of \"Autocar\" magazine, wrote: \"Nobody buying this car could possibly argue he either needs or will be able to use a top whack which is claimed to be around 180 mph\", and suggested that Vauxhall should follow the example set by German automakers (who had begun electronically limiting the top speed of their high-performance cars to 155 mph). Ultimately, Opel did not restrict the car's top speed.\n\nProduction of the Lotus Carlton/Omega began in 1990, four years after the original Omega went on sale. Opel had hoped to build 1,100 cars in total, but owing to the recession of the early 1990s, the Carlton/Omega priced at £48,000 was not selling as well as anticipated and production at Lotus was halted in December 1992. Only 950 cars were completed: 320 Carltons and 630 Omegas, 150 short of the original target. The cars are now starting to become modern classics as low-mileage, well-looked-after examples become rare.\n\nIn 1991, the Italian design house Pininfarina produced a styling concept named the \"Chronos\" that was designed to accept the drivetrain from the Lotus Omega. The single example of the Chronos (sans engine) was displayed at the 1991 Detroit Auto Show.\nWhile the base Omega A and the Lotus Omega were never federalized for sale in the US, the Omega was cleared for grey import under the DOT's \"Show or Display\" exemption in 2011. By the end of 2017, all model years of the Carlton were past the 25 year mark, making them exempt from NHTSA import restrictions.\n\n"}

He challenged twice for the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship in 2004, and was unsuccessful in both attempts.\n\nIn 2005, he ended up adopting the guise of \"Mushiking Terry,\" a gimmick tying into the card/arcade game \"\", defeating \"Mushiking Joker\" in his debut at DESTINY 2005 on July 18, 2005 at the Tokyo Dome, but his challenge for KENTA's GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship on October 28, 2005 was unsuccessful after KENTA started performing heel actions such as faking a low blow as well as mockingly joining in a Terry chant while applying a camel clutch. At the January 21, 2007 Budokan Hall show, he pinned Mark Briscoe to take the GHC Jr. Tag title for himself and Ricky Marvin. At the April 28, 2007 show, he defeated Tatsuhito Takaiwa to win the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship (as Mushiking Terry). At Noah's \"Budokan show! Autumn Navigation '07\", Suzuki (As Mushiking Terry) lost his GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship to Yoshinobu Kanemaru. He later betrayed Marvin by joining with Yoshinobu Kanemaru in tag team, which ended with they winning the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship. Suzuki and Kanemaru joined with Genba Hirayanagi, and later joined the stable Disobey with Takeshi Rikio and Muhammad Yone. When Mitsuharu Misawa died, Suzuki (who was one of his students) adopted not just a green attire resembling the green tights of his mentor but started to use some moves like elbows and the Tiger Driver to pay him tribute and became a face again. He was later expulsed from Disobey and started a rivalry with his former partner Kanemaru. Suzuki would regain the GHC Junior Heavyweight Title from Kanemaru on December 5, 2010, ending his long title run.

On April 7, Suzuki and Aoki defeated Hikaru Sato and Hiroshi Yamato to win the 2013 Junior Hyper Tag League and earn another shot at Kanemoto and Tanaka. On April 25, Suzuki and Aoki defeated Kanemoto and Tanaka in a rematch to become the new All Asia Tag Team Champions. On May 11, Suzuki made a one night return to Noah to take part in Kenta Kobashi's retirement event, Final Burning in Budokan, during which he and Aoki defeated Kentaro Shiga and Tamon Honda in a tag team match. On July 5, following a mass exodus led by Keiji Mutoh, it was announced that Suzuki, along with the rest of Burning, had signed an exclusive contract with All Japan. On October 29, Suzuki quit Burning in order to challenge Kanemaru for the World Junior Heavyweight Championship. On November 21, Suzuki and Aoki, along with Kento Miyahara, joined Go Shiozaki's new Xceed stable. On January 26, 2014, Suzuki and Aoki lost the All Asia Tag Team Championship to former Burning stablemates Jun Akiyama and Yoshinobu Kanemaru. On February 5, Suzuki's longtime partnership with Aoki came to an end, when Aoki quit Xceed to go solo. Immediately afterwards, Suzuki went on a win streak, which culminated with him defeating Masaaki Mochizuki on February 16 to win the 2014 Jr. Battle of Glory.

On February 20, Suzuki won his second Jr. Battle of Glory in a row, defeating reigning World Junior Heavyweight Champion Atsushi Aoki in the finals. This led to a rematch on March 27, where Suzuki defeated Aoki to become the new World Junior Heavyweight Champion. On November 16, while he was still the World Junior Heavyweight Champion, Suzuki announced he would be leaving All Japan on November 30. He had signed a new one-year contract the previous July, but when the contract was afterwards changed twice, he decided to instead leave the promotion. Following the announcement, the World Junior Heavyweight Championship was vacated and Xceed disbanded.\n\nOn January 10 at Wrestle-1 Sunshine Tour after Hiroshi Yamato's title celebration Suzuki appeared and he set his sights on the Wrestle-1 Cruiser Division Championship belt. On January 22, he made an appearance in Pro Wrestling Zero1 by attacking Shinjiro Otani after his match and made a statement that he wants his belt and he makes alliance with Mineo Fujita. On February 10, he defeated Andy Wu on his Wrestle-1 debut. On February 22, Suzuki appeared on FMW in a tag team match when he and Masato Tanaka defeated Tomohiko Hashimoto and Buffalo. On March 12, Suzuki defeated Minoru Tanaka in the finals of a tournament to win the vacant Wrestle-1 Cruiser Division Championship. Suzuki would be the first man to defend the championship outside of Japan, defending the belt on two occasions, one at 4 Front Wrestling against Mark Haskins, and secondly at Pro Wrestling Pride against Ultimo Tiger. After six successful defenses, Suzuki lost the title to Yusuke Kodama on August 11. On September 18, Suzuki and Kaz Hayashi won the vacant Wrestle-1 Tag Team Championship. On February 3, 2017, Suzuki defeated Shinjiro Otani to win Zero1's International Junior Heavyweight and NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championships.

It is one of the fastest growing areas of the game.\n\nThe British Women's Leagues were formed with five teams in 1984. The founder members of the league were:\n\nOf those teams, only two are still in league play today, Oxford University and Solihull, while the Cambridge University has a non-league team. After the Ravens folded, a new team, the Penguins, was set up in Peterborough.\n\nIn England and Wales, 28 teams play in the British Women's Leagues. The top 6 teams in the country play in the Elite League, with a Premier league consisting of 8 teams, and below that two unequally sized divisions, split by north (consisting of 4 teams) and south (consisting of 9 teams).\n\nIn the Premier Division, the sides play each other, one home, once away, with the team ranked highest being declared champion of the league and promoted to the Elite League.\n\nAt the end of the season, the top four Premier sides and top three Division One sides from each region converge for the 'Trophy Weekend'. The Premier Sides play for the Chairman's Cup, while the Division One sides play for the Division One Trophy.\n\nIn addition to the playoffs, there is promotion and relegation between the Elite, Premier, and Division 1 leagues. In 2004/05, this was decided with a Playoff Weekend at Coventry. The Division One sides played first in a one-off game; the following day the winner of that game played the 10th ranked team in the Premier league, to decide who played in the Premier and Division 1 leagues for the following season.\n\nIn 2007-08 season the EIHA introduced women's U16 teams to the league structure. Three teams (Oxford, Streatham and Bracknell) were created in a Southern Division and four teams were created in the women's U16 Northern Division. For 2008–09, Oxford folded and was replaced by Peterborough in the South.\n\n\nPremier League (2019/2020 season)\n\nDivision 1 North League (2019/2020 season)\n\nDivision 1 South League (2019/2020 season)\n\n\nBelow is a list of the winners of the major competitions. The team's standing is shown in win-loss-tie format.\n\n\nThe Women's England League was the first incarnation of the league, starting with five teams before moving up to seven by 1988. An influx of interest from new teams resulted in a complete regionalisation of the sport, a system that lasted two years.\n\n\n Oxford City Rockets declared unofficial champions after beating Streatham in a regional playoff by four goals to one. Rockets were never able to play the final against Sunderland (champions of the Northern Division).\n\n\n\n\nAfter two years of this format, the system switched to the structure that exists to the present day, making it after 15 years one of the longest lasting formats of any ice hockey league that ever has been in the UK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trophy Weekend has been split into the Bill Britton Memorial Trophy and D1 Trophy. The Memorial Trophy sees 1st vs 4th and 2nd vs 3rd in the Premier League, with the winners playing the final the following day.\n\nPrior to the Memorial Trophy being renamed, it was called the Chairman's Cup.\n\nThe D1 Trophy sees the Champion of the North playing the runner-up of the South, and Champion of the South vs runner-up of the North, with the winners playing the final the following day.\n\nThe introduction of the Women's U16 Northern and Southern (season 2007/08) created a third play-off final between the winners of each league.\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation on these playoffs is sketchy; however, the following contains most of them. Playoffs were not held in every season due to either team's not wanting to go for promotion to the higher league, or a natural expansion of the Premier League.\n\n\nThe Knockout Cup was proposed to allow teams of different standard to play each other, and also to increase the number of competitions played in the women's game.\n\n\nIn the UK, there are five sides that play at regional, national and international levels.\n\nEngland is divided into two regional sides, featuring the best players who have not been selected for Team Great Britain. The regional sides are a recent addition to assist with the development of the top women's and girls' hockey in the UK. For the purposes of the records shown, only games against other regional, national or international teams shall be considered.\n\nIn addition, the conference sections are divided into Senior and Junior (U16) teams.\n\nIn total there are three National teams, although Team England has been defunct since 2002. 2006 saw the England team reinstated and an Under 16 England added to the list of national teams. In August 2006 both teams travelled to Prague for a training camp, followed by a tournament in Pilzen which saw the Senior Team play their way to a silver medal.\n\nDetails of all Home Internationals known are shown below:\n\nThe overall records of the teams are therefore:\n\nTeam Great Britain is the national side that represents the UK in firstly the European Championships followed by the IIHF World Championships.\n\nBelow is a guide to GB's performances year by year. Only 'competitive' games (challenge matches ignored) are counted for the records.\n\nTeam GB re-entered the world of international Hockey with a European Championship two-leg qualifying match against the Netherlands in Chelmsford. GB battled hard in both games but were defeated by an experienced Dutch side, winning both games by the margin of four goals to two, giving the Dutch an 8–4 aggregate win and a place in the European Championship.\n\nOverall record: 0–2–0\n\nNo official competitions existed; however, GB defeated the Dutch in Amsterdam 1–0 in a challenge match.\n\nTeam GB took part in the 1991 European Championship finishing 9th out of 10 teams. Placed in a very tough Group B, they lost their first three games to Sweden (0–16), Denmark (0–4) and Germany (0–6) before surprising the Czech Republic with a 2–2 draw in their final game. GB finished bottom of their group, and played Holland in the 9th/10th playoff which they won 3–0.\n\nRecord: 1–3–1\n\nAfter the break for an Olympic year, GB started again in the newly formed European Championship Pool B. Following an opening loss against Latvia (0-3), GB repeated their performance against the Czech Republic from two years previous, this time with a 1–1 draw. France dispatched GB easily in the third game by 7 goals to 2, and GB won their first international game in the final match of the tournament with a 1–0 win over the Ukraine. giving GB a respectable 4th-place finish out of five teams, with GB only missing a medal by one point.\n\nRecord: 1–2–1\n\nGB went to Denmark for the IIHF European Women's Championships Pool B in March 1995, faced a tough group on paper and proved to be a tough group on ice. GB fell to their worst defeat in four years, in the opening game with a 14–1 defeat to Denmark. Slovakia defeated GB 4–1 and in the final group game Holland put seven past the Brits, with only two coming back.\n\nThe 7th/8th playoff game saw GB take on the Ukraine, the only side they had beaten in competitive hockey so far. Unfortunately the Ukraine gave a much more solid account of themselves, and skated to a 2–0 victory which saw GB finish 8th out of eight teams.\n\nRecord: 0–4–0\n\nTeam roster:\n\n\nA trip to Slovakia was in store for GB in Pool B in 1996. GB started positively with a much better account against Denmark who they had been routed against the previous year falling only to a 5–0 defeat. Unfortunately any hopes of a great comeback were dashed in their second game against the Danes who GB had previously done well against, collapsing to a 7–1 defeat. That scoreline was repeated in the final group round game against the Dutch to leave GB adrift at the bottom of their group.\n\nThe 7th/8th playoff saw GB take on Kazakhstan and for the first time in the tournament, team GB took the game to their opponents in a thrilling encounter. Unfortunately the Asian side was just able to edge ahead and won by the odd goal in 9 leaving GB in 8th out of eight place and without a win in two years.\n\nRecord: 0–4–0\n\nTeam roster:\n\n\nSzékesfehérvár, Hungary\n\nFollowing a re-structure in the World Championships, and the no championship in 1998 due to it being an Olympic year, GB finally came back into the new Pool B Qualifying Group to decide the final spot in Pool B for the following year.\n\nGreat Britain opened brightly holding Italy to a 1–1 draw after 40 minutes in the opening game before Italy stepping the game up a gear to skate out to a 4–1 victory; however, the signs looked good. The next game was against the hapless South Africa, which ended to be a sporting contest on the opening puck drop with GB running up their highest ever victory at international level with a 22–0 victory.\n\nAfter a slow start in the final game GB hit the host team Hungary hard with five quick goals in a match that ended up as 9–1 to the Brits, leaving them to finish 2nd out of four teams.\n\nRecord: 2–1–0\n\nTeam roster:\n\n\nSzékesfehérvár, Hungary\n\nIt was back to Hungary in 2000, for the Pool B Qualifying Tournament. GB again had a strong start with the Brits 1–1 against the Group Favorites DPR Korea in their first game. Korea struck back with two 2nd period goals but despite a fightback by GB, the game ended up 4–2 to the Asian side.\n\nAustralia were next up for GB and were comfortably dispatched by seven goals to one. GB finally defeated Holland in a competitive game, 11 years after their first attempt with a comfortable 5–2 victory. GB again finished second out of four teams in their group.\n\nBelgium, who finished second in the other group, took on GB in the 3rd/4th place playoff. GB comfortably dispatched the Belgians by 8 goals to 1 which saw GB ranked overall third out of eight teams.\n\nRecord: 3–1–0\n\nTeam roster:\n\n\nMaribor, Slovenia\n\nPool B overnight was renamed Division 1, but apart from that the challenge stayed the same for GB with their third straight attempt at qualification into the 2nd tier.\n\nGB looked to their first game against hosts Slovenia to set the standard for the tournament and they did not disappoint. 5-0 up after 20 minutes, they went on to win 12-0. Hungary also fell to a GB by 12 goals to 0 in Game 2, and with GB dispatching the Aussies by 4-2 in Game 3 they were left in the pleasant situation of played 3, won 3, scored 28, conceded 2.\n\nSlovakia who were group favourites took on GB in the final game. Slovakia just were too good for Team GB, who despite getting a goal back in the 3rd, went down to a 4–1 defeat and finished second in their group for the third consecutive year.\n\nRecord: 3–1–0\n\nTeam roster:\n\n\nHull, UK\n\nAn Olympic year saw no official hockey taking place, but the IIHF hosted a women's challenge tri-series between Italy, Belgium and GB, held in Hull.\n\nGB beat Belgium, but fell to Italy to finish second in the three team group.\n\nTeam roster:\n\n\nLecco, Italy\n\nThe tea were off to Italy for Division 2, which now sported six teams in direct parity with the men's game for the first time.\n\nGB collapsed to the worst possible start against longtime foes Slovakia. 5–0 down after the first period, they ended up losing 8–1 to the Eastern Bloc side. Game 2 against group favourites Norway was just as tough for the Brits along a spirited performance saw them just 1–0 down after the first GB collapsed to an 8-3 defeat.\n\nGame 3 against Denmark saw a pulsating clash from end to end which saw GB register their first points with a 4–4 draw; however, after leading the Danes were 1–0 at the end of the 1st. The Netherlands, a long term bogey team of the Brits, skated to a 4–2 win over GB. GB's final game against Italy proved too much for them and they were defeated as they had been the previous year to an experienced Italian side, this time 4–2.\n\nGB were relegated, or so was thought. GB however had the dubious honour of being saved by a life-threatening disease, as due to the SARS pandemic in China the World Championships were cancelled for that year and the IIHF didn't relegate any teams from any divisions.\n\nRecord: 0–4–1\n\nTeam roster:\n\n\nVipiteno-Sterzing, Italy\n\nFrom a standings point of view, the 2004 saw GB's worst ever performance in international ice hockey, with defeats to Denmark, Italy, Slovakia, the Netherlands and Australia.\n\nHowever, when a team is washed out a goal on a wraparound due to the referee 'losing sight of the puck' as it went round the net, there isn't much to be done. GB battled desperately hard under some of the worst refereeing ever seen in an international competition.\n\nGB were relegated to Division 3 along with Australia.\n\nRecord: 0–5–0\n\nTeam roster:\n\n\nCape Town, South Africa\n\nDivision III was the setting for GB. GB started off the tournament in impressive fashion easily dispatching Hungary 5–0 followed by an 11–0 demolition of Belgium.\n\nGB's minds were however firmly planted on the 3rd game, without a doubt the title decider. GB went a goal down at 26:56 before Newcastle's Teresa Lewis opened the account for GB on the half hour mark.\n\nWith the scores neatly tied at 1 heading into the final period, GB battled hard. University of New Hampshire's Angela Taylor picked up a penalty for highsticking at 47:39, and with eight seconds left in the game heartbreak as Slovenia took the lead. GB were never able to get back in the game and ended losing 4–1 with the final goal placed into the empty net.\n\nGame 4, saw GB take out their frustrations of the previous game with a 19–0 victory over South Africa, who were saved relegation by the IIHF Women's Committee as they expanded the Elite competition to 9 teams, and thus no teams were relegated this time around.\n\nGame 5, saw GB finally lay the ghost of a year ago with an excellent 6–2 victory over Australia to ensure GB's 2nd-place finish.\n\nRecord: 4–1–0\n\nTeam Roster:\n\n\nGB's All time Competitive International record stands at: 14–28–3\n"}

Aiming for a radically different experience than most other games in the genre, the game focused on character interaction and politics to the extent that combat was entirely removed from the design.\n\nBeta testing started on February 1, 2006. Open beta testing started on April 25, 2006. The game was released to the public on May 2, 2006.\n\nAs of September 28, 2006, Runestone decided to file a bankruptcy petition to the court of Aarhus, Denmark. A public statement explained that the lack of money was caused by failing to achieve a partnership deal with publishers and MMO companies.\n\nHaving successfully colonized the Moon and Mars, humanity was looking to spread far across the universe. The creation of ram scoop propulsion made this dream a reality.\n\nFive seed ships were built, each a kilometer long and populated with machinery designed to terraform a suitable planet. Humans would not ride along for the journey; instead, DNA codes, sperm, and eggs were carried along in cryocoolers to be hatched by the TAU computers at the appropriate time.\n\nThe TAU computers also carried a wealth of human knowledge. This was the subject of a long and heated debate on what should be included. Finally, it was decided to make the colonies idealist societies; therefore, references to wars and violence were not included.\n\nAfter searching the universe for several years, the first suitable planet was spotted near the star Beta Hydri 24.4 light years from the Sun. Probes indicated that the planet had an atmosphere, water and living microorganisms. It was to be the destination of the first seed ship.\n\nHowever, something went wrong and suddenly the colony has found itself on a planet that has not been terraformed, as was the plan, and without contact to Earth.\n\nPlayers were colonists and instead of doing combat in the traditional sense the game focused on politics and manual labor. Players politically fought for sectors of the station which could then be equipped to provide services to other players. Using tools the player could manufacture new technology as well as repair parts of the station that were slowly degrading. Letting too many failing systems in the station rendered machinery unavailable until players repaired them.\n\n\n\n\nAs of 9/28/2006 Runestone, the developer and publisher of Seed the game, officially announced the game's closing (official announcement).\n\n"}

It is most commonly used in reference to instrumental music, although it can also be used in choral music. An individual member of the ripieno is called a ripienista.\n\nIn the concerto grosso, it refers to the larger of the two ensembles as opposed to the group of soloists called the \"concertino\".

The meet was initially staged biennially (every odd year), to allow for an international championship-level meet in the non-Olympic and non-World Championships years. However, beginning with the 2002 championships, due to the changing of the World Championships from every four years (even year between Olympics) to every two years (every odd year), the meet is a quadrennial event, held in the even year between Summer Olympics.\n\nThe meet was founded by its four Charter nations: Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United States. As part of the Charter, hosting of the meet is to rotate among these four nations, with the meet being held in Japan every other championship.\n\nThe meet was founded as an alternative to the European Championships, for those countries that could not swim in those championships, in a manner similar to the Four Continents Figure Skating Championships which provide a similar 'continental' championships for non-European nations. Initially, the meet was open to all countries that border the Pacific Ocean, giving the meet its name. This since has been expanded/opened to include other non-European countries wishing to participate, such as Brazil and South Africa.\n\nThe meet is considered to be one of the toughest international swimming competitions outside the Olympic Games, World Championships and European Championships, due in part to the presence of swimming power-house nationals like the United States and Australia, the first and second most medals winners, respectively.\n\nUnlike the World Championships and Olympic Games, nations can enter as many people as they like in the preliminaries of each event (in most international meets, only two swimmers from each nation are permitted). However, only two swimmers per nation can qualify for the Championships' semi-finals and finals. Prior to FINA's creation of semi-finals in the late 1990s, a total of 3 swimmers per country could qualify for the final and consolation heats of an event, with no more than 2 swimmers per country in a final or consolation.\n\nNote: The 1995 and 1999 editions served as the swimming test events for the Olympic venues, for the next year's Games.\n\nAll-time Pan Pacific Championships medal table (Updated after 2018 Championships)\n"}

The current station manager is JD Mostert, with Siyanda Fikelephi as the Programme Manager.\n\nFormerly known as \"Radio 5\", the station developed from a commercial station, LM Radio, which had been operating from Lourenço Marques (now Maputo) in neighbouring Mozambique. Radio 5 first went on the air on 13 October 1975 after Mozambique gained its independence. The station began broadcasting in the medium wave band from transmitters at Welgedacht, Maraisburg, Pietersburg, Durban, Bloemfontein, Brackenfell, Port Elizabeth and Grahamstown. The name indicated it was the SABC's fifth national radio channel at that time, after Radio Suid-Afrika, Radio South Africa, Springbok Radio and Radio Bantu.\n\nRe-branded \"5FM\" in 1992, it has as its current logo a red \"5\" and superscripted \"FM\" within a circle and the words \"The Power of\" inscribed along the upper periphery of the circle. Music is the heart of 5FM's format, supported by news, sports and traffic catering to a wide range of tastes for a youthful market.\n\nRadio 5 launched on 13 October 1975 from the SABC Broadcast House in Commissioner Street and was later moved into the basement of the Broadcast Centre, Auckland Park in Johannesburg. It had interesting foreign origins!\n\nLM Radio, targeting South Africa's youth from Lourenço Marques in Mozambique had for years been a thorn in the side of the Calvinistic South African Government and its National Broadcaster, the SABC. When LM Radio was shut down by the Frelimo Government the South African Government instructed the SABC to take over the staff and the service.\n\nThis was not welcomed by the SABC. They promptly renamed the station Radio 5 and required it to be bilingual with an equal weighting of English and Afrikaans. Music was strictly monitored, controlled and censored. As a commercial radio station it was doomed.\n\nThe day after LM's closure, now ex-LM jock Nick Megans reported for duty and (as competently as possible under draconian conditions) presented the first live show on Radio 5 starting at 05:00 on 13 October 1975.\n\nCompetition was fierce. Channel 702 broadcasting from Bophuthatswana and Capital 604 in the Transkei were Radio 5's competition.  But this was not enough to change the attitude of the Calvinistic SABC. (Minister of Broadcasting, Albert Hertzog, referred to Radio 5 and the others as stations that played: \"Die Duiwel se Musiek\" (The Devil’s Music).\n\nChannel 702 was renamed Radio 702 and, on the advice of an American consultant, Bob Hennaberry, the music format changed to straight Top 40 with the introduction of new voices. The star to emerge was the highly talented John Berks (also ex LM) who they head-hunted from Radio 5. Within a year 702 claimed nearly a million listeners from the area then called the PWV while the nationwide Radio 5 could muster less than 150,000.\n\nRhodesian (now Zimbabwe) TV and Radio man Malcolm Russell was employed as the new Radio 5 Breakfast Show Host and used the time to plan a way forward against the powerful competition Radio 5 faced. Coincidentally there was a changing of the guard at the SABC. Riaan Eksteen was appointed Director General in 1984. When he learnt that the youth of the nation were listening to 'foreign stations' he is reported to have demanded that Radio 5 be 'fixed or shut'.\n\nIn 1985 Russell presented a radical and far-reaching plan and was appointed to Programme Director to implement it. He was given a six-month window with his only constraint being 'Don't breach the Broadcast Act.' \n\nHe immediately began sweeping changes, determined to programme for the listener, not the management. This included:\n\n\nThe live phone-in Chuckle and Chat Show, presented by David Blood and Tony Sanderson became the hottest property on the air with listenership peaking at around 1 million nightly.\n\nRussell made the Presenter's responsible for their own success or failure with the promise that, when their year's contract expired they would be free to renegotiate based on the audience the shows delivered.  (The legend is that he told the jocks \"if your listenership is up at the end of the year I expect to hear from you. If they're down, expect to hear from me!\") At the end of the first 12 months with an unheard of growth in loyal listeners, no-one lost their jobs! \n\nHowever, Russell remained on salary and sought to negotiate the same performance-based contract for himself. Senior management rejected the proposal and Russell resigned to begin his own company, the Broadcast Development Group. (He was later to be contracted to assist the now ailing Radio 702 in its very successful repositioning and transition to 702 Talk Radio).\n\n\nThe Mark Gillman show was hosted by Mark Gillman and supported by Kevin Fine and Ruben Goldberg, Catherine Strydom (Grenfell) and stuntman \"DangerBoy\". Gillman was best known for his loud personality, and ability to wake people up with his high energy. His slogan \"I Love it in the Mornings\" was an effective mantra for people looking to start their days off on a positive note.\n\nAfter a brief stint as the host of the drive-time show, Gareth Cliff replaced Gillman as 5fm's Breakfast Show host. With Cliff as the host, the show was supported by Leigh-Ann Mol on News, Mabale Moloi on traffic & Sias DuPlessis on Sport, with the production team featuring Damon Kalvari (Assistant to the Producer), and Thabo Modisane (Executive Producer). The show ended in 2014 when Cliff began an online radio platform, to which all of his team, save DuPlessis & Modisane, followed him.\n\nFollowing Cliff's departure in 2014, DJ Fresh took over the morning show, having hosted the drive-time show since 2003. He was joined by Carmen Reddy on News, Duran Collett on Sports News, Sol Phenduka (and later Nonala Tose) on Traffic. On 31 March 2017, Fresh left 5FM for sister station, Metro FM.\n\nHe was replaced by the current breakfast show host, Roger Goode, who hosts the show alongside Robbie Kruse on Sports, Sureshnie Rieder on News and Zanele Potelwa (nicknamed 'Young Boomerang') on traffic.\n\nSince May 2020, Msizi James and Stephanie Be have paired up to present the \"Mid Mornings on 5\" show during the brunchtime slot.\n\nRob Forbes & Fix Moeti, one of radio's most fiercest duo's currently on air, host the \"Forbes&Fix\" show during the lunchtime slot, with Kim Schulze on News.\n\nUntil 2014, DJ Fresh hosted the The Fresh Drive alongside Catherine Grenfell, Poppy Ntshongwana, Duran Collett & Carmen Reddy. They were replaced by longtime host Roger Goode, joined by Ms Cosmo, Sureshnie Rieder & Sias du Plessis, who was later replaced by Robbie Kruse. \n\nIn 2017, Thando Thabethe became the station's first woman to host the Drive Time show. The Thabooty Drive featured Durbanite Msizi James as the co-host, Sibaphiwe Matiyela (and later, Nadia Romanos) on News and Duran Collett on Sports. She later resigned in 2020. \n\nMay 2020 saw Nick Hamman, who had previously hosted the Hamman Time show during the mid-morning slot, took over as the host of 5Drive. He is joined by his producer, Mad Money Mike, and the on-air team of Nadia Romanos on News, Bibi Mbangula on Traffic and Jude van Wyk on Sports.\n\nBefore 2019, the Weekend Breakfast show, \"A Cuppa JT\" was hosted by Justin Toerien, with Nadia Romanos & Jude van Wyk on News & Sports respectively.\n\nIn April 2019, Nicole da Silva took over the reigns of the weekend morning slot, naming the show \"5FM Xtra Loud Mornings\". She is joined by Sibaphiwe Matiyela on News and Duran Collett on Sports.\n\nSticking to their focus on music, the youth-aimed radio station delivers a musically-centred offering throughout the weekend. Hosts of these shows include Marilize du Plessis & Leah Jazz and the 5FM Weekender5 who deliver shows heavily centred on music, like Ms Cosmo, Ryan The DJ, Kid Fonque & Kyle Cassim among others.\n\nMid-Morning host Msizi James anchors the 5FM Top 40 Chart show every Saturday.\n\n\n\n"}

The game's plot is not an adaptation of the film, but rather serves as an original continuation to the film's events.\n\nThe story begins when Rufus summons Bill S. Preston Esq. and \"Ted\" Theodore Logan for a mission. The boys arrive at different times; first Ted then Bill. They are informed that time-space rebels have gone back in time, kidnapping various historical figures and leaving them stranded in different time periods. So now they must travel to the time periods, retrieve these figures and return them to their correct time periods. This must be done as soon as possible; for if history isn't made right, the boys will miss the big concert that will launch Wyld Stallyns' music career. Unfortunately, Rufus can only loan out a pay phone-booth for this trip. Once the mission is explained, Ted leaves and Bill arrives later. Rufus states that since they both came alone, it is best that they work separately. From there Bill is brought up to speed on the situation. Bill is instructed to go back in time and leave items to help Ted along the way in each time period he visits. When Bill has done this he will start his own search. Ted will also do the same for Bill's search after he has found a historical figure.\n\nDepending on the level, players take control of either Bill or Ted to search for the stranded historical figures' various worlds throughout history and return them to their rightful times. Players will explore houses, buildings and castles, plus talk to locals for clues and outfox mad villagers by outrunning them or using items from their inventory that can either distract, satisfy, entrance, or cause the person to disappear. In order to gain the historical figure's trust, the player must locate items called historical bait hidden within each world.\n\nMusic within the game levels is unique as each piece is short and non-looping. Arranged versions of popular songs are used for various game levels. Medieval World uses \"Scarborough Fair\", Modern World uses the song \"Won't You Come Home Bill Bailey\", and Ancient World uses Deep Purple's \"Smoke on the Water\".\n\nUpon its release the game earned a handful of mixed-to-negative reviews. \"Nintendo Power\" gave the game a 3.6 out of 5 stating the positive side as \"Bill & Ted fans won't be disappointed by the video versions of the dudes from San Dimas\" but also points \"It isn't easy finding items, which means you'll spend ages wandering around, and that's frustrating.\" \"Game Player's Strategy Guide\" states \"It's a change of pace from the usual role playing adventure, with a refreshing - if somewhat overbearing - humor.\" GamePro states \"What could have been a truly excellent video game adventure wound up as a mildly entertaining video-jaunt.\" \"Video Games & Computer Entertainment\" states \"The verbose Bill and Ted themselves would likely describe this adventure of theirs as being 'bogus,' but what we get can be best called average.\"\"\n\nMany gaming sites have also given their thoughts on the game. As many of the reviews have been written ten years after the game's initial release, these reviews have been for the most part negative. The site 1UP.com gives the game an F grade, but features no feedback. Honest Gamers gave the game a 4 out of 10 stating \"Though it does a reasonable job of making you feel like you're really exploring different historical periods, Bill & Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure doesn't really do anything else right.\" Just Games Retro gave a 22 out of 100 stating \"It had all the ingredients, yet fundamentally obvious problems that any gamer will catch in ten minutes make it an unplayable mess.\" Flying Omelette.com gave a 1 out of 5 saying \"Thankfully, the Bill & Ted movie got a proper sequel to cleanse the territory stolen by this forgettable outing, which is more of a \"bogus journey\" than the real sequel claimed itself to be.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2319740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319740", "title": "Charles Becker", "text": "Charles Becker\n\nCharles Becker (July 26, 1870 – July 30, 1915) was a lieutenant in the New York City Police Department between the 1890s and 1910s. He is known for the scandal of being tried, convicted and executed for first-degree murder of Manhattan gambler Herman Rosenthal in 1912 near Times Square. \n\nConvicted in the Becker-Rosenthal trial, Becker may have been \"the only police officer executed for crimes connected to his official performance.\" He appealed and was retried, but convicted again. The corruption scandal related to this case was one of the most important in Progressive Era New York City and the early part of the 20th century. \n\nCharles Becker was born in 1870 in the village of Callicoon Center, Sullivan County, New York. His parents were German-American immigrants from Bavaria. Becker moved to New York City as a young man in 1890 and went to work as a bouncer in a German beer hall just off the Bowery. \n\nIn November 1893 he joined the New York City Police Department. In the fall of 1896 Becker gained wide attention when he arrested Ruby Young (alias Dora Clark) on Broadway, because the known prostitute was in the company of popular writer Stephen Crane, the author of \"The Red Badge of Courage\". \n\nThe next day at Ruby Young's hearing, Crane stepped forward and defended Young. \nCrane's popularity carried weight in court at the sentencing of Young, and Magistrate Robert C. Cornell dismissed the case. Afterward Crane told reporters, \"If the girl will have the officer prosecuted for perjury, I will gladly support her.\" Three weeks later, Young filed formal charges against Becker. \n\nFeeling vulnerable, Becker gathered evidence, hired experienced defense counsel Louis Grant, and rallied the support of his colleagues. Becker made a powerful entrance to his trial on October 15, 1896, surrounded by a phalanx of policemen. Commissioner Frederick Grant, son of Ulysses S. Grant, headed the proceeding. After almost five hours of examination, Becker was acquitted. Becker learned about the power of the badge and how he could call on his colleagues for help.\n\nBecker married Letitia Stenson from Ontario, Canada. Their son Howard P. Becker was born in 1899. Six years later the couple divorced, and Howard grew up with his mother and stepfather in the West. His mother married Charles's brother Paul. Howard Becker completed a doctorate in sociology at the University of Chicago, and later became a full professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nCharles Becker married and divorced again. In 1905 he married a woman named Helen, a schoolteacher and later assistant principal. Their daughter, Charlotte Becker, died less than a day after her birth in 1913. Helen Becker always believed that her husband was wrongfully convicted of murder.\n\nIn 1902 and 1903 Becker was one of the leaders of a patrolman's reform movement agitating for the introduction of the three-platoon system. This would have significantly reduced the number of hours which the beat police officer was expected to work. In 1906 he was seconded to a special unit working out of police headquarters to probe the alleged corruption of Police Inspector Max F. Schmittberger. The inspector had earned enmity among patrolmen for giving detailed testimony to the 1894 Lexow Committee investigating police corruption in New York. Partly due to Becker's work, Schmittberger was subsequently prosecuted. Deputy Police Commissioner Rhinelander Waldo was so satisfied with Becker's work that when he was appointed as New York City Police Commissioner in 1911, Waldo appointed Becker, by then a lieutenant, as head of one of the city's three anti-vice squads.\n\nBecker allegedly used his position to extort substantial sums, later shown to total in excess of $100,000, from Manhattan brothels and illegal gambling casinos in exchange for immunity from police interference. Percentages of the take were regularly delivered to politicians and other policemen. The area was under the patronage of Tammany Hall's leader, Big Tim Sullivan.\n\nHerman Rosenthal, a flamboyant Estonian immigrant who ran several illegal casinos in what was known as the Tenderloin district, was irritated by a police raid led by Becker on one of his casinos and the damage they left. He complained to the press that Becker \"collected 20 percent of the take\" there. In July 1912, Becker was reported by the \"New York World\" as one of three senior police officials involved in extorting money from Rosenthal's casinos. The day Rosenthal was due to testify to a grand jury, he was murdered at 2 am as he left the Hotel Metropole at 147 West 43rd Street, just off Times Square. Lefty Louie, Whitey Lewis, Dago Frank, and Gyp the Blood were seen to shoot him from their car, making no effort at disguise. They were separately tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. They were ultimately executed.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Charles S. Whitman, who had made an appointment to interview Rosenthal before his death, alleged that the four gangsters had committed the murder at Becker's behest. Amid a major public outcry following the murder and extensive press coverage, Becker was transferred to the Bronx and assigned to desk duty.\n\nWhitman's office continued to investigate Becker. On July 29, 1912, Becker was arrested at the precinct's closing hour by special detectives from the District Attorney's Office. He was tried and convicted of first degree murder that fall in a trial presided by John Goff, who was \"intensely biased against Becker\" and whose charge to the jury was slanted toward conviction. The verdict was overturned on appeal on the grounds that Goff had been biased, and that there was no independent corroborating witness to testify to the events; all had been involved in the crimes. \n\nThe court ruled for a retrial, but in 1914 Becker was convicted again and sentenced to death. He was the first police officer in New York to receive this penalty. \n\nBecker continued to profess his innocence. The day before his execution, Becker told the warden, \n\"Sure, I told them to put Rosenthal out of the way, but I didn't mean they should kill him. I wanted them to get him out of town so he wouldn't blab. Killing him was Rose's idea and the others. They wanted to save their own skins.\"\nJack Rose had served as a prosecution witness, as did Harry Vallon, Sam Schepps and Bridgey Webber. They were underworld criminal figures believed involved in the crime but they were promised immunity by the DA's office in exchange for testifying against Becker.\n\nWhitman, who was then governor of New York, signed Becker's death warrant in 1915 and attended the execution. Becker was executed by the electric chair in Sing Sing on July 30, 1915. The process took nine minutes, appearing to cause the man intense agony. For years afterward, it was described as \"the clumsiest execution in the history of Sing Sing.\" Becker is the \"only policeman to be executed for murder in the history of the United States.\n\nBecker was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery, the Bronx, on August 2, 1915. He was buried next to his daughter, who had died soon after birth in 1913.\n\nBeginning with Henry Klein in 1927, a number of authors have suggested that Becker was wrongly convicted. Andy Logan wrote a thorough account of this position in her \"Against the Evidence\" (1970), as she became convinced of his innocence in the murder through her research. They suggest that Becker and his fellow officers had stood back and allowed \"the street\" to \"take care of\" Rosenthal, knowing that his cooperation with the DA's office would put a huge target on his back. \n\nThree people have been identified as having a major stake of self-interest in Becker's prosecution for murder. Allegedly, District Attorney Whitman manipulated the evidence to implicate the corrupt Lieutenant. Becker was known to have assets that far exceeded his salary. But for Whitman, gaining a guilty verdict for Becker in the sensational murder case would help his own political aspirations, and he is thought to have been elected as governor largely based on his success in that goal. \n\nIn addition, reporter Herbert Bayard Swope publicized the case mercilessly in the press, representing the power of the \"New York World\". He devoted much space to the conduct of the trial and individuals' testimony. Later he said his reporting on this trial catapulted his career. Lastly, as noted above, judge John Goff showed his bias and played a major role in gaining a guilty verdict from the jury.\n\nNew York police historian Thomas A. Reppetto believes that Becker was guilty, not only for the testimony of people involved, but that he had a strong motive and had shown reckless behavior. The consensus continues to favor Becker's active involvement in the murder.\n\nThe Becker-Rosenthal murder was explored by historian Mike Dash in his \"Satan's Circus: Murder, Vice, Police Corruption and New York's Trial of the Century\" (2007). He made no conclusion as to Becker's guilt in the murder. \n\n\n\n\n"}

Day-boys were admitted in 1949 and girls were admitted to the sixth form in 1984. In 1991 it merged with the Collegiate School, a girls' school in Winterbourne, and was given the name Colston's Collegiate School, but this was reverted to Colston's School in 2005. The current headmaster of the upper school is Jeremy McCullough (since September 2014); he joined the school from Lancing College.\n\nThe school motto \"Go and do thou likewise\", was the motto for the Colston family. It is also one of the mottos for Colston's Girls' School. Its origin is Luke 10:37, the conclusion of the parable of the Good Samaritan.\n\nColston made a donation to Queen Elizabeth's Hospital in 1702 and proposed endowing places for a further 50 boys. This came to nothing, probably because of Colston's insistence that the children of Dissenters should be excluded. Instead, he persuaded the Society of Merchant Venturers to manage a school he established for 50 boys on Saint Augustine's Back, where the Colston Hall now stands. It cost him £11,000 on capital cost and an endowment income of over £1,300. The boys (soon increased to 100) were admitted between the ages of seven and ten years and stayed for seven years. The curriculum covered reading, writing and arithmetic, and the church catechism. On leaving they were to be apprenticed to a trade. Colston was opposed to Dissent and proposed that any boy who attended a service of worship in any place other than an Anglican church should be expelled. He also told the Merchant Venturers that if they apprenticed a boy to a Dissenter they would be in breach of their Trust.\n\nIn 1794 its master was James Gadd, of Temple Street. The school moved in 1861 to the old Bishops' Palace at Stapleton, which is a grade II listed building, and ceased to be a charity institution with a limited curriculum. It also accepted fee-paying boys as well as the 100 boys on the charity foundation. By 1955 the school had 35 foundation scholars, selected by open competition, among its 200 boarders and 100 day boys.\n\nBefore the advent of the day-boys there were four boarding houses, North, South, East and West. These were renamed Aldington, Mortlake, Roundway and Beaufort, with Dolphin being the day-boys house. Later, King's was added as an additional day-boys house. Now there are four day houses, one of which each pupil is allocated at the start of their Colston's career. The school's boarding house Mortlake was closed in 2010 when Colston's School ended a long tradition as a boarding institution.\n\nThe House Cup is contested by the four day houses using a points system over the course of each academic year. The house with the greatest number of points at the end of that academic year will be awarded the Cup. Points are gained by either the collection of commendations, awarded by teachers for outstanding pieces of work, or through performance in house competitions. Points are deducted for receiving detentions. Sports competitions are played on a round robin basis and divided into three school blocks; Years 7 and 8, Years 9 and 10 and Year 11 and 6th Form. Sports competitions include:\n\n\nThe biggest house competition in the school calendar is the House Music. Any individual or group of pupils may enter the preliminary round, displaying any kind of musical performance, and all are awarded points for entering. The best performers will advance to the semi-finals, where they perform in front of their entire year, and the winners from this round will advance to the final where they perform in front of the whole school on the final day of the spring term. In addition to this, each of the four houses pick a song a few weeks in advance of the final to rehearse and perform as a house. An independent adjudicator is brought in by the school to judge the four house songs and select a winner of the House Song, and to determine the overall winner of the House Music, which is between the four day houses. Victories in either of these competitions have a significant impact on the destination of the House Cup for that year.\n\nColston’s sporting legacy is supported by a wide range of facilities, dispersed over 30 acres of landscaped grounds - on site; unique to central Bristol schools. The vast open spaces include areas of woodland, which make it an ideal venue for Colston's Pre-Preparatory, Early Years and Lower school to explore and create a challenging cross country circuit. The site includes an athletics field with pavilion, 6 rugby pitches, 2 cricket squares, a floodlit all-weather hockey pitch, 6 floodlit tennis courts/ 4 floodlit netball courts, a fully equipped fitness suite, 4 squash courts, table tennis facilities, a sports hall with 4 badminton courts/ basketball court, indoor cricket nets and an axe throwing range.\n\nColston modelled his school on Christ's Hospital and the 18th-century uniform reflected this – a long blue coat, knee britches and yellow stockings. By the middle of the 20th century this was mirrored by the yellow tops of the knee stockings worn by all boys until they graduated to long trousers at the age of 13. At that time caps were worn whenever a boy left the premises of the school. They were the typical peaked cap with a coloured band around the rim and an embroidered dolphin at the front, the colour reflecting the house the boy belonged to – Dolphin's was maroon, for example.\n\nIt is the only school in Bristol that can offer all 14 GCSE theatre options. There are a number of shows throughout the year across the age range, including GCSE A-Level and Drama Club productions. In May 2010 Year 9 students devised and produced their own version of Cinderella which raised just short of £1000 for the charity Barnados.\n\nThe school's Combined Cadet Force (CCF) of 256 cadets, the largest since its formation in 1915, and the biggest in Bristol. The CCF has Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy sections and is compulsory for Year 9 and Cadets above Year 9 are trained in teaching all sections of the CCF syllabus to aid with the 3 Permanent CCF Staff. The CCF normally parades every week and carries out activities, including rifle shooting on the school's 15m pipe range, command tasks, climbing, camouflage and concealment, flying, sailing and walking with regular camps. The Royal Navy section has access to sailing boats which are owned by The Royal Navy these include Laser Pico's, Toppers and an RS200 racing boat.\n\nThe school plays rugby union. It won the NatWest Schools Cup (previously the Daily Mail Cup) at U18 level seven times, including six years in a row between 1995 and 2000.\nIn 1999 there was a change in regulations which restricted the number of newcomers into a Sixth Form who could play in the competition. The school went on to win the competition on a further two occasions in 2000 and 2004 under these new regulations before withdrawing to seek bigger challenges\n\nOver 50 old boys have played in the top tier of professional rugby with 11 players representing their countries during the professional era\n\nColston's is located at the top of Bell Hill, a road running close to the M32 motorway. The school is approximately from the city centre.\n\nFormer students, known as Old Colstonians, include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2319750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319750", "title": "YFM", "text": "YFM\n\nYFM (99.2 FM) is a \"Youth\" radio station in Johannesburg, South Africa. Established in 1997, the station is formatted to mostly play urban music genres such as Kwaito, Hip Hop, and R&B along with a minority of its airtime being dedicated to talk shows. As noted by the name, the station's core audience consists of young South Africans.\n\n99.2 YFM is Gauteng’s leading youth radio station.\n\nYFM characterizes their core audience as \"young South Africans who are imaginative, curious and ambitious. They are continuously seeking new ways to improve their lives and their communities so that they are able to lead successful and rewarding lives.\"\n\nYFM describes itself as \"the soundtrack to an urban life – fast-paced, energetic and uplifting with a mix of a few quiet moments so that you can catch your breath in the middle of Jozi madness.\" Hip-Hop, house, kwaito, and R&B form the core of YFM’s sound, with occasional rock or pop music thrown in. YFM devotes 80% of airtime to music, but the rest goes to talk radio.\n\nYFM was one of the very first venues for Kwaito artists, and the station owes much of its success to the success of Kwaito. As YFM's DJ Fresh was quoted by BBC World, \"A majority of artists who are big right now - we made them they made us.\"\n\nYFM started broadcasting in 1995 from the inner-city suburb of Bertrams, Johannesburg, in the face of much skepticism. Within one month of broadcasting 600,000 young South Africans had tuned into YFM. During the mid and late 2000s the number stood at over 1.2 million with more than 500,000 identifying YFM as their favorite radio station.. The numbers have since declined and as of October 2016 the listenership stood at 681, 000. The drop in numbers is linked to mass exodus of talent with DJ Mo Flava being the most recent to leave the station.\n\nIn 1998 Yfm contributed to publishing the Y-Mag (which has been converted to a digital platform), a lifestyle magazine targeting the youth of the nation. In 2000, Yfm introduced its official website: YWorld.\nThe \"Y\" in Yfm stands for \"Youth\" because the station was primarily created for black youth. Also, X was the name of the generation fighting in the anti-apartheid period, which had trouble identifying itself in society. So \"Y\" represents an evolution and defines a new identity for the next generation.\n\nYFM as a brand is responsible for the rise of popular DJ's like the late Kabzela, DJ Fresh, DJ Sbu, Phat Joe, Bad Boy T, Lee Kasumba, Unathi Msengana, Rude Boy Paul, Phindi Gule, Greg Maloka (now CEO of Kaya FM), DJ Warras, Mo Flava, Sol Phenduka, the late Iggy Smallz, Monde Twala, Dineo Ranaka, Chilli M, newsreader William LaHong, Admiral and Jah Seed, Mac G, Tholi B, Ashifa Shabba, Pabi Moloi, Mpho Maboi, AK Mgaga, Nhlanhla and Nhlelo Masina and DJ Speedsta to name a few.\n\nMost recently, the station came under fire from South African record executives and artists alike when YFM CEO Kanthan Pillay called a meeting and introduced a policy that had been put into place. Apparently the policy put together by the management team at YFM stipulated the station would no longer play Kwaito music chart show, which is a rap-similar genre that originated in South Africa but would replace the Kwaito chart show with the English electronic music genre, dubstep chart show. This infuriated the station's listeners and musicians alike as the move was unexpected. YFM listeners apparently felt that replacing staple artists like Kabelo Mabalane, Oskido, Brickz, Big Nuz, DJ Tira, DJ Cleo, DJ Black Coffee just to name a few was offensive and disrespectful to both the South African music industry and its artists at large. Some went as far as saying the station's CEO was spitting at people's faces after YFM listeners and kwaito music (which was regarded as the pillar of the station) made YFM what it is today.\n\n\n\n"}

It is used for barometric pressure in weather reports, refrigeration and aviation in the United States.\n\nIt is the pressure exerted by a column of mercury in height at the standard acceleration of gravity. Conversion to metric units depends on the temperature of mercury, and hence its density; typical conversion factors are:\n\nIn older literature, an \"inch of mercury\" is based on the height of a column of mercury at .\n\nIn English units: 1 inHg = 0.489 771 psi, or 2.041 771 inHg = 1 psi.\n\nAircraft altimeters measure the relative pressure difference between the lower ambient pressure at altitude and a calibrated reading on the ground. In the United States, Canada and Japan, these altimeter readings are provided in inches of mercury, but most other nations use hectopascals. Ground readings vary with weather and along the route of the aircraft as it travels, so current readings are relayed periodically by air traffic control. Aircraft operating at higher altitudes (at or above what is called the transition altitude, which varies by country) set their barometric altimeters to a standard pressure of 29.92 inHg (1 atm = 29.92 inHg) or 1013.25 hPa (1 hPa = 1 mbar) regardless of the actual sea level pressure. The resulting altimeter readings are known as flight levels.\n\nPiston engine aircraft with constant-speed propellers also use inches of mercury to measure manifold pressure, which is indicative of engine power produced. In automobile racing, particularly United States Auto Club and Champ Car Indy car racing, inches of mercury was the unit used to measure turbocharger inlet pressure. However, the inch of mercury is still used today in car performance modification to measure the amount of vacuum within the engine's intake manifold. This can be seen on boost/vacuum gauges.\n\nIn air conditioning and refrigeration, inHg is often used to describe \"inches of mercury vacuum\", or pressures below ambient atmospheric pressure, for recovery of refrigerants from air conditioning and refrigeration systems, as well as for leak testing of systems while under a vacuum, and for dehydration of refrigeration systems. The low-side gauge in a refrigeration gauge manifold indicates pressures below ambient in \"inches of mercury vacuum\" (inHg), down to a 30 inHg vacuum.\n\nInches of mercury is also used in automotive cooling system vacuum test and fill tools. A technician will use this tool to remove air from modern automotive cooling systems, test the system's ability to hold vacuum, and subsequently refill using the vacuum as suction for the new coolant. Typical minimum vacuum values are between 22 and 27 inHg.\n\nInches of mercury was the usual unit of pressure measurement in railway vacuum brakes.\n\n"}

Attention focused on [William] Devery, then a police captain, who stonewalled before the committee by only responding vaguely to questions: \"touchin' on and appertainin' to that matter, I disremember.\" The state probe and Devery's impudent testimony prodded the police commissioners to clean house. Charged with accepting bribes, Devery feigned illness and his case never reached trial, although he was temporarily demoted.\n\nOne newspaper wrote about the hearing that is was, \"[t]he most detailed accounting of municipal malfeasance in history.\"\n\nIt was discovered that the promotion of officers was largely dependent on the payment for a position, and that that payment was largely recovered from the protection of vice businesses including prostitution. A Captain Timothy J. Creedon describes how he paid $15,000 to obtain a captain's rank. He did not achieve this rank prior to this payment even though his examination score for promotion was a 97.82. Originally, he was quoted a price of $12,000, but his Tammany district leader, John W. Reppenhagen, told Creedon that another officer had already come up with that amount and the new price was $15,000, which Creedon paid. Creedon also revealed that a portion of that cost was paid by local businesses. The committee also revealed that when the police did go after prostitutes, they were largely independent street walkers, and even then, Tammany made a profit with its control of the bail system.\n\nThe boss of Tammany Hall, Richard Croker, left for his European residences for a period of three years at the onset of the committee. A new Committee of Seventy was formed, again largely consisting of upper-class reformers, and in the mayoral election of 1894, Republican William L. Strong won.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2319774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319774", "title": "Sweet Tooth (Twisted Metal)", "text": "Sweet Tooth (Twisted Metal)\n\nSweet Tooth, real name Marcus \"Needles\" Kane, is a fictional character from the \"Twisted Metal\" video game series. Sweet Tooth is designed around the premise of a killer clown that drives a combat ice cream truck, and his face has been featured on the cover of every \"Twisted Metal\" game with the exception of Twisted Metal 2, making him the series mascot. While being in every title of the series, he has not always been immediately available, requiring to be unlocked in some. He is the only character (besides Marcus Kane), to drive more than one vehicle in any of the games, being the driver of Head-On's Dark Tooth, Tower Tooth, and as of \"Twisted Metal: Lost\", Gold Tooth.\n\nSweet Tooth has the most relationships to any group of characters in the entire series: his father Charlie Kane (driver of Yellow Jacket in the first game) and Marcus Kane (split personality, Roadkill's driver). The final level of the second game features a boss fight with his father as Dark Tooth. Spectre's ending in the first game strongly hints that Sweet Tooth was the serial killer who killed the driver of Spectre five years before the competition. He has an unnamed brother that only appeared in \"Twisted Metal: Black\", who drove that game's Yellow Jacket vehicle. He is also directly responsible for the creation of that game's Axel, whose wife he killed, and Cage, who wishes to be a greater killer than Sweet Tooth.\n\nThe character has gone through several redesigns differing from game to game, similar to fellow character Calypso, and his personality has grown progressively darker along the way. Despite the changes some factors remained uniform, notably the perpetual flame on his head introduced in the second game. Starting with \"Twisted Metal: Black\", his design became a large, somewhat overweight bare chested clown with a flaming mask locked into a permanent maniacal smile. \"Head-On\" expanded on this idea, changing the mask to face paint and the smile to his own.\n\nSweet Tooth's original look featured him as a green haired, slim simple circus clown who had escaped from a mental institution. The design was expanded upon in the second game in response to changes to the truck's design, notably due to the clown head adorning the truck now featuring a personality of its own. The result gave Sweet Tooth the flaming head design seen on the character since. 989 Studios, who handled the next two games, put more emphasis on the clown design, redesigning his attire to that of a ringmaster in \"Twisted Metal 4\"; neither design was held in high regard by the developers, with David Jaffe stating his dislike of III's look. As of \"Black\" and beyond, the design was modified heavily, giving him increased bulk and other features that would be called his \"classic look\" by Incog Inc.'s design team.\n\nThe ice cream truck was actually designed well before the driver himself, and \"Black\"'s incarnation took six months and many concept sketches to finalize. Labeled early on \"DEMONIC ICE CREAM TRUCK\", attention to details such as the head adorning the vehicle and the contents of the back of the truck were focused on during development. Boss variants of the truck have also appeared regularly in the series starting with Dark Tooth in the second game (which was a re-textured version of the original Sweet Tooth vehicle). While the designs for the vehicles have progressed steadily, care has been emphasized to keep them rooted to the simple yet unique ice cream truck structure, something that has become harder and harder for the team as the games go on.\n\nIn \"\", Sweet Tooth had a big make-over design-wise, giving him a more maniacal homicidal appearance. His personality also changed and became much darker. His background was expanded upon, stating he was a wanted mass murderer that survived the electric chair, to later end up at the Blackfield Asylum. It's revealed that the flames on his head were product of a curse imposed by the \"Black\" character Preacher, the driver of , before execution. He was cursed with the burden of the fires of Hell upon his head, which burns him endlessly and causes him pain. He wants nothing more than for it to be gone, and that's what Calypso offers him as a prize. However, in his ending Calypso reveals that in order to break the curse, he'd have to renounce to his obsession for murdering innocents, to which Sweet Tooth responds by killing Calypso himself. Sweet Tooth also has an unnamed younger brother who drives Yellow Jacket alongside a dead zombified Charlie Kane. However, due to the surreal setting of \"Black\" and his apparent disconnection from the mainstream games, the game's plot is considered an alternative storyline. In Twisted Metal: Lost, it is said in the bio of Yellow Jacket that his brother and Charlie were attempting to kill Needles, then themselves, to \"end the bloodline of generations of murderers and psychopaths.\"\n\nSweet Tooth returns as a car in the child-themed spin-off game \"\", based on RC cars instead of real ones. In this game, Sweet Tooth is the youngest and most mischievous kid in the contest, and enters looking for some ice cream. His ending shows that Calypso offers him an ice cream from his familiar Ice Cream truck, but Sweet Tooth instead steals the truck to terrorize Calypso.\n\nSweet Tooth is also an unlockable character in \"War of the Monsters\" (2003) for the PlayStation 2, a game in which Incognito used the \"TM:B\" engine to make a movie monster fighting game. One of the characters, Agamo, has Sweet Tooth as the fourth skin. To unlock it, one must beat the story mode of \"Twisted Metal: Black\" with Sweet Tooth and have the save on the memory card. Sweet Tooth is represented by a tall mech with the signature flaming clown head, and often breaks out in his usual laughter throughout the game.\n\nSweet Tooth appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting game for the PlayStation 3, \"PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale\".\n\nSweet Tooth's ice cream truck appears as a vehicle customization in the 2015 Psyonix game \"Rocket League\".\n\nSweet Tooth appeared as a combatant in the web series \"Death Battle\", where he fought the Joker from DC Comics and lost.\n\nSweet Tooth was placed second by Joystick Division on its list of \"The Top Ten Video Game Clowns Of All Time\", remarking he \"has become one of the most recognizable figures in the Playstation portion of the video game world,\" while GamesRadar listed him as one of the scariest clowns in videogames, stating he is \"[p]erhaps the only other whiteface to rival Kefka in terms of fame, the rampaging maniac of \"Twisted Metal\" has become the franchise's principal icon\", and \"PlayStation Official Magazine\" ranked him as the seventh best clown on PlayStation. He was listed second in the Cheat Code Central list of \"Top 10 Psychopaths Of This Gaming Generation\". IGN called him one of the most notorious anti-heroes in gaming, saying \"There's no real good guy in the \"Twisted Metal series\"\" but that \"Sweet Tooth ... stands out as a figurehead amongst this crew\".\n\nGameSpy placed him third in their 2001 list of top villains in games. He was included in GameSpot's \"All Time Greatest Video Game Villain\" contest and reached the \"Sinister Sixteen\" round before losing to Sarah Kerrigan. Sweet Tooth was elected the 25th coolest videogame character by \"Entertainment Weekly\". UGO Networks ranked him as the second \"Best \"Twisted Metal\" Characters and Their End Game Videos\", adding \"[i]f there was a psychopathic clown college, the Joker would be the dean and Sweet Tooth would be its top professor.\" In 2013, \"Complex\" included him among the 25 greatest video game mascots at the number 21, saying \"Inhabiting our nightmares is certainly one way to become an effective mascot.\"\n\nIn 2005, Frosty Treats, Inc., filed a lawsuit against Sony contending that Sweet Tooth infringed on the company's trademarks for their \"Safety Clown\". The Safety Clown is a set of decals on their ice cream trucks and directs children to cross the street behind the van so that passing cars are more likely to see them. Frosty Treats' CEO, Carl Long, stated in testimony that \"they don't look the same way, but if the Safety Clown had a brother who was nasty and mean, it would look somewhat like Sweet Tooth.\" In \"Frosty Treats, Inc. v. Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc.\", the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled against the trademark claim because, even if Sweet Tooth was derivative, it was unlikely to cause confusion among consumers.\n"}

{"id": "2319776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319776", "title": "Lunar effect", "text": "Lunar effect\n\nThe lunar effect is a correlation between specific stages of the roughly 29.5-day lunar cycle and behavior and physiological changes in living beings on Earth, including humans. In some cases the purported effect may depend on external cues, such as the amount of moonlight. In other cases, such as the approximately monthly cycle of menstruation in humans (but not other mammals), the coincidence in timing reflects no known lunar influence.\n\nA considerable number of studies have examined the effect on humans. By the late 1980s, there were at least 40 published studies on the purported lunar-lunacy connection, and at least 20 published studies on the purported lunar-birthrate connection. This has allowed several extensive literature reviews and meta-analyses to be produced, which have found no correlation between the lunar cycle and human biology or behavior.\n\nExamples of the belief have been found in ancient Assyrian/Babylonian writing.\n\nThe Late Latin word lunaticus had a secondary meaning of “moonstruck”.\n\nClaims of a lunar connection have appeared in the following contexts:\n\nIt is widely believed that the Moon has a relationship with fertility due to the corresponding human menstrual cycle, which averages 28 days. However, no connection between lunar rhythms and menstrual onset has been conclusively shown to exist, and the similarity in length between the two cycles is most likely coincidental.\n\nThree studies carried out between 1959 and 1973 reported a 1 percent increase in births in New York following a full Moon. However, multiple studies have found no connection between birth rate and lunar phases. A 1957 analysis of 9,551 births in Danville, Pennsylvania, found no correlation between birth rate and the phase of the Moon. Records of 11,961 live births and 8,142 natural births (not induced by drugs or cesarean section) over a 4-year period (1974–1978) at the UCLA hospital did not correlate in any way with the cycle of lunar phases. Analysis of 3,706 spontaneous births (excluding births resulting from induced labor) in 1994 showed no correlation with lunar phase. The distribution of 167,956 spontaneous vaginal deliveries, at 37 to 40 weeks gestation, in Phoenix, Arizona, between 1995 and 2000, showed no relationship with lunar phase. Analysis of 564,039 births (1997 to 2001) in North Carolina showed no predictable influence of the lunar cycle on deliveries or complications. Analysis of 6,725 deliveries (2000 to 2006) in Hannover revealed no significant correlation of birth rate to lunar phases. A 2001 analysis of 70,000,000 birth records from the National Center for Health Statistics revealed no correlation between birth rate and lunar phase. An extensive review of 21 studies from seven different countries showed that the majority of studies reported no relationship to lunar phase, and that the positive studies were inconsistent with each other. A review of six additional studies from five different countries similarly showed no evidence of relationship between birth rate and lunar phase.\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that surgeons used to refuse to operate during the full Moon because of the increased risk of death of the patient through blood loss. One team, in Barcelona, Spain, reported a weak correlation between lunar phase and hospital admissions due to gastrointestinal bleeding, but only when comparing full Moon days to all non-full Moon days lumped together. This methodology has been criticized, and the statistical significance of the results disappears if one compares day 29 of the lunar cycle (full Moon) to days 9, 12, 13, or 27 of the lunar cycle, which all have an almost equal number of hospital admissions. The Spanish team acknowledged that the wide variation in the number of admissions throughout the lunar cycle limited the interpretation of the results.\n\nIn October 2009, British politician David Tredinnick asserted that during a full Moon \"[s]urgeons will not operate because blood clotting is not effective and the police have to put more people on the street.\". A spokesman for the Royal College of Surgeons said they would \"laugh their heads off\" at the suggestion they could not operate on the full Moon.\n\nTwo studies found evidence that those with mental disorders i.e. Schizophrenia generally exhibit 1.8% (< 2.0 percent is statistically irrelevant) of increased violent or aggressive episodes during the full Moon, but a more recent study found no such correlation to that of nonschizophrenic human beings. An analysis of mental-health data found a significant effect of Moon phases, but only on schizophrenic patients. Such effects are not necessarily related directly to the appearance of the Moon. \n\nA study into epilepsy found a significant negative correlation between the mean number of seizures per day and the fraction of the Moon that is illuminated, but this correlation disappeared when the local clarity of the night sky was controlled for, suggesting that it is the brightness of the night sky, and not the lunar phase per se, that influences the occurrence of epileptic seizures with advanced photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nSenior police officers in Brighton, UK, announced in June 2007 that they were planning to deploy more officers over the summer to counter trouble they believe is linked to the lunar cycle. This followed research by the Sussex Police force that concluded there was a rise in violent crime when the Moon was full. A spokeswoman for the police force said \"research carried out by us has shown a correlation between violent incidents and full moons\". A police officer responsible for the research told the BBC that \"From my experience of 19 years of being a police officer, undoubtedly on full moons we do seem to get people with sort of strange behavior – more fractious, argumentative.\"\n\nPolice in Ohio and Kentucky have blamed temporary rises in crime on the full Moon. In January 2008, New Zealand's Justice Minister Annette King suggested that a spate of stabbings in the country could have been caused by the lunar cycle.\n\nA reported correlation between Moon phase and the number of homicides in Dade County was found, through later analysis, not to be supported by the data and to have been the result of inappropriate and misleading statistical procedures.\n\nA study of 13,029 motorcyclists killed in nighttime crashes found that there were 5.3% more fatalities on nights with a full moon compared to other nights. The authors speculate that the increase might be due to visual distractions created by the moon, especially when it is near the horizon and appears abruptly between trees, around turns, etc.\n\nIt was suggested, by Guy Cramer, president of the aerospace science company United Dynamics Corp, that the full Moon might have influenced voter behavior in the US 2000 Presidential Election.\n\nSeveral studies have argued that the stock market’s average returns are much higher during the half of the month closest to the new moon than the half closest to the full moon. The reasons for this have not been studied, but the authors suggest this may be due to lunar influences on mood. Another study has found contradictory results and questioned these claims.\nA meta-analysis of thirty-seven studies that examined relationships between the Moon's four phases and human behavior revealed no significant correlation. The authors found that, of twenty-three studies that had claimed to show correlation, nearly half contained at least one statistical error. Similarly, in a review of twenty studies examining correlations between Moon phase and suicides, most of the twenty studies found no correlation, and the ones that did report positive results were inconsistent with each other. A 1978 review of the literature also found that lunar phases and human behavior are not related.\n\nA July 2013 study carried out at the University of Basel in Switzerland suggests a correlation between the full Moon and human sleep quality. Professor Cajochen and colleagues presented evidence that a lunar rhythm can modulate sleep structure in humans when measured under the highly controlled conditions of a circadian laboratory study protocol without time cues. Studying 33 volunteer subjects, the researchers found that subjective and objective measures of sleep varied according to lunar phase and thus may reflect human circalunar rhythmicity. Stringently controlled laboratory conditions, in a cross-sectional setting, were employed to exclude confounding effects such as increased light at night or the potential bias in perception. Measures of lunar influence on sleep structure, electroencephalographic activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), and secretion of the hormones melatonin and cortisol, were retrospectively analyzed. At no point, during and after the study, were volunteers or investigators aware of the posteriori analysis relative to lunar phase. Around full Moon it was found that electroencephalogram (EEG) delta activity during NREM sleep, an indicator of deep sleep, decreased by 30%, time to fall asleep increased by five minutes, and EEG-assessed total sleep duration was reduced by 20 minutes. These changes were associated with a decrease in subjective sleep quality and diminished endogenous melatonin levels. Cajochen said: \"The lunar cycle seems to influence human sleep, even when one does not 'see' the Moon and is not aware of the actual Moon phase.\"\n\nThere are suggestions that the 2013 Cajochen study is faulty because of a relatively small (n=33) sample size and inappropriate controls for age and sex. A 2014 study with larger sample sizes (n1=366, n2=29, n3=870) and better experimental controls found no effect of the lunar phase on sleep quality metrics. A 2015 study of 795 children found a three-minute \"increase\" in sleep duration near the full moon, but a 2016 study of 5,812 children found a five-minute \"decrease\" in sleep duration near the full moon. No other modification in activity behaviors were reported, and the lead scientist concluded: \"Our study provides compelling evidence that the moon does not seem to influence people's behavior.\"\n\nCalifornia grunion fish have an unusual mating and spawning ritual during the spring and summer months. The egg laying takes place on four consecutive nights, beginning on the nights of the full and new Moons, when tides are highest. However, this is a well understood reproductive strategy that is more related to tides than it is to lunar phase. It happens to correlate with the lunar phase because tides are highest when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned, i.e., at new Moon or full Moon.\n\nCorrelation between hormonal changes in the testis and lunar periodicity was found in streamlined spinefoot (a type of fish), which spawns synchronously around the last Moon quarter. In orange-spotted spinefoot, lunar phases affect the levels of melatonin in the blood.\n\nEvidence for lunar effect in reptiles, birds and mammals is scant, but among reptiles marine iguanas (which live in the Galápagos Islands) time their trips to the sea in order to arrive at low tide.\n\nIn insects, the lunar cycle may affect hormonal changes early in phylogenesis. The body weight of honeybees peaks during new Moon. The midge \"Clunio marinus\" has a biological clock synchronized with the moon.\n\nSpawning of coral \"Platygyra lamellina\" occurs at night during the summer on a date determined by the phase of the Moon; in the Red Sea, this is the three- to five-day period around the new Moon in July and the similar period in August. \"Acropora\" coral time their simultaneous release of sperm and eggs to just one or two days a year, after sundown with a full moon.\n\nThe Palolo worm that lives in the seas of Indonesia and Polynesia lose the terminal part of their bodies during a waning moon at a certain time of year. These parts float to the surface and release sperm and eggs. The terminal parts are gathered by people as a special food. The event would be predicted by the local priests, and the lunar calendar was set by the event. Because the Palolo adjust their spawning time between October and November, and because of inter-island differences in spawning times, there are factors other than the Moon that control the timing. Such factor may include seawater temperatures, tides, weather, or other biological signals.\n\nA relationship between the moon and the birth rate of cows was reported in a 2016 study.\n\nIn 2000, a retrospective study in the United Kingdom reported an association between the full moon and significant increases in animal bites to humans. The study reported that patients presenting to the A&E with injuries stemming from bites from an animal rose significantly at the time of a full moon in the period 1997-1999. The study concluded that animals have an increased inclination to bite a human during a full moon period.\n\nThe popular belief that the moon has an effect on plants is unsubstantiated. When witnessed, the effects have been indirectly attributed to \"moon gardeners\"' attentive care.\n\nSerious doubts have been raised about the claim that a species of Ephedra synchronizes its pollination peak to the full moon in July.\n\nAs reported on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's \"Gardening Australia\", it is said that ripe passionfruit can drop more around the full moon: \"The full moon effect ... at many full moons we get a really heavy drop of passionfruit, it's an industry wide effect and nobody knows why it happens.\"\n\nBelievers in the lunar theory suggest several different mechanisms by which the behaviour of the Moon could influence the behaviour of human beings. A common suggestion is that, since the Moon affects large bodies of water such as the ocean (a phenomenon known as \"tidal force\"), the Moon should be expected to have an analogous effect on human beings, whose bodies contain a great deal of water. However, this is a misconception that fails to take into account differences in scale. The tidal force is in fact very weak and should be expected to exercise no more gravitational pull on the human body than a mosquito. Besides this, the \"suggestion\" failed to account for the dependence of tides from both the phase of the Moon and the \"time of day\".\n\nBelievers (David Tredinnick being a prominent example) often support their claims by noting that many police officers, teachers, and nurses have observed a lunar effect in the course of their work. To the extent that nurses and police officers do indeed claim to observe patterns, this is most likely to be explained in terms of confirmation bias: People notice if something dramatic happens during a full Moon, but do not notice when nothing dramatic happens; furthermore, dramatic occurrences that do not occur during full Moons are typically not counted as evidence against the belief. Believers are further bolstered in their belief through communal reinforcement: The more people talk about the effect, the more people notice spurious relationships.\n\nFor some 3–4 million years, bipedal hominins in the East African Rift valley were evolving in potential conflict and competition with fearsome carnivores including sabre-toothed cats equipped with excellent night-vision. Using the largest data set ever recorded – 1,000 lion attacks on humans across Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 – Craig Packer and his colleagues showed that there is a peak of attacks by lions upon humans during the evening dark hours following full Moon. According to Packer, this may help explain why so many myths and superstitions attribute fearsome dangers and nightmarish potencies to the Moon. While not all archaeologists accept that lunar periodicity was ever relevant to human evolution, those favouring the idea include Curtis Marean, who heads excavations at the important Middle Stone Age site of Pinnacle Point, South Africa. Marean argues that anatomically modern humans around 165,000 years ago – when inland regions of the continent were dry, arid and uninhabitable – became restricted to small populations clustered around coastal refugia, reliant on marine resources including shellfish whose safe harvesting at spring low tides presupposed careful tracking of lunar phase. Against this background, if Marean is right, humans who ignored or misread the Moon might frequently have been drowned.\n\nA further suggestion is that positive ions increase in abundance during a full Moon and that this should be expected to influence human behavior. However, this is a pseudo-scientific claim. Not only is the increase in frequency extremely slight (much smaller than that caused by air conditioning and air pollution), but ionic charge – positive or negative – has no effect on human behavior, and no physiological effect other than static electric shock.\n\nStudies have shown that with regard to certain types of depression such as seasonal affective disorder (SAD), negative air ionization therapy has no statistically significant benefits beyond placebo. Moreover, such treatments require ionization many orders of magnitude greater than any differences produced by the lunar cycle, and there are superior effects found by using similar treatments with bright light instead of ion generators.\n\nAnother theory is that in the history in human conflict, the thought is that if a group were to launch a night time attack, it would be during a full moon when one could see best.\nDuring World War II, the Allies needed the light of the full moon to conduct night time operations and Native American music exists specifically about full moon wars.\n\n\n\n\n"}

There are two main types of ironwork: wrought iron and cast iron. While the use of iron dates as far back as 4000BC, it was the Hittites who first knew how to extract it (see iron ore) and develop weapons. Use of iron was mainly utilitarian until the Middle Ages, it became widely used for decoration in the period between the 16th and 19th century.\n\nWrought ironwork is forged by a blacksmith using an anvil. The earliest known ironwork are beads from Jirzah in Egypt dating from 3500 BC and made from meteoric iron with the earliest use of smelted iron dates back to Mesopotamia. However, the first use of conventional smelting and purification techniques that modern society labels as true iron-working dates back to the Hittites in around 2000 BC.\n\nKnowledge about the use of iron spread from the Middle East to Greece and the Aegean region by 1000BC and had reached western and central Europe by 600BC. However, its use was primarily utilitarian for weapons and tools before the Middle Ages. Due to rusting, very little remains of early ironwork.\n\nFrom the medieval period, use of ironwork for decorative purposes became more common. Iron was used to protect doors and windows of valuable places from attack from raiders and was also used for decoration as can be seen at Canterbury Cathedral, Winchester Cathedral and Notre Dame de Paris. Armour also was decorated, often simply but occasionally elaborately.\n\nFrom the 16th century onwards, ironwork became highly ornate especially in the Baroque and Rococo periods. In Spain, elaborate screens of iron or rejería were built in all of the Spanish cathedrals rising up to nine metres high.\n\nIn France, highly decorative iron balconies, stair railings and gateways were highly fashionable from 1650. Jean Tijou brought the style to England and examples of his work can be seen at Hampton Court and St Paul's Cathedral. Wrought ironwork was widely used in the UK during the 18th in gates and railings in London and towns such as Oxford and Cambridge. In the US, ironwork features more prominently in New Orleans than elsewhere due to its French influence.\n\nAs iron became more common, it became widely used for cooking utensils, stoves, grates, locks, hardware and other household uses. From the beginning of the 19th century, wrought iron was being replaced by cast iron due to the latter's lower cost. However, the English Arts and Crafts movement produced some excellent work in the middle of the 19th century.\n\nIn modern times, much modern wrought work is done using the air hammer and the acetylene torch. A number of modern sculptors have worked in iron including Pablo Picasso, Julio González and David Smith.\n\nCast iron is produced in a furnace stoked with alternate layers of coking iron then poured into molds. After the iron cools off, the sand is cleaned off. The Chinese were the first to use cast iron from the 6th century AD using it as support for pagodas and other buildings.\n\nIt was introduced into Europe by the 14th century with its main decorative uses being as firebacks and plates for woodburning stoves in Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia. By the end of the 18th century, cast iron was increasingly used for railings, balconies, banisters and garden furniture due to its lower cost.\n\n\n\n\n"}

However his friends, who were not invited, feel envious and decide to prevent Bugs from getting to his birthday party. By the time Bugs reaches his house, it turns out that his friends were playing tricks on him to stall him until they got his party ready.\n\nThe game is a side-scrolling adventure game where players control Bugs Bunny on a quest to get to his 50th birthday party. He is armed with a mallet that he can swing at various enemies to defeat them, deflect certain projectiles or destroy bricks. He can also collect hearts to restore his health and carrots for bonus points. He can also land on top of enemies without getting damaged. At the end of most levels, Bugs Bunny has to use his mallet to defeat a Warner Brothers cartoon character such as Foghorn Leghorn, Sylvester, or the Tasmanian Devil. These other Looney Tunes characters are trying to stop Bugs because they are all jealous that Bugs gets all the attention. Many of them can be damaged with the mallet or their own projectiles but others like Daffy Duck can only be avoided in order to reach a carrot that takes him to the next level. Despite appearing on the cover Porky Pig does not appear in the game. The gameplay is very similar to \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", another game for NES.\n\nAt the end of each level Bugs can play a minigame which allows him to earn extra lives. The total amount he can earn is 99.\n\nDespite the name on the packaging, the North American and European releases retain the game's Japanese title on the game's title screen, Happy Birthday Bugs.\n\nSpanish magazine \"Super Juegos\" gave the game 72.6. Brazilian magazine \"VideoGame\" gave the game four out of five stars. French magazine \"Joypad\" gave the game 80%. Italian magazine \"Consolemania\" gave it 77.\n"}

GRID was first mentioned in a May 11, 1982 article in the \"New York Times\". In this article, the initialism \"A.I.D.\" (acquired immunodeficiency disease) is also mentioned. In the early days of the disease (i.e., 1982–1985), the term \"gay plague\" was also used, while similar terms were used for associated conditions later recognized as AIDS-defining clinical conditions, such as \"gay cancer\" for Kaposi's sarcoma and \"gay pneumonia\" for \"Pneumocystis\" pneumonia.\n\nThe term GRID was never used in the scientific biomedical literature. In the popular press, it was only used for a very short period of time. On August 8, 1982, the acronym AIDS (for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) first appeared in the \"New York Times\". It was initially styled as A.I.D.S. The reason for the GRID-to-AIDS change in nomenclature was the realization that the \"gay\" attribution did not fully encompass the demographics of the disease. The use of GRID and \"gay-related immune deficiency\" in the popular literature reached a peak in 1995; the terms have rapidly sunk into obsolescence subsequently.\n\nOne reason for the use of \"gay\" in the disease name was that the first recognized cases of AIDS were restricted to gay men, who represented a marginalized group that could be easily further stigmatized. Another reason may have to do with the tendency of people in Western societies to seek meaning in diseased states. This phenomenon was recognized by Susan Sontag as a form of punishment, and in her book \"Illness as Metaphor\", she wrote: \"Nothing is more punitive than to give a disease a meaning\". The third reason for the emphasis on sexual orientation may be due to the belief in the Just World Hypothesis, i.e., the claim that we live in a world where people generally get what they deserve. According to this world view, the roots of an affliction must be sought in the victim; as with women who have been raped who must be guilty of seductive behavior, so the reason for AIDS must be that those afflicted are guilty of immoral acts.\n\n"}

{"id": "2319826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319826", "title": "Eli Lilly", "text": "Eli Lilly\n\nEli Lilly (July 8, 1838 – June 6, 1898) was an American soldier, pharmacist, chemist, and businessman who founded the Eli Lilly and Company pharmaceutical corporation. Lilly enlisted in the Union Army during the American Civil War and recruited a company of men to serve with him in the 18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery. He was later promoted to major and then colonel, and was given command of the 9th Regiment Indiana Cavalry. Lilly was captured in September 1864 and held as a prisoner of war until January 1865. After the war, he attempted to run a plantation in Mississippi, but it failed and he returned to his pharmacy profession after the death of his first wife. Lilly remarried and worked with business partners in several pharmacies in Indiana and Illinois before opening his own business in 1876 in Indianapolis. Lilly's company manufactured drugs and marketed them on a wholesale basis to pharmacies. Lilly's pharmaceutical firm proved to be successful and he soon became wealthy after making numerous advances in medicinal drug manufacturing. Two of the early advances he pioneered were creating gelatin capsules to contain medicines and developing fruit flavorings. Eli Lilly and Company became one of the first pharmaceutical firms of its kind to staff a dedicated research department and put into place numerous quality-assurance measures.\n\nUsing his wealth, Lilly engaged in numerous philanthropic pursuits. He turned over the management of the company to his son, Josiah K. Lilly, Sr., around 1890 to allow himself more time to continue his involvement in charitable organizations and civic advancement. Colonel Lilly helped found the Commercial Club, the forerunner to the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, and became the primary patron of Indiana's branch of the Charity Organization Society. He personally funded a children's hospital in Indianapolis, known as Eleanor Hospital (closed in 1909). Lilly continued his active involvement with many other organizations until his death from cancer in 1898.\n\nColonel Lilly was an advocate of federal regulation of the pharmaceutical industry, and many of his suggested reforms were enacted into law in 1906, resulting in the creation of the Food and Drug Administration. He was also among the pioneers of the concept of prescriptions, and helped form what became the common practice of giving addictive or dangerous medicines only to people who had first seen a physician. The company he founded has since grown into one of the largest and most influential pharmaceutical corporations in the world, and the largest corporation in Indiana. Using the wealth generated by the company, his son, J. K., and grandsons, Eli Jr. and Josiah Jr. (Joe), established the Lilly Endowment in 1937; it remains as one of the largest charitable benefactors in the world and continues the Lilly legacy of philanthropy.\n\nEli Lilly, the son of Gustavus and Esther Lilly, was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 8, 1838. His family was of Swedish descent and had moved to the low country of France before his great-grandparents immigrated to Maryland in 1789. When Eli, the first of eleven children, was still an infant, the family moved to Kentucky, where they eventually settled on a farm near Warsaw in Gallatin County.\n\nIn 1852 the family settled at Greencastle, Indiana, where Lilly's parents enrolled him at Indiana Asbury University (later known as DePauw University). Eli attended classes from 1852 to 1854. He also assisted at a local printing press as a printer's devil. Lilly grew up in a Methodist household, and his family was prohibitionist and anti-slavery; their beliefs served as part of their motivation for moving to Indiana. Lilly and his family were members of the Democratic Party during his early life, but they became Republicans during the years leading up to the Civil War.\n\nLilly became interested in chemicals as a teen. In 1854, while on a trip to visit his aunt and uncle in Lafayette, Indiana, the sixteen-year-old Lilly visited Henry Lawrence's Good Samaritan Drug Store, a local apothecary shop, where he watched Lawrence prepare pharmaceutical drugs. Lilly completed a four-year apprenticeship with Lawrence to become a chemist and pharmacist. In addition to learning to mix chemicals, Lawrence taught Lilly how to manage funds and operate a business. In 1858, after earning a certificate of proficiency from his apprenticeship, Lilly left the Good Samaritan to work for Israel Spencer and Sons, a wholesale and retail druggist in Lafayette, before moving to Indianapolis to take a position at the Perkins and Coons Pharmacy.\n\nLilly returned to Greencastle in 1860 to work in Jerome Allen's drugstore. He opened his own drugstore in the city in January 1861, and married Emily Lemon, the daughter of a Greencastle merchant, on January 31, 1861. During the early years of their marriage the couple resided in Greenfield. The couple's son, Josiah Kirby, later called \"J. K.\", was born on November 18, 1861, while Eli was serving in the military during the American Civil War.\n\nIn 1861, a few months after the start of the American Civil War, Lilly enlisted in the Union Army. He joined the 21st Indiana Infantry Regiment and mustered into service on July 24. Lilly was commissioned as a second lieutenant on July 29, 1861. On August 3, the 21st Indiana reached Baltimore, Maryland, where it remained for several months. Lilly resigned his commission in December 1861 and returned to Indiana to form an artillery unit.\n\nIn early 1862 Lilly actively recruited volunteers for his unit among his classmates, friends, local merchants and farmers. He had recruitment posters created and posted them around Indianapolis, promising to form the \"crack battery of Indiana\". His unit, the 18th Battery, Indiana Light Artillery, was known as the Lilly Battery and consisted of six, three-inch ordinance rifles and 150 men. Lilly was commissioned as a captain in the unit. The 18th Indiana mustered into service at Camp Morton in Indianapolis on August 6, 1862, and spent a brief time drilling before it was sent into battle under Major General William Rosecrans in Kentucky and Tennessee. Lilly's artillery unit was transferred to the Lightning Brigade, a mounted infantry under the command of Colonel, later General, John T. Wilder on December 16, 1862.\n\nLilly was elected to serve as the commanding officer of his battery from August 1862 until the winter of 1863, when his three-year enlistment expired. His only prior military experience had been in a Lafayette, Indiana, militia unit. Several of his artillerymen considered him too young and intemperate to command; however, despite his initial inexperience, Lilly became a competent artillery officer. His battery was instrumental in several important battles, including the Battle of Hoover's Gap in June 1863 and in the Second Battle of Chattanooga and the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863.\n\nIn 1864, when Lilly's term of enlistment ended, he resigned his commission and left the 18th Indiana. Lilly joined the 9th Indiana Cavalry (121st Regiment Indiana Volunteers) and was promoted to major. At the Battle of Sulphur Creek Trestle in Alabama in September 1864, he was captured by Confederate troops under the command of Major General Nathan B. Forrest and held in a prisoner-of-war camp at Enterprise, Mississippi until his release in a prisoner exchange in January 1865. Lilly was promoted to colonel on June 4, 1865, and was stationed at Vicksburg, Mississippi, in the spring of 1865 when the war ended. In recognition of his service, he was brevetted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and mustered out of service with the 9th Indiana Cavalry on August 25, 1865.\n\nIn later life Lilly obtained a large atlas and marked the path of his movements in the war and the location of battles and skirmishes. He often used the atlas when telling war stories. His colonel's title stayed with him for the rest of his life, and his friends and family used it as a nickname for him. Lilly served as chairman of the Grand Army of the Republic, a brotherhood of Union Civil War veterans, in 1893. During his term he helped organize an event that brought tens of thousands of Union war veterans, including Lilly's battery, together in Indianapolis for a reunion and a large parade.\n\nAfter the war, Lilly remained in the South to begin a new business venture. Lilly and his business partner leased a cotton plantation in Mississippi. Lilly traveled to Greencastle, Indiana, and returned with his wife, Emily, his sister, Anna Wesley Lilly, and son, Josiah. Shortly after the move the entire family was stricken with a mosquito-borne disease, probably malaria, that was common in the region at that time. Although the others recovered, Emily died on August 20, 1866, eight months pregnant with a second son, who was stillborn. The death devastated Lilly; he wrote to his family, \"I can hardly tell you how it glares at me ...it's a bitter, bitter truth ... Emily is indeed dead.\" Lilly abandoned the farm and returned to Indiana. The plantation fell into disrepair and a drought caused its cotton crop to fail. Lilly's business partner, unable to maintain the plantation because of the drought, disappeared with the venture's remaining cash. Lilly was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1868.\n\nLilly worked to resolve the situation on the plantation and find other employment while his young son, Josiah, lived with Colonel Lilly's parents in Greencastle. In 1867, Lilly found work at the Harrison Daily and Company, a wholesale drug firm. In 1869, he began working for Patterson, Moore and Talbott, another medicinal wholesale company, before he moved to Illinois to establish a new business. In 1869, Lilly left Indiana to open a drugstore with James W. Binford, his business partner. Binford and Lilly opened The Red Front Drugstore in Paris, Illinois, in August 1869.\n\nIn November 1869, Colonel Lilly married Maria Cynthia Sloan. Soon after their marriage they sent for his son, Josiah, who was still living in Greencastle, to join them in Illinois. Eli and Maria's only child, a daughter named Eleanor, was born on January 25, 1871, and died of diphtheria in 1884 at the age of thirteen. Maria died in 1932.\n\nAlthough the business in Illinois was profitable and allowed Lilly to save money, he was more interested in medicinal manufacturing than running a pharmacy. Lilly began formulating a plan to create a medicinal wholesale company of his own. Lilly left the partnership with Binford in 1873 to return to Indianapolis, where, on January 1, 1874, he and John F. Johnston opened a drug manufacturing operation called Johnston and Lilly. Three years later, on March 27, 1876, Lilly dissolved the partnership. His share of the assets amounted to an estimated $400 in merchandise (several pieces of equipment and a few gallons of unmixed chemicals) and about $1,000 in cash.\n\nWhen Lilly approached Augustus Keifer, a wholesale druggist and family friend, for a job, Keifer encouraged Lilly to established his own drug manufacturing business in Indianapolis. Keifer and two associated drugstores agreed to purchase their drugs from Lilly at a cost lower than they were currently paying.\n\nOn May 10, 1876, Lilly opened his own laboratory in a rented two-story building (now demolished) at 15 West Pearl Street and began to manufacture drugs. The sign for the business said \"Eli Lilly, Chemist\". Lilly's manufacturing venture began with $1,400 ($ in 2015 chained dollars) in working capital and three employees: Albert Hall (chief compounder), Caroline Kruger (bottler and product finisher), and Lilly's fourteen-year-old son, Josiah, who had quit school to work with his father as an apprentice.\n\nLilly's first innovation was gelatin-coated pills and capsules. Other early innovations included fruit flavorings and sugarcoated pills, which made medicines easier to swallow. Following his experience with the low-quality medicines used in the Civil War, Lilly committed himself to producing only high-quality prescription drugs, in contrast to the common and often ineffective patent medicines of the day. One of the first medicines he began to produce was quinine, a drug used to treat malaria, that resulted in a \"ten fold\" increase in sales. Lilly products gained a reputation for quality and became popular in the city. At the end of 1876, his first year of business, sales reached $4,470 ($ in 2015 chained dollars), and by 1879 they had grown to $48,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars).\n\nAs sales expanded rapidly he began to acquire customers outside of Indiana. Lilly hired his brother, James, as his first full-time salesman in 1878. James, and the subsequent sales team that developed, marketed the company's drugs nationally. Other family members were also employed by the growing company; Lilly's cousin Evan Lilly was hired as a bookkeeper and his grandsons, Eli and Josiah (Joe), were hired to run errands and perform other odd jobs. In 1881 Lilly formally incorporated the firm as Eli Lilly and Company, elected a board of directors, and issued stock to family members and close associates. By the late 1880s Colonel Lilly had become one of the Indianapolis area's leading businessmen, with a company of more than one hundred employees and $200,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars) in annual sales.\nTo accommodate his growing business, Lilly acquired additional facilities for research and production. Lilly's business remained at the Pearl Street location from 1876 to 1878, then moved to larger quarters at 36 South Meridian. In 1881 he purchased a complex of buildings at McCarty and Alabama Streets, south of downtown Indianapolis, and moved the company to its new headquarters. Other businesses followed and the area developed into a major industrial and manufacturing district of the city. In the early 1880s the company also began making its first, widely-successful product, called Succus Alteran (a treatment for venereal disease, types of rheumatism, and skin diseases). Sales of the product provided funds for company research and additional expansion.\n\nBelieving that it would be an advantage for his son to gain a greater technical knowledge, Lilly sent Josiah to the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in 1880. Upon returning to the family business in 1882, Josiah was named superintendent of the laboratory. In 1890, Lilly turned over the day-to day management of the business to Josiah, who ran the company for thirty-four years. The company flourished despite the tumultuous economic conditions in the 1890s. In 1894, Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company made several technological advances in the manufacturing process, including the automation of capsule production. Over the next few years, the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.\n\nAlthough there were many other small pharmaceutical companies in the United States, Eli Lilly and Company distinguished itself from the others by having a permanent research staff, inventing superior techniques for the mass production of medicinal drugs, and forcusing on quality. At first, Lilly was the company's only researcher, but as the business grew, he established a research laboratory and employed others who were dedicated to creating new drugs. Lilly hired his first full-time research chemist, Ernest G. Eberhards, and botanist, Walter H. Evans, in 1886. The department's methods of research were based on Lilly's. He insisted on quality assurance and instituted mechanisms to ensure that the drugs being produced would be effective and perform as advertised, had the correct combination of ingredients, and had the correct dosages of medicines in each pill. He was aware of the addictive and dangerous nature of some of his drugs, and pioneered the concept of giving such drugs only to people who had first seen a physician to determine if they needed the medicine.\n\nBy the time of his retirement from his business, around 1890, Lilly was a millionaire who had been involved in civic affairs for several years. Later in life he had become increasingly more philanthropic, granting funds to charitable groups in the city.\n\nIn 1879, with a group of twenty-five other businessmen, Lilly began sponsoring the Charity Organization Society and soon became the primary patron of its Indiana chapter. The society merged with other charitable organizations to form the Family Welfare Society of Indianapolis, a forerunner to the Family Service Association of Central Indiana and the United Way. The associated group organized charitable groups under a central leadership structure that allowed them to easily interact and better assist people by coordinating their efforts and identifying areas with the greatest need.\n\nLilly was especially interested in encouraging economic growth and general development in Indianapolis. He attempted to achieve those goals by supporting local commercial organizations financially and through his personal advocacy and promotion. In 1879 he made a proposal for a public water company to meet the needs of the city, which lead to the formation of the Indianapolis Water Company.\n\nIn 1890, Lilly and other civic leaders founded the Commercial Club; Lilly was elected as its first president. The club, renamed the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce in 1912, was the primary vehicle for Lilly's city development goals. It was instrumental in making numerous advances for the city, including citywide paved streets, elevated railways to allow vehicles and people to pass beneath them, and a city sewage system. The companies that provided these services were created through private and public investments and operated at low-cost; in practice they belonged to the companies' customers, who slowly bought each company back from its initial investors. The model was later followed other regions of Indiana to establish water and electric utility companies. The Commercial Club members also helped fund the creation of parks, monuments, and memorials, as well as successfully attracted investment from other businessmen and organizations to expand Indianapolis's growing industries.\n\nAfter the Gas Boom began to sweep the state in the 1880s, Lilly and other Commercial Club members advocated the creation of a public corporation to pump natural gas from the ground, pipe it to Indianapolis from the Trenton Gas Field, and provide it at low cost to businesses and homes. The project led to the creation of the Consumer Gas Trust Company, which Lilly named. The gas company provided low-cost heating fuel that made urban living much more desirable. The gas was further used to create electricity to run Indianapolis's first public transportation venture, a streetcar system.\n\nDuring the Panic of 1893, Lilly created a commission to help provide food and shelter to the poor people who were adversely affected. His work with the commission led him to make a personal donation of funds and property to the Flower Mission of Indianapolis in 1895. Lilly's substantial donation allowed it to establish Eleanor Hospital, a children's hospital in Indianapolis named in honor of his deceased daughter. The hospital cared for children from families who had no money to pay for routine medical care; it closed in 1909.\n\nLilly's friends often urged him to seek public office, and they attempted to nominate him to run for Governor of Indiana as a Republican in 1896, but he refused. Lilly shunned public office, preferring to focus his attention on his philanthropic organizations. He did regularly endorse candidates, and made substantial donations to politicians who advanced his causes. After former Indiana governor Oliver P. Morton and others suggested the creation of a memorial to Indiana's many Civil War veterans, Lilly began raising funds to build the Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. Construction began in 1888, but the monument was not completed until 1901, three years after Lilly's death. The interior of the monument houses a civil war museum, established in 1918, that is named in Lilly's honor.\n\nColonel Lilly's main resident was a large home in Indianapolis on Tennessee Street (renamed Capitol Street in 1895), where he spent most of his time. Lilly, an avid fisherman, built a family vacation cottage on Lake Wawasee in Kosciusko County, Indiana, in 1886–87. He had enjoyed regular vacations and recreation at the lake since the early 1880s. Lilly also founded the Wawasee Golf Club in 1891. Lilly's lakeside property became a haven for the family. His son, Josiah, built his own cottage on the estate in the mid-1930s.\n\nLilly developed cancer in 1897 and died in his Indianapolis home on June 6, 1898. His funeral was held on June 9 and attended by thousands. His remains are interred in a large mausoleum at Indianapolis's Crown Hill Cemetery.\n\nAt the time of Lilly's death in 1898, his company had a product line of 2,005 items and annual sales of more than $300,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars). His son, Josiah, inherited the company following his father's death, and became its president in 1898. Josiah continued to expand its operations before passing it on to his own sons, Eli Jr. and Josiah Jr. (Joe).\n\nLilly's son and two grandsons, as well as the Lilly company, continued the philanthropic efforts that Lilly practiced. Eli Lilly and Company played an important role in delivering medicine to the victims of the devastating 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In 1937 Lilly's son and grandsons established the Lilly Endowment, which became the largest philanthropic endowment in the world in terms of assets and charitable giving in 1998. (Other endowments have since surpassed it, but it still remains among the top ten.)\n\nLilly's firm grew into one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Under the leadership of Lilly's son, Josiah (J. K.) and two grandsons, Eli and Joe, it developed many new innovations, including the pioneering and development of insulin during the 1920s, the mass production of penicillin during the 1940s, and the promotion of advancements in mass-produced medicines. Innovation continued at the company after it was made a publicly traded corporation in 1952; it developed Humulin, Merthiolate, Prozac, and many other medicines. According to Forbes, Eli Lilly and Company ranked as the 243rd largest company in the world in 2016, with sales of $20 billion and a market value of $86 billion (USD). It is the largest corporation and the largest charitable benefactor in Indiana.\n\nLilly's greatest contributions to the industry were his standardized and methodical production of drugs, his dedication to research and development, and the therapeutic value of the drugs he created. As a pioneer in the modern pharmaceutical industry, many of his innovations later became standard practice. Lilly's ethical reforms, in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines, began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs. During his lifetime, Lilly had advocated for federal regulation on medicines; his son, Josiah, continued that advocacy following his father's death.\n\nThe Colonel Eli Lilly Civil War Museum, located beneath the Sailors' and Soldiers' Monument in Indianapolis, is named in Lilly's honor. It features exhibits about Indiana during the war period and the war in general.\n\nColonel Lilly is featured in the Indiana Historical Society exhibition, \"You Are There: \"Eli Lilly at the Beginning\",\" at the Eugene and Marilyn Glick Indiana History Center in Indianapolis. The temporary exhibition (October 1, 2016, to January 20, 2018) includes a recreation of the first Lilly laboratory on Pearl Street in Indianapolis and a costumed interpreter portraying Lilly.\n\n\n\n"}

His uncle was Francis Rawdon Chesney, his younger brother was General George Tomkyns Chesney, and his older sister was the writer Matilda Marian Pullan.\n\nHe was educated at Blundell's School, Tiverton, and afterwards at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he obtained his first commission as second lieutenant of engineers in 1845, passing out of the academy at the head of his term.\n\nChesney's early military service was spent in the ordinary course of regimental duty at home and abroad, and he was stationed in New Zealand during the Crimean War. Among the various reforms in the British military system which followed from that war was the impetus given to military education; and in 1858 Captain Chesney was appointed professor of military history at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.\n\nIn 1864, he succeeded Colonel (afterwards Sir) Edward Bruce Hamley in the corresponding chair at the Staff College. The writings of these two brilliant officers had a great influence not only at home, but on Continental Europe and the United States. Chesney's first published work (1863) was an account of the American Civil War in Virginia, which went through several editions. But the work which attained the greatest reputation was his \"Waterloo Lectures\" (1868), prepared from the notes of lectures orally delivered at the Staff College.\n\nUp to that time the English literature on the Waterloo campaign, although voluminous, was made up of personal reminiscences or of formal records, useful materials for history rather than history itself; and the French accounts had mainly taken the form of fiction. In Chesney's lucid and vigorous account of the momentous struggle, while it illustrates both the strategy and tactics which culminated in the final catastrophe, the mistakes committed by Napoleon I of France are laid bare, and for the first time an English writer is found to point out that the dispositions of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington were far from faultless. And in the \"Waterloo Lectures\" the Prussians are for the first time credited by an English pen with their proper share in the victory. The work attracted much attention abroad as well as at home, and French and German translations were published.\n\nChesney was for many years a constant contributor to the newspaper press and to periodic literature, devoting himself for the most part to the critical treatment of military operations, and professional subjects generally. Some of his essays on military biography, contributed mainly to the \"Edinburgh Review\", were afterwards published separately in 1874. In 1868 he was appointed a member of the Royal Commission on Military Education, under the presidency first of Earl de Grey and afterwards of Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, to whose recommendations were due the improved organization of the military colleges, and the development of military education in the principal military stations of the British army.\n\nIn 1871, on the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian War, he was sent on a special mission to the French Third Republic and the German Empire, and furnished to the government a series of valuable reports on the different siege operations which had been carried out during the war, especially the two sieges of Paris. These reports were published in a large volume, which was issued confidentially.\n\nHe was appointed lieutenant-colonel in 1873, and at the time of his death he was commanding Royal Engineer of the London district. \n\nChesney was abstemious to a fault; and, overwork of mind and body telling at last on a frail constitution, he died on 19 March 1876 following a short illness. He was buried at Sandhurst.\n\nNever seeking regimental or staff preferment, Colonel Chesney never obtained any, but he held at the time of his death a unique position in the army, altogether apart from and above his actual place in it. He was consulted by officers of all grades on professional matters, and few have done more to raise the intellectual standard of the British officer. Constantly engaged in literary pursuits, he was nevertheless laborious and exemplary in the discharge of his public duties, while managing also to devote a large part of his time to charitable and religious offices.\n\n\n"}

In addition to playing for Canada's under-18 team in 2003, he spent two seasons as the captain of the Océanic. His final junior year was spent on a line with Sidney Crosby. Although naturally a centre, Pouliot switched to left-wing to allow Crosby to play his natural position.\n\nAfter a relatively successful training camp with the Oilers, Pouliot was assigned to the Hamilton Bulldogs of the American Hockey League (AHL) where he made his professional debut. The Edmonton Oilers called him up to their team on March 13, 2006 and Pouliot was set to play on March 18, 2006 against the Red Wings, but was scratched when forward Ethan Moreau returned from a sprained ankle.

In 1844, his father, Col. E. A. Rhodes, was appointed United States Consul to Texas. Rhodes was then just budding into manhood. Possessing a great ambition, and a mind superior to his companions, he became a leader among the young men of Galveston, where his father was located in his office as Consul. Here he gathered around him an Association of young men, whose zealous natures were congenial to his lofty ambition\n\nIn 1844, he entered Harvard law school, where he remained for two years. After he completed his study at Harvard he returned to Galveston, where he entered upon the practice of his profession. In 1847 he was elevated to a Probate Judgeship. He filled this office with distinction for one term, at the close of which he returned to his native state and entered upon the practice of his profession. He remained in North Carolina but a short time when he caught the inspiration of adventure in the new El Dorado, and sailed for California.\n\nOn July 2, 1869, Rhodes was invited to the first powered flight in America at San Jose's Shellmount Park racetrack. The flight was of an unmanned, steam powered dirigible operated by Frederick Marriott.\n\n\"The Case of Summerfield\" was published in the Sacramento Union newspaper in 1871 and included a character named Black Bart which later became the alias for Charles Bolles. At the time of its publication, this story was the talk of the town more for the concept of being able to set water on fire then for the idea of Black Bart. It was the story's villain, however, that caught Charles Bolles' attention and he later used the intimidating name which would be familiar to many in California as an alias in his poems left behind at crime scenes.\n\nRhodes was buried in Laurel Hill, California with his wife and daughter.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2319839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319839", "title": "Dark Island", "text": "Dark Island\n\nDark Island, a prominent feature of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, is located in the lower (eastern) Thousand Islands region, near Chippewa Bay. It is a part of the Town of Hammond, in St. Lawrence County, New York.\n\nAn historic landmark on the island, \"The Towers\", was long known as \"Dark Island Castle\" until recently renamed \"Singer Castle\". The island is situated only a few yards south of the Canada-United States border that runs along the river.\n\nThe Castle features 28 bedrooms, bathrooms, a large Drawing Room, library, and kitchen. Within the walls is a network of secret passageways that are accessible from various locations, one of which is a panel in the library that, at one time, could be opened by pulling a specific book from a nearby shelf, triggering the locking mechanism.\n\nThe south side of the island is only about one hundred feet from the shipping channel, and cargo ships frequently pass the island. Because of the depth of the channel on one side, and the relative shallowness on the other, it is very good for sport fishing of largemouth bass and northern pike.\n\nMost of the architectural work at Dark Island is attributed to the prominent American architect Ernest Flagg. His client was Frederick Gilbert Bourne, president of the Singer Manufacturing Company (now the Singer Corporation), producer of the Singer Sewing Machine. His daughter, Marjorie Bourne Thayer, made large additions in 1928. Flagg also designed the skyscraper headquarters for the company in New York City, the tallest building in the world at the time. Flagg is known for many major American projects, such as the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nThe island's castle was the last of several \"castles\" built at the Thousand Islands during a brief interval (1888–1905). Bourne undertook the project while the larger Boldt Castle was nearing completion nearby. The architect modeled the stone structure, planned in 1903, on a castle in Woodstock, England that was described in Sir Walter Scott's book \"Woodstock\".\n\nFollowing the 1919 death of Frederick Bourne, his daughter Marjorie (Mrs. Alexander D. Thayer) took title to the property. Her ownership was contested by a brother, but she retained title.\n\nUpon her death, the Roman Catholic order Brothers of the Christian Schools (the Christian Brothers) acquired Dark Island along with the large Bourne country house, Indian Neck Hall at Oakdale on Long Island, which thereafter became LaSalle Military Academy. Having little use for the remote island in the St. Lawrence River, the Christian Brothers sold Dark Island in 1965 for approximately US$5,000, to be used thereafter by a charitable organization of religious character, the Harold Martin Evangelistic Association.\n\nThe previous tax-exempt status of the property was contested by neighbors after occupancy by the new owner. They contended that Dr. Harold Martin, director of the charity, maintained the tax-exempt property for his own private use as a summer residence. Martin prevailed in court, on the basis that he and his wife, Eloise, offered a religious service on the island every Sunday morning, open to all. During this Martin interval, the property was called \"Jorstadt Castle,\" from Dr. Harold Martin's family surname before immigrating from Norway. The castle's name has since been changed to \"Singer Castle.\"\n\nAfter more than thirty years of Martin tenure, removal, sometimes due to theft, depleted the original contents. Due to the high cost of maintenance, a number of original fixtures and artifacts fell into disrepair. Rumors about the true use of the property (its new name not identifying any religious or charitable ownership), together with gradual deterioration of the property and stories about a complex maze of dimly lit secret passageways, complete with a dungeon, all increased the romantic mystique of Dark Island.\n\nDuring the later decades of the Martin period (the late 1980s and early 1990s), Dark Island was listed for sale. Advertisements appeared in high-end real estate magazines such as \"Unique Homes\" with suggestions that it be a \"private residence, corporate retreat or hunting lodge.\" Interest came from as far as Japan, but the property remained unsold until acquired in 2001 by Dark Island Tours, Inc., a venture of German businessman Farhad Vladi and two American business partners. Vladi also operates Vladi Private Islands GmbH, real estate company based in Hamburg, Germany that specializes in selling islands.\n\nDark Island Tours, Inc. undertook an extensive campaign of restoration and adaptation in order to open Dark Island to the visiting public. Tours were initiated in 2003. Despite losses over the years, the interior of the castle retains its original character, with most of the Bourne-Thayer furnishings. Unlike nearby Boldt Castle, Dark Island always served as a private residence, until opened to the public for tours.\n\nIn 2006, Dark Island was listed for sale through Sotheby's International Realty for $22 million.\n\nThe castle was featured in the 2000 film, \"The Skulls\"\n\nAn episode of The Great Escape was filmed at Singer Castle but it never aired.\n\nThe Canadian folk rock band Great Lake Swimmers recorded part of their 2009 album \"Lost Channels\" at the castle. The album includes an interlude consisting of 48 seconds of the castle bells chiming.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2319841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319841", "title": "Eli Lilly (industrialist)", "text": "Eli Lilly (industrialist)\n\nEli Lilly (April 1, 1885 – January 24, 1977) was a pharmaceutical industrialist and philanthropist from Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. Under his vision and leadership, Eli Lilly and Company, founded by his grandfather, grew from a successful, family-owned business into a modern corporation and industry leader. Lilly served as the company president (1932–48), chairman of the board of directors (1948–61 and 1966–69), and honorary chairman of the board (1961–66 and 1969–77).\n\nThroughout his long life, Lilly took a personal interest in the history of Indiana and his hometown of Indianapolis. A man of significant personal wealth, whose philanthropic contributions were often given anonymously, Lilly was also modest, quiet, and unassuming. He made substantial gifts and actively supported the work of individuals and groups who shared his passions for archaeology, state and local history, art, religion, education, and civic improvement. In addition to his personal philanthropy, Lilly, with his father, Josiah K. Lilly Sr., and brother, Josiah K. Lilly Jr., established the Lilly Endowment, a philanthropic foundation that continues to support their family's generosity into the twenty-first century. Lilly also wrote, edited, or contributed to published works related to the prehistory of Indiana; Christ Church Cathedral, Indianapolis; the Delaware tribe's chronicle, Walum Olum; Indiana's Lake Wawasee; and archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann. A politically conservative Republican and a lifelong member of the Episcopal church, Lilly's traditional values concerning family, home, and community service guided his work in the pharmaceutical industry and in civic life.\n\nBorn in Indianapolis, Indiana, Eli Lilly was the eldest son of Josiah K. Sr. and Lilly Maria Ridgely Lilly. He was named for his grandfather, Colonel Eli Lilly, who founded Eli Lilly and Company, the family's pharmaceutical business in Indianapolis. Lilly grew up in Indianapolis at 476 North Tennessee Street (renamed Capitol in 1885), eight blocks north of the Indiana Statehouse. Later, the family moved to a larger home on North Pennsylvania Street. The family attended Christ Church, an Episcopal church located on Monument Circle in the city's center, and spent the summer months at their cottage on Lake Wawasee in Kosciusko County, Indiana. At the lake, Lilly enjoyed hiking, fishing, swimming, and sailing.\n\nAfter attending a public elementary school in Indianapolis and one term at Culver Military Academy in northern Indiana, Lilly graduated from Shortridge High School in Indianapolis. He went on to study at his father's alma mater, the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, where he graduated in 1907 with a degree as a pharmaceutical chemist, and returned to Indianapolis to begin his career in the family business.\n\nAccording to his biographer, James H. Madison, \"Lilly was modest, unassuming, and quiet, yet under his placid exterior was an inquiring mind and abundant physical energy\" and a man who \"believed in hard work, all his life.\" As a boy, Lilly worked during school vacations at the family's pharmaceutical plant on McCarty Street in Indianapolis, where he washed bottles and did other tasks. He never thought of working anywhere else.\n\nAfter receiving a college degree in 1907, Lilly joined the family firm as the head and the only employee of the newly created Economic Department, where his job was to explore cost effective and more efficient ways to operate the business. In addition to studying the company's manufacturing processes, Lilly loved mechanical gadgets and introduced new manufacturing equipment to increase production, reduce waste, and improve quality. In 1909 Lilly was promoted to superintendent of the manufacturing division. Within two years he had brought new principles of scientific management to the company to improve efficiency and reward workers for meeting and exceeding production requirements. As the business expanded and modernized in the years preceding World War I, Lilly and his brother, Josiah K. Lilly Jr., continued to work in managerial positions, while their father remained as head of the growing company.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Eli Lilly and Company experienced significant growth and financial success as it expanded research and product development efforts. Lilly was actively involved in major projects that brought the Indianapolis company to the forefront as a top research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer. Insulin, which the company produced and sold under the trade name of Iletin, was the result of a pioneering collaboration with University of Toronto research scientists. In May 1922 Lilly and the company's director of biochemical research, George Henry Alexander Clowes, met in Toronto with J. J. R. Macleod, Frederick G. Banting, and Charles H. Best, the scientists who had discovered insulin as an effective treatment for diabetes. The meeting resulted in an agreement between the university and the Indianapolis manufacturer to mass-produce and distribute the drug. Iletin became the most important drug in the company's history and Banting and Macleod earned the Nobel Prize in 1923 for their groundbreaking work.\n\nLilly's other significant achievements included contributions to improved production and research. He devoted hours to developing a straight-line production system for the company's new Building 22, which was completed in 1926 and improved the company's manufacturing processes. As research expanded and the company introduced new products, including the sedative Amytal, the antiseptic Merthiolate, and other drugs such as ephedrine, Lilly strengthened ties with university scientists by establishing research fellowships at American and European universities. Another successful collaboration, this one with researchers at Harvard University and the University of Rochester for drugs to treat anemia, built on the lessons learned from the insulin project and earned the university scientists, George R. Minot, William P. Murphy, and George Whipple, the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1934.\n\nEli Lilly became president of Eli Lilly and Company on January 26, 1932, and remained at its head until 1948. Lilly showed great management skill and concern for the welfare of his employees. During his tenure as president, the company grew to include 6,912 employees and had sales of $115 million in 1948. While the company expanded operations in Indianapolis and overseas, it established a reputation as a good place to work by providing employee assistance, sound wages, maintaining a positive outlook, and desegregating its workforce. As increased governmental regulations challenged the industry, the U.S. Justice Department investigated Eli Lilly and Company and two other pharmaceutical firms for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, charging them with fixing insulin prices. Legal council advised Lilly to avoid the high costs and negative publicity from an extended lawsuit by pleading \"nolo contendere\", which he did, so the company could move forward.\n\nUnder Lilly's leadership during World War II, the company supported the war effort by producing blood plasma in conjunction with the American Red Cross. It also manufactured encephalitis vaccine, antitoxin for gas poisoning, vaccines for flu and typhus as well as insulin, Merthiolate, and other drugs. Lilly was especially proud of the company's collaboration with the U.S. government and others on large-scale production of penicillin. In the renovated Curtiss-Wright complex on Kentucky Avenue in Indianapolis, Lilly employees were producing more than 250,000 ampules of penicillin per day by the late 1940s.\n\nIn the postwar years, Lilly remained active in company business as it expanded overseas with the construction of a new plant in Basingstoke, England, and supporting research on new drugs. He also reorganized the company, appointing non-family members to top management positions and began the transition to non-family management of the company. Lilly was president of the company from 1932 to 1947. Following the death of his father in 1948, Lilly served as chairman of the board from 1948 to 1961, while his brother, J. K. Lilly Jr., was the company's president, and from 1966 to 1969, when Eugene N. Beesley was elected president. Lilly was honorary chairman from 1961 to 1966 and from 1969 to 1977.\n\nLilly was modest, a man of simple tastes and traditional values. In politics, Lilly was a conservative Republican; however, he was a friend and supporter of Indiana governor Roger D. Branigin, a Democrat, who shared some of Lilly's personal interests. Lilly was especially interested in history and archaeology and enjoyed reading, writing, music, and art. His wealth allowed him to pursue a wide range of philanthropic interests and hobbies, many of which related to Indiana history.\nLilly was also known for his philanthropic activities and as founder of the Indianapolis-based Lilly Endowment Inc. along with his father J. K. Lilly Sr. and his brother J. K. Lilly Jr. In 1937 Lilly with his father and his brother, established the endowment with initial gifts of 17,500 shares of their personal stock in Eli Lilly and Company, valued at $280,000, and made additional financial gifts through 1971. In total, their combined gifts were 32 million shares of pharmaceutical stock, valued at $94 million, with several non-family members contributing additional shares of stock worth an estimated $1.1 million. Lilly served as the Lilly Endowment's secretary/treasurer from 1937 to 1966, as its president from 1966 to 1972, as chairman 1972 to 1975, and as honorary chairman from 1975 to 1977. As of December 31, 2011, the Lilly Endowment \"held $6.2 billion in unrestricted assets\" and \"approved $208.7 million in new grants\" to support \"community development, education and religion.\"\n\nFor Lilly, philanthropy was \"personal, thoughtful, and ambitious.\" He favored areas that interested him personally and took an active leadership role in a number of organizations that he supported financially, but \"his was never a selfish, self-centered philanthropy.\" Lilly's donations were often anonymous. Lilly chose projects related to archaeology, history, historic preservation, education, and religion, especially when they were connected to Indiana and Indianapolis.\n\nLilly's fascination with prehistoric archaeology grew from a collector of artifacts into a serious academic interest. Lilly's own research and writing, as well as his financial support, helped establish the study of archaeology in Indiana. Lilly was especially interested in archaeological research and compiled a bibliography on the subject, published in 1932. For years Lilly quietly and modestly supported archaeological fieldwork, site surveys, and excavations. In addition, Lilly became a close friend and patron of archaeologist Glenn Albert Black, who found work in the Indiana Historical Society's archaeology division. Lilly funded Black's salary and field expenses. Lilly also provided fellowships to Yale University and other colleges to support archaeological studies. Scholars Charles (Carl) F. Voegelin and his wife, Erminie Wheeler-Voegelin, were both recipients of Lilly's archaeology fellowships from Yale.\n\nLilly's contribution to the archaeological work at Angel Mounds in southern Indiana was longstanding. In 1938, when funds could not be obtained elsewhere, Lilly provided the Indiana Historical Society with $68,000 of the $71,957 needed to purchase the state's most important archaeological site and save it from real estate development. Lilly's friend Glenn Black moved to southern Indiana in 1939 to supervise work at the site. Indiana University and the Indiana Historical Society hosted summer school sessions at Angel Mounds from 1945 to 1962 with Lilly Endowment funding and Lilly's sponsorship. In 1967, with Lilly's encouragement and Lilly Endowment funding, the Indiana Historical Society published \"Angel Site: An Archaeological, History, and Ethnological Study\", which was based on Black's research. Lilly also supported the development of an interpretive center and reconstruction of several buildings at Angel Mounds through funding from the Lilly Endowment. As a further tribute to his close friend and their passion for archaeology, Lilly donated his archaeological library and artifact collection to the Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology at Indiana University in Bloomington. The Lilly Endowment provided funds for its construction.\n\nIn 1922 Lilly became a member of the Indiana Historical Society, serving as its president from 1933 to 1946, as executive committee member from 1947 to 1969, and as a member of the board of trustees from 1969 until his death in 1977. Lilly's involvement began with his personal interest in archaeology and friendship with Glenn Black and Christopher Coleman, secretary of the Indiana Historical Society and director of the Indiana Historical Commission. Lilly had a personal as well as financial interest in the affairs of the organization, which included contributions to an endowment in excess of $2.5 million for an addition to the Indiana State Library and Historical Building in Indianapolis that would also house the Indiana Historical Society. Lilly attended dedication ceremonies for the building's four-story expansion in October 1976, a year before his death. Lilly and his brother also subsidized numerous projects and publications, including those related to archaeology, Indiana authors, Walam Olum, the paintings of George Winter, the diaries of Calvin Fletcher, and a Pulitzer Prize–winning history of the Old Northwest, among others. Upon his death, Lilly left the Indiana Historical Society a substantial endowment, making it one of the wealthiest organizations of its kind in the United States.\n\nLilly's personal philanthropy also included contributions to the preservation and restoration of historic houses in Indianapolis and New Harmony, Indiana, and at Shakertown, Kentucky. Lilly, along with other Hoosiers interested in preservation, founded the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana (now Indiana Landmarks) to aid in the preservation of structures significant to the historical and cultural development of Indiana. In 1962 Lilly purchased, restored, and furnished Kemper house, a Victorian home in Indianapolis, saving it from demolition. Later that same year, HLFI purchased a home in the historic Old Northside neighborhood of Indianapolis, which was named the Morris-Butler House for its previous owners, and with Lilly's help restored it to serve as a museum of mid-Victorian decorative arts and preservation education. With Lilly's assistance and a financial gift, the foundation also acquired the historic Huddleston farm in east-central Indiana in 1966 and restored its three-story, Federal-style brick home, which once served as a stop for travelers along the National Road.\n\nLilly also purchased and contributed to the preservation of the William Conner home. His gift, in 1964, of this historic home in Hamilton County, Indiana, to Earlham College led to the development of Conner Prairie, an outdoor, living history museum. Lilly's interest in preservation led to involvement in other projects, including restoration of Crown Hill Cemetery's Waiting Station, the Indianapolis City Market, and the historic Lockerbie Square neighborhood in Indianapolis, among others.\n\nA lifelong resident of Indiana, Lilly was known for his deep affection for his home state. In addition to a primary residence in Indianapolis, Lilly owned three side-by-side large residences on Lake Wawasee in Kosciusko County, Indiana, just north of Our Lady Of The Lake Seminary. An avid sailor, he also assisted with the founding of the Wawassee Yacht Club.\n\nLilly's wealth allowed him to acquire a significant art collection. Although he owned a collection of Paul Revere silver and paintings by artists such as Gilbert Stuart and Maxfield Parrish, Lilly's particular interest was in Chinese art, which he began collecting in the mid-1940s and donated to the Herron Art Museum (now the Indianapolis Museum of Art) in 1960. Lilly also helped with fundraising to construct the museum's new facility, built on the 42-acre estate of his brother. The new building was a point of civic pride for Lilly, who donated $1.7 million in pharmaceutical company stock for its construction and generously provided for the institution in his will.\n\nLilly had a special interest in supporting religious-based, liberal arts colleges in Indiana. Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, where Lilly served as a trustee, was a favorite. Lilly also donated to his alma mater, the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy. Through the Lilly Endowment, Lilly supported at least ten of Indiana's private colleges, including Earlham College, as well as Transylvania University and Berea College in Kentucky. The endowment also provided support for black colleges in the South and the United Negro College Fund. Indiana University, the University of Wisconsin, and later in Lilly's life, Purdue University, also received funding through the Lilly Endowment for special projects of personal interest to Lilly.\n\nA lifelong Episcopalian, Lilly was especially dedicated to Christ Church, the Lilly family's church on Monument Circle in Indianapolis. As a young boy, Lilly sang in the church's choir. Later, he served as a vestryman. Lilly combined his interests in history and the church by writing \"History of the Little Church on the Circle\", published in 1957. Christ Church, as well as the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis, were recipients of several substantial gifts from Lilly for the church's upkeep, missionary work, and community service, provided that Christ Church remained on the Circle in downtown Indianapolis. In the 1960s displeasure with the political activism of Peter Lawson, the dean at Christ Church, caused Lilly to discontinue his financial support and attend services elsewhere; however, he returned to the church and resumed his financial support following Lawson's resignation in 1971.\n\nOn August 29, 1907, Lilly married his high school sweetheart, Evelyn Fortune, and moved to a modest home at 12 East Eleventh Street in Indianapolis. Within a few years they had moved to other houses on Indianapolis's north side, not far from his parents' home. Lilly and his first wife had two sons, one born in 1908 and the other in 1910, but both died in infancy. A daughter, Evelyn (Evie) was born on September 25, 1918. In 1926 the Lilly's marriage ended in divorce. Lilly's ex-wife moved to Massachusetts and was awarded custody of their daughter. Over the years Lilly provided financial support and maintained contact with his daughter, who also spent time with her father in Indianapolis and at Lake Wawasee. Lilly's daughter, who had no children of her own, died of cancer on April 5, 1970.\n\nOn November 7, 1927, Lilly married Ruth Helen Allison, his secretary. The two had worked together for seven years. Lilly was devoted to his second wife and they were married for more than forty-five years. The couple traveled, collected art and antiques, and built an expansive, three-story home in Crows Nest, at 5807 Sunset Lane in Indianapolis, on a portion of his father's 20-acre estate. Lilly used his grandfather's Maryland birthplace as a model for the home's exterior. The Crows Nest neighborhood became one of the most exclusive in Indianapolis. The couple had no children. Ruth died of cancer on March 14, 1973, at the age of 81.\n\nAfter Lilly stepped down as president of Eli Lilly and Company, he had more time to devote to personal interests and was active in community affairs. Still, as chairman of the board, he remained involved in major decisions affecting the company, maintained regular office hours, and kept in contact with senior management. In 1958 the American Pharmaceutical Association awarded Lilly its prestigious Remington Honor Medal.\n\nAs he grew older, Lilly enjoyed reading, music, art collecting, woodworking, traveling, and writing. He also continued to pursue philanthropic interests in archaeology, history, and historic preservation, where he contributed financial support with his own resources as well as those of the Lilly Endowment.\n\nLilly outlived his brother, wife, and daughter as well as many close friends and colleagues. Lilly had good health for most of his life, but in later years his hearing and sight began to fail. Despite these challenges, he continued to socialize, enjoy trips to Lake Wawasee, and attend civic events in Indianapolis. In 1976, when Lilly was in his nineties, he attended the Eli Lilly and Company's 100th anniversary gala.\n\nPrior to his death, Lilly made careful arrangements for the disposition of his estate, which included real estate, company stock, cash, and bonds. When he died, Lilly's estate was estimated at more than $165.7 million, the majority of which continued to support the philanthropic interests of Lilly and his second wife, Ruth. Per Lilly's instructions, funeral arrangements following his death on January 24, 1977, were simple. Several days after Lilly's funeral service and burial at Crown Hill Cemetery, a memorial service was held at Christ Church in Indianapolis.\n\nAs a man of great wealth and numerous interests, Lilly devoted a great deal of time and money in support of organizations involved in history, archaeology, historic preservation, education, and religion in his home state of Indiana. In addition, Lilly took an active role and maintained close personal relationships with leaders in the organizations that he supported financially. While Lilly gave away millions during his lifetime, on his own or through the Lilly Endowment, the bulk of his wealth was distributed following his death in 1977. In addition to his financial contributions to the Lilly Endowment, Lilly was a longtime supporter of archeological research as well as the archaeological work at Angel Mounds in southern Indiana. Lilly also contributed to the establishment of the Glenn A. Black Laboratory at Indiana University in Bloomington, which was dedicated in 1971. In addition, Lilly was supportive of historic preservation efforts in Indiana and at Shakertown, Kentucky. Major benefactors of Lilly's generosity included Indiana University, who received Lilly's home on Sunset Lane in Indianapolis as well as his father's home next door.\n\nFollowing his death, thirteen of Lilly's \"most favored institutions\" received 80 percent of his stock holdings in the pharmaceutical company. Butler University, the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, Christ Church, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Indiana Historical Society, Earlham College, the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, and Wabash College each received 309,904 shares of Eli Lilly and Company stock worth an estimated $13.5 million at the time of his death. Five other institutions each received 123, 961 shares of pharmaceutical stock: Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana, Orchard School Foundation, Park-Tudor Foundation, Saint Pauls Episcopal Church, and Trinity Episcopal Church. In addition, eleven of Ruth Lilly's special interests received the remaining 20 percent of her husband's shares in Eli Lilly and Company stock: the American Committee for Keep, the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, Cooperative for Relief Everywhere, Day Nursery Association of Indianapolis, Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis, Fellowship in Prayer, Save the Children Federation, the Washington Cathedral, and three schools in Georgia, Mississippi, and Kentucky.\n\n\n"}
