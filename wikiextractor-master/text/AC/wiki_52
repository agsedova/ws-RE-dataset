{"id": "2117583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117583", "title": "Radiata Stories", "text": "Radiata Stories\n\n\"Radiata Stories\" places great emphasis on its persistent world and non-player characters (NPCs) each with their own lives, lifestyles, jobs, personalities, homes, dialogues and schedules, which are controlled by the game's Day/Night system.\n\nThe game provides the novel ability to kick almost anything. Kicking furniture and other inanimate objects will occasionally turn up items or dagols (the local currency). Kicking NPCs several times will cause them to fight Jack, or summon guards to fight for or with them. Jack gains experience, money, and possibly items when he wins these duels, but will not lose the game if he is defeated. Jack may only win a duel against each character once each day.\n\nThere is no overworld map during fights. Battles takes place on a separate screen in real time, though monsters appear on the field screen. The player has direct control of Jack's movement and actions in all three dimensions, though bringing up menus pauses the action. Jack is the only character the player controls directly; all other party members are run by the in-game AI. The player can issue commands to individual party members, and the entire party can be ordered into tactical formations via the \"Link System.\"\n\n176 NPCs are recruitable. Some need only to be talked to, while others must be placated with fetch quests, dueled, recruited after Jack or a certain character has reached a certain level, or during certain moments in the game's story. After recruitment, they are placed on his \"Friends List,\" at which point the player may include most of them in Jack's party at almost any time. The Friends List also provides capsule biographies for each character. It is impossible to complete everything during a single playthrough.\n\nNPC party members can strengthen their single skill. However, they do not learn new ones, and cannot be given new weapons, armors and accessories, so skills and equipment are significant criteria in choosing one's teammates. There is also no \"magic\" stat, forcing the player to constantly recruit new party members as magic spells do not increase in power.\n\nDepending on the path the player chooses, they will lose certain characters that they recruited, and characters they didn't recruit will be unrecuitable for the rest of the game. Also, certain areas of the game will be inaccessible.\n\nAfter completing the game, the player may continue playing the same game, unlocking a bonus dungeon, the Dragon Lair Cave. If the player chooses the option \"Strong from Start\", they will retain all their skills, money, and some items. All the characters the player recruited will be kept in their Friends List. However, the player must recruit the characters again in subsequent playthroughs.\n\n\"Radiata Stories\" takes place in the land of Radiata. The land has many regions linked by great bridges. In the center region is Radiata City, where the story starts and may continue, given the human path is chosen.\n\nIn Radiata, humans and fairy creatures live together in peace until the story progresses. Just about halfway through the game, the player must choose a side by either choosing the Human path or the Non-Human path.\n\nThe three main characters of \"Radiata Stories\" are Jack Russell, an insubordinate and happy-go-lucky teenager; Ridley Silverlake, a composed female Knight who was trained to be a warrior since birth and feels the pressure of expectations from others; and Ganz Rothschild, the polite and gentle Captain of their brigade who is prone to becoming overexcited. Prominent supporting characters include the Prime Minister Larks; the cunning Knight Cross Ward; Lord Jasne, Ridley's overprotective father and the Lord Chamberlain of Radiata Castle; Lucian, Lord Jasne's advisor; and Gawain Rothschild, Ganz's father and presumed murderer of Jack's father, Cairn Russell.\n\nThe 300 characters and 175 recruitable NPCs of \"Radiata Stories\" were all given unique personalities and backstories. It is impossible to recruit every NPC during the first playthrough, and the game must be played at least twice to unlock all characters. Every time a character is unlocked, he or she shows up on the player's Friends List, which also provides a summary of their history or personality.\n\nRadiata is home to Radiata Castle, its Knights of the realm and four Guilds. Most humans in town belong to one of the guilds, while others, including many from the country side, do not claim any guild affiliation. Fairy creatures are grouped by species.\n\nThe game begins with Jack, the protagonist, joining the Knights of Radiata under the command of Captain Ganz Rothschild, son of Gawain Rothschild, the alleged killer of Cairn Russell, Jack's father. Also in his brigade is a young girl named Ridley Silverlake. One day, while trying to broker a trade agreement with the elves, Jack's brigade is attacked by blood orcs. The knights slay the orcs, but Ridley is seriously wounded during the battle. Her life is saved when her spirit gets merged with that of an elf who was killed by one of the blood orcs. After Ridley's father, Lord Jasne, finds out what happened, he pressures Prime Minister Lord Larks into expelling Jack and Ganz from the knights.\n\nJack goes on to join another group of mercenaries from Theatre Vancoor. Ridley is promoted to captain, but guilt over the expulsion of Jack and Ganz slowly builds in her, and she rebels. Ganz is unable to pass the test necessary to join Theater Vancoor, and through several encounters joins Void, the bandit guild.\n\nAs the game progresses, tension builds between the humans and the non-humans. One day, the Radiata Knights are sent to persuade the dwarves to continue trade with the humans. During negotiations, however, Cross Ward, leader of the squadron of knights, disobeys his orders and has the knights attack the dwarves. The dwarves that are not killed in the battle are enslaved. This starts a war between the humans and the non-humans.\n\nDays later, Jack is visited by Ridley, who tells him that she is going to visit the elf capital city. At this point, the player must choose to either follow Ridley, or attend a meeting at Radiata Castle with Larks.\n\nIf the player chooses to attend the meeting, Jack is reinstated as a Radiata Knight. He learns that the non-humans are protected by four dragons, based on the four elements. One was killed by his father many years ago, and another was killed by Cross Ward when he enslaved the dwarves. Jack is ordered to accompany Cross and General Dynas to kill the remaining two. Jack also encounters Gawain and vows to kill him.\n\nIf the player follows Ridley to the elf city, Jack joins the fairy creatures in the war against the humans. Cross kills the dragons instead of Jack, who attempts to defend the dragons. Jack also learns the truth about his father's death from Gawain, who joins Jack.\n\nAfter the dragons are slain, Ridley visits Jack and informs him that she is going south to meet her destiny. After a final skirmish between the humans and the fairy creatures, the king's advisor turns into the Silver Dragon Aphelion, one of the two apocalyptic dragons. Aphelion flies south, in the same direction that Ridley went, so Jack follows.\n\nAt the castle, Jack finds that the Gold Dragon, Quasar, the other apocalyptic dragon, plans to use Ridley as a vessel to destroy the humans. If Jack followed the human path, Aphelion kills Ridley to prevent this. Enraged by Ridley's death, Jack kills the Silver Dragon. He then leaves Radiata. If Jack followed the non-human path, he is able to prevent Ridley's death, and defeats Aphelion. The victory comes at the cost of both Ganz and Gawain. Jack and Ridley then return to Radiata together.\n\nTri-Ace incorporated characters and references to their other games in \"Radiata Stories\". Ganz wears \"\"s Claude C. Kenni's clothes when he is part of the Bandit Guild. Jack can obtain Fayt Armor, which changes his appearance to that of Fayt Leingod from \"\". Four bonus bosses are from other games: Lenneth Valkyrie and Lezard Valeth from \"Valkyrie Profile\"; and Gabriel Celestra and the Ethereal Queen, who are tri-Ace staples. Of these, only Valkyrie is recruitable; and her armor can also be spotted inside the kings' chambers in the Radiata Castle, as part of the background.\nThe soundtrack was composed by Noriyuki Iwadare. Prior to this, all tri-Ace music was composed by Motoi Sakuraba. However, keeping in line with their tradition to refer to past games, three of Sakuraba's original compositions were rearranged by Iwadare. These are \"Mission to Deep Space\" (also in \"Star Ocean 2\", \"Valkyrie Profile\", and \"Star Ocean 3\"), \"An Incarnation of Devil \"(\"Star Ocean 2\", \"Valkyrie Profile\", and \"Star Ocean 3\"), and \"Highbrow\" (also in \"Star Ocean 3\").Tri-Crescendo, which has a strong affiliation with Sakuraba, was credited with \"Sound Direction\" for the game. Furthermore, the soundtrack was released under the TEAM Entertainment label which is the primary promoter and distributor of Sakuraba.\n\nThe original soundtrack was 2 CDs with 79 songs. One month later Iwadare released \"Radiata Stories: Arranged Album\" which rearranged 16 songs from the original soundtrack.\n\n\"The Sacramento Bee\" said the music was \"peppy and cheerful, if unmemorable\" but that the sound effects were \"largely recycled from the developer's previous games, all the way back to 1999's \"\"Star Ocean: The Second Story\".\" GameSpot remarked that \"None of the music will get stuck in your head, but you won't want to mute it either.\" Game Informer said the soundtrack was a \"masterpiece\". However, the game does not support Dolby Surround sound.\n\nIn November 2004, it was announced that all Japanese preorders of \"Radiata Stories\" would come with a bonus audio disc, \"tri-Ace Battle Sound Collection.\" The disc contained 2 battle themed tracks from \"Star Ocean\", \"Star Ocean 2\", \"Star Ocean 3\", \"Valkyrie Profile\", and \"Radiata Stories\", respectively.\n\nThe theme song of the Japanese version of the game, \"Fortune\", was sung by Japanese Pop star Nami Tamaki, who became known for her debut single \"Believe\", the third opening theme of \"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED\". She also played a recruitable party character of the same name in the game. The character Nami was modeled after Tamaki's likeness and her lines were voiced by the singer. It was her first single of 2005 and her 16th single overall. A music video with scenes from \"Radiata Stories\" and her dressed in her character's clothing was released in January 2005. The Japanese television advertisement for \"Radiata Stoires\" featured the song in the background. This song is found in her second album \"Make Progress\", which also includes \"Reason\", the first ending theme for \"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny\".\n\nThe character's name was changed to Rachel in the English version and \"Fortune\" played during the ending credits.\n\n\"Radiata Stories\" was highly anticipated in Japan receiving the \"Game Awards Future\" by the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association in 2004 which is awarded to games that are \"expected to be major hits\". It was the 12th most pre-ordered game the week of November 17, 2004. According to \"Famitsu\", it was the 20th most wanted game in early October but had jumped up to the 3rd most wanted the week before its release.\n\nA Japanese reviewer noted that the game had humorous dialogue but a simple battle system which made it suitable for beginners. The game sold well in Japan where it debuted as the top-selling game for two weeks, selling 152,000 copies, 54% of the ordered shipment, the day it debuted. It was the 11th best selling game the first half of 2005 and the 37th best-selling game in Japan in 2005 overall selling 10,000 more copies than \"\" and selling about 294,000 copies overall in Japan.\n\nDuring an interview, Roppyaku Tsurumi of SCEJ said most Japanese RPG character designs were cookie-cutter and indistinct noting \"Even when I look at the characters in Radiata Stories, it just looks like the other games\" but he had no problems distinguishing manga characters.\n\nThe North American reception to \"Radiata Stories\" was lukewarm. \"Radiata Stories\" was the top rental on GameFly the week of its debut. and debuted at the 20 most profitable game for September. Overall, it sold about 119,000 copies outside Japan total for the month of September. Mainstream reviewers enjoyed the game overall stating that, while not ground-breaking, the game was simple, whimsical, and entertaining.\n\n\"Radiata Stories\" was awarded \"Game of the Month\" in \"Game Informer\" in October 2005. Jack Russell placed No. 6 on \"Game Informer\"s \"Top 10 Heroes of 2005\" list and \"Radiata Stories\" was in \"The Top 50 Games of 2005\" in the January 2006 issue of \"Game Informer\" and in \"The Top 12 Games of 2005\" by Games Radar. It was nominated for \"Role Playing Game of the Year\" during the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards held by The Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences. It was also nominated for Best Role Playing Game of 2005 by 1UP.com.\n\nTwo 5-issue manga series were released based on \"Radiata Stories\": \"The Epic of JACK\" and \"The Song of RIDLEY\". Both were 5 issues published between 2005 and 2007.\n\nA limited run of a boxed set of 6 figurines from \"Radiata Stories\" and \"Star Ocean\" included Jack and Ridley.\n\n\n"}

The Datu was recognized as one of the fiery rulers by the Iranon and the Dalaman who were scattered throughout the northern part of the Municipalities of Pigcauayan, Libungan, Sultan Kudarat and in Kitacubong (now Poblacion) as the seat of his kingdom.\n\nPrior to its creation as a municipality, it was a resettlement area for Hukbalahap (Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon) surrenders. It was also a public land as declared by then President Elpidio Quirino on March 10, 1953. It was declared as resettlement site under Proclamation No. 376. After its declaration, President Quirino designated the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to implement the “Land for the Landless Program.”\n\nOn January 1, 1954, the area was named Genio Edcor, pursuant to section 3 of General Order No. 409 GHQ., AFP; the name was in honor of then M/SGT. Regino Genio who was ambushed in 1953 at Perido Edcor Farm in Angadanan, Isabela, by the “Hukbong Magpapalaya ng Bayan sa Hapon.” From January 1, 1954, to August 6, 1961, Genio Edcor was a political subdivision by the Municipality of Midsayap. Samson B. Buenafe, a bona fide settler of Genio Edcor, represented the area in the Municipal Council of Midsayap.\n\nDuring the nationwide reorganization in 1986, the first mayor in the name of Wenceslao Tabar Dela Cerna was brought by the EDSA revolution. President Corazon C. Aquino on her first term, replaced the incumbent leaders, especially Marcos’ supporters by the Officer-in-Charge. From March 1986 to November 1987, Jesus N. Sacdalan served as the first OIC. Mayor Wenceslao Tabar Dela Cerna was brought back in the 1988 election and served until 1992.a\n\nDuring the 2001 Referendum for inclusion to the Autonomous Region in Muslin Mindanao, two (2) out of twenty-eight (28) barangays of Carmen, Cotabato chose to be part of ARMM, but were excluded because they are not connected to the main region of ARMM. During 2010-2016 Administration, the Bangsamoro ideal sprouted and a newly proposed region was in the making. According to the agreements signed by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Administration of Noynoy Aquino, Carmen will be included in Bangsamoro because of the two out of twenty-eight barangays that voted in favor of joining the Muslim region back in 2001. Unfortunately, Bangsamoro was not implemented before the term of Aquino ended. Despite this, the current administration aims to establish a Federal Government, where Bangamoro will be realized into a State of the Philippines wherein Carmen will be included in Bangsamoro.\n\nPlans to establish a new municipality in the south of Carmen so that the indigenous and Christian central and northern part of Carmen will be retained in North Cotabato has yet to be confirmed. The idea arose because once the entire municipality of Carmen is included in Bangsamoro, the province of North Cotabato will be cut into half, leaving three towns (Banisilan, Alamada, and Libungan) at its west without connection to the center of North Cotabato, isolating these towns in the process.\n\nIn the , the population of Alamada, Cotabato, was people, with a density of .\n\nAlamada is basically agricultural as its land is cultivated for corn, upland rice, bananas, palm oil, and rubber.

Antipas being centrally located at the heart of Arakan Valley is protected by the majestic Mount Apo from typhoons and other climatic disturbances. Prevailing wind directions are the Northeast and Southwest monsoon.\n\nTemperature ranges from 23 to 32 degrees Celsius, because of its topographic elevation of 320 meters above sea level and proximity to mountainous Bukidnon province, making it one of the cool places in Soccsksargen. The highest temperature is felt during the months of March and April, while the lowest is in December.

During the peak rainy season, some rivers/creeks overflow, causing low-lying areas to flood.\n\nThe Municipality of Antipas long before its creation into a regular municipality was just a mere sitio called Buru-Buruan of Barangay Kiyaab of the Municipality of Matalam which is inhabited mostly by Manobos. Due to continuous influx of Christian settlers in the area, the Municipal Council of Matalam passed a resolution in 1963, approved by the defunct Provincial Board of Cotabato and then was consequently recognized as one of the regular barangays of Matalam, Cotabato bearing the name of ANTIPAS.\n\nThe name \"Antipas\" was derived from \"anti\" from the word \"antique\" and \"pas\" from \"Passi\", two places found in Panay Island. The enthusiasm of the natives and their determination to run their own affairs coupled with the fertility of the soil and a promise of a brighter future of the area brought forth the unified will of the people when they petitioned the National Government through the Provincial Government headed by Governor Carlos B.

Wellman\n\nWilliam Augustus Wellman (February 29, 1896 – December 9, 1975) was an American film director notable for his work in crime, adventure and action genre films, often focusing on aviation themes, a particular passion. He also directed several well-regarded satirical comedies. Beginning his film career as an actor, he went on to direct over 80 films, at times co-credited as producer and consultant. In 1927, Wellman famously directed \"Wings\", which became the first film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture at the 1st Academy Awards ceremony. He also won the Academy Award for Best Story for his film \"A Star Is Born\".\n\nWellman was born in Brookline, Massachusetts. His father, Arthur Gouverneur Wellman, was a Boston Brahmin. William was a five times great-grandson of Puritan Thomas Wellman, who immigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony about 1640. He was also a great-great-great grandson of Francis Lewis of New York, one of the signatories to the Declaration of Independence. Wellman's much-beloved mother, Cecilia McCarthy, was an Irish immigrant.\n\nWellman was expelled from Newton High School in Newtonville, Massachusetts, for dropping a stink bomb on the principal's head. His mother was a probation officer who was asked to address Congress on the subject of juvenile delinquency. Wellman worked as a salesman and then at a lumber yard, and then played professional ice hockey, which is where he was first seen by Douglas Fairbanks, who suggested that with Wellman's good looks he could become a film actor.\n\nIn World War I, Wellman enlisted in the Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps as an ambulance driver. While in Paris, Wellman joined the French Foreign Legion and was assigned on December 3, 1917 as a fighter pilot and the first American to join N.87 \"escadrille\" in the Lafayette Flying Corps (not the sub-unit Lafayette Escadrille as usually stated), where he earned himself the nickname \"Wild Bill\" and received the Croix de Guerre with two palms. N.87, \"les Chats Noir\" (Black Cat Group) was stationed at Lunéville in the Alsace-Lorraine sector and was equipped with Nieuport 17 and later Nieuport 24 \"pursuit\" aircraft. Wellman's combat experience culminated in three recorded \"kills\", along with five probables, although he was ultimately shot down by German anti-aircraft fire on March 21, 1918. Wellman survived the crash but he walked with a pronounced limp for the rest of his life.\n\nWellman's credits:\n\nMaréchal des Logis (Sergeant) Wellman received a medical discharge from the Foreign Legion and returned to the United States a few weeks later. He spoke at War Savings Stamp rallies in his French uniform. In September 1918 his book about French flight school and his eventful four months at the front, titled \"Go Get 'Em!\" (written by Wellman with the help of Eliot Harlow Robinson), was published. He joined the United States Army Air Service but too late to fly for America in the war. Stationed at Rockwell Field, he taught combat tactics to new pilots.\n\nWhile in San Diego, Wellman flew to Hollywood for the weekends in his Spad fighter, using Fairbanks' polo field in Bel Air as a landing strip. Fairbanks was fascinated with the true-life adventures of \"Wild Bill\" and promised to recommend him for a job in the movie business; he was responsible for Wellman being cast in the juvenile lead of \"The Knickerbocker Buckaroo\" (1919). Wellman was hired for the role of a young officer in \"Evangeline\" (1919), but was fired for slapping the leading lady, the actress Miriam Cooper, who happened to be the wife of director Raoul Walsh.\nWellman hated being an actor, thinking it an \"unmanly\" profession, and was miserable watching himself on screen while learning the craft. He soon switched to working behind the camera, aiming to be a director, and progressed up the line as \"a messenger boy, as an assistant cutter, an assistant property man, a property man, an assistant director, second unit director and eventually... director.\" His first assignment as an assistant director for Bernie Durning provided him with a work ethic that he adopted for future film work. One strict rule that Durning enforced was no fraternization with screen femme fatales, which almost immediately Wellman broke, leading to a confrontation and a thrashing from the director. Despite his transgression, both men became lifelong friends, and Wellman steadily progressed to more difficult first unit assignments.\n\nWellman made his uncredited directorial debut in 1920 at Fox with \"The Twins of Suffering Creek\". The first films he was credited with directing were \"The Man Who Won\" and \"Second Hand Love\", released on the same day in 1923. After directing a dozen low-budget 'horse opera' films, Wellman was hired by Paramount in 1927 to direct \"Wings\", a major war drama dealing with fighter pilots during World War I that was highlighted by air combat and flight sequences. The film culminates with the epic Battle of Saint-Mihiel. In the 1st Academy Awards it was one of two films to win Best Picture (the other was \")\", although, due to tensions within the studio regarding time and budget overages, Wellman wasn't invited to the event.\n\nWellman's other notable films include \"The Public Enemy\" (1931), the first version of \"A Star Is Born\" (1937), \"Nothing Sacred\" (1937), the 1939 version of \"Beau Geste\" starring Gary Cooper, \"Thunder Birds\" (1942), \"The Ox-Bow Incident\" (1943), \"Lady of Burlesque\" (1943), \"The Story of G.I. Joe\" (1945), \"Battleground\" (1949) and two films starring and co-produced by John Wayne, \"Island in the Sky\" (1953) and \"The High and the Mighty\" (1954).\n\nWhile he was primarily a director, Wellman also produced 10 films, one of them uncredited, all of which he also directed. His last film was \"Lafayette Escadrille\" (1958), which he produced, directed, wrote the story for and narrated. He wrote the screenplay for two other films that he directed, and one film that he did not direct: 1936's \"The Last Gangster\". He also wrote the story for \"A Star Is Born\" and received a story credit for its remakes in 1954, 1976, and 2018.\n\nWellman reportedly worked fast, usually satisfied with a shot after one or two takes. Despite his reputation for not coddling his leading men and women, he coaxed Oscar-nominated performances from seven actors: Fredric March and Janet Gaynor (\"A Star Is Born\"), Brian Donlevy (\"Beau Geste\"), Robert Mitchum (\"The Story of G.I. Joe\"), James Whitmore (\"Battleground\"), and Jan Sterling and Claire Trevor (\"The High and Mighty\"). Regarding actors, Wellman stated in a 1952 interview \"Movie stardom isn't about acting ability, it's personality and temperament,\" and added \"I once directed Clara Bow. She was mad and crazy but what a personality!\"\n\n\"Wings\" led to several firsts in filmmaking including newly invented camera mounts that could be secured to plane fuselages and motor-driven cameras to shoot actors while flying as the cameramen ducked out of frame in their cockpits. Star Richard Arlen had some flying experience but co-star Buddy Rogers had to learn to fly for the film, as stunt pilots could not be used during close-up shots. Towers up to 100 feet were used to shoot low-flying planes and battle action on the ground.\n\nDuring the filming of \"Beggars of Life\", a silent film starring Wallace Beery, Richard Arlen and Louise Brooks, sound was added to Beery's introductory scene at the behest of Paramount Studio. Wellman reportedly hung a microphone from a broom so Beery could walk and talk within the scene, avoiding the static shot required for early sound shoots. During the filming of Chinatown Nights, he sat under the camera on a dolly with the mic between his legs, essentially inventing a shotgun mic.\n\nWellman won a single Academy Award, for the story of \"A Star Is Born\". He was nominated as best director three times: for \"A Star Is Born\", \"Battleground\" and \"The High and Mighty\", for which he was also nominated by the Directors Guild of America as best director. In 1973, the DGA honored him with a Lifetime Achievement Award. Wellman also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6125 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nSeveral filmmakers have examined Wellman's career. Richard Schickel devoted an episode of his PBS series \"The Men Who Made the Movies\" to Wellman in 1973, and in 1996, Todd Robinson made the feature-length documentary \"Wild Bill: Hollywood Maverick\".\n\n\"Wings\" and \"The Story of G.I. Joe\" are preserved in the Academy Film Archive.\n\nWellman revealed near the end of his life that he had married a French woman named Renee during his time in The Lafayette Flying Corps. She was killed in a bombing raid during the war. He was married four times in the U.S.:\n\nDorothy starred in Wellman's 1933 film \"Wild Boys of The Road\" and had seven children with Wellman, including actors Michael Wellman, William Wellman Jr., Maggie Wellman, and Cissy Wellman. His daughter Kathleen \"Kitty\" Wellman married actor James Franciscus, although they later divorced. His first daughter is Patty Wellman, and he had a third son, Tim Wellman.\n\nWilliam Wellman, Jr. wrote two books about his father, \"The Man and His Wings: William A. Wellman and the Making of the First Best Picture\" (2006), and \"Wild Bill Wellman - Hollywood Rebel\" (2015).\n\nWilliam Wellman died in 1975 of leukemia. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea. His widow Dorothy Wellman died on September 16, 2009 in Brentwood, California at the age of 95.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe word Arakan is derived from the Manobo term “\"ara\"” which means abundance of natural resources in the valley and “\"kan\"” which means heroism, bravery and valor of the early Manobo leaders and settlers of the area. The word “\"arakan\"” then was named referring to one of the rivers of the valley. Arakan is basically a territory of a number of ethno-linguistic groups, predominantly of the Manobo-Kulamanon and Manobo-Tinananon tribes. The names of the two (2) big rivers in Arakan were also from these ethnic groups of the Kulaman and Tinanan Rivers. The original settlers of the place are the Manobos, which were believed to have originally come from the string of islands in the Malayan Peninsula and Borneo. This assumption is based on their language structure which has Malayan roots.\n\nThroughout the years, they maintained contacts and inter-marriages with other tribes such as Matigsalogs and other lesser Bagobo tribes. The early migrant settlers from Visayas came in as early as the 1930s. Massive clearing of the forest areas became the order of these years for agricultural and settlement purposes. Due to these activities, the Manobos were forced to settle in the inner portions away from those areas occupied by the Bisayans. They were pushed further still and they permanently inhabited the highlands of the valley to avoid social and cultural interactions with the migrant Bisayans.\n\nEarly attempts to fully develop Arakan dated back in the 70’s when then Mayor Froilan Matas of the Municipality of Magpet (mother municipality of Arakan) unified his efforts with the Sangguniang Bayan, which was ably supported by the barangay leaders, and its populace led by Greenfield (now Poblacion) Barangay Chairman Aproniano A. Ebon, Sr. through a resolution strongly manifesting its support to the creation of a separate municipality of Arakan. In 1972, a more unified attempts to create the municipality by the provincial leadership has led the passing of House Bill No. 4805 sponsored by the then Assemblyman Salipada K. Pendatun. The declaration of martial law in the same year deterred its creation. This did not however, dampen the hope of the great leaders of Magpet.\n\nThe EDSA Revolution that took place in 1986 paved way to another attempt of the creation of a separate and new municipality through the collaborative efforts of the municipal government of Magpet spearheaded by then Vice Mayor Aproniano A. Ebon, Sr., the provincial leadership headed by then Governor Rosario P. Diaz, M.D. and the most especially by the passage of a house bill sponsored by Congressman Gregorio A. Andolana of the Second District of Cotabato Province.\n\nAfter five years, the Municipality of Arakan was finally created by virtue of \"Republic Act No. 7152\", approved by President Corazon C. Aquino on August 30, 1991. Under the provision of the Act, it had to elect its new officials in local election on May 11, 1992. The then Vice Mayor Ebon overwhelmingly got the mandate as the first Municipal Mayor, while David B. Figura, Sr. was the first Vice Mayor. Ebon spent three terms as municipal mayor, as did David B. Figura, Sr. (who died before his last term ended).\n\nArakan is politically subdivided into 28 barangays.\nIn the , the population of Arakan, Cotabato, was people, with a density of .\n\n\n Gerardo Tuble Sr. is municipal mayor.\n\n"}

This resettlement project covers three (3) municipalities and part of these is the North Cotabato Resettlement Project No. 1. As years passed, hundreds of landless and qualified citizens coming from almost all parts of the country were resettled in the area.

It is bound on the north by the Province of Bukidnon, on the east by the municipalities of Pres. Roxas and Kabacan, on the south by the Province of Maguindanao, and on the west by the Municipality of Aleosan. It is embraced from the north-east, then east, then south by the Mulita and the Rio Grande rivers; from the north-west, then west, then south-west, by the Malitubog and Maridagao rivers.

The coldest part of the year are the months of December, January and February while the hottest are the months of April, May, June, August, and September. It has two (2) distinct seasons, the wet and the dry seasons. The farming season starts in early June and ends in late November when the dry season begins. Typhoon is seldom felt in the area as it is located outside the typhoon belt. This condition is very suitable to nearly all kinds of productive agricultural activity.\n\nCarmen derived its name from surveyor del Carmen, chief of the Cadastral Survey Party, who in 1924 conducted a survey in the area. During the American period, Carmen and Kabacan belonged to one municipal district under Pikit. It was by virtue of Presidential Proclamation NO. 46 and, was reinforced by Executive Order No. 214 issued by the then President Ramon Magsaysay last November 15, 1956 when Carmen was created as a separate and distinct town of Kabacan.\n\nWhen created a municipality, it was composed of Thirty Eight (38) barangays. Ten barangays were either claimed or ceded to the two adjacent municipalities, Banisilan and President Roxas. Six by the municipality of Banisilan and four to the municipality of President Roxas. Now, only twenty eight (28) barangays remain in which are presently inhabited by the so-called Tri-people composed of the Christians, the Muslims and Indigenous Peoples belonging to the Manobo-Aromanon ethnic group.\n\nBefore it was named Carmen, early inhabitants called this large tract of land \"Kalalaw\" a Maguindanaon term meaning \"jar of water\", because legend tells that there was once a big Balite tree with a continuous reservoir of water under its dense foliage, that even in long dry seasons, it had never dried up.\n\nLater on, when early settlers came and cultivated large portions of land in what is now the Poblacion, the whole place was unofficially called \"Landing\" because of the Landing Field reservation of approximately two hundred (200) hectares. The name \"Landing\" later on changed to Carmen in honor of del Carmen.\n\nThe present Christian in this place are an immigrants from Luzon and Visayas. They are brought here by sheer pioneering spirit inspired by widespread rumors of this \"Land of Opportunity and Promise\". Their settlement started during the American regime. When the Americans launched their policy of attraction to the Muslims providing advanced technology, economic and educational advancement and the art of government. The first Christian settlers came from Cebu and established settlements at Pikit. Then adventurers followed them from Luzon and Visayas most notably the Ilongos and the Ilocanos who came in great numbers.\n\nThe Manili massacre refers to the mass murder of 70-79 Moro Muslims, including women and children, committed in a mosque in Manili, Carmen, on June 19, 1971. The Muslim residents of the town had gathered in their mosque to participate in a supposed peace talk with Christian groups when a group of armed men dressed in uniforms similar to those worn by members of the Philippine Constabulary opened fire on them.\n\nIt was suspected that the Ilaga militant group were the attack's perpetrators, but there were also allegations that the Philippine Constabulary had collaborated with the Ilaga. No one was found culpable for the incident; Feliciano Lucas, also known as \"Commander Toothpick\", the Ilaga leader who was the prime suspect in the crime, was released after he \"surrendered\" to Ferdinand Marcos at the Malacañang Palace. The incident resulted in increased hostilities between Moro Muslims and Christians. In response to the incident, former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi provided military aid to the secessionist group Moro National Liberation Front.\n\nIn the , the population of Carmen, Cotabato, was people, with a density of .\n\nSince the municipality is an agricultural area, most of the industries are agri-based.

There is a bright prospect on cottage industries, which utilized raw materials like rattan and bamboo. Rattan craft in barangays Dado could possibly generate employment to its residents. The 40 hectares bamboo plantation at Barangay Guiling can provide fro raw materials to the bamboo craft at Kitacubong. This cottage industry is gaining support and acceptance from local residents considering the affordability and its unique qualities. Technology transfer and skills training have been conducted in the area. Its clients are the prospective entrepreneurs in rattan, bamboo and coconut crafts. Recipientss of the training and development seminars are: RIC Camansi, Lower Dado, Pacao, Raradangan the DTI-CARP has establish a Multi-Purpose Hot dryer at Barangay Pacao, the said project generate employment and income from drying service. Barangay Parauran and Pacao could possibly support a fruit juice making industry, the 500 mango trees could adequately supplies for this industry.\n\nThe commonly known minerals present in the municipality are sand and gravel which volume and potential are good sources for quarrying but which up to the present are mostly untapped. Other metallic substance of high commercial value are known to be present but these are still unexplored.\n\nOther resources present in the municipality are the large volume of limestone that can be processed into cement. Guano also abounds in numerous caves in the municipality such as in barangays Liliongan and Tonganon. Guano can be manufactured into fertilizers.\n\n\n\nDuring the 2001 Referendum for inclusion to the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, two (2) out of twenty-eight (28) barangays of Carmen located in its southern territory chose to be part of ARMM, but were excluded because they are not connected to the main region of ARMM.

The University of Southern Mindanao is in Kabacan. It is strategically located between the cities of Cotabato and Davao from west to east and the cities of Cagayan de Oro and Iligan from the north and General Santos from the south.\n\nKabacan got its name from the word “\"ka-abacan\"” which means the source of abundance. People from far-flung barangays used to come to this place and, upon returning home, they brought with them many commodities of their livelihood.\n\nThe municipality of Kabacan was a barrio of the municipal district of Pikit before its creation as a district political body. It was created as a regular municipality by virtue of \"Executive Order No. 82\" dated August 18, 1947, issued by President Manuel Roxas of the Republic of the Philippines.\n\nGrowth was gradual under the domain of Datu Mantawil; that influx of settlers from Luzon and Visayas arrived in the 1930s. This was made so when the McLareen family sold its hacienda to Jose Yulo Alano, Rafael Alunan and party who organize a company under the cooperate name of Rio Grande Estate. The company became the people's place of business and social center. Recognizing his immense power and leadership over the area, the provincial governor of Cotabato organizes the Kabacan into a Municipal District with Datu Mantawil as its first mayor in 1935.\n\nWhen the Second World War broke out and the Japanese Imperial Army occupied the country, the Rio Grande Rubber Estate was sold by the Filipino Incorporators to the Japanese Imperial Government. It became the site for the provisional municipal government with Cenon Doctolero as the appointed mayor. The Japanese garrison was attacked Oct. 25, 1942, by guerrilla forces under U.S. Lieut. Col. Wendell Fertig. During a fourteen-day siege sixty-eight of the seventy-six Japanese garrison were killed. Only the arrival of reinforcements saved the garrison and caused the guerrillas to withdraw.\n\nCurrently, Kabacan is known as a Ilocano-speaking area since 65% of its population are Ilocano immigrants.\n\nKabacan is centrally located in Cotabato province, bounded on the north by Pres. Roxas, on the east by Matalam, on the south by M'lang, and on the west by Carmen, Cotabato and Datu Montawal.

In 2017, Karlo Antonio Galay David gathered all written and oral explanations from archival sources and tribal key informants. Galay David gathered thirteen proposed etymologies, and of these thirteen, six are about springs, three are about weddings, three are about highlands, two are names, and three are directional and imply the act of going. \nThe etymologies are listed as follows:\n\nThe city of Kidapawan is politically subdivided into 40 barangays.\n\nKidapawan is located at the foot of Mount Apo in the south-eastern section of Cotabato province, placed in the middle of other major cities of General Santos, Davao City, Cotabato City and Cagayan de Oro. It borders the other towns of Cotabato province, namely: Magpet and President Roxas to the north, Matalam to the west, M’lang to the south and Makilala to the east.\n\nKidapawan covers a total land area of . Much of its land area was mostly flat, except for the increasingly hilly and mountainous areas to the northeast near Mount Apo which is the highest point in the Philippines. The Kabacan River has its source in the northeastern part of the city and flows through across its northern border with Magpet town. \n\nKidapawan lies outside the typhoon belt and has a mild climate characterized by wet and dry seasons. The coldest months are December and January. The hottest are April and May.\n\nIn the , the population of Kidapawan was people, with a density of .\n\nIn the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 125,447 people, up 117,610 from in 2007. The religion is predominantly Christian, although there are many Muslims residing in the city as well. The main languages are Cebuano and Hiligaynon, while English functions as a secondary language. Other languages spoken include Maguindanao, Obo, Ilianen, and Tagabawa.\n\nCebuanos and Hiligaynons are the major ethnic groups in the city. Other ethnic groups residing in the area are the Ilocanos, Maguindanaons and Manobo groups of Obo, Ilianen, and Tagabawa. Cebuano is the most widely spoken language, especially in the city proper. English is used as the medium of instruction in schools and other learning institutions; it is also predominantly used in major government agencies in their transactions and reports. Laws and ordinances in the city are all written in English.\n\nThe Greater Kidapawan Area was originally a vast area that covered much of the north-eastern part of North Cotabato. When it was created a municipality, Kidapawan extended from the Pulangi river in Kabacan to the west, The Matanao river bordering Davao to the east, Bukidnon province to the north, and Buluan to the south . \n\nKidapawan has its roots in pre-colonial settlements of the Obo Monuvu, the indigenous peoples that have lived at the foot of Mt Apo on both the Cotabato and Davao sides for generations. The Monuvu, along with other tribes in the area with whom they frequently intermarried, remained independent throughout the Spanish colonial period, as the Spaniards were never able to surmount Mt Apo on the Davao side nor penetrate beyond the Ligawasan Marsh on the Cotabato side. The chieftains of the tribes in the Greater Kidapawan Area remained independent but maintained relations with the nearby Maguindanaon sultanates, the closest of which were the Sultanate of Buayan in Dulawan (today Datu Piang, Maguindanao), and its related settlement, the Sultanate of Bagua Inged in what is today Pikit and Pagalungan. The Monuvu settlements, the precursors of many of Kidapawan’s modern day Baranggays, existed autonomously with one another but were ruled by chieftains often related by centuries of intermarriage. \n\nSome time before the coming of the Americans, the different tribal settlements west of the Matanao river apparently fell under the influence of a Datu Ingkal (in some sources he is named Datu Ingkal Ugok), who became paramount chieftain over the different settlements within the Kidapawan area. When the Americans came they recognized Datu Ingkal’s leadership, and records say he was appointed ‘Capitan’ by a Col. Stevens in 1908, presumably as head of a tribal ward under what was then the Cotabato District of the Moro Province\n\nWhen Datu Ampatuan of Maganoy threatened to stage a rebellion against the Americans in 1913, Datu Ingkal is recorded as threatening to side with him. The Americans sought to pacify the two datus by offering appointments and administrative arrangements .\nBy 1914, Datu Ingkal’s territory, Kidapawan, would be formed into a Municipal District, one of twenty seven under the newly created Cotabato Province of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu. Datu Siawan Ingkal, son of Datu Ingkal Ugok, would be appointed Municipal District President. The Cornejo Commonwealth Directory of 1939, published under the newly elected Quezon government, still names Datu Siawan as District President, with Datu Amag Madut as Vice President. \n\nKidapawan’s establishment as a Municipal District paved the way for settlers from Luzon and Visayas to come over the succeeding decades up until the 1960s. Kidapawan was not a planned colony, but it was surrounded by planned colonies on both sides, thus encouraging individual migration: Davao, a Spanish colony in the late 1800s, Pikit, an agricultural colony set up by the Americans, the settlements of the National Land Settlement Administration (NLSA) in what is today South Cotabato, and much later the colony of Alamada under Magsaysay’s National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA). The diverse ethnic composition of Kidapawan’s settler population, with Cebuanos, Tagalogs, Ilonggos, Chinese, and Igorots, reflect both the gradual individual efforts of migrants and Kidapawan’s position as the transition area between Cebuano-dominated Davao and Ilonggo-dominated Cotabato. \n\nThere are conflicting accounts as to where the original center of Kidapawan was before the War. Tribal and settler sources name either Manongol (for a time called ‘Old Kidapawan’) or Lanao as centers, with some sources identifying Lanao as the commercial center of the town where the settlers concentrated, with Manongol the seat of Siawan Ingkal’s chieftaincy. \n\nThe details of Kidapawan’s arrangements during the Second World War are unclear, but it seems to have been one of the Municipal Districts elevated in 1942 to Municipality by virtue of Executive Order No. 43 of the Japanese-sponsored Executive Commission. \n\nNo records attest to it, but informants (primary among them Rosita Blanco Cadungog) names Filomeno Blanco as the local appointed Mayor by the Japanese during their occupation of Kidapawan. There are even less details on the arrangements of the resistance government, but Kidapawan fell under the command of Datu Udtog Matalam, who with his Bolo Batallion led the Cotabato region’s guerrilla movement. Records indicate that in 1942 Alfonso O. Angeles Sr. had been appointed ‘Mayor of the Upper Cotabato Sector,’ to which Kidapawan presumably belonged, while the Paclibar family describes a ‘Civil Emergency Administration’ in M’lang under the 118th Infantry Regiment of the 106th Division of Wendell Fertig’s 10th Military District (the resistance detachment in Mindanao during the War), headed by Jacinto Paclibar . \n\nWhen the War ended, Kidapawan’s administrative status was in limbo, but in all likelihood it was reverted back to Municipal District. No documents also confirm it, but informants like Erlinda Villanueva Asuelo name Ceferino J. Villanueva as acting mayor after the War up to the election of 1947. \n\nIn 1947 Kidapawan was among the ten municipalities created by Executive Order No. 82, signed on 18 August, 1947 by Manuel A. Roxas. The newly created Municipality ‘consist of the territory comprised in the municipal districts of Kidapawan together with the unexplored region north of this municipal district to the boundary of Davao province on the east and Bukidnon province on the north, and Pulangi River on the west, and M’lang which is at present a part of the municipal district of Buluan.’ \n\nThe election of 1947 resulted in the victory of Alfonso O. Angeles Sr. The first elected Vice Mayor was Datu Siawan Ingkal, while the first elected Councilors were Gil dela Cruz, Lorenzo A. Saniel, Lino Madrid, Ricardo Ipong, Norberto Cajucom, and Arsenio Sibug. The first Municipal Government began functioning in 1948. \n\nThe vast area of the original municipality of Kidapawan was partitioned bit by bit over the next two decades, with the municipality of M’lang first separating in 1951, followed by the municipality of Makilala in 1954, the municipality of Matalam in 1961, the municipality of Magpet in 1963, and the municipality of President Roxas in 1967. \n\nKidapawan’s historical territory is now composed of eight towns in the province: Kidapawan itself, M’lang, Makilala, parts of Matalam, Magpet, President Roxas, Antipas, Tulunan and Arakan, along with the portion of Bansalan east of the Matanao River. \nWhen the second partitioning of the Empire Province of Cotabato happened in the 1970s, Kidapawan became the provincial capital of the much-reduced Cotabato Province (now colloquially called North Cotabato) by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 341, issued by Ferdinand Marcos on 22 November, 1973. \n\nAs early as 1951 Kidapawan’s successive governments had made attempts to become a city, but it was not until 1998 that it finally achieved this. Republic Act 8500, authored by then North Cotabato Second District Representative Gregorio Andolana, was signed by Fidel V. Ramos on 12 February, 1998. The last Municipal mayor, Luis P. Malaluan, was elected Kidapawan’s first city mayor. \n\nThe city of Kidapawan is governed by the city mayor, the city's local chief executive and administrative officer, along with the city vice mayor. The Sangguniang Panlungsod serves as the local legislative body of the city. Kidapawan is also the seat of the provincial government of the province of Cotabato, with the provincial capitol being located at Barangay Amas in the western portion of the city.\n\nAmerican Appointed ‘Capitan’ of Kidapawan \n\nAppointed President of the Municipal District of Kidapawan\n\nCivilian Heads During and After the Second World War\n\n\nElected and Appointed Mayors of the Municipality and City of Kidapawan\n\n\nThe city is considered as the province’s industrial hub, and plays a pivotal role in the economic development of the province and its adjacent areas. It is the commercial and trading hub of eastern Cotabato province as it lies at the heart of three large domestic markets of Davao City, General Santos City, and Cotabato City.\n\nThe city of Kidapawan boasts the most number of shopping and retail centers in the whole province of Cotabato. Gaisano Grand Mall of Kidapawan, the largest shopping center in the city, is located at Purok 1, Barangay Lanao in the northern part of the city's urban core, while the KMCC Shopping Center is located at Dayao St., deep into the city's main thoroughfare.

The said plantation, which also had its holdings on neighboring towns Makilala and Matalam, is the largest in the province of Cotabato. With this, the city is an international exporter of bananas globally.\n\nKidapawan is home to a sizeable flower-cutting industry and one of the major sources of income among Kidapaweños. In addition to ornamental and forest tree seedlings, flowers such as roses, anthuriums and orchids are abundantly grown and cultivated locally, providing a very promising and highly profitable source of livelihood and business in the area.\n\nCrops abundantly grown in the city include abaca, rubber, corn, rice, coconut, and vegetables.\n\nKidapawan City is one of the most well-known starting points for trekking on Mount Apo via the city's Lake Agco in Barangay Ilomavis, Kidapawan-Santa Cruz, and Kidapawan-Magpet trails which towers at above sea level with a total area of . The country’s tallest peak is an abode to the almost extinct Philippine eagle. Within the Mt. Apo Natural Park is the Mandarangan Geological Site which is being promoted as a major educational tourism site. Lake Venado, hidden among the mountain ranges, stands at an elevation of above sea level.\n\nAnother tourist attraction in this city is Kansal Falls located at Sitio Lapaan in Barangay Perez in the eastern part of the city. The water from the Kansal Falls is still one of the cleanest and cheapest in Asia and the source of North Cotabato’s Metro Kidapawan Water District Dam. The water rushing through Kansal Falls comes from the various mountain springs of Mt. Apo. This waterfall is the source of Kidapawan City’s water supply.\n\nOften dubbed as the \"Second Fruit Basket of the Philippines\", the city government celebrate the abundance of the exotic fruits grown in Kidapawan City by holding an annual festival in the month of August called \"Timpupo\", the fruit festival. This festival, first held in 2001, celebrates fruit harvest. The city purchases large quantities of local fruit which is laid out on tables along the streets for visitors and residents. .\n\nThe Foundation Anniversary of the City of Kidapawan is held every August 28 (together with Timpupo), while the city's Charter Day is celebrated on February 12. .\n\nKidapawan is the transportation nexus of the whole eastern Cotabato province. It is the main highway road junction to all of the province's eastern municipalities that were not situated on and was not passed through by the National Highway which passes through the entire east-to-west span of the city. It is also the primary gateway and road junction to the towns of the Arakan Valley, namely President Roxas, Antipas and Arakan.\n\nQuezon Boulevard, the Paco-Arakan-Katipunan Highway, the Kidapawan-Magpet Highway, the Kidapawan-Kalaisan-Calunasan-Bialong-M'lang Highway, and the Kidapawan-Ilomavis-Agco Road are the major thoroughfares of the city.\n\nLocal public transportation is primarily served by almost 3,000 motor tricycles known as just \"motor\". Multicabs and jeepney provide transportation to barangays and nearby municipalities. Tricycles are the primary mode of transportation within the urban and suburban areas of the city.\n\nThe Kidapawan City Overland Terminal caters passenger vans and buses that serve the city to certain areas in SOCCSKSARGEN area, Bangsamoro and Davao Region. Public utility vans serve multiple destinations outside the city. Mindanao Star, Davao Metro Shuttle and Yellow Bus Line are the bus companies operating in the city, serving the city with destinations towards the cities of Cotabato, Davao, General Santos, Digos and Tacurong.\n\nKidapawan has no existing airport of its own and thus relies on nearby airports for its air transport. Nearest airports from the city are at Davao International Airport some away and Cotabato Airport some away.\n\nMetro Kidapawan Water District is the main water service provider in the city, while Cotabato Electric Cooperative (Cotelco) delivers electric services into the city. The Mount Apo Geothermal Power Plant, one of the only three geothermal power plants in the Philippines, is located on Barangay Ilomavis in the hilly and geologically active northeastern part of the city.\n\nMetro Kidapawan Telephone Corporation is the main telephone and telecommunications company operating in Kidapawan. It is operated by the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company since 2015. Bayantel is the other telephone and telecommunications company operating in the city.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nLibungan was known by various names by its early settlers. The Manobo settlers of the area initially called the area as \"Dasdas\" which means road down by the river. \"Libungan\" is used to refer to the river located in the area by the Manobo which means cheater. During the earlier period of settling the place, the Libungan River changes its course which adversely affected the crops which led the settlers to believe that the river was \"cheating\" them. The area from then on was referred to as Libungan. \"Tubak\" is one of the earlier names used to refer to the place which means \"eroding river\".\n\nLibungan is located in the north-western part of the Province of Cotabato with Libungan River as the main boundary from the Municipalities of Alamada, Banisilan and Carmen.\n\nLibungan is politically subdivided into 20 barangays. At its establishment, Libungan has 12 barangays. Libungan had 32 barangays at its peak before the municipality of Alamada was carved from Libungan.\nLibungan's climate is under the 4th type, which is more or less even distribution of rainfall during the year.\n\nIn the , the population of Libungan, Cotabato, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe earlier settlers of Libungan are the Manobo. It was later settled by people from Luzon and Visayas primarily by Cebuanos from Cebu.\n\nThe Manobo are the earlier settlers of the place and was eventually settled by other ethnic groups mainly by Cebuanos from Cebu who found the place suitable for them because of its terrain. Many immigrants from Luzon and Visayas came to settle in Libungan in the early 1930s. During World War II, the area of Demapaco was used by guerrillas as hideouts and the Libungan River became a battleground. After the Liberation in 1945, more settlers came to Libungan who cleared the forest and used the area's fertile lands for agriculture.\n\nIn 1955, when Libungan was still a part of Midsayap, many Libungan residents were elected to the Municipal Council of Midsayap. The Midsayap Municipal Council passed a resolution to the Provincial Government which in turn pass a similar resolution to the national government which seeks to create the Municipality of Libungan. Libungan was established as a separate municipality in August 7, 1961. Under Executive Order No. 414 dated January 27, 1961, Libungan was established as a regular municipality with 14 barangays. The number of barangays within Libungan increased to 32 in the following years but in 1969, Alamada, a new municipality was created from some of Libungan's barangays.\n\nAfter the creation of Alamada, the municipality maintained its 19 barangays, part of which are the former barangays of Midsayap, namely Libungan (Poblacion), Barongis, Cabaruyan, Batiocan, Sinawingan, Baguer, Montay and Demapaco. Other barangays that compose the municipality are Abaga, Cabpangi, Grebona, Gumaga, Kapayawi, Kiloyao, Malengen, Sinapangan, Kitubod, Nicaan and Palakat, which later became defunct. Under Resolution No. 35 dated December 14, 1978, Palao and Ulamian was established with the total number of barangays of Libungan becoming 20.\n\nLibungan was affected by two fires which had a socio-economic implications to the municipality which destroyed a commercial establishment and local government building. The former occurred on January 16, 1979, and the later occurred on February 17, 1989. After just a week after the fire at the municipal hall, the EDSA Revolution occurred which led to the installation of Corazon Aquino as president after the then president Ferdinand Marcos was deposed. Reorganization of political leadership was made and Libungan was affected.\n\nDuring the 2001 Referendum for inclusion to the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, two (2) out of twenty-eight (28) barangays of Carmen, Cotabato chose to be part of ARMM, but were excluded because they are not connected to the main region of ARMM. During 2010–2016 Administration, the Bangsamoro ideal sprouted and a newly proposed region was in the making. According to the agreements signed by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Administration of Noynoy Aquino, Carmen will be included in Bangsamoro because of the two out of twenty-eight barangays that voted in favor of joining the Muslim region back in 2001. Unfortunately, Bangsamoro was not implemented before the term of Aquino ended. Despite this, the current administration aims to establish a Federal Government, where Bangamoro will be realized into a State of the Philippines wherein Carmen will be included in Bangsamoro.\n\nPlans to establish a new municipality in the south of Carmen so that the indigenous and Christian central and northern part of Carmen will be retained in North Cotabato has yet to be confirmed. The idea arose because once the entire municipality of Carmen is included in Bangsamoro, the province of North Cotabato will be cut into half, leaving three towns (Banisilan, Alamada, and Libungan) at its west without connection to the center of North Cotabato, isolating these towns in the process.\n\nThe first mayor of Libungan was Esmeraldo Cedeño who was appointed and served from 1961 to 1964. In 1964, Pedro Singayao, Sr. a native from Malitubog who was an agriculturist and was a pensionado, who served as the first-elected mayor from 1964 to 1967. He was succeeded by Pacifico Dela Serna who served from 1967 to 1971 as mayor. Del Serna was among the early settlers from Cebu. He was then followed by his wife, Lucila T. Dela Serna who served as the third-elected mayor.\n\nFollowing the EDSA Revolution, newly installed President Corazon Aquino, appointed lawyer Nestor Q. Quintana as mayor of Libungan replacing Dela Serna. He was later replaced by Leliosa Agravante Villanueva and then later by Luden A. Laguting when Quintana ran for mayor in the 1988 election. He lost to Manuel T. dela Serna in the elections. Joel D. Humabad succeeded dela Serna when he was elected in 1992. Humabad was then succeeded by Ronaldo B. Pader after the former served for two terms. Pader served for three terms or nine years. In 2007, Manuel T. Dela Serna was elected mayor again. He is the current mayor and is on his third and last consecutive term.\n\nThe Municipality of Libungan in the first Congressional District of Cotabato is basically an Agricultural area. It has the basic requirements for agro-industries. It has lots of rice/corn mills, Buy/Sell, Agri-supply and Hardware supplies store. In the PALMA Alliance, Libungan has the biggest source of sand and gravel supply owing to the Libungan River bed. Libungan is also the home of the biggest poultry farm in the PALMA Alliance; it has also the Rock crusher and banana chips factory. It also has 2 filling stations, 3 pawnshops and a Rural Bank servicing\nmobility and financial requirements of local business.\n\nThe agricultural land in the municipality is planted with rice, corn and a hundred hectares to the traditional white corn variety. Coconut, mango and banana are also planted in the semi-sloping and upland areas.\n\nIn the last five years from 2014, the development of tourism in the municipality was minimal. The municipal government has eyed developing the Sapangbato River at Barangay Grebona, the waterfall at Barangay Sinapangan and the Boy & Girl Scout Camp at Barangay Demapaco as tourism sports. The waterfall at Sinapangan is the sole existing waterfall in Libungan and the BGS Camp in Demapaco was dilapidated. Tourists visiting the municipality primarily comes from adjacent municipalities and Cotabato City.\n\nNumerous festivals are held within the municipality by the Manobo people in the barangays of Barongis, Demapaco, Grebona and Sinapangan. Fiestas honoring patrons are also held in the municipality. Among these festivals are the Kaumahan Festival which features a parade and dancing contests revolving around the local endemic flora of the municipality and paraphernalia in food production. The Kaumahan festival is part of the Catholic Patronal Festival which is conducted every third Sunday of May. On December 28, annually the Samayaan Aroman Manobo Festival is celebrated where rituals by the Manobo such as Kanduli, Pamaya, Bulangan and Ulahingan are conducted.\n\n"}

The land was very fertile and varieties of fishes were found in the rivers and streams, and on the woodlands, wild pigs, deer and birds are plentiful. Food was not a problem during that period, but rather, marketing of production surplus and purchase of basic commodities. They traveled for days and weeks in order to sell their crops to the nearest trading centers and they needed salt, sugar, matches and soap for daily needs.\n\nMagpet was created through Republic Act 3721, which was signed by then President Diosdado Macapagal on June 22, 1963.

Some of the barangays (Southern and Western part) are along the big bodies of water, thus making it accessible by water transportation.

Midsayap means a hat at the center – just like a hill centrally located at the Municipality which slopes through the plains in a shape of a hat. Other version relates that Midsayap came from a Muslim term which means “person wearing a hat”. From 1912 to 1926, Midsayap was then a district of Dulawan and Pikit. Originally, Midsayap was inhabited by Muslims from the descendants of Sultan Ali Bayao from the lineage of Sultan Dipatuan Kudarat I. The seat of their sultanate was established at Libungan Torreta (now part of Pigcawayan).\n\nIn 1927, a Philippine Constabulary (PC) Commander assigned in the area, Ist Lt. Catalino Javier, initiated the development of some portions of the municipality. Seeing the natural bounty of the area, he invited settlers from Luzon and Visayas to migrate in the area. The first wave of settlers who dared develop the wilderness was the late Antonio Labasan from Zambales. Among his companions were 23 interrelated families, the Rosete, Almazan, Dumlaos, Flautas, Fernandezes, QuiÑones,Fermils, Fantones and Documos who settled at Sitio Salunayan and Bual . Visayan settlers from Pikit also came to settle at Bual - the place of Datu Guiambangan Dilangalen. The Visayan migrants were headed by Gregorio Bingil, Julio Anito and Tomas Cantoy.\nThe idea of making Midsayap as a separate political district from the mother municipalities of Dulawan and Pikit was envisioned in 1930 by a group of Christian PC enlisted men who were assigned at Camp Ward. Their efforts, through the support of the deputy governor and military governor was realized in 1936.\n\nPursuant to Executive Order No. 66 dated November 25, 1936, Midsayap was created as a separate municipality. On January 1, 1937, it was inaugurated with Lorenzo Gonzales as its first appointed municipal mayor. In 1939, Juan Jaranilla became the first elected mayor of the municipality and served in that position until 1941.\n\nMidsayap started with 71 barangays. Later, it was trimmed down to 42 when Libungan was separated from Midsayap in 1936. At present, Midsayap has 57 barangays. Population settlements were concentrated on the barangays of Sinawingan, Salunayan, Bual, Kapayawi, Barongis, Kimagango, Kiwanan, Katingawan, Ulamian, Baguer, Kapinpilan, Olandang, San Mateo, and Baliki.

The song was released in 2002 as the first single from his album \"Fake Songs\". The improvised song was written by Lynch himself. \"United States of Whatever\" is a comedy rock song that revolves around Lynch dismissively shouting \"Whatever!\" to various people.\n\nThe song received mostly positive reviews from music critics who praised its humor and its take on American youth. It reached number ten on the UK Singles Chart, and until 2007 was the shortest song to appear on the chart. As of 12 December 2018 it is still the shortest single to reach the Top 10. The song has spawned various parodies, and Lynch has performed the song with artists like Tony Kanal, Adrian Young and Foo Fighters.\n\n\"United States of Whatever\" was solely written by Liam Lynch. Lynch has stated that the song was improvised and recorded in a single take. The song is performed in a punk rock and surf rock style. Its basic structure consists of two power-chord riffs played by an overdriven distorted bass guitar. The song begins with a dismissive \"whatever\", and each verse describes a short encounter with a person which abruptly ends with Lynch dismissing the person with the word. The chorus proclaims: \"This is my United States of whatever!\" He also dismisses people he should not ignore for his own well-being, such as a street thug and a police officer. The final verse describes an encounter with Zafo, a character from the TV series \"The Sifl and Olly Show\", created by Lynch. Breaking the lyrical structure of the song, Zafo is spared the disparaging remark.\n\nThe song debuted on a 1999 episode of \"The Sifl and Olly Show\", where it is shown being performed by Olly, a character on the show voiced by Lynch.\n\nWhile reviewing \"Fake Songs\" MacKenzie Wilson of the website Allmusic specifically praised \"United States of Whatever\", describing it as a \"sock-puppet favorite\" and \"an absolute standout that crassly makes fun of American youth in its own self-deprecating kind of way.\" The review also noted that the British music publication \"NME\" named it as a \"Single of the Week\" in 2002. English disc jockey Steve Lamacq named it \"the greatest single of 2002\".\n\nThe song first attracted commercial popularity when it started appearing on the request charts on Los Angeles radio station KROQ after the song was leaked from a British import of \"The Sifl and Olly Show\". The track was burned onto a CD-R, which was sent to the station. A physical single was eventually released on November 25, 2002. Following its CD single release, the song became a hit, debuting at number ten on the UK Singles Chart on the chart week of December 7, 2002. At 1 minutes and 26 seconds in length, it held the record for the shortest single to enter the UK Singles Chart before the record was beaten by the shorter singles \"Spider Pig\" by Hans Zimmer and \"The Ladies' Bras\" by Jonny Trunk and Wisbey, which hit the charts within three weeks of each other in 2007. It debuted at number six on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart on the chart week of June 8, 2003, staying in the top ten of the chart for a total of six weeks. The song also managed to hit the singles charts of Belgium, the Netherlands and New Zealand. The song was later included on Lynch's album \"Fake Songs\" (2003).\n\nLynch performed the song with bassist Tony Kanal and drummer Adrian Young, both members of rock band No Doubt, on an episode of the American late-night television talk and variety show \"The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn\". In 2003, Lynch performed the song with American rock band Foo Fighters at one of their concerts.\n\nThe song is played weekly on the Charlottesville, Virginia radio station WWWV as a part of their \"Friday Freakout\" segment. It was used in an advertisement for the 2003 video game \"Tony Hawk's Underground\" and was used in a video of behind-the-scenes content from the 2006 comedy film \"Clerks II\".\n\nA version of the song called the \"Bush Remix\" was popular during the administration of President George W. Bush. The song's lyrics reflect the then-President's cavalier attitude towards his decision to go to war with Iraq, and also throws barbs at Russian leader Vladimir Putin, the late terrorist Osama bin Laden and the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.\n"}

His production style has been described as very hands on and song oriented. He received a Grammy Award for engineering Pink's, \"Trouble\".\n\nCarlock was born in St. Joseph, Michigan, the son of Jane (née Hadley), and Nelson Carlock. He discovered his love of music by singing in front of restaurant jukeboxes at the age of four.\n\nIn junior high school, he taught himself guitar, bass, and keyboards. After graduating from St. Joseph High School, Carlock was an engineer at local recording studios, produced bands, and did string arrangements for a 60-piece symphony.\n\nHe attended Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan on an academic scholarship, before deciding to focus solely on his musical career.\n\nHe began his professional career as a songwriter and session musician for Columbia Records artist George LaMond, contributing songs and vocal and instrumental arrangements to LaMond's debut record \"Bad of the Heart\". Carlock built a 16-track recording studio and continued to develop as a producer and writer. He later moved to New York, where he stayed for three years, and then moved to Los Angeles.\n\nWhile in New York, Carlock worked as a technician and consultant with artists such as Hall & Oates and Lenny Kravitz using a recording platform known as Pro Tools. He produced local bands, most notably Coward, who signed with Elektra Records.\n\nCarlock moved to Los Angeles, where he worked with Greg Ladanyi, producer of pop music artists like Don Henley, Jackson Browne, Fleetwood Mac, and Warren Zevon. He partnered with Ladanyi's Tidal Wave Entertainment in 1999 for a year, during which time they co-produced, with David Foster, The Tubes' live/studio hybrid album \"Tubes World Tour 2001\", which featured collaborations with Richard Marx and Steve Lukather. Carlock's involvement with Ladanyi also led to sessions with Eric Clapton, Dolly Parton, Rodney Crowell, and others.\n\nCarlock started a long collaboration in 2000 with Rancid frontman and punk rock songwriter Tim Armstrong, first as engineer/mixer on several projects for Armstrong's label, Hellcat Records, and then as co-producer/co-writer. The team's first co-production work was on the Transplants record, which was born out of the combination of two projects: a side project for Armstrong and a separate project Carlock and Armstrong were recording for Armstrong's friend and AFI roadie Rob Aston. After working off and on for two years, then adding Travis Barker to the band, the Transplants were formed. Carlock toured as keyboardist/sample guru during the Transplants tour with the Foo Fighters and appeared with the band on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Snoop Dogg's \"Doggy Fizzle Televizzle\" show.\n\nThe Transplants singles \"Diamonds and Guns\" and \"D.J. D.J.\" quickly became MTV favorites and earned the band critical and commercial success. \"Diamonds and Guns\" has been featured on TV commercials for Garnier Fructis shampoo and Neutrogena. The song was used on the soundtrack for the movie \"Bulletproof Monk\" (2003). The band followed up the record's success by touring with the Foo Fighters.\n\nCarlock engineered on nine songs for Pink's album \"Try This\" in 2003, performing bass, vocals, keys and programming. Carlock next started up a production label called 27 Sounds to produce and collaborate with unsigned artists.\n\nIn 2004-2005, Carlock worked with the Transplants for their second album, \"Haunted Cities\", co-producing and engineering with Tim Armstrong and contributing keyboards, bass, guitar, vocals, theremin, and songwriting. In the fall, he also worked with Nine Inch Nails in preparation for their summer tour.\n\nIn 2006, several EPs produced and cowritten by Carlock were released by 27 Sounds artists. From the first group which included Counterpush, R&B/pop artist Jackie Ray, pop/rock/dance artist Shevyn and 14-year-old pop/rock artist Shelby Spalione.\n\nSpalione was immediately signed by the producers of Hannah Montana after hearing her work with Carlock and seeing her perform at the House Of Blues in Hollywood. Shelby soon after adopted the name Shelby Cobra and became lead singer for KSM, on Walt Disney Records.

{"id": "2117647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117647", "title": "July Crisis", "text": "July Crisis\n\nThe July Crisis was a series of interrelated diplomatic and military escalations among the major powers of Europe in the summer of 1914 that was the ultimate cause of World War I. The crisis began on June 28, 1914, when Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne. A complex web of alliances, coupled with miscalculations by many leaders that war was in their best interests or that a general war would not occur, resulted in a general outbreak of hostilities among almost every major European nation in early August 1914; nearly every major European nation was involved by May 1915.\n\nAustria-Hungary viewed the irredentist movements of South Slavs, as promoted by Serbia, to be a threat to the unity of the nation. Following the assassination, Austria sought to inflict a military blow on Serbia to demonstrate strength and so Serbia would be more cautious about supporting Yugoslav nationalism. However, it was wary of the reaction of the Russian Empire, who were a major supporter of Serbia, so sought a guarantee from its ally Germany that it would support Austria in any conflict. Germany guaranteed its support, but urged Austria to attack quickly, while world sympathy for Ferdinand was high, in order to localize the war and avoid drawing in Russia. Some German leaders believed that growing Russian economic power would change the balance of power between the two nations, that a war was inevitable, and that Germany would be better off if a war happened soon. However, rather than a quick attack with available military forces, Austrian leaders deliberated into mid-July before deciding that it would give Serbia a harsh ultimatum on 23 July and would not attack without a full mobilisation of its army that could not be accomplished before 25 July 1914.\n\nJust prior to the Serbian reply to the ultimatum, Russia decided that it would intervene in any AustroSerbian war and ordered a partial mobilization of its armed forces. While Russian military leadership acknowledged that Russia was not yet strong enough for a general war, Russia believed the Austrian grievance against Serbia was a pretext orchestrated by Germany and that it needed to show strength by protecting its Serbian ally. This mobilization was the first major military action not by a direct participant in the conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia; it increased the willingness of Serbia to defy the threat of an Austrian attack and greatly increased the alarm in Germany about masses of Russian troops being assembled near its borders. Previously, the German military predicted that Russian mobilization would be slower than that of its French ally on Germany's opposite border; therefore, German military strategy in any conflict with Russia was to attack France through Belgium to avoid French fixed defenses and quickly defeat France in the west before turning to face Russia in the east. France was aware that it would have to act together with its Russian ally to defeat its German rival, so escalated its preparations as tensions along the Russian border increased, which in turn further alarmed Germany.\n\nWhile Great Britain was aligned with Russia and France, it also had relatively friendly diplomatic relations with Germany, and many British leaders saw no compelling reason to involve Britain in a Continental war. Britain repeatedly offered to mediate, using the Serbian reply as the basis of negotiation, and Germany made various promises in an attempt to ensure British neutrality. However, Britain decided that it had a moral obligation to defend Belgium and aid its formal allies, becoming the last major nation actively involved in the July Crisis to formally enter the conflict on 4 August. By early August, the ostensible reason for armed conflict, the dispute between Serbia and Austria-Hungary over the murdered heir, had already become a sidenote to a general European war.\n\nAustria-Hungary had annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908. Sarajevo was the provincial capital. Oskar Potiorek was the military commander and governor of the province. Emperor Franz Joseph ordered Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, to attend military exercises due to be held in Bosnia. After the exercises, on 28 June 1914, Ferdinand toured Sarajevo with his wife, Sophie. Six armed irredentists, five Serbs and one Bosnian Muslim, coordinated by Danilo Ilić, lay in wait along Ferdinand's announced motorcade route.\n\nAt 10:10 a.m., Nedeljko Čabrinović threw a hand grenade at Ferdinand's motorcade. Subsequently, Gavrilo Princip shot and killed Ferdinand and Sophie as they traveled to visit wounded in the hospital. Čabrinović and Princip took cyanide, but it only sickened them. Both were arrested. Within 45 minutes of the shooting, Princip began telling his story to interrogators. The next day, based on the interrogations of the two assassins, Potiorek telegraphed to Vienna that Princip and Čabrinović had conspired in Belgrade with others to obtain bombs, revolvers, and money to kill Ferdinand. A police dragnet quickly caught most of the conspirators.\n\nImmediately following the assassinations, Serbian envoy to France Milenko Vesnić and Serbian envoy to Russia Miroslav Spalajković put out statements claiming that Serbia had warned Austria-Hungary of the impending assassination. Serbia soon thereafter denied making warnings and denied knowledge of the plot. By 30 June, Austro-Hungarian and German diplomats were requesting investigations from their Serbian and Russian counterparts, but were rebuffed. On 5 July, based on interrogations of the accused assassins, Governor Potiorek telegraphed Vienna that Serbian Major Voja Tankosić had directed the assassins. The next day, Austrian chargé d'affaires Count Otto von Czernin proposed to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Sazonov that the instigators of the plot against Ferdinand needed to be investigated within Serbia, but he too was rebuffed.\n\nAustria-Hungary immediately undertook a criminal investigation. Ilić and five of the assassins were promptly arrested and interviewed by an investigating judge. The three assassins who had come from Serbia told almost all they knew: Serbian Major Vojislav Tankosić had directly and indirectly given them six Vasic Model M12, Serbian Army issue hand grenades (produced at the Kragujevac Royal Serbian Arsenal), four, brand new, Browning 1910 semiautomatic pistols, training, money, suicide pills, a special map with the location of gendarmes marked, knowledge of an infiltration channel from Serbia to Sarajevo, and a card authorizing the use of that channel.\n\nWithin Serbia, there was popular rejoicing over the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. Because Serbian elections were scheduled for 14 August, Prime Minister Nikola Pašić was unwilling to court unpopularity by being seen to bow down to Austria. If he had actually warned the Austrians in advance of the plot against Franz Ferdinand, Pašić was probably concerned about his chances at the polls and perhaps his life being endangered if news of them leaked out.\n\nLéon Descos, French Ambassador to Belgrade, on 1 July reported that a Serbian military party was involved in the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, that Serbia was in the wrong, and that Russian Ambassador Hartwig was in constant conversations with Regent Alexander to guide Serbia through this crisis. The \"military party\" was a reference to Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence, Dragutin Dimitrijević and the officers he led in the 1903 murder of the King and Queen of Serbia. Their acts led to the installation of the dynasty ruled by King Peter and Regent Alexander. Serbia requested and France arranged the replacement of Descos with the more hawkish who arrived on 25 July.\n\nWhile few mourned Franz Ferdinand himself, many ministers argued the assassination of the heir to the throne was a challenge to Austria that must be avenged. This was especially true of Foreign Minister Leopold Berchtold; in October 1913, his ultimatum to Serbia made them back down over the occupation of Northern Albania, which gave him confidence it would work again. \n\nMembers of the \"War Party\", like Conrad von Hötzendorf, Chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff saw it as an opportunity to destroy Serbia's ability to interfere in Bosnia. Moreover, the Archduke, who had been a voice for peace in the previous years, had now been removed from the discussions. The assassination combined with existing instability in the Balkans to send deep shockwaves through the Austrian elite. The murder has been described by historian Christopher Clark as a \"9/11 effect, a terrorist event charged with historic meaning, transforming the political chemistry in Vienna\".\n\nBetween 29 June to 1 July, Berchtold and Conrad debated an appropriate response to the events in Sarajevo; Conrad wanted to declare war on Serbia as soon as possible, stating: \"If you have a poisonous adder at your heel, you stamp on its head, you don't wait for the bite.\" He advocated immediate mobilization against Serbia, while Berchtold wanted to ensure public opinion be prepared first. On 30 June, Berchtold suggested they demand Serbia disband anti-Austrian societies and relieve certain officials of their responsibilities but Conrad continued to argue for the use of force. On 1 July, Berchtold told Conrad that Emperor Franz Joseph would await the criminal inquiry results, that István Tisza, Prime Minister of Hungary, was opposed to war, and that Karl von Stürgkh, Prime Minister of Austria, hoped that the criminal inquiry would provide a proper basis for action. \n\nOpinion in Vienna was divided; Berchtold now agreed with Conrad and supported war, as did Franz Joseph, although he insisted German support was a prerequisite, while Tisza was opposed; he correctly predicted war with Serbia would trigger one with Russia and hence a general European war. The pro-war party saw it as a reactionary means of re-invigorating the Habsburg monarchy, restoring it to the vigour and virility of an imagined past, and that Serbia must be dealt with before it became too powerful to defeat militarily.\n\nConrad continued to push for war but worried what attitude Germany would take; Berchtold replied that he planned to inquire of Germany what its position was. Berchtold used his memo of 14 June 1914, proposing Serbia's destruction, as the basis for the document that would be used to solicit German support.\n\nOn 1 July, Viktor Naumann, a German journalist and friend of German Foreign Secretary Gottlieb von Jagow, approached Berchtold's chief of cabinet, Alexander, Count of Hoyos. Naumann's advice was that it was time to annihilate Serbia and that Germany could be expected to stand by her ally. The next day, German Ambassador Heinrich von Tschirschky spoke to Emperor Franz Joseph and stated that it was his estimate that Wilhelm II would support resolute, well-thought-out action by Austria-Hungary with regard to Serbia.\n\nOn 2 July, the Saxon Ambassador in Berlin wrote back to his king that the German Army wanted Austria to attack Serbia as quickly as possible because the time was right for a general war since Germany was more prepared for war than either Russia or France. On 3 July, the Saxon military attaché in Berlin reported that the German General Staff \"would be pleased if war were to come about now\".\n\nEmperor Wilhelm II came to share the views of the German General Staff and declared on 4 July that he was entirely for \"settling accounts with Serbia\". He ordered the German ambassador in Vienna, Count Heinrich von Tschirschky, to stop advising restraint, writing that \"Tschirschky will be so good to drop this nonsense. We must finish with the Serbs, \"quickly\". Now or never!\". In response, Tschirschky told the Austro-Hungarian government that next day that \"Germany would support the Monarchy through thick and thin, whatever action it decided to take against Serbia. The sooner Austria-Hungary struck, the better\". On 5 July 1914, Count Moltke, the Chief of the German General Staff, wrote that \"Austria must beat the Serbs\".\n\nIn order to ensure Germany's full support, the Chef de Cabinet of the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Ministry Count Alexander von Hoyos visited Berlin on 5 July. On 24 June, Austria-Hungary had prepared a letter for its ally outlining the challenges in the Balkans and how to address them, but Franz Ferdinand was assassinated before it could be delivered. According to the letter, Romania was no longer a reliable ally especially since the Russo-Romanian summit meeting of 14 June in Constanța. Russia was working toward an alliance of Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, and Montenegro against Austria-Hungary, dismemberment of Austria-Hungary, and the movement of borders from east to west. To break up this effort, Germany and Austria-Hungary should first ally with Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire. To this letter was added a post-script on the Sarajevo Outrage and its impact. Finally, Emperor Franz Joseph added his own letter to Emperor Wilhelm II which closed with advocating the end of Serbia as a political power factor. Hoyos was dispatched to Germany to present these letters. The letters were presented to Wilhelm II on 5 July. \n\nVon Hoyos provided Austro-Hungarian Ambassador Count Ladislaus de Szögyény-Marich with two documents, one of which was a memo by Tisza, advising that Bulgaria should join the Triple Alliance, and another letter by Franz Joseph I of Austria stating that the only way of preventing the disintegration of the Dual Monarchy was \"to eliminate Serbia\" as a state. The letter by Franz Joseph was based closely upon Berchtold's 14 June memo calling for the destruction of Serbia. Franz Josef's letter explicitly stated that the decision for war against Serbia had been made before the assassination of the Archduke, and that the events of Sarajevo only confirmed the already pre-existing need for a war against Serbia.\n\nAfter meeting with Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to Germany Szögyény on 5 July, the German Emperor informed him that his state could \"count on Germany's full support\", even if \"grave European complications\" ensued, and that Austria-Hungary \"ought to march at once\" against Serbia. He added that \"in any case, as things stood today, Russia was not at all ready for war, and would certainly think long before appealing to arms\". Even if Russia were to act in defence of Serbia, Wilhelm promised that Germany would do everything in its power, including war, to support Austria-Hungary. Wilhelm added that he needed to consult with Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, who he was quite sure would have a similar view. \n\nAfter his meeting, Szögyény reported to Vienna that Wilhelm \"would regret it if we [Austria-Hungary] let this present chance, which was so favourable for us, go by without utilising it\". This so-called \"blank cheque\" of German support up to and including war was to be the main determining factor in Austrian policy in July 1914. \n\nAt another meeting held on 5 July, this one at Potsdam palace, German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, the Foreign Ministry's State Secretary Arthur Zimmermann, the Minister of War Erich von Falkenhayn, the head of the German Imperial Military Cabinet Moriz von Lyncker, the Adjutant general Hans von Plessen, Captain Hans Zenker of the Naval General Staff, and Admiral Eduard von Capelle of the Naval State Secretariat all endorsed Wilhelm's \"blank cheque\" as Germany's best policy. On 6 July, Hoyos, Zimmerman, Bethmann-Hollweg, and Austro-Hungarian Ambassador Szögyény met and Germany gave its \"blank cheque\" commitment to Austria-Hungary of firm support.\n\nOn 6 July, Bethmann-Hollweg and Zimmermann further repeated the promise of Wilhelm's \"blank cheque\" at a conference with Szögyény. Although Bethmann-Hollweg stated that the decision for war or peace was in Austria's hands, he strongly advised that Austria choose the former. That same day, British Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey was warned by the German Ambassador in London, Prince Lichnowsky, of the dangerous situation in the Balkans. Grey felt that Anglo-German co-operation could resolve any Austro-Serbian dispute, and he \"believed that a peaceful solution would be reached\".\n\nWhen asked if Germany was ready for a war against Russia and France, Falkenhayn replied with a \"curt affirmative\". Later on 17 July, the Army's Quartermaster general Count Waldersee wrote to Gottlieb von Jagow, Foreign Minister: \"I can move at a moment's notice. We in the General Staff are \"ready\": there is nothing more for us to do at this juncture\".\n\nAs Wilhelm himself stated in private \"in order not to alarm world opinion\", the Kaiser left on his annual North Sea cruise. Shortly after, Wilhelm's close friend Gustav Krupp von Bohlen wrote that the Emperor said that we would not waver in declaring war if Russia mobilized. In the same way, Berchtold suggested that Austrian leaders go on vacation \"to prevent any disquiet\" about what had been decided.\n\nGermany's policy was to support a swift war to destroy Serbia that would present a \"fait accompli\" to the world. Unlike the three earlier cases dating from 1912 when Austria had asked for German diplomatic support for a war against Serbia, this time it was felt that political conditions for such a war now existed. At this time, the German military supported the idea of an Austrian attack against Serbia as the best way of starting a general war, whereas Wilhelm believed that an armed conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia would be purely local. Austrian policy based upon pre-existing plans to destroy Serbia involved not waiting to complete judicial inquiries to strike back immediately and not to strain its credibility in the coming weeks as it would become more and more clear that Austria was not reacting to the assassination. Likewise, Germany wished to give the impression of its ignorance of Austrian intentions.\n\nThe thinking was that, as Austria-Hungary was Germany's only ally, if its prestige was not restored then its position in the Balkans might be irreparably damaged, encouraging further irredentism by Serbia and Romania. A quick war against Serbia would not only eliminate her, but also probably lead to further diplomatic gains vis a vis Bulgaria and Romania. A Serbian defeat would also be a defeat for Russia and reduce her influence in the Balkans.\n\nThe benefits were clear but there were risks, namely that Russia would intervene and this would lead to a continental war. However, this was thought even more unlikely since the Russians had not yet finished their French-funded rearmament programme scheduled for completion in 1917. Moreover, they did not believe that Russia, as an absolute monarchy, would support regicides, and more broadly \"the mood across Europe was so anti-Serbian that even Russia would not intervene\". Personal factors also weighed heavily and the German Kaiser was close to the murdered Franz Ferdinand and was affected by his death, to the extent that German counsels of restraint vis a vis Serbia in 1913 changed to an aggressive stance.\n\nOn the other hand, the military thought that if Russia did intervene then St Petersburg clearly desired war and now would be a better time to fight, when Germany had a guaranteed ally in Austria-Hungary, Russia was not ready and Europe was sympathetic to them. On balance, at this point in the crisis, the Germans anticipated that their support would mean the war would be a localised affair between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. This would be particularly true if Austria moved quickly, \"while the other European powers were still disgusted over the assassinations and therefore likely to be sympathetic to any action Austria-Hungary took\".\n\nOn 7 July, the Council of Joint Ministers debated Austria-Hungary's course of action. The most hawkish on the Council considered a surprise attack on Serbia. Count Tisza persuaded the Council that demands should be placed on Serbia before mobilization to provide a proper \"juridical basis for a declaration of war\".\n\nSamuel R. Williamson, Jr. has emphasized the role of Austria-Hungary in starting the war. Convinced Serbian nationalism and Russian Balkan ambitions were disintegrating the Empire, Austria-Hungary hoped for a limited war against Serbia and that strong German support would force Russia to keep out of the war and weaken its Balkan prestige.\n\nAt this stage in the crisis the possibility of determined Russian support for Serbia, and its attendant risks, was never properly weighed up. The Austrians remained fixated on Serbia but did not decide on their precise objectives other than war.\n\nNevertheless, having decided upon war with German support, Austria was slow to act publicly, and did not deliver the ultimatum until July 23, some three weeks after the assassinations on 28 June. Thus Austria lost the reflex sympathies attendant to the Sarajevo murders and gave the further impression to the Entente powers that Austria was merely using the assassinations as a pretext for aggression. \n\nThe Council agreed on putting harsh demands on Serbia but could not reach consensus on how harsh. Except for Count Tisza, the Council intended to make such harsh demands that their rejection would be very probable. Tisza held out for demands that while harsh would not appear impossible to meet. Both views were sent to the Emperor on 8 July. The Emperor's opinion was that the gap in opinion could most likely be bridged. An initial set of demands was drafted during the Council meeting. Over the next few days, the demands were reinforced, possibly with the help of the German Foreign Office to make sure there was a war, and made more iron-clad and difficult for Serbia to accept.\n\nOn 7 July, on his return to Vienna, Count Hoyos reported to Austro-Hungarian Crown Council that Austria had Germany's full support even if \"measures against Serbia should bring about a big war\". At the Crown Council, Berchtold strongly urged that a war against Serbia be begun as soon as possible.\n\nAt that meeting of the Crown Council, all involved were in full favour of war except Hungarian Prime Minister István Tisza. Tisza warned that any attack on Serbia \"would, as far as can humanly be foreseen, lead to an intervention by Russia and hence a world war\". The rest of the participants debated about whether Austria should just launch an unprovoked attack or issue an ultimatum to Serbia with demands so stringent that it was bound to be rejected. Austrian Prime Minister Stürgkh warned Tisza that if Austria did not launch a war, its \"policy of hesitation and weakness\" would cause Germany to abandon Austria-Hungary as an ally. All present, except Tisza, finally agreed that Austria-Hungary should present an ultimatum designed to be rejected.\n\nStarting 7 July, the German Ambassador to Austria-Hungary, Heinrich von Tschirschky, and Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Berchtold held almost daily meetings about how to co-ordinate the diplomatic action to justify a war against Serbia. On 8 July, Tschirschky presented Berchtold with a message from Wilhelm who declared he \"stated most emphatically that Berlin expected the Monarchy to act against Serbia, and that Germany would not understand it, if ... the present opportunity were allowed to go by ... without a blow struck\". At the same meeting, Tschirschky told Berchtold, \"if we [Austria-Hungary] compromised or bargained with Serbia, Germany would interpret this as a confession of weakness, which could not be without effect on our position in the Triple Alliance and on Germany's future policy\". On 7 July, Bethmann Hollweg told his aide and close friend Kurt Riezler that \"action against Serbia can lead to a world war\". Bethmann Hollweg felt such a \"leap in the dark\" was justified by the international situation. Bethmann Hollweg told Riezler that Germany was \"completely paralysed\" and that the \"future belongs to Russia which is growing and growing, and is becoming an ever increasing nightmare to us\". Riezler went to write in his diary that Bethmann Hollweg painted a \"devastating picture\" with Russia building rail-roads in Congress Poland that allow Russia to mobilize faster once the Great Military Programme was finished in 1917, and that an Austro-Serbian war would probably cause a world war, \"which would lead to an overthrow of the existing order\", but since the \"existing order was lifeless and void of ideas\", such a war could only be welcomed as a blessing to Germany. Bethmann Hollweg's fears about Russia led him to credit Anglo-Russian naval talks in May 1914 as the beginning of an \"encirclement\" policy against Germany that could only be broken through war. After Anglo-French naval talks had taken place, the Russians demanded the same courtesy be extended to them, which led to inconclusive Anglo-Russian naval talks.\n\nOn 8 July, Tisza informed another meeting of the Crown Council that any attack on Serbia was bound to lead to \"intervention by Russia and consequently world war\". On the same day, Kurt Riezler's diary has his friend Bethmann Hollweg saying: \"If the war comes from the East, so that we are marching to Austria-Hungary's aid instead of Austria-Hungary to ours, then we have a chance of winning it. If war does not come, if the Czar does not want it or France dismayed, counsels peace, then we still have a chance of maneuvering the Entente apart over this action.\"\n\nOn 9 July, Berchtold advised the Emperor that he would present Belgrade with an ultimatum containing demands that were designed to be rejected. This would ensure a war without the \"odium of attacking Serbia without warning, put her in the wrong\", and ensure that Britain and Romania would remain neutral. On 10 July, Berchtold told Tschirschky he would present Serbia with an ultimatum containing \"unacceptable demands\" as the best way of causing war, but \"chief care\" would be taken about how to present these \"unacceptable demands\". In response, Wilhelm wrote angrily on the margins of Tschirschky's dispatch \"They had time enough for that!\"\nIt took the week of 7–14 July to persuade Tisza to support war. On 9 July, Prince Lichnowsky, the German Ambassador in London was told by British Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey that he \"saw no reason for taking a pessimistic view of the situation\". Despite Tisza's opposition, Berchtold had ordered his officials to start drafting an ultimatum to Serbia on 10 July. The German Ambassador reported that \"Count Berchtold appeared to hope that Serbia would not agree to the Austro-Hungarian demands, as a mere diplomatic victory would put the country here again in a stagnant mood\". Count Hoyos told a German diplomat \"that the demands were really of such a nature that no nation that still possessed self-respect and dignity could possibly accept them\".\n\nOn 11 July, Tschirschky reported to Jagow that he \"again took the occasion to discuss with Berchtold what action was to be taken against Serbia, chiefly in order to assure the minister once again, emphatically that speedy action was called for\". On the same day, the German Foreign Office wanted to know if they should send a telegram congratulating King Peter of Serbia on his birthday. Wilhelm replied that not doing so might attract attention. On 12 July, Szögyény reported from Berlin that everyone in the German government wanted to see Austria-Hungary declare war on Serbia at once, and were tired of Austrian indecision about whether to choose war or peace.\n\nOn 12 July, Berchtold showed Tschirschky the contents of his ultimatum containing \"unacceptable demands\", and promised to present it to the Serbs after the Franco-Russian summit between President Poincaré and Nicholas II was over. Wilhelm wrote on the margins of Tschirschky's dispatch \"What a pity!\" that the ultimatum would be presented so late in July. By 14 July, Tisza agreed to support war out of fear that a policy of peace would lead to Germany renouncing the Dual Alliance of 1879. On that day, Tschirschky reported to Berlin that Austria-Hungary would present an ultimatum \"which would almost certainly be rejected and should result in war\". That same day, Jagow sent instructions to Prince Lichnowsky, the German Ambassador in London, stating Germany had decided to do everything within its power to cause an Austro-Serbian war, but Germany must avoid the impression \"that we were egging Austria on to war\".\n\nJagow described a war against Serbia as Austria-Hungary's last chance at \"political rehabilitation\". He stated that under no circumstances did he want a peaceful solution, and though he did not want a preventive war, he would not \"jib at the post\" if such a war came because Germany was ready for it, and Russia \"fundamentally was not\". Russia and Germany being destined to fight each other, Jagow believed that now was the best time for the inevitable war, because: \"in a few years Russia ... will be ready. Then she will crush us on land by weight of numbers, and she will have her Baltic Fleet and her strategic railroads ready. Our group meanwhile is getting weaker\".\n\nJagow's belief that the summer of 1914 was the best time for Germany to go to war was widely shared in the German government. Many German officials believed that the \"Teuton race\" and \"Slav race\" were destined to fight each other in a terrible \"race war\" for the domination of Europe, and that now was the best time for such a war to come. The Chief of the German General Staff, Moltke, told Count Lerchenfeld, the Bavarian Minister in Berlin, that \"a moment so favourable from the military point of view might never occur again\". Moltke argued that due to the alleged superiority of German weaponry and training, combined with the recent change in the French Army from a two-year to a three-year period of service, Germany could easily defeat both France and Russia in 1914.\n\nOn 13 July, Austrian investigators into the assassination of Franz Ferdinand reported to Berchtold that there was little evidence that the Serbian government had abetted the murders. This report depressed Berchtold as it meant there was little evidence to support his pretext of Serbian government involvement in Franz Ferdinand's assassination.\n\nOn 14 July, the Austrians assured the Germans that the ultimatum to be delivered to Serbia \"is being composed so that the possibility of its acceptance is \"practically excluded\"\". That same day, Conrad, the Chief of the General Staff of the Austro-Hungarian Army, told Berchtold that due to his desire to get the summer harvest in, the earliest that Austria could declare war was 25 July. At the same time, the visit of the French President and Premier to St. Petersburg meant that it was considered undesirable to present the ultimatum until the visit was over. The ultimatum, officially called a démarche, would not be delivered until 23 July with an expiry date of 25 July.\n\nOn 16 July, Bethmann Hollweg told Siegfried von Roedern, the State Secretary for Alsace-Lorraine, that he couldn't care less about Serbia or alleged Serbian complicity in the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. All that mattered was that Austria attack Serbia that summer, to result in a win-win situation for Germany. If Bethmann Hollweg's view was correct, an Austro-Serbian war would either cause a general war (which Bethmann Hollweg believed Germany would win) or cause the Triple Entente to break up. That same day, the Russian Ambassador to Austria-Hungary suggested to St. Petersburg that Russia should inform Austria-Hungary of its negative view of Austrian demands.\n\nThe Austrian Ambassador in St. Petersburg falsely told the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Sazonov, that Austria was not planning on any measure that might cause a war in the Balkans, so no Russian complaints were made.\n\nOn 17 July, Berchtold complained to of the German Embassy that though he thought his ultimatum would probably be rejected, he was still worried that it was possible for the Serbs to accept it, and wanted more time to re-phrase the document. Stolberg reported back to Berlin that he had told Berchtold that a lack of action would make Austria look weak. On 18 July, to reassure Stolberg, Count Hoyos promised him that the demands in the draft text of the ultimatum \"were really of such a nature that no nation that still possessed self-respect and dignity could possibly accept them\". The same day, in response to rumours about an Austrian ultimatum, the Serbian Prime Minister Pašić stated that he would not accept any measures compromising on Serbian sovereignty.\n\nOn 18 July, Hans Schoen, a Bavarian diplomat in Berlin, told the Bavarian Prime Minister Count Georg von Hertling that Austria was only making a pretence \"of being peacefully inclined\". Commenting on the draft text of the ultimatum shown to him by German diplomats, Schoen noted that Serbia would not be able to accept the demands, so the result would be war.\n\nZimmermann told Schoen that a powerful and successful move against Serbia would save Austria-Hungary from internal disintegration, and that was why Germany had given Austria \"a blank power of full authority, even at the risk of a war with Russia\".\n\nOn 19 July, the Crown Council in Vienna decided upon the wording of the ultimatum to be presented to Serbia on 23 July. The extent of German influence was evident when Jagow ordered Berchtold to delay the ultimatum by an hour to make sure that the French President and Premier were at sea after their summit in St. Petersburg. The first draft of the ultimatum had been shown to the German Embassy in Vienna on 12 July and the final text was provided in advance to the German Embassy on 22 July.\n\nDue to Austria's delay in writing the ultimatum, the element of surprise that Germany had counted upon in the war against Serbia was lost. Instead, the strategy of \"localization\" was adopted, which meant that when the Austro-Serbian war began, Germany would pressure other powers not to become involved even at the risk of war. On 19 July, Jagow published a note in the semi-official North German Gazette warning other powers \"that the settlement of differences which may arise between Austria-Hungary and Serbia should remain localized\". Asked by Jules Cambon, the French Ambassador to Germany, how he knew about the contents of the Austrian ultimatum as he had revealed in the North German Gazette, Gottlieb von Jagow pretended to be ignorant of it. Sir Horace Rumbold of the British Embassy in Berlin reported that it was likely that Austria was operating with German assurances. \n\nThough Jagow's pretence was not widely believed, it was still believed at the time that Germany was aiming for peace, and could restrain Austria. General Helmuth von Moltke of the German General Staff again strongly approved of the idea of an Austrian attack on Serbia as the best way of bringing about the desired world war.\n\nOn 20 July, the German government informed the directors of the Norddeutscher Lloyd and Hamburg America Line shipping companies that Austria would soon present an ultimatum that might cause a general European war, and they should start withdrawing their ships from foreign waters back to the Reich at once. That same day, the German Navy was ordered to concentrate the High Seas Fleet, in case of a general war. Riezler's diary states Bethmann Hollweg saying on 20 July that Russia with its \"growing demands and tremendous dynamic power would be impossible to repel in a few years, especially if the present European constellation continues to exist\". Riezler ended his diary noting that Bethmann Hollweg was \"determined and taciturn\", and quoted his former Foreign Minister Kiderlen-Waechter who \"had always said we must fight\".\n\nOn 21 July, the German government told Jules Cambon, the French Ambassador in Berlin, and Bronewski, the Russian chargé d'affaires, that the German Reich had no knowledge of what Austrian policy was towards Serbia. In private, Zimmermann wrote that the German government \"entirely agreed that Austria must take advantage of the favourable moment, even at the risk of further complications\", but that he doubted \"whether Vienna would nerve herself to act\". Zimmermann ended his memo that \"he gathered that Vienna, timid and undecided as it always was, was almost sorry\" that Germany had given the \"blank cheque\" of 5 July 1914, instead of advising restraint with Serbia. Conrad himself was pressuring the Dual Monarchy for \"haste\" in starting a war, in order to prevent Serbia from \"smelling a rat and herself volunteering compensation, perhaps under pressure from France and Russia\". On 22 July, Germany refused an Austrian request to have the German Minister in Belgrade present the ultimatum to Serbia because as Jagow had said, it would look too much \"as though we were egging Austria on to make war\".\n\nOn 23 July, the whole German military and political leadership ostentatiously went on vacation. Count Schoen, the Bavarian chargé d'affaires in Berlin reported to Munich that Germany would act surprised by the Austrian ultimation. However, on 19 July—four days before the ultimatum was presented—Jagow asked all German Ambassadors (except for Austria-Hungary) to pass along support for Austrian action against Serbia. Jagow realized that this statement was incompatible with his claims of ignorance, thus leading to a hasty second dispatch claiming total ignorance of the Austrian ultimatum, but threatening \"incalculable consequences\" if any power tried to stop Austria-Hungary from attacking Serbia if the ultimatum were rejected.\n\nWhen Friedrich von Pourtalès, the German Ambassador in St. Petersburg, reported that the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Sazonov warned that Germany \"must reckon with Europe\" if she supported an Austrian attack against Serbia, Wilhelm wrote on the margin of Pourtalès's dispatch \"No! Russia, yes!\" In supporting an Austrian war with Serbia, Germany's leaders knew the risks of a general war. As the historian Fritz Fischer pointed out, this could be proven by Jagow's request to know the full itinerary of Wilhelm's North Sea cruise before the Austrian ultimatum was presented.\n\nOn 22 July, before the ultimatum was delivered, the Austrian government asked that the German government deliver the Austrian declaration of war when the ultimatum expired on 25 July. Jagow refused, stating: \"Our standpoint has to be that the quarrel with Serbia is an Austro-Hungarian internal affair.\" On 23 July, the Austrian Minister in Belgrade, Baron Giesl von Gieslingen, presented the ultimatum to the Serbian government. At the same time, and having a strong expectation of Serbian rejection, the Austrian Army opened its war book, and began preparations for hostilities.\n\nFrench President Raymond Poincaré and Prime Minister René Viviani departed for Saint Petersburg on 15 July, arrived on 20 July and departed on 23 July. \n\nThe French and the Russians agreed their alliance extended to supporting Serbia against Austria, confirming the already established policy behind the . As Christopher Clark notes \"Poincare had come to preach the gospel of firmness and his words had fallen on ready ears. Firmness in this context meant an intransigent opposition to any Austrian measure against Serbia. At no point do the sources suggest that Poincare or his Russian interlocutors gave any thought whatsoever to what measures Austria-Hungary might legitimately be entitled to take in the aftermath of the assassinations\". The delivery of the Austrian ultimatum was intended to coincide with the departure of the French delegation from Russia on 23 July. The meetings were centrally concerned with the crisis unfolding in central Europe.\n\nOn 21 July, the Russian Foreign Minister warned the German ambassador to Russia that \"Russia would not be able to tolerate Austria-Hungary's using threatening language to Serbia or taking military measures\". The leaders in Berlin discounted this threat of war. German foreign minister Gottlieb von Jagow noted \"there is certain to be some blustering in St. Petersburg\". German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg told his assistant that Britain and France did not realize that Germany would go to war if Russia mobilized. He thought London saw a German \"bluff\" and was responding with a \"counterbluff\". Political scientist James Fearon argues from this episode that the Germans believed Russia were expressing greater verbal support for Serbia than they would actually provide, in order to pressure Germany and Austria-Hungary to accept some Russian demands in negotiation. Meanwhile, Berlin was downplaying its actual strong support for Vienna so as to not appear the aggressor, for that would alienate German socialists.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian ultimatum demanded that Serbia formally and publicly condemn the \"dangerous propaganda\" against Austria-Hungary, the ultimate aim of which, it claimed, is to \"detach from the Monarchy territories belonging to it\". Moreover, Belgrade should \"suppress by every means this criminal and terrorist propaganda\". Serbia was given 48 hours to comply.\n\nIn addition, the Serbian government should\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Government, concluding the document, was expecting the reply of the Serbian Government at the latest by 6 o'clock on Saturday evening, 25 July 1914. An appendix listed various details from \"the crime investigation undertaken at court in Sarajevo against Gavrilo Princip and his comrades on account of the assassination\", which allegedly demonstrated the culpability and assistance provided to the conspirators by various Serbian officials.\n\nInstructions were given to the Austrian Minister in Belgrade, Baron von Gieslingen, whereby if \"no unconditionally positive answer\" was received from the Serbian government within \"the 48-hour deadline\" of the ultimatum (\"as measured from the day and hour of your announcing it\"), the Minister should proceed to leave the Austro-Hungarian Embassy of Belgrade together with all its personnel.\n\nOn the night of 23 July, Serbian Regent Crown Prince Alexander visited the Russian legation to \"express his despair over the Austrian ultimatum, compliance with which he regards as an absolute impossibility for a state which had the slightest regard for its dignity\". Both the Regent and Pašić asked for Russian support, which was refused. Sazonov offered the Serbs only moral support while Nicholas told the Serbs to simply accept the ultimatum, and hope that international opinion would force the Austrians to change their minds. Both Russia and France, because of their military weaknesses, were most disinclined to risk a war with Germany in 1914, and hence the pressure on Serbia to accede to the terms of the Austrian ultimatum. Because the Austrians had repeatedly promised the Russians that nothing was planned against Serbia that summer, their harsh ultimatum did not do much to antagonize Sazonov.\n\nConfronted with the ultimatum and the lack of support from other European powers, the Serbian Cabinet worked out a compromise. Historians disagree on the extent to which the Serbs genuinely compromised. Some historians argue Serbia accepted all of the terms of the ultimatum except for the demand in point 6 that Austrian police be allowed to operate in Serbia. Others, notably Clark, argue the Serbs drafted their reply to the ultimatum in such a way as to give the impression of making significant concessions but: \"In reality, then, this was a highly perfumed rejection on most points\".\nThe German shipping tycoon Albert Ballin recalled that when the German government heard a misleading report that Serbia had accepted the ultimatum, there was \"disappointment\", but \"tremendous joy\" when it learned that the Serbs had not accepted all of the Austrian terms. When Ballin suggested Wilhelm end his North Sea cruise to deal with the crisis, the German Foreign Ministry flatly stated the Emperor should continue his cruise because \"everything must be done to ensure that he [Wilhelm] does not interfere in things with his pacifist ideas\". At the same time, a message was sent to Berchtold from his ambassador in Berlin reminding him \"Here every delay in the beginning of war operations is regarded as signifying the danger that foreign powers might interfere. We are urgently advised to proceed without delay.\"\nIn a letter to Venetia Stanley, British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith outlined the sequence of events that might lead to a general war, but noted that there was no reason for Britain to become involved. The First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, wrote, \"Europe is trembling on the verge of a general war. The Austrian ultimatum to Serbia being the most insolent document of its kind ever devised\", but believed that Britain would stay neutral in the coming war. Grey suggested to the Austrian ambassador that the deadline for the ultimatum be extended as the best way of saving the peace. When Grey told his friend Lichnowsky that \"Any nation that accepted conditions like that would really cease to count as an independent nation\", Wilhelm wrote on the margin of Lichnowsky's report \"That would be very desirable. It is not a nation in the European sense, but a band of robbers!\"\n\nThe Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Sazonov sent a message to all of the great powers asking them to pressure Austria to extend the deadline of the ultimatum. Sazonov asked the Austrian government to back its claims of Serbian complicity in the killing of Franz Ferdinand by releasing the results of its official inquiry, which the Austrians refused to do as they lacked any conclusive as opposed to circumstantial evidence. Several times, the Austrians refused Russian requests to extend the deadline, despite warnings that an Austro-Serbian war could easily cause a world war. Sazonov accused the Austrian ambassador of intending to war with Serbia.\n\nOn 23 July, British Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey made a mediation offer with a promise that his government would attempt to influence Russia to influence Serbia, and Germany to influence Austria-Hungary as the best way of stopping a general war. Wilhelm wrote on the margins of Lichnowsky's dispatch containing Grey's offer that Britain's \"condescending orders\" were to be totally rejected, and Austria-Hungary would not retract any of its \"impossible demands\" on Serbia. He continued: \"Am I to do that? Wouldn’t think of it! What does he [Grey] mean by ‘impossible’?\" Jagow ordered Lichnowsky to tell Grey of the supposed German ignorance of the Austrian ultimatum, and that Germany regarded Austro-Serbian relations as \"an internal affair of Austria-Hungary, in which we had no standing to intervene\". Jagow's statement did much to discredit Germany in British eyes. Lichnowsky reported to Berlin \"If we do not join the mediation, all faith here in us and in our love of peace will be shattered.\"\n\nAt the same time, Grey met with opposition from the Russian Ambassador who warned that a conference with Germany, Italy, France, and Britain serving as the mediators between Austria and Russia would break apart the informal Triple Entente. Sazonov accepted Grey's proposal for a conference despite his reservations about the dangers of splitting the Triple Entente, Grey wrote to Sazonov that Britain did not have a cause to war with Serbia, but subsequent developments might drag Britain into the conflict.\n\nStarting 23 July, all of Germany's leaders returned secretly to Berlin to deal with the crisis. A division opened between those led by Bethmann-Hollweg who wanted to see what would happen following an Austrian attack on Serbia, and the military led by Moltke and Falkenhayn, who urged that Germany immediately follow an Austrian attack on Serbia with a German attack on Russia. Moltke repeatedly stated that 1914 would be the best time for starting a \"preventive war\", or the Russian Great Military Programme would finish by 1917, making Germany unable to ever again risk a war. Moltke added that Russian mobilization was regarded as an opportunity to be sought rather than as a sort of threat, as it would allow Germany to go to war while presenting it as forced on Germany. The German military attaché in Russia reported that Russian preparations for mobilization were on a much smaller scale than was expected. Though Moltke at first argued that Germany should wait for Russia to mobilize before beginning the \"preventive war\", by the end of the week he urged that Germany should launch it anyway. In Moltke's view, in order to invade France successfully, Germany would need to seize the Belgian fortress of Liège by surprise. The longer the diplomatic action continued, the less likely Moltke thought that Liège could be stormed by surprise, and if Liège were not taken, then the entire Schlieffen Plan would be unhinged.\n\nOn 24 July, Zimmermann sent out a dispatch to all German ambassadors (except for Austria-Hungary) telling them to inform their host governments that Germany had no advance knowledge whatsoever of the ultimatum. That same day, Grey, who was worried by the tone of the ultimatum (which he felt seemed designed to be rejected), warned Lichnowsky of the dangers of \"European war \"à quatre\"\" (involving Russia, Austria, France and Germany) if Austrian troops entered Serbia. Grey suggested mediation between Italy, France, Germany, and Britain as the best way of stopping an Austro-Serbian war. Jagow sabotaged Grey's offer by waiting until after the ultimatum had expired to pass on the British offer. Jagow claimed that \"[w]e exercised no influence of any kind with regard to the contents of the note [the Austrian ultimatum]\", and that Germany \"was unable to counsel Vienna to retract\" because that would humiliate Austria too much. The Russian Ambassador to Britain warned Prince Lichnowsky: \"Only a government that wanted war could possibly write such a note [the Austrian ultimatum].\" Upon reading an account of a meeting in which Berchtold informed the Russian Ambassador of his country's peaceful intentions towards Russia, Wilhelm wrote on the margin \"absolutely superfluous!\" and called Berchtold an \"Ass!\"\n\nAlso on 24 July, after Berchtold met with the Russian chargé d'affaires, furious complaints were prompted from Berlin, warning that Austria should not engage in talks with any other powers in case a compromise might be worked out. That same day, Wilhelm wrote on the margin of a dispatch from Tschirschky, calling Austria-Hungary \"weak\" for not being aggressive enough in the Balkans, and writing that alteration in the power in the Balkans \"has got to come. Austria must become predominant in the Balkans as compared to the little ones, and at Russia’s expense.\" Count Szögyény reported to Vienna that \"here, it is generally taken for granted that if Serbia rejects our demands, \"we shall at once reply by declaring war\", and opening military operations. We are advised ... to confront the world with a \"fait accompli\" (emphasis in the original).\" When the German ambassador in Belgrade reported how sad the Serbian people were with being faced with the choice of either war or national humiliation, Wilhelm wrote on the margins of the report: \"Bravo! One would not have believed it of the Viennese! ... How hollow the whole Serbian power is proving itself to be; thus, it is seen to be with all the Slav nations! Just tread hard on the heels of that rabble!\"\n\n24 July marked the true beginning of the July Crisis. Until that point, the vast majority of the people in the world were ignorant of the machinations of the leaders in Berlin and Vienna, and there was no sense of crisis. A case in point was the British Cabinet, which had not discussed foreign affairs at all until 24 July.\n\nOn 24 July, the Serbian government, expecting an Austrian declaration of war the next day, mobilized while Austria broke off diplomatic relations. The British Ambassador to Austria-Hungary reported to London: \"War is thought imminent. Wildest enthusiasm prevails in Vienna.\" Asquith wrote in a letter to Venetia Stanley that he was worried that Russia was trying to entangle Britain in what he described as \"the most dangerous situation of the last 40 years\". To stop a war, the Permanent Secretary of the British Foreign Office, Sir Arthur Nicolson, suggested again that a conference be held in London chaired by Britain, Germany, Italy and France to resolve the dispute between Austria and Serbia.\nOn 25 July, Emperor Franz Joseph signed a mobilization order for eight army corps to begin operations against Serbia on 28 July; the Austro-Hungarian ambassador Giesl left Belgrade. The caretaker government in Paris cancelled all leave for French troops as of 26 July, and ordered the majority of French troops in Morocco to begin returning to France.\n\nOn 24–25 July the Russian Council of Ministers met. The Russian Agriculture Minister Alexander Krivoshein, who was especially trusted by Nicholas, argued that Russia was not militarily ready for a conflict with Germany and Austria-Hungary, and that it could achieve its objectives with a cautious approach. Sazonov stated that Russia had usually been moderate in its foreign policy, but that Germany had viewed its moderation as weakness to be taken advantage of. The Russian War Minister Vladimir Sukhomlinov and the Navy Minister Admiral Ivan Grigorovich stated that Russia was not ready for a war against either Austria or Germany, but that a firmer diplomatic stance was necessary. The Russian government again asked Austria to extend the deadline, and advised the Serbs to offer as little resistance as possible to the terms of the Austrian ultimatum. Finally to deter Austria from war, the Russian Council of Ministers ordered a partial mobilization against Austria.\n\nOn 25 July 1914, the council of ministers was held in Krasnoye Selo at which Tsar Nicholas II decided to intervene in the Austro-Serbian conflict, a step toward general war. He put the Russian army on alert on 25 July. Although this was not mobilization, it threatened the German and Austrian borders and looked like a military declaration of war.\n\nDespite the fact that she had no alliance with Serbia, the Council agreed to a secret partial mobilisation of over one million men of the Russian Army and the Baltic and Black Sea Fleets. It is worth stressing, since this is a cause of some confusion in general narratives of the war, that this was done prior to the Serbian rejection of the ultimatum, the Austrian declaration of war on 28 July or any military measures taken by Germany. As a diplomatic move this had limited value since the Russians did not make this mobilisation public until 28 July.\n\nThe arguments used to support this move in the Council of Ministers were:\n\nIn addition Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Sazonov believed that war was inevitable and refused to acknowledge that Austria-Hungary had a right to counter measures in the face of Serbian irredentism. On the contrary, Sazonov had aligned himself with the irredentism, and expected the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Crucially, the French had provided their clear support for their Russian allies for a robust response in their recent state visit just days before. Also in the background was Russian anxiety of the future of the Turkish straits – \"where Russian control of the Balkans would place Saint Petersburg in a far better position to prevent unwanted intrusions on the Bosphorus” \n\nChristopher Clark states, \"It would be difficult to overstate the historical importance of the meetings of 24 and 25 July\", as it emboldened Serbia and raised the stakes for Germany, which was still hoping for a conflict localized to the Balkans.\n\nRussian policy was to pressure the Serbs to accept the ultimatum as much as possible without being humiliated too much. Russia was anxious to avoid a war because the Great Military Programme was not to be completed until 1917, and Russia was otherwise not ready for war. Because all of France's leaders, including President Poincaré and René Viviani, were at sea on the battleship \"France\", returning from the summit in St. Petersburg, the acting head of the French government, Jean-Baptiste Bienvenu-Martin took no line on the ultimatum. In addition, the Germans jammed the radio messages, at least garbling contacts between the ship-borne French leaders and Paris, and possibly blocking them completely.\n\nOn 25 July, Grey suggested again that Germany inform Austria that the Serbian reply to the Austrian ultimatum was \"satisfactory\". Jagow passed on Grey's offer to Vienna without comment. The same day, Jagow told the reporter Theodor Wolff that in his opinion \"neither London, nor Paris, nor St. Petersburg wants a war\". On the same day, Russia announced that it could not remain \"uninterested\" if Austria attacked Serbia. Both the French and Russian ambassadors rejected four-power mediation, and instead proposed direct talks between Belgrade and Vienna. Jagow accepted the Franco-Russian offer as it offered the best chance to sever Britain from France and Russia. In his talks with Prince Lichnowsky, Grey drew a sharp distinction between an Austro-Serbian war, which did not concern Britain, and an Austro-Russian war, which did. Grey added that Britain was not working in concord with France and Russia, which heightened Jagow's hopes of severing Britain from the Triple Entente. On the same day, Jagow sent another message to Vienna to encourage the Austrians to hurry up with declaring war on Serbia.\n\nOn 26 July, Berchtold rejected Grey's mediation offer, and wrote that if a localization should not prove possible, then the Dual Monarchy was counting, \"with gratitude\", on Germany's support \"if a struggle against another adversary is forced on us\". That same day, General von Moltke sent a message to Belgium demanding that German troops be allowed to pass through that kingdom \"in the event of an imminent war against France and Russia\". Bethmann Hollweg in a message to the German Ambassadors in London, Paris and St. Petersburg stated that the principal aim of German foreign policy now was to make it appear that Russia had forced Germany into a war, in order to keep Britain neutral and ensure that German public opinion would back the war effort. Bethmann Hollweg advised Wilhelm to send Nicholas a telegram, which he assured the Emperor was for public relations purposes only. As Bethmann Hollweg put it, \"If war should come after all, such a telegram would make Russia's guilt glaringly plain\". Moltke visited the German Foreign Ministry to advise Jagow that Germany should start drafting an ultimatum to justify an invasion of Belgium. Later, Moltke met with Bethmann Hollweg, and told his wife later that same day that he had informed the Chancellor he was \"very dissatisfied\" that Germany had not yet attacked Russia.\n\nOn 26 July, in St. Petersburg, the German Ambassador von Pourtalès told Sazonov to reject Grey's offer of a summit in London, stating that the proposed conference was \"too unwieldy\", and if Russia were serious about saving the peace, they would negotiate directly with the Austrians. Sazonov replied that he was willing to see Serbia accept almost all of the Austrian demands, and following von Pourtalès's advice, rejected Grey's conference proposal in favour of direct talks with the Austrians. Von Pourtalès reported to Germany that Sazonov was being \"more conciliatory\", seeking \"to find a bridge ... to satisfy ... Austrian demands\" and willing to do almost anything to save the peace. At the same time, von Pourtalès warned that changes in the Balkan balance of power would be regarded as a highly unfriendly act by Russia. The following Austro-Russian talks were sabotaged by Austria's refusal to abandon any of the demands on Serbia As a preparatory move in case a war did break out, and Britain were to become involved, Winston Churchill, First Lord of the British Admiralty, ordered the British fleet not to disperse as planned, arguing that news of the British move might serve as a deterrent to war, and thus help persuade Germany to put pressure on Austria to abandon some of the more outrageous demands in their ultimatum. Grey stated that a compromise solution could be worked out if Germany and Britain were to work together. His approach generated opposition from British officials, who felt the Germans were dealing with the crisis in bad faith. Nicolson warned Grey that in his opinion \"Berlin is playing with us\". Grey for his part, rejected Nicolson's assessment, and believed that Germany was interested in stopping a general war.\n\nPhilippe Berthelot, the political director of the Quai d'Orsay, told Wilhelm von Schoen, the German Ambassador in Paris that \"to my simple mind Germany’s attitude was inexplicable if it did not aim at war\".\n\nIn Vienna, Conrad von Hötzendorf and Berchtold disagreed about when Austria should begin operations. Conrad wanted to wait until a military offensive was ready, which he estimated at 12 August, while Berchtold thought that the diplomatic window for a retaliatory strike would have passed by then.\n\nOn 27 July, Grey sent another peace proposal through Prince Lichnowsky asking for Germany to use its influence on Austria-Hungary to save the peace. Grey warned Lichnowsky that if Austria continued with its aggression against Serbia, and Germany with its policy of supporting Austria, then Britain would have no other choice but to side with France and Russia. The French Foreign Minister informed the German Ambassador in Paris, von Schoen, that France was anxious to find a peaceful solution, and was prepared to do his utmost with his influence in St. Petersburg if Germany should \"counsel moderation in Vienna, since Serbia had fulfilled nearly every point\".\n\nOn 26 July, after reading Serbia's reply, Wilhelm commented, \"\"But\" that eliminates any reason for war\" or \"\"every cause\" for war falls to the ground\". Wilhelm noted that Serbia had made \"a capitulation of the most humiliating kind\", that \"the few reservations [that] Serbia has made with respect to certain points can in my opinion surely be cleared up by negotiation\", and acting independently of Grey, made a similar \"Stop in Belgrade\" offer. Wilhelm stated that because \"the Serbs are Orientals, therefore liars, tricksters, and masters of evasion\", a temporary Austrian occupation of Belgrade was required until Serbia kept its word.\n\nWilhelm's sudden change of mind about war enraged Bethmann Hollweg, the military, and the diplomatic service, who proceeded to sabotage Wilhelm's offer. A German general wrote: \"unfortunately ... peaceful news. The Kaiser wants peace ... He even wants to influence Austria and to stop continuing further.\" Bethmann Hollweg sabotaged Wilhelm's proposal by instructing von Tschirschky to not restrain Austria. In passing on Wilhelm's message, Bethmann Hollweg excluded the parts wherein the Emperor told the Austrians not to go to war. Jagow told his diplomats to disregard Wilhelm's peace offer, and continue to press for war. General Falkenhayn told Wilhelm he \"no longer had control of the affair in his own hands\". Falkenhayn went on to imply that the military would stage a coup d'état, and depose Wilhelm in favour of the hawkish Crown Prince Wilhelm if he continued to work for peace.\n\nBethmann Hollweg mentioned two favourable conditions for war in his telegram to Vienna: that Russia be made to appear the aggressor forcing a reluctant Germany into war, and that Britain be kept neutral. The necessity of making Russia appear the aggressor was the greater concern to Bethmann-Hollweg because the German Social Democratic Party had denounced Austria for declaring war on Serbia and ordered street demonstrations to protest Germany's actions in supporting Austria. However, Bethmann Hollweg put great faith in the private promises he received from SPD leaders that they would support the government if Germany was faced with a Russian attack.\n\nOn 27 July, Wilhelm ended his cruise in the North Sea and returned to Germany. Wilhelm landed at Cuxhaven (Kiel) departing on 25 July at 6 p.m. despite the objections of his chancellor. The next afternoon, the order to disperse the British Fleet and dismiss British reservists was rescinded, putting the British Navy on a war footing.\n\nLater, on 27 July, Austria-Hungary started to complete the preparations for war. That same day, Jagow informed Szögyény that he was only pretending to take up the British offers of mediation in order to ensure British neutrality but had no intention of stopping the war. Szögyény reported \"in order to avoid a misunderstanding\" that Jagow had promised him that \"the German government assured Austria in the most binding fashion that it in no way identifies itself with the proposal [Grey's mediation offer], which may very shortly be brought to Your Excellency [Berchtold]'s notice by the German government: it is, on the contrary \"decidedly\" opposed to consideration of them and is only passing them on out of deference to the British request\" (emphasis in the original). Jagow went on to state he was \"absolutely against taking account of the British wish\", because \"the German government point of view was that it was at the moment of the highest importance to prevent Britain from making common cause with Russia and France. We must therefore avoid any action [that] might cut the line, which has so far worked so well, between Germany and Britain\". Szögyény ended his telegram: \"If Germany candidly told Grey that it refused to communicate England’s peace plan, that objective [ensuring British neutrality in the coming war] might not be achieved.\" Bethmann Hollweg, in a message to Prince Tschirschky, wrote on 27 July that Germany must appear to consider British mediation if they were not to be perceived as war-mongers. In passing on Grey's message, Bethmann Hollweg deleted the last line, which read: \"Also, the whole world here is convinced, and I hear from my colleagues that the key to the situation lies in Berlin, and that if Berlin seriously wants peace, it will prevent Vienna from following a foolhardy policy.\" In his reply to London, Bethmann Hollweg pretended that: \"We have immediately initiated mediation in Vienna in the sense desired by Sir Edward Grey.\" Jagow sent Grey's offer to Tschirschky, his ambassador in Vienna, but ordered him to not show it to any Austrian official in case they might accept it. At the same time, Bethmann Hollweg sent a distorted account of Grey's offer to Wilhelm.\n\nIn London, Grey told a meeting of the British Cabinet that they now had to decide whether to choose neutrality if war did come or to enter the conflict. While the Cabinet was still undecided about what course to choose, Churchill put the British fleet on alert. The Austrian Ambassador in Paris, Count Nikolaus Szécsen von Temerin, reported to Vienna: \"The far-reaching compliance of Serbia, which was not regarded as possible here, has made a strong impression. Our attitude gives rise to the opinion that we want war at any price.\" A Russian diplomat in London presciently criticized Grey for putting too much faith in Germany as a force for peace. The British were warned that \"War is inevitable and by the fault of England; that if England had at once declared her solidarity with Russia and France and her intention to fight if necessary, Germany and Austria would have hesitated.\" In Berlin, Admiral von Müller wrote in his diary that \"Germany should remain calm to allow Russia to put herself in the wrong but then not to shrink from war if it were inevitable\". Bethmann Hollweg told Wilhelm that \"In all events Russia must ruthlessly be put in the wrong\".\n\nOn 28 July at 11:49 a.m. Prince Lichnowsky sent the fourth British offer of mediation, this time from King George V as well as Grey. Lichnowsky wrote that the King desired that \"British-German joint participation, with the assistance of France and Italy, may be successful in mastering in the interest of peace the present extremely serious situation\". At 4:25 p.m. on 28 July, Lichnowsky reported to Berlin that \"since appearance of Austrian demands nobody here believes in possibility of localizing conflict\". The Permanent Secretary of the Foreign Office, Sir Arthur Nicolson, and the Private Secretary to Grey, Sir William Tyrrell, saw Grey's conference offer as \"the only possibility of avoiding a general war\" and hoped \"to get full satisfaction for Austria, as Serbia would be more apt to give in to the pressure of the Powers and to submit to their united will than to the threats of Austria\". Tyrrell relayed Grey's view that if Serbia were invaded, \"world war would be inevitable\". Lichnowsky in his dispatch to Berlin offered \"an urgent warning against believing any further in the possibility of localization [of the conflict]\". When Sir Edward Goschen, the British Ambassador in Berlin, presented Grey's conference proposal to Jagow, the Germans totally rejected the offer. In a letter to Grey, Bethmann Hollweg stated that Germany \"could not summon Austria before a European court of justice in her case with Serbia\". Austrian troops began to concentrate in Bosnia as a preparatory step towards invading Serbia. Falkenhayn told the German government, \"It has now been decided to fight the matter through, regardless of the cost\", and advised Bethmann Hollweg to order a German attack on Russia and France at once. Moltke supported Falkenhayn by submitting the assessment that 1914 was a \"singularly favourable situation\" for Germany to go to war as both Russia and France were not prepared whereas Germany was. Once the Russian Great Military Programme would be completed by 1917, Moltke stated that Germany would never be able to entertain the prospect of a victorious war again and so should destroy both France and Russia while it was still possible. Moltke ended his assessment with: \"We shall never hit it again so well as we do now.\" Jagow backed up Moltke by sending a message to Vienna telling the Austrians they must attack Serbia at once because otherwise the British peace plan might be accepted.\n\nAt 11:00 a.m. on 28 July, Austria declared war on Serbia. Following instructions from Bethmann Hollweg, von Tschirschky did not present Wilhelm's \"Stop in Belgrade\" proposal until noon. At 1:00 a.m. on 29 July 1914 the first shots of the First World War were fired by the Austrian monitor SMS \"Bodrog\", which bombarded Belgrade in response to Serbian sappers blowing up the railway bridge over the river Sava which linked the two countries. In Russia, partial mobilization was ordered for the four military districts bordering Austria-Hungary. Wilhelm sent a telegram to Nicholas asking for Russian support for the Austrian war against Serbia. Nicholas replied: \"Am glad you are back ... I appeal to you to help me. An ignoble war has been declared on a weak country ... Soon I shall be overwhelmed by pressure brought upon me ... to take extreme measures which will lead to war. To try and avoid such a calamity as a European war, I beg you in the name of our old friendship to do what you can to stop your allies from going too far.\"\n\nShortly after declaring war on Serbia, Conrad informed the Germans that Austria-Hungary could not start operations until 12 August, to much fury in Berlin. Bavarian diplomat Count Lerchenfeld reported to Munich: \"The Imperial government is thus put into the extraordinary difficult position of being exposed during the intervening period to the other Powers’ proposals for mediation and conferences, and if it continues to maintain its previous reserve towards such proposals, the odium of having provoked a world war will in the end recoil on it, even in the eyes of the German people. But a successful war on three fronts (viz, in Serbia, Russia and France) can not be initiated and carried on such a basis. It is imperative that the responsibility for any extension of the conflict to the Powers not directly concerned should under all circumstances fall on Russia alone.\" At the same time, the German Ambassador to Russia, Portalés, reported that, based on a conversation with Sazonov, Russia was prepared to make \"astonishing\" concessions by promising to pressure Serbia to agree to most of the Austrian demands to avoid a war. The prospect of talks was rejected out of hand by Bethmann Hollweg.\n\nThough as late as 27 July, Jagow expressed the view that Russian partial mobilization against the frontiers of Austria-Hungary was not a \"casus belli\", Moltke instead argued that Germany should mobilize at once and attack France. Moltke was overruled by Bethmann Hollweg in two meetings on 29 July, who argued that Germany should wait for Russia to begin a general mobilization. As Bethmann Hollweg told Moltke, this was the best way to ensure that blame for the \"whole shemozzle\" could be placed on Russia's door, and thus ensure British neutrality. While promising not to start mobilization without the Chancellor's orders, Moltke ordered the German military attaché in Belgium to ask for permission for German troops to cross through on the way to attack France. Also on July 28, Bethmann Hollweg offered to form an anti-Russian military alliance with Turkey.\nIn a meeting with the British Ambassador Goschen, Bethmann Hollweg made the flagrantly false statement that Germany was trying to pressure Austria to abandon the war against Serbia. As Prince Henry of Prussia pretended that King George V had promised him that Britain would remain neutral, the Kaiser rejected Bethmann Hollweg's offer of a naval agreement with Britain, stating that Germany did not have to offer Britain anything now that King George had apparently promised his country's neutrality.\n\nIn London, Churchill wrote to George V that the Royal Navy had been placed \"upon a preparatory precautionary basis\". Churchill went to write that \"it is needless to emphasize that these measures in no way prejudice an intervention or take for granted that the peace of the great powers will not be preserved\".\n\nOn 29 July, Wilhelm sent a telegram to Nicholas stating \"I think a direct understanding between your government and Vienna possible and desirable\". The Austrian General Staff sent a note to Jagow complaining about his statement that he did not regard a Russian partial mobilization as a threat to Germany, and asked that Germany mobilize to deter Russia from supporting Serbia. In response to the Austrian message, Jagow told a Russian diplomat that \"Germany was likewise obliged to mobilize [in response to Russian partial mobilization]; there was therefore nothing left to be done and the diplomatists must now leave the talking to the cannon.\"\n\nAt a meeting in Potsdam, according to Admiral Tirpitz's notes, Wilhelm \"expressed himself without reserve regarding Bethmann's incompetence\" in foreign affairs. Bethmann Hollweg suggested that Germany sign a naval agreement with Britain limiting the size of the High Seas Fleet to keep Britain out of the war. Admiral Tirpitz went on to record: \"The Kaiser informed the company that the Chancellor had proposed that in order to keep England neutral, we should sacrifice the German fleet for an agreement with England, which he, the Kaiser had refused.\"\n\nTo ensure acceptance of his peace plan, Grey proposed a \"Stop in Belgrade\" offer, in which Austria would occupy Belgrade and go no further. Since this was the same proposal as Wilhelm had made, Bethmann Hollweg regarded this as a particular threat as it would have made it difficult for Germany to reject it. Bethmann Hollweg asked that Austria at least make an effort to show some interest in the British peace plan. In an effort to sabotage Bethmann Hollweg's offer (which though not sincere was regarded as dangerous in case it might succeed), Moltke asked Vienna not to consider the British peace plan, and instead to order general mobilization and activate War Plan R, the Austrian war plan for a war against Russia.\n\nAt a meeting with Bethmann Hollweg late on 29 July, Falkenhayn and Moltke both again demanded that Germany use Russian partial mobilization as an excuse to go to war. Bethmann Hollweg again insisted that Germany must wait for Russian general mobilization as it was the only way of ensuring that the German public and that Britain would remain neutral in the \"imminent war\" against France and Russia. In order to \"make Russia appear the aggressor\", Moltke asked for Austrian mobilization against Russia so as to provide a \"casus foederis\" for Germany to mobilize likewise. In the same message, Moltke expressed hope that the British peace plan would fail, and announced his belief that the only way of saving Austria-Hungary as a power was through a general European war. In the evening, Moltke repeated his request, and promised again that \"Germany will mobilize\" against Russia, were Austria to do the same. Count Szogyeny reported to Vienna that the German government \"regarded the possibility of a European conflict with the most complete calm\", and that the Germans were only concerned about the possibility of Italy not honouring the Triple Alliance.\n\nIn a meeting in London, Grey warned Prince Lichnowsky in veiled terms that if Germany attacked France, then Britain would consider going to war with Germany. Grey repeated his \"Stop in Belgrade\" peace plan, and strongly urged that Germany accept it. Grey ended his meeting with the warning that \"unless Austria is willing to enter upon a discussion of the Serbian question a world war is inevitable\". To support Grey's warnings, the British government ordered a general alert for its armed forces. In Paris, Jean Jaurès, the leader of the French Socialist Party and an outspoken pacifist, was assassinated by a right-wing fanatic. In St. Petersburg, the French Ambassador Maurice Paléologue, upon learning belatedly on the night of 29/30 July of Russia's partial mobilization, protested against the Russian move.\n\nAt another meeting with Goschen late on the night of 29 July, Bethmann Hollweg stated that Germany would soon be going to war against France and Russia, and sought to ensure British neutrality by promising him that Germany would not annex parts of metropolitan France (Bethmann Hollweg refused to make any promises about French colonies). During the same meeting, Bethmann Hollweg all but announced that Germany would soon violate Belgium's neutrality, though Bethmann Hollweg said that, if Belgium did not resist, Germany would not annex that kingdom.\nThe Goschen-Bethmann Hollweg meeting did much to galvanize the British government into deciding to ally with France and Russia. Sir Eyre Crowe commented that Germany had \"made up her mind\" to go to war. Germany's policy was to reveal to Britain her war aims in hope that a statement might be reached that would ensure British neutrality. Instead, Bethmann Hollweg's move had the opposite effect, since it was now clear to London that Germany had no interest in peace.\n\nAfter Goschen left the meeting, Bethmann Hollweg received a message from Prince Lichnowsky saying that Grey was most anxious for a four power conference, but that if Germany attacked France, then Britain would have no other choice but to intervene in the war. In response to the British warning, Bethmann Hollweg suddenly changed course, writing to Prince Tschirschky that Austria should accept mediation. Five minutes later, Bethmann Hollweg asked Vienna in a second message to stop \"refusing any exchange of views with Russia\", and warned that they \"must refuse to allow Vienna to draw us into a world conflagration frivolously and without regard to our advice\". In another message, Bethmann Hollweg wrote \"To avert a general catastrophe or \"in any case\" to put Russia in the wrong, we must urgently wish Vienna to begin and continue conversations with Russia.\" As the historian Fritz Fischer noted, only when Bethmann Hollweg received a clear warning that Britain would intervene in a war did he begin to apply pressure on Austria for peace. Bethmann Hollweg's advice was rejected by Austria as being too late. Count Berchtold told the German Ambassador that he would need a few days to think about the German offer, and until then, events would proceed.\n\nAt the start of the July Crisis, Germany had given her full support to Austria. This stratagem had earlier served to keep Russia on the sidelines during the Annexationist Crisis of 1908, and may therefore have been thought to offer the best possible prospect of keeping the Austro-Serb dispute localized. On 28 July, Russia ordered partial mobilization in response to Austria's declaration of war on Serbia, Bethmann-Hollweg became alarmed and changed his attitude 180 degrees. Already on 28 July, two hours before becoming aware of the Austrian declaration of war, the Kaiser had suggested the \"Halt in Belgrade\" plan and instructed von Jagow that a cause for war no longer existed with the Serbian reply and he was ready to mediate with Serbia.\n\nAfter learning of the Austrian declaration of war on Serbia, Bethmann Hollweg sent off the Kaiser's 'pledge plan' to Vienna on the evening of 28 July, with instructions to Tschirschky (the German ambassador in Vienna) to express himself \"emphatically\" to Berchtold and to \"wire reply\". After waiting all day Wednesday (29 July) for a reply, Bethmann Hollweg sent off three more telegrams urgently demanding an \"immediate\" answer to his 'pledge plan' and the plan for \"direct conversations\" between Austria and Russia and added in severe disapproval of Austria.\n\nAfter receiving information from Rome that Serbia was now ready \"on condition of certain interpretations, to swallow even Articles 5 and 6, that is, the whole Austrian ultimatum\", Bethmann Hollweg forwarded this information to Vienna at 12:30 a.m., 30 July, adding that Serbia's response to the Austrian ultimatum were a \"suitable basis for negotiation.\" Berchtold replied that though the acceptance of the Austrian Note would have been satisfactory before hostilities had begun, \"now after a state of war has begun, Austria's conditions must naturally take another tone.\" In response, Bethmann Hollweg, now aware of the Russian order for partial mobilization, fired off several telegrams in the early morning hours of 30 July. He telegraphed Vienna at 2:55 a.m. and 3:00 a.m. urging that Austria-Hungary accept the Serbian terms in order to avoid drawing Germany into a general war. \n\nThese early-morning telegrams from Bethmann Hollweg were given by Tschirschky to Berchtold while the two men lunched on Thursday, 30 July. Tschirschky reported to Berlin that Berchtold was \"pale and silent\" as the Bethmann telegrams were read twice, before stating that he would take the matter to the Emperor. After Berchtold had departed for his audience with Emperor Franz Joseph on the afternoon of Thursday, 30 July, Berchtold's advisors Forgach and Hoyos informed Bethmann Hollweg that he should not expect a reply until the following morning (Friday, 31 July), as Tisza, who would not be in Vienna until then, must be consulted. Bethmann spent the remainder of the day, 30 July, continuing to impress Vienna with the need for negotiations and to inform the Powers of his mediation efforts.\n\nOn 30 July, Nicholas sent a message to Wilhelm informing him that he had ordered partial mobilization against Austria, and asking him to do his utmost for a peaceful solution. Upon hearing of Russia's partial mobilization, Wilhelm wrote: \"Then I must mobilize too.\" The German Ambassador in St. Petersburg informed Nicholas that Germany would mobilize if Russia did not cease all military preparations at once, including those it had previously assured Russia it did not see as a threat against Germany or cause for German mobilization. The German military attaché in Russia reported that the Russians appeared to be acting out of fear but \"without aggressive intentions\". At the same time, Nicholas's order for a partial mobilization met with protests from both Sazonov and the Russian War Minister General Vladimir Sukhomlinov, who insisted partial mobilization was not technically possible, and that, given Germany's attitude, a general mobilization was required. Nicholas at first ordered a general mobilization, and then after receiving an appeal for peace from Wilhelm cancelled it as a sign of his good faith. The cancellation of general mobilization led to furious protests from Sukhomlinov, Sazonov, and Russia's top generals, all urging Nicholas to reinstate it. Under strong pressure, Nicholas gave in and ordered a general mobilization on 30 July.\n\nChristopher Clark states: \"The Russian general mobilisation was one of the most momentous decisions of the July crisis. This was the first of the general mobilisations. It came at the moment when the German government had not yet even declared the State of Impending War, the last stage of preparedness before mobilization.\"\n\nRussia did this:\n\nNicholas wanted neither to abandon Serbia to the ultimatum of Austria-Hungary, nor to provoke a general war. In a series of letters exchanged with Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany (the so-called \"Willy and Nicky correspondence\") the two proclaimed their desire for peace, and each attempted to get the other to back down. Nicholas desired that Russia's mobilization be only against the Austrian border, in the hopes of preventing war with the German Empire. However, his army had no contingency plans for a partial mobilization, and on 31 July 1914 Nicholas took the fateful step of confirming the order for general mobilization, despite being strongly counseled against it.\n\nIn the evening of Thursday, July 30, with Berlin's strenuous efforts to persuade Vienna to some form of negotiation, and with Bethmann Hollweg still awaiting a response from Berchtold, Russia gave the order for full mobilization. When the German Emperor learned that, were Germany to attack France and Russia, Britain would in all likelihood not remain neutral, he launched a vehement rant, denouncing Britain as \"that filthy nation of grocers.\" That same day, the anti-Russian German-Turkish alliance was signed. Moltke passed on a message to Conrad asking for general mobilization as a prelude to a war against Russia.\n\nAt 9:00 p.m. on July 30, Bethmann Hollweg gave in to Moltke and Falkenhayn's repeated demands and promised them that Germany would issue a proclamation of \"imminent danger of war\" at noon the next day regardless of whether Russia began a general mobilization or not. Bethmann Hollweg was overjoyed upon learning of Russian general mobilization at 9:00 am on July 31, as it allowed him to present the war as something forced on Germany by Russia.\n\nAt a meeting of the Prussian State Council held on July 30, Bethmann Hollweg noted Russian mobilization was not a source of worry for Germany: Bethmann Hollweg stated that his only interest now was, for domestic political reasons, to \"\"represent\" Russia as the guilty party\" behind the war. In the same meeting, the Chancellor stated that if it appeared to public opinion that Russian mobilization had forced Germany into a war, then there was \"nothing to fear\" from the Social Democrats. Bethmann Hollweg added, \"There will be no question of a general or partial strike or of sabotage.\"\n\nLater that day, Bethmann Hollweg sent a message to the German ambassador to Vienna increasing pressure to accept the halt-in-Belgrade proposal. Bethmann Hollweg could not go to war in support of Austrian intransigence under such circumstances. But shortly afterwards, \"as soon as news of Russia's general mobilization began to arrive in Berlin\" the Chancellor instructed the ambassador in Vienna \"that all mediation attempts be stopped\", and the directive be suspended. Fritz Fischer and some other scholars have maintained the alternative view that Prince Henry's assurances that King George had promised him that Britain would remain neutral accounted for the change. Fischer notes the telegram reporting these \"vague\" assurances arrived 12 minutes before the dispatch of the suspending telegram and that Bethmann Hollweg himself justified the cancellation that way, while acknowledging that before then Bethmann Hollweg had already prepared, but not yet sent, a telegram to Vienna explaining that he had \"cancelled execution of instructions in No. 200, because the General Staff has just informed me that military measures of our neighbors, especially in the east, compel speedy decision if we are not to be taken by surprise\".\n\nUpon arriving back in France, the French Premier René Viviani sent a message to St. Petersburg asking that Russia not take any action that would offer Germany an excuse to mobilize. French troops were ordered to pull back from the German frontier as a sign of France's peaceful intentions. British Prime Minister Asquith wrote to Stanley noting the deteriorating situation.\n\nOn 31 July, the Austrian Crown Council decided to continue the war against Serbia, and to ignore the dangers of Russian mobilization in the expectation of German support. Nicholas wrote to Wilhelm to promise him that Russian general mobilization was not aimed as a prelude to war.\n\nThe German Ambassador in Paris delivered an ultimatum to Premier Viviani telling him that if Russia did not stop its mobilization, then Germany would attack France. Viviani, newly arrived back in France, knew nothing of a Russian general mobilization, and asked his ambassador in St. Petersburg for information. General Joseph Joffre of the French Army asked for permission to order a general mobilization. His request was refused.\n\nWhen the word reached Berlin of Russian general mobilization, Wilhelm agreed to sign the orders for German mobilization, and German troops began preparations to enter Luxembourg and Belgium as a preliminary towards invading France. As the historian Fritz Fischer noted, Bethmann Hollweg's gamble in waiting for Russian mobilization had paid off, and the Social Democrats rallied to support the government. The Bavarian military attaché reported celebration in the halls of the War Ministry at word of the Russian mobilization. Under the Schlieffen Plan, for Germany to mobilize was to mean war because as part of the plan, German troops as they were called up were to invade Belgium automatically. Unlike the war plans of the other powers, for Germany to mobilize was to go to war. Both Moltke and Falkenhayn told the government that Germany should declare war even were Russia to offer to negotiate.\n\nAsquith wrote to Stanley in London that \"the general opinion at present—particularly strong in the City—is to keep out at all costs\". The British Cabinet was badly divided with many ministers strongly opposed to Britain becoming involved in a war; a key figure was David Lloyd George, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who initially favoured keeping Britain's options open, then appeared likely to resign at the start of August, only in the end to remain in post as he regarded the German aggression against Belgium as sufficient \"casus belli\". The Conservatives promised the government if the anti-war Liberal ministers were to resign, they would enter the government to support going to war. F. E. Smith told Churchill that the Conservatives would support a war against Germany were France attacked.\nOn 31 July, Kaiser Wilhelm II wrote that the Triple Entente had conspired to entrap Germany in its treaty obligations with Austria \"as a pretext for waging a war of annihilation against us\".\n\nOn 1 August 1914, a British offer to guarantee French neutrality was sent out and promptly accepted by Wilhelm. At 4:23 p.m. a telegram from the German Ambassador to Britain arrived with a planned British proposal to guarantee the neutrality of France and thus limit the war to one fought in the east. Wilhelm then ordered German forces to strike against Russia alone, leading to fierce protests from Moltke that it was not technically possible for Germany to do so as the bulk of the German forces were already advancing into Luxembourg and Belgium. Wilhelm immediately accepted the proposal by telegrams at the ambassadorial and royal levels.\" In keeping with this decision, Wilhelm II demanded his generals shift the mobilization to the east. Moltke, German Chief of General Staff, told him that this was impossible, to which the Kaiser replied \"Your uncle would have given me a different answer!\" Instead, it was decided to mobilize as planned and cancel the planned invasion of Luxembourg. Once mobilization was complete, the army would redeploy to the east. In response to Wilhelm's order, a dejected Moltke complained that \"Now, it only remains for Russia to back out, too.\" Moltke then proceeded to persuade the Emperor to continue the advance for \"technical reasons\".\n\nIn Berlin, Bethmann Hollweg announced that Germany had mobilized and delivered an ultimatum to France telling that country to renounce its alliance with Russia or face a German attack. In response to reports of German troops invading Luxembourg and Belgium plus the German ultimatum, French mobilization was authorized on August 1; that same afternoon, Wilhelm signed the mobilization orders. Bethmann Hollweg was angry with Moltke for having had Wilhelm sign the orders without informing him first. By 7:00 pm on 1 August, German troops invaded Luxembourg.\n\nAt the same time as the invasion of Luxembourg, on August 1, 1914 Germany declared war on Russia. When presenting his declaration of war, the German Ambassador accidentally gave the Russians both copies of the declaration of war, one which claimed that Russia refused to reply to Germany and the other that said Russia's replies were unacceptable. Grey warned Lichnowsky that if Germany invaded Belgium, Britain would go to war.\n\nIn the morning of 2 August, while French troops were still at a distance from the German frontier, German troops took control of Luxembourg as a preliminary to the invasion of Belgium and France.\n\nOn 2 August, the British government promised that the Royal Navy would protect France's coast from German attack. The British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey gave Britain's firm assurance of protecting France with its navy to French Ambassador Paul Cambon. Cambon's account stated: \"I felt the battle was won. Everything was settled. In truth a great country does not wage war by halves. Once it decided to fight the war at sea it would necessarily be led into fighting it on land as well.\" Within the British Cabinet, the widespread feeling that Germany would soon violate Belgium's neutrality and destroy France as a power led to the increasing acceptance that Britain would be forced to intervene.\n\nA German ultimatum was delivered, this time to Belgium on 2 August, requesting free passage for the German army on the way to France. King Albert of Belgium refused the German request to violate his country's neutrality. On 3 August, Germany declared war on France, and on Belgium on 4 August. This act violated Belgian neutrality, the status to which Germany, France, and Britain were all committed by treaty; German violation of Belgian neutrality provided the \"casus belli\" for Britain's declaration of war.\n\nLater on 4 August, Bethmann Hollweg told the Reichstag that the German invasions of Belgium and Luxembourg were in violation of international law, but argued that Germany was \"in a state of necessity, and necessity knows no law\".\n\nAt 7 p.m. on 4 August, British Ambassador Sir Edward Goschen delivered Britain's ultimatum to German Secretary of State to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Gottlieb von Jagow), demanding a commitment by midnight that evening (within five hours) to go no further with Germany's violation of Belgian neutrality. Jagow rejected the British ultimatum and Goschen demanded his passports and requested a private and personal meeting with Bethmann Hollweg, who invited Goschen to dine with him. During their highly emotional conversation Bethmann Hollweg, who had spent his career trying to improve relations, accused Britain of going to war for its own national agenda, which was unrelated to that of Belgium, who would have been compensated for the wrong done to it. He quoted Grey's speech as evidence that Britain was not going to war for Belgium's sake. According to Goschen's report to Grey, Bethmann Hollweg said the Treaty of London, 1839, was for Britain (not for Germany), an excuse i.e. a \"scrap of paper\" and, compared to the \"fearful fact of Anglo-German war\", the steps taken by His Majesty's Government were terrible to a degree; just for a word – \"neutrality\", a word which in war time had so often been disregarded – just for a scrap of paper Great Britain was going to make war on a kindred nation who desired nothing better than to be friends with it. \n\nGoschen's telegrams on 4 August to Grey never reached London, so it was unclear whether a state of war existed between Britain and Germany until the expiry of the ultimatum at midnight, Berlin time. On August 4th 1914, Great Britain declared war on Germany. The British government expected a limited conflict of rapid movement on the battlefield like the Franco-Prussian War, in which Britain would primarily use its great naval strength. Goschen's account of the \"scrap of paper\" conversation dated August 6 was later edited and published by the British Government and outraged public opinion in Britain and the United States.\n\nAt the outbreak of the war, Wilhelm is reported to have said: \"To think that George and Nicky should have played me false! If my grandmother had been alive, she would never have allowed it.\"\n\nBritain's reasons for declaring war were complex. After the war began the propaganda reason given was that Britain was required to safeguard Belgium's neutrality under the Treaty of London 1839. The German invasion of Belgium was, therefore, the \"casus belli\" and, importantly, legitimized and galvanized popular support for the war among the antiwar Liberal Party constituency. However, the Treaty of London of 1839 had not committed Britain on her own to safeguard Belgium's neutrality. \n\nRather Britain's support for France was decisive. Edward Grey argued that the naval agreements with France (although they had not been approved by the Cabinet) created a moral obligation vis a vis Britain and France. British Foreign office mandarin Eyre Crowe stated: \"Should the war come, and England stand aside, one of two things must happen. (a) Either Germany and Austria win, crush France and humiliate Russia. What will be the position of a friendless England? (b) Or France and Russia win. What would be their attitude towards England? What about India and the Mediterranean?\" \nIn the event that Britain abandoned its Entente friends, Britain feared that if Germany won the war, or the Entente won without British support, then, either way, it would be left without any friends. This would have left both Britain and her Empire vulnerable to attack. \n\nDomestically, the Liberal Cabinet was split and in the event that war was not declared the Government would fall as Prime Minister Asquith, Edward Grey and Winston Churchill made it clear they would resign. In that event, the existing Liberal government would lose control of Parliament and the pro-war Conservatives would come to power. The Liberal Party might never recover–as indeed happened in 1916.\n\nOn August 6, the Emperor Franz Joseph signed the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Russia.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2117656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117656", "title": "Blizzard (comics)", "text": "Blizzard (comics)\n\nBlizzard is the name of different fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually depicted as a member of Iron Man's rogues gallery.\n\nDonnie Gill was portrayed by Dylan Minnette, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe TV series \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" in the first and second seasons.\n\nCreated by Stan Lee and Don Heck, the Gregor Shapanka version of Blizzard appeared as Jack Frost in \"Tales of Suspense\" #45 (September 1963), and as Blizzard beginning in \"Iron Man\" #86 (May 1976). He was killed off in \"The Amazing Spider-Man Annual\" #20 (November 1986).\n\nThe Donnie Gill Blizzard first appeared in \"Iron Man\" #223 (October 1987) and was created by David Michelinie and Bob Layton.\n\nThe Randy Macklin version of Blizzard first appeared in the \"Marvel Holiday Special\" #2 (January 1993) and was created by Sholly Fisch and Tom Morgan.\n\nGregor Shapanka is a Hungarian scientist obsessed with immortality, and decides that the study of cryonics is the first step towards his goal. Shapanka takes a job at Stark Industries to fund his research and attempts to steal directly from Tony Stark. After being caught and fired by Tony Stark for trying to steal from Tony Stark's secret vault, Gregor creates a suit containing cold-generating devices and is dubbed by the papers as \"Jack Frost.\" He attempts to raid Stark Industries where he captures Pepper Potts and Happy Hogan, but is defeated by Iron Man.\n\nSeveral years later, Gregor Shapanka escaped prison and attacked Stark's Long Island industrial complex using a new far more powerful cold-generating battle-suit and calling himself the Blizzard. This time, Blizzard was out to steal Stark's climatron device which could be used to alter weather patterns. Blizzard nearly froze Iron Man to death, but Iron Man was rescued by Potts. Iron Man caused Blizzard's battle-suit to short-circuit and then captured him.\n\nGregor Shapanka obtained financing for recreating his cold-generating costume from multimillionaire Justin Hammer. Blizzard formed a partnership with two other clients of Hammer known as Blacklash and Melter. Together, the three criminals attacked a hotel casino in Atlantic City, only to be defeated by Iron Man and private bodyguard Bethany Cabe.\n\nShortly thereafter, Shapanka reconstructs his cold suit in prison. When Electro uses his electrical powers to break out of the adjoining cell Shapanka is caught in the blast and the suit is fused to his body. Electro and the Blizzard then join forces to take over the \"Daily Bugle\", but are stopped by Spider-Man and Daredevil.\n\nSome months later during the \"Demon in a Bottle\" storyline, Justin Hammer hires the Blizzard to join an army of supervillains and battle Iron Man.\n\nBlizzard's body somehow gained the ability to generate intense cold without artificial means. Feeling alienated from humanity, Shapanka (again calling himself Jack Frost) went to live in an ice palace he created within a mountain. Hulk found Jack Frost's new home and destroyed the ice palace. Jack Frost was seemingly killed in the collapse of his ice domain.\n\nGregor Shapanka reappeared in the guise of the Blizzard. Somehow, Blizard had lost his bodily power to generate cold and once again needed his battlesuit to create low temperatures. Shapanka returned to crime and formed a gang to aid him. However, upon robbing a bank in New York City, Blizzard and his henchmen were found and defeated by Spider-Man and were taken into police custody. Thanks to his lawyer, Blizzard was soon back at large and kidnapped Bobby Saunders (a boy whom he saw speaking with Spider-Man). Through Saunders, Blizzard intended to get revenge for his most recent defeat. Blizzard mistakes a villainous version of Iron Man from the year 2020 for the modern Iron Man and attempts to ambush him. The future Iron Man however is on an urgent mission to find Bobby Saunders (who would grow up to be a terrorist in 2020) and instantly kills the Blizzard with a repulsor blast.\n\nBorn in Delaware, Donald \"Donnie\" Gill was a professional criminal hired by Justin Hammer (who gave him a cryogenic suit resembling the original Blizzard's suit). Since Blizzard was vaporized by Iron Man 2020, Donnie adopted the name. His first mission involved working with Beetle and Blacklash to capture Force, who had betrayed Hammer. However, Blizzard was clumsy and annoyed his teammates with his amateurish mistakes (such as creating an ice wall blocking the path to their objective). After encasing Blacklash in ice, the trio fled as reinforcements arrived to protect Force.\n\nThe trio again tried to capture Force, who was protected by Iron Man. Although Blizzard fought better, when Force entered the fight he neutralized the villains' powers. Blizzard, Beetle, and Blacklash split up, fled and rested until their powers returned. Force found Blizzard, whose powers were ineffective against him so Blizzard fought him with bare hands. Force repelled him, blasting him through a wall. Blizzard doggedly tried to blast Force again (despite warnings), and was electrocuted. The Beetle and Blacklash abandoned Blizzard; Chemistro blamed them for their failures, and they were arrested.\n\nBefore Blizzard could be jailed, he was rescued by Rhino for Hammer. His loyalty to Hammer increased, although Iron Man tried to mentor him. Hammer negotiated with Iron Man for Blizzard, forcing the latter to help him take down the Ghost. Iron Man agreed, but Blizzard refused to believe that Hammer betrayed him. After hearing a recording, Blizzard was crushed; he surrendered to Iron Man, and was saved by Chemistro and Melter.\n\nAfter solo missions against the Avengers and the New Warriors, attending the AIM Weapons Expo with several other super-villains and joining the largest group of the Masters of Evil, Blizzard worked with a smaller team (including villains Constrictor, Crossfire and daughters of Tarantula and Batroc the Leaper). Their mission failed after interference from Agent X and his allies.\n\nBlizzard attacked She-Hulk in a bar; instead of defeating him, she invited him for a drink. Drunk, he contemplated his lack of recognition. Before collapsing in a stupor, Blizzard noted that he liked She-Hulk. After reverting to her Jennifer Walters persona she collapsed, vomiting, on top of him.\n\nWith the Avengers disbanded, the Beetle (now known as Mach-IV) decided to form a new group of Thunderbolts. Like the original Thunderbolts, they were former villains seeking redemption for their crimes as superheroes. Gill was one of the first members invited to join by Mach-IV, and he agreed. However, he lacked confidence despite his desire to help people. As a Thunderbolt, Blizzard fought several enemies, including Fathom Five, the Wrecking Crew and the Purple Man.\n\nBlizzard and fellow Thunderbolt Speed Demon became close friends. When Speed Demon tried to commit crimes with the Shocker, Blizzard convinced him to use his former Whizzer outfit and a tracking device. Angry with Blizzard, Speed Demon tied him upside-down and naked on a bridge. Although doubting his status as a superhero and feeling hopeless, Blizzard gained strength from the others (especially Songbird, who insulted him and dismissed him from the group when she became its leader).\n\nBaron Zemo, forming a group to fight Songbird's Thunderbolts, recruited Blizzard (who spent his days in bars after his firing by Songbird). His new teammate, the Fixer, enhanced Blizzard's abilities. He battled the Thunderbolts; the groups were soon assimilated, and Blizzard helped them against the U-Foes during Civil War. Against Overmind, Blizzard proved himself to his teammates by shielding them (and Songbird).\n\nIn the final battle against the Grandmaster, Blizzard's suit was destroyed after the Wellspring energy was released and he was pardoned for his past crimes. Blizzard later appeared as an inmate at the Raft.\n\nBlizzard later aligns himself with Iron Man, Zeke Stane, Whirlwind, and Living Laser against the Mandarin but is defeated by the Mandarin's forces.\n\nDuring the \"Infinity\" storyline, Blizzard was seen with Whirlwind robbing banks when they are approached by Spymaster. Blizzard and Whirlwind are recruited by Spymaster to join him and his villain allies (consisting of Constrictor, Firebrand IV, Titanium Man, Unicorn, and Whiplash IV) in a plot to attack the almost-defenseless Stark Tower. During the briefing, Blizzard suddenly collapses. When Blizzard regains consciousness, he discovers that his skin has turned white. Blizzard had been exposed to the Terrigen Mists unleashed upon the face of the entire Earth by Black Bolt. Being unknowingly an Inhuman descendant, Blizzard experienced Terrigenesis which causes the manifestation of his latent powers. Blizzard thought that this was his opportunity to \"be part of something bigger\" and decided to leave Spymaster's team. However, he and Whirlwind were brutally attacked by Spymaster and Titanium Man when they tried to leave. Blizzard and Whirlwind were forced into taking part of the assault to Stark Tower. After Spymaster used teleporter discs to teleport some Iron Man Armors to the buyers, he escaped and left Blizzard and the rest of his accomplices to be discovered by the heroes which were using the tower as a base. They managed to defeat the heroes, and they were offered to be taken to Spymaster by Titanium Man. When they arrived to a spaceship where Spymaster was, they were ambushed by him and Titanium Man who revealed himself as Captain Atlas of the Kree (who were the masterminds behind the heist). Blizzard and the other villains managed to escape custody and started fighting Spymaster, Titanium Man and the army of Iron Men (controlled by Spymaster). The actual Iron Man arrived to the spaceship, after having tracked down the armors, and helped Blizzard and his allies defeat the enemies. During the fight, Blizzard used the powers he discovered of being like a human battery to overcharge the armors and deactivate them, but he fainted and fell off the spaceship's cargo door. A suit Iron Man was controlling rescued him, but in order to let his friends escape, Blizzard froze himself and the suit. Blizzard was taken to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and was left under the simulation he had been delivered to the Inhumans in order to prove himself as the changed man Blizzard thought he was...until S.H.I.E.L.D. could know what to do with him.\n\nAt the time when Donnie Gill was unavailable, Justin Hammer had a man named Mickey Quaid become a substitute Blizzard in order to assist Afterburner, Beetle, Blacklash, Boomerang, and Spymaster in fighting Silver Sable and the Wild Pack.\n\nRandall \"Randy\" Macklin, an ex-criminal, fails to find work following his release from prison and uses a spare Blizzard costume he was safeguarding for his friend Donnie Gill. Macklin, however, is quickly defeated by Iron Man, who offers him a legitimate job at Stark Enterprises.\nA man named Jim became the fourth Blizzard upon being granted cryokinesis by Mandarin and Zeke Stane as part of their plans to revamp and upgrade the different enemies of Iron Man. His first mission is to freeze desalinization plants in Abu Dhabi where it would leave the country with no water. It was revealed that Mandarin had a bomb placed in Jim's neck to ensure his compliance.\n\nWhen Iron Man tries to persuade his enemies to turn against Mandarin, Blizzard heeded the calls as Iron Man deactivated the bombs on them Blizzard aligns himself with Iron Man, Zeke Stane, Whirlwind, and Living Laser against Mandarin and his Titanomechs. During the battle, Blizzard is impaled by a Titanomech.\n\nAll the Blizzards have similar powers, derived from their costumes. Micro-circuited cryogenic units make it possible to emit freezing rays, which lower the temperature of the surrounding air (or objects) and release ice as a projectile.\n\nDonnie Gill's costume is upgraded by supervillains Beetle and Fixer. This enables even greater manipulation of cold where Gill can encase people in snow and ice, create an ice barricade or generate \"ice sleds\" for transport. Following his Terrigenesis, Blizzard also developed electricity manipulation where he can manipulate electrical currents and charge the energies in his body.\n\nIn the \"Earth-X\" reality, the Donnie Gill version of Blizzard has the same history. He was killed by Norman Osborn prior to the Green Goblin's rise to power.\n\nIn the \"House of M\" reality, the Donnie Gill version of Blizzard appears as a member of Hood's Masters of Evil.\n\nThe Donnie Gill version of Blizzard appears in \"Iron Man & Power Pack\" issue #2 with Speed Demon. He kidnaps Irena Crumb (daughter of millionaire Arnold Crumb, and a school rival of Julie Power's) from her school and takes her to an abandoned warehouse across town, where he tortures her. Speed Demon runs in, telling him that Power Pack has found them; Power Pack bursts in, and a fight ensues. At one point, Blizzard freezes the ground, causing Speed Demon to slip and smash into him. The Pack captures Blizzard, and Lightspeed takes his mask so she can rescue Irena from Speed Demon incognito. Afterwards, Blizzard and Speed Demon are arrested.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "2117675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117675", "title": "The First Sex", "text": "The First Sex\n\nThe First Sex is a 1971 book by the American librarian Elizabeth Gould Davis, considered part of the second wave of feminism. In the book, Gould Davis aimed to show that early human society consisted of matriarchal \"queendoms\" based around worship of the \"Great Goddess\", and characterised by pacifism and democracy. Gould Davis argued that the early matriarchal societies attained a high level of civilization, which was largely wiped out as a result of the \"patriarchal revolution\". She asserted that patriarchy introduced a new system of society, based on property rights rather than human rights, and worshipping a stern and vengeful male deity instead of the caring and nurturing Mother Goddess.\n\nThese views of Gould Davis on a Great Goddess predominating in Neolithic Europe and the Near East are similar to those made by a number of writers in the early and mid 20th-century, including Eric Neumann, Thorstein Veblen, Merlin Stone, Robert Graves, Marija Gimbutas, J. J. Bachofen, Walter Burket, James Mellart, Robert Briffault.\n\nAlthough many of her views are considered unsupported by most anthropologists and archaeologists today, a number of writers have continued to develop the themes that Gould Davis originated.\n\nIn the first part of \"The First Sex\", Gould Davis used evidence from archaeology and anthropology to support a theory of matriarchal prehistory. The chapters in this section of the book focus on individual parts of the evidence for peaceful matriarchal queendoms: three are titled \"Mythology Speaks\", \"Anthropology Speaks\" and \"Archaeology Speaks\". Gould Davis said that the \"loss of paradise\" when the \"Great Goddess\" was replaced by a vengeful male deity is the theme of all surviving myth. She argued that evidence from the Neolithic site at Çatal Hüyük showed there to be no wars or even violent death, and that even physical injury to animals may not have been permissible there. She pointed to other parts of the Mediterranean in which female tombs are preserved more carefully than male ones, and took this to be evidence of female primacy. In \"Anthropology Speaks\", Gould Davis focused on taboos, chiefly incest, and aimed to show how taboos against brother-sister relationships acted to protect women against violent men. She also argued that menstrual blood was originally sacred rather than polluting or \"unclean\", and that only when people began to eat meat did men become bigger than women, because of selection of weak women by men.\n\nIn this section of the book, Gould Davis examined how mythology and society changed as a result of a suggested violent conversion from matriarchy to patriarchy. Her theory proposed that patriarchal revolution resulted from the violent invasion of nomadic tribes who were warlike and destructive, overrunning the peaceful, egalitarian matriarchies. These nomads (Semites from the Arabian Peninsula) are argued to have never achieved a civilization of their own, but only to have destroyed or taken over older ones. Gould Davis asserted that many tales in the Old Testament were actually rewritings of older stories, with goddesses changed to male actors, or a goddess raped or overthrown and her powers usurped by the new father deity. This, she suggested, was part of a concerted effort to wipe out all evidence of female authority. Because the violent invaders wished to establish the a patrilineal system of inheritance, rigorous control of women's sexuality became paramount. Thus women's right to sexual pleasure was redefined as sinful, and virginity was conceived of as a property right of a woman's father or husband. Gould Davis discussed female circumcision as a means to protect the virginity of women and assure clear lines of paternity. This practice is described in the book in graphic detail, as performed with unsterilized instruments, without anaesthesia (conditions pertaining to all surgical practices before the nineteenth century).\n\nIn this part of the book, Gould Davis focused on the role of women in the ancient civilizations of Crete and Mycenae. Her research suggested to her that, as in her model of prehistoric civilization, women were the primary powers. The book saw the Cretan and Mycenaean civilizations as remnants of the ancient pre-Christian Celtic culture, which Gould Davis also believed to have granted women a great deal of power. She claimed, for example, that the monarchy was matrilineal, and that most of the tribal chiefs were women rather than men.\n\nGould Davis claimed that Greek women possessed rights that are presently denied by the Catholic, Orthodox, and conservative Protestant churches, such as the rights to abortion and divorce. She cited many well-known historians to support these claims. She also argued that women participated in almost all aspects of ancient Greek and Roman society, including government, learning and sport. In the following chapter, \"The Celts\", she argued that similar rights prevailed until the collapse of the Roman Empire, for a matrilineal system of monarchical descent, and for Celtic women being the major preservers of learning during the early Middle Ages.\n\nThe final part of \"The First Sex\" focused on the period since Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire in 313 A.D. Gould Davis aimed with this part of the book to show how Semitic myths of male supremacy were preached by the early Church Fathers to a Pagan people who would not believe them and did not take them seriously until Constantine became emperor. Gould Davis believed that the writings of Paul in the New Testament were used by the Church to justify violence against women, leading throughout the Middle Ages to a level of cruelty and barbarity unheard of in previous ages. Gould Davis believed that once Christianity had attained civil power, the demotion of women and the \"terrible materialism that marks and mars our present civilization\" were inevitable. She argued that the influence of Mary as a \"Goddess\" grew as the violent imposition of Christianity erased the ancient Goddess religion. Quoting Jules Michelet, Gould Davis argued that women by the fifteenth century were treated so badly by men of all social classes that they were seen as \"worse than beasts\". The Church, she said, approved of this domestic violence, and brutality to women extended beyond families to the priesthood, who cited the Bible to justify themselves.\n\nIn Gould Davis's view, the status of women was only improved briefly by the Reformation and a flowering of learned women during the sixteenth century. Afterward, Puritanism's witch-hunts and a strengthened papacy placed women back in the same level of submission, and women were tortured and studied in the most prurient manner for \"witch marks\". Millions of people, she said, most of whom were women, died by burning, drowning, hanging, or from torture during the Catholic and Protestant Inquisitions. In Gould Davis's view, the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries marked the first time Western women accepted their own inferiority, and before Mary Wollstonecraft nobody spoke up for them. Gould Davis made a special effort to show how the \"minds\" of women were subjugated during the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries.\n\nIn the last part of \"The First Sex\", Gould Davis attempted to show the beliefs used to subordinate women to be myths, contending that in reality women are \"stronger\", and physically, mentally, and morally more than equal to men; and that the survival of humanity depends on the restoration of women to their former position as rulers of society. Gould Davis argued that patriarchal civilization is destroying itself, and that only the values of the \"matriarchates\" can save humanity, because a society based on the mechanistic, Cartesian duality of dominant and violent males leads inevitably to a focus on technology and gadgetry rather than on loving human relationships.\n\nGould Davis called for \"the matriarchal counterrevolution that is the only hope for the survival of the human race\" and opined that \"spiritual force\", \"[m]ental and spiritual gifts\", and \"[e]xtrasensory perception\" will be more important than \"physical force\", \"gifts of a physical nature\", and \"sensory perception\", respectively, so that \"woman will again predominate\" and that \"the next civilization will ... revolve [\"about\"] [\"divine woman\"]\", as it had in the past that she asserted.\n\nAccording to critic Prof. Ginette Castro, Gould Davis proposed a discourse \"rooted in the purest female chauvinism\" and seemed to support \"a feminist counterattack stigmatizing the patriarchal present\", \"giv[ing] ... in to a revenge-seeking form of feminism\", \"build[ing] ... her case on the humiliation of men\", and \"asserti[ng] ... a specifically feminine nature ... [as] morally superior.\" Castro criticized the essentialism and the assertion of superiority as \"sexist\" and \"treason\".\n\nSince its publication, there has been criticism of \"The First Sex\". In \"Goddess Unmasked\", Phillip Davis argued that the assertions by Gould Davis and Marija Gimbutas are severely distorted at best, that serious study of artifacts in Europe and Anatolia does not support the idea of a peaceful matriarchy, and that there is no evidence for a female monotheism of the type advocated by Gould Davis. Similarly, in her 2000 book \"The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory\", Cynthia Eller attempted to show that, not only is Gould Davis's theory of prehistoric matriarchal queendoms unsupported by archaeological evidence, but even if it were true, it would not give women any more hope for a just and equal future, simply because replicating the ancient past in today's world is not feasible. She did, however, accept the notion that some Neolithic and Bronze-Age societies centered around female deities: “Certainly we are aware of numerous cross-cultural instances of goddess worship accompanied by widespread use of … [female] figurines, so this is one of the most likely explanations of the Neolithic figurine assemblages.” Continuing, she wrote, “Especially persuasive is the fact that goddess figurines — and larger-scale goddess images as well — exist in later cultures in the same geographic area” as the prehistoric figurines (p. 139).\n\nIn a partially sympathetic review, Ginette Castro wrote, \"For this obscure librarian from Florida, myth is historically true\" . . . \"Elizabeth Gould Davis's historical reconstruction depends a great deal on drawing morals from the tale, and is filled with numerous, glaring extrapolations. However, the argument is so skillfully and ingeniously woven that the woman reader cannot help but be swayed.\" \"Although it is difficult to grant the book any immediate practical value, it must be recognized that it has a cultural interest, that of exposing the sexual substrata of our culture.\"\n\nOther writers with a feminist orientation have, however, reviewed the book more harshly. Kay L. Cothran, in the \"Journal of American Folklore\", wrote, \"the book is an example of folklore misapplied\" . . . \"The problem of evidence runs throughout the book, which is heavily footnoted and jammed with quotations. The difference between citations and evidence has not impressed itself upon [Gould] Davis. Her notes come from a librarian's search, not a scholar's research. For [Gould] Davis, a reliable source is one that agrees with her; one that disagrees is a part of the conspiracy.\" \"So the kindest thing one can say for [Gould] Davis' folkloristic and general scholarly competence is that it does not exist. It is unfortunate that she buries some sound information under such piles of rubbish.\"\n\nIn a similar vein, Amy Hackett and Sarah Pomeroy, in \"Feminist Studies\", wrote, \"Unfortunately, \"The First Sex\" is a bad book, as we shall demonstrate. Yet it deserves more than a perfunctory dismissal.\" \"The book's extravagant disorganization makes the job of summarizing nearly impossible.\" \"It typifies [Gould] Davis's method that her 'historical' chapters reflect an inverse relationship between what available sources, documents, statistics, and the like allow us to know about women in a given period and the space she devotes to that period. Some excellent sources do exist for women's history, but [Gould] Davis prefers to rely on the obscure, idiosyncratic, and piquant, ignoring more substantive sources.\" . . . \"until historians reject old-fashioned science and opt for intuition, [Gould] Davis's brand of history will be unacceptable.\"\n\nAccording to Castro, the book \"undeniably\" encouraged women to study their history.\n\n"}

It rarely occurs over 800 m ASL even in the hottest parts of its range and in mountainous or hilly terrain it inhabits, but has been recorded as high as 1,300 m ASL. It is found in a range of habitats including savanna, open woodland, and cultivation.\n\nThe short-tailed swift is about 10.5 cm long, and weighs 20 g. It has long narrow wings, a robust body and a short tail. The sexes are similar. It is mainly black with a pale rump and tail. It can be distinguished from related species in its range, such as the band-rumped swift (\"C. spinicauda\") or the gray-rumped swift (\"C. cinereiventris\") by the lack of contrast between the rump and the tail, the latter being much darker in the other species.\n\nIt is very gregarious and forms communal roosts when not breeding. Predation by bats at the nest sites has been suspected. The flight call is a rapid chittering \"sti-sti-stew-stew-stew\".\n\nThe nest is a 5 cm wide shallow half-saucer of twigs and saliva attached to a vertical surface. This is often a man-made structure like a chimney or manhole, as with its relative, the chimney swift (\"C. pelagica\"), but natural caves and tree cavities are also used. Up to seven white eggs (average 3 or 4) are incubated by both parents for 17–18 days. The young leave the nest in a further two weeks, but remain near it, clinging to the cavity wall without flying, for another two weeks.\n\nThe swift feeds in flight on flying insects, including winged ants and termites.\n\n\n"}

Originally launched on October 27, 2003, it has been in continuous operation since October 25, 2004.\n\nA student wishing to use LAMP goes to the LAMP website, and selects several songs. LAMP assigns to the student a channel on MIT Cable (e.g. Channel 63), then begins playing the selected music on that channel for anyone to listen to.\n\nOne key advantage of LAMP, in addition to its being free for its users, is the fact that any piece of music is in theory available on it because copyright law is more lax about broadcasting over analog transmissions, such as MIT Cable, than it is about digital transmissions such as those made over computer networks. For example, a person wanting to transmit a copy of \"... Baby One More Time\", written by Max Martin and performed by Britney Spears, could do it either with an analog transmission or a digital transmission. Using an analog transmission would only require permission from BMG, the publisher, whereas use of a digital transmission would require Spears's permission as well.\n\nThis aspect of copyright law is problematic for those wishing to transmit songs by artists such as The Beatles. Their label, Apple Corps, as well as others, typically do not allow digital transmissions of their music, which is why their songs were not available on online music stores such as iTunes until late 2010. However, songs by The Beatles are available on LAMP, since LAMP doesn't require Apple Corps's permission.\n\nInitially, MIT purchased audio from LoudEye, Inc., in MP3 form. However, on the day of LAMP's initial launch, Universal Music Group approached Loudeye with concerns that it lacked the necessary licenses to make the MP3s that were sold to MIT. Without music, LAMP was forced to go on a hiatus of about one year, until a different method of obtaining music was devised.\n\nLAMP in its current incarnation requires someone to purchase a physical CD and place it in a CD jukebox, where it is then turned into an MP3. However, ripping MP3s of individual songs at will is still legally questionable, so LAMP takes advantage of the \"ephemeral recording\" provision of copyright law. Under this provision, consumers can create a \"transmission program\" so long as it is designed to be played back as a whole, in sequence. LAMP currently uses \"transmission programs\" that are approximately 30 minutes in length.\n\nLAMP is appropriately built with LAMP technologies. That is to say, it runs on Linux machines, uses an Apache webserver, a MySQL database, and Perl and PHP. Portions of the software are also written in C++.\n\n"}

The New Jersey Zinc Company developed zamak alloys in 1929. Zinc alloys are popularly referred to as pot metal or white metal. While zamak is held to higher industrial standards, it is still considered a pot metal.\n\nThe most common zamak alloy is zamak 3. Besides that, zamak 2, zamak 5 and zamak 7 are also commercially used. These alloys are most commonly die cast. Zamak alloys (particularly #3 and #5) are frequently used in the spin casting industry.\n\nA large problem with early zinc die casting materials was zinc pest, owing to impurities in the alloys. Zamak avoided this by the use of 99.99% pure zinc metal, produced by New Jersey Zinc's use of a refluxer as part of the smelting process.\n\nZamak can be electroplated, wet painted, and chromate conversion coated well.\n\nIn the early 1930s Morris Ashby in Britain had licensed the New Jersey zamak alloy. The 99.99%-purity refluxer zinc was not available in Britain and so they acquired the right to manufacture the alloy using a locally available electrolytically refined zinc of 99.95% purity. This was given the name Mazak, partly to distinguish it from zamak and partly from the initials of Morris Ashby. In 1933, National Smelting licensed the refluxer patent with the intent of using it to produce 99.99% zinc in their plant at Avonmouth.\n\nZinc alloy chemical composition standards are defined per country by the standard listed below:\n\nZamak goes by many different names based on standard and/or country:\n\nThe Short European Designation code breaks down as follows (using ZL0430 as the example):\n\nZamak 2 has the same composition as zamak 3 with the addition of 3% copper in order to increase strength by 20%, which also increases the price. Zamak 2 has the greatest strength out of all the zamak alloys. Over time it retains its strength and hardness better than the other alloys; however, it becomes more brittle, shrinks, and is less elastic.\n\nZamak 2 is also known as Kirksite when gravity cast for use as a die. It was originally designed for low volume sheet metal dies. It later gained popularity for making short run injection molding dies. It is also less commonly used for non-sparking tools and mandrels for metal spinning.\n\nThe KS alloy was developed for spin casting decorative parts. It has the same composition as zamak 2, except with more magnesium in order to produce finer grains and reduce the orange peel effect.\n\nZamak 3 is the de facto standard for the zamak series of zinc alloys; all other zinc alloys are compared to this. Zamak 3 has the base composition for the zamak alloys (96% zinc, 4% aluminum). It has excellent castability and long term dimensional stability. More than 70% of all North American zinc die castings are made from zamak 3.\n\nZamak 4 was developed for the Asian markets to reduce the effects of die soldering while maintaining the ductility of zamak 3. This was achieved by using half the amount of copper from the zamak 5 composition.\n\nZamak 5 has the same composition as zamak 3 with the addition of 1% copper in order to increase strength (by approximately 10%), hardness and corrosive resistance, but reduces ductility. It also has less dimensional accuracy. Zamak 5 is more commonly used in Europe.\n\nZamak 7 has less magnesium than zamak 3 to increase fluidity and ductility, which is especially useful when casting thin wall components. In order to reduce inter-granular corrosion a small amount of nickel is added and impurities are more strictly controlled.\n\nCommon uses for zamak alloys include:\n\nZamak alloys are also used in firearms, including those manufactured by:\n\n\n"}

Zimmer has become such a celebrated performer that she is often considered to be an \"icon\" in the daytime drama industry.\n\nKim Zimmer is often regarded as one of the most popular performers ever to appear on CBS' \"Guiding Light\" and on all of daytime television. Zimmer has been with the show from 1983-1990 and 1995 until its final episode of 2009, spanning 21 years of storyline for the character. Zimmer's career in daytime soaps outside of her most notable role include Bonnie Harmon on ABC's \"One Life to Live\" in 1978, Nola Dancy Aldrich on NBC's \"The Doctors\" from 1979-1982 when she took over for her eventual \"Body Heat\" co-star Kathleen Turner and Jodie DeWitt Walker on \"Santa Barbara\" from 1992-1993. In 1983, Zimmer returned to \"OLTL\" as new character Echo DiSavoy but left several months later. She returned in October 2010 after a 27-year absence and remained with the show until the following year. The actress recalled being in conversations to join other soaps when \"OLTL's\" executive producer Frank Valentini unexpectedly asked her to return. Zimmer also appeared ABC's \"MacGyver\", FOX's \"Models Inc.\" and on NBC's \"Seinfeld\" in the 1995 episode \"The Diplomat's Club\". Zimmer's character was celebrated and immortalized in the release of \"The Reva Shayne Collection\" DVD set by \"Soap Classics\" in 2012, which included episodes such as \"Reva’s debut on November 28, 1983, the infamous \"Slut of Springfield\" fountain episode from July 31, 1984, Reva's presumed death in 1990, \"Like Mother, Like Son\" from November 17, 2004 (Reva and Jonathan's dip in the fountain) and \"Reva and Josh 4-Ever\", a special episode on the day of Josh and Reva's divorce on April 12, 2006.\" Zimmer has won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series four times in 1985, 1987, 1990 and 2006 and has been nominated eleven times in the same category.\n\nFollowing the end of \"GL\", Zimmer released her autobiography \"I'm Just Sayin': Three Deaths, Seven Husbands and a Clone! My Life as a Daytime Diva\" in August 2010. The book followed her career and her own personal struggles over the years. Zimmer believed that the book will make the public see her for who she truly is and said, \"When you’re with a character that long, sometimes it makes you wonder, Who am I? The book will correlate Reva to Kim, hopefully with humor.\" The actress has also been appearing in numerous stage productions including \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"Blood Brothers\", \"Gypsy\", \"The Rainmaker\", \"Love, Loss and What I Wore\", \"Odysseus D.O.A.\" and \"Lost Boy Found in Whole Foods\" which raised funds for the awareness in Darfur. Zimmer also participated in \"ABC Daytime Salutes Broadway Cares\" in 2010 and appeared with former co-star Robert Newman, who played |Josh Lewis in the production of \"Curtains\" in 2011. In 2012, Zimmer, along with several other daytime actors, began filming for the movie \"23 Blast\" in Corbin, Kentucky. Zimmer also played Madame Morrible in the New Orleans Broadway show \"Wicked, \"June 2013.\n\nReva Shayne has been the focus of various situations throughout her life in and outside of Springfield, Illinois. She has been married nine times to seven different men, has been diagnosed as a manic-depressive, presumed dead various times in which she lost her memory and thought she was an Amish woman and lived the life as a princess, undergone a battle with Dolly, a clone who attempted to overtake her life after her husband allowed a reproduction of his wife after she apparently died and traveled through time. A memorable event that led to her presumed death was when she drove off the Bahia Honda Bridge in the Florida Keys, yelling, \"I'm coming, Bud!\" in 1990. Some of the more sensible areas of her life has been her career as a business executive and talk show host. Reva's biggest battle was when she was diagnosed with breast cancer and suffered from the ordeal again during her pregnancy with her son Colin although she had since been diagnosed with menopause. Reva's cancer diagnosis sent her through an initial disbelief and hesitancy before treatment. her husband Josh Lewis, was in the dark along with the rest of Springfield until Reva was on her deathbed.\n\nOutside of her adventures and traumatic events that altered the course of her life, Reva has made a name for herself in the game of love. Though she married seven men including Alan Spaulding and Buzz Cooper, her marriages within the Lewis family are most notable. She married H.B. Lewis and his son Billy Lewis II but her greatest love was another man in that family, Joshua Lewis. Their star-crossed relationship lifted them into Supercouple status. Their relationship resulted in the births of two children Shayne Lewis and Marah Lewis. Reva also has three other children including Dylan Lewis with Billy, Jonathan Randall with her ex-husband Richard Winslow and Colin O'Neill with her husband Jeffrey O'Neill, who has since been presumed dead although his current whereabouts are unknown. Reva is also the grandmother of Daisy Lemay through Dylan, Sarah Randall through Jonathan and Henry Lewis through Shayne. Reva closed out the show with Josh and her son Colin as they reunited and drove off to parts unknown in the Ford pickup truck as she said the final word spoken on the show, \"Always.\"\n\nKim Zimmer is often called \"the most beloved character on the show.\" One of her most memorable scenes include her jumping into a fountain and baptizing herself the \"Slut of Springfield\". Zimmer's Reva Shayne and Robert Newman's Josh Lewis are often considered to be one of daytime television's most popular Supercouples. Josh and Reva's story began while they were childhood sweethearts before they reconnected years later and continued their blossoming love story, which weathered her two presumed deaths, three divorces and endless external battles. However, their relationship resulted in two children and countless professions of love.\n\nRegarding her memorable fountain scene, which is often cited as one of the genre's most unforgettable performances, Zimmer recalled filming that day with daytime columnist Michael Fairman.\n\"All I know is when I finished that scene I did not hear them call “cut” because it was the most I ever lost myself in a scene. Now, I have had a few of those moments since, but not a lot of them. I mean, I was really good if I had emotional scenes, and I used to piss off one of the make-up artists, because they would say, “cut” and I would crack a joke! Or, I would say I just peed in my pants just to get out of it. But that day after that fountain scene I was lost, and then the crew started applauding. And I can tell you that was the first time I ever had applause on a set before. That was rare. Every body was so quiet that you could hear a pin drop.\"\n\n—Kim Zimmer, \"Michael Fairman On-Air On-Soaps\"\nZimmer came in at the second spot on \"We Love Soaps\"' list of the \"50 Greatest Soap Actresses\" in 2010. Her longtime co-star Newman recalled his time working with the actress over the years on \"Guiding Light\".\n\"Kim is one of the craziest, toughest broads on the planet. This also happens to make her one of the finest actors one could ever hope to work with. She is always honest in her work. Nothing is phoned in. Nothing is manufactured. She is the real deal 24/7. She will fight and argue and scratch and claw in rehearsal, but when that red light goes on, she is 100% committed to whatever the story is at that moment. She is a force to be reckoned with. When you’re on camera with Kim, you’d better bring you’re \"A\" game. She will. Every time.\"\n\n—Robert Newman, \"We Love Soaps\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2117752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117752", "title": "Spaceward Ho!", "text": "Spaceward Ho!\n\nSpaceward Ho! is a turn-based science fiction computer strategy game that was written by Peter Commons, designed by Joe Williams (Joedelta) and published by Delta Tao Software. The first version was released in 1990, and further upgrades followed regularly; the current version, 5.0.5, was released on July 8, 2003. It has received wide recognition in the Macintosh community, for example being inducted into the Macworld Game Hall of Fame.\n\n\"Spaceward Ho!\" can be categorized in the 4X game genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) with a theme of galactic conquest. It took many elements of its design from the earlier \"Reach for the Stars\", but expanded on many of that game's basic themes while taking advantage of the larger memory and better graphics available on the Mac platform.\n\nVersion 5 is available for iOS, Android, Classic Mac OS, and Mac OS X versions before 10.7 (there is no universal binary) and Palm OS. Version 4 is also available for Windows and version 2 for Amiga.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Spaceward Ho!\" focuses on efficiently extracting the resources of conquered worlds while correctly anticipating and countering opponents' actions.\n\n\"Spaceward Ho!\" can be played against a computer AI, or against other human players over the internet (via spacewardho.net). Previous versions of the game allowed also LAN-based networked play, but this feature has been disabled in the Mac OS X version. It has a very simple gameplay compared with most other games in the genre (such as \"Master of Orion\"). Depending on the initial settings, games take from about ten minutes to an hour. Its small but dedicated fanbase considers the simplicity to be elegance, and its designers boast that it has gotten faster and more intuitive to play with each new version. All unnecessary complexity has been stripped from the game, resulting in a fast-paced game that still manages to be very engaging.\n\nThe core of the game is the two-dimensional map of \"planets\". Each \"planet\" has three characteristics: temperature, gravity, and metal. Temperature and gravity are both used to determine how fast colonies can grow and how large they can become (based on the preferred temperature and gravity for the colonizer, which is different for each player); the difference is that a player may spend money to change the temperature (\"terraforming\") while gravity cannot be changed. Colonies with low population take a certain amount of money per turn to support, while colonies with high population earn money for their owner. Metal can, with money expenditure, be mined for use with shipbuilding. A planet's stats are unknown until explored (to get current info on a planet, a player must have ships in orbit with no enemies present). Travel between planets is via hyperspace (ships cannot encounter each other except at planets), and the time it takes depends on the distance between the origin and the destination on the map, as well as on the speed of the ship in question.\n\nShips are built with money (representing renewable resources) and metal (representing non-renewable resources). Money and metal are available instantly, wherever needed. There are several different kinds of ships, including the basic Fighter, a Scout with longer range but weaker weapons, a Colony Ship used to found new colonies, Satellites which are cheap but cannot move from the world at which they are built, and in recent versions a few others as well, such as the Tanker and Dreadnought. Each ship has a ranking in each of five technologies: range (determining how far a ship can fly before refueling), speed (determining how quickly ships reach their destinations and who shoots first in a battle), weapons, shields, and \"miniaturization\". Higher-tech ships cost more money and metal, with the exception of ships with high \"miniaturization\" which take far more money but less metal. Miniaturization is much less effective when applied to Colony Ships, compared to other types of ships. Ships cannot be upgraded, although old ships can be scrapped to retrieve a portion of their metal. When a ship is destroyed in battle, a smaller portion can also be recovered. The first ship of a given design costs two to four times as much as subsequent units, to account for research and design costs.\n\nThere is no ground combat; ships that face an undefended enemy colony simply bombard it from orbit until they or the entire planet population is dead. The planet can then be recolonized by the victor's species. If a battle lasts into the second round of firing, the participants will get information on what happened; if it ends in only one round, the loser will know only that he lost.\n\nIn addition to spending on supporting colonies, terraforming planets, mining planets, and building ships, players can spend money on technological research. This raises the available maximum for each of the five ship technologies. There is also a sixth type of research, \"Radical\", which gives unpredictable advantages such as improved terraforming, information about distant planets, or a temporary advantage in one tech. Most spending in the game follows the law of diminishing returns: it is more effective to spend lightly but constantly on a given tech or planet for a long period of time than to spend heavily for a short period of time. For example, a novice player might reason that allocating 20% of one's income to mining a particular planet would yield twice as much metal as allocating 10%; in fact, it yields only 40% more metal.\n\nA pseudo-logarithmic bar graph displays the player's spending allocations. The player manipulates the bars with the mouse to allocate spending. As one bar is lengthened, the lengths of the other bars are automatically shortened (and vice versa).\n\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" praised \"Spaceward Ho!\", calling it \"the Holy Grail of strategic computer games – \"the\" entertaining, introductory strategy game\", especially for multiple players over a network. A February 1994 survey of space war games gave it a grade of A, stating that \"Spaceward Ho!\" \"drew in many non-wargamer types with the use of clever bells and whistles\". A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game four stars out of five, criticizing the cover art but stating that it \"offers a fine 'beer and pretzels' game of economic/military space conquest ... Great gameplay and graphics with a touch of crass\". \"Spaceward Ho!\" v. 3.0 for the Macintosh was reviewed in 1993 in \"Dragon\" #196 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. The game was reviewed in 1994 in \"Dragon\" #202 by Sandy Petersen in the \"Eye of the Monitor\" column. Petersen gave the solo version of the game 2 out of 5 stars, and the multiplayer version 3 stars.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Macintosh version of \"Spaceward Ho 4.0\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"If you already own a copy, now is definitely time to step up to a new level of play.\"\n\nIn 1996, \"Next Generation\" listed \"Spaceward Ho!\" as number 52 on their \"Top 100 Games of All Time\", citing its \"deceptive level of depth\", high replay value, and eight-player mode. Wil Wheaton called it one of his favorite games.\n\n\n\n"}

Its hamlets (\"frazioni\") are the villages of Camarda, Capannola, Foggianello, Foggiano, Isca ricotta, Leonessa, Masseria Casella, Masseria Catapane, Masseria Menolecchia, Parasacco, San Giorgio di Melfi, San Nicola, Vaccareccia and Villa Mariannina.\n\nInhabited by the Daunians and Lucanians, under the Romans it was included in the area of the colony of \"Venusia\", founded in 291 BC. After the fall of Western Roman Empire, Melfi gained importance in the Middle Ages as a strategic point between areas controlled by the Byzantines and those controlled by the Lombards.\n\nMelfi was captured several times by the struggling powers of the region, until it was assigned to the Norman leader William I of Hauteville. The Hauteville family started from here their conquest of southern Italy, which, in the early 12th century, led to the creation of the Kingdom of Sicily.\n\nIn 1059 Melfi became the capital of the Duchy of Apulia. Papal councils were held in the city in the same year and in 1109. In 1231, Emperor Frederick II proclaimed the Constitutions of Melfi (or \"Constitutiones Augustales\") here, reinforcing control over his ever-expanding territory. He created a bureaucracy of paid officials, who among other things imposed a tax system on the local feudal rulers, who resented it but could not resist.\n\nLater, the town shared the fate of the entire Kingdom of Naples, falling into a long period of decline. Under the Angevin crown, Charles II ordered the castle to be renovated and enlarged, making it the official residence of his wife Mary of Hungary.\n\nDuring the war between Francis I of France and Charles V of Spain for the Kingdom of Naples, the French army headed by Odet de Foix sieged Melfi in March 1528, slaying about 3.000 people, without sparing women or children.\n\nBeating the French occupation, Charles V gave to Andrea Doria the title of Prince of Melfi, for having successfully fought for his cause. His family held the city until the end of the feudal system and maintained properties and estates until the agrarian reform in the middle of the 20th century.\n\nDuring the Parthenopean Republic, proclaimed in 1799, Melfi was controlled by the republicans until the arrival of the sanfedisti headed by the cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo on May 29 of the same year. Unlike other centers, Ruffo was able to prevent the sack of Melfi, although many revolutionaries died in prisons, probably due to diseases or abuses.\n\nAfter the Italian unification, Melfi was involved in a bloody civil war labeled as brigandage and was occupied by the peasant army of Carmine Crocco on April 15, 1861; in order to restore the Bourbon government of Francis II in the Vulture area.\n\nDuring the Fascist regime, it was land of exile for antifascists such as Manlio Rossi-Doria, Franco Venturi, Eugenio Colorni and his wife Ursula Hirschmann. Melfi was devastated by the 1930 Irpinia earthquake and, during the Second World War, suffered a bombardment by the Allied Forces on September 26, 1943.\n\nThe city enjoyed a revival of sorts from the end of the 20th century, and recently has gained additional prosperity when the Italian auto firm FIAT built a factory here. Melfi was candidated as a capital of an autonomous province for several times. The first proposal dates back to 1866 and many were advanced over the years; the last one was made in 2006 by senators Guido Viceconte and Vincenzo Taddei.\n\nThe Castle, dominates the whole town. It was probably constructed \"ex novo\" by the Normans (11th century), as no trace of pre-existing Byzantine or Lombard edifices has been found. Originally, it was probably a simple rectangle with square towers, with further towers defending the main gate. One of the main internal buildings was later (16th-18th centuries) turned into a baronial palace by enclosing the walls between the towers within new walls. Under the Angevine rule a new section was added on the slope descending to the Melfia stream, with several constructions rising at different altitudes. The Castle was chosen by King Charles II's wife, Mary of Hungary, as her residence. The Aragon kings gave it to the Caracciolo family, who rebuilt the side facing the city and dug a moat. Later it was a possession of the powerful House of Doria.\n\nThe \"Duomo\" (Cathedral), built in the 11th century for want of Robert Guiscard, it was also rehandled in the baroque style after the earthquakes, with exception of the original Norman bell tower. The interior contains a magnificent 13th-century fresco, the \"Madonna with Child and Angels\".\n\nThe \"Palazzo del Vescovado\" (Bishopric Palace), erected in the 11th century but rebuilt in the baroque style in the 18th century because of the earthquakes. It contains paintings by Nicholas of Tolentino and Cristiano Danona.\n\nThe town winds along the Norman walls, with various gates, the most noteworthy being the \"Venosina\" gate (dating to the early 13th century), an ogival arch with two cylindrical towers on either side.\n\nSince 1976 the Castle is home to the important \"Museo Nazionale Archeologico Melfese\", with artifacts found in the area, from prehistoric times and all periods of settlement including the Daunian, Samnite, Lucanian and Roman periods. The most famous piece is the sarcophagus of Rapolla, a valuable example of imperial sculpture from the 2nd century CE, which came to light in 1856. There are collections of the archaic era (7th-6th century BC) with male and female funerary objects including amber pendants and the so-called Lavello cup. Of the 5th and century BC are the Hellenic-style finds - red ceramic figures called and other princely objects. There are also Samnite artifacts from the 5th-3rd century BC, mostly in ivory and bone, as well as examples of Canosino pottery.\n\nThe rock church of Santa Margherita is completely dug out of volcanic tofa. Its architectonic structure and the style of its frescos are dated to the 13th century. It is the most beautiful and best preserved amongst the numerous frescoed caves found on the slopes of mt. Vulture, an evident result of an ancient and widespread monastic settlement. The phenomenon of rock churches in Southern Italy dates back to the monastic migration from Asia Minor and Balkans after the iconoclastic battles of the early 8th century.\n\nMelfi was mainly an agricultural center until the beginning of the nineties, since then the industrial sector received a boost in the frazione of San Nicola, with the building of an automobile factory owned by Fiat. The plant contributed to the economic recovery of the company in the mid-nineties and the growth of its market share in Europe.\n\nThere are also about 30 companies linked to the implant, including Magneti Marelli, Tower Automotive, Benteler, Proma and Lear. The Fiat of Melfi has produced cars such as Grande Punto and Lancia Ypsilon and today is focused on the production of the Jeep Renegade and the Fiat 500X. The plant has produced 5.000.000 vehicles up to 2010.\n\nIn July 2018, this plant was also mentioned in international news after its workers announced a strike so as to protest about their conditions in view of the acquisition of the international football star Cristiano Ronaldo by Juventus F.C. of Turin. This football club is owned by the Agnelli family who also owns Fiat Crysler.\n\nMelfi also hosts a Barilla factory, built in 1994, and the seat of Gaudianello's mineral water company, among the top 10 national companies in the sector and founded in Rionero in Vulture, where the extraction is carried out.\n\nMelfi is one of the cities in the Vulture area involved in the production of the \"Aglianico del Vulture\", recognized as DOC, considered one of the greatest red wines of Italy, and the olive oil \"Vulture\". Another renowned product is the \"marroncino\", a type of chestnut used for many sweet and salty recipes and is precious for the industries specialized in the preparation of the marron glacé.\n\nThe local football club is the A.S. Melfi, and its home ground is the Stadio Arturo Valerio.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117763", "title": "Cunderdin, Western Australia", "text": "Cunderdin, Western Australia\n\nCunderdin is a town located in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia 156 km east of Perth, along the Great Eastern Highway. Due to it being on the route of the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme it is also on the Golden Pipeline Heritage Trail. It is a rural community consisting of a district high school and an agricultural college.\n\nThe Shire of Cunderdin (2014) reported the first European visitor to the area was Charles Cooke Hunt, who explored the area in 1864 and recorded the name Cunderdin, from the Njungyar Aboriginal name of a nearby hill. The meaning of the name is thought to mean either \"place of the bandicoot\" or \"place of flowers\" (Shire of Cunderdin, 2014).\n\nLike many small towns in the area, Cunderdin developed as a stop-off town during the gold rush in the WA Goldfields (Reeves, Frost, & Fahey, 2010). Significantly in 1894 the railway arrived signalling the earliest settlement in the town (Shire of Cunderdin, 2014). In 1901 the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme, designed by C. Y. O'Connor, led to a renewed increase in population of the town (Water Corporation, 2015). The townsite was gazetted in 1906.\n\nIn 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. An elevator was duly erected the following year next to the Westralian Farmers grain-shed.\n\nIn late 1933 the local tennis courts were first opened in front of a crowd of about 100 players, a tournament was held the same afternoon. The local hospital also had an X-ray plant installed and commissioned a week later.\n\nCunderdin Agricultural College is formally known as the Western Australian College of Agriculture Cunderdin- WACoA (Western Australian College of Agriculture Cunderdin, 2015). According to the Department of Education the college has well-maintained facilities for practical agricultural training, the trade training centre, an academic classroom area, and a residential campus which houses 125 year 11 and 12 students. The Shire of Cunderdin (2014) states The Western Australian College of Agriculture is located 158 km east of Perth and is a part of the wheatbelt region. It is one of the five recognised public agricultural colleges of Western Australia, and Cunderdin was awarded WA Secondary School of the year in 2014 (Department of Education, 2015) According to the Department of Education (2015) the college has been successful in winning the national award for vocational education in schools excellence. The secondary school of the year report by the Department of Education (2015) found an average Australian Tertiary Admission Rank for the agricultural college of 39.6 in 2011, increasing to 62.7 in 2012. The Department of Regional Development (2014) states with the funding from the Royalties for Regions and Department of Education, the college farm will expand by more than 1000 hectares to provide better education opportunities for students within the cropping and livestock sectors. This will result in the college farm holding more than 3000 hectares, with the addition of the additional 1000 arable hectares (Department of Regional Development). The Department of Education (2015) acknowledges that all students graduating from WACoA gain two or more Australian Quality Training Framework qualifications and complete a range of short courses in order to obtain their OH&S cards, certificates in chemical safety, bush fire fighting courses, firearm safety certificates and senior first aid qualifications. Students are given the opportunity to present their work and talents throughout a range of shows such as Dowerin Field Day, Wagin Woolorama, the Perth Royal Show and other community days held by small town shires in the Wheatbelt (Department of Education, 2015). These shows enable students to be a part of the shearing team, led steer team, fencing team and other trade subjects such as furnishings and engineering, where their achievements and efforts are recognised within the community through local newspapers and college newsletters (Department of Education). The Department of Education (2015) suggests the agricultural college provides students with excellent facilities, resulting in many awards and commendations for the level of training provided and maintains a good status holding an annual open day with approximately 600 people each year.\n\nSource: Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016\n\nThe Cunderdin Airstrip is situated in the middle of the College farm at the Western Australian College of Agriculture and still functions today. (Western Australian College of Agriculture Cunderdin, 2015). According to the Shire of Cunderdin (2014) the airstrip was built early in the Second World War and was designed as a RAAF flying school base and as a bomber during war. In the later stages of the War, the airstrip became known as the No 25 Squadron, which was used for operating Liberator bombers and kept well maintained so it could be of use in later years (RAAF Museum, 2009). In 1941, the airstrip was formally known as the No 9 Elementary Flying Training School and consisted of 34 officers, 500 airmen, and 51 aircraft (Shire of Cunderdin, 2014). The RAAF Museum (2009) explains how the aircraft base in Cunderdin was important for any aircraft flying from Perth to Australia’s east coast. The Shire of Cunderdin (2014) claims the airstrip, among others, to play a major role in the success of the town. The airstrip is now owned by the Shire and has the newly constructed aerodrome complex. (Gliding Club of Western Australia, 2015). It is run, and maintained by the Gliding Club of Western Australia and includes housing for those using it over an extended period of time (Shire of Cunderdin, 2014). Among that, the Automatic Weather Station (AWS) has a station set up at the airfield to gain results for the weather such as rainfall, temperature and other important figures (Shire of Cunderdin, 2014).\n\nCunderdin is a predominantly agricultural based town with nearby farms surrounding town and the Agricultural College. The statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2016) state in 2011 661, 701 hectares of land was occupied by the holding of agricultural commodities. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (2016) reported in 2011 there was a count of 4,726 cattle, 382,929 sheep, and 2,624 pigs in a part of the agricultural sector in Cunderdin farms. The Agricultural College sows and harvests wheat, barley, canola, field peas and oats each year (Western Australian College of Agriculture Cunderdin, 2015).\n\nThe Golden Pipeline runs through Cunderdin and provides water for the town (Shire of Cunderdin, 2014). According to the Water Corporation (2015) 40% of the water in the pipeline is delivered to the agricultural area, including Cunderdin. Cunderdin is one of 24 pump stations running through the pipe (Water Corporation, 2015). Based on Baxter road is the project combination of GRDC (Grains Research and Development Corporation) and DAFWA (Department of Agriculture and Food) named WANTFA (Grains Research and Development Corporation, 2015). WANTFA stands for the Western Australian No-Tillage Farmers Association and is an organisation set up to study and experiment with broad acre cropping systems (WANTFA, 2015). WANTFA was initiated in 1992, and is known to be the largest grower group in Western Australia (WANTFA, 2015). The Shire of Cunderdin, 2014 suggests the agricultural sector of the town contributes heavily to the success of the town and with the trials planted around the community; the results and future of agriculture will increase over the years.\n\nYoundegin is a historic site along the Cunderdin- Quairading road, just 19 km south of Cunderdin town and represents the first settlement in the area (Shire of Cunderdin, 2014). Following the death of E.J. Clarkson, an early settler in the Cunderdin district, the old original police output was constructed from stone and mud with a thatched roof (Shire of Cunderdin, 2014). The Shire of Cunderdin (2014) suggested Constable Allerly was the original police officer in the area who took charge of the post and kept watch for any crime, however in 1880, Constable Alfred Eaton arrived into Cunderdin and took over running the station and along with his wife. It was found by the Shire of Cunderdin (2014) that the popular delicacy of the time in the area was parrot pie. When the railway was built Constable Eaton left the police force and became the first farmer within the Cunderdin district.\n\n\"Cunderdin daviesia\" (Daviesiacunderdin) is a small to medium-sized shrub, which grows to 1.6 m high. It appears that it is isolated to the Cunderdin area.\n\nVisitors cannot help but notice the large Ettamogah theme hotel and pub when driving through the town, due to its redness and a car on its roof. It is based on the comics of Ken Maynard and is one of a few of these pubs scattered throughout Australia. There are similar venues in Sydney, Albury-Wodonga, The Sunshine Coast, Queensland and Morley.\n\nCunderdin also serves as a stop on the \"Prospector\" and \"MerredinLink\" rural train services.\n\nTranswa's \"MerredinLink\" and \"Prospector\" services stop at Cunderdin, at least one service each day.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nAlcantara was first established in 1730 as \"La Lauan\", a barrio of Looc town by migrants from Panay Island led by Don Ciriaco Alcantara. In 1855, the barrio was annexed from Looc and converted into a \"pueblo\" or town. However, in 1868, it was abolished and annexed as a barrio of Guintigui-an town (renamed Badajoz, now San Agustin) after a reorganization of municipalities resulting from the creation of Romblon province.\n\nIn 1870, due to continuous intimidation from Muslim pirates, as well as the rugged terrain, the residents of La Lauan led by a certain Gaspar Guevarra transferred from its former site in Daan Banwa (or Old Town) and established a new barrio down south called Alcantara, after Don Ciriaco Alcantara. In 1885, it was annexed back as a barrio of Looc, and would remain so until after World War II.\n\nAlcantara was elevated to municipality status on 21 March 1961 by virtue of Executive Order 427 signed by then President Carlos P. Garcia.\n\nAlcantara lies in the southeast portion of Tablas Island. It is bounded to the north by the municipality of Santa Maria, to the west by Looc, to the south by Santa Fe, and to the east by the Sibuyan Sea. Most of Alcantara lies in plains along the coast with mountains in the interior to the west.\n\nAlcantara is politically subdivided into 12 barangays:\n\nAccording to the 2015 census, it has a population of 16,351 people. Just like in the neighboring municipality of Santa Maria, majority of the population speaks the Alcantaranon variant of Inunhan or Onhan where /l/ is used instead of /r/.\n\nFarming and fishing are the major sources of income in Alcantara. Fishing grounds along the coastal areas of the municipality abound with mackerel, sea bass, tuna, anchovies, \"tanguigue\", \"sapsap\", and commercial tropical fish for aquariums. Forest products such as \"nito\" and \"huwag\" are abundant in some of its barangays.\n\nPursuant to Chapter II, Title II, Book III of Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991, the municipal government is composed of a mayor (alkalde), a vice mayor (bise alkalde) and members (kagawad) of the legislative branch Sangguniang Bayan alongside a secretary to the said legislature, all of which are elected to a three-year term and are eligible to run for three consecutive terms.\n\n Died in office. \n\nRiza Galicia y Pamorada from the LAKAS-CMD, is Alcantara's incumbent mayor as of 30 June 2019\n\nBecause much of Alcantara's interior is made up of mountains covered in lush tropical rainforest, it is being promoted as a hiking destination for backpackers. There are freshwater springs located in Camili, Calogonsao, Bonlao, San Isidro, and Madalag which tourists can enjoy. Other tourist spots in Alcantara include:\n\n\nThe Tablas Island Electric Cooperative (TIECO) and NAPOCOR supply 57.75 percent of the 2,740 households Alcantara with electricity. As for water supply, Alcantara has one irrigation service with 37 service areas and three community irrigation with 75 service areas. Potable water supply comes from jet pumps, open wells, artesian wells and springs.\n\nAlcantara is home to Romblon's sole airport in Barangay Tugdan. Cebu Pacific operates four flights a week to Romblon via the airport. Visitors going to Alcantara can reach Tablas Island via Odiongan where RORO vessels from Manila, Batangas City, and Roxas, Oriental Mindoro regularly stop by. From Odiongan, Alcantara is just an hour or two by jeepney.\n\nPeople in the town take public utility jeepneys (PUJ), pedicabs, tricycles, and motorcycles to and from neighboring towns. The Tablas Circumferential Road connects Alcantara with neighboring municipalities. PLDT, Smart, and Globe provide landline and cellular phone services in the municipality.\n\nRomblon National Institute of Technology (RNIT) is located in Poblacion, formerly Alcantara National Trade School. The town also has three public high schools offering quality education under the Department of Education.\n\n"}
{"id": "2117789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117789", "title": "Banton, Romblon", "text": "Banton, Romblon\n\n', officially the ', (formerly known as Jones), is a fifth-class in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIts territory encompasses the entire island of Banton located on the northern portion of the province and lies on the northern portion of the Sibuyan Sea near the southern tip of Marinduque. It is a town of about 5,000 people majority of which speak the Bantoanon language, one of the five primary branches of the Bisayan languages.\n\nBanton is thought to be already inhabited by Filipinos since the pre-colonial period, based on analysis of discovered human remains, coffins, an ancient burial cloth and other archaeological finds by the National Museum in the 1930s. The present settlement was founded in 1622 by the Spanish and is the oldest settlement in the province. During the American colonial period, the municipality changed its name to Jones in honor of American congressman William Jones, who authored the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916. Today, Banton is one of Romblon's thriving municipalities, with an economy dependent on copra farming, fishing, raffia palm weaving, and tourism. The island is collectively known as a \"cultural landscape\" due to its historical, cultural and archaeological value to humanity.\n\nThe name \"Banton\" was derived from the Asi word \"batoon\", meaning \"rocky\", referring to the mountainous and rocky topography of the island due to its volcanic origin. Another possible origin is the word \"bantoy\", which is the Asi word for the venomous stonefish.\n\nBanton was already inhabited during pre-colonial times as proven by ancient artefacts such as wooden coffins and skeletal remains found in the island's caves in 1936 by a team of researchers from the National Museum of the Philippines. Among the artefacts was the Banton Cloth, a piece of a traditional burial cloth found in one of the wooden coffins. It is estimated to be 400 years old, making it the earliest known warp ikat (tie-resist dyeing) textile in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. These artifacts are now preserved at the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.\n\nThe municipality of Banton was established by Spanish colonial authorities in 1622, the first town established in Romblon, which was then part of Capiz province. It was initially founded in a site in Bacoco Hill (now part of Barangay Hambian), south-west of its present site. The administration of the other islands of Romblon were put under the jurisdiction of Banton until 1631, when Pueblo de Romblon was founded. In 1640, due to frequent raids by Moros, who looted and pillaged the settlement, the limestone fort called \"Fuerza de San Jose\" and the San Nicolas de Tolentino Parish Church was constructed under the leadership of Father Agustin de San Pedro, also known as \"El Padre Capitan\", who was the parish priest of Banton at that time. The construction was completed in 1644, and in 1648, San Nicolas de Tolentino was installed as the town's patron saint. The fort effectively protected the town against further Moro raids. Banton ceased being part of Capiz when the Spanish colonial government created the politico-military province of Romblon on 11 January 1868.\n\nWhen civilian government was introduced in Romblon by the Americans on 16 March 1901, Banton was one of the 11 new municipalities reinstated or created. In 1918, the municipality was renamed Jones in honor of American congressman William Jones, who authored the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916 that provided for greater autonomy for the Philippines under American colonial rule. On 8 June 1940, with the passage of Commonwealth Act No. 581, all of Romblon's municipalities were dissolved and Jones, together with Corcuera and Concepcion, were consolidated into a special municipality called Maghali, one of four special municipalities that the law created (the rest being Romblon, Tablas and Sibuyan). The reorganization proved to be difficult for the province's local leaders, and after World War II, Republic Act No. 38 repealed Commonwealth Act No. 581, restoring Jones to its pre-war status. On 24 April 1959, Republic Act No. 2158 restored the island to its former name, Banton.\n\nIn 2013, Banton was one of the sites of a detailed resource assessment by the Department of Energy (DOE), along with Maricaban Island in Batangas and Balut Island in Saranggani. The study aimed to determine whether the island can be a site for low enthalpy geothermal power generation. However, no exploitable geothermal resource has been delineated on the island. On 19 March 2013, the National Museum declared as Important Cultural Property the island's Guyangan Cave System, where precolonial wooden coffins, remains, and the Banton Cloth were found.\n\nThe island municipality was greatly devastated by Typhoon Melor on 15 December 2015, which made its fourth landfall over the island, and by Typhoon Kammuri on 3 December 2019, which made its second landfall over the island.\n\nBanton, just like the rest of Romblon province, was placed under enhanced community quarantine beginning 17 March 2020 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the province. \n\nDuring the period of the enhanced community quarantine, the population of the Philippine long-tailed macaque (\"Macaca fascicularis philippensis\") in the island was found to have increased over previously documented levels, with the monkeys destroying crops and raiding homes. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources sent a team to the island, which confirmed the population increase. To control its population, the team suggested that the macaques be exported to monkey farms in Luzon for use in scientific research on diseases such as Ebola. Nedim Buyukmihci, a professor emeritus of veterinary medicine at the University of California-Davis has expressed opposition to the plan.\n\nBanton lies on the northern portion of the Sibuyan Sea, and is equidistant between Marinduque Island to the north and Tablas Island to the south. It is composed of the main island of Banton and the uninhabited islands of Bantoncillo, Carlota and Isabel, the last two of which are collectively known as the Dos Hermanas Islands. There is also an islet near Tabonan Beach on the north-west of the island.\nBanton has a total land area of . Based on rock petrology, the island is a dormant volcano which lies at the southernmost portion of the Pleistocene-Quaternary West Luzon volcanic arc and may have been active during the Pliocene period. Because of its volcanic origin, the island has a mountainous, rocky topography, with very few patches of flat land suitable for farming. The island's highest elevation, Mount Ampongo, rises at .\n\nBanton is politically subdivided into 17 barangays. In 1954, the sitios of Mahaba, Angomon, Solocan, Kapanranan, and Yabawon were consolidated into the barangay known as Yabawon.\n\nAs part of Romblon, Banton is classified under Type III of the Corona climatic classification system. This type of climate is described as having no prominent wet or dry seasons. The wet season, which usually occurs from June to November can extend up to December during the onset of the southwest monsoon. The dry season from January to May may sometimes have periods of rainfall or even inclement weather.\n\nAccording to the , Banton has a population of people. The island municipality is sparsely populated with a population density of . According to the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), in 2013, there were 3,694 registered voters in Banton, spread over 31 electoral precincts. Of this figure, 1,794 are male registered voters, while 1,900 are female.\n\nThe island's inhabitants speak the Bantoanon language, one of three major languages spoken in Romblon and one of five primary branches of the Bisayan language family. The island's inhabitants were the first speakers of the language throughout the province, having spoken it since precolonial times. From Banton, the language spread to other island like Maestro de Campo, Simara, and in the towns of Calatrava, and Odiongan in Tablas Island.\n\nDavid Paul Zorc, a linguist from the Australian National University whose expertise is on Philippine languages, notes that Asi speakers may have been the first Bisayan speakers in the Romblon region. He also suggests that Asi may have a Cebuano substratum and that many of its words may have been influenced by the later influx of other languages such as Romblomanon.\n\nBanton has a primarily agricultural economy, with copra farming and fishing as the main sources of livelihood. There is also an indigenous raffia palm handicraft industry. Other crops grown in the island are root crops (such as cassava, sweet potatoes), fruits and vegetables. The locals also engage in livestock raising for local consumption, and small-scale shipbuilding of wooden boats and launches.\n\nDue to the island's rocky topography and lack of a stable supply of freshwater, rice production is difficult in the island. Rice from Mindoro, Marinduque or Quezon is supplied to the island by local traders. In recent years, the island has also become a small tourist hub for Asi expatriates and foreign tourists from the United States and other countries.\n\nBanton is an eco-tourism and heritage destination due to its beaches, diving sites, caves, churches and Spanish-era fortifications.\n\nBeing the oldest settlement in Romblon, Banton has several Spanish-era fortifications and churches, as well as American-era houses. These include Fuerza de San Jose, Banton Church, the old campanile made of limestone at Everlast in Barangay Poblacion, and a limestone watchtower at Onte in Barangay Toctoc. There is an American-era house at Pinagkaisahan in Barangay Poblacion which used to be the Ugat Faigao Museum but now serves as a sari-sari store. The Asi Studies Center for Culture and the Arts (also in Everlast) serves as an information center for the Asi language and Banton history, as well as depository of Banton's archaeological and cultural artifacts. The Church of San Nicolas de Tolentino also has a small museum of pre-colonial and Spanish-era artifacts. Among these artifacts is an intricate jar known locally as \"balogodibo\", which three children accidentally found at Barangay Balogo in 2010.\n\nThe National Museum of the Philippines also announced in 2016 the construction of a site museum in the island on a 1.5 hectare property donated by the Fabicon family. The site museum will serve as depository of the island's cultural treasures and will conduct research on how to best preserve the island's intangible heritage.\n\nCaves are Banton's well-known natural formations. The Guyangan Cave System, situated at the boundary of Barangay Toctoc and Togbongan, has seven caves, some of which were inhabited during pre-colonial times, and is now an Important Cultural Treasure as declared by the National Museum. Guyangan Hill, where the caves are situated, also has a natural view deck called Manamyaw overlooking Barangay Poblacion and the Sibuyan Sea. On a clear day, the islands of Sibuyan, Romblon, and Tablas, as well as Burias Island, can be easily seen from Manamyaw. The island has several rock formations as well. Punta Matagar in Barangay Poblacion is a pointed rock formation in the shape of a spear or arrow head. In Barangay Banice, on the southern portion of the island, lies a rock arch said to be the anchorage of \"Lolo Amang\", a mythological figure in Romblon's nautical folklore similar to the Flying Dutchman.\n\nSeveral beaches dot Banton's coast including Macat-ang, Tabonan, Mahaba, Recodo, Togbongan, Mainit, and Tambak beaches. Some like Macat-ang, Tabonan, and Tambak are white sand beaches, while others, like Togbongan, are pebbled and rocky. The island's waters are also well-known dive sites, with corals that serve as breeding ground for groupers, snappers, sharks, and stingrays.\n\nBanton has annual religious and cultural festivals. The \"Sanrokan\" festival showcases the local tradition of sharing food, especially viand, among neighbors and starts from Holy Saturday up to Easter Sunday. The festival has two phases: the \"Sanrokan sa Barangay\" (sharing of food in the villages) and the \"Sanrokan sa Poblacion\" (sharing of food at the town proper). Parlor games such as chasing the pig and \"palosebo\" (climbing a greased bamboo pole to claim a prize) are held during the celebration. This is followed by the \"Hanrumanan\" (meaning \"souvenir/legacy\") street dancing and parade. Meanwhile, every year, on 10 September, the entire island pays tribute and homage to the town's patron saint, San Nicolas de Tolentino through the \"Biniray\" festival. Holy mass is held during feast day, followed by the parading of the saint's image around town. This leads to a fluvial parade around the island, with each village giving homage to the saint. Bantoanons also hold an annual Via Crucis during the Holy Week and Flores de Mayo in May.\n\nPursuant to the Local Government Code of 1991, the Banton municipal government is composed of a mayor (\"alkalde\"), a vice mayor (\"bise alkalde\") and eight members (\"kagawad\") of the \"Sangguniang Bayan\" or town council, alongside a secretary to the said council, all of which are elected to a three-year term and are eligible to run for three consecutive terms. As of 30 June 2019, Banton's incumbent mayor is Milagros \"Mely\" Faderanga of the PDP-Laban party while the incumbent Vice Mayor is Loijorge Fegalan, also of the PDP-Laban.\n\nThe barangays or villages, meanwhile, are headed by elected officials, the topmost being the \"Punong Barangay\" or the Barangay Chairperson (addressed as \"Kapitan\"; also known as the Barangay Captain). The \"Kapitan\" is aided by the \"Sangguniang Barangay\" (Barangay Council) whose members, called \"Barangay Kagawad\" (Councilors), are also elected.\n\nIn 2011 and 2013, Banton was a recipient of the Seal of Good Housekeeping from the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG). As recipient of the award, the local government was rewarded with one million pesos from the Performance Challenge Fund of the DILG for use in local projects. The Seal of Good Housekeeping is a mechanism which tracks the performance of local government units, \"specifically in the areas of local legislation, development planning, resource generation, and resource allocation\".\n\nElectricity in the island is supplied by a 0.326 MW diesel power plant of the Romblon Electric Cooperative (ROMELCO). Electricity service used to be available only in early morning, from 4:00 to 6:00 a.m. and at night, from 5:00 to 11:00 p.m., due to limited fuel supplies. On 16 March 2018, ROMELCO began supplying the island with 24-hour electricity.\n\nWater is being supplied through a level-one water system installed by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) through its Kapit-Bisig Laban sa Kahirapan-Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (Kalahi CIDDS) initiative in 2015. The water is sourced from underground freshwater springs in Barangay Mainit and distributed to individual homes through a network of pipes and pumps. Aside from this system, locals also get potable water from artesian wells built in several locations in the island and rainwater collection systems that many residents have in their homes.\n\nThe island has access to cellular phone and Internet service through Smart and Globe. Terrestrial and cable television service are also available.\n\nAs seas surrounding Banton can be rough during the wet season, the best time to visit the island is from March to May during the dry (summer) season. This is also the typical time for Asi families living in Metro Manila or abroad to visit the island since it coincides with the Lenten season and barangay fiestas. Within the island, the main forms of transportation are passenger motorcycles (known elsewhere as \"habal-habal\") and motorized boats. A circumferential road connects the 17 barangays of Banton to each other.\n\nBy sea: Banton is accessible via RORO vessels, wooden launches and motorized boats that regularly travel from Lucena City, Quezon. A RORO ferry by Starhorse Shipping leaves for Banton at 4 p.m. every Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday and returns to Lucena City from Banton at 5 p.m. every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Tourists and visitors can also take RORO vessels that ply the Manila-Odiongan, Batangas City-Odiongan, or the Roxas-Odiongan route. From Odiongan, Banton can be reached by jeepney and motorized boat via Calatrava, Romblon. Another alternative route is through Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro using motorized boats.\n\nBy air: The closest airport with active airline service is Tugdan Airport in Alcantara, Romblon. Cebu Pacific has flights to the airport, with four flights weekly from Manila. From Alcantara, Banton can be reached in five to six hours by jeepney and motorized outrigger boats from Calatrava.\nBanton has a high literacy rate owing to the establishment of several public elementary and secondary schools. All schools in the island are administered by the Department of Education (DepEd). The main public elementary school, Banton Central School, and the main secondary school, Banton National High School, are both located in the main village of Poblacion. There are public elementary schools as well in the villages of Balogo, Banice, Libtong, Nasunogan, Tan-ag, Tungonan, and Tumalum (shared with the village of Lagang). Another secondary school, Tungonan National High School, is located in Tungonan.\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people. The municipality is located on Sibuyan Island, which has been dubbed as the \"Galapagos of Asia\" due to its pristine natural environment and high endemism rate for flora and fauna.\n\nAccording to Miguel de Loarca's \"Relacion de Las Islas Filipinas\", the Spaniards led by conquistador Martin de Goiti arrived on Sibuyan Island on 10 May 1570 from Panay. Hence, Cajidiocan, as well as the rest of Romblon, became part of the province of Panay. It was administered as a \"visita\" (barrio) of \"pueblo\" de Romblon, together with Visita de Azagra.\n\nIn 1744, Pueblo de Sibuyan was founded by the Spaniards with Visita de Cajidiocan as its seat. It was one of the early pueblos established and administered as part of Capiz province, the others being Cabolutan, San Agustin (established in 1700), Looc, established in 1844, Romblon and Banton. Beginning in 1779, the friars ordered the construction of stone fortifications in these four pueblos as a defense against attacks from Muslim pirates. One of these forts was built in Bantay de Lubug, Cajidiocan.\n\nOn 23 July 1843, the pueblo changed its name to Cajidiocan, derived from the word \"jidioc\", which means \"palm\", an abundant tree in the area. On 21 November of the same year, the locals were given Spanish surnames starting with the letter \"R\" as ordered by Spanish governor-general Narciso Claveria. In 1868, when the Spaniards elevated the entire Romblon archipelago into a provinces, Cajidiocan was one of seven pueblos retained.\n\nWhen the Americans arrived in the Philippines and introduced civilian government in Romblon on 16 March 1901, Cajidiocan was one of 11 new municipalities created. However, when Romblon was abolished as a province on 15 July 1907 due to insufficient income, jurisdiction of the municipality was returned to Capiz, which would last until 1917, when Romblon was reinstated as a province.\n\nOn 8 June 1940, by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 581 authored by Congressman Leonardo Festin, the special municipality of Sibuyan was created, with Cajidiocan as its seat and absorbing the neighboring municipalities of Magdiwang and San Fernando. After World War II, on 1 October 1946, this special municipality was abolished by Republic Act No. 38, sponsored by Congressman Modesto Formelleza, and reinstated Cajidiocan, Magdiwang, and San Fernando to its original municipality status.\n\nIn 1958, Sibuyan's first government hospital, the Sibuyan District Hospital was established by virtue of Republic Act No. 2400, sponsored by Congressman Jose D. Moreno. On 18 June 1961, through Republic Act No. 3384, Cantagda was created into a separate barrio taken from barrio Danao. Meanwhile, on 17 June 1961 barrio Lumbang was split into two barrios of Lumbang Este and Lumbang Oeste with its old barrio Centro located at Barangay Lumbang Este, while sitios attached to Lumbang Oeste were the following: Pawala, Guinalan, Cansuyat, Agnaga and Hagimit.\n\nIn February 2018, the government planned the construction of a road that would go through Mt. Guiting-guiting Natural Park Protected Area, effectively endangering thousands of Sibuyan Island pristine forests that have never been touched by man. An online campaign against the road construction was launched afterwards, urging the President, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the Department of Public Work and Highways, the Mt. Guiting-guiting Natural Park Protected Area Management Board, and the LGUs of Sibuyan Island to halt the highly-destructive 'development' project.\n\nCajidiocan is located in the north-eastern portion of Sibuyan Island. To its west is the municipality of Magdiwang and to its south is the municipality of San Fernando. To its east lies Sibuyan Sea. It has a total land area of 201.85 km. 60 percent of which is part of the Mount Guiting-Guiting Natural Park, a mountainous protected wildlife area composed of lush tropical rainforest surrounding the Mount Guiting-Guiting, Sibuyan's tallest mountain. It has narrow strips of flat land along the coast where much of the population is concentrated.\n\nCajidiocan is politically subdivided into 14 barangays.\nThe locals speak a variant of the Romblomanon language, locally called \"Sibuyanon\" (Sibuyanon Cajidiocanon style).\n\nPursuant to Chapter II, Title II, Book III of Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991, the municipal government is composed of a mayor (alkalde), a vice mayor (bise alkalde) and members (kagawad) of the legislative branch Sangguniang Bayan alongside a secretary to the said legislature, all of which are elected to a three-year term and are eligible to run for three consecutive terms.\n\nThe incumbent mayor and vice mayor of Cajidiocan are Nicasio M. Ramos from the Nacionalista Party and Kenyo \"Ken\" R. Rabino frpm the PDP-Laban party.\n\nBecause of the abundance of palm trees in its coastal plains and its proximity to the sea, copra farming and fishing are the main sources of livelihood in Cajidiocan. Other livelihood and investment opportunities include agri-business, fish culture and processing, marble mining and processing, cut flower cultivation, cottage industries, garment manufacturing, banking, and tourism.\n\nThe Romblon Electric Cooperative (ROMELCO) facilitates the power supply in the entire Sibuyan Island, including Cajidiocan. As for water supply, the town has a potable water system, which comes from jet pumps, open wells, artesian wells, and springs. A water irrigation project is also present in the municipality with 188 service areas. Landline and mobile telephone services are also available through PLDT, Smart Communications, and Globe Telecom.\n\nCajidiocan is connected to its neighboring municipalities by the Sibuyan Circumferential Road. Common forms of transportation are light vehicles, including jeepneys, motorcycles, tricycles, and small trucks.\n\nTo reach Cajidiocan, visitors can take a RORO ferry from Manila or Batangas City to Ambulong Port in Magdiwang. From there, there are jeepneys that can take visitors to Cajidiocan. Another route is by air via Cebu Pacific which operates four flights weekly from Manila to Tugdan Airport in Alcantara, Romblon. From Alcantara, visitors can travel by jeepney to San Agustin, Romblon, where motorized boats can bring them to Ambulong Port.\n\nCajidiocan has a lot of eco-tourism potential due to its lush natural environment and pristine rivers and falls.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nConcepcion started as a small village founded in 1570 by the Spanish colonization forces led by Martin de Goiti and Juan de Salcedo, upon orders from then Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi. The village was named after the Immaculate Concepcion. Throughout the Spanish era, the village was administered as part of Banton municipality on nearby Banton Island.\n\nOn 2 July 1907, during the American colonization of the Philippines, Concepcion was elevated to municipal status but was incorporated as part of Mindoro province after Romblon was abolished and incorporated as part of Capiz province. However, on 10 March 1917, Romblon was reinstated as a separate province, and thus, Concepcion was incorporated back to the province.\n\nOn 8 June 1940, the special municipality of Maghali was established upon passage of Commonwealth Act No. 581 (authored by Congressman Leonardo Festin). This demoted Concepcion and Corcuera from their municipality status and incorporated into the new municipality with its capital in Banton. The special municipality was abolished through the passage of Republic Act No. 38 (authored by Congressman Modesto Formilleza), and by 1 October 1946, Concepcion regained its municipal status which it still holds today.\n\nAmong the islands of Romblon, Concepcion is the farthest from the provincial capital. It is also far from the nearest commercial capital, Odiongan. It takes five hours to travel between Concepcion and Romblon thus making it difficult for provincial executives to visit the island municipality. The nearest municipality from Concepcion is Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro, which is only two hours by boat. Hence, most Sibalenhons buy and sell their products in this town instead of Odiongan or Romblon.\n\nIn the past, there have been attempts to secede Concepcion from Romblon and re-annex it to Oriental Mindoro. On 16 March 1924, Act No. 3131 was introduced in Congress seeking to re-annex the municipality to Oriental Mindoro but it didn't push through. More recently, in 2014, town mayor Lemuel Cipriano expressed that \"90% of Concepcion's 4,500 population are seeking to be re-annexed to Oriental Mindoro\". In order to be re-annexed, a resolution calling for a referendum in the island must be filed in Congress by the provincial representative. Oriental Mindoro governor Alfonso Umali Jr. and Second District Congressman Reynaldo Umali have expressed support for a possible referendum.\n\nConcepcion is located on Maestro de Campo Island (also known as Sibale to its inhabitants) which is the westernmost island of the province and approximately off the coast from Mindoro. The island is mountainous with steep shores. Its settlements are dispersed along the coast with the poblacion on the south shore. The island's interior is jagged and forested, with caves, clear rivers, unique rock formations, and hills that offer extensive views. Every village has its own cove and white sand beaches which are used for swimming and scuba diving.\n\nConcepcion is politically subdivided into 9 barangays.\nAccording to the 2015 census, it has a population of 4,037 people. Majority of its inhabitants speak the local dialect, Asi, which is also spoken in the nearby islands of Banton and Simara. Sibalenhons, as the islanders call themselves, are predominantly Roman Catholic with a small percentage of Protestants, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Iglesia ni Cristo.\n\nPursuant to Chapter II, Title II, Book III of Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991, the municipal government is composed of a mayor (alkalde), a vice vayor (bise alkalde) and members (kagawad) of the legislative branch Sangguniang Bayan alongside a secretary to the said legislature, all of which are elected to a three-year term and are eligible to run for three consecutive terms. As of 30 June 2019, Concepcion's incumbent mayor is Medrito \"Jun\" Fabreag, Jr. while his vice mayor is Monico \"Nonoy\" Firmalan, Jr. Both are from the PDP-Laban political party.\n\nThe barangays or villages, meanwhile, are headed by elected officials, the topmost being the \"Punong Barangay\" or the Barangay Chairperson (addressed as \"Kapitan\"; also known as the Barangay Captain).

The beaches have diving spots. Tropical coral reef systems surround the island. Some old folk believe they share the forest and coves with enchanted beings.\n\nEach of the island's nine barangays has its own cove with a palm-fringed white sand beach front. The entire island is visited for its swimming and scuba diving. Notable beaches include those along Tongo point and the beaches between barangay (village) Bachawan and Sampong. The island's interior hills, stretching five to nine kilometer, have trails for hiking and climbing. The island hills are also commonly visited by motor-cross biking enthusiasts.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nLocated on Simara Island, it is named after the Spanish governor-general Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera who ruled the Philippines from 1635 to 1644 on behalf of King Philip IV of Spain.\n\nThe island’s name, Simara, was derived from the local word \"sima\", meaning \"hook\", which refers to how the island looks like. Corcuera was originally established as \"San Jose\" by the Spanish in 1574. In 1621, Augustinian Recollect missionaries arrived in the island and converted the locals into Christianity. By 1726, a stone church dedicated to Saint Joseph was built through the initiative of Fr. Agustin de San Pedro, also known as \"El Padre Capitan\". He also ordered the construction of a watchtower in Tacasan, which would serve as a lookout and warning for the locals of impending Muslim raids that plagued the province at that time.\n\nThe first Justice of Peace was Liborio Fabiala. He was appointed on 1 August 1901. The year American Civil Government started in the province and the whole country. In 1910, during the American colonization period, the town was visited by the American survey ship \"Fathomer\" which conducted hydrographic surveys and depth sounding in the waters around Simara Island. Its American crew also constructed a lighthouse which is still standing today. At that time, Corcuera was still administered as part of Banton municipality on nearby Banton Island. In January 1931, Corcuera was granted local autonomous government by virtue of Chief Executive Order No. 292, Series of 1930 initiated by then Governor Manuel T. Albero. Corcuera then became the third island municipality in the province. The inauguration of Corcuera as a maiden municipality was held on February 3, 1931.\n\nDuring World War II, the Japanese established a garrison at Tanro-aw Hill in the island. On March 10, 1945, American and Filipino soldiers who were liberating the Philippines from Japanese occupation launched a task force from Mindoro to liberate the islands of Romblon and Simara. On March 12, elements from Companies B and C of the 19th Infantry, 24th Division of the US 8th Army landed in Simara led by 1st Lt. David B. Bernard. They were assisted by the USS Haas, skippered by Lt. Cmdr. A. M. White.\n\nAfter four days of mortar and naval bombardment and heavy fighting, the Americans were able to subdue the Japanese in Tanro-aw and liberate the island. The fighting left 118 Japanese, 10 Americans, and one Filipino dead.\n\n\"As separate district from Capiz*\"<br>\"As fully pledged politico-military province**\"<br>\"Province established by US civilian government***\"\n\nCorcuera has a total land area of 23.40 km.

The incumbent mayor and vice mayor as of 30 June 2019 are Elmer M. Fruelda and Aubrey \"Apple\" Fondevilla respectively, both from the Nacionalista Party. \n\nCorcuera has a primarily agricultural economy, with rice and copra farming, as well as fishing, as the main sources of livelihood. There is also an indigenous raffia palm handicraft industry. Other crops grown in the island are root crops (such as cassava, sweet potatoes), fruits and vegetables.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nCalatrava, once a barrio in the town of San Agustin (then called \"Badajoz\") in Tablas Island. During pre-Spanish period, the place was called \"\"Andagao\"\", named after a medicinal plant growing in abundance everywhere in the locality especially in places along the shore.\n\nAround 1810, the first settlers in Andagao migrated from Banton and Romblon islands, as well as in central parts of Tablas Island, in search of lands more suitable for agriculture. The Simaranhons, Sibalenhons and Bantoanons were the first settlers of the municipality and joined later by migrants from Odiongan of which, like them, spoke Asi. Today, this group of people made up the great portion of its residents, while the northern barangays of Linao, Pangulo and Talisay have significant Romblomanon residents. Onhan settlers originally from central Tablas decided to settle in the southern barangay of Balogo.\n\nAround 1838, Andagao was organized into a \"fundacion\" (settlement) attached to \"visita\" (village) of Odiongan under the \"pueblo\" of Banton by the Spanish colonial authorities. The following year, a Spanish friar named Padre Jose Aznar from the parish of Banton visited the place and planned the construction of its first Roman Catholic church made of wood and limestone. Eleuterio Asuncion, the barrio's \"cabeza de barangay\" spearheaded its construction. After the church was completed, Andagao immediately progressed and developed. In 1850, people started using family names beginning with letter \"F\" as decreed by Spanish Governor-General Narciso Claveria issued on 21 November 1848.\n\nIn 1853, after the creation of the District of Romblon, 17 new towns were created which included Andagao. This was Calatrava’s first proclamation as a municipality. However, when the District of Romblon was elevated into a full-pledge province a total of 15 towns were abolished, including Andagao. On 11 January 1868, Romblon became a fully pledged province and Andagao reverted to its former status as a visita and it was annexed to the town of Guintiguian (renamed Badajoz on August 28, 1868, now San Agustin).\n\nOn 14 June 1881, Andagao was renamed Calatrava during the term of the controversial military governor of Romblon, Don Jose Fernandez de Terran (1880–1883), after the Military Order of Calatrava, which was founded by the Cistercian monk St. Raymond of Fitero and tasked to defend the castle of Calatrava and other crucial towns and cities in the Andalucian region from invasions and attacks from the Moors.\n\nCalatrava remained part of Badajoz municipality throughout the American colonial period until 4 June 1940, when Commonwealth Act No. 581 (authored by Congressman Leonardo Festin) was passed and created the special municipality of Tablas, with its seat at Odiongan. The town of Badajoz became part of the new municipality and was represented with one special municipal councilor at the municipal council in Odiongan. Calatrava, being a barrio of Badajoz then, was not represented. On 4 June 1943, during the Second World War, the special municipality of Calatrava was created upon the sponsorship of the guerrilla movement regime under the Revolutionary Republic of the Philippines. Its first and only mayor then was Benito Famini, Sr. who served up to the liberation period. This was Calatrava's second proclamation as a municipality.\n\nOn 1 October 1946 Commonwealth Act No. 581 was repealed through the passage of Republic Act No. 38 sponsored by Congressman Modesto Formilleza. Badajoz regained back its independent municipal status and Calatrava was annexed back to Badajoz municipality as a barrio. The same year, a three-man delegation composed of Pablo Fetalino, Lauriano Falcutila, Sr. and Jose Capa from Calatrava went to Manila to lobby for a bill in Congress that will establish Calatrava as an independent municipality but it didn't push through.\n\nOn 15 June 1968, through the sponsorship Congressman Jose Moreno, Republic Act No. 5317 was drafted and approved which finally established Calatrava as an independent municipality. Thus Calatrava became Romblon's 15th independent constituency under the category of municipal-district. This was Calatrava's third proclamation as a municipality.\n\nCalatrava is situated along the northern coastal plains and rugged terrain of Tablas Island. It is bounded on the north by Tablas Strait, on the east by municipality of San Agustin, on the south and west by the municipality of San Andres. The municipality has a total land area of constituting 6.39% of Romblon's land area.\n\nAccording to the 2015 census, Calatrava has a population of 10,275 people.

The Spanish noted the resemblance of the bay in the vicinity to the bay of Ferrol, Spain, which is the home port of Spain's Maritime Department of the North, hence the town's name.\n\nIn 1978, in order to consolidate the Onhan-speaking barangays of Odiongan into one municipality, Assemblyman Nemesio Ganan Jr. authored a bill in the Congress of the Philippines which created Ferrol, together with the barangays of Agnocnoc, Bunsoran, Hinagoman, Tubigon, and Claro M.

The first settlers of Looc where Onhan-speaking tribes from Panay Island which came around 1730. The settlement was originally a barrio of the \"pueblo\" (town) of Cabolutan (located in present-day San Agustin) until 1790, when the town's population was wiped-out by a smallpox epidemic and the town was abolished. The abolition transferred Looc under the administration of pueblo de Banton in Banton Island.\n\nIn the early 1800s, the settlement continued to progress and increase its population. Thus, in 1844, Spanish colonial authorities converted Looc into a full-pledged pueblo. Back then, Looc was still part of Capiz province, until 19 March 1853, when Romblon was officially declared a district separate from Capiz, and finally a full-pledged province in 1868. Looc was one of the first four municipalities of the newly created province of Romblon, the other three being Romblon (capitol), Banton, and Sibuyan (Cajidiocan). It then comprised the territories of what is now the municipalities of Alcantara and Santa Fe, and Carabao Island. Looc would lose these territories during the American colonial period beginning in 1901.\n\nOn 8 June 1940, the municipality was abolished by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 581, also known as the \"Festin Bill\" (authored by Congressman Leonardo Festin). Looc was then consolidated into the special municipality of Tablas together with all other municipalities in the island and demoted to a barrio with a representative in the town's capitol in Odiongan. During the Japanese Occupation of the Philippines, the town became one of several emergency municipalities sponsored by the guerilla movement in the province. On 1 October 1946, Commonwealth Act No. 581 was repealed by Republic Act No. 38 (authored by Congressman Modesto Formilleza), thus abolishing the special municipality of Tablas and restoring Looc to its municipal status.\n\nOn 21 March 1961, the municipality of Alcantara was created from the eastern barangays of Looc, reducing the municipality to its present size.

The local government, together with the community through their Barangay Fishermen Organization and Looc Baywatch Task Force, worked together to ensure the safety of the Looc's marine resources. The marine sanctuary was awarded two Trailblazing Galing Pook awards in 2000 and 2007 by the Galing Pook Foundation for being the best Coastal Resource Management program.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nFormerly known as Naylog and Magallanes, it is one of three municipalities in Sibuyan Island, which has been dubbed as the \"Galapagos of Asia\" due to its pristine natural environment and high endemism rate for flora and fauna.\n\nBased on civil and church records from 1820, Magdiwang was founded as Fundacion de Naylog, a settlement established in the northern coast of Sibuyan Island by religious missionaries led by Don Valentin Ayala. It was placed under the jurisdiction of \"Pueblo de Sibuyan\", whose seat was located in Cajidiocan town. In 1855, the settlement was one of 17 new pueblos (towns) added to the four already existing in the province and was renamed Magallanes, in honor of Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan.\n\nSix years later, on 21 February 1861, another pueblo, \"Rancheria de Infiel\", was organized close to Magallanes, located in the upstream of the present poblacion in what is now Barangay Dulangan. This new pueblo was established for the sake of the relocated \"Mangyanes\" or May-as tribe, who used to live in the mountains, so that missionary works and Christianizing efforts conducted in the lowland villages will be extended to them as well. This pueblo was incorporated later on, during the American occupation, as part of Magdiwang.\n\nThirteen years later, on 11 January 1868, when Romblon was converted into a province, Magallanes was demoted to a missionary center from its former status as pueblo by the first governor of the Romblon, Don Joaquin Corillo.\n\nCivil government in Romblon was established under the Americans on 16 March 1901. Magallanes was one of 11 new municipalities. In 1917, due to reorganization and the province's difficult financial status as a newly restored entity, the former municipality of Magallanes was abolished and annexed to Cajidiocan. It was only restored to its independent municipality status on 1 March 1933, with the new name Magdiwang, in honor of the Magdiwang faction of the Philippine revolutionary group, Katipunan. It was inaugurated through festivities which lasted from 24 to 25 March 1933 and led by Governor Manuel T. Alvero.\n\nOn 8 June 1940, the special municipality of Sibuyan was established through the passage of Commonwealth Act No. 581, sponsored by Congressman Leonardo Festin. Magdiwang was abolished and was annexed to the new municipality with its seat at Cajidiocan town proper. The special municipality of Sibuyan was abolished through the passage of Republic Act No. 38, which was authored by Congressman Modesto Formelleza and took effect on 1 October 1946, when President Manuel Roxas signed the Republic Act no. 38, restoring Magdiwang as a municipality.\n\nIn February 2018, the government planned the construction of a road that would go through Mt. Guiting-guiting Natural Park Protected Area, effectively endangering thousands of Sibuyan Island pristine forests that have never been touched by man. An online campaign against the road construction was launched afterwards, urging the President, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the Department of Public Work and Highways, the Mt. Guiting-guiting Natural Park Protected Area Management Board, and the LGUs of Sibuyan Island to halt the highly-destructive 'development' project.\n\nMagdiwang is one of three municipalities in Sibuyan Island, the second largest among the islands of Romblon.

According to the Office of the Provincial Agriculturist, the municipality has the highest agricultural production in the province. Other potential economic activities include fish culture and processing, cut flower industries, cottage industries, garment manufacturing, banking, and tourism.\n\nElectricity in Magdiwang is provided by the Romblon Electric Cooperative. As for water supply, the town as 5 community irrigation projects that have service area of 188 hectares. Potable water is mostly supplied through jet pumps, artesian wells, deep wells, and springs. Cellular communication is made possible through companies like PLDT, Smart Communications, and Globe Telecom.\n\nAmbulong Port in Magdiwang is the port of entry to Sibuyan Island. There are weekly RORO and motorized boat trips to the municipality from Manila, Lucena, Quezon, and San Agustin, Romblon. The municipality is connected to its neighboring towns via the Sibuyan Circumferential Road. Public utility jeepneys (PUJ), pedicabs, tricycles, and motorcycles are the common form of public transportation in the area.\n\nBecause of its preserved natural environment, Magdiwang is touted as a prime eco-tourism destination.

This was followed shortly by Onhan-speaking settlers from Panay. Around 1810, a group of Bantoanon-speaking people settled in the area in search of a place more suitable for agriculture. However, the settlement founded by these Bantoanons were destroyed and pillaged by Muslim pirates. In 1840, another attempt was made by a different group of Bantoanons; this time, they constructed a fort or \"cota\" which protected the settlement from attacks and natural calamities. In 1855, the settlement was officially designated by the Spanish colonial authorities as a \"pueblo\" or town. When the Philippine Revolution broke out in 1896, the town joined the cause of the revolutionaries led by Tomas Fiedacan.\n\nDuring the American colonial period in the Philippines, Odiongan faced a number of catastrophes: a cholera epidemic in 1902 killed much of the town's population, a strong typhoon lashed the town in 1908, and famine struck the town in 1914. However, the perseverance and determination of the townsfolk led to the town's continuous existence.\n\nIn 1940, the town became the seat of the special municipality of Tablas, created by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 581 (authored by Congressman Leonardo Festin), which covered the entire island. It remained so throughout the Japanese occupation of the Philippines from 1941-1945. During that time, Odiongan was chosen as the headquarters of the resistance movement in the province, under the leadership of Lt. Col. Enrique Jurado. On 4 September 1943, a Japanese gunboat shelled the town to force the guerrillas out of hiding. This was followed the following month by a landing of Japanese forces from Panay, which massacred people in the various towns of Tablas, Romblon, and Sibuyan, including Odiongan.\n\nOn 1 October 1946, the special municipality of Tablas was abolished by Republic Act No. 38. The following year, Odiongan was restored to its original jurisdiction as municipality in the province of Romblon.\n\nOdiongan is located in the mid-western part of Tablas Island.

As the capital of the province, it is also the seat of the Provincial Government. Its natives mostly speak Romblomanon or \"Ini\" language.\n\nRomblon is known for its local marble industry and is the second biggest producer of the mineral in the country. It is also increasingly become known as a tourist destination because of its unspoiled beaches and Spanish-era twin forts.\n\nThe first inhabitants of Romblon were Negritos tribes of Panay and Mindoro Mangyan tribes. The discovery of hanging coffins and artistic material in caves of the island of Banton demonstrates the existence of a rich and ancient civilization and Aboriginal culture.\n\nThe islands were first visited by Spanish conquistador Martin de Goiti in late 1569, and were thereafter organized by the Spanish into \"encomiendas\". The encomienda of Donblon (Romblon), established on April 24, 1571, was granted to Don Gonzalo Riquel. In the first census done by Spanish navigator Miguel de Loarca in 1582, Romblon Island was shown to have 240 residents engaged in wax gathering. At this time, Miguel de Loarca recorded the island's name as \"Lomlon\" or \"Doblon\". In the local Visayan dialect, the word means a bird warming an egg in its nest. It was also known as Domblon before the present name was adopted.\n\nIn 1631, during the term of Spanish Governor-General Juan Niño de Tabora, Romblon was established as a pueblo, making it one of the two oldest settlements in the province, the other being Banton located in the north of the province. In 1635, the island of Romblon was evangelized by Spanish Recollect fathers and became a dependency of the Captaincy General of the Philippines. Their fortified church is the present cathedral of Romblon. It received its first Spanish missionaries in the 17th century. During the 17th and 18th centuries, it was often ravaged by Moros. Two forts were erected by them, San Andrés and Santiago.\n\nIt was organized into a \"Comandancia\" (a province or district under military control) by the Spanish in 1853.\n\nIn 1901, the American occupation saw the establishment of a civilian government in the town. Ten new barrios were created while three existing barrios were also abolished. These include Aglomiom which was merged to Sablayan due to its small population, Embarcacion which was attached again to El Pueblo or Poblacion and the inland barrio of Cogon which was reorganized and split into five barrios of Tambac, Ilauran, Macalas, Lamao, and Agbaluto (referred collectively as TIMLA, from its initial letters) while barrio Alfonso XIII was renamed Li-o.\n\nThe 10 additional barrios were Bagacay, Agbudia, Agtongo, Embarcacion, Maria Cristina (renamed as Sawang) and the five new TIMLA barrios. These barrios aside from TIMLA were Agtongo which was created into a separate barrio in 1916 taken from Cajimos while in 1918 those engaged in maritime industry which were designated separately as distinct barrio known as Embarcacion was annexed again to barrio Poblacion or El Pueblo in 1939. Agbudia was the last barrio to be created taken from Guimpingan in 1939. Meanwhile, the two barrios Majabangbaybay and Sogod, located in Tablas island, were returned to Badajoz (now San Agustin), abolished as independent barrios and attached as sitios of barrio Guinpuc-an (Carmen) in 1901.\n\nDuring World War II, an American force landed in the island on March 11, 1945 and liberated it from the occupying Japanese forces. By March 18, the entire province was liberated from the Japanese. A located near the beach in Sawang commemorates this event.\n\nIn 1960, the island barrio of Nagoso was renamed Cobrador while in 1975, the urban barangay of Poblacion was split into four separate barangays, named simply as Barangays 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nOn March 25, 2018, the Sandiganbayan, a special appellate collegial court that tries graft and corruption cases, affirmed its ruling sentencing Romblon mayor Mariano Mateo, former mayor Leo Merida and eight other former local officials to 10 years in prison. The ruling was in connection with in connection with the alleged anomalous procurement of a heavy equipment. The case, which was filed in 2010, stemmed from the municipal government’s purchase of a backhoe amounting to P13.95 million in November 2005 without public bidding. At the time, Merida was mayor and Mateo was councilor. The court said witnesses testified that the backhoe was not used for the purpose for which it was purchased.\n\nThe municipality consists primarily of Romblon Island, as well as the smaller Alad, Cobrador, and Logbon Islands.

Marble is the most significant mineral deposit of Romblon and is the most renowned product of the province. The province is the second biggest provincial marble producer of the country next to Bulacan. Romblon marble is of very high quality and comes in shades of white, green, pink, red and black. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau has estimated that Romblon is endowed with about 150 million metric tons of marble. At current rates of extraction, the supply may last for three more centuries. Tablas Island is also believed to have vast reserves of marble.\n\nMarble quarrying and processing are major activities in Romblon. Among the most common marble products are categorized into the following: novelty items (gifts, ashtray, table bars), furniture (dining tables, baptismal fonts) and construction materials (tiles, balusters, marble chips). Aside from marble quarrying and processing, tourism, fishing and coconut farming are also basic livelihood sources in the island.\n\nThe main transportation link to Romblon is through RORO vessels. Currently, there are RORO vessels from Montenegro Lines, 2GO Travel, Navios Shipping Lines and Starhorse Shipping that dock in the town weekly from the port of Batangas and Lucena.

During the pre-Spanish era, it was a native settlement of nipa huts known as Parpagoja, named after a rare large bird that had its nest among the thicket along the river where settlement was located. Among the first Spaniards to reach Parpagoha during the later half of the 19th century was Don Jose de Tiran, a military commander of Romblon who set out an inspection trip of the surrounding villages. On reaching the place he ordered a civil guard to fetch a glass of water from nearby well. The water turned out to be salty and the Spaniard yelled \"\"salado!\"\", issuing an official order to that effect. Thus, Parpagoha came to be known as Salado.\n\nIn 1882, a prominent resident of Salado named Rufino Leaño was accused of a crime by an influential Spaniard, Don Barcelo. He succeeded in having Leaño imprisoned without trial in the provincial jail of Capiz, to which Romblon then belonged to as a sub-province. Years later, the Spanish Governor-General Eulogio Despujol (1891-1893) visited Capiz, and Leaño successfully sought an audience with him. Governor Despujol found Leaño innocent and set him free. On reaching his hometown, he successfully petitioned the provincial governor to change the name of Salado to Despujols in honor of the Governor-General.\n\nOn 18 June 1961, during the late years of President Carlos P. Garcia's administration, the fourth change of name for the town came through the enactment of Republic Act No. 3358.

Negrito and Mangyan tribes from Panay and Mindoro were the first inhabitants, as well as migrants from island of Romblon, and southern Tablas.\n\nIn the early part of Spanish conquest, the first settlement was at barangay Cabolutan. The early settlers found it very tiring at times to cross the channel to Romblon town to attend to civil and religious duties. To solve this problem, Cabolutan leaders discussed the matter such as building a visita in their settlement of around 250 souls. Finally in 1635, the first church building made of coral stone and lime was started.\n\nIn 1700, Spanish authorities decided to separate Cabolutan in Tablas Island from Romblon, with its seat at visita Cabolutan subjugating all settlements west of Tablas Island. The new pueblo or town of Cabolutan progressed slowly and grew more populous despite frequent Moro kidnapping raids. However, in 1790, a smallpox epidemic almost wiped out the town's entire population. The heavy casualty toll caused the pueblo's abolition which led to re- incorporation to Romblon until 1855, when another pueblo named Guintigui-an was founded some 4 kilometers south of the old town site. The town was founded by Don Laureano Montesa together with his brother Don Esteban and cousin Don Luis Montesa, who became Tiniente Absoluto in Romblon. Its jurisdiction included what is now the towns of Calatrava and Santa Maria. The construction of the Cotta (fort) at Payong-Payong hill (located in present-day barangay Cagbo-aya), started in 1873. Cotta protected the community from Muslim pirates and still stands today. In 1868, the town was renamed \"Badajoz\" by Andres Lebarde, a visiting Spanish soldier, after his native city of Badajoz, Spain.\n\nOn 20 June 1957, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1660, Badajoz Town was changed to San Agustin. after the town's patron saint.\n\nSan Agustin is in the north-eastern part of Tablas Island with a total land area of .

Its municipal port serves as the eastern gateway to the main island of Tablas, as well as to the neighboring islands of the province.\n\nA mountain range shields the town from southeasterly monsoon but is completely exposed to north-easterly typhoons. San Agustin has the second highest mountain in the province, the volcano-shaped Mount Payaopao at 2,182 feet (665 m) high, overlooking Carmen Bay.\n\nSan Agustin is politically subdivided into 15 barangays:\nAccording to the 2015 census, San Agustin has a population of 22,598 people.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is also known as Carabao Island, or Hambil Island, the southernmost island of the province. \n\nThroughout much of its Spanish and American colonial history, the island and its inhabitants repeatedly changed hands between the political jurisdictions of Romblon and Capiz provinces, before becoming a separate municipality of Romblon in 1969. Majority of the town's inhabitants speak Onhan, a Western Visayan language also spoken in some parts of Aklan in Panay Island. San Jose is located near the resort island of Boracay.\n\nThe original settlers of the island were the Aetas, locally known as \"Ati\" or \"Ita\" who were believed to have descended from Orang Asli, the aboriginal people of the Malay Peninsula in mainland Asia. The aborigines came to the Philippines during the Paleolithic period by way of land bridges that connected the archipelago to mainland Asia. The Aetas settled in different parts of Panay Island and on the southern portion of Tablas Island, including Carabao Island where San Jose is located.\n\nAccording to Spanish explorer Miguel de Loarca’s \"Relacion de las Islas Filipinas\", Carabao Island was originally called “Hambil”. The Spanish arrived at Hambil Island in 1570, led by conquistador and explorer Martin de Goiti on orders from Miguel López de Legazpi. With an expedition composed of 27 ships, 280 Spaniards and several hundred Visayan followers, Goiti and his team conquered the chief settlement of Agcogon and explored the island. He noted that there were around 50 natives living in the settlement, who made a living from mining copper in the island.\n\nOn 2 November 1571, the islands of Romblon, including Hambil Island were organized into an encomienda and administered from the \"alcaldia\" or province of Panay by Don Alvaro de Angulo, who was appointed steward of the encomienda. In 1582, when Miguel de Loarca visited Hambil Island, he renamed the island to Isla de Carabao or Carabao Island because the island’s shape resembles a water buffalo’s back when seen from the horizon. In 1677, the first Spanish missionary, Fray Pedro Cubero Sebastian, arrived at Carabao Island to convert the natives to Roman Catholicism.\n\nIn 1716, Capiz was created into a separate province out of the old alcaldia of Arevalo, formerly called Panay. The new province included the islands of Romblon and the valley of Aklan in north-western Panay. Carabao Island was placed under the jurisdiction of the \"visita\" of Nabas, Capiz (now part of Aklan). When Looc in Tablas Island was established as a separate pueblo or town from Banton, Romblon in 1844, the administration of Carabao Island and its two existing barrios (villages) of Agcogon and Lanas, was transferred to the new pueblo.\n\nOn 19 March 1853, the Spaniards created the \"Politico-Militar Commandancia del Distrito de Romblon\", a new district of Capiz. It was composed of four pueblos or towns, namely Romblon, Banton, Cajidiocan and Looc and was placed under the command of petty governor Don Ramon Vieytes. Thus, Carabao Island, which was under the jurisdiction of Looc pueblo became part of the newly created District of Romblon.\n\nIn 1855, Romblon petty governor Don Joaquin de Prat ordered the creation of 17 new pueblos or town in Romblon, including pueblo de Cabalian (now part of Santa Fe). The order transferred the administration of Carabao Island and its two villages from Looc to Cabalian. However, pueblo de Cabalian was abolished in 1861, and following the abolition, residents of Carabao Island chose to be annexed back to Nabas, Capiz. On 11 January 1868, the District of Romblon was elevated into a province. A reorganization of the province’s towns was conducted upon orders from governor Don Joaquin Corillo, which included restoration of Cabalian in 1892 into a pueblo, now renamed Santa Fe. In 1897, the residents of Carabao Island voted to rejoin Looc instead of the new pueblo of Santa Fe.\n\nThe Americans arrived and established civilian government in Romblon on 16 March 1901. The new colonizers decided to attach Carabao and its two barrios to Santa Fe. However, with the abolishment of Romblon province on 15 July 1907 due to insufficient income, the province, together with Carabao Island, was incorporated back to Capiz province.\n\nFollowing the restoration of Romblon province on 10 March 1917, Santa Fe was once again abolished and Carabao Island was again re-annexed to Looc. Another change in Romblon's political boundaries happened on 8 June 1940, when Philippine Congress passed Commonwealth Act No. 581 sponsored by Congressman Leonardo Festin, which created the special municipality of Tablas. With the creation of the special municipality, all the previous municipalities in Tablas Island were abolished and incorporated into the new municipality.\n\nAfter World War II, when American civil government was restored, the special municipality of Tablas was abolished on 1 October 1946 by virtue of Republic Act No. 38 sponsored by Congressman Modesto Formelleza. Thus, the Santa Fe municipality was re-established, with Carabao Island under its administration. On 24 April 1959, two new barrios or villages, Busay and Pinamihagan, were created in Carabao Island by virtue of Republic Act No. 2144 authored by Congressman Jose D. Moreno\n\nCarabao Island with its four villages was officially converted into a municipal district of Santa Fe on 18 June 1961 by virtue of Republic Act No. 3423, sponsored by Congressman Moreno. On 18 June 1966, the island municipal district was renamed San Jose by virtue of Republic Act No. 4829. In 1968, a new barrio, Combot, was added to the island, taken from portions of barrio Poblacion and Lanas.\n\nSan Jose was retroactively declared an independent municipality of Romblon on 1 July 1968 by virtue of Executive Order No. 184.\n\nSan Jose is located at Carabao Island off the southern tip of Tablas Island in Romblon province. It is separated from the municipality of Santa Fe in Tablas by the Cabalian Channel. To the south of San Jose are the municipalities of Malay and Nabas in Aklan province, which are on the north-western tip of Panay Island. It is very close to neighboring Boracay Island, a popular tourist destination for Filipinos and foreigners alike. San Jose is separated from Boracay by a narrow body of sea called Hambil Channel.\n\nSan Jose has a total land area of 22.05 square kilometers (8.51 square miles). The island municipality has a diverse geographic profile, with an irregular coastline dotted by white sand beaches that are becoming an alternative tourist destination to neighboring Boracay. Its interior is characterized by undulating hills covered with lush rainforest and coconut trees.\n\nSan Jose is politically subdivided into 5 barangays.\n\n\nAccording to the 2015 census, San Jose has a total population of 10,881. The municipality has a population density of 490 persons per square kilometer. In 2013, San Jose had 6,662 registered voters distributed into 38 precincts, according to the COMELEC.\n\nSan Jose's population is composed mainly of Aeta natives and migrants from Panay who spoke Onhan, also known as Taga-onhan or Inunhan (Hambilanon style), the native language of the inhabitants and one of three major languages in Romblon. Onhan is a variant of the Western Visayan language of Kinaray-a and is thus, spoken not only in Romblon but also in some parts of neighboring Aklan.\n\nMajority of the island's population are Roman Catholic and the Assemblies of God, with a small denomination of Protestants, Seventh-day Adventists, Iglesia ni Cristo, and Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nPursuant to Chapter II, Title II, Book III of Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991, the municipal government is composed of a mayor (\"alkalde\"), a vice mayor (\"bise alkalde\") and eight members (\"kagawad\") of the \"Sangguniang Bayan\" or town council, alongside a secretary to the said council, all of which are elected to a three-year term and are eligible to run for three consecutive terms. San Jose's incumbent mayor and vice mayor as of 30 June 2019 are Ronnie Samson and Egdon Sombilon from LAKAS and NPC, respectively.\n\nThe barangays or villages, meanwhile, are headed by elected officials, the topmost being the \"Punong Barangay\" or the Barangay Chairperson (addressed as \"Kapitan\"; also known as the Barangay Captain). The \"Kapitan\" is aided by the \"Sangguniang Barangay\" (Barangay Council) whose members, called \"Barangay Kagawad\" (Councilors), are also elected.\n\nFishing and tourism are two of the primary economic activities in San Jose. The latter became a popular source of income in recent years following the influx of tourists to neighboring Boracay Island. Several beach resorts were established along the shores of Carabao Island to take advantage of tourist arrivals. Aside from tourism, San Jose residents also engage in livestock raising, copra farming, vegetable and root crop cultivation, and merchant trading with nearby Santa Fe and Odiongan in Tablas Island, and Boracay in Aklan.\n\nAs an island municipality, the only means to reach San Jose is via sea travel. There are several sea routes going to the island. From Manila or Batangas City, there are daily RORO trips going to Odiongan, Romblon or Caticlan in Aklan province. From Odiongan, there are jeepneys that take passengers to Santa Fe, where travellers can take pump boats or \"bancas\" going to San Jose. From Caticlan, there are bancas as well that take passengers to San Jose. The island is approximately a 45-minute boat ride from either Santa Fe or Caticlan. San Jose has a municipal port in Barangay Poblacion where passengers and cargo disembark.\n\nAnother mode of travel is by air. AirAsia, Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines have daily trips to Caticlan Airport from where passengers can take bancas to San Jose. Cebu Pacific also has flights four times week to Tugdan Airport in Alcantara, Romblon, where passengers can take a jeepney to Santa Fe and a boat to San Jose.\n\nSan Jose's five barangays are connected by a circumferential road, where the common mode of transportation are passenger motorcycles, known elsewhere as \"habal-habal\".\n\n"}

On 8 January 1940, by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 581, authored by Romblon congressman Leonardo Festin, the municipality of Looc was abolished and incorporated into a new special municipality called Tablas. Hence, Santa Fe became a barrio of this special municipality.\n\nOn 1 October 1946, by virtue of Republic Act No. 38 authored by Romblon congressman Modesto Formilleza, the special municipality of Tablas was abolished and Looc municipality was reinstated. The law also created Santa Fe into an independent municipality.\n\nSanta Fe is also the home of \"Pinoy Big Brother\" Season 1 big winner Nene Tamayo.\n\nSanta Fe has a total land area of 63.52 km.

Crops like rice, corn, mango, cassava, banana, sweet yam and coconut are raised by farmers. Coconut comprises the largest share of the agricultural area of the municipality and is dominantly grown in all barangays.\n\nNational Power Corporation (NPC) supplies 32.37% (or 836 households) of Santa Fe's households with electricity. The town is serviced by Levels 1, 2 and 3 water supply system. It also has four community irrigation projects with 92 service areas. Potable water is also supplied from water pumps, artesian wells, and rainwater collection reservoirs. PLDT, Smart Communications, and Globe Telecom provides landline and cellular phone service in the municipality.

{"id": "2117828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117828", "title": "Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery", "text": "Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery\n\nAbhayagiri, or Fearless Mountain in the canonical language of Pali, is a Theravadin Buddhist monastery of the Thai Forest Tradition in Redwood Valley, California. Its chief priorities are the teaching of Buddhist ethics, together with traditional concentration and insight meditation (also known as the Noble Eightfold Path), as an effective way of completely uprooting suffering and discontent.\n\nAbout north of Ukiah, the monastery has its origins in the 1980s when the UK-based Ajahn Sumedho, foremost western disciple of the Thai meditation master Ajahn Chah, started getting requests to teach in California. Visits by Ajahn Sumedho, as well as other senior monks and nuns, resulted in the Sanghapala Foundation being set up in 1988. The monastery's first were given to the foundation by the devotees of Chan Master Hsuan Hua, founder of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in Talmage, before he died in 1995. Currently, the monastery rests on of mountainous forest land.\n\nSix months after the monastery was settled by Ajahn Amaro, Ajahn Pasanno arrived to join him as co-abbot. They served together in this role until July, 2010, when Ajahn Amaro departed to take up the invitation to serve as abbot of Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in England. Ajahn Pasanno was the sole abbot of Abhayagiri between July, 2010 and July, 2018.\n\nAbhayagiri Monastery developed significantly under Ajahn Pasanno's and Ajahn Amaro's leadership and guidance, along with the support of the monastic and lay community, and more specifically, the Abhayagiri Building Committee. Over 25 kutis, monastic huts, were built in the mountainous monastery forest during their time as co-abbots as well as when Ajahn Pasanno was the lone abbot. In addition, during the early years, the co-abbots converted both current and new buildings into a Dhamma Hall, kitchen, office spaces, a room for disabled visitors, a laundry room and bathrooms/showers for lay women and men, along with monastery infrastructure and extensive creation of forest paths and roads. \n\nThe co-abbots also contributed to the building of the Bhikkhu Commons, more affectionately know to the residents as the MUB: Monks' Utility Building, a 1600 square foot complex located in the upper forest of the monastery. The MUB offers monks access to bathrooms, showers, a multipurpose meeting room, a large sewing room, a laundry room, a small kitchenette and a large storage room below. The MUB was dedicated and officially opened on July 4, 2010. \n\nAfter Ajahn Amaro's departure to England in July, 2010 building a new Reception Hall was the next major undertaking of Ajahn Pasanno and the Abhayagiri Community. This took more than three years of planning and 4 years of building and would be a two-story complex with over 3000 square feet of covered outdoor decks and 6000 square feet of internal space. The internal space included a spacious meditation hall, a larger, commercial style kitchen, a library, a food storage room, guest rooms, a child care room, multiple bathrooms, showers for laymen, a laundry room, a small shrine room/reliquary, and a large storage room. Major landscaping was also accomplished. The Reception Hall building broke ground in July, 2013 and ended all construction on June 30, 2018 with the cloister area inauguration.\n\nAlso in 2010, Ajahn Pasanno supported the establishment of the Pacific Hermitage, a branch of Abhayagiri Monastery, founded in the Columbia River Gorge along a forested stretch in White Salmon, Washington. Through Ajahn Pasanno's encouragement, Ajahn Sudanto lead the effort to establish the Pacific Hermitage. Three years after its founding, the hermitage was offered a purchased property on the outskirts of White Salmon where it is presently located. Three monks typically stay in residence at the Hermitage, year round. \n\nThe October 2017 Northern California wildfires threatened Abhayagiri but it survived undamaged.\n\nAt the end of Ajahn Pasanno's tenure as abbot, July 11, 2018, he departed for a year sabbatical leaving the monastery to co-abbots Ajahn Karunadhammo and Ajahn Nyaniko for the foreseeable future. Ajahn Pasanno plans to reside at Abhayagiri after his sabbatical, but will not be taking up the role of abbot when he returns.\n\nAs of July 2018, there were two abbots (co-abbots), a total of 13 fully ordained bhikkhus (Buddhist monks), two samaneras (novices), and 4 anagarikas (postulants) and a long term female monastic resident. Men and women live in separate locations in the monastery following guidelines of formal celibacy. Male residents live in small huts nestled in the forest. Female residents live in a house and a couple of huts on an adjoining property which was separately donated for the purpose of housing women at the monastery. Guest teachers come from forest monasteries in Thailand, England, as well as other countries in Europe and Australia. Visitors come to the monastery regularly for day visits, and can also stay as overnight guests.\nThe daily schedule, in keeping with tradition, is rigorous. Most residents (monastics and lay visitors) rise well before sunrise. Morning puja begins at 5:00 am and lasts an hour and a half. It includes chanting in both Pali and English, as well as an hour of silent meditation. This is followed by a half-hour chore period and a simple oatmeal breakfast. At 7:30 am, there is a meeting where a short Dhamma reflection is given and work assignments for the morning period are announced. A three-hour work period follows this meeting, ending with a meal around 11:00 am, which has to be consumed before midday. All lay residents follow the 8 precepts which include not eating food after noon until dawn the next day. Around 1:00 pm, after the post-meal cleanup, the schedule is open for individual practice of sitting and walking meditation as well as Dhamma study. It is at this time that monks, in addition to their meditation and study practice, care for their personal requisites like the huts they live in and the robes they wear. One can also walk around the extensive network of trails that wind about the mountainside. At 5:30 pm, tea is served in the kitchen and on most days one of the Ajahns is available in the Dhamma Hall for questions and answers. Tea time is followed by the evening puja beginning at 7:00 pm, which includes chanting in Pali and another hour of silent meditation. Formal Dhamma talks are offered on Sunday afternoons and lunar observance days during evening puja just after the period for silent meditation. On lunar observance days, which mark the four moon quarters, sitting and walking meditation continue until 3:00 am the next morning, followed by a morning puja.\n\nSpecial lunar observance days at Abhayagiri include Asalha Puja, which commemorates the first teaching given by the Buddha after he attained enlightenment and the first time another being attained stream-entry as a result of the Buddha’s teaching. The next day is the beginning of vassa (), the three-month Rains Retreat where monks are required to stay at a single residence for the duration of this time (they can leave for 6 days at time under specific circumstances). Vassa is followed by Kathina, a festival in which the laity expresses gratitude to monks and offers to the monastic community gifts of cloth and supplies that will be useful for the coming year. The cloth is then cut, sewn and dyed by the monks to make a robe on that day to offer to one of the Saṅgha. Other days that the monastic community at Abhayagiri sets aside each year for special commemoration include Ajahn Chah’s birthday (June 17), Vesakha Puja (usually the first full moon of May), and Magha Puja (usually on a full moon in late February/ early March).\n\nAbhayagiri offers a variety of programs and teachings throughout the year. The Upāsikā Program was created for laypeople in order to assist individual practice, enhance spiritual training, and deepen both the intellectual and experiential understanding of Dhamma. Upāsikā Days are held throughout the year at the monastery and are open both to those who have made a formal commitment to the program and to those who may simply wish to attend for the day. Each year’s commitment ceremony takes place in the spring. There is a different theme for the teachings that are offered on each Upāsikā Day. \n\nMembers of the Abhayagiri Saṅgha regularly travel from Abhayagiri throughout the year to offer teachings in the immediate area and other parts of the country. Once a month, they offer teachings at Yoga Mendocino (Ukiah, California), at the Three Jewels Meditation Hall (Fort Bragg, California), and at Berkeley Buddhist Monastery, and they offer teachings at least once throughout the year at Portland Friends of the Dhamma (Oregon), Spirit Rock Meditation Center, Insight Santa Cruz, and the Common Ground Meditation Center (Minneapolis, Minnesota).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117829", "title": "Help! (magazine)", "text": "Help! (magazine)\n\nHelp! is an American satire magazine that was published by James Warren from 1960 to 1965. It was Harvey Kurtzman's longest-running magazine project after leaving \"Mad\" and EC Publications, and during its five years of operation it was chronically underfunded, yet innovative.\n\nIn starting \"Help!\", Kurtzman brought along several artists from his \"Mad\" collaborations, including Will Elder, Jack Davis, John Severin and Al Jaffee.\n\nKurtzman's assistants included Charles Alverson, Terry Gilliam and Gloria Steinem; the last was helpful in gathering the celebrity comedians who appeared on the covers and the fumetti strips the magazine ran along with more traditional comics and text pieces. Among the then little-known performers in the fumetti were John Cleese, Woody Allen and Milt Kamen; better-known performers such as Orson Bean were also known to participate. Some of the fumetti were scripted by Bernard Shir-Cliff.\n\nAt \"Help!\", Gilliam met Cleese for the first time, resulting in their collaboration years later on \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\". Cleese appeared in a Gilliam fumetto written by David Crossley, \"Christopher's Punctured Romance\". The tale concerns a man who is shocked to learn that his daughter's new \"Barbee\" doll has \"titties\"; however, he falls in love with the doll and has an affair. Gilliam appeared on two covers of \"Help!\" and along with the rest of the creative team, appeared in crowd scenes in several fumetti.\n\nThe magazine introduced young talents who went on to influential careers in underground comix as well as the mainstream: among them Robert Crumb, Gilbert Shelton and Jay Lynch. Algis Budrys and other science fiction writers were regular contributors of prose and scripts to the magazine.\n\nWorking with a minimal budget, Kurtzman relied on a combination of cheap up-and-coming talent, favors called in to \"name\" friends (such as cover poses by Jackie Gleason, Mort Sahl or Jerry Lewis) and inexpensive page-fillers (such as inserting dialogue balloons into news photos and publicity stills).\n\nSomewhat more adult and risque than \"Mad\", \"Help!\" was nonetheless less sexually explicit or taboo-breaking than the contemporaneous \"The Realist\" or the later underground comix and \"National Lampoon\" were or would be. \n\nThe magazine got into some hot water in 1962, thanks to a story in the February 1962 issue called \"Goodman Goes Playboy\" in which the Archie Comics cast were seduced by the \"Playboy\" lifestyle and sold their souls to Satan (aka \"Playboy\" founder Hugh Hefner). Archie Comics sued Warren, and settled out of court for $1,000 and a published apology. The spat resurfaced in December when the story was reprinted in a book; another settlement was reached in 1963 promising never to reprint the story again.\n\nA total of 26 issues were printed before the magazine folded in 1965. Volume one (Aug. 1960–Sept. 1961) had 12 issues, and 14 issues comprised the second volume (Feb. 1962–Sept. 1965).\n\n"}

{"id": "2117849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117849", "title": "Animal Rights Militia", "text": "Animal Rights Militia\n\nThe Animal Rights Militia (ARM) is a banner used by animal rights activists who engage in direct action utilizing a diversity of tactics that ignores the Animal Liberation Front's policy of taking all necessary precautions to avoid harm to human life.\n\nWhen the Animal Rights Militia first emerged in the United Kingdom their focus was on illegal direct action. Utilizing tactics such as the destruction of property, intimidation, and including the use of violence, the ARM have sent letter bombs, placed incendiary devices under cars and in buildings, contaminated food products, sent death threats, and desecrated a grave.\n\nThe name was not heard of for eight years after a series of actions in England from 1982 to 1986. Philosopher Peter Singer wrote in 1986 that the ARM may not really exist. The ARM claimed an arson a year later in California, with a series of arsons, hoax bombs and threats reappearing in the 1990s, notably in the Isle of Wight, Cambridge, North Yorkshire and Oxford. The damage caused by fires averaged £2 million in each location. ARM activists continue to report actions in European countries, North America and Australia. Similar to the ALF, activists send anonymous claims of responsibility to \"Bite Back Magazine\", a website supportive of the animal liberation movement and its prisoners.\n\nThe ARM formed the same leaderless-resistance model as the Animal Liberation Front. A cell may consist of just one person. The existence of activists calling themselves the Animal Rights Militia or Justice Department reflects a struggle within the Animal Liberation Front and the animal rights movement in general, between those who believe violence is justified, and those who insist the movement should reject it in favor of non-violent resistance.\n\nPhilosopher Steven Best has coined the term \"extensional self-defense\" to describe actions carried out in defense of animals by human beings acting as proxy agents. He argues that, in carrying out acts of extensional self-defense, activists have the moral right to engage in acts of sabotage or even violence. Extensional self-defense is justified, he writes, because animals are \"so vulnerable and oppressed they cannot fight back to attack or kill their oppressors.\" He argues that the principle of extensional self-defense mirrors the penal code statutes known as the \"necessity defense,\" which can be invoked when a defendant believes that the illegal act was necessary to avoid imminent and great harm. Best says that \"extensional self defense\" has been put into practice in some African countries, where hired armed soldiers occasionally use lethal force against poachers who would kill rhinos, elephants and other endangered animals. In testimony to the Senate in 2005, Jerry Vlasak stated that he regarded violence against Huntingdon Life Sciences as an example of extensional self-defense.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Animal Rights Militia is believed to be a splinter group of the Animal Liberation Front. The reason ARM was created is that the ALF has a strict no-violence policy towards any living being, whereas this newfound group can use all means necessary to free animals from places of abuse and torture. Since they have been set up, the ARM has caused millions of pounds (and dollars) worth of damage to animal labs, universities and slaughterhouses. Also, ARM have cost companies such as Mars and Lucozade millions of pounds because of false contamination claims, as described later.\n\nSome ministers claim ARM does not actually exist, and is actually a part of the ALF, used to distract the police and intelligence services from itself.\n\nThe first action became known on November 30 when five letter bombs were sent to Margaret Thatcher, then British Prime Minister, the Home Office minister responsible for animal legislation, as well as the leaders of Britain's three main opposition parties, signed by the Animal Rights Militia. The office manager to Thatcher suffered superficial burns on his hands and face when opening the package that burst into flames. It was later reported that the 8-by-4 inch package filled with gunpowder that exploded evaded Post Office scanners, causing a tightening in mail security at 10 Downing Street. Scotland Yard led the investigation stating, \"We are now connecting all five letter-bombs with the same organisation.\"\n\nIn February, four months after the attack against politicians, five more letter bombs were sent to different addresses in London, England, claimed again by the ARM. In an action apparently to protest the annual seal hunt in Newfoundland, Canada, the explosives were delivered to the Canadian High Commission, the then Agriculture minister, a surgeon and a furrier. This time, however, as the padded envelopes were defused, there were no injuries. \n\nIn September, incendiary devices were placed under the cars of two animal researchers for BIBRA (British Industrial Biological Research Association) in South London, which completely wrecked both vehicles. ARM then claimed the contamination of Mars products, claiming it was because of their animal experiments relating to tooth decay which ARM claimed the company had no intention of ending. ARM then claimed the contamination was a hoax and they had not carried out the action. But claimed that it had caused huge financial damage which was the intention.\n\nThree months later in January, ARM claimed responsibility for placing incendiary devices under cars of four individuals involved in animal research at Huntingdon Life Sciences. The explosives were placed in Harrogate, South London, Staffordshire and Sussex, timed to explode an hour apart from each other. This time, also the last time according to the cell, the bomb disposal team were alerted, who deactivated the devices that were confirmed to be live. The next attack the ARM claimed was intended to kill Dr Andor Sebesteny, an animal researcher for the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF). However he noticed the device that was attached under his car which saved his life, since no warning had been given. ARM also claimed responsibility for sending more letter bombs to individuals involved in vivisection.\n\nOn 1 September, at San Jose Valley Veal & Beef, Santa Clara, California, the ARM claims responsibility for an arson which cost $10,000 in damages.\n\nOn 4 January 1992, the \"Edmonton Journal\" reported of an ARM action claimed by a letter and sent to the journal, as well as the Canadian Press. The cell said they injected 87 of the month-old food bar, the Canadian Cold Buster, with liquid oven cleaner, resulting in the product being pulled from shelves in Alberta, Canada. The ARM claimed in the letter, along with two bars, the contamination was due to the slaughter of thousands of rats, injected with various drugs, frozen and starved, \"...because of the decade-and-a-half-long history of animal suffering that is this candy's history.\" The police at the time advised against consuming the food bar, unsure whether the action was genuine. The candy bars sent to the media were later confirmed to have been injected with saline solution (harmless sterilised table salt), proving to be a hoax.\n\nOn 6 July, it was reported widely that the Cambridge store of Boots and also the Edinburgh Woolen Mill in the centre of the city had caught on fire. The Boots branch burnt for four hours completely destroying the building and the wool clothing store was badly damaged with the entire stock ruined. Two more devices were then found, both leather shops, one of which was in the pocket of a sheepskin coat. The ARM claimed all four devices, causing Cambridge city centre to be cordoned off whilst officers searched for two more devices that the cell claimed would explode the following day at 12pm. After an extensive search, it was concluded that the additional two devices claimed were a hoax, with no further devices exploding the following day. A month later, another leather shop was destroyed and the same wool mill suffered minor damage after devices went off, with two more recovered in leather shops and one in a fur shop.\n\nARM then set fire to shops on the Isle of Wight two week later, causing £3 million worth of damage. Initially an incendiary device had been found in a fishing tackle shop as a customer tried on a jacket, accidentally discovering the cigarette packet explosive. The police were called and seized the jacket for forensic tests, alerting all other fishing tackle shops in the island. However four further devices had been planted in Ryde and Newport, with the next one found in Halfords, a subsidiary of Boots, that was detonated in a controlled explosion. The three remaining devices then ignited in the early hours of the morning, setting ablaze two leather shops and an Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) shop, as a hundred firefighters attended to the fires.\n\nThroughout the rest of the year extensive damage continued to occur elsewhere, most notably in the other end of the country in North Yorkshire by the ARM. Boots in Harrogate and Fads, another Boots subsidiary, were set on fire, followed by another ICRF shop and a bloodsports shop. In York, a newly refurbished Boots and Fads were again targeted by arsonists, causing a less but still severe damage to the properties.\n\nOn Christmas Day, the ARM then claimed in writing to two of Vancouver's biggest chains, Save-On Foods and Canada Safeway, that they had injected rat poison into turkeys in supermarkets. Evidence of contamination was not found.\n\nARM further came to widespread public attention in the UK in December, during one of Horne's hunger strikes, which lasted 68 days. It was carried out in protest at the British government's refusal to order a commission of inquiry into animal testing, and ARM threatened to assassinate a number of individuals involved in vivisection should Horne die. Those threatened were Colin Blakemore, later chief executive of the Medical Research Council; Clive Page of King's College London, a professor of pulmonary pharmacology and chair of the animal science group of the British Biosciences Federation; Mark Matfield of the Research Defence Society; and Christopher Brown, the owner of Hillgrove Farm in Oxfordshire, who was breeding kittens for laboratories.\n\nARM claimed responsibility for removing, in October, from a grave the body of Gladys Hammond, the mother-in-law of Christopher Hall, part-owner of Darley Oaks Farm, which bred guinea pigs for Huntingdon Life Sciences, and which had been the target of the animal rights campaign Save the Newchurch Guinea Pigs. The body was removed from a churchyard in Yoxall, Staffordshire, and found buried in woodland on 2 May 2006.\n\nFollowing the announced in August that the Hall family were no longer breeding guinea pigs for medical research, the ARM sent letters to the homes of 17 company directors associated with HLS. Most of the companies targeted were building contractors based in Peterborough, Huntingdon, and Harrogate. A letter from the ARM activists said:\n\nTwo weeks after the letters were sent in late September, nine companies, more than half, severed their ties with HLS.\n\nFour people were convicted on 11 May for their involvement in what \"The Guardian\" called \"a six-year hate campaign\" that included letter bombs, vandalism and grave robbing. The judge described the group's actions as \"subjecting wholly innocent citizens to a campaign of terror.\" The campaign included hate mail signed Animal Rights Militia (ARM) and Animal Liberation Front (ALF). Those convicted were Jon Ablewhite, John Smith and Kerry Whitburn each of whom who were given twelve year sentences and Josephine Mayo who was sentenced to four years.\n\nOn 14 December, the ARM said they had poisoned bottles of POM juice drinks:\n\nA spokesperson for POM replied: \"If it is a hoax, it is a form of blackmail. If actual contamination has taken place, with the intention of injuring innocent people, it is an act of terrorism. Either way, the Animal Rights Militia is trying to scare and intimidate innocent people. That is criminal behaviour.\" It also said that the company conducted a vast amount of research involving human studies and that only a small number of tests were animal based, which did not include dogs, cats or primates. The owners the following month then stated: \"POM Wonderful pomegranate juice has ceased all animal testing, and we have no plans to do so in the future.\" This followed Whole Foods Market, the biggest grocery chain in natural stores, threatening to stop selling their products, initiated by the PETA campaign.\n\nIn October 2007 the ARM again claimed to have contaminated tubes of Savlon with sodium hydroxide, as well as Lypsyl and Lamisil, citing no anti-tampering seal.\n\nOn 30 August, ARM claimed to have deliberately contaminated 250 tubes of Novartis's widely used antiseptic Savlon in shops including Superdrug, Tesco and Boots The Chemist who all withdrew sales of the cream. The cell claimed in a communique to Bite Back:\n\nThe ARM has claimed attacks in Sweden, in what was described in media as a modern wave of crimes against mainly vivisection personnel and fur farm owners. The actions involved the firebombing of a McDonald's restaurant in Gothenburg 2011, bomb threats, letter bombs and vandalism against fur companies and vivisection personnel. There was a wave of ARM-claimed attacks in Sweden during 2011-2012 after the arrest of a young animal rights activist who was sentenced to prison in 2012 for many of the attacks.\n\nPaul Scare was sentenced to one year in prison for sending razor blades to the people who he had targeted.\nBarry Horne was subsequently jailed for eighteen years for the arson attacks. The prosecution successfully argued that the devices used in Bristol and the Isle of Wight were so similar that Horne should be regarded as responsible for both, despite only pleading guilty to an attempted arson in Bristol. Robin Webb, who runs the Animal Liberation Press Office in the UK, narrowly avoided being charged with conspiracy.\n\nNiel Hanson was sentenced to three years for sending the hoax device to GlaxoSmithKline public relations officer in Hertfordshire. He was initially charged with conspiracy to murder, which was then revised to a lesser crime and he was re-sentenced to serve three years, for the device that was a bag of cat litter sent via taxi.\n\n\n\nARM Communiqués\n"}

It lasted from about 174.1 to 163.5 million years ago. Fossils of land-dwelling animals, such as dinosaurs, from the Middle Jurassic are relatively rare, but geological formations containing land animal fossils include the Forest Marble Formation in England, the Kilmaluag Formation in Scotland, the Daohugou Beds in China, the Itat Formation in Russia, and the Isalo III Formation of western Madagascar.\n\nDuring the Middle Jurassic epoch, Pangaea began to separate into Laurasia and Gondwana, and the Atlantic Ocean formed. Eastern Laurasia was tectonically active as the Cimmerian plate continued to collide with Laurasia's southern coast, completely closing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. A subduction zone on the coast of western North America continued to create the Ancestral Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe Middle Jurassic is one of the key periods in the evolution of life on earth. Many groups, including dinosaurs and mammals, diversified during this time.\n\nDuring this time, marine life (including ammonites and bivalves) flourished. Ichthyosaurs, although common, are reduced in diversity; while the top marine predators, the pliosaurs, grew to the size of killer whales and larger (e.g. \"Pliosaurus\", \"Liopleurodon\"). Plesiosaurs became common at this time, and metriorhynchid crocodilians first appeared.\n\nMany of the major groups of dinosaurs emerged during the Middle Jurassic, (including cetiosaurs, brachiosaurs, megalosaurs and primitive ornithopods).\n\nDescendants of the therapsids, the cynodonts, were still flourishing along with the dinosaurs.

He is a former member of the ruling council of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), and former director of Animal Aid. A British court ruled in 2006 that Webb was a \"central and pivotal figure\" in the Animal Liberation Front (ALF).\n\nSince October 1991, Webb has run the British Animal Liberation Press Office, which releases material to the media on behalf of activists operating as the ALF, the Animal Rights Militia (ARM), and the Justice Department. He has said that his policy as press officer is \"never to criticize any action, whatever it may be, so long as it has been undertaken with the sincere intention of furthering animal liberation.\" This has led to criticism that Webb has appeared to condone acts of violence.\n\nWebb has been involved in animal rights advocacy since the 1980s. He told \"No Compromise\" that his interest began when he started a new job at an electronics company located next to a slaughterhouse. Seeing the animals being delivered, and experiencing the smells and sounds, he found himself unable to eat meat. He said, \"I made the connection; the blinds were torn from my eyes ... I couldn't eat a part of what I at last perceived to be an individual with their own feelings and needs.\" He and his partner, Margaret, became vegetarians at first, then three months later, vegans.\n\nRonnie Lee, the founder of the ALF, had acted as the movement's press officer. The press office at that time was part of the Animal Liberation Front Supporters Group (ALFSG), an above-ground organisation with an open membership. In 1991, the ALFSG decided to stop speaking on behalf of the ALF because of constant police attention, and a decision was made to create the role of ALF press officer as a separate office. Webb says he was chosen because he had a respectable image.\n\nThe office's name was changed again to the Animal Liberation Press Office after the introduction of the Terrorism Act 2000, to protect the office from police attention and to reflect that it issues statements on behalf of ARM and the Justice Department, as well as the ALF.\n\nWebb attracted controversy in 1998 during the 68-day hunger strike of British ALF activist Barry Horne, who stopped eating in protest at the British government's failure to hold a public inquiry into animal testing in the UK, something the Labour Party had indicated it would do before coming to power in 1997.\n\nToward the end of the hunger strike, when it appeared that Horne might die, the Animal Rights Militia (ARM), an extremist animal-rights group, issued a statement through Webb, threatening to assassinate six unnamed and four named individuals should Horne die. Shortly after this, footage shot by an independent producer, Graham Hall, was shown on the Channel 4 \"Dispatches\" program in the UK. The production team had secretly filmed Webb holding meetings with Hall, who told Webb he wanted to arrange a bombing. In the footage, Webb appeared to offer advice on how to make a bomb. The footage had been shot before the Animal Rights Militia had issued its threat against the scientists, and there was no suggestion that Webb was himself engaged in violent action. Webb complained that the \"Dispatches\" programme had been selectively edited and his own quotes shown out of context. Channel 4 disagreed.\n\nWebb himself has appeared to link the ALF and the Animal Rights Militia, together with a third animal-rights group known for violence, the Justice Department. In an interview with \"No Compromise\", the animal-liberation magazine, he said that any vegetarian or vegan who carries out an action that falls within the ALF's three stated aims may claim that action on behalf of the ALF. He added: \"And if someone wishes to act as the Animal Rights Militia or the Justice Department? Simply put, the third policy of the ALF [to take every reasonable precaution not to harm or endanger life, either human or non-human] no longer applies.\"\n\nWebb has said that children of animal researchers are legitimate targets of protest. He told the \"Sunday Herald\" in 2004: \"Some say it is morally unacceptable but it is equally unacceptable to use animals in experiments. The children of those scientists are enjoying a lifestyle built on the blood and abuse of innocent animals. Why should they be allowed to close the door on that and sit down and watch TV and enjoy themselves when animals are suffering and dying because of the actions of the family breadwinner? They are a justifiable target for protest.\"\n\nWebb has said that animal liberation protests will escalate. \"There are about 2000 people prepared at any one time to take action for us—more legislation will simply push moderate people to the extremes of the organisation ... When you look at other struggles, there comes a point where non-violent action no longer works. If activists become fed up with non-violent protest then they will take another road and adopt an armed struggle. When you have right on your side, it's easy to keep going. It really is.\"\n\nIn response to a request for an injunction by Oxford University, a British court ruled in October 2006 that Webb was a \"central and pivotal figure\" in the ALF, and that the Animal Liberation Press Office was \"not a neutral reporting exercise or even simply a vehicle for apologists for the ALF, but a vital part of the ALF's strategy.\" The court ruled that Webb is bound by an injunction banning protests at the building site of Oxford's new biomedical research center. Webb had argued that, as a journalist, the injunction would impinge upon his freedom of speech; the court ruled that Webb is not a journalist, but a propagandist.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2117867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117867", "title": "Canton System", "text": "Canton System\n\nThe Canton System (1757–1842) served as a means for China to control trade with the West within its own country by focusing all trade on the southern port of Canton (now Guangzhou). Known in Chinese as the \"Yīkǒu tōngshāng\" (一口通商, \"\"Single [port] trading relations\"\") the policy arose in 1757 as a response to a perceived political and commercial threat from abroad on the part of successive Chinese emperors.\n\nFrom the late seventeenth century onwards, Chinese merchants, known as \"Hongs\" (\"háng\", 行 ), managed all trade in the port. Operating from the Thirteen Factories located on the banks of the Pearl River outside Canton, in 1760, by order of the Qing Qianlong Emperor, they became officially sanctioned as a monopoly known as the \"Cohong\". Thereafter Chinese merchants dealing with foreign trade (known as \"yángháng\" (洋行, literally \"ocean traders\", i.e. \"overseas traders\" or \"foreign traders\") acted through the \"Cohong\" under the supervision of the Guangdong Customs Supervisor (\"Yuèhǎi guānbù jiàn dù\", 粵海關部監督), informally known as the \"Hoppo\", and the Governor-general of Guangzhou and Guangxi.\n\nAt the start of his reign, the Kangxi Emperor (r.16611722) faced a number of challenges, not the least of which was to integrate his relatively new dynasty with the Chinese Han majority. \nThe Manchu-led Qing dynasty had only come to power in 1644, replacing the Ming dynasty. Support for the previous rulers remained strong, particularly in the south of the country. \nKangxi twice banned all maritime trade for strategic reasons, to prevent any possible waterborne coup attempt. Several rebellions took place, including one led by Ming loyalist Koxinga and separately the Rebellion of the Three Feudatories, which led to the capture of Taiwan in 1683. Once the rebellions had been quelled, in 1684 Kangxi issued an edict:\n\"Hǎiguān\" (海关), or customs stations, were subsequently opened at Canton, Xiangshan County (Zhuhai and Zhongshan) and Macau in Guangdong Province; Foochow (Fuzhou), Nantai (Southern Fuzhou) and Amoy (Xiamen) in Fujian Province; Ningpo (Ningbo) and Dinghai County (Dinghai District) in Zhejiang Province; and Huating County (Huating Town, Shanghai), Chongque (No longer exists) and Shanghai proper in Jiangsu Province.\nOne year later in 1685, foreign traders received permission to enter Chinese ports.\n\nThe Qing Court under Kangxi set up a trading company in Canton in 1686 to deal with Western trade known as the \"Yánghuò Háng\" (洋货行, literally \"Ocean Trading House\"). This dealt with both imports and exports with sub-offices responsible for taxes and import/export declarations respectively. When a ship arrived or departed, the Chinese merchant involved would visit the Ocean Trading House to pay any taxes due. This set up became the basis for the later Thirteen Factories through which all foreign trade would be conducted. \n\nAlthough many ports on the coasts of China were open, most Westerners chose to trade at Canton as it is closer to Southeast Asia and it was not profitable to go further north.\n\nIn 1704, the \"Baoshang\" system was established. This system licensed trade with Western merchants: licences were granted to a number of Chinese merchants as long as they helped to collect duties from the Westerners, successfully aligning trading interests with the government's revenue collection. This was the predecessor for the later Cohong system.\n\nAlthough he now had the foreign trade situation under control, Kangxi's liberal attitude towards religion led to a clash between Chinese and Christian spiritual authority. After Pope Clement XI issued his 1715 papal bull \"Ex illa die\", which officially condemned Chinese religious practices, Kangxi expelled all missionaries from China except those employed in a technical or scientific advisory capacity by the Qing Court.\n\nIn 1745, Kangxi's grandson the Qianlong Emperor ordered his court to implement changes to the Ocean Trading House system. Thereafter a local Chinese merchant stood as guarantor for every foreign trading vessel entering Canton Harbour and took full responsibility for the ship and its crew along with the captain and supercargo. Any tax payments due from a foreign trader were also to be guaranteed by the local merchant. With permission from the authorities, in 1760 Hong merchant Pan Zhencheng (潘振成) and nine others \"hong\" specializing in the western trade joined together to become the intermediary between the Qing government and the foreign traders. The role of the new body would be to purchase goods on behalf of the foreigners and deduct any taxes and duties payable for imports and exports; at the same time, according to Guangdong customs records (粤海关志, \"Yuèhǎi guān zhì\"), they established a new harbour authority to deal with tribute from Thailand and handle pay for the troops involved in trade as well as manage domestic maritime trade in the South China Sea. Henceforth, the \"Cohong\" possessed imperial authority to levy taxes on the foreign merchants as they saw fit.\n\nIn 1757 the Qianlong Emperor banned all non-Russian ships from the ports of northern China. Russians were however not allowed to use Canton. All customs offices other than the one at Canton were closed. The emperor did this after receiving a petition regarding the presence of armed Western merchant ships all along the coast. The Western merchant ships were protected from pirates, and guarded against, by the Guangdong Navy, which was subsequently increased in strength.\n\nThereafter all such commerce was to be conducted via a single port under what became known as the Canton System (In Chinese: \"Yī kŏu tōngshāng\" (一口通商 literally, \"Single-port commerce system\"). During Qianlong's reign Qing foreign trade policies had a political aspect largely based on real or imagined threats from abroad; historian Angela Schottenhammer suggests that although the single port trading policy arose in part from lobbying by officials and Chinese merchants, it was more likely triggered by the activities of Flint in what became known as The Flint Affair (\"Hóng Rènhuī Shìjiàn\", 洪任辉事件). Although the foreign merchants knew of the \"Cohong\" restriction, they had to balance a breach of etiquette against the risks of seeing their substantial investments in China destroyed by bribery and corruption. Englishman James Flint, a long-term East India Company supercargo and a fluent speaker of Chinese, became the focus of the impetus for change. Flint had been repeatedly warned to remain in Canton during the trading season and not to venture north in search of commercial opportunities. Despite this, back in 1755 Flint, together with Company director Samuel Harrison, sailed north to explore possibilities for trade in Zhejiang. In 1759, he again journeyed north to file a complaint in Ningbo over corruption amongst the officials in Canton. He had hoped that his criticisms of the current system would usher in a new era of free trade but instead, not only did his plan to open up the ports of Zhejiang fail, the Qing authorities reacted by imposing further restrictions on foreign trade. Worse still, Flint found himself deported to Macau where he was imprisoned between December 1759 and November 1762.\n\nThe emperor and his officials became alarmed at this breach of normal protocol and realized that something had to be done to control the situation. The Qing court's previous laxity had effectively allowed a coterie of Chinese merchants and local officials to take over foreign commerce in the southern port according to their own best financial interests. One of the fundamental tenets of traditional Chinese diplomacy prohibited contact with Beijing except in the case of tributary envoys from other states. \n\nThe new rules, known as the \"Vigilance Towards Foreign Barbarian Regulations\" (Fángfàn wàiyí guītiáo, 防范外夷规条) or \"Five Counter-Measures Against the Barbarians\" (Fáng yí wŭ shì, 防夷五事) contained the following provisions:\n\nThe discovery of underground missionary activity in the late 1750s may have contributed to the Emperor's decision to concentrate foreigners in a single port. In his edict to establish the restriction, the Emperor specifically mentioned concerns about the strategic value of the interior regions to foreigners: Chinese government consultants were aware of Western military technological superiority and Westerners' record of having \"set out to conquer every land they visited\". The Kangxi Emperor, considering the Westerners to be highly successful, intrepid, clever, and profitable, already had concerns early on about the serious omnidirectional Western threat to China, if China ever became weakened.\n\nThe Canton system did not completely affect Chinese trade with the rest of the world as Chinese merchants, with their large three-masted ocean junks, were heavily involved in global trade. By sailing to and from Siam, Indonesia and Philippines, they were major facilitators of the global trading system; the era was even described by Carl Trocki as a \"Chinese century\" of global commerce.\n\nUnder the system, the Qianlong Emperor restricted trade with foreigners on Chinese soil only for licensed Chinese merchants (Cohongs), while the British government on their part issued a monopoly charter for trade only to the British East India Company. This arrangement was not challenged until the 19th century when the idea of free trade was popularised in the West. The concept of restricting trade to a single port was also used in Western countries such as Spain and Portugal. Chinese merchants could also trade freely and legally with Westerners (Spanish and Portuguese) in Xiamen and Macao, or with any country when trade was conducted through ports outside China such as Manila and Batavia. \nAlthough shipping was regulated, the Qianlong emperor's administration was diligent in accommodating the requisites of Western merchants. They hired a growing body of Western assistants for the Customs Office to help manage their fellow countrymen. The order to stay in Macao during the winter was lifted, tax was exempted on food, drink and basic supplies for Western merchants, and protections were granted to Westerners and their property. Chinese merchants were actually banned by Qing law from suing foreigners in Chinese courts, as the Qianlong Emperor believed that good treatment of foreigners was essential for the government. In 1806, Chinese officials compromised with the British on the murder of a Chinese man by British seamen, as Westerners refused to be punished under Chinese law, even though local citizens vigorously protested what they considered a miscarriage of justice. In 1816, the Jiaqing Emperor dismissed a British embassy for their refusal to kowtow, but he sent them an apologetic letter with gifts (the British simply discarded them in a storeroom without reading). The Qianlong Emperor granted Lord Macartney a golden scepter, an important symbol of peace and wealth, but this was dismissed by the British as worthless. The British, on the other hand, ignored Chinese laws and warnings not to deploy military forces in Chinese waters. The British landed troops in Macao despite a Chinese and Portuguese agreement to bar foreign forces from Macao, and then in the War of 1812 attacked American ships deep in the inner harbour of Canton (the Americans had previously robbed British ships in Chinese waters as well). These, in combination with the British support to Nepal during their invasion of Tibet and later the British invasion of Nepal after it became a Chinese tributary state, led the Chinese authorities to become highly suspicious of British intentions.\n\nA seemingly insatiable western demand for tea from China towards the end of the 18th century caused a significant deficit in the British balance of trade. The Chinese had little interest in Western goods and would only accept silver in payment. This spurred the East India Company to sell opium grown on its plantations in India to independent traders, who shipped it on to China to sell in exchange for silver, despite the fact that opium was already illegal in China. China tried to stop the importation of this opium, but the traders persisted. Chinese attempts to regain control led to the First Opium War, when British gunboat diplomacy quickly forced China to sign an unequal treaty of trade.\n\nFollowing the signature of the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, British subjects are \"allowed\nto reside, for the purpose of carrying on their mercantile pursuits, without molestation or restraint\" at Canton, Shanghai, Amoy (Xiamen), Ningpo (Ningbo) and Foochow (Fuzhou). In addition, Article V of the Treaty specifically abolishes the Canton system, allowing British merchants, and eventually all foreign merchants, to deal with whomever they please in the newly-opened ports.\n\nIn 1859 Canton's trade moved to a new site on the reclaimed sandbank of Shamian Island, a short distance west of the former factories. By then much of the foreign trade with China had shifted to the by then British colony of Hong Kong (acquired under the Treaty of Nanking), and to the northern ports, with their advantage of proximity to Beijing as well as the Grand Canal and the Yellow River, both vital arteries in the internal trade of Qing China. By 1866, only 18 foreign firms still had offices in Canton while there were only 60 foreign residents excluding British Indians and tidewaiters (who boarded boats as part of custom's inspections) employed by Sir Robert Hart's Imperial Maritime Customs Service.\n\nBy the time Hong Kong became a full-fledged British Colony, many of the merchants would be led by a newer generation of western hong merchants. Many of these companies would become the backbone of the young Hong Kong economy.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

It is fed by a 7-round detachable single-stack magazine (an optional 5-round magazine is also available). It is specifically chambered in either .408 Chey Tac or .375 Chey Tac ammunition. CheyTac LLC states that the system is capable of delivering sub-MOA accuracy at ranges of up to , one of the longest ranges of all modern-day sniper rifles. It is based on the EDM Arms Windrunner.\n\nThe CheyTac system consists of three major components:\n\nThe CheyTac M200 Intervention is a manually operated, rotating bolt sniper rifle. It features a Picatinny rail on the top of its receiver for mounting various optical sights.\n\nThe M200 Intervention is chambered in either the .408 CheyTac or .375 CheyTac cartridge. CheyTac specially developed the .408 CheyTac/.375 CheyTac cartridge for long-range use. The cartridge is optimized for accuracy by a balance of the rotational and linear drag, which reduces yaw and precession, and keeps the tip of the projectile pointed along the trajectory.\n\nThe M200 Intervention is fed through a detachable 7 round box magazine, an optional 5 round box magazine is also available. Alternatively cartridges can be loaded singly directly into the chamber.\n\nThe M200 Intervention uses a free floating heavy-fluted barrel, which can be quickly removed for replacement or storage and transportation, and the shroud at the rear serves as a mount for an integral folding bipod and a carrying handle.\n\nTo achieve balanced flight the rifling twist rate for the .408 CheyTac chambering was chosen at 330.2 mm (1:13 in), with eight 0.4080 in diameter grooves, 0.4010 in diameter bore and a 0.050\" land width, square cut, with no taper. The later .375 CheyTac round, developed from the .408 CheyTac, uses a 292 mm (1:11.5 in) rifling twist rate.\n\nThe M200 Intervention features the McArthur PGRS-1 muzzle brake, which can be used to reduce recoil. It was designed by a gunsmith and firearm inventor, Bruce McArthur, owner of The Flint & Frizzen Gun Shop in Clarkston, Michigan. The muzzle brake is also removable and can be replaced by an OPSINC suppressor.\n\nThe M200 Intervention has a collapsible and retractable buttstock that is adjustable for length of pull for ease storage and transportation. The buttstock also contains an integral rear monopod, which is hinged, and can be folded up when not in use.\n\nThere are two different day optical sights available for the M200 Intervention. The standard optical sight is the Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 variable magnification telescopic sight with a 56 mm objective. The alternative optical sight is the US Optics SN-9. The night vision system is the AN/PVS-14 GEN III Pinnacle monocular, which attaches to the day optic using the Monoloc device. An AN/PEQ-2 infrared laser provides additional lighting in low-light conditions. The device is attached to a titanium strut.\n\nThe M200 Intervention comes with a portable advanced ballistic computer, laser rangefinder binoculars and meteorological and environmental sensor package. All these components, together with the sniper rifle, are part of the CheyTac Long Range Sniper System (LRRS) and are linked to the ballistic computer. It provides all necessary data and calculations for accurate long range firing.\n\nThe Intervention holds the world record for best group at a distance, landing 3 bullets within at near Arco in Idaho.\n\nOn the Discovery Channel TV show \"Future Weapons\" April 9, 2007, episode \"Massive Attack\" the host Richard Machowicz, a former United States Navy SEAL, made 3 out of 6 shots, hitting a human-sized sheet of metal at a distance of at Arco Pass in Idaho.\n\nIn 2017 British news agencies reported a Special Air Service sniper hitting an ISIL sniper from using a CheyTac Intervention rifle.\n\nCheyTac states that \"the CheyTac LRRS is a solid anti-personnel system to .\" The primary intent of the .408 is as an extreme range anti-personnel system. Groups of at , at and at have been consistently obtained.\n\nGroups of at and at have also been obtained. All groups that are up to are less than 1 minute of angle for vertical dispersion.\n\nThe CheyTac Intervention comes in several variants:\nThe main capability differences between the different variants are governed by barrel length which determines the obtainable muzzle velocity. Higher muzzle velocity extends the effective range of a rifle, everything else being equal. The M200 and the M200 Carbine are and were limited to official customers like military forces and come with a detachable box magazine and a telescopic stock, whilst the current (2013) other variants have a glass-fiber fixed McMillan A5 stock and are available for the general public.\n\nThe CheyTac M300 Intervention (Carbon Fiber) is a modern rendition of the M200 Intervention. CheyTac utilized lightweight materials such as aluminum and carbon fiber to achieve a lightweight portable sniper rifle that doesn't compromise on strength, accuracy, or agility.\n\nThe M300 Intervention (Carbon Fiber) can be chambered in either .408 CheyTac or .375 CheyTac cartridge and uses a 7-round detachable box magazine. It has an effective range of , and a weight of . It features all of the standard features of the M200 Intervention and also features a full-length Picatinny rails at 3, 6, 9 and 12 o’clock positions for mounting various accessories, such as accuracy enhancements, a fluted barrel (custom lengths are also available), a barrel twist rate of 1:13.25\" twist for the .408 CheyTac cartridge and 1:11.25\" twist for .375 CheyTac cartridge, a detachable muzzle brake, a fully adjustable folding buttstock that has an adjustable cheek weld, a recoil pad and an optional monopod, an adjustable pistol grip, an adjustable match trigger and flush cups for weapon sling mounting.\n\nThe CheyTac M300 Intervention (Composite) is a civilian/sporting variant of the M300 Intervention (Carbon Fiber).

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nCabangan is a coastal town that was originally located in Barrio San Isidro. Its strategic location near the South China Sea was very compelling that a group of few families whose principal source of livelihood was fishing decided to settle in that area.\n\nThere was a time when this town was frequently visited by Moro pirates who were notoriously known for their skill in using spears. They came by means of their swift vintas and murdered some of the inhabitants and looted their properties. Because of this the early settlers decided to go further from the sea and left San Isidro.\n\nOn their journey of finding a new settlement area, they passed through a hill were many palm trees were growing. These trees were growing. These trees bear fruits in the shape of large pots, locally known as the “banga”. The luxuriant palm trees were abundant in the locality that they called the place “Kabangaan”. When the Americans came, they could hardly pronounce the word Kabangaan, instead they pronounced it ‘Cabangan’. Since then, the people who settled permanently in that area adopted the name Cabangan.\n\nCabangan was formally established in 1680. Justo Alinea (1898) was the first “Capitan Municipal,” which is equivalent to the position of the mayor at present time. The first “Presidente” Municipal was Mr. Benito Rivera, from years 1901 to 1902. He was succeeded by Mr. Antero Mora (1903-1904). In 1905, during the term of Mr. Andres Dumaplin, Botolan and Cabangan were governed by the same Presidente. The usage of the term “Presidente Municipal” ended in 1906 and Mr. Raymundo Dacoroon was elected to succeed Mr. Dumaplin. Mr. Dacoroon’s term ended in 1908. After this year, the people of Cabangan elected their officials in their town.\n\nCabangan is politically subdivided into 22 barangays.\nIn the , the population of Cabangan was people, with a density of .\n\nThe Municipality of Cabangan lies on the western part of the Province of Zambales. It has a total land area of 24, 890 hectares and approximately lies within bounds it on the north, on the east by the Zambales Mountain Ranges, the Municipality of San Felipe on the south, and on the west by the West Philippine Sea.\n\nThe economy of Cabangan can be described to be operating mainly on subsistence. It is further characterized to be primarily an agricultural economy, with twenty of its twenty two barangays predominantly agricultural communities.\n\nThe municipality’s main source of income is fishing, followed closely by farming and self-employment as the secondary and tertiary source of livelihood. Trade activities are done usually within barangays, as well as outside or with adjacent barangays.\n\nAgricultural activities in the municipality, composed primarily of rice farming, are done within the months of June to August. The other crops that are produced by the town’s agricultural sector are corn, root crops, legumes, leafy vegetables, fruit vegetables, and various spices. Livestock marketing is composed of pigs – hog fattening, poultry farming of broiler and native chicken, as well as carabao and cattle farming. Cabangan micro-industry are characterized by basket weaving, production of bamboo products such as furniture, furniture from rattan, ashware, broom making, and nipa frond weaving for roof thatches and as local hats or salakot.\n\nCommercial activities in the municipality are mainly those which aim only to support local economy. Existing commercial establishments are mainly located along the major roads of Cabangan. There is only one public market, located in Barangay Dolores and is about 500 meters away from the Municipal Hall. All other crop and catch sales are done either along the coasts, and there is only one bank – The Rural Bank of Cabangan, to support banking requirements of its locals.\n\nThe municipality is accessible via the provinces of Bulacan-Pampanga and Bataan along the major highway network. It is 186 kilometers away from Manila equivalent to 3 ½ hours ride. It is accessible via the Province of Pangasinan. Road condition is good along the coastline, however, going inland, along the mountainside, roads are narrow, unpaved, and badly maintained.\n\nThe municipality has a varied topography characterized by high mountains to narrow coastal plains. The most outstanding feature observable in the municipality is the Zambales Range.\n\nThe main drainage systems in Cabangan are the Tanguay, Yabel, Kileng, Anonang Rivers, all draining westward towards the Philippine Sea. The rivers are wide with heavy floodplain deposits. Numerous small tributaries around the area.\n\nVegetation reflects the underlying rock types especially in the Central and Northern portions of the range. Gabbro supports dense forest at low altitudes while periodite is generally barren. Lowlands are planted with rice, root crops, and other seasonal crops. The rolling and moderately sloping areas are covered with fruit bearing trees.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nMuch of the population are Ilocanos, descendants of migrants from Ilocos. \n\nThe town was affected by the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, being buried in about a meter in volcanic ash but damage was comparatively light.\n\nSan Felipe was one among the little villages along the coastal region of Zambales during the pre-Spanish period. The first inhabitants were the Malay Zambas who lived in lowland which they themselves called Hindol. There were also Negritoes but most of them lived in mountains.\n\nA few years after the discovery of the Philippines, all places in the country had been explored by the Spanish authorities and the exploration of Zambales began in 1572 by Juan de Salcedo, grandson of Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, first Spanish Governor General of the Philippines. Juan de Salcedo and Spanish followers made a survey of its coastal region and organize communities which were first called encomiendas but which were later called pueblos. As the population of the villages increased which was caused by the steady immigration of Ilocanos from the Ilocandia region before 1800 until 1860, more pueblos were organized.\n\nThe first waves of Ilocanos found their way to Hindol, which was later called Sindol, and less than the kilometers south of Sindol was the place called Bobulon. Hindol was a Zambal Aeta name of a tree than abundant in the place. Bobulon was also a kind tree then abundant at the Public Plaza. However, there was another version why it was called Bobulon. It was said that the first voyage of Ilocano settlers had all the favorable wind ( bulon ) from Paoay, Ilocos Norte to this village. The other waves of Ilocano settlers, who were mostly merchants and fishermen, came from Vigan and San Vicente, Ilocos Sur.\n\nThe first seat of the pueblo government was in Sindol and the head of the pueblo was called Capitan Municipal who as head of the pueblo was responsible in paying the taxes which could not be collected from his barangays which were headed by Cabezas de barangay. As gathered from reliable sources, one of the town executives when the seat of the government was still here in Sindol was Capitan Municipal Pedro Farañal, father of the late Municipal President Juan Farañal. The pueblo was later transferred from Sindol to Bobulon because the latter was already more populated, had a wider area for residential purposes, and it was farther from the mountains were the aetas, still wild lived. The name Bobulon was changed to San Felipe when it was founded in 1853. As to how the town of San Felipe got its present name, the most reliable fact learned so far was that four “saintly” brothers from Ilocandia, namely Marcelino, Antonio, Narciso and Felipe settled in the about to be organized pueblos which were later named San Marcelino, San Antonio, San Narciso and San Felipe. As a matter of fact, most of the inhabitants of these four towns were Ilocanos from the Ilocos region. Under the Spanish regime and during the early part of American regime, San Felipe was a separate town. Its first Municipal President was Don Saturnino Pastor who was the town executive from January 1, 1901 to December 31, 1902. For the purpose of governmental administration, San Felipe was incorporated with San Narciso, The Municipal President of the combined towns of San Felipe and San Narciso was Don Simeon Maranon and Nicolas Amagna was the Municipal Vice-President. Being a smaller town, San Felipe was only entitled to four Councilors while San Narciso had five. The councilors for San Felipe were – Don Juan Farañal, Don Victorino Amancio, Don Alejo Apostol and Don Macario Manglicmot. These officials, together with some others in San Felipe, later worked for the separation of San Felipe from San Narciso through Don Alberto Barretto, who was then a member of the first Philippine Assembly. Meanwhile, before the separation Don Angel Dumlao y Farrales, from San Narciso, took over as Municipal President for San Felipe – San Narciso covering the period from January 1, 1905 to February 28, 1908.\n\nUnder the combined leadership of Nicolas Amagna, Flaviano Dumlao, Severo Amagna, Nemesio Farrales, Isidoro Fuenticilla and Joaquin Feria a resolution was adopted to effect the final separation of San Felipe from San Narciso. On March 1, 1908, San Felipe was formally separated from San Narciso and the first Municipal officials after separation were;\n\n\nBarangays (district) in the poblacion and barangays (barrios) outside the town proper.\n\nBarangays in the poblacion and their names :\n\nBarangay Apostol has been named in honor of the late Capitan Municipal Juan Apostol, Barangay Manglicmot has been named in honor of the late Capitanes Municipal – Julian Manglicmot, Casimiro Manglicmot and Lope Manglicmot.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality is home to Mapanuepe Lake that formed after the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo.\n\nThe town got its name after the first Capitan Municipal whose name was Marcelino. The people of this municipality during that time were fond of Saints, so they added \"San\" to the name Marcelino, thus making it San Marcelino. The first election was held on January 14, 1906 and Matias Apostol was the first elected President. San Marcelino was Christianized after the arrival of Father Guillermo and after his departure, the people rightfully chose San Guillermo as their town's patron saint.\n\nSan Marcelino is politically subdivided into 18 barangays.\n\nThe area that is now known as San Marcelino was originally owned by Sambal-speaking peoples, but over time was purchased and became entirely owned by Ilocano-speaking peoples.\n\nMarcelinian civilization, according to old Municipal documents, started at the peak of the beautiful Vega Hill in the heart of an idyllic and luxuriant Zambales jungle during the pre-Hispanic settlers from the Ilocos Region led by the old Corpuses, Udans, Ragadios, Raguinis, Rabanes and Fabunans. With courage, hard work and perseverance, these Marcelinian forefathers harnessed the untouched wilderness of Vegal Hill and its immediate surroundings and slowly converted the area into a pulsating and vibrant community nurtured by the abundant natural yield of what was once an untamed wildlife.\n\nVega Hill reportedly measured 440.94 square kilometers. It used to be one of the three communities that comprised a town. The two others were what are now known as Castillejos and San Antonio. Castillejos was reportedly the hub of leadership because when the Ilocanos arrived in the area, the Tagalog-speaking native residents where already organized.\n\nNaturally adventurous and united by their common struggles, the Ilocano settlers eventually left Vega Hill and stayed in Magaring, a place now known as Barangay Linasin. This area was, and still is, part of the town. Eventually, the Ilocanos decided to settle at the Poblacion. However, they refused to be integrated into the communities of the local residents. They lived according to their own tradition. They were governed by their obedience to their community elders.\n\nWhen the Spaniards came, a kind-hearted Spanish friar, Father Guillermo, stayed at the Poblacion with the Marcelinian forefathers. In the succeeding years, more Spanish friars came, strengthening the stronghold of Christianity among the Ilocano settlers. The need for formalizing a political/administrative structure of the town also became evident as the population increased and the socio-economic life of the town became complex. Consequently, a government structure was set up under the leadership of the friars whose power, at this point in time, had become entrenched, anchored on religion. The friars appointed local or district leaders, a cabeza de barangay for every barangay among which were Consuelo, Nagbunga and Sinnerrekan (now known as Linusungan). The number of barangays has expanded to 18 since then.\n\nIn the settlers' barangay of barrio, a middle-aged Teniente del Barrio, Marcelino Ora, was appointed. It was after him that the town was eventually named, long after he was gone. \"San\" was arbitrarily added to the name due to the people's religiosity. Domingo Magsaysay and Antonio Rolls later succeeded him.\n\nWhen the barangay needed to choose a patron saint, the leaders chose the priest who Christianized the town, Father Guillermo. Ath the time the priest had already left San Marcelino, Like Marcelino Ora, the title of Saint was apparently just attachéd to his name.\n\nIt was after Marcelino Ora that the town was eventually named.\n\nIn 1843, the Marcelinians filed a petition for San Marcelino's elevation to a being a Pueblo through the Teniente Primero, Antonio Ladrido Juliano. In 1846, the petition was approved.\n\nThe elation over the appointment of a local leader did not last long. The Marcelinian elders became discontented over the fact that their appointed leaders turned out to be just nominal leaders. The friars still made the decision in relation to important matters. In addition, the friars reportedly became shockingly abusive.\n\nIn anger, many of the leaders and pockets of townspeople joined the insurrectos - rebel groups. In the forefront where Jorge Udan, Francisco Corpus and Alipio Corpus. Relenting to the demands of majority of the people, the friars later agreed to give the leaders bigger participation in running their respective districts.\n\nOn March 10, 1852 San Marcelino held its first municipal election for a Teniente Absoluto. At this point, historical records became confusing. The next account has dated January 14, 1906 when a Matias Apostol was reportedly installed as the First Elected President of San Marcelino. From then on, the progressive development of San Marcelino continued under duly elected leaders.\n\nFrom late 1900 to March 1902, the 25th Infantry Regiment, operated in Zambales, including San Marcelino, during the Philippine-American War, with elements in San Marcelino in December 1900 and March 1902. During this period, the regiment conducted policing and judiciary functions, such as the prosecution of Elias Agpalo.\n\nIn 1904, due to Act Number 945 of the Philippine Commission, San Marcelino's municipal oversight was extended to neighboring Castillejos and San Antonio. That same year, Ilokano was the primary language spoken in San Marcelino, with Tagalog being a secondary language; of the Negrito who lived in Zambales all lived in the jurisdictions of San Marcelino or Botolan. In 1905, in a report produced by the War Department, the area around San Marcelino were used to cultivate rice, and the people were Ilocano.\n\nIn the , the population of San Marcelino was people, with a density of .\n\nSan Marcelino Airfield was built before the war by the Americans. On the morning of 29 January 1945 nearly 35,000 U.S. troops landed just north-west of San Marcelino. Elements of the US 38th Division immediately dashed inland to take the airstrip, but found that Filipino soldiers of the 3rd, 32nd, 33rd, 35th and 36th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the recognized guerrillas under the command of Capt. Ramon Magsaysay, later President of the Republic of the Philippines, had secured the field three days earlier.\n\nAfter the liberation by combined Filipino-American troops in Zambales in 1945, it was developed into a Fifth Air Force command facility as well as an operational airfield. With the end of the war, the airfield was closed and is now part of the town of San Marcelino.\n\nPresident Ramon Magsaysay State University - San Marcelino Campus, formerly known as Western Luzon Agricultural College (WLAC) and as Ramon Magsaysay Technological University - San Marcelino Campus is a government funded higher education institution in Zambales established in 1910 and converted into a state university in 1998 thus changing its name from Western Luzon Agricultural College to President Ramon Magsaysay State University - San Marcelino Campus under the University system. The main campus of PRMSU is located in the Municipality of Iba, Zambales. The university is named after the province's greatest son and former President of the Republic of the Philippines, President Ramon Magsaysay. Aside from the San Marcelino Campus, it also has satellite campuses in the municipalities of Santa Cruz, Candelaria, Masinloc, Botolan and Castillejos - all in the province of Zambales. The university also offers nursing courses at the Mondriaan Aura College in SBMA under a consortium program.\n\nPRMSU is one of the fastest growing state universities in the country. This was proven when the Department of Budget and Management in 2007 classified RMTU as a Level III-A university, thus leveling with established universities in Metro Manila like the University of the Philippines and the Polytechnic University of the Philippines.\n\nOn February 12, 1998, President Fidel Ramos signed Republic Act 8498 authored by Zambales 2nd District Representative Antonio Magsaysay Diaz. The law integrated the Ramon Magsaysay Polytechnic College in Iba, the Western Luzon Agricultural College in San Marcelino (with campus in the Municipality of Botolan), and the Candelaria School of Fisheries in Candelaria into a university system known as Ramon Magsaysay Technological University. A three- year transition period transpired before the formal operation of the university in 2001. In the same year, Dr. Feliciano S. Rosete was invested as the first president of the university.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is located along the northern coast of Subic Bay. Iba, the provincial capital of Subic is a fast-growing municipality and is expected to become a component city in the future, as well as increase in revenue. It is a former home of one of the largest US military facilities outside of the US mainland, the Subic Bay Naval Base.\n\nThe native Zambales inhabitants called the area \"Hubek\", which means \"head of a plough\"; Spanish missionary priests mispronounced the name as \"Subiq\". By the time of the American Occupation, \"Subiq\" was mispronounced as \"Subig\". Eventually, the name reverted to \"Subiq\", but the letter 'q' was replaced with letter 'c'.\n\nIn 1572, Juan de Salcedo, the Mexico-born Spanish conquistador and grandson of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, founded Zambales during his exploration of northern Luzon. Subic was founded in the late 1607 when Augustinian friars headed by Rev. Fr. Rodrigo de San Miguel, this we're started when the natives in Subic especially Negritos and Aetas was Christianized under the rule of Spain \n\nIn September 1762, the British invaded the Philippines and took over the Spanish main naval base in Manila Bay. This prompted the Spanish military to scout for the next promising naval station. The expedition returned with the good news for the naval command - a natural bounty and deep waters at Subic Bay. King Alfonso XII issued a decree in 1884 that declared Subic as \"a naval port and the property appertaining there to set aside for naval purposes.\" Construction of an arsenal and ship repair yard ensued March 8 the following year, as ordered by the new settlers' Naval Commission. Subic Bay's potential as naval station was realized by the Americans. Commodore George Dewey and his men engaged in a battle that destroyed the Spanish Army in 1898, and the Americans took over Subic Bay on December 10, 1899.\n\nIn 1902, Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans, Commander of the Asiatic Stations, directed 200 Marines for an expeditionary force for the first U.S. fleet exercise in Asian waters. Guns were erected on Grande Island and Admiral Evans laid plans for emergency repairs of the station at Subic Bay, but was denied assistance by the U.S. Five years later, the U.S. Congress finally appropriated funds for a full-scale Subic Bay Naval Reservation. Words from then President Theodore Roosevelt goes: \"If we are to exert the slightest influence in Western Asia, it is of the highest importance that we have a naval station in boto\nBay.\" Subic Bay is now on the rise of being one of the best training areas in the Corps. But with the U.S., and Japan tension heating up, appropriations for operation and maintenance of the base fell short. Hawaii came in the scene. Funding of the development of Pearl Harbor as US main station in the Pacific earned the thumbs up of the Congress. Subic took its ill fate, a promising harbor was left as a small repair station.\n\nUS was drawn into the war in Europe. Filipinos and Americans worked hand in hand to prepare the battleships for World War I. Workers at Subic Bay also overhauled 26 German ships that had been used to transport thousands of American troops to Europe. Likewise, this period gave way for different developments: Olongapo had a taste of some of its best years, the base was lined with trees and plants, and several recreational facilities were constructed.\n\nThe Japanese claimed Subic and Olongapo on January 10, 1942. Days after the Pearl Harbor attack, bringing with them the devastation of World War II. Many Filipinos and Americans were killed, several buildings were destroyed, seven seaplanes were sunk, and lines of telephones and telegraphs were sabotaged. The Marines were ordered to withdraw into Bataan then soon to Corregidor, burning all buildings left standing after the Japanese attack. Filipinos torched all the wars ruins in Olongapo. Filipinos were subjected to the cruelty of the Japanese for three years, after which the Americans made a forceful rebound and reoccupied the base on January 29, 1945.\n\nThe Marine station underwent massive reconstruction and was again ready for naval endeavors on September 26, 1945. Shortly after the marines resumed their duties, the Tydings-McDuffie Law set provision for Philippine independence and was granted on July 4, 1946. Nonetheless, the US maintained that it would still retain the country's military bases. The Philippines, acknowledging its frailty in the Cold War, entered into the RP-US Military Bases Agreement on March 14, 1947. The US was granted the right to retain sixteen military bases and to administrate the town of Olongapo. Several significant urbanization projects were orchestrated, but the most challenging was as gigantic as displacing half the part of a 1,200-foot mountain, that needed around 20 million man-hours, and required five years of labor. The exceptional air station and pier construction of the Seabees was the highlight of 1956 in Subic Bay. Another accomplishment at the height of the cold war was ammunition bunkers and buildings that occupied over 12,400 acres of the Southwestern part of Subic Bay. Set in the tropical rainforest, ammunition and ordnance from these facilities played a big role in the Vietnam War and in the Gulf War of 1991.\n\nThe original 1947 military pact between the Philippines and the US has been amended. The year 1979 witnessed a turning point for both countries. Philippines claimed a sovereign rule over the base and the US area of responsibility was reduced from 24,000 hectares to 6,300 hectares. What followed was a series of events that would change the course of Subic Bay forever. On June 15, 1991, volcanic ashes and debris rained over the base, devastating Subic Bay and neighboring provinces. Mt. Pinatubo's fury has left the US Navy and Air Force no option but to evacuate all their dependents. When Pinatubo's rage came to a halt, and American and Filipino personnel restored the base, bringing it back to business in no time. Uncertainty continued hovering the Philippine Senate with regard to the termination of the 1947 treaty. Months-long discussions were held; parliamentary proceedings were organized; and a pro-bases rally was staged, but to no avail. September 16, 1991 surfaced a conclusion, the US had to withdraw its forces and equipment from Clark and Subic, having received the rejection of 12 senators on the earlier proposed new treaty. The lowering of the Stars and Stripes followed suit. The Navy bid farewell to America's nine decades of military presence on Philippine soil.\n\nSurprisingly the departure of the Americans did not spell doom. Subic has since been transformed and became a model for bases conversion into commercial use after the Cold War with blue chip companies like Coastal Petroleum, Enron and FedEx pumping in over $3 billion of investments creating 70,000 jobs in the free port's first four years. It was host to the 4th APEC Leaders' Summit on November 24, 1996 and FedEx's Asia-Pacific hub, Asia-One, was also located in Subic Bay for almost ten years.\n\nIn addition to commercial use, Subic Bay is also a popular destination for weekend visitors from Metro Manila. Attractions include several beaches, an underwater aquarium, jungle survival tours, racing and duty-free shopping centers. Both Subic Bay Freeport and the municipality itself sustain major improvement and continuing its growth as of today.\n\nSubic is politically subdivided into 16 barangays.\n\nThis is the complete list of municipal leaders such as Mayor, and Presidente Municipal since it was become municipality since 1902.\n\nIn the , the population of Subic was people, with a density of .\n\n\n\nMost of Private schools are operated by Catholic Institution except for colleges.\n\nThe nearest airport is the Subic Bay International Airport situated south of the town proper.\n\nThe Port of Subic is the nearest seaport in Subic. The Port is operated and managed by the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA). It covers the fenced area of the former U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay located in the south-west of Luzon Island in the Philippines. Local fish port is also present at the coastal waters and some are in beach side.\n\nThe primary road that connects Subic to the other parts of the town is the Olongapo-Bugallon Road. Most of the names of those streets are based on the surnames of prominent residents or names of plants. Most of the roads in Subic are made of concrete and asphalt while others are still dirts.\n\nDiversion Road like Govic Highway are also commonly used by motorist from Barangay Matain to Barangay Manggahan.

Articles in popular media position cyberchondria anywhere from temporary neurotic excess to adjunct hypochondria. Cyberchondria is a growing concern among many healthcare practitioners as patients can now research any and all symptoms of a rare disease, illness or condition, and manifest a state of medical anxiety.\n\nThe term \"cyberchondria\" is a portmanteau neologism derived from the terms cyber- and hypochondria. (The term \"hypochondrium\" derives from Greek and literally means the region below the \"cartilage\" or \"breast bone.\") Researchers at Harris Interactive clarified the etymology of cyberchondria, and state in studies and interviews that the term is not necessarily intended to be pejorative.\n\nA review in the \"British Medical Journal\" publication \"Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry\" from 2003 says cyberchondria was used in 2001 in an article in the United Kingdom newspaper \"The Independent\" to describe \"the excessive use of internet health sites to fuel health anxiety.\" The BBC also used cyberchondria in April, 2001. The BMJ review also cites the 1997 book from Elaine Showalter, who writes the internet is a new way to spread \"pathogenic ideas\" like Gulf War syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis. Patients with cyberchondria and patients of general hypochondriasis often are convinced they have disorders \"with common or ambiguous symptoms.\"\n\nThe first systematic study of cyberchondria, reported in November 2008, was performed by Microsoft researchers Ryen White and Eric Horvitz, who conducted a large-scale study that included several phases of analysis. White and Horvitz defined cyberchondria as the “unfounded escalation of concerns about common symptomatology, based on the review of search results and literature on the Web.” They analyzed a representative crawl of the web for co-occurrences of symptoms with diseases in web content as well as the content returned as search results from queries on symptoms and found high rates of linkage of rare, concerning diseases (e.g., brain tumor) to common symptoms (e.g., headache). They also analyzed anonymized large-scale logs of queries to all of the popular search engines and noted the commonality of escalations of queries from common complaints to queries on concerning diseases. They also found that potentially disruptive querying about disorders (arrived at via a search escalation) could continue in other sessions over days, weeks, and months, and that the queries could disrupt non-medical search activities.\n\nWhite and Horvitz conducted a survey of over 500 people that confirmed the prevalence of web-induced medical anxieties. The survey noted that a significant portion of subjects considered the ranking of a list of results on a medical query as linked to the likelihood of relevant disorders. They point out the potential importance of findings drawn from the psychology of judgment in their work. In particular, they point out that previously studied \"biases of judgment\" play a role in cyberchondria. The authors highlighted the potential biases of availability (the recency and density of exposure of someone to events raises the assessed likelihood of the events) and base-rate neglect (people often do not properly consider the low prior probability of events occurring) as influencing both search engines and then people searching the web. Confirmation bias, a tendency for people to confirm their preconceptions or hypotheses, may also contribute to cyberchondria.\n\nIn a paper published in the proceedings of the 2009 Symposium of the American Medical Informatics Association, White and Horvitz present further findings from their 500-person survey on peoples’ experiences with the online investigation of medical concerns and self diagnosis. They found that overall, people report to having a low level of health anxiety, but that Web-based escalation of concerns occurs frequently for around one in five people. Two in five people report that interactions with the Web increases medical anxiety and approximately half of people report that it reduces anxiety. White and Horvitz suggest that Web content providers be cognizant of their potential to heighten medical anxiety and consider the ramifications of publishing alarming medical information, emphasize the importance of Web content in facilitating patient-physician interaction, and recommend periodic surveys and analysis with different cohorts to track changes in health-seeking experiences over time.\n\nIn a paper published in proceedings to the 2010 ACM Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval Conference, the authors present research on predicting escalations in medical concerns based on the structure and content of Web pages encountered during medical search sessions. They construct and then characterize the performance of classifiers that predict whether an escalation will occur in issued queries following the visit to a page. Their findings show that features such as serious illness preceding benign explanations in page (e.g., cancer is mentioned before caffeine in pages pertaining to headaches), serious illness vs. benign explanation appears in page title or near beginning of page, page from Web forum, and page has external verification are all important predictors of subsequent escalation (or non-escalation).\n\nA study by researchers from Imperial College London published in September 2018 conclcuded that the condition is leading to a health anxiety epidemic in the UK. According to the authors, one in five appointments at the UK's National Health Service (NHS) is now related to internet-induced irrational fears about one's state of health. The study estimated the costs to the public healthcare system of such visits to be at £420 million per year \"in outpatient appointments alone, with millions more spent on needless tests and scans\".\n\nA paper from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland suggested that doctors annotate diagnoses posted online with complementary information, including statistics elaborating on incidence and prevalence. This was proposed as a potential means to alleviate online-induced health anxiety by placing the diagnosis into a wider context.\n\nIn 2002 the Sydney Morning Herald wrote \"a visit to an Internet clinic will probably diagnose drowsiness as chronic fatigue, anal itch as bowel cancer and a headache as a tumour.\" Many reputable medical organizations maintain websites that may include brief overviews of various conditions for individuals with a general curiosity, or more detailed information to aid the understanding of people who have been properly diagnosed. Often listing diagnoses without regard to incidence, prevalence, or relevant risk factors, websites may lead users to suspect rather rare and unlikely diseases as the source of their complaints. Since many benign conditions share symptoms with more serious ailments and are listed side-by-side, users without proper medical consultation may assume the worst rather than the likely diagnosis. Web-diagnosis can cause a great deal of distress and anxiety in users who believe themselves to have incurable and serious illnesses.\n\nPatients who go against medical advice or refuse to accept a professional diagnosis while quoting questionable web sources have become more common and can be a frustrating obstacle to physicians trying to provide a professional standard of care. It is recommended that patients who are in doubt attempt to get a second opinion before turning to web-based sources, and that self diagnosis is not used as a substitute for a professional medical consultation.\n\nSome medical practitioners are open to a patient's personal research, as this can open lines of communication between doctors and patients, and prove valuable in eliciting more complete or pertinent information from the patient about their present condition. One reason for this is the fact that the conditions is considered under-recognised by some medical professionals.\n\nOther doctors express concern about patients who self-diagnose on the basis of information obtained from the Internet when the patient demonstrates an incomplete or distorted understanding of other diagnostic possibilities and medical likelihoods. A patient who exaggerates one set of symptoms in support of their self-diagnosis while minimizing or suppressing contrary symptoms can impair rather than enhance a doctor's ability to reach a correct diagnosis.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117900", "title": "Neal Kay", "text": "Neal Kay\n\nNeal Kay is a former London-based disc jockey, born on 10 February 1950, who was an important factor in the rise of the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM), along with Tommy Vance, in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nNeal Kay has always been a DJ. He started out in the local youth club in the mid-sixties, and by the end of the 60s was a well established London-based night club DJ, working fully 6 nights a week. In 1969. he went to West Berlin with his future first wife, a dancer, to guest DJ in two clubs a night from dusk until dawn. His main club in Berlin was the Playboy Club. He also guested from time to time with the British Army.\n\nIn the period between 1975 and 1980, he managed a rock club called The Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse, originally resident in the back-room of the Prince of Wales public house in Kingsbury, North London; this back-room venue was known as 'The Bandwagon'. With great help from the music papers of the day, \"Sounds\" and \"Melody Maker\", he went on to establish this venue as the place for new upcoming bands and like minded fans of the heavy metal genre. Demo tapes started to arrive in their hundreds shortly after a two-page centre spread in \"Sounds\", penned by journalist Geoff Barton. Kay had one of the biggest club sound systems ever seen at the time, being an 8000 watt PA, comprising mainly JBL/Martin speakers and coach built JPS associates amps. In fact it was a touring style band system that he used to play his large collection of classic rock vinyl on. The PA was so loud that the mixing desk was \"flown\" on chains, suspended from the roof to help avoid feedback from the record decks.\n\nAll this attention in the media raised his profile, and he was often seen at large gigs such as the Rainbow Theatre and Hammersmith Odeon, eventually going on to touring with some of the top acts of the day, including Black Sabbath (with Ronnie James Dio), Rush, AC/DC, Judas Priest and many more. He was the first high level touring rock DJ of his time. In fact, early on, he also arranged personal appearances at the Wagon with such internationally famous rock legends as Ted Nugent, members of Rainbow, Judas Priest and Motörhead. All this helped to raise the profile of both the club and Kay even higher.\n\nHe also helped arranging and producing demos of new bands, recorded at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge. Amongst these bands were, Saxon, Praying Mantis and Iron Maiden, at the time new unsigned up and coming bands which would become key players of the new wave of British heavy metal – a phrase first coined by the then editor of \"Sounds\". He championed these and other acts, and went on to tour with those bands on full UK tours. The resulting popularity of Iron Maiden's recording led to a record contract for them with EMI. Several other NWOBHM bands also gained contracts due to their Soundhouse demos. Kay worked with EMI Records compiling many of these demos onto an album called \"Metal for Muthas\", of which several volumes were released.\n\nIn 1980, he was the MC for the very first Monsters of Rock Festival, at Castle Donington, headlined by Rainbow, Scorpions and Judas Priest. He also promoted heavy metal concerts and tours, and was an enthusiastic champion of US band Riot. Kay was also a band manager in the 1980s and early 1990s. During that same period, Neal also managed a large studio complex in South London called Samurai Studios, where he also learned the art of live sound engineering.\n\nAlso in the 90s, he went on tour to Japan with elements of Praying Mantis, ex-Iron Maiden and The Sweet. Whilst there he arranged with Japanese label Pony Canyon to record in London a new compilation LP called, \"Metal For Muthas 92\", which was released in 1993 in Japan and Far Eastern territories.\n\nIn fact, some time in the late 1970s, the Japanese music paper Ongu Senka approached Kay to write the story of the Bandwagon in 3 episodes, which, in turn helped to bring to the attention of young Japanese fans, the legend of The Soundhouse.\n\nIn the early nineties, whilst in Portugal, he came across a bar band called Iris (Portuguese for Rainbow) and was asked to work with them on what was to become their first CD. It was released to the Portuguese speaking world in 1996 and to this day, Kay still enjoys producing, arranging and even occasionally orchestrating some of the band's work, now 25 years on from when they first met each other. \nHe has also been working with Stormzone, a Northern Irish heavy metal band out of Belfast. Kay produced their first CD and continues to have input on their latest songs.\nHe also worked as a guest on Total Rock radio from time to time, with old time journalist/broadcaster mate Malcolm Dome, who, years before had given Kay and The Soundhouse a great review in the pages of \"Record Mirror\". They called the 3-hour shows \"The Rock n'Roll Round Table Circus\", and it was a mixture of classic rock tracks and pure insanity, with the occasional studio guests, and 6-hour Xmas specials.\n\nAlthough officially \"retired\", Neal continues with his studio work and occasionally donates time to various documentaries about the life, times, and the music that he always fought to help establish. In fact, even to this day, he still works with young up and coming bands, mainly in Portugal, both encouraging, arranging, producing and teaching the ways of Rock N' Roll to a whole new generation of determined and committed young singers and musicians, whilst finding time occasionally to deliver lectures in colleges on the history and main movers thru the 50s and 60s-the most formative years of the whole genre. \n\n"}

After the People's Republic of China was founded, the name Henan University was restored in 1984.\n\nHenan University is a comprehensive university with 12 branches of learning: agriculture, economics, education, engineering, history, law, liberal arts, management, medicine, philosophy and science. In 2016, the University was selected in the Plan 111, a key project initiated by the Chinese Ministry of Education. In 2017, The Chinese Ministry of Education granted it Double First Class status in biology.\n\nBy the end of 2018, Henan University had three campuses. Two campuses (Minglun and JinMing campus) are located in Kaifeng, a famous historic city which was the capital of China during seven different dynasties. The other (Longzi Lake campus) is located in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan Province and one of the National Central Cities in China. All the campuses cover a total area of 2,200,000 square meters with a room space of 1,470,000 square meters. More than 50,000 students receive a full-time education here, including 10,000 postgraduates and nearly 500 overseas students. Henan University is one of the biggest public universities in the People's Republic of China.\n\nFounded in 1912, Henan University is one of the oldest universities in China. It was originally named the Preparatory School for Further Study in Europe and America.\n\nAfterwards it was renamed Zhongzhou University (1923), Henan Zhongshan University (1927), Provincial Henan University (1930), and National Henan University (1942). Warlord Feng Yuxiang reportedly played an important role in the university's development, strongly supporting it during his five and a half months-long military governorship of Henan in 1922.\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the school was renamed Henan Normal College, then Kaifeng Normal College, and Henan Normal University. The name Henan University was restored in 1984.\n\nHenan University entered the list of the universities which are jointly developed by the provincial government and the Chinese Ministry of Education in 2008. It was a key national project for support the provincial university to be stronger.\n\nWhen Henan University celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2012, the former Premier Wen Jiabao inscribed congratulations to the University. He autographed an inscription \"\"Promoting Henan University Well to Revitalize Central Plains Education\"\" The same year, the State Council of PRC promulgated new policy to support Henan University to establish a First-class University in China. In 2017, the University became a \"Double First Class\" university.\n\nBy the end of 2018, Henan University had 97 undergraduate programs, 42 primary discipline Master’s programs, 174 sub-discipline Master’s programs, 20 professional Master’s programs, a primary discipline doctoral program and 18 doctoral programs and had 15 doctoral research centers.\n\nAmong the university's 4,300-strong staff were 11 full-time and half-time academicians as well as 1,200 professors and associate professors. There were more than 60,000 students receiving a full-time education at HENU; among them were more than 10,000 postgraduates and nearly 300 overseas students.\n\nHenan University Library was formally established in 1912. It claims to be one of the biggest university libraries in Henan Province, with eight service departments, and 36 reading-rooms in which there are more than 6,000 seats.\n\nIn 2014, it boasted a collection of more than 7.57 million items, of which 180,000 were hard-bound books of Chinese classics and 170,000 were foreign books.\n\nHenan University comprises two campuses, Minglun () and Jinming (). The university covers a total area of about 660 acres with a gross floor area of more than 100 million square meters.\n\nMinglun, the main and oldest campus of Henan University, is located in Shunhe Hui District, Kaifeng. The Big Auditorium (built in 1931, a palatial architecture in center of the Minglun campus), the monument of imperial examinations (built in the Song Dynasty, key cultural heritage) and History Museum (has many valuable historical relics).\n\nThe Jinming campus is located in Jinming District, Kaifeng. It includes the Key Laboratory of the PRC Ministry of Education. Jinming campus is the biggest campus of Henan University. It was opened in 2002 and most of Institute of science and Engineering are built here.\n\nBy the end of 2018, Henan University's Longzi Lake campus was still under construction.

It is by far the most southerly atoll or island of the country and of the Caroline Islands, south of the next southerly atoll, Nukuoro, and southwest of the main island of Pohnpei state; it forms a Polynesian outlier.\n\nThe total area of the atoll, including the lagoon, is . Out of this, is land area, spread over 33 wooded islets on the eastern side of the atoll, three of which host the population of about 500 people. The western reef rim of the atoll is almost submerged at high water.\n\nKapingamarangi has a population of about 500 (). Several hundred Kapingamarangi people also live in Porakied village in Pohnpei. Their language is Polynesian. The main industry is fishing.\n\nTouhou Island, which reaches a height of and is connected to Welua Island (Ueru Island) in the north by a causeway, is the capital of the municipality, the center of population and the home of a native chief. Most of the population resides on these two islets, plus the remnant on Taringa (south of Touhou), although many of the remaining islets are used for growing fruit and vegetables.\n\nThe first recorded sighting by Europeans was by the Spanish expedition of Hernando de Grijalva in 1537, who charted it as \"Los Pescadores\" (Island of the Fishermen in Spanish, not to be confused with Pescadores Islands). This discovery was referred by a contemporary, the Portuguese António Galvão, governor of Ternate, in his book \"Tratado dos Descobrimentos\" of 1563.\n\nIn the 19th century it was charted as \"Greenwich\" and \"Pikaram\" by the English, and \"Constantine\" by the French.\n\nThe island was occupied by the Japanese during World War II, and attacked by U.S. Navy long-range bombers. Two Japanese ships are listed on a wreck diving website.\n\nDuring the dispute for the Carolines between Germany and Spain in 1885, arbitrated by Pope Leo XIII, the sovereignty of Spain over the Caroline and Palau islands as part of the Spanish East Indies was analyzed by a commission of cardinals and confirmed by an agreement signed on 17 December. Its Article 2 specifies the limits of Spanish sovereignty in South Micronesia, being formed by the Equator and 11°N Latitude and by 133° and by 164° Longitude. In 1899, Spain sold the Marianas, Carolinas and Palaus to Germany after its defeat in 1898 in the Spanish–American War. However Emilio Pastor Santos, a researcher of the Spanish National Research Council, claimed in 1948 that there was historical basis, supported by the charts and maps of the time, to argue that Kapingamarangi and some other islands had never been considered part of the Carolines. Thus Kapingamarangi was not included in the description of the territory transferred to Germany, and therefore was not affected on the part of Spain to any cessation of transfer and theoretically Spain should have the only jurisdiction and right to this island.\n\nPastor Santos presented his thesis to the Spanish government in 1948. In the Council of Ministers of Spain on 12 January 1949, the Minister of Foreign Affairs declared on this proposal that it had passed to the first stage of public attention. The Cabinet of Diplomatic Information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs circulated the following note:\n\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs informed the Council of Ministers of the situation in which we find ourselves in view of information and public commentary in the press and because of the requests made of the Spanish administration. The Ministry recognises that it is a certain fact and historic truth due to Article 3 of the Treaty of July 1, 1899, that Spain reserved a series of rights in Micronesia and for another thing, the specifications of the territories which Spain ceded in 1899 leaves apart certain groups of islands in the same zone.\n\nHowever, no Spanish government has made any attempt in this respect, and this case remains as a historical curiosity related to Kapingamarangi.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117928", "title": "Nonvolatile BIOS memory", "text": "Nonvolatile BIOS memory\n\nNonvolatile BIOS memory refers to a small memory on PC motherboards that is used to store BIOS settings. It is traditionally called CMOS RAM because it uses a volatile, low-power complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) SRAM (such as the Motorola MC146818 or similar) powered by a small \"CMOS\" battery when system and standby power is off. It is referred to as non-volatile memory or NVRAM because, after the system loses power, it does retain state by virtue of the CMOS battery. The typical NVRAM capacity is 256 bytes.\n\nThe CMOS RAM and the real-time clock have been integrated as a part of the southbridge chipset and it may not be a standalone chip on modern motherboards.\n\nThe memory battery (aka motherboard, CMOS, real-time clock (RTC), clock battery) is generally a CR2032 lithium coin cell. This cell battery has an estimated life of 3 years when power supply unit (PSU) is unplugged or when the PSU power switch is turned off. This battery type, contrary to popular belief, is not rechargeable and trying to do so may result in an explosion. Motherboards have circuitry preventing batteries from being charged and discharged when a motherboard is powered on. Other common battery cell types can last significantly longer or shorter periods, such as the smaller CR2016 which will generally last about 40% less time than CR2032. Higher temperatures and longer power-off time will shorten battery cell life. When replacing the battery cell, the system time and CMOS BIOS settings may revert to default values. Unwanted BIOS reset may be avoided by replacing the battery cell with the PSU power switch turned on and plugged into an electric wall socket. On ATX motherboards, the PSU will supply 5V standby power to the motherboard to keep CMOS memory energized while the system is off.\n\nSome computer designs have used non-button cell batteries, such as the cylindrical \"1/2 AA\" used in the Power Mac G4 as well as some older IBM PC compatibles, or a 3-cell NiCd CMOS battery that looks like a \"barrel\" (common in Amiga and older IBM PC compatibles), which serves the same purpose. These motherboards often have a four pin straight header, with pin two missing, to connect an external 3.6v battery, such as the Tadiran TL-5242/W, when their soldered on batteries die.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2117938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117938", "title": "Drill bit shank", "text": "Drill bit shank\n\nThe shank is the end of a drill bit grasped by the chuck of a drill. The cutting edges of the drill bit contact the workpiece, and are connected via the shaft with the shank, which fits into the chuck. In many cases a general-purpose arrangement is used, such as a bit with cylindrical shaft and shank in a three-jaw chuck which grips a cylindrical shank tightly. Different shank and chuck combination can deliver improved performance, such as allowing higher torque, greater centering accuracy, or moving the bit, but not the chuck, with a hammer action.\n\nThis shank was common before 1850, and is still in production. At first, the tapered shank was just rammed into a square hole in the end of the drill. Over time, various chuck designs have been invented, and modern chucks can grasp and drive this shank effectively.\n\nIt has been difficult to find a reference to the included angle of the taper, but 7 different bits were measured, and they all had an included angle of 8 ± 0.25 degrees.\n\n\nThe straight shank is the most usual style on modern drill bits, by number manufactured. The whole of the drill bit, shaft and shank, is usually of the same diameter. It is held usually in a three-jaw drill chuck. Bits of diameter too small to grip firmly can have straight shanks of larger diameter than the drill, which can be held firmly in a standard size collet or chuck. Large drill bits can have straight shanks narrower than the drill diameter so that they can be fitted in chucks not able to chuck the full diameter. Such a drill bit is called a reduced-shank or blacksmith's drill. For example, this allows a bit to be used in a pistol-grip drill's chuck. One particular type of reduced-shank drill bits are Silver & Deming (S&D) bits, whose sets run from to drill body diameter with a standard reduced shank for all. This allows drill presses with chucks to run the larger drills. S&D bits are long with a flute length. The name comes from a company in Salem, Ohio that broke up into other companies circa 1890; bits of this design were popularized by that company.\n\n\nThe flats of a hex shank can either be machined on a round shank, as in the photograph, or be the natural flats of hex bar stock. A hex shank can be grasped by a 3-jaw drill chuck or held in a chuck specifically for hex shanks. Quarter-inch hex shanks are common for machine screwdriver bits and have spread from that application to be used for drill bits that are compatible with screwdriver machinery.\n\nThe diameter of an SDS and SDS Plus shank is 10 millimeters. (The SDS Max is 18 millimeters.) \n\nThe SDS shank has the advantage of fitting into a simple spring-loaded chuck, so that bits are simply pushed into the chuck without tightening. This shank and chucks made for it are especially suited to hammer drilling with masonry drills in stone and concrete. The drill bit is not held solidly in the chuck, but can slide back and forth like a piston; it does not slip during rotation due to the non-circular shank cross-section, matching the chuck. The hammer of the drill acts to accelerate only the drill bit itself, and not the large mass of the chuck, which makes hammer drilling with an SDS shank drill bit much more productive than with other types of shank.\n\nRotational drive uses the sliding keyways that open to the end of the shank, which mate with keys in the chuck. The smaller indentations that do not open to the end are grasped by the chuck to prevent the drill bit falling out. The hammer of the drill hits the flat end of the shank. The shank must be lubricated with grease to allow it to slide in the chuck.\n\nThere are three standard sizes of SDS: SDS-plus (or SDSplus or SDS+), SDS-Top and SDS-max. SDS-plus is the most common by count of tools manufactured, with masonry drills from 4 mm diameter to 30 mm (and from 5/32\" to 1-1/4\") diameter ordinarily available. The shortest SDS-plus masonry drill bits are about 110 mm overall length, and the longest 1500 mm. SDS-max is more common for larger rotary hammers and chipping guns, and common sizes start at diameter up to diameter. Standard lengths are . SDS-Top has been largely phased out in North America and is not common except for older tools. Hilti's TE-S system is similar to these SDS systems, but is designed for chipping only (no rotation) in tools for applications larger than could be handled by SDS-Max (e.g. demolition of concrete walls or floors).\n\nThe SDS bit was developed by Hilti and Bosch in 1975. The name comes from the German \"Stecken – Drehen – Sichern\" (Insert – Twist – Secure). In German-speaking countries the back-formation \"Spannen durch System\" (Clamping System) is used, though Bosch uses \"Special Direct System\" for international purposes.\n\n\nThe triangle shank is almost always made by machining three flats on round bar stock. It is intended as a minor modification of a straight shank, still allowing it to be held in a 3-jaw drill chuck, but allowing higher torque transmission and limited slipping.\n\nThe Morse taper twist drill bits pictured right are used in metalworking. The full range of tapers is from 0 to 7.\n\nThe Morse taper allows the bit to be mounted directly into the spindle of a drill, lathe tailstock, or (with the use of adapters) into the spindle of milling machines. It is a self-locking (or \"self holding\") taper of approximately 5/8\" per foot that allows the torque to be transferred to the drill bit by the friction between the taper shank and the socket. The tang at the end of the taper is only for ejecting the drill bit from the spindle, with the aid of a drift.\n\nThe arbor of a drill chuck is often a Morse taper and this allows the chuck assembly to be removed and directly replaced with the shank of a Morse taper drill bit. A range of sleeves may be used to bring the size of the smaller Morse tapers up to the size of the drive spindle's larger taper. Sockets are also available to extend the effective length of the drill as well as offering a variety of taper combinations.\n\nThe detail image shows a Morse taper shank on a 16 mm diameter drill bit.\n\n\nSquare taper drills were also used for large ratchet drills, for drilling large holes, or in thick plate. These bits would fit straight into a ratchet drill, and the ratchet drill would be used against a strong arm, for pressure to push the drill into the work piece.\n\nSome drills, wire wheels, etc. use a threaded shank. One example is cylindrical wire wheels meant to be pushed into a pipe of some sort to clean the inside of the pipe, but some ordinary, but mostly rather large, wood drills have threaded shanks as well.\n\nSmall (about diameter) threaded drill bits and countersinks are common in aircraft metal work. Threaded drill bits may be held in drills meant to reach into very tight spaces, and threaded countersink cutters are widely used (along with finely adjustable depth stops) to create holes which put a matching rivet directly flush with the surface.\n"}

{"id": "2117962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117962", "title": "Olof the Brash", "text": "Olof the Brash\n\nOlof was a king who, according to a late source, ruled in Denmark in about 900 after usurping power. Evidence for his historicity is only circumstantial, since he belongs to a period of Danish history when very little is known from textual sources.\n\nOur only source for the reign of Olof is the ecclesiastic chronicle of Adam of Bremen (c. 1075). Adam's information is allegedly drawn from an interview with the Danish king Sweyn Estridson (1047-1076) who \"enumerated his forefathers\". Towards the end of the 9th century Danish Viking armies suffered a series of major defeats in the Frankish kingdoms and in England. This resulted in a serious loss of manpower. Frankish chronicles are silent about political conditions in Denmark in this period and up to the 930s, which contrasts with the rather regular information in the period 777-873. This possibly implies that no strong royal power existed during these decades. After the death of the Viking rulers Sigfred and Gudfred at Leuven in 891, Denmark was, according to Adam of Bremen, ruled by a certain Helge. Then the kingdom was attacked by an intruder named Olof, coming from the land of the Swedes. Olof conquered the land and made himself king. No further details of his reign are given, except that he founded the House of Olof which reigned for three generations. He had numerous sons, of whom Gnupa and Gyrd were able to gain the throne after the death of their father. Later on the dynasty ended with Sigtrygg Gnupasson who is mentioned on the two Sigtrygg Runestones (DR2 and DR4) erected by his mother after his death. Sigtrygg was ousted by Hardeknud I who inaugurated the Jelling Dynasty.\n\nSince Gnupa is mentioned in a chronicle as having ruled in 934, Olof's reign probably falls in the early 10th century. Although he is not documented by contemporary sources, his son and grandson, Gnupa and Sigtrygg, are mentioned on rune stones, which speaks for his historicity. The passage in Adam's account is often taken to mean that there was a period of Swedish rule in Denmark or part of Denmark. A number of arguments have been put forward to support this, including the existence of a rune stone in Saedinge on Lolland that mentions Swedes. Archaeologists have also wished to identify a Swedish population element in Hedeby. The placement of the rune stones associated with the dynasty has led to the conclusion that the kings ruled from Hedeby in South Jutland, one of the most important commercial centers in Viking Age Scandinavia. However, these conclusions have been hotly debated. Adam does not actually say that Olof was Swedish, only that he operated from a Swedish base. Moreover, Adam depicts the kings of the Olof Dynasty as ruling Denmark in its entirety and not merely South Jutland.\n\nThe epitet Olof the Brash, which is sometimes used, is based on a speculative association of Olof with the legendary Ale (Olo) the Brash who, according to Saxo Grammaticus (c. 1200) was sent by his cousin Hring of Sweden to rule Skåne and later the rest of Denmark.\n\n"}

(SMPH) is an integrated property developer and a subsidiary of SM Investments Corporation. It was incorporated on 6 January 1994 to develop, conduct, operate and maintain the SM commercial shopping centers and all businesses related thereto, such as the lease of commercial spaces within the compound of shopping centers. It went public on July 5, 1994, and subsequently grew to become the largest company listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange in terms of revenue. The company's main sources of revenues primarily include rental income from mall and food courts, as well as from cinema ticket sales and amusement income.\n\nThe roots of SM date back to the 1950s when entrepreneur Henry Sy, Sr. established a shoe store at Carriedo Street in Quiapo, Manila. His store was established as ShoeMart, which was originally located at Carlos Palanca Sr. Street. His aggressive and adamant strategy helped him gain large profits within a few years and he later expanded his business to become a fully functioning department store named ShoeMart, which specializes in the sale of shoes, the sector of which the store originally was. ShoeMart was abbreviated into SM, the name which became commonly known by the locals. The abbreviation SM has become an orphan initialism. The first ShoeMart outlet was abandoned and the department store moved to a new site along the nearby Carriedo Street. The old site was demolished in 1982 and was turned into its Clearance Outlet.\n\nThe first SM Mall, the SM City North EDSA, was opened in 1985. Followed by the establishment of a second mall, the SM Centerpoint, in 1990. Since then, the company has expanded by establishing malls nationwide.\n\nOn May 17, 2013, SM opened the SM Aura Premier. The same year, the company announced a merger with SM Land, which owns SM Development and Commercial Properties Group. As a result, upon approval by Securities and Exchange Commission, SM Prime is one of the largest property companies in the Southeast Asia region, competing with Gokongwei-led Robinsons Land (which owns Robinsons Malls and Tan-led Megaworld Corporation).\n\nSM Supermalls is a chain of shopping malls with over 60 malls in the Philippines, and seven in China. According to the company, the malls attract an average foot traffic of 3.5 million daily and has over 5,000 tenant partners.\n\nSM Development Corporation (SMDC) is a wholly owned subsidiary and the real estate arm of SMPH. The company was constantly being criticized for having too small unit cuts, which can be as small as 15 square meters, and the delays of giving out titles to unit owners. Cost-cutting measures (value engineering) were done to maximize profits from its residential projects.\n\nSM Prime and BDO was sued for fraud and tax evasion by the Cebu city government, led by Mayor Tomas Osmeña, because SM Prime grossly misrepresented the total area size of SM Seaside City Cebu to reduce its tax declarations.\n\n"}

Kotsay spent the summer of 1994 playing for the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League. In , Kotsay won the Golden Spikes Award and was the Most Outstanding Player of the College World Series, as CS-Fullerton won its third Series championship. In addition to being an outfielder, Kotsay was a closer in college; he pitched the final five outs to clinch his team's CWS title. Kotsay was a consensus choice as an All-American in 1995 and 1996.\n\nKotsay was selected by the Florida Marlins as the 9th pick of the 1996 Major League Baseball Draft.\n\nKotsay appeared in 14 games for the Florida Marlins in before taking over as the team's center fielder in . He was moved to right field after Gary Sheffield was traded, a position better suited for the strong throwing arm which Kotsay regularly showed off. As a rookie, he led all National League outfielders with 20 assists, and led them again in his second year with the same number. In , he led all right fielders with 13 assists. At the plate, Kotsay was an average hitter during these years, hitting around .280 with occasional power and the occasional stolen base.\n\nKotsay was traded in , barely a week before Opening Day, to the San Diego Padres as part of a deal for Matt Clement and Eric Owens. Moved back to center field, Kotsay improved his hitting, but he recorded only four outfield assists. This can be largely attributed to the fact that few chose to run on Kotsay. Over the next two seasons, however, Kotsay was defensively back on form, leading all National League center fielders in that category. Kotsay hit .291 with a .807 OPS in 2001 and .292 with a .810 OPS in . After his batting average slipped to .266 with a .726 OPS in , Kotsay was traded to the Oakland Athletics for Terrence Long and Ramón Hernández.\n\nWith Oakland in , Kotsay batted a career-best .314 hitting second in the A's lineup. Displaying his customary strong arm afield, he led American League center fielders with 11 assists.\n\nOn July 9, , the Athletics announced that Kotsay and the team had come to terms on a three-year, $29 million contract extension. The extension kept Kotsay under contract with the Athletics through the season and included a no-trade clause through the season. News of the contract extension ended speculation that Kotsay would be traded to a team in need of a starting center fielder, such as the New York Yankees.\n\nOn Mother's Day, May 14, 2006, Kotsay was one of more than 50 hitters who brandished a pink bat to benefit the Breast Cancer Foundation. He was one of a handful of players to hit a pink bat home run.\n\nThe 2006 season marked Kotsay's first-ever appearance in a postseason game, as the Oakland Athletics clinched the 2006 AL West Division title. On October 4, he hit his first postseason home run against Minnesota Twins pitcher Dennys Reyes for a two run inside-the-park home run which scored Jason Kendall that put the Oakland A's ahead 4 to 2, leading his team to win Game 2 of the ALDS.\n\nKotsay underwent back surgery during spring training , and missed the first two months of the 2007 campaign.\n\nOn January 14, 2008, after passing a physical, Kotsay was officially traded to the Atlanta Braves along with $5.3 million of his $7.3 million salary from the Athletics for Joey Devine and prospect Jamie Richmond.\n\nOn August 14, 2008, Kotsay became the first Atlanta Brave to hit for the cycle since Albert Hall did it in . He doubled to right in the 7th inning against Bob Howry of the Chicago Cubs. The double that completed the cycle was also Kotsay's 1,500th career hit. He would hit another single in the 9th inning to have his third career 5-hit game and first since 2005. However, despite the great effort, the Braves lost to the Cubs 11–7.\n\nOn August 27, , Kotsay was traded to the Boston Red Sox for minor league outfielder Luis Sumoza.\n\nKotsay quickly became the Red Sox's preferred first baseman after third baseman Mike Lowell was lost for the season due to injury and Kevin Youkilis was moved to third. Supplanting Sean Casey, he was the regular first baseman throughout the playoffs. He finished the Sox regular season batting .226/.286/.345 in 84 at-bats, and he batted .250/.250/.325 in the playoffs. Despite the poor totals, he was frequently referred to throughout 2008 as someone who hit baseballs hard right at someone, a hard-luck hitter.\n\nOn January 15, 2009, Kotsay signed a one-year deal to return to the Red Sox. He underwent back surgery to remove a displaced disc in February 2009 but did not miss significant time.\n\nOn July 24, 2009, Kotsay was designated for assignment by the Red Sox to free up a roster spot for newly acquired Adam LaRoche.\n\nOn July 28, 2009, Kotsay was traded to Chicago White Sox for minor league outfielder Brian Anderson and cash considerations. On November 5, 2009, he was re-signed by the White Sox for a one-year, $1.5 million deal. In 2010, Kotsay appeared in 107 games, primarily as a designated hitter and first baseman, hitting .239/.306/.376.\n\nOn February 1, 2011, Kotsay agreed to sign a one-year contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. The contract was worth $800,000 plus $450,000 in incentives.\nKotsay served as a utility player, mostly as a reserve outfield and pinch hitter.\n\nIn 2011, he batted .270 with 3 home runs in 233 at-bats.

He made his regular season debut on April 17, 2012. He had another stint on the disabled list in May with a lower back strain. On August 12, 2012, Kotsay signed a one-year extension to stay with the Padres through 2013 for $1.3 million. Kotsay was hitting .275/.333/.363 with 1 HR and 9 RBI in 55 games before the deal. Kotsay made 26 starts in the field and had 51 appearances as a pinch hitter, batting .259/.314/.357 overall. His 13 pinch-hits tied him for second in the Major Leagues.\n\nIn 2013, Kotsay made 23 starts in the field at the corner outfield spots and first base but appeared in 104 games, mostly as a pinch hitter. He finished the season hitting .194/.253/.226 in 155 at-bats. On September 14, Kotsay announced he would retire after the 2013 season. Kotsay was honored in a special ceremony in his final home game at Petco Park on September 26.\n\nIn 1,914 games over 17 seasons, Kotsay posted a .276 batting average (1,784-for-6,464) with 790 runs, 353 doubles, 48 triples, 127 home runs, 720 RBI, 98 stolen bases, 554 bases on balls, .332 on-base percentage and .404 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .989 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions and first base. In 26 postseason games, he hit .207 (17-for-82) with 9 runs, 2 home runs, 3 RBI and 5 walks.\n\nKotsay joined the Padres front office in 2014 as a special assistant.\n\nOn December 1, 2014, the Padres announced Kotsay as their new hitting coach, replacing Phil Plantier.\n\nOn November 12, 2015, the Oakland Athletics named Mark Kotsay their new bench coach, replacing Mike Aldrete. In 2017 he became the quality control coach for the Oakland Athletics.\n\nIn 2019, Kotsay was inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nKotsay and his wife Jamie have three children.

With the essay, anthropologist David Graeber attempts to outline areas of research that intellectuals might explore in creating a cohesive body of anarchist social theory.\n\nGraeber posits that anthropology is \"particularly well positioned\" as an academic discipline that can look at the gamut of human societies and organizations, to study, analyze and catalog alternative social and economic structures around the world, and most importantly, present these alternatives to the world.\n\nOne of the most striking suggestions in the pamphlet challenges the traditional anarchist notion of aggressive confrontation with the state. Graeber did postgraduate work with tribal cultures in Madagascar, including one with the Tsimihety in the northwest of the country. The Tsimihety, rejecting all governmental authority and organizing their society along very egalitarian lines, were able to continue their autonomy and culture for decades on end, up to the present, not by confronting the government, \"but by retreating\". Graeber writes,\nTo this day they have maintained a reputation as masters of evasion: under the French, administrators would complain that they could send delegations to arrange for labor to build a\nroad near a Tsimihety village, negotiate the terms with apparently cooperative elders, and return with the equipment a week later only to discover the village entirely abandoned—every single inhabitant had moved in with some relative in another part of the country. (p. 55)\n\nIn particular, Graeber suggests several areas a hypothetical anarchist anthropology would need to tackle, and in the book elaborates on each point briefly:\n\n\nGraeber offers several possibilities why anthropologists are reluctant to come out and make normative judgments and proposals: \"In many ways, anthropology seems a discipline terrified of its own potential. It is, for example, the only discipline in a position to make generalizations about humanity as a whole—since it is the only discipline that actually takes all of humanity into account, and is familiar with all the anomalous cases.\" (p. 96) Anthropologists, Graeber writes, may be also simply afraid of being dismissed as \"utopian.\"\n\nPart of the problem, Graeber claims, is that traditionally, academics on the radical left have gravitated toward the more \"High Theory\"-oriented Marxism (Karl Marx himself was a PhD) rather than the more practice-oriented anarchism. Graeber further claims: \"1. Marxism has tended to be a theoretical or analytical discourse about revolutionary strategy. 2. Anarchism has tended to be an ethical discourse about revolutionary practice\" (p. 6).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2117999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117999", "title": "Peter Casserly", "text": "Peter Casserly\n\nPeter Casserly (28 January 1898 – 24 June 2005) was, at age 107, the last surviving member of the 1st AIF serving in France in the First World War. At the time of the death, he was believed to be the oldest living Australian man, and his marriage to Monica Delgado was also believed to be Australia's longest.\n\nCasserly was born in Perth, Western Australia. His father, who was born in Australia, but of Irish descent, had moved to Western Australia in search of gold; but ended up working for the railways and on the wharves, barely earning enough to put food on the table for his eleven children.\n\nCasserly attended the Christian Brothers College in Perth until he left school at thirteen to become a blacksmith's apprentice, and was working at the blacksmith's when World War I broke out. In 1917, he was working as a fireman for the West Australian Railways when he saw a recruiting advert by the Australian army for experienced railwaymen to serve in France, and he enlisted on Saint Patrick's Day.\n\nCasserly was sent to a training camp in Melbourne before leaving for France. When his troop carrier, the Ascanius, was moored off Fremantle, he was refused permission to say goodbye to his mother, so he sent her a message in a bottle, which was found and sent to her.\n\nOn arrival in France, he was sent to the Somme, where he served as an armed guard with the 2nd Transport Unit. The trains to and from the battlefront were subject to frequent bombardment from the Germans. Casserly served with the 2nd, 5th and 16th Railway Transport Units in Belgium and France. He also served as a sapper supporting Australian and British forces fighting in Ypres, Armentières and Amiens.\n\nCasserly was court-martialled on 18 May 1918 on a charge of \"When on active service, using violence to his superior officer in that he 'in the field' on 5 May 1918 violently assaulted Sgt A.G. Riddie\". He was found guilty of the charge and was sentenced to 12 months 'IHL' ('In Hard Labour'). He was admitted to No. 1 Military Prison in France on 5 June 1918. On 15 October 1918, the remainder of his sentence was suspended, and he rejoined his unit.\n\nAfter the ceasefire, Casserly was involved in cleaning up until his discharge on 11 September 1919. After the war he made a decision never to serve in the armed forces again. He only attended two Anzac Day marches in his life – in 1917 and in 2004 when he was driven as the guest of honour.\n\nAfter the war, Casserly returned to Fremantle where he worked as a wharf labourer, timber worker, seaman, and fisherman. He started his own timber yard, then established a cray fishing service. Casserly won a Royal Humane Society bravery award for saving a man from drowning.\n\nIn 1923, Casserly married Filipino-born Monica Delgado. The couple had two sons, Eddie and Peter Jr. The couple were married for eighty years until Monica's death in 2004. The marriage is believed to be Australia's longest nuptial union. The couple lived for many years in the White Gum Valley near Perth in a home that Casserly built himself. After they both became centenerians, the couple moved into the Craigville Gardens in Melville, Western Australia.\n\nHe was awarded the 80th Anniversary Armistice Remembrance Medal in 1999, and was part of a contingent of surviving veterans to tour the Western Front in 1993. Although fifty Australian servicemen received the Légion d'honneur, Casserly did not because of the previously mentioned court-martial. John Howard presented him with a Centenary Medal in 2001 in honour of the one-hundredth anniversary of Australian Federation.\n\nCasserly died in Perth on 24 June 2005. He was survived by his son, Peter, seven grandchildren, fourteen great-grandchildren and four great-great-grandchildren.\n\nWhen asked about the secret to a long life, he replied: \"Keep on breathing, I suppose.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118004", "title": "Basketball moves", "text": "Basketball moves\n\nBasketball moves are generally individual actions used by players in basketball to pass by defenders to gain access to the basket or to get a clean pass to a teammate to score a two pointer or three pointer.\n\nDribbling is bouncing the ball continuously with one hand at a time without ever holding the ball. Dribbling is necessary in order to take steps while possessing the ball. Once a player picks up their dribble (stops it by holding the ball), they may not dribble again until they pass, shoot, or otherwise lose possession of the ball and the ball touches a different player or the rim or backboard.\n\nIn a Crossover, the ball handler changes the ball from one hand to the other using a single dribble. The is a fundamental dribbling technique in basketball used to keep the ball in the hand farthest from the defender (preventing a steal) while maintaining a desired speed and orientation on the court. It is very efficient when executing a drive. Make the crossover, get around your defender, and drive to the basket. A crossover functions best when the ball handler looks and acts like they are headed in one direction, before crossing over to the other direction. This can often be achieved by a simple head fake, or a step in that intended direction. Some of the players famous for their crossover dribble include Tim Hardaway, Allen Iverson, Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry, and Kobe Bryant.\n\nThis is a commonly used variation of the crossover in which the ball-handler bounces the ball off of the floor between his/her legs and catches it with the other hand on the opposite side of his/her body. It is used as a safer way to cross over while directly facing a defender, but requires more slowing of forward momentum than the crossover dribble.\n\nThis advanced form of crossover involves the ball handler, bouncing the ball off of the floor behind his feet and catching it with the other hand, usually while his/her feet are no more than shoulder-width apart. If there are no defensive players around the ball handler except one directly facing him/her, and that defender does not expect this type of dribble, it can be an even safer way of crossing over compared to a between-the-legs. In all other cases, it is generally a dangerous move that can result in the ball bouncing off of the dribbler's feet or a steal.\n\nThis dribble is especially useful for when the offensive player is really close to their defender and needs to change dribble hands, but doesn't have space to use a regular crossover.\n\nThe wraparound is similar to a behind-the-back except; instead of the ball being thrown in a sideways direction and bouncing behind the ballhandler's back, it is swung further around the back and thrown in a forward direction, bouncing on the side or in front of the ballhandler's body. This move is mostly used when a defender lunges toward one side of the ballhandler's body for a steal. The ballhandler would then simply throw the ball around his body and quickly pass his defender.\n\nAn in and out dribble is widely used as a counter move to a crossover, whereby the ball handler fakes the crossover, and pushes the ball back out on the same hand.\n\nBall is dribbled with same hand in a V motion. Almost looks like a double crossover but ball stays in hand.\n\nThis technique involves dribbling the ball in different heights. This is usually combined with other dribbling techniques to make it more effective. It is mostly effective on players smaller or taller than the dribbler but not quite as much on players that are the same height as the dribbler. If you are facing a shorter opponent, you can lure them by pretending to bring the ball low and then suddenly turning the ball very high. If the opponent is taller than you, you can lure them by pretending to bring the ball high and quickly lowering the height of the dribble. If your opponent does not bite on your lure/trap, maintain the height of your dribble, and you can drive past them with more speed. If you're going to pass or shoot after your dribble, make sure that you will go back to your usual pace to maintain the momentum for your dribbling.\n\nThis is when an offensive player does a move that makes their defender stumble to the ground. Players' collapsing due to this rarely occurs under normal circumstances. Typically this happens when a defender loses balance, trips over their own feet, or even slips. An offensive player can't consistently control whether the defender falls, but using speed, body momentum, body contact and sharp changes of direction make it much more likely to happen.This move usually embarrasses the defender \n\nThe player makes a dash posture but does not actually apply force on the foot for one moment, and then dash full speed.\n\nThe Euro step (sometimes \"Eurostep\") is a move developed in European basketball in which a player, after picking up his dribble, takes a step in one direction, and then quickly takes a second step in the other direction before they attempt a layup. It is an attempt to evade at least one defender before attacking the basket.\n\nŠarūnas Marčiulionis, a Lithuanian, and Manu Ginóbili, an Argentine who arrived in the NBA from the Italian league, are credited with bringing the move to the NBA. It has since been widely used by many US-born players, such as Dwyane Wade, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook\n\nThe combination of a euro step and a jump-stop, the pro-hop is a move in which a player picks up their dribble with a synchronized right hand dribble/right foot step, or a synchronized left hand dribble with left foot step. The player then rips the ball to the opposite side of their body while landing on a jump-stop. The pro hop's ability to split defenders, or throw an opposing defender off rhythm through 'change of direction speed' is a move popularized by Shantay Legans, former point guard for University of California at Berkeley.\n\nThe Pro-hop Euro Step combines the pro-hop and Euro step while removing the pro-hop's jump stop. The player picks up their dribble with a synchronized right hand dribble/right foot step, or a left hand dribble with left foot step. Player then rips the ball to opposite side of their body (behind the back if skilled), takes two steps, and finishes with a reverse layup.\n\nThe power up is a move in which the player lands on their outside foot then inside foot, and powers up toward the basket. An effective move because of its balance and power resulting from a two-foot gather and take off.\n\nThe over-the-head move is a move in which the player rotates the ball over their head in a circular fashion. This is done as the player is stepping to one side of the defender, while trying to get past him/her at the same time. It is essentially used as a way to prevent the ball from getting stolen. It is typically used when driving to the basket, and on fast breaks.\n\nA layup is a two-point attempt made by leaping from the ground, releasing the ball with one hand up near the basket, and using one hand to tip the ball over the rim and into the basket (lay-in) or banking it off the backboard and into the basket (lay-up). The motion and one-handed reach distinguish it from a jump shot. The layup is considered the most basic shot in basketball.\n\nAn undefended layup is usually a high-percentage shot. The main challenge is getting near the rim and avoiding blocks by taller defenders who usually stand near the basket. Common layup strategies are to create space, releasing the ball from different spots or using an alternate hand. A player tall enough (or with sufficient leaping ability) to reach over the rim might choose to perform a more spectacular and higher percentage slam dunk (dropping or throwing the ball through the basket from above the rim) instead.\n\nAs the game has evolved through the years, so has the layup. Several different versions of the layup are used today. Layups can be broadly categorized into two types: the underarm and the overarm. The underarm layup involves using most of the wrist and the fingers to 'lay' the ball into the basket or off the board. The underarm layup is more commonly known as the finger roll. A notable NBA player who uses the underarm finger roll is Dwyane Wade.\n\nFinger-rolls today have many forms, including the Around the World which involves a complete circle around the player before the layup and a variety of faking in the approach to the rim. A classic example is a play by former Kings point guard Jason Williams during his time with Sacramento, in which Williams brings the ball behind his back with his right hand, in a fake of a back pass, and then brings it front again with the same hand for the finish (reminiscent of Bob Cousy who pioneered the move).\n\nThe other layup is the overhand shot, similar to a jump shot but from considerably closer range. Overhand layups almost always involved the use of the backboard. Players like Scottie Pippen and Karl Malone have used this move to great effect.\n\nIn addition, another variation of the lay-up is the wrong-foot layup. Typically, this move can be seen by inexperienced players with poor footwork, however, when done intentionally, a wrong-footed layup can deceive a defender into mistiming his block attempt. In a normal layup, the left foot is used to step off when laying in with the right hand, and vice versa. However, in a wrong-footed layup, the right foot is used to step off when laying in with the right hand. This also helps to shield the defender from reaching across to block the shot; in reaching across however, the defender will likely get called for a defensive foul. Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs relies heavily on the wrong footed layup, largely due to his smaller size and deceptive quickness.\n\nA reverse layup is a layup that is finished on the opposite side of the court's split-line, than the player began the attack on.\n\nA finger roll is performed when a player shoots the ball with one hand during a layup and then lifts his fingers, rolling the ball into the basket. The rotation produced provides the ball with a soft touch, and the ball will roll around the rim and then drop into the basket. Guard George \"The Iceman\" Gervin was known for having one of the best finger rolls in the game along center Wilt Chamberlain. Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen are other notable practitioners, while former NBA star Jason Kidd is renowned for his smooth finger rolls as well.\n\nThe tear drop, also called a runner or a floater, is a high arcing shot over the reach of taller defenders in the lane. The shooter typically begins with a layup drive, stops short of layup range, and attempts to shoot before defenders can recover. By releasing the ball quickly and in a higher arc than a normal layup, the tear drop can be effective for shorter players to avoid blocked shots. It is so-named because the ball drops down from the high point of the arc like a falling tear drop. Gary Payton and John Stockton during their primes, the former in the mid-to-late 90s and the latter in the early-to-mid 90s were considered to have the best tear drops in the game. Chris Paul, Tony Parker, and Stephen Curry frequently use the tear drop with great success. Antawn Jamison had one of the most highly effective tear drop shots in the league despite being a power forward. Ben Gordon, Juan Carlos Navarro, Steve Nash, Rajon Rondo, J.J. Barea, and Derrick Rose are currently known for the tear drop move.\n\nPower layup, also called jump stop layup, is a continuous shooting move in which a player stops dribbling and makes a huge leap forward(jump stop), while securing the ball in both hands from the dribbling hand, then making a layup. The move is generally used as a layup because the huge movement coming from the leap provides the momentum for the player to jump forward for a layup. The move is a great way to squeeze the player under the basket for a fast layup.\n\nA double clutch is a move associated with a layup or a dunk; it is a change of ball position in mid-air (similar to the \"up and under\" move, but performed while the player is in the air). It is effectively used by many players.\n\nA \"bank shot\" in basketball is a shot that relies on the ball bouncing off the backboard and into the basket. It is frequently used for mid-range jump shots from around a 45° angle and layups. It is not commonly used for long-range shots or shots from the middle or near the baseline. The purpose of using the backboard is to try to hit the backboard at an angle, thus slowing the speed of the ball and increasing its chances of falling into the hoop. Researchers at North Carolina State University found that bank shots may be 20 percent more effective up to a distance of about 12 feet than direct shots. Another term for a bank shot is \"off the glass.\" NBA players known for using the bank shot often are Sam Jones, George Gervin, Tim Duncan, Dwyane Wade, Dirk Nowitzki, Scottie Pippen, and Kobe Bryant.\n\nA putback describes a situation where a player secures an offensive rebound, then immediately scores a basket. If the player secures the rebound while in the air, for the shot to be considered a putback, the player can land on the ground before shooting, but cannot dribble before taking the shot. If the player does not secure the rebound but instead taps the ball into the basket, it is considered a tip-in. There is a point where the difference between a putback and a tip-in is subjective (e.g., a one-handed rebound in the air followed by a shot before touching the ground). A putback jam is a spectacular alternative to the tip-in, where the ball is slam-dunked off the rebound in the same motion. Bill Russell would use this move during his college days in the mid-1950s Josh Smith and Kenyon Martin are more recent users of the putback jam. It is also a primary source of scoring for All-Star center Dwight Howard, who led the NBA in dunks in the 2008–2009, 2009–2010 and 2010–2011 seasons.\n\n\"Triple threat\" is the position when a player facing a defender receives a pass but has not dribbled yet. The offensive player's feet are slightly wider than shoulder width and slightly on the balls of their feet, their knees flexed, with both hands on the basketball in front of them or almost resting on their thigh, presenting the defender with an opponent able to move in any direction. One foot is held as the pivot and the other slightly ahead. From this, the player can choose from three options: to jump-shoot, to dribble (drive) past the defender or to pass it to a teammate. There are also options to get the defender out of their defensive stance by using jab steps and pump fakes.\n\nPivoting is the act of rotating one's body while keeping the ball of one foot in place on the floor. Most of the player's balance should be on the pivot foot while slightly raising the heel in order to pivot on the ball of the foot. Pivoting can be done with or without the ball as it is an important tool to quickly change direction or orientation to the basket.\n\nA jab step, also known as \"side step,\" is performed when a player holds onto the ball before dribbling while his non-pivot leg performs a jabbing forward or side motion. This move is used to test defender's defensive weaknesses and stance. A combination of the pump fake, the drive, the shot and the crossover drive can be performed along with the jab step to lure the opponent out of his defense. Forward Carmelo Anthony is well known for taking the jab step, as was 13-year pro Kiki Vandeweghe. When the player does this, the defender falls off from their defensive stance, creating a space between the player and the defender, allowing them to take a quick mid-range jumper, a three-pointer, or a drive \"to the lane.\"\n\nA pump fake (also called a shot fake) is a feigned attempt at a jump shot, restrained before the feet leave the ground. The pump fake is a fundamental move in basketball, used to cause defenders to jump (known in basketball slang as \"lifting\" the defender) or be shifted off-balance. Its main applications are in the low post area, where a player is much more likely to have his or her shot blocked. On the perimeter, it is useful in creating open lanes to the basket by \"showing\" the ball enough to entice a defender to attempt to block or steal it, allowing the dribbler to penetrate easily. Michael Jordan, Kawhi Leonard, Kobe Bryant, and Dwyane Wade are known masters of the pump fake, with Leonard and Jordan being known to frequently use the one hand pump fake variation.\n\nAn offensive move intended to produce a foul call on the defensive player. A typical strategy is to drive into a defensive player whose feet are not stationary. When the two players make bodily contact, a blocking foul can be called on the defensive player. If the defensive player has a set position (i.e., both feet are stationary and arms are not in a downward motion), the contact can result in a charging foul against the offensive player (this is known as \"taking the charge\" for the fouled defensive player). Another way of drawing contact is to pump fake and then jump towards the defender, make contact and then shoot; this gets you to the foul line. If you make the basket (often made in the paint), you get the basket and one foul shot. Players like DeMar DeRozan, James Harden, Kobe Bryant, Damian Lillard, and Dwyane Wade have mastered the art of drawing contact.\n\nThis move is similar to the jab step, but smaller. It is when a player uses multiple very little jab steps to throw off a defender and keep him constantly guessing whether you will go to the basket or not. It was used frequently by former San Antonio Spurs forward Tim Duncan.\n\nTo \"post up\" is to establish a position in the low post, the area near the basket below the foul line, usually in order to take advantage of a smaller defender. The offensive player usually faces away from the basket, so that his body can protect the ball from the defender. From this position, options such as spinning or backing down the defender to close in to the basket for better scoring opportunities become available.\n\nThe up and under is a move consisting of two parts: a shot fake (the up) and a step-through (the under). First the player with the ball fakes a shot by thrusting the ball above his head as if to take a shot, then when the defender jumps in an attempt to block the shot, the offensive player steps by him and attempts a clear, unguarded shot.\n\nGenerally used by post players, Hakeem Olajuwon and Kevin McHale were considered masters of this move.\n\nThe hook shot is one of the most effective inside moves, but it is also quite difficult to execute. A hook shot begins when the player puts his body between the ball and the opponent. He then releases the ball towards the basket with his outside hand in a \"hook\" motion. The hook shot and variations such as the jump-hook and skyhook are effective because they are very difficult for the defender to block, although it is harder to hit the shot with precision. The advantage the hook shot offers is the space it creates between the offensive player and his defender. This extra space can reduce or eliminate the advantages enjoyed by a taller defender. The hook shot is most often used by post players because it is difficult to make the shot from a distance. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar became the NBA's all-time leading scorer by using his almost indefensible skyhook.\n\nAlso called a \"reverse pivot\", the drop step is a move in which the player posting up takes a back step on the side of a defender behind him and spins to that side to gain leverage.\n\nThe power move is executed by pivoting towards the basket to seal the defender, then using a two handed power dribble followed by a jump stop to get closer to the basket. Immediately after the jump stop the player jumps up for a power shot or jump hook.\n\nWhen the offensive player receives the ball in the low post, the player either fakes in one direction and then spins in the opposite direction, or immediately after catching the ball, the player spins around the defender and goes up for the shot or takes one hard dribble and then takes the shot.\n\nNamed after Jack Sikma, the post player receives the ball with their back to the basket and keeps the ball at forehead level. The post then pivots to face the basket while bringing the ball overhead (almost behind the head) to shoot a jump shot. The ball is released high over the head making it difficult for the defense to block.\n\nNamed after Hakeem \"The Dream\" Olajuwon, this move is executed when a post player dribbles alongside the baseline and with one hand under the ball fakes a layup, then pivots to the outside for a jump hook. If the defender recovers and jumps at the hook shot, the post player can pump fake the hook and step through for the unguarded layup (similar to the up and under move).\n\nA pull-up jumper is an offensive move, where the ball handler in the act of dribbling, 'pulls up' to shoot the basketball. This is especially effective as the defender is not able to react in time to affect or block the shot. This move is widely used by many players in the NBA, including notable stars such as Jerry West, DeMar DeRozan, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and LeBron James.\n\nWhen a player posts up, in order to shoot he has to turn around to face the basket. This can be done by turning in the air, timing the jump shot when the defender is not likely to jump and challenge the shot. Though a fade-away version of this move was perfected by Larry Bird and Dirk Nowitzki, players such as Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Kevin Garnett are also well known for it.\n\nA fadeaway shot is a variation on a set jump shot in which the shooter attempts his shot leaning backward, creating the effect of \"fading away\" from his defender. This makes it more difficult for the defender to contest the shot. The fadeaway usually has less range than a regular jump shot, because the ball has backwards momentum due to its inertia, making it somewhat tougher to project the ball over long distances. Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Reggie Miller, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, Dirk Nowitzki, Karl Malone, Steve Nash, and DeMar DeRozan are famous for their use of the fadeaway. Wilt Chamberlain was criticized for his frequent use of the fadeaway jumper, since the follow-through usually carries the shooter away from the basket and out of rebounding position.\n\nThe shooter takes a quick jab step away from the basket and takes a normal jump shot. Stephen Curry, James Harden and Luka Doncic are famous for their step-back jumper. The move creates space for the shot, while providing more balance than the fadeaway.\n\nThe bounce pass is a fundamental and very effective passing technique. This pass consists of one player passing the ball to a teammate by bouncing the ball off the floor. Because the ball will be at ground level as it passes a defender, a successful bounce pass can easily result in a scoring assist because a bounce pass is harder for defenders to steal. Still, a bounce pass may be stolen due to its slower speed. So, a player must use his best judgment when he decides whether to make such a pass.\n\nThis pass is performed best by stepping towards your target with one foot, then throwing the ball out towards their chest with two hands while turning the hands over, ending with the thumbs pointing down. It is best used in an open court and on the perimeter.\n\nAn over the head pass is another fundamental passing technique. It is used by snapping the ball over the head, like a soccer throw-in. This pass is especially effective in helping to initiate a fast break. After a defensive rebound, a well-thrown overhead, or outlet, pass can allow a breaking offensive player to quickly score without even dribbling by catching the ball near the basket.\n\nA touch pass is an advanced passing technique in which a prior pass or a loose ball is immediately redirected to another player by tipping or slapping the ball. This is the quickest pass in basketball and is therefore very effective when executed correctly.\n\nThe baseball pass is a long pass in which the passer throws the ball with one hand, as if it were a baseball or a football. It is infrequently used, mainly to set up last-second plays off a baseline inbounding situation.\n\nA jump pass is a pass performed while the passing player's feet are off the floor. When done intentionally, usually when a teammate gets open during the shot, it can sometimes confuse the defender, causing him to believe that the passer is shooting instead of passing. At times, however, it is done as a result of the player having their shooting lane blocked and often leads to the player turning the ball over to the opposing team. This kind of pass is risky to execute, and the chances of perfectly passing the ball to an open teammate are considerably low, as it leaves the offensive player very vulnerable to turnovers.\n\nAlso known as a \"no-look pass\", the blind pass is performed when a player looks in one direction but passes the ball to his target in another direction. Blind passes are risky and infrequently attempted, but when done correctly, they can confuse the defense. The no-look pass has been popularized by players such as Magic Johnson, Isiah Thomas, Stephen Curry, Pete Maravich, Larry Bird, Jason Kidd, Rajon Rondo, Michael Jordan, John Stockton, Ricky Rubio, Jason Williams, and Steve Nash. Šarūnas Jasikevičius also frequently used it during his glory years in the EuroLeague.\n\nBehind-the-back passes are passes dealt to a target behind the passer's back. Usually done to confuse the defender, behind the back passes can either be bounced off the floor or passed directly to a teammate's chest. However, most behind-the-back passes are direct. Earl Monroe was famous for this move. Steve Nash used this move often, and Chris Webber is famed for using this move down in the paint.\n\n\"Give and Go\" is an offensive play that involves passing the ball (give) and then running (go) to an open spot to receive the ball back, usually near the basket, for an easy score. This play can be effective when the defender pays too much attention to the ball instead of the player who moves after passing the ball. This is also known as a \"One-Two\" in street ball.\n\nThe dribble pitch or the handoff, is an offensive play, whereby the ball-handler passes to a player (often a bigger player) and runs by him to collect the ball, whilst the big sets a screen.\n\n\"Pick and Roll\" is an offensive play in which a player stops to screen (block) a defender for the teammate handling the ball and then slips behind the defender to accept a pass as the handler makes a move towards the basket. In the NBA, John Stockton and Karl Malone were a quintessential pick and roll tandem and used this play to great effect in the 1990s. Steve Nash and Amar'e Stoudemire proved to be extremely effective at the pick and roll throughout the 2000s. Kyrie Irving and LeBron James and Blake Griffin and Chris Paul were considered among the best contemporary pick and roll tandems.\n\nFrom the initial position of the pick and roll maneuver, the player who receives the ball has many different options as to whether he/she passes it, or fakes and then goes for a jump shot.\nThese variations typically include the pick and pop, where by the roll man instead of heading to the basket trails behind and is wide open for a jumper, hence the 'pop', as well as slipping the screen, whereby the defender of the screener attempts to cheat and get ahead of the screener, at which point the screener does not set a screen, but merely slips by, leaving him open as his defender trails behind.\n\nA backdoor play is when a player without the ball gets behind the defense and receives a pass for an easy score. This can be executed if the defenders are unaware of the open space behind them. Also, when a defender strongly commits on defense (e.g. tries to steal or deny a pass), they are vulnerable to a backdoor play.\n\nAn alley-oop is an offensive play which involves one teammate lofting the ball up near the rim in anticipation of another teammate jumping up to catch and dunk it. Because this move requires both teammates to know what the other is thinking, the alley-oop is a rare and exciting play. The alley-oop first dates back to the mid-1950s when K. C. Jones and Bill Russell teamed up to perform it while they were college teammates. Point guard Chris Paul, and big men Blake Griffin, and DeAndre Jordan, were known for their spectacular alley-oops. For that, they earned the name \"Lob City\". Another notable duo known for using this play is LeBron James and Dwyane Wade during their time at the Miami Heat.\n\n"}
{"id": "2118006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118006", "title": "Mach tuck", "text": "Mach tuck\n\nMach tuck is an aerodynamic effect whereby the nose of an aircraft tends to pitch downward as the airflow around the wing reaches supersonic speeds. This diving tendency is also known as \"tuck under\". The aircraft will first experience this effect at significantly below Mach 1.\n\nMach tuck is usually caused by two things, a rearward movement of the centre of pressure of the wing and a decrease in wing downwash velocity at the tailplane both of which cause a nose down pitching moment. For a particular aircraft design only one of these may be significant in causing a tendency to dive, delta-winged aircraft with no foreplane or tailplane in the first case and, for example, the Lockheed P-38 in the second case. Alternatively, a particular design may have no significant tendency, for example the Fokker F28 Fellowship.\n\nAs an aerofoil generating lift moves through the air, the air flowing over the top surface accelerates to a higher local speed than the air flowing over the bottom surface. When the aircraft speed reaches its critical Mach number the accelerated airflow locally reaches the speed of sound and creates a small shock wave, even though the aircraft is still travelling below the speed of sound. The region in front of the shock wave generates high lift. As the aircraft itself flies faster, the shock wave over the wing gets stronger and moves rearwards, creating high lift further back along the wing. This rearward movement of lift causes the aircraft to tuck or pitch nose-down.\n\nThe severity of Mach tuck on any given design is affected by the thickness of the aerofoil, the sweep angle of the wing, and the location of the tailplane relative to the main wing.\n\nA tailplane which is positioned further aft can provide a larger stabilizing pitch-up moment.\n\nThe camber and thickness of the aerofoil affect the critical Mach number, with a more highly curved upper surface causing a lower critical Mach number.\n\nOn a swept wing the shock wave typically forms first at the wing root, especially if it is more cambered than the wing tip. As speed increases, the shock wave and associated lift extend outwards and, because the wing is swept, backwards.\n\nThe changing airflow over the wing can reduce the downwash over a conventional tailplane, promoting a stronger nose-down pitching moment.\n\nAnother problem with a separate horizontal stabiliser is that it can itself achieve local supersonic flow with its own shock wave. This can affect the operation of a conventional elevator control surface.\n\nAircraft without enough elevator authority to maintain trim and fly level can enter a steep, sometimes unrecoverable dive. Until the aircraft is supersonic, the faster top shock wave can reduce the authority of the elevator and horizontal stabilizers.\n\nAll transonic and supersonic aircraft experience Mach tuck.\n\nRecovery is sometimes impossible in subsonic aircraft; however, as an aircraft descends into lower, warmer, denser air, control authority (meaning the ability to control the aircraft) may return because drag tends to slow the aircraft while the speed of sound and control authority both increase.\n\nTo prevent Mach stall from progressing, the pilot should keep the airspeed below the type's critical Mach number by reducing throttle, extending speed brakes, and if possible, extending the landing gear.\n\nA number of design techniques are used to counter the effects of Mach tuck.\n\nOn both conventional tailplane and canard foreplane configurations, the horizontal stabiliser may be made large and powerful enough to correct the large trim changes associated with Mach tuck. In place of the conventional elevator control surface, the whole stabiliser may be made moveable or \"all-flying\", sometimes called a stabilator. This both increases the authority of the stabilizer over a wider range of aircraft pitch, but also avoids the controllability issues associated with a separate elevator.\n\nAircraft that fly supersonic for long periods, such as Concorde, may compensate for Mach tuck by moving fuel between tanks in the fuselage to change the position of the centre of mass to match the changing location of the centre of pressure, thereby minimizing the amount of aerodynamic trim required.\n\nA Mach trimmer is a device which varies the pitch trim automatically as a function of Mach number to oppose Mach tuck and maintain level flight.\n\n The fastest World War II fighters were the first aircraft to experience Mach tuck. Their wings were not designed to counter Mach tuck because, research on supersonic airfoils was just beginning; areas of supersonic flow, together with shock waves and flow separation, were present on the wing. This condition was known at the time as compressibility burble and was known to exist on propeller tips at high aircraft speeds. \n\nThe P-38 was the first 400 mph fighter, and it suffered more than the usual teething troubles. It had a thick, high-lift wing, distinctive twin booms and a single, central nacelle containing the cockpit and armament. It quickly accelerated to terminal velocity in a dive. The short stubby fuselage had a detrimental effect in reducing the critical Mach number of the 15% thick wing center section with high velocities over the canopy adding to those on the upper surface of the wing. Mach tuck occurred at speeds above Mach 0.65; the air flow over the wing center section became transonic, causing a loss of lift. The resultant change in downwash at the tail caused a nose-down pitching moment and the dive to steepen (Mach tuck). The aircraft was very stable in this condition making recovery from the dive very difficult. \n\nDive recovery (auxiliary) flaps were added to the underside of the wing (P-38J-LO) to increase the wing lift and downwash at the tail to allow recovery from transonic dives.\n"}
{"id": "2118020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118020", "title": "Peter Celsing", "text": "Peter Celsing\n\nPeter Elof Herman Torsten Folke von Celsing (January 29, 1920 – March 16, 1974) was a Swedish modernist architect.\n\nCelsing was born in Stockholm, Sweden and was the son of bank executive Folke von Celsing and Margareta (née Norström) and brother of diplomat Lars von Celsing (1916–2009). \n\nHe studied at the architectural school of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, and at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. Celsing has been the assistant of the widely known Swedish architect Sigurd Lewerentz. According to Adam Caruso, it was Celsing that helped Lewerentz to win the design competition for the Church of St. Mark (\"Markuskyrkan\"). This building and the later St. Petri Church (\"Olaus Petri kyrka\") are now known as a starting point of brutalist architecture.\n\nHe later became professor of architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology. After working for some time in Beirut, he became head of the architectural office of AB Stockholms Spårvägar, the Stockholm tram and local railway authority, and designed a number of suburban metro stations. He also designed several churches: in Härlanda (Gothenburg), Almtuna (Uppsala), and Vällingby, a much-publicized modernist suburb of Stockholm.\n\nCelsing often worked in a brutalist style with large exposed grey concrete surfaces, but occasionally combined this with large glass panes exposing the structure of the building from the outside, and interior details in wood. The best known examples of this are the \"Kulturhuset\" (House of Culture) at Sergels torg in central Stockholm (1966–1971), the adjacent headquarters of the Bank of Sweden (1969–1973) the \"Filmhuset\", the house of the Swedish Film Institute in Stockholm (1968–1970), and his addition to Carolina Rediviva, the main building of the Uppsala University Library (1953–1962). In Uppsala, Celsing also designed a new wing for the Stockholms nation building (begun in 1961), and the current \"Ekonomikum\" building at Uppsala University (completed 1976).\n\nThe cultural center Kulturhuset (begun 1966, inaugurated 1974; the western part including the theatre was completed in 1971) is from most angles dominated by its concrete structure, with the adjacent theatre building having a façade of stainless steel, but from the front by its glass façade and the thin lines of the concrete floors, giving the impression of a number of shelves open towards the open place outside, Sergels torg. It is located in a part of Stockholm where the old structure of the city, the old architecture and even the topography was almost entirely replaced in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s with modernist architecture and new functions, mainly finance and large-scale retail businesses. The reaction against this development has been very strong, and many planned building and traffic projects had to be stopped from the 1970s and later as a result of the public opinion against what largely was, and continues to be, regarded as a significant loss of irreplaceable cultural values.\n\nKulturhuset was intended as a \"cultural oasis\" in this new city of commerce, with an open library in the bottom floor, a large theatre, and space for exhibitions in the rest of the building; the original intention was for the Stockholm Museum of Modern Art to occupy large parts of the building, but the museum dropped out of the project in 1969. As the flagship building of the city centre redevelopment, it has, perhaps unfairly, become the target of much of the anger against the whole redevelopment project. Already in 1970, one critic, Claes Brunius, noted in \"Expressen\" that \"Stockholm is building the largest vacuum in the country\". The public opinion against the project may have been strengthened by the fact that the Kulturhuset and the interconnected Stockholm City Theatre were used as a temporary parliamentary building for several years, but as such the structure won the prestigious Kasper Salin Prize in 1972.\n\nOne of his last buildings is the Bank of Sweden (Sveriges Riksbank) building at Brunkebergstorg in Stockholm, the design of which is dominated by the use of cubes, squares, spheres and circles, all intended to give the impression of stability. It makes use of thick slabs of roughly hewn dark granite in the façade, thus borrowing from the renaissance tradition of using rustication to give the impression of solidity and particularly from the 19th century neo-renaissance practice of using rustication in bank buildings for this purpose. The Bank of Sweden had since 1907 been located to a semi-circular building on Helgeandsholmen, but moved to Celsing's building in 1976. (The older building was combined with the adjacent Parliament House as a new parliamentary building, where the parliament returned after its years in exile in Celsing's Kulturhuset.)\n\nIn 1948, he married Birgitta Dyrssen (1922–2004). Their son, Johan Celsing, has become noted as an architect of public buildings since the 1990s, and one of his buildings won the Kasper Salin Prize in 1999.\n\n\n"}

The argument in favor of the bill was that it would allow parents more choices in how they choose to educate their disabled children. The move alarmed teachers and parents of students at OSB, who realized that it could force closure of the state school in the future. They testified before the committee about how vital the specialized services and teachers were to their students whole lives, and noted that charter schools did not have, and probably could not afford such facilities and services. Their arguments were so persuasive that the bill failed to pass in the committee.\n\nAn article by Tim Willert, published by the \"Oklahoman\" in November 2015, described concerns about the leadership of the school, particularly those expressed by parents of blind students. The Department of Rehabilitation Services Executive Director, Joe Cordova, had removed Superintendent Jim Adams in May, 2015, and hired Christine Boone, a noneducator and the wife of Doug Boone, the agency's director of visual services. Cordova told Adams that, \"... the agency wanted to go in a different direction.\n\nThe specific issue apparently is that Cordova expressed dissatisfaction with outcomes for students after they have left high school. He says he has years of data showing that these graduates neither get good quality jobs nor do well in higher education. Cordova said he and Adams disagreed over how to improve this. Governor Mary Fallin asked her general counsel, Steve Mullins, to intercede in the dispute, which had generated a large public outcry. After interviewing the main players, Mullins said that this was due to differing views of two organizations devoted to the cause of blind children: National Federation of the Blind (NFB) and American Council of the Blind (ACB).\n\nOn February 1, 2016, Joe Cordova announced that he had selected Christine Boone as the permanent superintendent of the school. However, that did not settle the controversy, and some state legislators brought the matter to Governor Fallin. The controversy over school direction resulted in Joe Cordova's rescinding Boone's appointment and submitting his own resignation in early February, 2016. Noel Tyler was named executive director of the Department of Rehabilitation Services. Larry Hawkins, who had previously served 11 years as superintendent of the school, was hired to return as interim superintendent, effective March 1, 2016. It was the first major move made by Tyler as interim director.\n\n"}

A three-time All-EuroLeague selection with Tau Ceramica, he signed with the Houston Rockets in 2007, and was voted to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. Later on, he played for the Phoenix Suns, Indiana Pacers, Toronto Raptors and Brooklyn Nets.\n\nScola has been a regular member of the Argentina national team since 1999, that won an Olympic gold team medal in 2004, and a bronze team medal in the 2008 Summer Olympics. He was honored as the national flag bearer at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nScola started his career with the Buenos Aires youth teams of Ferro Carril Oeste. He made his professional debut with the same club's pro team in the Argentine league during the 1995–96 season, at the age of 15.\n\nAfter the 1997–98 basketball season in the Argentine League, Scola moved to Spain and signed with Saski Baskonia. He was loaned to Gijón Baloncesto, where he helped the then Spanish League Second Division club achieve promotion to the Spanish League First Division. He then was loaned back to Gijón through the 1999–2000 season, before arriving at Baskonia, where he played for seven seasons.\n\nWith Saski Baskonia, Scola reached the EuroLeague Finals in the 2000–01 season, and three consecutive EuroLeague Final Fours, between 2005 and 2007. His outstanding performances earned him an All-EuroLeague Second Team selection in 2005, as well as two All-EuroLeague First Team selections in 2006 and 2007.\n\nAlthough Scola did not win the EuroLeague championship with Baskonia, he did win with them every major Spanish League title, winning a Spanish ACB League championship in 2002, three Spanish King's Cups in 2002, 2004, 2006, and three Spanish Supercups in 2005, 2006, 2007.\n\nIn the summer of 2005, the San Antonio Spurs of the NBA (who drafted Scola in 2002), attempted to negotiate with Baskonia to buy out his contract. After throwing around numbers as large as US$15 million, Baskonia settled on a number of over $3 million for the buyout of the contract. This made it difficult for Scola to join fellow Argentina national team member Manu Ginóbili in San Antonio, because of the NBA's rule which limits teams to paying no more than $500,000 of a player's buyout. Scola would have been responsible for paying Baskonia the remaining $2.5 million amount of the buyout. When the deal to buy out Scola's contract fell through, the Spurs instead signed an Argentine national team teammate and friend of Scola's, Fabricio Oberto.\n\nOn July 12, 2007, the Spurs traded the rights to Scola, along with center-forward Jackie Butler, to the Houston Rockets, in return for Vassilis Spanoulis, a future second-round draft pick, and cash considerations. He signed with the Rockets soon after and his US$3.2 million buyout was completed a few days later. Scola signed a three-year contract with the Rockets, at a salary of $9.5 million. Scola placed third in the NBA 2007–08 Rookie of the Year Award voting and he was also named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. On March 13, 2010, he scored a career high 44 points against the New Jersey Nets.\n\nOn the afternoon of December 8, 2011, the day before the 2011 NBA lockout ended and players could move between teams, the Rockets, the Los Angeles Lakers and the New Orleans Hornets agreed to a trade that would have sent Scola, along with Goran Dragić, Kevin Martin, and Lamar Odom to the Hornets. In exchange, the Rockets would have received Pau Gasol, and the Lakers would have received star point guard Chris Paul. That night, after other team owners voiced their opposition, league commissioner David Stern nullified the trade.\n\nOn July 13, 2012, he was waived by the Rockets using the league's amnesty clause to provide salary cap relief. It was widely noted, however, that Scola was not cut due to a lack of performance; rather, the deal was an attempt to clear cap space for the Rockets to trade for former Orlando Magic All-Star center Dwight Howard. Howard was instead traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, but the Rockets used their cap space to gain former Oklahoma City Thunder Sixth Man of the Year shooting guard and Olympic gold medalist James Harden.\n\nOn July 15, 2012, Scola was claimed off amnesty waivers by the Phoenix Suns. Reportedly, the Dallas Mavericks and the Cleveland Cavaliers were also interested in acquiring him during the amnesty process. On November 21, 2012, he was relegated to playing off the bench for the first time in his NBA career since the start of his rookie season. He regained his starting spot less than a month later, and on December 29, he scored a season-high 33 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves. While Scola did become a leader for the Suns, he finished the season with declining averages, as his 12.8 points per game were his lowest since the 2008–09 season.\n\nOn July 27, 2013, the Suns traded Scola to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Gerald Green, Miles Plumlee, and a future second round draft pick. In his two seasons for the Pacers, he played a back-up power forward role to David West as he started just 18 games over his two-year stint.\n\nOn July 15, 2015, Scola signed with the Toronto Raptors. He made his debut for the Raptors in their season opener on October 28, recording eight rebounds while taking no field goal attempts in a 106–99 win over the Indiana Pacers. He helped the Raptors make the Eastern Conference Finals in 2016 for the first time in franchise history.\n\nOn July 13, 2016, Scola signed with the Brooklyn Nets. He made his debut for the Nets in their season opener on October 26, scoring eight points in a 122–117 loss to the Boston Celtics. On February 27, 2017, he was waived by the Nets.\n\nOn July 9, 2017, Scola signed with the Shanxi Brave Dragons of the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nOn August 10, 2018, Scola signed with the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nOn 29 September 2019, Olimpia Milano head coach, Ettore Messina, during the press conference of the 2nd round match of the 2019–20 LBA season lost against Germani Basket Brescia, announced that Scola had signed with the team for the rest of season.\n\nWith Argentina's junior national teams, Scola won the gold medal at the 1995 South American Cadet Championship, the gold medal at the 1996 South American Junior Championship, the gold medal at the 2000 FIBA Americas Under-20 Championship, and the bronze medal at the 2001 FIBA Under-21 World Cup.\n\nAs a member of the senior Argentina national team, Scola has won several medals: the silver medal at the 1999 South American Championship, the bronze medal at the 1999 FIBA Americas Championship, the gold medal at the 2001 FIBA Americas Championship, the silver medal at the 2002 FIBA World Championship, the silver medal at the 2003 FIBA Americas Championship, the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics, the silver medal at the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship, the bronze medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics, the bronze medal at the 2009 FIBA Americas Championship, the gold medal at the 2011 FIBA Americas Championship and the bronze medal at the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship among other titles. At the 2015 FIBA Americas Championship tournament, Scola became the all-time leading scorer in FIBA AmeriCup history, and won his 4th tournament MVP.\n\nScola broke two records of the Argentina national team at the FIBA World Cup, during the 2010 edition: top overall scorer for Argentina at a World Cup (beating Ernesto Gehrmann's 331 points) and most points scored for Argentina in one game at a World Cup (scoring 37 against Brazil in the round of 16, therefore beating Alberto Desimone's 35 points scored against Mexico in 1963).\n\nIn 2019, at 39 years old, he was part of the team that won the gold medal at the Pan American Games. At the 2019 FIBA World Cup, he scored 135 points and 57 rebounds in the seven matches en route to the final.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScola and his wife, fellow Argentine Pamela, have four children together. He also holds a Spanish passport.\n\nHe was a golden ambassador for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires when he was named in July 2017.\n\n"}
{"id": "2118035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118035", "title": "Uniscope", "text": "Uniscope\n\nUniscope was a class of computer terminals made by Sperry Rand Corporation, Univac Division, and successors since 1964 that were normally used to communicate with Univac mainframes. As such, it was the successor to various models of Teletype. Due to the text color on the original models, these terminals are informally known as \"green screen terminals\".\n\nUnlike Teletype terminals, the Uniscope minimizes the number of I/O interrupts required by accepting large blocks of data, and uses a high speed proprietary communications interface, using coaxial cable and hardware devices known as multiplexors. A Uniscope operator awaits a prompt from the remote mainframe. The prompt indicates that the mainframe is ready to receive input. The operator enters data, offline from the mainframe, and then presses the Transmit button. The terminal locks the keyboard and sends to the mainframe what the operator entered. All the data goes in a single transmission and that causes a single interrupt at the mainframe. Eventually, the mainframe responds, sometimes with a single line; other times with a screen-load of data. And the cycle repeats.\n\nUniscope was a registered trade mark for a set of Sperry Univac dumb terminal products. The trademark was applied for October 13, 1969. Several models were produced: the Uniscope 100, Uniscope 200, Uniscope 300, the UTS 400, the UTS 10, the UTS 20, the UTS 30, the UTS 40 and the color UTS 60. The UTS 10, UTS 20, UTS 30, UTS 40 and the color UTS 60 were \"intelligent terminals\" powered by 8-bit microprocessors. There was also the UTS 4000 cluster controller and terminal line, and the SVT-1120. Various models supported 16x64, 12x80, and 24x80 display formats. The UTS 4000 line had a COBOL compiler available that made it possible to do local processing in the cluster controller, and the UTS 60 was also capable of being programmed. This line of terminals roughly paralleled the similar IBM product, the IBM 3270. The UTS-400-TE was specialized terminal that had a powerful text editing program burned into firmware intended at first to allow for the editing of simple copy such as that for a newspaper, and later adapted as a prototype word processor with 8-inch floppy disks and letter-quality daisy wheel printers.\n\nAll members of the Uniscope product line used a variant of the Binary Synchronous Communications protocol. Groups of terminals were generally dropped off a common communications line via a multiplexer (mux) and identified by \"remote identifier\" and \"station identifier\" symbols. Some terminals may have been equipped with peripheral devices such as printers and recording devices (cartridge tape or floppy disk) which were identified on the communications line by a device identifier. Terminals on a drop were sequentially polled for traffic, sometimes with a general poll to which any terminal with traffic could respond. A fairly complex data presentation protocol permitted application programmers to format a screen for any number of business purposes. For example, fields could be defined that would accept only numeric or alpha-numeric characters. Some fields could not be changed by the terminal operator. A protocol extension permitted programmers to specify color for each field and lines on the borders of each cell (underline, or vertical bars, etc.) The Uniscope display protocol, while proprietary, roughly parallel the ANSI X3.64 standard (\"additional controls for use with American national standard code for information interchange\").\n\nThe color UTS 60 terminal using two Motorola processors arrived on the market at about the same time as desktop computers with EGA monitors. The general consensus was that the UTS60 was over-engineered and overpriced for the emerging market. Eventually emulation software for the Uniscope line running on desktop computers ended manufacturing of Uniscope hardware. Screen size of the original Uniscope 100 was 12 X 80 or 16 x 64 characters. All letters were in capital. Each character was individually drawn as a series of splines using technology developed for displays in military cockpits. Later Uniscopes supported a 24 X 80 screen using raster technology, and upper and lower case characters. There were versions that had the various national code sets for different European countries to enable pound signs, and various accented characters, etc. There were also versions that had Katakana code sets for Japanese.\n\nUnisys developed the INFOConnect terminal emulators for PCs that included use of the Uniscope protocols in the early 1990s. There continue to be vendors that sell terminal emulators for these machines.\n\n\n"}

The extension was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in March 1998, on her visit to Flintshire.\n\nIn 2007, the school's headmaster, Mr M.C. Powell retired after over 25 years of teaching; his role was taken over by Mr R.J. Davies, who previously held the role of Headteacher at a secondary school in Wrexham. The school retained a rating of \"Good\" in its 2009 Estyn inspection with \"Excellent\" prospects for future improvement. Mr P.

It is a testimony to the accurate scientific outlook of the ancient Agawa people in the cycle of weathers, agriculture, and heavenly bodies.\n\nBesao is politically subdivided into 14 barangays.\n\n\nThe population of the town has been decreasing due to younger generations migrating to cities seeking for work.\n\nBesao's main religion is animism. The town is one of the few animist towns in the southern Cordillera mountains. Much of its ancestral worship intangible heritage has been preserved by the older generations. However, the younger generations have been migrating to cities, making the animist religions of Besao in great danger in the long-term.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nBontoc is the historical capital of the entire Cordillera region since the inception of governance in the Cordillera. The municipality celebrates the annual Lang-ay Festival.\n\nBontoc is home to the Bontoc tribe, a feared war-like group of indigenous people who actively indulged in tribal wars with its neighbours until the 1930s. Every Bontoc male had to undergo a rites of passage into manhood, which may include head hunting, where the male has to journey (sometimes with companions) and hunt for a human head. The Bontocs also used the jaw of the hunted head as a handle for gongs, and as late as the early 1990s, evidence of this practice can be seen from one of the gongs in Pukisan, Bontoc. The town also hosts the UNESCO tentatively-listed Alab petroglyphs.\n\nSamuel E. Kane, American supervisor and then Governor, established the capital here after the Philippine Commission passed the Mountain Province Act in 1908, building a provincial building, hospital, doctor's office, nurse's home, a school, and provincial prison. He also built the Tagudin-Bontoc trail, which by 1926, could accommodate a small car.\n\nBontoc is politically subdivided into 16 barangays.\n\nMost inhabitants speak the Bontoc language, with other major languages being Kankana-ey and Ilocano. Minor languages spoken include Tagalog, Pangasinan, Cuyonon and Butuanon.\n\nThe local economy depends largely on small trades and agriculture. This capital town's biggest economic potential is tourism with its smaller rice terraces in Barangay Bay-yo, Maligcong and other areas.\n\nThe highland town of Bontoc is home to two National Cultural Treasures of the Philippines. These are the Stone Agricultural Calendar of Bontoc and \"Petroglyphs of Alab\".\n\nThe Alab petroglyphs are ancient figures carved on mountain walls by the prehistoric people of Bontoc. The petroglyphs are the most important ancient rock art carvings in the Cordilleras and the second oldest in the entire country, second only to the Angono petroglyphs of Rizal. Due to its high significance, it was submitted by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts of the Philippines to the UNESCO Tentative List of Heritage Sites in 2006, pending its inclusion in the World Heritage List along with the Singanapan charcoal-drawn petrographs of southern Palawan, Angono petroglyphs of Rizal province, charcoal-drawn Penablanca petrographs of Cagayan, and the Anda red hermatite print petrographs of Bohol.\n\nThe Bontoc people have their own indigenous religion that has been preserved for centuries. They believe in a unique pantheon of deities, of which the supreme god is the cultural hero, Lumawig, son of Kabunian. There are many sacred sites associated with Lumawig and a variety of Bontoc deities. Oral tradition tells that Lumawig instilled five great lessons to the Bontoc people, namely: (1) a man must not steal; (2) one should not gossip; (3) men and women must not commit adultery; (4) one must be temperate in eating and in drinking alcoholic drinks; and (5) all people must live simple and industrious lives.\n\nMountain Province State Polytechnic College is the first tertiary institution in the municipality that offers various undergraduate and graduate courses.\n\nXiJen College of Mountain Province is the only private tertiary institution that also offers technical-vocational courses.\n\n"}

The barangays are geographically isolated by high (700m) mountains covered in jungle. It has a total land area of around 20 000 hectares.\n\nNatonin is politically subdivided into 11 barangays.\n\n\nThe natives of the town are generally called Balangaos/ Iferangao who speak the Finerangao language. There are two sub-tribes namely Hakki who inhabit the western part of the town and the Majukayyongs who inhabit the Barangays of Saliok and Maducayan. The Majukayyongs initially came from Southern Kalinga. Populations of the town are of Igorot lineage. Headhunting was practiced in throughout Natonin as late as the mid-1930s, and was set aside in favor of Christianity and education after World War II.\n\nThe town is home to two indigenous languages which have been existing in the town even before the arrival of the Spanish. These languages are the \"Balangaw\" dialect and the \"Kinalinga\" dialect. Immigrants from the Ilocos Region came in the 1970's and imported the \"Ilokano\" dialect during the martial law era.\n\nThe primary crop is rice, although a lack of arable land, lack of mechanization and no access to fertilizers limits the harvest to a subsistence level only. Families rely on small livestock populations to supplement the diet. Fruits and wild coffee are harvested from the forest. Poblacion boasts of numerous family ponds which raise tilapia for consumption. Due to the terrain, rice is planted on terraced fields. Locals consider the rice terraces of Natonin to be equal or surpassing those of Banaue to the south.\n\nTransportation throughout Natonin is largely undeveloped roads. The only paved roads (as of 2007) are in Poblacion proper. Roads frequently become impassable in the rainy seasons. Some barangays (notably Maducayan) are inaccessible by road. Maducayan lies one mile beyond a recent road extension from the center of Saliok to the westernmost situ of Saliok.\n\nNatonin have the following tourism sites:\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nParacelis' population distribution is 37 percent urban and 63 percent rural. Urban settlement is on the west side of the town, a basin of low-level hilly-to-flat lands surrounded by mountains.\n\nDue to hilly terrain, Paracelis has numerous zigzag roads in most parts, including access roads that connect the municipality to other border towns. On both sides of its zigzag roads, travelers can view the vast cornfield plantations alongside.\n\nParacelis is a border town of Mountain Province where it shares borders with Kalinga, Isabela and Ifugao provinces. In the north, its borders with the city of Tabuk and the town of Tanudan. In the south, it is bordered by Alfonso Lista. In the north-east, it shares a border with Quezon, in the east with Mallig and Roxas in Isabela. In the west, it borders with Natonin.\n\nParacelis is politically subdivided into 9 barangays: \n\n\nParacelis was first settled by the Ga'dang (Gaddang) ethnic group, who were migrants from Cagayan Valley mountain range. They are the ascendants of the present Baliwon tribe living in the periphery of the mountains of Paracelis. Through the years, Paracelis has become the main entry point to the rest of Mountain Province.\n\nThe name Paracelis came into existence as early as the 1900s as part of the territorial barangays of Natonin within the District of Kalao. Paracelis used to be part of Natonin and it became a regular town named Paracales with the enactment of Republic Act 3488 on June 16, 1962. The town was renamed Paracelis on June 18, 1966 under Republic Act 4738. The first appointed mayor was Benito Rafael.\n\nThe first official site of the civil government was at Nattalongan, now currently within Barangay Bantay. The pre-World War II government was short-lived and administration lasted under three local managements from 1917-1921. There is a historical gap from this decade up to post-World War II.\n\nIn 1962, the government center at Nattalongan was transferred to Anangka within the Rafael compound. The site was again transferred to a lot in Marat donated by the Gawan family. In 1991, the official of the municipal government transferred the government center to its present site in Poblacion. The government used to occupy a 1-hectare lot that housed all the units.\n\nToday, Paracelis has become a melting pot of migrants from different areas, such as the Balangao, Madukayans, Kalinga, and Ifugao tribes including Ilokanos. This migration has been instrumental on the fast rising urbanization of Paracelis in the last two decades. The town's current administration is introducing urbanization plan for the municipality.\n\nThe town of Paracelis is home to two indigenous languages, the \"Balangaw language\" and the \"Ga'dang language\" (completely different from the Gaddang language found in Nueva Vizcaya, Isabela, and Aurora). The Balangaw language is found in most towns in Mountain Province, while the Ga'dang language is found only in a small section of Paracelis, making it an endangered language. Both languages are vital to the culture and arts of the town. Ilocano is also spoken as the regional dialect.\n\nThe municipality of Paracelis depends on agriculture as its main engine of growth with vast plantation of corn. The town also produces vegetables, oranges and timber. Trade activities include the commerce of basic consumer goods.\n\nThe municipal government is planning to pursue real estate development and tourism as its next engines of growth. The town is pursuing tourism since it possesses scenic terrains of hills and slopes ideal for nature lovers and hikers. Its vast low terrains is ideal for real estate development.\n\nPotential economic activities of the town in manufacturing is canning and feed mill production due to availability of basic raw material from its vast cornfields. Its location at the crossroad makes Paracelis a future trading hub in the Eastern Cordillera Growth Corridor, a primary growth center of the Cordillera Administrative Region.\n\nThe only mode of transportation to and from Paracelis are buses and jeepneys plying to Santiago, Baguio City, Tabuk City, Alfonso Lista and Natonin. Going south, it takes approximately 1.5 hours to reach Alfonso Lista and 3 hours to Santiago City from Paracelis. Going north, it takes approximately 2 hours to reach Tabuk City. Going west to Natonin town proper, it takes less than an hour. Currently, there is no road access from the town proper going to Mallig in the east but there is road from its border Barangay Buringal to Mallig.\nas of 2017 there is concreting of the national highway from Butigue, Palitud, Anonat going to Roxas, Isabela\n\nDespite being mandated to host the College of Agriculture of the Mountain Province State Polytechnic College in the northern Barangay Bacarri, the campus is still unrealized due to funding difficulties from the national government. The Paracelis campus of the Mountain Province State Polytechnic College was made through the conversion of Bacarri Agricultural High School, a rural high school in Barangay Bacarri.\n\n8 out of 9 \"Barangays\" in Paracelis have their respective secondary institution. Annex campus of major high schools in different \"Barangays\" were converted into a regular and independent high schools. The list of secondary schools are as follows:\n\nA district hospital serves the people of Paracelis. Recently, the municipal mayor, Avelino C.

The language is highly significant in the Sinadanga culture, making its conservation an utmost importance to the survival of the Sinadanga people's traditions.\n\nSadanga is politically subdivided into 8 barangays.\n\n\nThe town has its indigenous council of elders who make decisions for the indigenous Sinadanga people. The Sinadanga have their own language, called the Sinadanga, which is preserved by the people themselves by using it in homes, schools, and everyday life more than the national language. The Sinadanga language is one of the hardest languages to learn from the Cordilleras. The people also have their own back-strap loom weaving culture, epic chants for planting and harvesting rice, rice terracing practices, indigenous rituals to the gods such as the \"pumatay\" (ritual where pawid stalks are burnt while cooking meat, then the food is served to the gods), and vernacular house architecture. The most prominent tradition of the Sinadanga people is the enforcement of the \"teer\" (day of rest) and closure of the village from visitors. The tradition begins with a meeting of the council of elders within the center of the town. The council negotiates with its members on whether they should close the village or not and when. Once a truce has been made, the elders will drink their traditional wine and one of the elders will announce the decision via public statement, which can be heard throughout the village valley. The tradition is made so that for a period of time, the Sinadanga townsfolk can rest from their traditional work, and can manage to converse and strengthen their bonds with each other through public engagement with their neighbors. The next step after the announcement is made is to establish the \"faya uy\" (long tree stalks) at both sides of the road entrance of the town. The establishment of the \"faya uy\" directly puts the town closure in effect, and thus, negates all visitors from visiting the town. The council of elders inputs a guard at the town's entrance and the \"faya uy\" to protect the town from unwanted visitors. The \"faya uy\" is also the main symbol of the Sindanga's \"teer\". On the imposition of the \"faya uy\", the people are usually seen within the \"taur\" or place of public engagement. The \"faya uy\" is disestablished on a certain day and time as agreed upon by the council of elders.\n\nThe environment of Sinadanga is serene and clear from garbage as cleanliness for the environment is a norm in Sidanga culture. Sinadanga is home to the Fowa-As falls, a sacred water source. Littering and any other form of destruction within the site, and the entire valley in general, is strictly prohibited.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\nIt is adjacent to Bontoc, the provincial capital.\n\nSagada is famous for its hanging coffins. This is a traditional way of burying people that is still utilized. Not everyone is qualified to be buried this way; among other things, one had to have been married and had grandchildren.\n\nPopular activities include trekking, exploring both caves and waterfalls, spelunking, bonfires, picnics, rappelling, visiting historical sites, nature hikes, and participating in tribal celebrations. Guides can be found upon registration at the tourist-office in Sagada Proper (the main town) for a small fee. Most of the guides are natives, also known as Kankanaey.\n\nAccording to legend, Sagada was founded as an \"ili\" or village by Biag, a man from Bika in eastern Abra. The people from Bika were forced out of their \"ili\" by raiding headhunters. Biag's family resettled in Candon, Ilocos but when baptism or the giving of names was enforced, Biag's family chose to move back toward the mountains in search for a settlement. Along the way, he and his siblings decided to part ways. A brother, Balay, chose to return to Candon, a sister to Abra. Another brother settled along the upper Abra River. Biag pushed further to the east until he came to what is now Sagada.\n\nPerhaps for lack of transportation and willing guides, few conquistadors set foot in Sagada during the Spanish Era, and a Spanish Mission was not founded until 1882. As a result, it is one of a few places that has preserved its indigenous culture with little Spanish influence.\n\nSagada is nestled in a valley at the upper end of the Malitep tributary of the Chico River some one and a half kilometers above sea level in the Central Cordillera Mountains, enveloped between the main Cordillera Ranges and the Ilocos Range. Mount Data in the south and Mount Kalawitan in the southeast pierce the horizon. Mount Polis, Bessang and Mount Tirad in the east, and Mount Sisipitan in the north mark the Mountain Province–Abra boundary.\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Sagada features a subtropical highland climate (‘’Cwb’’). The area averages 900 mm of precipitation annually, the bulk of which falls between the months of May and October. Temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the course with average daily temperatures ranging from around 17 to 20 degrees Celsius.\n\nSagada is politically subdivided into 19 barangays. \n\nSeeing that the Roman Catholicism in the Philippines has long been established, missionary Charles Henry Brent mentioned that \"we are not building an altar over and against another altar,\" thus focusing Episcopal missionary activity among the Filipino-Chinese in Manila, the tribes in Mindanao and the tribes of northern Luzon. Since the coming of missionaries from the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States, the municipality of Sagada has become the only Philippine town that is predominantly Anglican with almost 95% baptised into the Episcopal Church of the Philippines (ECP). A known landmark at the centre of town is the Church of St. Mary the Virgin, a vibrant Episcopal parish. In 2004, the ECP celebrated its centennial with much of the festivities centered on the town of Sagada.\n\nSince the climate is similar to those of Benguet, its crops are likewise temperate products such as cabbage, tomatoes, green pepper, potatoes, carrots, beans, and others. Between 1882 and 1896, the Spanish colonizers introduced Arabica coffee: a source of income since the American occupation. Citrus, mainly lemon, lime and Valencia oranges were introduced from Spain by Jaime Masferre to provide the needs of American missionaries and employees of the Mission of Saint Mary the Virgin. During the American Period, the Americans introduced products like strawberries, and peaches due to its cooler, highland rainforest climate.\n\nIn recent years, tourism has also grown to contribute significantly to the local economy. Inns, restaurants, tour guide services, and other tourism-related industries have also grown rapidly. The municipal government also collects significant amounts through the environmental fee it charges each tourist, as well as through the taxes levied on local businesses.\n\nSagada has many natural wonders which includes:\n\nSagada Profile at PhilAtlas.com\n"}

It occurs as incrustations and vein or fracture fillings in ultramafic rocks and serpentinites. It occurs in hydrothermally altered dolomite and marble. It commonly appears in caves as speleothems and \"moonmilk\", deposited from water that has seeped through magnesium rich rocks. It is the most common cave carbonate after calcite and aragonite. It thermally decomposes, over a temperature range of approximately 220 °C to 550 °C, releasing water and carbon dioxide leaving a magnesium oxide residue.\n\nIt was first described in 1836 for an occurrence in Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nStromatolites in an alkaline (pH greater than 9) freshwater lake (Salda Gölü) in southern Turkey are made of hydromagnesite precipitated by diatoms and cyanobacteria.\nMicrobial deposition of hydromagnesite is also reported from playas in British Columbia. The hydromagnesite-magnesite playas near Atlin, British Columbia are some of the most studied deposits of hydromagnesite. These deposits have been characterized in the context of a biogeochemical model for CO sequestration.\n\nOne of the largest deposits of hydromagnesite exists in Greece. It consists of a natural mixture with huntite. Local people have used the white mineral as a source of material for whitewashing buildings for centuries. In the mid 20th century the minerals, ground to a fine powder, found use as a filler for rubber shoe soles. The locals used the granite mills designed for grinding wheat. Commercial exploitation of the minerals began in the late 70s and early 80s with the mineral being exported worldwide. The Greek deposit is still operated commercially, although the world's largest commercially operated reserves are in Turkey.\n\nIts most common industrial use is as a mixture with huntite as a flame retardant or fire retardant additive for polymers. Hydromagnesite decomposes endothermically, giving off water and carbon dioxide, leaving a magnesium oxide residue. The initial decomposition begins at about 220 °C making it ideal for use as a filler in polymers and giving it certain advantages over the most commonly used fire retardant, aluminium hydroxide.\n\nHydromagnesite thermally decomposes in three stages releasing water and carbon dioxide.\n\nThe first stage starting at about 220 °C, is the release of the four molecules of water of crystallisation. This is followed at about 330 °C by the decomposition of the hydroxide ion to a further molecule of water. Finally, at about 350 °C carbon dioxide begins to be released. The release of the carbon dioxide can be further broken down into two stages depending on the rate of heating.\n"}

He was the leader of the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition, which was the first expedition to cross Australia from south to north, finding a route across the continent from the settled areas of Victoria to the Gulf of Carpentaria. The expedition party was well equipped, but Burke was not experienced in bushcraft. A Royal Commission report conducted upon the failure of the expedition was a censure of Burke's judgement.\n\nBurke was born in St Clerens, County Galway, Ireland in May 1821. He was the second of three sons of James Hardiman Burke (1788 – January 1854), an officer in the British army 7th Royal Fusiliers, and Anne Louisa Burke \"née\" O'Hara (married 1817, d.1844).\n\nRobert O'Hara was one of seven children;\n\nJames Thomas Burke was a Lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, and on 7 July 1854 at the battle of Giurgevo became the first British officer killed in the Crimean war.\n\nBurke entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in May 1835. In December 1836 he failed his probationary exam and went to Belgium to further his education. In 1841, at the age of twenty he entered the Austrian army and in August 1842 was promoted to Second Lieutenant in the Prince Regent's 7th Reuss Regiment of the Hungarian Hussars. He spent most of his time in the Imperial Austrian Army posted to northern Italy and in April 1847 was promoted to 1st Lieutenant. Towards the end of 1847 he suffered health problems and went to Recoaro spa in northern Italy, then Gräfenberg (now Lázně Jeseník) and finally Aachen before resigning from the Austrian army in June 1848 after charges against him relating to debts and absence without leave were dropped.\n\nAfter returning to Ireland in 1848, he joined the Irish Constabulary (later the Royal Irish Constabulary). He did his cadet training at Phoenix Park Depot in Dublin between November 1849 and January 1850, was promoted to 3rd Class Sub-Inspector and he was stationed in County Kildare. At the end of 1850, he transferred to the Mounted Police in Dublin.\nBurke migrated to Australia in 1853. He left Queenstown, County Cork on 24 November 1852 on the S.S. \"Rodney\" which was carrying 342 convicts. He arrived in Hobart, Tasmania on 12 February 1853 and promptly sailed for Melbourne. On 1 April 1853 he joined the recently established Victoria police force. Initially, he worked as Acting Inspector under the Chief Commissioner William Henry Fancourt Mitchell in the Parish of Jika Jika in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, but on 1 November 1853 he was appointed a magistrate, was promoted to Police Inspector, and was posted to Carlsruhe. On 31 December 1853 he was promoted to District Inspector of the Ovens District and early in 1854 he moved to Beechworth to relieve Inspector John Giles Price.\n\nAfter the unfortunate death of his brother, James Thomas, in the Crimean War, Burke decided to enlist. He left Australia on the S.S. \"Marco Polo\" on 25 March 1856 for England, but, by the time he arrived in Liverpool in June, peace had been declared and the war ended. Burke re-boarded the \"Marco Polo\" and returned to Victoria, arriving in Melbourne on 2 December 1856.\n\nHe resumed his posting at Beechworth and from there attended the \"Buckland Valley\" riots near Bright against the Chinese gold miners in 1857. In November 1858 he was transferred to Castlemaine as Police Superintendent on £550 p.a. plus a groom and quarters at \"Broadoaks\" on Gingell Street.\n\nAfter the South Australian explorer, John McDouall Stuart had reached the centre of Australia, the South Australian parliament offered a reward of £2,000 for the promotion of an expedition to cross the continent from the south to north, generally following Stuart's route. He also partnered with another explorer who wanted to discover things about Australia.\n\nIn June 1860, Burke was appointed to lead the Victorian Exploring Expedition with William John Wills, his third-in-command, as surveyor and astronomical observer.\n\nThe expedition left Melbourne on Monday, 20 August 1860 with a total of 19 men, 27 camels and 23 horses. They reached Menindee on 23 September 1860 where several people resigned, including the second-in-command, George James Landells and the medical officer, Dr. Hermann Beckler.\n\nCooper Creek, 400 miles further on, was reached on 11 November 1860 by the advance group, the remainder being intended to catch up. After a break, Burke decided to make a dash to the Gulf of Carpentaria, leaving on 16 December 1860. William Brahe was left in charge of the remaining party. The small team of Burke, William Wills, John King and Charley Gray reached the mangroves on the estuary of the Flinders River, near where the town of Normanton now stands, on 9 February 1861. Flooding rains and swamps meant they never saw open ocean.\n\nAlready weakened by starvation and exposure, progress on the return journey was slow and hampered by the tropical monsoon downpours of the wet season. Gray died four days before they reached the rendezvous at Cooper Creek.\nThe other three rested for a day when they buried him.\nThey eventually reached the rendezvous point on 21 April 1861, 9 hours after the rest of the party had given up waiting and left, leaving a note and some food, as they had not been relieved by the party supposed to be returning from Menindee.\nThey attempted to reach Mount Hopeless, the furthest outpost of pastoral settlement in South Australia, which was closer than Menindee, but failed and returned to Cooper Creek. While waiting for rescue Wills died of exhaustion and starvation. Soon after, Burke also died, at a place now called Burke's Waterhole on Cooper Creek in South Australia. The exact date of Burke's death is uncertain, but has generally been accepted to be 28 June 1861.\n\nKing survived with the help of Aborigines until he was rescued in September by Alfred William Howitt. Howitt buried Burke and Wills before returning to Melbourne. In 1862 Howitt returned to Cooper Creek and disinterred Burke and Wills' bodies, taking them first to Adelaide and then by steamer to Melbourne where they were laid in state for two weeks. On 23 January 1863 Burke and Wills received a State Funeral and were buried in Melbourne General Cemetery. On that day Stuart and his companions, having successfully completed the south-north crossing, were received back at a large ceremony in Adelaide.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In tourist terms, however, it is part of the Arlberg region. Lech is administered together with the neighbouring villages of Zürs, Zug, Oberlech and Stubenbach. The municipality is an internationally known winter sports resort on the mountain range Arlberg, catering to the upper classes, particularly to the international Jet set and foreign royalty. The Dutch royal family and Russian oligarchs regularly ski there. Lech am Arlberg is one of the 12 members of the elite „Best of the Alps“ group.\n\nLech was founded in the fourteenth century by Walser migrants from the canton of Wallis in Switzerland.\n\nUntil the nineteenth century it was known as Tannberg, but subsequently the full name \"Tannberg am Lech\" gave rise to the present name Lech.\n\nThe church of St Nicholas in Lech, which is thought to have been built in approximately 1390, was the parish church of the Tannberg administrative district, and there was also a Tannberg district court in Lech until the dissolution of the Tannberg district in 1806.\n\nIn the last decades, the small town has developed into a flourishing municipality by the influence of winter tourism and increasingly, also by summer tourism.\n\nIn recent years Lech has grown to become one of the world's ski destinations and the home of a number of world and Olympic ski champions.\n\nLech is best known for its skiing (both on-piste and off-piste). It is well connected via mechanical lifts and groomed pistes with the neighbouring villages of Zürs, St. Christoph, St. Anton, Stuben, Warth and Schröcken, not least as a result of new lifts introduced for the 2013/14 and 2016/17 seasons, creating the largest connected ski area in Austria and one of the largest in Europe.\n\nTogether these villages form the Arlberg region, the birthplace of the modern Alpine skiing technique and the seat of the Ski Club Arlberg. \n\nLech is also the starting and finishing point for The White Ring, a circle of runs and lifts that is a popular tour and the scene of an annual race involving 1,000 participating ski racers. With its 22 km, it is considered the longest ski circuit in the world.\n\nThe mountain holiday in the movie \"Bridget Jones' Diary 2\" was shot in Lech.\n\nThe ski area Lech-Zürs has been the venue for numerous FIS Alpine World Ski Championship races in the past, including the following:\n\n\nAfter 26 years, alpine ski races will be held again in Lech in November 2020. The races will take place on November 14th and 15th in the Flexenarena Zürs. They will consist of parallel ski races for men and women, as well as a mixed team event.\n\nThere are numerous events happening in Lech. \n\n\nAlthough not as well frequented in the summer as it is in the winter, Lech nevertheless has sporting, cultural, culinary and other activities. There are many premier hotels in Lech, as well as numerous top class restaurants.\n\nOne former well-known visitor was the writer Ludwig Bemelmans (author of the Madeline books), whose 1949 novel \"The Eye of God\" was set in a fictionalised Lech.\n\nLech has a number of points of cultural interest, including:\n\n\n\n\nLech is at the center of the thriller \"An Exchange of Eagles\" by Owen Sela, in which a group of German and American conspirators in 1940 tries to assassinate Adolf Hitler during the dictator's stay at the resort.\n\nIt was one of the filming locations of the 2004 movie \"\" with Renée Zellweger.\n\n"}
{"id": "2118070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118070", "title": "History of New York City (1978–present)", "text": "History of New York City (1978–present)\n\nNew York City has seen a cycle of modest boom and a bust in the 1980s, a major boom in the 1990s, and mixed prospects since then. \nThis period has seen severe racial tension, a dramatic spike and fall of crime rates, and a major influx of immigrants growing the city's population past the eight million mark. The September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 had a lasting impact on the city that continues to reverberate to the present.\n\nCompared to the 1970s, the 1980s were a time of restrained optimism in New York. The boom on Wall Street was fueling the speculative real estate market, and unemployment numbers dropped noticeably. Koch successfully balanced the city's budget ahead of schedule, allowing the city to re-enter the bond market and raise cash, effectively ending the city's financial crisis by 1981. However, the city's reputation for crime and disorder was still very much a part of New Yorkers' daily lives. Mayor Ed Koch repeatedly warned that filth, crime, and racial tensions were weakening the city. He put a high priority on rebuilding neighborhoods and infrastructure. One result was that gentrification brought new businesses to decrepit neighborhoods corners and converted low-end rental housing to co-ops and condos that attracted young upscale professionals and business people. Koch's energetic efforts brought enormous attention from the media, but critics condemned his attacks on his opponents as \"crazy,\" \"wackos,\" and \"radicals\" and alleged he was racially divisive.\n\nFor years enormous attention followed the criminal trials resulted when a woman known as the Central Park Jogger was badly beaten and raped. The illegal drug trade flourished, causing the murder rate to soar, and dividing the city into areas ruled by different drug lords. It became known as the crack epidemic. The New York City Subway fell victim to a crime epidemic that saw more crimes being committed on the subway each year than in any other subway system around the world.\n\nHomelessness became a serious problem during the 1980s, specifically in the last two of Edward Koch's three terms as mayor (1978–1990). The city outlawed discrimination against gay and lesbian people in such matters as employment and housing in 1986. In 1989, Koch was defeated by David Dinkins in the Democratic Party primary in his bid for a fourth term, and then Dinkins narrowly defeated Republican Rudolph Giuliani in the general election to become the city's first-ever black mayor. Crime began a 15-year decline in 1990 during Dinkins's administration, but a combination of continued racial strife (such as that in the Crown Heights Riot in 1991), and an extremely weak economy (in January 1993 the city's unemployment rate reached 13.4 percent, the highest level of joblessness seen there since the Great Depression) caused Dinkins' popularity to seriously decline (including a threat by residents of Staten Island to secede from the city, where in a 1993 referendum, 65% voted to secede, but implementation was blocked in the State Assembly).\n\nOn February 26, 1993, a truck bomb detonated in a basement garage of World Trade Center Tower One. The urea nitrate–hydrogen gas enhanced device was intended to knock the North Tower (Tower One) into the South Tower (Tower Two), bringing both towers down and killing tens of thousands of people. It failed to do so, but did kill six people and injured more than a thousand.\n\nIn late 1993, David Dinkins was defeated by Rudolph Giuliani in his bid for reelection.\n\nThe city rebounded in the mid- and late 1990s due to the steady expansion of the national economy and the Wall Street stock market boom that took place concomitantly, as well as the precipitous drop in crime, although stubbornly high unemployment remained a local problem. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, is credited by many for revitalizing Times Square and making the city more \"liveable\" by cracking down on crime. Changes in the worldwide economy during this time proved to be especially favorable to New York because of its highly developed transportation and communications infrastructure, as well as its massive population base. Over the course of the decade, the city's image transformed from being one of a bygone, decaying metropolis to one of the world's preeminent \"global cities.\"\n\nAs for sports, 1994 saw a great chapter in the city's sports history, with the New York Rangers finally winning their first Stanley Cup since 1940 and the New York Knicks making it to the NBA Finals, where they lost in seven games to the Houston Rockets, at the same time.\n\nThe Knicks made it to the NBA Finals again in , where they lost in five games to the San Antonio Spurs. The New York Yankees began a dynasty led by manager (and New Yorker) Joe Torre winning the World Series in , , , and .\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Islamic terrorist hijackers linked to the jihadist organization Al-Qaeda piloted two hijacked passenger airliners into each of the twin 110 story World Trade Center towers. The airplanes, designated for transcontinental flights and therefore fully loaded with jet fuel, were hijacked mid-flight and intentionally crashed into the towers in the early morning hours of September 11. The crashes caused massive structural damage during impact, ripping gaping holes into the towers, and ignited raging fires, that caused both weakened towers to collapse in less than two hours. Together with a simultaneous attack on the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a failed plane hijacking that resulted in a plane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, 2,977 victims died in the attacks.\n\nThe 9/11 attacks led to a temporary exodus of business from Lower Manhattan to places such as Midtown Manhattan, Jersey City, and Brooklyn, as well as elsewhere, along with the need to reposition the broadcasting antennas of several television channels. About 430,000 job-months and $2.8 billion in wages were lost in the three months after the attacks. The economic effects were mainly on the economy's export sectors. The city's GDP was estimated to have declined by $27.3 billion for the last three months of 2001 and all of 2002. The U.S. government provided $11.2 billion in immediate assistance to the government of New York City in September 2001, and $10.5 billion in early 2002 for economic development and infrastructure needs.\n\nHundreds of thousands of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants, including known carcinogens, were spread across Lower Manhattan due to the collapse of the Twin Towers. Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at ground zero. The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality in the aftermath of the attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002. Many other closings, evacuations, and cancellations followed the attack, either out of fear of further attacks or respect for the tragedy. Cleanup of the World Trade Center site was completed by the end of May 2002.\n\nOn November 12, 2001, American Airlines Flight 587 crashed into the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens, killing all 260 people on board and five others on the ground. It was the second-deadliest aviation incident involving an Airbus A300, after Iran Air Flight 655, and the second-deadliest aviation incident to occur on U.S. soil, after American Airlines Flight 191. In terms of single-airplane crash incidents that were ruled accidental and not criminal, as of March 2014, no incident since then has surpassed that death toll, though before 2001 there had been deadlier incidents of this type. Although initially feared to be another act of terrorism, the crash was eventually found to have been caused by pilot error.\n\nBillionaire media baron Michael Bloomberg, a Republican, was elected mayor in 2001, and reelected in 2005 and 2009. He used a statistical, results-based approach to city management, appointing city commissioners based on their expertise and granting them wide autonomy in their decision-making. Breaking with 190 years of tradition, he implemented what \"New York Times\" political reporter Adam Nagourney called a \"bullpen\" open office plan, similar to a Wall Street trading floor, in which dozens of aides and managerial staff are seated together in a large chamber. The design is intended to promote accountability and accessibility.\n\nOver the next ten years, a wave of public- and private-sector building projects reshaped large sections of the city, and a residential construction boom has resulted in permits being issued for over 25,000 new residential units every year. While the 2012 Summer Olympics ultimately went to London, New York was among the finalists and the campaign resulted in a plan to replace Shea Stadium with a new stadium, as well as an extension of the 7 subway service.\n\nNew York City was affected by the 2003 North America blackout on August 14, 2003, at 4:11 PM, leaving the city without electricity for over a day. Unlike in the New York City blackout of 1977, there was no major looting. However, during the blackout, Verizon's emergency generators failed several times, leaving the emergency services number 9-1-1 out of service for several periods of about a quarter-hour each. New York City's 311 information hotline received over 175,000 calls from concerned residents during the weekend. Amateur radio operators attached to New York City ARES provided a backup communications link to emergency shelters and hospitals. Amateur radio repeaters were supplied with emergency power and remained functional. Many major U.S. networks (CBS, NBC, ABC, and FOX) and some cable TV networks (such as HBO, MTV, and Nickelodeon) were unable to broadcast because of the lack of electricity in the New York City area, but back-up stations in Dallas and flagship transmitters there made it possible for prime-time television to be broadcast. (ABC chose instead to cover the news from Washington, D.C. during the blackout).\n\nHurricane Irene brought a destructive storm surge to New York City on the evening of August 24–25, 2011. In Manhattan, the Hudson River flooded in the Meatpacking District. Long Beach and Freeport, both of which experienced serious flooding, were among the worst-hit towns on Long Island, and many roads were left impassable. The workers at Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan worked to make the World Trade Center site hurricane-proof, and escaped major damage, just missing the tenth anniversary of 9/11. The winds knocked down many trees and power lines, leaving almost 350,000 homes and businesses without power in Nassau and Suffolk counties.\n\nHurricane Sandy brought another destructive storm surge to New York City on the evening of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels and subway lines in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity in many parts of the city and its suburbs. City public schools closed for four days. CUNY and NYU canceled all classes and campus activities for October 30. The New York Stock Exchange was closed for trading for two days, the first weather closure of the exchange since 1985. It was also the first two-day weather closure since the Great Blizzard of 1888. The East River overflowed its banks, flooding large sections of Lower Manhattan. Battery Park had a water surge of 13.88 ft. Seven subway tunnels under the East River were flooded. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said that the destruction caused by the storm was the worst disaster in the 108-year history of the New York City subway system. Sea water flooded the Ground Zero construction site. Over 10 billion gallons of raw and partially treated sewage were released by the storm, 94% of which went into waters in and around New York and New Jersey. In addition, a four-story Chelsea building's facade crumbled and collapsed, leaving the interior on full display; however, no one was hurt by the falling masonry.\n\nBloomberg was term-limited; after his third term, he could not run again in 2013. Bill de Blasio won the subsequent mayoral election, and was sworn into the mayor's office on January 1, 2014, by former President Bill Clinton.\n\nIn 2017, a transit crisis was declared after years of deferred maintenance on the city's subways, buses, and railroads. Congestion pricing was proposed as a result of the crisis. A subway \"action plan\" and a \"genius challenge\" were also announced as possible solutions.\n\nOn October 31, 2017, a man drove a pickup truck into the Hudson River Park's bike path in Tribeca between Houston Street and Chambers Street, killing at least eight people and injuring at least 15. Most of those who were hit were bike riders.\n\nThe city has been in a state of lockdown since March 22, 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. As of April, 2020, New York City is experiencing the most deaths of any locality in the coronavirus pandemic in New York State, which itself has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases of any state in the United States; at the time, one-third of total known U.S. cases were in New York City.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118072", "title": "LGBT rights in Singapore", "text": "LGBT rights in Singapore\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Singapore face challenges not faced by non-LGBT residents. Same-sex sexual activity is illegal (even if consensual and committed in private), and the Attorney-General of Singapore has declared that prosecutions under Section 377A occasionally still occur, although sources state that the law is not well enforced, and is being challenged in courts. Same-sex relationships are not recognized under the law, and adoption of children by same-sex couples is illegal. No anti-discrimination protections exist for LGBT people.\n\nSingaporean society is generally regarded as conservative. Despite this, LGBT events such as Pink Dot have taken place every year since 2009, with increasing attendance. In line with worldwide trends, attitudes towards members of the LGBT community are slowly changing and becoming more accepting and tolerant, especially among young people.\n\nPreviously, Singapore law inherited from the British Empire prohibited sodomy regardless of sex. As such, heterosexual and homosexual anal or oral sex was illegal. In 2007, such sexual activity was legalised for heterosexuals and lesbians, but not for gay men. The punishment is two years' imprisonment, and Attorney-General Lucien Wong has declared that he still has the legal power to prosecute someone under Singapore's Section 377A. Section 377A can be used to prosecute if reports are lodged with the police, particularly in relation to minors.\n\nIn June 2019, at the Smart Nation Summit, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong reiterated that Singapore would keep Section 377A \"for some time\" saying, \"Whatever your sexual orientation is, you're welcome to come and work in Singapore... You know our rules in Singapore. It is the way this society is: We are not like San Francisco, neither are we like some countries in the Middle East. [We are] something in between, it is the way the society is.\"\n\nAfter an exhaustive Penal Code review in 2007, oral and anal sex were legalised for heterosexuals and lesbians. The changes meant that oral and anal sex between consenting heterosexual and female homosexual adults were no longer offences. However, Section 377A, which deals with gross indecency between consenting men, remains in force.\n\nIn his concluding speech on the debate over the partial repeal of Section 377A, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told MPs before the vote that \"Singapore is basically a conservative society... The family is the basic building block of this society. And by a family in Singapore, we mean one man, one woman, marrying, having children and bringing up children within that framework of a stable family unit.\"\n\nSection 377A states that: \"Any male person who, in public or private, commits, or abets the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of gross indecency with another male person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years.\"\n\nSection 377A remains sporadically enforced. Between 2007 and 2013, nine people were convicted under 377A provisions.\n\nOther sections of the Penal Code potentiality relevant to LGBT Singaporeans include:\n\nSection 354 provides that if any person uses criminal force on any person intending to outrage, or knowing it would be likely to outrage, the modesty of that person, he shall be imprisoned for a maximum of 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any two of such punishments. Section 354 requires that the police or someone is touched. However, if no physical contact is made, homosexual behaviour can also be charged under Section 294A (see below).\n\nIf the victim of an entrapment operation uses a symbolic gesture to signal intention to have sexual activity with the police decoy, he can be tried under Section 294A of the Penal Code, which covers the commission of any obscene act in any public place to the annoyance of others (subject to a maximum of 3 months imprisonment, a fine, or both). From 1990 to 1994, there were 6 cases of obscene acts brought before the courts in this context. The accused were fined between $200 and $800.\n\nThe police can use section 19 (soliciting in a public place) of the \"Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act\", which covers both prostitution and soliciting \"for any other immoral purpose\". This offence carries a fine of up to $1,000, doubling on a subsequent conviction, including a jail term not exceeding 6 months.\n\nAccording to documentation by National University of Singapore sociologist Laurence Leong Wai Teng, from 1990 to 1994, there were 11 cases where gay men were charged for soliciting. They were fined between $200 and $500. However, a Lawnet search revealed no reported cases of persons being charged under section 19. This does not mean, however, that no persons were charged. They might have pleaded guilty and avoided trial, resulting in the absence of case law.\n\nHuman rights activists have been calling for and pushing for the repeal of Section 377A, arguing that it infringes on privacy, the right to life and personal liberty, the two latter being constitutionally protected. In 2007, the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) called for the repeal of Section 377A.\n\nIn 2012, in a case of Tan Eng Hong was found in the company of another man, and was initially charged with Section 377A but later pled guilty to a lesser charge, Tan decided to pursue his case against Section 377A on the grounds that it was inconsistent with Articles 9, 12, and 14 of Singapore Constitution. In deciding whether an appeal of Tan's case, would be a constitutional challenge as well, could be heard in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal found that Section 377A may \"arguably\" violates the rights to equality before law as offered in Article 12. The ruling however did not go into the merits of the case on technical grounds.\n\nTan's case was heard in the Supreme Court jointly with another appeal challenging Section 377A and a ruling was given on 29 October 2014. The ruling upheld the country's ban on same-sex relations between consenting adult men. The court held that Section 377A does not violate Articles 9 and 12 of the Singapore Constitution. These articles guarantee the right to life and personal liberty, and provide that all people are entitled to equal protection before the law. The applicant's attorney argued that Section 377A criminalises a group of people for an innate attribute, though the court concluded that \"there is, at present, no definitive conclusion\" on the \"supposed immutability\" of homosexuality. The court ultimately held that law reforms permitting private homosexual sex were a question for the Singapore Parliament to address.\n\nIn September 2018, following the high-profile repeal of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code by the Supreme Court of India, more than 50,000 people, including a former attorney-general and several former diplomats, signed a petition called \"READY4REPEAL\" urging the repeal of Section 377A as part of a major penal code review. However, government officials refused to do so. Diplomat Tommy Koh and former Attorney-General Walter Woon have called on members of the LGBT community to challenge the law.\n\nSoon after the repeal of Section 377 in India, a Singaporean DJ, Johnson Ong Ming filed a suit with the High Court arguing that Singapore's Section 377A is \"in violation of human dignity\". Section 377 of India Penal Code and Section 377A of Singapore Penal Code are effectively identical, as both were put in place by the British Empire, raising hopes in Singapore that the discriminatory law would be struck down as well. Singapore's High Court gave the petitioner until 20 November to submit his arguments.\n\nIn November 2018, LGBT rights activist Bryan Choong Chee Hong filed another case with the Supreme Court, arguing that Section 377A is \"inconsistent\" with portions of Singapore's Constitution, and \"is therefore void\". According to court documents, the petitioner argues that Section 377A is inconsistent with Article 9, Article 12, and Article 14 of the Constitution.\n\nA third legal challenge was launched in September 2019 by Roy Tan Seng Kee, a retired medical doctor. \"By institutionalising discrimination, it alienates them [LGBT people] from having a sense of belonging and purposeful place in our society, and prevents them from taking pride in Singapore's achievements\", he said in a statement. This attempt alongside earlier challenges from Ong and Choong, was dismissed by the High Court on 30 March 2020. They had three main arguments: on sexual orientation, on the purpose of Section 377A and on the non-enforcement of Section 377A. All these were dismissed in a closed-door judgement by Justice See Kee Oon.\n\nSingapore does not recognise same-sex relationships in any form (such as marriage, civil unions or domestic partnerships).\n\nAdoption of children by gays and lesbians are illegal in Singapore.\n\nIn December 2018, one rare exception was permitted when a gay Singaporean won the right to adopt a child he had fathered in the United States through a surrogate. The Singapore High Court overturned a 2017 ruling in which a district judge had ruled the man could not legally adopt his son because he was conceived through in vitro fertilization (which is only limited to heterosexual married couples) and brought to term through surrogacy, which is banned. In January 2019, in response, the Minister for Social and Family Development, Desmond Lee, told the Parliament that he was looking to strengthen Singapore's adoption laws to prevent more same-sex adoption cases and that it did not support \"the formation of family units with children of homosexual parents through institutions and processes such as adoption\". Under Singapore law, children born out of wedlock are considered illegitimate, (and thus are not eligible for certain social benefits, and the parents do not enjoy the same tax and housing rights as married couples) unless the child is legally adopted.\n\nNo laws exist specifically protecting LGBT Singaporeans from discrimination in the workplace, housing or any other relevant areas. Previous attempts claim damages for alleged discriminatory conduct in such fields have been dismissed in Singaporean courts.\n\nIn 2019, the \"Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act\" was amended to protect the LGBT community from religiously-motivated violence. Legal action can be taken against a religious group or its members for urging violence against certain \"target groups\". The Explanatory Statement states: \"The target group need not be confined to persons who practise a certain religion. The target group may be made up of atheists, individuals from a specific racial community, who share a similar sexual orientation, or have a certain nationality or descent like foreign workers or new citizens.\"\n\nPrior to 2003, homosexuals were barred from being employed in \"sensitive positions\" within the Singapore Civil Service.\n\nIn January 2006, the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) granted S$100,000 (US$61,500) to Liberty League, an organisation affiliated with the \"ex-gay\" movement, to promote conversion therapy. The organization says it \"promotes gender and sexual health for the individual, family and society\".\n\nDespite the legal conditions in the country, Singaporean government representatives have previously spoken glowingly of the conditions faced by LGBT citizens at a United Nations anti-discrimination committee; \"homosexuals are free to lead their lives and pursue their social activities. Gay groups have held public discussions and published websites, and there are films and plays on gay themes and gay bars and clubs in Singapore.\"\n\nThe Singapore Media Development Authority prohibits the \"promotion or glamorization of the homosexual lifestyle\" on television and the radio. This means among other things that advertisements targeting the LGBT community, such as those for HIV/AIDS, are not allowed to be broadcast.\n\nIn July 2019, Singaporean rapper Joshua Su, better known as The G3sha, came out as gay in a new song titled \"I'm OK\" that highlights his childhood, the homophobia he faced and coming to terms with his sexuality. Days later, he pulled out of a TEDx radio talk in protest after he was censored and asked not to make \"sensitive\" comments about his sexuality. Reports indicate that another Singapore gay rights activist was barred from speaking in 2018 at a TEDx radio talk.\n\nA 2005 poll by the Nanyang Technological University found that 69% of Singaporeans viewed homosexuality negatively, whilst 23% positively. In 2010, these numbers had changed to 64.5% negatively and 25% positively.\n\nAccording to 2013 polling, some 75% of Singaporeans opposed same-sex marriage.\n\nA 2018 opinion poll found that 55% of Singaporeans believed that gay men should have no right to privacy. On the other hand, a third of Singaporeans declared themselves more accepting of same-sex relationships and human rights than five years prior.\n\nIn 2019, a poll conducted by YouGov with 1,033 respondents showed that about one-third (34%) of Singaporeans backed same-sex partnerships, while 43% opposed their legalization, and the remaining 23% were uncertain. Support was more notable among younger respondents: 50% of people aged 18 to 34 supported civil partnerships and 20% were opposed. In contrast, only 22% of those aged 55 and over supported. 41% of university degree holders agreed with the legalisation of same-sex partnerships, whereas only 26% of respondents without a university degree were in favour. Of those who considered themselves \"very much\" religious, only 23% supported civil partnerships. 51% of people who considered themselves \"not at all\" religious expressed support. Apart from irreligious people, majority support for same-sex partnerships was also found in respondents who identified as LGBT (71% against 22%) and those who personally knew a person in a same-sex relationship (52% against 33%).\n\nA survey conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies between August 2018 and January 2019 revealed that Singaporean society was still largely conservative but becoming more liberal on LGBT rights. The survey showed that more than 20% of people said that sexual relations between adults of the same sex were not wrong at all or not wrong most of the time, a rise of about 10% from 2013. Around 27% felt the same way about same-sex marriage (up from 15% in 2013) and 30% did so about same-sex couples adopting a child (up from 24% in 2013).\n\nA 2019 poll conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies found that opposition to same-sex marriage in Singapore had fallen to 60%, down from 74% in 2013. The poll also found that nearly six in ten Singaporeans aged between 18 and 25 believed same-sex marriage is not wrong.\n\nIn June 2019, an online survey conducted by Yahoo Singapore asked 887 Singaporeans how they would react to a number of LGBT-related situations. When asked about an LGBT family member coming out, 53% of the respondents said they would react negatively. What's more, 14% expressed a \"strongly negative\" response, and 39% reported a \"somewhat negative\" reaction. When asked about a colleague coming out, 53% reported a positive reaction, while 46% reported a negative reaction. When asked about the marriage of Li Huanwu, the grandson of Singapore's founding prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, and his partner, Heng Yirui, 54% reacted negatively to the marriage. Meanwhile, 46% reacted positively to it. When asked about Pink Dot SG, 55% of respondents said that they strongly or somewhat support Pink Dot Singapore, but the remaining 45% opposed it. 80% of Singaporeans agreed that LGBT people face discrimination.\n\nIn June 2019, an online survey conducted by Blackbox Research revealed that 56% of Singaporeans were opposed to other countries following Taiwan's example in legalising same-sex marriage, while 44% answered \"yes\". When asked on how they felt that more than 300 same-sex couples were married in Taiwan the first week after the new law was passed, about 49% of those surveyed felt positive about the statement, with 14% feeling \"strongly positive\" and 35% feeling \"somewhat positive\". Conversely, 51% responded negatively to this, 20% felt \"strongly negative\" and 31% were \"somewhat negative\". The respondents were also asked about how they felt concerning the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Bhutan. About 55% of respondents felt positive, with 15% feeling \"strongly positive\" and 40% were \"somewhat positive\". Conversely, about 44% responded negatively, 11% felt \"strongly negative\" and 33% felt \"somewhat negative\".\n\nLi Huanwu, the grandson of Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, and the nephew of current prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, came out as gay in July 2018. He married his partner, Heng Yirui, in South Africa on 24 May 2019.\n\nIn May 2019, a study by the National University of Singapore estimated that there were 210,000 men who have sex with men (MSM) in Singapore. The study estimates were more than double the previous estimates of 90,000 MSM, and said they could be at risk of a concentrated epidemic of HIV.\n\nPink Dot SG is an annual event that started in 2009 in support of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community in Singapore. In recent years, record crowds of approximately 28,000 have attended the rally, with a heavy bent toward younger demographics. On 29 June 2019, during the 11th Pink Dot, Lee Hsien Yang, the brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, as well as his wife and second son Li Huanwu and Li's husband, Heng Yirui, attended the event.\n\n"}

Wills achieved fame as the second-in-command of the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition, which was the first expedition to cross Australia from south to north, finding a route across the continent from the settled areas of Victoria to the Gulf of Carpentaria.\n\nWilliam John Wills was born on 5 January 1834 in Totnes, Devon, England, and he was the second of seven children born to William Wills (died 28 September 1889) and Sarah Mary Elizabeth Wills (née Calley, born 23 December 1800, baptized 12 March 1801 in Totnes, and died 19 February 1880).\n\nWills lived at the family home at Ipplepen, and as a young child he contracted a fever which left him with \"slow and hesitating speech\". He was home-tutored by his father until the age of 11, and from 1845 to 1850 attended St Andrew's Grammar School in Ashburton. He was then articled to his father's surgical practice, and he later studied practical chemistry under John Stenhouse at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London in 1852.\n\nWills bought a share in the Melbourne Gold Mining Company in 1852 and planned to migrate to Australia with his wife Sarah and sons William and Thomas. However, as his wife objected to him leaving London, Wills delayed his departure and consequently the two boys went to Australia alone. Eighteen-year-old William and fifteen-year-old Thomas departed from Dartmouth on 1 October 1852 aboard the \"Janet Mitchell\", and they arrived in Melbourne on 3 January 1853 with 197 other passengers. William and Thomas found accommodation at the Immigrants Home in South Melbourne.\n\nIn February 1853, the Wills brothers found work as shepherds at a property owned by the Royal Bank Company on the Edward River near Deniliquin. They were paid £30 per year (£ in ) plus rations, and were in charge of a flock of 1300 rams at the Ram Station. In the same year, their father followed his sons to Australia, arriving in August 1853, and the three returned to Melbourne before moving to Ballarat where William John Wills worked as a digger in the goldfields. In 1854, he worked as an assistant surgeon in his father's practice and later he opened his own gold office. \n\nIn early 1855, William worked on William Skene's Kanawalla Station on the Wannon River near Hamilton. He returned to Ballarat in April 1855, and towards the end of the year he began to study surveying. He was appointed as an amateur to John Hamlet Taylor, the Acting District Surveyor of the Ballarat Survey Office on Sturt Street. William spent several months learning trigonometry, Euclidian geometry and in 1856 studied field surveying. He began his practical surveying experience at Glendaruel, near Tourello. There, he worked under the supervision of Frederick John Byerly, Assistant Surveyor, on £150 per year (£ in ) plus board. In February 1857, he worked at Bullarook Creek Camp, and in March 1857 he surveyed at Kingower near Inglewood. In the middle of 1857, he was promoted to foreman and placed in charge of a field party; his salary also increased to £185 per year (£ in ). From April to June 1858, he surveyed at St Arnaud, then in July he returned to Ballarat and took occasional contracts surveying for Clement Hodgkinson, the Deputy Surveyor General.\n\nWills moved to Melbourne in August 1858, and from August to December, he lodged with Mrs E Henderson at 1 Dorcas Street, South Melbourne. In November 1858, he received a temporary appointment on the recommendation of Charles Whybrow Ligar, Surveyor General, as a supernumerary at the recently established Magnetic Observatory which was then located at Flagstaff Hill. In February 1859, one of the observatory assistants, John Walter Osborne, transferred from the observatory to become a photozincographer in the Survey Department of the Office of Crown Lands and Survey. Wills replaced Osborne at the observatory, then his permanent appointment was confirmed in March 1859, at which point he moved into a room at the Observatory. Wills studied under Government Meteorologist and Observatory Director Georg von Neumayer, and he worked with Jacob Bauer, Charles E Pickering, Charles Moerlin, and supernumeraries John Osborne and Edwin James Welch.\n\nWills was appointed third-in-command, surveyor, and astronomical and meteorological observer of the Victorian Exploring expedition in July 1860 on a salary of £300 a year (£ in ). Robert O'Hara Burke was the leader, George James Landells served as second-in-command. The expedition left Melbourne on Monday, 20 August 1860 with a total of 19 men, 27 camels, and 23 horses, and they reached Menindee on 16 October 1860, where Landells resigned following an argument with Burke. As a result, Wills was promoted to second-in-command. \n\nBurke then split the expedition at Menindee. The lead party reached Cooper Creek on 11 November 1860 where they formed a depot, and the remaining men were expected to follow up from Menindee. After a break, Burke decided to make a dash to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Burke split the party again and left on 16 December 1860, placing William Brahe in charge of the depot on Cooper Creek. Burke, Wills, John King and Charley Gray reached the mangroves on the estuary of the Flinders River, near the current town Normanton, on 9 February 1861, though flooding rains and swamps meant they never saw open ocean. \n\nAlready weakened by starvation and exposure, progress on the return journey was slow, and the group was hampered by the tropical monsoon downpours typical to the wet season. Gray died four days before Burke, Wills, and King reached the depot at Cooper Creek. They arrived on 21 April 1861 to find the men had not arrived from Menindee, and that Brahe and the Depot Party had given up waiting and left just 9 hours earlier. Brahe had already waited 18 weeks for their return (he and Burke had agreed to 13 weeks) and had buried a note and some food underneath a tree which is now known as the Dig Tree.\n\nBurke, Wills and King attempted to reach Mount Hopeless, the furthest extent of settlement in South Australia, which was closer than Menindee (the route preferred by Wills), but failed, and returned to Cooper Creek. Wills became exhausted and was unable to continue while waiting to be rescued. Wills urged Burke and King to continue on, so they left him alone with food, water and shelter. He died alone at Breerily Waterhole on Cooper Creek in South Australia, and Burke died soon after. While the exact date of their deaths is unknown, it is generally accepted to be 28 June 1861.\n\nKing survived with the help of a group of Aborigines until being rescued in September by Alfred William Howitt, who buried Burke and Wills before returning to Melbourne. In 1862, Howitt returned to Cooper Creek and disinterred Burke and Wills' bodies, taking them first to Adelaide and then by steamer to Melbourne where they were laid in state for two weeks. On 23 January 1863 Burke and Wills received a State Funeral and were buried in Melbourne General Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

Among the locals, it is also known as the \"Ausseer Ohrwaschl\" (Aussee Ear) because of its shape. It is possible to almost reach the peak by car by using a toll road of 9 km. There is an extensive parking lot in front of the Loser Restaurant at an elevation of 1600 m, from where one can embark on various tours. The \"\" (1643 m / 250 m × 100 m) is located close to the restaurant and is an attractive target for hiking which can be reached with just a little walking. From there onwards, one can reach the peak by passing the \"Loser-Fenster\" (Loser Window), a natural rock gate. One of the most important ski resorts of the Ausseerland is located on the Loser and spans about 1000 meters of elevation. During the descent, one passes a second gastronomic establishment, the \"Loserhütte\" at 1498 m.\n\nThe largest solar power plant of the Alps is located on the southern slope of Loser at an elevation of 1600 metres. The pure air, the usual absence of fog, and, in winter, reflection of sunlight from snow, create good conditions for obtaining electricity from sunlight in the mountains. The Loser plant was built from 1988 to 1989 and consists of 598 solar modules covering a total surface area of 263 m². The module's inclination of 60 degrees allows for a stable delivery of electricity throughout the year. Three generators (from the USA, Japan and Germany) produce about 30 kilowatts under optimal conditions, which enter the electrical network through a power inverter.\n\n"}

These devices, which come in many shapes and types, are used to aid them with buoyancy.\n\nThe most common floats for children are inflatable rings (where the user swims in the middle of it) and the inflatable armbands (they are placed around the user's arms). After being inflated through a valve, they are much less dense than water because they are composed mainly of air, surrounded by a thin layer of synthetic material.\n\nSwimming float-assisted can be more difficult than swimming without the float, because if the float is held in front of the swimmer a more vigorous workout for the legs is given as the swimmer's weight is propelled solely by the legs, and vice versa for the arms.\n\nEspecially-large floats can be used as seats, or can even provide enough buoyancy for the user to stand on top in the manner of a raft.\n\nA variation known as the \"pool noodle\" is a long (about –) thin (a few inches across) cylinder with a hollow core. It can be used to aid in floating or stretching exercises.\n\nA pull buoy or \"leg float\" is used to focus exercise on the arms.\n\nPool dumbbells are used for strength training where muscles push down against buoyancy. This is the opposite of conventional dumbbells, which are used to force muscles to pull up, against gravity.\n\nSwimming boards (often referred to as kickboards or flutter boards) are a flotation aid used to develop a swimmer's kicking action. They can be used on all strokes but are primarily used on Freestyle, Butterfly stroke and Breaststroke.\n\nSwimmers of all ability can use them. Young swimmers can develop their kicking action while elite swimmers can refine their kick. They are also used to strengthen a swimmers legs.\n\nKickboards are usually made from EVA foam. Some are made of more durable HDPE. The EVA foam boards can break easily and become very worn after long use. So it causes the board to slowly disintegrate over time.\n\nThere are some variations of kickboards from the traditional form with two hand grips. Some can be used as a kickboard and a pull buoy. These are often oddly shaped so they can be used for both of the training aspects.\n"}

The organisation started as a boutique distributor of information technology.\n\nImagineering Australia acquired a 50% shareholding in late 1986. In 1987, Kennedy, who had returned to the US, sold his 50% shareholding to Imagineering. Tech Pacific was kept as a separate trading entity as Jodee Rich, founder of Imagineering, wanted a vehicle to exclusively distribute product lines that competed with the product lines carried by Imagineering Australia.\n\nIn 1990 First Pacific acquired Imagineering Australia and Jodee Rich left the company. At this time Imagineering Australia, Australia's largest IT distributor, experienced financial difficulties as a result of competition introduced by the entry of an American IT distributor, Micro America, under the \"Micro Australia\" brand. (Micro America later merged with Softsel to form Merisel.) Graham Pickles, Managing Director of Imagineering Australia's Tech Pacific subsidiary, was appointed as the new Group Managing Director. With this change, Imagineering Australia and Tech Pacific merged under the \"Tech Pacific\" name.\n\nDuring the early 1990s Tech Pacific transformed itself from a value-add distributor to a broadbase distributor and the business again began to grow significantly. Merisel Australia proved a worthy adversary early on; however, through good strategic planning and target-account management, Tech Pacific regained the key reseller accounts that were most profitable leaving Merisel the smaller consultancy and retail accounts.\n\nIn March 1995, Tech Pacific acquired Merisel Australia, taking the number-two distributor out of the market and creating an Asia-Pacific IT distribution powerhouse.\n\nIn the late 1990s, First Pacific sold its interests in Tech Pacific to Hagemeyer, who in turn in the early 2000s sold the business off to CVC Asia Pacific. In 2004, Tech Pacific planned to go public through an IPO. However, Ingram Micro sensing an opportunity to become a global IT distributor, acquired Tech Pacific in a transaction valued at over 700 million dollars.\n\nOn March 31, 2005, the Tech Pacific name disappeared with the completion of the merger of Tech Pacific's business into Ingram Micro throughout Asia.\n"}

Based on the plight of women in India, the film satirizes the honor with which women are placed in society and the restrictions on them. The fact that the four women's names (Maithili, Janki, Ramdulaari, and Vaidehi) are all versions of Sita, the ideal Hindu woman's name, is a message in itself. The film stars Manisha Koirala as Vaidehi, the mistreated woman, and Anil Kapoor, Jackie Shroff, Rekha, Madhuri Dixit, Mahima Chaudhry, Ajay Devgn, and Sharman Joshi appear in supporting roles.\n\nThe film failed commercially in India but was a major commercial success in the overseas.\n\nAt the 47th Filmfare Awards, the film was nominated for 3 awards, including Best Supporting Actor for Devgn, and Best Supporting Actress for Rekha and Dixit. The latter also received a nomination for the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role – Female and eventually won it.\n\nVaidehi lives with her husband Raghu. On the outside, she lives a sophisticated life, but behind closed doors, her husband is abusive and has extramarital affairs. When she takes a stand for herself, she is banished from the household. She goes back to her parents' house, but they too reject her. Vaidehi soon finds out that she is pregnant.\n\nRaghu gets into a car accident, leaving him unable to father a child. When he discovers that Vaidehi is pregnant, he calls her, faking remorse, and asks for her to return. Vaidehi agrees, thinking Raghu has mended his ways. In reality, Raghu and his father are plotting for the child to become their heir, and if Vaidehi intervenes, she will be killed. Meanwhile, a friend informs Vaidehi of Raghu's true intentions, and so she escapes from his henchmen. She is helped by Raju, a petty but kindhearted thief. He hears Vaidehi's story and gives her money from a recent heist to help. To hide from Raghu and his henchmen, Vaidehi and Raju gatecrash a wedding procession.\n\nAt the wedding, Vaidehi meets Maithili , the bride-to-be, who is from a middle-class family but is marrying a man hailing from a rich background. The two women witness the groom's father harassing Maithili's father with demands for an opulent wedding which he cannot afford and forcing him to pay dowry, failing which his reputation in society will be ruined. Vaidehi tries to convince Raju to give Maithili's father his money from the heist. He initially refuses and is soon forced to escape from the wedding because somebody has recognized him as a gatecrasher. However, changing his mind, he soon returns to give his heist money to Vaidehi. The groom's friend attempts to rape Maithili. As the wedding ceremony progresses, one of the guests recognises the heist money which Raju had stolen from him. Moreover, the groom's friend tells the groom's family that he spotted a man (Raju) in Maithili's room. Maithili is accused of having sexual relations with Raju in return for money, which leads Raju to publicly acknowledge his theft. Having tolerated enough, Maithili insults the groom's family, and they flee from the wedding.\n\nMeanwhile, Raghu finds Vaidehi and forces her into going home with him. On the way, they encounter a protest mob. Raghu gets out of the car to investigate, giving Vaidehi the chance to escape. She arrives in the small town of Haripur, where she meets Janki, a theatre actress in love with her colleague. Janki is pregnant, but not married, and does not care for society's norms. The theatre director, Puroshottam, an older man, lusts after Janki, but keeps his wife, Lata, confined to their house. Puroshottam badmouths Janki to her lover, creating a rift between them. Janki's lover asks her to abort the child, as he suspects that he might not be the real father, indirectly accusing Janki of having sexual relations with Purshottam. Janki is outraged and intentionally botches a scene during a performance of the \"Ramayan\". The angered audience assaults Janki, causing her to suffer a miscarriage. Vaidehi confronts Puroshottam, who threatens to call her husband. However, Lata intervenes and puts her on a train at the train station.\n\nVaidehi's train is robbed by bandits but the passengers are saved by Bhulwa , a local dacoit. Vaidehi faints at the sight of blood, and Bhulwa takes her to the local midwife, Ramdulaari. Ramdulaari bravely opposes the village leaders Virendra and Gajendra who exploit innocent women, young and old. When Ramdulaari's educated son Prakash, who is trying to educate the villagers about what Virendra and Gajendra are doing, falls in love with Gajendra's daughter Sushma , all hell breaks loose. Gajendra slyly locks Ramdulaari in her house and sets out to find Prakash. When Prakash runs away with Sushma, Virendra, and Gajendra, along with their goons, rape Ramdulaari and burn her alive. In a fit of rage, Bhulwa and his army kill Virendra and his goons. Vaidehi escapes with Sushma and Prakash. \n\nGajendra is attempting to enter politics, so when he is applauded by the local authorities, Vaidehi intervenes and exposes Gajendra as a rapist and fraud through a heart-wrenching speech. This drives all the women in the audience to assault Gajendra, who is later killed by Bhulwa. The speech changes Raghu's attitude towards Vaidehi and he decides to mend his ways. The two return to New York City as a proper married couple. Vaidehi gives birth to a daughter, who is named Ramdulaari. She meets Raju again, who is now a taxi driver and married to Maithili. She invites him to a charity dance show with Janki in the main role, wherein all the money from her shows goes to fund women's organisations in India.\n\n\nThe songs were mainly composed by Anu Malik. A. R. Rahman was initially signed in as the composer; but then he opted out; after he got extremely busy with his international assignment, \"Bombay Dreams\". Then, the background score for the movie was done by Illayaraja. Lyrics of all songs were also written by Sameer, except those of \"Kaun Dagar Kaun Shehar\", which were written by Prasoon Joshi. This song was also composed by Illayaraja and was sung by Lata Mangeshkar. According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 13,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's fifteenth highest-selling.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews however the performances from the lead actors were highly praised.\nBollywood Hungama gave a rating of two and half out of five stars and said \"On the whole, Lajja is a purposeful film within commercial parameters and the best part is that the Indian masses will be able to identify with the goings-on. An enviable star cast, a talented director and an excellent second half are amongst its strong points.\" \"The Hindu\" stated \"Unfortunately, this colourful film is a black-and-white disappointment, particularly in the second half when Santoshi loses track of his story and in a blatant bid to get the tax-free certificate brings in bits about computer education, female literacy and infanticide.\". The BBC gave a positive review saying \"The film is well directed, excellent songs, although they should have had more realistic fights.\"\n\n\"Lajja\" failed commercially at the box office in India due to high budget and distribution price. However it tasted success overseas. It ranked 14th on the British box-office chart, according to the International Movie Database.\n"}

Rabitat abna al-Yaman (RAY) was one of the country’s oldest but smaller opposition parties.\n\nAbd Al-Rahman represented the youth organization in celebrating the first anniversary of the United Arab Republic (U.A.R.) in 1959 when he was 16. In a carnival on February 2, which was attended by more than a hundred thousand people in the Republic Square in Cairo, he delivered a speech on behalf of the youth organization.\n\nIn 1965 two rival nationalist groups — the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY) and the National Liberation Front (NLF) — turned to terrorism in their struggle to control the country. Abd Al-Rahman participated in the struggle against the British-sponsored Federation of South Arabia. In the face of uncontrollable violence, British troops withdrew, and the federation rule collapsed. The NLF elements quickly took control, after eliminating their FLOSY rivals. Al-Rahman was forced to emigrate together with others from his homeland. By 1968, following a final royalist siege of Sanaa, most of the opposing leaders reached a reconciliation and returned to their homeland.\n\nIn 1970 Abd Al-Rahman was involved in the National Unity movement which was then newly formed in Sana’a. The National Unity was a coalition that included the League Party, the Liberation Front, the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY) and the secessionists from the National Liberation Front (NLF).\n\nAfter completing his course in London, Abd Al-Rahman worked as a General Manager for a number of investment companies in the Gulf. In November 1986, he was elected President of the League Party by the Party’s Seventh General Conference. He was again re-elected President in 1992 by the Eighth General Conference in Sana’a and was chairman of the \"Perpetratory Commission for the National Conference\".\n\nAbd Al-Rahman represented the League Party in founding the National Opposition Front (MOWJ) which was the most successful opposition alliance in the Yemeni political arena. He represented the Party in the Dialogue Commission, which was the direct outcome of the Front’s pressure against the ruling government. He drafted the broad outlines and foundations of the \"Document of Pledge and Accord\" and presented the document in the name of the League’s Rabitat Party to the National Opposition Front in October 1993. The National Opposition Front presented the document to the Dialogue Commission in “Sana’a” on December 18, 1993.\n\nConflicts within the coalition resulted in the self-imposed exile of Vice-President Ali Salim al-Baidh to Aden in August 1993, and a deterioration in the general security situation as political rivals settled scores and tribal elements took advantage of the unsettled situation. Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas (former southern Prime Minister) continued to serve as the Prime Minister of the Republic of Yemen, but his government was ineffective due to political infighting. Continuous negotiations between northern and southern leaders resulted in the signing of the document of pledge and accord in Amman, Jordan on February 20, 1994.\n\nAbd Al-Rahman signed the \"Document of Pledge and Accord\" in his capacity as a member. Jointly with the late Omer AlGawy, however, he expressed his reservations on the implementation mechanism. He forewarned the government against using the document as \"an Othman’s bloody shirt\". With co-members of the Dialogue Commission, he contributed in endeavours to pacify the situation after the distressful \"events of Emran\". Despite this, clashes intensified until civil war broke out in early May 1994.\n\nSouthern leaders, supported by the Saudis, declared secession and the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen (DRY) on May 21, 1994, but the Democratic Republic of Yemen was not recognized by the international community. Although the southerners had their own motives for fighting, northern leaders have long maintained that the Saudis supported the southern cause as a way of furthering their own border dispute with the Republic of Yemen. Ali Nasir Muhammad’s supporters greatly assisted military operations against the secessionists and Aden was captured on July 7, 1994. Other resistance quickly collapsed and thousands of southern leaders and military went into exile.\n\nWhen the war broke out, Abd Al-Rahman was in Aden, together with his friend, the late Omer Al-Gawy. He quickly drafted the initiative of the National Opposition Front on May 9, 1994, to stop the war. He participated in the Government of the Democratic Republic of Yemen as a Vice-President of the Presidency Council whence he declared that the objective was to put an end to the war and to restore the Yemeni unification on valid foundation that will help achieve stability and security in accordance with the document which enjoyed the consensus of the Yemeni populace and all its political and social forces. Among the principal leaders, he was the last to leave Aden, staying behind until July 7, 1994, to prevent bloodshed and to save it from being demolished.\n\nAfter losing the war, leaders of the opposition front fled to several Arab countries and lived in exile. MOWJ set up its headquarters in London, where — despite retreating from its separatist line — it waged a propaganda campaign against the Sana’a government. In January 1995, Abd Al-Rahman was elected as President of MOWJ.\n\nIn 1997, Abd Al-Rahman participated in the \"Human Rights Conference\" held at Chatham House in London and in October, he delivered a speech on the Yemeni issue at Exeter University, which printed his speech.\n\nIn 1998, the separatist leaders were tried in their absence on treason charges. Five were sentenced to death but Abd Al-Rahman was merely given a ten-year suspended sentence, thus leaving open the possibility of his eventual return.\n\nLike the \"Rabitat abna al-Yaman\" Party, Abd Al-Rahman renounces violence, believes in dialogue to resolve political and social issues and believes in moderation. His faith and tolerant approach follows the Koranic verse \"Call to the path of your God by wisdom and good preachment and argue with them in the most graceful manner\" and \"[w]ard off in the most graceful manner such that with whom you have hostility as if he is an intimate friend\".\n\nStudies were published about him, the first of which was by Mr. Awad AlArashani of the \"Al-Ahram Printing Press\", entitled, \"Abdurrahman Aljifri: Confrontation and Challenge\" and another by \"ALQUDS for Studies and Research\", entitled, \"A Reading in the Thinking of Abdurrahman Aljifri, the President of Mowj\".\n\nAbd Al-Rahman has two sons, namely, Ali al-Jifri, who is a scholar who currently resides in Abu Dhabi, UAE and who is a lecturer of Islamic Sciences at the famed Islamic University, Dar al-Mustafa and the founder of Tabah Foundation in Abu Dhabi, his other son (Abdulaziz Abdulrahman Al-Jifri), one daughter and 12 grandchildren. The oldest female (Fatima Ali Aljifri) 1994 then the oldest male (Alawi Hassan Aljifri) was born in 1995. Followed by (Shahad Abdulaziz Aljifri) who was born in London, in 1996.\n\nAbd Al-Rahman Ali wrote and contributed in compiling several of the League’s literature, some of which were as follows:\n\n"}

A specialist of the Classic and Romantic repertoires, for more than thirty years she has appeared regularly with professional orchestras around the world, often performing the music of contemporary Polish composers including Lutosławski and Panufnik.\n\nFialkowska was born in Montreal, Quebec, to a Canadian mother (Bridget Todd Fialkowski) and a Polish father (Jerzy Fialkowski), an engineer and Polish army officer who emigrated to Canada in 1945. Her mother, Scottish-Irish and Cree descent, studied piano in the class of Alfred Cortot at the École Normale de Musique de Paris (1935–1939). Fialkowska is the granddaughter of John Todd, Canada's first professor of parasitology, and great-granddaughter of Edward Clouston, President of the Canadian Bankers Association. She is the cousin of former Canadian cabinet minister David Anderson and cousin of stage and screen actor Christopher Plummer.\n\nFialkowska began to study piano at the age of four with her mother and in 1960 enrolled in the École Vincent-d'Indy in Montreal. In 1963, at the age of 12, she made her debut as a soloist with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and began studying with Yvonne Hubert. She pursued her secondary education at the Montreal girls school The Study, graduating in 1967. The following year, at the age of 17, she simultaneously obtained undergraduate (Baccalauréat) and Maitrise from the Université de Montréal. During this period, she also studied in Paris with virtuoso and teacher Yvonne Lefébure (1966, 1968–1969). In 1969 she was awarded 1st Prize in the CBC National Radio Competition for Young Performers in Canada and travelled occasionally to New York City for private studies with Sasha Gorodnitzki. In 1970, she settled in New York and enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music as a student of Sasha Gorodnitzki, later becoming his teaching assistant from 1979–1984. \n\nIn 1974, while enrolled in law school in her hometown of Montreal, Fialkowska participated in the inaugural Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Master Competition in Tel Aviv. Unbeknownst to her, one of the judges gave her a zero in order to help his own student advance. But Rubinstein himself, then 87, was impressed by her playing. When he found out about the zero, he threatened to withdraw his name from the competition unless Fialkowska advanced. Rubinstein became her mentor and launched her international career, hailing her as \"a born Chopin interpreter.\"\n\nFialkowska's solo recital tours have taken her to concert halls throughout Europe, the United States, Canada and the Far East. In Europe, Fialkowska performed as a soloist with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, the Hallé Orchestra, the London Philharmonic, the Royal Philharmonic of London, the BBC Symphony, the Scottish National Orchestra, the Bonn Philharmonic, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Warsaw Philharmonic, and the Orchestre National de France.\n\nConcerto appearances in North America have included the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the National Arts Centre Orchestra of Canada, the Calgary Philharmonic, the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, and the Vancouver Symphony. \n\nOver the course of her career, Fialkowska has performed with many well-known conductors, including Sir Georg Solti, Zubin Mehta, Lorin Maazel, Sir Roger Norrington, Sir Andrew Davis, Bernard Haitink, Hans Graf, Charles Dutoit, Kyril Kondrashin, Leonard Slatkin, Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Thomas Dausgaard and Eiji Oue.\n\nIn 1986, to commemorate the centennial of the death of Franz Liszt, Fialkowska was invited to perform his complete Transcendental Études in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, in London for the BBC, and in Canada for the CBC. In 1990, she was chosen to perform, with the Chicago Symphony, the world premiere of the recently discovered Third Piano Concerto of Franz Liszt.\n\nFialkowska has also given world premiere performances of piano concertos by American composer Libby Larsen, with the Minnesota Orchestra (1991) and by Canadian composer Marjan Mozetich, with the Kingston Symphony (2000). \n\nIn 1992, the Colorado Symphony invited her to perform the North American premiere of the piano concerto by Sir Andrzej Panufnik. Also in 1992, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation produced a television documentary of her life and career, entitled \"The World of Janina Fialkowska\", which was aired across Canada and was awarded a special jury prize at the San Francisco International Film Festival.\n\nIn January 2002, on the eve of a European concert tour encompassing eight countries, Fialkowska's career was suddenly brought to a halt by the discovery of an aggressive cancerous tumour in her upper left arm. Following the removal of the malignant mass in May 2002, she subsequently underwent an innovative surgical procedure designed to reconstruct the arm that had been rendered almost useless by the excision of the tumour. During her eighteen months of convalescence, she gave many concerts in Europe and North America, performing music written especially for the left hand by Ravel (Concerto for the Left Hand) and Prokofiev (Piano Concerto no. 4), which she adapted for performance with the right hand. Both the public and the critics praised her courage and the high calibre of these performances for example with the Houston Symphony Orchestra under Stanislaw Skrowaczewski. \n\nIn 2004, Fialkowska returned return to the stage as a two-handed pianist, first with a recital in Germany, followed by Beethoven’s Fourth Piano Concerto in Toronto. Since then, she has resumed active touring in Canada, the United States, Europe, and the Far East performing amongst others with the Warsaw Philharmonic, the Montreal Symphony, the Toronto Symphony, the Suk Chamber Orchestra Prague, the Vancouver Symphony, the Detroit Symphony, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the Mexico State Orchestra, L'orchestra di Camera Italiana, the Badische Staatskapelle, the Osaka Philharmonic and many others.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Fialkowska hosted a celebration of the works of Chopin at the Festival of the Sound. In 2018, her album \"Chopin Recital 3\" won a Juno Award for Classical Album of the Year.\n\nFialkowska has also garnered praise for her interpretations of the works of Chopin and Liszt.\n\nJanina Fialkowska is married to German music manager Harry Oesterle (since 2001). They have homes in the United States (Connecticut) and Germany (Bavaria).\n\nJanina Fialkowska was the founder and first Artistic Director of Piano Six, a not-for-profit educational outreach program dedicated to supporting classical music in small communities throughout Canada. In 1993, Fialkowska convinced five well-known Canadian classical pianists to join with her in a tour of outlying communities that rarely host internationally known musicians. In order to serve as many communities as possible, Fialkowska and the other Piano Six artists agreed to perform for a fraction of their usual fees. \n\nDuring its decade of operation (1993–2003), this program sent its artists on more than 60 regional tours, reaching over 100,000 Canadians of all ages with live performances, masterclasses and teachers' workshops. In 2004, in order to broaden the scope of its activities, the Piano Six roster was expanded to include Canadian musicians from the fields of strings and voice as well as piano. Under the banner of Piano Plus, the new program's associated artists continue to tour in Canada each season.\n\n\nTow of Fialkowska's recordings were nominated by the Canadian music industry for a Juno Award: her 1997 CD Fialkowska plays Szymanowski (ODR 9305) and her 1998 recital of virtuoso salon pieces La Jongleuse (CBC MVCD 1114). Her 2001 recording of Liszt’s Transcendental Études (ODR 9332) earned the Critics’ Choice award from American Record Guide. She has also recorded the Liszt Sonata for RCA Red Seal and discs of various works by Chopin for Atma Classique.\n\nIn 2007, it was discovered that some recordings originally attributed to the deceased pianist Joyce Hatto (1928–2006) contained tracks, including Mephisto Waltz and Venezia e Napoli from Fialkowska's 1990 CD of works by Franz Liszt, that had been plagiarized from recordings by other artists. The discovery of these plagiarized tracks led to one of the biggest scandals in the classical music recording business.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118186", "title": "Roman Rota", "text": "Roman Rota\n\nThe Roman Rota, formally the Apostolic Tribunal of the Roman Rota (), and anciently the Apostolic Court of Audience, is the highest appellate tribunal of the Catholic Church, with respect to both Latin-rite members and the Eastern-rite members and is the highest ecclesiastical court constituted by the Holy See related to judicial trials conducted in the Catholic Church. An appeal may be had to the pope himself, who is the supreme ecclesiastical judge. The Catholic Church has a complete legal system, which is the oldest in the West still in use. The court is named \"Rota\" (wheel) because the judges, called \"auditors\", originally met in a round room to hear cases. The Rota was established in the 13th century.\n\nThe pope appoints the auditors of the Rota and designates one of them the dean. On Saturday, September 22, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI accepted the resignation as dean, for reasons of age, of Bishop Antoni Stankiewicz, and appointed in his place Msgr. Pio Vito Pinto, until then serving as a prelate auditor of the Court of First Instance. The Rota issues its decrees and sentences in Latin. The Rota adjudicates cases in a panel (called a \"turnus\") of three auditors, or more, depending on the complexity of the matter, assigned by the dean of the tribunal, though sometimes a larger number of auditors are assigned to a particular case. The auditors of the Rota are selected from among recognized ecclesiastical judges serving various dioceses around the world.\n\nThe Rota's official records begin in 1171. Until the Risorgimento and the loss of the Papal States in 1870, the Rota was a civil tribunal and its judgements had the status of law in the Papal States.\n\nIn March 2020, Pope Francis issued a new Vatican law which provides for greater independence of judicial bodies and magistrates dependent on the Pope. It also specifies the requirements for the appointment of judges and it simplifies the judicial system while increasing the staff of the court.\n\nUntil the 14th century the court was formally known as the \"Apostolic Court of Audience\". The first recorded use of the term \"Rota\", which referred to the wheel-shaped arrangement of the benches used by the court in the great hall at Avignon, is in Thomas Fastolf's \"Decisiones rotae\", consisting of reports on thirty-six cases heard at the Court of Audience in Avignon between December 1336 and February 1337. Its first usage in a papal bull is in 1418. It is also possible that the term \"Rota\" comes from the porphyry wheel that was centered in the marble floor of Avignon, or even from the wheel-like cases in which parchment roll records were kept.\n\nThe Rota's main function is that of an appellate tribunal, ordinarily reviewing decisions of lower courts if the initial court (first instance) and the first appellate court (second instance) do not agree on the outcome of a case; however, any party to an initial decision before a court of the Latin Church (and also some Eastern Churches) has the right to file a second-instance appeal directly to the Rota. Dominating its caseload are petitions seeking the issuance of a decree of nullity of a marriage, although it has jurisdiction to hear any other type of judicial and non-administrative case in any area of canon law. The Rota serves as a tribunal of first instance (in Anglo-American common law what would be termed exclusive original jurisdiction) in certain cases such as any contentious case in which a Bishop of the Latin Church is a defendant. If the case can still be appealed after a Rotal decision, the appeal goes to a different turnus, or panel, of the Rota.\nThe Rota is the highest appeals court for all judicial trials in the Catholic Church. A judgment of the Rota can, however with the greatest difficulty, be vacated by the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, which is the highest administrative court in the Catholic Church. However, the legal procedure or process used by the judges of the Rota, not the merits of the case, are on trial before the Signatura: the Signatura is only able to grant the petitioner a new trial to be held before a new \"turnus\" of the Rota, if the Rota was found to have erred in procedure (\"\"de procedendo\"\").\n\nThe Roman Rota proceedings are governed by a specific set of rules, the \"Normae Romanae Rotae Tribunalis\", promulgated in 1994 by Pope John Paul II. Only advocates who are registered in a specific list are allowed to represent the parties before the Tribunal.\n\nSince Pope Benedict XVI issued the \"motu proprio\" \"Quaerit semper\" the Rota has had exclusive competence to dispense from marriages \"ratum sed non consummatum\" and is also competent to examine cases concerning the nullity of sacred ordination, in accordance with both universal and proper law.\nIn recognition of the Tribunal's almost 800 years of history and signal reputation, the Prelate Auditors, by exception to numerous norms promulgated by both Popes Paul VI and John Paul II, are to be addressed with the traditional title \"Most Illustrious and Most Reverend\" (\"\"Illustrissimus ac Reverendissimus\". The dean of the Rota, even if not already consecrated a bishop, is to be addressed with the traditional title of \"Your Excellency\" (\"\"Excellentia Tua\"\"). All Prelate Auditor Judges of the Rota are styled, \"Most Reverend Monsignor.\"\n\nThe active auditors of the Rota, with their dates of appointment by the pope, are:\n\n\n\n"}

He was a fairly versatile player and was able to play in defence as well as midfield. He works in the Russian Football Union in two positions - \"director of regional policies and international relations\" and \"anti-discrimination and anti-racism officer\".\n\nHe played for clubs in Russia, France and England. Smertin retired from professional football in 2008 after having his contract with Fulham terminated and discovering a new career in politics.\n\nHe was the captain of the Russian national team, and earned 55 caps from 1998 to 2006, representing the nation at the 2002 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2004.\n\nBorn in Barnaul, Russian SFSR, Smertin has previously played for Dinamo Barnaul, Zarya Leninsk-Kuznetsky, Uralan Elista, Lokomotiv Moscow, and French team Girondins Bordeaux before moving on to Chelsea. His older brother Yevgeni Smertin played football professionally as well.\n\nClaudio Ranieri brought Smertin to Chelsea from Bordeaux in August 2003 for £3.45m, before loaning him out to Portsmouth for the 2003–04 season. After some impressive performances at Fratton Park, most notably in Pompey's 1–0 victory over Manchester United, Smertin returned to London. However, Ranieri had now been succeeded by José Mourinho, who had made his own midfield signing in compatriot Tiago Mendes, adding to a midfield that already boasted Frank Lampard, Claude Makelele, Geremi, and Scott Parker. Smertin only played a bit-part role for the team in 2004–05 as Chelsea won the title, but made enough appearances to earn a medal (16 in total). He did however score his first and only Chelsea goal this season, in the 3–1 Champions League win over Porto.\n\nHe was ultimately deemed surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge and was loaned out to Charlton Athletic for the 2005–06 season. At Charlton, he was a starter and had some impressive performances. In March 2006, he was transferred to Dynamo Moscow, for a fee of £1 million.\n\nSmertin played a total of 22 games for Dynamo Moscow before being transfer listed, alongside several other newly signed players, such as Maniche, Francisco Lima, Costinha and Giourkas Seitaridis in Andrey Kobelev's massive attempt at rebuilding the team for the new season.\n\nAfter Smertin's release from Dynamo Moscow, he returned to England, signing for Fulham on a two and a half year deal that would see him remain at the club until the summer of 2009. He started most of the opening games of the 2007–08 season but the arrival of fellow-midfielder Danny Murphy on transfer deadline day restricted his playing opportunities. In addition, he suffered from several injury problems. When fit, Simon Davies and Danny Murphy were often preferred as the midfield pairing. On 30 August 2008, Fulham manager Roy Hodgson informed Smertin that he was free to leave the club. The following day the club cancelled his contract with immediate effect.\n\nSmertin made his debut for Russia in 1998 in a 1–0 defeat against Iceland; in the same match he received a red card. He was capped 55 times for Russia, and was selected for the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004. He was made captain in June 2004, and was succeeded in that role by Andrey Arshavin.He became the winner Cyprus International Football Tournament2003 \n\nIn July 2015, Smertin was an assistant at the draw for 2018 World Cup qualification in St Petersburg.\n\nOn 21 February 2017, he was named Russian Football Union anti-racism and discrimination inspector ahead of the 2018 World Cup. In October 2018, he was appointed director of regional policies and international relations of the Russian Football Union (while keeping his anti-racism position). At the same time he left FC Dynamo Moscow advisor position he held up to that point.\n\nSmertin is married to fellow Siberian Larisa, and also has a son. After failing to find a new club after leaving Fulham, Smertin turned his hand to politics back home in Russia.

{"id": "2118195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118195", "title": "Voyage (novel)", "text": "Voyage (novel)\n\nVoyage is a 1996 hard science fiction novel by British author Stephen Baxter. The book depicts a crewed mission to Mars as it might have been in another timeline, one where John F. Kennedy survived the assassination attempt on him on November 22, 1963. \"Voyage\" won a Sidewise Award for Alternate History, and was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1997.\n\nIn 1999, it was adapted as a radio serial for BBC Radio 4 by Dirk Maggs.\n\nThe book tells the story in flashbacks during the actual Mars mission of the chronicalised history until the mission's beginning. The point of divergence for this alternate timeline happens on November 22, 1963, where John F. Kennedy survived the assassination (Jacqueline Kennedy was killed, hence the renaming of the Kennedy Space Center as the Jacqueline B. Kennedy Space Center), but was crippled and thus incapacitated, as Lyndon B. Johnson is still sworn in. On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Joe Muldoon walk on the Moon, and Nixon's \"most historic phone call\" is joined by a call from former President Kennedy, committing the United States to send a crewed mission to Mars, which Nixon backs as part of his fateful decision to decide the future of crewed spaceflight, instead of deciding on the Space Shuttle program as he did in our timeline.\n\nPreparations for this new goal include slashing the number of Moon landings so funding and leftover Apollo spacecraft hardware can go towards the efforts of the crewed Mars mission. Apollo 12 still lands, Apollo 13 still suffers its disaster, but Apollo 14 is crewed by the astronauts of the cancelled Apollo 15 mission to carry out the scientific experiments on the lunar surface, and is the last crewed Moon landing. At the same time, the NERVA program is revived to become the chosen Mars spacecraft development, with larger tests in Nevada, but without containment and plagued with engineering problems.\n\nThe book centres around chronicling the lives of the future Mars mission astronauts, NASA and contractor personnel all involved in making the mission become a reality, and the shifts within NASA's astronaut and management hierarchy throughout the mission's preparations, including female geologist Natalie York's quest to become an astronaut, and her stormy relationships with fellow astronaut Ben Priest and NERVA engineer Mike Conlig. Other astronauts include Ralph Gershon, a former fighter-bomber pilot involved in illegal bombing missions in Cambodia during the Vietnam War whose dream is to be the first black man in space, and Phil Stone, a veteran Air Force test pilot-turned-astronaut who has flown in a long-term stay on a lunar orbital station before the Mars mission.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Skylab Space Station is launched, but apparently as a wet workshop design that is based on the Saturn IB S-IVB upper stage called \"Skylab A\". The Saturn V that might have launched Skylab in our timeline instead launches \"Skylab B\", a lunar orbit space station unofficially named \"Moonlab\", also a wet workshop based on the S-IVB. The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project is instead a series of visits by the Apollo Command/Service Module to Salyut space stations, and Soyuz missions to both Skylab and Moonlab. To facilitate the latter, the Soviets finally finish work on their N-1. The Skylab/Moonlab programs lead to improvements in the design of the Apollo Command/Service Module. A Block III CSM is produced using battery power in place of fuel cells, followed by the Block IV and V, which have a degree of reusability (modular construction and resistance to salt water corrosion). Also chronicled is the development of the experimental 'Mars Excursion Module' by small aerospace firm Columbia Aviation as it struggles against larger rival contractors of NASA and its engineers working painstakingly against the technical challenges of a working and reliable Mars lander.\n\nA test of the NERVA, called \"Apollo-N\", is finally launched atop the modified Saturn VN, but suffers from pogo oscillations in the S-IC first stage. This damages the NERVA upper stage, which catastrophically fails once fired in orbit; despite returning to Earth safely, the entire crew (including Ben Priest) is killed by radiation poisoning, and the space program nearly collapses from hostile political and public opinion against the use of nuclear power in space, and the seemingly unnecessary risks and reasons of a Mars mission.\n\nIn the aftermath, a new Mars mission plan dubbed \"Ares\" is drawn up, utilising the upgraded Saturn V-B, which has numerous improvements, including the use of solid rocket boosters to double its payload. \"Ares\" also uses on-orbit assembly of a different long duration Mars-ship using wet-workshop Saturn rocket components as the propulsion systems as well as a Skylab habitat module and external tanks to hold extra fuel. \"Ares\" performs a Venus flyby reminiscent of the Manned Venus Flyby NASA planned in the aftermath of the original Apollo program, but done in this timeline for gravitational assistance, and finally lands at Mangala Valles on March 27, 1986.\n\nHowever, as a side effect, a number of uncrewed probes – including the Viking program, Pioneer Venus project, \"Mariner 10\", \"Pioneers 10\" and \"11\", and the Voyager program – are cancelled so that their funding can be redirected to the crewed Mars mission, although another Mariner orbiter is sent to Mars to help prepare for the crewed landing. As a result, although humans walk on Mars, their knowledge of the Solar System, including Mars itself and especially the outer solar system planets which never get visited without the Pioneer/Voyager missions, is far less than in reality.\n\n\nThe allohistorical setting of the novel was further explored in the short story \"Prospero One\", in which Baxter focuses on alternate developments in the 1960s British space programme – namely, its first and only crewed flight. The short story was originally published in issue 116 of \"Interzone\", in October 1996.\n\n"}

His major achievements include a bronze medal at the 2000 Olympic Games and finishing second in the general classification at the 2004 and 2006 Tour de France. Klöden is a tall, lightly built racer with enough strength to place high in the overall classifications of the Grand Tours, but his performances have been afflicted by injuries.\n\nKlöden was born in Mittweida in 1975. Before he turned professional, he won the bronze medal in the Under 23 World Time Trial Championships in 1996, and two stages at the International Rheinland-Pfalz Rundfahrt in 1997.\n\nKlöden signed with \"\" (later T-Mobile Team) in 1998, and in his first pro season he won the Niedersachsen-Rundfahrt's General classifications (GC) and the prologue of the Tour de Normandie. In 1999, he won a stage at the Portuguese Tour of Algarve. But the first of his great seasons came in 2000, where after notching two important victories in the GC of Paris–Nice and Tour of the Basque Country, he went on to obtain the bronze medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, after fellow German Jan Ullrich and Kazakh Alexander Vinokourov, two riders with whom he would spend several seasons on T-Mobile.\n\nAfter that came three injury plagued seasons in which he gained no victories. He was forced to abandon the 2003 Tour de France due to a fractured tailbone. 2004 saw his cycling rebirth as he won the German National Road Racing Championships and so continued T-Mobile/Team Telekom's winning streak, which went back to Bernd Gröne's 1993 win of these Championships. Klöden held his great moment of form until the Tour de France, which began one week later. In that Tour, which he began as a domestique for Ullrich, he did not win any stage but finished second overall after taking second place from Italian Ivan Basso in the final time trial. Ullrich, whom Klöden was supposed to be supporting, finished fourth that year, the only time he finished outside the top three in the Tour de France. Finishing ahead of Ullrich brought Klöden international fame and rumours circulated that he was moving to or , where he would have led the team, but instead he stayed at T-Mobile with Ullrich.\nIn the 2005 season he won a stage at the Bayern-Rundfahrt. Klöden as well as teammates Ullrich and Vinokourov were considered among the challengers for the 2005 Tour de France overall victory, with Ullrich as the strongest bid. Klöden contributed to the team success of T-Mobile in the race that saw Ullrich finish 3rd and Vinokourov finish fifth. On stage 8 in the Vosges Mountains, he attacked halfway up the final climb of the day and eventually took the K.O.M. points, catching breakaway leader Pieter Weening right at the summit. On the way down to the finish in Geradmer, he lost the sprint finish in the closest Tour de France finish of all time – (9.6 millimetres or 0.0002 secs) until stage 7 of the 2017 Tour de France when Marcel Kittel beat Edvald Boasson Hagen ( 4.0 millimetres or 0.00003 secs). Later, he withdrew from the Tour at stage 17 into Revel, having crashed during the 16th stage and fracturing a bone in his right wrist.\n\nIn the Tour of 2006, Klöden became one of the favorites for the overall victory when Ullrich, Vinokourov and Basso did not start. Vinokourov did not participate because of his teammates doping scandal, which caused his Astana team to fall below the minimum six riders to start. After somewhat weak performances in the first mountain stages, Klöden was in good shape in the Alps, climbing in the overall ranking. Klöden was very strong in the closing time trial where he finished second after his teammate Serhiy Honchar, climbing from fourth to the third place in the general classification over Carlos Sastre. On stage 11 to the Pla D'Beret, Klöden was dropped by the leading group and lost about 1:30mins, which cost him dearly. On Stage 15, he performed strongly, dropping everyone, except eventual overall winner Floyd Landis. On Stage 16, Kloden again performed well, finishing fourth on the stage, however on stage 17, he again cracked on the Col de Joux Plane, but recovered on the descent, thanks mainly to the help given to him by teammate Patrik Sinkewitz.\n\nOn 27 August 2006, Klöden announced that he would ride for in the 2007 season, although Alexander Vinokourov was the team captain. This announcement came as something of a surprise to the cycling community because Klöden, despite his talent and accomplishments, would almost certainly not be the leader of that team, which was organized around Vinokourov. During the Tour de France, he rode well, but had to help Astana captain Vinokourov, and lost a few minutes. An accident almost saw the repeat of his 2003 Tour injury, but this time the injury to the coccyx was just a hairline fracture and he was able to continue. Astana formally withdrew from the 2007 Tour de France on 24 July, when Vinokourov's doping test was found to be positive.\n\nHis racing in September was interrupted by injury, following an accident while out training when a car crossed his path forcing him to swerve, Klöden ended up in a ditch. Although an X-ray showed no broken bones, he missed the GP de Plouay and the Tour of Poland.\n\nHis 2008 season was uneventful in grand tours though he won the Tour of Romandie that year and he came second in the Tour de Suisse. His 2009 Tour de France was mainly serving as a domestique for Alberto Contador and Lance Armstrong though after stage 15 Kloden sat 4th overall. Klodens podium chances closed in however on stage 17 when his teammate Alberto Contador put in a controversial attack dropping Kloden allowing the Andy and Frank Schleck to gain over 2 minutes over him. He would later end up finishing 6th overall that year though he would end up moving into 5th overall after Lance Armstrong's titles were stripped.\n\nOn 2 October 2009 it was confirmed that Klöden would join for the 2010 season\n\nIn 2009 allegations emerged claiming that Andreas Klöden used the Freiburg University Clinic for an illegal blood transfusion during the 2006 Tour de France. Later, Kloden and others apart of the T-Mobile Team, Matthias Kessler and Patrick Sinkewitz were confirmed by Freiberg doctors to have blood doped at the University during the 2006 Tour de France where their blood was held.\nAt his retirement, Klöden denied that he ever used doping. He had made an agreement with prosecutors paid an undisclosed amount to a charity, to stop the investigation, because he felt that the investigation hindered his career.\n\nKlöden had an uneventful 2010 season. He finished the 2010 Tour de France in 14th place 16’36” behind Contador. Contador was later disqualified, resulting in a 13th place 15'57' behind Andy Schleck. His other biggest finishes were 8th in Tour de Suisse and Eneco Tour.\n\n2011 saw a rebirth of Klöden's career when he won the 2011 Tour of the Basque Country while also finished 2nd in Paris–Nice and getting a stage victory. He also had 2 ITT victories in Giro del Trentino and Critérium International. He carried his good form into the 2011 Tour de France but crashed and had to withdraw because of two crashes that injured his back. He later entered the Vuelta as co-leader with Brajkovic but withdrew.\n\nIn 2012, Klöden signed with RadioShack-NissanTrek. He finished the 2012 Tour de France 11th place, 17'54\" behind Wiggins. He also finished 4th in the USA Pro Cycling Challenge.\n\nKlöden continued to ride for Radioshack in 2013. He finished 9th in both the 2013 Volta ao Algarve and 2013 Paris-Nice early on in the season. His first top five finish came in the 2013 Tour of Belgium, where he finished fourth. He lost time early on in the Pyrenees in the 2013 Tour de France, forcing him to switch his goals from the general classification to stage wins. He made the breakaway on stage 16 to Gap, finishing in fifth place. He tried his luck again on stage 19 to Le Grand-Bornand. After finishing second there in the 2004 Tour de France behind Lance Armstrong; he finished second again, this time after Rui Costa who had also won the stage to Gap. He finished the Tour 30th place, 1h02'43\" behind winner Chris Froome.\n\nIn October 2013, Klöden announced his retirement from cycling after a sixteen-year professional career.\n\n"}

At the 26th Genie Awards in 2004, she was nominated for an \"Achievement in Direction\" and \"Original Screenplay\" Genie Award for \"Bittersweet Memories (Ma vie en cinémascope)\". In 1994, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2000, she was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec. Filiatrault received a Governor General's Performing Arts Award for her work in television in 1999.\n\nFiliatrault attained star status on TV in the 1960s, co-starring with Dominique Michel in the Radio-Canada television series \"Moi et l'autre\" (1967–71) and in many editions of Radio-Canada's annual New Year's special, \"Bye Bye\". She had further success in \"Chez Denise\" (1978–1982), \"Le 101, avenue des Pins\" (1984–85) and \"Denise... aujourd'hui\" (1990–91).\n\nIn addition to her television career, Filiatrault also performed in films and on stage, notably in works by Michel Tremblay. She was known to perform both comic and dramatic roles, such as André Brassard's film version of Tremblay's \"Once Upon a Time in the East (Il était une fois dans l'Est)\" (1974), in Denys Arcand's \"Gina\" (1975), in several Franco-Canadian co-productions, specifically Gilles Carle's \"The Death of a Lumberjack (La Mort d'un bûcheron)\" (1973), \"Fantastica\" (1980) and, in 1981, Carle's \"The Plouffe Family (Les Plouffe)\", playing the tormented Cécile.\n\nFollowing \"Les Plouffe\", Filiatrault took a break from film, concentrating more in writing and directing for theatre and summer comedy. Filiatrault then decided to take the leap to directing cinema by adapting Tremblay's novel \"C't'à ton tour, Laura Cadieux\" into the 1998 film \"It's Your Turn, Laura Cadieux\", presenting the world of overweight women yearning for love and affection. Filiatrault opted for a simple yet effective style that showcased the talents of the film's strong female leads. This dramatic comedy scored such success that Filiatrault wrote and directed the 1999 sequel \"Laura Cadieux II (Laura Cadieux... la suite)\", in which she further developed the characters and their world.\n\nIn 2002, she produced a new comedy fantasy, \"Alice's Odyssey (L'Odyssée d'Alice Tremblay)\", which received a lukewarm response from critics and moviegoers. In 2003, taking advantage of the success of her motion picture characters, Filiatrault produced a television miniseries for TVA, \"Le Petit monde de Laura Cadieux\" (2003), before tackling a new film \"Bittersweet Memories (Ma vie en cinémascope)\" (2004), a dramatic biography of 1930s-1950s singer Alys Robi (played by Pascale Bussières). In 2006 Filiatrault received the Jutra Award for her overall career.\n\nAs artistic director of the Théâtre du Rideau Vert, she and the theatre were criticized in January 2015 by a coalition of Montreal arts groups for a year-end production in which a Caucasian actor portrayed hockey player P.K. Subban in blackface. Filiatrault responded that she was \"shocked, outraged, and humiliated\" by the reaction, saying that she had been in show business for 60 years and was the first person to hire a black Quebecer on television.\n"}

While the idea may have an approbatory sense of prudence or diplomacy, the phrase is often either used euphemistically to denote dissimulation (misleading by withholding pertinent information) or else used ironically to mean outright lying.\n\nThe \"Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations\" and Kenneth Rose trace the idea to Edmund Burke, the first of whose \"Letters on a Regicide Peace\", written in 1795 and published in 1796, included: \nThe religious sense of \"economy\" was applied to religious truth by John Henry Newman, based on Jesus' injunction not to cast . Newman advocated \"cautious dispensation of the truth, after the manner of a discreet and vigilant steward\" while being \"careful ever to maintain \"substantial\" truth\". Mental reservation is a somewhat related idea also associated with Roman Catholic ethics.\n\nA jocular reference to the basic concept was made by Mark Twain in \"Following the Equator\" in 1897:\nThe precise phrase \"economical with the truth\" is attested from 1897. It was used in the New Zealand House of Representatives in 1923, and the House of Commons of Canada in 1926; \"over-economical with the truth\" was used in the British House of Commons in 1968. The phrase was used somewhat ironically to refer to one of the Gestapo involved in the rounding up and killing of escaped PoW's following The Great Escape from Stalag Luft III in Paul Brickhill's book, \"The Great Escape\", originally published in 1950. Alan Durant of Middlesex University describes the phrase prior to 1986 as having \"extremely restricted currency\" and as a rule used in allusion to either Burke or Twain.\n\n\"Economical with the truth\" became a political catchphrase in the United Kingdom in 1986 during the \"Spycatcher\" trial in the Australian Supreme Court of New South Wales, when Robert Armstrong, the UK Cabinet Secretary, was questioned by Malcolm Turnbull, and described a letter thus:\n\nBob Ellis wrote that the audience had laughed at \"bent untruth\", and that Armstrong expected a laugh for \"economical with the truth\" but got none. Political opponents of the government's actions in the \"Spycatcher\" case derided Armstrong's distinction.\n\nIn 1992, when Alan Clark was questioned at the Old Bailey by Geoffrey Robertson in an Arms-to-Iraq case, he accounted for the discrepancies between his testimony and statements he had made previously. His response became notorious: \n\nAlan Durant was an expert witness in a 1992 libel suit brought by a man who had been described as \"economical with the truth\". The defendant claimed the words did not imply the plaintiff was a liar. Durant, after examining a corpus of uses of the phrase, felt that lying had become the default meaning, but might be over-ridden based on the context. The earlier allusion to Burke or Twain was no longer common. The libel suit was settled out of court.\n\n\n"}

A creative director at the Richards Group ad agency heard him on NPR and hired him to record a commercial for Motel 6. Bodett ad-libbed the famous line \"We'll leave the light on for you\" and has been the chain's spokesperson ever since. The director David Fowler hired him because Bodett \"sound[ed] like the kind of person who stays there.\" Fowler said he thought, \"Gosh, if I only had an account for a national budget motel brand with a sense of humor and humility, I could make a heck of an advertising campaign with this guy.\"\n\nIn 2005, Motel 6 began using Bodett for their wake-up calls.

Built by Hertfordshire carpenter Jonas Fosbrooke about 1590, the bed measures 3.38m long and 3.26m wide (ten by eleven feet) and can 'reputedly... accommodate at least four couples'. Many of those who have used the bed have carved their names into its posts.\n\nLike many objects from that time, the bed is carved with patterns derived from European Renaissance ornament. Originally it would have been brightly painted, and traces of these colours can still be seen on the figures on the bed-head. The design of the marquetry panels is derived from the work of Dutch artist Hans Vredeman de Vries (1527–1604) and the panels were probably made by English craftsmen working in London in the late Elizabethan period. The bed-hangings are modern re-creations of fabrics of the period.\n\nBy the 19th century, the bed had been moved from the White Hart Inn to the Saracen's Head, another Ware inn. In 1870, William Henry Teale, the owner of the Rye House, acquired the bed and put it to use in a pleasure garden. When interest in the garden waned in the 1920s, the bed was sold. In 1931, it was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nFrom April 2012, the bed was exhibited for a year in Ware Museum, on loan from the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\n\n"}

The analogy is to that of construction on greenfield land where there is no need to work within the constraints of existing buildings or infrastructure.\n\nIn software development, a greenfield project could be one of developing a system for a totally new environment, without concern for integrating with other systems, especially not legacy systems. Such projects are deemed as higher risk, as they are often for new infrastructure, new customers, and even new owners. For this reason, agile software development is often deemed the best approach, as it proposes how to handle those risks by developing small slices of complete functionality and getting them in the hands of customers (internal or external) quickly for immediate feedback.\n\nIn wireless engineering, a greenfield project could be that of rolling out a new generation of cell phone networks. The first cellular telephone networks were built primarily on tall existing tower structures or on high ground in an effort to cover as much territory as possible in as little time as possible and with a minimum number of base stations. These early wireless telephone network designs were later augmented with additional base stations and antennas to handle the growing demand for additional voice traffic and higher network capacity. As wireless networks quickly evolved, it was evident that the earlier designs constrained the growth of the network. As governments made more radio spectrum available for licensed wireless telephone operators in the late 1980s, entirely new networks were built that performed better than legacy networks because their designs were free from the constraints of existing systems. Today, any new network designed from scratch to enable new Radio Access Network technologies, such as 3G, 4G, and WiMAX are also referred to as greenfield projects.\n\nLiteral examples of greenfield projects are new factories, power plants, airports which are built from scratch on greenfield land. Those facilities which are modified/upgraded are called brownfield land projects (often the pre-existing site/facilities are contaminated/polluted.)\n\nIn transportation industries (e.g., automotive, aircraft, engines) the equivalent concept is called \"clean sheet design\".\n\nGreenfield also has meaning in sales. A greenfield opportunity refers to a marketplace that is completely untapped and free for the taking.\n\nFrom an Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) perspective, an IT organization that is being set up from scratch is said to start from a \"greenfield\" situation. This is because it would have no live services or practices in place to start with.\n\n\n"}

An example of such an early 16th-century four-poster resides in Crathes Castle, which was made for the original castle owners in the Burnett of Leys family.\n\nFour-poster beds were developed for several practical reasons. Bedrooms often had draughts and could be cold at night: the curtains could be closed to help keep the occupant of the bed warm. The curtains also helped to give privacy to the sleepers, since servants and bodyguards often slept in the same room, especially in the case of royalty, served by a special group of servants of the bedchamber (usually noble courtiers), lords and ladies of the bedchamber, esquires of the body, etc. In the mediaeval era and up to the 18th century beds were items of furniture on which great personages and royalty made public appearances and held court, thus they were designed to impress. A four poster bed with backboard and tester allowed extra space from which to display and hang expensive fabrics and heraldic decoration. \n\nFour-poster beds are mentioned in numerous Irish sagas and were recorded in early Irish manuscripts. In the 12th century tale of Acallam na Senóradh, in the wooing of Credhe, Cael ua Nemhnainn cites in a poem \"Four posts round every bed there are, of gold and silver laid together cunningly; in each post's head a crystal gem: they make heads not unpleasant [to behold]\", when speaking of a fairy-mansion on the Paps of Anu, in Co. Kerry.\n\n"}

He went on to be a photographer for various record labels by 1972, as well as being a freelance music writer and photographer for the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\". He wanted to be in the record industry and was first noticed and hired as a publicist in 1974 by Atlantic Records executive Earl McGrath. His initial role at Atlantic was as a writer and photographer, while he continued to review concerts on the weekend for the \"Inquirer\", commuting from New York.\n\nKalodner was headhunted as the first A&R executive for David Geffen's new label Geffen Records in 1980, where he worked with Asia, White Zombie, Madness, XTC, Whitesnake, Wang Chung, Nelson and Aerosmith. He brought Jimmy Page and Sammy Hagar success as solo artists, and was responsible for the musical collaboration Coverdale•Page.\n\nHis achievements included signing Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins to Atlantic Records in the 1970s. Contradicting claims that Kalodner signed AC/DC and Foreigner, fellow Atlantic executives Phil Carson and Jerry Greenberg have asserted in interviews that they, and not Kalodner, signed those artists (Carson signing AC/DC and Greenberg signing Foreigner). However, Mick Jones laid this theory to rest himself, telling a recent interviewer that Kalodner did indeed sign Foreigner.\n\nKalodner also placed songs on soundtracks of such films as \"Top Gun\" and \"Footloose\". Kalodner followed Aerosmith to Columbia in the 1990s, where he also worked with Cher, Santana, Journey, Manowar, Chicago, Heart, Iron Maiden, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Ted Nugent, REO Speedwagon, Mars Electric, and the Black Crowes, among others.\n\nKalodner considered that the best example of his contribution to an artist's success was his role in Aerosmith's 1993 \"Get a Grip\" album, for the reasons that \"...first of all, I made them rerecord the whole record completely. Second of all, I made them write with all these different people. They were very resistant. The record is an interesting eclectic record with, like, five hit singles, very rare in music, and Bruce Fairbairn produced it. And I got Brendan O'Brien to mix it, who became a giant producer. So for all those reasons, and, of course, it sold like twenty million copies worldwide.\"\n\nKalodner's unique role was underlined by the fact that he is usually credited on albums for simply being himself. The phrase \"John Kalodner: John Kalodner\" originated with Foreigner's 1978 \"Double Vision\" album, when the album's producer, Keith Olsen, was wondering how to credit Kalodner's involvement with the band and the album. In keeping with the double vision theme, Foreigner guitarist Mick Jones came up with idea of doubling Kalodner's name. \n\nKalodner retired from the music business in 2006. Until late 2005, he had been the senior vice-president of A&R at Sanctuary Records Group. He subsequently sold most of his industry awards and RIAA record plaques to Scott Roderick President of Rock-N-Roll Warehouse, donating the proceeds to the City of Hope cancer research center. In 2014, he was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame, in the \"Visionary\" category.\n\n"}

As there are no diplomatic relations between the two states, it has functioned as North Korea's \"de facto\" embassy in Japan.\n\nChongryon's headquarters are in Chiyoda, Tokyo, and there are prefectural and regional head offices and branches throughout Japan. However, the organization has run into severe financial trouble, with debts of over US$750 million, and has been ordered by court in 2012 to dispose of most of its assets, including its Tokyo headquarters.\n\nThere are numerous organisations affiliated with Chongryon, including eighteen mass propaganda bodies and twenty-three business enterprises. One of the most important business sectors is pachinko. It also operates about 60 Korean schools and a Korean university, as well as banks and other facilities in Japan.\n\nThe other main organization is called Mindan, the Korean Residents Union In Japan, and consists of Zainichi Koreans who have adopted South Korean nationality. Currently, among 610,000 Korean residents in Japan who have not adopted Japanese nationality, 25 percent are members of Chongryon, and 65 percent are members of Mindan. Chongryon's strong links to North Korea, its allegiance to the North Korean ideology and its opposition to integration of Koreans into Japanese society have made it the more controversial of the two organisations in Japan.\n\nLong-term ethnic Korean residents in Japan primarily consist of those, and descendants of, ethnic Koreans who settled in Japan as:\nA 1953 government survey revealed that 93% were from the southern half of the Korean peninsula.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1945, ethnic Koreans were Japanese nationals. The end of the Second World War left the nationality status of Koreans in an ambiguous position, as no recognized functional government existed on the Korean Peninsula (the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, a government-in-exile, was only somewhat recognized internationally and was not a formal Korean government until South Korea's formation in 1948). Their nationality was provisionally registered under the name of \"Joseon\" (Chōsen in Japanese, , ), the old name of undivided Korea.\n\nThe 1948 declaration of independence by both South and North Korea made Joseon a defunct nation. Those with Joseon nationality were allowed to re-register their nationality to a South Korean one; however the same did not apply to North Korea due to the fact that Japan only recognises South Korea as the legitimate government of Korea, so supporters of the North retained their Joseon nationality.\n\nEthnic Koreans in Japan established the Association of Koreans in Japan in 1945, which followed a socialist ideology, and was banned in 1949 by the order of Allied occupation army. The United Democratic Front of Korea in Japan was established in 1951, which was banned due to suspected involvement in the 1952 May Day riots.\n\nIn 1952, the North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung called on the socialist zainichi Korean movement to be coordinated in close contact with the North Korean government, and to fight, not for a socialist revolution in Japan, but for the socialist reunification of the Korean peninsula.\n\nChongryon was established on May 25, 1955 by Han Duk-su, who was an activist for leftist labor movements in Japan. (The pro-South Mindan had already branched off from the main organisation in 1946).\n\nIn the late 1950s, Chongryon conducted a campaign to persuade Zainichi Koreans to migrate to North Korea. The campaign was vehemently opposed by Mindan which organised hunger strikes and train obstructions. Some 87,000 Zainichi Koreans and about 6000 Japanese spouses moved to the North. According to a defector, himself a former returnee, many petitioned to be returned to Japan and in response were sent to political prison camps. Japanese research puts the number of Zainichi Korean returnees condemned to prison camps at around 10,000.\nIn 1990 Su-to Ha, former vice chief of organization for Chongryon who was expelled in 1972 for demanding democratic reforms, led a rally in Tokyo of 500 to protest against North Korea's human rights violations, in which protesters accused North Korea of holding the ex-Zainichi returnees captive in order to siphon money off remittances from their relatives in Japan.\n\nThe South Korean National Election Commission considered preventing Chongryon residents from voting in the 2012 South Korean Presidential Election.\n\nThe North Korean Chongryon-affiliated \"Fukushima Korean School\" sheltered 18 Japanese citizens from March 18 until the end of March. However, the Chongryon criticized the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan for not officially recognizing North Korea as one of the countries that sent humanitarian aid to the survivors of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.\n\nFollowing the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in December 2011, Chongryon ordered members to keep a low profile. Pupils at its schools were barred from speaking to reporters, Japanese and Western, who were turned away from facilities.<!--><ref>\n"}

Shortly after, he began taking guitar lessons with Stephen Fentock and began to fall in love with music, writing his first musical pieces. After two years of work with Radio-Canada, in February 1958, he began recording the first songs that would eventually comprise his first album \"Jean-Pierre\". However, it was not until 1961 that he became known to the public, with the release of his second album, \"Rendez-vous à La Coda\".\n\nFrom 1962 to 1970, Ferland spent much time in Europe (mainly in France and Belgium), writing music and recording albums, as well as performing at a multitude of venues, including shows in Olympia and Bobino. In 1968 he won the Académie Charles Cros Award.\n\nIn 1970 he launched a disc \"Jaune\" which sold 60 000 copies within a year and was followed by live shows at the Montreal's Place des Arts. In 1974 his song \"T'es mon amour, t'es ma maîtresse\" recorded with Ginette Reno became a hit.\n\nIn 1976 Ferland was one of the 5 performers (along with Claude Léveillée, Gilles Vigneault, Robert Charlebois et Yvon Deschamps) in the giant outdoor concert for the National Holiday on June 21 in Quebec and on June 23 in Montreal, titled 1 fois 5. The album of the same name followed and in 1977 it received the Académie Charles Cros Award.\n\nIn the 1980s Ferland combined songwriting and touring with a career as a television presenter for several popular shows: \"Station soleil\" (Radio Québec, 1981-1987), \"Tapis rouge\" (SRC, 1986), \"L'autobus du showbusiness\" (SRC, 1987) et \"Ferland/Nadeau\" (Télé-Métropole, 1990). \n\nOn October 12, 2006 Jean-Pierre Ferland had a stroke caused by fatigue and stress, causing him to cancel his final concert at the Bell Centre the following day. He did recover quickly, allowing him to give his farewell concert on January 13, 2007. Since retiring from the spotlight, Ferland has made an appearance on the plains of Abraham to perform with Céline Dion on August 22, 2008. Other guest stage appearances, radio and television engagements followed, including coaching in La Voix (season 1). In 2017 Jean-Pierre Ferland released an album \"La vie m'emeut l'amour m'etonne.\" \n\nIn 1996, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, in recognition of his 30 albums released and 450 songs written. In 2003, he was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec.\nIn 2005, Jean-Pierre Ferland was honoured by the AV Trust of Canada for the album \"Jaune\" with collaboration of Michael Georges. In 1999, Ferland was the recipient of the National Achievement Award at the annual SOCAN Awards held in Montreal. On 5 August 2000, Ferland performed at the wedding of the Hell's Angel René Charlebois, and at the same wedding posed for photographs with Maurice \"Mom\" Boucher, the leader of the Angels in Quebec at the time.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118244", "title": "Bago, Myanmar", "text": "Bago, Myanmar\n\nBago (formerly spelt Pegu; , ), formerly known as Hanthawaddy, is a city and the capital of the Bago Region in Myanmar. It is located north-east of Yangon.\n\nThe Burmese name Bago (ပဲခူး) is likely derived from the Mon language place name Bagaw (, ). Until the Burmese government renamed English place names throughout the country in 1989, Bago was known as Pegu. Bago was formerly known as Hanthawaddy (; ; ; lit. \"she who possesses the sheldrake\"), the name of a Burmese-Mon kingdom.\n\nVarious Mon language chronicles report widely divergent foundation dates of Bago, ranging from 573 CE to 1152 CE while the \"Zabu Kuncha\", an early 15th century Burmese administrative treatise, states that Pegu was founded in 1276/77 CE. The earliest extant evidence of Pegu as a place dates only to the late Pagan period (1212 and 1266) when it was still a small town, not even a provincial capital. After the collapse of the Pagan Empire, Bago became part of the breakaway Kingdom of Martaban by the 1290s.\n\nThe small settlement grew increasingly important in the 14th century as the region became most populous in the Mon-speaking kingdom. In 1369, King Binnya U made Bago the capital. The city remained the capital until the kingdom's fall in 1538.\n\nDuring the reign of King Razadarit, Bago and Ava Kingdom were engaged in the Forty Years' War. The peaceful reign of Queen Shin Sawbu came to an end when she chose the Buddhist monk Dhammazedi (1471–1492) to succeed her. Under Dhammazedi, Bago became a centre of commerce and Theravada Buddhism.\n\nIn 1519, António Correia, then a merchant from the Portuguese \"casados\" settlement at Cochin landed in Bago, then known to the Portuguese as Pegu, looking for new markets for pepper from Cochin. A year later, Portuguese India Governor Diogo Lopes de Sequeira sent an ambassador to Pegu.\n\nAs a major seaport, the city was frequently visited by Europeans, among these, Gasparo Balbi and Ralph Fitch in the late 1500s. The Europeans often commented on its magnificence.\n\nThe Portuguese conquest of Pegu, following the destruction caused by the kings of Tangot and Arrakan in 1599, was described by Manuel de Abreu Mousinho in \"Breve discurso em que se conta a conquista do Reino do Pegú na India oriental feita pelos portugueses em tempo do vice-rei Aires de Saldanha, sendo capitão Salvador Ribeiro de Sousa, chamado Massinga, natural de Guimarães, a quem os naturais do Pegú elegeram por seu rei no ano de 1600\" (Brief narrative telling the conquest of Pegu in eastern India made by the Portuguese in the time of the viceroy Aires de Saldanha, being captain Salvador Ribeiro de Sousa, called Massinga, born in Guimarães, elected as their king by the natives in the year 1600), published from 1711 to 1829 with \"Peregrinaçam\" of Fernão Mendes Pinto.\n\nThe capital was looted by the viceroy of Toungoo, Minye Thihathu II of Toungoo, and then burned by the viceroy of Arakin during the Burmese–Siamese War (1594–1605). Anaukpetlun wanted to rebuild Hongsawadi, which had been deserted since Nanda Bayin had abandoned it. He was only able to build a temporary palace, however.\n\nThe Burmese capital relocated to Ava in 1634. In 1740, the Mon revolted and founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. However, a Bamar king, Alaungpaya, captured the city in May 1757.\n\nBago was rebuilt by King Bodawpaya (r. 1782-1819), but by then the river had shifted course, cutting the city off from the sea. It never regained its previous importance. After the Second Anglo-Burmese War, the British annexed Bago in 1852. In 1862, the province of British Burma was formed, and the capital moved to Yangon. The substantial differences between the colloquial and literary pronunciations, as with Burmese words, was a reason of the British corruption \"Pegu\".\n\nIn 1911, Hanthawaddy was described as a district in the Bago (or \"Pegu\") division of Lower Burma. It lay in the home district of Yangon, from which the town was detached to make a separate district in 1880. It had an area of , with a population of 48,411 in 1901, showing an increase of 22% in the past decade. Hanthawaddy and Hinthada were the two most densely populated districts in the province.\n\nHanthawaddy, as it was constituted in 1911, consisted of a vast plain stretching up from the sea between the mouth of the Irrawaddy River and the Pegu Range. Except the tract of land lying between the Pegu Range on the east and the Yangon River, the country was intersected by numerous tidal creeks, many of which were navigable by large boats and some by steamers. The headquarters of the district was in Rangoon, which was also the sub-divisional headquarters. The second sub-division had its headquarters at Insein, where there were large railway works. Cultivation was almost wholly confined to rice, but there were many vegetable and fruit gardens.\n\nToday, Hanthawaddy is one of the wards of Bago city.\n\nThe 2014 Myanmar Census reported that Bago had a population of 254,424, representing 51.8% of Bago Township's total population. The town of Bago is subdivided into 34 wards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118246", "title": "Global health", "text": "Global health\n\nGlobal health is the health of populations in the global context; it has been defined as \"the area of study, research and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in health for all people worldwide\". Problems that transcend national borders or have a global political and economic impact are often emphasized. Thus, global health is about worldwide health improvement (including mental health), reduction of disparities, and protection against global threats that disregard national borders. Global health is not to be confused with international health, which is defined as the branch of public health focusing on developing nations and foreign aid efforts by industrialized countries. Global health can be measured as a function of various global diseases and their prevalence in the world and threat to decrease life in the present day.\n\nThe predominant agency associated with global health (and international health) is the World Health Organization (WHO). Other important agencies impacting global health include UNICEF and World Food Programme. The United Nations system has also played a part with cross-sectoral actions to address global health and its underlying socioeconomic determinants with the declaration of the Millennium Development Goals and the more recent Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nGlobal health employs several perspectives that focus on the determinants and distribution of health in international contexts:\n\n\nBoth individuals and organizations working in the domain of global health often face many questions regarding ethical and human rights. Critical examination of the various causes and justifications of health inequities is necessary for the success of proposed solutions. Such issues are discussed at the bi-annual Global Summits of National Ethics/Bioethics Councils, next in March 2016 in Berlin, with experts from WHO and UNESCO, by invitation of the German Ethics Council.\n\nThe 19th century held major discoveries in medicine and public health. The Broad Street cholera outbreak of 1854 was central to the development of modern epidemiology. The microorganisms responsible for malaria and tuberculosis were identified in 1880 and 1882, respectively. The 20th century saw the development of preventive and curative treatments for many diseases, including the BCG vaccine (for tuberculosis) and penicillin in the 1920s. The eradication of smallpox, with the last naturally occurring case recorded in 1977, raised hope that other diseases could be eradicated as well.\n\nImportant steps were taken towards global cooperation in health with the formation of the United Nations (UN) and the World Bank Group in 1945, after World War II. In 1948, the member states of the newly formed United Nations gathered to create the World Health Organization. A cholera epidemic that took 20,000 lives in Egypt in 1947 and 1948 helped spur the international community to action. The WHO published its Model List of Essential Medicines, and the 1978 Alma Ata declaration underlined the importance of primary health care.\n\nAt a United Nations Summit in 2000, member nations declared eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which reflected the major challenges facing human development globally, to be achieved by 2015. The declaration was matched by unprecedented global investment by donor and recipient countries. According to the UN, these MDGs provided an important framework for development and significant progress has been made in a number of areas. However, progress has been uneven and some of the MDGs were not fully realized including maternal, newborn and child health and reproductive health. Building on the MDGs, a new Sustainable Development Agenda with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been established for the years 2016–2030. The first goal being an ambitious and historic pledge to end poverty. On 25 September 2015, the 193 countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Development Agenda titled \"Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\".\n\nIn 2015 a book titled \"To Save Humanity\" was published, with nearly 100 essays regarding today's most pressing global health issues. The essays were authored by global figures in politics, science, and advocacy ranging from Bill Clinton to Peter Piot, and addressed a wide range of issues including vaccinations, antimicrobial resistance, health coverage, tobacco use, research methodology, climate change, equity, access to medicine, and media coverage of health research.\n\nIn 2015, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery was released describing the large burden of surgical disease impacting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The shortfall in access to surgical care worldwide is estimated to affect approximately 5 billion people who do not have timely access to life-saving surgical care .\n\nThe Commission outlines the need to improve infrastructure to make the bellwether procedures – laparotomy, caesarean section, open fracture care – more widely available in LMICs in order to prevent a $12.3 trillion loss in economic productivity by 2030 as result of surgically-related morbidity and mortality .\n\nMeasures of global health include disability-adjusted life year (DALY), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and mortality rate.\n\nThe DALY is a summary measure that combines the impact of illness, disability, and mortality by measuring the time lived with disability and the time lost due to premature mortality. One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of \"healthy\" life. The DALY for a disease is the sum of the years of life lost due to premature mortality and the years lost due to disability for incident cases of the health condition.\n\nQALYs combine expected survival with expected quality of life into a single number: if an additional year of healthy life is worth a value of one (year), then a year of less healthy life is worth less than one (year). QALY calculations are based on measurements of the value that individuals place on expected years of survival. Measurements can be made in several ways: by techniques that simulate gambles about preferences for alternative states of health, with surveys or analyses that infer willingness to pay for alternative states of health, or through instruments that are based on trading off some or all likely survival time that a medical intervention might provide in order to gain less survival time of higher quality.\n\nInfant mortality and child mortality for children under age 5 are more specific than DALYs or QALYs in representing the health in the poorest sections of a population, and are thus especially useful when focusing on health equity.\n\nMorbidity measures include incidence rate, prevalence, and cumulative incidence, with incidence rate referring to the risk of developing a new health condition within a specified period of time. Although sometimes loosely expressed simply as the number of new cases during a time period, morbidity is better expressed as a proportion or a rate.\n\nThe diseases and health conditions targeted by global health initiatives are sometimes grouped under \"diseases of poverty\" versus \"diseases of affluence\", although the impact of globalization is increasingly blurring the lines between the two.\n\nInfections of the respiratory tract and middle ear are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Some respiratory infections of global significance include tuberculosis, measles, influenza, and pneumonias caused by pneumococci and \"Haemophilus influenzae\". The spread of respiratory infections is exacerbated by crowded conditions, and poverty is associated with more than a 20-fold increase in the relative burden of lung infections.\n\nDiarrhea is the second most common cause of child mortality worldwide, responsible for 17% of deaths of children under age 5. Poor sanitation can increase transmission of bacteria and viruses through water, food, utensils, hands, and flies. Dehydration due to diarrhea can be effectively treated through oral rehydration therapy with dramatic reductions in mortality. Important nutritional measures include the promotion of breastfeeding and zinc supplementation. While hygienic measures alone may be insufficient for the prevention of rotavirus diarrhea, it can be prevented by a safe and potentially cost-effective vaccine.\n\nComplications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading causes of death among women of reproductive age in many developing countries: a woman dies from complications from childbirth approximately every minute. According to the World Health Organization's 2005 World Health Report, poor maternal conditions are the fourth leading cause of death for women worldwide, after HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Most maternal deaths and injuries can be prevented, and such deaths have been largely eradicated in the developed world. Targets for improving maternal health include increasing the number of deliveries accompanied by skilled birth attendants.\n\n68 low-income countries tracked by the WHO- and UNICEF-led collaboration \"Countdown to 2015\" are estimated to hold for 97% of worldwide maternal and child deaths.\n\nThe HIV/AIDS epidemic has highlighted the global nature of human health and welfare and globalisation has given rise to a trend toward finding common solutions to global health challenges. Numerous international funds have been set up in recent times to address global health challenges such as HIV. Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 35 million people have died of HIV. Globally, 36.9 million [31.1–43.9 million] people were living with HIV at the end of 2017. An estimated 0.8% [0.6–0.9%] of adults aged 15–49 years worldwide are living with HIV, although the burden of the epidemic continues to vary considerably between countries and regions. The WHO African region remains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 25 adults (4.1%) living with HIV and accounting for nearly two-thirds of the people living with HIV worldwide. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is transmitted through unprotected sex, unclean needles, blood transfusions, and from mother to child during birth or lactation. Globally, HIV is primarily spread through sexual intercourse. The risk-per-exposure with vaginal sex in low-income countries from female to male is 0.38% and male to female is 0.3%.The infection damages the immune system, leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and eventually, death. Antiretroviral drugs prolong life and delay the onset of AIDS by minimizing the amount of HIV in the body.\n\nMalaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the parasites of the genus \"Plasmodium\". Symptoms may include fever, headaches, chills, and nausea. Each year, there are approximately 500 million cases of malaria worldwide, most commonly among children and pregnant women in developing countries. The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2016, the region was home to 90% of malaria cases and 91% of malaria deaths. The use of insecticide-treated bednets is a cost-effective way to reduce deaths from malaria, as is prompt artemisinin-based combination therapy, supported by intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy. International travellers to endemic zones are advised chemoprophylaxis with antimalarial drugs like Atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, or mefloquine\n\nIn 2010, about 104 million children were underweight, and undernutrition contributes to about one third of child deaths around the world. (Undernutrition is not to be confused with \"malnutrition\", which refers to poor \"proportion\" of food intake and can thus refer to obesity.) Undernutrition impairs the immune system, increasing the frequency, severity, and duration of infections (including measles, pneumonia, and diarrhea). Infection can further contribute to malnutrition. Deficiencies of micronutrient, such as vitamin A, iron, iodine, and zinc, are common worldwide and can compromise intellectual potential, growth, development, and adult productivity. Interventions to prevent malnutrition include micronutrient supplementation, fortification of basic grocery foods, dietary diversification, hygienic measures to reduce spread of infections, and the promotion of breastfeeding.\n\nViolence against women has been defined as: \"physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family and in the general community, including battering, sexual abuse of children, dowry-related violence, rape, female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women, forced prostitution and violence perpetrated or condoned by the state.\" In addition to causing injury, violence may increase \"women’s long-term risk of a number of other health problems, including chronic pain, physical disability, drug and alcohol abuse, and depression\". The WHO Report on global and regional estimates on violence against women found that partner abuse causes women to have 16% more chances of suffering miscarriages,41% more occurrences of pre-term birth babies and twice the likeliness of having abortions and acquiring HIV or other STD’s \n\nAlthough statistics can be difficult to obtain as many cases go unreported, it is estimated that one in every five women faces some form of violence during her lifetime, in some cases leading to serious injury or even death. Risk factors for being a perpetrator include low education, past exposure to child maltreatment or witnessing violence between parents, harmful use of alcohol, attitudes accepting of violence and gender inequality. Equality of women has been addressed in the Millennium development goals. Preventing the violence against women needs to form an essential part of the public health reforms in the form of advocation and evidence gathering. Primary prevention in the form of raising women economic empowerment facilities, microfinance and skills training social projects related to gender equality should be conducted. Activities promoting relationship and communication skills among couples, reducing alcohol access and altering societal ideologies should be organized. Childhood interventions, community and school- based education, raising media-oriented awareness and other approaches should be carried out to challenge social norms and stereotypical thought processes to promote behavioral alterations among men and raise gender equality. Trained health care providers would play a vital role in secondary and tertiary prevention of abuse, by performing early identification of women suffering from violence and contributing to the addressal of their health and psychological needs. They could be highly important in prevention of the recurrence of violence and the mitigation of its effects on the health of the abused women and their children.\nThe Member States of the World Health Assembly endorsed a plan in 2016 for reinforcing the health system’s role in addressing the global phenomenon of violence against women and girls and working towards their health and protection.\n\nApproximately 80% of deaths linked to non-communicable diseases occur in developing countries.For instance, urbanization and aging have led to increasing poor health conditions related to non-communicable diseases in India. The fastest-growing causes of disease burden over the last 26 years were diabetes (rate increased by 80%) and ischemic heart disease (up 34%). More than 60% of deaths, about 6.1 million, in 2016 were due to NCDs, up from about 38% in 1990. Increases in refugee urbanization, has led to a growing number of people diagnosed with chronic noncommunicable diseases.\n\nIn September 2011, the United Nations is hosting its first General Assembly Special Summit on the issue of non-communicable diseases. Noting that non-communicable diseases are the cause of some 35 million deaths each year, the international community is being increasingly called to take measures for the prevention and control of chronic diseases and mitigate their impacts on the world population, especially on women, who are usually the primary caregivers.\n\nFor example, the rate of type 2 diabetes, associated with obesity, has been on the rise in countries previously plagued by hunger. In low-income countries, the number of individuals with diabetes is expected to increase from 84 million to 228 million by 2030. Obesity, a preventable condition, is associated with numerous chronic diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, stroke, certain cancers, and respiratory disease. About 16% of the global burden of disease, measured as DALYs, has been accounted for by obesity.\n\nMore than one billion people were treated for at least one neglected tropical disease in 2015. Neglected tropical diseases are a diverse group of infectious diseases that are endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of 149 countries, primarily effecting low and middle income populations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. They are variously caused by bacteria (Trachoma, Leprosy), viruses (Dengue, Rabies), protozoa (Human African trypanosomiasis, Chagas), and helminths (Schistosomiasis, Onchocerciasis, Soil transmitted helminths). The Global Burden of Disease Study concluded that neglected tropical diseases comprehensively contributed to approximately 26.06 million disability-adjusted life years in 2010, as well as significant deleterious economic effects. In 2011, the World Health Organization launched a 2020 Roadmap for neglected tropical diseases, aiming for the control or elimination of 10 common diseases. The 2012 London Declaration builds on this initiative, and called on endemic countries and the international community to improve access to clean water and basic sanitation, improved living conditions, vector control, and health education, to reach the 2020 goals. In 2017, a WHO report cited 'unprecedented progress' against neglected tropical diseases since 2007, especially due to mass drug administration of drugs donated by pharmaceutical companies.\n\nSurgery remains grossly neglected in global health, famously described by Halfdan T. Mahler as the 'neglected stepchild of global health'. This particularly affects low-resource settings with weak surgical health systems. 'Global surgery' is the term now adopted to describe the rapidly developing field seeking to address this, and has been defined as 'the multidisciplinary enterprise of providing improved and equitable surgical care to the world's population, with its core tenets as the issues of need, access and quality'.\n\nSurgical diseases make up at least 11% of the global burden of disease, with a mix of injuries, malignancies, congenital anomalies, and complications of pregnancy. Globally, 4.2 million people are estimated to die within 30 days of surgery each year, with half of these occurring in low- and middle-income countries.. There is significant variation in outcomes associated with the development level of the country where surgery is taking place. A prospective study of 10,745 adults undergoing emergency abdominal surgery from 357 centres across 58 countries found that mortality is three times higher in low- compared with high-human development index (HDI) countries even when adjusted for prognostic factors. \n\nThe right to health care is a key component of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and has lacked the appropriate attention in low-income countries in recent history . Surgical diseases can result in considerable morbidity and mortality for individuals whom are unable to access appropriate care, yet in low-income countries, this category of disease has been deemed too expensive to invest in . In recent years, however, it has been recognized that surgical diseases are a neglected health problem of great proportion and requires urgent prioritization . Surgical conditions such as appendicitis, complications of abdominal hernias, and obstructed labour can be fatal if not treated by a surgical team, and on a global scale, the financial consequences of citizens dying from potentially treatable surgical conditions translates into upwards of $12.3 trillion of lost economic productivity to LMICs between 2015–2030 if no action is taken to improve access to surgical care .\n\nGlobal interventions for improved child health and survival include the promotion of breastfeeding, zinc supplementation, vitamin A fortification, salt iodization, hygiene interventions such as hand-washing, vaccinations, and treatments of severe acute malnutrition. The Global Health Council suggests a list of 32 treatments and health interventions that could potentially save several million lives each year.\n\nMany populations face an \"outcome gap\", which refers to the gap between members of a population who have access to medical treatment versus those who do not. Countries facing outcome gaps lack sustainable infrastructure. In Guatemala, a subset of the public sector, the \"Programa de Accessibilidad a los Medicamentos\" (\"Program for Access to Medicines\"), had the lowest average availability (25%) compared to the private sector (35%). In the private sector, highest- and lowest-priced medicines were 22.7 and 10.7 times more expensive than international reference prices respectively. Treatments were generally unaffordable, costing as much as 15 days wages for a course of the antibiotic ceftriaxone. The public sector in Pakistan, while having access to medicines at a lower price than international reference prices, has a chronic shortage of and lack of access to basic medicines.\n\nJournalist Laurie Garrett argues that the field of global health is not plagued by a lack of funds, but that more funds do not always translate into positive outcomes. The problem lies in the way these funds are allocated, as they are often disproportionately allocated to alleviating a single disease.\n\nIn its 2006 World Health Report, the WHO estimated a shortage of almost 4.3 million doctors, midwives, nurses, and support workers worldwide, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nData from WHO and the World Bank indicate that scaling up infrastructure to enable access to surgical care in regions which it is currently limited or non-existent is, in fact, a low-cost measure relative to the significant morbidity and mortality caused by lack of surgical treatment . For example, it is estimated that 90% of maternal deaths could be prevented with basic surgical care . From a cost perspective, studies at district hospitals have demonstrated that provision of basic surgical care can be on par with vaccination programs, which counters a common perception of surgical care as a financially prohibitive endeavor in LMICs . Furthermore, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery estimates $12.3 trillion in economic productivity will be lost in developing countries by 2030 if access to surgical care is not improved . Bellwether procedures are considered a minimum level of care that first-level hospitals should be able to provide in order to capture the most basic emergency surgical care. These include 3 main surgical procedures; laparotomy (for abdominal emergencies), caesarean section, and treatment of an open fracture . This would require anaesthetists, obstetricians, surgeons, nurses, and facilities with operating theatres and pre- and post-surgical care capabilities.\n\nThe Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) is \"a multilateral, multi-sector effort that includes 60 participating countries and numerous private and public international organizations focused on building up worldwide health security capabilities toward meeting such threats\" as the spread of infectious disease. On March 26–28, 2018, the GHSA held a high-level meeting in Tbilisi, Georgia, on biosurveillance of infectious disease threats, \"which include such modern-day examples as HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 influenza, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis — any emerging or reemerging disease that threatens human health and global economic stability.\" This event brought together GHSA partner countries, contributing countries of Real-Time Surveillance Action Package, and international partner organizations supporting the strengthening of capacities to detect infectious disease threats within the Real-Time Surveillance Action Package and other cross-cutting packages. Georgia is the lead country for the Real-Time Surveillance Action Package.\n\nGHSA works through four main mechanisms of member action, action packages, task forces and international cooperation. In 2015, the Steering Group of the GHSA agreed upon the implementation of their commitments through 11 Action Packages. Action Packages are a commitment by member countries and their partners to work collaboratively towards development and implementation of International Health Regulations (IHR). Action packages are based on GHSA’s aim to strengthen national and international capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. Each action package consists of five-year targets, measures of progress, desired impacts, country commitments, and list of baseline assessments. The Joint External Evaluation (JEE) process, derived as part of the IHR Monitoring and Evaluation Framework is an assessment of a country’s capacity for responding to public health threats. So far, G7 partners and EU have made a collective commitment to assist 76 countries whereas the US committed to helping 32 countries to achieve GHSA targets for IHR implementation. In September 2014, a pilot tool was developed to measure progress of the Action Packages and applied in countries (Georgia, Peru, Uganda, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine) that volunteered to participate in an external assessment.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118250", "title": "Biblia pauperum", "text": "Biblia pauperum\n\nThe Biblia pauperum (\"Paupers' Bible\") was a tradition of picture Bibles beginning probably with Ansgar, and a common printed block-book in the later Middle Ages to visualize the typological correspondences between the Old and New Testaments. Unlike a simple \"illustrated Bible\", where the pictures are subordinated to the text, these Bibles placed the illustration in the centre, with only a brief text or sometimes no text at all. Words spoken by the figures in the miniatures could be written on scrolls coming out of their mouths. To this extent one might see parallels with modern cartoon strips.\n\nThe tradition is a further simplification of the \"Bible moralisée\" tradition, which was similar but with more text. Like these, the \"Biblia pauperum\" was usually in the local vernacular language, rather than Latin.\n\nOriginally Paupers' Bibles took the form of colourful hand-painted illuminated manuscripts on vellum, though in the fifteenth century printed examples with woodcuts took over. The \"Biblia pauperum\" was among the commonest works put out in block-book form, mainly in the Netherlands and Germany, where both text and images were done entirely in a single woodcut for each page. The first of many editions printed using movable type was printed in German, in Bamberg in about 1462 by Albrecht Pfister; there were about eighteen incunabulum editions. A \"Biblia pauperum\" was not intended to be bought by the poor — some manuscripts were opulent and very expensive, although the block-book versions were far cheaper, and probably affordable by parish priests. The simpler versions were however probably used by the clergy as a teaching aid for those who could not read, which included most of the population. The name \"Biblia pauperum\" was applied by German scholars in the 1930s.\n\nEach group of images in the \"Biblia pauperum\" is dedicated to one event from the Gospels, which is accompanied by two slightly smaller pictures of Old Testament events which prefigure the central one, according to belief of medieval theologians in typology; these parallels are explained in two blocks of text, and each of the three Biblical scenes is introduced with a Latin verse. Four Prophets hold scrolls with quotations from their Books, which prefigure the same event from the Gospels. \nFor example, the scene of Longinus spearing Jesus as he hangs on the Cross is accompanied by God bringing forth Eve from the side of Adam, and Moses striking the rock so that water flowed forth, together with prophecies of Zechariah, the Psalms, the Lamentations and Amos.\n\nThe earliest manuscripts of the \"Biblia Pauperum\" were made in Bavaria and Austria in the 14th century, they have 34–36 groups. Later versions add more scenes, and one of the most detailed versions is the 50-part blockbook version, produced in the Netherlands in 1480–1495\n\nThe \"Biblia\" was rivalled by the \"Speculum Humanae Salvationis\" (\"Mirror of Human Salvation\"), another very popular compilation of typological pairings, with rather more text than the \"Biblia\". The iconographical programmes of these books are shared with many other forms of medieval art, including stained glass windows and carvings of biblical subjects. Since books are more portable than these, they may well have been important in transmitting new developments in depicting the subjects. Most subjects, such as the Annunciation to the Shepherds, can be seen in a very similar form at different dates, in different media and different countries.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2118256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118256", "title": "Bart Gets an Elephant", "text": "Bart Gets an Elephant\n\n\"Bart Gets an Elephant\" is the seventeenth episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> fifth season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 31, 1994. In this episode, Bart wins a radio contest and is awarded a full-grown African elephant that he names Stampy. After Stampy wrecks the Simpsons' house and eats all the food, Homer decides to sell Stampy to an ivory dealer. Bart runs away with Stampy to save his pet, but the family finds the two at a museum exhibit, where Homer sinks into a tar pit. Homer is saved by Stampy, and so gives the elephant away to an animal refuge instead.\n\nThe episode was written by John Swartzwelder, and directed by Jim Reardon. It introduced the fictional elephant Stampy, and marks the first appearance of the recurring character Cletus Spuckler. The episode features cultural references to the songs \"Sixteen Tons\" and \"Do-Re-Mi\", and the La Brea Tar Pits cluster of tar pits located in Hancock Park in Los Angeles, California. \n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 10.7, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.\n\nBart wins a KBBL radio contest after the station's DJs, Bill and Marty, call him and he correctly recites the station's slogan. They give Bart the choice of two prizes: $10,000 in cash or a full-grown African elephant. Bart chooses the elephant. Bill and Marty are dumbfounded because the elephant is only a gag prize they never thought anyone would choose. They offer Bart several other prizes, all of which he refuses. Word spreads throughout town about Bill and Marty's refusal to give Bart an elephant, leading to a flood of angry mail and letter bombs from the station's listeners. Bill and Marty's boss gives them an ultimatum: either find an elephant for Bart or lose their jobs. They find an elephant and leave it on the Simpons' front lawn.\n\nBart names his new elephant Stampy and ties him to a post in the backyard. Lisa complains that keeping an elephant as a pet is cruel, while Homer worries that Stampy is too expensive to keep. To offset Stampy's food costs, Bart and Homer exhibit him by charging customers to pet and ride him, but they fail to cover his budget. Homer and Marge decide that Stampy must go.\n\nA representative of a game reserve tells the Simpsons its acres of open land similar to African savanna would be an ideal habitat for the elephant, but Homer rejects this idea because it includes no financial profit. Mr. Blackheart, a wildlife poacher, offers to buy Stampy. Homer eagerly agrees, but Bart and Lisa disapprove because Blackheart openly admits to being an ivory dealer.\n\nJust as Homer and Blackheart reach a deal, Bart and Stampy run off and wreak havoc throughout Springfield. The family finds them at the Springfield Tar Pits, where Homer gets stuck in a tar pit. After pulling Barney Gumble from the pit, Stampy frees Homer, who reluctantly agrees to donate the elephant to the wildlife reserve.\n\nBart says goodbye to Stampy, who bullies the other elephants at the reserve for no apparent reason. The head of the reserve explains to Marge and Lisa that sometimes animals, like humans, are just big jerks. Homer forces his body against the man's back, mimicking the tactic Stampy uses to herd the other elephants.\n\nThe episode was written by John Swartzwelder, and directed by Jim Reardon. \"The Simpsons\"' creator Matt Groening thought it was a \"quintessential\" Swartzwelder episode, and executive producer/show runner David Mirkin said it was a \"fantastic job by one of the most prolific writers of the show\". The most important thing to Mirkin while making the episode was to make sure that the elephant would be a \"bastard\" and behave rudely, unlike other animals on the show. For example, instead of putting people on his back, Stampy would put them in his mouth. Mirkin said the elephant \"never quite bonds because it's a very cantankerous animal, a concept that was very important to this episode\". Stampy has since been used several times in jokes later on in the series. For example, Stampy made an appearance in the season nine episode \"Miracle on Evergreen Terrace\" in one of Bart's dreams, and in the season fourteen episode \"Large Marge\", where he is used by Bart in a stunt to help Krusty the Clown win back his popularity. Stampy appeared briefly in \"The Simpsons Movie\", where he tries to break down the giant glass dome lowered over Springfield. The episode also introduces the character Cletus Spuckler. He is shown as one of the \"slack-jawed yokels\" gawking at Stampy in the Simpson family's backyard. Cletus is not named in the episode, so the staff simply referred to him as the Slack-Jawed Yokel.\n\nThe Springfield Tar Pits are inspired by the La Brea Tar Pits located in Hancock Park in Los Angeles, California. The museum in the background of the scene where Homer sinks into one of the tar pits resembles the George C. Page Museum of the La Brea Discoveries. When Stampy runs away, he passes the Republican National Convention, with people cheering, and then he passes the Democratic National Convention, with people booing. This is a reference to the fact that an elephant is the symbol of the Republican Party. Homer uses Mr. Cleanser, a parody of the detergent brand Mr. Clean, to clean the basement. As Bart cleans, he accidentally scrubs the paint off an \"American Gothic\" painting hanging on the wall. Under the paint is a message signed by the painter, Grant Wood, reading: \"If you can read this, you scrubbed too hard.\"\n\nThe scene in which Stampy's eye is seen through a window of the Simpson family's house is similar to a scene with a Tyrannosaurus rex in the film \"Jurassic Park\". While cleaning the house, Marge turns on the radio and the song \"Sixteen Tons\" by Merle Travis is heard. The scene in which Homer crashes his car into a deer statue at the Springfield Tar Pits parodies the lyrics to the \"Sound of Music\" song \"Do-Re-Mi\" as Homer shouts: \"D'oh!\" followed by Lisa: \"A deer!\" and Marge: \"A female deer!\" Homer reads an old \"TV Guide\" in which the synopsis of an episode of \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\" reads \"Gomer upsets Sgt. Carter\", a possible synopsis for every episode of that series. He also imagines the episode with a thought of both Carter and Pyle standing next to each other. Carter yells, \"Pyle!\" and Pyle responds, \"Shazam!\". As Stampy wreaks havoc throughout Springfield, Patty and Selma are sucked up by a tornado and fly through the air in rocking chairs, similar to a scene in the 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Bart Gets an Elephant\" finished forty-second in the ratings for the week of March 28 to April 20, 1994, with a Nielsen rating of 10.7, equivalent to 10 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.\n\nThe episode won an Environmental Media Award in the Best Television Episodic Comedy category, which has been awarded every year since 1991 to the best television episode with an environmental message. The episode has also received a Genesis Award in the Best Television Comedy Series category. The Genesis Awards are given out annually by the Humane Society of the United States \"to the news and entertainment media for shining that spotlight into the darkest corners of animal abuse and exploitation.\"\n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: \"Another favourite. It's hard to explain the special appeal of this episode. Perhaps it's because Homer is so exceptionally dumb. Or perhaps because it contains the 'D'oh!' 'A deer!' 'A female deer!' gag.\" This gag was also praised by BBC News's Mark Milne, who said: \"[It] just cracks me up every time. Brilliant!\" \n\nDVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought the fifth season included \"plenty of programs with potentially cheesy concepts\", such as \"Deep Space Homer\" and \"Bart Gets an Elephant\". However, he thought the episode managed to \"easily overcome its possible flaws\" to turn into a \"very fine program\". Homer's line \"Marge, I agree with you in theory. In theory, communism works — \"In theory\"\" was Jacobson's favorite of the episode. \n\nPatrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A, and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave it a score of 4 out of 5.\n\n"}
{"id": "2118263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118263", "title": "Bay (chancellor)", "text": "Bay (chancellor)\n\nBay, also called Ramesse Khamenteru, (died 1192 BC) was an important Asiatic official in ancient Egypt, who rose to prominence and high office under Seti II Userkheperure Setepenre and later became an influential powerbroker in the closing stages of the 19th Dynasty. He was generally identified with \"Irsu\" (alt. Arsu, Iarsu, Yarsu) mentioned in the Great Harris Papyrus, although no contemporary source connects Bay with Irsu.\n\nBay's importance is emphasized by the fact that he was given permission, possibly by Seti II but more probably by Siptah, to construct his own tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings (KV13). His tomb was clearly constructed as part of a triad of tombs, including that of the Pharaoh Siptah and Queen Twosret. This was an unprecedented privilege, the likes of which were rarely accorded to a commoner, let alone a foreigner (though previous exceptions, such as that of Yuya, have occurred). It is possible that Bay was accorded this tomb because he was a relation of Siptah's mother, a Canaanite concubine of Seti II, or perhaps even of Amenmesse. His tomb was later usurped under the Twentieth Dynasty by prince Mentuherkhepshef, a son of Ramesses IX.\n\nBay is called a Syrian (Hurru = Hurrian or Harran-born) Asiatic. While his precise background is unknown except for his Syrian origins, Bay is first attested as scribe and butler, an important position in Egypt, during the reign of Seti II. However, Bay probably entered Egypt's civil administration earlier under a previous pharaoh–either Merneptah, Seti II's father, or Ramesses II.\n\nIndeed, Bay's first official position may have been that of a priest in the temple at Heliopolis, where a small statue of him has been found. By the time of the death of Seti II, Bay had risen to the post of Chancellor and played the role of \"kingmaker.\" Bay's status at Siptah's court was so great that on several of the young king's monuments, \"the chancellor is shown in scenes with the pharaoh on the same scale as the latter, the earliest occasion in which a commoner was depicted in such a manner.\" Furthermore, Bay explicitly claims, in several inscriptions with reference to Siptah, that it was he who established the king \"on the throne of his father\" without providing further details on how this came about. Bay was also included in the cult of the mortuary temple of Siptah in Year 3 of the latter's reign. During the same period the tomb of Queen Twosret, KV14 was also started, and built as part of a threesome with those of Siptah and Bay. The tombs of Bay and Twosret (2nd building phase) are smaller copies of the royal tomb.\n\nImages of Bay exist showing him standing behind the throne of Pharaoh Siptah, an unusual position for a commoner, and also opposite Twosret on the doorjamb of the Amada temple where he faces the queen. Tablets unearthed by excavators at Ras Shamra prove Ugarit was communicating with Bay of Egypt (RS 86.2230), who described himself the \"head of the bodyguard of the Great King, the King of Egypt\".\n\nLike Siptah's and Twosret's, Bay's name was later removed from the tomb, probably by the new Pharaohs of the 20th Dynasty, who did not recognise his legitimacy, nor that of any of the late 19th Dynasty monarchs who ruled after Seti II, including Siptah and Amenmesse. If tradition is to be believed, Bay enjoyed an evil reputation: he reportedly seduced Twosret, who then gave him full control over Egypt's treasury. Some even speculate that during this period Bay and Twosret were lovers. But this speculation is unlikely, since Bay died in Siptah's Year 5, at least two years before Twosret assumed the throne.\n\nWhile it was previously assumed that Bay served under Twosret and may even have attempted to usurp the throne on her demise, a newly discovered ostracon published by Pierre Grandet in BIFAO 100 titled \"L'execution du chancelier Bay O. IFAO 1864,\" (BIFAO 100 [2000]: pp. 339–345), reveals otherwise. According to the information in Ostraca IFAO 1864, which is composed of two inscribed potsherd fragments that were reunited in February 2000, Bay was executed on or shortly before Year 5, III Shemu day 27 of Siptah, on the king's orders. The recto of the ostracon is essentially a public announcement to the workmen of Deir el-Medina and reads thus:\n\nAlthough the king is not named, the dating of the ostracon under Siptah is certain and accords well with Bay's last known public appearance in Regnal Year 4 of this king. It is not known what event or palace conspiracy brought about Bay's sudden downfall. However, the prime beneficiary of his death appears to be Twosret, who assumed the throne without opposition a year later when Siptah died. The intention of the public announcement was to tell the Deir el-Medina workmen to abandon all work on completing Bay's tomb. Bay, hence, was not buried in the dignified style which he sought and instead met a traitor's fate. After his fall, his tomb was subsequently usurped in the 20th Dynasty for prince Mentuherkhepshef, a son of Rameses IX. \n\nPapyrus Harris I portrays his tenure in office as a time when Egypt was in chaos and temple offerings were denied to the gods. After the death of Twosret, Egypt seems to have fallen into anarchy, with many temples being looted by Asiatic followers of Bay.\n\nTwosret's successor Setnakhte's Elephantine stele records how he expelled these Asiatic rebels who, on their flight from Egypt, abandoned much of the gold, silver and copper which they had stolen from Egypt, and with which they had intended to hire reinforcements among the Asiatics. His pacification of Egypt is also referred to in the Great Harris Papyrus.\n\nIt is possible that memories of these events were distortedly reported in the third century BCE by the Hellenistic Egyptian historian and priest, Manetho, who claimed that a certain Egyptian priest from Heliopolis called Osarseph, led leprous Asiatics out of Egypt, in an Exodus later reportedly that of Moses. C. Hauret suggests that Irsu/Bay's career also has a resemblance to that of the Biblical Joseph (Yusuf). Thomas Romer writes that some think that \"Osarseph is a polemical name for Akhenaton; others think of a combination of Joseph and Osiris.\"\n\n"}

Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Church of Scientology. Hubbard called his theories on learning and education \"study technology.\" Applied Scholastics runs the \"Hollywood Education and Literacy Project\" (HELP), the World Literacy Crusade, \"Education Alive\", and the \"Literacy, Education and Abilities Program\" (LEAP).\n\nApplied Scholastics' declared mission is: \"to promote and develop programs of effective education for educators, business trainers, tutors, parents, children and people in all walks of life who need improved study skills to enhance their scholastic, business and personal activities.\"\n\nApplied Scholastics is sponsored by the Church of Scientology.\n\nStudy Tech is a teaching methodology developed by L. Ron Hubbard.\n\nHubbard's theories on education describe three \"barriers to learning\". The first is the absence of mass, pertaining to the lack of a physical object relating to a concept. The second is a steep study \"gradient\", meaning a necessary previous step was skipped to master a skill. The third is the \"misunderstood word\", which necessitates looking up unclear words in the dictionary.\n\nStudents are taught that \"misunderstood words\" are a major cause of confusion and misunderstanding. They are taught to use dictionaries extensively. Emphasis is also put on making sure children are taught at a \"gradient\", so that a subject's crucial elementary concepts come before more difficult concepts. \"Mass\" is described as a measure of mental tangibility that students ascribe to a subject, so that students have a picture in their mind of the thing they are learning about.\n\nApplied Scholastics licenses Study Tech to a number of schools throughout the world. In return, these schools pay 4% of their gross income to Applied Scholastics.\n\nIn 1992, Applied Materials settled a lawsuit for an estimated $600,000. The lawsuit claimed that the three former employees who filed the lawsuit had been driven out of the company because they had complained about the seminars Applied Scholastics had been contracted to teach there. Applied Scholastics said regarding the case, \"In ten years of business, we've never had anything come up like this.\" \n\nIn 1998, the group submitted five of its books for approval as supplemental classroom texts to the California Department of Education. The review board found no religious content to object to, although they did object to the lack of portrayals of disabled persons and people of color. The Southern California American Civil Liberties Union, however, objected on the basis that the books used many of the terms and concepts that the Church of Scientology uses elsewhere in its Study Tech.\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Applied Scholastics convinced the principal of Prescott Middle School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to implement a program of Study Tech. Critics worried that the move was \"an insidious plan ultimately aimed at promoting Scientology.\" However, Prescott's principal and two education experts claimed that they \"saw [no] hidden Scientology agenda or proselytizing in the text.\" The school's principal felt that the program was worthwhile. In October 2005, St. Louis Public Schools superintendent Creg Williams discovered the group's Scientology connections and immediately advised area principals to cease working with Applied Scholastics.

A star of vaudeville and musical theater, he became best known for performing the popular baseball poem \"Casey at the Bat\".\n\nHopper was born William D'Wolf Hopper in New York City, the son of John Hopper (born 1815) and Rosalie D'Wolf (born 1827). His father was a wealthy Quaker lawyer and his mother came from a noted Colonial family. His paternal grandfather Isaac Hopper was a Philadelphia Quaker, and conductor of the Philadelphia station of the Underground Railroad. Though his parents intended that he become a lawyer, Hopper did not enjoy that profession. Hopper was called Willie as a child, and then Will or Wolfie, but when he set out on an acting career he chose his more distinguished middle name as his stage name. It was modified to \"DeWolf\" because of the frequency that it was mispronounced \"Dwolf\".\n\nHe made his stage debut in New Haven, Connecticut, October 2, 1878. Originally, he wanted to be a serious actor, but at 6' 5\" (196 cm) and 230 pounds, he was too large for most dramatic roles. He had a loud bass singing voice, however, and made his mark in musicals, beginning in Harrigan and Hart's company. He achieved the status of leading man in \"The Black Hussar\" (1885) and appeared in the hit \"Erminie\" in 1887. Eventually, he starred in more than thirty Broadway musicals, including \"Castles in the Air\" (1890), \"Wang\" (1891), \"Panjandrum\" (1893), and John Philip Sousa's \"El Capitan\" (1896). The role that he remembered with greatest pleasure was Old Bill in \"The Better 'Ole\" (1919). \n\nKnown for his comic talents, Hopper popularized many comic songs and appeared in a number of Gilbert and Sullivan comic \"patter\" roles from 1911 to 1915, including \"The Mikado\", \"Patience\", and \"H.M.S. Pinafore\".\n\nA lifelong baseball enthusiast and New York Giants fan, he first performed Ernest Thayer's then-unknown poem \"Casey at the Bat\" to the Giants and Chicago Cubs the day his friend, Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Tim Keefe had his record 19-game winning streak stopped, August 14, 1888. Hopper helped make the comic poem famous and was often called upon to give his colorful, melodramatic recitation, which he did about 10,000 times in his booming voice, reciting it during performances and as part of curtain calls, and on radio. He released a recorded version on phonograph record in 1906, and recited the poem in a short film made in the Phonofilm sound-on-film process in 1923.\n\nIt was in \"The Black Hussar\" that Hopper first incorporated a baseball theme that drew notice in the sporting press. To accompany a song with a baseball stanza, \"Mr. Hopper enacts the pitcher, Mr. [Digby] Bell, with a bird cage on his head and boxing gloves on his hands, plays catcher, while Mme. [Mathilde] Cottrelly handles a diminutive bat as striker and endeavors to make a 'home run.'\"\n\nIn 1889, Hopper became founding president of the Actors' Amateur Athletic Association of America. Back in 1886, besides organizing a regular ball team among actors, he played in a benefit game for a demented playwright. The following year, he helped organize an actor's benefit for a sick young actress. In the first inning, someone presented him with an eight-inch sunflower.\n\nAlso in 1889, Bell, Hopper and fellow McCaull Comic Opera Company actor Jefferson De Angelis were doing the following skit for their third encore in \"Boccaccio.\" Bell returns \"with a bat in his hand, followed by DeWolf Hopper and De Angelis. The latter has a ball, and as Hopper takes the bat in hand and Bell acts as catcher the former goes through the customary contortion act in pitching, and as Hopper hits the ball he runs off the stage, as if running the bases, and presently returns chased by De Angelis, who passes the ball to Bell as catcher just as Hopper makes a big slide for home base. The slider tumbles Bell, and when he rises from the somersault all three yell out to the audience for judgment [a ruling], and go off kicking like Anson and [New York captain Buck] Ewing. It is a rich gag and takes immediately\", the \"Brooklyn Eagle\" said.\n\nThat year, Bell called Hopper \"the biggest baseball crank that ever lived. Physically, of course, he is a corker, but when I say big I mean big morally and intellectually. Why, he goes up to the baseball [Polo] grounds at One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street after the matinees on Saturday, and he travels this six miles simply to see, perhaps, the two final innings, and any one can imagine the rapidity with which he must scrape off the makeup and get into his street clothes in order to secure even this much. But he says the Garrison finishes are worth it, and he is perfectly right. Hopper always was a baseball crank, long before the public knew anything about it.\"\n\nBald from childhood (he had alopecia), Hopper wore wigs both on and offstage. In later years, a reaction to harsh medicines that he took for throat problems gave his skin a bluish tinge. Regardless, his powerful voice and great sense of humor seemed an attraction to women all his life. With an insatiable appetite for young actresses, he left a long trail of six wives and countless mistresses in his wake, he became known by the nickname \"The Husband of His Country.\"\n\nHopper also appeared in several silent motion pictures, two examples being \"Don Quixote\" (1915) and \"Casey at the Bat\" (1916). Hopper also appeared in a few short sound films, including one in 1923 when he actually recites \"Casey at the Bat\" in an experimental sound film produced by Lee De Forest's Phonofilm process.Hopper was a part of the Triangle Film Corporation, which he described as “the first great flourish” of a “prattling, infant industry”.\n\nHe made a Broadway appearance in \"White Lilacs\" (1928). He then did \"Radio City Music Hall Inaugural\" (1932), and played Dr. Gustave Ziska in \"The Monster\" (1933). At the time of his death, he was in Kansas City, Missouri, making a radio appearance. His funeral was at the Little Church Around the Corner, in New York City\n\nHis autobiography, \"Once a Clown, Always a Clown\", written with the assistance of Wesley W. Stout, was published in 1927.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Almost all of Reaney's poems, stories, and plays are articulations of where he grew up. At a young age he was interested in theatre, and created a puppet show for children while in his early teens.\n\nReaney studied English at University College, University of Toronto, receiving his M.A. in 1949. The same year he also received the Governor General's Award, the first of three, at the age of 23, for his first book of poetry, \"Red Heart.\".\n\nReaney married fellow poet Colleen Thibaudeau on December 29, 1951 in St. Thomas. He has three children: two sons, James Stewart (born 1952) and John Andrew (1954), born in Toronto, Ontario and a daughter, Susan Alice Elizabeth, born 1959 in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nAfter teaching English at the University of Manitoba from 1949 until 1956, Reaney returned to the University of Toronto to complete a doctorate awarded in 1958; Northrop Frye was his thesis supervisor. Also in 1958 Reaney released a second book of poetry, \"A Suit of Nettles\", which again won the Governor-General's Award.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s Reaney also wrote and published short stories. While not published in book form until years later, his stories were influential in establishing the style of writing later called Southern Ontario Gothic (later made world-famous by Alice Munro).\n\nIn 1960 Reaney began teaching in the University of Western Ontario's English Department. Also in 1960 he put out the first issue of his journal,\"Alphabet: A Semi-Annual Devoted to the Iconography of the Imagination,\" which he would edit until 1971. This journal published a variety of poets, including Jay Macpherson, Margaret Atwood, Al Purdy, Milton Acorn, and bp Nichol, and work from such artists as Tony Urquhart, and Greg Curnoe.\n\nFor Reaney, the new decade also coincided with \"a shift of emphasis from poetry to the public and communal form of drama,\" starting with \"The Killdeer\". \"Though he had been interested in drama since childhood, he was encouraged by a friend to write a piece for the University of Toronto's Alumnae Theatre and the work he created, \"The Killdeer\", launched his drama career (and won a prize in the Dominion Drama Festival).\" In 1962 he won the Governor General's Award for Poetry or Drama a third time, this time for both his newest book of poetry, \"Twelve Letters to a Small Town,\" and his first book of plays, \"The Killdeer and Other Plays\".\n\nReaney \"followed up \"The Killdeer\" with \"Colours in the Dark\" (1969), \"Listen to the Wind\" (1972), \"Masks of Childhood\" (1972) and plays for children.\" His play \"Colours in the Dark\" was produced at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in 1967.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1975 Reaney wrote the trilogy The Donnellys, which the \"Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia\" calls \"one of the nation's most important dramas.\" The three plays debuted at Toronto's Tarragon Theatre, directed by Keith Turnbull. \"The St. Nicholas Hotel,\" Part II of the trilogy, won the Chalmers Award. The Donnellys toured nationally in 1975, from Halifax to Vancouver with the NDWT Theatre Company, again with Turnbull directing.\n\nAs well, Reaney coauthored several operas with musician John Beckwith, including \"Night-Blooming Cereus\" (1960), \"The Shivaree\" (1982), and \"Crazy To Kill\" (1988).\n\nOther notable Reaney plays include \"Names and Nicknames\", which premiered at the Manitoba Theatre Centre in 1963, directed by John Hirsch and Robert Sherrin); and \"Alice Through the Looking Glass\", which played at the Stratford Festival in 1994, 1995 and in 2014.\n\nReaney also enjoyed painting and drawing and his art works, from the 1940s to 1990s, were put on exhibit at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario in 2008.\n\nReaney died on June 11, 2008, in London, Ontario.\n\nReaney's complex symbolic and poetic regional drama defies categorizing. Reaney's plays are a combination of symbol, metaphor, chant, poetic incantation, choral speaking, improvisation, miming, and child play. Reaney depends on the concept that we, the audience, are all \"children of an older growth\" and his audience have responded to this expectation. The symbolic quest as the children search for truth and end in reconciliation with the adult world are the basis of Reaney's plays. Critics have called him a colonial, a rationalist and internationalist, a rabid nationalist, a symbolist, and a poet with the myth of coherence who is yet able to say something in an age of the random.\n\nOf his poetry, \"The Canadian Encyclopedia\" says: \"Reaney's poetry, collected in \"Poems\" (1972), has earned him a reputation as an erudite poet at once deriving structures from metaphor, mythology, and a cosmopolitan literary tradition while deeply rooted in a regional sense of place.\"\n\nReaney's fiction of the 1940s and 1950s (collected in the 1994 book \"The Box Social and Other Stories,\" was \"influential in establishing the style of writing that has since become known as ‘Southern Ontario Gothic’. Margaret Atwood has remarked that ‘without \"The Bully\", my fiction would have followed other paths'... Playing sophisticated games by switching voice, he achieves a kind of ‘magic realism’, often through the distorted perspective and sense of disproportion of his child narrators.\"\n\nJames Reaney won a number of awards in his lifetime:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1956, one of the Special Assistance Plan high schools designated by the Ministry of Education in recognition of its heritage and excellence in education.\n\nRiver Valley High School was founded as Singapore Chinese Middle School. It was the first Chinese middle school set up by the government and occupied the premises of Seng Poh Primary School. It was later renamed Queenstown Government Chinese Middle School and subsequently River Valley Government Chinese Middle School when it was moved to Strathmore Avenue.\n\nRiver Valley High School admitted its first batch of English-taught pupils in 1979 when it was selected as one of the NINE pioneering Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools in that same year. It moved from its River Valley campus to a new campus at West Coast in December 1986. Due to the smaller school campus at the West Coast site, the school became a double-session school. It reverted to a single-session school in 1993 after new blocks were constructed. It was among the first six schools in Singapore to become autonomous in 1994. For its achievements in its CCAs, it was also one of the first schools to receive all three available Sustained Achievement Awards when it was first offered by the Ministry of Education in 2001.\n\nIn 2006, River Valley High School was officially designated a 6-Year Integrated Programme school. Under the programme, students follow a six-year Integrated Programme curriculum which allows students to sit for the GCE 'A' Level examinations at year 6 without taking the GCE 'O' Level examinations. The final batch of GCE 'O' Level students graduated from River Valley High School in 2007.\n\nAt a press release held by the Ministry of Education on 21 September 2018, it was revealed that River Valley would be participating in the JAE as of 2019, and will accept GCE O-Level students from other secondary schools. The first batch of JAE students were admitted into the school in February 2019.\n\nRiver Valley is known for its inclusive and conservative culture, a common trait shared among Special Assistance Plan schools with a strong Chinese background.\n\nRiver Valley High School retains its school song in mandarin Chinese. The song, with close links to the school motto, represents the heritage of the school and the aspirations of the founders' hopes in educating the next generation. Students are reminded to bring glory to the school through excellence in both academics and behaviour. The school song is written in literary Chinese, giving it a poetic touch. The lyrics are written in verses of four characters, a parallel to Chinese idioms, with the exception of the last two verses.\n\nRiver Valley High School's crest is made of the school's initials \"RV\". The colour of red symbolises radiance, progress and vitality, the colour of blue symbolises steadfastness, graciousness and serenity, while white symbolises purity and receptiveness to innovation.\n\nRiver Valley High's Year 1-3 school uniform is unique to River Valley High School, one of the most outstanding and identifiable uniform designs in Singapore. Male students wear an all white shirt with white shorts, while female students wear a white pinafore. Both the shirt and pinafore bear the school initials, \"RV\", in red and blue at the front left chest level.\n\nThe Year 4-6 ( secondary 4 - junior college) uniform is a plain white shirt or blouse complemented with blue skirt or white pants. A collar pin is worn on the left collar, which bear the school crest.\n\nRiver Valley High is known for its popularity in composing and singing campus songs and Xinyao, a genre of songs originated in the 1980s that is unique to Singapore. River Valley High have its collection of songs written by its former and present students. This associates River Valley High with institutions that have strong cultural background and influence in Singapore's music scene, such as Hwa Chong Institution and Jurong Junior College. River Valley High students are also seen taking an active role in the continuation of Singapore's song writing heritage.\n\nRiver Valley High School's campus is the newest among all SAP and Integrated Programme institutions, officially declared open in 2010 and costs over $70 million to build. Located off Boon Lay Avenue, the 7.64-hectare campus comprises facilities that supports the educational needs for the six-year Integrated Programme, and strongly encapsulate a strong cultured environment.\n\nThe River Valley High Student Hostel is located adjacent to the school campus, consisting of two 12-storey buildings and one 15-storey building (Halls 1, 2 & 3 respectively). It provides accommodation for up to 500 boarders and 25 teacher mentors. The building features a dining hall and is supported with internet access. However, this hostel closed in late 2016. As of 2019, the hostel is now privately operated by 85soho, a hostel operator.\n\nFrom 2006, River Valley High School offers the 6-year Integrated Programme, allowing its students to take the GCE 'A' level examinations at the end their sixth year (JC2) in the school. It also offers the Bicultural Studies Programme (Chinese), joining Dunman High School, Hwa Chong Institution and Nanyang Girls' High School. The programmed is aimed to nurture independent and passionate individuals who uphold strong moral character, effectively bilingual in English and Chinese language, and have a global perspective that allows them to face challenges in the changing world.\n\nThe Construct, Integrate, Differentiate (CID) Programme is an integrated curriculum under the RVIP that focuses on knowledge construction with differentiation features to cater to the diverse talents and interests of the students.\n\nThe CID Programme provides students with opportunities to construct their own learning by integrating knowledge from various disciplines, using modes of inquiry appropriate to the subject or project that they are working on. In the CID Programme, students spend their freed time constructively on inquiry-based and research-oriented project work. Teamwork is emphasised through collaborative and co-operative learning.\n\nThe programme is designed with the objectives of providing students with the opportunities to engage in individualised research in an area of strength. All students will complete coursework in Research Methods, an in depth learning of the quantitative and qualitative methods appropriate to individualised researches. With the completion of the Research Methods coursework, students can opt to undertake research in one of the following programmes: the Junior Scientists Programme (scientific research work), Innovators Programme (engineering and design), Mathematics Talent Programme and the Explorers Programme (humanities). Students can also seek attachments at the local or overseas institutes for the CID Extended Learning. Opportunities for further learning are also provided through overseas exchange programmes.\n\nCHAMPS is an acronym for \"Character Education; Health Education; Active Citizenry; Moral Philosophy; Physical Education; & Student Leadership Development\". It is a unique and integrated Pupil Development Programme designed by RV. It focuses on the development of values and character. It seeks to develop life skills, and the social, national, cultural and moral consciousness of the students. ASK will be infused in the teaching and learning of PDP. Besides the core modules in CHAMPS, students would complete at least 1 PDP elective module each year.\n\nRiver Valley High School, being a Special Assistance Plan school, has a very strong Chinese environment. Chinese language, culture and history are often emphasised in the School. It is compulsory for all Year 1 to 4 students to take up Higher Chinese as a subject, Chinese culture lessons are also mandatory in lower secondary and students can opt for Chinese Literature in upper secondary.\n\nRiver Valley is one of the few institutions in Singapore to offer the Bi-cultural Studies Programme. The 4-year programme, which is offered at Year 3 level, aims to nurture a bi-cultural orientation amongst a core group of students. River Valley High's BSP included camps, enrichment electives which acts as complements to the ministry's programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He worked as a surgeon for several years, but gradually changed his profession after his written works on rural sports became successful. He relocated from the country to London in 1852. The following year he published his first important book, \"The Greyhound\" (3rd ed. 1875), a collection of papers originally contributed to \"Bell's Life.\"\n\nIn 1856, his \"Manual of British Rural Sports\" was published, along with many additions. During the same year, he joined the staff of \"The Field,\" and became its editor at the close of 1857. Among his numerous books published under the name of \"Stonehenge\" are:\n\n\nHe was editor of \"The Field,\" a magazine whose target audience was the upper class of English society, and those who loved to shoot, fish, and hunt. It was never a pure hunting magazine, but was always concerned with social status; its influence led to the creation of the Kennel Club. Walsh instituted a series of trials of guns, rifles, and sporting gunpowders. These extended over many years, and contributed to the development of sporting firearms. His influence upon all branches of sport was stimulating and beneficial.\n\nJohn Henry Walsh, son of Benjamin Walsh, was born in Hackney, London, on 21 October 1810. He was educated at a private school. In 1832, he passed as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and became a fellow of the college, by examination, in 1844. For some time, he was surgeon at the Ophthalmic Institution and lectured on surgery and descriptive anatomy at the Aldersgate School of Medicine. For several years he practiced medicine at Worcester, but returned to London in 1852.\n\nHe loved sports; he rode well to hounds, kept greyhounds and entered them at coursing meetings, and trained his own pointers and setters. He also trained hawks. He became adept in the management of dogs, and few veterinary practitioners could compare with him in the treatment of dogs' diseases. He was also fond of shooting, and lost a part of his left hand as a result of his gun bursting.\n\nIn 1853, under the pseudonym of \"Stonehenge,\" he released his first work, entitled \"The Greyhound: On the art of breeding, rearing, and training greyhounds for public running, and their diseases and treatment\" (3rd ed. 1875). This treatise was based on articles he had written in \"Bell's Life\", and it remains the standard textbook on the subject. Three years later, in 1856, his articles appeared in \"Manual of British Rural Sports\" which deals with the whole cycle of sports and the scientific breeding of horses. Sixteen editions of this work were published up to 1886, with later editions containing articles on special subjects furnished by other writers. In 1856, he originated the \"Coursing Calendar\" and conducted it through fifty half-yearly volumes.\n\nAround 1856, he was connected with \"The Field\" and at the end of 1857 accepted its editorship. He wrote several books; \"The Shot-Gun and Sporting Rifle, and the Dogs, Ponies, Ferrets, &c., used with them in Shooting and Trapping\" and \"The Dog in Health and Disease\" (4th ed. 1887) in 1859; \"The Horse in the Stable and in the Field\" in 1861 (13th ed. 1890); and \"The Dogs of the British Islands\" in 1867 (3rd ed. 1886). In the last two books, he also had the assistance of other writers. In 1882–4 the \"Modern Sportsman's Gun and Rifle\" was published with its first volume devoted to shotguns, while volume two dealt with rifles.\n\nHe was a very ambitious person. His activity in conducting \"The Field,\" with the aid of many able coadjutors, was remarkable. He soon instituted the first \"Field\" trial of guns and rifles, in April 1858 in the Ashburnham grounds at Chelsea, adjacent to the famous Cremorne Gardens. This trial wound up the controversy about the rival merits of breech-loaders and muzzle-loaders, but before the final decision, two other trials were held, one at the old Hornsey Wood Tavern in July 1859, and the third at the Lillie Arms, Brompton, in 1866.\n\nIn 1875, the value of the choke-bore system received further elucidation in another trial at the All England Croquet Club grounds at Wimbledon, of which Walsh was an active promoter. The trial extended over six weeks, with the entire proceedings being carried out under the editor's personal supervision.\n\nAgain, in 1878, he endeavoured to make clear the respective merits of Schultze and black powder. Besides conducting the actual competition, he carried out numerous experiments himself. One of the consequences was that light pressure with Schultze was found to produce better shooting than tight ramming, while tight wads to prevent the escape of gas and the general system known as the 'Field' loading also resulted. Other experiments led to his invention of the 'Field' force gauge, which gave more reliable results than the paper pads previously in use.\n\nIn 1879, another gun trial was carried out to determine the merits of 12-bores, 16-bores, and 20-bores.\n\nIn 1883, he instituted the rifle trial at Putney to demonstrate the accuracy of shooting of Express rifles at a target, and to ascertain, by measurement, the height of the trajectories of weapons differing in bore and in the charge used. Subsequently, Walsh organised trials to ascertain the cause of so many breakages in guns, the testing of powders by the lead cylinder method, the various effects of nitro compounds, and the strain on the barrels of small bores. His comments on proof powder in \"The Field\", where he stated that the powder used in testing gun-barrels was fifty per cent below the proof required, led to an action, the Birmingham Proof-house Guardians v. Walsh On technical grounds, a verdict was decided against Walsh with damages of forty shillings (\"The Times\", 3 July - 10 August 1885). As soon as the trial was over, he approached the Guardians with proposals for providing security for sportsmen, and ultimately succeeded in obtaining some useful changes.\n\nWalsh was one of the founders of the National Coursing Club and of the All England Lawn Tennis Club. He was heavily involved with the early dog shows and field trials, and was on the committee of the Kennel Club. He was a good chess player, and served on the committees of several clubs.\n\nWalsh died at 43 Montserrat Road, Putney, Surrey, on 12 February 1888, aged 77, and was buried on 16 February in Putney Vale Cemetery at Putney Common. He married three times : first, in August 1833, to Margaret, daughter of Thomas Stevenson of Claines, Worcestershire, who died nine months later; next, in 1835, to Susan Emily, daughter of Dr. Malden of Worcester, who died eight months later; and, finally, in 1852, to Louisa, the eldest of the Rev. William Parker, who survived her husband. He left two daughters.\n\nIn addition to the books already mentioned, Walsh wrote:\n\nWalsh edited:\n\nWith William Harcourt Ranking Walsh, edited:\n\nWith John George Wood Walsh, edited:\n\n"}

Among the honours Nørholm has received are the Gaudeamus International Composers Award in 1964, the Carl Nielsen Prize in 1971 and a knighthood in 1981.\n\nInitially, Nørholm's music was very much in the tradition of Carl Nielsen, as exemplified by his first symphony (1956-8). In the 1960s, however, Nørholm began to explore the possibilities of serialism and graphic scores, having been deeply impressed by his experiences of the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Pierre Boulez, and others at the ISCM in Cologne.\nLater still his music took on a more economical approach, often characterised by the term 'new simplicity'.\n\nCompositions by Nørholm include the opera \"The Young Park\" (1969–70), \"Symphony No. 3\" (1973), sonatas for accordion (1967) and guitar (1976), \"Idylles d'Apocalypse\" for organ and orchestra (1980), \"Symphony No. 5 'The Elements' \"(1980), \"Immanence\" for solo flute (1983), \"Aspects of Sand and Simplicity\" for string orchestra (1987), a symphonic fantasy \"Hearing Andersen\" (1987), and the choral work \"Sjaelfuld Sommer\" (1997).

{"id": "2118305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118305", "title": "CorningWare", "text": "CorningWare\n\nCorning Ware, also written CorningWare, was originally a brand name for a unique glass-ceramic (Pyroceram) cookware resistant to thermal shock. It was first introduced in 1958 by Corning Glass Works (later Corning Inc.) in the United States. The brand was later spun off with the sale of the Corning Consumer Products Company subsidiary (now known as Corelle Brands of Rosemont, Illinois). Glass-ceramic based Corning Ware can be taken from the refrigerator or freezer and used directly on the stovetop, in an oven or microwave, under a broiler, for table / serving use, and when ready for cleaning put directly into a dishwasher. CorningWare is sold worldwide, and it is popular in North America, Asia, and Australia.\n\nIn 1953 S. Donald Stookey of the Corning Research and Development Division discovered Pyroceram, a white glass-ceramic material capable of withstanding a thermal shock (sudden temperature change) of up to 450 K (840 °F), by accident.\n\nHe was working with photosensitive glass and placed a piece into a furnace planning on heating it to 600 degrees Fahrenheit. When he checked on his sample the furnace was at 900 degrees and the glass had turned milky white. He reached into the furnace with tongs to discard the sample and it slipped and hit the floor without shattering.\n\nThe material was used in the ballistic missile program as a heat-resistant material for nose cones.\n\nProduction of the original Pyroceram based version of Corning Ware ceased in 2000 and the brand was relaunched as a line of stoneware based bakeware in 2001.\n\nCorelle Brand's (then known as \"World Kitchen\") 2001 annual report indicated that the stove top and dinnerware product lines were halted at the end of the century \"as part of a program designed to reduce costs through the elimination of under-utilized capacity, unprofitable product lines, and increased utilization of the remaining facilities.\" Facilities in Charleroi, Pennsylvania and Clinton, Illinois were closed.\n\nIn December 2008, the stovetop line of CorningWare was reintroduced by Corelle Brands. The cookware is manufactured by Keraglass/Eurokera (a subsidiary of Corning also specialised in vitroceramics for cooktop panels and equipment for laboratories) in Bagneaux-sur-Loing, France. This is one of the only factories in the world still manufacturing Pyroceram-based cookware. At the time it restarted the production of CorningWare, Keraglass/Eurokera was able to abandon the use of arsenic in the manufacture of their products, thanks to the modern technology of their newly built oven.\n\nCorning Ware's range/oven-to-table service first featured the blue 'Cornflower' pattern decoration, designed by Joseph Baum, an artist at the Charles Brunelle Advertising Agency in Hartford, Connecticut. It became the trademark of Corning consumer products for three decades. Following the 'Cornflower' pattern, many additional patterns were offered by Corning over the years.\n\nCorelle Brand's Pyroceram based Corning Ware is popular in the Asia–Pacific region. Additional patterns have been created specifically for this market, including Bliss, Blue Elegance, Cool Pansies, Country Rose, Dainty Flora, Dandy Blossoms, Elegant City, European Herbs, Herb Country, Lilyville, Lush, Petite Trio, Plum, Salad Seasons and Warm Pansies among others.\n\nThe lids of CorningWare and Pyroflam (Europe) are typically made of Pyrex. Though some early lids were made of Pyroceram, most subsequent lids have been made of tempered borosilicate or soda-lime glass. Unlike the cookware, these lids have a lower tolerance for thermal shock and cannot be used over or under direct heat.\n\nMore than 750 million pieces of Corning Ware's range/oven-to-table service have been manufactured since its inception. A partial product list includes: browning skillets, cake pans, casserole dishes, coffee pots (\"drip\"), dinner service (\"Centura by Corning\"), Dutch ovens, frying pans, grab-it bowls, loaf pans, percolators, pie plates, ramekins, restaurant ware (\"Pyroceram\"), roasters, sauce pans, skillets, souffle dishes, and teapots.\n\nCorelle Brands sells similar looking products under the CorningWare brand name (including a copy of \"French White\") that are made of glazed stoneware, rather than Pyroceram. The packaging for these newer CorningWare branded cookware products say specifically that they are not for stovetop use.\n\nVisions, a brand of transparent stove top cookware originally created by Corning France and still being produced today, is made of a transparent version of Pyroceram, called Calexium in some regions of the world. It features thermal traits similar to Corning Ware plus improved resistance to staining and the detrimental effects of acids and detergents.\n\nCorelle, a brand name for break-resistant glass dishware also originally created by Corning Glass Works, has offered matching designs to many Corning Ware patterns. Care must be made to distinguish between Corning Ware cookware and tableware marketed under the Corelle or Pyrex brand names, as the thermal properties of each product are quite different.\n\nArc International, Europe, sells equivalent cookware to Corning Ware under the name Arcoflam and, in the United States, through Princess House as Nouveau cookware with a slightly different design. Since 2009, Arcoflam and Nouveau have been manufactured in the same French factory as Corning Ware.\n\n"}

The last of his siblings, Octavia Walsh, was also, secretly, a poet. He entered Wadham College, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner in 1678. Leaving the university without a degree, he settled in his native county, \n\nWalsh was returned MP for Worcestershire in 1698, 1701 and 1702. In 1705 he sat for Richmond, Yorkshire. On the accession of Queen Anne he was made \"gentleman of the horse,\" a post which he held till his death, noted by Narcissus Luttrell on 18 March 1708.\n\nWalsh wrote a \"Dialogue concerning Women, being a Defence of the Sex\" (1691), addressed to \"Eugenia\"; and \"Letters and Poems, Amorous and Gallant\" (preface dated 1692, printed in \"Jonson's Miscellany\", 1716, and separately, 1736); love lyrics designed, says the author, to impart to the world \"the faithful image of an amorous heart.\". \n\nIt is not as a poet, however, but as the friend and correspondent of Alexander Pope that Walsh is remembered. Pope's \"Pastorals\" were submitted for his criticism by Wycherley in 1705, and Walsh then entered on a direct correspondence with the young poet. The letters are printed in Pope's \"Works\" (ed. Elwin and Courthope, vi. 49-60). Pope, who visited him at Abberley in 1707, set great value upon his opinion. \"Mr Walsh used to tell me,\" he says, \"that there was one way left of excelling; for though we had several great poets, we never had any one great poet that was correct, and he desired me to make that my study and my aim.\"\n\nThe excessive eulogy accorded both by Dryden and Pope to Walsh must be accounted for partly on the ground of personal friendship. The life of Virgil prefixed to Dryden's translation, and a \"Preface to the Pastorals with a short defence of Virgil, against some of the reflections of Monsieur Fontenella,\" both ascribed at one time to Walsh, were the work of Dr Knightly Chetwood (1650–1720). In 1704 Walsh collaborated with Sir John Vanbrugh and William Congreve in \"Monsieur de Pourceaugnac, or Squire Trelooby\", an adaptation of Molière's farce. Walsh's \"Poems\" are included in Anderson's and other collections of the British poets.\n\nSee \"The Lives of the Poets\", vol. iii. pp. 151 et seq., published 1753 as by Theophilus Cibber.\n\n"}

In the early years of the 20th century he served as Admiral of Patrols, commanding four flotillas of destroyers.\n\nDe Robeck commanded the allied naval force in the Dardanelles during the First World War. His campaign to force the straits, launched on 18 March 1915, was nearly successful, as the Turkish land-based artillery almost ran out of ammunition. However, mines laid in the straits led to the loss of three allied battleships. The subsequent ground campaign, like the naval campaign, was ultimately a failure and the ground troops had to be taken off the Gallipoli peninsula by de Robeck on the night of 8 January 1916. He went on to become Commander of the 3rd Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet and then Commander of the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet.\n\nAfter the war de Robeck became Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet and British High Commissioner to Turkey, and then Commander-in-Chief of the Atlantic Fleet. \n\nBorn the son of John Henry Edward Fock, 4th Baron de Robeck (a member of the Swedish nobility) and Zoë Sophia Charlotte Fock (née Burton), de Robeck joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in the training ship HMS \"Britannia\" on 15 July 1875. Promoted to midshipman on 27 July 1878, he joined the frigate in the Channel Squadron in July 1878 and then transferred to the training ship at Portsmouth in April 1882. Promoted to sub-lieutenant on 27 July 1882, he joined the gunnery school HMS \"Excellent\" in August 1882 before transferring to the gunboat on the China Station in August 1883. Promoted to lieutenant on 30 September 1885, he transferred to the battleship , flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, China in early 1886, to the brig in March 1887 and to the battleship , flagship of the Channel Squadron, in November 1887. He joined the staff of the training ship HMS \"Britannia\" in September 1888 and then transferred to the armoured cruiser , flagship of the China Station, in January 1891 before returning to the staff of the training ship HMS \"Britannia\" in August 1893.\n\nDe Robeck became gunnery officer in the corvette on the North America and West Indies Station in November 1895 and, following promotion to commander on 22 June 1897, became commanding officer of the destroyer at Chatham in July 1897, next the destroyer at Chatham in July 1898 and then the destroyer at Chatham in June 1899. After that he became executive officer in the cruiser in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1900.\n\nPromoted to captain on 1 January 1902, de Robeck was in July 1902 appointed in command of , depot ship at Portsmouth. He temporarily commissioned for short while during summer 1902, waiting for \"Warrior\" to be ready from an extensive refit. He became commanding officer of the armoured cruiser in the Mediterranean Fleet in August 1906, commanding officer of the battleship in the Channel Fleet in January 1908 and then inspecting officer of boys' training establishments in January 1910. Promoted to rear admiral on 1 December 1911, he became Admiral of Patrols, commanding four flotillas of destroyers, in April 1912.\n\nDe Robeck received command of the 9th Cruiser Squadron, with his flag in the protected cruiser , in August 1914, just after the start of the First World War. In this capacity he captured the German liners SS \"Schlesien\" and SS \"Graecia\".\n\nDe Robeck became second-in-command, under Admiral Sackville Carden, of the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron (the Allied naval forces in the Dardanelles), with his flag in the battleship , in February 1915. Carden received instructions to force the straits and then push on to Constantinople: he made an unsuccessful attempt to do this on 19 February 1915, but then fell seriously ill, leaving de Robeck to take command, with his flag in the battleship , in March 1915. De Robeck's campaign to force the straits, launched on 18 March 1915, nearly succeeded, as the Turkish land-based artillery almost ran out of ammunition: however, mines laid in the straits led to the loss of three Allied battleships. De Robeck, seeing no sense in losing more ships, then abandoned the whole naval operation. On 25 April 1915 the Royal Navy landed General Ian Hamilton's troops at the tip of the Gallipoli peninsula (Cape Helles) and at Anzac Cove, on the peninsula's western coast. The Ottoman forces and their German advisors had had two months warning from the first serious navy attack to prepare ground defences before the follow-up ground landing could be mounted, and they used the time effectively. The initial landings failed to achieve their objectives, and the Allies made a further unsuccessful attempt, in August 1915, at Suvla Bay. In the wake of this setback, Commodore Roger Keyes, de Robeck's Chief of Staff, argued for a third attempt to force the straits, but de Robeck recommended against it and the Admiralty accepted de Robeck's advice. The ground campaign, like the naval campaign, ultimately proved a failure, and although de Robeck was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath for his service in the Gallipoli Campaign on 1 January 1916, he had to organize the evacuation of Hamilton's troops off the Gallipoli peninsula on the night of 8 January 1916.\n\nDe Robeck went on to become Commander of the 3rd Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet, with his flag in the battleship , in May 1916; and Commander of the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet, with his flag in the battleship , in November 1916. He was promoted to vice admiral on 17 May 1917.\n\nAppointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1919, de Robeck became Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet and British High Commissioner to Turkey, with his flag in the battleship , in July 1919. He was created a baronet on 29 December 1919 and promoted to full admiral on 24 March 1920. Advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1921, he went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet in August 1922 before retiring in August 1924. \n\nIn retirement de Robeck became President of the Marylebone Cricket Club. Appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in November 1925, he was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 24 November 1925 and died at his home in London on 20 January 1928.\n\nIn 1922 he married Hilda, Lady Lockhart, widow of Sir Simon Macdonald Lockhart, 5th Baronet; they had no children.\n\n\n\n"}

These two words are related and go back to the Proto-Indo-European \"*médʰu\" (honey). Known in Eastern Europe since pagan times, it remained popular well into the 19th century (unlike in Western Europe, where by the Middle Ages mead had already been mostly replaced by wine and beer).\n\nWild honey farming was one of the first Slavic trades. They discovered that honey could be fermented, and the first fermented honeys appeared as a luxury product in Europe, where it was imported in huge quantities.\n\nFermentation occurs naturally over 15 to 50 years, originally rendering the product very expensive and only accessible to the nobility. However, Slavs found that fermentation occurred much faster when the honey mixture was heated, enabling Medovukha to become a folk drink in the territory of Rus'.\n\nIn the 14th century, the invention of a distilling tank and a process of distillation made it possible to create a prototype of the modern Medovukha. In the 17th century, the increasing popularity of vodka eclipsed the former fame of Medovukha.\n\n"}
{"id": "2118334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118334", "title": "List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters", "text": "List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters\n\nThis is a list of \"The Belgariad\" and \"The Malloreon\" characters. \"The Belgariad\" and \"The Malloreon\" are two parts of a fantasy epic written by David Eddings. Note: All of the statements (deceased, married) are written from the current information by the end of the series.\n\nNote: These characters are the main protagonists to the story. There are many other minor and supporting protagonists, including some royalty.\n\n\nNote: This section includes the three disciples of Torak, along with other major antagonists in the story.\n\n\n\n\nAldur is the eldest of the seven gods. He is worshipped by no race of people, but has a number of disciples: Belgarath, Beldin, the twins Belkira and Beltira, Belzedar (formerly), Polgara, Belmakor (deceased), Belsambar (deceased), Belgarion, Beldurnik (formerly Durnik, admitted in the Malloreon), and Poledra, as mentioned in \"Polgara the Sorceress\". His totem animal is the owl; this is never mentioned in the primary story (though the owl is commonly associated with his disciples), but appears in the Rivan Codex.\n\nAfter Aldur and his brothers create the world in which the stories are set, Aldur refuses to take a seventh part of mankind to worship him, leaving the ancestors of the Ulgos, Dals, Morindim, Karands, and Melcenes Godless. Instead, he takes disciples, prepending \"Bel-\" to their names. Polgara and Poledra are also counted among the Disciples, as is shown by the prefix \"Pol-\" being the feminine of \"Bel-\". At one stage, Aldur also names Polgara as his \"Beloved daughter\", although this may be connected to the title \"Ancient and Beloved\", given to her father Belgarath. The Disciples all at some time take residence at the Vale of Aldur, where each disciple has its own tower, apart from Poledra and Polgara who inhabit a cottage at the far edge of the Vale. Aldur also possesses a tower, wherein furniture may appear or disappear as he wishes.\n\nThe \"Belgariad\"'s MacGuffin is the Orb of Aldur: a sentient stone polished into a roughly spherical shape by Aldur, and seized by Torak.\n\nBelar is the youngest of the seven gods. He is the god of the Alorns, and his totem animal is the bear.\nBelar is closely allied with Aldur in the War of Destinies, and is also described as being close to Mara. When he maintains a physical presence in the world, he appears as a young man, and is known for drinking and feasting with Alorn warriors, and for lavishing his attentions on young women. In \"Guardians of the West\", he is identified as an incessant speaker.\n\nChaldan is the god of the Arends, and his totem animal is the bull.\nChaldan emphasises pride and militaristic tradition as virtues; therefore sermons at funerals are not concerned with the comforting of the bereaved, but with vengeance. Chaldan does not play a significant role in the stories.\n\nIssa is the god of the Nyissans. His totem animal is the serpent.\nThough physically present in the world, Issa spends long periods sleeping, disguised as a large statue behind the royal throne of Nyssa. When all the gods save Torak left the world, he gave the governance of his people to his high priestess, Salmissra, but neglected to prolong her life. A long line of subsequent Salmissras ruled in her stead, each chosen by their resemblance to the original, and also given the ability to summon a physical incarnation of Issa. The last Salmissra is eventually changed into a snake and made immortal by Polgara.\n\nMara is the god of the Marags. His totem animal, never mentioned except in the Rivan Codex, is the bat.\nKnown as the \"weeping god\" for his long mourning after the Tolnedran massacre of the Marags, Mara is surrounded by the ghosts of his dead people, so that few could enter his domain without being driven mad. The exception is the monastery at Mar Terrin, where Tolnedran monks attempt to comfort the spirits of the Marags. He is found always howling in the ruins of Mar Amon, his capital, until the restoration of the Marags.\n\nNedra is the second-oldest of the seven gods. He is the god of the Tolnedrans, and his totem animal is the lion.\nNedra instills the values of thrift and wealth into his people: as a result, Tolnedrans are often associated with avarice, materialism, and deceit. Their culture thrives on enterprise and commerce.\n\nTorak is the third of the seven Gods. His people are the Angaraks, and his is the only totem animal counted among the monstrous races (perhaps due to Torak's vain attempts to enhance the creature): the dragon. The left side of his body, most notably his face and hand, are maimed by the Orb of Aldur; and his left eye (called 'the Eye that Was Not') perpetually burns with the Orb's blue fire. Beldin therefore referred to Torak as \"Old burnt-face\"; this reference hints at Beldin's true identity when he is in disguise, as he is the only one to use it.\n\nAlone among his brothers, Torak served the Dark in the War of the Gods, caused by himself; and when almost defeated, he forced the Orb to create a new ocean, with his worshippers on one side and their enemies on the other. As the head of a theocratic military culture, Torak drove the Angaraks to dominate their neighbors the Dals, Karands, and Melcenes, and conquered much of the western continent. Like many fantasy villains, Torak almost achieves domination of the world, only to be vanquished in a great battle, and re-appears, after a long absence, in the central story, wherein he is slain by Belgarion.\n\nAfter Belgarion slays Torak, the Orb restores his face.\n\nEriond, originally called Errand, was a spirit originally meant to be the God of the Angaraks until a 'Great Accident' (the misplaced explosion of a star) caused Torak to exist. Eriond thereafter persisted in spirit until Zedar began his search for the Orb of Aldur. Errand then appeared as a child to Zedar, who used him to seize the Orb. The name \"Errand\" is not derived from \"Eriond\", but is simply the only word that he, in his child form, was able to remember for many years. In this form, Errand was raised as Polgara's ward; and in his adulthood, accompanied Belgarion to the 'High Places of Korim', to achieve his own apotheosis. It is stated, though not seen in the stories, that upon apotheosis, he would eventually replace all the other Gods. He takes no totem animal, but is frequently accompanied by an unusual stallion (a stillborn colt revived by Belgarion), simply named Horse.\n\nUL is the mysterious god of the Ulgos, who originally were a tribe of people without a god of their own. He is not counted among the traditional seven, and theologians of their religions are ambivalent in their treatment of him. At the end of The Belgariad, it is revealed that he is the father of the seven gods, and omnipresent as well. He is also god of the monstrous beasts rejected by his sons. UL is served by a High Priest, who is always called Gorim. The successive Gorims, although not immortal, live as long as UL requires them to serve. The successor of the Gorim is identified as having violet eyes. Poledra also served UL for many years, and so may be considered his disciple as much as Aldur's.\nIn the War of Destinies, he is generally seen on the side of Light, often working closely with Aldur. Due to his appearance as one in \"The Seeress of Kell\", his totem may be an albatross. David Eddings mentions, in the Rivan Codex, that the spelling of UL in capital letters was a typographical error permitted to stand.\n\n\n\nThese are characters in the Belgariad and the Malloreon that influence the story, but do not fit into any of the other categories.\n\nThe Prophecy of Light is the positive main driving force of the protagonists, six of gods, and Eriond. Often called the \"dry voice\" in Garion's mind, to whom (and occasionally through whom to others) it offered guidance.\n\nCyradis is the Seer chosen to appoint Light or Dark as the dominant moral force of the story's world in the final meeting between the rival prophesies. She first appears to Errand at the Vale of Aldur; later to the other protagonists at Rheon; and is shown as a slight girl with dark blonde hair and a blindfold over her eyes. She is escorted by the mute Toth. During the final Choice, Polgara removes her blindfold, to assist her decision; and Cyradis chooses Eriond (Light) over Geran (Dark), but loses her second sight. She is married to Zakath at the end of the series.\n\nSenji is an Alchemist and Sorcerer whom Beldin, Belgarath, and Garion meet in Melcene during \"Sorceress of Darshiva\" after they followed Zandramas' trail there. He is identified as 'the Clubfoot' by Cyradis and is around 3900 years old. He leads the sorcerers to a museum where the Sardion once rested and gives Belgarath a copy of the Ashabine Oracles. His power is weaker than theirs because of lack of practice due to his focus on transmutation of metals through alchemy.\n\nAlorns are the people of Belar, that occupy the north-western part of the western continent. Divided into several nations to better protect the Orb of Aldur, but retaining strong military and economic ties.\n\nAngaraks are the people of Torak. In Mallorea, they are the dominant people in the northwest, and are common throughout the Empire as soldiers and administrators. In the west, they occupy the southern half of the continent, and the lands east of the Escarpment in the north. They are divided into distinct castes, as shown below:\n\nArends are the people of Chaldan, inhabiting Arendia on the western continent and the island of Perivor off Mallorea. The Arendish nobility emphasize pride, honor, and military prowess, while the serfs form the downtrodden masses, with little variation in their conditions across the country. For most of its history, Arendia was embroiled in civil wars among the three major duchies of Asturia, Mimbre, and Wacune.\n\nMarags are the people of Mara. They are generally thought to be extinct at the time of The Belgariad, after a genocidal war waged by the Tolnedrans. It is later revealed that Tolnedrans sold Marag survivors to Nyissan slavers who in turn sold them to the Murgos, and that some still lived in the slave pens under Rak Cthol.\n\nMost details about Maragor come from Belgarath the Sorcerer, wherein it is stated girls were born 8 to 9 times more often than boys. As a result, Marag women controlled society. The governing body was a group of nine elder women known as the \"Council of Matriarchs\". Marriage was relatively unknown, and sexual promiscuity was common. In general, a Marag male's role in society was reduced to athletic contests or military service.\n\nNyissans are the people of Issa. The state of Nyissa is situated on the swampy equatorial west coast of the western continent. The head of state is the high priestess Salmissra, who is chosen for physical resemblance to her long-dead namesake. Most Nyissan people shave off their hair, because the insects native to the swamps of Nyissa like to nest in it. The use of drugs and poisons is common in politics.\n\nSendars are a people of primarily Alorn and Arendish descent, located north of Arendia on the coast of the western continent. The land that is now Sendaria was once the Arendish Duchy of Erat, owned by Polgara the Sorceress. Tolnedran Emperor Ran Horb II worked successfully to establish the independent Kingdom of Sendaria, to prevent Arendia from becoming more influential than Tolnedra. Practicality and a strong work ethic are intrinsic to the Sendarian national identity, and a lot of food eaten in the west is grown in Sendaria. Sendars are unusual in that they elected their first king, Fundor the Magnificent, who was originally a rutabaga (and cabbage) farmer.\n\nTolnedrans are the people of Nedra, dwelling in the Empire of Tolnedra in the subtropical north of the western continent. Tolnedrans are known for their obsession with trade and money (which they are said to have invented). Tolnedra is ruled by one of the five major families: the , the , the , the , and the . The Belgariad and The Mallorean take place during the reign of Ran Borune XXIII and his successor Varana (later Ran Borune XXIV). The primary military force of Tolnedra are the numerous Legions: a heavy infantry similar to the Roman legionaries. They are also unusual in their complete rejection of, and disbelief in, the concepts of magic and sorcery, on the basis of principles.\n\nUlgos originally were Godless, but after years of pleading on the top of a mountain, their leader convinced the god UL to rule and protect them and the animals and beasts that the other gods did not. After UL renamed their leader Gorim, he returned to his people but only a minority of the group believed him. Angered by their flippant disregard for his years of dedication, the Gorim cursed the remaining so they would have no children, and he left with his followers. The Ulgos live in a city in an extensive cave system under the mountains of Ulgoland, where the forementioned beasts live. The Ulgos continually remember their godless state, and thus are ever thankful to UL and are extremely religious. They played a major role in the Battle of Vo Mimbre as they swept from the mountains onto Torak's forces and diminished their size dramatically. \n\nOther human races are descended from the Godless Ones: ethnicities chosen by no god (Aldur abstaining from selection) at the beginning of the human race. They are widely spread across both continents and have physical diversity comparable to the other races.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118335", "title": "Gregorio Peralta", "text": "Gregorio Peralta\n\nGregorio Manuel Peralta (May 8, 1935 – October 3, 2001), better known as Gregorio \"Goyo\" Peralta, was a top Argentine boxer. Peralta enjoyed success as both a light heavyweight and a heavyweight, one of a select group Latin American Heavyweights to attain world-class status. (John Ruiz has been the only Hispanic to be world Heavyweight champion in boxing history.) Greg Peralta was a popular performer during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.\n\nGregorio Peralta was born in San Juan. He later resided in the area of Rosario, in Santa Fe Province.\n\nOn April 5, 1958, he made his professional boxing debut, knocking out a rival (Rene Pereira) who had lost all fourteen of his bouts. Peralta's fourth-round knockout of Pereira was at the legendary Luna Park, in Buenos Aires.\n\nPeralta won his first five fights by knockout, then went the ten round distance for the first time on September 6 of that same year, against Jose Angel Manzur, whom he outpointed over ten rounds in Montevideo, Uruguay. His first fight abroad had already been held, when he beat Marcelo Farias by a second-round knockout 35 days before, also at Montevideo.\n\nOn October 22, he and Manzur had a rematch, with the two boxers drawing (tying) after ten more rounds.\n\nOn March 31, 1959, Peralta suffered his first loss as a professional, a ten-round decision defeat to then reigning South American light heavyweight champion Luis Ignacio in São Paulo, Brazil in a non-title bout. Peralta had one loss and two draws in his next three fights, but then he returned to winning, when he avenged his defeat against Ignacio by knocking him out in three rounds, August 23 in Brazil.\n\nAfter winning his next five fights, including four in Uruguay, Peralta faced Mauro Mina, in a widely expected light heavyweight bout between two South Americans. On June 15, 1960, Peralta was knocked out by Mina in eight rounds at Lima, Peru.\n\nPeralta then won twelve and drew one of his next thirteen bouts. Among those were a ten-round decision in a rubber match with Manzur, and a four-round disqualification win over Aurelio Diaz. Peralta was given his first chance at winning a belt when he fought Jose Giorgetti, on August 4, 1962, at Mar del Plata for the Argentine Heavyweight title. He won the national belt by outpointing Giorgetti over twelve rounds, and then won fifteen more bouts in a row, for a total of 24 victories and one draw in twenty-five bouts.\n\nThe biggest win of his career came during that streak, when he outpointed world light heavyweight champion Willie Pastrano over ten rounds at Miami, Florida on September 20, 1963 in a non-title bout. His first fight with Pastrano marked Peralta's United States debut as a professional boxer.\n\nPeralta's next fight, on November 15 of that year, was also his first bout at New York's Madison Square Garden. He beat future José Torres world championship challenger, Wayne Thornton, by a ten-round decision there. After two more wins, including another one over Thornton, Peralta was given a shot at Pastrano's world Light-Heavyweight title, on April 10, 1964 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Pastrano retained the championship with a sixth-round knockout in a fight that had different views from boxing magazines; while the general consensus is that Pastrano was actually winning the fight when it was stopped, \"Ring En Español\" actually claimed twenty years later that Peralta was hitting Pastrano and had him against the ropes when the referee intervened and raised Pastrano's arm as the fight's winner. The truth is a cut opened in the second Thornton fight re-opened during Peralta's challenge of Pastrano and the bout was, to some hastily, to others justifiably, halted.\n\nPeralta went on to win nine of his next ten fights, including a rematch victory over Mauro Mina, outpointed in ten rounds at Buenos Aires on September 19 of '64, before defending his Argentine Heavyweight title for the first time, and losing it, to Oscar Bonavena by a twelve-round decision on September 4, 1965 in Buenos Aires. They'd rematch four years later.\n\nPeralta then went undefeated over his next 32 bouts, building a record of twenty nine wins and three draws, with seventeen knockouts over that span. Among the highlights of those thirty two bouts were three ninth round disqualifications in a row (over Ron Marsh on March 11, 1968, and two over Felipe Pablo Marich, on April 5 and April 20 of that same year), a ten-round decision over Ramon Rocha on August 23, and a draw in a non-title rematch with Bonavena, held on August 8, 1969.\n\nAfter the Bonavena rematch, he would face George Foreman, in a fight that was nationally televised in the United States, on February 16, 1970, once again at the Madison Square Garden. His now fighting weight being around \n200 lbs, Peralta had left the light-heavyweight scene way back. \nForeman was the rising ex-Olympic star and Peralta then ranked 9th world contender was predicted to be George's biggest test to date. Foreman held an aura as an awesome \"knockout artist\" but Peralta doggedly went ten full rounds with the future two time world Heavyweight champion. He lost a unanimous decision to Foreman. But Peralta won the crowds admiration for a gutsy good performance. He used his boxing skill and mobility to show Foreman was open to fast well placed counters and tended to somewhat unravel in the later part of matches. It's thought Ali studied this among other Foreman matches in his preparation the legendary 'Rumble in the Jungle' victory.\n\nPeralta's next bout came when he beat future world Light Heavyweight title challenger Piero del Papa, by a fifth-round knockout on June 6 at Montevideo.\n\nHis next bout marked his European debut, when he defeated Herbert Wick, exactly sixteen days after the fight with del Papa, by a second-round knockout in Barcelona, Spain. Peralta had three consecutive bouts in Spain, winning each of by knockout.\n\nAfter two more wins, he faced Foreman again, at Oakland, California, this time with the NABF's vacant regional Heavyweight title on the line. Once again, Peralta fought ten rounds with Foreman, but he was knocked out in the tenth, on May 10, 1971. His two Foreman matches are fine achievements.\n\nPeralta then moved to Spain for a one year. With the exception of a victory over Gerhard Zech on December 3 over at Germany, Peralta fought nine of his next ten bouts in Spain. These included a ten-round win over perennial contender Jose Urtain on October 8, a win over Leroy Caldwell by a fourth-round knockout on February 2, 1972, and a ten-round decision loss to Bob Foster world Light Heavyweight title challenger Ray Anderson on June 9 of that same year.\n\nAfter the loss to Anderson, Peralta would move again, this time to Germany, and he won his next six bouts by knockout. A loss to top world title contender Ron Lyle, however, took place on May 12, 1973 at Denver, Colorado. Peralta lost to Lyle by a ten-round decision.\n\nPeralta won his next two bouts by knockout in Germany, and then in a rematch held Lyle to a ten-round draw in Frankfurt, Germany. Peralta aged 38 years retired for good after the match.\n\nGregorio Peralta had an admirable record. It contained 98 wins, 9 defeats and 9 draws as a professional boxer, with 60 knockout wins, which places him in the exclusive group of boxers that won fifty or more fights by knockout during their career.\n\nHe led a quiet life after retiring, dying on October 3, 2001.\n\n"}

He studied with the Jesuits in nearby Spoleto from 1704 to 1709, when he moved to Rome to study law. His father had died in 1705, so when his mother fell ill around 1710, he returned to Trevi to take care of his family's affairs, in which task he succeeded well enough that he was entrusted similar work on behalf of other local families. Over the next ten or twelve years he accompanied the bishop of Spoleto on his pastoral rounds, possibly serving as a reliable secretary versed in the affairs of Trevi whenever the bishop needed to visit the northern area of his large diocese. This experience deepened his interest in the history of his hometown and its dependencies. He started to consign the historical information he collected to a series of notebooks, and gradually formed them into what would become his \"Historia Universale dello stato temporale ed eclesiastico\" (sic) \"di Trevi\". In 1726 he was elected attorney for the comune of Trevi, and later became magistrate with the town council.\n\nHe was, however, suddenly afflicted with total blindness in 1747, which put an end to his efforts; in that same year, having been a lifelong bachelor, he decided to marry a noblewoman from Spoleto, who bore him three children, Giuseppe, Maria, and another who lived only a few days. His work, though well advanced, remained unpublished, in the state it had reached in 1745, until 1985, when thanks to Giuseppe Natalucci, a descendant, the sole manuscript was made available to another Trevi historian, Carlo Zenobi, who produced a careful edition.\n\nNatalucci's history of Trevi, though still essentially a draft, exhaustively documents the history of the Trevi area based on many hundreds of meticulously noted sources. It focuses primarily on land parcels and the families and church entities that controlled them, and provides a minute picture of rural Umbria in the Middle Ages through the first half of the 18th century. It is of particular value in that many of his sources — cartularies, cadastral documents, etc. — no longer exist, and Natalucci showed himself a true scholar in scrupulously sourcing his facts.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118359", "title": "Harlequin (comics)", "text": "Harlequin (comics)\n\nHarlequin is the name of four clown-themed DC Comics characters.\n\nThe original Harlequin was a foe of the Golden Age Green Lantern and later became his wife. The second Harlequin originally debuted as the Joker's Daughter and was a member of the Teen Titans. The third Harlequin was a member of the Injustice Unlimited supervillain team and battled Infinity, Inc. The fourth Harlequin has only appeared on a few occasions and is an enemy of Alan Scott.\n\nThe Molly Mayne version of the Harlequin first appeared in \"All-American Comics\" #89 and was created by Robert Kanigher and Irwin Hasen.\n\nThe Marcie Cooper version of the Harlequin first appeared in \"Infinity, Inc.\" #46 and was created by Roy Thomas.\n\nThe unidentified Harlequin first appeared in \"Green Lantern Corps Quarterly\" #5 and was created by Ron Marz and Jim Balent.\n\nThe Harlequin appears in \"All-New Batman: The Brave and the Bold\" #7 (July 2011).\n\nThe original Harlequin was Molly Mayne who appeared in stories alongside the Golden Age Green Lantern (Alan Scott).\n\nMayne developed a crush on Scott and, donning a colorful costume (which included harlequin glasses, a conical hat and a mandolin), started a life of crime to attract his attention. Her crimes tended to be harmless and mostly for show, although the two clashed on several occasions in the late 1940s.\n\nShe briefly joined the Injustice Society until she turned on them by aiding the Justice Society of America. She had a deep running altruistic streak, which occasionally led her to join forces with her enemy/would-be love interest. Despite being attracted to the Harlequin, Scott never entered into a relationship with her and she eventually gave up in despair. She made a deal with the government in which she went on intelligence missions in return for amnesty for her past crimes and then quietly retired. On one occasion, she assisted Green Lantern, Superman and Lois Lane in capturing another foe of her love, the Sportsmaster.\n\nYears later, after the death of his first wife Rose Canton, Alan Scott realized that he had loved Molly all this time and they got married. As the years passed a problem developed for the two; the Starheart (which gave Scott his powers) had reversed his aging processes, so he was physically a young man while Molly had since aged into an old woman. In despair over the rift this had caused between them, Molly sold her soul to the demon Neron in return for youth in \"Underworld Unleashed: Abyss - Hell's Sentinel #1\". Her body became that of a young woman (who had the power to create nightmares) but her soul remained in Hell. Scott fought his way through Hell to obtain it and, with the help of the young Green Lantern V (Kyle Rayner), returned it to the Harlequin's body. This resulted in re-aging Molly, but making her whole once again. Some time thereafter, Scott himself was returned to his true physical age, as well. Mayne and Scott remain happily married to this day.\n\nDuring the \"Brightest Day\" crossover event, Molly briefly appears when Alan's daughter Jenny arrives at the Scott home in search of her father's old lantern. Molly informs her stepdaughter that Alan had been depressed in recent weeks, as Jenny had not been to visit her family since her resurrection at the close of the \"Blackest Night\" crossover event. Later, a doppelganger of the younger, villainous Molly is created by Alan's ring after he goes insane and battles the Justice League. The doppelganger is briefly seen torturing Starman.\n\nDuela Dent is the second character to use the Harlequin name. The character was introduced in \"Batman Family\" #6 (July/August 1976). Originally appearing as a villain, she called herself the Joker's Daughter, and not only claimed to be the daughter of the Joker, but also of the Catwoman, the Scarecrow, the Riddler and the Penguin as well. In Pre-\"Crisis\" continuity, she later revealed her true father was Two-Face, joined the Teen Titans and renamed herself the Harlequin.\n\nDuela's age has been retconned many times during the course of her history. When introduced she was a teenage girl; however in later books, she was portrayed as a much older woman. Recently, however, she has been returned to a far younger age.\n\nIn current continuity, Duela continues to claim various supervillains as her parent. Freely alternating between heroic and villainous roles, Duela is considered a delusional former member of the original Teen Titans, but later becomes a member of the evil Titans East. She later betrays Titans East when offered membership with the current team.\n\nSoon after, Duela is killed by a rogue Monitor in issue #1 of \"Countdown\", following a failed kidnapping attempt on a celebrity and pursuit from Jason Todd. It is later revealed that she is a native of Earth-3 and the biological daughter of the Jokester and Three-Face (Evelyn Dent), that world's heroic equivalents of the Joker and Two-Face.\n\nAs a youth, Marcie Cooper was recruited by the Grandmaster to join the Manhunters. Her grandfather, Dan Richards (a.k.a. Manhunter), also encouraged her to join the group as he had years ago. The Manhunters gave her a job working at KGLX radio in Gotham City, alongside Molly Mayne-Scott, who was a former agent called the Harlequin. Marcie began dating Northwind and later Obsidian, both of Infinity, Inc., and infiltrated the superteam from within.\n\nWhen the Manhunters began to strike at Earth, Marcie stole Molly's illusion-casting spectacles, taking the identity of the Harlequin. She failed to recruit Obsidian to the Manhunters and tried to kill her grandfather after he betrayed the Manhunters. Dan Richards was later killed by the Manhunter, Mark Shaw.\n\nSingle-minded in her attempt to destroy Infinity, Inc., she joined Injustice Unlimited and masterminded the assassination of Skyman: it was on the wedding night of Hector Hall and Lyta Trevor; the Harlequin posed as Jade and used Solomon Grundy as her pawn in killing Skyman. She then took Grundy, gathered the Dummy and took the pair to meet with Artemis, the Icicle and Hazard. The plan to murder the Infinitors was told to all and put into action. Pat Dugan was used as bait to bring the heroes to Stellar Studios, but the battle went bad for the villains. When Solomon Grundy realized he had been manipulated by the Harlequin, he savagely beat her. Afterwards, she was given over to the authorities. (\"Infinity Inc.\" #51-53, 1988)\n\nThe Harlequin has not been heard from since (though Roy Thomas has stated that she was not killed).\n\nCooper did make a cameo appearance in Alan Scott's dream sequence in \"Underworld Unleashed: Abyss - Hell's Sentinel\" #1 (December 1995).\n\nSome readers have speculated that she may be the mysterious Harlequin introduced in \"Green Lantern Quarterly\" #5-6 (summer and fall 1993). This new Harlequin is shown standing next to the Golden Glider in \"Underworld Unleashed\" #1 (November 1995), whom some misinterpret as Marcie Cooper herself. Another piece of speculation entails Marcie Cooper having been the Marcy from \"Secret Origins\" (vol. 2) #20 (November 1987) and \"Batgirl Special\" #1 (1988). That last idea was tentatively acknowledged by \"Millennium Index\" #1 (1987).\n\nA mysterious new Harlequin debuted in \"Green Lantern Corps. Quarterly\" #5-6 and battled Alan Scott.\n\nAs a little girl, she discovered she had illusion-casting powers. She learned all about the first Green Lantern, Alan Scott, and how the first Harlequin became his lover. She knew it was her destiny to become the next Harlequin and to be with Green Lantern.\n\nShe created illusions of Icicle and Solomon Grundy for Alan Scott to battle and then revealed herself to him. During that encounter, Scott mysteriously regained his youth. Though at first he thought this an illusion, he later learned that the original consciousness of the Starheart had been reawakened and M'La had been tortured and slain.\nDuring her battles with Scott, she eventually attacked his wife, Molly Mayne-Scott (the first Harlequin). She created illusions of a decrepit version of Molly, while she flooded Scott's head with visions of them together (in space, as barbarians, as detectives and eventually as medieval warriors). Scott was able to break free when he unleashed his simmering rage against her and showed her a world where he ruled over Hell and she was his captive slave. She stopped the battle, fled shouting that he had ruined everything, and instantly disappeared into the air.\n\nShe returned and made an appearance in Alan's dream sequence in \"Underworld Unleashed: Abyss - Hell's Sentinel\" #1. She also appeared in Hell alongside the other villains summoned by Neron in \"Underworld Unleashed\" #1.\n\nDuring the \"Underworld Unleashed\" crossover event, a character named Fay Moffit became the third Spellbinder. She bears a striking resemblance (both physically and in terms of powers) to this mysterious Harlequin. Although very similar, they are two separate characters.\n\nThe primary tool of the Molly Mayne version of the Harlequin was her glasses. The glasses were later explained as a gift from the Manhunters as one of their agents. By using the glasses, she was able to project realistic three-dimensional holograms and fire energy blasts. In recent years, the glasses enabled an aged Molly to \"maintain\" the physical vitality of her youth's athleticism. Her secondary tool is a mandolin with an extending handle which she uses as a defensive weapon, especially against the Golden Age Green Lantern (due to his ring's weakness to its wooden construction).\n\nThe Marcie Cooper version of the Harlequin wears special glasses that allows her to hypnotize people and to create realistic illusions in the minds of the people around her. She can even project illusions over television. She also wields a mandolin with an extending handle that can be used as a weapon. A psychopathic killer, she is not afraid to do whatever it takes to destroy her opponents.\n\nThe unidentified Harlequin has illusion-casting powers similar to her predecessors. However, her illusions are much more intense and powerful than the illusions cast by Molly Mayne and Marcie Cooper, which were created from their glasses. When casting her illusions, if the victim has any doubt that the illusion is not real, they will feel the pain that her illusion is inflicting on them.\n\nA new Joker's Daughter appeared in the \"Kingdom Come\" miniseries and \"The Kingdom: Offspring\" #1. She is identified as both the Joker's Daughter and the Harlequin in annotations for the series and according to Alex Ross (both Cooper and the unknown Harlequin introduced in 1993 were apparently overlooked in the preparation of \"Kingdom Come\"). The card set calls her a riot girl, who is \"one of many to follow the Joker's chaotic style.\" She is not related to either Duela Dent or the Joker.\n\nIt has been stated that the \"Kingdom Come\" storyline is now Earth-22 in the DC Multiverse. Previously, it was called Earth-96 in the first Multiverse.\n\nIn \"Batman '66\", she is a amalgamation of the Harlequin and Harley Quinn designed more around the 60s television show (she is slightly taller and her hair is short; she also wears prominent slanted eyeglasses, a long red dress and red blouse, a large pearl necklace and fairly prominent earrings) and appears as Dr. Holly Quinn, PhD, a psychologist at Arkham Asylum, referred to as Arkham Institute for the Criminally Insane. She convinces Joker to cooperate with Batman and Robin in exchange for approving his comedy night proposal. Dr. Quinn is manipulated by Catwoman and Joker to perfect the Joker Wave — a hysteria-inducing transmitting dish used on Gotham. Quinn is devastated by her role in the plot and to atone for her mistake, Dr. Quinn reverses the device by submitting herself to its effects — freeing the people of Gotham, but sacrificing her sanity in the process. She escapes and becomes a supervillain named the Harlequin. She retains her considerable intelligence and psychological training, making her a difficult foe for the Dynamic Duo, but she is eventually captured when Batman and Robin disguise themselves as criminals (Batman in his regular alternate guise of Matches Malone) who beat up other bad guys who were auditioning to be Holly's henchmen.\n\nAn alternate version of the Harlequin appears in the first episode of the web series, \"\" (a companion to \"\"), voiced by Tara Strong. This version more closely resembles the \"New 52\" version of Harley Quinn. Upon kidnapping and mutilating several innocent people, she uses the corpses as various toys, dolls and mannequins. When Batman arrives, he fights and defeats her. She admits defeat, but ends up getting killed as Batman reveals his fangs and ends up biting her neck in order to drink her blood. According to Bruce Timm, he deliberately modeled this Harlequin after the \"New 52\" version of Harley Quinn and had her killed off as a means of displaying his distaste for Harley Quinn's redesign.\n\n\n\nMolly Mayne\n\nDuela Dent\n\nMarcie Cooper\n\nOthers\n"}

His father was a chandler in Naas, and his mother is said to have been an English protestant. He studied at Franciscan College of St. Anthony in Leuven, where he joined the Friars Minor, and acquired Jansenist sympathies.\n\nIn 1646 Walsh went to Kilkenny, then in the hands of the rebel \"confederate Catholics,\" and, in opposition to the papal nuncio Rinuccini, urged, and in 1649 helped to secure, peace with the viceroy Ormonde on behalf of King Charles I. Walsh was arrested by the militant Irish Confederate Catholic faction in 1646, along with other \"peace party\" advocates like Richard Bellings after the Treaty they had negotiated with Ormonde and the English Royalists was rejected in the Confederate General Assembly. Those opposed to the Treaty included militant Catholic clergy led by the Papal Nuncio Rinuccini) who wanted Roman Catholicism established as the state religion in Ireland and Irish lords, such as Owen Roe O'Neill, who wanted to recover the lands and power their families had lost after the Plantations of Ireland.\n\nWalsh was guardian of the Franciscan friary at Kilkenny from 1648 to 1650. He served as chaplain to Castlehaven’s army in Munster from 1650 to 1651. All Catholic clergy captured by the Cromwellians were executed and Walsh, in danger of death, fled Ireland, first to London, then Madrid, and Holland. He subsequently lived obscurely in London. In 1661 he was appointed accredited London agent by the few surviving Irish bishops.\n\nOn the restoration Walsh urged his patron, Ormonde, to support the Irish Roman Catholics as the natural friends of royalty against the Protestant sectaries, who had supported the Parliament during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Walsh endeavoured to mitigate their lot and efface the impression made by their successive rebellions by a loyal remonstrance to Charles II, boldly repudiating papal infallibility and interference in public affairs, and affirming undivided allegiance to the crown. For eight years he canvassed for signatures to this address, but in spite of considerable support, the strenuous opposition of the Jesuits and Dominicans deterred the clergy and nearly wrecked the scheme. (See also: Act of Settlement 1662 for Irish politics at the time). A General Chapter of the Franciscans held in Antwerp in 1664 protested Walsh's publications undermining the authority of the Minister General and of the Holy See.\n\nFrom 1669 until his death, Walsh lived in London, much respected for his honesty, loyalty and learning. Through the influence of Ormonde, he secured the seneschalship of Winchester (worth about £100 a year) from the bishop of that see. He and his supporters were declared renegades to be spurned by other friars by the Order's General Chapter of 1670 for having published without the permission of the Minister General of the Order, but he remained a devout adherent of the Catholic Church, although he maintained friendly relations with the Anglicans, accepting their Holy orders and attending their churches. It is said that it was only a few days before his death, he was induced to make his peace with the Church, though that has been questioned. At his death, his books and papers were removed by the friars. He was buried in the churchyard of the Church of St Dunstan-in-the-West.\n\nWalsh wrote (1672-1684) a series of controversial letters against Pope Gregory VII's doctrine of papal supremacy over princes; a voluminous \"History of the Remonstrance\" (1674); \"Hibernica\" (1682), a history of Ireland; in 1686 a reply to the \"Popery of Thomas Barlow\" (1607-1691), Barlow being the Bishop of Lincoln; and other works. In these writings he consistently upheld the doctrine of civil liberty against the pretensions of the papacy.\n\n"}

{"id": "2118377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118377", "title": "FAB 1", "text": "FAB 1\n\nFAB 1 is a pink, six-wheeled car seen in the 1960s British science-fiction television series \"Thunderbirds\", its three film adaptations, and its reboot, \"Thunderbirds Are Go\".\n\nIn the original \"Thunderbirds\" (1965–66), as well as the feature films \"Thunderbirds Are Go\" (1966) and \"Thunderbird 6\" (1968), FAB 1 is depicted as a modified Rolls-Royce. Owned by International Rescue agent Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, the car is usually driven by her butler, Aloysius Parker. The driver sits in a central position at the front of the passenger compartment, which is covered by a bulletproof bubble canopy.\n\nFAB 1 was modified by Brains, the inventor of the \"Thunderbirds\" machines, to include weaponry and gadgetry such as front- and back-mounted machine guns (although grappling hooks are seen to shoot out of the rear in the episode \"The Perils of Penelope\"). The car is also equipped with a smoke screen canister and oil slick dispenser, extendable tyre studs (for increased traction), and hydrofoils (or outriggers; for travel on water and snow, respectively).\n\nOn the choice of make, series co-creator Gerry Anderson explained that \"considering [Penelope's] personality, and the role she played in International Rescue, it could only be a Rolls-Royce.\" In 2004, Rolls-Royce's head of public relations in the 1960s said that the company \"couldn't see any harm in [production company AP Films'] request, and as the series was aimed at children we thought it would be good for the cars – give them a modern image and, you never know, inspire a child to own one, one day.\"\n\nDesigner Derek Meddings remembered FAB 1 for its \"outrageous styling, which bore no resemblance to any Rolls-Royce ever produced\". The plywood filming model was equipped with fully-functional steering and headlights and cost £2,500 to build in 1964 (approximately £ in ). A six-wheel drive was incorporated to distinguish its look from that of real-life vehicles. Rolls-Royce supervised the construction and supplied a genuine R-R radiator grille costing £100, complete with Spirit of Ecstasy ornament. This was used for close-ups that featured a larger-scale model of the car, such as shots of the forward machine guns firing and a stock photograph of the front of the car that appears in the series' closing credits. As the car was the most expensive prop to be built for the series, special security measures were followed when it was being used on-set.\n\nIn the 2004 live-action film, \"Thunderbirds\", FAB 1 is still pink and powered by a six-wheel drive. Its glass canopy is tinted, and it is now capable of flight as well as travel on land and sea. Prior to flight, the car's boot panels open, exposing the gas turbine engine; the wings then extend from the undercarriage. During flight, the rear set of wheels folds into the main vehicle body to prevent unnecessary drag. The passenger compartment doubles as a life raft in the event of an emergency at sea, while buoyancy tanks hidden in the body panelling ensure that the compartment remains afloat after it has broken away from the rest of the vehicle.\n\nRolls-Royce and its owner BMW declined to be involved in FAB 1's re-design. This led production company Working Title to approach Ford, who accepted the commission and adapted the car from its eleventh-generation Thunderbird. According to Working Title's head of marketing, Rolls-Royce had pushed for the vehicle to be \"one of their standard cars - and that would have been too sedate. If you're transferring something like this to the big screen, you have to make it bigger and better.\" He also called FAB 1 a \"crazy missed marketing opportunity\" for Rolls-Royce given the car's prominence in the film. Ford's designers said that due to the car's versatility, \"there was a level of restriction that we had to encompass [...] Then we had to identify the link with the \"Thunderbirds\" theme and, from our perspective, identify a \"T-bird\" essence that wasn't a deliberate rip-off.\"\n\nThe finished car was fully functional and roadworthy, and appeared in a segment of the motoring TV series \"Top Gear\", during which it was road-tested by presenter James May. May noted that it was not the most practical of cars, its excessive length making it difficult to drive through small English villages. Testing the car for \"The Daily Telegraph\", Ian Adcock compared the driver's section to a \"command module\", noting its armrest controls and \"fighter aircraft-style joystick\" in place of a conventional steering wheel. He also observed that the car \"understeers like a yacht, so you constantly have to feed more and more lock on as you power through corners.\" In a preview, \"Starburst\" magazine described the new FAB 1 as a \"futuristic sports car which recaptures as much of the original's feel as possible.\" The car was negatively received by \"XPosé\" and \"SFX\" magazines; \"XPosé\" commented that FAB 1 \"still look[ed] rubbish\" while \"SFX\" described it as \"rather ugly\" and argued that fans of the original \"Thunderbirds\" would not regard it as canon. The car is currently displayed at the Heritage Motor Centre in Warwickshire.\n\nIn 1966, a replica of FAB 1, based on a \"Chinese six\" (four front, two back) Bedford VAL coach chassis, was built to transport Gerry and Sylvia Anderson to the premiere of \"Thunderbirds Are Go\" in London. It was constructed by the company Toby Baxter Contracts in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire under Sylvia's supervision. The replica had a fibreglass body and a Bedford six-cylinder petrol engine, connected to a two-speed Powerglide gearbox. The axles were widened to fit the width of the body, which was a steel-covered framework \"moulded\" with filler to simulate the angles of the vehicle as seen in the TV series and films. The wheels were supplied by Land Rover, and the aluminium bumpers by a specialist welding company. The perspex sides lifted up on screws, while the sides of the body folded out and under the vehicle to form a step. The radiator grille, which was not vertical as in standard Rolls-Royce models, was custom-built and inclined forwards at the top, complete with moveable slats and imitation machine gun. As a number plate with the registration \"FAB 1\" had already been issued, the replica incorporated revolving plates that showed \"FAB 1\" on one side and the real registration on the other.\n\nOn the night of the premiere, the replica broke down after a few hundred yards and the Andersons were forced to complete the journey by taxi. Rolls-Royce were not impressed by the car and made several attempts to buy it and have it destroyed. For a time, the company were successful in forcing the removal of the genuine Rolls-Royce grille, which was replaced with a facsimile bearing the initials \"LP\". After a full restoration, the vehicle was installed at the Cars of the Stars Motor Museum in Keswick, Cumbria in 1989. Concerned that that the vehicle could distract motorists and even cause traffic accidents, the local police asked the museum's owner, Peter Nelson, not to drive it on public roads. Nelson described the car as \"utterly scary [to drive] at any sort of speed.\" In 2013, the car was sold to the Dezer Car Museum in Miami, Florida.\n\nGerry Anderson would later commission a second full-sized FAB 1 replica. This vehicle was a modified Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit, with the bonnet line extended to house the six-wheel drive, complemented by double Ackermann steering. It did not have the bubble canopy or centre-mounted steering of the original, and apart from the pink paint job and re-trim, the passenger compartment was stock Rolls-Royce. This model attended Anderson's funeral on 13 January 2013.\n\nThe UK vehicle registration \"FAB 1\" was first issued in July 1946. It was later assigned to a white Jaguar XJ6 before the number was purchased by broadcaster Chris Evans in 2012 for £75,000. In 2013, the registration was temporarily assigned to a bespoke pink Rolls-Royce Ghost that had been donated for use in raising breast cancer awareness.\n\n\"FAB 2\", Lady Penelope's private yacht, appears in the \"Thunderbirds\" episode \"The Man From MI.5\". At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Parker has lost the ship in a game of poker. FAB 3, Penelope's racehorse, is kept at Ascot Stables and is the winner of many derby races.\n"}

Having inherited the estates of his father and of his uncle, Sir John Wallop, he was knighted in 1569 and was chosen member of parliament for Southampton in 1572. His connection with Ireland, began in 1579, when he was appointed vice-treasurer of that country. This position was a very thankless and difficult one and Wallop appears to have undertaken it very unwillingly.\n\nHowever, Sir Henry reached Dublin and was soon immersed in the troubles caused by the rebellion of Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond, finding, in his own words, it was \"easier to talk at home of Irish wars than to be in them.\" In July 1582, he and Adam Loftus, archbishop of Dublin, were appointed Lord Justices (Ireland), and they were responsible for the government of Ireland for just two years, after which they were succeeded by Sir John Perrot.\n\nSir Henry continued to fill the office of vice-treasurer, and at Enniscorthy, where he had secured a lease of lands, he set up a colony of Englishmen and opened up a trade with Madeira. As a member of the Irish council he quarrelled with Perrot, and then from 1589 to 1595 he was in England, entertaining the queen at Farleigh Wallop in 1591. Having returned to Ireland he was sent to Dundalk to attempt to make peace with Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, but this proved a vain errand. At length, after many entreaties, he was allowed to resign the treasurership, but before he could arrange to leave Ireland he died.\n\nWallop's eldest son, Sir Henry Wallop (1568-1642), who acted as his father's deputy in Ireland, left an only son, Robert Wallop (1601-1667). A member of parliament for nearly 40 years, and a supporter of the parliamentary party during the English Civil War, Robert was one of the judges of Charles I, although he did not sign the death warrant. He was active under the Commonwealth, being a member of nearly all the councils of state. At the restoration he was deprived of his estates and was imprisoned, and he died in the Tower of London on 19 November 1667. Robert's son Henry (d. 1673) was the grandfather of John Wallop, 1st Earl of Portsmouth.\n"}

The village is mostly within the bounds of the private walled estate of Englefield House. The village is in the district of West Berkshire, close to Reading.\n\nIn 870, the village was the site of the Battle of Englefield. This was fought between the Anglo-Saxons, under Æthelwulf, Ealdorman of Berkshire, and the Danes, and resulted in a resounding victory for the Saxons. The battle was the first of a series in the winter of 870-1. The village may have been named after the battle, Englefield meaning \"English field\".\n\nThe place-name 'Englefield' is first attested in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle for 871, where it appears as \"Engla feld\". It appears as \"Englefel\" in the Domesday Book of 1086, and as \"Englefeld\" in the Feet of Fines for 1196. The name indicates settlement by the Angles in Saxon territory.\n\nEnglefield House was the home of the Englefield family, supposedly from the time of King Edgar and certainly until the Elizabethan era when the present building was erected. The house eventually passed to the Benyon family, as part of the largest privately owned estate in West Berkshire.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Richard Fellowes Benyon rebuilt the villagers' houses as a model estate village and provided them with such amenities as a swimming pool, soup kitchen and a new school. Today the estate, owned by a family company, the Englefield Estate, covers some , and its farm is a beneficiary of European Union agricultural subsidies. The village relies on and contributes to the amenities and organisations in Theale and Tilehurst as well as Reading which bound it to the south and east.\n\n"}

It forms a strip parish which tapers in the south where it contains the hamlet, Halfway. It has Welford Park which has annual snowdrop displays, the M4 motorway and RAF Welford.\n\nThe history of the manor is long, held by Abingdon Abbey for centuries until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Overlordship was for some decades after in the hands of the Crown, and was attached to the manor of Benham Lovell, while the overlordship of the vill of Easton, Welford was attached to the manor of East Greenwich. Its history included a share held by Sir Thomas Knyvet(t) and within 20 years sale to Francis Jones (Lord Mayor) in the 1600s who was not related. It descended in the same family to the Mason, Archer and Houblon branches.\n\nThe main vestige is the wholly rebuilt manor house at Welford Park, which can be visited for its woodlands and early spring displays of snowdrops, is in the village.\n\nIt was described in a most detailed county history and geography of 1924 as a \"large modern red brick building, surrounded by a deer park of .

It features no members of the Lou Reed-era group other than multi-instrumentalist Doug Yule, who wrote and recorded the album almost entirely by himself. Yule had joined the Velvet Underground prior to recording their self-titled third album, replacing founding member John Cale, and had contributed significantly to the fourth album, \"Loaded\". Following the departures of the remaining founding members (Reed and Sterling Morrison), Yule took control of the band. Longtime drummer Maureen Tucker was slated to appear on \"Squeeze\" by Yule, but she was dismissed by the band's manager, Steve Sesnick.\n\nFollowing a promotional tour for the album by Yule and a backing band, Yule called it quits, bringing the Velvet Underground to an end until the group reformed for a tour in 1993. \"Squeeze\" failed to chart and quickly fell into obscurity after its release. Critics generally dismiss the record as \"a Velvet Underground album in name only\".\n\nIn 1971, the Velvet Underground consisted of Doug Yule (vocals, guitar), Willie Alexander (keyboards, vocals), Walter Powers (bass guitar) and Maureen Tucker (drums). This version of the band had toured the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in October and November 1971 to support its latest album, \"Loaded\", which had been written and recorded when Lou Reed was in the band, and which had seen a European release in March 1971. The plan was to record a second and final album for their record company, Atlantic Records, afterwards, but Atlantic lost faith and decided to issue an archive audience recording from 1970 featuring Lou Reed, \"Live at Max's Kansas City\", instead.\n\nAfter the tour, band manager Steve Sesnick managed to get a recording deal with Polydor UK to record a final Velvet Underground album. Alexander, Powers and Tucker were sent back to the United States by Sesnick, however, presumably for him to retain maximum control over the finished product. Thus, although \"Squeeze\" was released nominally as a Velvet Underground album, Yule was the only Velvet to actually perform on it. Yule later said, \"I don't think Moe [Tucker] would have been expensive in money, but too costly in terms of 'management', meaning that she didn't take a lot of bullshit and would have taken a lot of 'handling' on Sesnick's part.\" Yule also recalled that the album \"was done with just me. All the basic tracks were laid down with drums and me. Ian Paice of Deep Purple played the drums. So he and I would lay down a track. How much interplay can you have when all it is one guitar or a piano? You can hear that, it's kind of dead. I think you get more when you have 3 or 4 people playing together, they feed off each other, they work together and something comes out of it, it's bigger.\"\n\nThe eleven songs that make up \"Squeeze\" were written by Yule and recorded with the help of Ian Paice, with additional occasional saxophone and backing singer assistance. They range from Beatles-like whimsy (\"Crash\") via pop to typical 1970s rock (\"Mean Old Man\"). Yule later recalled, \"I remember sitting on a plane writing extensive notes on the mixing of the album. I sent it to Steve and none of my suggestions were taken, I'm sure he didn't even read it. He mixed it for the best possible commercial success. (...) It's really embarrassing. I gave what I had at the time. There are parts of it I hate and parts I don't. But if I had to do it over again, it would be a completely different album, with different people and have nothing to do with Sesnick.\"\n\n\"Squeeze\" was recorded in the autumn of 1972 and released in the United Kingdom, France, Germany (all 1973), Spain (1974), and Japan (year unknown). No singles were taken off it and the album did not chart. Yule assembled a backing band consisting of Rob Norris (guitar), George Kay (bass guitar) and Mark Nauseef (drums) to tour the United Kingdom in November and December 1972 to promote the upcoming album; a live recording from this tour is included on the 2001 live box set \"Final V.U. 1971–1973\". After the tour, during which they were deserted by Sesnick, Yule also called it quits, bringing the Velvet Underground to an end.\n\n\"Squeeze\" saw a number of re-issues in France during the 1970s and early 1980s. It went out of print afterwards, until it received a compact disc and new LP release in 2012 by Kismet Records (see below). The status of \"Squeeze\" in the Velvet Underground's recorded canon was generally regarded as dubious well into the 1990s. In the mid-1970s, the \"NME Book of Rock\" counted it as \"a Velvet Underground album in name only\". The 1995 CD boxed set \"Peel Slowly and See\" includes the four studio albums from the Lou Reed era of the band, but excludes \"Squeeze\". In the liner notes, David Fricke didn't offer any analysis of the album, and dismissed it as \"an embarrassment to the VU discography\". Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine says \"it doesn't just ride the coattails of VU's legacy but deliberately co-opts their achievement – but it's listenable, something its reputation never suggests\". In March 2012, \"Classic Rock\" included the album at 28 in their list of The 50 Worst Albums of All Time.\n\nIn recent years however, the album has been revisited by both critics and musicians with more sympathetic and favorable reviews. In 2011 music writer Steven Shehori included \"Squeeze\" in his \"Criminally Overlooked Albums\" series for \"The Huffington Post\", and in a lengthy review of the album, offered the following positive assessment of \"Squeeze:\" \"if you pluck it from the shackles of its murky back-story, \"Squeeze\" is nothing short of a quintessential listening experience.\" The UK band Squeeze took their name from its title according to band member Chris Difford, who also offered the following opinion of the album in a 2012 interview: \"It's an odd record, but the name came from that, definitely. […] In a retrospective way I really enjoy it. It has kind of a naivety about it\". In 1995, Doug Yule described the recording of \"Squeeze\" being \"like the blind leading the blind, me leading myself. That's what came out of it, I don't even have a copy of it. But it's kind of a nice memory for me and kind of an embarrassment at the same time. I wish I had my eyes wider open, but it was nice to get my name and my songs out there.\"\n\nThe song \"Friends\" was included by the indie rock band Luna on their covers album \"A Sentimental Education\" which was released in September 2017.\n\nIn 2012, \"Squeeze\" received both a CD release and a new LP release from Kismet Records, a label that specializes in reissuing obscure albums by relatively unknown acts. On the CD, a slight amount of white noise can be heard throughout, indicating that it was recorded directly from an LP copy of the album. The reissues do not appear to be officially licensed from Polydor. A disclaimer included with the release states:\n\nAn e-mail address is then provided for the owner(s) of the music to contact Kismet for payment of royalties.\n\nThe reissues contain no outtakes. The packages do feature a short article from \"Melody Maker\" written by Richard Williams, originally published on 6 October 1971. The article features brief comments from Yule about the then-current UK tour that he was completing with original Velvet drummer Maureen Tucker and recently added members Walter Powers and William Alexander.\n\nAll songs written by Doug Yule.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118446", "title": "John Perrot", "text": "John Perrot\n\nSir John Perrot (7×11 November 1528 – 3 November 1592) served as lord deputy to Queen Elizabeth I of England during the Tudor conquest of Ireland. He died in custody in the Tower of London after conviction on charges of high treason for his conduct in that office. It was speculated that he was an illegitimate son of Henry VIII.\n\nPerrot was born between 7 and 11 November 1528, probably at the family seat of Haroldston near Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire in Wales. He was the only son of Thomas Perrot (1504/5–1531) and Mary Berkeley (c.1511–c.1586), the daughter of James Berkeley (died c.1515) of Thornbury, Gloucestershire. He had two sisters: Jane, who married Sir John Philipps of Picton Castle; and Elizabeth, who married John Price of Gogerddan.\n\nPerrot resembled Henry VIII in temperament and physical appearance, and it was widely believed that he was the bastard son of the late King. The main source for this belief was Sir Robert Naunton (husband of Perrot's granddaughter, Penelope), who had never known Perrot and used second-hand accounts to make his case. The case is weakened by the fact that Perrot was Mary Berkeley's third child, not her first, and that she and the King are not recorded to have been in the same place at the crucial time. Naunton claimed that Sir Owen Hopton, Lieutenant of the Tower of London, overheard Perrot say, \"\"Will the Queen suffer her brother to be offered up as a sacrifice to the envy of his frisking adversaries?\"\", suggesting that Perrot himself asserted his royal paternity. However, Hopton had been removed from office by the Queen eighteen months prior to Perrot's imprisonment, so he could not have overheard Perrot make the claim there.\nPerrot joined the household of William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester, and thereby gained his introduction to Henry VIII. His advancement faltered on the death of the King in January 1547, but in the following month he was knighted at the coronation of Henry's successor, Edward VI.\n\nIn 1551 Perrot was appointed High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire, and in June of the same year he visited France in the train of William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton, who had been sent to arrange Edward VI's betrothal to Elisabeth of Valois, the infant daughter of Henry II of France. Perrot's skill as a knight and in the hunt fascinated King Henry, who sought to retain him for reward. Perrot declined, but on his return to England his debts were paid by the French Crown.\n\nDuring the reign of Mary I Perrot suffered a brief imprisonment in the Fleet with his uncle, Robert Perrot, on a charge of sheltering heretics at his house in Wales. Following his release he declined to assist the Earl of Pembroke in seeking out heretics in south Wales, but in 1557 was content to serve the same Earl at the capture of Saint-Quentin in France.\n\nPerrot inherited the castle and lordship of Carew. At the beginning of Elizabeth I's reign the naval defence of South Wales was entrusted to his care, and his advancement continued in 1562, when he was elected Knight of Pembrokeshire. He served as member of parliament for Carmarthenshire in 1547, Sandwich in 1553 and 1555, Wareham in 1559 (presumably through pressure exerted on the Rogers family by the 2nd Earl of Bedford, his former commander), Pembrokeshire in 1563, and Haverfordwest in 1589.\n\nIn 1570 Perrot reluctantly accepted the newly created post of Lord President of the Irish province of Munster, which was in the throes of the first of the Desmond Rebellions. He landed at Waterford in February of the following year and, in a vigorous and gruelling campaign, reduced the province to peace.\n\nThe chief rebel, Fitzmaurice, eluded government forces for some time. In one grisly incident, after fifty rebels had been slain, Perrot sought to awe his enemy by cutting off the heads of the corpses and fixing them to the market cross of Kilmallock. Fitzmaurice still refused to come in, and Perrot issued him with a challenge to single combat, which the rebel declined with the comment, \"\"For if I should kill Sir John Perrot the Queen of England can send another president into this province; but if he do kill me there is none other to succeed me or to command as I do.\"\" Perrot's challenge provoked mutterings from the more level-headed servants of the Crown, and his reputation for rash judgment was confirmed when he was ambushed by the rebels, who outnumbered his force ten to one, only to be relieved when the rebels mistook a small cavalry company for the advance party of a larger Crown force. But in 1572, after a second and successful siege of the rebel stronghold of Castlemaine, he was vindicated on Fitzmaurice's submission.\n\nDuring his presidency Perrot authorised over 800 hangings, most of them by martial law. After the rebellion he criticised the Crown's reinstatement of Fitzmaurice's superior, the Earl of Desmond, as chief nobleman of Munster. He requested his own recall, but this was in vain and in July 1573 he quit Ireland without leave. Upon presenting himself at court he was permitted to resign his office, and was succeeded by Sir William Drury.\n\nPerrot returned to Carew in Wales, where he intended, \"\"to lead a countryman's life and to keep out of debt\"\". He was appointed vice-Admiral of the Welsh seas and member of the Council of the Marches, and served as Mayor of Haverfordwest (1575–77). In his personal estates he converted several castles into mansions and improved his land, although there were continual complaints of his practice of rack-renting and enclosures.\n\nIn 1578 Perrot was accused by his deputy-Admiral, Richard Vaughan, of tyranny, subversion of justice, and dealing with pirates. The accusations may have been exaggerated, and Perrot retained the confidence of the Crown: in the same year he was appointed commissioner for piracy in Pembrokeshire, and in the following year was given command of a naval squadron charged with the interception of Spanish ships on the Irish coast. In 1579, during a voyage to Ireland, he chased a pirate ship to the Flemish coast and captured the commander, Deryfold. On her approach to the Thames estuary Perrot's ship was struck by a storm, and while all on board prepared for death Perrot said to his son, Thomas, \"\"Well Boy, God bless you and I give you my blessing. I wish to God that you were ashore and the Queen's ship safe then I should care the less about myself.\"\" The ship was saved with the skill of the captive Deryfold, who was pardoned by the Queen on Perrot's petition.\n\nIn 1583 Thomas was married to Dorothy Devereux (daughter of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, and step-daughter of the great royal favourite Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester). The match was no doubt intended to strengthen Perrot politically, but it had precisely the opposite effect: the Queen, whose consent to the marriage had not been sought, took grave offence, suspecting a conspiracy between Perrot and Leicester's wife, Lettice Knollys, whom she detested.\n\nIn 1584 Perrot was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland, to replace Lord Grey de Wilton who had been recalled to England by the Queen two years earlier. His chief task was to establish the plantation of the southern province of Munster, a significant escalation of colonial policy. The Crown sought to parcel out lands at nominal rents from the confiscated estates of the lately defeated Earl of Desmond – some 600,000 acres (2,400 km²) — on condition that the undertakers plant English farmers and labourers to build towns and work the land.\n\nBefore he had time to begin in the south, Perrot got wind of raids into the northern province of Ulster by the Highland clans of Maclean and MacDonnell at the invitation of Sorley Boy MacDonnell. He marched a contingent of the Royal Irish Army beyond the Pale to confront the invaders, but Sorley Boy escaped by crossing over to Scotland, only to return later with reinforcements. Elizabeth roundly abused her deputy for launching such an unadvised campaign, but by 1586 Perrot had brought Sorley Boy to a mutually beneficial submission. At about this time he also sanctioned the kidnap of Hugh Roe O'Donnell (lured to a wine tasting on a merchant ship and then sealed in a cabin and brought to Dublin), a move which gave the crown some leverage in western Ulster. Perrot's northern strategy also secured the submission of Hugh Maguire, Lord of Fermanagh.\n\nThe plantation of Munster got off to a slow start in the face of lawsuits brought by landowners associated with the Geraldine rebels. In the west Perrot did have success in 1585 by perfecting a composition of the province of Connaught, an unusually even-handed contract between Crown and landowners by which the Queen received certain rents in return for settling land titles and tenant dues. In the same year a parliament was convened at Dublin, the first since 1569, with great hopes expressed upon the attendance of the Gaelic lords. The sessions proved a disappointment: although the act for the attainder of Desmond (clearing the escheat of the rebel's estates to the Crown) was passed, the ambitious schedule of legislation ran into difficulty, particularly over the suspension of Poynings' Law. At the prorogation in 1587 Perrot was so frustrated with the influence of factions within both houses of parliament (orchestrated to a large degree by the Earl of Ormond) that he begged to be recalled to England.\n\nPerrot's unsparing criticism of his associates in government made him numerous enemies. His plan for the conversion of the revenues of St. Patrick's Cathedral to fund two colleges led to a sustained quarrel with the Archbishop of Dublin, Adam Loftus, which Perrot wilfully aggravated by his interference with the prelate's secular authority as Lord Chancellor. He also interfered with Bingham's government of Connaught; caused the council secretary Sir Geoffrey Fenton to be imprisoned for debt; and in May 1587 was accused of striking the elderly Knight Marshal, Sir Nicholas Bagenal, in the council chamber, an incident his enemies blamed on his drunkenness. In January 1588 Elizabeth granted Perrot's request for recall. Six months later, at the height of the Armada emergency, he was succeeded by Sir William Fitzwilliam.\n\nUpon Perrot's return to England he was elected Member of Parliament in 1589 for Haverfordwest and appointed to the Privy Council, where he maintained his interest in Irish affairs through correspondence with several members of the council in Dublin. But his enemies were working against him. In the heated politics following the defeat of the Spanish Armada he was accused of treason, based on allegations made in Ireland by a former priest and condemned prisoner, Sir Dennis O'Roghan. The evidence was provided in letters allegedly addressed by Perrot as Lord Deputy (with his signature attached) to King Philip II of Spain and the Duke of Parma, in which certain treasonable promises were made on the future dominion of England, Wales and Ireland.\n\nFitzwilliam started an investigation into the charges in Dublin, but O'Roghan's record of forging documents was quickly produced, and for a time it seemed the allegations would fail for lack of credible evidence. Rather than let the matter lie, it was decided (perhaps at Perrot's urging) to inquire into the manner in which the allegations had been raised in the first place, a procedure likely to embarrass Fitzwilliam. The inquiry was held at Dublin by a commission that included several of Perrot's favourites on the Dublin council: Nicholas White, (Master of the Rolls in Ireland), Charles Calthorpe (Attorney General), and Nicholas Walsh (former Speaker of the House of Commons).\n\nO'Roghan alleged that he had been tortured by members of this commission, and Fitzwilliam was instantly directed on strict instruction from the Queen to resume his original investigation and forward the findings to the Privy Council in London. Perrot faced a moment of crisis when further allegations were made – most notably by his former secretary, Henry Bird – of his frequent use in private conversation of violent language against the Queen. He was also accused of having prior knowledge of the rebellion in 1589 of Sir Brian O'Rourke (later extradited from Scotland and hanged at London), which had occurred under the government of Bingham in Connaught.\n\nPerrot ended up in the Tower of London and in 1592 stood trial before a special commission on charges of high treason. O'Roghan's letters and the evidence concerning the O'Rourke rebellion played their part in the prosecution case, but the evidence most vividly presented was of Perrot's remarks about Queen Elizabeth: \"\"God's wounds, this it is to serve a base bastard pissing kitchen woman, if I had served any prince in Christendom I have not been so dealt withal\".\" Further evidence showed he had disparaged her legitimacy on several occasions. Perrot protested his loyalty and, in reaction to a hectoring prosecution counsel, eloquently cried out, \"\"You win men's lives away with words\"\". But his defence descended into blustering, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Sentencing was put off for some months in the hope of a royal pardon, but Perrot died in the Tower in September that year. Whether Elizabeth actually intended to pardon him is uncertain, although there are grounds to believe he was poisoned in anticipation of his release from custody.\n\nFollowing Perrot's imprisonment some of his Irish favourites had been replaced in their council seats by English appointees, who fully equated the Protestant cause with the state and inclined to hard dealings with Gaelic Ireland. Fitzwilliam felt free to pursue a policy opposed in crucial aspects to Perrot's, and the lords of Ulster (including Hugh O'Neill) suffered increasing government encroachment on their territories until the outbreak of the Nine Years War (1595–1603).\n\nPerrot married firstly Anne Cheyne (d.1553) (daughter of Sir Thomas Cheyne by his first wife, Frideswide Frowyk, daughter of Sir Thomas Frowyk), by whom he had a son and heir, Sir Thomas Perrot (d.1594).\n\nAfter the death of his first wife Perrot remained unmarried for a decade. In 1563 or 1564 he married Jane Prust (d.1593), widow of Lewis Pollard (d.1563) of Oakford, Devon, and daughter of Hugh Prust (d.1559) of Thorry, Devonshire. She had a son and two daughters by Perrot:\n\n\nOn appointment as Lord Deputy of Ireland, Perrot had made a deed of settlement entailing his estates on his sons and their male descendants, and in default on his cousin Thomas Perrott of Broke Co. Carmarthen. The settlement may have been a precaution against the hazards of office in Ireland.\n\nPerrot's first son, Thomas, was imprisoned after his marriage to Dorothy Devereux, and she was banished from Court. In March 1593, four months after Perrot's death, Thomas was restored in blood. Dorothy was not restored to favour until after her husband's death in 1594.\n\nPerrot fathered at least four illegitimate children, Sir James Perrot, John Perrot (born c.1565), Elizabeth Perrot, and another daughter whose name is unknown. Sir James Perrot authored the manuscript \"The life, deedes and death of Sir John Perrott, knight\", published in 1728. John Perrot's name appears in the Inner Temple Register in an entry dated 5 June 1583: \"John Perot, of Haryve, Co. Pembroke, 3rd son of John Perot, Knight\". Elizabeth, who married Hugh Butler of Pembroke, was the granddaughter of Sir Christopher Hatton, a favourite of Elizabeth I and enemy of Sir John (the source of their hostility being Sir John's relationship with Sir Christopher's unmarried illegitimate daughter, also named Elizabeth).\n\n\n\n\n"}

The modern civil parish includes the historical parish of Little or East Shefford, a small, much-reduced community downstream. It also covers the village of Shefford Woodlands, about south-west of Great Shefford, near Junction 14 on the M4 motorway.\n\nThe toponym of both Sheffords is derived from the Old English for \"sheep ford\".\n\nGreat Shefford village has a primary school, which forms part of Chaddleworth St. Andrew's & Shefford Church of England Federated Primary Schools. It also has a pub-restaurant, \"The Great Shefford\", a shop and a petrol station.\n\nThe Church of England parish church of Saint Mary is one of two existing round-tower churches in Berkshire. The other one is at St Gregory's parish church at nearby Welford.\nUnlike the three round-towered churches in Sussex, where the towers are plain flint cylinders with few openings, the tower at Great Shefford is built up of sections with ample fenestration, more like the East Anglian type. The base of the tower at least seems to date from the 13th century, and it joins the west wall of the nave in such a way that suggests it was constructed at the same time as the nave, which shows early Gothic features.\n\nSt Mary's belongs to the West Downland Benefice, a group of eight neighbouring churches. There is a service held at St Mary's on the first, second and third Sunday of the month.\n\nThe church of Saint Stephen at Shefford Woodlands is a former Methodist chapel that was consecrated as part of St Mary's Church of England parish in 1911.\n\nA group service is held at St Stephen's on the fourth Sunday of the month.\n\nSt Thomas' Church, East Shefford is redundant. However, it is listed as a Grade I historical building and contains important monuments to the widespread Fettiplace family.\n\nThe 2011 Census recorded a parish population of 937, and 880 are listed on the Millennium Stone opposite the petrol station. The population had grown by approximately 5 per cent since the 2011 census.\n\nIn birth order:\n\nReading Buses route 4 (Newbury–Lambourn) serves Great Shefford. From 1898 until 1960 the parish was served by Great Shefford railway station on the Lambourn Valley Railway. The nearest mainline station today is Newbury, 10.5 miles/16 km away.\n\nThe A338 between Hungerford to the south and Wantage to the north runs through the village, one-and-a-half miles north of Junction 14 on the M4 motorway.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118460", "title": "Hood ornament", "text": "Hood ornament\n\nA hood/bonnet ornament, radiator cap, motor mascot or car mascot is a specially crafted model which symbolizes a car company like a badge, located on the front center portion of the hood. It has been used as an adornment nearly since the inception of automobiles.\n\nAccording to the author of \"A History of Cars\" written for youth, the first \"hood ornament\" was a sun-crested falcon (to bring good luck) mounted on Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun's chariot.\n\nIn the early years, automobiles had their radiator caps outside of the hood and on top of the grille which also served as an indicator of the temperature of the engine's coolant fluid. The Boyce MotoMeter Company was issued a patent in 1912 for a radiator cap that incorporated a thermometer that was visible to the driver with a sensor that measured the heat of the water vapor, rather than the water itself. This became a useful gauge for the driver because many early engines did not have water pumps, but a circulation system based on the \"thermo-syphon\" principle as in the Ford Model T.\n\nThe \"exposed radiator cap became a focal point for automobile personalization.\"\n\nHood ornaments were popular in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, with many automakers fitting them to their vehicles. During the 1920s, advertisements for Mercedes-Benz emphasized their \"star\" hood ornament as representing the \"world famous product of the oldest automobile works in the world\" and as the ultimate symbol of luxury.\n\nMoreover, a healthy business was created in the supply of accessory mascots available to anyone who wanted to add a hood ornament or car mascot to their automobile. Most companies like Desmo and Smith's are now out of business with only Louis Lejeune Ltd. in England surviving. Sculptors such as Bazin, Paillet, Sykes, Renevey, and Lejeune all created finely detailed sculptures in miniature, like Statuettes.\n\nRestrictions to the fitting of ornaments on the front of vehicles have been introduced in some jurisdictions. Projecting decorative designs on the hood may increase the risk of injury to pedestrians in the case of an accident.\n\nRegulations introduced in the United States for the 1968 model year vehicles meant the disappearance of fixed stand-up hood ornaments, as well as spinner wheel protrusions. Later versions featured flexibly mounted (spring-loaded) stand-up hood ornaments designed to fold without breaking on impact such as on the 1974 AMC Ambassador and on the 1986 Jeep Wagoneer (SJ). \n\nIn the European Union, since 1974 all new cars have had to conform to a European directive on vehicle exterior projections. Rolls Royce's mascot is now mounted on a spring-loaded mechanism designed to retract instantly into the radiator shell if struck with a force greater than . The Mercedes-Benz and many other ornaments were designed with a spring mount to fold on impact. For aftermarket ornaments, breakaway nylon fixings are available that comply with EC Directive 74/483.\n\nMany automakers wanted their own emblems displayed on their vehicles' hoods, and Boyce Motormeter accommodated them with corporate logos or mascots, as well as numerous organizations that wanted custom cap emblems to identify their members. The company had over 300 such customers at one time during the mid-1920s, for car, truck, tractor, boat, airplane, and motorcycle manufacturers, and in 1927, had 1,800 employees in six countries: U.S., England, Canada, Australia, France, and Germany. The hundreds of motor vehicle manufacturers before 1929 meant many customers for their customized emblems.\n\nBrand identification continues to be important \"as firms try to distinguish their company's cookie-cutter SUV, sedan or pick-up truck from another company's cookie-cutter SUV, sedan or pick-up truck merely with a hood ornament or a name on the bumper.\"\n\nAlong with the grille, the hood ornament is often a distinctive styling element and many marques use it as their primary brand identifier.\n\nExamples of hood ornaments include:\n\nAdditionally, many models such as Buick's Regal, the Chevrolet Impala, or Chrysler's Cordoba had their own unique emblem and accompanying distinctive standup hood ornament.\n\nThe radiator cap was transformed into an art form and became a way of individualizing the car, \"representing a company's vision of the automobile\", or \"speaking volumes about the owner\" of the vehicle.\n\nHood ornaments are usually cast in brass, zinc, or bronze and finished in a chrome plated finish. During the years when chrome plate was unavailable, they were plated in either silver or nickel. Some also incorporated other materials, such as plastic, bakelite, or colored glass.The 1950 Ford Custom DeLuxe hood ornament was molded in Plexiglas. Others incorporated a light bulb for illumination at night. Pontiac featured a lighted Indian-head hood ornament through 1955 when it was replaced by flying V design. \n\nThe best-known glass mascots were made by René Lalique in France. Other sellers or producers of glass mascots include Sabino in France, Red Ashay in England, and Persons Majestic in the U.S. The latter two had their products made in Czechoslovakia. The Lalique company, like Louis Lejeune, is one of the few survivors from this era of motoring.\n\nSome hood ornaments are attractive for more than the car's owners such as the red-white-and-blue golden lion crests that were on the hoods of 1950 Fords that children took to decorate their hats, belts, or bicycles. The company solved the problem by offering a free miniature crest to all the kids that wrote letters requesting one.\n\nThere is a collectors market for hood ornaments and car mascots.\n\n"}
