{"id": "1807917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807917", "title": "Battle of Spicheren", "text": "Battle of Spicheren\n\nThe Battle of Spicheren, also known as the Battle of Forbach, was a battle during the Franco-Prussian War. The German victory compelled the French to withdraw to the defenses of Metz. The Battle of Spicheren, on 6 August, was the second of three critical French defeats. Moltke had originally planned to keep Bazaine's army on the Saar river until he could attack it with the 2nd Army in front and the 1st Army on its left flank, while the 3rd Army closed towards the rear. The aging General von Steinmetz made an overzealous, unplanned move, leading the 1st Army south from his position on the Moselle. He moved straight toward the town of Spicheren, cutting off Prince Frederick Charles from his forward cavalry units in the process.\n\nThe French declared war before their troops were in position to invade Germany. The Germans, commanded by Field Marshal von Moltke, began to assemble into three armies, which were to invade France and to occupy Paris. On 4 August they crossed the frontier, where 3rd Army conquered the walled city of Wissembourg, Two days later they defeated the French again at Wörth. On the same day 2nd Army was marching westward, even though one of it corps was still on the railroad. \nWhen Napoleon III arrived to take command of the French field army, he followed the urging of his generals and ordered General Lebœuf to besiege Saarbrücken. Following a vigorous defense the outnumbered Germans evacuated the city, which the French occupied without crossing the river Saar. Lebœuf had been warned by his chief Intendant, Charles Joseph Francois Wolff, not to cross the Saar because they would be unable to supply men on the further bank. Therefore, the armies of France, led by Field Marshal Bazaine. took up defensive positions that would protect against every possible attack, but which also left their armies unable to support one another.\n\nMoltke assembled his forces into two wings. On the right, 2nd Army. with 134,000 men under Prussian Crown Prince Frederick Charles containing the III, IV, IX, X, XII Corps, and the Prussian Guard, advanced towards Saarbrücken. The 1st Army's 60,000 men under General Steinmetz, consisting of the I, VII and VIII Corps, was moving in line with 2nd Army from the lower Moselle river towards Saarlouis.\n\nThe Germans crossed the frontier on 4 August 1870. They encountered lively opposition before the walls of Wissembourg. which they subdued by bringing up artillery, \nThis battle had not been planned by Moltke, who wished to keep Bazaine's army along the Saar river until he could attack it with the 2nd army in front and 1st army on its left flank, while 3rd army was closing towards its rear. However, General von Steinmetz disobeyed and made an overzealous, ill-considered move, leading 1st army south from his position on the Moselle straight toward the town of Spicheren, in the process cutting Prince Frederick Charles off from his forward cavalry units. The 1st Army advance guard, the (14th Division, VII Corps) under General Georg von Kameke advancing west from Saarbrücken on the morning of 6 August found the bridges still intact and seized the opportunity to occupy the high ground just beyond the town. The French II Corps under General Frossard had abandoned these heights in order to take up what he considered to be a \"position magnifique\", a fortified line between Spicheren and Forbach. Frossard distributed his corps as follows: holding the right and centre was the division of General Laveaucoupet, which was deployed along the heights, with two companies entrenched on the Rotherberg. On the French left General Charles Nicolas Vergé's division occupied Stiring and the Forbach valley. General Bataille’s division was held back in reserve around Spicheren; in all, counting the corps cavalry and artillery, some 27,000 men with 90 guns.\nWhile the French army under General MacMahon engaged the German 3rd Army at the Battle of Wörth, the German 1st Army under Steinmetz advanced west from Saarbrücken. Early on the 6th, a patrol from the German 2nd Army under Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia spotted decoy fires ahead and saw Frossard's army farther off on a plateau south of the town of Spicheren. Ignoring Moltke's instructions, both German armies attacked Frossard's French II Corps fortified line.\n\nKameke believed that Frossard's Corps was retreating: hence he would only be engaging its rear guard. He ordered an all out attack, committing the 74th and the 39th Regiments of the 27th Brigade under Gen. Bruno von François to the hill wall extending between Spicheren and Forbach.\n\nAt the beginning of the battle the French were unaware that the Germans had numerical superiority because only units of the German 2nd Army attacked. Fossard regarded the attackers as skirmishers and therefore did not request reinforcements. By the time he realized the strength of the force he was opposing, it was too late. Seriously flawed communications between Frossard and the Bazaine's headquarters slowed responses: by the time the reserves received orders to move to Spicheren German troops from the 1st and 2nd Armies had moved across the open ground to shelter at the base of the heights, arriving at one o'clock.\n\nAt the base of the hill, General François waited for reinforcements, unsure of how many French opposed him. French counter-attacks by infantry and Cuirassiers were stopped bloodily by 3 nearby Prussian batteries which despite heavy losses from French fire had deployed on Galgenberg Hill just from Rotherberg Hill. Kameke's 28th Brigade under Wilhelm von Woyna arrived in the afternoon to bring the battle back to life, but again the Prussian attacks were repulsed.\n\nThe French counter-attacked. General François was at the front encouraging the troops of the 74th Regiment which had reached the edge of Rotherberg Hill, drew his sword, ordered the bugler to sound the call to attack and led the newly arrived 9th Company of the 39th Regiment in a charge: he was killed, being struck by 5 bullets. Gen. Laveaucoupet's 40th Regiment pushed back François's badly demoralized, survivors while Gen. Charles Vergé's 2nd Brigade pushed back Woyna's troops.\n\nBy this time, General Constantin von Alvensleben, commander of the III Corps of the Prussian 2nd Army had come to the aid of his compatriots and the Prince had taken overall command. Drawn by the sound of battle, more and more Prussian troops appeared on the battlefield. Alvensleben decided to attack Frossard's left flank.\n\nAfter 5pm the tide of battle turned again, as General Battaile's 2nd Division attacked with 15 battalions near Stiring and Spicheren, breaking the Prussian lines and pushing them back almost to Saarbrücken. If Frossard had continued these counter-attacks he might have won the battle: but because reserves had not arrived, Frossard waited and reinforced his left flank, believing that he was in grave danger of being outflanked because German soldiers under General Adolf von Glümer were spotted in Forbach. MacMahon ordered the French to retreat because they could not obtain reinforcements or ammunition by rail because the Germans had cut the line. Frossard stopped his successful attack and around 7pm wired headquarters that he would have to retreat back to the heights to avoid being outflanked. They were pressed by a combination of overlapping infantry and artillery attacks. Frossard's troops started an orderly retreat from Rotherberg Hill and Stiring, though by some reports some fled in panic, with 3,000 arriving in Strasburg without arms. During the retreat most of Marshal MacMahon's staff were killed. The French rear guard resisted strongly so there was bloody house to house fighting in Forbach and Stiring. Alvensleben's infantry charge with more than 5000 men overran the French rear guard at dusk, thus gaining control of the Rotherberg Hill. Instead of continuing to defend the heights, Frossard retreated in an orderly fashion to the south. By 9 o'clock, the Prussians occupied the entire Spicheren plateau. They celebrated with a salute of one hundred and one guns. \n\nThe German infantry was exhausted and needed to rest and re-group, so even though fresh cavalry units were available the retreating French were allowed to slip away.\n\nThe Prussian casualties were 4,871, due to attacking and the effectiveness of the French chassepot rifle. French losses were 4,078. In the morning when they had found out that their efforts were not in vain: Frossard had abandoned his position on the heights and had ordered a retreat towards Moselle where he planned to withdraw and move to the fortress of Verdun, en route he was reinforced by Bazaine's division. They were again attacked by Steinmetz at the Battle of Borny-Colombey. \n\nFrance had lost another battle; the quality of its military commanders and their lack of initiative mainly to blame. The German casualties were relatively high due to lack of planning and the effectiveness of the French chassepot rifle.\n\nThere are numerous memorials on the plateau of Rotherberg Hill and at the various military cemeteries in Spicheren, many of them German, and at the Forest Cemetery and the German-French-Garden in Saarbrücken, commemorating the fallen soldiers or officers of the individual formations, as well as a big memorial for the fallen French. Many of these memorials became a theme for postcards in the decades after the battle. There is a trail named after General François which passes the memorials on the Spicheren heights.\n\nIn the 21st century, groups from France and Germany regularly collaborate to re-enact the battle.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1807924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807924", "title": "Cessna 177 Cardinal", "text": "Cessna 177 Cardinal\n\nThe Cessna 177 Cardinal is a light single-engine, high-wing general aviation aircraft that was intended to replace Cessna's 172 Skyhawk. First announced in 1967, it was produced from 1968 to 1978.\n\nThe Cessna 177 was designed in the mid-1960s when the engineers at Cessna were asked to create a \"futuristic 1970s successor to the Cessna 172\". The resulting aircraft featured newer technology such as a cantilever wing lacking the lift struts of previous models, and a new laminar flow airfoil. The 177 is the only production high-wing single-engined Cessna since the Cessna 190 & 195 series to have both fixed landing gear and a cantilever wing without strut bracing.\n\nIn 1971, Cessna experimented with a \"Quiet Cardinal\" similar to the Beechcraft QU-22 Pave Eagle. A test model was flown with a Wankel engine with a large three bladed 100 inch diameter propeller with a belt driven gear reduction unit and a fuselage-length exhaust canted upward.\nThe 1968 model 177 was introduced in late 1967 with a 150 hp (112 kW) engine. One of the design goals of this 172 replacement was to allow the pilot an unobstructed view when making a turn. In the 172 the pilot sits under the wing and when the wing is lowered to begin a turn that wing blocks the pilot's view of where the turn will lead to. The engineers resolved this problem by placing the pilot forward of the wing's leading edge, but that led to a too-far-forward center of gravity.\n\nThis problem was partially counteracted by the decision to use the significantly lighter Lycoming O-320 four-cylinder engine in place of the six-cylinder O-300 Continental used on the 172. The forward CG situation still existed even with the lighter engine, so a stabilator was chosen, to provide sufficient elevator control authority at low airspeeds.\n\nThe 177 design was intended to be a replacement for the 172, which was to be discontinued after introduction of the new aircraft. The new design was originally to be called the 172J (to follow the 1968 model 172I). However, as the time came to make the transition, there was considerable resistance to the replacement of the 172 from the company's Marketing Division. The 1969 172 jumped to the designator 172K—there is no 172J.\n\nThe 177 offers much better upward visibility than a 172 because of its steeply raked windshield and more aft-mounted wing. The absence of an obstructing wing support strut also makes the aircraft an excellent platform for aerial photography.\n\nSoon after delivery of the first Cardinals to customers there were reported incidents of pilot-induced oscillation (PIO) that alarmed Cessna enough that the factory initiated a priority program to eliminate the problem. Reviewer Joe Christy explains:\n\nThe solution, which was provided to all aircraft already delivered at no cost, was known as Operation \"Cardinal Rule\" and included a series of 23 inspection, installation, and modification instructions. This Service Letter, SE68-14, consisted of modifying the stabilator to install slots just behind the leading edge (to delay the onset of stabilator stall) and installing full counterbalance (11 pounds versus the original 7 pounds) on the stabilator to eliminate the PIO problem.\nThe 177, with its 150 hp (112 kW) powerplant, was considered \"underpowered\", even though it had more power than the 145 hp (108 kW) Cessna 172.\n\nRecognizing that the aircraft was underpowered, Cessna introduced the 177A in 1969. The revision featured a 180 hp (135 kW) four-cylinder Lycoming O-360, moving the design's price and role somewhere between that of the 172 and 182. The additional power improved cruise speed by 11 knots (20 km/h). \n1970 saw the introduction of the 177B, which had a new wing airfoil, a constant-speed propeller, and other minor improvements. When empty, the 177B weighed 145 lb (66 kg) more than the earlier 177, with its maximum takeoff weight increased from 2,350 lb (1,067 kg) to 2,500 lb (1,135 kg).\n\nIn 1978, Cessna built a deluxe version of the 177B, the Cardinal Classic, with leather upholstery, a table for the rear passengers, and a 28-Volt electrical system.\n\nThe final aircraft in the 177 line was the retractable-gear 177RG Cardinal RG, which Cessna began producing in 1971 as a direct competitor to the Piper PA-28R-200 Cherokee Arrow and Beechcraft Sierra. The nose gear folds rearward; when opened the gear door formed a small air brake behind the propeller.\n\nTo offset the increase in empty weight, much of which was from the electrically powered hydraulic gear mechanism, the 177RG had a Lycoming IO-360 engine. This also allowed increase of the maximum weight by 300 lbs.\n\nThe additional power and cleaner lines of the 177RG resulted in a cruise speed of , faster than the 177B. 1,543 177RGs were delivered between the US and Reims, Cessna's licensed partner in France. Those built in France by Reims were referred to as the Reims F177RG.\n\n"}

It was designed for, and promoted as working with wireless mesh networks.\n\nOON's designers say it can handle thousands of nodes, where most other protocols handle less than a hundred. OON uses hierarchical algorithms to minimize the total amount of transmissions needed for routing. Routing overhead is limited to between 1% to 5% of node to node bandwidth in any network and does not grow as the network size grows.\n\nThe basic idea is that a network organizes itself into a tree. Nodes meet at the root of the tree to establish an initial route. The route then moves away from the root by cutting corners, as ant-trails do. When there are no more corners to cut, a nearly optimum route exists. This route is continuously maintained. \n\nEach process can be performed with localized minimal communication, and very small router tables. OORP requires about 200K of memory. A simulated network with 500 nodes transmitting at 200 bytes/second organized itself in about 20 seconds.\n\nAs of 2004, OORP was patented or had other significant intellectual property restrictions. See the link below.\n\nEach computer, or \"node\" of the network has a unique name, at least one network link, and a computer with some capacity to hold a list of neighbors.\n\nThe network nodes form a hierarchy by having each node select a parent. The parent is a neighbor node that is the next best step to the most other nodes. This method creates a hierarchy around nodes that are more likely to be present, and which have more capacity, and which are closer to the topological center of the network. The memory limitations of a small node are reflected in its small routing table, which automatically prevents it from being a preferred central node.\n\nAt the top, one or two nodes are unable to find nodes better-connected than themselves, and therefore become parents of the entire network.\n\nThe hierarchy-formation algorithm does not need a complex routing algorithm or large amounts of communication.\n\nAll nodes push a route to themselves to the root of the tree. A node wanting a connection can therefore push a request to the root of the tree, and always find a route.\n\nThe commercial protocol uses Dijkstra's algorithm to continuously optimize and maintain the route. As the network moves and changes, the path is continually adjusted. \n\nAssuming that some nodes in the network have enough memory to know of all nodes in the network, there is no practical limitation to network size.\n\nSince the control bandwidth is defined to be less than 5% regardless of network size, the amount of control bandwidth required is not supposed to increase as network size grows.\n\nThe system can use nodes with small amounts of memory.\n\nThe network has a reliable, low-overhead way to establish that a node is not in the network. This is a difficult, valuable property in \"ad hoc\" mesh networks.\n\nMost routing protocols scale either by reducing proactive link-state routing information or reactively driving routing by connection requests. OORP mixes the proactive and reactive methods. Properly configured, an OORP net can scale to 100,000's of nodes and can often achieve reasonable performance even though it limits routing bandwidth to 5%.\n\nCentral nodes have an extra burden because they need to have enough memory to store information about all nodes in the network. At some number of nodes, the network will therefore cease to scale.\n\nIf all the nodes in the network are low capacity nodes the network may be overwhelmed with change. This may limit the maximum scale. However, In virtually all real world networks, the farther away from the edge nodes the more the bandwidth grows.\n\nThese critiques may have no practical effect. For example, consider a low bandwidth 9.6Kbit/second radio. If the protocol was configured to send one packet of 180 bytes every 5 seconds, it would consume 3% of overall network bandwidth. \n\nPublic proposals for OON do not include security or authentication. Security and authentication may provided by the Integrator of the protocol. Typical security measures include encryption or signing or the protocol packets and incrementing counters to prevent replay attacks.\n\n\n"}

It is the largest such entity in Wales, with an electorate of 75,175 and one of the most ethnically diverse.\n\nPrior to 1983 Penarth had been part of the abolished Barry constituency, represented by the Conservative backbencher Sir Raymond Gower. Most of the electorate of the new constituency had previously fallen into the abolished seat of Cardiff South East, represented by former Prime Minister, James Callaghan.\n\nIts boundaries remained unchanged until the 2010 redistribution, when Sully was added to this constituency from the Vale of Glamorgan seat.\n\nCardiff South and Penarth has had three MPs since its creation, containing some very Labour-inclined wards from Cardiff such as Butetown, Grangetown and Splott, and several wards from the neighbouring borough of the Vale of Glamorgan, with Penarth mostly favourable to Labour, but some decent Conservative areas as Plymouth and Sully in the southern end of the seat. The first, elected at the 1983 general election, was the former Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan, who secured the seat with a 5.5% majority over Conservative David Tredinnick. Callaghan had immediately prior to the dissolution of Parliament, represented Cardiff South East. Callaghan first became an MP at the 1945 general election, for \"Cardiff South\".\n\nThe second MP was Alun Michael (Labour and Co-operative Party) who served 25 years from 1987 before choosing to stand down in 2012. Michael's affiliation with the Co-operative Party did not appear on ballot papers at the 2010 general election because the Electoral Commission ruled that any joint candidates who wanted the names of both their parties included on the ballot paper could not also display the Labour red rose logo. Michael opted to drop the reference to the Co-operative Party but after the election denounced the ruling as \"an outrageous piece of incompetence by the Electoral Commission\". Michael briefly became Secretary of State for Wales in 1998. Michael held the seat at the 2010 general election with a majority of 10.6% following a 6% swing to the Conservative candidate.\n\nIn 2012, Michael was selected by the Labour and Co-operative Parties as their candidate for the election of a Police and Crime Commissioner for the South Wales Police force area and announced he would be standing down from Parliament.\n\nAt a by-election held on 15 November 2012, Labour's decline was reversed coupled with very low turnout (down 38.2% on the previous election). Labour's Stephen Doughty succeeded Alun Michael winning 47.3% of the overall vote. This was an increase (in share-of-the-vote terms) on Michael's 2010 performance. However, in terms of actual votes cast (9,193 compared with 17,262 in 2010), it was Labour's lowest in this constituency. The 2015 result gave the seat the 83rd-smallest majority of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority. Labour's result in 2017 saw them secure their largest ever margin in the constituency in terms of raw votes.\n\nFive parties' candidates achieved more than deposit-retaining threshold of 5% of the vote in 2015. The second-placed candidate has been a Conservative since the seat was incepted. The closest result was in 1983, when Callaghan won by 5.5% of the vote.\n\nTurnout at general elections has ranged between 77.2% in 1992 and 56.2% in 2005.\n\n1983–2010: The City of Cardiff wards of Butetown, Grangetown, Llanrumney, Rumney, Splott, and Trowbridge, and the Borough of Vale of Glamorgan wards of Alexandra (became Plymouth and St Augustine's from 2004), Cornerswell, Llandough, and Stanwell.\n\n2010–present: The Cardiff electoral divisions of Butetown, Grangetown, Llanrumney, Rumney, Splott, and Trowbridge, and the Vale of Glamorgan County Borough electoral divisions of Cornerswell, Llandough, Plymouth, St Augustine's, Stanwell, and Sully.\n\nOf the 160 rejected ballots:\n\nOf the 107 rejected ballots:\n\nOf the 121 rejected ballots:\n\nOf the 135 rejected ballots:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lateral line gradually curving down from the upper end of the gill cover toward caudal peduncle. The first (spiny) dorsal fin is black at the front. Posterior membranes are white with a black edge. Its single row of cutting edged teeth in each jaw (around sixty-four teeth in all) are large, uniform, closely spaced and flattened from side to side. As with the King mackerel and the Cero mackerel, these teeth look very similar to those of the Bluefish, \"Pomatomus saltatrix\".\n\nSpanish mackerel occur seasonally from the Yucatán peninsula, Mexico, as far north as Cape Cod, Massachusetts. They are a shallow water species, preferring sand bottom in depths of , occasionally found as deep as .\n\nIt appears that one Atlantic and one or more Gulf groups of Spanish mackerel occur in Florida waters. With rising water temperatures, the Atlantic group migrates along the Atlantic coast of the United States from Miami Florida, beginning in late February through July reaching as far as southern Cape Cod, Massachusetts, then returning in fall. An Eastern Gulf group moves northward from the Florida Keys during late winter and spring, appearing off the central West Coast of Florida about April 1. Movement continues westward and terminates along the northern Texas coast. During fall, this group migrates back to its wintering grounds in the Keys.\n\nThe Gulf group of Spanish mackerel spawn in batches from May to September off shore of Texas, off the Gulf shore of Florida as early as April in some years. The Atlantic group spawns starting in April off the Carolinas and from late August to late September in the northernmost part of its range. Spanish mackerel mature by age-1 at a fork length (FL) of . Females live longer and grow to larger sizes than males. Females may live as long as 11 years, growing to and FL. Males reach about age-6 and FL.\n\nSpanish mackerel are carnivores. As with other members of the genus, food consists mainly of small fishes with lesser quantities of shrimp and squid. Striped anchovies (\"Engraulidae\") and clupeoids such as menhaden, alewives and thread herring (\"Opisthonema\"), are particularly important forage in North Carolina, Florida, Texas, and Veracruz. The percentage of anchovies consumed is higher for juveniles than for adults.\n\nSpanish mackerel are a highly valued fish throughout their range from North Carolina to Texas. Recreational anglers catch Spanish mackerel from boats while trolling or drifting and from boats, piers, jetties, and beaches by casting spoons and jigs and live-bait fishing. Fast lure retrieves are key to catching these quick fish. Commercial methods are primarily run-around gill netting, and rarely, by trolling lures similar to those used by recreational anglers.\n\nOn November 4, 1987, Woody Outlaw caught a world-record 13 pound Spanish mackerel on a blue and white Sea Witch with a strip of fastback menhaden on a 7/0 hook, held by a Shimano bait-casting reel on a Kuna rod with 30-pound test line.\n\nSpanish mackerel are managed in commercial and recreation fisheries with bag limits, size limits, commercial trip limits, and with only seasonal fishing allowed. The management of mackerel has been considered a success because the population used to be in decline, but is now on the rise without overfishing occurring.\n\nSpanish mackerel are primarily marketed fresh or frozen as fillets as commercially caught fish are too small to sell in the form of steaks. Their raw flesh is white. They may be prepared by broiling, frying, baking or, rarely, by smoking.\n\nThe Spanish mackerel is also a popular sushi fish. By analogy with the Japanese Spanish mackerel, which is a member of the same genus, it is often called \"sawara\" on sushi menus.\n\nSpanish mackerel are similar in appearance to small King mackerel (\"Scomberomorus cavalla\") and Cero mackerel (\"Scomberomorus regalis\"). All three are very similar in shape and coloration. They may be distinguished as follows:\n\nThe lateral line on Spanish and Cero mackerel slopes gradually from the top edge of the gill to the tail. In contrast that of the king mackerel takes an abrupt drop at mid-body.\n\nThe first (spiny) dorsal on Spanish and Cero mackerel has a prominent black patch. The King mackerel has none. As all three species normally keep the first dorsal folded back in a body groove, this difference is not immediately evident.\n\nSpanish mackerel have prominent yellow spots on the flanks at all sizes. In addition to such spots, Cero mackerel have one or more yellow stripes along the centerline. Young King mackerel have similar, but slightly smaller spots; these fade away on individuals weighing over , but they may still be seen as spots of slightly darker green on the upper back from some angles of view.\n\nWorldwide, there are many members of this genus quite similar to one or another of these three species. In particular, off Mexico, Atlantic Spanish mackerel may be confused with Serra Spanish mackerel \"(Scomberomorus brasiliensis)\" which may appear in the same area.\n\n"}

The club's home stadium is the Estádio Giulite Coutinho, which has a capacity of 16,000. They play in red shirts, white shorts and red socks.\n\nThe football anthem composer Lamartine Babo was a supporter of America. America's mascot is a devil.

In 1905, America, together with Bangu, Botafogo, Petrópolis, Fluminense and Futebol Atlético Clube founded Liga de Football do Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro Football League), which was the first football federation of Rio de Janeiro. In 1913, the club won the state championship for the first time.\n\nFor the 1971 season, the club competed in the national Championship's first edition, finishing in 11th place.\n\nThe yellow star just above their emblem represents their win in the Tournament of the Champions (Torneio dos Campeões) in 1982, which was a tournament organized by CBF to serve as a preview to the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A tournament.

The club's old stadium was nicknamed \"Caldeirão do Diabo\" (\"Devil's Cauldron\"). In 2006 some of the club's fans, supported by then-manager Jorginho who is an Evangelical Christian, attempted to replace the diabo with a bald eagle, claiming that the devil was \"unlucky\". However, as the \"diabo\" is a traditional part of the club's story and with the original mascot the club conquered its greatest achievements and there was no change in the club's fortunes with the new mascot, the replacement was abandoned and it was considered that Jorginho's opinion was motivated by \"religious fanaticism\".\n\nAmerica is the Brazilian club with the largest number of other clubs named after it, who copy even its symbols.

It returned one Member of Parliament (MP) by the single-member district plurality (also known as first-past-the-post) system of voting.\n\nThe constituency was created for the 1950 general election, and abolished for the 2010 general election.\n\nIt was a marginal between the Conservative Party and the Labour Party throughout its existence.\n\nThe Conwy Welsh Assembly constituency was created with the same boundaries as the Conwy House of Commons constituency in 1999.\n\nThe constituency was, geographically, relatively small for its region, as it followed and tended to keep to the coast, taking in parts of two separate densely populated coastal conurbations.\n\nAs well as the walled castle town of Conwy from which it bore its name, the constituency mainly comprised the popular holiday resort and retail centre of Llandudno to the east, and the city of Bangor, which is home to the University of Wales, Bangor, to the west. It also included the smaller coastal towns of Penmaenmawr and Llanfairfechan, as well as some sparser inland areas including former slate-quarrying communities in the Ogwen Valley.\nThe constituency, notably, did \"not\" include Colwyn Bay (or outlying Rhos-on-Sea), which forms part of a coastal conurbation (and the Conwy county borough) with Llandudno and its outlying town of Penrhyn Bay—both in the constituency; this area comes under the constituency of Clwyd West to the east. Nor did it include the town of Caernarfon—just southwest of Bangor—which was in a constituency of the same name.\n\nThe constituency was also bordered by Meirionnydd Nant Conwy to the south, and the insular constituency of Ynys Mon to the west.\n\nFollowing the decisions of the Welsh Boundary Commission, the Conwy seat was significantly altered, forming the base of a new Aberconwy constituency established for the 2010 general election. Part of the constituency (notably Bangor) became part of the new Arfon constituency.\n\nAlthough the constituency included a student population from the university, most of the voters were towards the older end of the age spectrum as it was a popular retirement area. The constituency was also linguistically diverse, with mainly English speakers in the east and mainly Welsh speakers in the west and inland areas.\n\nThe last MP was Betty Williams of the Labour Party, who held the seat from 1997 (when she gained 35.04% of the vote—a 9.4% swing from the Conservatives) until its abolition in 2010. Williams increased her share of the vote in 2001 (by 6.8%), but it was reduced in 2005 (by 4.7%). She is also the first female MP to hold the seat. The seat was previously held (since its renaming in 1983) by Sir Wyn Roberts for the Conservative Party, who was first elected for Conway, the old anglicised name of the constituency, in 1970.\n\nIn the 2005 general election, the seat was the 81st easiest seat for the Liberal Democrats to gain, and the 153rd easiest seat for the Conservative Party to gain. The Labour Party did not include the seat on its list of vulnerable seats and eventually held the seat (with a reduced proportion of the vote).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1807953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807953", "title": "Esperanto vocabulary", "text": "Esperanto vocabulary\n\nThe word base of Esperanto was originally defined in \"Unua Libro\" (\"First Book\"), published by L. L. Zamenhof in 1887. It contained around 900 root words. The rules of the language allow speakers to borrow words as needed, recommending only that they look for the most international words, and that they borrow one basic word and derive others from it, rather than borrowing many words with related meanings. In 1894, Zamenhof published the first Esperanto dictionary, \"Universala vortaro\", which was written in five languages and supplied a larger set of root words.\n\nSince then, many words have been borrowed from other languages, primarily those of Western Europe. In recent decades, most of the new borrowings or coinages have been technical or scientific terms; terms in everyday use are more likely to be derived from existing words (for example \"komputilo\" [a computer], from \"komputi\" [to compute]), or extending them to cover new meanings (for example \"muso\" [a mouse], now also signifies a computer input device, as in English). There are frequent debates among Esperanto speakers about whether a particular borrowing is justified or whether the need can be met by derivation or extending the meaning of existing words.\n\nEsperanto occupies a middle ground between \"naturalistic\" constructed languages such as Interlingua, which take words \"en masse\" from their source languages with little internal derivation, and \"a priori\" conlangs such as Solresol, in which the words have no historical connection to other languages. In Esperanto, root words are borrowed and retain much of the form of their source language, whether the phonetic form (\"eks-\" from \"ex-\") or orthographic form (\"teamo\" from \"team\"). However, each root can then form dozens of derivations that may bear little resemblance to equivalent words in the source languages, such as \"registaro\" (government), which is derived from the Latinate root \"reg\" (to rule).\n\nOne of the ways Zamenhof made Esperanto easier to learn than ethnic languages was by creating a regular and highly productive derivational morphology. Through the judicious use of lexical affixes (prefixes suffixes), the core vocabulary needed for communication was greatly reduced, making Esperanto a more agglutinative language than most European languages. It has been estimated that on average one root in Esperanto is the communicative equivalent of ten words in English.\n\nHowever, a contrary tendency is apparent in cultured and Greco-Latin technical vocabulary, which most Europeans see as \"international\" and therefore take into Esperanto \"en masse\", despite the fact they are not truly universal. Many Asians consider this to be an onerous and unnecessary burden on the memory, when it is so easy to derive equivalent words internally (for example by calquing them, which is what Chinese often does). This sparks frequent debates as to whether a particular root is justified, and sometimes results in duplicates of native and borrowed vocabulary. An example is \"calligraphy\", which occurs both as a calqued \"belskribo\" (\"writing of beauty\") and as the direct borrowing \"kaligrafio\". A similar development has also occurred in English (\"brotherly\" vs. \"fraternal\"), German (\"Ornithologie\" vs. \"Vogelkunde\" for \"ornithology\"), Japanese (\"beesubooru\" vs. \"yakyuu\" for \"baseball\"), Spanish (\"básquetbol\" vs. \"baloncesto\" for \"basketball\"), French (\"le week-end\" vs. \"la fin de semaine\"), and other languages. However, although the debates in ethnic languages are motivated by nationalism or issues of cultural identity, in Esperanto the debates are largely motivated by differing views on how to make the language practical and accessible.\n\nOne of the most immediately useful derivational affixes for the beginner is the prefix \"mal-\", which derives antonyms: \"peza\" (heavy), \"malpeza\" (light); \"supren\" (upwards), \"malsupren\" (downwards); \"ami\" (to love), \"malami\" (to hate); \"lumo\" (light), \"mallumo\" (darkness). However, except in jokes, this prefix is not used when an antonym exists in the basic vocabulary: \"suda\" (south), not \"malnorda\" from 'north'; \"manki\" (to be lacking, intr.), not \"malesti\" from 'to be'.\n\nThe creation of new words through the use of grammatical (i.e. inflectional) suffixes, such as \"nura\" (mere) from \"nur\" (only), \"tiama\" (contemporary) from \"tiam\" (then), or \"vido\" (sight) from \"vidi\" (to see), is covered in the article on Esperanto grammar. What follows is a list of what are usually called \"affixes\". Most of them, however, are actually lexical roots, in that they can be used as independent words and their relative order in a compound is determined by semantics, not grammar. They are called \"affixes\" mainly because they derive from affixes in Esperanto's source languages. Some are true affixes in that, although they may be used independently, their order within a word is fixed by the grammar. Only a few cannot be used independently and so correspond to how a typical affix behaves in English.\n\nWhen a root receives more than one affix, their order matters, because affixes modify the entire stem they are attached to. That is, the outer ones modify the inner ones. Most affixes are themselves roots, and as such have an inherent part of speech. This is indicated by the final part-of-speech vowel in the suffix list below. A few affixes do not affect the part of speech of the root; for the suffixes listed in the tables below, this is indicated by a hyphen in place of the final vowel.\n\nThere are, in addition, affixes not listed here: technical affixes, such as the biological family suffix \"-edo\" seen in \"numidedo\" (Guineafowls), and a few taken from Ido, such as \"-oza\" (full of) in \"montoza\" (mountainous), \"muskoloza\" (muscular), \"poroza\" (porous). A proposed suffix \"-ala\" makes adjectives out of nouns made from adjectives: \"varmala\" (caloric, from \"varma\" warm), \"ŝtataligi\" (nationalize).\n\nLexical (i.e. derivational) affixes may act as roots by taking one of the grammatical suffixes: \"mala\" (opposite), \"eta\" (slight), \"ano\" (a member), \"umo\" (a doohickey), \"eble\" (possibly), \"iĝi\" (to become), \"ero\" (a bit, a crumb). Also, through compounding, lexical roots may act as affixes: \"vidi\" (to see), \"povi\" (to be able to), \"vidpova\" (able to see, not blind); \"ĉefo\" (head, chief), \"urbo\" (a city), \"ĉefurbo\" (a capital). It is quite common for prepositions to be used as prefixes: \"alveni\" (to arrive), from \"al\" (to) and \"veni\" (come); \"senespera\" (hopeless), from \"sen\" (without) and \"espero\" (hope); \"pripensi\" (to consider), from \"pri\" (about) and \"pensi\" (to think); \"vendi pogrande\" (sell wholesale), from \"po\" (at the rate of) and \"grande\" (large [quantity]), etc. There is even \"aliĝilo\" (registration form), from the preposition \"al\" (to) and the suffixes \"-iĝ-\" (to become) and \"-ilo\" (an instrument).\n\nCompound words in Esperanto are similar to English, in that the final root is basic to the meaning. The roots may be joined together directly, or with an epenthetic (linking) vowel to aid pronunciation. This epenthetic vowel is most commonly the nominal suffix \"-o-\", used regardless of number or case, but other grammatical suffixes may be used when the inherent part of speech of the first root of the compound needs to be changed.\n\nPrepositions are frequently found in compounds, and behave much like prefixes,\n\nSince affixes may be used as root words, and roots may combine like affixes, the boundary between the two is blurred. Indeed, many so-called affixes are indistinguishable from other roots. However, \"true\" affixes are grammatically fixed as being either prefixes or suffixes, whereas the order of roots in compounds is determined by semantics.\n\nAlthough Zamenhof did not prescribe rules for which consonant sequences are not acceptable and therefore when the epenthetic \"-o-\" is required, he generally omitted it when the result was a sequence of two consonants, as in \"velŝipo\" above. However, he inserted an \"-o-\",\n\nReduplication is only marginally used in Esperanto. It has an intensifying effect similar to that of the suffix \"-eg-\". The common examples are \"plenplena\" (chock-full), from \"plena\" (full), \"finfine\" (finally, at last), from \"fina\" (final), and \"fojfoje\" (once in a while), from \"foje\" (once, sometimes). So far, reduplication has only been used with monosyllabic roots that don't require an epenthetic vowel when compounded.\n\nAffixes may be used in novel ways, creating new words that don't exist in any national language. Sometimes the results are poetic: In one Esperanto novel, a man opens an old book with a broken spine, and the yellowed pages \"disliberiĝas\" [from the root \"libera\" (free) and the affixes \"dis-\" and \"-iĝ-\"]. There is no equivalent way to express this in English, but it creates a very strong visual image of the pages escaping the book and scattering over the floor. More importantly, the word is comprehensible the first time one hears it.\n\nDerivation by affix greatly expands a speaker's vocabulary, sometimes beyond what they know in their native language. For instance, the English word \"ommatidium\" (a single lens of a compound eye) is rather obscure, but a child would be able to coin an Esperanto equivalent, \"okulero\", from \"okulo\" 'an eye' (or perhaps, more precisely, \"okularero\", by first coining \"okularo\" for 'a compound eye'). In this way the Esperanto root \"vid-\" (see) regularly corresponds to some two dozen English words: \"see (saw, seen), sight, blind, vision, visual, visible, nonvisual, invisible, unsightly, glance, view, vista, panorama, observant\" etc., though there are also separate Esperanto roots for some of these concepts.\n\nIn the \"Fundamento\", Zamenhof illustrated word formation by deriving the equivalents of \"recuperate, disease, hospital, germ, patient, doctor, medicine, pharmacy\", etc. from \"sana\" (healthy). Not all of the resulting words translate well into English, in many cases because they distinguish fine shades of meaning that English lacks: \"Sano\", \"sana\", \"sane\", \"sani\", \"sanu\", \"saniga\", \"saneco\", \"sanilo\", \"sanigi\", \"saniĝi\", \"sanejo\", \"sanisto\", \"sanulo\", \"malsano\", \"malsana\", \"malsane\", \"malsani\", \"malsanulo\", \"malsaniga\", \"malsaniĝi\", \"malsaneta\", \"malsanema\", \"malsanulejo\", \"malsanulisto\", \"malsanero\", \"malsaneraro\", \"sanigebla\", \"sanigisto\", \"sanigilo\", \"resanigi\", \"resaniĝanto\", \"sanigilejo\", \"sanigejo\", \"malsanemulo\", \"sanilaro\", \"malsanaro\", \"malsanulido\", \"nesana\", \"malsanado\", \"sanulaĵo\", \"malsaneco\", \"malsanemeco\", \"saniginda\", \"sanilujo\", \"sanigilujo\", \"remalsano\", \"remalsaniĝo\", \"malsanulino\", \"sanigista\", \"sanigilista\", \"sanilista\", \"malsanulista\". Perhaps half of these words are in common use, but the others (and more) are available if needed.\n\nThe \"correlatives\" are a paradigm of pro-forms, used to ask and answer the questions \"what, where, when, why, who, whose, how, how much\", and \"what kind\". They are constructed from set elements so that correlatives with similar meanings have similar forms: There are nine endings corresponding to the nine \"wh-\" questions, and five initial elements that perform the functions of asking, answering, denying, being inclusive, and being indefinite about these nine questions. For example, the words \"kiam\" (when) and \"kiu\" (who, which), with the initial \"ki-\" of questions, \"ask\" about time and individuals, whereas the words \"tiam\" (then) and \"tiu\" (this/that one), with the same endings but the initial \"ti-\" of demonstratives, \"answer\" those questions, and the words \"neniam\" (never) and \"neniu\" (no-one) deny those questions. Thus by learning these 14 elements the speaker acquires a paradigm of 45 adverbs and pronouns.\n\nThe correlatives beginning with \"ti-\" correspond to the English demonstratives in \"th- (this, thus, then, there\" etc.), whereas \"ĉi-\" corresponds to \"every-\" and \"i-\" to \"some-\". The correlatives beginning with \"ki-\" have a double function, as interrogative and relative pronouns and adverbs, just as the \"wh-\" words do in English: \"Kiu ĉevalo?\" (Which horse?); \"La ĉevalo, kiu forkuris\" (The horse that ran away).\n\nThe adjectival determiners ending in \"-u\" have the usual dual function of adjectives: standing alone as proforms, as in \"ĉiu\" (everyone); and modifying a noun, as in \"ĉiu tago\" (every day). Those ending in \"-io\" are exclusively used standing alone: \"ĉio\" (everything).\n\nThe correlatives have a genitive case ending in \"-es\". Therefore, the adjectival correlatives, ending in \"-ia\" and \"-iu\", do not play that role, as adjectival personal pronouns such as \"mia\" \"my\" do. However, adjectival correlatives do agree in number and case with the nouns they modify, as any other adjectives: \"La ĉevaloj, kiujn mi vidis\" (The horses which I saw). They, as well as the independent determiners ending in \"-io\", also take the accusative case when standing in for the object of a clause. The accusative of motion is used with the place correlatives in \"-ie\", forming \"-ien\" (hither, whither, thither, etc.).\n\nSeveral adverbial particles are used primarily with the correlatives: \"ajn\" indicates generality, \"ĉi\" proximity, and \"for\" distance. (Without these particles, demonstratives such as \"tiu\" and \"tio\" are not specific about distance, though they are usually translated as \"that\".)\n\nSometimes the correlative system is extended to the root \"ali-\" (other), at least when the resulting word is unambiguous,\n\"Alie\", however, would be ambiguous as to whether the original meaning \"otherwise\" or the correlative \"elsewhere\" were intended, so \"aliloke\" (from \"loko\" \"place\") is used for \"elsewhere\".\n\nAs a practical matter, only \"aliel\" and \"alies\" are seen with any frequency, and even they are condemned by many speakers.\n\nExamples of the interrogative versus relative uses of the \"ki-\" words:\n\nAlso,\n\nNote that standard Esperanto punctuation puts a comma before the relative word (a correlative in \"ki-\" or the conjunction \"ke\", \"that\"), a feature common to many Slavic languages.\n\nVarious parts of speech may be derived from the correlatives, just as from any other roots: \"ĉiama\" (eternal), \"ĉiea\" (ubiquitous), \"tiama\" (contemporary), \"kialo\" (a reason), \"iomete\" (a little bit), \"kioma etaĝo?\" (which floor?) [This last requests an ordinal answer of how many floors up, like \"la dek-sesa\" (the 16th), rather than asking someone to simply point out which floor, which would be asked with \"kiu etaĝo?\". The same form is used for asking time: \"Kioma horo estas?\", literally \"How-manyeth hour is it?\"]\n\nAlthough the initial and final elements of the correlatives are not roots or affixes, in that they cannot normally be independently combined with other words (for instance, there is no genitive case in \"-es\" for nouns), the initial element of the \"neni-\" correlatives is an exception, as seen in \"neniulo\" (a nobody), from \"neni-\" plus \"-ulo\", or \"neniigi\", to nullify or destroy, from \"neni-\" plus the causative \"-ig\".\n\nUsually, feminine nouns are derived from epicene (genderless) roots via the suffix \"-ino\". A relatively small number of Esperanto roots are semantically masculine or feminine. In some but not all cases, masculine roots also have feminine derivatives via \"-ino\". Usage is consistent for only a few dozen words. For others, people may differ in usage, or it may be difficult to tell whether a word is gendered because of social custom or because of the word itself.\n\nA small (and decreasing) number of noun roots, mostly titles and kinship terms, are inherently masculine unless the feminine suffix \"-ino\" or the inclusive prefix \"ge-\" are added. For example, there are \"patro\" (father), \"patrino\" (mother), and \"gepatroj\" (parents), whereas there is no proper word for \"parent\" in the singular (as explained in a following section). There are other words, such as \"papo\" (pope), which are generally assumed to be masculine due to historical reality, but there is no reason a feminine form \"papino\" couldn't be used in fiction, or if customs change. \n\nIn the early twentieth century, members of a profession were assumed to be masculine unless specified otherwise with \"-ino\", reflecting the expectations of most industrial societies. That is, \"sekretario\" was a male secretary, and \"instruisto\" was a male teacher. This was the case for all words ending in \"-isto\", as well as \"-ulo (riĉulo\" \"a rich \"man\"\"), \"-ano\" and ethnicities (\"kristano\" \"a male Christian\", \"anglo\" \"an English\"man\"), -estro (urbestro\" \"a male mayor\"), and the participles \"-into, -anto, -onto, -ito, -ato, -oto (komencanto\" \"a male beginner\"). Many domestic animals were also masculine (\"bovo\" \"bull\", \"kapro\" \"billygoat\", \"koko\" \"rooster\"). These generally became gender-neutral over the course of the century, as many similar words did in English, because of social transformation.\n\nOnce such a word is used ambiguously by a significant number of speakers or writers, it can no longer be assumed to be masculine. Language guides suggest using all ambiguous words neutrally, and many people find this the least confusing approach—and so the ranks of masculine words gradually dwindle.\n\nThere is still variation in many of the above words, depending on the social expectations and language background of the speaker. Many of the words are not clearly either masculine or epicene today. For example, the plural \"bovoj\" is generally understood to mean \"cattle\", not \"bulls\", and similarly the plurals \"angloj\" (Englishpeople) and \"komencantoj\" (beginners); but a masculine meaning reappears in \"bovo kaj bovino\" \"a bull & cow\", \" kaj anglino\" (an Englishman & Englishwoman), \"komencanto kaj komencantino\" (a male & female beginner). \n\nThere are several dozen clearly masculine roots:\n\nSome of these, such as \"masklo\" and the dedicated words for male animals, are fundamentally masculine and are never used with the feminine suffix. The others remain masculine mainly because Zamenhof did not establish a way to derive masculine words the way he did for feminine words. To partially remedy this, the root \"vir\" (man) has long been used to form the masculine of animal words. Originally a suffix, since the 1926 publication of the Esperanto translation of the Bible it has shifted in use to a prefix, but either way the resulting words are ambiguous. \"Bovoviro\" \"bovine-man\" and \"virbovo\" \"man-bovine\", for example, could mean either \"minotaur\" or \"bull\", and therefore both \"taŭro\" (bull) and \"minotaŭro\" (minotaur) have been borrowed into the language to disambiguate. Adjectival usage of \"vira\" is also found, but is similarly ambiguous. More recently, the word \"maskla\" (masculine) was created as an unambiguous alternative.\n\nThere are several dozen feminine roots that do not normally take the feminine suffix \"-ino\":\n\nLike the essentially masculine roots (those that do not take the feminine suffix), feminine roots are rarely interpreted as epicene. However, many of them are feminine because of social custom or the details of their mythology, and there is nothing preventing masculine usage in fiction. Even outside of fiction, words such as \"muzo\" (muse) and \"nimfo\" (nymph) may be used metaphorically for males, and a collection of Goethe's poetry has been translated under the title \"La Muzino\" ('The [female] Muse'), with gendered metaphorical usage. Similarly, \"sireno\" is also the biological name for sea-cows (Latin \"Sirenia\"), and as such one can speak of \"sirenino\" (a female sea-cow).\n\nThe ending of all assimilated nouns in Esperanto with \"-o\", including personal names, clashes with Romance languages such as Italian and Spanish, in which \"-o\" marks masculine names, and feminine names end in \"-a\". For example, the fully Esperantized form of 'Mary' is \"Mario\", which resembles Spanish masculine \"Mario\" rather than feminine \"María\". (Though suffixed \"Mariino\" is also available, it is seldom seen.) This has resulted in some writers using a final \"-a\" for feminine names with cognates in Romance languages, such as \"Johano\" \"John\" vs. \"Johana\" \"Joanna\", rather than using the feminine suffix \"-in\" for a more fully assimilated \"Johano\" and \"Johanino\", or \"Jozefo\" \"Joseph\" and \"Jozefino\" \"Josephine\". Some writers extend this \"-a\" convention to all female names.\n\nEsperanto personal pronouns distinguish gender in the third-person singular: \"li\" (he), \"ŝi\" (she); but not in the plural: \"ili\" (they). There are two practical epicene third-person singular pronouns: expanding the use of the demonstrative pronoun \"tiu\" (that one), and Zamenhof's suggestion, \"ĝi\".\n\nSee the discussions at Esperanto personal pronouns and gender reform in Esperanto.\n\nPeople sometimes object to using the prefix \"mal-\" to derive highly frequent antonyms, especially when they are as long as \"malproksima\" (far). There are a few alternative roots in poetry, such as \"turpa\" for \"malbelega\" (very ugly) and \"pigra\" for \"mallaborema\" (lazy) – some of which originated in Ido – that find their way into prose. However, they are rarely used in conversation.\nThis is a combination of two factors: the great ease and familiarity of using the \"mal-\" prefix, and the relative obscurity of most of the alternatives, which would hamper communication. This results in English borrowings – such as \"ĉipa\" (cheap) for \"malmultekosta\" (inexpensive) – failing to find favor even among native English speakers.\n\nTwo root antonyms are frequently encountered: \"eta\" (little), and \"dura\" (hard [not soft]). However, their popularity is due to their iconicity. \"Eta\" is derived from the diminutive suffix and more properly means \"slight\", but it's a short word, and its use for \"malgranda\" (little) is quite common. The reason for the popularity of \"dura\" may be similar: perhaps official \"malmola\", with the repeated continuants \"m_l\", sounds too soft to mean \"hard\", while \"dura\" begins with a stop consonant.\nOther antonymic words tend to have a different scope. For example, instead of \"malbona\" (bad) we may see \"aĉa\" (of poor quality) or \"fia\" (shameful), but these are not strict antonyms.\n\nThe antonymic prefix is highly productive among native-speaking children.\n\nProper names may either be \nThe last method is usually used only for names or transliterations of names in Latin script. As noted under Gender, feminine personal names may take the suffix \"a\" rather than \"o\" even when fully assimilated.\n\nWhen a name ending in a vowel is fully assimilated, the vowel is often changed to inflectional \"o\", rather than the \"o\" being added to the full root. As with borrowed common nouns, this may be criticized if the vowel is part of the root rather than inflectional in the source language, because the resulting form may not be readily recognized by native speakers of the source language. However, it is a common phenomenon in inflectional languages such as Russian or Latin. If a name is not fully assimilated, the accusative case may be tacked on with a hyphen, as \"-n\" if the name ends in a vowel, or as \"-on\" if it does not (\"Zamenhof-on\").\n\nSome idiomatic expressions have either been borrowed from Esperanto's source languages, or developed naturally over the course of Esperanto's history. There are also various expletives based on body functions and religion, as in English.\n\nIn addition to the root words and the rules for combining them, a learner of Esperanto must learn some idiomatic compounds that are not entirely straightforward. For example, \"eldoni\", literally \"to give out\", means \"to publish\"; a \"vortaro\", literally \"a compilation of words\", means \"a glossary\" or \"a dictionary\"; and \"necesejo\", literally \"a place for necessities\", is a toilet. Almost all of these compounds, however, are modeled after equivalent compounds in native European languages: \"eldoni\" after the German \"herausgeben\" or Russian \"издавать\", and \"vortaro\" from the Russian \"словарь\" \"slovar’\".\n\n\"Saluton\" (hello) is sometimes clipped to \"sal\" or even \"sa\", and \"saluĝis\" (from \"saluton – ĝis la revido\") is seen as a quick hello–goodbye on internet chatrooms. Similarly:\nIn the contraction \"’stas\" the stress shifts to the temporal suffix, which makes the tenses easier to distinguish than they are in formal \"estas\", and effectively recapturing some of the stress patterns of Proto-Esperanto (see below).\n\nSometimes Esperanto derivational morphology is used to create humorous alternatives to existing roots. For instance, with the antonym prefix \"mal-\", one gets,\nAs in English, some slang is intentionally offensive, such as substituting the suffix \"-ingo\" (a sheath) for the feminine \"-ino\" in \"virino\" (a woman), for \"viringo\", meaning a woman as a receptacle for a man. However, such terms are usually coined to translate from English or other languages, and are rarely heard in conversation.\n\nEsperanto has some slang in the sense of in-group talk as well. Some of this is borrowed; for example, \"fajfi pri io\" (to whistle about something) means not to care about it, as in German. Other expressions deriving from Esperanto history or dealing with specifically Esperantist concerns have arisen over the years. A \"volapukaĵo\", for example, is something needlessly incomprehensible, derived from the name of the more complex and less immediately readable constructed language Volapük, which preceded Esperanto by a few years.\n\nWords and phrases reflect what speakers of a language talk about. Tellingly, Esperanto has a slang expression \"krokodili\" (to crocodile) for speaking a language other than Esperanto when Esperanto would be more appropriate, such as at an Esperanto convention, whereas there is nothing equivalent in English.\n\nTechnical jargon exists in Esperanto as it does in English, and this is a major source of debate in the language: whether international jargon should be borrowed into Esperanto, or whether more transparent equivalents should be constructed from existing roots.\n\nHowever, the normal wordplay people use for amusement is occasionally carried to the extreme of being jargon. One such style is called \"Esperant’\", found in chat rooms and occasionally used at Esperanto conventions. \"(See Esperantido.)\"\n\nOne line of verse, taken from the sole surviving example of the original \"Lingwe uniwersala\" of 1878, is used idiomatically:\nIf this stage of Esperanto had been preserved, it would presumably be used to occasionally give a novel the archaic flavor that Latin provides in the modern European languages.\n\nVarious approaches have been taken to represent deviant language in Esperanto literature. One play, for example, originally written in two dialects of Italian, was translated with Esperanto representing one dialect, and Ido representing the other. Other approaches are to attempt to reconstruct proto-Esperanto, and to create \"de novo\" variants of the language.\n\nWith so little data available, various attempts have been made to reconstruct what proto-Esperanto may have been like. However, these reconstructions rely heavily on material from the intermediate period of Esperanto development, between the original \"Lingwe Uniwersala\" of 1878 and the \"Unua Libro\" of 1887. \"(See Proto-Esperanto.)\"\n\nThere are various \"dialects\" and pseudo-historical forms that have been created for literary uses in Esperanto. Two of the more notable are a substandard jargon, \"Popido\", and a fictitious \"archaic\" version of Esperanto called \"Arcaicam Esperantom\". Neither are used in conversation. \"(See Esperantido.)\"\n\nBecause Esperanto vocabulary is largely international, it shares many cognates with English. However, because they were often taken from languages other than English, these do not always have their English meanings. Some of the mismatches are:\n\nLa Plena Ilustrita Vortaro de Esperanto (English: The Complete Illustrated Dictionary of Esperanto, abbreviated PIV) is the largest monolingual dictionary of the language and is generally regarded as the standard. (There is a free online version at vortaro.net.) However, it is subject to criticism, for example for failure to distinguish rare, idiosyncratic, redundant, or even erroneous words attested in a few written texts from their conversational equivalents, and for giving French approximations of some difficult words rather than their Zamehofian meanings. The older \"Plena Vortaro de Esperanto\", originally published in 1930 and reissued with an appendix in 1953, is still widely used, as more portable and less expensive than the PIV, and perhaps more accurate, even if somewhat dated. The \"Etimologia vortaro de Esperanto\" (five volumes, 1989–2001) gives source-language etymologies of all fundamental and official root words (tentative and uncertain in a few cases), along with comparisons of equivalent words in four other constructed international auxiliary languages.\n\n\n"}

Tonia Antoniazzi of the Labour Party became its MP after winning it from a Conservative in the 2017 UK general election. Her party had previously represented the seat from 1908 until 2015.\n\nThe constituency was created in 1885 and has had relatively widely varied boundaries. Before 2015 it had elected Labour MPs since 1906, sharing the longest single-party representation with Normanton and Makerfield. It holds approximately a third of the electorate of the city and county of Swansea, the rest of which is Swansea West and Swansea East.\n\n1885–1918: The Municipal Borough of Swansea, and the Sessional Divisions of Gower, Pontardawe, and Swansea.\n\n1918–1950: The Urban District of Oystermouth, and the Rural Districts of Gower and Swansea.\n\n1950–1983: The Urban District of Llwchwr, and the Rural Districts of Gower and Pontardawe.\n\n1983–2010: The City of Swansea wards of Bishopston, Fairwood, Gower, Newton, Oystermouth, Penclawdd, Pennard, and West Cross, and the Borough of Lliw Valley wards of Clydach, Dulais East, Gorseinon Central, Gorseinon East, Gowerton East, Gowerton West, Graigfelin, Kingsbridge, Llangyfelach, Lower Loughor, Mawr, Penllergaer, Penyrheol, Pontardulais, Tal-y-bont, Upper Loughor, and Vardre.\n\n2010–present: The Swansea County electoral divisions of Bishopston, Clydach, Fairwood, Gorseinon, Gower, Gowerton, Kingsbridge, Llangyfelach, Lower Loughor, Mawr, Newton, Oystermouth, Penclawdd, Penllergaer, Pennard, Penyrheol, Pontardulais, Upper Loughor, and West Cross.\n\nThe constituency encompasses most of the old Lordship of Gower (less the city of Swansea) and covers the inner Gower Peninsula and outer Gower areas including Clydach, Gowerton, Gorseinon, Felindre and Garnswllt.\n\nThe first years, seeing more heavy industrial make-up than today, represented a struggle between the Liberals and those who favoured direct labour representation. Although its new electors in 1885 were predominantly the miners and tinplaters of the Swansea Valley, the new MP was Frank Ash Yeo, a local colliery owner and clearly an upper-class figure. In 1885 he comfortably defeated Henry Nathaniel Miers of Ynyspenllwch in the Swansea Valley, a coal owner, tinplate manufacturer and landowner.\n\nOn Yeo's death in 1888, representatives of the trade unions in the constituency overturned the Liberal association's choice of Sir Horace Davey and ensured the selection of David Randell as candidate. Randell was a Methodist solicitor who specialised in trade union litigation and his victory, albeit with a reduced majority over John Dillwyn Llewellyn, formed the basis of later claims that Gower was a 'labour' seat.\n\nSince 1945, Gower has been a mostly reliable seat for the Labour Party, returning Labour's candidate except in two elections; in the 1983 Conservative landslide, in which it was won by just 1,205 votes, and in 2010, where it was held by 2,683 votes. However, unlike many Welsh valley seats, which have given commanding majorities to Labour, Gower has not seen a majority of over 10,000 votes or 20% of the vote for the Labour candidate in any election (with the exception of 1997) since 1979. In 2015, incumbent MP Martin Caton stood down, and the new Labour candidate Liz Evans was defeated by the Conservative Byron Davies by 27 votes, less than 0.1% of votes cast, which made it the most marginal Conservative seat going into the next election.

He was inaugurated on 7 January 2009, having defeated the ruling party candidate Nana Akufo-Addo in the 2008 election. Previously he was Vice-President from 1997 to 2001 under President Jerry Rawlings, and he stood unsuccessfully in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections as the candidate of the National Democratic Congress (NDC). He is the first and only Ghanaian head of state to die in office.\n\nMills was born on 21 July 1944 in Tarkwa, in the Western Region of Ghana. A member of the Fante ethnic group, he hailed from the town of Ekumfi Otuam in the Mfantsiman East constituency of the Central Region of Ghana. He had his primary and middle school education at Huni Valley Methodist Primary School and Komenda Methodist Middle School respectively. He then proceeded to the prestigious Achimota School for his secondary education, where he completed the Ordinary and Advanced-Level Certificates in 1961 and 1963 respectively, and the University of Ghana, Legon, where he completed a bachelor of law degree, LLB and a professional law certificate in 1967.\n\nMills studied at the London School of Economics and Political Science where he obtained an LLM in 1968 and earned a PhD in Law at the School of Oriental and African Studies School of Law, part of the federal University of London, after completing his doctoral thesis in the field of taxation and economic development in 1971 at the age of 27. Even during his career in politics, he was sometimes called by the nickname \"The Prof\", a reference to his long academic career. His political supporters also called him \"Asomdweehene\" meaning 'King of Peace' in the Akan language.\n\nMills' first formal teaching assignment was as a lecturer at the Faculty of Law at the University of Ghana. He spent close to twenty-five years teaching at Legon and other institutions of higher learning. In 1971, he was selected for the Fulbright Scholar programme at Stanford Law School in the US.\n\nHe returned to his homeland, Ghana, at the end of the international educational exchange fellowship to work at his alma mater, the University of Ghana, for 25 years. He became a visiting professor at Temple University (Philadelphia, USA), with two stints from 1978 to 1979, and 1986 to 1987. He was also a visiting lecturer at Leiden University in the Netherlands from 1985 to 1986. During this period, he authored several publications relating to taxation during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nOutside of his academic pursuits, Mills was the Acting Commissioner of Ghana's Internal Revenue Service from 1988 to 1993 under President Jerry John Rawlings, and the substantive Commissioner from 1993 to 1996. By 1992, he had become an Associate Professor of Law at the University of Ghana. In 2002, he was a visiting scholar at the Liu Institute for Global Issues at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia through a joint Canadian International Development Agency(CIDA) – International Development Research Centre (IDRC) fellowship programme.\n\nFor the inaugural presidential election in 1992, the National Convention Party (NCP) had formed an alliance with the National Democratic Congress (NDC). Former Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) Chairman, and leader of Ghana, Flight-Lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings chose the NCP leader, Kow Nkensen Arkaah, as his running-mate for vice-president. Having been elected in the 1992 election, Arkaah served between 1992–1996.\n\nHowever, on 29 January 1996, the NCP broke with the NDC. Arkaah with the National Convention Party formed the Great Alliance with the New Patriotic Party and was subsequently nominated as the running mate of John Agyekum Kufuor to challenge the National Democratic Congress. Rawlings selected Mills for the vacated Vice-Presidency in his bid for re-election to a second term in the election and was re-elected to his second term in office, serving from 1996 to 2000. In his capacity as Vice-President, he served as the Chairman of the Police Council of Ghana and the Chairman of the Economic Management Team.\n\nIn 2000, Mills became the NDC's candidate for the 2000 presidential election after Rawlings had served his constitutionally mandated terms as president. The main rival for Mills' own bid for the presidency was John Agyekum Kufuor, who was running as the candidate for the opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP). In the heat of the 2000 presidential campaign, Mills was roundly criticized for statements that if elected he would consult with Rawlings daily. In the first round, held on 7 December 2000, Mills gained 44.8% of the vote, Kufuor won the first round with 48.4%, thus forcing a second round. On 28 December 2000, Kufuor defeated Mills with 56.9% of the vote and was sworn in as president on 7 January 2001.\n\nIn December 2002, Mills was elected by his party to be its flag bearer and lead them into the 2004 election. He was, however, defeated again by incumbent president John Agyekum Kufuor, who received 52.45% of the vote on the first ballot.\n\nOn 21 December 2006, he became the NDC's candidate for the 2008 presidential election, winning his party's ticket by an 81.4% result (1,362 votes), far ahead of his opponents, Ekwow Spio-Garbrah, Alhaji Mahama Iddrisu, and Eddie Annan. In the 2008 election, John Agyekum Kufuor was no longer eligible to run as president, having served two terms. It was during this time that the term \"Better Ghana Agenda\" was coined. During the 2008 elections, in an attempt to change the public perception at the time that he would be a political lackey of his former mentor, Jerry Rawlings when elected, he distanced himself from his previous comments made in the 2000 campaign .\n\nMills' main opponent from the New Patriotic Party was now Nana Akufo-Addo. Mills ran under the campaign slogan of \"A Better Man for a Better Ghana,\" on a platform of change. He said: \"People are complaining. They're saying that their standard of living has deteriorated these past eight years. So if Ghana is a model of growth, it's not translating into something people can feel.\" The result of the first ballot had Akufo-Addo in front with 49.13% of the vote to Mills' 47.92%, however, a run-off second round of voting was needed. The second round of voting took place on 28 December 2008. The result was a slim lead held by Mills, but due to problems with the distribution of ballots, the Tain constituency, located in the Brong-Ahafo Region, was forced to vote again on 2 January 2009. The final result was a victory by Mills with 50.23% of the vote to Akufo-Addo's 49.77%. Mills became the third president of the 4th Republic of Ghana. Self-described as a social democrat who believed in the concept of social welfare espoused by Kwame Nkrumah (independent Ghana's first leader), Mills embraced a political platform that was more comprehensive and less divisive than that of either Nkrumah or Rawlings. John Atta Mills was sworn in as president on 7 January 2009 in a peaceful transition after Kufor was narrowly defeated. His persistence and determination paid off when he won the 2008 presidential poll.\n\nAmongst his accomplishments as president was presiding over and initiating Ghana's first ever foray into oil production,after oil was discovered in commercial quantities under his predecessor,John Kufuor. He was also credited for growth in other sectors of the economy during his tenure. He was the first incumbent president to be re-nominated for an election for his party via a primary. Some of the monumental achievements chalked during his term of office include:\n\nUnder Mills, Ghana's stable economy experienced sustained reduced inflation leading to the attainment of single digit inflation of about 8.4% (one of the lowest inflation rates Ghana had attained in 42 years i.e. period between 1970 and 2012 as well as the lowest since June 1992 just before the start of Ghana's Fourth Republic) from a high of 18.1% in December 2008. This is indicative of prudent fiscal, monetary and other austerity policy measures that characterised his presidency to put the economy in healthy shape. The Ghanaian currency, the Cedi also stabilised as a result of these policies. In 2011, Ghana was the fastest growing economy in the world at 20.15% for the first half of the year and 14.4% at the end of the financial year according to the International Monetary Fund and EconomyWatch.com. Moreover, Ghana's budget deficit was reduced to 2% of the Gross Domestic Product during his tenure compared to 14.5% of GDP in 2008, just before he was elected as the President of Ghana. There was also a huge improvement in Ghana's gross international reserves and foreign direct investments (FDI) highlighting exceptional macroeconomic performance. The Mills government also implemented the Single Spine Salary system which increased compensation levels of all public sector workers. In a bid to improve the efficiency in revenue collection, Mills established the Ghana Revenue Authority which integrated Value Added Tax (VAT), Customs Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Under his governance, Ghana met three out of the four primary convergence criteria for the proposed common currency, Eco of the West African Monetary Zone. These accomplishments led to renewed domestic and foreign investor confidence in Ghana's economy. During Mills’ time in office, Ghana was adjudged the best place for doing business in West Africa and best West African performer in access to credit according to the 2011 World Bank Doing Business global rankings.\n\nThere was also an increase in the capitation grants (government subsidies towards public education) under Mills. The government also introduced a programme to provide free school uniforms to deprived communities while providing over 100,000 laptops or notebooks to school children to facilitate the learning process in a highly technological world. An initiative to provide free exercise books started under Mills. More than 23 million books were distributed. His government also expanded the school feeding programme to include 230 more schools. Government paid the full tuition fees for all teachers pursuing further studies through distance learning. A sustained program involving the Ministry of Education, the GETFUND, and resources allocated by the various District Assemblies have begun to ensure the elimination of schools under trees and provide all schools in the country with decent classroom infrastructure. Out of the 4,320 schools under trees, almost 1,700 schools under trees were eliminated across the country. The Mills administration also started a program to re-equip science resource centres in all districts of the country to enhance the teaching and learning of science. Two new specialized public universities were established during his tenure: the University of Health and Allied Sciences in the Volta Region and the University Of Energy And Natural Resources in the Brong-Ahafo Region. As president, Mills established a working relationship between the Masters in Development Practice program (MDP) at the University of Winnipeg, Canada and the University for Development Studies Ghana, leading to a joint initiative on the study of development practice for Indigenous and traditional societies.\n\nDuring his term of office, the Mills government provided a facelift to many teaching, regional and district hospitals across the country by upgrading old facilities and providing newer ones such as more high-tech equipment and more beds in hospitals, particularly at the Tamale Teaching Hospital. His government also built several polyclinics to increase access to healthcare. The government also scaled up the National Ambulance Service to cover all districts in the nation. Increased collaboration between stakeholders led higher patronage of the National Health Insurance Scheme. Utilization of the scheme rose by 75%.\n\nTrue to his promise to reduce the number of Ministerial appointees and run a lean government, the number of Ministers was significantly reduced from 87 of the previous Kufuor NPP government to 73 (a reduction of 16%) in the Mills-led government. It was projected that approximately $4 million was saved annually by this bold decision to run a small government. The hundreds of Special Assistants, Presidential Staffers and Spokespersons were also eliminated to improve fiscal efficiency. He commissioned a review of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana in a bid to improve upon the country's governance architecture. He held an annual media forum every year at the presidency to interact with journalists about socio-political issues. President Atta Mills re-equipped and re-tooled the security agencies: the military, the police, the fire service, the Immigration, The Prisons Service and the Customs Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS). In order to ensure inter-generational equity because of the \"finite nature of resource revenue\" as well as financial security for future Ghanaian generations, the Mills government established in 2011, the Ghana Heritage Fund - a sovereign wealth fund generated from petroleum revenue accumulated from the country's oil and gas industry. John Atta Mills established the Media Development Fund to promote media excellence and freedom in the spirit of 1992 constitution. A few months prior to his death, he was praised by US President Barack Obama for making Ghana a \"good news story\" that had good democratic credentials. He also fostered economic ties with China in a bid strengthen Sino-Ghanaian bilateral relations. In 2009, the Journal of International Affairs at Columbia University featured Mills as one of the \"Five Faces of African Innovation and Entrepreneurship\" along with South African innovator, Euvin Naidoo and Mo Ibrahim, (founder of Celtel International and Chairman of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation) where he was lauded for his commitment to strengthening Ghana's Electoral Commission, National Media Commission and\nNational Commission for Civic Education and more importantly, transparency in public institutions, particularly in the country's growing oil and gas sector. Mills' leadership style was very diplomatic, inclusive and less polarising than his predecessors. The BBC described his presidency as that of \"a peacemaker who was never one to make disparaging comments in public\" despite intense criticisms and vilification from his political supporters and opponents alike.\n\nThe Savannah Accelerated Development Authority (SADA) law was passed and work was started to open up the three Northern regions, Brong Ahafo and Volta Regions to enhance agriculture production and industrialisation. Under Mills, the producer price of cocoa increased appreciably to $1600 per tonne of 16 bags, which was the highest in the sub-region and the highest that had ever been paid to cocoa farmers in Ghana's entire history. Cocoa production also hit a record-breaking 1 million metric tonnes. Under the rural electrification programme, he extended national electricity coverage from 54% to 72% improving livelihoods in 1,700 communities and making Ghana the third best country in sub-Saharan Africa after Mauritius and South Africa with enhanced energy access.\n\nHe was married to Ernestina Naadu Mills (née Botchway), an educator, and had a son, Sam Kofi Atta Mills. He was raised a Protestant in the Methodist tradition.\nHe was a distant cousin of the prominent Gold Coast lawyer, Thomas Hutton-Mills, Jr. He was a good friend to T. B. Joshua of The Synagogue, Church of All Nations in Lagos, Nigeria and regularly visited his church. He said, following his inauguration, that Joshua had prophesied that it would take him three elections to win the presidency and that the result would be released in January.\n\nAs a sports administrator, he contributed to the Ghana Hockey Association, National Sports Council of Ghana, Ghana Olympic Committee and Accra Hearts of Oak Sporting Club. He was one time the chairman. He enjoyed field hockey and swimming, and once played for the national hockey team (he remained a member of the Veterans Hockey Team until his death). He was also a board member of Hearts of Oak, the former chairman of the Black Stars management team and a Manchester United fan.\n\nAt the University of Ghana, Mills was the Hall Tutor of Legon Hall as well as serving as the Hall Librarian, Member of Legon Hall Council, Member of Board of Social Studies and School of Administration, Member of Admissions Board, Staff Housing Loans Scheme and the Chairman of the University Superannuation Scheme. Mills was involved in various activities and projects:\n\nMills died on 24 July 2012 at the 37 Military Hospital in Accra,\nthree days after his 68th birthday. Though the cause of death was not immediately released, he had been suffering from throat cancer and had recently been to the US for medical reasons. Announcing his death, his office noted that he died hours after being taken ill, but a presidential aide said that he had complained of pains the day prior to his death. However, Mills' brother, Dr. Cadman Mills later disclosed during the graveside service that he had died from complications of a massive hemorrhagic stroke resulting from brain aneurysm. According to the BBC, his voice had degenerated in the previous few months. Former minister Elizabeth Ohene said that as a result of previous false reports of his death, she had not believed initial claims of his actual death. \"For the past three or four years, there's been news he's been unwell and rumours of his death – twice – and he appeared with grim humour to say they were exaggerated, insisting he was well.\" His vice president John Dramani Mahama was sworn in at about 20:00 GMT on the same day. In accordance with Ghana's constitution, Mahama's tenure expired at the same time Mills' was due to end, by the end of the year just prior to an election, in which he was due to run. Mahama said upon being inaugurated in parliament:\nThis is the saddest day in our nation's history. Tears have engulfed our nation and we are deeply saddened and distraught. I never imagined that one day that it would place our nation in such a difficult circumstance. I'm personally devastated, I've lost a father, I've lost a friend, I've lost a mentor and a senior comrade. Ghana is united in grief at this time for our departed president.\n\nFrom 8–10 August, his body lay in state, and Ghanaian government officials, civil society, traditional leaders, the clergy, the general public and dignitaries such as Côte d'Ivoire's Alassane Ouattara, Liberia's Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Nigeria's Goodluck Jonathan and Senegal's Macky Sall paid their last respects. Within this period, a two-night vigil was also held at the forecourt of the State House for cultural and musical performances such as traditional dirges, plays and tribute reading. Thousands streamed into the State House to pay their last respects to Mills as he lay in state with some mourners queuing for hours, many of them wailing with grief, in lines up to 10 km (6 miles) long per press reports. The body was then taken by a military cortege from the State House parliamentary complex to the Independence Square for the funerary services which was attended by 18 African Heads of State, 5 Vice-Presidents, United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, former United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, Cardinal Peter Turkson, Secretary-General of African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, Mohamed Ibn Chambas and several other international envoys. In all, there were 67 foreign delegations represented at the funeral. In addition to the over 50,000 people who gathered for the ceremony, his funeral was also attended by Benin's Thomas Boni Yayi, who said of Mills that he was \"passionate about peace in Africa and in the region,\" as well as Togo's Faure Gnassingbe, who said \"[Mills] was like a brother to me. I will surely miss him.\"\n\nAhead of religious ceremonies on Friday morning, the officially declared national day of mourning, a helicopter hovered over the area dropping leaflets reading: \"We want peaceful elections in 2012\". The funeral ended with the release of a hundred white doves into the air to signify the peaceful nature of the departed leader.\n\nAfter the funeral service, the president's body was taken on a military procession through some principal streets of the Ghanaian capital, Accra and then for burial in a newly created presidential mausoleum located in a bird sanctuary, Geese Park renamed Asomdwee (Peace) Memorial Park along the Marine Drive and next to the old seat of government, the 17th-century Fort Christiansborg, (also known as Osu Castle), which overlooks the Atlantic Ocean's Gulf of Guinea. As the sitting Commander-in-Chief, Mills was accorded full military honours, steeped in distinct and elaborate traditions, including a slow march by the Ghana Army, a fly-past of Ghana Air Force jets ejecting plumes of smoke in the national colours of red, gold and green, with the Ghana Navy ships also performing ceremonial manoeuvres on the shoreline behind the Independence Square and a 21-gun salute accompanying the playing of the bugle call, \"Sunset\" and the Christian hymn, \"Abide with Me\" (\"Eventide\"), in addition to sounding of the Last Post by military buglers after the casket had been lowered into the grave. Approximately 700 domestic and foreign media outlets received accreditation from the Ghanaian Ministry of Information to cover the event. An estimated 20–25 million television and online or web audience watched the three-day funeral ceremonies. The state funeral for the late president was most likely the largest gathering of people in one place at a single public event in recent or modern Ghanaian history.\n\nFollowing his death, a press statement from the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon said Mills \"will be remembered for his statesmanship and years of dedicated service to his country.\" and French President Francois Hollande described Mills as \" the guardian of institutions and the defender of Ghanaian democracy...committed to protecting national unity and profoundly attached to African unity and to the place of Africa within the international community.\" A White House statement from United States President Barack Obama called Mills a \"strong advocate for human rights and for the fair treatment of all Ghanaians, tirelessly working to improve the lives of the Ghanaian people; He helped promote economic growth in Ghana in the midst of challenging global circumstances and strengthened Ghana's strong tradition of democracy\" while Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron praised Mills as \"a tireless defender of democracy in West Africa and across the continent\" Furthermore, the Prime Minister of Japan, Yoshihiko Noda lauded Mills for \"his exemplary leadership which endeared him to the hearts of many and his contribution to strengthening the relationship between Ghana and Japan.\" FIFA President, Sepp Blatter offered his sympathies to Ghanaians on behalf of the worldwide football fraternity saying, “Ghana has lost a great football supporter and a supporter of the development of the game in the country.\" In a message of condolence from the Vatican City, Pope Benedict XVI \"recalled Mills' years of public service and his dedication to democratic principles and entrusted the late president's soul to the providence of Almighty God\"\n\nThe Secretary General of the Commonwealth of Nations, Kamalesh Sharma eulogised Atta Mills by describing him as \"an inspiring leader, a strong advocate and champion of the Commonwealth, and our membership benefited enormously from his active participation in Commonwealth life and his wisdom.\" The West African regional body, ECOWAS said President Mills' death \"has robbed the region of a voice of wisdom which enriched the discussions of the affairs of the Community.\" The African Union through its chairman, Yayi Boni said \"the late President Mills had the same vision as the first President of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah and it was a great, great loss for the country and for the continent.\" Liberia's President and 2011 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf extended her condolences to Ghanaians, saying the news had \"come as a surprise. On a personal level his moderation and integrity stood out, playing a strong role at the regional meetings they both attended.” Nigeria's  President Goodluck Jonathan said of Mills: “he was a great friend of our country and a firm believer in the shared heritage and common destiny of all Africans. President Mills and I shared a vision of peace and political stability as well as regional and continental economic integration in pursuit of progress and development, in our individual countries, within the sub-region and in Africa as a whole.” South African President Jacob Zuma paid tribute to President Atta Mills, saying: \"South Africa and Ghana enjoy strong relations at both the bilateral and multilateral levels, and under President Mills' leadership, we saw genuine efforts aimed at deepening the historical relations between our two nations.\"\n\nMills' more than one dozen publications included:\n\nAs Head of State, Mills received the 2009 Glo-CAF Platinum Award for \"commitment and contribution to sports and football development in the country.\" Mills was posthumously awarded the highest prize as the 2012 \"Lifetime Africa Achievement Prize Laureate on Democratic Governance and Development in Africa\". According to the Prize Committee, the award was in \"recognition of his genteel disposition, virtues, devotion and commitment to the enhancement of good Democratic Governance and Development in Ghana and Africa at large. This exaltation of character, which is worthy of emulation, has made positive impact on the lives of his people today and will continue to influence them for a better future. His courageous acts in defence and protection of fairness to all is recognized and respected on the global platform and lend to all Africans the hope that through the values of equity and democracy, we can live in peace and harmony with each other to engender communal development and life's fulfilment. This individual's leadership has had a direct impact on Ghana's success and growth which is cherished by Ghanaians countrywide.\" \nAt the 2013 \"African Achievers Awards,\" he was also awarded the \"Posthumous Award for Excellence in Africa\" in recognition of his achievements and leadership.\n\nThe Institute of International Education (IIE) in New York City also posthumously bestowed on him its highest award, \"The Fritz Redlich Alumni Award\" in recognition of \"his distinguished career and exemplary leadership that increased cooperation and understanding between Ghana and the world, and his resolute support for advancing education to prepare an entire generation in Ghana for today's competitive, globalized economy and to honour him as the first ever Fulbright Scholar to become the Head of State of an African nation by becoming the President of Ghana.\" In appreciation of Mills' total commitment to the rule of law and good governance, the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration, established \"The John Evans Atta Mills Centre for Law and Governance\" to undertake high quality research and theorisation in law, global governance and public policy.\n\nIn the wake of his death, Accra High Street was renamed \"John Evans Atta Mills High Street\" by an Accra Metropolitan Assembly resolution and in Cape Coast a street linking Cape Coast Castle to Mfantsipim Junction was renamed \"President John Atta Mills Street\" by the paramount chief of Cape Coast, Omanhene of the Oguaa Traditional Area, Osaberema Kwesi Arthur. Furthermore, for his role in consolidating local development, the Suhum Municipal Assembly and the Ga South Assembly named bypass roads after him. Also, the Municipal Assembly of Obuasi honoured Mills by naming a principal street after him in the southern mining town of Obuasi, located in the geographic middle belt of Ghana. whilst the Nandom Assembly honoured Mills by naming a street after him for creating the District in 2012.\n\nThe New Millennium City School at the Salvation Army Cluster of Schools was renamed \"President John Evans Atta Mills Educational Centre of Excellence\". An ICT Centre was also built at Mills' alma mater Huni Valley Methodist Basic School to honour his memory while the University of Ghana, Legon, co-named its Faculty of Law building after him (and former Dean, Professor Akua Kuenyehia) in recognition of his contributions to the department as a professor and president. In 2015, the Ghanaian government named a newly commissioned community day secondary school after Atta Mills in his hometown, Otuam The Judicial Council of Ghana renamed its largest court complex after Atta Mills in acknowledgement of his contributions as \"a true democrat who respected the independence of the Judiciary and worked to promote it.\"\nAdditionally, a research centre known as the \"Kwame Nkrumah-Atta Mills Legacy Institute\" \"(KNAMLI)\" has been set up to study the political ideals of tolerance that President Mills cherished through his non-pursual of partisan retribution as well as his demonstration of a passive response to vitriolic attacks, vindictiveness, violence and insults as preached by global icons like Mahatma Gandhi, Kwame Nkrumah, Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela. This will act as a living testimony worthy of preservation, emulation and impartation to the youth. The institute is also a think-tank for strategic studies and organisation, in line with Kwame Nkrumah’s declaration that \"organisation decides everything\". To mark the 2013 World Post Day, the Ghana Post in collaboration with the Ministry of Communications issued commemorative postal stamps of Atta Mills in appreciation of his \"dedication to social justice and political stability.\" In honour of his \"contribution to the promotion and development of sports in general and hockey in particular\", the National Hockey Association launched a yearly multinational hockey gala, the \"John Evans Atta Mills Annual Hockey Tournament\". Other permanent memorials to institutionalise his legacy include the annual \"Atta Mills Memorial Lectures\", the \"Atta Mills Foundation\" (a humanitarian non-profit organisation) and the \"Atta Mills Memorial Research Library\" affiliated to the University of Cape Coast In 2014, the Ghanaian government named the country's second floating production storage and offloading vessel, FPSO John Atta Mills - as president, he superintended over the first production of Ghana's new-found oil in commercial quantities. A new girls' boarding house at his alma mater, Achimota School has been named in his honour. In 2015, a newly constructed community day senior high school at Ekumfi Otuam in the Central Region, was named in honour of Mills in recognition of “his passion in promoting education.” In July 2019 a seventh anniversary memorial and wreath laying ceremony took place at the Asomdwee Park.\n\n"}

The river rises at an elevation of about 1391 feet in a chain of 11 lakes in southern Hubbard County, Minnesota, and flows generally south, then east, entering the Mississippi at Crow Wing State Park northwest of Little Falls, Minnesota. Its name is a loose translation from the Ojibwe language \"Gaagaagiwigwani-ziibi\" (\"Raven-feather River\"). A wing-shaped island at its mouth accounts for the river's name. Because of its many campsites and its undeveloped shores, the Crow Wing River is considered one of the state's best \"wilderness\" routes for canoeists; although it is shallow (seldom more than deep), it is nearly always deep enough for canoeing.\n\nMuch of the river is flanked by thick forests. For its first the river cuts through low marshy lands. The river broadens and the banks increase in height as it flows southward. Jack pine forest has all but replaced the virgin white and red pine forests on the sandy plains of northern Wadena County, Minnesota. Hazel, blueberries, sweet fern, bearberry, wintergreen, bracken and reindeer moss provide lush ground cover. The Crow Wing's lower reaches are flanked by a river bottom forest of elm, ash, cottonwood, box elder, oak, basswood, maple, willow and aspen. Grasslands, bogs and swamps are scattered throughout the river corridor.\n\nDue to its sandy bottom, limited cover and dearth of deep pools, the Crow Wing is not a good game fish river. Shorthead Redhorse and White Sucker, both rough fish, are the river's most common species.\n\nThe diversity of vegetation along the river supports a wide variety of wildlife. Canoeists may see turtles, otters, muskrats, beavers, mink, raccoons, gophers, chipmunks, squirrels and rabbit. Bobcats and a small number of black bears also inhabit the river area. It is not unusual to even see eagles fishing from the river.\n\nGame species include white-tailed deer, ruffed grouse, woodcock and various waterfowl. The Crow Wing supports only a limited number of waterfowl because of sparse aquatic vegetation and a lack of backwater areas.\n\nThe Dakota Indians held the Crow Wing region until the Ojibwe began moving westward into the region in the early 18th century. By the early 19th century the Ojibwe controlled lands west of the Mississippi and north of the Crow Wing. Signs of Native American presence mark the river corridor, with Native American burial mounds at several sites along the river, including a site at river mile 61.\n\nFur traders entered the region in the early 18th century. In 1792 the North West Company established the Wadena Trading Post on the west bluff of the river at its junction with the Partridge River. There was considerable overland trade in the area by the 19th century. The Old Otter Tail Trail crossed the river near the Wadena post and was the main transportation route between St. Paul and Fort Garry in Winnipeg.\n\nDense forests near the river made Nimrod, Minnesota, an important lumbering center from the 1870s to the early 20th century. By the start of the 20th century, most of the virgin timber had been cleared, and the economy came to depend on agriculture. The river continues to attract a small but devoted number of visitors, ranging from regional outdoor enthusiasts in late spring to Native Americans who harvest wild rice growing along the river in the autumn.\n\n"}

Created in 1542, it elects one Member of Parliament (MP), traditionally known as the knight of the shire, by the first-past-the-post system of election.\n\nThe Montgomeryshire Welsh Assembly constituency was created with the same boundaries in 1999.\n\nThe seat is based on the ancient county of Montgomeryshire, in the principal area of Powys. One of Britain's most rural and isolated constituencies, Montgomeryshire elected Liberal or Liberal-affiliated candidates from 1880, until a Conservative victory in the 1979 general election. In the 1983 general election it was only seat in England and Wales where a sitting Conservative MP was unseated, while nationally his party's seat majority increased. However, in 2010, the Conservatives won and held the seat in 2015 and 2017, with an increased majority. The seat is believed to be marginal, but the figures show that this is not the case. The seat was officially known as Montgomery before 1997. It is the only seat in Wales never to have elected a Labour MP. \n\nUntil 1918 this seat, in common with many others, contained an enclaved seat which was comprised the boroughs of Montgomery, Llanfyllin, Llanidloes, Newtown and Welshpool. This seat survived the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 which abolished many similar seats. The seat was finally abolished in 1918 and absorbed into the wider Montgomery seat where it remains today.\n\nUnder proposed constituency boundary changes announced in September 2016, ahead of the next general election, the seat was to be partitioned, the northern half including Welshpool to be merged with Clwyd South to form a new seat of South Clwyd and North Montgomeryshire; most of the southern including Newtown will be merged with the Brecon and Radnor seat to form a seat renamed as Brecon, Radnor and Montgomery, and the wards of Llanidloes and Blaen Hafren merged into the Ceredigion constituency which would form part of a new seat called Ceredigion and North Pembrokeshire. However, the general elections of 2017 and 2019 were fought on existing boundaries.\n\nOf the 213 rejected ballots:\n\nnote: The David Rowlands who stood here is different from the David Rowlands who stood in Newport East at this election for UKIP.\n\nIn 1983 this was Labour's worst performance in Wales and the only seat where Labour won less than 12.5% and lost their £150 deposit. The threshold for retaining deposits was lowered to 5% in 1985.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Such roads are public ways intended primarily for high-speed travel over long distances, and they have resulted in highways in the United States with engineering features such as long sight-distances, wide marked lanes and the absence of cross traffic. These provide faster and safer travel.\n\nFreeways are usually limited to motor vehicles of a minimum power or weight; signs may prohibit bicyclists, pedestrians and equestrians and impose a minimum speed. It is possible for non-motorized traffic to use facilities within the same right-of-way, such as sidewalks constructed along freeway-standard bridges and multi-use paths next to freeways such as the Suncoast Trail along the Suncoast Parkway in Florida.\n\nIn some US jurisdictions, especially where freeways replace existing roads, non-motorized access on freeways is the rule. Different states of the United States have different laws. Cycling on freeways in Arizona may be prohibited only where there is an alternative route judged equal or better for cycling. Wyoming, the least populated state, allows cycling on all freeways. Oregon allows bicycles except on specific urban freeways in Portland and Medford.\n\nIn countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany, the difference between a normal road and a freeway-class road (motorway or autobahn) is the restriction of low-speed traffic. Many roads are built to freeway standards but are not legally freeway-class roads for this reason. Indeed, some freeway-class roads are downgraded for short stretches where no alternative exists, to allow low-speed traffic; examples in the UK include the Dartford Crossing (the furthest downstream public crossing of the Thames), and the former Cumberland Gap, as well as sections of the A1 not yet designated A1(M), various lengths of the A5, and the entirety of other important and near-motorway-standard links such as the A14, A34, A38, A42, A50, and A55 road, long stretches of which carry speed limits. The reasons for such designation vary—physical lack of space (A55), restricted budget (e.g. A42; a full-standard motorway would have been more expensive than an A-road; a motorway with additional service roads further still), or because of legislative or political wrangling (easier to have A-road construction or upgrade authorised and accepted than a more emotionally charged \"motorway scheme\", and does not require issuing of Special Road orders). Continental European non-motorway dual carriageways can have limits as high as . U.S. Route 23 in Ohio has a speed limit as high as but isn't legally a freeway-class road since it has no disclaimers saying that low-speed vehicles are prohibited; it also has at-grade intersections like expressway-class roadways.\n\nResearch shows 85 percent of motor vehicle-bicycle crashes follow turning or crossing at intersections. Freeway travel eliminates almost all those conflicts save at entrance and exit ramps—which, at least on those freeways where cycling has not been banned, have sufficient room and sight for cyclists and motorists. An analysis of crashes in Arizona showed no safety problems with cycling on freeways. Fewer than one motor vehicle-bicycle crash a year was recorded on nearly 2000 shoulder-miles open to cyclists in Arizona.\nBike freeways are long-distance cycle tracks with few intersections intended for long-distance travel with access restricted for motorized vehicles and usually pedestrians.\n\nMost U.S. States with low population densities commonly permit bicycle use on interstate freeways outside urban areas. Additionally, some states permit bicycle use on at least some interstate routes specially designated to accommodate bikes.\n\n"}

Both beaver sexes have a pair of castor sacs and a pair of anal glands, located in two cavities under the skin between the pelvis and the base of the tail. The castor sacs are not true glands (endocrine or exocrine) on a cellular level, hence references to these structures as preputial glands, castor glands, or scent glands are misnomers.\n\nIt is used as a tincture in some perfumes and was sometimes used as a food additive in the early 1900s.\n\nThe sacs brought per ounce when auctioned at the May–June 2016 North American Fur Auction.\n\nAt least 24 compounds are known constituents of beaver castoreum. Several of these have pheromonal activity, of which the phenols 4-ethylphenol and catechol and the ketones acetophenone and 3-hydroxyacetophenone were strongest. Five additional compounds elicit a weaker response: 4-methylcatechol, 4-methoxyacetophenone, 5-methoxysalicylic acid, salicylaldehyde, and 3-hydroxybenzoic acid. There are also oxygen-containing monoterpenes such as 6-methyl-l-heptanol, 4,6-dimethyl-l-heptanol, isopinocamphone, pinocamphone, and two linalool oxides and their acetates. Other compounds are: benzoic acid, benzyl alcohol, borneol, \"o\"-cresol, 4-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone, hydroquinone, phenol. All those compounds are gathered from plant food. It also contains nupharamine alkaloids and castoramine, and \"cis\"-cyclohexane-1,2-diol.\n\nIn perfumery, the term castoreum refers to the resinoid extract resulting from the dried and alcohol tinctured beaver castor. The dried beaver castor sacs are generally aged for two or more years to mellow.\n\nCastoreum is largely used for its note suggesting leather, typically compounded with other ingredients including top, middle, and base notes. Some classic perfumes incorporating castor are Emeraude, Chanel Antaeus, Cuir de Russie, Magie Noire, Lancôme Caractère, Hechter Madame, Givenchy III, Shalimar, and many \"leather\" themed compositions.\n\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration lists castoreum extract as a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) food additive. In 1965, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association's GRAS program (FEMA 2261 and 2262) added castoreum extract and castoreum liquid. The annual industry consumption is very low, around 300 pounds, whereas vanillin is over 2.6 million pounds annually.\n\nCastoreum has been traditionally used in Sweden for flavoring a variety of schnapps commonly referred to as \"Bäverhojt\" (literally, \"beaver shout\").\n\nCastoreum was also considered for use to contribute to the flavor and odor of cigarettes.\n\nMedieval beekeepers used castoreum to increase honey production.\n\n\n\n"}

In Pontypridd township itself the wards are: Town, Treforest, Rhondda (consisting of Hopkinstown, Maesycoed, Graigwen, Trehafod, & Pwllgwaun), Graig, Trallwng, Rhydyfelin Central & Ilan, & Hawthorn. The Western half consists of the following wards: Taffs Well, Beddau, Church Village, Tonteg, Llantwit Fardre, Llantrisant, Pontyclun, Talbot Green, Tonyrefail East and Tonyrefail West.\n\nAlternatively, one can think of the constituency as being divided between a 'suburban' district in the south and communities that grew in the industrial revolution to the north; the Southern area, particularly between Church Village and Llantrisant, contains much new residential and light industrial development, and benefits from good transport links due to its proximity to the M4.

The constituency remained unchanged from this form until the Third Periodic Parliamentary Boundary Review's proposals were implemented in 1983. This removed Cowbridge Borough and the Cowbridge Rural District placing them in the Vale of Glamorgan constituency additionally moving out the communities of Llanharry, Llanharan, and Brynna into the Ogmore constituency.

He was first elected in the 2003 election and was re-elected in 2007, 2011 and 2016.\n\nHarvie went to Dumbarton Academy between 1984–1991, and attended Manchester Metropolitan University where he was briefly a member of the Labour party.\n\nFrom 1997 till his election in 2003, Harvie worked within the Gay Men's Project at the sexual health organisation PHACE Scotland (now part of the Terrence Higgins Trust) initially as a youth worker and later as Development Worker for the Lanarkshire Health Board area. Although this work was principally concerned with HIV prevention, it also involved Harvie in equality campaigning. He also had a spell as a civil servant, working with the Inland Revenue in Dumbarton. During this period, he was active in the campaign to repeal Section 2A of the Local Government Act, more commonly known as Section 28. This campaign was successful, and Harvie has stated that the experience prompted him to become more actively involved in politics, leading to his joining the Scottish Green Party.\n\nHarvie has gained attention both for issues strongly associated with the Greens, such as campaigning against the extension to the M74 motorway in Glasgow, and for more 'mainstream' issues such as opposition to the Identity Cards Bill.\n\nQuickly after becoming an MSP he caused some controversy by proposing civil partnership legislation in the Scottish Parliament. Though this legislation was ultimately handled at Westminster and covered the whole UK, the distinctive Scottish proposals helped to stimulate some public debate north of the border, both on the issue of same-sex relationships and on the process known as a Legislative Consent Motion by which the Scottish Parliament allows Westminster to legislate for the whole UK.\nHarvie was a member of the Communities Committee of the Scottish Parliament throughout the 2003–07 session, and through this committee he worked on the Anti-social behaviour Bill, the Charities Bill and the Housing Bill, as well as on issues of homelessness, debt, the planning system and building standards. In 2004 Harvie was given the 'One to Watch' award at the annual Scottish Politician of the Year event. In addition to the Communities portfolio, Harvie covered the Justice portfolio for the Greens, and has been active on a number of civil liberties issues. He has also been convener of the Cross Party Group (CPG) on Human Rights, and helped to establish a CPG on Sexual Health.\n\nFollowing the Green Party's disappointing performance in the 2007 election, Harvie was returned with a reduced share of the vote. The tight parliamentary arithmetic and a constructive relationship with the Scottish National Party led to a Co-operation Agreement between the two parties. Under this, Harvie was nominated to convene the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee.\n\n\n\nHarvie is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society, Honorary Vice-President of the Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association and a patron of Parents Enquiry Scotland. He is a board member of the Glasgay! Festival, and a member of Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Equality Network, Stonewall (UK), Amnesty International, Humanist Society Scotland, Campaign for Real Ale and the Campaign Against the Arms Trade. From 2003 till 2007, Harvie wrote a weekly column in the Scottish edition of the \"Big Issue\".\n\nHe is bisexual, and in 2003 became the first openly bisexual Member of the Scottish Parliament.\n\nHe was also a candidate in the election for Rector of the University of Glasgow in February 2008.\n\nHarvie is an advocate of Open Source and Free Software, and a Linux user.

The seat borders the constituencies of Cynon Valley, Ogmore, Pontypridd, and Aberavon.\n\nThis constituency was first created under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, for the 1885 general election. For the 1918 general election it was divided into Rhondda East and Rhondda West.\n\nThe constituency was re-united in 1974. Since 1974, the constituency has always had a large Labour majority, and in the 1987 general election was the safest seat for any party, anywhere in Britain. In 2001, it was the only seat in the country where Liberal Democrats lost their deposit, and the Conservative Party also lost their deposit in their worst performance outside Northern Ireland.\n\nThe constituency was formed following the Third Reform Act of 1884, as a result of the rapid growth of population in the two valleys over the previous twenty years. During the 1880s the demand for working men representatives in the ranks of the Parliamentary Liberal Party were increasingly vociferous and there was a precedent for a Liberal-Labour (Lib-Lab) candidate in South Wales as Thomas Halliday had contested Merthyr Tydfil in 1874.\n\nThe local trade union, the Rhondda Steam Coal Miners' Association, laid claim to the candidacy as early as 1883, on the basis that the franchise had been extended to many working men within the county constituencies and that in Mabon, their agent for six years they had the ideal candidate. The local Liberal Association, however, formed in early 1885,was dominated by middle-class business and professional men, and included a disproportionate number of colliery officials. . Lewis Davis of Ferndale, brother of David Davis, Maesyffynnon, one of the leading coalowners in the valley, was selected as president of the association. Ministers, including William Morris of Noddfa, Treorchy were also prominent. At a meeting in April 1885 six names were put forward as possible candidates for the nomination, including Lewis Davis, Mabon and Alfred Thomas, a leading figure in the municipal life of Cardiff. Shortly afterwards, Lewis Davis was invited by the Association to be its parliamentary candidate and defeated Mabon in a ballot by 143 votes to 51. In spite of his selection, however, he declined and proposed that his son, the 22-year-old Frederick Lewis Davis, be the candidate. In a further ballot, F.L. Davis again defeated Mabon by 125 votes to 56.\n\nThe refusal of the trade union movement to accept this decision and to support an independent campaign by Mabon is regarded as an important watershed in the political history of South Wales. In terms of policy there was little apparent difference between the candidates, with the only notable difference being that Mabon supported the payment of MPs while Davis did not. The campaign was therefore waged on other grounds. Davis's supporters claimed that Mabon lacked legitimacy, having been rejected by the Liberal Association. Mabon's adherents, in turn, claimed that the miners' had held mass meetings throughout the two valleys to promote his candidature long before the middle-class-dominated Association was established. Davis's youth and inexperience was a major issue, although he had qualified as a barrister. There were also claims of intimidation on both sides. Mabon's supporters were said to be victimised at the workplace while several of Davis's meetings were disrupted by violence.\n\nClass therefore became a major issue in the campaign. The vast majority of Mabon' supporters were trade union activists and working men, along with a relatively small number of tradesmen and professionals, some of whom had links of one form or another to the miners' union. These included Walter H. Morgan of Pontypridd, often described as the miners' lawyer. One nonconformist minister, supported Mabon, namely John Salisbury Edwards of Treorchy. In contest, Davis had the support of the vast majority of the middle-classes in the Rhondda, and natural deference together with the paternalistic influence of the Davis family, in the Rhondda Fach in particular, was a factor.\n\nOn polling day, Mabon scored a clear and decisive victory.\n\nDespite the fierce contest the two wings of the Liberal Party in the Rhondda were soon reconciled. After the result, the Davis family accepted Mabon's victory and he was not challenged thereafter for the parliamentary seat. Following the election, Mabon's supporters established the Rhondda Labour and Liberal Association which shortly afterwards absorbed the rival Liberal Association which had supported Davis. Mabon was returned unopposed the following year.\n\nThe seat saw the fewest Conservative votes on mainland Great Britain in 2017, 22 fewer than in Manchester Gorton; likewise as to the Liberal Democrat votes, 18 votes fewer than in Blaenau Gwent.\n\nOf the 56 rejected ballots:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1808199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808199", "title": "Rhondda", "text": "Rhondda\n\nRhondda , or the Rhondda Valley ( ), is a former coal mining area in South Wales, previously in Glamorgan, and now a local government district, of 16 communities around the River Rhondda. The Rhondda is actually two valleys – the larger Rhondda Fawr valley (\"mawr\" large) and the smaller Rhondda Fach valley (\"bach\" small) – so that the singular \"Rhondda Valley\" and the plural are both commonly used. In 2001, the Rhondda constituency of the National Assembly for Wales had a population of 72,443; while the National Office of Statistics counted the population as 59,602. Rhondda forms part of Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough and of the South Wales Valleys. It is most noted for its historical coal-mining industry, which peaked between 1840 and 1925. The valleys produced a strong early Nonconformist Christian movement manifest in the Baptist chapels that moulded Rhondda values in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It is also famous for strong masculine cultural ties exemplified in its male voice choirs, sport and politics.\n\nThe larger of the two valleys, the Rhondda Fawr, extends from Porth and rises through the valley until it reaches Blaenrhondda, near Treherbert. The settlements that make up the Rhondda Fawr are as follows:\n\nThe Rhondda Fach is celebrated in the 1971 David Alexander song 'If I could see the Rhondda'; the valley includes Wattstown, Ynyshir, Pontygwaith, Ferndale, Tylorstown and Maerdy. The settlements that make up the Rhondda Fach are as follows:\n\nIn the early Middle Ages, Glynrhondda was a commote of the cantref of Penychen in the kingdom of Morgannwg, a sparsely populated agricultural area. The spelling of the commote varied widely, as the Cardiff Records show:\n\nMany sources state the meaning of Rhondda as \"noisy\", though this is a simplified translation without research. Sir Ifor Williams, in his work \"Enwau Lleoedd\", suggests that the first syllable \"rhawdd\" is a form of the Welsh \"adrawdd\" or \"adrodd\", as in \"recite, relate, recount\", similar to the Old Irish \"rád\"; 'speech'. The suggestion is that the river is speaking aloud, a comparison to the English expression \"a babbling brook\".\n\nWith the increase in population from the mid-19th century the area was officially recognised as the Ystradyfodwg Local Government District, but was renamed in 1897 as the Rhondda Urban District after the River Rhondda.\n\nResidents of either valley rarely use the terms Rhondda Fach or Rhondda Fawr, referring instead to the Rhondda, or their specific village when relevant. Locals tend to refer to \"The Rhondda\" with a definite article not found on signposts and maps.\n\nThe Rhondda Valley is located in the upland, or Blaenau, area of Glamorgan. The landscape of the Rhondda was formed by glacial action during the last ice age, as slow-moving glaciers gouged out the deep valleys that exist today. With the retreat of the ice sheet, around 8000 BC, the valleys were further modified by stream and river action. This left the two river valleys of the Rhondda with narrow, steep-sided slopes which would dictate the layout of settlements from early to modern times.\n\nThe earliest evidence of man's presence in these upper areas of Glamorgan was found in 1963 at Craig y Llyn. A small chipped stone tool found at the site, recorded as possibly being of Creswellian type or at least from the early Mesolithic period, places human activity on the plateau above the valleys. Many other Mesolithic items have appeared in the Rhondda, mainly in the upper areas around Blaenrhondda, Blaencwm and Maerdy, and relating to hunting, fishing and foraging, which suggests seasonal nomadic activity. Though no definite Mesolithic settlements have been located, the concentration of finds at the Craig y Llyn escarpment suggests the presence of a temporary campsite in the vicinity.\n\nThe first structural relic of prehistoric man was excavated in 1973 at Cefn Glas near the watershed of the Rhondda Fach river. The remains of a rectangular hut with traces of drystone wall foundations and postholes was discovered; while carbon dating of charcoal found at the site dated the structure as late Neolithic.\n\nAlthough little evidence of settlement has been found in the Rhondda for the Neolithic to Bronze Age periods, several cairns and cists have appeared throughout the length of both valleys. The best example of a round-cairn was found at Crug yr Afan, near the summit of Graig Fawr, west of Cwmparc. It consisted of an earthen mound with a surrounding ditch 28 metres in circumference and over 2 metres tall. Although most cairns discovered in the area are round, a ring cairn or cairn circle exists on Gelli Mountain. Known as the Rhondda Stonehenge, it consists of ten upright stones no more than 60 cm in height, encircling a central cist. All the cairns found within the Rhondda are located on high ground, many on ridgeways, and may have been used as waypoints.\n\nIn 1912 a hoard of 24 late Bronze Age weapons and tools was discovered during construction work at the Llyn Fawr reservoir, at the source of the Rhondda Fawr. The items did not originate from the Rhondda and are thought to have been left at the site as a votive offering. Of particular interest are fragments of an iron sword, the earliest iron object to be found in Wales, and the only C-type Hallstatt sword recorded in Britain.\n\nWith the exception of the Neolithic settlement at Cefn Glas, there are three certain pre-medieval settlement sites in the valley – Maendy Camp, Hen Dre'r Gelli and Hen Dre'r Mynydd. The earliest of these is Maendy Camp, a hillfort whose remains lie between Ton Pentre and Cwmparc. Although its defences would have been slight, the camp made good use of the natural slopes and rock outcrops to its north-east face. It consisted of two earthworks: an inner and outer enclosure. When the site was excavated in 1901, several archaeological finds led to the camp being misidentified as Bronze Age. These finds, mainly pottery and flint knives, were excavated from a burial cairn discovered within the outer enclosure, but the site has since been classified as from the Iron Age.\n\nThe settlement at Hen Dre'r Mynydd in Blaenrhondda was dated around the Roman period, when fragments of wheel-made Romano-British pottery were discovered. The site consists of a group of ruinous drystone roundhouses and enclosures, thought to have been a sheep-farming community.\n\nThe most certain example of a Roman site in the area is found above Blaenllechau in Ferndale. The settlement is one of a group of earthworks and indicates the presence of the Roman army during the 1st century AD. It was thought to be a military site or marching camp.\n\nThe 5th century saw the withdrawal of Imperial Roman support from Britain, and succeeding centuries saw the emergence of national identity and of kingdoms. The area which would become the Rhondda lay within Glywysing, which incorporated the modern area of Glamorgan and was ruled by a dynasty founded by Glywys. This dynasty was replaced by another founded by Meurig ap Tewdrig, whose descendant Morgan ap Owain would give Glamorgan its Welsh name Morgannwg. With the coming of the Norman overlords after the 1066 Battle of Hastings, south-east Wales was divided into five cantrefi. The Rhondda lay within Penychen, a narrow strip running between modern-day Glyn Neath and the coast between Cardiff and Aberthaw. Each cantref was further divided into commotes, with Penychen made up of five such commotes, one being Glynrhondda.\n\nRelics of the Dark Ages are rare in the Glamorgan area and secular monuments still rarer. The few sites found have been located in the \"Bro\", or lowlands, leaving historians to believe the Blaenau were sparsely inhabited, maybe only visited seasonally by pastoralists. A few earthwork dykes are the only structural relics in the Rhondda area from this period. No carved stones or crosses exist to indicate the presence of a Christian shrine. In the Early Middle Ages, communities were split between bondmen, who lived in small villages centred on a court or \"llys\" of the local ruler to whom they paid dues, and freemen, with higher status, who lived in scattered homesteads. The most important village was the mayor's settlement or \"maerdref\". Maerdy in the Rhondda Fach has been identified as such, mainly on the strength of the name, though the village did not survive past the Middle Ages. The largest concentration of dwellings from the period, mainly platform houses, have been found around Gelli and Ystrad in the Rhondda Fawr.\n\nDuring the late 11th century, the Norman lord, Robert Fitzhamon entered Morgannwg in an attempt to gain control of the area, building many earth and timber castles in the lowlands. In the early 12th century Norman expansion continued, with castles being founded around Neath, Kenfig and Coity. In the same period Bishop Urban set up the Diocese of Llandaff under which Glynrhondda belonged to the large parish of Llantrisant.\n\nAfter the death of William, Lord of Glamorgan, his extensive holdings were eventually granted to Gilbert de Clare in 1217. The subjugation of Glamorgan, begun by Fitzhamon, was completed by the powerful De Clare family. Although Gilbert de Clare had now become one of the great Marcher Lords, the territory was far from settled. Hywel ap Maredudd, lord of Meisgyn captured his cousin Morgan ap Cadwallon and annexed Glynrhondda in an attempt to reunify the commotes under a single native ruler. This conflict was unresolved by the time of De Clare's death and the area fell under royal control.\n\nLittle evidence exists of settlements within the Rhondda in the Norman period. Unlike the communal dwellings of the Iron Age, the remains of medieval buildings discovered in the area follow a pattern similar to modern farmsteads, with separate holdings spaced out around the hillsides. The evidence of medieval Welsh farmers comes from remains of their buildings, with the foundations of platform houses being discovered spaced out through both valleys. When the sites of several platform houses at Gelligaer Common were excavated in the 1930s, potsherds from the 13th to 14th centuries were discovered.\n\nThe Rhondda also has remains of two medieval castles. The older is Castell Nos, located at the head of the Rhondda Fach overlooking Maerdy. The only recorded evidence of Castle Nos is a mention by John Leland, who stated, \"Castelle Nose is but a high stony creg in the top of an hille\". The castle comprises a scarp and ditch forming a raised platform and on the north face is a ruined dry-stone building. Its location and form do not appear to be Norman and it is thought to have been built by the Welsh as a border defence, which would date it before 1247, when Richard de Clare seized Glynrhondda. The second castle is Ynysygrug, close to what is now Tonypandy town centre. Little remains of this motte-and-bailey earthwork defence, as much was destroyed when Tonypandy railway station was built in the 19th century. Ynysygrug is dated around the 12th or early 13th century and has been misidentified by several historians, notably Owen Morgan in his \"History of Pontypridd and Rhondda Valleys\", who recorded it as a druidic sacred mound. Iolo Morganwg erroneously believed it to be the burial mound of king Rhys ap Tewdwr.\n\nThe earliest Christian monument in the Rhondda is the shrine of St Mary at Penrhys, whose holy well was mentioned by Rhisiart ap Rhys in the 15th century.\n\nIn the mid-16th century the Rhondda, then known as the Vale of Rotheney, belonged to the large but sparsely inhabited parish of Ystradyfodwg, St Tyfodwg's Vale. For administrative purposes the parish was divided into three hamlets: the upper or Rhigos hamlet to the north, the middle or Penrhys hamlet, and the lower or Clydach hamlet. Throughout the post-medieval period the Rhondda was a heavily wooded area and its main economic staple was the rearing of sheep, horses and cattle. The historian Rice Merrick, in describing the upland area of the Vale of Glamorgan, stated that there \"was always great breeding of cattle, horses and sheep; but in elder time therein grew but small store of corn, for in most places there the ground was not thereunto apt.\" The English cartographer John Speed described the rearing of cattle as the \"best means unto wealth that the Shire doth afford.\" As there was no fair held in the Rhondda the animals would be taken to neighbouring fairs and markets at Neath, Merthyr, Llantrisant, Ynysybwl and Llandaff. However, to be self-supporting, the farmers of the area grew crops such as oats, corn and barley in small quantities. Crops were grown in the lower part of the Rhondda on narrow meadows adjoining the riversides, though during the Napoleonic Wars scarce supplies forced the cultivation of the upland areas such as Carn-y-wiwer and Penrhys. Merrick would describe the diet of the upland inhabitants as consisting of \"bread made of wheat ... and ale and bear\" \"[sic]\" and over two hundred years later Benjamin Malkin showed how little the diet had changed when he wrote that the people still ate \"oatmeal bread, with a relish of miserable cheese; and the beer, where they have any, is worse than none.\"\n\nIn the first half of the 17th century, rising costs of consumable goods and successive bad harvests brought economic change in Glamorgan. Those wealthy enough could seize opportunities created by the unsettled conditions and set about enlarging and enclosing farmlands. The enclosure of freehold lands begun in the later Middle Ages now gained momentum and farms once owned by individual farmers passed to groups of wealthy landowners. By the 19th century, most Rhondda farms and estates were owned by absentee landlords such as the Marquis of Bute, Earl of Dunraven, Crawshay Bailey of Merthyr and the De Winton family of Brecon.\n\nThe Acts of Union in the mid-16th century and the English Civil War in the mid-17th century brought much rebuilding in the Kingdom of England, to which Wales was now annexed. This appears in the structures built in the Rhondda Valley. The fluctuating economy of the late Tudor period resulted in farmers taking in more land, creating higher levels of surplus goods and so producing higher profits. These were reflected in new farmhouses built in the Rhondda and for the first time an emphasis on domestic comfort apparent in the design of dwellings. Many new farm buildings were simple structures of two or three small rooms, but of a much sturdier,more permanent quality than the medieval platform houses. A popular style was the Dartmoor longhouse, which combined the house and cowshed into one building. By 1840, the Rhondda had at least 160 farms, but most were destroyed with the growth of the mining industry. Of the few survivors, those of note include Tynewydd ('New House') in Tynewydd, a 17th-century house thought to have given its name to the neighbouring village of Tynewydd and of Tyntyle in Ystrad dated around 1600.\n\nThere were few industrial buildings before 1850; those of note include a 17th-century blast furnace at Pontygwaith which gave the village its name. and a fulling mill established by Harri David in 1738, which in turn gave its name to Tonypandy. Corn mills existed sparsely throughout the valleys, as did early coal pits, two being recorded as opening in 1612 at Rhigos and Cwmparc, though they would have been open-cast, not deep mined.\n\nThe South Wales coalfield is the largest continuous coalfield in Britain, extending some from Pontypool in the east to St Brides Bay in the West, covering almost . This took in most of Glamorgan and the entirety of the Rhondda within it. Although neighbouring areas such as Merthyr and Aberdare had already sunk coal mines, it was not until Walter Coffin initiated the Dinas Lower Colliery in 1812 that coal was exported from the Rhondda Valleys on any commercial scale. This was originally taken by packhorse, before the extension of Dr. Griffiths' private tramline, to Pontypridd and then by the Glamorganshire Canal to the port at Cardiff. The lack of transportation links was one of the main problems that curtailed exploitation of the Rhondda Valley coalfields, along with the belief that they lay too deep for economic working. It was therefore seen as an expensive risk. Exploration of the Rhondda was undertaken by the Bute Trustees, agents of the third Marquess of Bute, who not only owned large tracts of valley farmland but also possessed a large financial interest in the Cardiff Docks which would export the coal. The trustees sank the Bute Merthyr Colliery in October 1851, at the top of the Rhondda Fawr in what would become Treherbert. The Bute Merthyr began producing coal in 1855, as the first working steam-coal colliery in the Rhondda.\n\nAlong with the sinking of the first colliery at the head of the Rhondda, a second issue, transportation, was tackled with the extension of the Taff Vale Railway (TVR); royal assent was given in 1836. The original line was laid from Cardiff to Abercynon, and by 1841 a branch was opened to link Cardiff with Dinas via Pontypridd. This allowed easier transportation for Walter Coffin's Dinas mine, an unsurprising addition, as Coffin was a director of the TVR. In 1849 the TVR extended into the Rhondda Fach and by 1856 the railway had reached the furthest areas of the Fach and Fawr valleys at Maerdy and Treherbert. For the first time, the Rhondda Valley was linked by a major transportation route to the rest of Wales and exploitation of its coalfields could begin.\n\nThe TVR line dominated coal transportation through the Rhondda's industrial history. Its monopoly was a bone of contention: the absence of rivals precluded colliery owners from negotiating lower haulage rates. Attempts were made to break the monopoly included the opening of the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway between 1885 and 1895, which linked Blaenrhondda at the head of the Rhondda Fawr to the Prince of Wales Dock. To achieve this the Rhondda Tunnel was dug through Mynydd Blaengwynfy to Blaengwynfi – at the time the longest railway tunnel in Wales.\n\nInitially the shallower pits at Aberdare proved a bigger attraction to prospective mine owners, but once Aberdare became fully worked by the 1860s, the Rhondda saw rapid growth. During the 1860s and the 1870s, 20 Rhondda Valley collieries opened, with the leading owner in the Rhondda Fach being David Davis of Aberdare, and David Davies in the Rhondda Fawr. In 1865 the coal output from the Rhondda Valley was roughly one-quarter of that of Aberdare; ten years later the Rhondda was producing over two million tons more than the Aberdare valleys. These figures would later be dwarfed by massive excavation rates in the last quarter of the 19th century and up to the First World War. In 1913, Rhondda Valley output was 9.6 million tons.\n\nBy 1893 there were more than 75 collieries in the Rhondda Valleys. Initially most were owned by a small group of individuals, but the trend changed towards the start of the 20th century, as companies began buying up existing collieries. The widespread adoption of limited liability status began a trend towards concentration of ownership, reducing some of the economic risks involved in coal mining: unstable coal prices, inflated acquisitions, geological difficulties, and large-scale accidents. The emerging companies were formed by the individuals and families who sank the original collieries, but by the start of the 20th century they were no more than principal shareholders. The firms included the Davies's Ocean Coal Company, Archibald Hood's Glamorgan Coal Company and David Davis & Son.\n\nDuring the early to mid-19th century, the Rhondda valleys were inhabited by small farming settlements. In 1841 the parish of Ystradyfodwg, which would later constitute most of the Rhondda Borough, recorded a population of less than a thousand. With the discovery of massive deposits of high quality, accessible coal in the mid-19th century, the valleys experienced a large influx of financial immigrants. The first came to the lower Rhondda villages of Dinas, Eirw and Cymmer. Special sinkers came from Llansamlet, while the first miners were from Penderyn, Cwmgwrach and neighbouring areas of Llantrisant and Llanharan. The 1851 Census lists apprenticed paupers from Temple Cloud in Somerset, some of the earliest English immigrants. From a mere 951 in 1851, the population of Ystradyfodwg parish grew to 16,914 in 1871. By 1901 the Rhondda Urban District had a population of 113,735. As more and more coal mines were sunk the population grew to fill the jobs needed to extract the coal. In the 1860s and 1870s the majority came from neighbouring Welsh counties, but with the improving rail transportation and cheaper transport, immigrants came from further afield. The 1890s recorded workers from the South West, places such as Gloucester and Devon, and by the 1900s people came from North Wales, the lead-mining area of Anglesey and the depressed slate-quarrying villages of Bethesda, Ffestiniog and Dinorwig. Although there are records of Scottish workers, mainly centred on Archibald Hood's Llwynypia mines, there were only small numbers of Irish, less than 1,000 by 1911. This absence is often blamed on the forcible ejection of the Irish who lived in Treherbert during three days of rioting in 1857. The population of the valleys peaked in 1924 at over 167,900 inhabitants.\n\nThe mass immigration in the period was almost entirely from other parts of Wales and from England. A notable exception was a group of Italian immigrants, originally from northern Italy round the town of Bardi. In the late 19th century, they were forced out of London by over-saturation of the market, and instead set up a network of cafés, ice cream parlours and fish & chip shops throughout South Wales. These became iconic landmarks in the villages they served and they and subsequent generations became Welsh Italians. Peculiar to the Rhondda was that shops run by Italian immigrants were known as bracchis, believed to have been named after Angelo Bracchi, who opened the first café there in the early 1890s. In the early 21st century several of the Rhondda's original bracchis were still open for business.\n\nAt the start of the First World War, the economic prospects in South Wales were good. Although production fell after the 1913 high, demand was still strong enough to push the coalfields to their limit. In February 1917 coal mining came under government control and demand increased as the war intensified, ensuring a market for sufficient supplies. After the war the picture began to change. Initially the British coal industry was buoyed by a series of fortuitous economic events, such as the American coal miners' strike, and by 1924 unemployment for miners was below the national average. But the belief that the mining industry would experience a permanent demand for coal was shattered by the Depression, when the Rhondda experienced a massive increase in unemployment. The situation worsened in 1926, when in response to coalowners reducing pay and lengthening working hours of miners, the TUC called a general strike in defence of the miners locked out following A. J. Cook's call \"not a penny off the pay, not a minute on the day\". The TUC called off the strike just nine days later, without resolving the miners' cut in wages. The miners disagreed and stayed on strike for a further seven months until they were starved into surrender. The Rhondda saw many schemes set up by miners to aid their plight, such as soup kitchens and fêtes and \"joy\" days to support them, while in Maerdy the local miners set up a rationing system. By the time the miners returned to work, there was little desire for further action, which saw a decline in the popularity of 'The Fed' and greater emphasis on solving problems by political and parliamentary means.\n\nWith the Great Depression, employment in the Rhondda Valleys continued to fall. This in turn led to a decline in public and social services, as people struggled to pay rates and rents. One outcome of the lack of funds was a fall in health provisions, which in Rhondda lead to a shortage of medical and nursing staff, a failure to provide adequate sewage works, and a rise in deaths from tuberculosis. By 1932 the long-term unemployment figure in the Rhondda was put at 63 per cent, and in Ferndale at almost 73 per cent.\n\nWith little other employment available in the Rhondda, the only solution appeared to be emigration. Between 1924 and 1939, 50,000 people left the Rhondda. During this time life was difficult for communities built solely around a singular industry, especially as most families were on a single wage.\n\nThe start of the Second World War saw a turnaround in the employment figures, and by 1944 unemployment figures in the Rhondda ranged from 1 per cent in Treorchy to 3.7 per cent at Tonypandy.\n\nThe possibility of serious injury or death was an everyday risk for the mine workers of the Rhondda Valley. The most notorious form of colliery disaster was the gas explosion, caused by a buildup either of methane gas or coal dust. As mines became deeper and ventilation harder to control, the risk increased. The worst single incident in the Rhondda was the 1867 Ferndale disaster, when an explosion took 178 lives. However, the major disasters accounted for only about a fifth of the overall fatalities. The list below shows mining accidents involving the loss of five or more lives in a single incident.\n\nThe coal mining industry of the Rhondda was artificially buoyed in the war years and there were expectations of a return to the pre-1939 industrial collapse after the end of the Second World War. There was a sense of salvation when the government announced the nationalisation of the British coal mines in 1947, but subsequent decades saw continual output reductions. From 15,000 miners in 1947, Rhondda had just a single pit within the valleys producing coal in 1984, located at Maerdy. The decline in coal mining after World War II was a countrywide issue, but South Wales and Rhondda were more gravely affected than other areas. Oil had superseded coal as the fuel of choice in many industries and there was political pressure behind the oil supply. From the few industries still reliant on coal, the demand was for high quality, especially coking coal for the steel industry. By then, 50 per cent of Glamorgan coal was supplied to steelworks, with the second biggest market being domestic heating: the \"smokeless\" fuel of the Rhondda became once again fashionable after publication of the Clean Air Act. These two markets controlled the fate of the mines in the Rhondda, and as demand fell from both, the effect was further contraction. In addition, exports to other areas of Europe such as France, Italy and the Low Countries experienced sharp decline: from 33 per cent of output around the start of the 20th century to some 5 per cent by 1980.\n\nOther major factors in the decline of coal related to massive under-investment in the Rhondda mines over the previous decades. Most mines in the valleys had been sunk between the 1850s and 1880s, so that they were far smaller than most modern mines. The Rhondda mines were comparatively antiquated in their methods of ventilation, coal-preparation and power supply. In 1945 the British coal industry was cutting 72 per cent of its output mechanically, whereas in South Wales the figure was just 22 per cent. The only way to ensure financial survival of the mines in the valleys was massive investment by the NCB, but its \"Plan for Coal\" paper drawn up in 1950 was overly optimistic about future demand, which was drastically reduced after an industrial recession in 1956 and with increased availability of oil.\n\nBritish and Welsh employment bodies funded and subsidised external businesses to locate replacement ventures in the valleys. The first attempt to bring in business unconnected to coal began in the 1920s, when David Jones, Town Clerk of the Rhondda Urban Council, gained government support for so doing. Arrivals included Alfred Polikoff's clothing factory, Messrs Jacob Beatus manufacturing cardboard boxes, and Electrical and Musical Industries Ltd. After the Second World War, 23 firms were set up in the Rhondda Valleys, 18 of them sponsored by the Board of Trade. Most had periods of growth followed by collapse, notably Thorn EMI in the 1970s and Burberry in the 2000s. \n\nThe Rhondda Heritage Park, a museum marking Rhondda's industrial past, lies just south of Porth in the former Lewis Merthyr Colliery at Trehafod.\n\nThe commote of Glynrhondda was coterminous with the earlier parish of Ystradyfodwg, but little is known of the Celtic saint Tyfodwg, or Dyfodwg, after whom the parish is named. He is thought to have lived around AD 600. Although the parish bears his name, there are now no religious monuments or places of worship named after him within the Rhondda boundaries, although two churches outside the area are named after him: Y Tre Sant in Llantrisant and Saint Tyfodwg’s in Ogmore Vale.\n\nThe earliest known religious monument is the Catholic holy well in Penrhys first mentioned in the 15th century, though it may have been a place of pagan worship before. This pilgrimage site was identified as a manor belonging to the Cistercian Abbey of Llantarnam and was seen as one of the most important religious sites in Wales, due to its Marian shrine. This holy site was the main reason people would pass through the commote; it was even thought to be the main reason why the first bridges were built over the River Rhondda.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the parish church of Ystradyfodwg near the bank of the River Rhondda served the parishioners of the Rhondda Fawr, while the families of the Rhondda Fach attended Llanwynno Church. The inhabitants of the lower Rhondda, in the vicinity of Porth and Dinas, needed to reach Llantrisant to hear a service.\n\nDespite the importance of the Anglican Church to parishioners, the growing strength of Nonconformity made itself felt in the 18th century. In 1738 the Reverend Henry Davies formed the Independent Cause in Cymmer and five years later a Ty Cwrdd or meeting house was opened there. Although attracting families from as far away as Merthyr and the parish of Eglwysilan, there were no other Nonconformist Causes until David Williams began preaching in the Rhondda in 1784. In 1785 six people were baptised in the river near Melin-yr-Om and in 1786 Ynysfach was opened in Ystrad as \"a new house for religious services\". This was the first Baptist chapel in the Rhondda and later became known as Nebo, Ystrad Rhondda. Cymmer and Ynysfach chapel would be the forerunners in a new religious movement in the valley for the next 150 years. In the early 19th century there were only three places of worship in the Rhondda; the parish church (now dedicated to St John the Baptist) and the Cymmer and Ynysfach chapels. This changed rapidly after 1855 as coal mining brought an influx of population, and by 1905 there were 151 chapels in the valley.\n\nChapel life was central to valley life throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but as with many communities throughout Britain, the post-war periods saw a decline in regular membership. To an extent the number of places of worship declined with the population, but this was exacerbated in the Rhondda by a swift decline in the number of Welsh speakers. Welsh-language chapels in particular saw a sharp drop in membership from the 1950s, and many closed in the next half-century. By 1990 the Rhondda had less than 50 places of worship and many premises had been demolished.\n\nPolitical activism in the Rhondda has deep links with trade unions and the socialist movement, but was initially slow to develop. In the 1870s the Amalgamated Association of Miners won support, but was destroyed by employer hostility. The Cambrian Miners' Association was more successful and the creation of the South Wales Miners' Federation after the 1898 coal strike gave South Wales miners a reputation for militancy, in which the Rhondda Valley played its part.\n\nAs part of the Redistribution Act of 1885 the Rhondda was granted its first seat in Parliament, which was won by a moderate trade union leader, William Abraham, who was notably the only working-class member elected in Wales. Socialism and syndicalism grew in the 20th century and industrial struggle reached a crescendo in the 1910–1911 Tonypandy riots. A year later Tonypandy saw the publication of Noah Ablett's pamphlet \"The Miners' Next Step\". Tonypandy was at the centre of further public disorder, when on 11 June 1936 at Dewinton Field, a crowd gathered to confront an open-air address by Tommy Moran, propaganda officer of the British Union of Fascists. The crowd, recorded as 2,000–6,000 strong, turned violent and police had to protect Moran's Blackshirt bodyguard. Seven local people were arrested.\n\nThe Rhondda also has a strong history of communist sympathy, with the Rhondda Socialist Society being a key element in the coalition that founded the Communist Party of Great Britain. By 1936 there were seven communists on Rhondda Urban District Council and the branch was publishing its own newspaper \"The Vanguard\". In the 1930s Maerdy became such a hotspot of communist support known as \"Little Moscow\" producing left-wing activists such as Merthyr born Arthur Horner and Marxist writer Lewis Jones. The Rhondda miners were also active in socialist activities outside the valleys. In the 1920s and 1930s the Rhondda and the surrounding valleys provided the principal support of some of the largest hunger marches, while in 1936 more Rhondda Federation members were serving in Spain as part of the International Brigades than the total number of volunteers from all the English coalfields.\n\nIn 1979, Rhondda councillor Annie Powell became Wales' only communist mayor.\n\nWith an economy largely dependent on a single industry, there was a scarcity of jobs for women in Rhondda's coalmining heyday. The Encyclopaedia of Wales notes that the image of the Welsh Mam, a wife and mother constantly at home and exalted as the queen of the household, was essentially a Rhondda creation. However the Rhondda did produce the suffragette and social reformer Elizabeth Andrews, one of only nine women among a list of a hundred great Welsh heroes chosen by ballot in 2004.\n\nSocial amenities were rudimentary even before the Rhondda Urban District Council was formed in 1897. Due to the geographic layout of the valleys, land was a scarce resource, and so leisure pursuits that took up little space, time and money were sought. This resulted in activities such as greyhound racing, cockfighting, open-air handball (often attached to a public house), boxing, foot racing and rugby union.\nDuring the mid-19th century the influx of immigrants from older mining towns such as Aberdare and Merthyr brought the game of rugby with them. At Treherbert it took a five-month lockout in 1875 to see the game establish itself at the various collieries where the Amalgamated Association of Miners held their meetings. In 1877 Penygraig Rugby Football Club was formed, followed by Treherbert in 1879, Ferndale in 1882, Treorchy in 1886 and Tylorstown in 1903. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the \"Rhondda forward\" was a key player in many Wales teams. The heavy industrial worker was a prime aggressive attack figure in early Welsh packs, typified by the likes of Treherbert's Dai 'Tarw' (bull) Jones who at 6-foot 1 inch (185.5 cm) and in weight was seen as an animal of a man.\n\nThe lack of playing fields in the valleys meant many rugby teams shared grounds, travelled every week to away grounds, or even played on inappropriate sloping pitches. The valley clubs had no clubhouses, with most teams meeting and changing in the closest local public house. Many clubs built around colliery and pub teams appeared and disbanded, but many others survive to this day.\n\nDue to the dominance of rugby union, there have been few football teams of note in the history of the Rhondda Valleys. Several teams were formed around the end of the 19th century, but most folded in the Depression, including Cwmparc F.C. in 1926 and Mid-Rhondda in 1928. The area's most successful club is Ton Pentre F.C.\n\nThe temperance movement, absorbed into the moralistic system of the Nonconformist chapels, caused a shift in social attitudes in the mid to late-19th and early 20th century Rhondda. Alcohol was looked down on and so were the increasingly violent sports such as rugby, so that many young men sought more acceptable pastimes. Voice choirs were a natural progression from chapel society and brass bands eventually gained acceptance by the movement.\n\nThe male-voice choirs of Welsh industrial communities are believed to have derived from glee clubs. The Rhondda produced several choirs of note, including the Rhondda Glee Society, which represented Wales at the World Fair eisteddfod. The rival Treorchy Male Voice Choir also enjoyed success at eisteddfodau, and in 1895, the original choir sang before Queen Victoria. Many choirs still exist, including the Cambrian Male voice choir in Tonypandy and the Cor Meibion Morlais in Ferndale.\n\nThe mid-19th century brass bands had a poor relationship with the Nonconformist chapels, mainly due to the heavy social drinking that came hand in hand with being a member. This changed towards the end of the 19th century, when on becoming more respectable, many bands had actually joined the temperance movement. Two Rhondda brass bands which both started as temperance bands are the Cory Band from Ton Pentre, who started life as \"Ton Temperance\" in 1884; and the Parc and Dare Band, formerly the \"Cwmparc Drum and Fife Temperance Band\". The oldest in Rhondda is the Lewis-Merthyr Band, formerly Cymmer Colliery Band, founded as the Cymmer Military Band in or before 1855.\n\nAs the temperance movement faded, the bands found new benefactors in the colliery owners and many took on the names of specific collieries. A memorable image of the connection between the collieries and brass bands came in 1985, when the Maerdy miners were filmed returning to work after the miners' strike, marching behind the village band.\n\nTom Jones, David Alexander and Paul Child have been among those who sang songs about the Rhondda.\n\nFor most of its history, the Rhondda valleys were an exclusively Welsh-speaking area. Only in the early 20th century did English began to supplant Welsh as the first language of social intercourse. In 1803, English historian Benjamin Heath Malkin mentioned that while travelling through Ystradyfodwg he had met only one person with whom he could talk, and then with the help of an interpreter. This experience was repeated by John George Wood, who on a visit complained of the awkwardness of understanding the particular dialects and idioms used by the native speakers, which were difficult for other Welsh speakers to understand. This dialect was once called \"tafodiaith gwŷr y Gloran\" (the dialect of Gloran men).\n\nAs industrialisation began, there was still little shift in the use of Welsh. Initial immigrants were Welsh: it was not until the 1900s that English workers began settling in any great numbers, and in any case it was not these new workers who changed the language. The erosion of Welsh had begun in the 1860s in the school classrooms. The educational philosophy accepted by schoolmasters and governmental administrators was that English was the language of scholars and Welsh a barrier to moral and commercial prosperity. In 1901, 35.4 per cent of Rhondda workers spoke only English, but by 1911 this had risen to 43.1 per cent, while Welsh-speaking monoglots had fallen from 11.4 to 4.4 per cent in the same period.\n\nThorough anglicization of the Rhondda Valleys took place between 1900 to 1950. Improved transport and communications facilitated the spread of cultural influences, along with dealings with outside companies with no understanding of Welsh, trade union meetings being held in English, and the coming of radio, cinema and then television and cheap English newspapers and paperback books. All these were factors in the absorption of the English language.\n\nThough the population of the Rhondda was embracing English as its first language, a literary and intellectual movement formed in the Rhondda in the 1940s that would produce an influential group of Welsh language writers. The group formed during the Second World War by Egyptologist J. Gwyn Griffiths and his German wife Käthe Bosse-Griffiths was known as the Cadwgan Circle () and met at the Griffiths' house in Pentre. Welsh writers who made up the movement included Pennar Davies, Rhydwen Williams, James Kitchener Davies and Gareth Alban Davies.\nThe Rhondda has hosted the National Eisteddfod on only one occasion, in 1928 at Treorchy. The Gorsedd stones that were placed to mark the event still stand on the Maindy hillside overlooking Treorchy and Cwmparc. In 1947 Treorchy held the Urdd National Eisteddfod for children and young adults.\n\nRhondda had a strong tradition of communal activity, exemplified by workmen's halls, miners' institutes and trade unions. Miners began to contribute to the building and running of institutes - such as the Parc and Dare Hall in Treorchy – from the 1890s onwards, and were centres of entertainment and self-improvement, with billiards halls, libraries and reading rooms.\n\nIn 1884 the Rhondda Valley had a local newspaper, the \"Rhondda Chronicle\", which became the \"Rhondda Gazette and General Advertiser of the Rhondda Fach and Ogmore Valleys\" in 1891. In 1899, the Rhondda Valley was served by the \"Pontypridd and Rhondda Weekly Post\" while the \"Rhondda Post\" was also in circulation in 1898.\n\nThe \"Rhondda Leader\", one of the more familiar local papers, appeared in 1899 and nine years later became the \"Rhondda Leader, Maesteg, Garw and Ogmore Telegraph\". The \"Porth Gazette\" was published from 1900 to 1944, and during that period there was a newspaper called the \"Rhondda Socialist\". The \"Rhondda Gazette\" was in circulation from 1913 to 1919, while the \"Rhondda Clarion\" was available in the late 1930s.\n\nThe \"Porth Gazette and Rhondda Leader\" was published from 1944 to 1967. Also published in Pontypridd during that period was the \"Rhondda Fach Leader and Gazette\". In more recent years the \"Rhondda Leader\" and \"Pontypridd & Llantrisant Observer\" combined, before the \"Rhondda Leader\" became separate once more.\n\nIn August 1952 the BBC transmitter at Wenvoe began broadcasting, allowing the Rhondda to receive television pictures for the first time. This was followed in January 1958 by commercial television from Television Wales and the West (TWW), giving Rhondda viewers a choice of two channels.\n\nThe geological layout of the Rhondda Valley has led to restrictive transport links. The original road layout followed the valleys, with few links between them. In the 1920s, a major unemployment relief programme for out-of-work miners was created to build mountain roads connecting them. These had a lasting effect and transformed the valleys from being dead-end communities. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, new road projects such as the Rhondda by-pass were created out of former railway lines.\n\nTwo main roads service the area. The A4058 runs through the Rhondda Fawr and the A4233 services the Rhondda Fach. The A4058 starts at Pontypridd runs through Porth before ending at Treorchy, where it joins the A4061 to Hirwaun. The A4233 begins outside Rhondda at Tonyrefail, heading north through Porth and through the Rhondda Fach to Maerdy, where the road links up with the A4059 at Aberdare. Two other A roads service the area; the A4119 is a relief road known as the Tonypandy Bypass; the other is the A4061, which links Treorchy to the Ogmore Vale before reaching Bridgend.\n\nThere is a single rail link to the Rhondda, the Rhondda Line, based around the old Taff Vale Railway, which serviced both the Rhondda Fach and Rhondda Fawr. The Rhondda Line runs through the Rhondda Fawr, linking Rhondda to Cardiff Central. The railway stations that once populated the Rhondda Fach were all closed under the Beeching Axe. The railway line serves ten Rhondda stations with the villages not directly linked connected through bus services.\n\nBritish Rail reopened some of the closed stations such as Ystrad Rhondda railway station in 1986.\n\nDue to the scarcity of inhabitants in the Rhondda prior to industrialisation, there are few residents of note before the valleys became a coalmining area. The earliest individuals to come to the fore were linked with the coal industry and the people; physical men who found a way out of the Rhondda through sport; and charismatic orators who led the miners through unions or political and religious leaders who tended to the deeply religious chapel going public.\n\nThe two main sports with which the Rhondda appeared to produce quality participants were rugby union and boxing. One of the first true rugby stars to come from the Rhondda was Willie Llewellyn, who not only gained 20 caps for Wales scoring 48 points but was also the first Rhondda-born member of the British Lions. Such was Llewellyn's fame that during the Tonypandy riots, his pharmacy was left unscathed by the crowds due to his past sporting duties. Many players came through the Rhondda to gain international duty, and after the split between amateur rugby union and the professional Northern League, many were also tempted to the North of England to earn a wage for their abilities. Amongst the new league players was Jack Rhapps, Aberaman-born, but living in the Rhondda when he went north, to become the world's first dual-code international rugby player.\n\nThe most famous rugby player from the Rhondda in the latter half of the 20th century is Cliff Morgan. Morgan was born in Trebanog and gained 29 caps for Wales, four for the British Lions and was one of the inaugural inductees of the International Rugby Hall of Fame. Another notable player is Billy Cleaver from Treorchy, a member of the 1950 Grand Slam winning team. Maurice Richards, born in Tynntyla Road, Ystrad Rhondda, was a Welsh international and British Lion of note, still known today for his scoring achievements playing in this code. \n\nDuring the 20th century the Rhondda supplied a steady stream of championship boxers. Percy Jones was not only the first World Champion from the Rhondda, but the first Welshman to hold a World Title when he won the Flyweight belt in 1914. After Jones came the Rhondda's most notable boxer, Jimmy Wilde, also known as the \"Mighty Atom\", who took the IBU world flyweight title in 1916. British Champions from the valleys include Tommy Farr, who held the British and Empire heavyweight belt, and Llew Edwards, who took the British featherweight and Australian lightweight titles.\n\nAlthough association football was not so popular as rugby in the Rhondda in the early 20th century, after the 1920s several notable players emerged from the area. Two of the most important came from the village of Ton Pentre; Jimmy Murphy was capped 15 times for Wales, and in 1958 managed both the Welsh national team and Manchester United. Roy Paul, also from Ton Pentre, led Manchester City to two successive FA Cup finals in 1955 and 1956 and gained 33 Welsh caps. Alan Curtis, who was best known for representing Swansea City and Cardiff City, came from the neighbouring village of Pentre, and in an 11-year international career won 35 caps for Wales, scoring six goals.\n\nThe Rhondda Valleys have produced two world-class darts players. In 1975 Alan Evans from Ferndale won the Winmau World Masters, a feat repeated in 1994 by Richie Burnett from Cwmparc. Burnett surpassed Evans when he also became BDO World Darts Champion, winning the tournament in 1995.\n\nD. A. Thomas, active in the area as an industrialist and Liberal politician, received the titles of \"Baron Rhondda\" in 1916 and \"Viscount Rhondda\" in 1918. Despite not being born in the Rhondda, the two most notable political figures to emerge from the area are William Abraham, known as Mabon, and George Thomas, Viscount Tonypandy. Abraham, best known as a trade unionist, was the first Member of Parliament of the Rhondda and the leader of the South Wales Miners' Federation. A strong negotiator in the early years of valley unionism, he lost ground as a moderate to more radical leaders in his later years. Thomas was born in Port Talbot, but raised in Trealaw near Tonypandy. He was a Member of Parliament for Cardiff for 38 years and Speaker of the House of Commons (1976–1983). On his retirement from politics, he received the title of \"Viscount Tonypandy\".\n\nLeanne Wood, the former leader of Plaid Cymru was born in the Rhondda.\n\nThe best-known actors born in the Rhondda have been Sir Stanley Baker and the brothers Donald and Glyn Houston. Baker was born in Ferndale and starred in films such as \"The Cruel Sea\" (1953) and \"Richard III\" (1955), though it was as actor/producer of the 1964 film Zulu that his legacy endures. The Houston brothers were born in Tonypandy, with Donald gaining the greater success as a film actor, with memorable roles in \"The Blue Lagoon\" (1949) and Ealing's \"Dance Hall\" (1950). Glyn Houston acted primarily in British B-Movies and was better known as a television actor.\n\nOf the Cadwgan Circle, the most notable is Rhydwen Williams, winner of the Eisteddfod Crown on two occasions, who used the landscape of the industrial valleys as a basis for much of his work. Writing in English, Peter George was born in Treorchy and is best known as the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of Dr. Strangelove, based on his book Red Alert. Reflecting the lives of the residents of the Rhondda, both Gwyn Thomas and Ron Berry brought a realism to the industrial valleys missing in the more rose-tinted writings of Richard Llewellyn.\n\nThe area has not produced as notable a group of visual artists as it has writers, though in the 1950s a small group of students, brought together through a daily commute by train to the Cardiff College of Art, came to prominence as the Rhondda Group. Although it did not set up a school or have a manifesto, the group, which included Charles Burton, Ceri Barclay, Glyn Morgan, Thomas Hughes, Gwyn Evans, Nigel Flower, David Mainwaring, Ernest Zobole and Robert Thomas, formed an important artistic movement in 20th-century Welsh art.\n\nThe notable members of the group include Ernest Zobole, a painter from Ystrad, whose expressionist work was deeply rooted in the juxtaposition of the industrialised buildings of the valleys against the green hills that surround them. Also from the Rhondda Fawr was the sculptor Robert Thomas; born in Cwmparc, his heavy-cast statues have become icons of contemporary Wales, with many of his works publicly displayed in Cardiff.\n\nIn sciences and social sciences, the Rhondda has provided important academics for Wales and on the world stage. Donald Davies, born in Treorchy in 1924, was the co-inventor of packet switching, a process enabling the exchange of information between computers, a feature which enabled the Internet.\n\nIn the social sciences, the Rhondda has produced the historian John Davies, an important voice on Welsh affairs, who was one of the most recognised faces and voices of 21st-century Welsh history, and was one of the main authors of \"The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales\". The Rhondda has also produced J. Gwyn Griffiths, an eminent Egyptologist, who was also a member of the Cadwgan Circle. Griffiths and his wife Käthe Bosse-Griffiths were influential writers and curators in the history of Egyptian lore. It is where a cluster of three internationally-distinguished social geographers spent their early lives: Michael Dear; David Hebert;; and Kelvyn Jones. All three are Fellows of the Learned Society of Wales. The political philosopher Brad Evans, who has written many books on violence and global affairs, was also born in the valleys of South Wales.\n\n\n"}

He played as a midfielder for Manchester United, and helped the club win the FA Cup in 1948 with a goal against Blackpool in the final, a match that still widely accepted as one of the finest games ever played at Wembley Stadium. Manchester United won 4-2 and this was the first of Stanley Matthews' three cup final appearances for Blackpool.

{"id": "1808209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808209", "title": "Yevgeny Leonov", "text": "Yevgeny Leonov\n\nYevgeny Pavlovich Leonov (; 2 September 1926 – 29 January 1994) was a famous Soviet and Russian actor who played main parts in several of the most famous Soviet films, such as \"Gentlemen of Fortune\", \"Mimino\" and \"Striped Trip\". Called \"one of Russia's best-loved actors\", he also provided the voice for many Soviet cartoon characters, including \"Vinny Pukh\" (\"Winnie-the-Pooh\").\n\nWhile growing up in a typical Moscow family, he dreamed of becoming a war-plane pilot, which was a very common desire of many boys of the World War II period. This is also often attributed to the fact that his father worked in an airplane factory. During the Great Patriotic War he and his whole family worked in a weapon manufacturing/aviation factory. After the war, he joined the Moscow Art Theatre school, where he studied under Mikhail Yanshin.\n\nIn his first film, Leonov was cast as an extra and did not receive any recognition. He later became Georgiy Daneliya's regular, appearing in all of his features, including \"Gentlemen of Fortune\", \"Autumn Marathon\", \"Mimino\", \"Afonya\" and \"Kin-dza-dza!\". According to the Allmovie, \"his short, round stature, expressive eyes, broad and open face, slow movements, and slightly slurred speech made him ideal for the comic roles in which he specialized\". But he also attracted critical notice for his tragic parts and the invariable naturalness of his acting. Many notable actors were said to avoid appearing in the same films with Leonov, for his natural manner of acting made them seem strained.\n\nDespite Leonov's brief appearance in Danelia's \"Autumn Marathon\" (1980) (one of his most popular films), the role won him the Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival. In \"Autumn Marathon\", it is said, Leonov brilliantly demonstrates the typical Leonov anti-hero. He gave a hilarious portrayal of a simple, nosey man who drank too much and who adored nothing more than talking nonsense as long as anyone could stand it. Among the other films he was instrumental in raising to the classic level were \"Gentlemen of Fortune\" and \"The Belorussia Station,\" both made in 1971. Like all of Leonov's movies, they are frequently rerun on television. Reportedly, \"Leonov was to Russians what Fernandel was to the French.\" He performed over 200 roles and was the Russian cinema's best-known supporting actor.\n\nIn 1991 (or in 1988), when touring in Germany, he suffered a massive heart attack, which put him into a coma for 10 days (or 16 days). His life was saved only after major surgery and Leonov recovered – only to begin a schedule of performances at the Leninski Komsomol Theatre (also called the Lenkom Theatre).\n\nIn 1993, a year before his death, Leonov was asked during a film festival \"What years in the Russian theatre's life were the most productive?\" Leonov replied:\n\nLeonov died on 29 January 1994 on his way to the Lenkom Theatre to perform in \"The Prayer For The Dead\" (\"A Memorial Prayer\"). When his death was announced in the auditorium, the audience spontaneously flooded into the church across the road and lit candles in mourning.

He was the founder of the House of Austria-Este and Governor of the Duchy of Milan between 1765 and 1796. He was also designated as the heir to the Duchy of Modena and Reggio, but he never reigned, owing to the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nFerdinand was born at the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna as the fourth son and fourteenth child of the Holy Roman Emperor Franz I and of his wife, Maria Theresa of Austria.\n\nIn 1763, the last Este Duke of Modena, Ercole III (who did not die until 1803), signed a treaty with the Empress Maria Theresa engaging the nine-year-old Ferdinand to his only daughter Maria Beatrice, making him thus his heir. There had been an earlier treaty in 1753 making Ferdinand's older brother Peter Leopold the heir to the Duchy of Modena, but in 1761, Peter Leopold became heir to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, which required a change to the Modena agreement.\n\nIn 1771, the Perpetual Imperial Diet approved the eventual investiture of Ferdinand with the imperial fiefs held by Ercole III.\n\nOn 15 October 1771, Ferdinand married Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d'Este (7 April 1750-14 Nov 1829), only surviving child of Duke Ercole III of Modena and Reggio (although the marriage was not a requirement of Ferdinand's eventual succession). Festivities arranged for this occasion included the operas \"Ascanio in Alba\" by Mozart and \"Il Ruggiero\" by Johann Adolph Hasse.\n\nFerdinand and Maria Beatrice had ten children:\n\nFerdinand became Governor of the Duchy of Milan on his marriage in 1771, as long as his father-in-law Ercole III d'Este still ruled the Duchy of Modena. He and his family lived in Milan.\n\nIn 1780, Ferdinand was confirmed as Governor of Lombardy by his brother, the new Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II. In 1796, Napoleon's invasion of Milan forced the family to flee the French forces. Duke Ercole III also had to flee Modena, which overthrew the monarchy and joined the Cisalpine Republic.\n\nBy the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, Duke Ercole III was granted the Duchy of Breisgau, a Habsburg territory in southwest Germany. When Ercole III died in 1803, Ferdinand succeeded as Duke of Breisgau, as well as titular Duke of Modena and Reggio. By the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805, Ferdinand ceded the Duchy of Breisgau to the Grand Duchy of Baden. \n\nFerdinand died the following year in Vienna. He is buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.\n\nIn 1814, Ferdinand's eldest surviving son, Francis IV, was recognised as Duke of Modena by the Congress of Vienna.\n\n"}

Mironov studied in the Vakhtangov Theatre School during the early 1950s. From 1958 to 1962, he studied acting at the Moscow Shchukin School. From June 18, 1962, to 1987, Mironov was a permanent member of the trope at the Moscow Theatre of Satire.

He also received a number of state awards, including the prestigious Order of Lenin, which he received twice in his lifetime.\n\nNikulin was born just after the end of the Russian civil war, in Smolensk in Western Russia. His mother was a garage supervisor and his father a writer of satirical plays – \"a profession which may have influenced [Nikulin's] future career\".\n\nNikulin fought in the Red Army in the Winter War with Finland and the World War II with Germany. He reportedly had a comparably \"long period of military service, from 1939-46, preparing to be demobilised just when the German invasion of the Soviet Union began in 1941.\"\n\nNikulin's style and precise delivery, as well as his mastery of timing and his hilarious masks made him an outstanding comedian.\n\nIn the ring, Nikulin presented a phlegmatic temperament, slow and unsmiling, and to many in the West his personality was reminiscent of the great silent film comedian Buster Keaton. Rich in mimicry, doleful of expression, Nikulin was hailed as “a brainy clown” outside Russia.\n\nNikulin, affectionately called \"Uncle Yura\" by Russian children, relied mainly upon his wits to earn his place in history as one of the best clowns of the 20th century.\n\nNikulin first took up clowning in 1944 when a political officer in his battalion, impressed by his repertoire of jokes, ordered him to organize entertainment for the division, which he did with resounding success. Encouraged, once the war ended, Nikulin reportedly \"tried unsuccessfully to enter drama college before answering a newspaper advertisement recruiting trainees for the Clown Studio at Moscow's Tsvetnoy Boulevard Circus.\"\n\nSeveral acting schools and theatres rejected Nikulin allegedly due to \"lacking artistic talent\". However, he did find initial success at the Circus and qualified as a fully trained clown in 1950, and never abandoned his links with the circus. He met his wife, Tatyana, there, and in 1982 became the director of the Moscow Circus, a post he held until his death. His son, Maxim, is now a circus administrator.\n\nHis screen debut came in 1958 with the film \"The Girl with the Guitar\". He appeared in almost a dozen major features, mainly in the 1960s and 1970s, \"but his ascent to star status was assured by a handful of short films directed by Leonid Gaidai.\"\n\nThe first two of these, \"Dog Barbos and Unusual Cross\" and later \"Bootleggers\" (Russian: \"Samogonchiki\" or \"The Moonshine Makers\", 1961), were also where Nikulin was featured as a character named Fool in The Three Stooges-like trio, along with Georgy Vitsyn as Coward and Yevgeny Morgunov as Experienced. In former Soviet republics he is particularly well known for his role in popular film series about the criminal trio. The series included such films as \"Operation Y and Other Shurik's Adventures\" and \"Kidnapping Caucassian Style\".\n\nHis most popular films include comedies \"The Diamond Arm\", \"The Twelve Chairs\", \"Grandads-Robbers\". He was also acclaimed for his roles in Andrey Tarkovsky's \"Andrei Rublev\" and several films on World War II themes (Sergei Bondarchuk's \"They Fought for Their Country\", Aleksei German’s \"Twenty Days Without War\").\n\nNikulin's \"comic timing never faltered\" even in old age and \"he had no enemies and mixed with politicians from both the Soviet and post -Soviet eras\". He reportedly was close to Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov and supported Boris Yeltsin's re-election campaign.\"\n\nAs mentioned, Nikulin was succeeded in his office at the Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard by his son. There is a bronze monument to him in front of the circus, which now bears his name. He is buried in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.\n\n\n"}

Withers was the son of Frederick Withers, a former Labor member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. Withers was educated at Perth Technical College. Withers served in the Royal Australian Navy from 1942 until 1946 before returning to Australia to study law at the University of Western Australia under the ex-servicemen's scheme. While at university, Withers opposed what he saw as the authoritarian stance of the Chifley Labor government and joined the Liberal Party of Australia.\n\nReturning to Bunbury to practise law, first as a solicitor and, from 1953, a barrister, Withers was elected to Bunbury Municipal Council and began to involve himself in Liberal Party affairs, serving at various times as Liberal Party State President and Vice-President and Federal Vice-President.\n\nWithers entered the Senate on 17 February 1966 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator Sir Shane Paltridge, but lost his seat later that year, before returning to the Senate in 1968.\n\nDescribed as having a \"jovial manner and perpetual grin\", Withers quickly gained a reputation as the Liberal numbers man and served as Senate Government Whip from 1969–71. After the defeat of the McMahon government in 1972, Withers became Opposition Leader in the Senate, where he retained a thin majority and acted to block much of the Whitlam Government's legislation. Withers was widely known as \"The Toecutter\" for his alleged approach to enforcing party loyalty and his role in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis.\n\nAfter the dismissal of the Whitlam government on 11 November 1975, Withers was appointed to Malcolm Fraser's first (caretaker) ministry, becoming Vice-President of the Executive Council as well as briefly holding the portfolios of Special Minister of State, Capital Territory, Media, and Tourism and Recreation during the period leading up to the December election. After the election, Withers became Minister for Administrative Services, and continued as Vice-President of the Executive Council until 7 August 1978. He was dismissed by Fraser in the wake of the findings of a Royal Commission into aspects of a redistribution of certain federal electorates in Queensland.

{"id": "1808258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808258", "title": "Photosynthetically active radiation", "text": "Photosynthetically active radiation\n\nPhotosynthetically active radiation, often abbreviated PAR, designates the spectral range (wave band) of solar radiation from 400 to 700 nanometers that photosynthetic organisms are able to use in the process of photosynthesis. This spectral region corresponds more or less with the range of light visible to the human eye. Photons at shorter wavelengths tend to be so energetic that they can be damaging to cells and tissues, but are mostly filtered out by the ozone layer in the stratosphere. Photons at longer wavelengths do not carry enough energy to allow photosynthesis to take place.\n\nOther living organisms, such as cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, and heliobacteria, can exploit solar light in slightly extended spectral regions, such as the near-infrared. These bacteria live in environments such as the bottom of stagnant ponds, sediment and ocean depths. Because of their pigments, they form colorful mats of green, red and purple.\n\nChlorophyll, the most abundant plant pigment, is most efficient in capturing red and blue light. Accessory pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls harvest some green light and pass it on to the photosynthetic process, but enough of the green wavelengths are reflected to give leaves their characteristic color. An exception to the predominance of chlorophyll is autumn, when chlorophyll is degraded (because it contains N and Mg) but the accessory pigments are not (because they only contain C, H and O) and remain in the leaf producing red, yellow and orange leaves.\n\nIn land plants, leaves absorb mostly red and blue light in the first layer of photosynthetic cells because of Chlorophyll absorbance. Green light, however, penetrates deeper into the leaf interior and can drive photosynthesis more efficiently than red light. Because green and yellow wavelengths can transmit through chlorophyll and the entire leaf itself, they play a crucial role in growth beneath the plant canopy.\nPAR measurement is used in agriculture, forestry and oceanography. One of the requirements for productive farmland is adequate PAR, so PAR is used to evaluate agricultural investment potential. PAR sensors stationed at various levels of the forest canopy measure the pattern of PAR availability and utilization. Photosynthetic rate and related parameters can be measured non-destructively using a photosynthesis system, and these instruments measure PAR and sometimes control PAR at set intensities. PAR measurements are also used to calculate the euphotic depth in the ocean.\n\nIn these contexts, the reason PAR is preferred over other lighting metrics such as luminous flux and illuminance is that these measures are based on human perception of brightness, which is strongly green biased and does not accurately describe the quantity of light usable for photosynthesis.\n\nThe irradiance of PAR can be measured in energy units (W/m), which is relevant in energy-balance considerations for photosynthetic organisms.\n\nHowever, photosynthesis is a quantum process and the chemical reactions of photosynthesis are more dependent on the number of photons than the energy contained in the photons. Therefore, plant biologists often quantify PAR using the number of photons in the 400-700 nm range received by a surface for a specified amount of time, or the Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD). PPFD is normally measured using mol ms. In relation to plant growth and morphology, it is better to characterise the light availability for plants by means of the Daily Light Integral (DLI), which is the daily flux of photons per ground area, and includes both diurnal variation as well as variation in day length.\n\nPPFD used to sometimes be expressed as einstein units, i.e., µE m s, although this usage is nonstandard and is no longer used.\n\nThere are two common measures of photosynthetically active radiation: photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) and yield photon flux (YPF). PPF values all photons from 400 to 700 nm equally, while YPF weights photons in the range from 360 to 760 nm based on a plant's photosynthetic response.\n\nPAR as described with PPF does not distinguish between different wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm, and assumes that wavelengths outside this range have zero photosynthetic action. If the exact spectrum of the light is known, the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) values in μmol sm) can be modified by applying different weighting factors to different wavelengths. This results in a quantity called the yield photon flux (YPF). The red curve in the graph shows that photons around 610 nm (orange-red) have the highest amount of photosynthesis per photon. However, because short-wavelength photons carry more energy per photon, the maximum amount of photosynthesis per incident unit of energy is at a longer wavelength, around 650 nm (deep red).\n\nIt has been noted that there is considerable misunderstanding over the effect of light quality on plant growth. Many manufacturers claim significantly increased plant growth due to light quality (high YPF). The YPF curve indicates that orange and red photons between 600 and 630 nm can result in 20 to 30% more photosynthesis than blue or cyan photons between 400 and 540 nm.\n\nBut the YPF curve was developed from short-term measurements made on single leaves in low light. More recent longer-term studies with whole plants in higher light indicate that light quality may have a smaller effect on plant growth rate than light quantity. Blue light, while not delivering as many photons per joule, encourages leaf growth and affects other outcomes.\n\nThe conversion between energy-based PAR and photon-based PAR depends on the spectrum of the light source (see Photosynthetic efficiency). The following table shows the conversion factors from watts for black-body spectra that are truncated to the range 400–700 nm. It also shows the luminous efficacy for these light sources and the fraction of a real black-body radiator that is emitted as PAR.\nFor example, a light source of 1000 lm at a color temperature of 5800 K would emit approximately 1000/265 = 3.8 W of PAR, which is equivalent to 3.8*4.56 = 17.3 µmol/s. For a black-body light source at 5800 K, such as the sun is approximately, a fraction 0.368 of its total emitted radiation is emitted as PAR. For artificial light sources, that usually do not have a black-body spectrum, these conversion factors are only approximate.\n\nThe quantities in the table are calculated as\nwhere formula_4 is the black-body spectrum according to Planck's law, formula_5 is the standard luminosity function, formula_6 represent the wavelength range (400 700 nm) of PAR, and formula_7 is the Avogadro constant.\n\nBesides the amount of radiation reaching a plant in the PAR region of the spectrum, it is also important to consider the quality of such radiation. Radiation reaching a plant contains entropy as well as energy, and combining those two concepts the exergy can be determined. This sort of analysis is known as exergy analysis or second law analysis, and the exergy represents a measure of the useful work, i.e., the useful part of radiation which can be transformed into other forms of energy.\n\nThe spectral distribution of the exergy of radiation is defined as:\n\nOne of the advantages of working with the exergy is that it depends on the temperature of the emitter (the Sun), formula_9, but also on the temperature of the receiving body (the plant), formula_10, i.e., it includes the fact that the plant is emitting radiation. Naming formula_11 and formula_12, the exergy emissive power of radiation in a region is determined as:\n\nWhere formula_16 is a special function called Polylogarithm. \nBy definition, the exergy obtained by the receiving body is always lower than the energy radiated by the emitting blackbody, as a consequence of the entropy content in radiation.\nThus, as a consequence of the entropy content, not all the radiation reaching the Earth's surface is \"useful\" to produce work. Therefore, the efficiency of a process involving radiation should be measured against its exergy, not its energy.\n\nUsing the expression above, the optimal efficiency or second law efficiency for the conversion of radiation to work in the PAR region (from formula_17 400 nm to formula_18 700 nm), for a blackbody at formula_9 = 5800 K and an organism at formula_10 = 300 K is determined as:\n\nabout 8.3% lower than the value considered until now, as a direct consequence of the fact that the organisms which are using solar radiation are also emitting radiation as a consequence of their own temperature. Therefore, the conversion factor of the organism will be different depending on its temperature, and the exergy concept is more suitable than the energy one.\n\nResearchers at Utah State University compared measurements for PPF and YPF using different types of equipment. They measured the PPF and YPF of seven common radiation sources with a spectroradiometer, then compared with measurements from six quantum sensors designed to measure PPF, and three quantum sensors designed to measure YPF.\n\nThey found that the PPF and YPF sensors were the least accurate for narrow-band sources (narrow spectrum of light) and most accurate broad-band sources (fuller spectra of light). They found that PPF sensors were significantly more accurate under metal halide, low-pressure sodium and high-pressure sodium lamps than YPF sensors (>9% difference). Both YPF and PPF sensors were very inaccurate (>18% error) when used to measure light from red-light-emitting diodes.\n\n\n\n"}

The decision was to affirm a nearly jog in the nearly straight line border between extreme southeast Iowa and northeast Missouri at Keokuk, Iowa that is now Iowa's southernmost point.\n\nBefore the issue was settled, militias from both sides faced each other at the border, a Missouri sheriff collecting taxes in Iowa was incarcerated, and three trees containing beehives were cut down.\n\n\nThe first major Native American treaties following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 were the Treaty of St. Louis in 1804 in which the Sac and Fox ceded much of northeast Missouri as well as southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois and the Treaty of Fort Clark in 1808 in which the Osage Nation ceded most of Missouri and Arkansas.\n\nThe United States made no formal efforts to survey the land. During the War of 1812 Native Americans sided with the British. When the war turned out to be a stalemate, the Treaty of Ghent in 1815 required that the tribes be returned to the same status they had before the war.\n\nVarious tribes met with United States representatives at Portage Des Sioux, Missouri, in 1815 to formally end the war. While most of the Treaties of Portage des Sioux were innocuous treaties with wording about lasting friendship, the treaties with the Sac, Fox and Osage also included a paragraph indicating agreement to abide by the earlier treaties.\n\nWith that in place, the United States began plans to survey its territory. In the Treaty of Fort Clark, the Osage had ceded all land east of Fort Clark near Sibley, Missouri. The treaty permitted the United States to survey the new land and they were to \"adjust\" the boundaries for a starting point west to the mouth of the Kansas River with the Missouri River in Kansas City, Missouri on the far bank opposite Kaw Point.\n\nIn 1816 United States surveyor John C. Sullivan was instructed to survey a line north from the mouth for and then proceed east to the Des Moines River. In addition to being a round number, the line Indian Boundary Line (1816) also lined up in the east with the deep Des Moines Rapids on the Mississippi River just south of Fort Madison, Iowa, that was the northern end of navigation on the Mississippi and it also lined up with the westward adjusted boundary from the mouth of the Gasconade River the Sac had ceded in 1808. The land on the east side of the Des Moines River was the site of a Sac village which had not been ceded.\n\nSullivan erected survey markers along the line. The northwest corner of Missouri was established in a marker near Sheridan, Missouri. From there he continued east establishing the Sullivan Line to the Des Moines River just south of Farmington, Iowa, where he made no note of rapids and called it a \"small river with shallow gentle water.\" He did continue his survey another to the Mississippi.\n\nConfusion over the terms of the Des Moines Rapids on the Mississippi and the phrase rapids on the Des Moines River was to contribute to the border skirmish.\n\nWhen Missouri applied for statehood first in 1818 various proposals for boundaries were put forth including a western boundary at the mouth of the Nodaway River about west and the mouth of the Rock River (Illinois) opposite Rock Island, Illinois. Missouri was already going to be the largest state in area when it entered the Union and there was concern about making it even bigger. Sullivan was a delegate to the convention that was to ultimately declare the boundaries to be the two lines he had drawn.\n\nThe constitution defined the boundary as:\n\nThe wording of the boundary \"extending westward of the rapids of the river Des Moines\" was to cause confusion.\n\nIn the Treaty of Washington (1824) the Sac and Fox ceded their land in Missouri. The land below the Sullivan Line between the Des Moines and Mississippi was set aside as Half Breed Tract.\n\nIn the Indian Removal Act of 1830, all tribes were moved west and south of the line, Sullivan had drawn.\n\nIn 1834 Half Breed Tract was opened to public settlement. This, along with the transfer of the territory of modern-day Iowa to the Wisconsin Territory, was to spur Missouri to reconsider its northern border, first by extending its border west to the Missouri River in the Platte Purchase in northwest Missouri and then by reconsidering the northeast corner.\n\nIn 1837 the Missouri General Assembly ordered the line to be resurveyed. When Wisconsin Territory refused to participate in the survey, J.C. Brown began a survey in which he ignored the traditional definition of the rapids below Fort Madison on the Mississippi and instead looked for rapids on the Des Moines River itself and identified the rapids as being at Keosauqua, Iowa, about into modern Iowa.\n\nAs the dispute heated up, Missouri was to note there were rapids on the Des Moines all the way to Des Moines, Iowa. Meanwhile, Iowa was to maintain its ownership extended to a line about into modern Missouri at the mouth of the Des Moines.\n\nTax agents from Kahoka, Missouri, tried to collect taxes in what is now Van Buren County, Iowa, and Davis County, Iowa. The Iowa residents, allegedly carrying pitchforks, chased away the tax collectors who, legend has it, chopped down three honey bee trees in what is now Lacey-Keosauqua State Park to collect the honey for partial payment.\n\nMissouri governor Lilburn Boggs sent 11 mounted members of the 14th Division of the Missouri State Militia under Major General David Willock, from Palmyra, Missouri, to the disputed border to protect the tax collector. General Willock was unwilling to shed blood over an issue that should have been resolved peacefully by the governors or by Congress, and an Iowa mob succeeded in capturing the sheriff of Clark County, Missouri, and incarcerated him in the Muscatine, Iowa, jail. The Iowa militia was also called out by Iowa Territory governor Robert Lucas. Authorization for a total payment of $46 to the Missouri Militia was for 7 days in active service.\n\nAccording to one description about the Iowans:\n\nThe two governors agreed to allow Congress to resolve the issue. An arbitrary line was drawn between the two positions. However, when Iowa entered the Union Congress was to rule the border was in fact at the Mississippi confluence, a position that was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"State of Missouri v. State of Iowa\", 48 U.S. 660 (1849).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1808354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808354", "title": "Saturn Bomberman", "text": "Saturn Bomberman\n\nThe game received mixed reviews upon release, with critics commenting that the game is enjoyable but fails to truly advance the \"Bomberman\" series beyond previous installments.\n\nLike most \"Bomberman\" games, \"Saturn Bomberman\" features a battle mode as well as a story mode. Along with them is a master mode in which the player races to finish a series of levels after which the player is given a rank based on how much time is taken. This time is then saved to memory and kept on a scoreboard for future reference. The game also features several new powerups.\n\n\"Saturn Bomberman\" utilises Dinosaur helpers, which are initially found as eggs released upon the destruction of a soft block. Dinosaurs come in three levels: babies (the weakest), adolescents, and adults (the strongest). Dinosaurs can only take one hit no matter how large they are. If a player is riding a dinosaur when this happens, the dinosaur takes the hit instead of the player. As powerups are collected, a special meter at the top of the screen slowly builds up. Once this meter is full, the dinosaur will grow one level, from baby to adolescent or adolescent to adult. However, in battle mode this system works differently. Whenever a player collects an egg while riding on a dinosaur, the dinosaur will grow. The player can jump off of the dinosaur at any time.\n\n\"Saturn Bomberman\" has a story mode which can be played single player or two-player.\n\nThe story mode levels involve blowing up poles with glowing red orbs on the top (which are known as Zarfs) while avoiding (or destroying) enemies, blowing up blocks and collecting powerups. Once all the Zarfs on a level have been destroyed, an exit appears. Upon entering the exit, Bomberman will do a victory pose, then a short cut scene takes place. The cut scene shows a piece of scenery moving out of the way, then Bomberman walks through, and something closes up the way he came from. After the cut scene, the next level begins.\n\n\"Saturn Bomberman\" supports up to ten human players on battle mode with 2 multitaps, 7 players with just one multitap, or two players without any multitaps. It is also possible to combat against CPU-controlled opponents in battle mode.\n\nIf the number of players in a game exceeds eight, the game is played on a widescreen arena, shrinking the characters and blocks to tiny proportions, making the playing field very large. This also disables many of the powerups including dinosaurs.\n\nThe North American version also supports the Sega NetLink for up to four player online via two players per console.\n\nCritics were split over \"Saturn Bomberman\". It received enthusiastic reviews from \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s four-person \"review crew\", \"Saturn Power\"s Dean Mortlock, and \"Sega Saturn Magazine\"s Matt Yeo, who were particularly impressed with the ten-player capability and the numerous modes and options. Yeo also praised the game's accessibility, remarking, \"Mastering power-ups and building on that initial buzz certainly adds to the game's broad appeal but the fact that players can simply pick up a joypad and leap straight into the thick of things with the minimum of tuition is the real winning factor.\" However, a reviewer for \"Next Generation\" and Jeff Gerstmann of \"GameSpot\" both felt the game failed to break out from the shadow of \"Super Bomberman 2\". Gerstmann elaborated, \"Since that classic game, every subsequent Bomberman game has closely mirrored it, while tacking on a few silly features that kept the game fresh without really adding anything useful. \"Saturn Bomberman\" combines all these silly features into one game, giving you what should be the ultimate Bomberman game. But any serious Bomberman player has seen all this before.\" \"Next Generation\" similarly opined that \"the basic gameplay goodness of the series isn't tarnished, but nevertheless, the latest offering from Hudson Soft doesn't attain the classic status of \"SB2\".\"\n\nCritics were also not wholly sold on the 10-player feature, as most noted that the screen size used for ten players makes powerups and characters too small to discern on all but the largest television sets. They nonetheless concurred that the multiplayer modes overall are the highlight of the game. Dan Hsu of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" stated that \"It's a mediocre one-player game. It's a fantastic multiplayer game. And that's all you really need to know.\" Mortlock ventured that it is \"Probably the best multi-player game you'll ever play.\" \"GamePro\" noted that the screen is much less confusing if there are eight players or fewer, and commented, \"If you don't have a Sega multitap, \"Saturn Bomberman\" offers the perfect excuse to get one. If you don't have friends, this is a good opportunity to get some of them, too.\"\n\nThe Story Mode and Master Mode were criticized by Matt Yeo for the frustratingly difficult AI and unforgiving boss fights, and \"GamePro\" similarly described them as \"more a trial of your patience than a test of your skill.\" However, \"Next Generation\" contended that these modes are the one area where \"Saturn Bomberman\" actually exceeds \"Super Bomberman 2\", as they \"offer a decidedly less frantic (but more cerebral) puzzle-gamelike experience\".\n\nCritics generally remarked that the graphics and music are very limited and fail to advance the \"Bomberman\" series in any way. Most also complained at the excessive length of time between the game's original release in Japan and its release in North America and Europe.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Saturn version of the game in 1996, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"even a mediocre \"Bomberman\" game is still worth checking out, and a must for gregarious Saturn fans.\"\n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave \"Saturn Bomberman\" the 1997 Game of the Year awards for \"Saturn Game of the Year\" (beating \"Street Fighter Collection\" and \"Madden NFL 98\") and \"Multiplayer Game of the Year\" (beating \"GoldenEye 007\" and \"Mario Kart 64\"). The same year, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" listed it as the 10th best console video game of all time, remarking that while it was only slightly better than the \"Bomberman\" games for the older Super NES and TurboGrafx-16, it was nonetheless the best entry in the series to date.\n\n"}

The film was shot in the United States, Turkey and Israel, and the main characters Betty Mahmoody and Sayyed Bozorg \"Moody\" Mahmoody are played by Sally Field and Alfred Molina, respectively. Sheila Rosenthal and Roshan Seth star as Mahtob Mahmoody and Houssein the smuggler, respectively.\n\nIn 1984, an Iranian physician, Sayyed Bozorg \"Moody\" Mahmoody lives in the United States with his wife Betty (Sally Field) and daughter Mahtob. Due to his Iranian ethnicity, he is often mocked and ridiculed by American physicians at the hospital where he works. Unhappy with his life in America, he wants to visit his home Iran. He claims that his Iranian family wants to meet Betty and Mahtob, and asks them to come with him for a two-week visit.\n\nDespite her deep fears about visiting Iran, particularly due to the Iranian Hostage Crisis of several years earlier, Betty reluctantly agrees. Upon their arrival, they are all greeted warmly by Moody's family. Mahtob is embraced but, Betty has trouble adapting to the Iranian culture and inadvertently offends some members of Moody’s family. The night before their flight back to the United States, Moody’s brother Mammal tells Moody and Betty that in order for them to go back home, their passports would’ve had to been taken to the airport for approval three days prior to travel. Betty questions this, but Moody seems to brush this off, suggesting that they’ll take a later flight.\nAfter Betty insists that they go to the airport anyway, Moody reveals that he never intended for them to return to the states. Betty realizes that she has been deceived by her husband, even though Moody took an oath that they would return to the United States, swearing on the sacred Quran. When she protests, Moody strikes her. Betty tries to earn sympathy from Moody’s family but she is shamed and ridiculed.\n\nMoody becomes more hostile and abusive, preventing her from leaving the house or using the telephone. One day Betty answers a phone call from her mother. Her mother tells her of the American Interests Section of the Swiss Embassy, which she manages to secretly visit, but is told that she is now an Iranian citizen since she is married to an Iranian, and as long as she lives in Iran, she cannot leave the country without her husband's written consent and has no parental rights over her daughter. Moody, alarmed by Betty's absence from the house, threatens to kill her if she tries anything again.\n\nKnowing that her chances of escape are minuscule, Betty conforms to her husband's wishes in order to gain Moody's trust. Watched by Moody’s sister, Betty convinces him that they should move out of her home and into Mammal's home. By chance, during a trip to the marketplace, she meets a sympathetic storekeeper who allows her to use his telephone and overhears her conversations with the Swiss Embassy. He puts her in contact with a pair of humanitarian Iranians, Hossein and his sister, who offer to help Betty and Mahtob return to the United States. Betty accepts Hossein's assistance, especially after he warns her that Mahtob, who is nine, could be at risk of being forced into marriage or drafted into the military as a child soldier. Mahtob does not adjust to her new Iranian school and has to be accompanied to school by Betty. The women at the school tell Betty that they sympathize with her, and though they won’t allow her to use the telephone, they allow her to bring Mahtob to school hours after she would normally arrive. Betty uses this time to meet with Hossein, and they discuss an escape route. Afterwards, When she and Mahtob arrive at school, Moody is there waiting for them and attacks her in front of Mahtob. She leaves with Moody, but flees when he is distracted. She finds a telephone booth and calls a woman from the Swiss embassy whom she had spoken with previously. They return to the school but the women from the school forbid her from taking Mahtob. With no other options, Betty and Mahtob return home with Moody.\n\nThe plan becomes complicated when Betty receives news from the U. S. that her father is seriously ill and may be dying. Moody tells Betty he will allow her to return to see her dying father, but will not let Mahtob go with her. He tells Betty while she is in the United States, she is to liquidate their assets and return to Iran. Hossein warns Betty that if she visits her father, she may never see Mahtob again. Betty decides to wait to return to the United States with Mahtob. Moody unknowingly foils her plans by having her booked on a flight several days early, thanks to his relatives' contacts in the airport.\n\nBetty eventually gets what seems to be her last chance to escape when Moody is suddenly called to the clinic for an emergency. On the pretense of going to buy presents for her father, Betty takes Mahtob and they contact Hossein, who manages to supply Betty and Mahtob with fake identity documents, and they make their way past checkpoint with Iranian smugglers\n\nDespite the difficult and very dangerous journey, Betty and Mahtob are eventually dropped off in a street in Ankara, where they see the flag of the American Embassy in the distance. The film's end title cards reveal that Betty and Mahtob eventually made it back home to the United States, and Betty became a successful author and dedicates herself to helping those in need.\n\n\nThe movie was based on a book with the same title, written by Betty Mahmoody and William Hoffer and based on Betty's version of events. The screenplay was written by David W. Rintels. The film was directed by Brian Gilbert and filmed in Israel, at GG Studios in Neve Ilan and Atlanta during the summer of 1990.\n\nThe movie debuted poorly and grossed less than $15 million in ticket sales. The movie plummeted in its second week.\n\nAs of December 2018, the film holds an approval rating of 50% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 16 reviews. Roger Ebert wrote \"Here is a perplexing and frustrating film, which works with great skill to involve our emotions, while at the same time making moral and racial assertions that are deeply troubling.\" He stated that it \"does not play fair with its Muslim characters. If a movie of such a vitriolic and spiteful nature were to be made in America about any other ethnic group, it would be denounced as racist and prejudiced. Yet I recommend that the film be seen, for two reasons. One reason is because of the undeniable dramatic strength of its structure and performances; it is impossible not to identify with this mother and her daughter, and Field is very effective as a brave, resourceful woman who is determined to free herself and her daughter from involuntary captivity. The second reason is harder to explain. I think the movie should be seen because it is an invitation to thought.\"\n\nWhile Iranians are not shown in a completely negative light, as the film depicts generous and brave Iranians who contact Betty Mahmoody and arrange for the escape of her and her daughter, these \"good\" Iranians are high-born opponents of the Islamic Republic regime, shown listening to European classical music.\n\nThe score by Jerry Goldsmith was also not well received. Jay Boyar of the \"Orlando Sentinel\" called it \"TV-movie manipulative\", while Jason Ankeny of AllMusic wrote, \"Jerry Goldsmith's score does little to refute its opponents' charges of racism.\"\n\nSheila Rosenthal won the Young Artist Award for Best Actress.\n\nSally Field was nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress of 1991, where she lost to Sean Young for \"A Kiss Before Dying\".\n\nIn response to \"Not Without My Daughter\", a Finnish documentary, titled \"Without My Daughter\" was made by director Alexis Kouros. It is composed of interviews with Dr. Mahmoody regarding his life in Iran and attempts to contact his daughter Mahtob. Kouros said that the intention of the 90-minute documentary was to \"show the lies in the American film and present the real story\".\n\nAlfred Molina confirmed in an interview with \"Time Out\" that he was punched by a man who apparently hated his brutal portrayal of Dr. Mahmoody in the film.\n\n\n"}

Barber\n\nOhio Columbus Barber (April 20, 1841 – February 4, 1920) was an American businessman, industrialist and philanthropist. He was called \"America's Match King\" because of his controlling interest in the Diamond Match Company, which had 85 percent of the market in 1881. He founded the city of Barberton, Ohio in 1891 and moved his manufacturing plant there in 1894. It produced 250 million matches per day. He also founded the Akron City Hospital.\n\nOhio Columbus Barber (called O.C.) was born the second son of George and Eliza Barber in Middlebury, a small Ohio village later annexed by Akron. His father made matches by hand, which his sons sold door to door. O.C. received a common school education, and at age 15 began working for his father. At age 16, O.C. Barber became the company salesman. At 20, he was a partner in the business, and by 21 the general manager.\n\nThe company had difficulties through the American Civil War, and O.C.'s older brother, George H. Barber, who was a soldier, died of dysentery, one of the many war casualties of disease. By 1880 the Barber Company had become the biggest match-producing company in Ohio and one of the largest in the nation. Unregulated competition made it difficult for the Barber Company to keep stable. In 1881, the Barber Company and 11 other match-producing companies merged into the Diamond Match Company, which dominated the match market, holding 85 per cent of the U.S. Market.\n\nBarber was long a leader in his own home town, Akron. He was, for many years, president of the First National Bank of Akron, and when it was consolidated with the Second National Bank under the name of the First-Second National Bank he was unanimously elected to the presidency of the combined institutions.\n\nTo expand manufacturing operations, Barber purchased a large area from Norton Township founding the city of Barberton in 1891. He intended it to be a model for industrial and residential development. Barber developed its early stages through The Barberton Land and Improvement Company. Within a few years, the city had expanded with industrial and residential areas, growing at such a rate it was nicknamed \"Magic City\". It attracted many new immigrants to its industrial jobs.\n\nIn 1894 Barber moved his match-making plant from Akron to Barberton, which helped the city's economy. The factory produced 250 million matches each day.\n\nIn 1889, Barber founded and organized the American Straw Board Company. He was one of the early manufacturers of rubber products, and organized and managed the Diamond Rubber Company up to the time of its acquisition by the B. F. Goodrich Company. The sewer-pipe and steel-tube industry next engaged his attention, and he became a western pioneer in this line of endeavor. He founded the Stirling Boiler Company which was merged with the Babcock & Wilcox Boiler Manufacturing Company of Barberton and Bayonne, New Jersey, the concern thus becoming the largest manufacturer of steel boilers in the world. For a number of years, they constructed four-fifths of the product used by the United States Navy.\n\nOne of the biggest achievements of Barber's career, particularly from the humanitarian and economical standpoints, was the establishment, with Frederick Grinnell and others, of the General Fire Extinguisher Company. Barber was the founder and sole owner of the O. C. Barber Concrete Company, whose plant at Barberton was said to be the largest of its kind in the world. It also made art works in concrete. He originated the O. C. Barber Fertilizer Company, of Barber, Virginia. He also undertook the development of large tracts of land in and about the city of Canton, Ohio, in connection with which he has organized and operated a large plant under the name of the O. C. Barber Allied Industries Company. Some of these lands contain valuable coal, lime, and clay properties.\nHe was the originator and guiding spirit of Barber Subways, at Cleveland. His plans called for the building of an underground system of subways connecting every railroad entering Cleveland, at the Lake Front, thus facilitating the handling of freight, and the establishment of the great warehouse system on the Lake Shore, where he owned large frontages.\n\nIn 1905, he began his last project, to create a scientific farm. He gradually purchased more than . In 1909, Barber used his wealth to commission construction of a three-story, 52-room mansion in Barberton; it was completed in 18 months. Over long, the mansion was designed in the French Renaissance Revival style by the Akron architects Harpster & Bliss. It cost more than $400,000 to construct and had an area of . Among its amenities was an elevator with a glass skylight. On the grounds were gardens and a park, designed by a Chicago landscape architect firm. The extravagant building was reported by local and national papers; the \"New York Times\" called it the \"finest mansion between New York and Chicago.\" Barber and his family moved into the mansion in October 1910. It stood until 1965, when it was demolished.\n\nIn addition, Barber had 35 structures built as part of his experimental, scientific Anna Dean Farm, which covered . He named it after his daughter Anna and her husband, Dr. Arthur Dean Bevan. These were also in the French Renaissance Revival style, as he believed farm buildings should be both beautiful and functional. He intended to have a farm that operated as efficiently as industry. For education, he opened the grounds to the public weekly on Sundays. Many of his facilities were the largest in the world at the time, such as the greenhouses, covering and heated by the Heating House; Barn #3, long, wide and three stories high, the largest barn in the world when constructed in 1912, and the Brooder Barn's incubator. He raised 50,000 chickens, which were allowed \"free range\". Barber had a barn for 140 thoroughbred Belgian draft horses, used for show and for farm work.\n\nIn 1920, Barber died at his mansion in Barberton. He willed his farm to Case Western University, intending it to serve as the basis of an agricultural college, but he failed to complete the financing before his death. Since neither his widow nor the university was able to operate the farm, the university sold most of the property. It was divided and redeveloped.\n\nAfter the American Civil War, when Barber was 26, he married Laura Brown of Coventry, Ohio. They had one daughter Anna, the namesake years later for a lake and park in Barberton, and a son Charles, who died young. Anna Dean Farm was named after their daughter and her husband, Dr. Arthur Dean Bevan. Laura died in 1894. After being a widower for 20 years, in 1915 Barber married Mary Orr, who had worked as his secretary and shared his vision.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1808390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808390", "title": "Peter Chanel", "text": "Peter Chanel\n\nSaint Peter Chanel (12 July 1803 – 28 April 1841), born Pierre Louis Marie Chanel, was a Catholic priest, missionary, and martyr.\n\nChanel was born in the hamlet of La Potière near Montrevel-en-Bresse, Ain département, France. Son of Claude-François Chanel and Marie-Anne Sibellas he was the fifth of eight children. From about the age of 7 to 12 he worked as a shepherd. The local parish priest persuaded his parents to allow Peter to attend a small school the priest had started. After some local schooling, his piety and intelligence attracted the attention of a visiting priest from Cras, Fr. Trompier, and he was put into Church-sponsored education at Cras in the autumn of 1814. He made his first communion on 23 March 1817.\n\nIt was from that time that Chanel's attraction for the missions abroad began. His interest began when he read letters from missionaries to America sent back by Bishop Louis William Valentine Dubourg. He later said, \"It was that year that I formed the idea of going to the foreign missions.\" In 1819 he entered the minor seminary at Meximieux where he won several awards and class prizes in Latin, Christian doctrine and speech. He attended Belley in 1823, and the major seminary at Brou in 1824.\n\nChanel was ordained on 15 July 1827 and spent a brief time as an assistant priest at Ambérieu-en-Bugey. At Ambérieu he also read letters from a former curate from that parish who was at that time a missionary in India. There he met Claude Bret, who was to become his friend and also one of the first Marist Missionaries. The following year, Chanel applied to the Bishop of Belley for permission to go to the missions. His application was not accepted and instead he was appointed for the next three years as parish priest of Crozet, which he revitalized in that short time.\n\nChanel's zeal was respected, and his care, particularly of the sick in the parish, won the hearts of the locals. During this time, Chanel heard of a group of diocesan priests who were hopeful of starting a religious order to be dedicated to Mary, the Mother of Jesus\n\nIn 1831, at the age of 28, Chanel joined the forming Society of Mary (Marists), who would concentrate on local missions and foreign missionary work. Instead of selecting him as a missionary, however, the Marists appointed him as the spiritual director at the seminary of Belley, where he stayed for five years. In 1833, he accompanied Fr. Jean-Claude Colin to Rome to seek approval of the nascent Society. In 1836, the Marists, formally approved by Pope Gregory XVI, were asked to send missionaries to the territory of the southwest Pacific. Chanel, professed a Marist on 24 September 1836, was made the superior of a band of seven Marist missionaries that set out on 24 December from Le Havre. They were accompanied by Bishop Jean Baptiste Pompallier who was to become the first Roman Catholic bishop of New Zealand.\n\nChanel traveled first to the Canary Islands (8 January 1837), where his friend, Fr. Claude Bret, caught a flu-like virus which led to his death at sea (20 March 1837). Next, Chanel traveled to Valparaíso, Chile (28 June), where the French Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (\"Picpus Fathers\"), who had care of the Apostolic Vicariate of Eastern Oceania, had their base. His third and fourth stops were in the Gambier Islands (13 September) and in Tahiti (21 September), where the group transferred to the ship \"Raiatea\". In that ship, they set sail (23 October) to drop off two missionaries at Wallis, the main seat of the mission in Tonga. The missionaries arrived at Vava’u but were not welcome, and thus continued their journey to Futuna. Pierre Chanel went to neighboring Futuna, accompanied by a French lay brother Marie-Nizier Delorme. They arrived on 8 November 1837 with an English Protestant layman named Thomas Boag, who had been resident on the island and had joined them at Tonga seeking passage to Futuna.\n\nThe group was initially well received by Futuna's king, Niuliki. Chanel struggled to learn the language but mastered it. Despite little apparent success and severe want, he maintained endless patience and courage. It was a difficult mission, requiring him to cope with isolation and acclimate to different foods and customs, but it eventually began to bear some fruit. A few natives had been baptized while a few more were being instructed. King Niuliki believed Christianity would undermine his authority as high priest and king. When his son, Meitala, sought to be baptized, the king sent a favored warrior, his son-in-law, Musumusu, to \"do whatever was necessary\" to resolve the problem. Musumusu went to Meitala and the two fought. Musumusu, injured in the fracas, went to Chanel feigning need of medical attention. While Chanel tended him, a group of others ransacked his house. Musumusu took an ax and clubbed Chanel to death. Chanel died on 28 April 1841.\n\nBishop Pompallier heard of the death of Chanel on 4 November 1841 while he was at Akaroa and arranged for a French naval corvette commanded by the Comte du Bouzet, \"L’Allier\", to accompany the mission schooner \"Sancta Maria\" and sail on 19 November for Wallis and Futuna, taking with him Philippe Viard. The two vessels arrived at Uvea on 30 December 1841. The bishop sent Viard to Futuna, where he landed on 18 January 1842. A chief named Maligi, who had not agreed to Chanel's murder, agreed to disinter Chanel's body and brought it to the \"L’Allier\" the next day, wrapped in several local mats.\n\nThe ship's doctor, M. Rault, was able to verify the identity of the remains, bearing in mind the description of the manner of Chanel's death given previously by Marie-Nizier. The doctor undertook to embalm the remains, so that they could be kept, wrapping them in linen and placing them in a cask. The schooner \"Sancta Maria\" transported the body back to Kororāreka, New Zealand, arriving on 3 May 1842.\n\nThe relics remained in the Bay of Islands until 1849, when they were accompanied by Petitjean to Auckland, New Zealand – most likely early in April 1849. They left New Zealand on 15 April 1849 by the ship \"Maukin\", and arrived in Sydney, Australia, on 4 May. Rocher received the container that held the bones and took it to the Procure Chapel at Gladesville in Sydney on 7 May. Rocher was very careful in making the decision as to when to send the container on to England and France. He looked for a trustworthy captain, and a reliable person in London to receive the consignment, attend to the customs, and have it sent on to Lyon. Early in 1850, Bernin, pro-vicar for Bishop Douarre, vicar-apostolic of New Caledonia, had to leave for France. He left Sydney for London on the \"Waterloo\" on 1 February 1850, taking Chanel's remains with him. On 1 June 1850, the remains arrived at the motherhouse of the Society of Mary in Lyon. The relics were returned to Futuna in 1977. The skull was returned to Futuna in 1985.\n\nBishop Pompallier sent Catherin Servant, François Roulleaux-Dubignon and Marie Nizier to return to the island and they arrived on 9 June 1842. Eventually, most islanders converted to Catholicism. Musumusu himself converted and, as he lay dying, expressed the desire that he be buried outside the church at Poi so that those who came to revere Chanel would walk over his grave to reach it.\n\nAs a form of penitence, a special action song and dance known as the eke, was created by the people of Futuna shortly after Chanel's death. The dance is still performed in Tonga.\n\nChanel was declared a martyr and beatified in 1889. He was canonized on 12 June 1954 by Pope Pius XII. Chanel is recognized as the protomartyr and patron saint of Oceania. His feast day is 28 April.\n\nMarist priests and brothers working in Oceania cover a territory as big as Western Europe. The area includes six independent nations and two French territories. The Marist Oceania province is the largest in the Society of Mary.\n\n"}

{"id": "1808403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808403", "title": "Boston and Skegness (UK Parliament constituency)", "text": "Boston and Skegness (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nBoston and Skegness is a constituency (specifically, a county constituency), represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament. It is located in Lincolnshire, England. Like all British constituencies, Boston and Skegness elects one Member of parliament (MP) by the first-past-the-post system of election. The seat has been represented by the Conservative MP Matt Warman since the 2015 general election, and is usually considered a safe seat for the party.\n\nThe constituency was created in 1997, from parts of the former constituencies of Holland with Boston and East Lindsey. The constituency has always elected a Conservative MP. In the 1997 and 2001 general elections, the seat was very marginal, with majorities of less than 1,000 votes for the Conservative candidate over the Labour candidate. The next two general elections, in 2005 and 2010, saw large swings towards the Conservatives. \nIn the 2015 general election, the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP) overtook Labour to take second place in the constituency; the party won 33.8% of the vote in the seat, which was UKIP's second-highest vote share in any constituency in that election (after Clacton). The seat had been one of UKIP's top target seats in that election, as they had also performed strongly in the constituency at the two previous general elections.\n\nThe constituency is estimated to have had the highest vote share in favour of leaving the European Union (EU) in the 2016 EU membership referendum, at 75.6%. For this reason, the leader of UKIP, Paul Nuttall, stood as the party's candidate in the seat in the 2017 general election. UKIP's vote share fell nationally that election, and they dropped to third place (behind Labour) with 7.7% of the vote, the party's third largest percentage drop in vote share. In the 2019 general election, the Conservatives increased their majority further, winning 76.7% of the vote. This was their second-highest vote share in the election (after Castle Point). The seat was also the second-safest Conservative seat in that election (measured by swing needed for the second-place party to gain the seat), after the neighbouring seat of South Holland and the Deepings.\n\nIn England, constituency boundaries are determined by the Boundary Commission for England, an independent body which periodically reviews the size of each constituency based on demographic data; these changes must be approved by the UK Parliament. The constituency of Boston and Skegness was created as a county constituency, by a statutory instrument in 1994, as part of the Fourth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, and was first contested in the 1997 general election. When formed, it consisted of the Borough of Boston and the wards of Burgh le Marsh, Friskney, Frithville, Ingoldmells, St Clement's, Scarbrough, Seacroft, Sibsey, Wainfleet, and Winthorpe in the District of East Lindsey. The constituency was largely created from parts of the former Holland with Boston constituency, with the remainder previously part of the former seat of East Lindsey.\n\nThe constituency boundaries changed at the 2010 general election as part of the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, bringing in the two wards of Stickney and Croft from the neighbouring constituency of Louth and Horncastle. The constituency then consisted of the Borough of Boston, and the District of East Lindsey wards of Burgh le Marsh, Croft, Frithville, Ingoldmells, St Clement's, Scarbrough, Seacroft, Sibsey, Stickney, Wainfleet and Friskney, and Winthorpe. The original proposal from the Boundary Commission had been to only transfer the Croft ward, but it was then decided to also include the ward of Stickney because of its ties with the town of Boston.\n\nThe Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies was carried out between 2011 and 2018, but has not been implemented because the proposed boundary changes need to be approved by the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The review recommended that the two wards – Heckington Rural, and Kirkby la Thorpe and South Kyme – be transferred to Boston and Skegness from the constituency of Sleaford and North Hykeham. This recommendation was made because Boston and Skegness was below the permitted electorate range, and Sleaford and North Hykeham was above it; \"electorate range\" refers to the range (normally within 5% of the median British electorate) of allowed electorate size in each constituency, since legally all unprotected constituencies must be within this limit. The proposed constituency boundaries mostly received support, though some local residents argued that the wards should remain in the same constituency as Sleaford. The new constituency has an electorate of 71,989 (calculated in 2018).\n\nBoston and Skegness is bordered by the constituencies of Louth and Horncastle to the north, Sleaford and North Hykeham to the west, and South Holland and The Deepings to the south; all three of these constituencies are in the county of Lincolnshire and are all considered safe Conservative seats, and have been represented by MPs from the party since the formation of the constituencies in 1997. Indeed, as of the 2019 general election, all seven Parliamentary constituencies in Lincolnshire have a Conservative MP.\n\nBoston, Lincolnshire, is a historic town, famous for the tower of St Botolph's Church, known by locals as the \"Stump\". Skegness is a seaside town and holiday destination; the first Butlins resort opened in Skegness in 1936.\n\nThe constituency has a lower level of qualifications (measured by National Vocational Qualifications) than the East Midlands average and the average for Great Britain; in 2018, 19.7% of the adult population had a Higher National Diploma or degree-level qualification, compared to the British average of 39.3%. The 2015 data also found that the median house price in the constituency was £125 000. In 2019, the average gross weekly pay for people working full-time was £462, lower the average for Great Britain, which was £587. The most common jobs are process plant and machine operatives and sales and customer service occupations. Around 40% of workers work in one of these areas, more than twice the national average. The constituency also has a lower employment rate and a higher level of people on unemployment benefits than the averages for the region and the country.\n\nAccording to the 2011 UK Census, Boston was \"home to a higher proportion of Eastern European immigrants than anywhere else in England and Wales\". People born in other EU countries, most of whom came from Eastern Europe after the 2004 enlargement of the European Union, made up 13% of the town's population. The BBC described the town as \"one of the most extreme examples in Britain of a town affected by recent EU immigration\". In 2015, 11.3% of people living in the constituency were born outside the UK. The average age in the constituency was 32 at the time.\n\nLike all UK Parliament constituencies, Boston and Skegness elects one Member of Parliament (MP) using the first-past-the-post voting system.\n\nThe constituency was created in 1997 from parts of the former constituencies of Holland with Boston and East Lindsey. The in part predecessor area's veteran MP Richard Body, who had been MP for Holland with Boston between 1966 and 1997, held the seat at the 1997 general election with a 1.4% majority (647 votes). The seat had been formed from two constituencies held by the Conservatives with large majorities, and a Conservative victory was seen as very likely. However, the election result nationally was a landslide victory for the Labour Party, and Body only narrowly remained in Parliament; the seat was the tenth most marginal Conservative-held seat at the election by percentage majority and the ninth most marginal by absolute majority (number of votes). The academics Robert Waller and Byron Criddle attributed his victory to the Referendum Party's decision not to stand, which they did because of Body's Eurosceptic views.\n\nAfter retiring from Parliament, Body left the Conservatives and joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP), a party that supported British withdrawal from the European Union (EU), though he encouraged people to vote Conservative at the 2005 general election. His membership later lapsed and he defected to the English Democrats, a small far-right party.\n\nBody's successor, the Conservative Mark Simmonds, won an even smaller majority of 1.3% over Labour in the 2001 general election (515 votes). The seat was described by Waller and Criddle as \"an exceptionally tight two-way marginal\". The seat was the fourth most marginal Conservative seat at that election (by both percentage and absolute majority) and the most marginal Conservative seat with Labour in second place.\n\nIn the 2005 general election, Simmonds increased his majority over Labour to 14.1%. The seat had the 139th largest absolute majority and the 131st largest percentage majority out of the 198 Conservative seats. Richard Horsnell, the candidate for the anti-European Union party UKIP (United Kingdom Independence Party) came third with 9.6%. This was UKIP's highest vote share in any seat in the 2005 general election, with the exception of South Staffordshire, where UKIP won 10.4% after the election was delayed due to the death of a candidate. UKIP also performed strongly in several local council elections in Boston on the same day, winning more than 20% of the vote in some wards. Overall, UKIP won 2.2% of the national vote and won an average of 2.8% in the seats they stood candidates in. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats fell from third to fourth place with just 8.7% of the vote; this was the party's seventh-lowest vote share in any seat, and third-lowest vote share in a constituency in England, in the election. Waller and Criddle said that the constituency \"now looks like a fairly safe Tory [Conservative] seat\", though Labour had hoped to win the seat in the election.\n\nAfter his re-election, Simmonds was appointed Shadow Minister for International Development in May 2005, before being moved to be a Shadow Health Minister in July 2007.\n\nIn the 2010 general election, Simmonds increased his majority over Labour further, winning almost half the vote compared to Labour's 20.6%. The Liberal Democrats came third, while UKIP achieved fourth place; their candidate Christopher Pain won 9.5% of the vote. This share of the vote was similar to the result in the previous election, and was UKIP's second-highest in 2010, after the special case of Buckingham. The far-right British National Party (BNP) also performed strongly in the constituency, winning 5.3% of the vote; since this was more than 5%, the party saved their deposit.\n\nFollowing the 2010 general election, Simmonds became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Caroline Spelman, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs. Following the 2012 cabinet reshuffle, he became the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs a junior role in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe polling company Survation analysed the results of the 2013 local elections and estimated that if UKIP were to perform equally well in a general election, then they would gain the constituency with an 11% majority. Of the ten constituencies that Survation predicted UKIP would win, Boston and Skegness had the largest predicted UKIP majority. UKIP performed strongly in and near the town of Boston, which was historically a safe Conservative area; this was seen as a surprise and was attributed to voters being concerned about immigration and feeling ignored by politicians. Afterwards, there was some media speculation that Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP, might stand in the constituency at the next general election; Simmonds said he \"would be delighted\" if Farage did, as it would give issues in the constituency more attention.\n\nIn the 2014 European Parliament election, which UKIP won ahead of Labour and the Conservatives, the Borough of Boston had the highest UKIP vote share in the country. The party gained 52% of votes in the borough, followed by the Conservatives and then Labour. This led to the constituency being seen as a top target for UKIP in the next general election.\n\nOn 11 August 2014, Simmonds resigned as a minister and announced that he would step down as the Member of Parliament for Boston and Skegness at the 2015 general election. Explaining his decision, he said that his salary and expenses of over £100,000 were not enough to maintain a home in London, which he said caused \"intolerable\" pressure in his family life. This attracted some criticism, as Simmonds' salary was several times larger than the average salary in his constituency. There was also media speculation that he stood down due to the threat of UKIP gaining the seat.\n\nAfter Simmonds announced that he would not stand at the 2015 general election, the local Conservatives decided to select their candidate using the open primary system. Interviews were used to narrow down the number of applicants to four, with the winner then being chosen at a public meeting that all voters in the constituency could attend and vote in. Several rounds of voting were used; the first two rounds, with 81 votes cast in each, both eliminated one candidate; the first candidate eliminated was Paul Bristow, who was later won the seat of Peterborough in 2019. The third round saw 80 votes cast with a tie between the journalist Matt Warman and the headteacher Tim Clark. Another vote between the two was held, which was won by Warman, then the head of technology at \"The Daily Telegraph\". Warman, who was 33 at the time of the primary, argued that UKIP's support in the area was partly due to \"a real disconnect between voters and politicians\"; his wife's family lived in the constituency.\n\nThe seat had been one of UKIP's top target seats in that election. The journalist and commentator Iain Dale predicted in February 2015 that UKIP would gain the seat, writing \"[if] UKIP are to make a breakthrough, it might well be here\"; overall, Dale predicted that UKIP would make five gains at the election. Two opinion polls of the constituency were carried out prior to the 2015 general election. A poll in September 2014 predicted a UKIP majority of 19%, while a 2015 poll forecast a narrow Conservative majority of 3%. However, an internal poll conducted by UKIP (not released to the public) close to the election found a Conservative lead of seven points.\n\nOn the day of the election, 8 May 2015, Warman was duly elected as the Member of Parliament; the Conservative majority shrunk to 10% with the UKIP candidate Robin Hunter-Clarke, a councillor on the Lincolnshire County Council, coming in second place. Warman won 43.8% of the vote in the seat, while Hunter-Clarke achieved 33.8%, which was UKIP's second-highest vote share in any constituency in that election (after Clacton, the only constituency the party won). UKIP increased their vote share by 24.3% compared to the previous general election, while the Conservative share of the vote fell by 5.7%; this was the seventh-largest increase in vote share achieved by UKIP at the election. Out of the 650 constituencies in the United Kingdom, the seat was the 126th most marginal in terms of percentage majority and 115th most marginal when measured by number of votes.\n\nWarman's maiden speech (first speech as an MP) discussed the positive and negative effects of immigration on Boston and Skegness, saying that the pressures on public services \"allowed divisive, single-issue political campaigns to flourish\". Warman supported remaining in the European Union in the 2016 EU membership referendum. Nevertheless, the constituency is estimated to have had the highest vote share in favour of leaving the European Union (EU) in the EU referendum, at 75.6%.\n\nOn 29 April 2017, Paul Nuttall, the leader of UKIP at the time, announced that he was standing in Boston and Skegness, noting that the constituency had the highest Leave vote in the country. Shortly before the election, the BBC described Boston as \"Britain's unofficial Brexit capital\". Liberal Democrats and Labour also planned to contest the seat, with the Green Party intending to if they could find the funds for a deposit. (The Green Party did stand a candidate, as did a minor party called A Blue Revolution that only had one parliamentary candidate in the election.)\n\nNutall came in third place (with Labour second), winning just 7.7% of the vote; this was a decrease of 26.1% compared to 2015, and the third-largest percentage fall in UKIP vote share in that election. UKIP's share of the vote fell nationally in that election, and the result was still their seventh-highest vote share of any seat. The election saw UKIP achieve their worst result in the constituency since the 2001 general election. The Conservative majority increased to an all-time high in the seat, while Labour had their best result since 2005, achieving 25% of the votes cast. The Green Party and Liberal Democrats lost their deposits, mirroring the 2015 election results for both parties. Of the 46 constituencies in the East Midlands region, Boston and Skegness had the third lowest turnout at the election, at 62.7%.\n\nBased on estimates produced by Professor Chris Hanretty of Royal Holloway, University of London, Boston and Skegness had the third-highest vote share for the Brexit Party in the 2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom. According to Hanretty, 56.4% of votes cast in the constituency were for the new anti-EU party, which was led by Farage, behind only Castle Point and Clacton. Hanretty also estimated that the Conservatives came second in the seat, with 12.5% of the vote, followed by UKIP, who won 7.7%, their tenth strongest performance of the election. UKIP were closely followed by the Liberal Democrats and Labour, who came fourth and fifth with 7.5% and 7.4% of the vote respectively.\n\nDue to the high level of support for leaving the European Union in the constituency, the seat was discussed in 2019 as a potential target for the Brexit Party in the next general election; The Brexit Party achieved high levels of support in general election polls in June and July, and one estimate, by the website Electoral Calculus, suggested that the Brexit Party would gain Boston and Skegness. However, the Brexit Party support decreased over time, and in the run-up to the 2019 general election, which took place in December, some analysts thought that the large Conservative majority made victory there unlikely. Farage later announced that the Brexit Party would not stand in any constituency won by the Conservatives in 2017; the Brexit Party candidate was going to be Jonathan Bullock, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the East Midlands constituency. UKIP did not stand in the constituency; they only stood in 44 out of the 650 British seats at the election. In the election, held on 12 December, the Conservatives increased their majority further, winning 76.7% of the vote. This was the Conservatives' second-highest vote share in the election (after Castle Point). The seat was also the fifteenth-safest seat in the election (measured by percentage majority), and the second-safest Conservative seat after neighbouring South Holland and the Deepings.\n\n\"Holland with Boston and East Lindsey prior to 1997\"\n\n \n\n"}

{"id": "1808411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808411", "title": "MyDD", "text": "MyDD\n\nMyDD was the first large collaborative politically progressive American politics blog. It was established by Jerome Armstrong in 2001. Its name was originally short for \"My Due Diligence.\" In 2005, MyDD was profiled in Campaigns and Elections magazine, crediting the site with being \"the first major liberal blog.\" In January 2006, the name was changed to \"My Direct Democracy\" as part of a site redesign, with the new tagline \"Direct Democracy for People-Powered Politics.\"\n\nThe first Dean grassroots web site was created at MyDD in April 2002. In early 2003, Joe Trippi learned of Meetup through Armstrong and MyDD. Armstrong shut down MyDD in 2003 to work on Howard Dean's presidential campaign. After lying dormant for a year, MyDD was re-launched with the Scoop blogging platform in March 2004, with blogger Chris Bowers. MyDD was instrumental in online campaigning and organizing of grassroots action to elect Howard Dean as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee in January, 2005, with \"the pro-Dean site MyDD.com, which served as a key clearinghouse of information about the race.\" \nSeveral early contributors to MyDD became prominent in politics on the Internet. Markos Moulitsas Zúniga, founder of the most-visited political blog in the world, Daily Kos, began commenting on MyDD before starting his own blog in May 2002, and refers to Armstrong as his \"blogfather\".\n\nArmstrong attended the California State Democratic convention in Sacramento in March, 2003 with Markos Moulitsas of Daily Kos.\n\nMathew Gross, creator of the blog on Howard Dean's website, was another contributor to MyDD. Joe Trippi, former campaign manager for Howard Dean, met and hired Gross based on Gross' involvement with MyDD. \n\"One day, soon after we'd moved to a larger quarters in a South Burlington office park, I looked up to see this tall young guy with an earring and a nearly shaved head wandering around the office. Security had just grabbed him and was hauling him away when he yelled out to me: 'Wait! I blog on MyDD.com!' This was, of course, the political Web site where I'd first heard about Meetup.com. 'You're hired!' I yelled.\"\n\nOther notable bloggers on MyDD that went on to work with campaigns include Matt Stoller with Jon Corzine, Scott Shields with Bob Menendez, Tim Tagaris with Ned Lamont and Sherrod Brown, Melissa Ryan with Russ Feingold, Laura Packard with Debbie Stabenow and Bill Halter and Todd Beeton with Kirsten Gillibrand.\n\nThe site garnered a great deal of attention during the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election when Jerome Armstrong was the first source to break the exit polls at 1:58 PM EST.\n\nMyDD was profiled in late 2005 as part of the article \"Blogging Down the Money Trail\" in \"Campaigns and Elections\" magazine. The article focused on the special election in Ohio's second congressional district and the ability of blogs like MyDD, Daily Kos, and Swing State Project to raise funds for Democratic candidates and draw national attention to local races.\n\nDuring the 2006 midterm elections, MyDD's Chris Bowers launched two campaigns in October 2006 on MyDD.com before the 2006 congressional elections. The first was the \"Use it or Lose it\" to prompt safe Democrats to give 30 percent of their campaign funds to other Democratic causes; the second was a Google bomb campaign to raise the site listings for negative news articles on a set of Republican incumbents.\n\nThe \"Use It or Lose It\" campaign called on bloggers and Democratic activists to pressure Democrats in safe seats to ask them to give at least 30 percent of their campaign accounts to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee or directly to Democrats in competitive congressional races (subject to FEC limits). \"Safe\" Democrats was defined as those who were either running unopposed by a Republican, or whose Republican opponent raised less than $10,000 (and thus were not considered serious opponents). The lists of such Democrats were pulled from FEC filings. The campaign drew media attention and also brought MoveOn on board with their own page promoting the campaign.\n\nAlmost immediately after starting the \"Use it or Lose It\" campaign, Bowers began a Googlebomb campaign to increase the search results of a set of negative articles about endangered Republican congressional incumbents. The idea was to reach less-informed voters who might use Google to search for information on candidates, most often by simply entering the person's name. Taking advantage of the Google indexing algorithm, having many people link to these articles using the candidates' names, would raise their prominence in the search results.\n\nThe articles chosen were to be from non-partisan news sources, and factually negative about the chosen Republicans. Local news sources were preferred over national news. The chosen list included mainly such sources, but also some Wikipedia pages. The candidates chosen were culled from an initial list (chosen by Bowers) of 70, down to 52. The candidates cut were those whom a suitably credible and negative article could not be found.\n\nThe concept drew criticism from conservative bloggers although the right had used the same tactic against John Kerry in the 2004 election. In June 2007, front-pagers Matt Stoller and Chris Bowers left MyDD to found a new political blog, OpenLeft, which went online on July 9, 2007.\n\nFounder Jerome Armstrong was known in the blogosphere for his criticisms of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama. \"I was rooting that it would come down to Edwards and Clinton -- that to me represents a battle of Democratic values and ideas,\" said Armstrong. \"Obama's candidacy is really just personality-driven, wrapped with quasi-religious overtures.\" As a result, many of the supporters of rival candidate Hillary Clinton migrated to MyDD. However, MyDD was one of the few blogs to let bloggers from all the campaigns post on the front page. Longtime editor Jonathan Singer supported the Illinois Senator, and in June 2008, Josh Orton, the Netroots Nation political director and former Online Outreach director for Barack Obama, joined MyDD as a frontpage blogger. Peter Jukes, aka \"brit\" on MyDD, wrote a post-cap of the Obama-Clinton primary war on MyDD, titled, \"My Story: Flaming for Obama\" in September, 2008 for Prospect Magazine which detailed the combative primary on MyDD.\nThe authors of the blog during this period included Armstrong, Jonathan Singer, Josh Orton, Charles Lemos, Nathan Empsall, Jason Williams, and pseudonym authors desmoinesdemocrat, Senate Guru, and Texas Nate.\n\nMyDD has been largely dormant since 2010. Its founder, Jerome Armstrong explained that he “had to get out to save from becoming hardened, cynical, and without peace,” citing the negativity in American politics.\n\nArmstrong's last political post on the blog, from October 10, 2016, was entitled \"A blowout of historical proportion\" and predicted a crushing Clinton victory over Trump in the 2016 presidential election—one for \"the record books\". As of late 2019 the website is a generic product review site and no longer covers politics.\n\n"}

(14-18 in.) in length and double-edged, and although there is no universal design, the guard may be lobed with the hilt resembling that of a bollock dagger, or the pommel may be split or of the \"antenna\" type. The scabbard as much as anything else defines the acinaces and usually has a large decorative mount near the opening allowing it to be suspended from a belt on the wearer's right side.\n\nAncient texts say very little about the acinaces, other than that it was a type of \"Persian sword.\" Because of this, authors writing in Latin throughout history tended to equate the word with whatever type of weapon the contemporary Persians were using. Thus, it is frequently used in medieval Latin texts to mean scimitar or the like, a meaning it still retains in scientific Latin. Paulus Hector Mair even goes so far as to translate dussack as \"acinaces\", because it is curved like a scimitar, and likewise in the works of Jesuit authors describing Japan, \"acinaces\" is used for katana.\n\nHowever, the Persian shamshir is a relatively recent weapon, and did not exist in antiquity. The Achaemenid-era Persians made use of more than one kind of sword. Ancient Persian art typically shows the king's bodyguards and important nobles wearing ornate diagonal daggers. Greek art, on the other hand, frequently shows Persian soldiers using the kopis. One must therefore do some detective work to figure out which type is the acinaces.\n\nOne useful bit of evidence is that Greek and Roman texts sometimes mention the acinaces being given out by the king as a sign of favor. This would tend to point to the dagger.\n\nA ritual use of \"acinaces\", offered as a gift to the sea by the Persian king Xerxes, is also mentioned by Herodotus (\"History\", VII, 54), in the ritual contrition scene following the episode known as \"Flagellation of Hellespont\".\n\nA very revealing passage is found in Josephus' \"Jewish Antiquities\" 20.186, where the weapons used by the sicarii are described:\n\nThis also seems to indicate that it is the dagger which is properly called the acinaces though there are those who deny this, translating the above passage as \"concave like the Roman sica\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1808422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808422", "title": "Origin of Latter Day Saint polygamy", "text": "Origin of Latter Day Saint polygamy\n\nPolygamy, or plural marriage, in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is generally believed to have originated with the founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith. According to several of his associates, Smith taught that polygamy was a divine commandment and practiced it personally, by some accounts marrying more than 30 women, some of whom had existing marriages to other men. Evidence for Smith's polygamy is provided by the church's \"sealing\" records, affidavits, letters, journals, and diaries. However, until his death, Smith and the leading church quorums denied that he preached or practiced polygamy. Smith's son Joseph Smith III, his widow Emma Smith, and the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church, now called Community of Christ) challenged the evidence and taught that Joseph Smith had opposed polygamy. They instead claimed that Brigham Young, the head of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), introduced plural marriage after Smith's death. In 1852, leaders of the Utah-based LDS Church publicly announced the doctrine of polygamy.\n\nWhen polygamy was introduced into the Latter Day Saint movement is uncertain.\n\nSome scholars believe that Smith transcribed a revelation recommending polygamy on July 17, 1831. This revelation is described in a letter to Brigham Young written in 1861 by an early Mormon convert, William W. Phelps, thirty years after the revelation was said to be given. This was during a period when LDS Church leaders were justifying the practice and origins of plural marriage, particularly to Mormon splinter groups who did not agree with the practice.\n\nThe key portion of the revelation proclaims: \n\nThis wording is comparable with the portion of the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon, which corresponds to today's 2 Nephi 30:5–6, which states that when Native Americans receive the gospel they will become a \"white and a delightsome people.\" Unlike the 1831 revelation, the 1830 version of the Book of Mormon does not specify that the Native Americans would become \"white and delightsome\" through plural marriage. A note from Phelps in the same document explains how the conversion of the Native Americans coincided with Smith's plan for a new system of marriage: \n\nA reference was made to this revelation five months after its alleged date in a letter by Mormon apostate Ezra Booth to the \"Ohio Star\" on December 8, 1831, in which he refers to the \"revelation [that the Mormon Elders] form a matrimonial alliance with the Natives\", but the letter makes no reference to polygamy. This letter is significant in that it confirms the authenticity of the revelation, but some regard it as problematic because had it mentioned polygamy, Booth would have mentioned it in his anti-Mormon agenda. Three authors assert that a second record of the revelation exists, believed to be in the LDS Church's historical department, though its existence has not been confirmed by the church.\n\nThe LDS Church never published Phelps's note or letter, nor has it been canonized as part of Mormon scripture, which was done with many of Smith's other revelations. The church also never adopted a policy requiring or recommending that its members marry Native Americans. In 1943, historian Fawn Brodie stated that LDS Church historian Joseph Fielding Smith told her that a revelation foreshadowing polygamy had been written in 1831 but never published, and that although its existence in the church library is acknowledged, \"in conformity with the church policy\" Brodie would not be permitted to examine it.\n\nThough the 1831 revelation is cited by Mormon historians, non-Mormon historians, and critics, there are dissenting opinions, and no consensus has been reached.\n\nAfter Smith's death, many early converts, including apostles Brigham Young, Orson Pratt, and Lyman E. Johnson, said that Smith was teaching plural marriage as early as 1831 or 1832. Mary Elizabeth Rollins Lightner, Smith's ninth wife claimed that Smith had a private conversation with her in 1831 when she was twelve. \n\nPratt reported that Smith told some early members in 1831 and 1832 that plural marriage was a true principle, but that the time to practice it had not yet come. Johnson also claimed to have heard the doctrine from Smith in 1831. Mosiah Hancock reported that his father Levi W. Hancock was taught about plural marriage in the spring of 1832.\n\nWilliam Clayton, Smith's scribe, recorded polygamous marriages in 1843, including unions between Smith and Eliza Partridge, Emily Partridge, Sarah Ann Whitney, Helen Kimball, and Flora Woodworth.\n\nLatter Day Saint historical sources indicate that as early as 1832, Mormon missionaries were converting followers of religious leader Jacob Cochran, who went into hiding in 1830 to escape imprisonment for practicing polygamy. Mormons held two conferences at Saco, Maine, the center of Cochranism, on June 13, 1834, and August 21, 1835. At the latter conference, at least seven of the twelve newly-ordained Mormon apostles were in attendance, including Brigham Young. Young became acquainted with Cochran's followers as he made several missionary journeys through Cochranite territory from Boston to Saco, and later married Augusta Adams Cobb, a former Cochranite, as one of his plural wives. Others who spent time among the Cochranites were Orson Hyde and Smith's younger brother, Samuel.\n\nAmong Cochran's marital innovations was \"spiritual wifery\". Ridlon wrote in 1895, \"tradition assumes that [Cochran] received frequent consignments of spiritual consorts, and that such were invariably the most robust and attractive women in the community.\" Some new Cochranites remained polygamists, and moved from the east coast to the Mormon community of Kirtland, Ohio. Rumors of Mormon polygamy began to become public, enough to be denied in Mormon publications and mentioned in Mormon scripture in 1835, which noted: \n\nOn July 12, 1843, Joseph Smith is said to have received a revelation that is much more widely accepted by historians. The revelation was supposedly dictated by Smith to his scribe William Clayton, and was shared with Smith's wife Emma later that day. Clayton wrote in his journal: \n\nIn the text of the revelation, it also states that the first wife's consent should be sought before a man marries another wife, but also declares that Christ will \"destroy\" the first wife if she does not consent to the plural marriage, and that if consent is denied the husband is exempt from asking his wife's consent in the future.\n\nThe revelation states that plural wives \"are given unto him to multiply and replenish the earth, according to my commandment, and to fulfill the promise which was given by my Father before the foundation of the world, and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may bear the souls of men.\"\n\nThe revelation was not made public to the LDS Church as a whole until Brigham Young publicly acknowledged it in 1852. Young claimed that the original had been burned by Smith's widow Emma Smith, though Emma denied that the document ever existed and said of the story told by Young: \"It is false in all its parts, made out of whole cloth, without any foundation in truth.\" Published affidavits by eyewitnesses accusing church leaders of following the teaching and engaging in polygamy had resulted in Smith's murder by a mob in 1844. The revelation was codified in the LDS Church's canon as its Doctrine and Covenants in the 1870s. The 1843 revelation was rejected by the RLDS Church as not originating with Smith. Emma Smith said that the first she knew of the 1843 revelation was when she read of it in Orson Pratt's booklet \"The Seer\" in 1853.\n\nRecords show that Smith publicly preached and wrote against the doctrine of plural marriage; however, it is also clear that Smith performed dozens of plural marriages. Allegedly, \"several were still pubescent girls, such as fourteen-year-old Helen Mar Kimball\". Kimball, Smith's 28th wife, wrote of her experience in 1843–44, \n\nWritten accounts of Smith's alleged liaisons are recorded as early as 1831, including Smith's relationship with Fanny Alger (age 16), and with Marinda Nancy Johnson (age 16) in 1831.\n\nPoor documentation has led to estimates of the number of Smith's plural wives ranging from 33 to 48. Among the more notable alleged wives are the teenage servant Fanny Alger and future Relief Society president Eliza R. Snow. Historians generally conclude that Smith did have multiple wives, but as Compton has written, little is known of these marriages after the sealing ceremony. Allegations that Smith had at least one child born to a plural wife remain unproven. Helen Mar Kimball's testimony and some scholars suggest that many of these marriages were not consummated. Statements by William Law, Eliza R. Snow and Mary Lightner indicate that at least some of the marriages included sexual intimacy.\n\nThe general use of the terms \"sealing\" (which is a LDS priesthood ordinance that binds individuals together in the eternities) to refer to the unions rather than \"marriage\" (a social tradition in which the man and woman agree to be husband and wife in this life) may indicate that the participants did not understand sealing to equate to marriage. In the early days of the Latter Day Saint movement, ordinances and doctrines were not always well-defined, and it is possible that different participants had different understandings of the meaning of the sealings.\n\nScholars acknowledge that the tallies of Smith's plural wives include proxy sealings that occurred after Smith's death. Latter Day Saint denominations disagree as to the impact and meaning of these ceremonies. In the latter part of his life, Smith taught that all humans must be united or sealed to each other. He taught that a marriage that extends after death is also called \"sealing\", and that the power to perform such ceremonies was initially held only by him; members of the LDS Church believe that Smith passed the authority to the members of the Quorum of the Twelve.\n\nThe question of children from Smith's alleged plural wives has been raised since his death. Smith has not been proven to have had children other than those born to Emma Smith. , there are at least twelve early individuals who, based on historical documents and circumstantial evidence, have been identified as children of women sealed to Smith at the time of their births.\n\nIn 2005 and 2007 studies, a geneticist with the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation showed that five of these individuals were in fact not Smith descendants: Mosiah Hancock (son of Clarissa Reed Hancock); Oliver Buell (son of Prescindia Huntington Buell); Moroni Llewellyn Pratt (son of Mary Ann Frost Pratt); Zebulon Jacobs (son of Zina Diantha Huntington Jacobs Smith); and Orrison Smith (son of Fanny Alger). The remaining seven have yet to be tested, including Josephine Lyon, for whom current DNA testing cannot provide conclusive evidence either way. Lyon's mother, Sylvia Sessions Lyon, left her daughter a deathbed affidavit telling her she was Smith's daughter. Research into this history is complicated by Y-DNA genetic testing only being possible for descendants with an unbroken male line, and because two candidates died as infants.\n\nSmith was accused by Sarah Pratt in an 1886 interview with \"vitriolic anti-Mormon journalist W. Wyl\" of allowing John C. Bennett, a medical doctor, to perform abortions on polygamous wives who were legally single, which Pratt alleged limited Smith's progeny from these wives. She based this on statements made to her by Bennett. Orson Pratt, Sarah Pratt's husband, later considered Bennett a liar, but Sarah Pratt said, \"[I] know that the principle statements in John C. Bennett's book on Mormonism are true.\"\n\nJoseph Smith broke with short-lived church leader John C. Bennett in 1841 over the public scandal that arose when Bennett's practice of \"spiritual wifery\" became known, and Nauvoo, Illinois \"rocked with tales that connected Joseph with Bennett's scandals.\" Bennett accused Smith of subsequently introducing new code words for polygamy—\"celestial marriage\", \"plurality of wives\", \"spiritual wifeism\"—to conceal the controversial practice. Sarah Pratt claimed in an 1886 interview that while in Nauvoo over forty years earlier, Smith was attracted to her and intended to make her \"one of his spiritual wives.\" According to Bennett, while Pratt's husband Orson was in England on missionary service, Smith proposed to Sarah by invoking the 1843 polygamy revelation: \"Sister Pratt, the Lord has given you to me as one of my \"spiritual wives\". I have the blessings of Jacob granted me, as he granted holy men of old, and I have long looked upon you with favor, and hope you will not repulse or deny me\", to which Bennett claimed Pratt replied: \"Am I called upon to break the marriage covenant ... to my lawful husband! I never will. I care not for the blessings of Jacob, and I believe in NO SUCH revelations, neither will I consent under any circumstances. I have one good husband, and that is enough for me.\"\n\nPublished allegations of adultery against Sarah Pratt and Bennett appeared in local and church publications with signed affidavits from her neighbors Stephen and Zeruiah Goddard and others. Robert D. Foster made the following allegation against Bennett and Pratt: \n\nPratt later claimed that Zeruiah Goddard told her these testimonies were made under threat from Smith's brother Hyrum: \n\nVan Wagoner has concluded that the adultery charges against Sarah Pratt are \"highly improbable\" and could \"be dismissed as slander.\" In addition to Pratt, Van Wagoner states that Nancy Rigdon and Martha Brotherton \"also suffered slanderous attacks because they exposed the Church's private polygamy posture.\" Orson Pratt stood by his wife in preference to the denials of Smith, who had told him \"[i]f [Orson] did believe his wife and follow her suggestions he would go to hell\". Wilford Woodruff stated that \"Dr. John Cook Bennett was the ruin of Orson Pratt\". Van Wagoner and Walker note that, on August 20, 1842, \"after four days of fruitless efforts at reconciliation, the Twelve excommunicated Pratt for 'insubordination' and Sarah for 'adultery. However, after a brief period of estrangement from Smith and the church in 1842, Orson Pratt labeled Bennett a liar: \n\nFirst Presidency member Sidney Rigdon wrote a letter to the \"Messenger and Advocate\" in 1844 condemning the conduct of the Quorum of the Twelve, \n\nAccording to Van Wagoner, \n\nRumours of Smith's involvement with polygamy continued to circulate in Nauvoo, to which Smith responded on May 26, 1844: \n\nA group of former church members were in open conflict with Smith for various economic and political reasons, and because Smith had disciplined some of them in church courts for adultery, thievery, and other crimes. William Law, a member of the First Presidency, became the head of this group. Accusations of polygamy among church leaders were published by the group in the \"Nauvoo Expositor\" on June 7, 1844, in which several signed and notarized affidavits from eyewitnesses were reproduced. The affidavit by Law stated, \"Hyrum Smith [read] a revelation from God, he said that he was with Joseph when it was received. ... The revelation (so called) authorized certain men to have more wives than one at a time.\" The affidavit by Austin Cowles stated, \"In the latter part of the summer, 1843, the Patriarch, Hyrum Smith, did in the High Council, of which I was a member, introduce what he said was a revelation given through the Prophet [containing] the doctrine of a plurality of wives.\"\n\nBoth Joseph and his brother Hyrum, days before their murder by a mob, spoke about the accusations at a Nauvoo city council meeting of June 8, 1844. The meeting's purpose was ostensibly to address the \"Nauvoo Expositor\"s accusations of Mormon licentiousness, though after two days of consultation, Smith and the Nauvoo city council voted on June 10, 1844 to declare the paper a public nuisance and ordered the paper's printing press destroyed. The published minutes quote Hyrum making references \"to the Revelation read to the High Council of the Church, which has caused so much talk about multiplicity of wives; that said Revelation was in answer to a question concerning things which transpired in \"former\" days, and had no reference to the present time [original emphasis]. Following Hyrum, Joseph Smith said \"they make a criminality for a man to have a wife on earth while he has one in heaven\" and that \"the Revelation was given in view of eternity\": 'He received for answer, men in this life must marry in view of eternity, otherwise they must remain as angels, or be single in heaven, which was the amount of the Revelation referred to[.].\n\nIn H. Michael Marquardt's opinion, \"this was an attempt by Smith to obscure the real intent of the revelatory message,\" and W. E. La Rue emphasizes the contradiction between the statements of the two brothers. J. L. Clark writes that Hyrum's statement \"appeared in the Nauvoo \"Neighbor\" of June 19, 1844, but was omitted from [B. H. Roberts's book] \"History of the Church\", published years later in Utah.\"\n\nJoseph and Hyrum Smith were subsequently jailed and charged with treason against the state of Illinois for declaring martial law in Nauvoo. On June 27, 1844, in spite of a promise of protection from Illinois governor Thomas Ford, a mob attacked the prison and killed both brothers, an event that prompted a succession crisis that led to schisms in the Latter Day Saint movement that continue to this day. The majority of the Latter Day Saints followed Brigham Young when he led the Mormon Exodus to the Salt Lake Valley in 1846–47. Some Latter Day Saints remained in Illinois and the surrounding states and selected different leaders.\n\nIn Utah Territory, Young led the LDS Church. The doctrine of plural wives was officially announced by Orson Pratt and Young at a special conference at the Salt Lake Tabernacle on August 28, 1852, and reprinted in an extra edition of the \"Deseret News\", where Pratt stated: \n\nYoung expounded on Pratt's words later that day. Young's proclamation began: \n\nAdditionally, the apostle Parley Pratt taught in an official church periodical in 1853 that, \"We have now clearly shown that God the Father had a plurality of wives,\" and that after the death of Mary (the mother of Jesus) she may have become another eternal polygamous wife of God.\n\nFollowing the 1852 official sanction, top leaders used the examples of the polygamy of God the Father and Jesus Christ in defense of it, and these teachings on God and Jesus' polygamy were widely accepted among Mormons by the late 1850s. In 1853 Jedediah Grant who later become a First Presidency member stated that the top reason behind the persecution of Christ and his disciples was their due to their practice of polygamy. Two months later the apostle Orson Pratt taught in an official church periodical that \"We have now clearly shown that God the Father had a plurality of wives,\" and that after her death, Mary (the mother of Jesus) may have become another eternal polygamous wife of God. He also stated that Christ had multiple wives as further evidence in defense of polygamy. In the next two years the apostle Orson Hyde also stated during two general conference addresses that Jesus practiced polygamy and repeated this in an 1857 address. This teaching was alluded to by church president Brigham Young in 1870 and then First Presidency member Joseph F. Smith in 1883.\n\nUnder Young, the practice of polygamy spread among Utah Mormons for 40 years. During this time, an estimated 20 to 25 percent of adults in the LDS Church were members of polygamist households. One third of the women of marriageable age and nearly all of the church leadership were involved in the practice. In 1890, the church repealed the practice of polygamy while under pressure by the United States government. The repeal was directed by revelation to church president Wilford Woodruff and published as the 1890 Manifesto. Polygamy was definitively ended in the LDS Church with the Second Manifesto in 1905.\n\nThough the LDS Church accepts that Joseph Smith taught and practiced plural marriage, other branches of the Latter Day Saint movement reject this position. Traditionally, the strongest rejection came from the RLDS Church. In the late-nineteenth century, the origin of polygamy was one of the principal issues that the RLDS Church and the LDS Church used to assert one organization's legitimacy over the other. Joseph F. Smith, sixth president of the LDS Church, stated in responding to the claim that polygamy originated with Brigham Young rather than Joseph Smith: \n\nThe first RLDS Church's leader was Joseph Smith's oldest son Joseph Smith III. Smith III's opinions about his father and polygamy evolved throughout his life. In general, however, Smith III was an ardent opponent of plural marriage. Throughout his tenure as Prophet–President of the RLDS Church, Smith denied his father's involvement and attributed its invention to Brigham Young. Smith III served many missions to the western United States where he met with associates and women who claimed to be his father's widows. In the end, Smith concluded that he was \"not positive nor sure that [his father] was innocent\" and that if, indeed, the elder Smith had been involved, it was still a false practice.\n\nFrom the 1880s to the 1960s, official RLDS Church publications maintained Joseph Smith's noninvolvement in polygamy. This official position contradicted the testimony of earlier RLDS Church members who lived in Nauvoo during Smith's lifetime.\n\nOne of the founders of the Reorganization, Jason W. Briggs, a presiding elder in Wisconsin during the early 1840s, maintained throughout his life that Smith had originated polygamy and that God would punish Smith for his \"transgressions.\" Briggs said that the church needed to simply deal with the issue and move on. The editor of the earliest official RLDS Church periodical, Isaac Sheen, similarly affirmed Smith's involvement. He wrote that Smith produced a revelation on polygamy and practiced it, but that he repented of this \"sin\" before his death. Sheen's statement was affirmed by William Marks, the stake president of Nauvoo during Smith's lifetime and a close counselor to Joseph Smith III. Marks claimed to have seen Hyrum Smith read the polygamy revelation to the High Council in 1843. Marks also affirmed that Joseph Smith had repented of the practice two to three weeks before his death in 1844. Similarly, James Whitehead, an RLDS Church member and clerk for Smith, affirmed that Emma Smith gave plural wives to Smith on several occasions that he witnessed. Early in his presidency, Joseph Smith III did not believe Marks and Whitehead despite the eyewitness nature of their statements.\n\nCommunity of Christ, formerly the RLDS Church, no longer makes definitive statements that Smith was uninvolved in polygamy. The church's current approach is to stress its historical abhorrence of polygamy, that members of the church and the leadership are open to continue their \"ongoing quest for truth\", and that the \"Community of Christ takes into account the growing body of scholarly research and publications depicting the polygamous teachings and practices of the Nauvoo period of church history (1840–1846)\". Further, \n\nA segment of church members continue to deny Smith's complicity, although the church no longer views the issue as important. For people concerned about the topic and how it relates to the RLDS tradition, the issue remains as much about current liberal versus conservative church politics as it does an issue of history.\n\nModern RLDS Restorationists (such as the Restoration Branches), who have broken with Community of Christ, continue to contend that polygamy originated with Brigham Young and not with Joseph Smith. They note that the revelation endorsing polygamy and attributed to Smith was first presented by Young to his followers eight years after Smith's death; they point to this delay as suggestive that the revelation did not originate with Smith. As further evidence, they often cite Smith's own critical words on the subject of polygamy. They do not see the isolated statements to the contrary by early RLDS Church leaders such as Sheen, Marks, or Briggs as credible, and they deny the legitimacy and truthfulness of sources that are commonly cited to prove that Smith was practicing or promoting plural marriage.\n\n\n"}

Palmer in command.\n\n\"Iroquois\" got underway from New York on 19 January 1860 for duty in the Mediterranean. Her service came at a time of political unrest in Europe, with the movement for Italian unification in its beginning stages. \"Iroquois\" sailed for Palermo, Sicily, to protect American lives and property as Giuseppe Garibaldi began his campaign to capture the island for Piedmont-Sardinia. The Italian patriot came on board \"Iroquois\" on 20 June 1860 and conferred with Comdr. Palmer. The ship operated in the Mediterranean into 1861, but the impending Civil War brought greater demands on the Navy and she was recalled.\n\nArriving 15 June 1861 at New York, she was immediately sent to the Caribbean to seek and destroy Southern commerce raiders. At Martinique she found CSS \"Sumter\" anchored in the harbor. But the Confederate ship, under command of Raphael Semmes, with the assistance of French authorities slipped out on 23 November to resume attacks on Union shipping. \"Iroquois\" continued her patrol in the Caribbean. On 14 January 1862 she stopped British sloop \"Rinaldo\". On board were Confederate ministers James M. Mason and John Slidell, captured earlier by Union ships but released; Comdr. Palmer allowed them to proceed under surveillance.\n\n\"Iroquois\" was sent later in 1862 to join Flag Officer David Farragut at the mouth of the Mississippi River, in preparation for his attack on New Orleans, Louisiana. Arriving off Ship Island 28 March, the ship moved to a position below Forts Jackson and St. Philip, guarding New Orleans, 16 April. Comdr. David Dixon Porter's mortar boats then began a devastating bombardment, and by 24 April the ships were ready to attack. \"Iroquois\" moved abreast the forts as part of the 3rd Division under Captain Henry H. Bell and, after a spirited engagement, passed them and pressed on for the capture of New Orleans, the South's largest and wealthiest city, and key to the Mississippi Valley.\n\nAfter the great victory \"Iroquois\" advanced up the river with Farragut, with the aim of eventually joining Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote, who was driving southward. A landing party was sent ashore at Baton Rouge, Louisiana 8 May 1862 and Comdr. Palmer received the surrender of the Louisiana capital that day. \"Iroquois\", along with , also took possession of Natchez on 13 May as the fleet moved steadily toward the Southern stronghold at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Within a week they were below the city and preparing to pass the formidable batteries.\n\nAfter periodic shelling Flag Officer Farragut, supported by the mortar boats, passed the Vicksburg batteries on 28 June after a heavy exchange of gunfire. \"Iroquois\" survived the action virtually unscathed. With the rest of the fleet she met Flag Officer Charles Davis and his Western Flotilla above Vicksburg. This was but the first step of Abraham Lincoln's order to \"clear the river.\" \"Iroquois\" remained in the Vicksburg area until late July, helping in the bombardments and preparations for expeditions into the surrounding marshlands. In early September she again entered the Gulf of Mexico to take part in the strangling blockade of Southern commerce, but boiler trouble sent her north on 21 September he arrived New York 2 October and decommissioned 6 October 1862 for repairs.\n\n\"Iroquois\" recommissioned on 8 January 1863, Comdr. Henry Roland in command, and got underway later that month to convoy monitor to Newport News, Virginia. Joining the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron off North Carolina, she captured blockade runner \"Merrimac\" 24 July and helped in the capture of \"Kate\" 12 days earlier. After several more months on arduous blockade, she steamed to Baltimore, Maryland for repairs, decommissioning 8 October 1863.\n\nThe ship recommissioned 31 March 1864, Comdr. Christopher R. P. Rodgers in command. After serving briefly in the North Atlantic, \"Iroquois\" steamed to the Mediterranean to protect American commerce and interests. She also took part in the giant search for the Confederate raider \"Shenandoah\", finally arriving Singapore in May 1865 after a long voyage around South America and across the Pacific. With the war over, she sailed in July for the United States, arriving New York on 1 October 1865. She decommissioned there 6 October 1865.\n\nUpon recommissioning on 7 January 1867, Comdr. Earl English in command, the veteran ship sailed 3 February for duty with the Asiatic Squadron. She was present at Osaka, Japan, when that port and neighboring Hyōgo were opened to foreign commerce 1 January 1868; and she took part in the rescue operations following the overturning of Rear Admiral Henry H. Bell's boat in the harbor 11 January. Despite the best efforts of the ships present, the squadron commander and 11 others were drowned. During the local conflicts which engulfed the ports during January, \"Iroquois\" stood by to protect American interests, and carried the foreign ministers to Hyōgo 1 February when they were expelled from Osaka. She remained on this critical duty until returning to the United States in February 1870. She was decommissioned at League Island, Pennsylvania, 23 April 1870.\n\n\"Iroquois\" was recommissioned on 23 August 1871 under Commander H. A. Adams. While in the Delaware River on 7 September of that year, Ordinary Seaman Hugh King jumped overboard and rescued a shipmate from drowning, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. \"Iroquois\" operated on the East Coast until 18 March 1872. She then sailed for another cruise with the Asiatic Fleet, making the long voyage via the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, and the Indian Ocean. The ship remained off China and Japan until returning to San Francisco, California on 1 July 1874. She was again decommissioned for repairs on 23 July 1874.\n\nFollowing a long period of inactivity, \"Iroquois\" recommissioned on 12 April 1882, Comdr. James H. Sands in command. With the Pacific Squadron, she patrolled to South America, Hawaii, Australia, and Pacific islands protecting American interests and commerce. She took part in naval action in Panama in the spring of 1885, helping to land Marines to protect American commerce during the revolution.\n\nIn 1889, the \"Iroquois\" was sent to Samoa, to reinforce American forces in the aftermath of the 1889 Apia cyclone. Her engines broke down after leaving Honolulu and she spent the next eighty-two days being blown around the Pacific before washing up in Port Townsend, Washington. After repairs at Mare Island, during which forty of her crew deserted, she again set out for Samoa. Future Marine Corps commandants George Barnett and Ben Fuller served on her during this episode. Returning from Samoa, \"Iroquois\" arrived Mare Island on 24 April 1892 and decommissioned there 12 May 1892.\n\nThe ship was transferred to the Marine Hospital Service and served until she recommissioned 13 December 1898, Lt. Charles F. Pond in command. She cruised in the Pacific for six months before decommissioning at Honolulu, Hawaii 30 June 1899. \"Iroquois\" was then transferred again to the Marine Hospital Service. Her name was changed to \"Ionie\" 30 November 1904. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 26 August 1910.\n\n\n"}

The lake has a layer of fresh water overlying an anoxic salt water layer. The meromictic lakes and ponds of the Gordon River were discovered by D. A. Hodgson and Professor Peter Tyler.\n\nIt became evident that, following the establishment of a hydro-electric power industry on the Gordon River, the flows of fresh water into the lake were disturbed and the anoxic salt layer was declining in depth. Previously, low river flows at certain times of the year allowed salt water to migrate upriver and occasionally spill into Lake Fidler through a narrow channel joining it to the river, thus recharging the salt water layer.\n\nIn 2004, Hydro Tasmania gained state and federal approval to recharge the lake with seawater drawn from the sea outside Macquarie Harbour at the mouth of the Gordon River. This involved having a sea-going tug draw up approximately of salt water in lots of approximately , and discharge the water through a diffuser that allowed the seawater to settle into the lower salt layer. (See diagrams at Hydro Tasmania press release, 18 June 2004) This was completed and the results confirmed in April 2005. However, it was noted that, if no natural recharging occurs, the process of recharging may need to be repeated in about 10–15 years.\n\n\n\n"}

He is sometimes known as the \"Father of traffic safety\", despite never having learned to drive a car himself.\n\nAmong the innovations credited to Eno are traffic regulations, the stop sign, the pedestrian crosswalk, the traffic circle, the one-way street, the taxi stand, and pedestrian safety islands. His rotary traffic plan was put into effect at Columbus Circle, New York City, in 1905, at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, 1907, Piccadilly Circus in 1926, and the Rond Point on the Champs-Élysées in 1927.\n\nEno was born in New York City, the youngest child of Amos R. Eno and his wife, Lucy Jane Phelps, daughter of Elisha Phelps. He attended Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven and Williston Academy, and graduated from Yale University in 1882, where he had been a member of Skull and Bones. Eno died of bronchopneumonia, and is buried in Center Cemetery, Simsbury, Connecticut.\n\nThough automobiles were rare until Eno was an older man, horse-drawn carriages were already causing significant traffic problems in urban areas like Eno's home town of New York City. In 1867, at the age of 9, he and his mother were caught in a traffic jam. He later wrote, \"That very first traffic jam (many years before the motor car came into use) will always remain in my memory. There were only about a dozen horses and carriages involved, and all that was needed was a little order to keep the traffic moving. Yet nobody knew exactly what to do; neither the drivers nor the police knew anything about the control of traffic.\" As reported in 1909:\n\nIn 1900, Eno wrote a piece on traffic safety entitled \"Reform in Our Street Traffic Urgently Needed\". In 1903, he wrote a city traffic code for New York, the first such code in the world, and subsequently designed traffic plans for New York, London, and Paris.\n\nDuring that same year, Eno proposed the first version of today's roundabouts or traffic circles, which he termed \"the rotary or gyratory traffic system\". In his 1920 book, Eno recalled that \"in 1903, the New York Police Department asked that a plan be suggested for Columbus Circle, where accidents were occurring almost daily. It was advised that vehicles should keep to the right, going around the circle in one direction instead of two. In 1905, the plan was put in operation... In 1907, the system was put in operation at the \"Arc de Triomphe\" in Paris, but whether due to the suggestion sent them from New York or not is not clear.\" His 1909 book, \"Street Traffic Regulation\", contains a diagram of the Columbus Circle rotary. The stop sign has 8 sides. \nEno also appears to have introduced one-way streets, as recalled in \"The Science of Highway Traffic Regulation 1899-1920\", page 39: \"On the author's advice, One-Way Traffic was put in force in a few streets in New York in the spring of 1908; in Boston in the autumn of the same year; in Paris in 1909, where it has since been greatly extended, and in Buenos Aires in 1910. It is now used in many cities throughout the world.\"\n\nIn 1921 Eno founded the Eno Foundation for Highway Traffic Control in Westport, Connecticut, today known as the Eno Center for Transportation. The Foundation is a non-profit organization with the mission of improving transportation policy and leadership. His Westport office has been recreated as the William Phelps Eno Memorial Center in the Simsbury Free Library in Simsbury, Connecticut.\n\nEno was awarded the cross of the Legion of Honour by the French government, and was one of the first honorary members of the Institute of Transportation Engineers. He was a member of the New York Yacht Club and the first owner of the steam yacht \"Aquilo\", built in Boston in 1901.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1808509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808509", "title": "Paradise flycatcher", "text": "Paradise flycatcher\n\nThe paradise flycatchers (\"Terpsiphone\") are a genus of birds in the family Monarchidae. The genus ranges across Africa and Asia, as well as a number of islands. A few species are migratory, but the majority are resident. The most telling characteristic of the genus is the long tail streamers of the males of many species. In addition to the long tails the males and females are sexually dimorphic and have rufous, black and white plumage.\n\nThe genus \"Terpsiphone\" was introduced by the German zoologist Constantin Gloger in 1827. The type species was subsequently designated as the Indian paradise flycatcher. The name is from the Ancient Greek \"terpsi \" \"delighting in\" and \"phonos\" \"murder\".\n\nThe genus contains 16 species:\n\nFormerly, some authorities also considered the following species (or subspecies) as species within the genus \"Terpsiphone\":\n\nThe paradise flycatchers are generally small birds, around in length and weighing . They have a medium length grey or blueish bill which is broad and hooked at the end and is surrounded by stiff rictal bristles. The inside of the mouths of paradise-flycatchers are brightly coloured, being either yellow or green. The tails are long, particularly in many species where the male has a massively elongated pair of middle tail feathers. These tail streamers are 195 mm long in the male São Tomé paradise flycatcher and 412 mm long in the male Indian paradise flycatcher. The function of the long tail is assumed to be related to sexual selection, with females choosing males based on the length of the tail. Not all species have long tail streamers, for example the blue paradise flycatcher of Palawan in Asia and the Bedford's paradise flycatcher of montane Africa do not have exceptionally long tails. In most species the tail is longer than the wing, even in the shorter tailed females. The eye is surrounded by an eyering that is a blue thin wattle (slightly more pronounced in some species like the rufous paradise flycatcher).\n\nThe plumage of the paradise flycatchers is sexually dimorphic, with rufous, white and black being the most common colours; one species has blue plumage and a few have traces of maroon. Sexual dimorphism can be pronounced (and of course more so in the long-tailed males) or subtle; the female Bedford's paradise flycatcher is identical to the male except slightly duller. Some species sport prominent crests. In some species, for example the Malagasy paradise flycatcher, the males have two or more colour morphs.\n\nThe paradise flycatchers make a range of vocalisations, these range from whistling songs to harsher calls. These songs and calls are typical of the monarch flycatchers. The songs are simpler in the Asian species, for example the call of the Japanese paradise flycatcher is a repeated three syllable whistle. The songs of the African species are more complex and, in the case of species with a large range, vary geographically. The calls are generally simple and are harsh and grating.\n\nThe paradise flycatchers have the widest distribution of any of the monarch flycatchers, ranging across sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and East Asia. At the northern extreme of its range it reaches Korea and Afghanistan. The species also occurs on a number of islands, including those of Indonesia and the Philippines, Taiwan, and Japan, as well as Madagascar, the Mascarenes and the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean and São Tomé off Africa's Atlantic coast.\n\nSeveral species of paradise flycatcher are migratory. The Japanese paradise flycatcher is almost entirely migratory, breeding in Korea and Japan and wintering in the Philippines, Malaysia and Sumatra. It does however also occur in Taiwan, where the population is apparently resident. The Indian paradise flycatcher ranges across the Indian subcontinent and adjoining regions. The movements of the other species are not fully understood, but most are thought to be resident. Several subspecies of the African paradise flycatcher are apparently intra-African migrants, but little is known about these movements.\n\nThe paradise flycatchers inhabit a range of habitat types, from rainforest to montane forest, woodlands, savanna, mangroves, riparian forest, deciduous forests and bamboo groves, some species will also move into gardens and cultivated habitat.\n\nParadise flycatchers, like all monarch flycatchers, are monogamous and are generally territorial, although in some cases birds may nest close together and defend the nests together against predators. Females apparently select males based on their tail length, a form of sexual selection. Paradise flycatchers are unusual as exaggerated sexual traits are usually found in promiscuous birds, not monogamous ones. The nests of this genus are neat deep cups placed on a branch or twig, often in a fork. They are usually placed 1–3 m off the ground. They are often very conspicuous, particularly when the long-tailed males are incubating. The nests are, however, aggressively defended by the pair. Amongst the pair duties are shared but not equally. For example, in the Malagasy paradise flycatcher the female undertakes more brooding responsibilities whereas the male spends more time guarding the nest.\n\nThe paradise flycatchers are, as their name suggests, insectivores, feeding on a variety of insects, usually obtained on the wing. They use a variety of foraging techniques, including hawking from a perch, sallying, hovering, gleaning, and flush-pursuiting. They will join mixed-species feeding flocks, for example the Madagascar paradise flycatcher will regularly form small two species flocks with the common newtonia while foraging.\n"}

The nine-chapter novel was posthumously published in 1934 as part of published by . Four versions are known to be in existence, with the last one being the most famous among Japanese readers.\n\nThe novel was adapted as a 1985 anime film of the same title as well as various stage musicals and plays.\n\nGiovanni is a lonely boy, whose father is away on a long fishing trip, while his mother is ill at home. As a result, the young Giovanni must undertake paid jobs before and after school, delivering papers and setting type at the printers, in order to provide food for his poor family. These adult responsibilities leave him with no time to study or socialize, and he is ridiculed by his classmates. Apart from Giovanni's mother and sister, the only person who really cares for him is his former playmate Campanella, whose father is a close friend of Giovanni's father.\n\nDuring a lesson about the galaxy, the teacher asks Giovanni what the Milky Way is made of. Giovanni knows it is formed of stars, but is unable to say so, and Campanella does the same to save Giovanni from further teasing by the rest of the class. At the end of the lesson, the teacher encourages all the children to attend the festival of stars that evening. Upon returning home, Giovanni finds that no milk was delivered that day, so he heads out to the dairy to fetch it for his mother's dinner. Giovanni only encounters an elderly woman at the dairy, and once he pleads that his ill mother needs her milk that night, the woman advises him to come back later.\n\nGiovanni intends to watch the festival with Campanella, but on his way into town, he is mocked by his schoolmates for expecting an otter-skin coat from his father. Upset by this taunt, Giovanni flees from the town and walks alone to the top of a nearby hill. As he gazes up at the Milky Way in the sky above, Giovanni suddenly finds himself with Campanella onboard a steam train, which travels past the Northern Cross and many other stars in its journey across the galaxy. The two boys witness many amazing sights and meet various people, including scholars excavating a fossil from sands of white crystal, and a man who catches herons to turn them into candy.\n\nWhen a ticket inspector appears, Giovanni discovers he has a rare ticket which allows him to go anywhere that the train runs. Shortly after, the boys are joined in their seats by a tutor and two children, Kaoru and Tadashi, who were onboard a ship that sank after hitting an iceberg, (possibly the \"Titanic\"). As the train passes the flame of Scorpio, Kaoru recalls that it was once a scorpion who ate other insects, but perished in a well after escaping a weasel; regretting that it did not sacrifice itself for a good cause, the scorpion prayed to bring happiness to others in the next life, and its body burst into a bright flame that still burns in the night sky.\n\nThe train next stops at the Southern Cross, where all the other passengers disembark for the Christian heaven, leaving only Giovanni and Campanella onboard as the train continues its journey. Giovanni pledges that they should go on together for ever, and vows to follow Scorpio's example of bringing true happiness to everyone. However, as the train approaches the Coalsack - a hole in the sky - Campanella sees what he considers 'the true heaven', where his mother is waiting for him, and suddenly vanishes from the train, leaving Giovanni alone in despair.\n\nGiovanni wakes up on the hilltop, and initially dismisses his journey through the Milky Way as a dream. He heads back to the dairy, where this time he collects a bottle of milk from a farmer, who explains that an escaped calf drank half of the day's milk supply. As Giovanni passes through town on his way home, he learns that Campanella has fallen into the river while saving another boy from drowning. Giovanni hurries to the river, in fear of what he already knows, and finds Campanella's father just as he sadly gives up searching for his son, believing Campanella to have drowned. He tells Giovanni that he has received a letter from his father, announcing that he will be home soon. Continuing homeward to deliver this news and the milk to his mother, Giovanni secretly knows where Campanella went, and vows to stay strong throughout life.\n\nThis story contains a religious question by author Kenji Miyazawa. The main theme of this story is \"what is true happiness?\"\n\nAfter Miyazawa's most beloved sister Toshi died in 1922, Miyazawa, in sorrow, went on a railroad trip to Sakhalin. He started working on this novel soon afterward in 1924, and this trip is said to be the basis of the story. He kept on polishing the work steadily until his death in 1933. The middle part of the novel was never completed but was published as it is nevertheless.\n\nA tribute to those who give themselves to others is a recurring theme throughout the storyline, and according to Hasebe (2000), they are reflections of Miyazawa's philosophy of self-sacrifice, a view appearing in many other juvenile novels of his such as \"Yodaka no Hoshi\" and \"Guskō Budori no Denki\". Meanwhile, Suzuki (2004) interprets them as representing a \"holistic thought of Ecosystem\".\n\nThe story was made into a 1985 anime film directed by Gisaburo Sugii based on a screenplay by Minoru Betsuyaku. It was released on July 13, 1985, and features Mayumi Tanaka as Giovanni and Chika Sakamoto as Campanella.\n\nPlaywright Sō Kitamura made the story into a drama titled . Note that 想稿 could be a play on the word and the character carrying meanings such as \"conception\" or \"idea\". Premièred in 1986, the play was performed by Kitamura's theatrical company Project Navi.\n\nA part in a 2002 play consisting of various works by Kenji written by Yutaka Narui for a theatrical company Caramelbox, features the story by the name of . It follows through the episodes in the novel rather briefly. The play also includes some lines by Professor Burukaniro, which appear only in the first three versions of the novel.\n\nWarabiza, a performing arts company in Akita Prefecture, made a musical version of the story. The musical premièred in April 2004 and toured around Japan until March 2007.\n\nThis is an illustrated book with music, launched in 2011 as an application for Apple Inc.'s iPad. Using the final fourth draft of Miyazawa's original as the source text, this version is made up of 272 pages, an unusually large number for a picture book. Apple Japan has recommended the Japanese version as an educational application.\n\n\n\nAs copyright for the novel has expired in Japan (and most of the world), Aozora Bunko distributes full text of the novel for free.\n\n\n"}

Its HD2 subchannel carries a Blues format, known as \"Waterfront Blues Radio.\"\n\nKGON's offices and studios are located south of Downtown Portland on Bancroft Street. The transmitter site is in the city's Southwest Hills district, off SW Seymour Street. KGON has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 97,000 watts (100,000 watts with beam tilt). It covers much of Northwestern Oregon and Southwestern Washington. \n\nKGON competes with iHeartMedia-owned \"The Brew\" 105.9 KFBW. The Brew plays mostly rock from the 1980s, 90s and a few 2000s titles, while KGON goes back as far as The Beatles for some selections and rarely plays titles later than 1990. At 10 p.m. on weeknights, KGON carries \"The Mens Room,\" a syndicated hot talk show from co-owned KISW in Seattle. The rest of KGON's weekday schedule is made up of local DJs.\n\nThe station signed on the air on December 6, 1967 as KLIQ-FM. It was the FM counterpart to AM 1290 KLIQ, which is no longer on the air. The two stations were owned by the Cascade Broadcasting Company and simulcast a talk radio format. But because KLIQ was a daytimer, programming could only be heard on KLIQ-FM after dark.\n\nIn 1973, as more people bought radios that received FM stations, KLIQ-FM changed ownership. It was bought by KYXI, Incorporated, the same firm that owned AM 1520 KYXI (now KQRR). The new owners changed the format to album-oriented rock, with the new call sign KGON. That put KGON in competition with 101.9 KINK, which went on the air in 1968 as a freeform radio station, along with 106.7 KQIV, which signed on in 1972 playing progressive rock. KGON was programmed with a more structured format, playing only the most popular tracks from the top-selling rock albums.\n\nKGON's new format debuted on February 1, 1974, with \"Here Comes the Sun\" by The Beatles as its first song. It would continue in this direction until November 4, 1992, when it shifted to its current classic rock direction.\n\nIn 1992, KGON and AM 1520 KYXI were bought by Apogee Communications for $5.5 million. In 1995, the station changed hands after just three years when Entercom acquired KGON.\n\n"}

He was enthroned as a Pope of Alexandria on the second day of Pi Kogi Enavot, 863 A.M. (25 August 1147).\n\nDuring his papacy, the Copts were persecuted by the Muslim governors and Caliphs. Many were killed and sold as slaves. Several churches in Cairo, such as the church of Saint Menas in Saint Mary Church (Haret Elroum) and the church of \"El-Zohari\", were plundered and destroyed. They were later rebuilt by the Coptic layman Abu El-Fakhr Salib Ibn Mikhail. It was also at this time (1164 AD) that Saint Bashnouna was killed by the Muslims. Around the end of his papacy, tensions rose between him and Mark Ibn Kunbar, a priest who preached against the practice of private confession of sins, resulting in Kunbar's excommunication.\n\nAccording to the \"History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria\", the Emperor of Ethiopia wrote to John in 1152 for a new \"abuna\" or Metropolitan, because Abuna Mikael was too old; his request was denied. Although the name of the Emperor was not recorded, Carlo Conti Rossini identified him as Mara Takla Haymanot, arguing from this exchange that the true reason a new \"abuna\" was wanted was that Abuna Mikael refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the new Zagwe Dynasty. Pope John denied this request and was subsequently arrested and imprisoned for two weeks during the reign of the Fatimid caliph Al-Zafir.\n\nDuring John's papacy, the expression \"Life-giving\" was added to the liturgical confession, which became: \"This is the Life-giving Flesh that Thine Only-Begotten Son, Our Lord, God and Savior, Jesus Christ, took from our Lady ...\".\n\nPope John V died on 4 Pashons, 882 A.M.

Reed and starring Seamus O'Brien, Luis De Jesus, Viju Krem, Niles McMaster, Dan Fauci, Alan Dellay, and Ernie Pysher. Shot under the title Sardu: Master of the Screaming Virgins, it was retitled The Incredible Torture Show during its original theatrical run.\n\nFilm distributor Troma Entertainment retitled the film \"Blood Sucking Freaks\" (sometimes spelled \"Bloodsucking Freaks\") upon their acquisition of it.\n\nMaster Sardu (Seamus O'Brien) runs a Grand Guignol-style theatre with his assistant, the little person Ralphus. They present grotesque sadomasochism shows depicting torture and murder. Unbeknownst to audiences and critics, the events depicted are real, not staged; the tortured participants are kidnapped victims forced into sexual slavery.\n\nTheatre critic Creasy Silo incurs Sardu's wrath by mocking his pretensions of art. Sardu responds by kidnapping and torturing Silo, hoping he will give the show a positive review, and by kidnapping ballerina Natasha DeNatalie to force her to participate in shows and lend them some artistic legitimacy. Natasha's football-player boyfriend Tom Maverick and corrupt policeman Detective John Tucci try to find Natasha and unravel the mystery of Sardu's operation. Sardu ultimately gets his comeuppance at the hands of his former captives.\n\n\n\"Blood Sucking Freaks\" would go on to achieve minor cult-classic status due to its ability to slip between being a serious horror film with sexual overtones and a campy send-up of gore films. The violent deaths of lead actors Seamus O'Brien (stabbed to death in his apartment by a burglar) and Viju Krem (shot on a hunting trip) after the film's release also contributed to the film's notoriety.\n\nSome of the torture methods depicted fictionally in the film include the use of thumb screws, a skull crushed by a vise, amputation at the wrist by a bone saw, the amputation of fingers by a meat cleaver, electro-shock, suspension, the extraction of teeth, the portrayal of an electric drill through a skull with the brains sucked through a straw, the amputation of feet by a chainsaw, stretching on St. Andrew's Cross, caning and subsequent decapitation by guillotine, as well as brainwashing, whipping, darts, and quartering.\n\nCritical reception for the film has been negative.\n\n\"TV Guide\" panned the film, awarding it 0/4 stars calling the plot \"flimsy\" and \"[an] exercise in total gross-out\".\nRob Wrigley from \"Classic Horror.com\" stated in his review on the film, \"If anything makes it tolerable, it is that it is presented as comedy rather than tragedy. Unfortunately, it falls flat far more than it amuses. One could complain about the misogyny of it all. Or its willingness to offend everyone possible. Or even the vibrant, sardonic performances of the principals. But that is giving the film more credit than it deserves\". Wrigley also criticized the film's acting.\n\nScott Weinberg from \"eFilmCritic.com\" panned the film stating in his review, \"When people use the term 'bottom of the barrel', they often forget about the UNDERSIDE of the barrel, which is where poorly-made dreck like this belongs. It offers absolutely NOTHING in the way of entertainment, and I think you're a cruel little nutcase if you talk someone else into seeing it,\" also calling it \"The nastiest, filthiest and just about WORST thing you will EVER SEE\".\n\nThe \"Encyclopedia of Horror\" says \"the film is deliberately tacky and tongue-in-cheek (but distasteful enough nonetheless), in the spirit of Herschell Gordon Lewis.\" The book reports the film was the subject of a campaign by Women Against Pornography.\n\nIt is considered to be one of the most controversial films of all time by Filmsite.org.\nIt currently has a 29% \"Rotten\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 7 reviews, with an average score of 3.88/10.\n\nJoe Bob Briggs opened his second season of The Last Drive-In on Shudder with Chopping Mall and \"Blood Sucking Freaks\".\n\n"}

It is an oscillatory idle rhythm of synchronized electric brain activity. It appears in spindles in recordings of EEG, MEG, and ECoG over the sensorimotor cortex. For most individuals, the frequency of the SMR is in the range of 13 to 15 Hz.\n\nThe meaning of SMR is not fully understood. Phenomenologically, a person is producing a stronger SMR amplitude when the corresponding sensorimotor areas are idle, e.g. during states of immobility. SMR typically decreases in amplitude when the corresponding sensory or motor areas are activated, e.g. during motor tasks and even during motor imagery.\n\nConceptually, SMR is sometimes mixed up with alpha waves of occipital origin, the strongest source of neural signals in the EEG. One reason might be, that without appropriate spatial filtering the SMR is very difficult to detect because it is usually flooded by the stronger occipital alpha waves. The feline SMR has been noted as being analogous to the human mu rhythm.\n\nNeurofeedback training can be used to gain control over the SMR activity. Neurofeedback practitioners believe that this feedback enables the subject to learn the regulation of their own SMR.\nPeople with learning difficulties, ADHD, epilepsy, and autism may benefit from an increase in SMR activity via neurofeedback.\nFurthermore, in the sport domain, SMR neurofeedback training has been found to be useful to enhance the golf putting performance. In the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), the deliberate modification of the SMR amplitude during motor imagery can be used to control external applications.\n\n\n"}

Besides a hotel and stagecoach stop, it has also been used as a post office, church, restaurant and military school. It is California Historical Landmark no. 659 and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It played a major role in the development of the stage line transportation network in California. The hotel was also the first business venture in the Conejo Valley.\n\nToday, the inn is owned by the Conejo Recreation and Park Department and operated as a historic museum. The museum includes a replica of Timber School (originally built in 1889), a carriage house and blacksmith shop, nature trail, and the 'Tri-Village', a small group of three houses: the pioneer house, the adobe, and the Chumash 'ap. There is also a gift shop located inside the museum. Volunteers operate the museum, although it is run by the Conejo Valley Historical Society. There is also a Jr. Docent program for children and teenagers aged 8–18. It is a dominant cultural- and educational gathering place for thousands of residents and visitors to Newbury Park.\n\nThe Stagecoach Inn is allegedly haunted, and is considered one of California's most famous haunted places.\n\nThe Stagecoach Inn is open Wednesday through Sunday, from 1-4 pm., in Newbury Park, CA.\n\nThe Stagecoach Inn has had a variety of names and owners:\n\n\nJames Hammell was a carpenter in Santa Barbara who planned to construct a hotel along the stagecoach route from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara. After talking to John Edwards about his plans in the late 19th century, Hammell purchased 900 acres of land from Edwards. Near what is now Highway 101 and Ventu Park Road is where Hammell first began constructing the hotel. El Grande Hotel (Grand Union Hotel) was constructed in 1876 and was originally planned as a stopover for travelers between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. It was constructed using redwood from Northern California. When it arrived in Port Hueneme, it was freighted up the Conejo Grade when brought to Stagecoach Inn.\nIt was originally constructed in 1876 near what is now the Ventura Freeway and Ventu Park Road. Its redwood lumber came by sea and was freighted up the steep Conejo Grade (between Newbury Park and Camarillo) by multiteam wagons. One month before the hotel's grand opening, the Coast Line Stage Company changed its routes from Conejo Valley to Santa Clara Valley, which meant an end to Hammell's prospects of a mainline stage stop. Hammell did not cancel his plans, but instead opened the hotel on July 4, 1876, and publicized it as a \"health- and pleasure resort\". A countywide newspaper reported: \"Shooting, fishing, bathing, and a first-rate table are among the good things on hand for visitors.\"\n\nFollowing the drought of 1877-78 James Hammell no longer owned the hotel. After passing through several owners, it was purchased in 1885 by Cecil Haigh, an Englishman. H. Allen Hays, grandson of Cecil Haigh, gave the building and about four acres of land at the present location to the CVHS, who later deeded the property to the Conejo Recreation and Park District in return for a 50-year renewable lease to operate the facilities for cultural and educational purposes. In the 1960s, the hotel was threatened with demolition by the expansion of the Ventura Freeway, but it was granted Historical Landmark status and moved to its present location in 1965. On April 25, 1970, a fire entirely destroyed the museum and its contents. Although the reconstructed museum was dedicated and opened on July 4, 1976, the second floor was not completed until 1980. The structure was rebuilt using the original Monterey style architecture.\n\nIt was designated Ventura County Historic Landmark No. 30 in 1965, and designated California Historical Landmark No. 659 and placed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1976. It is City of Thousand Oaks Historical Landmark No. 1.\n\nAlso on the museum grounds is the Timber School, a replica of the 1889 school. On July 13, 2004, the Thousand Oaks City Council voted unanimously to declare the Timber School on Newbury Road City Landmark No. 12.\n\nOn the museum grounds, near the Tri-Village Complex, is a historic 250+ year old sycamore tree. The tree was designated Ventura County Landmark No. 44 on May 1, 1978, due to its \"great age, size, and formation.\" The tree is also designated Thousand Oaks City Landmark No. 2. The tree has served as a polling place, resting place, post office, and outdoor chapel. Furthermore, General John C. Frémont passed by this tree in 1846 on his way to sign a treaty with General Andrés Pico to secure California's annexation to the U.S. The Chumash Indians are said to have bent the lower branches to mark the location of underground water.\n\nThe hotel is home to permanent exhibits such as the Carriage House and Blacksmith Shop, Anderson Exhibit Hall, Tri-Village and The Timber School. It is home to the Tri-Village which represents three historic eras in the Conejo Valley: the Newbury Pioneer House, a Spanish Adobe, and a reconstructed Chumash village. The exhibits are changing routinely. Temporary exhibits as of July 2018 include an exhibit dedicated to Jungleland USA, an exhibit of vintage dresses, and mammoth bones through the exhibit \"Fossils of the Conejo Valley.\"\n\nMinerals, shells and fossils have been on display here. Chumash pictographs have also been on display here. The 4-acre surrounding park contains a collection of carriages, stagecoaches and wagons.\n\n\nThe premises are also home to a botanical garden, The Heritage Rose Garden, which contains over 35 species of heirloom roses dating from 1752. A memorial brick path winds through the gardens.\n\nStagecoach Inn Park sits adjacent to the Stagecoach Inn, located at the corner of Lynn- and Ventu Park Roads. The 4.9 acre park was acquired by the Conejo Recreation & Park District in 1968, and later developed into a neighborhood park in 1985. A creek runs through the park on one edge, and the premises houses a 425-year old Sycamore tree. The park has a playground, public restrooms, picnic tables, barbecue grills, and an outdoor basketball court.\n\nThe Rosewood Trail to the 1,603 ft. peak Angel Vista in the Santa Monica Mountains can be reached from the park. Hikers may park at the park and access the Rosewood Trail from its trailhead immediately across Lynn Road from the Stagecoach Inn Park.\n\nThe Conejo Valley Historical Society was established on October 9, 1964, as an effort to save the Stagecoach Inn from potential demolition due to expansion of the Ventura Freeway. Its members were able to save the structure and was also successful in having it declared California State Landmark No. 659. Allen Hays, the grandson of Cecil and Cicelie Haigh, donated the Stagecoach Inn and four adjacent acres of land to the Conejo Valley Historical Society. The society deeded the site to the Conejo Recreation and Park District (CRPD) in return for a renewable lease to operate and manage stagecoach for cultural- and educational purposes. The society helped prepare it as a museum after the 1965 move, and the society made immediate plans for rebuilding the structure after the April 1970 fire.\n\nThe Conejo Valley Historical Society frequently hold meetings and events at the Stagecoach Inn.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the Archbishop of Atlanta, from 2005 to 2019, the Bishop of Belleville, Illinois, from 1994 to 2004, and Auxiliary Bishop of Chicago from 1983 to 1994. He was president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) from 2001 to 2004.\n\nWilton Gregory was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Wilton and Ethel (\"née\" Duncan) Gregory. One of three children, he has two sisters: Elaine and Claudia. Gregory's parents divorced when he was quite young, and his grandmother, Etta Mae Duncan, subsequently moved in with the family at their home on the South Side. In 1958, he was enrolled at St. Carthage Grammar School, where he decided to become a priest before even converting to Catholicism. He was baptized and received his First Communion in 1959, and was confirmed by Bishop Raymond P. Hillinger later that year.\n\nGregory graduated from St. Carthage in 1961, and then attended Quigley Preparatory Seminary South and Niles College in Chicago, and St. Mary of the Lake Seminary in Mundelein. After ordination, he completed a doctorate in liturgy (SLD) at the Pontifical Liturgical Institute at the Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm in Rome.\n\nAt the age of 25, he was ordained to the priesthood by John Cardinal Cody on May 9, 1973. He engaged in advanced studies at the Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm in Rome and earned the Doctor of Sacred Liturgy degree.\n\nGregory performed pastoral work in Glenview at Our Lady of Perpetual Help and at Mary, Seat of Wisdom Parish in Park Ridge, Illinois. He also taught at Saint Mary of the Lake Seminary and served as a Master of Ceremonies under Cardinals Cody and Bernardin.\n\nOn October 31, 1983, he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Chicago and Titular Bishop of Oliva. Gregory received his episcopal consecration on the following December 13 from Cardinal Bernardin, with Bishops Alfred Abramowicz and Nevin Hayes, O.Carm., serving as co-consecrators.\n\nGregory remained in Chicago until December 29, 1993, when he was appointed the seventh Bishop of Belleville; he was installed on February 10, 1994.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2004, Gregory served as the President of the USCCB, the first African-American to head an episcopal conference, as Vice President from 1998 to 2001 and also Chairman of several committees. During his presidency, the American bishops issued the \"Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People\" in response to Roman Catholic sex abuse cases. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees at The Catholic University of America. In 2002, in recognition of his handling of the sex abuse scandal with repeated apologies and the defrocking of priests, he was chosen as \"Time's\" Person of the Week.\n\nPope John Paul II, in one of his last episcopal appointments before his death, named Bishop Gregory the seventh Archbishop of Atlanta on December 9, 2004. His installation took place on January 17, 2005.\n\nGregory has been active in the Roman Catholic Church in advocating for the prevention of child sexual abuse by Roman Catholic religious, and for implementing policies to protect the faithful from sexual abuse by Roman Catholic religious. He has been one of the leading bishops in the United States regarding this endeavor.\n\nGregory wrote a bi-weekly column for the Roman Catholic newspaper of the Archdiocese of Atlanta, \"The Georgia Bulletin\" titled \"What I have seen and heard\". In it, he regularly shared reflections about his faith, work, and experiences.\n\nGregory was complimentary of Pope Francis's 2016 apostolic exhortation \"Amoris laetitia\". At a 2017 conference at Boston College, he described it as \"a document that recognizes the real and serious problems and challenges facing families today, but at the same time it is a proclamation of hope through the mercy and grace of God.\" Gregory spoke of Pope Francis as someone who \"challenges the church and its pastors to move beyond thinking that everything is black and white, so that we sometimes close off the way of grace and growth.\"\nIn 2018, a group of Catholics started a petition urging Gregory to remove \"pro-LGBT\" Monsignor Henry Gracz of the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Atlanta from his position as a spiritual advisor to victims of sexual abuse for allegedly going against Church teaching. Gregory refused, saying that \"there are [were] no plans\" to remove Gracz from his advisory role. He added, \"Msgr. Gracz is following the admonition of Pope Francis to accompany people on the periphery of society. His priestly heart is not closed to those who find themselves misunderstood or rejected.\"\n\nOn April 4, 2019, Pope Francis named Gregory Archbishop of Washington. He was installed on May 21, 2019.\n\nIn an interview on August 1, 2019, Gregory criticized rhetoric from President Donald Trump. \"I fear that recent public comments by our president and others and the responses they have generated, have deepened divisions and diminished our national life,\" he said. He added, \"The growing plague of offense and disrespect in speech and actions must end.\"\n\nWhen asked by a transgender person about whether there was a place for him in the Church, Gregory responded by saying, \"You belong to the heart of this Church. And there is nothing that you may do, may say, that will ever rip you from the heart of this Church. There is a lot that has been said to you, about you, behind your back, that is painful and is sinful.\"\n\nIn 2014, Gregory was widely criticized after the Archdiocese used $2.2 million from a bequest to build a new archbishop's residence on property donated to the church that would also serve as a banquet and conference facility. On March 13, Gregory apologized to members of the Atlanta archdiocese:\nIn April 2014, Gregory announced he was planning to sell the house, though he had moved into it only three months earlier.\n\nIn 2014, Gregory announced his opposition to the passage of House Bill (H.B.) 60, the Safe Carry Protection Act, also known as the \"Guns Everywhere\" Law. Gregory stated that guns will not be allowed in Roman Catholic churches in Georgia, but for those military and civil service personnel who are required to have them. He stated that carrying guns in churches places vulnerable individuals, such as children, those who are disabled, and the elderly, at risk. Gregory is further against the new law because it is against Jesus' teachings of peace.\n\nGregory wrote:\nThe Safe Carry Protection Act took effect on July 1, 2014. It permits licensed gun owners to carry guns into many public and private places, including churches, school property, bars, nightclubs, libraries, and some government buildings in Georgia. The law was supported by the Georgia Baptist Convention which includes 3,600 Baptist churches in Georgia, but is not supported by Catholic or Episcopalian church leaders.\n\nGregory has been awarded Honorary Doctorates of Humane Letters from Spring Hill College in Mobile, Xavier University in Cincinnati, and McKendree University; Honorary Doctorates in Humanities from Lewis University and Saint Louis University; and an Honorary Doctorate in Theology from Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. Gregory was also awarded an honorary degree from Boston College in 2018.\n\n"}

Finally today's seat was recreated mostly from the north of the South Northants seat in 1974. Since its recreation and during its first existence it has been served by Conservative MPs.

Collective punishment, even including measures that actually further harm the prospect of achieving targets, is applied as a measure to 'teach' the workforce.\n\nThe concept of collective responsibility is present in literature, most notably in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", a poem telling the tale of a ship's crew who died of thirst after they approved of one crew member's killing of an albatross.\n\n1959's \"Ben-Hur\" and 1983's prison crime drama \"Bad Boys\" depict collective responsibility and punishment.\nThe play 'An Inspector Calls' by J.B Priestley also features the theme of collective responsibility throughout the investigation process.\n\nIn some countries with parliamentary systems, there is a convention that all members of a cabinet must publicly support all government decisions, even if they do not agree with them. Members of the cabinet that wish to dissent or object publicly must resign from their position or be sacked.\n\nAs a result of collective responsibility, the entire government cabinet must resign if a vote of no confidence is passed in parliament.\n\nThis concept is found in the Old Testament (or Tanakh), some examples include the account of the Flood, the Tower of Babel, Sodom and Gomorrah and in some interpretations, the Book of Joshua's Achan. In those records entire communities were punished for the acts of the vast majority of their members, however it is impossible to state that there were no innocent people, or children too young to be responsible for their deeds, on whom it was inflicted as well.\n\nThe practice of blaming the Jews for Jesus' death is the longest example of collective responsibility. In this case, the blame was cast not only on the Jews of the time but upon successive generations. This comes from Matthew 27:25-66 New International Version (NIV) 25: \"All the people answered, 'His blood is on us and on our children!'\"\n\nCollective responsibility in the form of collective punishment is often used as a disciplinary measure in closed institutions, e.g. boarding schools (punishing a whole class for the actions of one known or unknown pupil), military units, prisons (juvenile and adult), psychiatric facilities, etc. The effectiveness and severity of this measure may vary greatly, but it often breeds distrust and isolation among their members. Historically, collective punishment is a sign of authoritarian tendencies in the institution or its home society. For example, in the Soviet Gulags, all members of a \"brigada\" (work unit) were punished for bad performance of any of its members.\n\nCollective punishment is also practiced in the situation of war, economic sanctions, etc., presupposing the existence of collective guilt. Collective guilt, or guilt by association, is the controversial collectivist idea that individuals who are identified as a member of a certain group carry the responsibility for an act or behavior that members of that group have demonstrated, even if they themselves were not involved. Contemporary systems of criminal law accept the principle that guilt shall only be personal. Others view groups as being entities in themselves (an entitative group), capable of holding guilt or responsibility independent of any of the group's members.\n\nTerror groups of all kinds bomb civilians who are seen as collectively responsible for the acts of their leaders. The state level bombing of civilians became popular in the Twentieth Century although ancient warriors would often slaughter whole cities if they resisted demands for capitulation or tribute.\n\nDuring the occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany, the Germans applied collective responsibility: any kind of help given to a person of Jewish faith or origin was punishable by death, and that not only for the rescuer but also for his/her family. This was widely publicized by the Germans. During the occupation, for every German killed by a Pole, 100-400 Poles were shot in retribution. Communities were held collectively responsible for the purported Polish counter-attacks against the invading German troops. Mass executions of \"łapanka\" hostages were conducted every single day during the Wehrmacht advance across Poland in September 1939 and thereafter.\n\nAnother example is when after the war, ethnic Germans in Central and Eastern Europe were held collectively responsible for Nazi crimes, resulting in numerous atrocities against the German population, including killings (see Expulsion of Germans after World War II and Beneš decrees).\n\nIn ethics, both methodological individualists and normative individualists question the validity of collective responsibility.\n\"Methodological individualists challenge the very possibility of associating moral agency with groups, as distinct from their individual members, and normative individualists argue that collective responsibility violates principles of both individual responsibility and fairness\". (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) \n\nNormally, only the individual actor can accrue culpability for actions that they freely cause. The notion of collective culpability seems to deny individual moral responsibility. Does collective responsibility make sense? History is filled with examples of a wronged man who tried to avenge himself, not only on the person who has wronged him, but on other members of the wrongdoer's family, tribe, ethnic group, religion, or nation.\n\n"}

In fuzzy logic, it represents the degree of truth as an extension of valuation. Degrees of truth are often confused with probabilities, although they are conceptually distinct, because fuzzy truth represents membership in vaguely defined sets, not likelihood of some event or condition. Membership functions were introduced by Zadeh in the first paper on fuzzy sets (1965). Zadeh, in his theory of fuzzy sets, proposed using a membership function (with a range covering the interval (0,1)) operating on the domain of all possible values.\n\nFor any set formula_1, a membership function on formula_1 is any function from formula_1 to the real unit interval formula_4.\n\nMembership functions represent fuzzy subsets of formula_1. The membership function which represents a fuzzy set formula_6 is usually denoted by formula_7 For an element formula_8 of formula_1, the value formula_10 is called the \"membership degree\" of formula_8 in the fuzzy set formula_12 The membership degree formula_13 quantifies the grade of membership of the element formula_8 to the fuzzy set formula_12 The value 0 means that formula_8 is not a member of the fuzzy set; the value 1 means that formula_8 is fully a member of the fuzzy set. The values between 0 and 1 characterize fuzzy members, which belong to the fuzzy set only partially.\nMembership function of a fuzzy set\n\nSometimes, a more general definition is used, where membership functions take values in an arbitrary fixed algebra or structure formula_18 ; usually it is required that formula_18 be at least a poset or lattice. The usual membership functions with values in [0, 1] are then called [0, 1]-valued membership functions.\n\n\"See the article on Capacity of a set for a closely related definition in mathematics.\"\n\nOne application of membership functions is as capacities in decision theory.\n\nIn decision theory, a capacity is defined as a function, formula_20 from S, the set of subsets of some set, into formula_4, such that formula_20 is set-wise monotone and is normalized (i.e. formula_23 This is a generalization of the notion of a probability measure, where the probability axiom of countable additivity is weakened. A capacity is used as a subjective measure of the likelihood of an event, and the \"expected value\" of an outcome given a certain capacity can be found by taking the Choquet integral over the capacity.\n\n\n\n"}

At 0830AM to 0845AM local time (0230-0245 UTC), the bus was traveling through Yagalmodere, Polgahawela, 80 km north-east of Colombo. The bus proceeded through the signals and barriers of a level crossing without stopping, and was struck by an intercity express train from Colombo to Kandy. H. A. Sirisena, the train's driver, was quoted as saying: \"The signal was green and the level-crossing gates were closed, then I saw the bus trying to cross and the next thing I know, the engine was hitting the rear of the bus.\" It was thought that the bus was participating in a race with another local private bus, with the intention of gathering more and more passengers from the next main town. The bus driver, A. W. Haprool Azad, did not see the train in his haste. The driver, who survived with only a broken ankle, initially refused to speak about the accident to investigators.\n\nThe bus was destroyed and the wreckage caught fire, killing many of the injured people strewn on the tracks in front of the train, which managed to stop shortly after striking the bus. It was thought that more than 35 people were killed in the disaster. All survivors from the bus sustained injuries. None of the train's passengers or crew were injured in the accident.\n\nThe barriers on the crossing only covered the lane for oncoming traffic, allowing the bus to drive through on the wrong side of the road with visibility obscured further due to vegetation in area. The Sri Lankan government promised to prevent races by private bus companies, who competed for customers by advertising fast journeys, often violating traffic laws to do so. It also promised to prosecute irresponsible road users.\n\nIn April 2013, the bus driver, as well as bus conductor M.G. Buddhika Ruwan Kumara, were sentenced to death by Kurunagala High Court, the first death sentences handed down in Sri Lanka for a road traffic offense.\n\n\n"}

Though the tour and the organization were officially non-partisan, many of the performers urged people to vote against then President George W.

Bush would defeat Kerry in November 2004.\n\nEvery region had a specific night during which the concerts would be held in that region. When concerts were held in the same city, they were at different venues.\n\nThe tour was generally successful in attracting audiences, generating media attention and raising approximately $10 million for America Coming Together.\n\nIn terms of the tour's effect on the 2004 election, none of the visited states went differently from what had been predicted in pre-election polls. Four of the eight ended up voting in favor of Kerry (Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) while the other four went to Bush (Missouri, Iowa, Florida, and Ohio). The states that had the heaviest tour presence (five or six shows) also split evenly. The result in Ohio was the most critical, as it decided the election in Bush's favor (despite six shows there).\n\nThe Springsteen and E Street Band performances were compressed to two hours in length due to the multi-act nature of the concerts.

The Steps are also famous for appearing in the \"Scott Pilgrim\" graphic novels and its film adaptation, \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\".\n\nThe Steps are located on the shore cliff of the ancient Lake Iroquois on a public right-of-way connecting two sections of Spadina Road. The sheerness of the cliff prevented the construction of Spadina Road directly down the escarpment. Instead a roadway crossing of the escarpment was cut a few hundred yards to the west. A set of wooden steps were installed to allow people to move through the area. The original wooden stairs were replaced with a permanent structure in 1913 along the Spadina Road Alignment. Along the top of the cliff some of Toronto's most exclusive homes were constructed including Casa Loma and Spadina House.\n\nIn the 1960s the proposed Spadina Expressway would have replaced the stairs site with a six-lane highway exiting from a tunnel to the north. The Expressway project was cancelled in 1971 by the Ontario government. As part of the project, the land of the stairs became the property of the Government of Ontario. In 1984, the land was leased to the City of Toronto government for 99 years. In 1987, the City rebuilt the Steps site with new railings, concrete stairs and expanded landings, following the original zig-zag path up the cliff.

It is located in Manhattan's Financial District on the corner of Wall Street and Broadway. At 654 feet (199 m) tall, it is the 88th tallest building in New York City. \n\nConstruction on the present building began in 1929 and was completed in 1931, to the designs of the architectural firm of Voorhees, Gmelin and Walker. Until 2015, it served as the global headquarters of The Bank of New York Mellon. In 2001, One Wall Street was designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.\n\nDesigned by Ralph Walker, the building was originally built for the Irving Trust Company. It is an Art Deco architectural style, with a steel skeleton whose facade is covered in limestone. Because of the curves in the wall, the bank does not completely occupy its full building lot. By municipal law, unoccupied and unmarked land would revert to the public, which is the reason for a number of small markers embedded in the sidewalk asserting the limits of the building's lot. It counts fifty stories (originally planned for 46), stands 654 feet (199 meters) tall, and measures 1,165,659 rentable square feet.\n\nThe Wall Street entrance leads into a two-story banking hall whose ceiling is decorated with red and gold mosaics designed by Hildreth Meiere, comparable to the mosaics in the Golden Hall of Stockholm City Hall, and manufactured by the same company, the Ravenna Mosaic Company in Berlin.\n\nIn 2001, 1 Wall Street was designated as a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.\n\nThe previous high-rise on this corner, also called One Wall Street, was erected in 1907 as a slender 18-story office building. The investors, a syndicate from St. Louis, headed by Festus Wade of the St Louis Mercantile Trust Company, paid $700,000 for the property, before construction costs. The architects were Barnett, Haynes & Barnett of St. Louis. Known as the \"Chimney Building\" or \"Chimney Corner\", it was acquired and razed as part of Irving Trust's real estate consolidation around 1929. Irving Trust was then known as American Exchange Irving Trust, and it bought the original corner property along with a number of adjacent lots on either side, to create a 180 foot frontage along Broadway, and the entire block along Wall Street. The \"chimney\" property was at that time the costliest transaction per square foot recorded in the city, at $1.05 million.\n\nConstruction on the present building began in 1929 and was completed in 1931, to the designs of the architectural firm of Voorhees, Gmelin and Walker.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1965, a 36-floor addition to the site was constructed to the south of the tower to provide extra office space. This site had been occupied by the eighteen-story Manhattan Life Insurance Building (1894), which was the title-holder as the tallest building in the world from 1894 until 1899, and the twenty-two story Knickerbocker Trust Company Building (1909). Among other alterations was the chiseling out of \"Irving Trust\" name from the cornerstone and replacement with \"Bank of New York.\" The last owner of the Chimney Building, the Central Union Trust Company, had also owned the Manhattan Life building, and had moved there in 1929 upon the sale to Irving.\nThe building has had numerous problems with the limestone exterior, and in 2001, the building's owners decided to bring in Hoffmann Architects to conduct a survey of the exterior and provide a five-year masterplan consisting of mortar repair and window replacements.\n\nIn May 2014, the long-term tenant, the Bank of New York Mellon, sold the building to a joint venture led by Harry B. Macklowe's Macklowe Properties for $585 million. Macklowe Properties partnered with former Prime Minister of Qatar Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani in a bid to convert the office property into 566 condos with retail at the base. In November 2018, Deutsche Bank provided $750 million in debt for the conversion.\n\nIn January 2019, Life Time Fitness signed a lease to open a gym on the first four floors of the building, slated to open in 2020. Other retail in the building includes a Whole Foods Market, also scheduled to open in 2020.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1808729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808729", "title": "Frank Penhalluriack", "text": "Frank Penhalluriack\n\nFrancis Penhalluriack is an Australian businessman, entrepreneur and local political figure. He is most notable for opening his Caulfield, Victoria, hardware store outside of legislated trading hours in the 1980s. \nHis actions eventually led to a dramatic change in retail trading laws in Victoria, Australia.\n\nPenhalluriack initially studied at Hampton High School. After some of Hampton High School was destroyed by fire in 1957, he continued his studies at Melbourne High School. \nHe subsequently graduated with a bachelor's degree in building from Melbourne University in 1962.\n\nPenhalluriack stood unsuccessfully as an Australia Party candidate for the federal seat of Chisholm, in 1974.\n\nIn the state of Victoria in the 1980s, the Local Government Act limited most retailers to trading during certain hours on Saturdays, and not at all on Sundays. Certain types of retailers were exempt from these restrictions, such as milk bars and service stations. Penhalluriack consistently ignored these laws, opening his hardware store outside of the legislated times. Melbourne talkback radio host and social commentator Derryn Hinch quipped at the time, \"\"You can get a screw on Sunday but you can't get a screwdriver.\"\", in reference to the fact that the Victorian government was legalising prostitution at the same time they were enforcing the weekend trading laws with particular attention to hardware stores.\n\nPenhalluriack said retailing was a service industry, and his obligation was to provide that service when his customers’ demand was highest. \"If it is a crime\", he said, \"it is a victimless crime with heinous penalties out of all proportion\". The Australian Broadcasting Commission has put together some newscasts from that time.\n\nOfficers from the department of Labour and Industry repeatedly fined Penhalluriack for his breaches of the law, and the whole issue gained considerable local media attention. When he refused to pay he volunteered himself to spend time in jail, and was arrested by the Caulfield Police, who transferred him to the Glenferrie Road Malvern cell behind the Police Station. The next day he was transferred to Pentridge, where he was classified as a nuisance, and returned to his freedom. He was re-arrested at his shop the following Sunday, and spent a further 19 days incarceration. in HM Prison Pentridge\nThis was bad publicity for the State Government, who changed the law to give priority to the seizure of goods. When Penhalluriack refused to pay further fines the courts compelled the police to auction his stock to raise funds to pay the fine; the auction was a farce, with grateful shoppers paying many times the market price for the goods auctioned.\n\nThe conflict continued, and a frustrated Magistrate refused Penhalluriack's request for an adjournment, and fined him $501,000 for his failure to close his business on 21 occasions. This was a political disaster for the government, and the DPP offered to lodge an appeal on his behalf – but not against the conviction, only against the quantum. Since Penhalluriack had no intention to pay any fine he rejected their offer. The DPP had one month to serve the appeal notice on him personally, so he went to ground, Penhalluriack has always been supportive of his staff. He calls them ‘a wonderfully loyal and hard-working bunch’, and they continued to open 7-days-a –week while he was in jail or in hiding.\n\nWith the DPP's appeal safely behind him, and the government incensed at his temerity, the summons came at a rate of two every Saturday, and two more every Sunday. After a few months he had enough to stick them inside his front shop window, spelling out \"$500k\".\n\nAfter almost twelve months Penhalluriack lodged his own appeal. It was out of time, but accepted by the Industrial Court of Victoria, The President was the only person to hear such appeals, and on day three he was seen sharing a tea break with some of the Department's Inspectors – who were witnesses in the case. The President refused to step down, and subsequently became quite ill. After he recovered he recommenced the case, and immediately declared a conflict of interest over the \"tea party\". By this time the government had once again amended the law, this time to permit the Deputy presidents to hear the matter. \nThe final ruling was in Penhalluriack's favour, and the fine was quashed.\n\nHis attempt to serve a subpoena on then premier John Cain at a public appearance led to a scuffle with a yelling crowd of about 30 Right to Life demonstrators.\n\nHe also served the Premier with a birthday cake, walking into a press conference with his friend and hardware storekeeper Bob Wolstenholme. The Premier was speechless. How many shopkeepers have ever achieved that? asked Bob to the media who had chosen to abandon the Premier in favour of interviewing the two rebels.\n\nIn response to public pressure, the government changed retail trading laws in Victoria, Australia to permit weekend trading.\nAfter the introduction of Sunday trading, Penhalluriack's media profile dropped dramatically.\nPenhalluriack has an ongoing involvement in his local community, including as a Director of the Caulfield Park Bendigo Bank.\n\nPenhalluriack continued to flout trading laws, opening his hardware store on Easter Sunday in 2005, under threat of a $10,000 fine.\nPenhalluriack has been quoted as follows:\n\nPenhalluriack was elected to his local council on 29 November 2008, representing the Camden Ward of the Glen Eira City Council.\nHis policy was to improve the efficiency and business outlook of the Council, and to open up the Caulfield Racecourse Reserve to the public. The Reserve is 143 acres (65 Ha) of Crown Land set aside in the nineteenth century for \"a racecourse public park and public recreation ground\". Only 21 race-meetings are held each year, and it plays second fiddle to Flemington, Melbourne's premier racecourse.\nCouncil supported Penhalluriack's lead in this matter, and voted for sporting grounds and improved access to the centre of the track, the removal of training and stables which house 600 horses, and the removal of all opaque fencing (Council minutes 22 February 2011). The result is a tiny, inaccessible playground, some BBQ's and a jogging track. \nMost of Penhalluriack's ideas were stillborn or quickly thwarted. For example, against continual criticism from council officers, he sought to demonstrate that Council's mulch storage was a potential source of Legionnaires' disease, and that deaths had been caused by similar establishments. \"I would be ashamed to put up for sale the rubbish that is in the Council's bin,\" he said, \"where the material at the back has remained undisturbed for over twelve months. Its conditions are ideal for bacterial growth – a source of moisture, warmth and food.\"\n\nAs a result of this campaign, he was accused of furthering his own business because he sold mulch in his garden centre. Penhalluriack vigorously denied any conflict of interest, pointing out that the mulch he sold was a negligible percentage of his total sales (0.02%) and that his mulch was quite different, being packages and pasteurised and in compliance with the Australian Standard.\n\nHaving overcome any objections from his colleagues, Penhalluriack thought the matter was settled until the Ombudsman was asked to investigate. The Ombudsman's report found that Penhalluriack may have had a conflict of interest and recommended that these matters should be referred to a Councillor Conduct Panel and to VCAT by the Secretary of the Department of Planning and Community alleging misconduct and gross misconduct. The tabling in Parliament of the Ombudsman's Report did considerable harm to Penhalluriack's reputation, and contributed to the loss of his seat at the 2012 council election.\n\nOn 28 March 2012 Ombudsman tabled his report in the Victorian Parliament. In it the Ombudsman accused Penhalluriack of misconduct, bullying and conflict of interest. The conflict of interest was that he interfered with the council's free mulch program, while his hardware store sold mulch. The report characterised the campaign as deliberate disruption using unsubstantiated health concerns, and noted Penhalluriack's lack of acknowledgement of \"various conflicts of interest between his council role and his personal/business interests\".\n\nThe Ombudsman's recommendations included that the Victorian government consider additional mechanisms to assist councils dealing with \"difficult councillors\", including the creation of an Integrity Commissioner, which would be a significant development in governance in Victoria.\n\nPenhalluriack refused to attend an informal hearing into allegations that he bullied the CEO, describing the proceedings as a \"kangaroo court\". Penhalluriack was referred to a Councillor Conduct Panel in November 2011. Penhalluriack made an application to have the matter referred to the Victorian Civil and Administration Tribunal (VCAT), where Penhalluriack would be entitled to hear evidence under oath, and cross-examine his accusers; the application was accepted and the issue was referred. The VCAT hearing was adjourned after three days due to a conflict of interest by one of the VCAT members, and subsequently lapsed when Penhalluriak was not re-elected.\n\nPenhalluriack made various counter-claims against the council, including a workplace insurance claim and stress levels causing him cardiac problems.\n"}

{"id": "1808748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808748", "title": "Battle of Mars-la-Tour", "text": "Battle of Mars-la-Tour\n\nThe Battle of Mars-La-Tour (also known as the Battle of Vionville or Battle of Rezonville) was fought on 16 August 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, near the village of Mars-La-Tour in northeast France. One Prussian corps, reinforced by two more later in the day, encountered the entire French Army of the Rhine in a meeting engagement and, surprisingly, forced the Army of the Rhine to retreat into the fortress of Metz.\n\nA cavalry patrol of the 1st Squadron of the 1st Hanoverian Dragoon Regiment No. 9, led by Rittmeister Oskar von Blumenthal, discovered that Marshal François Bazaine's 160,000-man Army of the Rhine was attempting to escape from Metz to join with French forces at Verdun. This intelligence prompted General Prince Friedrich Karl, commander of the Prussian Second Army, to order at 1900 on 15 August a grossly outnumbered group of 30,000 men of the advanced III Corps under General Constantin von Alvensleben to cut off the French line of retreat at Mars-la-Tour and Vionville.\n\nAt 0900 on 16 August, they engaged the French army near Vionville, east of Mars-la-Tour. III Corps routed the French 2nd Army Corps and captured Vionville at 1130, blocking any further escape attempts to the west. From 1200 to 1600, Alvensleben defeated all attempts by four French corps to dislodge his III Corps. The arrival of X Corps under General Konstantin Bernhard von Voigts-Rhetz to the west and that of IX Corps under General Albrecht Gustav von Manstein to the east, solidified the German position after 1600.\n\nOn 16 August, the French could have swept away the key Prussian defense and escaped. Alvensleben attacked the French advance guard, believing that it was the rearguard of the retreating Army of the Rhine. Despite his misjudgment, Alvensleben held off four French corps for seven hours. The aggression and skill of the Prussians prevailed over Bazaine's gross indecision. Prevented from retreating, the French inside Metz had no choice but to fight the Battle of Gravelotte on 18 August.\n\nAfter the Battle of Spicheren on 6 August, the German High Command under \"Graf\" Helmuth von Moltke the Elder believed that the French Army of the Rhine would not fight on the eastern side of the Moselle. After 12 August, German cavalry reconnaissance made clear the French intention to fight after all. At 1800 on 14 August, Moltke ordered the Second Army under Prince Friedrich Karl to prepare to cross the Moselle and send all available cavalry to the area between Metz and Verdun to ascertain the French movements. On the morning of 15 August, King Wilhelm I, convinced by Quartermaster General Eugen Anton Theophil von Podbielski's argument that the French would not fight east of Metz, ordered the First Army under General Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz to move forward to the western side of Moselle as well.\nMeanwhile, Prince Friedrich Karl on 14 August ordered his III and XII Corps to cross the Moselle on 15 August and advance to the Seille, while his four other corps followed behind them. At 1100 15 August, Moltke sent a telegram to Friedrich Karl, informing him that the French were probably retreating without delay from Metz to Verdun. Friedrich Karl ordered III Corps under General Constantin von Alvensleben to cross the Moselle. The divisions of the corps marched off at 1700, the men not having had time to eat. The 5th Infantry Division crossed the bridge at Novéant, which the French had failed to blow up. The 6th Infantry Division erected a light pontoon bridge at Champey, sending its artillery and supply trains to cross at Pont-à-Mousson. The divisions reached their positions near midnight, sleeping only for a short while.\n\nThe French withdrawal to the west was ordered on 13 August, interrupted on 14 August by the Battle of Borny-Colombey and resumed on 15 August. Fighting between German and French cavalry went on all day on 15 August to the south-west of Metz, the Germans forcing the French to retreat back toward Metz. At 1830 on 15 August, Moltke ordered Second Army to cut off the French line of retreat along the Metz-Verdun roads and left to Friedrich Karl's judgement the best means to accomplish this task. Friedrich Karl had already made clear in an 1100 telegram to royal headquarters that reports from III Corps had convinced him that the French were retreating toward the Meuse with full speed and the Second Army would have to hurry to cut them off. At 1900 Friedrich Karl ordered III Corps to advance in force to Mars-la-Tour and Vionville. X Corps under General Konstantin Bernhard von Voigts-Rhetz and two cavalry divisions would assist III Corps in the offensive toward the Metz-Verdun roads.\n\nThe French were, in fact, not retreating at full speed; the cavalry actions with the Germans, the blocking of roads by supply trains and the spread-out dispositions of the French corps, convinced the Army of the Rhine's commander Marshal François Achille Bazaine to delay the retreat from 0400 until noon 16 August. The French staff officers were busy organizing the supply trains and road traffic, when the battle of Mars-la-Tour began at 0900 on 16 August. Moltke and the royal headquarters had wrongly assumed that a battle would not be fought until the Germans had reached the supposed French positions at the Meuse and directed the German armies to march toward the river without delay. The westward march of the German armies would leave the German troops at Mars-la-Tour initially outnumbered and without all possible support. The French were therefore the favorites to win the battle at Mars-la-Tour on 16 August and break out toward the Meuse. Only the lack of vigor and decisiveness on the part of the French high command prevented them from accomplishing it.\n\nIn the evening of 15 August, Voigts-Rhetz ordered the 5th Cavalry Division under General Paul von Rheinbaben to conduct a reconnaissance-in-force against the French positions near Rezonville. Around 0830 on 16 August, Murat's French dragoon brigade west of Vionville was busy cooking food in a camp and did not employ cavalry or infantry patrols, allowing Redern's hussar brigade to close in without difficulty. A German battery set up position on nearby height and fired on the surprised French. More German batteries followed and opened up with their guns, throwing the entire French brigade into savage disorder. The French cavalry promptly fled to the east, re-assembling on the Rezonville plateau. The German horse artillery moved forward, firing on Gramont's cuirassier brigade near Rezonville. By 0930, the German cavalry could not support their artillery, as French infantry had by now formed up and were advancing on Vionville, subjecting the Germans to their fire. The German horse artillery fired on the French infantry, receiving French counter-battery fire in turn.\n\nThe 6th Cavalry Division was ordered by Alvensleben at 0200 to cross the Moselle by 0530 and lead III Corps. This was only accomplished by 0700, after which the division was told by 5th Infantry Division of French cavalry positions near Rezonville. At 0900, another order arrived from Alvensleben, instructing 6th Cavalry Division to secure the Rezonville plateau. A cavalry brigade under Lieutenant Colonel Rauch that was advancing on the heights, was fired upon from the Bois de Vionville and was forced to retreat after heavy losses. Grüter's brigade had more success around 0915, its cavalry sending French skirmishers fleeing, while its artillery raked French infantry camps near the Bois de St. Arnould.\n\nThe French responded with great force. Marshal François Certain Canrobert's 6th Army Corps sent two divisions to Vionville and Flavigny. General Charles Auguste Frossard's 2nd Army Corps sent Bataille's division to occupy Vionville, Verge's division to control the heights north of Gorze and Lapasset's brigade to occupy the Bois de St. Arnould. The German artillery batteries at Vionville were now subject to artillery and skirmisher fire and were sent fleeing. By 1000, the German cavalry was compelled to retreat all down the line before the superior force of the French. At this stage, the Prussian 5th and 6th Infantry Divisions of III Corps reached the battlefield.\n\nIII Corps marched up from the Moselle valley on the morning of 16 August. At 0730 5th Infantry Division began marching along the road from Novéant to Gorze, their objective being Vionville. Its advance guard, the 9th Infantry Brigade under General von Döring, arrived at Gorze at 0900, where 6th Cavalry Division had already re-deployed. They received reports from III Corps outposts and the 6th Cavalry Division of French forces advancing on Gorze along the Rezonville plateau. Prussian troops began ascending the plateau around 0900. Two squadrons of Prussian dragoons were forced back by French infantry fire. Commanded by Colonel von Garrelts, the 1st and 2nd musketeer battalions of the 48th Infantry Regiment advanced, the 1st on the left and the 2nd on right with each in a two-line formation, up the ridge to capture the Bois de Vionville and had by 1015 made sufficient progress for the 1st light artillery battery under Captain Stüphasius to unlimber on their flank and for General von Döring to move up the rest of his men in support. The fusilier battalion of the 48th deployed in two lines to the left of the battery, while the 3rd Rifle Battalion secured the nearby Anconville farm. \n\nThe commanding general of 5th Infantry Division, von Stülpnagel, first thought that the 9th Infantry Brigade would suffice to deal with the French advance, enabling the rest of the division to move on Flavigny but a personal view of the combat convinced him otherwise. He ordered all 24 of his division's guns into action under the centralized command of Major Gallus. The French 1st Infantry Division under General Verge deployed on the plateau, seeking to outflank the Prussians on both flanks. The 48th Infantry Regiment's two musketeer battalions, reinforced by three rifle companies from 3rd Rifle Battalion, engaged in intense combat, including hand-to-hand fighting, against the French in the Bois de Vionville and had by 1100 mostly captured it. To the east, the Prussian Body Guard Regiment advanced directly north from Gorze and two of its battalions slowly pushed back Lapasset's brigade in the Bois de St. Arnould. \nTo the west, an attempt by the 48th Infantry Regiment's fusilier battalion to flank the French positions on the plateau was outflanked in turn by the French, who used their superior numbers to good effect. The battalion was slaughtered and routed by the French. Major Count Schlippenbach's 1st Battalion of the 10th Infantry Brigade's 52nd Infantry Regiment advanced in open company columns to plug the gap and save the now-exposed German artillery. They made initial headway and pushed back the French but eventually fell victim to overwhelming French infantry firepower with all the battalion's officers killed or wounded. They did succeed in buying time for more German reinforcements to arrive. General von Döring was killed at this point, while moving to his left wing. As the French advanced to destroy the crumbling left wing of the 5th Infantry Division, the 2nd Battalion and fusilier battalion of the 52nd Infantry Regiment under Colonel von Wulffen moved up the plateau and used their fire and bayonets to chase the French back to Flavigny. German losses were heavy, with the fusilier battalion commander Major Herwarth von Bittenfeld killed and the 2nd Battalion's commander Major von Bünau wounded. The fusilier battalion nearly ran out of ammunition. Other artillery batteries of III Corps near Tronville provided fire support that contributed to the success of the 52nd. The German artillery could now move forward on the left flank. An X Corps detachment of two infantry battalions, two dragoon squadrons and one artillery battery arrived to reinforce 5th Infantry Division, raising its artillery strength to 30 guns and creating a strong position for the German batteries by 1200. The heavy German artillery fire forced the French to support 2nd Army Corps with guns from the army reserve.\n\nAccompanied by Alvensleben, 6th Infantry Division and the corps artillery began moving from Arnaville to Mars-la-Tour at 0500. At 0630 they received a cavalry reconnaissance report of French formations between Vionville and Tronville. At 0800, the division spotted the French camps themselves. Alvensleben personally reconnoitered the French positions. Believing that he faced the French rearguard, Alvensleben ordered 6th Infantry Division to move north past Mars-la-Tour and block the French retreat to the west. The divisional artillery batteries under Major General von Bülow moved up and formed a gun line by 1030, bombarding the French infantry between Vionville and Flavigny and softening them up for the German infantry assault to come. French infantry fire inflicted casualties on the German artillerymen, who lacked infantry support of their own.\nThe 6th Infantry Division was now in line with Tronville. Lieutenant General Gustav von Buddenbrock, commander of the division, conducted a personal reconnaissance of the Vionville-Flavigny area. Finding both villages controlled by substantial numbers of Frenchmen, he concentrated all the force at his disposal to capture them. His 12th Brigade advanced along both sides of the road from Mars-la-Tour to Vionville, while 11th Brigade used the road from Tronville. Two German regiments, the 35th and 64th, launched a flawless attack on Vionville, throwing their companies forward in well-organized bounds, using ravines and woods to cover their approach, gaining fire superiority at 300 meters and assaulting the village from the north, west and south at 1130. The place was secured and the French regiment of chasseurs guarding it routed in thirty minutes, with large numbers of them surrendering. The German victory was the direct result of the thorough peacetime training of the German infantry companies and battalions and the exploitation of initiative by German officers. \n\nThe initial attack on Flavigny by one battalion of the 35th was less successful, with French infantry fire slashing them to a disorganized remnant when they merely attempted to cross the cemetery hill near Flavigny. Flavigny was conquered by 1200 through Prussian artillery firepower that reduced the hamlet to a burning rubble from multiple sides. Regiments from the 6th and 5th Infantry Divisions stormed the village from the west and the south, firming up the center of the III Corps battle line for the rest of the day. Two 5th Infantry Division battalions advanced north from Flavigny to take the ground in front. 6th Infantry Division pushed back the French along the road to Rezonville.\n\nWith Vionville and Flavigny lost and the French 2nd Army Corps retreating toward Rezonville, Bazaine and Frossard at 1230 ordered the cavalry to stabilize the course of the battle. The 3rd Lancers at Rezonville was ordered to attack the Prussian pursuers but did not charge home because \"no definite object of attack had been pointed out to them\". The Cuirassiers of the Guard moved to attack, forming up in two lines of two squadrons with the fifth as reserve. The Prussian infantry companies fired by file and massacred them at 200 meters range. The French lost 230 men and 243 horses, and the rest fled as a helpless remnant. Lieutenant Colonel Leo von Caprivi, chief of staff of X Corps, advised Rauch's 17th Hussars to charge the disorganized French cuirassiers at 1245. Rauch promptly did so, while Lieutenant Colonel Eberstein's 11th Hussars hunted down the French infantry stragglers. They also destroyed a French Guard battery and captured the guns, but could not haul them away for want of draught horses. The 3rd French rifle battalion and two French cavalry squadrons arrived and forced the Germans to retreat.\nOnce 2nd Army Corps defeat became clear, Alvensleben ordered the 6th Cavalry Division to pursue. At the same time, Bazaine moved the Grenadier and Voltigeur Divisions forward to support 2nd Army Corps. 6th Cavalry Division was thus halted on the Rezonville plateau at 1300 by an onslaught of French infantry and artillery fire before it could even fully deploy and was forced to withdraw both of its brigades after heavy casualties. The cavalry did enable the forward movement of German artillery to more advantageous positions. The German artillery pounded the French infantry incessantly, forcing the French to hang back and preventing them from exploiting the German infantry's ammunition shortage or the casualties of the German cavalry. As the 6th Prussian Infantry Division advanced on Rezonville, it was subject to flanking infantry and artillery fire by Canrobert's 6th Army Corps to the north along the so-called Roman road, forcing the Prussian division to halt its attack and front north. The Prussians suffered heavy losses from the French guns. They beat off French attacks on their position but at a high cost under the intense French fire. 5th Infantry Division's 10th Brigade advance on Rezonville from the south reached the Metz-Verdun road but was then thrown back by overwhelming French infantry firepower, which killed or wounded nearly all officers of the brigade. Out of ammunition and largely destroyed, the 10th Brigade retreated to Vionville and Flavigny.\nBazaine saw the arrival of more Prussian forces up the Moselle valley against his left flank as the biggest threat to his position. Accordingly, at noon, he re-deployed the Imperial Guard, the Voltigeur Division and the reconstituted remnants of 2nd Army Corps on his left. All other available forces were directed to outflank the Prussian left wing. At 1330, two French divisions advanced against the German left flank to the west of Vionville, with 4th Army Corps on the way. An X Corps demi-brigade had arrived on the battlefield to reinforce the Germans at 1145 and secured the woods near Tronville by 1230. They were soon attacked by the long-range fire of the French chassepots to which they could not reply owing to the inferior range of their Dreyse needle guns. With the German fire weakening, Canrobert moved to re-capture Vionville. By 1400, Alvensleben's III Corps was facing four deployed French corps. With all his infantry and artillery committed and largely spent, only his cavalry could stop Canrobert's onslaught. Alvensleben directed 5th Cavalry Division to secure the corps left flank with two brigades, while the third heavy brigade under Major-General Friedrich Wilhelm Adalbert von Bredow would remain at his disposal. To protect the German position, Alvensleben sent his chief of staff, Colonel von Voigts Rhetz, to Bredow with orders to silence Canrobert's batteries along the Roman road.\nNoting that \"it will cost what it will\", von Bredow took care to organize the brigade, consisting of the 7th Cuirassiers, 13th Dragoons, and 16th Uhlans. The 13th Dragoons did not participate in the charge, having been detached earlier in the battle. In what would become known as \"Von Bredow's Death Ride\", the cavalrymen rode out from Prussian lines at 1400, von Bredow using the depression north of Vionville and gun smoke to mask movements from French observers until the very last moment. Erupting into view some 1000 meters from the French lines, the Prussian cavalry charged in line into and through two French gun lines, killing French gunners and scattering Canrobert's soldiers in all directions. Two brigades of Forton's French cavalry division, some 3,100 men, attempted to counter-charge into Bredow's flank and rear, but were partially dispersed by Canrobert's infantry, who gunned down any cavalrymen they could see without discrimination. General von Bredow's brigade managed to extricate itself and withdrew to their own lines by 1500. The French cavalry did not pursue. Of the 800 horsemen who had started out, only 420 returned.\nIt was at this moment that Bazaine ordered Canrobert's 6th Army Corps to stop its attack. The pressure on the Prussian 6th Infantry Division ceased. The battle west of Rezonville around the Metz-Verdun road evolved into an artillery duel. On the German left, General von Barby's 11th cavalry brigade was holding its ground north of Tronville. The French and German artillery exchanged shell fire at first and when Grenier's Division from 4th Army Corps arrived, the French began to advance at 1445. Fire from French skirmisher swarms and mitrailleuses overwhelmed Barby's cavalry at 500-meters range and the Germans fell back slowly on Tronville. Four French divisions, two from 3rd Army Corps, Grenier's from General Landmirault's 4th Army Corps and Trixier's from 6th Army Corps, were now massed against the German left flank and poised to outflank it. Faced with French artillery fire, all German forces north of Vionville began to withdraw slowly, delaying the French for an hour. They were helped by the wet ground, which impeded the French movements. French counter-battery fire forced the advanced Prussian batteries, which had nearly exhausted their ammunition stocks, to abandon their positions and restock on ammunition south-west of Vionville.\n\nAs the French stood poised to overwhelm the heavily-outnumbered III Corps, X Corps 20th Infantry Division under General von Kraatz reached the battlefield near Tronville at 1600, having marched . 20th Infantry Division's staff officers and Kraatz personally reconnoitered the vicinity of Tronville and Flavigny and identified the III Corps center as badly weakened. Kraatz ordered his division to reinforce that position immediately. The roar of cannon fire had caused X Corps commander General von Voigts-Rhetz to investigate it and upon arriving in Tronville, reports from his chief of staff Caprivi and the ongoing battle convinced Voigts-Rhetz to move his entire corps at once to support III Corps at 1130. At Tronville, two batteries of X Corps artillery under Baron von der Goltz were joined by two divisional batteries and they concentrated a highly successful fire on Grenier's French artillery. Major Körber's four batteries nearby were joined by a battery of horse artillery, and the German gun mass then blasted the French skirmisher swarms at 750 meters and sent them running back north in disarray. By 1600, III and X Corps had 210 guns supporting them on the battlefield.\nTwo battalions from the 20th Infantry Division's 79th Regiment formed up near Tronville at 1530. They held their positions on the eastern edges of a nearby wood and stood the French infantry fire directed against them. The 40th Brigade deployed at Tronville at 1630. They advanced to secure the ground east and north of it and had to endure only French shell fire. The French still had superior forces available but did not pursue their attack, largely thanks to Bazaine's obsession with the French left flank. He ordered the 3rd Army Corps under Lebouef on his right to merely hold their positions. At 1500, Bazaine sent 3rd Army Corps to his left flank to protect Rezonville. As a result, most of Lebouef's troops did not fight at all on 16 August. Bazaine's order was a great help to Alvensleben's III Corps.\n\nPrince Friedrich Karl did not become aware of the precariousness of III Corps struggle until 1400, when a report from Kraatz informed him of the situation. He rode with his staff to the battlefield, gaining the Rezonville plateau at 1600 to the cheers of his troops. The III Corps and French infantry positions on the plateau, reinforced by strong artillery forces, were so firm that frontal attacks would be impossible. Friedrich Karl decided to fight offensively only with X Corps to the left when it arrived, while III Corps, with the help of X Corps 20th Infantry Division, would fight primarily with the artillery. The artillery batteries of the 5th, 16th and 20th Infantry Divisions were concentrated east of Flavigny under the command of General von Bülow, where they maintained a continuous fire on the French artillery north of the Metz-Verdun road. Isolated attacks by French infantry were beaten off by Prussian artillery before the French could even get within range of the Prussian infantry's needle guns. Two German battalions of 78th East Friesland Regiment under Colonel von Lyncker attempted to capture a height (989) south of Rezonville but failed after a few hundred meters. Lyncker was wounded along with all his company commanders. Two grenadier battalions of the 12th Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel von Kalinowski, supported by two 16th Infantry Division artillery batteries, pushed forward a line of skirmishers to a valley below the 989 height. Three battalions from the 20th Infantry Division arrived and also attempted to capture the 989 height, likewise failing under the French fire. They did gain a position on the slope of the height and defeat French attempts to throw them back. Apart from these relatively modest successes and failures, III Corps situation was stable by 1700.\nMeanwhile, half of 19th Infantry Division under General Emil von Schwartzkoppen reached Tronville and Kraatz requested that they attack the French right wing to the north-east. Schwartzkoppen moved out and concentrated his 39th Brigade in an arc north-east of Mars-la-Tour. At 1700, the infantry companies of the 39th Brigade advanced north-east in rushes of 100 meters, laid down and rushed again, all under constant French chassepot and mitrailleuse fire. Its five battalions got within 30 meters of the positions of Grenier's infantry. The French infantry fired by file and shattered the Prussians. Adding to the Prussian disaster, Cissey's Division outflanked the Prussians on their left. The 39th Brigade retreated and the French pursuit fire nearly annihilated its remnants. Some 300 exhausted Prussians, having marched 27 miles and attacked the French immediately on arrival, were captured by the French.\n\nAt 1800, the French crossed the ravine north of the Roman road and advanced on Mars-la-Tour. Voigts-Rhetz's cavalry launched repeated charges to hold them off and the French retreated back over the ravine. The 13th Line infantry regiment of Grenier's Division was ridden down and the 2nd Chasseurs d'Afrique cavalry regiment forced back. The Germans used the gained time and space to deploy more artillery batteries to reinforce their left flank. Landmirault's 4th Army Corps deployed six regiments of cavalry on its left flank west of Bruville and north of Mars-la-Tour. Barby's cavalry brigade and two more regiments moved to confront them. At 1845, the opposing cavalry masses collided in a struggle involving 5,000 horsemen and 40 squadrons. Each side sought to outflank the other in the melee. The German regiments succeeded in imposing themselves on the French flank and rear and the entire French cavalry force disintegrated in a rout, fleeing toward Bruville with dust clouds rising behind them. After their complete victory in the greatest and most important cavalry battle of the entire Franco-Prussian War, the Prussian cavalry regiments reformed their ranks and withdrew toward Mars-la-Tour, having defeated the threat to the Prussian left flank. With darkness approaching, Landmirault gave up on his attempts to capture Mars-la-Tour and Tronville. By 1900, the Prussian positions north of Tronville were untroubled save for harassment fire from French artillery.\n\nOn the Prussian right, IX Corps under General Albrecht Gustav von Manstein reached the battlefield at 1600. The 72nd Regiment of the 16th Infantry Division gained the northern edges of the Bois de St. Arnould at 1700 and advanced up the ridge to its north. Despite relentless French fire and considerable casualties, the Regiment captured the height (970) but was then driven back by French reserves at 1730. The 40th Regiment advanced in support and took back the 970 ridge, but was compelled in turn to retreat by yet more French reserves. The 11th Regiment assaulted and took back the height at 1800 and was also forced to retreat by Bazaine's reserves. A French attempt to exploit their success was repulsed as the Prussian infantry fired by file.\n\nAround 1800, Bazaine ordered the 2nd brigade of the Voltigeurs of the Guard to take secure the 989 height. They succeeded against the Prussian infantry but accurate Prussian artillery fire forced the French to abandon it. South of the 970 height, the struggle waged back and forth after 1900, with neither side able to gain ground owing to the effectiveness of the firepower of their enemies. With the full strength of IX Corps deploying at his left by 1900, Prince Friedrich Karl ordered III and X Corps to move on Rezonville. Led by artillery batteries, the Prussian advance was stopped by the fire of a concentration of 54 guns of the French Imperial Guard under General Charles-Denis Bourbaki, compelling the Prussian batteries to fall back after a brief response. The 6th Cavalry Division had been called upon by Friedrich Karl, and they charged the French skirmishers along the Rezonville road but while they panicked some, they could make no permanent headway against the French infantry fire. As the strength of the French forces was too great, Friedrich Karl's general attack on Rezonville was not undertaken. \n\nThe battle ended at 2100 after twelve hours. The warm summer day gave way to a cold night, as the troops rested in their bivouacs and the lines of outposts maintained a watch over the blood-soaked fields.\n\nBetween 2200 and 2300, Friedrich Karl ordered the Guards and XII Corps to assemble at Mars-la-Tour on the 17th. After a stream of reports on the battle from III and X Corps and present staff officers, the royal headquarters in the afternoon of 16 August ordered 1st Army under Steinmetz to prepare to cross the Moselle over to the left bank. Steinmetz implemented orders to the effect and two pontoon bridges were erected on the night of 16–17 August for VII and VIII Corps. The Germans were amassing all available forces to defeat any French attack on 17 August.\n\nBazaine believed he had fought equal forces on 16 August and would have to deal with an immensely superior enemy on 17 August. French ammunition expenditure had been colossal and ammunition and food stocks would have to replenished before the fight could begin again. The French supply trains were too far back near the Moselle for resupply to be accomplished on 16 August. The French soldiers were physically exhausted and morally shaken by the long and severe battle and one later French military writer opined that the entire French army would have retreated in panic on 17 August had the Germans advanced. Citing the need to acquire more ammunition and the distance from the supply trains, Bazaine issued an order on the night of 16–17 August for his army to fall back closer to Metz. The strong defensive positions of the fortress would, he thought, enable him to inflict massive losses on the Germans and crush their armies. After resupplying, Bazaine would begin anew the march to the Meuse on 19 and 20 August. Despite some skirmishing on 17 August, the Prussians did not pursue the French in force, as attacking that day was not their intention. The French withdrew to the Plappeville plateau east of Gravelotte over the course of the day. There the Battle of Gravelotte would be fought on 18 August.\n\nTactically, neither side succeeded in dislodging the other from their positions during the day. The French withdrew during the night. The battle was a strategic victory for the Prussians. Bazaine had failed to make it to Verdun. After the Battle of Gravelotte on 18 August, the Prussians trapped Bazaine in the city on 19 August, and the Siege of Metz ensued, concluding with the surrender of the French Army of the Rhine on 27 October.\n\nVon Bredow's death ride \"was perhaps the last successful cavalry charge in Western European warfare\". Its success won it renown among military historians, which created a myth to the effect that \"for some decades 'Bredow’s achievement was the norm',\" that cavalry could still play a decisive role in battle in a modern war between equally equipped forces, and so cavalry units continued to be part of the armed forces of major European powers for the next half century.\n\nIII Corps 15 artillery batteries expended 11,520 rounds during the battle, an average of 768 rounds per battery. Following the consumption of another 2,740 rounds at Gravelotte on 18 August, the corps restocked on 20 August by completely emptying its five artillery ammunition columns, as well as two more assigned to it from other corps. The 25 battalions of III Corps fired 720,496 rounds of small arms ammunition during the battle, an average of 28,819 per battalion. Some of the front-line infantry battalions of III Corps at Mars-la-Tour were the first German infantry formations to face significant ammunition shortages during the war. III Corps, like all other German corps, had abundant supplies of ammunition; the problem was rather that the infantry battalions at the front were so closely engaged with the enemy that they had become too separated from their ammunition columns and quick replenishment was difficult or impossible. Ammunition shortages were limited to only some of the front-line formations; overall, at Mars-la-Tour and during the war as a whole, German infantry ammunition expenditure was less than expected.\n\nGerman losses were 15,799 officers and men, including 236 officers and 4,185 men killed or dead of wounds, 470 officers, 9,932 men and 9 surgeons wounded and 5 officers and 962 men missing. Horse casualties totaled 2,736. III Corps suffered 44.0% of the German casualties and lost 6,955 officers, men and surgeons, including 1,863 killed or dead of wounds, 4,889 wounded and 203 missing.\n\nThe French lost 17,007 officers and men, including 879 officers and 16,128 men, along with one artillery piece.\n\n"}

{"id": "1808763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808763", "title": "Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower", "text": "Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower\n\nThe Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, colloquially known as the Met Life Tower and also as the South Building, is a skyscraper occupying a full block in the Flatiron District of Manhattan in New York City. The building is composed of two sections: a tower at the northwest corner of the block, at Madison Avenue and 24th Street, and a shorter east wing occupying the remainder of the block bounded by Madison Avenue, Park Avenue South, 23rd Street, and 24th Street. The South Building, along with the North Building directly across 24th Street, comprises the Metropolitan Home Office Complex, which originally served as the headquarters of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (now publicly known as MetLife).\n\nThe South Building's tower was designed by the architectural firm of Napoleon LeBrun & Sons and erected between 1905 and 1909. Inspired by St Mark's Campanile, the tower features four clock faces, four bells, and lighted beacons at its top, and was the tallest building in the world until 1913. The tower originally included Metropolitan Life's offices, but since 2015, it has contained the New York Edition Hotel, a 273-room luxury hotel. The tower was designated as a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1989, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It was also made a National Historic Landmark in 1978.\n\nThe South Building's east wing was designed by D. Everett Waid and constructed in two stages between 1953 and 1960. The east wing is occupied primarily by Credit Suisse and is also referred to as 1 Madison Avenue. It replaced another building on the site, which was built in phases from 1893 to 1905, and which was also designed by LeBrun's firm. When the current east wing was built, the clock tower was extensively renovated as well.\n\nThe Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, or the South Building, is composed of the east wing and the tower. It occupies an entire block between Madison Avenue and Madison Square Park to the west, 24th Street to the north, Park Avenue South to the east, and 23rd Street to the south. The block measures from north to south and from east to west. The original 11-story, full-block east wing was completed in 1893 and was designed by Napoleon LeBrun & Sons. The tower was a later addition to the original building, constructed between 1905 and 1909. The original home office building was replaced with the current building, designed by D. Everett Waid, between 1953 and 1957. The complex is one of the few remaining major insurance company \"home offices\" in New York City.\n\nThe building's tower is located at the northwest corner of the block, at Madison Avenue and 24th Street, with the address 5 Madison Avenue. The tower rises to its pinnacle. It has a footprint measuring north-south along Madison Avenue and west-east on 24th Street. This gives the tower a height-to-width ratio of 8.25:1. The Metropolitan Life Tower is modeled after St Mark's Campanile in Venice, Italy; though the tower is older than its model, since St Mark's Campanile had collapsed in 1902 and was replaced in 1912.\n\nLike the facades of many early skyscrapers, the tower's exterior was divided into three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column—namely a base, shaft, and capital—in both its original and renovated forms. These three sections include usable space inside and are collectively tall. The tower is topped by a pyramidal roof, which is slightly set back and contains a cupola and lantern. The tower was originally sheathed in Tuckahoe marble, provided by the Hedden Construction Company. During the 1964 renovation, plain limestone was used to cover the tower and the east wing, replacing LeBrun's old Renaissance revival details with a streamlined, modern look.\n\nSome of steel were used in the clock tower's structural frame. The footings of the tower are deep, supported by twelve columns on the edges and eight columns inside the plot, and anchored to a layer of bedrock between deep. The main columns were located at the tower's corners, bearing structural loads of up to , when wind pressure was taken into account.\n\nThe base comprises the first and second stories. The lowest portion of the facade along Madison Avenue and 24th Street contains a water table made of granite, which wraps around to the east wing. At the first floor, there are two rectangular show windows and a small doorway on Madison Avenue, and two show windows flanking a larger entrance on 24th Street. On the second floor, the Madison Avenue and 24th Street sides each contain three short tripartite windows.\n\nWhen the tower was built, the base comprised the first through fifth stories. A large cornice was located above the fourth story, and smaller cornices above the second and fifth stories. The original ornamentation on the rest of the tower was relatively restrained, except around the clock faces. The 1960s renovation replaced the marble between the first and fifth stories, and between the 20th and 36th stories, with limestone.\n\nThe \"shaft\" of the tower spans the third through 28th floors. The southern facade of the tower contains windows only above the 11th story, and the eastern facade contains windows above the 12th story, because the former east wing was located below these floors. On each floor, the \"shaft\" contains three sets of three windows per side, except on the 25th through 27th floors, where the building's clocks are located. On these floors, there are two paired windows on the outer edges of the tower. The 29th and 30th floors serve stylistically as \"transitional stories\", with ten windows per side on each floor; the 29th floor contains a single arrangement of 10 windows, while the 30th-floor windows have been divided into five pairs. This is largely the same arrangement as the original, except that in LeBrun's design, the \"shaft\" comprised the sixth through 30th floors.\n\nThe 31st through 38th floors comprise the tower's \"capital\". The 31st through 33rd floors are arranged as a loggia with arcades containing five arches on each side. The facade of the tower is recessed behind the arcade, and a balustrade wraps around the edges of the arcade, creating a patio. When built, the arcade was composed of stone columns, but these were replaced with masonry columns in the 1960s renovation. On the 34th floor, there are five windows per side, corresponding to the arches below. The setback tower rises from the 35th through 38th stories as a freestanding plinth. On these floors, the window arrangement indicates that the northern and southern facades are wider than the western and eastern facades, with six windows to the north and south, and four to the west and east.\n\nA clock face is centered on all four sides of the tower from the 25th through 27th floors. Each clock face is 26.5 feet (8 m) in diameter, while the numerals on the clock faces are four feet (1.2 m) tall. The numerals and minute markers on the clock faces are edged with copper, while the minute and hour hands are made of iron with a copper sheathing. The minute hands weigh and are long, while the hour hands weigh and are long. The mechanism was controlled by electricity, a novelty upon the tower's completion. The master clock, which controlled the large clock faces as well as a hundred other clocks in the same complex, was located on the first floor of the former home office, and ran with a maximum error of five seconds per month.\n\nThe clock faces were the largest in the world upon their completion. The clock faces are made of reinforced concrete. Blue glazed tiles run along the circumference of each face; in addition, there is a tiled corona at the center of each face. The clock faces contain ornamentation by Pierre LeBrun, of Napoleon LeBrun and Sons. These include dolphins and shells on the spandrels at each face's corner, as well as marble wreaths with fruit-and-flower motifs on the faces themselves.\n\nThe pyramidal roof comprises the 39th and higher floors, and is set off by a cornice at the 39th-story level. Dormer windows protrude from the roof on the 39th through 43rd floors; these dormers contain semi-circular hoods, except for the 39th-floor dormers, which do not contain any hoods. The higher floors of the roof have fewer windows on each side. The 44th floor is illuminated by two small windows on each side, located between ribs that rise to support a square viewing platform on the 45th floor. The 46th and 47th floors comprise a two-story-tall peristyle, supported by eight columns. The 48th floor contains a gold-colored aluminum cupola with eight windows. The topmost level is the 49th floor, which consists only of a platform with a gold-colored aluminium railing. The 41st through 45th floors are accessible only by a staircase. The viewing platform was originally publicly usable, receiving 120,000 visitors from around the world between 1909 and 1914.\n\nThe tower contains four bells within the peristyle. These include a B♭ bell on the west, a E♭ bell on the east, a F♮ bell on the north, and a G♮ bell on the south. The bells were the highest in the world at the time of their construction. These are respectively struck by hammers weighing 94, 71, 61, and 54 pounds (equivalent to , , , and kg respectively). A fifth hammer, weighing , strikes the 7,000-pound bell each hour. The smaller hammers strike the bells every 15 minutes. On weekdays between 9a.m. and 10p.m., and on weekends between 10a.m. and 10p.m., the bells played \"I Know That My Redeemer Liveth\" every 15 minutes. The bells were not given nicknames: rather, Metropolitan Life referred to each bell by its cardinal direction.\n\nAn eight-sided, beacon is located at the top of the cupola. As designed, the white lantern is lit after 10:00 p.m., and momentarily turns off every 15 minutes when red and white lights flash the time. The beacon was one of a few broadly visible features of the New York City nighttime skyline until the mid-20th century.\n\nWhen built, the clock tower featured granite floors and metal interior furnishings, though there was very little wood trim, unlike other contemporary structures. The lower floors contained bronze grillwork and doorways, especially around the elevators, while on the upper floors, ornamental iron is used for the metalwork around the elevators. The second-floor spaces contained offices of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and contained white marble wainscoting, plaster cornices, marble mantels, etched-glass doors facing the executive offices, and red mahogany door, wall, and window panels. Each of the tower's floors are up to in area, smaller than the floor areas of most other nearby office buildings. During the 1960s renovation, the tower was fitted with more modern furnishings such as air conditioning, acoustic ceiling tiles, and automatic elevators, to match the new eastern wing. Marble floors were one of the few holdovers of the previous decor. The staircase leading to the top floors of the tower also retains its original decoration, including cast-iron railings, ceramic-tile wainscoting, marble stair treads, and landings with mosaic-tile floors.\n\nSince 2015, the clock tower has been a 273-room luxury hotel called the New York Edition Hotel, with per-night hotel room rates starting at $600. Most of the historic detail in the interior was removed in the individual hotel rooms, but there are some remaining vestiges, such as the original scalloped ceilings. On the second floor is an upscale restaurant called The Clocktower, a Michelin-starred eatery headed by British chef Jason Atherton. The restaurant has a dining area, a separate bar, and a room with a billiards table, and is only accessible through the building's lobby.\n\nThe east wing is located at 1 Madison Avenue. It is 14 stories tall and extends east to Park Avenue South, covering nearly the entire block. It has nearly of interior space. Unlike the clock tower, it is still used primarily as office space, with Credit Suisse as the main tenant.\n\nThe east wing's internal structure consists of a steel frame. The lowest two floors contain a granite facade, while the remaining stories contain a facade of Alabama limestone, as well as stainless-steel spandrels between each window. There are setbacks behind the second, 10th, and 12th floors.\n\nThe lobby of the east wing was combined with that of the clock tower when the east wing was constructed. It consists of floors and walls made of white marble and darker-marble accents, as well as a sheet rock ceiling with lighting panels, and stainless-steel doors and trim. Above the lobby are the office floors, which contain sheet rock walls and dropped ceilings; around the elevator lobbies, the floors are made of terrazzo tiles, and the walls contain a travertine veneer. The lowest six floors are served mainly by escalators and the upper floors are served by elevators. There is also wood paneling on the walls near the executive offices. A replica of the original home office's board room was built on the 11th floor of the east wing, and features mahogany wainscoting, a coffered ceiling, and leather covering the walls.\n\nThe east wing is connected to the Metropolitan Life North Building by a preexisting tunnel, as well as by a sky bridge on the eighth floor. At the southeastern corner, on the basement level, there is a direct entrance to the downtown platform of the New York City Subway's 23rd Street station, served by the .\n\nThe original home office occupied the same area as the current east wing. The section facing 23rd Street was 11 stories tall and the section on 24th Street was 12 stories tall, with a total height of . Designed by Napoleon LeBrun, it contained Italian Renaissance motifs along the entire facade. The home office was erected in multiple sections, with the 23rd Street side being completed first.\n\nThe tower and home office originally had a facade of ashlar on the first story, and an elaborate arcade of columns and pilasters on the second and third stories. The main entrance along Madison Avenue, as well as of the 23rd Street facade, contained slightly projecting columns, which created porticoes. Similar to the original design of the tower, the original home office had a large cornice above the fourth floor and smaller cornices above the second and fifth floors. On the fourth through ninth floors, the facade was arranged with deeply molded and decorated reveals, as well as carved mullions. These elements were arranged to form an arched arcade, which extended through the ninth floor; the windows were located in slightly recessed bays between each arch.\n\nInside the building, a large marble corridor ran between the entrances at Madison Avenue and Fourth Avenue (now Park Avenue South). Accessible from this hallway was a United States Post Office branch, a Western Union telegraph booth, a bank, telephone booths, and numerous shops. Cross-passages ran north and south to 24th and 23rd Streets, and stairs led to the subway station's downtown platform. The main rotunda was at the Madison Avenue entrance, measuring square and high, from which a stairway ascended to the second floor. Within the home office, there were 38 elevators, serving 1,100 tenants. The building contained an extensive fire sprinkler system with standpipes and automatic sprinklers.\n\nThe home office served as the nexus of Metropolitan Life's operations and largely contained an open plan work space. The exception was the executive offices, which were decorated with mahogany. The interior layout was rearranged approximately every five years, at least in the building's early history, though the interior arrangements were always focused on worker efficiency. The structure was generally not publicly accessible, and employees' movements were closely monitored. Conversely, there were also many amenities for employees, including a library, auditorium, gymnasium, and medical and dental offices. There was also a recreational space on the roof of the home office's 23rd Street portion, and through the larger complex's extensive system of kitchens and dining rooms, the company offered free lunch to every employee between 1908 and 1994. Though the home office accommodated 14,500 workers by 1938, they were split up into different social hierarchies, with immigrants in service jobs, women in seamstresses' and cleaners' jobs, and native-born workers of both genders in white-collar jobs.\n\nBefore the home office at Madison Square was completed, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (now MetLife) had been headquartered at three buildings in Lower Manhattan, all of which have been demolished. Its first headquarters was at 243 Broadway, which the company occupied between 1868 and 1869. This headquarters comprised two and a half rooms totaling \"not more than 900 square feet\" (): one for the president and another for the remaining staff. In 1870, Metropolitan Life moved to 319 Broadway's third floor, a slightly larger space that also contained a supply room. The company moved again in 1876 to Park Place and Church Street, during which its operations grew rapidly: by 1889, Metropolitan Life had outgrown the Church Street building. The company had $250 million in industrial life insurance policies by 1891.\n\nAt the time, life insurance companies generally had their own buildings for their offices and branch locations, to ensure that they had instilled \"not only its name but also a favorable impression of its operations\" in the general public. This had been a trend since 1870, with the completion of the former Equitable Life Building in Manhattan's Financial District. Furthermore, life insurance companies of the late 19th and early 20th centuries generally built massive buildings to fit their large clerical and records-keeping staff.\n\nIn 1890 the company purchased the corner site at Madison Avenue and 23rd Street, which measured , across from Madison Square Park. Joseph Fairchild Knapp, Metropolitan Life's president, hired Napoleon LeBrun to design a seven-story Italian Renaissance office building on 23rd Street between Madison Avenue and Fourth Avenue. Work commenced in May 1890 with the demolition of five brownstone mansions at 23rd Street and Madison Avenue. Knapp died before the structure's 1893 completion, and the building was subsequently expanded to 11 stories. Metropolitan Life occupied the second through fifth floors for its own use, but soon afterward expanded to the sixth and ninth stories, while filling the ground-story storefront spaces. The company occupied the first portion of the home office in early 1893. At the time, it had 650 workers.\n\nThe first section of the home office was completed in mid-1894. By that time, the company had full control of almost all lots on the north side of 23rd Street between Madison and Fourth Avenues, as well as a frontage of on 24th Street. One lot on 23rd Street was not acquired until June 1895; once Metropolitan Life bought that plot, it built a two-story structure on the remaining plot, which was later raised to 11 stories. Meanwhile, Metropolitan Life built a 12-story building on the plots along 24th Street, which was completed in October 1895 and was occupied that November. Additionally, the Standard National Bank opened a branch on the home office's Madison Avenue side in 1895. Metropolitan Life made a purchase offer for the National Academy of Design site at Fourth Avenue and 23rd Street in 1894; however, the company did not acquire title to the land until June 1899, thus completing its property acquisition on 23rd Street.\n\nMost of the lots on the 24th Street side were purchased starting in 1894 for the construction of a 12-story addition to the home office. The company bought the Lyceum Theatre site on Fourth Avenue in 1902. Metropolitan Life bought the corner of Fourth Avenue and 24th Street in 1902–1903 and constructed the next portion of the home office on the Lyceum Theatre and Academy of Design sites. That section was occupied in May 1906. By 1905, Metropolitan Life had acquired most of the lots on the south side of 24th Street between Madison and Fourth avenues. The only lot the company had not acquired was the Madison Square Presbyterian Church, built in 1854 at the southeastern corner of Madison Avenue and 24th Street. The gradual development of the block had led to the construction of other skyscrapers surrounding Madison Square, such as the Flatiron Building in 1902 and the Fifth Avenue Building (now Toy Center) in 1908.\n\nIn April 1906, Metropolitan Life bought the church lot, on which it intended to build a tower. The church building was razed soon after the purchase of the site. In exchange for Metropolitan Life's purchase, the church received a plot of land across 24th Street that became the site for Stanford White's 1906 building for the Madison Square Presbyterian Church, sometimes called the \"Parkhurst Church\" after Reverend Charles Henry Parkhurst. Plans for the proposed clock tower were filed with the New York City Department of Buildings in January 1907. At the time, the tower was to rise above ground, with 48 usable stories, or 50 total. The building plans were modified in April 1908, providing for a 54-story tower, though the additional four stories were not built.\n\nBy February 1908, thirty-one stories of the tower had been built. The lower floors of the Metropolitan Life clock tower were occupied by May 1908, though the tower was not completed until 1909. The tower had cost $6.58 million, and the expanded complex had 2,800 workers at the time of the tower's completion. Metropolitan Life officials held a jubilee dinner in January 1910 to celebrate the tower's completion. The tower was the world's tallest building until 1913, when it was surpassed by the Woolworth Building in Tribeca, within lower Manhattan. A 1914 company history estimated that the entire complex could accommodate 20,000 visitors and tenants per day.\n\nA plot on the north side of 24th Street, measuring , was developed from 1903 to 1905 as the first Metropolitan Annex, a 16-story printing plant building faced in Tuckahoe marble. The annex was designed by LeBrun, and it was connected to the main building by a tunnel. White’s 1906 church building was demolished in 1919 to make way for an expansion of the northern annex, which was 18 stories tall. This annex was designed by D. Everett Waid and completed in 1921.\n\nBy the late 1920s, the clock tower, home office, and LeBrun's and Waid's northern annexes were becoming too small to house the continuously growing activities of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Looking to expand, the company acquired a full-block site directly to the north, between East 24th and 25th Streets. Architects Harvey Wiley Corbett and D. Everett Waid took up the project in 1928. The approved design for what would become the Metropolitan Life North Building was for a 100-story tower, but the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 caused the company to build only the 28-story base, which was built in three stages. LeBrun's and Waid's northern annexes remained until 1946, when they were demolished to make way for the final stage of the North Building. The North Building was completed in 1950 with the structural strength and the number of elevator shafts needed for a possible future expansion.\n\nEven with the addition of the North Building, the number of staff in the complex was steadily increasing, with 14,500 workers by 1938. To alleviate this, in 1950, Metropolitan Life announced that it would refurbish its entire headquarters. The initial plans were filed by Leonard Schultz and Associates, but after Schultz's 1951 death, Lloyd Morgan and Eugene Meroni took up the design process. In 1952, Morgan and Meroni filed plans with the New York City Department of Buildings for a completely new structure on the site of the existing home offices. A Metropolitan Life press release stated that a new structure was chosen over a renovation because the new structure would have more interior floor space, due to the elimination of the interior courtyard inside the old building, and because new construction was cheaper than renovation.\n\nWork started in 1953, and the company demolished auxiliary structures to make way for the new home office building. The tunnel to the northern annex was retained, and a sky bridge was built at the eighth floor of the new building. To minimize disruption to Metropolitan Life's operations, the new home office was erected in two stages, so construction on one part of the home office could go on while normal operations proceeded in the other portion. The first stage was built between 1953 and 1957, and the second, between 1958 and 1960.\n\nThe tower, the sole structure on the block that remained from the early 20th century, was renovated starting in 1961 to harmonize the design with Morgan and Meroni's east wing. Starrett Brothers & Eken were the general contractors and Purdy & Henderson were the structural engineers. During this time, the clock, bells, and roof were rebuilt. The renovation also remodeled the facade so it would be stylistically similar to the east wing, and so the decaying marble was replaced with limestone. Morgan eliminated most of the ornamentation added by LeBrun, though he preserved the clock tower's general proportions, and designed the east wing so that the tower would rise behind setbacks on the 10th, 11th, and 13th floors. The project was completed in 1964.\n\nIn 1982, the Cross & Brown Company leased out four of the floors in the clock tower, the first time in the building's history that space in the tower had been leased to outside tenants. The tower's floor areas were optimal for small organizations, and in 1985, Metropolitan Life vacated the South Building's tower, moving all remaining operations to the North Building and the South Building's east wing. At the time, 26 of the 40 lower floors had already been leased.\n\nA three-year, $35 million exterior restoration project, which saw much of the building covered in scaffolding, was undertaken between 1998 and 2002. During this time, the clock tower's marble facade was repaired, a new multicolored lighting system was added, and the cupola was re-gilded. Because the clock tower was on the National Register of Historic Places (having been added in 1972), MetLife was eligible for a tax break on the building.\n\nIn March 2005, SL Green Realty bought the clock tower, intending to convert it to apartments. The east wing was part of the sale, but would not be converted to apartments, being leased to Credit Suisse First Boston until at least 2020. In May 2007, the tower and adjacent air rights were subsequently sold for $200 million to Africa Israel Investments. In 2011, Tommy Hilfiger and a partner signed a contract to buy the clock tower for $170 million, planning to transform it into Hilfiger's first hotel, with luxury condominiums. However, Hilfiger backed off the project in September 2011. Africa Israel then sold the tower to Marriott International in October 2011 for $165 million. Marriott announced in January 2012 that it was converting the tower to the New York Edition Hotel, one of three boutique hotels in the Edition line. The Edition hotels were sold in January 2013 to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority for $815 million. The New York property was conveyed to its new owner on its completion. Marriott continues to manage the hotels under long-term contract, and the New York Edition Hotel opened in May 2015.\n\nMetropolitan Life intended the tower to promote the company's image, with company president John Rogers Hegeman calling the building \"a symbol of integrity\". As such, the tower was surrounded by publicity. It was featured on the front of prominent magazines such as \"Scientific American\", as well as on the sides of corn flake boxes, coffee packets, and cars. Metropolitan Life valued the free publicity surrounding its skyscraper at over $440,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). The company also published three oversized monographs with images featuring the building, in 1907, 1908, and 1914.\n\nThe tower figured prominently in Metropolitan Life's advertising for many years, illustrated with a light beaming from the top of its spire and the slogan \"The Light That Never Fails\". While other life insurance companies, such as the New York Life Insurance Company and Equitable Insurance Company, used sculptural representations for their respective symbols, Metropolitan Life used the building itself to represent the company's work and ideals.\n\nThough not structurally distinctive, the Metropolitan Life Tower nevertheless was highly scrutinized, being the world's tallest building upon its completion. The design of the tower won critical acclaim within the American architectural profession. The American Institute of Architects' New York chapter called the clock tower \"the most meritorous work of the year\" upon its completion. The writer Roberta Moudry observed that \"the tower appeared from [Madison Square Park] as an entity unto itself\", distinct from other tall structures nearby, and at the time of its construction, \"serve[d] as a timely large-scale public declaration of civic stature and ethical responsibility\". The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission described the original home office's design as doing \"much to establish Metropolitan Life in the eyes and the mind of the public.\" In a company history book written shortly after the building's completion, Metropolitan Life had characterized the structure as \"the most beautiful home office in the world\".\n\nMembers of the public also viewed the clock tower positively, with one anonymous reviewer calling the clock \"a reassuring melody to hear on a trustworthy schedule\". One newspaper columnist stated that when the clocks' hands were taken apart for cleaning in 1937, \"letters poured in, asking what went on\". On December 11, 1984, to celebrate the building's 75th anniversary, the United States Postal Service issued a pictorial cancellation that depicted the Metropolitan Life Tower, which was available only on that day.\n\nThe South Building's tower was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978, and a New York City designated landmark in 1989. The \"Metropolitan Life Home Office Complex\", which includes the tower and the adjacent North Building, was added to the National Register on January 19, 1996. The east wing was not included in the Home Office Complex designation, nor in any of the other landmark designations, due to its relatively recent construction.\n\n\n\n"}

Other members included Steve White, Justin Welch, Steven Walker (who went on to play in the Auteurs and Modern English), Matt Wise, and Scott Kenny.\n\nTwo early EPs on Eve Recordings saw the band linked to the shoegazing scene, and to the Scene That Celebrates Itself, although a cover of \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" theme staked out their retro appeal.\n\nAround this time, the band were involved in several controversial incidents; including the handing out of backstage passes for groupies, and a string of apparently sexist proclamations to the music press of the time. The band later insisted that these incidents were merely ironic, and intended to poke fun at rock stars' posturing. Their debut album, \"Feverish\", was released on Paperhouse Records in 1993.\n\n'Feverish' is a 6-track compilation of the first two EVE Recordings EP's 'Translucent' & 'Superbaby', which was licensed to and released by the French label Danceteria in 1992.\n\nSpitfire were hailed as influential by many New wave of new wave bands, and regularly gigged with S*M*A*S*H and These Animal Men between 1994 and 1996. The Pitcher brothers were resident DJs at Brighton club The Basement, which with Camden's Good Mixer pub and Blow Up club was at the core of the pre-Britpop scene.\n\nIn 1994 a 3 track e.p 'Big Banger' was released on the Lowlife label. The line up now included the Pitcher brothers, Steve Burgan on guitar and Lawrence Shaft on drums. UK tours followed and a live session featured on BBC Radio 1's Mark Radcliffe show.\n\nA second album \"Electric Colour Climax\", followed on Lowlife Records in 1996. The band again courted controversy, with a sleeve featuring a retro pornographic image, found at London's Toe Rag Studies where the band had recorded the album on vintage recording equipment in five days.\n\nThe band drifted apart around 1999, with the Pitcher brothers forming Cheetah.

It is a robust and relatively large member of the skink family (Scincidae) that tends to rely on camouflage and bluff as its primary means of defence. However, if cornered or molested, it can put on an impressive and effective defensive display. If further molested, it will bite as a last resort and although the bite can be painful due to its powerful jaws, the teeth are blunt and generally do not break the skin. The species is harmless, as are all skinks and inoffensive by nature, often being kept as a pet due to its appealing, inquisitive nature and readiness to become tame. They usually adapt well to captivity, eating a wide range of readily available foods.\n\nThe lizard is about 14 to 20 inches (35 to 50 cm) long, and is found in wet and dry sclerophyll forests, montane woodlands and coastal heathlands. It is an omnivore with a diet consisting of a variety of insects, snails, carrion, wildflowers, native fruits and other vegetation like select leaves, and occasionally small vertebrates like mice or other young rodents if given the chance. The tail can be dropped (autotomy) when grasped by a predator (like most skinks), but this large skink is much less likely to do so than most other members of the skink family.\n\nThe species occurs in Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.\n\nThe blotched blue-tongued lizard usually emerges from brumation in early spring, which is the mating season. These large skinks are viviparous (give birth to live young), with the highland/alpine form giving birth to relatively larger and fewer young (about five) compared to the lowland form (about 11). The young are usually born in autumn, after a relatively long gestation period. They are also relatively long-lived (reliably reported up to 30 years in captivity) compared to many of the smaller skink species. They have adapted well to some rural and urban areas, where they can be found living on farms and in gardens where they are an asset, as they eat pests such as snails, slugs, and occasionally rodents.\n\nThe blotched blue-tongued lizard is among the animals identified from the Pleistocene fossil sites of the Naracoorte Caves National Park.\n\n\n"}

Lying south of the Lake Tai, it borders Jiaxing to the east, Hangzhou to the south, and the provinces of Anhui and Jiangsu to the west and north respectively.\nAt the 2010 census, its population was 2,893,542 inhabitants, of whom 757,165 lived in the built-up (\"or metro\") area made of Wuxing District as Nanxun District is not being conurbated yet.\n\nHuzhou, in its general aspect, is in the center of the Yangtze River Delta Economic Area, with the city center south of Lake Tai (the third largest freshwater lake in China). There are transportation links to the provincial capital of Hangzhou away in the south, Jiangsu and Anhui province in the west, and the metropolitan municipality of Shanghai to the east.\n\nFlowing quietly through the city is the Changxing-Huzhou-Shanghai Channel. It is also referred to as the \"Eastern Rhine River\" for the continuous barge transportation that goes on similarly to the more internationally known Rhine River in Germany.\n\nThe State Way 318 passes through Huzhou in an east-west direction and the State Way 104 in a north-south direction; the Nanjing-Huzhou-Hangzhou toll expressway and Shanghai-Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui toll expressway offers convenient access to major areas in the region.\n\nThe Express Xuancheng–Hangzhou Railway Station is located west of the city center. This railway line is part of the \"secondary tunnel\" in eastern China.\n\nThe prefecture-level city of Huzhou administers six county-level divisions, including one economic development zone and two districts and three counties.\n\nThese are further divided into 66 township-level divisions, including 50 towns, 10 townships and six subdistricts.\n\n\n\nHuzhou is headquarters of the 1st Group Army of the People's Liberation Army, one of the three group armies that comprise the Nanjing Military Region responsible for the defense of China's eastern coast.\n\n\nThe Lotus Garden (pinyin \"Lianhua Zhuang\") is a pleasure garden located 20 minutes south on foot from the city center of Huzhou. The main attractions of the garden include the Lotus flowers that bloom seasonally in the three lake system, a large Koi pond near the north gate, a karaoke veranda and amusement rides for children. Also, barge-themed pedal boats are available for leisure boating. The garden was built in 1924 with stone footpaths and bridges bordering and crossing over the lake system. A variety of structures inhabit the 300 meter squared grounds including two halls, six pavilions, and two inlets, all following the harmonious design of traditional Chinese architecture. Sign posts describe local history and the halls maintain a Tea House where visitors may converse and take a break from the rays of the sun. A particular geological feature worth seeing are the ancient stones transferred from Lake Tai. Families pour into the garden on public vacation days while local people partake in Taiji exercise, or play card and Mahjong games every day, year round. The garden is open during daytime hours and admission is free of charge.\n\nXiangwang Park (Southwest Gate Park) is a more recent addition to Huzhou's collection of historical parks. It was built in 2009 and located at Chen Bei Bridge. The park includes the rebuilt wooden gate outpost on top of the original defensive wall. A visitor ship is permanently moored one kilometer west of the historic gate.\n\nLong Island Park (pinyin \"Changdao Gongyuan\") is a new park just north of the city center on an island stretching north-south in the middle of Xitiao River. It was built in 2009. The park is open every day. A popular destination for local residents after dinner, the lengthy route becomes something of a promenade for people taking their daily constitutional through the form of a jog or, more commonly, a walk. There is a small golf park, a historical pool, and a garden available to visitors.\n\nHuzhou is twinned with:\n\n\nHuzhou is well known as one of the birthplaces for silk cultivation. In 1958, a great number of silk, silk ribbon and uncarbonized tablets were found in the southern suburbs of Huzhou. Scientists from the Institute of Archaeology measured these silk products carefully and determined the age of the silk to date back 4700 years. Now, these silk pieces have become the greatest treasures of the Zhejiang Silk Museum.\nHuzhou silk has many desirable features, such as paleness in color, luster, flexibility, and roundness in shape. As a result, Huzhou silk has been respected and desired for a very long time. The history of Huzhou silk can be uncovered back to the time of the Warring States (474 BC –221 BC). By the time of the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420 AD – 589 AD), Huzhou silk had already been exported to more than ten countries. During the Tang dynasty (618 AD – 907 AD), Huzhou silk was chosen for an imperial tribute, thus marking the first prosperity in silk production. With the establishment of the Ming dynasty (1368 AD – 1644 AD), the residents living near Lake Tai entered the profitable textile industry, resulting in a larger workforce and a refinement of Huzhou silk products. Huzhou silk has won awards at World Fairs, and is desired by clothing and furnishing manufacturers overseas.\n\nHuzhou has a long history of manufacturing ink brushes, and it can be traced back to the Qin Dynasty. Huzhou's ink brush production and manufacture gained prominence in the Ming Dynasty (13th century). Since the late 20th century, Huzhou has been known as the \"Hometown of the Ink Brush\". Huzhou also holds an annual \"Huzhou Ink Brush Festival\", and the festival also has some memorial activities dedicated to Meng Tian - the inventor of ink brush pen.\nThe most famous brush pen workshop in Huzhou could be the Shanlian (), thus its brush pens are named Shanlian Hubi () in reverence of this workshop.\nShanlian is also a local place name, whose ancient name was Mengxi (). Meng Tian made brush pens there. \n\nThe now popular Huzhou style Wonton dish is known to be introduced by an ingenious man named Zhouji. It is said that in 1930, Mr. Zhouji saw how profitable Ding Lianfang's roadside restaurant (began in 1878) was by serving a noodle bowl with bean curd dumplings. As a result of this observation, Zhouji also opened a store to compete for the same clients. Soon after, Mr. Zhouji found that his roadside restaurant could not replicate his competitors profit and was forced to close. However, considering what his competitor did not sell, he rethought his plans. He opened a new roadside restaurant called \"Zhou Shengji's\". Unlike his first venture, this one made a profit. He sold a wonton bowl with flower dumplings filled with various ingredients. The dumplings could have pork, with your choice of mix such as celery, bamboo, or spinach. And Zhou Shenji's cooks continue to be very particular about the quality of dumpling they serve. They select all the raw materials very carefully, such as wheat flower, sesame, sesame oil, wine, sugar, salt and other spices that need to be added to create the flower dumpling shell. Furthermore, Zhouji invented a special process so that dumplings do not break up easily when boiled. Combined with a special sauce, the dumplings have a satisfying taste and thus are a very popular dish.\n\n\n"}

For a brief time, Beck left the band and was replaced by Randy Vanderbilt (Scarlet) on guitar and Jon Spencer (ex-Scarlet) on vocals. With this new vocalist and guitarist, Spitfire released a second EP, called \"The Slideshow Whiplash\", for Goodfellow Records. The band broke up in 2002.\n\nIn late 2005, Spitfire re-formed with new members. While the band had been broken up, Reeves had moved to New York City, leaving Beck and Raines as the only original members.

Companies attempting such maneuvers may thus find themselves insolvent, and in a position where they cannot resist continued takeover bids.

{"id": "1808802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808802", "title": "French classical music", "text": "French classical music\n\nFrench classical music began with the sacred music of the Roman Catholic Church, with written records predating the reign of Charlemagne. It includes all of the major genres of sacred and secular, instrumental and vocal music. French classical styles often have an identifiably national character, ranging from the clarity and precision of the music of the late Renaissance music to the sensitive and emotional Impressionistic styles of the early 20th century. Important French composers include Pérotin, Machaut, Dufay, Josquin des Prez, Lully, Charpentier, Couperin, Rameau, Leclair, Grétry, Méhul, Auber, Berlioz, Alkan, Gounod, Offenbach, Franck, Lalo, Saint-Saëns, Delibes, Bizet, Chabrier, Massenet, Widor, Fauré, d'Indy, Chausson, Debussy, Dukas, Vierne, Duruflé, Satie, Roussel, Hahn, Ravel, Honegger, Milhaud, Poulenc, Auric, Messiaen, Françaix, Dupré, Dutilleux, Boulez, Guillou, Grisey, and Murail.\n\nClassical music usually refers to music produced in, or rooted in the traditions of Western liturgical and secular music, encompassing a broad period from roughly the 9th century to present times. The central norms of this tradition became codified between approximately 1600 and 1900, which is known as the common practice period.\n\nItalian classical music, including music from France is largely distinguished from many other non-European and popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to prescribe to the performer the pitch, speed, meter, individual rhythms and exact execution of a piece of music. This leaves less room for practices, such as improvisation and \"ad libitum\" ornamentation, that are frequently heard in non-European art music (compare Indian classical music and Japanese traditional music), and popular music.\n\nDuring the early Christian era of the Middle Ages, sacred monophonic (only one voice) chant was the dominant form of music, followed by a sacred polyphonic (multi-voices) organum. By the thirteenth century, another polyphonic style called the motet became popular. During the Ars Nova era of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the trend towards writing polyphonic music extended to non-Church music. In the fifteenth century, more secular music emerged, such as the French chanson.\n\nIn the late sixteenth-century, composers attempted to recreate Greek drama using a style called monody. In the seventeenth century, Italian opera styles such as \"opera seria\", \"opera buffa\" were very important. This Italian opera was taken up in France, where Lully developed a French national opera style. In the seventeenth century, instrumental music developed a great deal, and vocal music was usually accompanied by a written bassline called the basso continuo. Instrumental works included keyboard suites, which were based on dance suites, sonatas, organ music, and music for small groups (trio sonatas) or orchestra (e.g., sinfonias and concerto grossos). Baroque music from the eighteenth century moved towards a simpler, lighter style of instrumental music. Later in the eighteenth century, the Classical style dominated, with the main forms being sonatas, symphonies, and string quartets.\n\nThe nineteenth century is often called the Romantic era. During this era, the symphony developed, and a new style of music called \"program music\" (music that tells a story) developed. Other types of music that became important in the nineteenth century were grand opera, small pieces for piano; piano sonatas, often with the exploration of new harmonic or tonal ideas. In the late Romantic era, the Austro-German tradition of Wagner dominated musical composition. Composers began exploring different, looser approaches to tonality (the key-centered-ness of a piece of music). During this era, French composers such as Debussy and Ravel developed a style called Impressionism, which emphasized tone \"colours\", and which used chords purely for their sound (as opposed to for their harmonic role).\n\nDuring the twentieth-century, composers took many different paths. Some composers looked backwards to the light, elegant Classical works, with the Neoclassicism of the Russian-French composer Stravinsky. Austro-German composers such as Schoenberg and Berg and used a tortured, dramatic style called Expressionism. The French composer Boulez abandoned the entire tonal (key-centered) tradition of Western music with a style called Serialism. Other composers explored electronic music (Stockhausen); chance-based or random (aleatoric) music and indeterminacy (Cage); and minimalism (Reich, Glass).\n"}

It is located across the street from the Ontario Legislative Building, and contains the offices of the Premier of Ontario and most cabinet ministers. The street address of Whitney Block is 99 Wellesley Street West, though the principal facade faces west towards Queen's Park Crescent and the Ontario Legislature. The building is linked to the legislature by a tunnel under the street, by a bridge to the Macdonald Block, and through there via another tunnel to the subway. The Modern Gothic-Art Deco structure was built in 1926 by architect F. R. Heakes and the tower was added in 1932. Whitney Block is faced with Queenston limestone. The facade is ornamented by repeated sequences of quatrefoils, and figures designed by Charles Adamson, which represent abstract ideals like justice, tolerance, wisdom and power, as well as more ordinary pursuits such a mining, forestry, labour, law, education and farming.\n\nAt its completion it was one of the tallest buildings in Toronto. It was originally known as the East Block, but it is now known as the Whitney Block in honour of former Premier James P. Whitney.\n\nWhile no longer used for office space, the tower remains as a distinctive feature of the building and contains one of the few operational hand cranked elevators remaining in Toronto.

His name is spelled \"Jaxson\" because Jacksonville, Florida, is often shortened to \"Jax.\" He is an anthropomorphic jaguar and is yellow with teal patches. He wears sunglasses, a Jaguars jersey, long shorts, and black and teal sneakers. The back of his jersey is typical: it reads \"Jaxson\" with his number, 00, but the front has a paw print. On certain occasions he wears other outfits, such as a large military field uniform when he was brought onto the field in a military jeep. Jaxson finds other creative ways to enter the stadium: using a zip wire to bungee jump off the stadium lights or sliding down a rope from the scoreboard. He is rarely seen without his motorized scooter and can sometimes be seen driving a golf cart.\n\nJaxson is known for his crazy antics. He is very interactive with the crowd and the Jaguars (if they're not too busy), and sometimes interacts with the opposing team's players as well. He often mocks and jokes with the other team's mascot, if they are present. These acts got him into trouble in 1998 and stemmed the changing of the NFL's mascot rules, and also caused him to calm up. However, Jaxson was still seen, by some, as a mascot that gets in the way during the game. After the October 22, 2007 game against Indianapolis, Colts President Bill Polian complained to the NFL, and Jaxson was reprimanded again. During the November 18, 2007 home game Jaxson spent a good portion of the game in a makeshift \"cage\", but was released for short periods of time so he could interact with fans and also to give him an opportunity to ride his scooter.\n\nAnother controversy arose during an online NFL mascot competition, where Raiders fans and Jaguars fans were to vote for their mascots. During the process, a loophole was found allowing individual users to vote tens of thousands of times, enabling the Jags and Raiders to get well over 1 million votes, disqualifying both mascots from the competition.\n\nJaxson appears at many events and around the Jacksonville community supporting various causes. He also participates in NFL and other mascot events such as the 2002 mascot convention that was held in New York City. Jaxson also contributes to the Jaguars' journal, provided by First Coast Community, which allows fans to post photos and includes journal entries from the mascot as well as the team members and Jacksonville Roar members (the Jaguars cheerleaders).\n\nIn recent years, Jaxson has been taking bigger risks, including making bungee jumping and zipline entrances from the EverBank Field light fixtures. On December 16, 2009, he ended up getting stuck during a zipline stunt and hung above the field by his feet for three minutes while crews tried to free him. His performer was not injured.\n\nJaxson's first appearance was on August 18, 1996 and had been played by Curtis Dvorak until his retirement in June 2015.\n\nThe mascot stirred further controversy, during the 2014 Ebola crisis, when he carried a sign reading \"Towels Carry Ebola\" along with a Terrible Towel from the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nOn May 23, 2020, Jaxson made a cameo appearance during the \"Stadium Stampede\" match of All Elite Wrestling's Double or Nothing pay-per-view (which was set inside TIAA Bank Field, with the rest of the show taking place at the neighboring Daily's Place), where Chris Jericho performed a \"Judas Effect\" on the mascot.\n\n"}
{"id": "1808847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808847", "title": "Volcán Barú", "text": "Volcán Barú\n\nThe Volcán Barú (also Volcán de Chiriquí) is an active stratovolcano and the tallest mountain in Panama, at high. It lies about 35 km off the border of Costa Rica. It is also the twelfth highest peak in Central America.\n\nDue to its height and the narrowness of the isthmus of Panama, it is possible (though relatively rare) to see both the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea from Volcán Barú's peak on a clear day.\n\nThe small town of Volcán at the base of Volcán Barú sits on the remnants of a huge lahar that appears to have breached the caldera. A small river has eroded the lahar exposing an ancient forest below dated to about 1000 years old (Stewart, pers. communication).\n\nVolcán Barú is surrounded by a fertile area of cool highlands drained by the Chiriquí Viejo and Caldera Rivers. The towns of Volcán and Cerro Punta can be found on its western side, while Boquete is on the eastern flank.\n\nThe occasional fall of hail or ice pellets has been reported on the summit, where the minimum temperature can be below 0 °C (32 °F) and the formation of frost is frequent during the dry season. The peak is host to a large installation of broadcast towers.\n\nDe Boer et al. were the first to show that El Barú volcano is active and part of the extension of the Central American Volcanic Arc in Panama. Further detailed work on the geochemistry of the lavas from El Barú and other volcanoes in Panama was completed by Defant et al. They substantiated, based on geochemistry, that the lavas were derived by subduction (calc-alkaline). Radiometric dates also showed that the volcanism falls into two groups that range from 20 million years to recent. They also showed that the youngest volcanism consists primarily of adakites (partial melts from the subducted slab) whereas the older volcanism is normal calc-alkaline lavas.\n\nIn 2006, an earthquake swarm was registered in the Volcán Barú area. This was not the first one; researchers cite at least three other seismic events of the same nature recorded in the recent past (1930, 1965, 1985).\n\nIn 2007, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with Panama's Science, Technology and Innovation Secretariat (SENACYT) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), published a study on different aspects of Volcán Barú. The 33-page report outlined potential hazard areas, rock composition, and areas affected by previous eruptions; there is evidence that during the last eruption, which occurred in the 16th century, the debris avalanche deposits covered a volume of 20–30 km³, reaching as far as the Pacific Ocean (the largest documented in Central America and nearly 10 times the area covered by the Mt. St. Helens debris avalanche in 1980).\n\nData collected at several locations from four previous eruptions which occurred during the last 1600 years indicate that a new eruption would last several years, putting at risk population and costly infrastructure in the areas surrounding the volcano. Typical events during such volcanic episodes include pyroclastic flows, super-heated gas clouds rapidly descending the volcano's east flank, conceivably reaching as far as Boquete, Alto Boquete, and the Caldera River, and fallout of ash and other particles ranging in size from dust to 1-meter blocks, known as tephra, causing fires, roof collapses, water contamination, crop damage and eye and lung irritation, especially among elders and infants. A third type of event, mud and debris flows, known as lahars, create landslides, obstruct rivers courses, and could have long-term effects in the zone. The severity of these events is directly related to the lava flows and their interaction with underground water deposits.\n\nA comprehensive set of maps is included with the study, clearly showing the most likely affected areas in Boquete, Volcán, Bambito and other towns in vicinity of the Volcán Barú. The study recommends local authorities should make the population aware of the potential risks, and create a response system in preparation for the eventual onset of an eruptive episode.\n\nThe volcano was declared Volcán Barú National Park in 1976, with an area of . It is a part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. Fauna include the black guan, black-and-white hawk-eagle, Underwood's water mouse, volcano junco, wrenthrush, and yellow-thighed finch. Over 250 species of birds have been identified within the park, and all five species of big cats live here as well. The national park protects a range of habitat, including humid montane forests, low humid montane forests, and montane rainforests.\n\nThe park's most popular hiking trail is the Sendero Los Quetzales (Los Quetzales Trail), which connects Boquete with Cerro Punta and wraps around the side of the volcano. The trail takes around 6 hours to hike. There is another trail to the top of the volcano, but this is long, steep and strenuous. You can, however, see both the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea from the summit on a clear day.\n\n\n"}

He is married to Alma Viator. By previous wives, Ben has a daughter, Rachel, and a son, Walker.\nSince the 1990s, Jones has run a chain of \"Cooter's museums\" across the U.S., dedicated to \"The Dukes of Hazzard\". \"Cooter's Place\" currently has locations in Tennessee and Virginia. Jones also monetizes his sitcom role through his band, Cooter's Garage Band, and events such as Hazzard Run and Cooter's Shenandoah Jamboree.\n\nBen Jones made his first TV appearance in the show \"Movin' On\" in 1975. He appeared in the movie \"Moon Runners\" in 1975, which was also directed by \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" director, Gy Waldron. Gy Waldron met with Jones after the movie was released to discuss creating \"The Dukes of Hazzard\". Jones was the first to audition for \"The Dukes of Hazzard\".\n\nCritics first predicted that the show 'would not last after the first commercial break'. The television show ran from 1979 to 1985 and garnered fans throughout the world.\n\nFollowing the end of \"The Dukes of Hazzard\", Jones entered the political arena as a Democrat. In 1986, he ran unsuccessfully against Pat Swindall for a seat in the United States House of Representatives from Georgia, garnering 47% of the vote, more than expected. He ran again in 1988, against Swindall, this time easily winning with 60% of the vote. Jones was narrowly re-elected in 1990, but in 1992, following redistricting which moved his home into another district, he was defeated in the Democratic primary election. In 1994, he ran against the then-House Minority Whip and soon-to-be House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Jones received 35% of the vote.\n\nJones has since returned to acting, as well as becoming a well-known writer, writing many political essays and a one-man play about Dizzy Dean in which he plays the famous \"Gashouse Gang\" pitcher and baseball announcer.\n\nIn 1998, he broke from most Democrats and called on President Bill Clinton to resign during his impeachment. Jones is still active in the Democratic Party. In 2002, he ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the United States House from Virginia against Republican incumbent Eric Cantor, thus becoming one of very few recent American politicians to seek elective office in more than one state.\n\nIn 2015, Jones announced his support of the Confederate flag, which can be seen on the exterior top of \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" signature car, the General Lee. His defense of the flag served as his response to Warner Bros.' decision to no longer manufacture any merchandise that features the flag, such as the General Lee, and the discontinuation of reruns of the show due to Dylann Roof's infamous reputation associated with the flag.\n\nThough Jones often refers to his Civil Rights activism in the 1960s, quotes Dr. Martin Luther King, claims a lifelong membership in the NAACP (an organization that \"...has been fighting against symbols that glorify the Confederacy...), and calls for a dialog between both sides of the Confederate-flag issue, he dismisses any association between the Confederate flag and slavery. Instead he focuses on his pride in the Confederate flag as a memorial to his ancestors who fought for the Confederacy in what he refers to as “The War of Northern Aggression.\" For example, in an editorial Jones wrote titled, “The Second War of Northern Aggression,” his only mention of slavery is in scare quotes, “Since the North won, the conventional wisdom there is usually simple: the North fought the Civil War to ‘free the slaves’ and to save the Union from the secessionist traitors of the South” He also attributes any association between the Confederate flag and slavery to a \"wave of political correctness\" and calls it a \"cultural cleansing.\"\n\n"}

He drives around in a stretch limo, which is richly described as luxurious, spacious and highly technical, filled with television screens and computer monitors, bulletproofed and floored with Carrara marble. It is also cork-lined to eliminate (although unsuccessfully, as Packer notes) the intrusion of street noise.\n\nPacker's voyage is obstructed by various traffic jams caused by a presidential visit to the city, a full-fledged anti-capitalist riot, and a funeral procession for a Sufi rap star. Along the way, the hero has several chance meetings with his wife and sexual encounters with other women.

Peter Wolfe of the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" called the book \"eerily brilliant\" and that it \"confirms Don DeLillo's place among [the best writers] elite.\" John Updike wrote in \"The New Yorker\" that \"DeLillo's fervent intelligence and his fastidious, edgy prose... weave halos of import around every event\". Walter Kirn criticized the novel in \"The New York Times\", writing \"Beware the novel of ideas, particularly when the ideas come first and all the novel stuff (like the story) comes second. \"Cosmopolis\" is an intellectual turkey shoot, sending up a succession of fat targets just in time for its author to aim and fire the rounds he loaded before he started writing.\" Also in the \"New York Times\", Michiko Kakutani described the novel as \"a major dud\", with a \"hokey, contrived storyline\".\n\nSeveral reviewers praised DeLillo's style, including David Kipen of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" who wrote \"DeLillo continues to think about the modern world in language and images as quizzically beautiful as any writer now going\".

The building is tall, with 32 usable floors. It is composed of the original 540-foot tower at the southeastern corner of the site, as well as a shorter annex wrapping around the original tower. \n\nThe original tower was erected on the site of the Stevens Building at 12–14 Wall Street and the Gillender Building at 16 Wall Street. It was built in 1910–1912 and was designed by Trowbridge & Livingston in the neoclassical style as the headquarters for Bankers Trust. An 25-story addition with Art Deco detailing, designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon, was constructed in 1931–1933 to replace three other structures. The interior of the building contained numerous amenities that were considered state-of-the-art at the time of its construction.\n\n14 Wall Street's tower incorporates a pyramidal roof inspired by the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. A notable building in Manhattan's skyline in the early 20th century, the building was featured prominently in Bankers Trust's early imagery. The building was designated a New York City landmark in 1997.\n\n14 Wall Street is located in the Financial District of Manhattan, bounded by Nassau Street to the east, Wall Street to the south, and Pine Street to the north. The lot has dimensions of on Wall Street, on Nassau Street, and on Pine Street. Nearby buildings include the Hanover National Building at 11 Nassau Street to the south, Federal Hall National Memorial (formerly the sub-Treasury building) at 26 Wall Street to the east, and the New York Stock Exchange Building to the south, and 23 Wall Street diagonally across to the southeast. The Broad Street station of the New York City Subway, serving the , is directly to the southeast.\n\nThe original building is located at the southeast corner of the site, which was previously occupied by the Stevens and Gillender buildings. In 1880, the Sampson family developed their lots along 12–14 Wall Street into the Stevens Building, which stood until 1910. Sixteen years later, Helen L. Gillender Asinari, owner of the adjoining six-story office building on the northeast corner of Wall and Nassau Streets, decided to replace it with the , 20-story Gillender Building, which was completed in 1897 and demolished in 1910. The two lots, combined, had a roughly square footprint measuring about . \n\nThe annex occupies the remainder of the plot and is L-shaped in plan. Prior to the construction of the annex, the land below it was occupied by three buildings. The seven-story Astor Building was located at 10–12 Wall Street, directly to the west of the original tower. The Hanover Bank Building at 5–11 Nassau Street, a 21-story building erected in 1912, was north of the original building and extended to Pine Street. The final building on the lot was 7 Pine Street, a 10-story building to the northwest of the original tower.\n\n14 Wall Street is tall with 32 usable above-ground floors and a seven-story pyramidal roof at its top, which contains seven storage levels. In addition, 14 Wall Street contains four basement levels; the topmost basement is partially raised above ground level. The original structure was designed by Trowbridge & Livingston for Bankers Trust, with additions between 1931 and 1933 by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon. \n\n14 Wall Street's \"granite-clad roof and its specifically Greek architectural motifs\", as described by architectural writer Sarah Landau, which were a departure from earlier designs. The architects wrote that the style had been chosen for its \"simplicity and grace, as well as its supreme dignity and seriousness\", which fit both the site and the building's use. Inspirations include the Erechtheion, the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, and \"ancient Macedonian prototypes\". \n\nThe original structure is a 39-story tower without any setbacks, composed of 32 stories topped by a seven-story roof. The concept behind the original structure's design was to place a pyramidal roof, similar to that of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus on top of a tower like Venice's St Mark's Campanile bell tower. Trowbridge wanted to \"enhanc[e] the beauty of the upper part of building by a loggia and a stone pyramid, in place of the usual flat or mansard roof.\" This was one of the first times a pyramidal roof had been used in a skyscraper (after only the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower); previous tall structures had been capped by a cupola, spire, or tempietto. \n\nThe rest of the building is surrounded by a 25-story annex, which wraps around the western and northern sides of the original tower. The Wall Street side has setbacks at the 15th, 22nd, and 25th floors and the Nassau Street side has a setback at the 23rd floor. The Pine Street side has a light court above the 11th story, which cuts through the center of that side.\n\nThe facade is clad with of New England granite from several quarries. The original tower is arranged into five sections: a base of 5 stories, a midsection of 21 stories, a top section of 6 stories (including the 32nd-story penthouse), and the roof. The base was originally four stories, but the present third floor was added in the 1931–1933 renovation. On each side are five window bays, each of which contain two windows per floor. The design of each side is largely identical, except that the western facade's midsection is made of brick rather than granite.\n\nBecause 14 Wall Street was surrounded on all sides by other skyscrapers, thereby limiting visibility of the lower section, the lower floors were designed with intricate detail. The upper basement and the first floor were arranged as a stylobate that supported a colonnade above it. The basement facade is smooth, while the first-floor facade consists of rusticated blocks. An entrance porch, with the address 16 Wall Street, faces the Wall Street side. A colonnade above it spanned the second through fourth floors. The colonnade consisted of Greek fluted columns, molded belt courses, and moldings, and was \"almost Puritanical in its simplicity\". The facade of the lower stories was rearranged slightly when the current third story was created, with new spandrel panels being added to separate the double-height windows that formerly spanned the double-height second story. The fifth story is the topmost story of the base and has a deep cornice at the top.\n\nThe mid-section begins at the sixth story and rises through the 26th story. It is mostly faced in buff-colored granite with slightly projecting vertical piers separating each bay, except at the corners, which have grooves that make them appear as though they were panels. There is a band course above the sixth floor but there is otherwise no horizontal ornamentation. On the 27th through 29th stories, the north, east, and south facades are set back behind colonnades, while the west facade extends outward to the columns of the colonnade. Rectangular windows are located on the 30th and 31st stories, with a cornice between the stories. The 32nd floor is slightly set back, with a molded cornice at its top.\n\nThe roof is made of massive granite blocks and measures tall, with a base square. There are 24 steps between the bottom and top of the roof. Smoke is ventilated from openings at the top of the roof, giving it a pyramid-like appearance. Inside the roof are more than 20 storage rooms.\n\nThe annex's facade is made of granite at the base and limestone on the upper stories. It was designed so that it would be in deference to the \"solid and robust architecture\" of the original building. The facade of the annex is arranged in two styles. The Wall Street facade contains setbacks at lower stories, and the window arrangement is aligned with that of the original building. The base consists of four stories. Like the original tower, the first floor is rusticated and the second through fourth floors contain a colonnade. On upper stories, wide piers divide each bay and narrow piers divide each window. The spandrels between each row of windows are decorated aluminum panels.\n\nThe Pine Street and Nassau Street facades are designed to be more modern with motifs in the Modern Classic and Art Deco styles. Due to variations in the lot lines on the annex's site, the annex projects further onto the street than did the original building. In addition to an entrance at the center of the annex's Nassau Street side, there are service entrances on Pine Street. The annex facades contain carved ornament, curved piers at the base, wrought-iron gates and grilles, and an eagle sculpture above the entrance on Nassau Street. There are five window bays on Nassau Street and eleven on Pine Street; the bays each contain between one and three windows. The base is two stories tall, excluding the basement, which is partially visible as Nassau Street slopes downward from Pine Street toward Wall Street. The design of the upper stories' facade is similar to that on the Wall Street side.\n\nFor the foundation of 14 Wall Street, caissons were sunk around the site's perimeter, reaching to the layer of rock below the street. Concrete was then poured in between these caissons to create a watertight, cofferdam. The membrane was needed because the surrounding ground was filled with quicksand. Afterward, the lot was excavated, the Gillender Building's foundations were removed, and deep foundations were placed within the lot. Due to high pressure on the cofferdam, temporary timber trusses were used to brace the cofferdam. A pad of concrete, overlaid with waterproof-cement, was then placed at the bottom of the pit. The method was not only cheaper than the then-standard method of driving caissons down to bedrock, but also provided space for more basement floors. \n\nThe superstructure consists of of steel. The second floor does not contain any columns because of the elaborate network of heavy trusses used to support the outer walls. \"Unusually heavy bracing\" is also used to support the fourth floor. Otherwise, a standard girder-and-column steel structure is utilized within the building. Some of the largest columns are tall and carry loads of up to .\n\nThe builders ensured that 14 Wall Street would be constructed with fireproof material. Metal was used in place of the wood trim that was used for decoration in other buildings, and a sprinkler system was placed in the roof. Bankers Trust's offices occupied basement levels A and B, as well as the first through fourth stories. These offices were designed \"in a pure classic style\"; the metalwork in the offices was a light-colored bronze, while Italian marble lined the main banking spaces on the first and second floors. The tellers' counters inside the second-floor banking room were originally aligned with the positions of the windows. The fourth floor contained the board room. Three elevators connected the Bankers Trust office floors and rose only to the fourth floor. Unusually for buildings of the time, the lower portion of the shared elevator shaft was covered in marble, while the upper portion was plate glass. At the time of the building's opening, a magazine observed that the offices used modular equipment that could be moved easily in case the company needed to expand. Further, the floor surfaces were made of cork; each department had telephone service; and pneumatic tube systems made it easy to send papers between different departments.\n\nAt the center of the Wall Street side, a wide staircase led to the first floor. Initially, this was the main entrance to the Bankers Trust offices. When the building was expanded from 1931 to 1933, the former banking room on the first floor was converted into an officers' seating area, and the floor level was raised to harmonize with the new extension. The double-height second story was divided into two stories, and the third story was created. The new addition, with the address 16 Wall Street, contained a T-shaped banking room covering , with \"a forest of squared-off, trunk-like columns clad in Oregon myrtle\". The new banking room's coved ceiling was tall.\n\nIn two of the four basement floors was placed \"the strongest vault in the world\", measuring two stories high and inside. The vault walls were thick, with of concrete and of \"shock and drill-proof steel\". This would prevent both standard explosives and oxyacetylene cutters from penetrating the vault. The columns and beams that reinforce the vault are so strong that \"a shock sufficient to disturb the vault would bring the building down in ruins upon it\". Inside, the vault was split into numerous aisles with combination locks; each safe in the vault required two officers to open.\n\nThe remaining stories were rented to various tenants. When the building first opened, entry to these floors was via an entrance on the western portion of the Wall Street facade, where a passageway linked to the Hanover Bank Building to the north. During the 1931–1933 expansion, a new entrance was built on Pine Street. A system of eleven elevators connected the lobby to the rental floors, consisting of five \"express\" elevators, five \"local\" elevators, and one \"relief\" elevator. The \"express\" elevators ran nonstop from the lobby to serve the upper floors while the \"local\" elevators served the lower floors and the \"relief\" elevators served all floors. There was an additional elevator serving the 30th through 38th floors. These stories contained floor surfaces made of concrete; walls of marble, plaster, and terracotta; and doors, window sash, and trim made of metal but finished to look like mahogany. A continuous 531-step staircase runs from the third floor to the 29th floor.\n\nOn the 32nd floor, the highest story below the roof, was once an apartment that J. P. Morgan had an option to occupy. He chose not to pursue the option due to antitrust proceedings ongoing against Bankers Trust at the time of the building's completion. \"The New York Times\" reported at the building's 1912 opening that $250,000 had been spent on \"teakwood furniture, priceless rugs, luxurious baths, and a private observation balcony\", though it was \"entirely devoid of furniture\". Christopher Gray, an architectural critic for the \"Times\", wrote in 2007 that there had been unsubstantiated rumors that Morgan used the apartment as a private getaway. In 1997, the 32nd floor was converted into an upscale French restaurant called The 14 Wall Street, which closed in early 2006.\n\nBankers Trust was founded in 1903 when a number of commercial banks needed a vehicle to enter the trusts and estates market. The company originally was located at Liberty and Washington Streets, with eight staff working in two basement rooms. The Bankers Trust ultimately acquired space in the Gillender Building, having been induced to move there because of the proximity of the New York Stock Exchange. The company, with J. P. Morgan on the board, grew rapidly and intended to land itself permanently in the \"vortex of America's financial life\".\n\nDuring the latter part of the decade, financial institutions such as the Bank of Montreal, the Fourth National Bank, and the Germania Life Insurance Company acquired properties on Wall and Nassau Streets. Bankers Trust started to negotiate the purchase of the Gillender Building in April 1909. However, it was the adjacent seven-story Stevens Building that Bankers Trust acquired first; that July, the trust leased the Stevens Building for 84 years at a cost of $1.5 million. At the time, the press reported that Bankers Trust would erect a 16-story office building wrapping around the Gillender Building. George B. Post, hired as a \"professional advisor\", proposed the new building as an L-shaped structure. \n\nIn November, Bankers Trust finalized an agreement to buy the Gillender Building from Helen Gillender. The next month, the Manhattan Trust Company acquired the Gillender Building for $1.5 million (), then a record amount for land in New York City. Manhattan Trust then resold the Gillender Building to Bankers Trust for $1.25 million (), although Manhattan Trust retained long-term lease rights for the ground floor as well as various other spaces. According to \"The New York Times\", Manhattan Trust and Bankers Trust had colluded to acquire the Gillender Building. During this time, Bankers Trust acquired a majority share in the Guaranty Trust Company; although the latter remained in its old headquarters, the same people served on both companies' boards of directors. Bankers Trust and the Mercantile Trust Company also merged, but because Mercantile Trust's headquarters burned in a January 1912 fire, this affected planning for the new building. Bankers Trust absorbed Manhattan Trust in February 1912: both companies had been owned by Morgan, and the proximity of the companies' spaces was cited as a reason for the merger.\n\nTo maximize land utilization, Bankers Trust desired to build a structure taller than either the Gillender or Stevens buildings. To \"obtain the very best results\" for the design, in 1909, Bankers Trust requested plans from four architects and architecture firms: Carrère and Hastings, Francis H. Kimball, Trowbridge and Livingston, and Warren and Wetmore. Ultimately, Trowbridge and Livingston's bid was accepted. The firm submitted plans for 14 Wall Street to the New York City Department of Buildings on April 20, 1910.\n\nThe first stage of construction commenced in April 1910 with the demolition of the Gillender Building, which \"The New York Times\" claimed to be the first skyscraper that was demolished to make way for a taller skyscraper. Demolition of the Stevens Building started the same month, and both buildings had been demolished by June 1910. After the site had been cleared, foundation work was started. Foundational work was stymied due to the quicksand in the ground, as well as the presence of redundant supports underneath the Gillender Building's site and the proximity of other buildings. Steel superstructure construction commenced after foundational work was completed in November 1910. Facade work commenced in February 1911, with contractor Marc Eidlitz & Son erecting the facade at a rate of three-and-a-half stories per week. The stonework was completed by September 15, 1911, except for the pyramid, for which there had been a minor change in design. \n\nThe basements and the three lower floors were to contain the headquarters of Bankers Trust, although its main operations would be housed elsewhere in less expensive offices. Most of the upper floors were slated to be rented to other companies. By May 1911, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that \"a large amount of office space\" had already been rented in the building. Asking rates for rental space was , equivalent to in ; this rate was higher than in other buildings in the area due to 14 Wall Street's proximity to the New York Stock Exchange. That November, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that the building was 65% rented. In April 1912, a month before the building's opening, a parachutist jumped from the 32nd floor of 14 Wall Street, landing on the roof of 26 Wall Street. \n\n14 Wall Street was officially opened on May 20, 1912, at which point it was 85% rented. J.P. Morgan & Co. had originally planned to move into 14 Wall Street, with Morgan occupying the 32nd-story apartment. After Bankers Trust was investigated by the U.S. Congress's Pujo Committee for monopolistic practices, these plans were canceled and J.P. Morgan & Co. built another structure to the southeast at 23 Wall Street. By 1917, Bankers Trust had become a full-service bank, and one of the country's wealthiest financial institutions. Bankers Trust, having rented out the upper floors, found their existing space to be inadequate by the 1920s, with more than four times as many staff as in 1912. As a result, the company took up space in the Astor and Hanover Bank buildings.\n\nBankers Trust began land acquisition in 1919, acquiring the Astor Building that June and the building at 7 Pine Street two months later. The Hanover Bank Building was not acquired until 1929, a decade later. By that time, Bankers Trust owned the eastern half of the block bounded by Broadway and Wall, Pine, and Nassau Streets. Architect Richmond Shreve described the situation as \"[falling] short of a true expression of the [company's] position\". In January 1931, Bankers Trust announced plans for the new structure, which would cost $5.5 million. Shreve's firm, Shreve, Lamb & Harmon, was hired to construct the annex.\n\nStaff at 14 Wall Street were moved to a temporary location when work began in May 1931, and the Hanover Bank, Astor, and 7 Pine Street buildings were subsequently razed. That November, the builders implemented two 5-hour daily shifts for workers instead of a single eight-hour shift, doubling the number of jobs for workers as well as increasing daily productivity. The new 25-story annex was completed in 1932 and the staff moved back into 14 Wall Street. The old building was also renovated with the addition of the third floor and the relocation of the main entrances. These renovations were completed in March 1933. The following month, Bankers Trust officially opened the annex and started moving into seven stories of the annex. The project tripled 14 Wall Street's rentable area. \n\nIn January 1934, the First National Bank of New York (now Citibank) filed a lawsuit against Bankers Trust and the project contractors, alleging that the excavations had damaged its adjoining building at Broadway and Wall Street. Of the $881,500 that the First National Bank sought in damages, it was awarded about a quarter of that amount. That April, Bankers Trust was released from all liability for any damage caused during construction.\n\nThe Bankers Trust Company had assets of $1 billion by 1935. In a sign of the company's financial stability, in 1943, Bankers Trust bought the land under 14 Wall Street from the Sampson family, whose Stevens Building had been demolished to make way for the original tower. The building was outfitted with a modern air-conditioning system in 1955. During this era, the bank continued to grow through mergers. The bank's second headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, at 280 Park Avenue, opened in 1962, though Bankers Trust retained occupancy at 14 Wall Street. When One Bankers Trust Plaza was completed in 1974, more employees were relocated out of 14 Wall Street and four other locations. Afterward, the eighth through 23rd floors of the Bankers Trust Building were vacant, representing , though these floors were gradually rented to other tenants.\n\nBankers Trust retained ownership of 14 Wall Street until 1987, when the building was sold to 14 Wall Street Associates, who subsequently sold the building to 14 Wall Street Realty in 1991 and to General Electric Investment in 1992. After buying 14 Wall Street, General Electric Investment started to renovate the building for $7 million. Though Bankers Trust retained a lease through the building until 2004, with an option to cancel in 1995, the company vacated the space earlier, in 1992. Manufacturers Hanover and the Chemical Bank then occupied the space that Bankers Trust had formerly used.\n\nThe New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated 14 Wall Street as an official city landmark in January 1997, and Boston Properties agreed to buy 14 Wall Street for $320 million that August. The tenant of the annex's banking room, Chase Bank, donated the space to the Skyscraper Museum for one year starting in 1998. During this time, the museum held an exhibition on the Empire State Building within the space. An investment group led by Laurence Gluck and Arthur Wrubel bought 14 Wall Street from General Electric Investment in 1999.\n\nGluck had sole ownership of 14 Wall Street by 2004, and the next year, Leviev Boymelgreen bought the building from Gluck for $215 million. Initially, the new owners wanted to convert the entire building from offices into luxury condominiums, but in 2006, dropped the plan for residential conversion. Instead, Leviev Boymelgreen ultimately converted the lower stories to condos. Early the following year, Leviev Boymelgreen agreed to sell the property to Cushman & Wakefield for $325 million. Ultimately, 14 Wall Street was purchased by the Carlyle Group and Capstone Equities, who planned to renovate the building for $50 million, including $5 million for the restoration of the lobby. Five years later, majority control of the building was sold for $303 million in cash to Alexander Rovt, a Ukrainian fertilizer tycoon who paid off the building's outstanding debt as part of the deal. At the time of the purchase, it had of vacant space, and three potential tenants were in discussion to lease about two-thirds of that amount. After $60 million of renovations, the building was 90% leased by early 2016. Cushman & Wakefield handled leasing for 14 Wall Street until it was replaced by the CBRE Group in 2017.\n\n\nAt the time of its completion, 14 Wall Street was the world's tallest bank building and the city's third- or fourth-tallest skyscraper. 14 Wall Street and the nearby Singer Tower, as viewed from Manhattan's waterfront, resembled \"the posts of the gigantic 'Gateway of New York.'\" The building was seen as a symbol of the future. During the early 20th century, Bankers Trust used imagery of 14 Wall Street in its advertising to depict it as a \"tower of strength\". This iconography persisted even after the annex was constructed. 14 Wall Street's likeness became synonymous with capitalism and Wall Street, having been shown in Berenice Abbott's photos as well as the 1921 documentary film \"Manhatta,\" and Bankers Trust sent a miniature model of the building to the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in 1915. Christopher Gray said that the massive height of 14 Wall Street posed a sharp contrast to the one-story 23 Wall Street, diagonally across Wall and Broad Streets, though both were designed by Trowbridge & Livingston and occupied by J.P. Morgan.\n\n14 Wall Street's pyramidal roof inspired the design of several other buildings. Its completion was described as the \"beginning of a vogue for the use of a temple or mausoleum\" at the top of skyscrapers, utilizing enhanced details or a full depiction of a temple. \"Architecture\" magazine projected that such a roof \"will be used a great many times more\". Towers inspired by 14 Wall Street's design include 26 Broadway and the more contemporary 60 Wall Street in the Financial District; the Metropolitan Tower in Chicago; and the Foshay Tower in Minneapolis.\n\n\n"}

Born in Philadelphia, Goldstein became interested in deejaying as a child after watching Herbie Hancock perform his 1983 single \"Rockit\". Goldstein developed a drug addiction as a teenager and was sent to the controversial rehabilitation center Straight, Incorporated. After he left the center, his drug problems became worse; he was addicted to crack cocaine for several years in his early twenties. After he attempted suicide in 1997, Goldstein became sober and later sponsored other addicts through Alcoholics Anonymous.\n\nGoldstein began deejaying in clubs in Los Angeles and joined the band Crazy Town in 1999. He left the group in 2001 and focused on a career as a solo DJ. After he began dating Nicole Richie in 2003, his career skyrocketed. In 2006, he accepted a $1 million contract to perform weekly at Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas strip and was also charging upwards of $10,000 for private events. In 2008, Goldstein and Travis Barker formed the duo TRV$DJAM. Barker and Goldstein were the only two survivors of the 2008 South Carolina Learjet 60 crash, which killed the other four people on board.\n\nGoldstein appeared as himself in several television series, contributed mixes to and portrayed a playable character in the video game \"DJ Hero\", and filmed a cameo appearance for \"Iron Man 2\". Goldstein hosted the 2009 MTV drug intervention series \"Gone Too Far\", and he appeared to be struggling with his addiction during filming. On August 28, 2009, he was found dead in his New York City apartment from a drug overdose. The DJ AM Memorial Fund, an organization designed to help people struggling with drug addiction, was launched in his memory by his sister, and \"Iron Man 2\", which was released in 2010, was dedicated to him.\n\nAdam Michael Goldstein was born on March 30, 1973, in Philadelphia. His parents, Andrea and Herbert – both of whom were Jewish – had been unable to conceive children naturally, and they had adopted Goldstein's older sister Lara a year before his birth. Goldstein's mother left her husband temporarily after she caught him having extramarital sex with another man. During this time she had an affair herself, and she found out she was pregnant with Adam after returning to her husband. While heavily pregnant, she discovered her husband had been adulterous a second time, and then she angrily disclosed to him that he was not the biological father of her baby.\n\nGoldstein stated that his father had verbally abused him. As an adult, he realized that this was likely due to resentment that Goldstein was not his biological son. Goldstein witnessed his father openly using cocaine and marijuana throughout his childhood. Goldstein said he began overeating as a way of dealing with anger and depression, becoming obese by the age of 10. He also began experimenting with alcohol when he was 11.\n\nAfter watching Herbie Hancock perform \"Rockit\" with Grand Mixer DXT at the 26th Annual Grammy Awards in 1984, Goldstein became obsessed with deejaying, and realized that it was what he wanted to do for a career. He attended the Quaker school Friends' Central. When he was 14, Herbert was incarcerated for committing bank fraud, and his mother subsequently moved to Los Angeles with Goldstein and his sister.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Goldstein associated with a crowd of heavy drug users. At 16, he approached his mother and asked for help with his drug problems. She arranged for him to attend Straight, Incorporated, a drug rehabilitation center that was later revealed to abuse patients. Goldstein disclosed that he was physically assaulted and spat on by staff while there. At one point, he escaped from the facility, but was arrested and brought back after being recognized at Knott's Berry Farm. While he was in rehab, his mother visited him and disclosed that Herbert was not his biological father, was homosexual, and was dying from HIV/AIDS. Goldstein said that after he received this news he \"exploded,\" attacking one of his counselors. He was eventually indicted and dismissed from rehab for his treatment of younger patients shortly before his 18th birthday. Herbert died the following year.\n\nAfter leaving rehab, Goldstein began attending raves and experimenting with MDMA and nitrous oxide. He also started deejaying; he broke into a friend's home while he was away for the weekend to practice on his turntables and eventually went on to practice freestyle deejaying every day for a whole summer. Goldstein started using crack cocaine by the age of 20. He said that taking the drug and deejaying were \"about all he did\" for the next four years of his life. He would often disappear from friends and family for days at a time. In 1997, he attempted suicide; the gun jammed in his mouth as he pulled the trigger. Shortly afterwards, a friend encouraged Goldstein to become sober. He began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, avoided his friends who still took drugs, and dedicated himself to working as a DJ. Goldstein relapsed after 90 days, but subsequently restarted and completed the program. People who complete the AA program are encouraged to sponsor other addicts through the recovery process; Goldstein became a sponsor for several people.\n\nGoldstein's stage name, \"DJ AM\", stands for his first and middle names, Adam Michael. After playing for his friends and at private parties for some time, Goldstein got his first paying job as a DJ at an unlicensed club in Los Angeles at the age of 21, where he earned $40 and a six-pack of beer for a night's work. He worked there for two years. A visiting promoter, impressed with Goldstein's performance, offered him a deejaying job at the Hollywood club The Dragonfly. Goldstein met Shifty Shellshock through the nightclub scene, and he was asked to join the rap/rock group Crazy Town in 1999. He contributed to their 2000 hit \"Butterfly\", which reached number one in several countries. According to bandmates Shellshock and Epic Mazur, Goldstein was the group's only sober member. He quit in 2001 to escape the drug-related dysfunction plaguing the group.\n\nGoldstein's weight problems became progressively worse, despite years of dieting; in 2003, he weighed and underwent gastric bypass surgery. The surgery was effective, and he lost more than within a year. After he began dating actress Nicole Richie in 2003, Goldstein's DJ career skyrocketed. \"Us Weekly\" editor Janice Min said that he was talented, but that the thing that set him apart from other deejays was that he dated Richie.\n\nAs a result of the relationship, Goldstein appeared in a 2005 episode of \"Punk'd\", where Richie was the subject of a practical joke, and that same year he featured in an episode of \"The Simple Life\", a reality TV show focusing on Richie and Paris Hilton. Goldstein and Richie announced their engagement in February 2005, but broke up in late 2006. Goldstein was a guest DJ on an episode of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" in May 2006. He was an avid sneakerhead, owning more than 1,000 pairs of sneakers by 2007. This led to him being offered a cameo as himself purchasing a pair in the 2006 TV series \"Entourage\" episode \"What About Bob?\". That same year, Goldstein also began working at Caesars Palace, becoming the resident DJ of their nightclub Pure. He was contracted to the club for the year for $1 million, which was considered to be an unprecedented amount for a DJ at the time. By 2007, he was also being paid between $10,000 and $25,000 per event as a solo DJ. Goldstein scratched on albums for Papa Roach, Will Smith, and Babyface. He played at private events for celebrities including Jennifer Lopez, Ben Stiller, and Leonardo DiCaprio. Goldstein dated singer Mandy Moore for two months in 2007 and remained close friends with her after separating. Later in 2007, he was romantically involved with model Jessica Stam.\n\nIn June 2008, Goldstein and Travis Barker began collaborating under the name TRV$DJAM. They performed at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards on September 7, 2008. On September 19, after performing at a college event, he and Barker were aboard a Learjet 60 when it crashed upon takeoff in Columbia, South Carolina. The crash killed both crew members and the other two passengers, a security guard and Barker's assistant, critically injuring Goldstein and Barker. Goldstein suffered third-degree burns to his arm and parts of his head. Both he and Barker were transported to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia. Moore flew to be by Goldstein's side, and the media reported that they were dating again. He was released on September 26, 2008, and was expected to make a full recovery. In December 2008, Goldstein filed a civil lawsuit against the plane's charter company, Learjet and Goodyear tires; the suit claimed negligence on the part of the pilots, and a manufacturing defect on part of the plane. He asked for damages for pain and suffering, mental anguish, disfigurement and loss of earnings. The lawsuit was settled by his estate in 2010, a year after his death.\n\nIn December 2008, MTV reported that DJ AM would be making his first appearance with Barker since the two survived the plane crash. The duo performed at New Year's Nation's Los Angeles 2008 New Year's Eve Party. That same month it was reported that Goldstein had split from Moore and was dating model Haley Wood. In April 2009, Goldstein left his position at Caesars Palace to become Rain Nightclub's regular Friday night DJ in the Palms Casino Resort, Las Vegas.\n\nGoldstein filmed a cameo for the movie \"Iron Man 2\" in June 2009, appearing as himself deejaying at the birthday party of Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.). Jon Favreau, the film's director, said that he was a fan of Goldstein; the cameo was supposed to be filmed in one day but the crew and Downey Jr. took a liking to Goldstein and his stay on set extended to approximately one week. He set up turntables and gave Favreau tips on how to DJ in between takes. Goldstein was involved with Activision's \"DJ Hero\" video game, contributing original mixes to and also appearing as a playable character. Goldstein and Barker performed at an Electronic Entertainment Expo event promoting the game in 2009.\n\nGoldstein was the host of \"Gone Too Far\", a drug intervention reality show for MTV. He had approached MTV in mid-2008, pitching the idea of a reality show that focused on his life to Tony DiSanto. DiSanto said that such shows were declining in popularity, and instead suggested a drug intervention show to which Goldstein agreed. The show was still in pre-production when Goldstein was injured in the plane crash. Following the crash, the show's producer Cheryl Sirulnick said she assumed the show would not go ahead, but Goldstein insisted on continuing. Eight episodes were filmed; three days before his death, Goldstein tweeted that filming had been completed.\n\nIn an interview with \"Glamour\" in 2008, Goldstein said that while he had been sober for nine years, he had to remind himself every day that he was still a drug addict, saying: \"At any given moment, I'm five seconds away from walking up to someone, grabbing their drink out of their hand and downing it. And if I do that, within a week, tops, I'll be smoking crack.\" Following the plane crash, Goldstein was prescribed painkillers and anti-anxiety medication. Celebrity doctor Drew Pinsky said it was those prescriptions which opened the \"floodgates\" to Goldstein's relapse. A friend of his reached the same conclusion, saying: \"I think the plane crash killed him, it just took a year for it to do it.\" As a result of the plane crash, Goldstein developed a fear of flying, and continued taking anxiety medication to help deal with the regular flights his lifestyle required.\n\nGoldstein was struggling with his former addiction during the filming of \"Gone Too Far\". He held a crack-pipe during one episode. BJ Hickman, an intervention expert who appeared in two episodes, noticed Goldstein \"had a moment\" holding the crack pipe, and later felt the need to call his sponsor. Goldstein later said of the experience: \"I realized my palms were sweaty and I was like, wait a minute, this is not smart for me to be holding this.\" In another episode, a police officer shows Goldstein confiscated drugs, including a bag of crack cocaine. Shortly thereafter, Goldstein leaves the building, informing the camera crew that he felt so tempted to consume the drugs that it was not safe for him to remain there.\n\nIn the weeks before his death, Goldstein's behavior had been erratic and he had been missing appointments. His manager and sponsor were both so concerned that they flew to New York to visit him two days before his death. Goldstein refused to see his manager, but allowed his sponsor into his apartment, consuming pills and smoking crack cocaine in front of him. He promised to check himself into a rehabilitation center following his scheduled gig at Rain Nightclub in Las Vegas that Friday. When he missed his flight and would not return phone calls, friends brought the police to his apartment.\n\nGoldstein was found dead in his New York City apartment on August 28, 2009. Drug paraphernalia, including a crack pipe and a bag of crack, were found nearby. The New York medical examiner subsequently determined that Goldstein's death was an accident caused by \"acute intoxication\" from a combination of cocaine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, lorazepam, clonazepam, alprazolam, diphenhydramine, and levamisole. Haley Wood denied rumors that an alleged recent separation from Goldstein had contributed to his relapse, saying that the couple had still been together at the time.\n\nAfter a memorial service, Goldstein was interred at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery, a Jewish cemetery near Los Angeles, on September 2, 2009. The following day, a memorial was held at the Hollywood Palladium. Among the hundreds of attendees were Nicole Richie, Travis Barker, Lindsay Lohan, Samantha Ronson, Eric Dane, Rebecca Gayheart, Scott Caan, and DJ Jazzy Jeff. Wood made an emotional speech at the service, describing Goldstein as her soulmate.\n\nThe scheduled debut air date for \"Gone Too Far\" had been October 5, 2009. After Goldstein's death, DiSanto acknowledged the possibility that placing Goldstein near other addicts helped contribute to his relapse. After debating whether to air the show in the wake of his death, MTV decided to debut it on October 12. His family stated: \"It is our hope through airing this show that people will get to see the side of Adam that we knew and loved. The decision to air the show has been difficult, but we do this with the profound belief that it will inspire others to seek help\". Favreau also consulted people close to Goldstein about whether the footage of him in \"Iron Man 2\" should still be used; they agreed unanimously it should remain. Favreau said that following his death, \"there was never any doubt\" the film would be dedicated to him.\n\nThe DJ AM Memorial Fund, an organization designed to help people struggling with drug addiction, was launched in his memory. In November 2009, 800 pairs of Goldstein's sneakers were listed on eBay to raise funds for the organization. In August 2010, the fund made a donation to the Los Angeles' Phoenix House Academy to help rehab patients develop musical talents. Goldstein's sister Lara, who founded the fund, died from cancer in May 2011. In August 2011, several DJs paid tribute to Goldstein at the Vanity Nightclub in the Las Vegas Hard Rock Casino, helping raise money for the fund. In May 2012, the eighth annual MusiCares benefit concert featured a special presentation commemorating the launch of the DJ AM Memorial Fund. Goldstein's mother, in conjunction with the fund, was reported to be assisting MusiCares in providing recovery services to addicts. Moby deejayed at the event in tribute to Goldstein.\n\nGoldstein posthumously won DJ of the Year at the 2009 BET Hip Hop Awards. In October 2009 he was depicted in the \"South Park\" episode \"Dead Celebrities\", along with other celebrities who died in mid-2009. Eminem, who nearly died from a methadone overdose in late 2007, paid tribute to Goldstein on the 2010 song \"Talkin' 2 Myself\", rapping: \"Rest in peace to DJ AM/'cause I know what it's like/I struggle with this shit every single day.\" On the cover of the 2011 Blink-182 album, \"Neighborhoods\", \"DJ AM\" can be seen written on one of the buildings, as a memorial. Wolfgang Gartner and will.i.am pay tribute to DJ AM in their 2011 single \"Forever,\" which includes a moment of silence for him. Macklemore mentions DJ AM in his 2016 song \"Drug Dealer,\" along with several other notable deaths from drug use.\n\nFootage of Goldstein and several other celebrities are featured in the documentary films \"Downtown Calling\" (2009), and \"Electric Daisy Carnival Experience\" (2011). A documentary film about Goldstein titled \"As I AM: The Life and Times of DJ AM\", was announced at the EDMbiz Conference on June 20, 2013. The film was directed by Kevin Kerslake and released in April 2015. Dennis Harvey of \"Variety\" called it an entertaining documentary, but thought, \"there are some notable gaps left in the pic's posthumous understanding of DJ AM ... as its flashy surface doesn't always help us to understand the pure artistic soul he's depicted as here.\"\n\nWith Crazy Town\n\nDJ Mixes\n\nAppears on\n\nProduction\n\nScratching\n\nRemixes\n\n"}

It is currently long and services the direct north of Montreal's Metropolitan Area. The A-25 has one toll bridge, which is the first modern toll in MMA and one of two overall in Quebec (after being joined by the A-30 toll bridge, which opened in 2012).\n\nA-25 begins at an interchange with Autoroute 20 and Route 132 in Longueuil and quickly enters the Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine Bridge-Tunnel into the east end of Montreal. It is the main north-south freeway in the east end of Montreal (actually northwest-southeast but perpendicular to the St. Lawrence River).\n\nBefore the Montreal-Laval Extension, a gap existed in A-25 north of the interchange with Autoroute 40. Instead it followed Boulevard Henri-Bourassa to Boulevard Pie-IX, both of which are principal urban arterial roads. Boulevard Pie-IX north of Boulevard Henri-Bourassa was used as a temporary section of Autoroute 25 across the Rivière-des-Prairies to Autoroute 440. From there, A-25 proceeded east with A-440, then continued north and east of Laval.\n\nThe designation of Autoroute Louis-H.-Lafontaine is named after Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine, a 19th-century Lower Canada leader of what was then the Province of Canada.\n\nA-25 is also part of the Trans-Canada Highway between the A-20 and A-40 interchanges.\n\nAutoroute 25 has been extended under a public-private partnership. The 7.2 km section of highway joins the southern part of Autoroute 25 at Boulevard Henri-Bourassa in Montreal's East end and the northern part at Laval's Autoroute 440. The $207-million project will save some $226 million for the province since a private consortium will assume any cost overruns. A toll bridge using a RFID transponder automatic payment system spans the Rivière des Prairies and costs transponder-owning motorists $3.20 per crossing at peak hours (6-9 AM and 3-6 PM) and $2.24 per crossing the rest of the day. An additional $5.34 in administration fees is charged for motorists without transponders. The road opened on May 21, 2011. The highway has six lanes (three in each direction), while the bridge features three lanes in each direction with one reserved for public transit.\n\nNow that the link between Montreal and Laval is complete, the temporary autoroute section connecting Boulevard Pie-IX to Autoroute 440 lost its A-25 designation. The new route designation for this section is Route 125.\n\nThe new span effectively joins the North Shore, Laval, Montreal, and the South Shore. In addition, the completion of Autoroute 30 also created under a public-private partnership, will help reduce traffic in the City of Montreal by offering a southern by-pass route.\n\nEnvironmental organizations have raised concerns that the highway extension will lead to an influx of automobiles entering Montreal and increase development pressure on agricultural land in Eastern Laval.\n\n"}

During a tense confrontation, the Slayer fights a losing battle against her formidable foe - but a mysterious protector watches over her from the shadows.\n\n\"Buffy\" scholar Rhonda V. Wilcox has written, \"It is unquestionably one of the most controversial episodes of \"Buffy\". It is also one of \"Buffy\" creator Joss Whedon's declared favorites.\".\n\nBuffy, patrolling, finds a vampire, engages, and then slays it. Angel has been watching her from behind some bushes. The college's Dean Guerrero orates for the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Anthropology building, and Xander is one of the construction workers. Xander begins to dig, but the ground suddenly caves out under him, and he drops into an old abandoned building. Accidentally and unnoticed, he frees the spirit, Hus, who wants revenge.\n\nBuffy, upset that her mother is going to be out of town for Thanksgiving, decides to cook her own Thanksgiving dinner and invite all her friends.\n\nCovered in a blanket and in terrible shape, Spike runs through the woods, trying to escape Riley and his Initiative team as they look for him.\n\nAnya arrives at Xander's to find him incredibly sick, and right away starts taking care of him.\n\nA green haze comes up from the old Mission and goes to the Cultural Center where some weapons are being kept. After the haze comes in contact with a knife, it turns into a large Native American man and kills the curator. Buffy and Willow later secretly investigate the murder, and wonder why the curator's body was missing an ear. They discover that a Chumash knife is missing.\n\nAfter Giles agrees to look up information on the Chumash people, and Buffy leaves, Angel appears from Giles's back room, having come to Sunnydale because his friend had a vision of Buffy in danger. Willow goes to get coffee and runs into Angel. He tells her he's just looking out for Buffy because she might be in trouble.\n\nStarving, Spike tries to get food from Harmony, but she threatens him with a stake and he leaves.\n\nWith only a blanket to protect him from the sun, Spike shows up at Giles's place, asking for help. Buffy is reluctant to give it, but after he offers inside information on the Initiative and Willow helps him explain that he can't bite anyone anymore, she allows him in.\n\nThe spirits attack Buffy, Giles, and Spike with arrows. Helplessly tied to a chair, all Spike can do is try to move out of the way as he gets hit with arrows. Willow, Xander, and Anya encounter Angel on their way back and they determine that the Chumash went after Buffy. Angel shows up and helps them out. Buffy cuts one of the Chumash with his own knife, and reaches the conclusion that their own weapons can kill them.\n\nHus turns into a large black bear, causing Spike to panic and knock his chair over. Buffy struggles with the bear and then stabs it. Hus and the other spirits disappear.\n\nAngel walks away without being seen by Buffy, and later the gang sits down to Thanksgiving dinner. Still tied to a chair, Spike sits with them and whines that he still hasn't been fed. Xander accidentally lets it slip that Angel was in town.\n\nWilcox writes, \"As Espenson says, 'The core of it was something Joss had wanted to do for a long time, which is have a dead Indian at Thanksgiving — a very poetic illustration, I think, that we do kind of live in this country by virtue of some very ugly conquest. And the next thing you know we had a very non-threatening bear and some funny syphilis.'(\"Writing\" 111).\"\n\nSally Eamons-Featherston comments that it stands out from other Buffy episodes for dealing with the issue of race. Its moral complexity is symbolised by Buffy's initial appearance in a black hat, traditionally the sign of a Western villain, and the program makes several references to the Western genre. The episode was however criticised for stereotyping Native Americans, particularly Chumashes, who actually had a complex culture, while the Chumash warrior is portrayed here as speaking in a highly cliched way.\n\n\"The A.V. Club\" called it \"an outrageously entertaining episode\", noting the many funny moments but also the complex moral debate over the Native American \"evil\". \"Persephone Magazine\" called it the start of a run of three excellent episodes, including \"Something Blue\" and \"Hush\".\n\n\n\n"}

The evening of February 16, 1991, after having dined at Mory's and attending a party at Sterling-Sheffield-Strathcona Hall, Prince left his friends and began walking to his off-campus apartment on Whitney Avenue to rest for lacrosse practice the next day. Prince was found lying on the steps of St. Mary's Church, New Haven on Hillhouse Avenue, dead of a bullet wound to the heart, in the early morning hours of February 17. He was the first Yale student killed on campus since the murder of Gary Stein during a robbery near Grove Street Cemetery in 1974.\n\nHis death stunned the campus, and more than 1,000 people attended his funeral in Washington, D.C., where Prince's brother Ted, a Yale graduate, gave the eulogy. There was a short term significant decline in applications to Yale which was directly attributed to the murder. Yale's president, Benno Schmidt, resigned the following year after a contentious six-year term filled with myriad problems, including badly deteriorated town-gown relations highlighted by Prince's murder.\n\nAfter the murder of Christian Prince, university administrators spent millions of dollars on security infrastructure. Emergency phones and improved lighting were installed; the university police department's size was expanded and a new security force was founded.\n\nIn May 1991, James Duncan Fleming was arrested for Prince's murder on a tip from one of his friends, Randy Fleming (no relation).\n\nRandy Fleming was questioned by police and gave the following account under oath: He and James wanted money to attend a rap performance and James suggested they \"stick up a cracker.\" James Fleming spotted Prince walking home and demanded his money at gunpoint. Prince handed over his wallet, whereupon James Fleming pistol-whipped him, said \"I ought to shoot this cracker\", and then fired his gun, fatally wounding Prince. James Fleming then dropped the wallet in his haste to escape.\n\nA year later, at James Fleming's trial, Randy Fleming recanted his original statements, claiming that the police had forced him to lie. The jury convicted James Fleming on conspiracy to rob Prince, acquitted him on the charge of first-degree murder, and failed to return a verdict on charges of felony murder and attempted robbery. A second jury acquitted James Fleming on the latter two charges in March 1993, and Fleming was sentenced to nine years in prison.\n"}
{"id": "1808950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808950", "title": "The Claws of Axos", "text": "The Claws of Axos\n\nThe Claws of Axos is the third serial of the eighth season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 13 March to 3 April 1971.\n\nIn the serial, set in Britain, the alien organism Axos spreads its Axonite particles across the Earth to allow itself to feed on all life on the planet.\n\nThe Axons land on Earth, desperately in need of fuel. They propose to exchange the miracle substance they call Axonite for some much needed energy. Axonite is a \"thinking\" molecule that can replicate any substance... or so they claim. As it turns out, the ship is a single organism called Axos whose purpose is to feed itself by draining all energy through the Axonite (which is just a part of itself), including the energy of every life form on Earth. The deception about the Axonite's beneficial properties was to facilitate the distribution of Axonite across the globe.\n\nMeanwhile, the Master, who was captured by Axos and used his knowledge of Earth as a bargaining chip for his life and freedom, escapes Axos and makes his way to the Third Doctor's TARDIS—his own having been seized by Axos. He plans to repair it to escape from Earth.\n\nAxos itself becomes interested in the Doctor's knowledge of time travel. It now plans to broaden its feeding base by travelling through time as well as space. The Doctor, realising this, plans to trick Axos into linking up its drive unit to his TARDIS so that he can send Axos into a perpetual time loop. After fooling the Master into completing the repairs on his TARDIS, the Doctor does just that. This results in every part of Axos dematerialising from Earth, including the Axon automatons and the Axonite.\n\nAt the end, with the Master having escaped in his own TARDIS during the confusion aboard Axos, the Doctor returns to Earth, but not of his own volition. The Time Lords have programmed the TARDIS to always return to Earth, making the Doctor, as he notes, \"some kind of a galactic yo-yo!\".\n\nIn late 1969, script editor Terrance Dicks contacted new writing duo Bob Baker and Dave Martin after reading a draft script they had sent around the BBC for another production, \"A Man's Life\". After offering the duo a seven-part story in November 1969 for \"Doctor Who\"s eighth season, Baker and Martin submitted some various storylines they had. Despite the storylines not being suitable for a serial, Dicks commissioned an opening episode from them on 1 December, but as part of a six-parter, rather than a seven-parter.\n\nThe original storyline for the serial was set in central London, with Battersea Power Station taking the place of Nuton Power Complex. However, the serial would have been too expensive to make on the budget available, and Dicks promptly told the writing pair to scale down the story. After going back to the storyline stage, they decided to set the story just outside London, and excluded the large action scenes set in space and around major landmarks in London.\n\nWorking titles for this story included \"Doctor Who and the Gift\", \"The Friendly Invasion\", \"The Axons\", and \"The Vampire from Space\". The last title was used through the production of the first two episodes, and was only changed by the time filming began on the third. The DVD release contains unused footage and cuts from the story that are packaged with the original title sequence—naming the story as \"The Vampire from Space\". The serial was envisaged to be a six-parter, but the concept of the storyline changed as development progressed.\n\nLocation shooting was planned to take place over five days in early 1971, starting on 4 January. Filming would take place in various locations around Kent, mainly Dungeness.\n\nDuring the location shooting of the scenes with the tramp, an overnight snow storm necessitated the creation of a line of dialogue in the programme to explain that the variations of weather from shot to shot in these scenes (filmed on various days but supposedly taking place within minutes of each other) are \"freak weather conditions\" as a result of Axos' arrival.\n\nA common myth about this story is that the colour-separation overlay (CSO) backgrounds were accidentally omitted in some of the car interior scenes, leaving the blue screen behind the characters. In reality, the blue is supposed to represent the sky. The differing shades of blue compared to the location exterior footage is the result of the shots' separate origins. This is contradicted by Paul Vanezis in an interview, in which he states \"I wouldn't put a background in and I'll tell you why they didn't put a background in there—it wasn't lit properly. There wasn't enough blue in it to key it, or yellow or green or whatever it was. It was shot wrong. It shouldn't have been shot in the studio and it shouldn't have been shot on xchrome. These days with modern technology you could easily key it... easily, but it wouldn't look right.\"\n\nFor reasons unexplained, the opening titles for this serial use the Second Doctor's version of the Doctor Who theme music as opposed to the Third Doctor's, as do \"The Mind of Evil\" and \"Terror of the Autons\". After this serial however, the theme reverts to the Pertwee standard.\n\nThe story includes interior scenes inside the TARDIS for the first time in the Pertwee era of the show. The configuration of the TARDIS set-up is unique for this adventure. The TARDIS monitor appears to be a circular screen embedded in one of the 'roundels' in the console room wall, rather than the traditional rectangular screen (this feature is seen again once, a year later, on the unique set built for \"The Time Monster\"). The doors of the console room do not open directly into the exterior as in all other adventures; instead they open into a corridor that features the 'roundel' motif. When the TARDIS interior reappears, in the next production (\"Colony in Space\"), both these features have been eliminated.\n\nBernard Holley had been last seen in \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\" (1967). He reprised his role of Axos in the 2011 audio play \"The Feast of Axos\". Peter Bathurst had previously played Hensell in \"The Power of the Daleks\" (1966). Tim Pigott-Smith would later play Marco in \"The Masque of Mandragora\" (1976). John Hicks who played the Axon Boy, also played one of the Quarks in \"The Dominators\" (1968).\n\nDavid J Howe and Stephen James Walker, in their 1998 book \"Doctor Who: The Television Companion\", described \"The Claws of Axos\" as \"a story that manages to combine an effective alien menace with some excellent location work to present a seamless tale of invasion by stealth\". Despite noting that some aspects were unoriginal, they felt that the story was overall \"highly imaginative and inventive\", with the Axons well realised in production. In 2009, Mark Braxton of \"Radio Times\" praised the action, production values, and Delgado's Master, though he noted that there were some \"lapses of judgement and quality\", and that he was not a fan of Dudley Simpson's electronic score. \"The A.V. Club\" reviewer Christopher Bahn wrote that the serial was \"entertaining and far from terrible\" and the Axons worked in terms of \"conceptual horror\", but the story suffered from \"the badly mishandled subplot about Chinn\" and Filer was a \"superfluous\" character who would have been better if a character who was already established was used in his place. DVD Talk's John Sinnott gave the serial four out of five stars, highlighting the \"tight\" four-part structure and the rapport between Pertwee and Delgado. He noted that the choice to make the villains \"more subtle and devious\" was a good departure and the Axons looked \"great\". Russell Lewin of \"SFX\" gave \"The Claws of Axos\" three out of five stars, describing the script as \"choppy\" and with production that struggled to realise its ideas. However, he noted that it would have looked modern when first broadcast and the last episode went in \"some interesting directions\". In 2010, the magazine named the comedic tramp stumbling upon the Axons as one of the silliest moments in \"Doctor Who\" history.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in April 1977. The novel restored material deleted from the TV version, including a \"meet-cute\" for Jo and Bill Filer, and a suggestion that the Doctor may be attempting to steal Axonite to repair the TARDIS. Pigbin Josh's distinctive dialogue has gone.\n\nThe original 625-line PAL videotapes of episodes two and three were wiped/destroyed, although some scenes from episode two were found to have survived on an unedited studio-recording block. In 1982, 525-line NTSC copies were returned from Canada.\n\nThe story was released on VHS in May 1992. It was later released on Region 2 DVD in April 2005, followed by Region 1 in November. For remastering purposes, the NTSC material was converted back to PAL using Reverse Standards Conversion. In episode two, PAL footage from the studio recording was inserted where possible, although this does result in some noticeable shifts in picture sharpness between scenes. The serial has been included for sale on iTunes since October 2008, and was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files (issue 97) in September 2012.\n\nA \"Special Edition\" DVD was released in October 2012, featuring much-improved picture restoration, especially of episodes two and three. The quality of the NTSC material was improved by combining colour from the Reverse Standards Conversion with geometrically-corrected picture information from the remastered black-and-white film recordings, and then applying VidFIRE to restore the smooth 'video look'. The special edition adds various new 'extras', including the complete, unedited version of the surviving studio recording.\n\n\n"}

During his time in Major League Baseball (MLB), LeCroy had the distinction of being the active player with the most plate appearances without a stolen base in his career.\n\nLeCroy is a 1994 graduate of Belton-Honea Path High School in Honea Path, South Carolina and attended Clemson University to pursue a degree in elementary education. While at Clemson, he was named to the 1996 U.S. Olympic Baseball Team and helped the team to a bronze medal after losing to both Cuba (gold medal) and Japan (silver medal) before defeating Nicaragua in the bronze medal game. In 1997, he was drafted as a catcher in the first round (50th overall) of the Major League Baseball Draft by the Minnesota Twins. Although challenged defensively behind the plate, averaging double-digit passed balls while throwing out less than 30 percent of potential base stealers, LeCroy put up superior power numbers in the minor leagues, hitting 101 home runs over five years in the Twins' system. In 1999, LeCroy again competed at the international level when he played for the United States at the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The United States took second place behind Cuba in a games made notable by the first time professional baseball players were allowed to compete in international games.\n\nLeCroy got his first taste of the majors in 2000 when he made the major league club out of spring training. From 2000–2002, LeCroy would split time between the Twins and their AAA teams, playing for the Salt Lake Buzz and later for the Edmonton Trappers after the Twins changed their minor league affiliate in 2001. Due to his struggles behind the plate, LeCroy also spent time at first base and designated hitter; totaling more games in the major leagues at the latter position than he did at first base and catcher combined. His peak years in the majors were 2003 (.287, 17 HR, 64 RBI in 107 games) and 2005 (.260, 17 HR, 50 RBI in 101 games). Despite his productive 2005 season, Minnesota chose not to resign LeCroy and he signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals.\n\nThough battling bone spurs in his throwing knee, LeCroy was asked to fill in during a May 25, 2006, game against the Houston Astros at a time when Washington's starting catcher, Brian Schneider and backup Wiki Gonzalez, were out with injuries. He was replaced by utilityman Robert Fick in the middle of the seventh inning after the Astros stole seven bases and LeCroy committed two catching errors. After the game, manager Frank Robinson shed tears during the press conference regarding his removal of Matt in the middle of the seventh inning, which is usually considered embarrassing. LeCroy was designated for assignment July 18, which he accepted, and spent the rest of the year playing for the New Orleans Zephyrs, then Washington's AAA affiliate team.\n\nLeCroy was signed to a minor league deal by the Twins in after turning down an offer from the Washington Nationals to manage one of their minor-league teams. LeCroy started the 2007 season as designated hitter playing for the Rochester Red Wings in the International League. He had his contract purchased by the major league club on September 9, 2007, when their fourth catcher José Morales went down with an injury, and finished the season with the Twins.\n\nLeCroy was outrighted to the minor leagues by the Twins on October 11, 2007, but he refused the assignment and became a free agent. On February 15, , LeCroy signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Oakland Athletics. On March 16, 2008, LeCroy was reassigned to minor league camp and asked the Athletics to grant his release, which they did. LeCroy then signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball in April 2008. LeCroy would play 94 games with Lancaster (hitting .326 with 22 HR and 83 RBI) before retiring at the end of the season.\n\nAs a member of the Twins, LeCroy became one of the few major leaguers to pinch hit a walk-off grand slam in a win over the Toronto Blue Jays. He was always a threat to hit a home run, and hit 60 in his career of limited at bats in 472 games over his eight-year major league career.\n\nIn November 2008, LeCroy was hired by the Nationals to manage the team's Class A affiliate, the Hagerstown Suns. In 2011, LeCroy was moved up to the High Single-A Carolina League when he was named as the manager of the Potomac Nationals. In 2012, he was named the Double A Harrisburg Senators manager. In November 2013, he was named the bullpen coach on new Nationals manager Matt Williams' coaching staff, replacing Jim Lett. He was fired with Williams and the entire coaching staff after the 2015 season, but was brought back for his second stint as manager of the Harrisburg Senators for the 2016 season.\n\nLeCroy and his wife Holly have five children, daughter Isabella (b. 2004), daughter Maggie (b. 2006), son Noah (b. 2008), and fraternal twins Max and Mabree (b. 2012).\n"}
{"id": "1808956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808956", "title": "Cessna 210", "text": "Cessna 210\n\nThe Cessna 210 Centurion is a six-seat, high-performance, retractable-gear, single-engine, high-wing general aviation aircraft which was first flown in January 1957 and produced by Cessna until 1986.\n\nThe early Cessna 210 (210 and 210A) had four seats with a Continental IO-470 engine of . It was essentially a Cessna 182B to which was added a retractable landing gear, swept tail, and a new wing. In 1961 the fuselage and wing were completely redesigned – the fuselage was made wider and deeper, and a third side window was added. The wing planform remained the same (constant 64\" chord from centerline to out, then straight taper to 44\" chord at 208 inches from centerline), but the semi-Fowler flaps (slotted, rear-moving) were extended outboard, from Wing Station 100 to Wing Station 122, which allowed a lower landing speed (FAA certification regulations state that a single-engined aircraft must have a flaps-down, power-off stall speed no greater than . To compensate for the reduced aileron span, the aileron profile was changed and its chord enlarged. The 1964 model 210D introduced a engine and two small child seats, set into the cavity which contained the mainwheels aft of the passengers.\n\nIn 1967 the model 210G introduced a cantilever wing replacing the strut-braced wing. Its planform changed to a constant taper from root chord to tip chord. In 1970 the 210K became the first full six-seat model. This was achieved by replacing the flat leaf-springs used for the retractable main landing gear struts (undercarriage) with tapered tubular steel struts of greater length. This allowed the tires to be nested farther to the rear of the fuselage, making room for the full-size rear seats. In 1979 the 210N model eliminated the folding doors which previously covered the two retracted main wheels. The tubular spring struts retract into shallow channels along the bottom of the fuselage and the wheels fit snugly in closed depressions on the underside of the fuselage. Some models featured de-icing boots as an option.\n\nThe aircraft was offered in a normally aspirated version, designated the model 210, as well as the turbocharged T210 and the pressurized P210 versions. The Centurion II was an option introduced in 1970 with improved avionics, and was available in both normally aspirated and turbocharged versions (Turbo Centurion II)\n\nOn 21 May 2012 the airworthiness authority responsible for the design, the US Federal Aviation Administration, issued an emergency Airworthiness Directive requiring 3,665 of the cantilever wing Cessna 210s to be inspected for cracks in the spar cap, wing spar and wing. Aircraft with more than 10,000 hours of airframe time were grounded immediately pending a visual inspection.\n\nOn 16 May 2019, a Cessna Model T210M airplane suffered an in-flight separation of the right wing. Preliminary investigations found cracking of the wing-spar carry-thru where fatigue began from a small corrosion pit on the lower surface of the carry-thru. Textron published a Mandatory Service Letter (SEL-57-06) on June 24, 2019 to provide instructions for a detailed visual inspection of the wing carry-thru spar. The FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive on 21 February 2020 mandating eddy current inspections of the carry-thru spar lower cap, corrective action if necessary, application of a protective coating and corrosion inhibiting compound, and reporting the inspection results to the FAA. Since it shared a common carry-thru design, the Cessna 177 Cardinal also received a similar Mandatory Service Letter (SELF-57-07) and an airworthiness concern from the FAA.\n\nThere are a wide range of modifications available for the Cessna 210, including:\n\nThe Cessna 210 was manufactured in 26 model variants. The C210, C210A-D, the Centurion C210E-H&J, Turbo Centurion T210F-H&J, the Centurion II C210K-N&R, the Turbo Centurion II T210K-N&R and the P210N&R. The 210N, T210N (turbocharged), and P210N (pressurized) versions were produced in the greatest quantity. The rarest and most expensive models were the T210R and P210R, which were produced only in small quantities in 1985-86.\n\nSeveral modifications and optional fittings are also available including different engine installations, wingtip tanks, speed brakes, STOL kits and gear door modifications.\n\nThe early strut-winged Cessna 210B was developed into a fixed-gear aircraft known as the Cessna 205. This spawned an entirely new family of Cessna aircraft including the 206 and the eight-seat 207.\n\n\n\nThe Cessna 210 is widely used by flight training schools, private operators, air taxi and commercial charter, and companies.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Though failing to break early in their tenure, the band has received acclaim for their albums \"Undoing Ruin\", \"Deliver Us\", and \"The Eternal Return\". \"Deliver Us\" debuted at number 110 on the \"Billboard\" album charts, with sales of 6,600, and their more recent effort \"The Eternal Return\" garnered them an even higher position in the \"Billboard\" album charts at number 104. Their latest album \"Godless Prophets & the Migrant Flora\" charted at 42 on the \"Billboard\" 200, a peak for the band, and it marked a stylistic shift in the band's discography.\n\nDarkest Hour was formed on September 23, 1995, and initially consisted of vocalist John Henry, guitarist Mike Schleibaum, drummer Matt Maben, and bassist Raul Mayorga.\n\nThe band released its first EP titled \"The Misanthrope\" in 1996 on a local label called Death Truck Records. In 1996, Darkest Hour cut a single titled \"Paths of Despair\" for East Coast Empire Records' \"The Harder They Come\" compilation. The song proceeds at a slower, grueling tempo in comparison to the up-beat tempo the band would come to be known for. In 1999, Darkest Hour released another EP titled \"The Prophecy Fulfilled\" on another label called Art Monk Construction.\n\nThe addition of second guitarist Fred Ziomek, bassist Billups Allen and drummer Ryan Parrish saw the band release their first full-length LP \"The Mark of the Judas\" in 2000, on the now-defunct M.I.A. Records.\n\n\"The Mark of the Judas\" was not widely promoted or distributed due to M.I.A. Records going out of business not long after the album's release.\n\nDespite the fact Darkest Hour were left without a label, the band garnered enough exposure to catch the attention of Victory Records. Their Victory debut \"So Sedated, So Secure\" was released on August 7, 2001. After the release of the album, Billups was replaced by Paul Burnette and Ziomek left the band. The album was re-issued by Victory on March 7, 2006, and featured new artwork, re-mixed audio, re-recorded vocals and additional tracks.\n\nThe band continued to tour, with Schleibaum's longtime friend Mike Garrity filling in on lead guitar duties. Eventually, they accepted Parrish's old friend Kris Norris as the new lead guitarist, and then began to write their next record.\n\nWhile Garrity was the guitarist, the band was arrested and jailed in Roland, Oklahoma for alleged marijuana charges, also for \"illegally imported\" beer and for an open beer can. They were fined $6000; Schleibaum was able to pay for himself, Burnette, and Garrity. Parrish and Henry had to stay for a couple of hours while the rest of the band had to get money to bail them out.\n\nTheir third release \"Hidden Hands of a Sadist Nation\" was released on May 20, 2003. Produced by well-renowned Swedish record producer Fredrik Nordström, the album signaled a shift from the band's previous metalcore style to a more melodic death metal style. As a result, the album gained strong mainstream attention, allowing the band to perform at Ozzfest 2004. Notably, the album contained political lyrics, with several songs criticizing American militarism post-September 11. The album was re-issued by Victory on July 13, 2004, with a bonus song and an additional DVD containing bonus material.\n\nDarkest Hour released their fourth full-length LP \"Undoing Ruin\" on June 28, 2005. The album was produced by Devin Townsend (Strapping Young Lad) at Greenhouse Studios in Vancouver. The album was the band's first to enter the \"Billboard\" 200 charts, debuting at No. 138 with first week sales of 8,484.\n\nIn the 2005 documentary \"\", Darkest Hour and a number of other bands including Shadows Fall, Lamb of God, Chimaira, Killswitch Engage, Unearth, and God Forbid are all listed under the category \"\" in the \"metal genealogy chart\".\n\nIn early 2007, the band was in Vancouver to work on their next record with Townsend. On March 7, 2007, Victory Records issued a press statement confirming the title of the album was \"Deliver Us\"; it was released on July 10.\n\nIn April 2008, Darkest Hour created a Washington Capitals fight song and a MySpace tribute page in support of the Capitals 2008 Stanley Cup playoffs run. The song \"A Thousand Words to Say but One\" was re-recorded with new lyrics and new solos into \"Let's Go Caps!\"\n\nIn September 2008, it was reported on Blabbermouth.net that Kris Norris had left the band and would be pursuing producing routes and possibly a new band. Not long after Kris Norris' departure, they found replacement Mike \"Lonestar\" Carrigan. With Lonestar officially on board the band is heading back into the studio to write & record with Producer Brian McTernan of Baltimore's Salad Days Studio.\n\nThe band's song \"Demon(s)\" is featured on the music game \"Guitar Hero 5\".\n\nIn March 2009, Darkest Hour began to record the new album, \"The Eternal Return\", just before co-headlining (along with Bleeding Through) the \"Thrash and Burn European Tour 2009\" in April and May. \"The Eternal Return\" was released on June 23, 2009, two weeks later than originally announced. Darkest Hour then went on to play the 2009 Summer Slaughter Tour. They supported Trivium for the first leg of the North American into the Mouth of Hell We March Tour.\n\nIn February 2010, Darkest Hour announced a new tour with Dillinger Escape Plan, Iwrestledabearonce, and Animals as Leaders.\n\nIn April 2010, Darkest Hour announced their signing to eOne Music after having been with Victory Records for a decade. The new album will be produced by Soilwork guitarist Peter Wichers, who helped pioneer Swedish melodic death metal and was a major influence on Darkest Hour. In an August press release, the band described the new material as \"the most emotional and melodic Darkest Hour album to date\" and also said it \"shares in that aggression with \"The Eternal Return\" and pushes Darkest Hour beyond the unknown.\"\n\nIn a new Metal Injection interview, Darkest Hour members Mike Schleibaum and Ryan Parrish revealed that the new record would be titled \"The Human Romance\", and it was officially released on February 22, 2011.\n\nOn January 13, 2011, A new song entitled \"Savor the Kill\" was released onto Noisecreep.\n\nOn December 22, 2011, Darkest Hour announced that they have parted ways with longtime drummer Ryan Parrish. He was replaced by Timothy Java from Dead To Fall.\n\nOn June 6, 2012, Darkest Hour announced that bassist Paul Burnette would be amicably leaving the band to join Iron Reagan. Aaron Deal, who had toured with Darkest Hour in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America was also announced as the new bassist.\n\nOn February 5, 2013 the band posted on Facebook that they are currently in the pre-production phase for the new record.\n\nOn April 16, 2013 the band announced that Travis Orbin, a seasoned touring musician and session drummer, would be joining the band and has been a part of the writing process of the untitled 8th studio album. On June 14, the band announced they had signed with Sumerian Records and implicated that they will be re-releasing \"The Mark of the Judas\" in late 2013, as well as working on a new record.\n\nDarkest Hour released their self-titled eighth studio album on August 5, 2014.\n\nThey played numerous special shows in various parts of the world in 2015 where they played Undoing Ruin in its entirety along with other fan favourite tracks, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its release in 2005.\n\nNo longer contractually obligated with any record label, in early 2016 Darkest Hour launched an IndieGoGo crowdfunding campaign to help pay for their upcoming ninth studio album as well as their first ever full-length live DVD, \"Live at the Black Cat 2015\", which was a special show where they celebrated the tenth anniversary of \"Undoing Ruin\". By March 14, 2016, the band had surpassed their US$50,000 goal by raising $67,707 from more than 1,200 fans. In their announcement of exceeding their goal, Darkest Hour said they could use the extra money earned to \"enhance the artwork, produce a music video (or two), enlist a possible guest musician (or two), hire a world class producer, and lastly help fund enhanced coverage of the making of / behind the scenes action.\"\n\nThe band recorded their ninth album at GodCity Studio with Kurt Ballou of Converge fame from September–October 2016. Commenting on the choice of producer, Schleibaum said, \"We want bring the energetic, raw, emotion we exude live to tape this time. We love to jam and riff all day and we feel Kurt [Ballou]'s unique style of producing will complement this perfectly. Also, it doesn't hurt that we completely respect and trust him as both a friend and musician, meaning we feel this monumental task of bringing another Darkest Hour album to life will rest well in his hands.\" While in the studio, the band announced they were aiming for a February 2017 release date and would be collaborating with former member Kris Norris on a few tracks. On working with his former band members, Norris commented: \"When the guys contacted me about the idea of a collaboration, I was excited because it has been a really long time since I've worked with them all. I've stayed in touch with them over the past years and it's really awesome to see that they keep trying new things on every album and growing musically.\"\n\nDarkest Hour will release their ninth studio album titled \"Godless Prophets & the Migrant Flora\" on March 10, 2017. Originally wanting to entirely self-fund and self-release the album, the band partnered with Southern Lord Records—who released the vinyl edition of their debut \"The Mark of the Judas\" in 2000—to complete the album's production and assist with distribution and marketing. Supporting tours will begin with a February–March 2017 US Tour with crossover thrash band Ringworm, Finnish grindcore band Rotten Sound, sludge metal band Tombs and Rivers of Nihil. Following the US tour the band will then do a UK and European tour from April.\n\nThe band's sound has been described as a blend of melodic death metal and metalcore.\n\nThey have stated that they're heavily influenced by Swedish death metal. Guitarist Kris Norris said in an interview, \"Well, put it this way – if you took an encyclopedia of metal, you could list just about every Scandinavian band as our influences! It’s not really any one particular band; we wouldn't say that we’re influenced by, say, In Flames or At The Gates, it’s every band from there.\"\n\nOther influences include: Dark Tranquillity, Minor Threat, Earth Crisis, Bad Brains, Black Flag, Government Issue, Scream, Shadows Fall, Bleeding Through, Eighteen Visions, Every Time I Die, Entombed, Dismember, Sacrilege, The Crown, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Iron Maiden, Dream Theater, Carcass, Arch Enemy, Killswitch Engage, Sick of it All, Dead Kennedys, Soilwork, Danzig, Venom, Exodus, Discharge, Cro-Mags, Integrity, Edge of Sanity, Mayhem, Emperor, Ulver, Testament, Death Angel, Pantera, and Cannibal Corpse.\n\nDarkest Hour's main guitar influences are: Zakk Wylde, Dimebag Darrell, James Hetfield, Dave Mustaine, and Scott Ian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He started for seven seasons in the NFL, playing for the Oakland Raiders and the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite only 15 rushing attempts in his career, Ritchie built a reputation with his blue collar work ethic as being one of the best blocking fullbacks in the NFL. \n\nAfter football, Ritchie co-hosted \"The Artie Lange Show\" alongside comedian Artie Lange from 2013 to 2014. He currently cohosts the midday show on Philadelphia sports radio station as a sidekick on WIP-FM with Joe “Mr Softee” DeCamara.\n\nRitchie attended Cumberland Valley High School near Carlisle, Pennsylvania from 1989 to 1993. He led his high school football team to the state championship in 1992.\n\nUpon graduation, Ritchie attended the University of Michigan as a freshman and sophomore. At Michigan, he played as a true freshman. During his career at Michigan, he rushed for 120 yards and caught two passes for 13 yards. Then in 1995 he transferred to Stanford University where he played as a junior and senior. At Stanford, he first started as an inside linebacker, but switched to fullback. He rushed 17 times for 95 yards and received nine passes for 80 yards and two touchdowns. He is a member of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity.\n\nRitchie was drafted in the third round (63rd overall) of the 1998 NFL Draft by the Oakland Raiders. He started for the Raiders for five seasons. Raiders running back Charlie Garner posted three seasons of more than 1,700 yards from scrimmage with Ritchie as his teammate after rushing for just 381 yards the year before he joined Oakland. The Raiders led the league in total yardage in 2002, en route to an AFC Championship and appearance in Super Bowl XXXVII, where Oakland lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nIn 2003, Ritchie signed a two-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles. He had expressed an interest in playing closer to his hometown, which was just 90 miles west of Philadelphia, so his friends and family could watch and attend his games. In 2003, the Eagles running back tandem of Brian Westbrook, Duce Staley, Correll Buckhalter and quarterback Donovan McNabb rushed for 2,015 yards and 23 touchdowns behind Ritchie. Ritchie was also second on the team in touchdown receptions in 2003 (behind Westbrook, and ahead of Staley), with the Eagles running backs playing a larger role in the passing game than the lackluster receiving core.\n\nFour games into the 2004 season, Ritchie suffered a season-ending knee injury. He re-signed with the Eagles on a one-year contract for the 2005 season while recovering from his injury. Though Ritchie had been taking first team reps as the starting fullback during training camp, he was released by the team during final cuts. He retired from playing prior to the 2006 season and began a career in sports media.\n\nRitchie announced in February 2016 that he will be running for the Pennsylvania State Senate to replace the retiring Pat Vance in Pennsylvania's 31st Senatorial District. He touted himself as a candidate that would lower taxes, will fight for pension reform, and help to revitalize Pennsylvania's education system. In a four-way race for the Republican nomination, Ritchie finished second to Mike Regan. Ritchie actually won the Democratic nomination by write-in votes despite not campaigning for it, but ultimately decided not to run in the general election.\n"}

Randy Brinson, a co-producer of \"The Eyes of Nye\", said in an interview that the reason for PBS's rejection of the show was a result of its desire for \"more serious, in-depth \"Nova\"-style shows\". Brinson went on to say that this and some \"local production issues\" were the cause of the show's delays, although in an interview for the same article Nye blamed financial problems within KCTS-TV (the producer of the show) for the delays. However, it was noted that \"The Eyes of Nye\" has been picked up for broadcast by about 100 public television stations, and that this may lead to further development.\n\nBob Nelson and Pat Cashman, members of the sketch comedy television show \"Almost Live!\", of which Bill Nye was also a member, made guest appearances. Cashman was also the voice of the announcer for Nye's previous show \"Bill Nye the Science Guy\". The show was directed by Emmy Award-winning, Steve Feldman and \"Almost Live!\" director & cast member Steve Wilson.\n"}

Though formerly classified as genus \"Calonyction\", species \"aculeatum\", it is now properly assigned to genus \"Ipomoea\", subgenus \"Quamoclit\", section \"Calonyction\".\n\nIt is a perennial, herbaceous liana growing to a height of 5–30 m tall with twining stems. The leaves are entire or three-lobed, 5–15 cm long, with a 5–20 cm long stem. The flowers are fragrant, white or pink, and large, 8–14 cm diameter. The flowers open quickly in the evening and last through the night, remaining open until touched by the morning sun. On overcast days, the blossoms may remain open for longer. The flowers also tend to remain open longer during cool temperatures - which may also cause the segments to snag or tear as they open.\n\nThe name moonflower derives from their blooming in the evening and their being round in shape like a full moon.\n\nThe Mesoamerican civilizations used the \"Ipomoea alba\" morning glory to convert the latex from the \"Castilla elastica\" tree to produce bouncing rubber balls. The sulfur in this morning glory served to cross-link the rubber, a process predating Charles Goodyear's discovery of vulcanization by at least 3,000 years.\n\nThe species is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for its flowers. In areas too cold for winter survival, it can be grown as an annual plant. Since it is of tropical origin, it flowers best under a summer short day photoperiod. Though it can be successfully flowered in the north, its flowering is impaired by excessively long summer days. Thus, it often does not set buds and bloom until early autumn when daylight length is once again near 12 hours. Propagation is usually by seed. The seed resembles a small, brownish nut, and should be nicked with a file and then soaked overnight before planting. In some areas, it is an invasive species which can cause problems in agricultural settings.\n"}

The two college students had been dating for approximately two years at the time that Herrin graduated and moved to Texas to attend a graduate program. Over the next year Garland and Herrin grew apart. Garland wanted to date other people. Concerned about it, Herrin arranged, with Garland's knowledge, to come to Scarsdale to discuss their relationship. Her parents, not knowing there was trouble in the relationship, allowed him to stay at their home. Garland told Herrin on July 6, 1977, she wanted to break off their relationship. He was to leave the next day. He was staying in a guest room on the opposite end of the home. During the early morning hours of July 7, 1977, Herrin went down to the basement and found a hammer. He wrapped it in a towel to conceal it. He then went up three flights of stairs to Garland's room. As stated in the testimony, he left the hammer outside the door and went in to confirm she was asleep. He then went back out into the hallway, unwrapped the hammer, went back into the room and, using the claw end of the hammer, smashed her skull to pieces.\n\nAfter attacking Garland, Herrin stole the Garland family car and drove around for hours ending up in Coxsackie. He found a church and told the priest inside, \"I just killed my girlfriend.\"\n\nIn fact, Bonnie was still alive though fatally injured. The priest called the Scarsdale police, who knocked on the Garlands' door early in the morning. They entered her bedroom to find her gurgling and horribly injured; she later died.\n\nHerrin was arrested. A group led by members of the clergy of Yale's Catholic Church campaigned to have Herrin released on bail. They raised bail money and wrote letters attesting to Herrin's \"good character\" to the trial judge. Impressed by the campaign, the judge released Herrin into the care of the Christian Brothers in Albany. While he was awaiting trial he attended classes at the State University of New York under an alias. \n\nJudge Richard J. Daronco presided over the highly publicized trial at the Westchester County Courthouse in White Plains. Richard Herrin was convicted of first-degree manslaughter, rather than second degree murder and was sentenced to the maximum penalty under the law. He served 17 years in state prison at the Wende Correctional Facility in Alden, New York, and was released on January 12, 1995. Critics charged that the sentence was the result of the Yale community and, in particular, the Catholic chaplaincy uniting to support Herrin by portraying him as the victim of his upbringing in a minority neighborhood \"barrio\" in Los Angeles. The Garland case foreshadowed others in which the circumstances of the killing were muddied by the personalities of the victim and accused, such as the Preppie Murder case, in which Jack Litman, Herrin's lawyer, represented the defendant.\n\nAfter his release, Herrin moved to Socorro, New Mexico, where he was hired by a mental health foundation.\n\nThis was the last murder case in Scarsdale until the murder of 58-year-old pediatric doctor Robin Goldman on January 20, 2016. \n\n\n"}

Most of its users work in research, especially in the fields of economics, sociology, political science, biomedicine, and epidemiology.\n\nStata's capabilities include data management, statistical analysis, graphics, simulations, regression, and custom programming. It also has a system to disseminate user-written programs that lets it grow continuously.\n\nThe name \"Stata\" is a syllabic abbreviation of the words \"statistics\" and \"data\". The FAQ for the official forum of Stata insists that the correct English pronunciation of \"Stata\" \"must remain a mystery\"; any of \"Stay-ta\", \"Sta-ta\" or \"Stah-ta\" are considered acceptable.\n\nThere are four major builds of each version of Stata:\n\nSmall Stata, which was the smaller, student version for educational purchase only, is no longer available.\n\nStata has always emphasized a command-line interface, which facilitates replicable analyses. Starting with version 8.0, however, Stata has included a graphical user interface based on Qt framework which uses menus and dialog boxes to give access to nearly all built-in commands. This generates code which is always displayed, easing the transition to the command line interface and more flexible scripting language. The dataset can be viewed or edited in spreadsheet format. From version 11 on, other commands can be executed while the data browser or editor is opened.\n\nStata can only open a single dataset at any one time. Stata holds the entire dataset in (random-access or virtual) memory, which limits its use with extremely large datasets. This is mitigated to some extent by efficient internal storage, as there are integer storage types which occupy only one or two bytes rather than four, and single-precision (4 bytes) rather than double-precision (8 bytes) is the default for floating-point numbers.\n\nThe dataset is always rectangular in format, that is, all variables hold the same number of observations (in more mathematical terms, all vectors have the same length, although some entries may be missing values).\n\nStata can import data in a variety of formats. This includes ASCII data formats (such as CSV or databank formats) and spreadsheet formats (including various Excel formats).\n\nStata's proprietary file formats have changed over time, although not every Stata release includes a new dataset format. Every version of Stata can read all older dataset formats, and can write both the current and most recent previous dataset format, using the \"saveold\" command. Thus, the current Stata release can always open datasets that were created with older versions, but older versions cannot read newer format datasets.\n\nStata can read and write SAS XPORT format datasets natively, using the \"fdause\" and \"fdasave\" commands.\n\nSome other econometric applications, including gretl, can directly import Stata file formats.\n\nStata allows user-written commands, distributed as so-called ado-files, to be straightforwardly downloaded from the internet which are then indistinguishable to the user from the built-in commands. In this respect, Stata combines the extensibility more often associated with open-source packages with features usually associated with commercial packages such as software verification, technical support and professional documentation. Some user-written commands have later been adopted by StataCorp to become part of a subsequent official release after appropriate checking, certification, and documentation.\n\nStata had an active email list from August 1994 (\"Statalist\", over 1000 messages per month) which was turned into a web forum in March 2014 and is still called \"Statalist\". StataCorp employees regularly contribute to Statalist. It is maintained by Marcello Pagano of the Harvard School of Public Health, and not by StataCorp itself.\n\nArticles about the use of Stata and new user-written commands are published in the quarterly peer-reviewed \"Stata Journal\". The \"Stata Journal\" is a quarterly publication containing articles about statistics, data analysis, teaching methods, and effective use of Stata's language.\n\nUser Group meetings are held annually in the United States (the Stata Conference), the UK, Germany, and Italy, and less frequently in several other countries. Only the annual Stata Conference held in the United States is hosted by StataCorp LP. Local Stata distributors host User Group meetings in their own countries, however, Stata developers frequently travel to and present at these meetings. Established under the Societies Act on 10 May 2008, Singapore Stata Users Group is the world's first government-approved users group (Registration No: 2048/2008; Unique Entity No: T08SS0091A). Its slogan is \"Shaping Data Meaningfully\". As a non-profit organisation, StataUGS does not organise regular meetings but provides programming and statistical advice to users in Singapore through informal means. The active members of StataUGS are mostly engaged in biomedical research.\n\nTo perform a linear (OLS) regression of \"y\" on \"x\":\n\nregress y x [if]\n\nThe optional part \"if\" allows to restrict the sample used in the command to a subset. For example, if the command should only be applied to the females in the sample, one could specify: if female == 1.<br>\n\nTo perform logistic regression of \"y\" on \"x\":\n\nTo display a scatter plot of \"y\" against \"x\" restricted to values of \"x\" below 10:\n\nTo perform OLS regression of \"y\" on \"x\" with White's heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors:\n\nTo calculate Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for regression:\n\nTo code \"fizzbuzz\":\n\nprogram define fizzbuzz\nend\nSince 2000, StataCorp have released a new major release of Stata (incrementing the integer part of the version number) roughly every two years. Users must pay a fee if they wish to upgrade to the latest major release. Minor releases (incrementing the decimal part of the version number) are sometimes made available between major releases. These are available as free downloadable updates to those who have a licence for the previous major release. Dates of all releases are available on the Stata website. Stata 16 was released on June 26, 2019.\n\nStata's versioning system is designed to give a very high degree of backward compatibility, ensuring that code written for previous releases continues to work. However, users should be careful when they save or open data among different versions.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1809013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809013", "title": "Shoshone Falls", "text": "Shoshone Falls\n\nShoshone Falls () is a waterfall on the Snake River in southern Idaho, United States, approximately northeast of the city of Twin Falls. Sometimes called the \"Niagara of the West,\" Shoshone Falls is high— higher than Niagara Falls—and flows over a rim nearly wide.\n\nFormed by the cataclysmic outburst flooding of Lake Bonneville during the Pleistocene ice age about 14,000 years ago, Shoshone Falls marks the historical upper limit of fish migration (including salmon) in the Snake River, and was an important fishing and trading place for Native Americans. The falls were documented by Europeans as early as the 1840s; despite the isolated location, it became a tourist attraction starting in the 1860s. At the beginning of the 20th century, part of the Snake River was diverted for irrigation of the Magic Valley. Now, the flows over the falls can be viewed seasonally based on snowfall, irrigation needs and hydroelectric demands. Irrigation and hydroelectric power stations built on the falls were major contributors to the early economic development of southern Idaho. \n\nThe City of Twin Falls owns and operates a park overlooking the waterfall. Shoshone Falls is best viewed in the spring, as diversion of the Snake River can significantly diminish water levels in the late summer and fall. The flow over the falls ranges from more than during late spring of wet years, to a minimum \"scenic flow\" (dam release) of in dry years.\n\nShoshone Falls is in the Snake River Canyon on the border of Jerome and Twin Falls Counties, upstream from the Snake River's confluence with the Columbia River. It is the tallest of several cataracts along this stretch of the Snake River, being located about downstream from Twin Falls and upstream from Pillar Falls. Directly above the Shoshone Falls, the Snake River narrows to less than wide and rushes over a series of rapids split by islands, before plunging over a vertical, horseshoe-shaped cliff high and wide. The appearance of the falls varies significantly depending on the amount of water in the Snake River. During high water, the falls appear as a single block stretching the full width of the river. In low water, the falls split into four or more separate drops; the widest, northern section is also called Bridal Veil Falls.\n\nLocated in an arid region, Shoshone Falls naturally received most of its water from snowmelt in the Rocky Mountains of Idaho and Wyoming near Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, and to a lesser extent springs in the Snake River Canyon above Twin Falls. A large number of reservoirs, and massive diversions for the irrigation of nearly of farmland, have greatly reduced the volume of water reaching the falls, such that the canyon springs are now the primary water source. The average Snake River flow at the Twin Falls stream gaging station is . For comparison, the average Snake River flow at Idaho Falls – upstream – is . The average flow below Milner Dam, upstream, is just , and is frequently zero in the late summer and fall.\nIdaho Power's Shoshone Falls Dam is located directly upstream from the falls and diverts water to the Shoshone hydroelectric plant, further reducing the water volume. Idaho Power is required to maintain a minimum daytime \"scenic flow\" of from April through Labor Day, although even this small flow can be difficult to achieve due to a lack of water in the Snake River. Further complicating the issue is that most irrigation water is needed in the summer, which coincides with the peak tourist season. The Shoshone power plant draws up to of water per second; thus, the flow of the falls will only increase if the Snake River flow exceeds the combined plant capacity and scenic flow requirement. The best time to view the falls is between April and June, when snowmelt is peaking, and when water is released from upriver reservoirs to assist steelhead migration.\n\nThe highest flow ever recorded at Twin Falls was on June 10, 1914, and the lowest was on April 1, 2013. On a monthly basis, June generally sees the heaviest flows, at , and August the lowest flows, .\n\nMost of the rocks underlying the Snake River Plain originated from massive lava flows related to eruptions of the Yellowstone hotspot over many millions of years. Shoshone Falls flows over a 6-million-year-old rhyolite or trachyte lava flow that intersects the weaker basalt layers comprising the surrounding Snake River Plain, creating a natural knickpoint that resists water erosion. The falls themselves were created quite suddenly during the cataclysmic Bonneville Flood at the end of the Pleistocene ice age about 14,500–17,500 years ago, when pluvial Lake Bonneville, an immense freshwater lake that covered much of the Great Basin, overflowed through Red Rock Pass into the Snake River. About of water were released–1500 times the average annual flow of the Snake River at Twin Falls. The massive flow of water carved the Snake River Canyon in a matter of several weeks, sculpting falls such as Shoshone Falls where the local geology intersected harder underlying rock layers.\n\nThe immense Snake River Aquifer is formed in the region's porous volcanic rock and recharged each year by melting snow in the surrounding mountains. Because the Shoshone Falls canyon lies lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain, groundwater is forced to the surface via large springs in the canyon walls. Despite the almost total diversion of the river upstream from Milner Dam, these springs can provide up to of water to the falls. Spring flow varies widely depending on the season, although it has increased since the 1950s due to irrigation water on the surrounding plain percolating into the aquifer.\n\nDue to its great height, Shoshone Falls is a total barrier to the upstream movement of fish. Anadromous fish (which live in the ocean as adults, but return to fresh water to lay eggs) such as salmon and steelhead/rainbow trout, and other migratory fish such as sturgeon, cannot pass the falls. Prior to the construction of many dams on the Snake River below Shoshone Falls, spawning fish would congregate in great numbers at the base of the falls, where they were a major food source for local Native Americans. Yellowstone cutthroat trout lived above the falls in the same ecological niche as rainbow trout below it, although their range has decreased since the 19th century due to river diversions and competition from introduced species such as lake trout. Due to this marked difference, the World Wide Fund for Nature uses Shoshone Falls as the boundary between the Upper Snake and the Columbia Unglaciated freshwater ecoregions. The Snake River above Shoshone Falls shares only 35 percent of its fish species with those of the lower Snake River below the falls. Fourteen fish species found in the upper Snake are also found in the Bonneville freshwater ecoregion (which covers the Great Basin portion of Utah), but not the lower Snake or Columbia rivers. The upper Snake River is also high in freshwater mollusk endemism (such as snails and clams).\n\nThe Shoshone Falls are named for the Lemhi Shoshone or Agaidika (\"Salmon eaters\") people, who depended on the Snake River's immense salmon runs as their primary food source, though they also supplemented their diet with various roots, nuts and large game such as buffalo. Because the falls are the upstream limit of salmon migration in the Snake River, they served as a central food source and trading center for the native peoples, who fished with willow spears tipped with elk horn. The Bannock people also traveled to Shoshone Falls each summer to gather salmon.\n\nAlthough the Lewis and Clark Expedition encountered the Shoshone Indians in 1805-06 they did not pass through the Shoshone Falls area. The 1811 Wilson Price Hunt Expedition, whose goal was to scout routes for the growing fur trade, traveled down the Snake River as far as Caldron Linn, a wild rapids located near present-day Murtaugh, Idaho. There, where the river drops into the precipitous Snake River Canyon, a canoe capsized and one of Hunt’s Canadian boatmen was drowned. Although the party explored the canyon for several miles downstream, Hunt’s journal does not mention any waterfalls as large as Shoshone Falls. Hunt then split the group to make foraging easier and they basically walked out of Idaho. The routes they pioneered would become part of the Oregon Trail, which would later bring many emigrants from the eastern United States to the Shoshone Falls area.\n\nOver the next thirty years, American and British-Canadian fur trappers hunted throughout south-central Idaho and are believed to have observed Shoshone Falls. However, none of those who kept journals mentioned the feature.\n\nJohn C. Frémont passed through the Shoshone Falls area during his 1843 expedition, which aimed to map the country through which passed the western half of the Oregon Trail. None of his party observed the falls, however, because they left the river canyon (probably near Murtaugh) and cut southwest across a sandy plain to reach Rock Creek. They returned to the canyon rim where Rock Creek enters the Snake. There, he observed the Thousands Springs, which he described as “a subterranean river [that] bursts out directly from the face of the escarpment.” \n\nThey descended into the canyon with some difficulty, made some river measurements, and continued downstream. They camped about a mile below what Frémont called \"Fishing Falls\": \"a series of cataracts with very inclined planes, which are probably so named because they form a barrier to the ascent of the salmon; and the great fisheries from which the inhabitants of this barren region almost entirely derive a subsistence commence at this place.\" He observed that the salmon were \"so abundant that they [the Shoshone] merely throw in their spears at random, certain of bringing out fish.\" This stretch of the river is now known as Salmon Falls. Early encounters between Europeans and Native Americans were generally friendly, but eventually brutal conflicts broke out over land ownership. After the Snake War, some twenty years later, the Shoshone were confined on reservations elsewhere.\n\nPioneer traffic along the Oregon Trail through Idaho increased steadily from 1843 on, with a spurt after Frémont’s journal was published and distributed. In 1847, some 4,000 emigrants passed through on their way to Oregon. One of the parties that year included Roman Catholic Bishop Augustin-Magloire Blanchet, who had been appointed to lead the new Diocese of Walla Walla. Traveling along the north side of the river, the group made a detour, perhaps guided by a former trapper who was familiar with the area. Blanchett then made the first known written record of seeing Shoshone Falls. Being from Quebec, Canada, he called the feature “Canadian Falls.” \n\nThat designation did not last very long, however. In August, 1849, a column of U. S. Army “Mounted Rifles” marched by, headed for Oregon. They took a route somewhat closer to the canyon and could actually hear the thunder of the falls. A local Indian had told their guide about the feature, so the guide led Lieutenant Andrew Lindsay and George Gibbs, a civilian writer and artist, to see them. Gibbs drew the first known image of the falls, and the pair selected “Shoshone Falls” as a more appropriate name.\n\nThe 1868 Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel, led by later U.S. Geological Survey director Clarence King, was the first to closely study the geology, soils and minerals of the Shoshone Falls area. King described the country as \"strange and savage\", and said of the falls themselves: \"You ride upon a waste. Suddenly, you stand upon a brink. Black walls flank the abyss. A great river fights its way through the labyrinth of blackened ruins and plunges in foaming whiteness.\" He was also the first to speculate that the falls and canyon, rather than being formed by erosion over millennia, might have been created by \"moments of great catastrophe\" considering the region's chaotic volcanic history. Timothy H. O'Sullivan was also a member of the 1868 expedition, and became the first national photographer to picture the falls. O'Sullivan also returned to the area in 1874, again to photograph Shoshone Falls.\n\nThe Shoshone Falls first became a tourist attraction in the mid-19th century, despite its inhospitable and isolated surroundings. Travelers on the Oregon Trail often stopped to visit the falls, which required only a \"slight detour\" to the north. Promoters of tourism to the falls cited the \"lonely grandeur\" of the surrounding country and the fact that the falls were not \"overshadowed by a city\", perhaps in reference to Niagara Falls which at this time had become infamous for the rampant commercial development adjacent to it. The first known reference to Shoshone Falls as \"The Niagara of the West\" was in an article from an unknown Salt Lake City paper, reprinted in the \"Philadelphia Bulletin\" in 1866, in which the falls were described as \"a world wonder which for savage scenery and power sublime stands unrivaled in America\". The falls were painted by Thomas Moran, famous for his depictions of rugged Western landscapes such as Yellowstone, in 1900 for the 1901 Pan-American Exposition.\nIn 1869 gold was discovered in the Snake River Canyon in the vicinity of Shoshone Falls, and by 1872 about 3,000 miners had come to the area in search of the precious metal. The richest deposits were said to be in the area between Murtaugh, about above Shoshone Falls, and Clark's Ferry, about below the falls. The towns of Shoshone City, Springtown and Drytown were created as a result of the gold rush. However, the boom quickly ended as the local geology and manner of sediment deposits made it difficult to remove gold. The first miners were mainly of European descent, and were later replaced by Chinese miners who continued to work the claims into the early 1880s, in search of the fine gold particles known as \"gold flour\".\n\nIn 1876, Charles Walgamott, a local homesteader, foresaw the potential of the falls as a tourist destination, fenced large tracts of land surrounding the falls and began construction on a lodge, hoping to obtain title to said land through squatter's rights. In 1883 the Oregon Short Line Railroad was extended to Shoshone, Idaho, making travel to the falls much easier, and Walgamott sold the land to \"a syndicate of capitalists including Montana Senator William A. Clark, who intended to replace the hotel with a far grander establishment and to place a recreational steamship on the river.\" In April of the following year Walgamott was granted a license to operate a cable ferry across the Snake River upstream of the falls. Not surprisingly, this ferry was one of the most dangerous river crossings in Idaho. In 1904 and 1905 boats broke loose from the cable and were swept over the falls, killing four people. Many other near misses and incidents also took place. The hazards of the crossing led to a demand for a road or rail bridge that would span the canyon just below the falls. Although Twin Falls County commissioners deemed the idea \"feasible\", it was ultimately dropped due to its high cost. In 1919, the Hansen suspension bridge was built across a narrower part of the Snake River Canyon about upstream.\n\nIra Burton Perrine arrived in the Shoshone Falls area in 1884 and initially homesteaded at the bottom of the Snake River Canyon, where he raised cattle and planted orchards. He later became involved in the tourist business, starting a ferry and a stagecoach service, and building the Blue Lakes Hotel. However, Perrine is best known for his role in the economic development of southern Idaho based on massive irrigation projects, and consequentially, the periodic drying of Shoshone Falls. In 1900 the Twin Falls Land and Water Company was incorporated and filed claim for of water from the Snake River. Perrine's ultimate goal was to irrigate of land. Although this would have been impermissible in other parts of the western US, due to regulations such as those under the Homestead Act which limited each settler's claim to , Perrine's project fell under the boundaries of the 1894 Carey Act, which allowed private companies to construct large-scale irrigation systems in desert regions where the task would be far too great for individual settlers.\nPerrine proposed the diversion of the Snake River at Caldron Linn, a point approximately upstream of Shoshone Falls. Senator Clark and others who owned land at Shoshone Falls filed a lawsuit against the Twin Falls Land and Water Company, but were defeated in the Idaho Supreme Court in 1904. The Milner Dam and the major canals required to deliver water were completed by 1905. \"On March 1, 1905, Frank Buhl gave a ceremonial pull on the wheel on a winch and the gates of Milner Dam were closed, and the gates to a thousand miles of canal and laterals were opened, and the Snake River was diverted, and that night Shoshone Falls went dry as the water rushed across the desert far above, and Perrine's vision was realized, and 262,000 acres of desert were shortly transformed.\"\n\nThe reclamation of vast tracts of desert into productive farmland practically overnight led to the regional moniker of \"Magic Valley\". Powered entirely by gravity, it was \"a rare successful example\" of private irrigation development under the Carey Act. The city of Twin Falls was incorporated in 1905, on lands originally platted for town development as part of the irrigation project. In 1913, Perrine built an electric streetcar system to transport tourists from Twin Falls to the Shoshone Falls. In part due to the intervention of World War I which resulted in short supply of iron, the rail line was never completed as planned. The post-war rise in automobile ownership also made the line obsolete, and it was de-commissioned in 1916.\n\nThe Shoshone Falls Power Plant was completed in 1907 by the Greater Shoshone and Twin Falls Water Power Company. A low head diversion dam (the Shoshone Falls Dam) was built directly upstream of the falls and diverted water into a penstock, further reducing the amount of water flowing over the falls. The plant initially had a capacity of 500 kilowatts (KW). The plant was purchased by Idaho Power in 1916. Over the years the power plant was expanded and ultimately replaced with newer units capable of generating 12,500 KW. Currently about are required to run the plant at full capacity. In 2015 Idaho Power released a plan to increase the capacity to 64,000 KW, which would increase the water diversions and consequently effect even greater reductions of the water available to flow over the falls.\n\nOn September 8, 1974, American daredevil Evel Knievel attempted to jump over the Snake River approximately west of the falls on a rocket-powered motorcycle, the Skycycle X-2, after unsuccessfully petitioning the U.S. Government to let him attempt a jump over the Grand Canyon. Knievel and his team purchased land on both sides of the Snake River and built a large earthen ramp and launch structure. A crowd of 30,000 gathered to watch Knievel's jump, which failed because his parachute opened too early, causing him to float down towards the river. Knievel likely would have drowned were it not for canyon winds that blew him to the river bank; he ultimately survived with a broken nose. In September 2016, professional stuntman Eddie Braun successfully jumped the Snake River Canyon in a replica of Knievel's rocket.\n\nAs early as 1900, locals called for the creation of a national park at Shoshone Falls, although this proposal was never approved by Congress. In 1919 the Shoshone Falls Memorial Park Association proposed a memorial park at the falls for World War I veterans. The association hired California landscape architect Florence Yoch to design a plan for the park. However, these plans never materialized, in part due to the difficulties of obtaining the needed land from its previous owners. Frederick and Martha Adams later bought the land from Senator Clark, and donated it to the City of Twin Falls in 1932. The state of Idaho donated another tract of land in 1933 to add to the park.\n\nToday, Shoshone Falls Park encompasses the south bank of the Snake River at the falls. A $5 vehicle fee is posted from March 30 through September 30th . The park includes an overlook, interpretive displays and a trail system along the south rim of the Snake River Canyon. The trails provide access to nearby points of interest including Dierkes Lake and Evel Knievel's 1974 jump site. About 250,000 to 300,000 vehicles enter the park each year.\n\nIn 2015 Idaho Power completed the Shoshone Falls Expansion Project, which involved reconstructing portions of the Shoshone Falls Dam to reduce its aesthetic impact on the area, and to direct low water releases to the most scenic part of the falls, the \"Bridal Veil Falls\" on the north bank of the river.\n\n\n"}

She was an Olympic silver medalist and played professional volleyball in Japan.\n\nHyman was the second of eight children born to George W Hyman (5 July 1907- 13 July 1987) and Warrene Hyman nee Farrington (4 February 1927-December 1976). As a child, Hyman was self-conscious about her rapid growth and the fact that she towered over her peers. In 1983 she recalled \"When they were three foot tall, I was four foot tall. When they were four foot tall, I was five\". Her nickname at school was \"Jolly green giant\", but her family and friends persuaded her to be proud of her height and to use it to her advantage. Flo's final adult height was just over 6 ft 5in (1.96 m). In January 1979, in an interview, Hyman said that she found the stares and questions about her height that she got from strangers irritating but she had learned to live with it.\n\nWhen she was 12, and standing 6 ft 2in (1.88 m) tall, she began playing two-on-two tournaments on the beach, usually with her sister Suzanne as partner. In 1970, at the age of 16, Hyman started playing volleyball professionally. By the time Flo was a senior in high school, she had developed a lethal spike.\n\nHyman graduated from Morningside High School in Inglewood, California and then attended El Camino College for one year before transferring to the University of Houston as that school's first female scholarship athlete. She spent three years there and led the Houston Cougars to two top-five national finishes, but did not complete her final year, instead focusing her attention on her volleyball career. Hyman said she would graduate once her volleyball career was over and that \"You can go to school when you're 60. You're only young once, and you can only do this once\".\n\nWhile at Houston, she was the first ever winner of the Broderick Award, (now the Honda Sports Award) as the nation's best female collegiate volleyball player in 1977.\n\n\"I had to learn to be honest with myself. I had to recognize my pain threshold. When I hit the floor, I have to realize it's not as if I broke a bone. Pushing yourself over the barrier is a habit. I know I can do it and try something else crazy. If you want to win the war, you've got to pay the price.\"\nHyman left Houston to play for the national team, based in Colorado. When Hyman joined, the squad was sorely in need of leadership. Operating without a coach, it had a host of talented players with no one at the helm to guide them.\n\nIn 1975 the U.S. team floundered through qualifying rounds for the 1976 Olympic games and failed to make it. In 1977 the team finished fifth at the World Championships. Hyman and her teammates looked forward to qualifying for and playing in the 1980 Olympics, but their dreams were curtailed when the United States boycotted the Moscow games.\n\nHyman played in the 1981 World Cup and the 1982 World Championship, when the US won the bronze medal. A speciality of Hyman was the \"Flying Clutchman\", a fast, hard-impacting volleyball spike that travels at 110 mph (180 km/h). It was perfected under Dr. Gideon Ariel, a former 1960 and 1964 Israeli Olympic shot putter in Coto de Caza, California. At the 1984 Olympics, Hyman, by now both the tallest and oldest member of the team, led the US to the silver medal, beaten by China in the final. The United States had defeated them earlier in the tournament.\n\nAfter the Olympics, Hyman moved to Japan to play volleyball professionally, joining the Daiei women's squad in the Japan Volleyball League. She was so popular in Japan that she began a modeling and acting career there and was constantly in demand. She intended to return to the United States permanently in the Summer of 1986, but never got the chance to do so. On January 24, 1986, Hyman collapsed while sitting on the sidelines after being substituted out in a game against Hitachi in Matsue City. She told her team to keep fighting, then moments later slid to the floor. She was pronounced dead at 9:36 that evening.\n\nAt first, the cause of Hyman's death was stated to be a heart attack. Not fully accepting this finding, her family requested that an autopsy be performed in Culver City, California. The autopsy, which was held on January 30, dismissed the possibility of a heart attack. It found that Hyman had a very healthy heart, and instead it was determined that she had suffered from undiagnosed Marfan syndrome, which had caused a fatal aortic dissection. Apart from her height, nearsightedness, very long arms and large hands, she showed few other physical symptoms. The pathologist who performed the autopsy, Dr. Victor Rosen, said that Hyman physically had been in superb condition except for a single fatal flaw—a dime-sized weak spot in her aorta. That small spot, less than an inch above her heart, had been there since her birth, and the artery had burst at that point as she sat on the sideline in Matsue. There was a three-week-old blood clot around the tear, indicating that an earlier rip in the same spot had already begun to heal when the fatal second rupture occurred.\n\nDoctors later discovered Hyman's brother had Marfan syndrome as well, and he underwent an open heart surgery afterwards. Experts believed Hyman was lucky to have survived as long as she did, playing a physically demanding sport such as volleyball.\n\nShe was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood, California, on January 31, 1986. Over 500 people attended the funeral service.\n\n\n"}

It was produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, and released as a double A-side with \"Perfect Day\". The song received wide radio coverage, despite its touching on taboo topics such as transsexual people, drugs, male prostitution, and oral sex. In the United States, RCA released the single using an edited version of the song without the reference to oral sex. In 2010, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it at number 223 in its list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.\n\nThe lyrics, describing a series of individuals and their journeys to New York City, refer to several of the regular \"superstars\" at Andy Warhol's New York studio, the Factory, namely Holly Woodlawn, Candy Darling, Joe Dallesandro, Jackie Curtis and Joe Campbell (referred to in the song by his nickname \"Sugar Plum Fairy\"). Candy Darling was also the subject of Reed's earlier song for The Velvet Underground, \"Candy Says\".\n\nTwo decades after the song's release, Reed told interviewer David Fricke, \"I know my obituary has already been written. And it starts out, \"Doot, di-doot, di-doot...\"\"\n\nThe baritone saxophone solo played over the fadeout of the song is performed by Ronnie Ross, who had taught David Bowie to play the saxophone during Bowie's childhood.\n\nThe backing vocals are sung by Thunderthighs, a vocal group that included Dari Lalou, Karen Friedman, and Casey Synge.\n\nThe bass hook was devised by Herbie Flowers and was performed by him on double bass overlaid by fretless Fender Jazz Bass. He was paid a £17 flat fee ().\n\nDrums were played by Ritchie Dharma using brushes rather than conventional drumsticks.\n\nLike many of Reed's songs, \"Walk on the Wild Side\" is based on a plagal cadence, alternating from C to F. The F is played as a sixth chord. The pre-chorus introduces the major second, [D major].\n\nThe song is also noted for its twin interlocking bass lines played by Herbie Flowers on double bass and overdubbed on a stacked knob 1960 fretless Fender Jazz Bass. In an interview on BBC Radio 4 (\"Playing Second Fiddle\", aired July 2005), Flowers claimed the reason he came up with the twin bass line was that as a session musician, he would be paid \"double\" for playing two instruments on the same track, thus likely totalling his pay to £34 ().\n\nIn the 2001 documentary \"Classic Albums: Lou Reed: Transformer\", Reed says that it was Nelson Algren's 1956 novel, \"A Walk on the Wild Side\" (itself titled after the 1952 song \"The Wild Side of Life\"), that was the launching point for the song, even though, as it grew, the song became inhabited by characters from his own life. As with several other Reed songs from the 1970s, the title may also be an allusion to an earlier song, in this case Mack David and Elmer Bernstein's \"Walk on the Wild Side\", the Academy Award-nominated title song performed by Brook Benton for the 1962 film based on Algren's novel. During his performance of the song on his 1978 \"\" album, Reed humorously explains the song's development from a request that he write the music for the never-completed musical version of Algren's novel.\n\nEach verse refers to one of the \"superstars\" at Andy Warhol's New York studio, The Factory.\n\nThe lyrics were groundbreaking and risqué for their time, telling stories not usually told in rock songs up to then, and containing references to prostitution, transsexuals, and oral sex. \"I always thought it would be kinda fun to introduce people to characters they maybe hadn't met before, or hadn't wanted to meet,\" Reed said. The original release was a worldwide hit. In 2010, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked it as the 223rd greatest song of all time.\n\nIn the United States, RCA released the single using an edited version of the song without the reference to oral sex. In the UK, the reference has sometimes slipped past the censors, who were apparently unfamiliar with the term \"giving head\". The term \"colored girls\" was also an issue in the US; RCA provided radio stations with a version in which it was edited out.\n\nThe single peaked at #16 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles charts in early 1973. After the announcement of Reed's death in October 2013, both the song and the \"Transformer\" album re-charted via iTunes.\n"}

The Douglas Aircraft Company responded with a modified variant of their DT torpedo bomber, the DWC.\n\nFive aircraft were ordered for the round-the-world flight: one for testing and training and four for the actual expedition. The success of the World Cruiser bolstered the international reputation of the Douglas Aircraft Company. The design of the DWC was later modified to create the O-5 observation aircraft, which was operated by the Army Air Service.\nIn 1923, the U.S. Army Air Service was interested in pursuing a mission to be the first to circumnavigate the earth by aircraft, a program called \"World Flight\". Donald Douglas proposed a modified Douglas Aircraft Company DT to meet the Army's needs. The two-place, open cockpit DT biplane torpedo bomber had previously been supplied to the Navy, thus shortening production time for the new series. The DTs to be modified were taken from the assembly lines at the company's manufacturing plants in Rock Island, Illinois and Dayton, Ohio. Douglas promised that the design could be completed within 45 days after receiving a contract. The Air Service agreed and lent Lieutenant Erik Nelson, a member of the War Department planning group, to assist Douglas. Nelson worked directly with Douglas at the Santa Monica, California factory, to formulate the new proposal. \nThe modified aircraft known as the Douglas World Cruiser (DWC), powered by a 420 hp Liberty L-12 engine, also was the first major project at Douglas for Jack Northrop. Northrop designed the fuel system for the series. The conversion involved incorporating a total of six fuel tanks in wings and fuselage. For greater range, the total fuel capacity went from 115 gallons (435 liters) to 644 gallons (2,438 liters). Other changes from the DT involved having increased cooling capacity, as well as adding two separate tanks for oil and water. To ensure a more robust structure, a tubular steel fuselage, strengthened bracing, a modified wing of 49 ft (15 m) wingspan and larger rudder were required. The dual cockpits for the pilot and copilot/crewman were also located more closely together with a cutout in the upper wing to increase visibility.\n\nLike the DT, the DWC could be fitted with either floats or a conventional landing gear for water or ground landings. Two different radiators were available, with a larger version for tropical climes. After the prototype was delivered in November 1923, upon the successful completion of tests on 19 November, the Army commissioned Douglas to build four production series aircraft. Due to the demanding expedition ahead, spare parts, including 15 extra Liberty engines, 14 extra sets of pontoons, and enough replacement airframe parts for two more aircraft were specified and sent to way points along the route. The last aircraft was delivered on 11 March 1924.\n\nFrom 17 March 1924, the pilots practiced in the prototype which served as a training aircraft. On 6 April 1924, the four expedition aircraft, named \"Boston\", \"Chicago\", \"New Orleans\" and \"Seattle\", departed Sand Point, Washington, near Seattle, Washington. \"Seattle\", the lead aircraft, crashed in Alaska on 30 April. The other three aircraft with \"Chicago\" assuming the lead, continued west across Asia and Europe relying on a carefully planned logistics system, including prepositioned spare engines and fuel caches maintained by the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, to keep the aircraft flying. The \"Boston\" was forced down and damaged beyond repair in the Atlantic, off the Faroe Islands. The remaining two aircraft continued across the Atlantic to North America, where they were joined by the \"Boston II\" at Pictou, Nova Scotia. The recently re-christened prototype continued with the flight back to Washington and on the World Flight's ceremonial flypast across the United States. The three surviving aircraft returned to Seattle on 28 September 1924. The flight covered 23,942 nm (44,342 km). Time in flight was 371 hours, 11 minutes and average speed, 70 miles per hour.\n\nAfter the success of the World Cruiser, the Army Air Service ordered six similar aircraft as observation aircraft, retaining the interchangeable wheel/float undercarriage, but with much less fuel and two machine guns on a flexible mounting in the rear cockpit. These aircraft were initially designated DOS (Douglas Observation Seaplane), but were redesignated O-5 in May 1924.\n\nThe success of the DWC established Douglas Aircraft Company among the major aircraft companies of the world and led it to adopt the motto \"First Around the World – First the World Around\". The company also adopted a logo that showed aircraft circling a globe, replacing the original winged heart logo.\n\nIn returning to their starting point, during the ceremonial flight across the United States, when the aircraft made it to Chicago for a celebration attended by thousands, Lieutenant Smith, as the spokesman for the mission, addressed the crowd. Eddie Rickenbacker, the celebrated flying ace and chair of the welcoming committee, formally requested that the \"Chicago,\" as the mission flagship, remain in its host city, donated to the Field Museum of Natural History. Major General Mason M. Patrick, Chief of the Air Service, was on hand to accept the request, and promised its formal consideration.\n\nUpon the request of the Smithsonian Institution, however, the U.S. War Department transferred ownership of the \"Chicago\" to the national museum. It made its last flight, from Dayton, Ohio to Washington, D.C., on 25 September 1925. It was almost immediately put on display in the Smithsonian's Arts and Industries Building. In 1974, the \"Chicago\" was restored under the direction of Walter Roderick, and transferred to the new National Air and Space Museum building for display in their \"Barron Hilton Pioneers of Flight\" exhibition gallery.\n\nBeginning in 1957, the \"New Orleans\" was displayed at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. The aircraft was on loan from the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History and was returned in 2005. Since February 2012, the \"New Orleans\" is to be a part of the exhibits at the Museum of Flying, Santa Monica, California.\n\nThe wreckage of the \"Seattle\" was recovered and is now on display in the Alaska Aviation Museum. The original \"Boston\" sank in the North Atlantic, and it is thought that the only surviving piece of the original prototype, the \"Boston II\", is the aircraft data plate, now in a private collection, and a scrap of fuselage skin, in the collection of the Vintage Wings & Wheels Museum in Poplar Grove, Illinois.\n\nBob Dempster of Seattle, Washington, built an airworthy reproduction Douglas World Cruiser, the \"Seattle II\", powered by a restored Liberty engine, which made its maiden flight on 29 June 2016. He plans to repeat the around-the-world flight in \"Seattle II\", starting in April 2017.\n\n\nMcDonnell Douglas aircraft since 1920 : Volume I\n\n"}

{"id": "1809033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809033", "title": "Stereotype threat", "text": "Stereotype threat\n\nStereotype threat is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of conforming to stereotypes about their social group. It is purportedly a contributing factor to long-standing racial and gender gaps in academic performance.\n\nSituational factors that increase stereotype threat can include the difficulty of the task, the belief that the task measures their abilities, and the relevance of the stereotype to the task. Individuals show higher degrees of stereotype threat on tasks they wish to perform well on and when they identify strongly with the stereotyped group. These effects are also increased when they expect discrimination due to their identification with a negatively stereotyped group. Repeated experiences of stereotype threat can lead to a vicious circle of diminished confidence, poor performance, and loss of interest in the relevant area of achievement.\n\nSince its introduction into the academic literature, stereotype threat has become one of the most widely studied topics in the field of social psychology.\nStereotype threat has been argued to show a reduction in the performance of individuals who belong to negatively stereotyped groups. Its role in affecting public health disparities has also been suggested.\n\nAccording to the theory, if negative stereotypes are present regarding a specific group, group members are likely to become anxious about their performance, which may hinder their ability to perform to their full potential. Importantly, the individual does not need to subscribe to the stereotype for it to be activated. It is hypothesized that the mechanism through which anxiety (induced by the activation of the stereotype) decreases performance is by depleting working memory (especially the phonological aspects of the working memory system).\n\nSome researchers have suggested that stereotype threat should not be interpreted as a factor in real-life performance gaps, and have raised the possibility of publication bias. Other critics have focused on correcting what they claim are misconceptions of early studies showing a large effect. However, meta-analyses and systematic reviews have shown significant evidence for the effects of stereotype threat, though the phenomenon defies over-simplistic characterization.\n\nThe opposite of stereotype threat is stereotype boost, which is when people perform better than they otherwise would have, because of exposure to positive stereotypes about their social group. A variant of stereotype boost is stereotype lift, which is people achieving better performance because of exposure to negative stereotypes about other social groups.\n\nAs of 2011, more than 300 published papers show the effects of stereotype threat on performance in a variety of domains. It is considered by some researchers to be a contributing factor to long-standing racial and gender achievement gaps, such as under-performance of black students relative to white ones in various academic subjects, and under-representation of women at higher echelons in the field of mathematics.\n\nThe strength of the stereotype threat that occurs depends on how the task is framed. If a task is framed to be neutral, stereotype threat is not likely to occur; however, if tasks are framed in terms of active stereotypes, participants are likely to perform worse on the task. For example, a study on chess players revealed that female players performed more poorly than expected when they were told they would be playing against a male opponent. In contrast, women who were told that their opponent was female performed as would be predicted by past ratings of performance. Female participants who were made aware of the stereotype of females performing worse at chess than males performed worse in their chess games.\n\nResearchers Vishal Gupta, Daniel Turban, and Nachiket Bhawe extended stereotype threat research to entrepreneurship, a traditionally male-stereotyped profession. Their study revealed that stereotype threat can depress women's entrepreneurial intentions while boosting men's intentions. However, when entrepreneurship is presented as a gender-neutral profession, men and women express a similar level of interest in becoming entrepreneurs. Another experiment involved a golf game which was described as a test of \"natural athletic ability\" or of \"sports intelligence\". When it was described as a test of athletic ability, European-American students performed worse, but when the description mentioned intelligence, African-American students performed worse.\n\nOther studies have demonstrated how stereotype threat can negatively affect the performance of European Americans in athletic situations as well as the performance of men who are being tested on their social sensitivity. Although the framing of a task can produce stereotype threat in most individuals, certain individuals appear to be more likely to experience stereotype threat than others. Individuals who highly identify with a particular group appear to be more vulnerable to experiencing stereotype threat than individuals who do not identify strongly with the stereotyped group.\n\nThe mere presence of other people can evoke stereotype threat. In one experiment, women who took a mathematics exam along with two other women got 70% of the answers right, whereas women who took the same exam in the presence of two men got an average score of 55%.\n\nThe goal of a study conducted by Desert, Preaux, and Jund in 2009 was to see if children from lower socioeconomic groups are affected by stereotype threat. The study compared children that were 6–7 years old with children that were 8–9 years old from multiple elementary schools. These children were presented with the Raven's Matrices test, which is an intellectual ability test. Separate groups of children were given directions in an evaluative way and other groups were given directions in a non-evaluative way. The \"evaluative\" group received instructions that are usually given with the Raven Matrices test, while the \"non-evaluative\" group was given directions which made it seem as if the children were simply playing a game. The results showed that third graders performed better on the test than the first graders did, which was expected. However, the lower socioeconomic status children did worse on the test when they received directions in an evaluative way than the higher socioeconomic status children did when they received directions in an evaluative way. These results suggested that the framing of the directions given to the children may have a greater effect on performance than socioeconomic status. This was shown by the differences in performance based on which type of instructions they received. This information can be useful in classroom settings to help improve the performance of students of lower socioeconomic status.\n\nThere have been studies on the effects of stereotype threat based on age. A study was done on 99 senior citizens ranging in age from 60–75 years. These seniors were given multiple tests on certain factors and categories such as memory and physical abilities, and were also asked to evaluate how physically fit they believe themselves to be. Additionally, they were asked to read articles that contained both positive and negative outlooks about seniors, and they watched someone reading the same articles. The goal of this study was to see if priming the participants before the tests would affect performance. The results showed that the control group performed better than those that were primed with either negative or positive words prior to the tests. The control group seemed to feel more confident in their abilities than the other two groups.\n\nMany psychological experiments carried out on Stereotype Threat focus on the physiological effects of negative stereotype threat on performance, looking at both high and low status groups. Scheepers and Ellemers tested the following hypothesis: when assessing a performance situation on the basis of current beliefs the low status group members would show a physiological threat response, and high-status members would also show a physiological threat response when examining a possible alteration of the status quo(Scheepers & Ellemers, 2005). The results of this experiment were in line with expectations. As predicted, participants in the low status condition showed higher blood pressure immediately after the status feedback, while participants in the high-status condition showed a spike in blood pressure while anticipating the second round of the task.\n\nIn 2012, Scheepers et al. hypothesized that when high social power is stimulated 'an efficient cardiovascular pattern (challenge)' is produced, whereas, 'an inefficient cardiovascular pattern' or threat is caused by the activation of low social power (Scheepers, de Wit, Ellemers & Sassenberg, 2012). Two experiments were carried out in order to test this hypothesis. The first experiment looked at power priming and the second experiment related to role play. Both results from these two experiments provided evidence in support for the hypothesis.\n\nCleopatra Abdou and Adam Fingerhut were the first to develop experimental methods to study stereotype threat in a health care context, including the first study indicating that health care stereotype threat is linked with adverse health outcomes and disparities.\n\nSeveral meta-analyses and systematic reviews have shown significant evidence for the effects of stereotype threat. However they also point to ways in which the phenomenon defies over-simplistic characterization. For instance, one meta-analysis found that with female subjects \"subtle threat-activating cues produced the largest effect, followed by blatant and moderately explicit cues\" while with minorities \"moderately explicit stereotype threat-activating cues produced the largest effect, followed by blatant and subtle cues\".\n\nAlthough numerous studies demonstrate the effects of stereotype threat on performance, questions remain as to the specific cognitive factors that underlie these effects. Steele and Aronson originally speculated that attempts to suppress stereotype-related thoughts lead to anxiety and the narrowing of attention. This could contribute to the observed deficits in performance. In 2008, Toni Schmader, Michael Johns, and Chad Forbes published an integrated model of stereotype threat that focused on three interrelated factors:\n\n\nSchmader et al. suggest that these three factors summarize the pattern of evidence that has been accumulated by past experiments on stereotype threat. For example, stereotype threat has been shown to disrupt working memory and executive function, increase arousal, increase self-consciousness about one's performance, and cause individuals to try to suppress negative thoughts as well as negative emotions such as anxiety. People have a limited amount of cognitive resources available. When a large portion of these resources are spent focusing on anxiety and performance pressure, the individual is likely to perform worse on the task at hand.\n\nA number of studies looking at physiological and neurological responses support Schmader and colleagues' integrated model of the processes that produce stereotype threat. Supporting an explanation in terms of stress arousal, one study found that African Americans under stereotype threat exhibit larger increases in arterial blood pressure. One study found increased cardiovascular activation amongst women who watched a video in which men outnumbered women at a math and science conference. Other studies have similarly found that individuals under stereotype threat display increased heart rates. Stereotype threat may also activate a neuroendocrine stress response, as measured by increased levels of cortisol while under threat. The physiological reactions that are induced by stereotype threat can often be subconscious, and can distract and interrupt cognitive focus from the task.\n\nWith regard to performance monitoring and vigilance, studies of brain activity have supported the idea that stereotype threat increases both of these processes. Forbes and colleagues recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that measure electrical activity along the scalp, and found that individuals experiencing stereotype threat were more vigilant for performance-related stimuli.\n\nAnother study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain activity associated with stereotype threat. The researchers found that women experiencing stereotype threat while taking a math test showed heightened activation in the ventral stream of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a neural region thought to be associated with social and emotional processing. Wraga and colleagues found that women under stereotype threat showed increased activation in the ventral ACC and that the amount of this activation predicted performance decrements on the task. When individuals were made aware of performance-related stimuli, they were more likely to experience stereotype threat.\n\nA study conducted by Boucher, Rydell, Loo, and Rydell has shown that stereotype threat not only affects performance, but can also affect the ability to learn new information. In the study, undergraduate men and women had a session of learning followed by an assessment of what they learned. Some participants were given information intended to induce stereotype threat, and some of these participants were later given \"gender fair\" information, which it was predicted would reduce or remove stereotype threat. As a result, participants were split into four separate conditions: control group, stereotype threat only, stereotype threat removed before learning, and stereotype threat removed after learning. The results of the study showed that the women who were presented with the \"gender fair\" information performed better on the math related test than the women who were not presented with this information. This study also showed that it was more beneficial to women for the \"gender fair\" information to be presented prior to learning rather than after learning. These results suggest that eliminating stereotype threat prior to taking mathematical tests can help women perform better, and that eliminating stereotype threat prior to mathematical learning can help women learn better.\n\nIn 1995, Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson performed the first experiments demonstrating that stereotype threat can undermine intellectual performance. Steele and Aronson measured this through a word completion task.\n\nThey had African-American and European-American college students take a difficult verbal portion of the Graduate Record Examination test. As would be expected based on national averages, the African-American students did not perform as well on the test. Steele and Aronson split students into three groups: stereotype-threat (in which the test was described as being \"diagnostic of intellectual ability\"), non-stereotype threat (in which the test was described as \"a laboratory problem-solving task that was nondiagnostic of ability\"), and a third condition (in which the test was again described as nondiagnostic of ability, but participants were asked to view the difficult test as a challenge). All three groups received the same test.\n\nSteele and Aronson concluded that changing the instructions on the test could reduce African-American students' concern about confirming a negative stereotype about their group. Supporting this conclusion, they found that African-American students who regarded the test as a measure of intelligence had more thoughts related to negative stereotypes of their group. Additionally, they found that African Americans who thought the test measured intelligence were more likely to complete word fragments using words associated with relevant negative stereotypes (e.g., completing \"__mb\" as \"dumb\" rather than as \"numb\").\n\nAdjusted for previous SAT scores, subjects in the non-diagnostic-challenge condition performed significantly better than those in the non-diagnostic-only condition and those in the diagnostic condition. In the first experiment, the race-by-condition interaction was marginally significant. However, the second study reported in the same paper found a significant interaction effect of race and condition. This suggested that placement in the diagnostic condition significantly impacted African Americans compared with European Americans.\n\nStereotype threat concerns how stereotype cues can harm performance. However, in certain situations, stereotype activation can also lead to performance enhancement through stereotype lift or stereotype boost. Stereotype lift increases performance when people are exposed to negative stereotypes about another group. This enhanced performance has been attributed to increases in self-efficacy and decreases in self-doubt as a result of negative outgroup stereotypes. Stereotype boost suggests that positive stereotypes may enhance performance. Stereotype boost occurs when a positive aspect of an individual's social identity is made salient in an identity-relevant domain. Although stereotype boost is similar to stereotype lift in enhancing performance, stereotype lift is the result of a negative outgroup stereotype, whereas stereotype boost occurs due to activation of a positive ingroup stereotype.\n\nConsistent with the positive racial stereotype concerning their superior quantitative skills, Asian American women performed better on a math test when their Asian identity was primed compared to a control condition where no social identity was primed. Conversely, these participants did worse on the math test when instead their gender identity—which is associated with stereotypes of inferior quantitative skills—was made salient, which is consistent with stereotype threat. Two replications of this result have been attempted. In one case, the effect was only reproduced after excluding participants who were unaware of stereotypes about the mathematical abilities of Asians or women, while the other replication failed to reproduce the original results even considering several moderating variables.\n\nDecreased performance is the most recognized consequence of stereotype threat. However, research has also shown that stereotype threat can cause individuals to blame themselves for perceived failures, self-handicap, discount the value and validity of performance tasks, distance themselves from negatively stereotyped groups, and disengage from situations that are perceived as threatening.\n\nStudies examining stereotype threat in Black Americans have found that when subjects are aware of the stereotype of Black criminality, anxiety about encountering police increases. This, in turn, can lead to self-regulatory efforts, more anxiety, and other behaviors that are commonly perceived as suspicious to police officers. Because police officers tend to perceive Black people as threatening, their reactions to these anxiety-induced behaviors are commonly more harsh than reactions to White people with the same behavior, and influences whether or not they decide to shoot the person.\n\nIn the long run, the chronic experience of stereotype threat may lead individuals to disidentify with the stereotyped group. For example, a woman may stop seeing herself as \"a math person\" after experiencing a series of situations in which she experienced stereotype threat. This disidentification is thought to be a psychological coping strategy to maintain self-esteem in the face of failure. Repeated exposure to anxiety and nervousness can lead individuals to choose to distance themselves from the stereotyped group.\n\nAlthough much of the research on stereotype threat has examined the effects of coping with negative stereotype on academic performance, recently there has been an emphasis on how coping with stereotype threat could \"spillover\" to dampen self-control and thereby affect a much broader category of behaviors, even in non-stereotyped domains. Research by Michael Inzlicht and colleagues suggest that, when women cope with negative stereotypes about their math ability, they perform worse on math tests, and that, well after completing the math test, women may continue to show deficits even in unrelated domains. For example, women might overeat, be more aggressive, make more risky decisions, and show less endurance during physical exercise.\n\nThe perceived discrimination associated with stereotype threat can also have negative long-term consequences on individuals' mental health. Perceived discrimination has been extensively investigated in terms of its effects on mental health, with a particular emphasis on depression. Cross-sectional studies involving diverse minority groups, including those relating to internalized racism, have found that individuals who experience more perceived discrimination are more likely to exhibit depressive symptoms. Additionally, perceived discrimination has also been found to predict depressive symptoms in children and adolescents. Other negative mental health outcomes associated with perceived discrimination include a reduced general well-being, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and rebellious behavior. A meta-analysis conducted by Pascoe and Smart Richman has shown that the strong link between perceived discrimination and negative mental health persists even after controlling for factors such as education, socioeconomic status, and employment.\n\nAdditional research seeks ways to boost the test scores and academic achievement of students in negatively stereotyped groups. There are many ways to combat the effects of stereotype threat.\n\n\nThe stereotype threat explanation of achievement gaps has attracted criticism. Some studies have cautioned that stereotype threat should not be interpreted as a factor in real-world performance gaps. Multiple reviews have raised concerns that the effect has been over-estimated for schoolgirls and that the field likely suffers from publication bias.\n\nAccording to Paul R. Sackett, Chaitra M. Hardison, and Michael J. Cullen, both the media and scholarly literature have wrongly concluded that eliminating stereotype threat could completely eliminate differences in test performance between European Americans and African Americans. Sackett et al. have pointed out that, in Steele and Aronson's (1995) experiments where stereotype threat was removed, an achievement gap of approximately one standard deviation remained between the groups, which is very close in size to that routinely reported between African American and European Americans' average scores on large-scale standardized tests such as the SAT. In subsequent correspondence between Sackett et al. and Steele and Aronson, Sackett et al. wrote that \"They [Steele and Aronson] agree that it is a misinterpretation of the Steele and Aronson (1995) results to conclude that eliminating stereotype threat eliminates the African American-White test-score gap.\" However, in that same correspondence, Steele and Aronson point out that \"it is the stereotype threat conditions, and not the no-threat conditions, that produce group differences most like those of real-life testing.\"\n\nArthur R. Jensen criticised stereotype threat theory on the basis that it invokes an additional mechanism to explain effects which could be, according to him, explained by other, well-known, and well-established theories, such as test anxiety and especially the Yerkes–Dodson law. In Jensen's view, the effects which are attributed to stereotype threat may simply reflect \"the interaction of ability level with test anxiety as a function of test complexity\". However, Diamond \"et al\" state \"that one problem with the Yerkes-Dodson law is that it invokes an ill-defined distinction between 'simple' versus 'complex' tasks.\" They further articulate that, \"Yerkes and Dodson may have the dubious distinction to be the most highly cited, but largely unread, paper in the history of science.\"\n\nIn 2009, Wei examined real-world testing over a broad population (rather than lab assessments with questionable external validity), and found a reverse stereotype threat: a randomly assigned question actually raised female students' scores by 0.05 standard deviations. An earlier experiment with Advanced Placement exams found no effects that were 'practically significant,' but does show 'statistically significant' effect.\n\nGijsbert Stoet and David C. Geary reviewed the evidence for the stereotype threat explanation of the achievement gap in mathematics between men and women. They concluded that the relevant stereotype threat research has many methodological problems, such as not having a control group, and that some literature on this topic misrepresents stereotype threat as more well established than it is. Still, they did find evidence for a marginally significant (d=0.17) effect of stereotype-threat.\n\nIn an article published on \"Psychology Today\" in 2015, psychologist Lee Jussim pointed out that, in their study, Steele and Aronson controlled for prior SAT scores using analysis of covariance, which caused the difference between black and white students' test scores in the \"non-diagnostic\" test group to nearly disappear. Jussim demonstrated that, using the same technique to control for prior temperatures, he could cause Nome, Alaska and Tampa, Florida to appear to have nearly the same average temperature. However, as Steele and Aronson point out, the larger literature beyond their 1995 paper \"shows the effect of stereotype threat on an array of tests—SATs, IQ tests, and French language tests to list only a few—sometimes with a co-variance adjustment, but many times without.\"\n\nThe strength and type of the effect has also been questioned. Flore and Wicherts concluded the reported effect is small, but also that the field is inflated by publication bias. They argue that, correcting for this, the most likely true effect size is near zero (see meta-analytic plot, highlighting both the restriction of large effect to low-powered studies, and the plot asymmetry which occurs when publication bias is active).\n\nEarlier meta-analyses reached similar conclusions. For instance, Ganley et al. (2013) examined math stereotype threat in a well-powered (total N ~ 1000) multi-experiment study. This allowed examination of potential moderators such as age and implicit vs explicit methods. Significant gender differences in math were found, but \"no evidence that the mathematics performance of school-age girls was impacted by stereotype threat\" was found. Further, they found that evidence for stereotype threat in children reflects publication bias: large, well-controlled studies find smaller or non-significant effects, while among the many underpowered studies run, researchers selectively published those in which false-positive effects reached significance:\n\nnonsignificant findings were almost always reported in an article along with some significant stereotype threat effects found either at another age (Ambady et al., 2001; Muzzatti & Agnoli, 2007), only with certain students (Keller, 2007), on certain items (Keller, 2007; Neuville & Croizet, 2007), or in certain contexts (Huguet & Regner, 2007, Study 2; Picho & Stephens, 2012; Tomasetto et al., 2011). Importantly, none of the three unpublished dissertations showed a stereotype threat effect. This observation suggests the possibility that publication bias is occurring. Publication bias refers to the fact that studies with null results are often not written up for publication or accepted for publication (Begg, 1994). This bias is a serious concern, especially if these results are being used to make recommendations for interventions.\n\nThe single largest experimental test of stereotype threat (N = 2064), conducted on Dutch high school students, found no effect. However, as David Nussbaum points out, the same experimental procedures for testing stereotype threat's effects may produce radically differing results in differing cultural contexts, and while this may prove an ongoing challenge for researchers it in no way disproves the existence of the phenomenon. As he goes on to argue:Seeing a large literature such as that of cognitive dissonance—and if we dare add, ST—as corrupted beyond interpretability simply because the motive for corruption exists (to publish) and the means exists (e.g., p-hacking) is to disregard the impact of other investigator motives and to embrace, in our view, an unlikely possibility.\n\n\n\n"}

This bonebed is located at the top of Unit 4 of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, which dates to about 68.5 million years ago. The only known specimen consists of parts of the upper and lower jaws—both premaxillae, a right maxilla, both dentaries—teeth and numerous small fragments. The skull appears to have been unusually short and tall. The teeth are relatively straight, but they emerge from the tooth sockets at an angle to the jaw line, resulting in a strongly raked row of teeth. A number of isolated teeth (previously referred to \"Saurornitholestes\") have also been recovered from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation; they can be recognized by their unusually large serrations. \nIn 2004 Philip J. Currie and David Varricchio named and described the type species of \"Atrociraptor\": \"Atrociraptor marshalli\". The generic name is derived from the Latin \"atrox\", \"savage\", and \"raptor\", \"seizer\". The specific name honours Marshall.\n\nIn 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at two metres, its weight at fifteen kilogrammes. \"Atrociraptor\" differs from \"Bambiraptor\" and other velociraptorines in its more isodont dentition—the teeth have different sizes but the same form—and short deep snout. A skull opening, the maxillary fenestra, is relatively large and positioned right above another opening, the promaxillary fenestra, a condition not known from other species.\n\n\"Atrociraptor\" was by its describers assigned to the Velociraptorinae within a larger Dromaeosauridae. However, in 2009 Currie published a cladistic analysis showing \"Atrociraptor\" to be a member of the Saurornitholestinae.\n\n"}

The show follows Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), an irascible, maverick medical genius who heads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. In a typical episode, the team is presented with an unusual case; the storyline follows the diagnosis of the patient's illness, a process often complicated by the internal competition and personal foibles of the diagnostic team. The team leader, House, frequently clashes with his boss (Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) in seasons 1 through 7, and Dr. Eric Foreman in season 8), and his only friend, Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard).\n\nIn seasons 1 through 3, House's diagnostic team includes Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps). This team leaves the show in the third season finale \"Human Error\". The show achieved its highest ranking with the episode \"Human Error\"; this episode placed the series in first position for the week it aired. Each season introduces a recurring guest star, who appears in a multi-episode story arc. The fourth season was the only exception to this pattern. It introduced seven new characters who compete for the coveted positions on House's team, replacing Cameron, Chase and Foreman. House eventually selects Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn) and Dr. Remy \"Thirteen\" Hadley (Olivia Wilde) as his new team; Foreman rejoins soon after. Following Kutner's death in season five, through a series of plot twists, House reacquires Chase, one of the original team members.\nWhen House resigns early in season six, Foreman takes his place, but he soon fires Thirteen, and Taub quits because he was there only to work with House. After this, Foreman hires both Cameron and Chase, but, soon, House comes back, spurring the return of Thirteen and Taub, too. When the dictator (\"The Tyrant\") dies because of Chase's intentional misunderstanding, Cameron and even Chase decide to leave the PPTH. But, Chase's desire to be part of House's team makes Cameron quit (though she later returns for the episode \"Lockdown\"). At the beginning of season seven, Thirteen ostensibly goes away to Rome (it's later revealed that this was actually a lie), leaving a vacancy on House's team. House proposes then, giving a chance to the rest of his team, to hire a new member. After some unsuccessful tries, Cuddy hires Martha M. Masters (Amber Tamblyn), a medical student in the episode \"Office Politics\". In the episode \"Last Temptation\", Masters takes the final choice to leave House's team. After being incarcerated following the events of \"Moving On\", House is released on probation thanks to Foreman, who has taken Cuddy's place as the Dean of Medicine. House is initially assigned a single team member, Dr. Chi Park (Charlyne Yi). After securing funding for his department in the season eight episode \"Risky Business\", House brings on former prison doctor Jessica Adams (Odette Annable) and rehires Chase and Taub.\n\nSince its premiere, the show has constantly received both high ratings and critical acclaim. Eight seasons were aired in the United States, the fourth of which was interrupted by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike and included only 16 episodes instead of the regular 22–24. Despite this interruption, \"House\" achieved its highest number of viewers for the episode \"Frozen\", for which there were over 29 million viewers on the night it aired due to its position as the lead-out program for Super Bowl XLII. In January 2009, \"House\" moved from its Tuesday, 8:00 pm ET slot to a new time slot of Monday nights at 8:00 pm ET, immediately before the Fox hit \"24\". Fox renewed the show for a seventh season, which premiered on September 20, 2010. An eighth season was announced on May 10, 2011 and premiered on October 3, 2011. On February 8, 2012, \"Fox\" announced that the season would be \"House\"s last.\n\nAll eight seasons were released on DVD and Blu-ray by Universal in North America, Europe and Australia. As of June 16, 2009, the show has been aired in more than 60 countries, with 86 million viewers worldwide.

He was originally drafted out of Louisville by the San Francisco 49ers, 25th overall in the 1991 NFL Draft, but also played for the Denver Broncos, Buffalo Bills, Chicago Bears, New England Patriots, Oakland Raiders and Cleveland Browns during his career.\n\nWashington was selected to four Pro Bowls in his career and, with the Patriots, won Super Bowl XXXVIII over the Carolina Panthers . At 6'5\" and more than 375 pounds in his prime, he has been described as \"the prototypical [3-4] nose tackle of this era.\" His gargantuan frame earned him nicknames like \"Mt. Washington\" or \"Washington Monument\". Also notable for his longevity, Washington was a starting nose tackle—one of the most physically demanding positions in football—until the age of 39.\n\nAt Tampa Bay Technical High School in Tampa, Washington was a four-sport standout in football, track, baseball, and wrestling. As a senior, he was the Florida State Wrestling champion in the unlimited weight class.\n\nAs a senior at the University of Louisville, Washington had 76 tackles, seven sacks, and three blocked field goals, and was an All-South Independent selection. He majored in physical education.\n\nWashington was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the first round (25th overall) in the 1991 NFL Draft. He made his NFL debut at the New York Giants on September 2 and finished the season with 21 tackles and one sack. In his second season with the 49ers he played in 16 games and finished the season with 35 tackles and two sacks. The 1993 season was a progression from the previous season as Washington made 41 tackles and three sacks. Just as they had done in the previous year the 49ers made it to the NFC Championship game.\n\nWashington was also among the players who harassed 49ers head trainer Lindsy McLean, who is gay. In an ESPN Magazine article, McLean said that numerous 49ers humiliated him during his stint with the team, including one who made a habit of grabbing him from behind and simulating rape, saying, \"Get over here, b----. I know what you want.\" The behavior continued even after the player was traded to another team. McLean declined to name any of his harassers, but the Boston Globe later identified Washington as the perpetrator. Washington's agent, Angelo Wright, also confirmed that the player in question was his client.\n\nOn April 20, 1994, Washington was traded to the Denver Broncos. In his one and only year with the Broncos he started 15 games making 56 tackles and 2.5 sacks. The game versus the Cincinnati Bengals on November 27 was significant as it marked the start of a 119 consecutive game streak which would last until 2002.\n\nHe was signed by the Buffalo Bills as an unrestricted free agent on February 24, 1995. Playing nose tackle, Washington lined up next to defensive end Bruce Smith in Buffalo's 3-4 defense. In his first season, he posted 86 tackles in 16 regular season games and two post season ones. In his second season with the Bills he recorded career numbers with 130 tackles. In the 1997 season, he recorded 124 tackles and four sacks. He was also selected to his first Pro Bowl. The following season, he was again selected to the Pro Bowl after finishing the year with 101 tackles and 4.5 sacks, which was a career high. In 1998, he again started in all 16 games and finished the season with 87 tackles. Washington was selected to do his third Pro Bowl in the 2000 season after recording 86 tackles and 2.5 sacks.\n\nFollowing the 2000 NFL season, the Bills struggled to meet the salary-cap deadline. On February 22, Washington, who was scheduled to make about $7.6 million—including bonus money— in 2001, was cut in part because he refused to take a pay cut for the second straight year.\n\nWashington was signed by the Chicago Bears as an unrestricted free agent on April 16, 2001. In his first season with the Bears he started in 15 games recording 50 tackles and 1.5 sacks and was selected to his fourth Pro Bowl. His second season with the Bears was ruined by injury as he only started in two games before being placed on injured reserve after suffering a fractured leg and torn ligament in his left foot.\n\nHe was traded to the New England Patriots on August 20, 2003. He was part of a defense that was ranked 4th overall and finished the season with 45 tackles. He started and was part of the Patriots team who won Super Bowl XXXVIII.\n\nWashington was signed by the Oakland Raiders as an unrestricted free agent on March 3, 2004. He started all 16 games and finished the season with 41 tackles and three sacks. In 2005, his second season with the Raiders, he again started in all 16 games and recorded 44 tackles.\n\nHe was signed by the Cleveland Browns as an unrestricted free agent on March 13, 2006. During the first play of training camp with the Browns in 2006, he was supposedly the one who injured the newly acquired all pro center LeCharles Bentley which was later denounced but when questioned about the incident he yelled at the reporters \"It wasn't me who did it, I'll go see how he's doing later.\" In his first season with the Browns, just as he had done in eight other seasons he started in all 16 regular season games making 61 tackles. He finished the 2007 season with nine tackles. He decided to retire after he was released after the 2007-08 season. He weighed 375 pounds in his final NFL season, but he weighed up to 400 pounds at one point. In 2012, Washington was a nominee for the Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2013.\n\nHe is the son of former Houston Oilers linebacker Ted Washington, Sr..\n\nWashington resides with his wife and five children (three daughters and two sons), in Charlotte, North Carolina. \n"}

It was renamed Still College in 1905 and Des Moines Still College of Osteopathy and Surgery during the 1940s.\n\nIn 1958, the institution was renamed the College of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery. The first satellite clinic was established in 1963. In 1971, the Dietz Diagnostic Center, then a specialty clinic, began operation as a major outpatient facility. In 1980 the University was renamed University of Osteopathic Medicine and Health Sciences with a broadened educational mission. The school moved to its present site in 1972. The College of Podiatric Medicine and Surgery and the College of Biological Sciences (now the College of Health Sciences) were both established by the college's Board of Trustees in 1980 and are now part of the osteopathic medical university, along with the College of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery.\n\nThe College of Health Sciences established the physician assistant program in 1981 and the physical therapy program in 1988.\n\nThe college adopted the Des Moines University name on September 18, 1999. On August 15, 2003, former Iowa Governor Terry E. Branstad became the university's president. On October 16, 2009, Branstad announced his retirement as President of Des Moines University in order to pursue running again for Governor of Iowa; Steve Dengle was chosen as interim president. In 2005, the university opened a $24 million Student Education Center, with a medical library, new classrooms, a coffee shop, and an exercise gym with a basketball court.\n\nIn 2019, the university announced plans to relocate to West Des Moines by 2023.\n\nThe unaffiliated Des Moines College used the name Des Moines University during the 1920s until its closure in 1929.\n\nThe COM (College of Osteopathic Medicine) D.O. class of 2022 had an average overall GPA of 3.61, an average science GPA of 3.54, and an average MCAT score of 507.

It is the U.S. national group representing the larger international Engineers Without Borders in the USA. This partnership involves the implementation of sustainable engineering projects, while involving and training internationally responsible engineers and engineering students.\n\nEngineers Without Borders – USA (EWB-USA) was born from a chance meeting of Bernard Amadei (a Professor of Civil Engineering from the University of Colorado at Boulder), and Angel Tzec (a representative of the Belize Ministry of Agriculture). Tzec's village in Belize was in a difficult situation because it had no running water or sanitation. Tzec invited Dr. Amadei to visit his village in Belize, where he saw how laborious a task it was for the villagers to gather water. \n\"I came across little girls who had to carry water back and forth to the village all day, so they couldn't go to school,\" Amadei says. \"I knew that as a civil engineer, there had to be something I could do.”\n\nDr. Amadei returned with eight University of Colorado- Boulder Students and a local civil engineering expert, also from Boulder. With the help of the local community, they installed a clean water system powered by a waterfall in the area for less than $15,000. It was from this experience that Dr. Amadei came to see that he could utilize professional and student engineers to improve the quality of life in other development projects around the world.\n\nIn 2010 EWB–USA received the Henry C. Turner Prize for Innovation in Construction Technology from the National Building Museum. In a statement from the prize jury, Art Gensler said, \"This organization gives locals hope and talented engineering professionals the opportunity to share their knowledge with countries that can so greatly benefit from their efforts.\"\n\n"}

After leaving Victoria Police, she was appointed as chair of the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority in February 2009 until she stood down from the position in July 2010.\n\nNixon attended Macquarie University before attaining a Master of Public Administration from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.\n\nThe daughter of Ross Nixon, an assistant commissioner with the New South Wales Police Force, Christine Nixon began her policing career with the same police force in 1972, also rising to the rank of Assistant Commissioner.\n\nShe was appointed Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police in April 2001 by the Bracks Labor government.\n\nHaving initially set a retirement date of late March 2009, Nixon departed earlier at the request of the Victorian Government to take on responsibility for the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority.\n\nShe was succeeded as Chief Commissioner by Simon Overland.\n\nAs Chief Commissioner, Nixon marched in uniform during Melbourne's gay and lesbian 'Pride March', run as part of the Midsumma Festival. Nixon is heterosexual but marched to express her support for gay and lesbian causes, stating \"What I'm doing is supporting decent and reasonable people who want to get on with their lives, and they have been treated appallingly previously by the Police, and I'm prepared to do something about it. And if it's a small symbol of marching with them, then that would be a reasonable thing to do.\"\n\nNixon was criticised when she joined her husband, John Becquet, a former Qantas senior executive of crew operations, on the inaugural international flight of Qantas' Airbus A380 airliner from Melbourne to Los Angeles, as guests of Qantas in an all-expenses-paid, three-day trip. Ms Nixon called the trip \"reasonable\" and commented that she was accompanying her husband, and that she had not had a holiday in about 12 months. Mr Becquet defended the trip saying they were invited to LA after a chance meeting with a Qantas executive. \"I am normally her handbag but on this she's my handbag.\" The couple celebrated their 16th wedding anniversary during this week. The head of the Office of Police Integrity, Michael Strong, sought information on the matter from Ms Nixon at a time of calls for her to reimburse the airline for the cost of the trip.\n\nNixon was called to appear before the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission concerning her actions as chief commissioner during the Black Saturday bushfires on 7 February 2009. Counsel assisting the commission, Rachel Doyle SC, questioned Nixon on issues such as a morning hairdressing appointment, a lunchtime meeting with her biographer and an evening dinner at a restaurant, all during the worst day of the bushfires. Nixon defended her actions, stating \"It was not my job to swoop in and take control. When you have good people who are more skilled in emergency management than I am, you let those people do the job.\"\n\nIn February 2009 Nixon assumed responsibility for the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority, the agency tasked with rebuilding areas affected by the Black Saturday bushfires of February 2009. She stood down from the position on 17 July 2010, and announced she would take on a voluntary advisory role with the authority.\n\nIn October 2019 Nixon was selected as the chair of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) board. This was the first time in the college's 61-year history that a non-GP was chosen for the role. She had been on the RACGP council since 2017. RACGP president Harry Nespolon praised her prior large organisations skills and said of the appointment, \"Ideally we would have a GP chairing the RACGP as a member-based organisation, but at the moment, Christine is the right person.\"\n\nNixon was a non-executive director of Foster's Group from 1 April 2010 to 31 August 2010.

{"id": "1809083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809083", "title": "Fox NFL", "text": "Fox NFL\n\nFox NFL (also known as NFL on Fox) is the branding used for broadcasts of National Football League (NFL) games produced by Fox Sports and televised on the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). Game coverage is usually preceded by the pre-game shows \"Fox NFL Kickoff\" and \"Fox NFL Sunday\" and is followed on most weeks by post-game show \"The OT\". The latter two shows feature the same studio hosts and analysts for both programs, who also contribute to the former. In weeks when Fox airs a doubleheader, the late broadcast (which airs nationwide in nearly all markets, there typically being only one or two games taking place at the time) airs under the brand \"America's Game of the Week\".\n\nThe network aired its inaugural NFL game telecast on August 12, 1994, with a preseason game between the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. Coverage formally began the following month on September 4, with the premiere of \"Fox NFL Sunday\", followed by a slate of six regionally televised regular season games on the first Sunday of the 1994 season.\n\nThough Fox was growing rapidly as a network, and had established itself as a presence, it was still not considered a major competitor to the more-established \"Big Three\" broadcast networks (ABC, CBS and NBC). Fox management, having seen the critical role that soccer programming had played in the growth of British satellite service BSkyB, believed that sports, and specifically professional football, would be the engine that would turn Fox into a major network the quickest.\n\nTo this end, Fox had bid aggressively for football broadcast rights almost from the start. It notably passed on the United States Football League, which had hoped to move to fall in 1986, the same time Fox was to debut, and was seeking a broadcast contract. In 1987, Fox's first full year on the air, ABC initially hedged on renewing its contract to carry \"Monday Night Football\" – then the league's crown-jewel program – as was in the middle of negotiations to reach a new contract, due to an increased expense of the rights. Fox made an offer to the National Football League to acquire the \"Monday Night Football\" contract for the same amount ABC that had been paying to carry the package, about US$1.3 billion at the time. However, the NFL, in part because Fox had not established itself as a major network, chose to renew its contract with ABC.\n\nMeanwhile, after the Fox Broadcasting Company was launched, David Dixon, founder of the United States Football League, proposed the creation of the \"American Football Federation\", a spring league that would be made up of ten teams and draft high school graduates who were declared academically ineligible to play College Football by the NCAA. The league would never play a single game.\n\nDespite having a few successful shows in its slate, the network did not have a significant market share until the early 1990s when Fox parent News Corporation (which became 21st Century Fox through the July 2013 spin-off of its publishing unit, now the current News Corp.) began to upgrade some of its local affiliates – and eventually purchased additional stations from other television station groups, such as New World Communications and Chris-Craft Industries' BHC Communications and United Television, making it the largest owner of television stations in the United States. The time now filled by \"Fox NFL\" on Sunday afternoons during the fall and winter months was formerly in the control of the stations themselves (and still is to some extent outside of the NFL season, particularly during weeks when no sports programming is scheduled at all by the network, as well as on non-doubleheader weeks during the season), which usually filled the timeslots with either syndicated television series (both first-run and off-network) and/or movie blocks. The Sunday afternoon timeslot in the spring is filled by \"Fox NASCAR\" coverage of the NASCAR Cup Series.\n\nSix years after its first attempt, the league's television contracts for both conferences and for the Sunday and Monday prime time football packages came up for renewal again in 1993.\n\nMany expected that the NFL would receive less money than the $3.6 billion for four years that ABC, CBS, NBC, TNT, and ESPN had paid in 1990. Fox wanted the NFL to build credibility for its network. Knowing that it would likely need to bid considerably more than the incumbent networks, Fox bid $1.58 billion to obtain a four-year contract for the broadcast rights to the National Football Conference (NFC), exceeding CBS's bid by more than $100 million per year. The NFC was considered the more desirable conference (as opposed to the American Football Conference (AFC), whose television package was being carried at the time by NBC) due to its presence in most of the largest U.S. markets, such as New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Dallas-of which the Cowboys were gaining a national following in the 90's.\n\nDespite having a few successful shows like \"The X-Files\", Fox still lacked credibility among viewers. The network was mostly known for blue-collar family sitcoms like \"The Simpsons\" and \"Married... with Children\". Despite so much skepticism about Fox that it had to assure the NFL and reporters that Bart Simpson would not be an announcer, to the surprise and shock of many in the sports and media industries, on December 17, 1993, the NFL selected the bid offered by Fox, in the process stripping CBS of football for the first time since 1956. Fox's coverage, in addition to being able to televise NFC regular season and playoff games, also included the exclusive U.S. television rights to Super Bowl XXXI (held in 1997) under the initial contract, which took effect with the 1994 season.\n\nThe unexpectedly high bids from Fox and other networks increased the NFL salary cap, new in 1994, to $34 million from the predicted $32 million. CBS's Laurence Tisch had apparently underestimated the value of its NFL rights with respect to its advertising revenues and to its promotional opportunities for other programming on the network. Indeed, Fox was still an upstart player in 1993, not yet considered on par with CBS, NBC and ABC, the three longer established major networks (Fox, by comparison, had debuted in October 1986 as the only venture at a fourth television network since the 1956 demise of the DuMont Television Network to truly compete with the \"Big Three\"). The network already had offbeat hits such as \"The Simpsons\", \"Married... with Children\", and \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" on its schedule. However, Fox did not have a sports division up to that point, and its news division was a few years away from fruition (most Fox stations outside of a few owned by the network did not even produce their own news programming), and most Fox affiliates were often either full-power UHF stations or low-powered stations. In addition, there were some smaller markets that were not yet served by a local Fox affiliate; back in 1991, the Foxnet cable channel began operations to provide the network's programming to those areas until a new over-the-air affiliate was made available.\n\nThe vast resources that Rupert Murdoch had allowed the network to grow quickly, primarily to the detriment of CBS. After bringing in David Hill from Murdoch's U.K.-based Sky Sports to head-up the new Fox Sports division, Fox began luring over members of the CBS Sports staff, hiring longtime producer Ed Goren as Hill's second-in-command. Fox was also able to procure Pat Summerall and John Madden to be its lead broadcast team, a capacity they had been serving for CBS. Terry Bradshaw, who was previously co-host of \"The NFL Today\", was added to serve as the pregame show's lead analyst. Dick Stockton and Matt Millen also came over from CBS and became the network's #2 broadcast team, while James Brown, who had called play-by-play for CBS' game telecasts, was hired to be the studio host.\n\nFox then sought to raise its station profile as the start of its NFL contract came closer by approaching other broadcasters about switching their VHF stations (channels 2 to 13) to the network from one of the other established networks. On May 23, 1994, News Corporation struck an alliance with New World Communications, a television and film production company that by now was a key station group with several VHF CBS affiliates in NFC markets in its portfolio, and wary of a CBS without football. Through the deal, in which also Fox purchased a 20% interest in the company, nearly all of New World's stations (including several that the company was in the process of acquiring from Citicasters and Argyle Communications at the time the deal was struck) switched en masse to Fox beginning that September and continuing through September 1996 as existing affiliation contracts with their previous network partners came to an end (network subsidiary Fox Television Stations bought New World Communications outright in July 1996).\n\nIn the summer of 1994, SF Broadcasting (a recently formed joint venture between Fox and Savoy Pictures) purchased four stations from Burnham Broadcasting, which also became Fox affiliates between September 1995 and January 1996. In the NFC markets affected by the deals, Fox gained VHF affiliates in eight primary markets (Atlanta, Dallas, Detroit, Green Bay, New Orleans, Phoenix, St. Louis and Tampa) and three satellite markets (Austin, Greensboro and Milwaukee), adding to the four that the network had before the deal. The new affiliates in St. Louis and Greensboro switched shortly before the Rams relocated from Los Angeles and the Carolina Panthers began play with the 1995 preseason. Besides giving the network leverage in attracting new affiliates, the rights gave Fox many new viewers and a platform for advertising its other shows.\n\nFox's acquisition of the National Football Conference contract severely affected CBS, beyond losing a marquee sporting event and some of its key talent and production staff. Not only was it largely relegated to former Fox affiliates and lesser known independent stations in the markets affected by Fox's affiliation agreement with New World, but CBS' older-skewing programming slate caused it to struggle further in the ratings, pushing it to third place, ahead of fourth-place Fox. CBS had hoped to replace the NFL with National Hockey League rights, but Fox then promptly outbid CBS for those as well; in addition, Fox took over the rights to Major League Baseball in 1996, after the cancellation of The Baseball Network, which was a joint venture between NBC and ABC at the time and had replaced CBS two years prior. CBS began rebuilding itself after the network took the AFC television contract from NBC in 1998.\n\nFox's acquisition of National Football League television rights was a watershed event not only for the network, but for the NFL as well. Not only was it the event that placed Fox on a par with the \"Big Three\" broadcast networks, but it also ushered in an era of growth for the NFL, which continues on largely to this day. While the heavy concentration of major cities in NFC markets – as opposed to the smaller markets generally served by the AFC – virtually guaranteed a substantial audience, its instant success has nonetheless been remarkable given the differences between Fox's coverage and the coverage provided by ABC, CBS, ESPN, TNT and NBC up to that time.\n\nFox used the slogan \"Same Game, New Attitude\" to promote its new NFL package (it did the same for its new Major League Baseball coverage in 1996). The network's pre-game show, \"Fox NFL Sunday\" focused more on entertainment and less on in-depth discussion of game strategy. Fox's NFL coverage also introduced bolder and innovative graphics, for instance, the FoxBox, a continuous on-screen time-and-score graphic that Hill had originally used on Sky Sports's coverage of the Premier League. It also used parabolic microphones to include the sounds of the stands and of the on-field action (including conversations and strategy outlines between coaches and players). These innovations were adopted by rival networks and helped to drive the development of further innovations such as the on-air display of virtual first-down and scrimmage lines.\n\nIn , John Madden, then of CBS awarded the first \"Turkey Leg Award\", for the Thanksgiving Day game's most valuable player. Pursuant to its name, it was an actual cooked turkey leg, and players typically took a celebratory bite out of the leg for the cameras during post-game interviews. The gesture was seen mostly as a humorous gimmick relating to Madden's famous multi-legged turkey, Madden brought the award to Fox in , and it continued through 2001. Because of the loose and informal nature of the award, at times it has been awarded to multiple players. On one occasion in 1994, it was given to players of both teams.\n\nThe Week 15, 1995 match-up between the Arizona Cardinals and the San Diego Chargers was part of an experiment by Fox where Terry Bradshaw and Jimmy Johnson provided analysis throughout the game with no play-by-play.\n\nAt the end of the 1996 season, Fox broadcast its first ever Super Bowl. Super Bowl XXXI would be the first of three Super Bowls to be called by Pat Summerall and John Madden while with Fox (Super Bowls XXXIII and XXXVI being the others). The telecast ended up being the highest-rated program in the history of the then ten-year-old Fox network, and it currently ties Super Bowl XLII for the highest-rated program in the entire history of the network. Fox's broadcast was also the first Super Bowl to have a constant, live-updating graphic for the score, time and down & distance. The FoxBox was used also in Super Bowl XXXIII, and the graphic positioned over live action has become the norm in virtually all sports broadcasts at the national and regional production levels.\n\nFollowing the 1997 season, Joe Buck did not call another NFL game on Fox until 2001. For Fox's first two years of NFL coverage, Buck was paired with Tim Green on the fourth-tier team. And in 1997, Buck was teamed with Bill Maas on the fourth-tier team. Between the 1998-2000 seasons, Buck would often be assigned to working at \"Fox NFL Sunday\" studio for halftime coverage whenever the main pregame crew was on the road. Kevin Harlan left Fox after this season to join the \"NFL on CBS\". Harlan and Bill Maas anchored Fox's halftime coverage for Week 6, as the \"Fox NFL Sunday\" crew did the pregame show from Green Bay's Lambeau Field.\n\nIn 1998, Fox had a broadcast of the Washington Redskins/Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for Week 16. On the day the game was supposed to be broadcast, President Bill Clinton was impeached by Congress and Fox broke into local programming to cover the events. The football game (called by Sam Rosen and Jerry Glanville) began as scheduled and was shown in split screen. Jerry Glanville left Fox after this season to join \"The NFL Today\" on CBS.\n\nFor Fox's coverage of Super Bowl XXXIII at the end of the 1998 season, the starting lineups were shown using a virtual TV. To TV viewers, it appeared as if the end zone opened up and a giant TV came up out of the ground. The virtual TV displayed video announcing the starting lineups. The virtual TV effect was provided by PVI Virtual Media Services using their L-VIS virtual graphics system.\n\n2001 was the final year of commentating NFL games full-time for Pat Summerall, as his retirement was announced earlier that year. 2001 was also John Madden's last year of commentating on Fox, as he moved to ABC to commentate on \"Monday Night Football\" alongside Al Michaels. Madden would soon become the first person to announce Super Bowls on different networks in consecutive years when he called Super Bowl XXXVII on ABC with Michaels.\n\nFox's telecast of Super Bowl XXXVI was presented in a 480p enhanced-definition format marketed as \"Fox Widescreen\". While promoted as having better quality than standard-definition, and being the first U.S. sporting event produced in a widescreen format with the same production as the main feed for standard-definition viewers (rather than using a separate production for the widescreen feed), it was not true high definition, but still matched the aspect ratio of HDTV sets. As previously alluded to, this was Summerall's 26th and final Super Bowl broadcast on television or radio. It was also the eighth and final Super Bowl telecast (and final NFL telecast of any kind) for the Summerall and Madden announcing team. The two had become the NFL's most famous broadcast duo since they were paired together in 1981 on CBS.\n\nJoe Buck, Troy Aikman, and Cris Collinsworth replaced Pat Summerall and John Madden as the number 1 announcing team. Summerall however, would continue to work for Fox in 2002, calling almost all Dallas Cowboys games alongside Brian Baldinger. One notable exception was in Week 8, when Summerall called the Cowboys-Seattle game alongside Daryl Johnston and Baldinger worked the Arizona-San Francisco game alongside Kenny Albert. At this point, it would become common practice for Joe Buck to take time off from calling NFL games in order to cover postseason baseball for Fox.\n\nWhen John Madden left Fox after 2001, the network introduced a new award for their Thanksgiving Day telecast starting in 2002, named the \"Galloping Gobbler.\" It was represented by a small figurine of a cartoonish, silver turkey wearing a football helmet striking a Heisman-like pose. Much like Cleatus and Digger, the original Galloping Gobbler trophy reflected Fox's irreverent mascots, and went through several iterations. Unimpressed by its tackiness after having won four Turkey Legs in the 1990s, the inaugural winner, Emmitt Smith, famously threw the 2002 award into a trash can.\n\nFollowing the 2004 season, Cris Collinsworth left Fox Sports. After sitting out the 2005 season, he returned to NBC Sports for the 2006 season. For the 2006 season (the first after James Brown left to return to CBS as host of \"The NFL Today\"), Fox experimented with a traveling pre-game show, hosted by Joe Buck from the site of the game to which he was assigned. The halftime and postgame shows were hosted by Curt Menefee. During Week 14 of the regular season, Thom Brennaman, Charles Davis and Barry Alvarez took over the #4 team for Sam Rosen and Tim Ryan.\n\nDuring Weeks 6–8 of the 2006 regular season, Dick Stockton filled in for Joe Buck, during the MLB playoffs. And during Weeks 6–8 of that same regular season, Kenny Albert filled in for Stockton, who was filling in for Buck. During Weeks 6–8 of the 2007 regular season, Kenny Albert filled in for Buck, during the MLB playoffs. During Week 6 and 7 of the 2007 regular season, Matt Vasgersian filled in for Albert, who was filling in for Buck. During Week 7 of the 2007 regular season, Matt Devlin filled in for Vasgersian, who was filling in Albert. And during Week 8 of the 2007 regular season, Thom Brennaman filled in for Albert, who was filling in for Buck.\n\nNovember 8, 2009 (Week 9) featured a special two-hour pregame show originating in Afghanistan. The regular \"Fox NFL Sunday crew\" hosted the pregame show; Chris Rose served as studio host and anchored in-game highlights. John Lynch and Trent Green served as studio analysts for the halftime and postgame reports.\n\n2010 was Chris Rose's final season calling NFL games for Fox until he departed for MLB Network. Rose was a part of the eighth-tier team with Ross Tucker. During Week 5 of the regular season, Chris Myers filled in for Dick Stockton, who was calling MLB playoffs for TBS. Myers also filled in for in for Rose during Weeks 11 and 13 of the regular season. At this point, Joe Buck, Troy Aikman, and Pam Oliver became Fox's longest-tenured broadcast team, surpassing the team of Pat Summerall and John Madden. During Weeks 6-8 of the regular season, Thom Brennaman filled in for Buck during the MLB playoffs. During Weeks 15-17 of the regular season Charles Davis filled in for Jim Mora, who accepted the head coaching job at UCLA Bruins in 2012.\n\nDuring Week 6 of the 2012 regular season, Thom Brennaman was set to call the New York Giants vs. San Francisco 49ers football game instead of Joe Buck, who was scheduled to call the National League Championship Series. Sam Rosen was scheduled to fill in for Thom Brennaman while Brennaman filled in for Buck. However, Fox Sports president Eric Shanks brought up the idea of a two sport, same-day doubleheader if both San Francisco and St. Louis won their divisional series. When St. Louis beat Washington on Friday night, Buck went to San Francisco instead of Washington, D.C. and called both the 49ers football game and the Giants baseball game.\n\nFox did not send its #2 team of Kenny Albert, Daryl Johnston, and Tony Siragusa to cover the playoffs in 2012, marking the first time since Fox acquired NFL rights that they did this. Instead the #3 team of Thom Brennaman and Brian Billick were in the booth for the Divisional Playoffs, as they called the Seattle Seahawks at Atlanta Falcons match-up. Chris Myers joined the Brennaman/Billick/Laura Okmin crew during the NFC Playoffs.\n\nAfter the 2012 season, Ron Pitts left Fox Sports after being part of the NFL broadcast team for 18 years and joined \"OK!TV\". Kevin Burkhardt replaced him. The following year, Burkhardt, John Lynch, and Pam Oliver and Chris Myers called the Divisional Playoff game between the New Orleans Saints and the Seattle Seahawks. Erin Andrews joined Pam Oliver as sideline reporter for Wild Card weekend, NFC Championship, Thanksgiving, and Super Bowl XLVIII.\n\nMeanwhile, Brian Billick was not offered a contract extension with the \"NFL on Fox\" after his contract expired after the 2013 season. Tim Ryan left Fox after 2013 when he accepted the job as the San Francisco 49ers radio color commentator. And Tom McCarthy left Fox after 2013 and joined rival CBS. David Diehl replaced Billick as Thom Brennaman's analyst, while Ronde Barber replaced Ryan as Chris Myers' analyst. For Week 7, Tim Brando replaced Mike Goldberg after Goldberg performed poorly during a Week 6 game and cursed out his critics on Twitter.\n\nDuring Weeks 6–8 of the 2013 season, Thom Brennaman filled in for Joe Buck, Sam Rosen filled in for Kevin Burkhardt, and Charissa Thompson filled in for Erin Andrews; Joe Buck, Kevin Burkhardt, and Erin Andrews were all on \"Fox Major League Baseball\" playoff duty. Meanwhile, Justin Kutcher filled in for Thom Brennaman. During Week 13 of the 2013 season, Dick Stockton, Brady Quinn, and Kristina Pink were assigned college football responsibilities, leading to a makeshift #6 team. As the rotational broadcaster Brennaman was moved down to fill in for Stockton. He was joined by Donovan McNabb and Charissa Thompson. Kutcher once again filled in for Brennaman. In Week 15, Kutcher again filled in for Brennaman because this time, Brennaman had voice problems.\n\nIn 2015, Charles Davis replaces David Diehl as Thom Brennaman's analyst. Meanwhile, Sam Rosen replaced Mike Goldberg and Tim Brando on the #7 team. Kirk Morrison moved down to the #7 team and was joined by Chris Cooley and Matt Millen as rotating analysts. Laura Okmin and Tony Siragusa swapped broadcast teams as sideline reporters/analysts, joining the #3 and #4 teams, respectively. Holly Sonders joined the #3 and #5 team as a rotating sideline reporter. Danielle Trotta joined Peter Schrager as a rotating reporter for the #7 broadcast team. Brady Quinn moved down to the #8 team, where he was joined by his CFB broadcast partner Joe Davis. On September 27, 2015, Richard Deitsch of SI.com reported that, \"in an effort to get Holly Sonders reps as an NFL sideline reporter\", Fox Sports management pulled various assignments they had originally given Laura Okmin and Jennifer Hale on the #3 and #5 teams, respectively, and reassigned them to Sonders. The 2015 season marked Tony Siragusa's final season with Fox.\n\nDuring Weeks 5–8 of the 2015 season, Sam Rosen filled in for Kevin Burkhardt while Burkhardt worked the studio shows for Fox's MLB Playoff coverage. During Week 5, Justin Kutcher filled in for Kenny Albert while Albert worked the American League Division Series between Texas and Toronto. During Weeks 6 and 8 Thom Brennaman filled in for Joe Buck, Kutcher filled in for Thom Brennaman, and Peter Schrager filled in for Erin Andrews during the MLB Playoffs.\n\nDuring Week 5 of the 2016 season, Kenny Albert had been scheduled to work the Los Angeles-Washington National League Division Series series and the Redskins-Ravens game. Both events occurred 40 miles apart from Friday to Sunday. Rain postponed the Game 2 of the NLDS to Sunday and Fox kept Albert on baseball coverage, with Sam Rosen taking his place alongside Daryl Johnston. Sam Rosen remained with Daryl Johnston in Weeks 6–8, while Kenny Albert was elevated to the #2 team with John Lynch. The 2016 season was John Lynch's last with Fox as he leave to become the general manager of the San Francisco 49ers. During Week 8, Matt Smith filled in for Sam Rosen on #7 broadcast team during the MLB Playoffs. Rosen was with the #2 team in London, filling in for Kevin Burkhardt. During Weeks 6–8, Thom Brennaman filled in for Joe Buck while the latter called the NLCS and World Series. Justin Kutcher took Brennaman's place on the #4 announcing crew.\n\nDuring Weeks 5–8 of the 2017 season, Kenny Albert filled in for Kevin Burkhardt while Burkhardt worked the studio shows for Fox's MLB Playoff coverage. During Weeks 5–8, Sam Rosen filled in for Kenny Albert while he was with the #2 team. During Weeks 6–8, Thom Brennaman, for the 9th straight year, filled in for Joe Buck while the latter called the ALCS and World Series. Either Dan Hellie or Justin Kutcher took Thom Brennaman's place on the #4 announcing crew. Originally, Jay Cutler was slated to join Kevin Burkhardt and Charles Davis. Cutler ended up coming out of retirement for 2017, signing with the Miami Dolphins due to the injury of Ryan Tannehill.\n\nAlso in 2017, Ronde Barber and Daryl Johnston switched broadcast teams; Barber joined Kenny Albert and Johnston joined Chris Myers. Chris Spielman became Thom Brennaman's permanent broadcast partner. However, he became Dan Hellie's temporary partner for Weeks 6 and 7 and Justin Kutcher's temporary partner for Week 8. David Diehl became Sam Rosen's permanent partner except for Week 14 when Brady Quinn joined Rosen and for Week 17 when Matt Millen joined him. Greg Jennings became Tim Brando's temporary partner for the Buccaneers-Packers game on Week 13. Meanwhile, Mark Schlereth joined Fox Sports this year and became Dick Stockton's broadcast partner.\nMike Pereira, who previously served as offsite rules analyst, moved to an on-site role with the lead broadcast team for select games. Dean Blandino, who recently resigned from his title as VP of Officiating earlier in the year, replaced Pereira as rules analyst when Pereira was on those select games.\n\nDuring Week 8 of the 2018 season, for the first time, Thom Brennaman filled in for Kenny Albert as the number 3 team while Joe Buck did the World Series from Dodger Stadium, 5 miles away. Buck remained on \"Thursday Night Football\", going to Houston on the World Series' travel day from Boston to Los Angeles, but he waived the opportunity for a same-day, two-sport doubleheader on Sunday over concerns about getting from one venue to the other in L.A. traffic. With Kristina Pink moving to a co-sideline reporter for \"Thursday Night Football\", the #3 team of Kenny Albert/Ronde Barber had rotating sideline reporters throughout the season.\n\nBeginning in 2005, Fox's post-game show was expanded to an hour-long slot (regularly scheduled at 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time) and branded as \"The OT\" (a possibly intentional nod to the title of the Fox drama series \"The O.C.\"), competing against NBC's primetime pregame \"Football Night in America\". The program, in addition to providing analysis of the day's NFL games, sends viewers to the remaining ongoing regional games after their main game ends (or meets the NFL's rules regarding a switch to a more compelling matchup, outside of home markets) until the end of the last game.\n\nFox had previously scheduled first-run sitcoms, the comedic video series \"The World's Funniest!\", and animated series in the 7:00 p.m. hour during the NFL season, but these were often subjected to pre-emption (resulting in episodes being delayed by one week or more) due to overruns of late afternoon games into the hour, which impacted their ratings performance; as a result of the postgame show's expansion, the network generally delayed carriage of first-run programming during the first hour of Sunday prime time to midseason (one exception was the freshman sitcom \"Mulaney\" in 2014, which was pushed to the hour that November due to struggling ratings in its original 9:30 Eastern slot), primarily limited to burn-offs of already failed series.\n\nAfter the 2005 season, James Brown left Fox to return to CBS Sports, where he would become the host of the CBS network's NFL pregame show \"The NFL Today\". On August 16, 2006, after weeks of speculation, the network officially announced that Joe Buck would take over the role as host vacated by Brown. The move also resulted in the show switching from being broadcast from a permanent Los Angeles studio to a portable studio configuration, similar to the pregame show for \"NASCAR on Fox\", in which analysts Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson joined Buck at the stadium site to which Buck is assigned as play-by-play announcer for one of that week's telecasts. Curt Menefee worked all halftime shows and all postgame shows on Sundays when no doubleheader was scheduled, also from the same game site with the same analysts. Menefee hosted \"Fox NFL Sunday\" during the several weeks in October when Buck was not available; during that time, Buck called Major League Baseball postseason games, including the World Series. The pregame shows on October 15, 22 and 29 were broadcast from the Los Angeles studios; the show returned to the road on November 5.\n\nIt was also announced that weather reporter Jillian Barberie (now Jillian Reynolds) would not return for the coming season, as Barberie wished to stay at home in Los Angeles with her family. Barberie did participate in at least one of the studio shows. During the 2006 season, Chris Rose provided narrated updates highlighting other NFL games during the Fox broadcasts from the Los Angeles studio.\n\nOn November 17, 2006, a source told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that the final two pregame shows of the 2006 season would take place in the Los Angeles studios, with Buck hosting and Dick Stockton taking Buck's place on play-by-play duties at the games alongside Troy Aikman. The source cited that declining ratings no longer justified its high production costs, including security expenses. A Fox spokesman would only say that changes were being considered.\n\nAfter the 2006 NFL season, \"Fox NFL Sunday\" returned to the Los Angeles studio throughout the entire 2007 regular season and for the two weeks of that year's postseason. Curt Menefee became the full-time host of the pregame show, while Joe Buck reverted to strictly handling play-by-play duties.\n\nFox presented a limited Monday night game between the New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings on December 13, 2010. The game had been originally scheduled to be played on the afternoon on December 12, but due to the collapse of the roof of the Metrodome early that morning due to weight from heavy snowpack, the game was moved on short notice to Ford Field in Detroit as that facility already had their full television setup still in place after a Packers–Lions game. Fox Sports had kept their cameras on in the Metrodome overnight the night before the originally scheduled game day and captured the stadium roof collapse in full detail; the video of the early morning collapse, captured at multiple angles, aired on that day's edition of \"Fox NFL Sunday\" and quickly went viral.\n\nThe game was only made available on the main Fox stations in the New York and Twin Cities media markets; owned-and-operated station WNYW and affiliate WXXA-TV aired the game in the New York City and Albany television markets, while Minneapolis–St. Paul owned-and-operated station KMSP-TV, and affiliates KXLT-TV in Rochester and KQDS-TV in Duluth, Minnesota carried the game for the Vikings' markets. The game was also carried on satellite provider DirecTV through its NFL Sunday Ticket package.\n\nCoincidentally, this was the first game since 1992 that Brett Favre did not start an NFL game, as he was placed on the inactive list due to a shoulder injury, ending his streak of 297 consecutive regular season games; Tarvaris Jackson started in his place and subsequently Joe Webb had his first ever down in an NFL game. In addition, it was the first ever regular-season Monday night game in Ford Field.\n\nThis was the first time that either CBS or Fox produced a Monday night game that would only be broadcast in the markets of the competing teams; a similar situation would later happen on November 24, 2014, when CBS televised a Monday night game between the New York Jets and the Buffalo Bills that was relocated from Ralph Wilson Stadium to Ford Field due to a major lake-effect snowstorm that affected Western New York.\n\nOn December 14, 2011, the NFL, along with Fox, NBC and CBS, and ESPN announced that the league had extended rights deal with all three networks through the 2022 season. The three-network rights deal includes the continued yearly rotation of the Super Bowl between Fox, NBC and CBS, meaning that Fox would air Super Bowls XLVIII (2014), LI (2017), LIV (2020), and LVII (2023). The contract included a new \"cross-flexing\" policy introduced in 2014, under which a limited number of all-AFC games normally assigned to CBS may now be moved to Fox, and vice versa with NFC games.\n\nOn January 31, 2018, the NFL announced that Fox had acquired the broadcast television rights to the \"Thursday Night Football\" package from 2018 through 2022. Fox will air eleven games per season in simulcast with NFL Network, replacing CBS and NBC. Fox will reportedly pay an average of $660 million per season for this package.\n\nThe iconic \"NFL on Fox\" theme music was composed by Scott Schreer; at the time of its introduction, Schreer considered the theme to be a contrast to other television sports themes, as it carried a dark, orchestral, and cinematic sound. The music was partially inspired by the opening theme of Tim Burton's 1989 \"Batman\" film; Fox Sports president David Hill had heard the theme while waiting in line for a \"Batman\" ride at an amusement park in California, and suggested to creative director George Greenberg (who had recently defected to Fox from ABC Sports) in a phone call that the overlying theme for Fox's NFL theme music should be \"Batman plays football\". Greenberg would enlist Schreer to compose the theme, describing Hill's request as sounding like \"\"Batman\" on steroids\". Schreer and his team pitched three separate songs to Greenberg and Hill, who then spliced them together into one for the final version.\n\nBeginning at the 2010 National League Championship Series, the \"NFL on Fox\" theme became the official theme music for all Fox Sports broadcasts, regardless of sport. In particular, current Fox Sports president Eric Shanks believed that the special theme music it had previously used for post-season baseball was not upbeat enough, and that the change would \"[give] all of our sports sort of that marquee feel and it gives us a more upbeat way to come on the air.\" The change also resulted in the removal of the long-time \"Major League Baseball on Fox\" theme (also composed by Schreer). In 2018-2019 \"Fox College Hoops\" started to use \"Roundball Rock\" (the John Tesh composition that is best known as the \"NBA on NBC\" theme from 1990 to 2002) for games on the FOX network, after previously sharing the CFB on FOX theme for college football broadcasts, which still use the latter theme.\n\nAs of September 27, 2018 starting with Fox's first \"Thursday Night Football\" broadcast, the \"NFL on Fox\" theme music is used on \"TNF\" games aired on Fox and NFL Network, mainly for the pregame and halftime studio show.\n\nSchreer's music for \"NFL on Fox\" was also used for the NFL coverage on Sky Sports between 2013 and 2018.\n\nIn December 2010, Fox experimented with using an in-game soundtrack during a regional game between the Arizona Cardinals and Carolina Panthers. The following week on December 16, Fox publicly announced that it would also feature it during a game on December 20 between the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks. Fox Sports president Eric Shanks revealed that \"\" composer Jeff Cardoni had contributed music for the experiment, and saw potential in the concept, explaining that \"just like music in movies, you have to use it at the right times. And imagine trying to score a movie the first time you're seeing it.\" The concept was met with mixed reaction; sports blogger Michael David Smith believed that the music was \"goofy\", distracting and added nothing to the game.\n\nWhen its NFL telecasts debuted in the 1994 season, Fox's coverage featured the first \"scoring bug.\" Originally appearing as a transparent white half-capsule-shaped graphic in the upper left corner of the screen, it displayed the score and game clock throughout the entire telecast, a first for an NFL television broadcast.\n\nBy 1996, the graphic changed to a full-statistics panel, where down and distance, penalty, and key in-game statistics would pop in and out when necessary. The basic design of the scoring bug, which was named the \"FoxBox\", mimicked the version used on Fox's MLB coverage. For Fox's coverage of Super Bowl XXXIII at the end of the 1998 season, the starting lineups were shown using a virtual television. To television viewers, the effect appeared as if the end zone opened up and a giant television screen rose from the ground. The virtual television display showed video announcing the starting lineups. The virtual television effect was provided by PVI Virtual Media Services using its L-VIS virtual graphics system.\n\nFor the 2001 season, NFL telecasts began using the same graphics that were previously introduced on Fox's NASCAR and Major League Baseball coverage. The graphics package was an updated version of the 1998 design, but the FoxBox changed from a compact bug to a banner spanning the top of the screen, and included a scrolling graphic displaying real-time scores of other games in progress. A simple black rectangle with a shaded translucent area spanned the top of the screen from left to right, displaying the abbreviations of both teams in white. The scores were shown in white boxes next to the team. The center showed the game clock in white, to its right was the quarter (\"1st QTR\", \"2nd QTR\", etc.), and to the right of the quarter was the play clock; the \"NFL on Fox\" logo was on the far right. First seen during Super Bowl XXXVI and used full-time for the 2002 season, the white scoring boxes were re-colored to yellow. This was also the last year that the score graphic used an effect in which a team's initials flashed in its two primary colors accompanied by percussive sound beats when that team scored (for example, when the Green Bay Packers scored a touchdown during a Fox telecast, the \"GB\" initials and box would flash in green and gold for a few seconds as the six points for the TD were added, then again with the extra point). This banner was used for \"Major League Baseball on Fox\" broadcasts through most of the 2004 season.\n\nFor the 2003 season, Fox's NFL coverage debuted a new graphics package.\n\nInstead of being a large black rectangle consistently, the score banner alternated between a large black rectangle and several small, black parallelograms, and the shaded area above it was removed. Team logos were now used, in place of their abbreviations. During the 2003 NFL playoffs however, the logos were removed and the team abbreviations were rendered again in white lettering in the team's main color.\n\nThe banner returned to a large black rectangle at the start of the 2004 season. The team logos returned, this time looking more \"three-dimensional\" in appearance and with their respective abbreviations beside the logos. Electronic eggcrate in the team's primary color was used whenever that certain team calls timeout, scores a touchdown, or a field goal. It would be shown in red whenever the team challenges a play. In addition during a touchdown or field goal, the right side of the banner would have a split flashing \"light\", then the words \"TOUCHDOWN or FIELD GOAL (team)\" in the same electronic lettering scrolling left.\n\nMidway through 2004, the team logos were once again replaced with the abbreviations. First seen on the network's Major League Baseball postseason broadcasts that year, this time, they were rendered in electronic eggcrate lettering in the team's main color. When team-specific information was displayed in the banner, such as the hang time of a punt or a touchdown, the abbreviation would revert to the team's logo. During the 2005 holiday season, for the Week 15 Saturday game (between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New England Patriots), a new white banner, resembling a chrome finish (first introduced at the start of Fox's coverage of the 2005 World Series) debuted, with animated snow accumulating on top with an animated snowplow periodically clearing the snow from the screen. The following week, the new banner was adopted for all games, however without the snow animation. The team abbreviations became white letters against the team's main color. This banner was used for \"Major League Baseball on Fox\" broadcasts through the 2007 season.\n\nFox Sports again unveiled a new graphics package for its NFL coverage at the start of the 2006 season. The score banner began featuring the real-time scores as a permanent fixture on the extreme right side, while the coloring of the banner changes to the colors of the team currently possessing the ball. During playoff games and games featured on days other than the network's traditional game broadcast days or holidays (such as the Thanksgiving Day AFC/NFC game), the scoring bar instead shows either the NFL Thanksgiving logo, the NFL Divisional Playoffs/NFC Championship logo Super Bowl XLII, or a special banner with a message from Fox Sports observing whichever holiday falls during that week (for instance, confetti and a party horn with a traditional \"Happy New Year\" message). During BCS on Fox Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, Cotton Bowl Classic and BCS National Championship Game.\nAt the beginning of the 2006 season, a virtual on-field graphic showing an arrow pointing towards the direction of advancement and the down/yardage information began to be used on all plays. This feature was then added by CBS, NBC, NFL Network (for its \"Run to the Playoffs\" game telecasts) and (beginning with the 2008 season) ESPN. At the same time, the down/yardage information is also displayed on the scoring banner, resulting in duplicate presentation of the same information. The bar was also enhanced for high definition and is thinner than previous versions, with little translucency. The \"NFL on Fox\" logo was also repositioned to the far left instead of the far right. During high definition broadcasts, the area above the banner features a translucent slanting pattern going from left-to-right across the screen. During the 2006 preseason telecasts, the quarter was indicated by four illuminating buttons (the number of buttons that were lit indicated the quarter being played), but due to difficulties in visibility, the quarter returned to being numerically represented for the regular season. On the rare occasion during a game in which the field lines are not visible (such as those dealing with snow or rain), a small bug pops up on the bottom left side of the screen with the logo of the team that is currently in possession as well as text indicating where the ball is (e.g., Arizona-Own 41 Yard Line).\n\nBeginning on November 15, 2009 (Week 11 of the 2009 season), scores from other ongoing NFL games that appear on the right side of the banner would have an arrow indicating which team was in possession of the ball; a red arrow indicated that the team is at the red zone. Fox's NFL telecasts were the only major telecasts of the league's games to not feature timeout indicators until the 2010 season, save for the number of timeouts that each team has on the right side of the banner.\n\nThere was one exception to this package for the 2006 season, as Fox had to revert to the then-current scoring banner and graphics package used by Fox Sports Net (and formerly the main one used by Fox Sports) for its final regular season game of the year, the San Francisco 49ers vs. the Denver Broncos on December 31, 2006, due to a blizzard (the second to occur in the span of a week) hitting Denver, preventing the usual amount of equipment for Fox's NFL coverage to arrive before the game. FSN Rocky Mountain (the FSN network that served the Denver market at the time, since replaced by AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain) assisted in the production of the game on short notice by providing the graphical production and other production services. In addition, the \"1st & Ten\" graphic lines denoting the line of scrimmage and first down line were unavailable for this broadcast. This graphic was also used in Week 5 of the 2007 season in a game between the Arizona Cardinals and St. Louis Rams.\n\nA new graphics package for Fox's NFL telecasts debuted during an August 19, 2010 pre-season game, as the network began to broadcast its sports programming with graphics optimized for 16:9 displays rather than the safe area, resulting in the network asking cable and satellite providers to comply and use the #10 Active Format Description code to send out over Fox programming, which displays 16:9 content in a letterboxed format on 4:3 screens (largely on the analog affiliate feed carried by the provider), in concert with Fox News Channel and its related news productions for the Fox network also switching to full widescreen presentation. This was promoted during that first game by the Fox broadcast team as giving a \"widescreen viewing experience\" to standard definition viewers, using the usual examples of more video information on the screen to demonstrate the new presentation (such as two cheerleaders off to the side displayed in a widescreen shot, but cut out of a 4:3 shot).\n\nThe graphics package is an upgraded version of the 2006 design with a \"much more colorful 3D look\", implemented using a new infrastructure using products developed by Vizrt, which was also rolled out to other Fox Sports networks in subsequent months. The score banner previously used was replaced by an unconventional FoxBox-styled layout, positioned in the top left corner of the screen, with team logos and scores on either side, lights indicating timeouts on the side rims, with the play clock and quarter positioned in the center. Initially, the play clock also appeared within the center area with 10 seconds remaining, sliding the time remaining in the quarter upward. However, the play clock indicator was soon moved to the bar sliding out of the bottom to show downage.\n\nDue to issues with some cable providers and Fox affiliates (particularly those carried by digital subchannels or low-power analog television stations) in implementing the AFD #10 widescreen mode, or for other broadcasters that still broadcast with content framed for 4:3 displays instead of defaulting to 16:9 like Fox (such as CBS and NBC, along with ESPN and NFL Network until they also switched to 16:9 with letterboxed SD feeds), feeds of Fox's NFL games have been offered with graphics positioned for 4:3 displays instead of 16:9, and in most cases, only one game per week was broadcast with 16:9 graphics.\n\nSmall tweaks were made for the 2011 season, including the timeout indicators counting upward instead of downward, and the possession indicator now appearing alongside the team that currently is in possession of the ball. Additionally, the scoreboard next to the Fox Sports bug for other ongoing NFL games was replaced by a traditional ticker; the bug was made slightly smaller and rounder as well. Special holiday animations also appeared with the banner package; digitally animated leaves fell on top of the FoxBox on Thanksgiving, while falling snow piles on top during the last two weeks of December in observance of the Christmas and holiday season, with the timeout indicators being changed in the latter instance to resemble strings of Christmas lights.\n\nAfter two years of using the unconventional layout, for 2012, a more traditional FoxBox was introduced; team abbreviations (in the team's primary color) are stacked on the left side of the box, with timeout lights positioned underneath each team abbreviation, and a possession indicator to the left of it. The clock/quarter indicator is on the right side. Down and distance pops out of the bottom, while the timeout/penalty/touchdown animation is the same as in the unconventional design of the previous two seasons. Also for the 2012 season, Fox began providing play-by-play commentary of all games in Spanish on its second audio program channel. In 2013, in observance of the holiday season, Christmas lights returned to the FoxBox along the sides of the graphic, but they no longer correspond to timeouts. When a team scores, calls a timeout or gets called on a penalty, the lights change from red, green and blue to the corresponding team's color for the duration of the graphic, before returning to the normal colors.\n\nFor the 2014 season, the graphics were changed to match those that had previously been introduced on Fox Sports's Major League Baseball and NASCAR coverage. The graphics package itself is similar to the previous look, however with a more boxy appearance, and the fonts used are rounder and have less of an athletic appearance than previous packages used by Fox. The layout of the score box is essentially a mirror image of the already-introduced MLB graphic, except that the NFL version is on the top-left of the screen, while the baseball version was originally on the bottom-left (it was moved to the bottom-right beginning in 2016). Like the MLB graphic, the box has two components: a main box and a dynamic strip. The main box contains the team abbreviations, stacked on top of the team scores. The possession indicator is a line above the team holding the ball; timeout indicators, which are counting downward, are stacked next to the scores. This unconventional layout of displaying the scores (also used in 2010 and 2011) is only used for NFL coverage; college football and MLB coverage use the traditional layout with the team abbreviations to the left of the scores.\n\nThe dynamic strip normally shows the next down that will occur, such as \"3rd Down\". It changes to show down and distance and the play clock, and turns yellow if a flag is thrown. When a score occurs, the dynamic strip disappears and the main box changes to show the logo of the team scoring, along with the type of score (\"TOUCHDOWN\", \"FIELD GOAL\", \"SAFETY\"). For a penalty, the main box shows the logo of the offending team, while the dynamic strip turns yellow and displays the type of penalty. When a timeout is called, the dynamic strip turns to the color of the team taking the timeout and displays \"Timeout\", while the main box displays the team's logo over a neutral gray background. After a few seconds, the main box returns to the scores and a small gray box with the team logo appears next to the word \"Timeout\" in the dynamic strip.\n\nFor a review or a challenge, the dynamic strip moves from the bottom to the right side of the main box and turns red, displaying whether it is a challenge, an official review, or a scoring review. When the decision is announced, the strip expands to show the result of the review on a yellow background. After a few seconds, the strip shifts back to the bottom of the main box and if a timeout is charged on a lost challenge, the strip shows the team charged with the timeout.\n\nFor regular season games only, beginning with Week 3 of 2016, the record for each team was added to the box, making the team abbreviations of each team smaller.\n\nFox gradually worked elements of a new square-edged graphics package with thinner fonts into secondary situations during the 2016 season. This package (in white instead of black) was used for Fox's Super Bowl LI pregame, halftime, and post game shows, but the game broadcast itself continued to use the 2014 package. However, the translucent shading around the scoreboard was removed for the Super Bowl.\n\nStarting on August 27, 2017, after three years of using the unconventional layout from the previous graphics package, a new, traditional score bar was introduced. The score bug was moved from the top left to across the bottom of the screen and is now horizontal. Additionally, team names are displayed instead of their abbreviations and the clock is located towards the right of the bug and the down and distance is displayed on the far right. Also, timeout indicators are shown below the team names and the possession indicator, which was originally shown below the team's score (through Week 4 of the 2017 NFL season), is now shown above the team's score. When showing stats or player info, the score bug briefly moves to the bottom left of the screen then returns to its previous position. With this, all five of the NFL's broadcast partners (CBS, ESPN, Fox, NBC and NFL Network) now have score bars across the bottom of the screen, with Fox being the last of the five to make the switch.\n\nAs for the graphics package itself, it is an upgraded version of the 2014 design and eventually, it has rolled out on almost all of Fox Sports' properties, including Fox's college football and basketball coverage on Fox and FS1, the 2017 MLB postseason and on February 2018, \"NASCAR on Fox\".\n\nFor NFL playoff games and \"Thursday Night Football\", which Fox picked up in 2018, the yellow-and-black \"Fox NFL\" logo on-screen and on graphics and transitions is replaced by a blue-and-white \"Fox\" or \"Fox|NFL Network\" logo respectively. In some transitions, it is instead replaced by the full \"TNF presented by Bud Light\" logo. Fox also produces NFL Network exclusives on non-Fox/NBC Thursdays, on some Sunday mornings, and on late-season Saturdays; these games replace the \"Fox NFL\" logo with an NFL Network logo on a black square, the size of the \"Fox NFL\" logo.\n\nFormer New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski was hired by Fox Sports as an analyst for its NFL programming. He debuted on October 10, 2019 for the network's \"NFL Thursday Pregame Show\".\n\nDuring Super Bowl LIV, Fox introduced a new on-air appearance for its NFL and XFL broadcasts, replacing the previous rectangular appearance with a slanted motif. Some lower thirds incorporated use of fonts based on the teams' respective wordmark logos, and selected players were depicted in these and other graphics using stylized illustrations rather than traditional photos. The scoreboard was also changed to a more box-like appearance, showing only team logos, and with both teams positioned in opposing directions. Translucent strips were used to show quarterback statistics following each play. The graphics carried over to XFL broadcasts the next week when the league re-launched.\n\n\"Fox NFL Sunday\" had been the ratings leader among network pregame coverage from its debut in 1994 (as it was the only network pregame show at the time to air for one hour prior to kickoff). However, in 2006, \"NFL Sunday\" was overtaken in the ratings by CBS' \"The NFL Today\". The swing in ratings dominance was said to be correlated with the move of original \"Fox NFL Sunday\" host James Brown back to CBS, where he had been serving as a play-by-play broadcaster before his jump to Fox in 1994.\n\nThe network's NFL game telecasts have generally posted strong viewership. For the 2009 season, in particular, the network's NFL games scored an average rating of 16.827 million viewers. The Dallas Cowboys' Thanksgiving game against the Washington Redskins in 2016 was Fox's highest-rated regular-season game ever, with 35.1 million viewers.\n\nFox's telecast of Super Bowl XLII on February 3, 2008, between the New York Giants and New England Patriots, was the second-highest rated Super Bowl telecast ever, with 97.5 million viewers watching the broadcast. It was also the second-most-watched program in television history, behind the series finale of \"M*A*S*H\" in 1983.\n\nWith an average U.S. audience of 111 million viewers, Fox's February 6, 2011 telecast of Super Bowl XLV became the most-watched Super Bowl as well as the most-watched program of any kind in American television history, beating the previous record of 106.5 million viewers set the year prior for Super Bowl XLIV. The game drew an estimated 162.9 million total viewers that watched all or part of the game, and a national household rating of 46.0 and a 69 share. It drew a 59.7 local rating in both Milwaukee (on WITI) and Pittsburgh (on WPGH-TV), the second-highest local rating for a Super Bowl after the 63.0 that Super Bowl XX drew in the Chicago market. In the host market of Dallas–Fort Worth (on Fox owned-and-operated station KDFW), the game drew a 53.7 rating.\n\nThe Fox Broadcasting Company came under fire by the Parents Television Council for showing a New Orleans Saints fan wearing a shirt which read \"FUCK DA EAGLES\" in Saints colors. Three days after the broadcast, the network apologized for the incident. The Saints fan, Heather Rothstein, was contacted by \"Maxim\" and was given a photo shoot that appeared in the men's magazine.\n\nDuring the 2006 NFC Championship between the Chicago Bears and the New Orleans Saints at Soldier Field, in a shot taken from the overhead camera angle of the crowd, three Bears fans were seen giving an obscene gesture towards the field.\n\nOn October 14, 2014, Mike Goldberg (who mainly served as an announcer for the network's Ultimate Fighting Championship coverage at that time) voluntarily pulled himself from commentating duties for the October 19 Minnesota Vikings–Buffalo Bills game telecast, after engaging in a series of arguments, some laced with profanities, with various Twitter users. The impetus of Goldberg's response was the heavy criticism that he received on social media for committing verbal gaffes and other issues – including misidentifying and mispronouncing names of players and coaches from both teams – after commentating the October 12 game between the Vikings and Detroit Lions, which was the first time that Goldberg had called an NFL game for Fox.\n\nA spokesperson for Fox Sports said that Goldberg \"was quick to apologize for this unfortunate and regrettable situation and understands he made a mistake\" and would not call any NFL games for the network for the remainder of the 2014 season, as he was originally scheduled to conduct only those two games (Tim Brando crossed over from \"Fox College Football\" to fill in for Goldberg on the Vikings-Bills broadcast). Goldberg tweeted that the decision was mutually agreed upon between him and Fox Sports management, stating that he did not want to be \"a distraction on the upcoming broadcast\".\n\n\n"}

He was also a member of the Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans. During his career, Johnson was named to the Pro Bowl 7 times, named to 4 All-Pro teams and emerged as one of the NFL's most productive wide receivers of the 21st century.\n\nJohnson attended Miami Senior High School, where he graduated in 1999. He played high school football and was rated as one of the top prospects in the country. As a senior, Johnson caught 32 passes for 931 yards and was named a \"Parade\" All-American.\n\nJohnson enrolled at the University of Miami, where he was a standout wide receiver on the Miami Hurricanes football team from 2000 to 2002. He was co-MVP of the 2002 Rose Bowl, in which the Hurricanes defeated the Nebraska Cornhuskers by a score of 37–14 to cap an undefeated season and their fifth national championship. In that game, Johnson connected with quarterback Ken Dorsey for two touchdowns and 199 yards. Johnson finished his college career catching 92 passes for 1,831 yards (19.9-yard average) and 20 touchdowns. His 1,831 receiving yards is ranked fifth on the University of Miami's all-time career list.\n\nJohnson was inducted into the Miami Sports Hall of Fame on April 10, 2014 at a ceremony in Miami.\n\nWhile at Miami, Johnson also ran for the Hurricanes track and field team.

Also a top competitor in the 400 meters, he ran a career-best time of 46.47 seconds in the finals of the 2003 FHSAA Class 3A Championships.\n\n\"Source:\"\n\nJohnson was the number three overall pick in the 2003 NFL Draft by the Houston Texans. He severed ties with NFL agents Michael Huyghue and Jeff Moorad before hiring sports attorney Don West, Jr. to negotiate his rookie contract with the Texans. Johnson was signed to a six-year, $39 million contract and was able to start training camp on time due to a timely contract negotiation. His rookie contract included over $13.501 million in guaranteed compensation.\n\nIn Johnson's rookie season, he started and played in all 16 games, recording 66 receptions for 976 yards and four touchdowns. He also recorded five rushes for −10 yards. He was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team.\n\nJohnson's breakout year came in 2004 when he combined with Texans quarterback David Carr to record 79 catches for 1,142 yards and six touchdowns. He was selected to his first Pro Bowl in recognition of his successful season.\n\nIn the 2005 season, Johnson regressed. He only played 13 games due to injury and had 63 receptions with 688 yards and two touchdowns as the Texans finished a franchise-worst 2–14. When interviewed in 2012, Johnson said that he was frustrated with the team's struggles, even saying that at times he \"didn't want to get up and go to work\", but knew that with a new franchise, struggles were expected and he wanted to be there to see the team make the next step.\n\nJohnson returned from injury and started all 16 games. In Week 4, against the Miami Dolphins, he earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week with nine receptions for 101 yards and a touchdown. He led the NFL in receptions with 103 for 1,147 yards and five touchdowns and made his second Pro Bowl appearance.\n\nOn March 3, 2007, the Texans signed Johnson to a six-year extension; the deal was worth $60 million and includes $15 million in guarantees.\n\nIn 2007, Johnson missed seven games due to injury. He returned mid-season to finish with 851 receiving yards and a career-high eight receiving touchdowns. He led the league in receiving yards per game in 2007 with 95.6.\n\nFor his efforts in the month of October, Johnson earned AFC Offensive Player of the Month. he totaled 41 receptions for 593 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns. On December 14, 2008, Johnson recorded his first 200-yard game with 207 yards and one touchdown in the Texans' 13–12 win over their AFC South rival Tennessee Titans. Johnson finished the 2008 season recording career highs in receptions and receiving yards totaling 115 receptions for 1,575 yards (both of which lead the league) and touchdown receptions with eight. This same season, Johnson became the first player in NFL history to record seven games with at least 10 receptions. He was named to the Pro Bowl and was a First Team All-Pro.\n\nIn 2009, Johnson once again led the league in receiving yards with 1,569 on 101 receptions and a career-high nine touchdowns to lead the Texans to a 9–7 record, the first winning record in franchise history. Johnson joined Jerry Rice as the only two receivers since the merger to lead the league in receiving yards in consecutive seasons. However, the Texans narrowly missed the playoffs on tiebreakers to the Baltimore Ravens and New York Jets, who also finished with a 9–7 record but had better conference records. Once again, Johnson was named to both the Pro Bowl and the First Team All-Pro.\n\nOn August 4, 2010, Johnson became the highest paid wide receiver in NFL history when he signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him under contract through the 2016 season.\n\nIn Week 2, against the Washington Redskins, he had 12 receptions for 158 yards and a touchdown to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week. On November 28, 2010, against the Tennessee Titans, Johnson became the first player in NFL history to have 60 or more receptions in each of his first eight seasons. In the same game, he fought Tennessee Titans cornerback Cortland Finnegan. After being jammed hard off the line of scrimmage by Finnegan to the head and neck area repeatedly throughout the game, Johnson lost his temper and pulled off Finnegan's helmet. Finnegan then removed and threw Johnson's helmet down-field and was promptly thrown to the ground by his jersey. Johnson then proceeded to strike Finnegan on the back of his head and neck before being pulled away by the referee. Johnson and Finnegan were ejected from the game, but not suspended. Both were fined $25,000 for their unsportsmanlike actions. He was invited to the 2011 Pro Bowl, but the Texans finished 6–10 and missed the playoffs once again. He was ranked No. 7 his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.\n\nIn the first three weeks, Johnson had caught seven passes in each of the first three games for at least 90 yards per game and had two touchdown catches. However, just as running back Arian Foster had returned from a hamstring injury, Johnson suffered one of his own in Week 4 against the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the second quarter, as Johnson caught a pass from Matt Schaub, he went down untouched, grabbing his right hamstring. The injury caused him to miss nine games and playing limited snaps in the other three. Johnson finished the season with career-lows in games played (7), receptions (33), yards (492), and touchdowns (2), but the Texans, in their tenth season in the NFL, made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history by winning the AFC South Division with a 10–6 record.\nJohnson made his playoff debut against the Cincinnati Bengals on January 7, 2012. In the game, Johnson had five receptions for 90 yards, including a 40-yard touchdown catch. The Texans won 31–10 and advanced to the divisional round where they fell to the Baltimore Ravens 20–13. Johnson caught eight passes for 111 yards in the losing effort. He was ranked 15th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.\n\nOn October 14, 2012, Johnson became the first Texan in franchise history to reach the 10,000 receiving yards milestone during a \"Sunday Night Football\" loss to the Green Bay Packers in 2012.\n\nOn November 18, 2012, Johnson had the best game of his career in a Week 11 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He had 14 receptions for 273 yards in that game, including the 48-yard game-winning touchdown in overtime. His receiving total was ninth-most in a game in NFL history and was the most for any receiver since Terrell Owens had 283 yards for the San Francisco 49ers in 2000. On November 22, Johnson had nine receptions for 188 yards in a Week 12 victory, again in overtime, over the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving Thursday, crossing the 1,000 yards receiving mark for the sixth time in his career. Johnson set the NFL record for the highest receiving total in back-to-back games with 461 yards, beating the previous record of 450 yards set by Chad Johnson. Due to Johnson's efforts, he was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month.\n\nJohnson finished the 2012 NFL season second in receiving yards with a career-high 1,598 yards after Calvin Johnson and fourth in receptions with 112 receptions after Calvin Johnson, Brandon Marshall, and Wes Welker. Johnson had one of the best seasons of his career even though he played through a groin injury that limited his production during the first half of the season. Many analysts doubted he would not be able to return to top form after his injury in 2011 and his limited production during the first half of the season. Johnson had his third 1,500+ yard season in his career. He is tied with Marvin Harrison for the second-most 1,500+ yard seasons with 3, after Jerry Rice who has 4. Johnson was selected to play in the 2013 Pro Bowl, his sixth selection of his career. Johnson was voted onto the 2012 All-Pro Team's Second Team, his fifth All-Pro selection in his career. He was ranked 14th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.\n\nIn 2013, Johnson put together another solid season. He appeared in and started all 16 games for the Texans. He had 109 receptions for 1,407 yards and five touchdowns. He was named to his final Pro Bowl. He was ranked No. 21 by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.\n\nIn the 2014 season, Johnson appeared in, and started, 15 games. He had 85 receptions for 936 yards and three touchdowns in what was his final season with the Texans.\n\nOn March 2, 2015, Johnson was informed that he would not be starting for the Texans for the 2015 season. He was given permission to seek a trade and if unsuccessful, he requested to be cut. After failing to find a team willing to trade for Johnson, the Texans released him on March 9, 2015. He played 12 of his 14 NFL seasons with the Texans.\n\nOn March 11, 2015, Johnson agreed to a three-year, $21 million contract with the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nWith the retirement of Reggie Wayne, 34-year-old Johnson began the 2015 season as the NFL's active leader in receiving yards, which he remained until passed by Steve Smith Sr. in Week 4 of 2016. The best game of Johnson's 2015 season came against his former team, the Houston Texans, where he caught six passes for 77 yards and two touchdowns. Johnson was released on March 9, 2016. In his only season with the Colts, Johnson made 41 receptions for 503 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nOn July 29, 2016, Johnson agreed to a two-year contract with the Tennessee Titans. In his lone season with the Titans and final season in the NFL, he appeared in only eight games and started four. He had nine receptions for 85 yards and two touchdowns. One of his touchdowns was a fourth down game-winner against the Detroit Lions in Week 2 from Marcus Mariota.\n\nJohnson announced his retirement on October 31, 2016. On April 19, 2017, Johnson signed a one-day contract with the Texans so he could officially retire as a member of the team. During his farewell press conference he said his only regret was not bringing a championship to Houston and \"even when I was with the Colts and the Titans, my heart never left this place.\" On November 19, 2017, Johnson was the first-ever inductee into the Texans Ring of Honor.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2003, Johnson's rookie season, he founded the Andre Johnson Foundation for children and teens growing up in single-parent homes. He has a daughter, Kylie, who was born in February 2010.\n\nOn December 4, 2012, Johnson made headlines around the world when it was shared that he spent over $19,000 for kids aged 8–16 in Child Protective Services to have a shopping spree at Toys R' Us. Johnson's own foundation, the Andre Johnson Charitable Foundation, funded the spree. The shopping spree is an event that Johnson partakes in yearly; however, due to a photo of him holding up lengthy receipts, this was the first year the shopping spree generated worldwide attention. After the spree, Johnson also joined the Houston Police Department's Blue Santa program to surprise 800 students at Houston's Bastian Elementary School with Christmas presents.\n\n"}

He played college football for the University of Florida, and was recognized as a consensus All-American. He was drafted by the Houston Texans in the second round of the 2002 NFL draft, and also played for the New England Patriots, Denver Broncos, Washington Redskins and Miami Dolphins.\n\nGaffney was born in San Antonio, Texas. He attended William M. Raines High School in Jacksonville, Florida, and was a letterman for the Raines Vikings high school football team. In football, he was a two-year starter as a wide receiver, and as a junior in 1997, he caught the game-winning, fourth-quarter touchdown pass in the state championship game.\n\nGaffney accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Steve Spurrier's Florida Gators football team in 2000 and 2001. The Gators coaching staff decided to redshirt him as a true freshman in 1999. Gaffney became a prolific pass-catcher as a first-year starter for the Gators in 2000, and made the game-winning touchdown “catch” with fourteen seconds remaining to defeat the Tennessee Volunteers 27–23—a game that ultimately decided the 2000 winner of the Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Gaffney amassed 1,184 receiving yards and fourteen touchdown receptions in 2000, and another 1,191 and thirteen touchdowns in 2001.\n\nHe was a first-team All-SEC selection in 2000 and 2001; he was a \"College Football News\" first-team All-American after his redshirt freshman season in 2000, and was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American by the Associated Press, American Football Coaches Association, Football Writers Association of America, \"Sporting News\", and Walter Camp Foundation following his 2001 sophomore season. In 2001, he was one of the three finalists for the Biletnikoff Award, recognizing the best receiver in college football. He finished his two-season college career with 138 receptions for 2,375 yards and twenty-seven touchdowns, and was chosen by his teammates as the Gators' most valuable player. He remains the only receiver in Gators history with two seasons of 1,000 yards or more.\n\nGaffney was selected with the 1st pick in the 2nd round of the 2002 NFL draft by the Houston Texans. His tenure with the team was marred by his often inconsistent play which led to his benching in favor of veteran receivers, in particular Corey Bradford. After his rookie contract was up, the Texans chose not to re-sign him.\n\nOn March 16, 2006, the Eagles signed Gaffney to a one-year contract. He was released before the start of the season.\n\nGaffney signed a two-year deal with the New England Patriots on October 9, 2006. On March 5, 2008, Gaffney re-signed with the Patriots for one year worth $2 million.\n\nIn his first-ever , on January 7, 2007 against the New York Jets, Gaffney had a caught eight passes for 104 yards, his second 100-yard performance as a receiver (in ten regular season games, Gaffney caught 11 passes for 142 yards and one touchdown.) Gaffney followed that performance a week later against San Diego with another 100-yard game, in which he caught ten passes and scored a touchdown.\n\nGaffney finished the 2008 season with 44 receptions for 468 yards and two touchdowns. \n\nOn February 27, 2009, Gaffney signed a four-year, $10 million contract with the Denver Broncos. In the Broncos' week 17 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Gaffney caught 14 passes for 213 yards as the Broncos played without Brandon Marshall, who was benched for disciplinary reasons by head coach Josh McDaniels. He finished the 2009 season with 54 receptions for 732 yards and two touchdowns, ranking second on the team in receptions and receiving yards. Gaffney put up 875 yards in 2010.\n\nGaffney was traded to the Washington Redskins for defensive end Jeremy Jarmon on July 27, 2011.

Days after his release, the NFL announced that Gaffney would be suspended for two games for failing to report an arrest to the league that occurred in Miami in 2010.\n\nReceiving Stats \n\nIn February 2000, Gaffney was charged with allegedly stealing $245 and a watch from the Florida Field locker room during the high school state championships, but the prosecutor placed him in a pretrial diversion program. After Steve Spurrier kicked him off the team in December 1999, he was eventually allowed to earn his way back onto the squad but forfeited his scholarship for a year.\n\nDuring the 2001 season, Gaffney and another athlete forcefully detained a 15-year-old boy who was stealing motor scooters from their apartment, and held him until police arrived. The boy's mother later alleged that Gaffney beat, kicked, choked and attempted to drown her son. The police declined to file charges and the state attorney agreed, stating the mother's allegations were inconsistent with the evidence and no jury would convict given the circumstances.\n\nIn 2006, Gaffney was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a handgun in New Jersey.\n\nIn 2010, Gaffney was charged with non-violent resisting arrest.\n\nIn January 2016, he was arrested for marijuana and drug possession.\n\nIn October 2017, Gaffney was arrested for domestic battery.\n\nGaffney and ex-wife Terin have a son, Jackson Tyrel Gaffney, and a daughter, Teagan Danae Gaffney.

{"id": "1809107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809107", "title": "Fox NFL Sunday", "text": "Fox NFL Sunday\n\nFox NFL Sunday is an American sports television program on Fox that debuted on September 4, 1994, and serves as the pre-game show for the network's National Football League game telecasts under the \"Fox NFL\" brand. An audio simulcast of the program airs on sister radio network Fox Sports Radio, which is distributed by Premiere Radio Networks. As of 2014, the program has won four Emmy Awards.\n\nFor sponsorship purposes, the show's full name is \"Fox NFL Sunday Presented by Ford Trucks\", which also promotes Ford's F-Series lineup as \"the official trucks of the NFL\".\n\n\"Fox NFL Sunday\" debuted on September 4, 1994, when Fox inaugurated its NFL game broadcasts through the network's recently acquired broadcast rights to the National Football Conference; it was originally hosted by James Brown, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson (both Brown and Bradshaw had joined the network from CBS to help helm Fox's NFL coverage). The program was notable in being the first hour-long NFL pregame show on a broadcast television network; network pregame programs that existed beforehand, such as CBS' \"The NFL Today\" or NBC's \"NFL Live!\", aired as 30-minute broadcasts. Fox's show also adopted a looser, more irreverent approach than its predecessors in order to also appeal to the network's younger-skewing audiences. \"Fox NFL Sunday\" was also the first network pregame program to originate from Los Angeles, whereas the CBS and NBC pregame shows were (and are, in the present-day) produced in New York City.\n\nDuring Jimmy Johnson's initial season on \"Fox NFL Sunday\", he would often join the show via satellite from his home in Florida. There was much speculation that Johnson would return to coaching during the first year of the program's run. Prior to the end of the year, Johnson made an \"announcement\", saying he was happy with his new career in broadcasting. But in 1996, he left the program to become head coach of the Miami Dolphins; Ronnie Lott was brought in to succeed him, and stayed with the program for two seasons.\n\nDuring Jimmy Johnson's initial run on the show, the opening introduction would typically feature a comedic skit involving several or all of the hosts.\n\nOn-location broadcast sites\nIn 1998, on the heels of NBC losing the broadcast rights to the NFL's American Football Conference (AFC) to CBS, Cris Collinsworth joined \"Fox NFL Sunday\" as an analyst – subsequently replacing Ronnie Lott.\n\nDuring this period, promotional claymation spots and teases became a popular fixture on the program, in which the four hosts were depicted as animated characters in live-action situations, usually starring real-life NFL players. Beginning with the 1999 season, comedian Jimmy Kimmel (then the co-host of Comedy Central's \"The Man Show\" and \"Win Ben Stein's Money\") began making weekly game predictions and performing comedy skits on the show; the following year, Jillian Barberie (then the weather anchor/co-host of Los Angeles Fox owned-and-operated station KTTV's \"Good Day L.A.\") was added to the program to provide weather forecasts for each week's game sites.\n\nOn-location broadcast sites\nCris Collinsworth left the program in 2002, when he was promoted to Fox's newly formed \"A Team\" of NFL game announcers, alongside Joe Buck and Troy Aikman (replacing Pat Summerall and John Madden). Fox produced several promos featuring Buck, Collinsworth and Aikman dressed as characters from the popular 1980s action series of the same name to promote the network's NFL coverage.\n\nInitially, the vacated fourth seat was to feature a rotating series of guest analysts, with Jimmy Johnson returning in Week 1. John Elway sat in during Week 2. For Week 3, Johnson returned, and took over the position permanently (he remains on the program to this day). Jimmy Kimmel left the program after the 2002 season a month before the premiere of his late-night talk show on ABC, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\". He was replaced by comedian Frank Caliendo – at the time, a cast member on Fox's late night sketch comedy series \"MADtv\" – who had previously guest starred during Kimmel's skits (performing his well-known impersonation of John Madden). Caliendo's prognostication skits began to feature his various spot-on celebrity impersonations, including Madden, Jay Leno, Jim Rome and George W. Bush, as well as show hosts Brown, Bradshaw, Long and Johnson. James Brown left the program after the 2005 season, in order to return to CBS to host its rival pregame show \"The NFL Today\".\n\nOn-location broadcast sites\n2005 was the last season in which Fox (along with CBS) aired Saturday afternoon NFL games towards the end of the regular season in December. On these occasions, Fox would precede its coverage with a studio pregame show titled \"Fox NFL Saturday\", which had no change in format outside of the day in the title.\n\nOn August 13, 2006, Fox announced that Joe Buck and Curt Menefee would succeed James Brown as hosts of the program. Because Buck was already serving as the lead play-by-play announcer for the \"NFL on Fox\" game broadcasts, each week's edition of \"Fox NFL Sunday\" was broadcast from the site of the network's top game of the week, in a move similar to Fox's NASCAR coverage, in which the pre-race show is telecast from the site of that week's race. Menefee hosted the halftime and postgame segments on location with the \"Fox NFL Sunday\" crew. Chris Rose served as the update host during game breaks. As a result of Buck going on assignment for Fox's MLB postseason coverage, Menefee substituted for Buck as the full-time host from Hollywood. During Weeks 6 through 8, while the show broadcast from Hollywood, Jillian Reynolds (née Barberie) returned as weather anchor for the game-day forecast segments.\n\nDuring Weeks 16 and 17, Buck served as the full-time host from Hollywood, with the rest of the \"Fox NFL Sunday\" crew. Dick Stockton took over as the main play-by-play analyst alongside Troy Aikman and Pam Oliver, while Menefee returned to the booth as secondary play-by-play analyst alongside Daryl Johnston and Tony Siragusa. Though the show returned to Hollywood for two weeks, Jillian Reynolds was absent, presumably having gone on maternity leave, as she was pregnant with her first child at the time.\n\nDuring Wild Card weekend, Menefee substituted for Buck as host of the Hollywood-originated pregame show broadcast. Meanwhile, Buck called the January 7, 2007 game between the New York Giants at the Philadelphia Eagles. During the Divisional Playoffs, Menefee once again substituted for Joe Buck as host, as the pregame show again originated from Hollywood for both games. Stockton called the Saturday, January 13 game between the Philadelphia Eagles at the New Orleans Saints and Buck called the Sunday, January 14 game between the Seattle Seahawks at the Chicago Bears.\n\nFor the NFC Championship Game between the New Orleans Saints and Chicago Bears on January 21, 2007, Joe Buck hosted the pregame show with the \"Fox NFL Sunday\" crew on location from Soldier Field. After Buck joined Aikman for play-by-play duties, Menefee took over as host for the remainder of the game and hosted the halftime and postgame shows. Terry Bradshaw handled the trophy ceremony during the postgame show.\n\n2006–2007 on-location broadcast sites\nIn March 2007, it was announced that the program (then branded on-air as \"The Built Ford Tough Fox NFL Sunday\", via a sponsorship agreement with Ford Motor Company) would resume studio broadcasts for the 2007 season, with Curt Menefee assuming full-time hosting duties and Joe Buck reverting to play-by-play only. Jillian Reynolds, who was coming off maternity leave, returned full-time as the program's weather anchor. However, the pre-game show was on-site at Lambeau Field for the 2007 NFC Championship Game between the New York Giants and the Green Bay Packers and at Super Bowl XLII.\n\nFor the 2007 season, \"Fox NFL Sunday\" introduced a new feature, a pre-recorded segment titled \"Grumpy Old Coaches\", in which Jimmy Johnson and fellow former Dallas Cowboys head coach Barry Switzer discuss the past week in football. A segment of highlights and commentary of the previous day's college football games was also featured, as a gesture to Fox's then recent acquisition of broadcast rights to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). This segment was dropped following the 2007 season.\n\nOn June 24, 2008, it was announced that former New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan would join the show as an analyst. On November 8, 2009, a special two-hour edition of the program was broadcast on-location from Afghanistan, featuring an audience of U.S. soldiers. While the regular \"Fox NFL Sunday\" crew did the pregame show, Chris Rose served as the studio host and anchored the in-game highlights, as John Lynch and Trent Green served as studio analysts for the halftime and post-game reports during the broadcast. On January 24, 2010, \"Fox NFL Sunday\" broadcast on-location from New Orleans for the 2009 NFC Championship.\n\nOn January 23, 2011, \"Fox NFL Sunday\" also broadcast an on-location edition at Soldier Field in Chicago for the 2010 NFC Championship; the program held its Super Bowl XLV pregame show in Arlington, Texas on February 6, 2011.\n\nStarting with the 2011 NFL season, the show introduced a new feature called \"Fox :45\", which is usually formatted a sing-along parody of a famous song, or as a comedic sketch. The parodies and sketches usually relate to current events occurring during the football season. The program also introduced the \"Twitter Tracker\", which scrolls tweets from NFL players and coaches.\n\nOn August 2, 2012, Frank Caliendo announced on his official Twitter account that he would not return to \"Fox NFL Sunday\" as a prognosticator for the 2012 season; comedian and former \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member Rob Riggle was eventually named as his replacement.\n\nOn September 11, 2016, \"Fox NFL Sunday\" was broadcast on location in Houston (the host city of Super Bowl LI) for the start of the 2016 NFL season. This also marked Curt Menefee's tenth season as full-time host of the pregame show. While the crew did the pregame, halftime and post-game shows, Charissa Thompson (host of \"Fox NFL Kickoff\") served as the studio host and anchored the in-game highlights.\n\n\n\n\"Cleatus the Robot\" is a CGI-animated character that serves as the official mascot for \"Fox NFL Sunday,\" and the entirety of Fox Sports. It was named through a viewer contest held in the winter of 2007, in which fans were asked to submit entries to select the robot's name. Cleatus made his first appearance on the program during the 2005–06 NFL season, but was not used regularly until the following season.\n\nCleatus mainly appears during the opening sequence of the program, as well as during end-of-break sponsorship tags within the program and during game telecasts, certain identifications for Fox Sports used to close sports broadcasts and as a cue to Fox stations to air local advertisements during commercial breaks, and brief promotions for movies and television series. In the latter instance, he commonly gets attacked by a CGI character from the subject of the advertisement (such as Iron Man, a dragon from the movie \"Eragon\", a T-1000 robot from the Fox drama \"\", and The Burger King, who taunted Cleatus by throwing objects at him). Cleatus is also seen doing various things such as hopping on two feet, playing an electric guitar, shaking out his limbs, and performing dance moves such as The Swim and the Electric Slide; during the Fox broadcast of a Denver Broncos game on December 11, 2011, he also Tebowed (the kneeling prayer position popularized by former Broncos player Tim Tebow).\n\nGames aired on the weekend following New Year's Day typically show Cleatus sitting on a bench holding an ice pack to his head, as if nursing a hangover. During the MLB postseason in October until the conclusion of the World Series (both of which air on Fox), the character is also seen taking baseballs from a basket and hitting them with a bat towards the background. Cleatus is usually replaced with a robotic turkey during Fox's Thanksgiving NFL game broadcasts.\n\nFox has since manufactured an action figure of the character, which it sells on the Fox Sports website, available in the character's normal appearance as well as in special uniforms customized for all 32 NFL franchises.\n\nIn response to the creation of Cleatus, Fox Sports created Digger, an animated gopher mascot for \"Fox NASCAR\" telecasts; the character was originally seen only during the races when the in-track cameras knowns as the \"Digger Cam\" were shown, but his role soon expanded. Unlike Cleatus, however, Digger was not well received by fans, and sparked an internet and Twitter outcry for his removal from the broadcast. While Digger was featured heavily in 2009, he only made cameo appearances in 2010 before being phased out completely the following year. Starting in 2014, Frank Krimel is the driver of Fox Sports 1 Cleatus competing in Monster Jam.\n\nCleatus was included in an episode of \"The Simpsons\", \"The Spy Who Learned Me\", and in sketches on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\".\n\nDuring the 2019 WWE draft, Cleatus the Robot would appear in war room-style backstage vignettes with actors portraying FOX executives making selections for the Smackdown! brand.\n\nSky Sports in the United Kingdom, which was until October 2018 owned by 21st Century Fox, uses a modified version of the Cleatus opening sequence and sponsorship tags with their own branding.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1809119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809119", "title": "Las Vegas Wranglers", "text": "Las Vegas Wranglers\n\nThe Las Vegas Wranglers were a professional ice hockey team based in Las Vegas Valley. The Wranglers were members of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference of the ECHL (formerly the East Coast Hockey League). The Wranglers were founded as an expansion franchise in 2003 following the ECHL's takeover of the West Coast Hockey League.\n\nIn May 2014, the team suspended operations for the 2014–15 ECHL season, allowing it time to secure a new home arena. In 2015, the team withdrew from the ECHL after being unable to find a home arena for the 2015-16 season.\n\nThe Wranglers won many accolades over their time in the league. They have the highest winning percentage in ECHL history and hold six other ECHL records. The Wranglers made two appearances in the Kelly Cup Finals, in 2008 and 2012 and won the Brabham Cup once and the Pacific Division title twice. Former Wranglers who have reached the National Hockey League (NHL) include Brent Krahn, Adam Pardy, Dany Sabourin, Tyson Strachan, and Tyler Sloan. From 2003 to 2014, the Wranglers played their home games on the west side of the city at the Orleans Arena. The team's lease with Orleans Arena ended after the 2013–14 season.\n\nThe Wranglers had been the ECHL affiliate of the NHL's Calgary Flames since the team's inaugural season in 2003 until 2009 before announcing that they were switching their affiliation to the Phoenix Coyotes for the 2009–10 ECHL season.\n\nThe Wranglers garnered many accolades from the local media, including the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\" naming the Wranglers \"Best Local Sports Team\" three times (2005, 2006, 2009) and head coach Glen Gulutzan \"Best Local Coach\" (2007, 2009).\n\nWith the Las Vegas Thunder of the International Hockey League folding following the 1998–99 IHL season, the West Coast Hockey League (WCHL) announced its intentions to keep ice hockey in the Las Vegas Valley when they granted expansion rights to the city in 1999, with plans for the team to start competing in the 2000–01 WCHL season. The Wranglers team name and logo were announced shortly before what was supposed to be the franchise's inaugural season in 2000, but the team had to suspend its entrance into the WCHL for three seasons due to the lack of a suitable arena for the team to play in. Deciding to not miss out on another season, the Wranglers announced in October 2002 that they planned to play at the proposed Las Vegas Events Center in Downtown Las Vegas and share the arena with the Community College of Southern Nevada's men's and women's basketball teams. The Events Center was to be paid for and operated by a non-profit organization that was supported by Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman\n\nWith no progress on the proposed Events Center, the franchise announced in September 2002 that it was moving to the Orleans Arena that was under construction at The Orleans Hotel and Casino. The Orleans Arena became the home of the Wranglers beginning with the 2003–04 WCHL season. Later in September 2002, a planned merger between the WCHL and the East Coast Hockey League was announced that would have the WCHL's six active franchises and three expansion franchises (including the Wranglers) join the ECHL for the 2003–04 season.\n\nOn May 29, 2003, in place of owner Charles Davenport, IV, actor Ricky Schroder introduced former Fresno Falcons player/coach Glen Gulutzan as the franchise's first head coach and general manager. Within four months, Gulutzan came to terms with Calgary Flames general manager Darryl Sutter to make the Wranglers the ECHL affiliate of the Flames and Lowell Lock Monsters. The first two players that Gulutzan signed were brothers and former NHLers Jason and Mike McBain and added veteran ECHL goaltender Marc Magliarditi shortly thereafter. Before the Wranglers inaugural season, Gulutzan named Jason McBain the franchise's first captain. The Wranglers started off their season going 9–1–3 in their first 13 games and they didn't lose a home game in regulation until a 1–0 loss to the San Diego Gulls on December 27, 2003, going 13–1–1 at home over the stretch. The Wranglers finished their first season with a record of 43–22–7 (93 points), second in the Western Conference's Pacific Division (15 points behind Brabham Cup winner San Diego). The Wranglers faced the Idaho Steelheads in the best-of-five Pacific Division Semifinals and despite overtaking Idaho in the first two games, the Steelheads won the remaining three games on their way to their first Kelly Cup championship.\n\nEntering the 2004–05 season, Gulutzan and the Wranglers were expected to compete again for the division crown, but instead the team suffered the worst season in franchise history. Due to the 2004-05 NHL Lockout, local media believed that the team would be stronger as many Calgary Flames players decided to play for the team's affiliate in Lowell, sending multiple top prospects and former NHLers to the team including goaltender Sébastien Centomo. The 2004–05 Wranglers ended up being more remembered for their lack of discipline as forward Adam Huxley set a team record for penalty minutes and Centomo became better known for fighting than stopping the puck. Wranglers fans showed their disdain through chants and signs that called for the dismissal of Gulutzan as head coach. The Wranglers finished the season a disappointing 31–33–8 (70 points) and seventh place in the West Division, failing to capture a playoff spot for the only time in franchise history.\n\nBefore the 2005–06 season, Wranglers captain Jason McBain announced his retirement and the team's captaincy was given to his brother Mike as the Wranglers looked to shake off the disappointing performance of their sophomore season. The Wranglers started the season on a rocket pace losing only four games in the first three months of the season. This included the Wranglers besting their home mark to start a season, as they did not lose at home in regulation until January 3, 2006, 3–2 to the Reading Royals. Before the loss to Reading, the Wranglers had gone 12–0–2 during the time. Along with the 14-game unbeaten streak at home to start the season, the Wranglers also tied the league record for most consecutive road wins with ten from November 22, 2005 to December 31, 2005. One of the most memorable moments during the 2005–06 season came during the Wranglers' November 5–2 8 win as head coach Glen Gulutzan challenged Fresno's head coach Matt Thomas to a fight because Fresno goons Brad Both and Fraser Clair instigated fights with Wranglers rookies Tim Hambly and Lee Green with 11 seconds left in the game. Several Wranglers set team records during the 2005–06 season, including goaltender Marc Magliarditi for most games played by a goaltender (51) and most wins by a goaltender (34). Centre Matt Dzieduszycki set the team record for most points in a season with 78 and Dan Tudin set team records for highest plus/minus with +38, shots on goal with 256 and shorthanded goals with seven.\n\nThe Wranglers ended the season with their best record at 53–13–6 (112 points), only one point behind the Alaska Aces for the West Division title and the Henry Brabham Cup. The 53 wins in 2005–06 were the most in franchise history and the 20-win turnaround led to head coach Glen Gulutzan being awarded the John Brophy Award as the league's top coach. The Wranglers would take on the Idaho Steelheads in the best-of-seven West Division semifinals. The Wranglers found themselves trailing Idaho three games to one, but pulled off what only one other team in the ECHL's history were able to do, winning the best-of-seven series after trailing 3–1. The Wranglers faced the Alaska Aces in the West Division finals, ultimately falling in six games.\n\nSeeking to improve on a great year, the Wranglers were placed in the National Conference's Pacific Division following a league wide realignment. The Wranglers had their best chance to capture their first banner as they did not have to compete with Alaska or Idaho for the division title. The Wranglers had to begin the season without veterans goaltender Marc Magliarditi and Mike McBain but still had a good start, earning points in all of their first eight games, going 3–0–5. The Wranglers relied heavily on new goaltender Mike McKenna and returning stars Shawn Limpright and Marco Peluso for leadership during the time in which the team lost its most veteran players. Magliarditi himself retired in the middle of the season, leaving as the franchise's career leader in minutes played (8517), games played by a goaltender (146), wins (83) and shutouts (7). Despite injuries and being left with only one player from the inaugural 2003–04 franchise, the Wranglers paced themselves to their first ever banner, winning the Pacific Division title on April 4, 2007 with a 4 – 2 victory on the road against the Long Beach Ice Dogs at Long Beach Arena . Three days later the Wranglers clinched the Brabham Cup title when they defeated the Stockton Thunder 2 – 1 on the last game of the season, just edging out heated rival, the Alaska Aces by one-point, reminiscent of the Brabham Cup race the two teams had just one year before.\n\nThe Wranglers finished the 2006–07 regular season with a 46–12–14 record (106 points) and set the league record for fewest road defeats in a single season with 5. Wranglers rookie goalie Mike McKenna would finish second in the race for the Reebok Goaltender of the Year award, finishing behind Adam Berkhoel of the Dayton Bombers, and set single season team records in shutouts (5) and lowest goals against average (2.21). The Wranglers also entered the Kelly Cup playoffs on a 13-game winning streak when they took on the 8th-seeded Phoenix RoadRunners in the National Conference quarterfinals. The Wranglers swept the 'Runners in four games and take on the Idaho Steelheads in the National Conference semifinals. The Wranglers won game one of the series to extend their league record winning streak to 18 games, tying the 1991 Peoria Rivermen of the International Hockey League for the longest winning streak in professional hockey history. The streak ended in game two and Idaho eventually took the series in six games on the way to their second Kelly Cup title in four years.\n\nAs the Wranglers were set to begin their fifth season in the ECHL many changes had come around the team. After coming out of nowhere to fill in for Wranglers legend Marc Magliarditi, Mike McKenna left Las Vegas, signing with the Portland Pirates of the AHL and Mike McBain was not expected to play much of the season before he retired. In turn, Gulutzan signed rookie goaltenders Daniel Manzato and Kevin LaLande, as well as signing twins and former NHLers Chris and Peter Ferraro. Two games into the season, Mike McBain announced his retirement and Peter Ferraro was named as his replacement as captain. Despite having two untested goaltenders and a team that didn't have a single original Wrangler, the team shot out of a cannon during the early part of the season, going 15–2–0 after two months into the season. By mid-season, the Wranglers were comfortably settled into first place in the Pacific Division and coach Gulutzan was named head coach of the National Conference All-Stars for the third straight year, tying the league record for most appearances at the ECHL All-Star Game by a coach. The Wranglers clinched their second straight Pacific Division crown and National Conference regular season championship on March 26, 2008 with a 3 – 2 overtime victory on the road against the Utah Grizzlies. The win also made the Wranglers the first team in ECHL history to have three consecutive seasons with at least 100 points.\n\nThe Wranglers finished the season 46–13–12 (106 points), good enough for first place in the Pacific Division and the number one overall seed in the National Conference playoffs. Right Winger Peter Ferraro would set the team's single season goal mark with 36. The Wranglers would take on the Stockton Thunder in the National Conference quarterfinals in a series that was tighter than expected. Stockton had played the entire season with most of their players being called up to the Springfield Falcons of the AHL or were reassigned by Stockton's parent club, the Edmonton Oilers, and barely limped into the final playoff spot in the National Conference. At the beginning of the series most of the players that had been called up by Springfield or Edmonton were returned to the team with high level experience and pushed the Wranglers to the edge, but Las Vegas was able to recover and take the series in six games. The Wranglers next opponent would be their heated rival, the Alaska Aces in the National Conference semifinals. The Wranglers set the tone for the series, throttling Alaska 8 – 0 in game one of the series. Alaska was unable to recover and the Wranglers would take the series in five games. With only four wins away from the Kelly Cup finals, Las Vegas took on the cinderella 6th-seed Utah Grizzlies. Utah proved tough for Las Vegas, taking the Wranglers to overtime in games two and three, before falling to the Wranglers in a four-game sweep as Las Vegas won its first Bruce Taylor Trophy as the National Conference playoff champions. The Wranglers would meet 2007–08 Brabham Cup champion Cincinnati Cyclones in the Kelly Cup finals. The two teams proved formidable opponents as the split the first four games, before Cincinnati stole momentum defeating the Wranglers in Las Vegas in Game 5 and ultimately taking the Kelly Cup in six games.\nFollowing their successful 2007–08 campaign, the Wranglers were forced to rebuild again as the team was only able to resign nine players from the previous team. At the beginning of the season, former Wranglers captain and defenceman Mike McBain was named as the team's assistant coach, filling in for former assistant Brent Bilodeau who left the team after three seasons to become head coach of the Wichita Thunder of the Central Hockey League. The 2008–09 team was crippled by injuries and inexperienced players. Despite this and the sudden folding of division rival Fresno, the Wranglers were able to produce a competitive team that finished 34–31–8 (76 points; .521 win %) and mere percentage points behind division champion, Ontario. The Wranglers reached a new level of intensity in their rivalry with the Alaska Aces during the second period of their game on March 25, 2009 in Las Vegas. Alaska's Matt Stefanishion collided with Las Vegas' Chris Ferraro, breaking Ferraro's leg and effectively ending his season and possibly his career. Ferraro's twin brother, Peter became enraged and started a brawl that would involve nine players. During the melee, Peter Ferraro received a game misconduct penalty for spearing, as did Las Vegas' Tim Spencer for kicking. In the aftermath, the Aces were given a five-minute 5-on-3 power play in which they scored three times before the teams were at even strength. A few days after the game, the ECHL suspended Peter Ferraro for the rest of the regular season and the entirety of the 2009 Kelly Cup Playoffs for his actions during the game which included the spearing incident and was released by the team a week later. Wranglers career scoring leader, Shawn Limpright, was named the captain for the rest of the season.\n\nThe Wranglers entered the playoffs at the 2nd seed in the Pacific Division and took on the 3rd seed Bakersfield Condors in the best-of-seven Pacific Division semifinals. The Wranglers and Condors traded blows in the first four games, before Bakersfield took a 3 games to 2 lead heading back for games 6 and 7 in Las Vegas. The Wranglers outscored Bakersfield 8–2 in the last two games to take the series in seven games. The Wranglers headed to the Pacific Division finals to face the division's 4th-seed Stockton Thunder, who were coached by Gulutzan's rival Matt Thomas to an upset of division champion Ontario. As with the previous series with Bakersfield, the first four games were split by the two teams and Las Vegas took a 3 to 2 games lead heading back to Las Vegas. Stockton extended the series to a seventh game by defeating the Wranglers 3 – 1, but the Wranglers finished off the Thunder in game 7, 5–1. For the second straight year the Wranglers had reached the National Conference finals, but this time they were to take on the National Conference regular season champion Alaska Aces. Exhausted and injured from two straight seven game series, the Wranglers were unable to retain the Bruce Taylor Trophy, being swept by Alaska in four games.\n\nFollowing an unlikely return to the National Conference finals, the first head coach and general manager of the Las Vegas Wranglers, Glen Gulutzan, left the team to become the head coach of the expansion Texas Stars of the AHL. For the first time in seven years, Wranglers owner Charles Davenport was forced to look for a head coach, but stated that Gulutzan's move to the AHL was \"long overdue.\" Gulutzan had been offered assistant coaching jobs in the AHL for the past few years, but the offer to coach Texas was his first head coaching offer in the AHL. Gulutzan said he would make some recommendations to help Davenport’s search. On June 25, 2009, former Stockton Thunder assistant coach, Ryan Mougenel was named the second head coach in franchise history.\n\nOn July 15, 2009 the Wranglers announced that they had hired former NHL All-Star Keith Primeau to take over as the team's director of player development as well as being a special assistant to the General Manager. Primeau, who played in fifteen NHL seasons, runs the Durham Hockey Institute in Toronto with Wranglers head coach and general manager Ryan Mougenel and Keith's brother Wayne and the trio are also the owners of the Whitby Fury of the Ontario Junior Hockey League.\n\nThe 2009–10 season was a roller coaster for the Wranglers. Many veteran players left the team as co-owners Charles Davenport and Jonathan Fleisig cut payrolls in order to save during the recession. Mougenel in turn went with a very youthful team, most of which had little to no professional experience, due to the low budget he was given. The team operated with the league's lowest payroll during the 2009–10 season, spending $10,300 per week compared to the ECHL's weekly salary cap of $11,800\n\nNear the end of 2009, Davenport sold his ownership rights to Fleisig, who assumed full ownership of the team. The team became more consistent following the All-Star break, going 28–18–7 after starting the season 6–12–1 and moving from last place in the National Conference, to finish in 2nd place in the Pacific Division. Las Vegas would fall to the Utah Grizzlies in the National Conference Quarterfinals in five games, after taking a 2 games to 1 lead, failing to advance past the first round of the playoffs since their inaugural season.\n\nIn mid-April 2010, Felisig reached an agreement with an unidentified buyer who planned to keep the team in Las Vegas. ECHL commissioner Brian McKenna confirmed that the team would return for an eighth season in Las Vegas, but couldn't comment further until the transfer of ownership was completed. Mougenel stated that the new owners were \"great people\" and that \"they're real committed to the team.\" Team president Billy Johnson stated that the team was hoping to make a formal announcement of the transfer by the end of April or the first week of May 2010.\nIn mid-June 2010, the ECHL Board of Governors gave unanimous approval for the transfer of ownership from Fleisig to Wranglers Hockey LLC led by Gary Jacobs, a real estate developer from San Diego who is also managing owner of the Lake Elsinore Storm minor league baseball team.\n\nMougenel announced in late September 2011 that the Wranglers would play as an independent team (i.e., unaffiliated with any NHL/AHL teams) for the 2011–12 ECHL season.\n\nIn December 2013, The Orleans Hotel and Casino notified the team that it would not renew their lease for the following season. This prompted the franchise to search for a new venue in the Las Vegas area. The team announced plans to move to a newly built 3,500-seat facility at the Plaza Hotel & Casino in downtown Las Vegas. However, on May 7, 2014, the team announced that they would not move to the Plaza due to the idea of a rooftop arena becoming unfeasible and an alternative, building the arena in the Plaza's parking lot, being too expensive.\n\nAs a result, the Wranglers requested and received a voluntary suspension of operations from the ECHL for the 2014–15 season. The team planned to seek a new permanent venue and return to play in the 2015–16 season. On January 30, 2015, it was announced via Facebook that the Wranglers would cease operations after not being able to find a suitable home within a reasonable time frame to submit to the board of governors of the ECHL. In 2016, Las Vegas was awarded a National Hockey League franchise the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\nThe Wranglers are the only team to hold a game that was played at midnight. The annual \"Midnight Roundup\" was created so that Las Vegas residents who work during the usual game times (e.g. employees of the gaming industry), could watch a game. Other Wranglers promotions included the traditional mullet hat night and even a give away of orange vests that said \"Don't Shoot...I'm Human!\" during a game on March 17, 2006, a joke on the Dick Cheney hunting incident. In January 2009, the team held the \"Rod Blagojevich Prison Uniform Night\" parodying the impeachment of the then-Governor of Illinois, where both teams wore inmate-like attire - the Wranglers striped jerseys, the visiting Bakersfield Condors orange jerseys resembling the current Department of Corrections issue - and the referees blue jerseys resembling prison guards. Their 2011/12 home opener was a promotion for \"Rapture Day\", as this game coincided with the Rapture prediction of Oakland radio host Harold Camping, and on New Years Day, to parody how the 2012 NHL lockout forced the NHL Winter Classic to be cancelled that year, the Wranglers held an \"Indoor Winter Classic\", that even gave a trophy with a chain and a padlock.\n\nThe Wranglers' first logo featured a cowboy riding a bull and holding a hockey stick with Las Vegas Wranglers script below the bull. The cowboy and bull are both black and white and are outlined in silver. The script consists of \"Las Vegas\" in silver cursive, while \"Wranglers\" is in white with silver accents. Prior to the WCHL-ECHL merger, the Wranglers logo was an outline of a cowboy's face streaking to the left with a black cowboy hat and red and yellow outlines. A script underneath the logo featured \"Las Vegas\" in black above \"Wranglers\" in yellow with a red outline.\n\nOn July 5, 2012, the Wranglers unveiled their new identity package; the primary logo featured a cowboy's head inside a shield with a goalie mask over his face. The cowboy hat is black and gray, with the mask white and gray and the shield in two shades of red and outlined in black. Beneath the cowboy is a red eight-pointed star, and on either side of him is a white \"LV\" and \"NV,\" representing the city and state's abbreviation.\n\nThe Wranglers' final colors were black, red, white and silver and could be seen on both the home and road jerseys, which were adopted prior to the 2007–08 season. The black and white jerseys feature a crest with a poker chip logo on the front. The outer circle of the crest reads \"Las Vegas Wranglers\", while the middle of the crest leaves room for the player’s individual jersey number and the sleeves sport the poker chip hockey puck logo. The team has two alternate jerseys which have been used since the team's inaugural season in 2003. The red alternate jersey, which had been the team's road jersey from 2003–07, has black shoulders and three black stripes, one across each arm and one across the waist and a crest on the front of the jersey that includes \"Las Vegas\" in white cursive over a poker chip/hockey puck logo. The second alternate is black with red shoulders and five red stripes, one across each elbow, one across each arm and one across the waist. The jersey also features red die along the bottom of the jersey and between the red stripes on each arm. The jersey's crest includes script that says \"VEGAS\" with each letter in an individual circle in front of a red hockey stick with the poker chip/hockey puck logo on the blade of the stick.\n\nThe Wranglers' previous home jersey, which was used from 2003–07, was white with a previously unreleased Wranglers logo on the chest and is trimmed with black and red on the sleeves and waist.\n\nAs of the second half of the 2009–2010 season, the Las Vegas Wranglers again started wearing the Red Alternate and Black Alternate Jerseys at home.\n\nIn December 2010, the team wore a Christmas-themed Santa Jersey which was featured as the number 22 worst jersey in an article in the \"Vancouver Sun\". The team also held Rod Blagojevich Night where the Wranglers wore a striped prison-themed jersey with their opponents, the Bakersfield Condors, wearing an orange jumpsuit and referees wearing a blue police guard uniform.\n\nThe Wranglers' mascot was \"The Duke\", a green bull that was based on the Philly Phanatic and was the team's mascot since its inaugural season in 2003. The Duke kept the crowd excited, signed autographs, and participated in entertainment during intermissions and player introductions at the beginning of the game. The Duke is also a regular at other events around the city including races at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway and making appearances with players at local elementary schools. The Duke has attended three ECHL All-Star Games as the league's favorite mascot.\n\nPossibly the Wranglers' strongest rivalry was with the Alaska Aces. The Aces and Wranglers were the two winningest franchises in ECHL history and the two had combined for six division titles, two Brabham Cups and three Kelly Cup Finals appearances. The Alaska Aces rivalry began during the 2005–06 season in which the Wranglers fell one point behind the Aces for the West Division and Brabham Cup titles. The Aces would also eliminate the Wranglers in six games in the 2006 West Division Finals on way to their first Kelly Cup. The Wranglers would return the favor in 2008 National Conference Semifinals by defeating the Aces in five games on way to their appearance in the Kelly Cup Finals. The Aces and Wranglers met for the third time in the playoffs in the 2009 National Conference Finals, with the Aces sweeping the Wranglers in four games.\n\nThe Aces-Wranglers rivalry quickly become one of the biggest for both teams and for the league itself. Three games were usually played in four days (usually Wednesday, Friday and Saturday), allowing for many Aces fans to come to Las Vegas for a hockey weekend. The rivalry has known to become quite violent as the case of a game in March 2009. During the second period of Aces-Wranglers game on March 25, 2009, in Las Vegas, when Alaska's Matt Stefanishion collided with Las Vegas' Chris Ferraro, breaking Ferraro's leg and effectively ending his season and career. Ferraro's twin brother, Peter became enraged and started a brawl that would involve nine players. During the melee, Peter Ferraro received a game misconduct penalty for spearing, as did Las Vegas' Tim Spencer for kicking. In the aftermath, the Aces were given a five-minute 5-on-3 power play in which they scored three times before the teams were at even strength. A few days after the game, the ECHL suspended Peter Ferraro for the rest of the regular season and the entirety of the 2009 Kelly Cup Playoffs for his actions during the game which included the spearing incident.\n\nThe Aces-Wranglers rivalry continued early in the 2009–10 season. During a three-game series in the second week of the season, Alaska and Las Vegas totaled 93 penalties for 296 penalty minutes, including seven game misconducts. In the final game of the series, an Alaska player plowed through Wranglers goaltender Michael Ouzas on three separate occasions, sparking a multiple skirmishes after each incident.\n\nThe Las Vegas Wranglers had many other significant rivalries which include those with the Bakersfield Condors, Fresno Falcons, Idaho Steelheads, Long Beach Ice Dogs, Ontario Reign, Phoenix RoadRunners, San Diego Gulls, Stockton Thunder, Toledo Storm. and Utah Grizzlies.\n\nThe rivalries with the Condors and the Thunder started off very softly during the Wranglers inaugural season but have become more heated since the Wranglers' move into the Pacific Division during the 2006–07 season.\n\nThe rivalry with Fresno came from the two teams' normal battling for position near the top of the division standings.\n\nThe Wranglers and the Steelheads had a constant rivalry that has centered around the playoffs. The Wranglers had met the Steelheads in all three of their playoff appearances.\n\nThe Texas Wildcatters relocated to Ontario, California, and became the Ontario Reign. The Reign, affiliated with the Los Angeles Kings, who had a significant fan base in Las Vegas, is often considered a part of the Los Angeles sports market. In 2009, Ontario became the first team other than the Wranglers to win the Pacific Division title since Las Vegas returned to the division in 2006.\n\nThe longest of the rivalries was with the Utah Grizzlies, which started between the Las Vegas Thunder and the Utah Grizzlies in the International Hockey League and came to its highest point during 1996 IHL Western Conference Finals. The rivalry with Long Beach, Phoenix and San Diego also came when the cities had members in the IHL and made numerous playoff appearances against each other.\n\nThe Wranglers had numerous songs that represent the team during pre-game introductions. Songs that represented the regular season have included: Never Gonna Stop (The Red Red Kroovy), Stand Up, Ready Steady Go, ...To Be Loved, Crash. When the team makes the playoffs, the song that was used in the regular season is usually changed. Songs that have represented the playoffs have included: The Hand That Feeds and Lights and Sounds. During the regular season the Wranglers used Ain't Nothing Wrong With That by Robert Randolph and the Family Band and The Pretender by the Foo Fighters as their theme song. For the 2008 Kelly Cup Playoffs, the Wranglers used Give It All by Rise Against. The Wranglers last used Redlight King \"Born to Rise\" before folding.\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, OTL = Overtime losses, SOL=Shootout losses, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against\"\nThese are the top-ten point-scorers in franchise history.

During his playing career, he played in the National Football League (NFL) for ten seasons. He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round of the 2002 NFL Draft after playing college football for the University of Florida. He played for the Eagles for seven seasons, and was selected to the Pro Bowl twice. He also played for the NFL's New York Jets, Minnesota Vikings, and Oakland Raiders. As a coach, he was the safeties coach for the Orlando Apollos of the Alliance of American Football (AAF) in 2019.\n\nSheppard was born in Jacksonville, Florida in 1981. He attended William M. Raines High School in Jacksonville, where he was an all-state selection and \"USA Today\" All-American at defensive back for the Raines Vikings high school football team. Sheppard had eighteen interceptions in twenty-nine games as a junior and senior, and led the Vikings to an undefeated season and a state championship in 1998. In 2007, eight years after he graduated from high school, the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) recognized Sheppard as one of the \"100 Greatest Players of the First 100 Years\" of Florida high school football.\n\nSheppard accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Steve Spurrier's Florida Gators football team from 1999 to 2001. He was a first-team All-American as a sophomore in 2000, and a first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection in 2000 and 2001. In his three-season college career, he started twenty-two games, recorded eight interceptions, had eighty-seven tackles, and returned twenty-seven kickoffs for 472 yards (an average of 22.5 yards per return). Sheppard declared himself eligible for the NFL Draft after his junior year.\n\nIn one of a series of articles published by \"The Gainesville Sun\" in 2006, he was ranked as No. 44 among the 100 greatest Gators from the first 100 years of Florida football.\n\nIn the 2002 NFL Draft, Sheppard was selected in the first round (twenty-sixth pick overall) by the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn 2004 Sheppard had five interceptions, including two returned for touchdowns. He was named Defensive Player of the Month for the month of November after returning two interceptions for touchdowns. Sheppard was selected to his first Pro Bowl in 2004, and he was also named first team All-Pro for his first and only year.\n\n2005 was the first of three injury-filled seasons for Sheppard. He missed six games and finished with three interceptions.\n\nOn October 8, 2006, Sheppard became the first player in NFL history to have two interception returns of more than 100 yards. Both returns came against the Dallas Cowboys (2004 and 2006). The most recent return sealed a 38–24 win over the Cowboys and secured 1st place in the division for the Eagles.\n\nIn the Eagles Wild Card playoff game on January 7 against the New York Giants, Sheppard dislocated his elbow. He missed the next playoff game against the Saints, which the Eagles lost 27-24.\n\nIn a 2007 game against the Green Bay Packers Sheppard suffered an injury. Sheppard went through another injury-filled season and finished with two interceptions.\n\nIn the 2008 offseason, the Philadelphia Eagles signed former New England Patriots cornerback Asante Samuel, which fueled speculation that Sheppard was available via trade. Sheppard changed agents to Drew Rosenhaus soon afterwards.\n\nDuring the 2008 season, Sheppard saw much reduced action due to good performances by starting corners Asante Samuel and Sheldon Brown.\n\nSheppard was traded to the New York Jets on February 28, 2009, for a fifth round pick in the 2009 NFL Draft and a conditional pick in the 2010 NFL Draft.

He used the French name \"Le pic noir hupé de Cayenne\" and the Latin name \"Picus niger cayanensis cristatus\". Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his \"Systema Naturae\" for the 12th edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the lineated woodpecker. Linnaeus included a terse description, coined the binomial name \"Picus lineatus\" and cited Brisson's work. The specific name \"lineatus\" is Latin and means \"lined\" or \"marked with lines\". The species is now placed in the genus \"Dryocopus\" which was introduced by the German naturalist Friedrich Boie in 1826.\n\nThere are five subspecies:\n\nThe lineated woodpecker is long. It resembles the closely related pileated woodpecker (\"Dryocopus pileatus\") of United States and Canada.\n\nAdults are mainly black above, with a red crest and whitish lines from the base of the bill, down the neck and shoulders (though individuals from the south-eastern part of its range commonly lack the line on the shoulders). The underparts are whitish, heavily barred with black. They show white on the wings in flight. Adult males have a red line from the bill to the throat (malar) and a red forehead. In adult females, these plumage features are black. The bill is typically black in both sexes, though pale-billed individuals regularly are seen.\n\nThe call of this widespread but wary bird is a loud, ringing \"wic-wic-wic\". Both sexes drum.\n\nIn most of its range, it is most likely confused with the crimson-crested woodpecker (\"Campephilus melanoleucos\"), which is similar in plumage and size. In the female of that species, the light face line is far broader, and the white shoulder lines meet on the back lower back (forming a \"V\"). The male crimson-crested woodpecker is quite different with its almost entirely red head.\n\nThe habitat of this species is forest borders and other open woodland. It is not generally a mountain bird, though it has occasionally been recorded in the uplands (e.g., in the Serranía de las Quinchas of Colombia) Three white eggs are laid in a nest hole is in a dead tree and incubated by both sexes. The young are fed by regurgitation.\n\nLineated woodpeckers chip out holes, often quite large, while searching out insects in trees. They mainly eat insects, especially ants, beetles and their larvae, with some seeds, such as from \"Heliconia\", and fruits, berries, and nuts.\n\nLineated woodpeckers breed March–April in Panama, April–May in Belize, and February–April in Trinidad and Suriname. Nest cavities are excavated in dead trees at variable heights, from above the ground. Both sexes excavate the nests, which are about deep, wide, and have an entrance about in diameter. Clutch size ranges from 2–4 eggs (2–3 in Trinidad). Males and females take 2–3 hour shifts incubating during the day, but only males incubate at night. Chicks are fed about once an hour by both parents through regurgitation; the female does most of the feeding while the male guards the nest. Incubation and fledging periods not documented.\n\n\n"}

The issues discussed include Superman's loss of physical control during intercourse, the presumed \"super powers\" of Superman's sperm cells, genetic incompatibility between humans and Kryptonians, and the dangers to the woman during gestation. The title is a reference to Superman's power and invulnerability, contrasting it with the relative fragility – like Kleenex brand facial tissue – of a human. The hypothetical woman is referred to in the essay as \"LL,” the initials of three women Superman has been romantically involved with: Lois Lane, Lana Lang, and Lori Lemaris.\n\nThe essay was first published in the men's magazine \"Knight\" in 1969, then collected in Niven's 1971 collection, \"All the Myriad Ways\".

ADN was founded on March 23, 1979 by the military dictator Hugo Banzer after he stepped down from power. It later expanded to include the Revolutionary Left Party (PIR) and a faction of the Bolivian Socialist Falange (FSB). As leader of the ADN, Banzer ran in the 1979, 1980, 1985, 1989, 1993, and 1997 presidential elections. He obtained third place in 1979 and 1980, and won a plurality of the 1985 vote, but, since he did not attain the 50% necessary for direct election, Congress (in accordance with the Bolivian Constitution) selected the chief executive. Its choice was the second-place finisher, Dr. Víctor Paz Estenssoro.\n\nBanzer's party at that point opted for supporting the MNR in a coalition government. Indeed, ADN would go on to claim authorship to some of the major neoliberal economic reforms instituted by President Paz to curb galloping hyperinflation, repress labor unions , and reduce the size of the government. Banzer finished second in the 1989 elections, but supported in Congress the third-place finisher, the left-leaning Jaime Paz Zamora, who became President with ADN help. The party again governed as the main support of a ruling coalition, this time under Paz Zamora. Banzer's ADN again finished second in 1993, this time to the MNR's Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada.\n\nFinally, in 1997 Banzer Suárez became the constitutionally-elected President of Bolivia, at the age of 71. He was the first former dictator in Latin America's recent history to transition successfully to democratic politics and return to power by way of the ballot box . During his tenure, he launched—under the guidelines outlined by the United States—a program to fight drug-trafficking in Bolivia, which called for the eradication of coca, a controversial strategy. He also had some trouble with the unions, but nonetheless did nothing to rule in a conciliatory and non-arbitrary manner. He was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2001, and even though he had earned a five-year term (he had himself agitated to legally enlarge the presidential term) Banzer resigned on August 7, 2001. He was succeeded by his Vice-President, Jorge Quiroga. Banzer's health declined rapidly thereafter, and he died on May 5, 2002.\n\nQuiroga then became leader and heir apparent of the ADN, but when he ran for President in the 2005 elections, he did so as the candidate for a new right-of-center coalition known as Social and Democratic Power (PODEMOS), which included the bulk of Banzer's former ADN organization. His main opponent was the leftist Evo Morales of the Movement Towards Socialism. Morales won the election and Quiroga finished a distant second place, receiving 28.6% of the vote. In the mid-2000s, it appeared that ADN has become a defunct former party, replaced by Quiroga's new PODEMOS organization, although its structures, ideology, and supporters remained basically the same. However, as of 2015, it was still a legal political party in Bolivia.\n\n"}

Home games were played at Sullivan Arena in Anchorage. The Aces won three Kelly Cup championships, with their last championship following the 2013–14 ECHL season.\n\nThe Aces were formed as a semi-professional team in the Pacific Southwest Hockey League (PSHL) in 1989 and became a charter member of the professional West Coast Hockey League (WCHL) in 1995. When the WCHL was absorbed by the East Coast Hockey League in 2003, the team joined the merged ECHL.\n\nThe Aces official team mascot was a polar bear named Boomer. Aces fans were known for using small, ceremonial cow bells painted with the Aces insignia to show their support during games.\n\nIn 2017, the ownership group announced that the 2016–17 season would be the team's last, after which the franchise would cease operations. The owners cited the struggling Alaskan economy, and sagging ticket sales among the reasons for the club's financial downfall. In June 2017, the franchise was sold and relocated to Portland, Maine, for the 2018–19 season.\n\nThe team was established in 1989 as the Anchorage Aces. They were originally a semi-professional club in the Pacific Southwest Hockey League organized by Dennis Sorenson, as a senior men's ice hockey team to compete against the established Alaska Gold Kings in Fairbanks.\n\nThe Aces played four unofficial games during the 1989–90 season. During the 1990–91 season, Keith Street led the team on a 22–game schedule, which included 20 games against teams registered with USA Hockey. The 1990–91 season ended with the Aces winning the Senior Men's Open National Championship held in Fairbanks. In 1993 and 1994, they won the National Amateur Championship. They finished second in 1992 and 1995.\n\nThe Aces joined the Pacific Northwest Hockey League (PNHL) for the 1991–92 season, playing six of their home games at the Sullivan Arena in Anchorage and eight at the Central Peninsula Sports Center in Soldotna. The Aces finished second in the PNHL with a 16–12–2 regular season record, and were the runners-up in the national USA Hockey tourney after a 0–4–1 tourney run.\n\nIn the 1992–93 season, new head coach Mike Ashley led the Aces to a 19–3–0 regular season record. In the USA Hockey Senior Men's Open Tournament, the Aces finished second for the second year in a row after compiling a 4–1 record in the tourney, losing the tiebreaker to the Chicago Chargers. Ashley resigned following the season.\n\nFor the 1993–94 season, the Aces played as an independent team. Steve Gasparini took over as head coach, and led the Aces to a 22–9–1 regular season record. The Aces also won their second championship in the USA Hockey Senior Men's Open National Tournament with a 5–0 run highlighted by the 6–0 rout of the Fresno Falcons. In 1994–95, the Aces joined the Pacific Hockey League (PHL), formed by a merger of the PSHL and PNHL. The team went 27–9 and lost in the championship game to the Gold Kings.\n\nThe PHL folded after only one season. After an unsuccessful attempt to form a new Pacific Rim Hockey League, the Aces joined the new West Coast Hockey League (WCHL) for the 1995–96 season. Mike Cusack, Jr. became sole owner of the franchise following the 1995–96 season.\n\nIn the 1996–97 season, the Aces initially lost in the league playoffs to the Fresno Falcons, three games to one. The WCHL commissioner determined that their 2–4 loss in game four would be changed to a 1–0 victory due to forfeit by the Fresno Falcons, when they failed to meet the minimum roster requirement due to injuries and suspensions. The Aces won the deciding fifth game 5–3 and advanced to the Taylor Cup finals, but were defeated by the San Diego Gulls.\n\nIn the 2000–01 season, Stirling Wright was brought in to serve as assistant coach. He was instrumental in bringing in former NHL players when the Aces signed former NHL goalie Vincent Riendeau and right wing Kevin Brown. The Idaho Steelheads defeated the Aces 3–0 in the first round of the playoffs. Overall, the Aces finished in third place with a 34–30–4 record and advanced to the semifinals, only to be ousted by the Tacoma Sabercats in three games.\n\nIn 2001–02, Wright was promoted within the franchise and began serving as the new General Manager. He hired former NHL coach and player Butch Goring as the team's new head coach. In effort to revamp the team, Wright only extended the contracts of four players from the previous season. The Aces additionally signed five former NHL players, including defenseman Jim Paek, goaltender Scott Bailey, wingers Todd Harkins and Daniel Goneau, and center Clayton Beddoes.\n\nClayton Beddoes retired just a few games into the season due to a previous shoulder injury. The Aces promoted a \"Guaranteed Win Night\" where if they lost the game, the fans in attendance would receive free Aces tickets.\n\nAfter a 10–18–4 season start, Aces' owner, Mike Cusack, fired Goring and Lou Corletto, who served the franchise as Vice President of Business Operations. He brought back former head coach, Walt Poddubny. Stirling Wright stepped down as general manager, due to his disapproval of the owner's decisions. The Aces went on to win only a few more games and the mass exodus of players soon followed, after Wright left the team. The team itself was making a profit, but the owner's other financial ventures continued to drain the team of its revenue.\n\nIn May 2002, the team owner filed personal bankruptcy. Cusack included his ownership of the Anchorage Aces franchise in the filing. According to the filing papers, the team was almost $2 million in debt.\n\nIn June 2002, Cusack put the team up for sale on eBay. The club's owner, Cusack, accepted a $1.862 million bid from Duncan Harrison, owner of Alaskan Automotive Distributing in Anchorage, but U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge Donald MacDonald converted the Aces' bankruptcy case to Chapter 7, which allowed him to reject the Harrison bid.\n\nThe listing was withdrawn when it was discovered that a US$2.3 million bid was a college student's prank.\n\nThe club was eventually sold for $1.05 million to a seven-member group. As of 2015 the Aces and Idaho Steelheads were the only former WCHL teams still playing in their original markets.\n\nThe Aces joined the ECHL for the 2003–04 season following a merger between the WCHL and the East Coast Hockey League. They were renamed the Alaska Aces after the league switch, and unveiled a new logo and new uniforms.\n\nThe team gained national prominence in 2004 when it signed New Jersey Devils all-star and Alaska-born Scott Gomez during that season's NHL lockout. Gomez went on to lead the ECHL in scoring and win league Most Valuable Player honors.\n\nThe Aces' 2006 triple overtime win against the Las Vegas Wranglers was at the time the third-longest game in ECHL history, concluding after 113 minutes, 30 seconds.\n\nIn 2006, the Aces became only the second team in ECHL history (joining the South Carolina Stingrays of Charleston, SC) in winning both the Brabham Cup and Kelly Cup championships in the same season. In 2008, the Cincinnati Cyclones became the third team to accomplish this feat. In 2011 the Alaska Aces did it again, becoming the first team to ever do it twice.\n\nIn 2006, Alaska won the ECHL Kelly Cup title in five games over the Gwinnett Gladiators. This was the first professional sports title won by an Alaskan team since the Anchorage Northern Knights won the Continental Basketball Association championship in 1980. Mike Scott received the ECHL Kelly Cup MVP award after the Aces' 4–3 win over the Gladiators in game five of the series.\n\nIn 2009, the Aces stormed through the first three rounds of the Kelly Cup Playoffs, winning in five games against both the Utah Grizzlies and the Victoria Salmon Kings in the first two rounds, and sweeping the Las Vegas Wranglers in the National Conference Finals. They were in the Kelly Cup Finals for the first time since their championship season in 2006,\nbut they lost 4 games to 3 to the South Carolina Stingrays.\n\nIn 2010–11, the Aces dominated the entire season, winning the Brabham Cup by earning the best record in the league, as well as leading the league in points scored. Wes Goldie lead the league in goals scored. In the Kelly Cup Playoffs, they swept the Idaho Steelheads and Victoria Salmon Kings, and then won the Kelly Cup Championship over the Kalamazoo Wings in five games. The Aces won a third Kelly Cup in 2014, defeating the Cincinnati Cyclones in the finals four games to two.\n\nOn August 22, 2013, the Aces announced their affiliation with the Calgary Flames.\n\nIn 2014–15 the Aces defended their Kelly Cup championship playing in the Pacific Division of the ECHL's Western Conference, but failed to make the playoffs for the first time since the team's WCHL days. They would miss the playoffs again in 2016.\n\nThe Aces were the northernmost and westernmost team in the ECHL, located from their closest geographical rival, the Idaho Steelheads. As a result, the team spent over $300,000 in travel-related costs during the 2014–15 season despite playing road games in only six different locations. In 2017, co-owner Jerry Mackie stated that the ownership was considering ceasing operation upon the completion of the 2016–17 season due to the mounting financial losses, the recent sagging Alaskan economy, the aforementioned high travel costs and dwindling attendance. On February 23, the ownership officially announced the 2016–17 season would be its last.\n\nOn April 8, 2017, the Aces played their final game in a 3–2 loss to the Idaho Steelheads in front of a sold out Sullivan Arena.\n\nIn June 2017, the Aces' ECHL membership was sold to Comcast Spectacor who relocated the team to Portland, Maine, for the 2018–19 ECHL season.\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime losses, SOL = Shootout losses, Pts = Points, PCT = Winning percentage, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes\".\n\n\n! colspan=\"3\" | League Championships\n"}

{"id": "1809151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809151", "title": "ESPN Sunday Night Football", "text": "ESPN Sunday Night Football\n\nESPN Sunday Night Football was the ESPN cable network's weekly television broadcasts of Sunday evening National Football League (NFL) games. The first ESPN Sunday night broadcast occurred on November 8, 1987, while the last one aired on January 1, 2006.\n\nFormer NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue credits ESPN with raising the \"profile\" of the league, by turning \"a potential six- or seven-hour television experience into a twelve-hour television experience,\" factoring in both \"Sunday Night Football\" and the network's pregame show \"Sunday NFL Countdown\".\n\nWhile ABC had been airing occasional Sunday night NFL games (usually one per season) under its \"Monday Night Football\" banner since 1978, the concept of playing a regular series of Sunday night professional football games on ESPN was originally a concept designed for the United States Football League. As part of the abortive 1986 USFL season, ESPN was to carry a weekly Sunday night game throughout the fall season.\n\nAs part of its new television package in 1987, the NFL granted ESPN the rights to air a series of Sunday night games, which were to air over the second half of the regular season. The NFL thus became the last major North American professional sports league to begin airing its games on cable television.\n\nDuring the inaugural season of ESPN Sunday Night NFL (as the telecast was then branded) in 1987, the network's announcing booth consisted of Mike Patrick, Roy Firestone, and a weekly \"guest color commentator\". Joe Theismann took over as lead analyst beginning in 1988. Two years later, the NFL expanded its Sunday night offerings to the full season, with TNT airing games in the season's first half and ESPN taking over for the second half.\n\nESPN's games were typically simulcast on regular over-the-air television stations in each participating team's local market so that households without cable television could still see the telecasts. During the first season, the game between the New York Giants and New England Patriots (the very first regular season game aired by ESPN) saw WABC-TV (ABC's flagship station out of New York City) produce a completely separate telecast from ESPN's. The reason behind this was that WABC's union contract at the time prohibited non-union workers, such as those at ESPN, from producing live events for WABC. The WABC broadcasts involved play-by-play man Corey McPherrin and Frank Gifford and Lynn Swann on color commentary.\n\nBeginning in 1998, ESPN broadcast the entire slate of Sunday night games (now officially rebranded as \"ESPN Sunday Night Football\"), and had exclusive rights to any night game other than the season opener and regular Monday night games, which aired on ABC. Thus, ESPN would usually have a few weekends each season with games on both Saturday (sometimes Thursday instead) and Sunday nights. Also in 1998, Paul Maguire joined Patrick and Theismann in the booth after re-joining ESPN after several years as a color commentator for NBC. Beginning in 1999, Suzy Kolber, who had recently rejoined ESPN from Fox Sports, served as the sideline reporter; Kolber replaced Solomon Wilcots, who joined CBS as a color commentator. In 2002, ESPN's \"SNF\" crew covered the new Thursday, opening night kickoff game. In 2004, Pat Summerall replaced Patrick for the preseason and for several regular season weeks following Patrick's recovery from open-heart surgery.\n\nAfter the 2005 season, ESPN ended this package in favor of picking up the broadcast rights to \"Monday Night Football\" from ABC. NBC picked up the rights to ESPN's Sunday night games. To replace \"Sunday Night Football\" ESPN moved its late-season \"Sunday Night Baseball\" broadcasts back to the network and replaced most of the rest of the open weeks with NBA telecasts.\n\nFrom 1987–1997, ESPN used various themes for its NFL coverage, reflecting its separate management from sister company ABC Sports (now ESPN on ABC since September 2006) at the time.\n\nIn 1998, as Disney began consolidating ESPN and ABC Sports, ESPN's NFL coverage began using themes associated with \"Monday Night Football\" such as \"Heavy Action\". In-game use of these themes ended after 2000, in favor of another original theme also referred to as \"Sirens\" (for featuring sirens prominently) by The Herbaliser.\n\nWhen ESPN gained the Monday night games, they once again began using the traditional \"Monday Night Football\" themes, but with increased frequency. See \"Monday Night Football\" for more info on music used during that package.\n\n\nDuring a game between the New England Patriots at New York Jets on December 20, 2003, former Jets quarterback Joe Namath in a sideline interview with Suzy Kolber twice stated that he wanted to kiss her, and \"couldn't care less about the team strugg-a-ling.\" Namath later apologized and blamed the incident on his obvious intoxication. Soon after, Namath entered an outpatient alcoholism treatment program. Namath chronicled the episode, including his battle with alcoholism in his book, \"Namath\" ().\n\nNOTE: Pat Summerall filled in for Mike Patrick who was recovering from heart bypass surgery.\n\n"}

{"id": "1809167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809167", "title": "West End Street Railway", "text": "West End Street Railway\n\nThe West End Street Railway was a streetcar company that operated in Boston, Massachusetts and several surrounding communities in the late nineteenth century. \n\nOriginally an offshoot of a land development venture, the West End rose to prominence when it merged several independent streetcar companies into a single organization, and over the next decade it was the primary operator of public street transit within the Boston area. During this time, the company maintained one of the largest street railway systems in the world, the first unified streetcar system in the United States, and first electrified system in a major US city.\n\nThe West End remained in independent operation until 1897, when it leased its entire line to the Boston Elevated Railway. It was formally consolidated into the Boston Elevated in 1922. \n\nThe original purpose of the West End was to provide service to a speculative land venture in western Boston and Brookline. In the mid-1880s a syndicate of investors led by Henry Melville Whitney chartered the West End Land Company and purchased some five million square feet of land in Brookline along the line of a proposed boulevard, with the intent of developing the tracts into a high-grade residential neighborhood. In conjunction with the development plans, Whitney proposed to create the boulevard as an extension of Beacon Street from Boston, with two wide roadways and a central reservation for a future street railway line. Approval for the boulevard was granted by a Brookline town meeting in March 1887, and construction was commenced that same year.\n\nIn order to build and operate the railway line, Whitney and the syndicate chartered the West End Street Railway on January 22, 1887. The West End also secured other locations in Brookline, and before long both it and a sister organization, the Suburban Street Railway, were granted locations in Boston to provide connections with the lines of other streetcar companies operating in the city.\n\nAt the time of the West End's formation, horsecar service in the Boston area was divided between several independent railway companies, with the four principal ones being the Metropolitan, the Cambridge, the Consolidated, and the South Boston. Each of these principal railways enjoyed a virtual monopoly in a particular area of the metro (with the Metropolitan being dominant in lower, western & East Boston, the Cambridge in the area of Cambridge, the Consolidated in Charlestown and lower Middlesex County, and the South Boston in the South Boston peninsula), from which they would transport passengers to a series of several shared terminuses within the central city.\n\nOriginally, the West End intended to coordinate operations with the principal companies in order to gain access to the Boston downtown; these efforts were however stymied by the directors of the Metropolitan and the Cambridge, who feared that the new organization represented a threat to their interests. Whitney and his associates therefore decided to carry out a much more ambitious strategy, in which they would acquire a majority of the stock of each of the established railways and unite them under common ownership. Within a short time they were able to achieve a controlling interest in all four of the principal companies, and in June 1887 the Massachusetts state legislature granted the West End a dispensation to unite with any other streetcar company operating in Boston. After some more months of negotiations, consolidation was completed in November 1887, in which shareholders of the four companies turned in their existing shares and in exchange received varying amounts of West End 8% preferred stock.\n\nAs a result of the consolidation, the West End was transformed into one of the largest street railway companies in the world, bringing some two hundred miles of track under single ownership. The move also created the first unified public transit system in a major American city, with nearly all streetcar service in Boston (excepting that of the Lynn and Boston) being operated by the company as a result. In the first ten months following consolidation the company reported a rider count of 85 million, while in its first full year of operations (FY 1888-89) the system carried over 104 million passengers.\n\nInitial public reaction to consolidation was mixed, with detractors raising concerns that it would set the stage for the creation of a monopoly. For their part, proponents argued that the move would put an end to the inefficiencies of having competing railways (which had been held to blame for high levels of congestion and blockades on the streets of Boston), and a general improvement in service would be achieved as a result. In remarks made to stockholders shortly after the merger, Whitney himself defended consolidation on the grounds that \"the blockades occurring on the principal thoroughfares\" in Boston had reached the point of requiring a remedy, and that \"if [the West End] had not taken hold of this matter the city would surely have done something [instead].\"\n\nFollowing the completion of consolidation, the West End began to pursue the possibility of electrifying the system in order to improve performance and cut operating costs. To assess the practicality of mechanization, Whitney and general manager Daniel Longstreet made exploratory visits to several cities including Richmond, Virginia, where Frank Sprague had recently developed the first practical electric trolley line in the country. The success of the Richmond system convinced Whitney and Longstreet of the benefits of electrification, and the West End soon afterwards contracted with Sprague to build an experimental line in Boston.\n\nAt first, the company experimented with both overhead lines and ground-level conduits for power, but the latter was quickly abandoned when found to be impractical. After conducting test runs in late 1888, a line running between Boston and Brookline was opened on the first day of 1889, while a second line to Cambridge commenced operations on February 16. Within a few months the company was prepared to make electrification general and a contract was executed with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company to equip the entire West End system. The conversion inspired Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.'s 1891 poem \"The Broomstick Train, or The Return of the Witches\", in which he imagined the streetcars being propelled by the Salem witches with their broomsticks as the trolley poles. Horsecars would stop at any point upon passenger request, which became impractical with increased service; as lines were electrified, the West End designated stopping points with white-painted bands on poles.\n\nBy the end of 1892, electric trolleys accounted for two-thirds of total car mileage, while by 1894 they constituted over ninety percent of the total. Just five horsecar routes remained by the end of 1895. By the time the final pair (on Marlborough Street in the Back Bay) were discontinued on December 24, 1900, the only other horsecar operation in the state was a short line at Onset.\n\nOne of the largest challenges facing the West End during its history was in dealing with a massive rise in passenger usage, which resulted in ever-increasing levels of congestion on Boston city streets during the 1880s and 1890s. At first the management of the West End were slow in their efforts to address the issue, but in order to head off potential competition from rival companies they eventually offered several proposals for establishing rapid transit lines to relieve traffic within the city.\n\nInitially, the West End attempted to build an elevated railway to provide rapid transit into central Boston. In July 1890 the state legislature passed a measure authorizing the company to construct elevated railroads, and three months later Whitney unveiled a plan for a main line running between Roxbury and Charleston. In December of that year, however, preliminary work on the line was halted in the face of opposition by various parties, and from there the project eventually stalled out. Other proposals for the West End, including a highly controversial idea for a rail running through the Boston Common, were similarly never carried out, and ultimately no elevated or dedicated lines were put into place by the company.\n\nAnother idea for reducing congestion, a subway or tunnel line, was considered by the West End as early as 1887, but over the next few years it was unable to develop a serious workable proposal on this front. By the mid-1890s it was decided that the issue was best left to the state and local authorities to handle, and eventually the Boston Transit Commission was designated to build a subway for trolley cars running underneath Tremont Street in central Boston. In December 1896 the West End signed an agreement with the Transit Commission to lease the tunnel, known as the Tremont Street Subway (now the central part of the Green Line), for a period of twenty years upon completion. Under the terms of the lease, the company was to pay 4.875% per year on the lesser of $7,000,000 or the actual cost of the tunnel, with additional compensation to be owed based on volume of use.\n\nDuring this period, Whitney stepped down as president in September 1893 and was replaced with Samuel Little, a former organizer and treasurer of the Highland Street Railway.\n\nIn 1894, the Boston Elevated Railway was incorporated with a charter to develop a system of rapid transit routes within the greater Boston area. Among the group of investors in the new company was Josiah V. Meigs, the inventor of an experimental steam-powered monorail known as the Meigs Elevated Railway. The charter enabled the company to construct an elevated railway based either on the Meigs plan or an alternate approved design, but excluded any designs that were based on the existing Manhattan system in use in New York City.\n\nWithin a year of Boston Elevated's incorporation, the group behind it realized that they would be unable to raise sufficient capital to develop their proposed railway, and attempted to sell their charter off to a variety of parties, including the West End. The directors of the West End, however, considered the charter to be incompatible with their interests, in part due to the perceived impracticality of the Meigs system and the prohibition on emulating the Manhattan design. The board accordingly turned down an offer to acquire the Boston Elevated for $150,000, preferring instead to focus on existing operations and prepare for the upcoming opening of the subway.\n\nThe rejection of the purchase provoked disagreement among the shareholders of the West End, and a faction of investors who were in favor of the elevated railway system decided to take action against the board's decision. The group, which included Eben Dyer Jordan and William Bancroft and which was financially backed by Kidder, Peabody & Co. and J.P. Morgan, quickly acquired a controlling interest in the Boston Elevated and attempted to do the same with the West End. Following a highly-publicized proxy fight, the Kidder-Morgan faction managed to gain control of the board at the annual shareholders' meeting in November 1896, and a short time afterwards plans were formed to lease the West End system to the Boston Elevated on a long-term basis.\n\nIn June 1897, the state legislature authorized the lines and property of the West End to be leased to and operated by the Boston Elevated. The initial lease was initially for a 99-year term, under which shareholders of West End common stock would receive a fixed annual dividend of 8%. After this proposal was rejected by the Massachusetts Board of Railroad Commissioners in November 1897, the term was shortened to 25 years and the dividend rate was reduced to 7%. The modified lease was approved by the shareholders of the West End on December 9, 1897, and ratification by the board of railroad commissioners was received on December 18.\n\nIn 1900, Samuel Little resigned as president and was succeeded by Joseph B.

She has written essays and op-eds for publications worldwide on Egypt and the Islamic world, including women's issues and Muslim political and social affairs. Her work has appeared in \"The Washington Post\", \"The New York Times\", \"Christian Science Monitor\", and the \"Miami Herald\" among others. \"Headscarves and Hymens\", Eltahawy's first book, was published in May 2015. Eltahawy has also been a guest analyst on U.S. radio and television news shows. She is also acknowledged as one of the people who spearheaded the Mosque Me Too movement through the usage of the hashtag #MosqueMeToo.\n\nEltahawy has also spoken publicly at universities, panel discussions and interfaith gatherings on human rights and reform in the Islamic world, feminism and Egyptian Muslim–Christian relations in addition to her other concerns.\n\nEltahawy was born in Port Said, Egypt. Her family moved to the UK when she was 7 and then to Saudi Arabia when she was 15. She graduated from the American University in Cairo in 1990 with a bachelor's degree and in 1992 she earned a master's degree in Mass Communication with a concentration in Journalism.\n\nEltahawy was a news reporter throughout the 1990s, and a correspondent for the Reuters News Agency in Cairo and Jerusalem. Eltahawy has written for \"The Guardian\", \"The Washington Post\", the \"International Herald-Tribune\" and \"U.S. News and World Report\". \n\nShe moved to the United States in 2000 and gained American citizenship in 2011.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2004, Eltahawy was managing editor of the Arabic-language version of \"Women's eNews\", an independent, non-profit news website that covers women's issues from around the world.\n\nShe wrote a weekly column for the Saudi-owned, London-based international Arab publication \"Asharq Al-Awsat\" from 2004 to 2006 before her articles were discontinued by editor Tariq Alhomayed for being \"too critical\" of the Egyptian regime.\n\nOn November 24, 2011, she was arrested in Cairo while covering renewed protests in Tahrir Square. She was held in custody for 12 hours and accused those who held her of physical and sexual assault. Her left arm and right hand were fractured.\n\nOn September 25, 2012, Eltahawy was arrested for spraypainting over an American Freedom Defense Initiative advertisement in a New York City Subway station that read: \"In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad\".\n\nEltahawy's first book, \"Headscarves and Hymens: Why the Middle East Needs a Sexual Revolution\", was published in the United States on April 21, 2015 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The book is based on a piece about misogyny in Arab society which she wrote for \"Foreign Policy\" in 2012, entitled \"Why Do They Hate Us\".\n\nEltahawy was a board member of the Progressive Muslim Union of North America, during its existence, from 2004 to 2006.\n\nEltahawy has been a strong critic of both the regime of Hosni Mubarak and the Egypt-based Muslim Brotherhood, referring to both as \"old, out-of-touch men.\" In an interview in February 2011, she also expressed certainty that the Muslim Brotherhood could not \"gain the support of the majority of Egyptians.\" In November 2011, Eltahawy faced repercussions by Egyptian security forces as a result of her outspoken criticism. Eltahawy was covering the protests at Tahrir Square when she was brutally beaten and sexually assaulted by Egyptian riot police, breaking both of her arms. \n\nIn 2009, \"The Economist\" said that Eltahawy used the phrase \"the opium of the Arabs\" referring to Israel, describing, as the magazine elaborated, \"an intoxicating way for them to forget their own failings or at least blame them on someone else. Arab leaders have long practice of using Israel as a pretext for maintaining states of emergency at home and putting off reform.\"\n\nEltahawy speaks out on behalf of women's rights in the Arab world, including attacking female genital mutilation. In a May 2012 article in \"Foreign Policy\", she wrote, \"Name me an Arab country, and I'll recite a litany of abuses [of women] fueled by a toxic mix of culture and religion that few seem willing or able to disentangle lest they blaspheme or offend.\" She described herself as \"a secular, radical feminist Muslim\" in a 2011 interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was created to be Toronto's public meeting hall home to public gatherings, concerts, and exhibitions. Its main feature was a thousand-seat amphitheatre. For decades the hall was the centre of Toronto's social life before larger venues took over much of this business. Today the hall continues as a venue for events including weddings, conferences, and art shows.\n\nThe location was previously part of the Market Square area and had been the site of the first permanent market buildings as well as site of Joseph Bloor's Farmer's Arms Inn from 1824 to 1831. The Great Fire of Toronto in 1849 caused the northern portions of this building to be pulled down, leading to the building of the current St. Lawrence Market in 1850 a block south at what was then Palace Street, and today is known as Front Street. The vacated area at the corner of King and Jarvis was in the heart of the growing community. The new Renaissance Revival style building was designed by William Thomas.\n\nIt was here that prominent politicians such as John A. Macdonald and George Brown, Fathers of Confederation, addressed the people of Toronto. It was the main venue for musicians and other performers who came to the city. The lower levels were integrated into the market and were home to stores and businesses. A third storey section of the building was known as St. Patrick Hall, an important meeting place for the Irish Catholic Benevolent Union.\n\nBy the 1870s the growing city had a number of larger and more suitable performance venues and the Hall entered a long decline. It continued to serve a number of roles, including several years as the home of the National Ballet. The City of Toronto government fully restored the hall in 1967 to mark the Centennial of Confederation (and rebuilt the east wing which had completely collapsed). That same year it was designated as a National Historic Site. The first two Juno Awards ceremonies were presented here in 1970 and 1971.\n\nA remote detonated explosion, standing in for the groundbreaking of Canada's Wonderland theme park in the York Region town of Maple, took place from the Hall.\n\nThe site is protected under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act since 2009. The City of Toronto also notes that the \"Front Street right of way at 92 Front Street East is an Archaeologically Sensitive Area\".\n\nWilliam Thomas (c. 1799–26 December 1860) was an architect of both England and Canada. He immigrated to Toronto with his wife and 10 children from Leamington Spa, England due to the economic crisis in 1837. After his emigration to Toronto, his career as a city engineer and architect prospered. One of his well-recognized successful works in architecture after his settlement is St. Lawrence Hall.\n\nThomas’ work was undoubtedly influenced by 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture, the central Roman temple that consists of the pediment, four engaged Corinthian columns, and the three arches underneath very closely resemble the work of an Italian Classist architect, Andrea Palladio. The symmetrical composition of building elements is also a defining characteristic of Renaissance architecture. The Renaissance Revival was a clear goal of William Thomas, but the Hall reinterpreted the Italination in a vernacular and contemporary manner. St. Lawrence Hall is designed in a Victorian composition with a French mansard roof due to abundant snowfall in Ontario. The ornamental cupola on top of the main hall is another feature of the Hall.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1809177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809177", "title": "Rural purge", "text": "Rural purge\n\nThe \"rural purge\" of American television networks (in particular CBS) was a series of cancellations in the early 1970s of still-popular rural-themed shows with demographically skewed audiences, the majority of which occurred at the end of the 1970–71 television season. In addition to rural-themed shows such as \"Mayberry R.F.D.\", \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", and \"Green Acres\", the cancellations ended several highly rated variety shows that had been on CBS since the beginning of television broadcasting. CBS saw a dramatic change in direction with the shift, moving away from shows with rural themes and toward more appeal to urban and suburban audiences.\n\nStarting with \"The Real McCoys\", a 1957 ABC program, U.S. television had undergone a \"rural revolution\", a shift towards situation comedies featuring \"naïve but noble 'rubes' from deep in the American heartland\". CBS was the network most associated with the trend, with series such as \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", \"Green Acres\", \"Mister Ed\", \"Lassie\", \"Petticoat Junction\", and \"Hee Haw\". CBS aired so many of these rural-themed shows, many produced by Filmways, that it gained the nicknames the \"Country Broadcasting System\" and the \"Hillbilly Network\", a parody of their actual nickname, the Tiffany Network.\n\nBy 1966, industry executives were lamenting the lack of diversity in American television offerings and the dominance of rural-oriented programming on the Big Three television networks of the era, noting that \"ratings indicate that the American public prefer hillbillies, cowboys, and spies\".\n\nCBS vice president Michael Dann personally hated the rural-oriented programming he was airing (as did most television executives), but he kept the shows on the air in acknowledgement of their strong overall ratings, which he considered the most important measure of a program's success. Dann's superior, CBS president James T. Aubrey, likewise believed rural sitcoms were a crucial part of the network's formula for success, noting that at the time, advertisers wanted the audience that watched rural sitcoms. Robert Wood, a later president of CBS, pressured Dann to cancel the rural programs. Dann was forced out shortly after he responded, \"Just because the people who buy refrigerators are between 26 and 35 and live in Scarsdale, you should not beam your programming only at them.\"\n\nAs summarized for the Museum of Broadcast Communications:\nBy the late 1960s, … many viewers, especially young ones, were rejecting [rural-themed] shows as irrelevant to modern times. Mayberry's total isolation from contemporary problems was part of its appeal, but more than a decade of media coverage of the civil rights movement had brought about a change in the popular image of the small Southern town. \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\", was set on a U.S. Marine base between 1964 and 1969, but neither Gomer nor any of his fellow marines ever mentioned the war in Vietnam. CBS executives, afraid of losing the lucrative youth demographic, purged their schedule of hit shows that were drawing huge but older-skewing audiences.\n\nThe 1970 cuts were preceded in 1967, for similar reasons of viewer demographics, when CBS ordered cancellation of its remaining panel game shows, \"What's My Line?\", \"I've Got a Secret\", and \"To Tell the Truth\"; the latter continued in daytime for another year. These programs were still extremely profitable (mainly because of their low budgets) but performed poorly in demographics. The network attempted to incorporate more urban programming, including the innovative sitcom \"He & She\" in the 1967 season, but a clash with that show's lead-in (\"Green Acres\") led to its cancellation. \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\", likewise an innovative and far more successful program that appealed to a younger audience, also debuted in 1967.\n\nThe wave of cancellations was instigated by CBS executive Robert Wood, who replaced longtime CBS programming head Michael Dann with Fred Silverman, following research highlighting the greater attraction to advertisers of the young adult urban viewer demographic. Much of CBS's existing product either drew audiences that were too old and rural, or drew another undesirable demographic: young boys, who lacked disposable income of their own. \n\nThe numerous cancellations prompted Pat Buttram (\"Mr. Haney\" on one of the canceled shows, \"Green Acres\") to observe, \"It was the year CBS canceled everything with a tree—including \"Lassie\".\"\n\n\"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\" was the first of the rural-based shows to leave the air, not due to its theme but to Jim Nabors's desire to move to something else – \"reach for another rung on the ladder, either up or down\". He was given a new show, \"The Jim Nabors Hour\", as a replacement for the next season. \n\n\"Mayberry R.F.D.\", a direct continuation of \"The Andy Griffith Show\", finished number 4 for 1969 and was renewed for two more seasons, but ratings slipped to 15th by its final season. \n\nThe first of the cancellations was \"The Red Skelton Show\", which had finished the 1969–70 season as the number 7 show. It had however fallen out of the top 30 by 1971.\n\nThe success of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", \"All in the Family\", and newer, more urban variety shows such as \"The Carol Burnett Show\" in 1967 and \"The Flip Wilson Show\" in 1970, allowed cancellations of most of the \"undesired shows\" at the end of 1971, despite their high ratings and popularity. Both \"Green Acres\" and \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" had dropped from the Nielsen top 30 by the 1970–71 season, yet both shows continued to win their respective time slots and had a loyal following, warranting renewal for another season. Other shows still pulling in even higher ratings when canceled included \"Mayberry R.F.D.\", which finished the season at number 15, \"Hee Haw\" at number 16, and \"The Jim Nabors Hour\" at number 29.\n\nSilverman replaced much of the canceled programming in 1971 and 1972 with \"relevant\" fare. Following \"All in the Family\" were its many spinoffs including \"Maude\" and \"The Jeffersons\". Following the success of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", the series' production company MTM Productions would develop the popular \"The Bob Newhart Show\". \"M*A*S*H\" was added to the network in 1972, placing in the top 15 shows for 10 of its 11 seasons, and eventually aired the most watched single episode of any series in U.S. television history during its 1983 series finale.\n\nAn unusual side effect of the rural purge was the reduction of the laugh track. Most of the rural-oriented programs were filmed in the single-camera setup without a studio audience, with the canned laughter added by laugh-track proprietor Charley Douglass. The newer shows that came to television in the early 1970s were multiple-camera setups with live studio audiences, a trend that would become the norm throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with Douglass's laugh track mostly limited to sweetening. This was not possible for \"M*A*S*H\", which was filmed on location, but due to the occasionally serious nature of the material, producers of the military hospital dramedy did not want a laugh track to be used (CBS compromised, no laugh track was used in certain scenes, most notably the operating room).\n\nUnder Silverman's watch, game shows returned to the network's daytime schedule during this period, as well (unlike NBC or ABC, CBS had not carried a daytime game show since \"To Tell the Truth\" ended its run in 1968, instead opting for reruns of 1960s prime-time sitcoms such as \"The Lucy Show\" and \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\", both of which had left the air by that point). The first of these shows was \"The Amateur's Guide to Love\", which ran for three months in the Spring and Summer of 1972. Shortly afterward, on September 4, the network debuted three new game shows: \"The New Price Is Right\", \"Gambit\", and \"The Joker's Wild\". \"Gambit\" ran until 1976 and returned in 1980 for an additional year as \"Las Vegas Gambit\" on NBC; \"Joker\" ended its CBS run in 1975, then later ran in syndication from 1977 to 1986; and \"Price\" is in its 48th season as of October 2019.\n\nDespite the relatively large number of \"old guard\" variety shows canceled in the purge, Silverman actually continued to create new variety shows to replace the ones he had canceled; one of the first was \"The Sonny & Cher Show\", which debuted in February 1971 and would last until Sonny and Cher divorced in 1974 (Silverman then retained Cher's services, signing her to her own show in 1976, after which she agreed to reunite professionally with Sonny for its last year on air, before it ended in 1977). Silverman would later commission \"Donny & Marie\" for ABC five years later. He would also, with little success, commission \"The Brady Bunch Hour\" for ABC in 1976 and \"Pink Lady and Jeff\" and \"The Susan Anton Show\" for NBC in 1980, all three of which were received extremely poorly.\n\nSeveral conservative members of Congress, as well as President Richard Nixon and members of his administration, expressed displeasure at some of the replacement shows, many of which (especially the more socially conscious shows such as \"All in the Family\") were not particularly \"family-friendly\". The backlash from the purge prompted CBS to commission a rural family drama, \"The Waltons\", for its Fall 1972 schedule based on the TV film \"The Homecoming: A Christmas Story\" (1971). The network scheduled it in what it thought would be a death slot against popular series \"The Flip Wilson Show\" and \"The Mod Squad\", allegedly hoping the show would underperform and head to a quick cancellation. Instead, the show proved to be an instant hit, prompting CBS to put its full support behind the show; \"The Waltons\" went on to run for nine seasons, reaching as high as second in the Nielsens and finishing in the top 30 for seven of its nine years on air, and would become a perennial fixture in syndicated reruns for decades thereafter. The success of \"The Waltons\" started a trend for family dramas throughout the 1970s; such as \"Little House on the Prairie\", \"Apple's Way\", \"Family\", and \"Eight Is Enough\".\n\nNon-rural-themed shows canceled by CBS included sitcoms \"Family Affair\" and \"Hogan's Heroes\" in 1971, with the long-running \"My Three Sons\" ending in 1972. Variety shows that had been around since the late 1940s and early 1950s, such as \"The Jackie Gleason Show\" and \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", were canceled in 1970 and 1971, respectively; likewise, \"The Original Amateur Hour\" (a stalwart of network television since its debut, and before that on radio since 1934) ended on its own accord in 1970 due to the show's aging demographics. \"The Red Skelton Show\" was canceled by CBS at the end of the 1969–70 season, and was picked up by NBC (the series' original network) for one more season. NBC would also revert Skelton's show to its original half-hour format in place of its more familiar hour-long format on CBS. By the end of 1972, Lucille Ball remained the only long-time star from television's golden era to still have her own show. Ball's show, \"Here's Lucy\", still rated in the Nielsen top ten and would continue to pull in high ratings until its end in 1974. \n\nTV westerns were another genre targeted for cancellation; martial artist Bruce Lee, in attempting to pitch his series \"The Warrior\" to television networks, stated he was told \"the Western idea is out.\" Apart from \"Gunsmoke\" and \"Bonanza\", two prime-time staples which in 1971 had been on the air for a combined 28 years (and would continue to air until 1975 and 1973, respectively), most of the shows in the genre were already off the air at the time of the purge. NBC canceled two of the remaining Westerns in 1971, \"The Virginian\" and \"The High Chaparral\". The 1971 plan of CBS included cancellation of \"Gunsmoke\" at the end of the 1970–71 season, while \"Mayberry R.F.D.\" and \"Family Affair\" would be renewed for the 1971–72 season; Fred Silverman and Robert Wood both favored cancelling \"Gunsmoke\" over \"Mayberry R.F.D\". and \"Family Affair\". This was revised due to \"Gunsmoke's\" Top-10 Ratings, ranking #5 in the Nielsen Ratings for the 1970–71 season, rising to #4 in the 1971–72 season. Another factor was that \"Gunsmoke\" was the favorite TV program of Barbara Paley, wife of CBS Chief Executive William Paley. Westerns had already been targeted by parents' groups opposing television violence, and the genre's popularity was fading in the face of overexposure; following a boom in the format's popularity in the 1960s, the last traditional TV westerns debuted in 1968.\nABC seriously considered picking up \"Family Affair\" for the 1971-72 ABC prime time schedule to join its Friday night lineup alongside two other shows with similar audiences (\"The Brady Bunch\" and \"The Partridge Family\"), but concluded that \"Family Affair\" had run its course.\n\nThe following shows were canceled at the end of their respective seasons. Some shows did not necessarily have a rural theme, but were perceived to appeal primarily to rural and/or older audiences.\n\nThe following shows continued to air in first-run syndication past the end of the 1970s:\n\n"}

Often, the additional features are attached or related to the set, so as to provide it with some additional meaning or significance.\n\nA partial list of possible structures are measures, algebraic structures (groups, fields, etc.), topologies, metric structures (geometries), orders, events, equivalence relations, differential structures, and categories.\n\nSometimes, a set is endowed with more than one structure simultaneously, which allows mathematicians to study the interaction between the different structures more richly. For example, an ordering imposes a rigid form, shape, or topology on the set, and if a set has both a topology structure and a group structure, such that these two structures are related in a certain way, then the set becomes a topological group.\n\nMappings between sets which preserve structures (i.e., structures in the source or domain are mapped to equivalent structures in the destination or codomain) are of special interest in many fields of mathematics. Examples are homomorphisms, which preserve algebraic structures; homeomorphisms, which preserve topological structures; and diffeomorphisms, which preserve differential structures.\n\nIn 1939, the French group with the pseudonym Nicolas Bourbaki saw structures as the root of mathematics. They first mentioned them in their \"Fascicule\" of \"Theory of Sets\" and expanded it into Chapter IV of the 1957 edition.

He supported the French occupation of Spain and worked for the Bonapartist administration, but he is principally known for his travels in North Africa and the Middle East. He witnessed the Saudi conquest of Mecca in 1807.\n\nBadia was born in Barcelona on April 1, 1767. After receiving a liberal education, he devoted particular attention to the Arabic language, which he learned in Vera, Almería, where his father was a military accountant, and in London. He also made a special study of the manners and customs of Arabian lands.\n\nUnder the assumed name of Ali Bey el Abbassi, Badia spent the two years from 1803 to 1805 in Morocco, entertained by its king while pretending to be a descendant of the Abbasid caliphs. He then went to Mecca—then under the possession of the Wahabites—in order to perform the hajj. On his way, he stopped in Tripoli, Cyprus, and Egypt. By pretending to be a Muslim, he was able to enter places forbidden to others, such as Mecca and the Cave of Machpelah at Hebron. On his way back, he visited Jerusalem and Syria before reaching Constantinople in the autumn of 1807. There, he was for the first time suspected of not being a real Muslim and fled to French-occupied Spain.\n\nHaving returned home in 1807, he declared his support for King Joseph I. He was appointed intendant of Segovia and then Cordoba. On the abdication of King José following the French defeat at Vitoria in 1813, Badia fled to France. In 1814, he published a French account of his travels in three volumes. An English translation was published in 1816.

Records label. Due to a lawsuit with his former manager, Herb Cohen, Zappa's recording contract was temporarily reassigned from DiscReet Records to Warner Bros.\n\nThe title is a pun on the French expression \"Zut alors!\", which conveys mild surprise.\n\nThe album was originally conceptualized as a double LP, but Zappa rearranged, edited, and shortened the track listing to what was eventually released as a single album. Zappa played a test pressing of the original album for \"Circus\" magazine in 1976, which reported a radically different, though slightly erroneous track listing that included \"Sleep Dirt\", \"The Ocean Is the Ultimate Solution\", \"Filthy Habits\", and \"Night of the Iron Sausage\". The former three tracks eventually surfaced on the 1979 \"Sleep Dirt\" and the posthumous \"Läther\"; \"Night of the Iron Sausage\" remains unreleased, but was seemingly intended to be a guitar solo of fair length. \"Wind Up Workin' in a Gas Station\" and \"Zoot Allures\" were absent from test pressings.\n\nZappa recorded the album after completing a world tour with a band including Napoleon Murphy Brock on tenor sax and vocals, Andre Lewis on keyboards, Roy Estrada on bass and Terry Bozzio on drums. However, this band appeared only on the live track \"Black Napkins\" with only Bozzio retained to play on the sessions, although Lewis and Estrada contributed backing vocals. After Zappa's death, one of the band's 1976 concerts was released as \".\" By the time \"Zoot Allures\" was finished, Zappa had begun forming a new live band, including Bozzio, Patrick O'Hearn and Eddie Jobson, who were pictured on the cover with Zappa, although the latter two did not perform on the album.\n\n\"Black Napkins\", one of several guitar-driven pieces on \"Zoot Allures\", began life accompanied by themes that would later make up \"Sleep Dirt\". The performance heard on the album was culled from Zappa's February 3, 1976 performance in Osaka, Japan, though it was edited for the official release. Along with \"Zoot Allures\" and \"The Torture Never Stops\", \"Black Napkins\" became a signature piece for Zappa, featuring heavily in nearly every subsequent tour and several official releases.\n\n\"Wonderful Wino\" was originally released on Jeff Simmons' 1970 album, \"Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up\". The album, produced partially by Zappa (though credited as \"La Marr Bruister\"), also included the title track, which later appeared on 1979's \"Joe's Garage\".\n\nOn the liner notes to 1979's \"Sheik Yerbouti\", Zappa notes that \"Friendly Little Finger\" (from \"Zoot Allures\") was created using xenochrony.\n\nThe album's sound is influenced by heavy metal music, particularly that on the song \"Ms. Pinky\".\n\nAll tracks written by Frank Zappa, except \"Wonderful Wino\", written by Zappa and Jeff Simmons.\n\n\nKeyboardist Eddie Jobson and bassist Patrick O'Hearn, who by the time of \"Zoot Allures\"' release were members of Zappa's band, appear on the album's cover but do not perform on any tracks.\n\n\n\"Zoot Allures\" on compact disc, released by Rykodisc, is mixed differently than the original vinyl. The vinyl also contains a longer edit of \"Disco Boy\" including a count-off by a drum machine (the first three seconds) and a longer fade-out making the track's duration 5:27, as opposed to the CD duration of 5:11. The 2012 Universal remaster restores the original vinyl mix and improves the sound quality considerably.\n\nAlbum – \"Billboard\" (United States)\n"}

One of the first Chinese artists to establish a career in the West, Liu is regarded by many as \"the greatest Chinese painter in the US.\"\n\nLiu's paintings typically feature layered brushstrokes combined with washes of linseed oil which gives the imagery an indistinct and drippy appearance. Her paintings and prints often make use of anonymous Chinese historical photographs, particularly those of women, children, refugees, and soldiers, as subject matter. Although thought of predominantly as a painter, her body of work moves fluidly between painting, mixed-media and site-specific installation.\n\nA ten-year retrospective of Liu's work traveled nationally in the U.S. in 1998 and 1999. \"Summoning Ghosts: The Art of Hung Liu\" was a retrospective collection of Liu's work that remains the most extensive exhibit of her work to date, with paintings from more than 40 collections displayed.\n\nHung Liu was born in Changchun, People's Republic, China, in 1948. Shortly after her birth, her father was thrown into prison for being a member of the Kuomintang of China. In 1958, Hung Liu followed her aunt to Beijing at the age of 10 and entered the famous 北师大 女附中 (now The Experimental High School Attached to Beijing Normal University). In 1970, two years after the beginning of China's Cultural Revolution, Liu was sent to Huairou, a small village in the Beijing countryside, where she lived and worked among the local villagers from 1968 to 1972. She attended Beijing Teachers College in 1975 and studied mural painting as a graduate student at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. As a student Liu's art education had strict limits; the constrained and academic style which students were forced to emulate has been likened by Liu to paint-by-numbers. Although the use of cameras to aid painting was prohibited, Liu rebelled by secretly taking photographs of local farmers in Huairou with their families and making drawings of them.\nLiu's paintings typically feature layered brushstrokes combined with washes of linseed oil which gives the imagery an indistinct and drippy appearance. Various commenters have suggested that this visual strategy's surrealism and its absence of Socialist political drive can be seen as the opposite of (or a rejoinder to) the rigid academicism of the Chinese Socialist Realist style in which Liu was trained. It has also been characterized as a metaphor for the loss of historical memory: the dripping in Liu's paintings is described by art critic Bill Berkson as \"analogous to memory\" and how \"[memory] is blurred.\" Given the pathos that often infuses her works, her painting style has been described by Liu's partner, critic and curator Jeff Kelley, as a kind of \"weeping realism.\"\nLiu's paintings and prints often make use of anonymous Chinese historical photographs, particularly those of women, children, refugees, and soldiers, as subject matter. Many are drawn from the artist's personal collection of 19th century Chinese photographs, a large portion of which feature prostitutes. Liu believes her paintings \"gives a spirit to them, the forgotten.\" As curator Réne de Guzman writes, her paintings bring details of Chinese history and memory into the present for American viewer. Writing for the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Kelley suggests that Liu's paintings \"challenge the documentary authority of historical photographs by subjecting them to the more reflective process of painting [...] Much of the meaning in her paintings comes from the way the washes and drips dissolve the photo-based images, suggesting the passage of memory into history.\"\n\nSince the late 1990s Liu has occasionally taken historical photographs of non-Chinese women, refugees, migrants, workers, and children as a point of departure. Her \"Strange Fruit\" paintings of the early to mid 2000s depicted Korean \"comfort women\" forced to serve as prostitutes for Japanese soldiers in the second World War. Several of her paintings draw imagery from the portrait and documentary photographs of the Chinese populace by John Thomson. In her \"American Exodus\" series, Liu addresses American subject matter, creating images of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression after the photographs of Dorothea Lange.\n\nAlthough thought of predominantly as a painter, her body of work moves fluidly between painting, mixed-media and site-specific installation. Pieces such as \"Goddess of Love/Goddess of Liberty\" incorporate significant mixed-media elements (often antique or hand-made objects) either installed in close proximity to or mounted directly onto the piece. Liu cites her installation work as a continuation of the principles she utilizes as a muralist \"an ability to work in large scale and to take the site specificity of the situation into account. Creating an installation merely required pushing the work out into the third dimension\". Liu's paintings also often incorporate a sculptural dimensionality through the use of custom canvases shaped to the contours of their subject matter.\n\nLiu also disobeyed the ban against non-sanctioned art of the Maoist Regime in her series called \"My Secret Freedom.\" These miniature landscape paintings, created during Liu's time at Da Dulianghe, depict scenes of everyday life. Their title refers to the rebellion inherent in their creation: Liu had to hide a small paint box and brushes beneath her coat and painted each tiny image quickly. Jeff Kelley writes that Liu's \"intent was radical in China at the time: to paint not in the service of state ideology or party dicta, but simply to paint. To paint for the sheer pleasure of painting.\"\n\nLiu immigrated to the United States in 1984. She is a class of 1986 alumna of the University of California, San Diego.\n\nAs resident artist at Capp Street Project in San Francisco in 1988, Liu painted a series of works whose main focus was the issue of identity as it relates to immigrant status. Among these was the eponymous \"Resident Alien\". This was Liu's first self-portrait, in which the artist painted an enlarged version of her own green card with several pointed changes, e.g. her birthdate of 1948 becoming 1984, the date of her immigration, and her name comically replaced by the words \"Fortune Cookie.\" The off-site exhibition of these works brought Liu her first major art world attention; the painting \"Resident Alien\" also subsequently received numerous treatments and interpretations by scholars of gender identity and women's studies as well as art historians. Dong Isbister proposes that \"Resident Alien\" is best understood via a 'diasporic consciousness,' as Liu asks her audience to \"examine how her body is positioned and portrayed in relation to legal, racial, and gender issues based on immigration.\" The painting evidences the \"tension between an ethnic, a national and a transnational identity\"; at the same time, Liu \"shows resistance to being assimilated into the stereotypes imposed upon her by inserting her own voice.\" In 1988, as part of her Capp Street Project residency, Liu produced a mural, \"Reading Room\", for the Chinese for Affirmative Action Community Room in San Francisco's Chinatown.\n\nLiu's installation work \"Jiu Jin Shan (Old Gold Mountain)\" (1994) was originally commissioned by the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum. In this work, Liu created a \"gold mountain\" made of 200,000 fortune cookies, engulfing a crossroads of railroad tracks. The junction of the tracks references the cultural intersection of East and West, as well as the Chinese immigrants who perished during the building of the Sierra Nevada stage of the transcontinental railroad. \"Jiu Jin Shan (Old Gold Mountain)\" was also installed at the Mills College Art Museum in 2013 as part of the exhibition \"Hung Liu: Offerings\".\n\nIn November 2006, Liu's public art installation \"Going Away, Coming Home\" was unveiled at the Oakland International Airport. The installation is a 160-foot long wall of windows in the Terminal 2 concourse. The installation was commissioned by the Port of Oakland for $300,000.\n\nThe installation depicts 80 cranes that are meant to comfort and give blessings to people who are leaving their homes or returning from travel. Liu was inspired by a silk Chinese scroll painting from the 12th century, which also depicts cranes symbolizing good luck. Liu painted the work with enamel in her signature style of allowing the paint to drip. To make the work, she collaborated with the 140-year-old German glass fabrication company Derix Glasstudios.\n\n\"Summoning Ghosts: The Art of Hung Liu\" was a retrospective collection of Liu's work, including around 80 paintings and an assortment of photographs, studies, and sketchbooks. It remains the most extensive exhibit of her work to date, with paintings from more than 40 collections displayed. The exhibit featured works from throughout Liu's artistic career, beginning from the late 1960s; these paintings draw upon her personal history and experience of the Maoist regime, the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution, as well as drawing from themes of Ancient China. Réne de Guzman, the chief curator at the Oakland Museum of California, organized the exhibit in collaboration with Hung Liu. The artist describes the exhibit as a \"…full circle… [Comprising] where I come from, what I was interested in, and what was possible to do in China.\"\n\nLiu has received numerous awards, including two painting fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and a Joan Mitchell Fellowship. In 2011 she received an SGC International Award for Lifetime Achievement in Printmaking from the Southern Graphics Council. Other awards include a Society for the Encouragement of Contemporary Art (SECA) award and a Eureka Fellowship.\n\nShe is currently the Professor Emerita of Painting at Mills College in Oakland, California, where she taught from 1990 until retiring in 2014.\n\nLiu's work is held in the following public collections:\n\nIn addition to the exhibitions discussed above, Liu's work has appeared in exhibitions and venues including the following:\n\n"}

It was released on 12 May 1995 by Nuclear Blast. This is the first studio album to feature rhythm guitarist Mårten Hagström and the final to feature bassist Peter Nordin, as he left the band during the supporting tour due to vertigo.\n\nDescribing the record as \"one of the 90's definitive metallic works\", Kevin Stewart-Panko argues that \"Destroy Erase Improve's\" unique fusion of genres amounted to a new \"watermark\" for heavy metal upon its release. Metal critic Martin Popoff regards \"Destroy Erase Improve\" as the first clear demonstration of what would become the quintessential Meshuggah sound, wherein \"stutter gun\" riffs and \"upset apple cart time signatures\" are featured alongside \"bone-breaking\" percussion, an approach which resulted in considerable influence in the development of genres like mathcore and djent.

A nesting hole is excavated in large dead trees. The entrance is fairly large, about in diameter, and oval-shaped. \nFemale lays 2 to 3 white eggs, sometimes four. Incubation lasts about 9 to 14 days, by both sexes. Woodpeckers have short incubation period, but at contrary, nesting period is longer than in other birds’ species. Chicks are brooded and fed by both parents, and remain at nest for 3 to 4 weeks after hatching. Young remain within the family group until next breeding season.\n\nThe crimson-crested woodpecker is long and weighs . It is one of the largest woodpeckers in its range, though the higher elevation powerful woodpecker is roughly the same size.\n\nIt is all black above, has a red crest and has white lines running down the sides of the black throat and shoulders, which meet in a V on the back. The underparts are white, heavily barred with black. They show white on the wings in flight. Adult males have a red line from the bill to the throat and red on the front of the crown. In adult females, these plumage features are black.\n\nThe crimson-crested woodpecker somewhat resembles the pileated woodpecker of North America, but may be confused in its own range with the lineated woodpecker. The lineated woodpecker is the only bird of similar plumage and size. In that species, the white face line is narrower, and the white shoulder lines do not meet on the back.\n\nCrimson-crested woodpeckers chip out holes, often quite large, while searching out insects in trees. They mainly eat wood-boring insects and larvae, as well as ants, termites, small vertebrates and caterpillars. The animal matter is sometimes supplemented with berries. Several of these large woodpeckers may be seen (4 or more) attracted to the same dead tree while feeding.\n\nThe call of this widespread but wary bird is a loud, ringing \"CHEE-sic\". Both sexes drum.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1809220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809220", "title": "Reddy", "text": "Reddy\n\nReddy (also transliterated as \"Raddi\", \"Reddi\", \"Reddiar\", \"Reddappa\", \"Reddy\") is a caste that originated in India, predominantly settled in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. They are classified as a forward caste.\n\nThe origin of the Reddy has been linked to the Rashtrakutas, although opinions vary. At one time they were a warrior caste and later became feudal overlords and peasant proprietors. Historically they have been the land-owning aristocracy of the villages. Traditionally, they were a diverse community of merchants and cultivators. Their prowess as rulers and warriors is well documented in Telugu history. The Reddy dynasty (1325–1448 CE) ruled coastal and central Andhra for over a hundred years.\n\nAccording to Alain Daniélou and Kenneth Hurry, the Rashtrakuta and Reddy dynasties may both have been descended from the earlier dynasty of the Rashtrikas. This common origin is by no means certain: there is evidence suggesting that the Rashtrakuta line came from the Yadavas in northern India and also that they may simply have held a common title. Either of these alternate theories might undermine the claim to a connection between them and the Reddys.\n\nThe varna designation of Reddys is a contested and complex topic. Even after the introduction of the varna concept to south India, caste boundaries in south India were not as marked as in north India, where the four-tier varna system placed the priestly Brahmins on top followed by the Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. In south India, on the other hand, there existed only three distinguishable classes, the Brahmins, the non-Brahmins and the Dalits. The two intermediate dvija varnas—the Kshatriyas and Vaishyas—did not exist.\n\nThe dominant castes of south India, such as Reddys and Nairs, held a status in society analogous to the Kshatriyas and Vaishyas of the north with the difference that religion did not sanctify them, i.e. they were not accorded the status of Kshatriyas and Vaishyas by the Brahmins in the Brahmanical varna system. Historically, land-owning castes like the Reddys have belonged to the regal ruling classes and are analogous to the Kshatriyas of the Brahmanical society.\n\nThe Brahmins, on top of the hierarchical social order, viewed the ruling castes of the south like the Reddys, Nairs and Vellalars as sat-Shudras meaning shudras of \"true being”. Sat-shudras are also known as clean shudras, upper shudras, pure or high-caste shudras. This classification and the four-tier varna concept was never accepted by the ruling castes.\n\nDuring the Kakatiya period, \"Reddi\", together with its variant \"Raddi\", was used as a status title (\"gaurava-vachakamu\"). The title broadly represented the category of village headmen irrespective of their hereditary background.\n\nThe Kakatiya prince Prola I (c. 1052 to 1076) was referred to as \"Prola Reddi\" in an inscription. After the Kakatiyas became independent rulers in their own right, various subordinate chiefs under their rule are known to have used the title Reddi. Reddy chiefs were appointed as generals and soldiers under the Kakatiyas. Some Reddys were among the feudatories of Kakatiya ruler Pratapa Rudra. During this time, some of the Reddys carved out feudal principalities for themselves. Prominent among them were the Munagala Reddy chiefs. Two inscriptions found in the Zamindari of Munagala at Tadavayi, two miles west of Munagala—one dated 1300 CE, and the other dated 1306 CE show that the Munagala Reddy chiefs were feudatories to the Kakatiya dynasty. The inscriptions proclaim Annaya Reddy of Munagala as a chieftain of Kakatiya ruler Pratapa Rudra.\n\nThe Reddy feudatories fought against attacks from the Delhi sultanate and defended the region from coming under the Turkic rule. Eventually, the Sultanate invaded Warangal and captured Pratapa Rudra in 1323.\n\nAfter the death of Pratapa Rudra in 1323 CE and the subsequent fall of the Kakatiya empire, some Reddi chiefs became independent rulers. Prolaya Vema Reddi proclaimed independence, establishing a \"Reddi dynasty\" based in Addanki. He had been part of a coalition of Telugu rulers who overthrew the \"foreign\" ruler (Turkic rulers of the Delhi Sultanate).\n\nThe dynasty (1325–1448 CE) ruled coastal and central Andhra for over a hundred years.\n\nThe post-Kakatiya period saw the emergence of Vijayanagara Empire as well as the Reddy dynasty. Initially, the two kingdoms were locked up in a territorial struggle for supremacy in the coastal region of Andhra. Later, they united and became allies against their common archrivals—the Bahmani sultans and the Recherla Velamas of Rachakonda who had formed an alliance. This political alliance between Vijayanagara and the Reddy kingdom was cemented further by a matrimonial alliance. Harihara II of Vijayanagara gave his daughter in marriage to Kataya Vema Reddy’s son Kataya. The Reddy rulers exercised a policy of annexation and invasion of Kalinga (modern day Odisha). However, the suzerainty of Kalinga rulers was to be recognised. In 1443 CE, determined to put an end to the aggressions of the Reddy kingdom, the Gajapati ruler Kapilendra of Kalinga formed an alliance with the Velamas and launched an attack on the Reddy kingdom. Veerabhadra Reddy allied himself with Vijayanagara ruler Devaraya II and defeated Kapilendra. After the death of Devaraya II in 1446 CE, he was succeeded by his son, Mallikarjuna Raya. Overwhelmed by difficulties at home, Mallikarjuna Raya recalled the Vijayanagara forces from Rajahmundry. Veerabhadra Reddy died in 1448 CE. Seizing this opportunity, Kapilendra sent an army under the leadership of his son Hamvira into the Reddy kingdom, took Rajahmundry and gained control of the Reddy kingdom. The Gajapatis eventually lost control after the death of Kapilendra, and the territories of the former Reddy kingdom came under the control of the Vijayanagara Empire.\n\nLater, Reddys became the military chieftains of the Vijayanagara rulers. They along with their private armies accompanied and supported the Vijayanagara army in the conquest of new territories. These chieftains were known by the title of Poligars. The Reddy poligars were appointed to render military services in times of war, collect revenue from the populace and pay to the royal treasury. The chieftains exercised considerable autonomy in their respective provinces. The ancestors of the legendary Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy – who led an armed rebellion against the British East India company, were poligars. Reddys were historically dominant in the Rayalaseema region.\n\nOnce independent, the erstwhile chiefs of the Vijayanagara empire indulged in several internal squabbles for supremacy in their areas. This constant warring between powerful feudal warlords for fiefdoms and power manifests itself even in modern-day Rayalaseema in the form of a brutally violent phenomenon termed as “factionalism”, “factional violence” or simply “faction”.\n\nDuring this period, Reddys ruled several \"samsthanams\" (tributary estates) in the Telangana area. They ruled as vassals of Golkonda sultans. Prominent among them were Ramakrishna Reddy, Pedda Venkata Reddy and Immadi Venkata Reddy. In the 16th century, the Pangal fort situated in Mahbubnagar district of Andhra Pradesh was ruled by Veera Krishna Reddy. Immadi Venkata Reddy was recognised by the Golkonda sultan Abdullah Qutb Shah as a regular provider of military forces to the Golkonda armies. The Gadwal samsthanam situated in Mahbubnagar includes a fort built in 1710 CE by Raja Somtadari. Reddys continued to be chieftains, village policemen and tax collectors in the Telangana region, throughout the Golkonda rule.\n\nOne of most prominent figures from the community during the British period is Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy. He challenged the British and led an armed rebellion against the British East India company in 1846. He was finally captured and hanged in 1847. His uprising was one of the earlier rebellions against the British rule in India, as it was 10 years before the famous Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n\nReddys were the landed gentry known as the deshmukhs and part of the Nizam of Hyderabad's administration. The Reddy landlords styled themselves as \"Desais\", \"Doras\" and \"Patel\". Several Reddys were noblemen in the court of Nizam Nawabs and held many high positions in the Nizam's administrative set up. Raja Bahadur Venkatarama Reddy was made Kotwal of Hyderabad in 1920 CE during the reign of the seventh Nizam Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII. Raja Bahadur Venkatarama Reddy was the first Hindu to be made kotwal of Hyderabad as in the late 19th and early 20th century, during the Islamic rule of the Nizams, the powerful position of Kotwal was held only by Muslims. His tenure lasted almost 14 years and he commanded great respect among the public for his outstanding police administration.\n\nSeveral Reddys were at the forefront of the anti-Nizam movement. In 1941, communist leaders Raavi Narayana Reddy and Baddam Yella Reddy transformed the Andhra Mahasabha into an anti-Nizam united mass militant organisation and led an armed struggle against the Nizam's regime.\n\nSome of the prominent Reddy zamindaris/samsthanams:\n\n\nKammas and Reddys are politically dominant castes prior to the formation of Andhra Pradesh in 1956 and after. Reddys are classified as a Forward Caste in modern India's positive discrimination system. They are a politically dominant community in Andhra Pradesh, their rise having dated from the formation of the state in 1956.\n\n"}
