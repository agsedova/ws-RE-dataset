Also known to the \"Kriegsmarine\" as Schiff 10; to the Royal Navy she was Raider E. She was named after the Germanic deity Thor.\n\nFormerly the cargo ship \"Santa Cruz\", she was built by Deutsche Werft, Hamburg, (DWH) in 1938, and was owned and operated by the Oldenburg Portuguese Line (OPDR), Hamburg. In the winter of 1939–40 the navy requisitioned her and had her converted into an auxiliary warship by DWH. She was commissioned as the commerce raider \"Thor\" in March 1940.\n\nThe \"Thor\" began its first combat cruise on 6 June 1940, under the command of Captain Otto Kähler. \"Thor\" spent 329 days at sea, and sank or captured 12 ships with a combined tonnage of .\n\n\"Thor\" stopped her first victim on 1 July, the 9290-ton Dutch cargo ship \"Kertosono\", which was carrying a cargo of petrol, timber, asphalt, and agricultural machinery. Kähler decided to send her under a prize crew to Lorient, France, where she arrived safely 12 days later. At the time, \"Thor\" was disguised as a Yugoslavian freighter.\n\nOn 7 July \"Thor\" encountered \"Delambre\", a British freighter. \"Thor\" fired several broadsides, the third of which hit \"Delambre\", stopping her dead in the water, after which \"Thor\"s boarding party scuttled the ship with demolition charges.\n\nTwo days later \"Thor\" intercepted the Belgian freighter \"Bruges\", which was carrying a cargo of wheat. \"Bruges\" was scuttled, and her crew of 44 was taken aboard \"Thor\". On the 14th, \"Thor\" stopped another freighter carrying wheat, the British \"Gracefield\", and sank her by demolition charges.\n\nOn 16 July \"Thor\" attacked the British freighter \"Wendover\" without warning, as \"Wendover\" was seen to be armed. \"Wendover\" was hit by several shells from \"Thor\" and set on fire. A boarding party set demolition charges which caused \"Wendover\" to capsize, and she was then sunk by gunfire. 36 of the \"Wendover's\" crew of 40 survived: two crew including the radio operator were killed in the attack; two more were wounded and died of their injuries while aboard \"Thor\".\n\nThe Dutch freighter \"Tela\", \"en route\" to the UK, was intercepted on 17 July. \"Thor\" fired a shot across her bow; she stopped without sending distress signals. The crew of 33 abandoned ship and were taken aboard \"Thor\", and \"Tela\" was sunk by demolition charges.\n\nOn 28 July, \"Thor\" encountered the British armed merchant cruiser HMS \"Alcantara\", which was armed with eight six-inch (150 mm) main guns. Kähler turned away from \"Alcantara\" and tried to outrun her for three hours until he realized \"Alcantara\" was faster than \"Thor\". At that point Kähler decided to turn and fight, hoping to inflict enough damage on \"Alcantara\" to allow \"Thor\" to escape. \"Thor\" scored three early hits on \"Alcantara\": one between her bridge and funnel, a second aft, and a third on her waterline that caused flooding in her engine room, forcing \"Alcantara\" to reduce speed. \"Thor\" turned away from \"Alcantara\" and received two hits from her six-inch guns, killing three crew members. Instead of risking further combat, \"Thor\" made her escape under cover of a dense smokescreen.\n\nAfter the battle with \"Alcantara\", \"Thor\" repaired her battle damage, cleaned her boilers and changed her disguise. \"Thor\" rendezvoused with the supply ship \"Rekum\" on 25 August and then returned to Brazilian waters. Two weeks later, on Sept 8, the Yugoslav \"Federico Glavic\" was stopped, but allowed to proceed unmolested, as Yugoslavia was neutral at the time. On 26 September \"Thor\"s float plane discovered the Norwegian whale-oil tanker \"Kosmos\", which was carrying over 17,000 tons of whale oil. The \"Kosmos\" would have been a highly valuable prize ship, but the fact that she was short of fuel, slow, and easily recognizable made keeping her as a prize unfeasible. Kähler ordered \"Kosmos\" to be sunk by gunfire.\n\nOn 8 October \"Thor\" caught the 8,715 ton British refrigeration ship \"Natia\". \"Thor\" scored a direct hit, which stopped \"Natia\" dead in the water, though she continued wireless transmissions. \"Thor\" hit \"Natia\" seven or eight more times with gunfire, and a torpedo that tore open her side. Another 35 rounds were fired before she sank. 84 of \"Natia's\" 85 crew were taken aboard \"Thor\", bringing her total to 368. Most of these prisoners were transferred to the supply ship \"Rio Grande\" in mid November.\n\nOn 5 December \"Thor\" encountered another armed merchant cruiser, , a 20,062 ton ship armed with eight and two three-inch anti-aircraft guns. \"Thor\" carried three of her four guns aft, so Kähler decided to force \"Carnarvon Castle\" into a stern chase. \"Thor's\" gunners found their target in the fourth salvo, after which Kähler changed course, turning the chase into a circular fight in order to bring \"Thor's\" entire broadside to bear. \"Thor\" was in command of the engagement; her gunners registered more than 20 hits, forcing \"Carnarvon Castle\" to turn and flee to Montevideo, Uruguay. Six of \"Carnarvon Castle\"s crew had been killed, and 32 more were wounded.\n\nAfter this engagement \"Thor\" was ordered to rendezvous with the to transfer men for prize crews for 's captured whaling fleet.\n\nOn 25 March \"Thor\" intercepted , an 8,800 ton British passenger ship. After scoring several hits on the fleeing ship, Kähler allowed her to be abandoned, before firing 16 rounds into her waterline, sinking her. German wireless operators intercepted a message from a nearby British warship approaching at full speed from about away. Kähler decided to not risk encountering her, and reasoned that the British ship would arrive and assist those in the water. Unfortunately, the British warship failed to find the survivors. 331 out of about 520 survivors were ultimately rescued, primarily by the Spanish ships \"Cabo de Hornos\", \"Raranga\", and \"Bachi\". 33 survivors eventually reached land at Sao Luis, on the coast of Brazil, after 23 days and adrift at sea.\n\nOn the same day, 25 March, \"Thor\" stopped the 5,045 ton Swedish motor vessel \"Trollenholm\". Sweden was neutral in World War II, but \"Trollenholm\" was found to have been chartered by the British to take coal from Newcastle to Port Said. In less than 90 minutes, all 31 crewmen from \"Trollenholm\" were transferred to \"Thor\", and the freighter was sunk by demolition charges.\nOn her return trip to Germany, \"Thor\" encountered a third armed merchant cruiser off the Cape Verde islands. This was , a ship armed with eight and three guns. \"Thor\" approached head on, and in response to \"Voltaire's\" signalling of a series of AAA's (an order for a ship to identify itself), fired a shot across \"Voltaire's\" bow. \"Thor\"s first salvo hit \"Voltaire\"s generator and radio room, rendering her unable to transmit any further signals. \"Voltaire\" was turned into an inferno. Two of \"Voltaire's\" six inch guns continued to fire, but they scored only one hit on \"Thor\", disabling her radio aerial. \"Voltaire\"s obsolete guns overheated and had to cease firing, at which point the \"Voltaire\" raised a white flag. \"Thor\" began rescuing \"Voltaire\"s crew from a safe distance of 4,000 yards to avoid damage from any secondary explosions. \"Voltaire\"s captain and 196 men were rescued out of a crew of 296.\n\nThe last ship intercepted by \"Thor\" on her first cruise was on 16 April, on her way back to Germany; the Swedish ore carrier \"Sir Ernest Cassel\". Two warning shots were fired, which stopped the ship; her crew was taken aboard \"Thor\", and she was sunk by demolition charges.\n\n\"Thor\" set out on her second cruise on 30 November 1941 under the command of Captain Günther Gumprich. \"Thor\" sank or captured 10 ships on her second cruise, a total of 58,644 tons, during 328 days of operation.\n\nOn 13 March \"Thor\" was stopped by the British cruiser . \"Thor\" identified herself as the British freighter \"Levernbank\", which satisfied \"Durban\", who went on her way. The following day \"Thor\" was again challenged, this time by the armed merchant cruiser \"Cheshire\". \"Thor\" again identified herself as a British freighter, and was allowed to proceed.\n\n\"Thor\" found her first victim on 23 March, the 3,490 ton Greek freighter \"Pagasitikos\". Her crew of 33 was taken aboard \"Thor\", and she was sunk by a torpedo. The next day, 24 March, \"Thor\" replenished her stocks from the supply ship \"Regensburg\".\n\nOn 30 March \"Thor\" chased the 4,470 ton British freighter \"Wellpark\" for seven hours. Gumprich sent his seaplane to strafe the freighter, but was driven off when \"Thor\" opened fire on \"Wellpark\". Within 15 minutes, the \"Wellpark's\" crew abandoned ship, and she was sunk.\n\nOn 1 April \"Thor\" intercepted another British freighter, the 4,565 ton \"Willesden\". Gumprich again ordered his floatplane to destroy the vessel's radio aerial before opening fire from \"Thor\". After the plane's strafing run, \"Thor\" opened fire with her guns, and set oil drums on the \"Willesden's\" deck on fire, forcing most of the crew to abandon the ship. The only remaining crew were the gunners, but they managed to fire only six shots before they were also forced to abandon ship. \"Thor\" fired 128 shells into \"Willesden\" and finished her off with a torpedo.\n\nTwo days later on the 3rd, the Norwegian freighter \"Aust\" fell victim to the same tactics. She was unable to send a distress or raider signal before she was disabled and sunk by demolition charges.\n\nOn 10 April \"Thor\" detected the 4,840 ton British freighter \"Kirkpool\" on her radar, the first installed on an armed merchant cruiser. Poor visibility and fog forced Gumprich to abandon his usual tactics and instead shadow \"Kirkpool\" until nightfall. At close range, \"Thor\" attacked first with a torpedo and a salvo of her guns, both of which missed. The second salvo scored three hits and set \"Kirkpool's\" bridge and wheelhouse alight. With the helm unattended, \"Kirkpool\" veered towards \"Thor\" in what appeared to be an attempt to ram her attacker, which was avoided. \"Kirkpool's\" crew began abandoning ship, and after a three-hour search, 32 men were rescued from the water, including \"Kirkpool\"s captain, chief engineer and first officer. The ship was sunk with a torpedo.\n\nAll of \"Thor\"s victims thus far were near the Cape of Good Hope, in the shipping lanes. The Kriegsmarine High Command (SKL) ordered \"Thor\" to move into the Indian Ocean, but warned her to be aware of Japanese submarines operating in the area.\n\nOn 10 May \"Thor's\" seaplane sighted the 7,130 ton Australian liner \"Nankin\", en route to Bombay. From a range of 13,000 yards \"Thor\" opened fire with her guns, scoring several hits. \"Nankin\"s Captain gave the order to abandon ship and lowered his flags. The crew attempted to scuttle her, but the German boarding party managed to repair the damage done to the ship's engines. \"Nankin\" was renamed \"Leuthen\" and taken as a prize ship to rendezvous with \"Regensburg\". Following resupply and prisoner transfer, \"Leuthen\" and \"Regensburg\" both sailed to Japanese-held ports. She was carrying secret papers from the New Zealand \"Combined Intelligence Centre\" in Wellington to the C-in-C, Eastern Fleet in Colombo.\n\nOn 14 June \"Thor's\" radar picked up a contact at 10,000 yards, and by using a converging course, was able to approach to within 1,800 yards, \"Thor\" attacked what turned out to be the 6,310 ton Dutch Shell tanker \"Olivia\". The first salvo set \"Olivia\" ablaze, killing most of the crew. The third officer, three other Dutchmen and eight Chinese were able to lower one boat, but \"Thor\" was able to find only one man in the water. These 12 men were adrift for a month before their boat capsized in the breakers off Madagascar; one Dutch and seven Chinese mariners had died during the month at sea.\n\nFive days later on the 19th, \"Thor\" intercepted the Norwegian oil tanker \"Herborg\". Her seaplane disabled \"Herborg\"s radio aerial, and a warning salvo from \"Thor\" brought \"Herborg\" to a stop. The entire crew was taken aboard \"Thor\", and a prize crew took the renamed \"Hohenfriedburg\" to Japan.\n\nOn 4 July \"Thor\" stopped another Norwegian oil tanker, the 5,895 ton \"Madrono\", in the same manner as \"Herborg\". A prize crew took her to Japan as well, renamed as \"Rossbach\". \"Rossbach\" was eventually torpedoed by the American submarine , in the Kii Channel, Japan, in May 1944.\n\n\"Thor's\" tenth and final victim was on 20 July, the British refrigerated freighter \"Indus\". She put up a fight, turning away at full speed and firing her stern gun, but she fired only two shots before a shell from \"Thor\" hit the gun directly, killing the chief gunner and destroying the gun. The freighter's radio operator kept up a steady stream of distress signals, until another shell from \"Thor\" hit the bridge, killing him and knocking out the radio, and setting the bridge on fire. \"Indus\" was now a raging inferno, and most of her crew went overboard. \"Thor\" ceased firing and rescued 49 survivors before finishing \"Indus\" off.\n\n\"Thor\" transferred her prisoners to the blockade runner \"Tannenfels\", and made for Yokohama, Japan, \"via\" Batavia in the Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies.\n\n\"Thor\" reached Yokohama on 9 October 1942 where she began refitting for a third voyage. However, on 30 November a series of explosions on the supply ship destroyed her superstructure, sending a large amount of burning debris onto \"Thor\", which was moored alongside. Both ships were rapidly set ablaze, along with \"Nankin/Leuthen\" and the Japanese freighter \"Unkai Maru\". All four ships were destroyed in the fire, and 12 of \"Thor's\" crew were killed. \"Thor\" was wrecked beyond repair and was abandoned. Her captain, \"Kapitän zur See\" Gumprich, later commanded the on her second raiding voyage, from which he did not return.\n\nA number of survivors of the ship were sent to France on the blockade runner \"Doggerbank\" and killed when the ship was mistakenly sunk by on 3 March 1943 with all but one of her 365 crew lost.\n\n"}

He played a wide variety of supporting roles and was a prolific character actor. During the 1960s he played small roles in madcap comedies, usually portraying caricatures of counter culture personalities, such as deadbeat son Sylvester Marcus in \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" and the hippie actor Lorenzo Saint DuBois (\"L.S.D.\") in \"The Producers\" (1968).\n\nShawn was born in Buffalo, New York, and raised in adjacent Lackawanna.\n\nHe portrayed Sylvester Marcus, son of Mrs. Marcus (Ethel Merman), in Stanley Kramer's \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963) and easygoing Lorenzo St. DuBois/Adolf Hitler in the musical \"Springtime for Hitler\", the play within Mel Brooks's movie \"The Producers\" (1968). He also provided the Snow Miser's voice in \"The Year Without a Santa Claus\" (1974).\n\nHe performed his stand-up comedy act for over 35 years in nightclubs around the world. His award-winning one-man stage show, \"The Second Greatest Entertainer in the Whole Wide World\", was sometimes performed with a unique opening. When the audience entered the theater, they saw a bare stage with a pile of bricks in stage center. When the play began, Shawn emerged from the pile of bricks. The startling effect of this required complete concentration and breath control because the slightest movement of the bricks could ruin the surprise appearance.\n\nIn addition to roles in more than 30 movies and seven Broadway productions, Shawn made television appearances, toured often, and periodically performed a one-man show that mixed songs, sketches, and pantomime. He was a speaker at the Friars Club Roasts in Los Angeles and New York. At one of the X-rated roasts (a 1986 \"Playboy\" roast of Tommy Chong) that had overdosed on tasteless routines by previous speakers, Shawn walked up to the microphone, took a long pause, and \"vomited\" pea soup onto himself and other speakers at the dais.\n\nHis TV appearances included \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", TV movies, sitcoms (including \"Three's Company\" on which he played Jack Tripper's father), dramas including \"St. Elsewhere\" and \"Magnum, P.I.\", and a music video for \"Dance\" by the hair metal band Ratt (1986). In the UK he appeared in Sunday Night at the London Palladium in 1958.\n\nAmongst his roles in anthology TV series, he starred in an \"Amazing Stories\" episode \"Miss Stardust\", directed by Tobe Hooper, about a bizarre intergalactic beauty pageant, and played the Emperor in \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" in Shelley Duvall's \"Faerie Tale Theatre\". He filled in for vacationing Johnny Carson as guest host on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" on January 1, 1971, which saw the last cigarette commercial on American television (for Virginia Slims) aired on TV, one minute before the cigarette ads were banned.\n\nJim Knipfel and Mark Evanier claim that Andy Kaufman was inspired by Shawn.\n\nShawn married Rita Bachner in 1946, and they had four children: Amy, Wendy (married to John Travolta's older brother Joey Travolta), Adam, and Jennifer. He had one grandchild, Rachel Travolta. He was a longtime resident of Englewood, New Jersey.\n\nOn April 17, 1987, during a performance at University of California, San Diego's Mandeville Hall—which included his portrayal of a politician reciting such campaign clichés as \"If elected, I will not lay down on the job\"—Shawn suffered a fatal heart attack and collapsed face-down on the stage. The audience initially assumed that it was part of his act; but after he had remained motionless on the stage for several minutes, a stage hand examined him and asked if a physician was present.\n\nAfter CPR had been initiated, the audience was asked to leave the auditorium, but most remained, still assuming that it was all part of Shawn's act. Many began leaving—still unsure of what they had witnessed—only after paramedics arrived. A notice in the following day's \"San Diego Union\" newspaper announced that Shawn had indeed died during the performance. He was 63 years old. Shawn was interred at Hillside Memorial Park, a Jewish cemetery in Culver City, California.\n\n"}
{"id": "1867952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867952", "title": "Dancing Brave", "text": "Dancing Brave\n\nDancing Brave (11 May 1983 – 2 August 1999) was an American-bred, British-trained thoroughbred racehorse. In a racing career which lasted from the autumn of 1985 until October 1986 he ran ten times and won eight races. he was the outstanding European racehorse of 1986 when he won the 2000 Guineas, the Eclipse Stakes, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. His only defeats came in The Derby and the Breeders' Cup Turf. He was retired to stud where he was a successful sire of winners in Europe before being exported to Japan where he died in 1999.\n\nDancing Brave was a bay colt with a white snip and three white feet, standing sixteen hands high, bred by the Glen Oak Farm in Kentucky. He was not a particularly attractive individual as a young horse, being described as parrot-mouthed with imperfect forelegs. Dancing Brave was sired by Lyphard out of Navajo Princess, a mare who won sixteen races including the Molly Pitcher Handicap. Navajo Princess was a descendant of the mare Stolen Kiss, who was the ancestor of notable racehorses including the Epsom Derby winner Henbit and the Kentucky Derby winner Lucky Debonair.\n\nHe was purchased as a yearling by James Delahooke, on behalf of Khalid Abdullah for US$200,000 in Kentucky. The colt was sent into training with Guy Harwood at Pulborough. At the time, Harwood was noted for his modern approach to training, introducing Britain to features such as artificial gallops and barn-style stabling.\n\nDancing Brave was a May foal, and as Harwood did not believe in racing horses until they were at least two years and three months old, the colt was given only light training until late summer. Dancing Brave made his first racecourse appearance in the one-mile Dorking Stakes at Sandown in which he started odds-on favourite against three opponents. He won easily by three lengths from Mighty Memory. In the Soham House Stakes at Newmarket, Dancing Brave again started favourite after reports that he had been performing better at home than the stable's William Hill Futurity winner Bakharoff. He won by two and a half lengths from Northern Amethyst, with Nisnas in third. Despite never having contested a Group Race and being rated eleven pounds below the top-rated Bakharoff in the International Classification, he was made 10/1 winter favourite for the following year's 2000 Guineas.\n\nDancing Brave opened his three-year-old campaign with a victory over Faraway Dancer and Mashkour in the Craven Stakes at Newmarket in April. Over the same course and distance two weeks later he started 15/8 favourite against fourteen opponents in the 2000 Guineas. Ridden by Greville Starkey, he quickened in the closing stages of a slowly run race to win by three lengths from Green Desert and Huntingdale. Describing the race years later Walter Swinburn said that he felt he was certain to win on Green Desert before Dancing Brave \"just powered past him and mowed him down\". After the race, Starkey was confident that the colt would stay one and a half miles in the Derby, although Harwood was more cautious.\n\nIn The Derby a month later Dancing Brave started favourite, despite concerns about his ability to stay the distance of twelve furlongs. Starkey employed exaggerated waiting tactics and Dancing Brave was close to last place entering the home straight. Switched to the outside to make his challenge, Dancing Brave accelerated in the last quarter mile, being clocked at 10.3 seconds for the penultimate furlong. He failed to catch the leader Shahrastani finishing second by half a length. His jockey, Greville Starkey, was widely criticised for his tactics, but he has been defended by others, including Harwood, who pointed out that the race was run at a muddling pace and that Starkey could only have won if he had \"cut the horse in half\", which as the stable jockey he was unwilling to do. Starkey kept the ride for Dancing Brave's next race, Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park. Racing against older horses for the first time he won in \"breathtaking style\" by four lengths from Triptych and Teleprompter. However, when Starkey was injured and unable to ride the horse in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot he was replaced by Pat Eddery who became the preferred choice in the colt's remaining races. The Ascot race saw a rematch between Dancing Brave and Shahrastani. Since winning the Derby, Shahrastani had won the Irish Derby by eight lengths and started favourite for the King George. Eddery produced Dancing Brave's run earlier than usual, taking him into the lead over a furlong from home and the colt had to be ridden out to hold off Shardari by three-quarters of a length, with Triptych third, Shahrastani fourth and Petoski fifth.\n\nAfter a break, Dancing Brave returned in the Select Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in September. He tracked the leaders before pulling away in the closing stages to win by ten lengths. On his final European appearance, Dancing Brave was sent overseas for the first time to contest the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in Paris. Apart from Shardari, Shahrastani and Triptych, the field also included the German champion Acatenango and the French colt Bering, who was unbeaten in four races in 1986. Eddery restrained Dancing Brave in the early stages before switching him to the wide outside to challenge in the straight as the runners spread across the width of the course. With 200m to run he was not in the first ten, but produced an \"electrifying burst\" to take the lead 50m from the finish and won by a length and a half from Bering in a race record time of 2:27.7. On his final appearance was then sent to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita Park but failed to reproduce his best form, finishing fourth behind Manila. Dancing Brave suffered an injury in the race when he was struck in the eye by a clod of turf.\n\nAt the end of 1986, the panel of Racehorse handicappers met from the major racing nations of Europe to determine the International Classifications, the annual rating of thoroughbred racehorses who have run in Europe. Dancing Brave was awarded a rating of 141, the highest rating ever given to any horse up to that time. These are the official ratings as recognised by the organised racing bodies in Great Britain, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, Switzerland and Austria. In January 2013 the ratings were \"recalibrated\" and Dancing Brave was given a revised rating of 138, now putting him second to Frankel who was rated at 140. Dancing Brave was given a rating of 140 by Timeform. In 1999, \"The Independent\" described Dancing Brave as \"the greatest British Flat champion of the last quarter of a century\".\n\nDancing Brave was voted the official British Horse of the Year in 1986 by the Racegoers' Club. By taking all 27 votes in the poll he was the first horse to be unanimously elected since Brigadier Gerard in 1971.\n\nPat Eddery called Dancing Brave the best horse he ever rode, and a \"once in a lifetime ride\", while Khalid Abdulla described him as the outstanding horse to have carried his colours. Guy Harwood called him \"very much the best I trained\". In their book \"A Century of Champions\", John Randall and Tony Morris rated Dancing Brave as the sixth best British racehorse of the 20th century, and the sixteenth best horse of the century trained in any country.\n\nDancing Brave was syndicated with an estimated value of £14m. He retired to stand as a stallion at the Dalham Hall Stud at Newmarket with an initial stud fee of £120,000. According to Tony Morris in \"Thoroughbred Stallions (1990)\", he was known to often pass on his parrot mouth to his stock. In November 1987 he was found to be suffering from Marie's disease and had fertility problems in 1988. His modest early success led to his being exported to Japan, to stand at the Shizunai Stallion Station at Hokkaidō in 1991. He died on August 2, 1999 of a heart attack.\n\nHe sired numerous winners, having a particularly good crop of three-year-olds in 1993, foaled in the year before his export, including Commander in Chief, who won The Derby, and White Muzzle, second in both the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Other good winners included Wemyss Bight, Cherokee Rose and Ivanka. The best of his Japanese offspring was the filly T M Ocean who won the Oka Sho and the Shuka Sho in 2001.\n"}

It also contested elections as a party in its own right, electing six councillors in the 1973 local council elections in the Fermanagh and Dungannon areas, although this was reduced to two members of Fermanagh council in the next election in 1977.\n\nThe first victory came in 1969 in the Mid Ulster by-election which was won by the radical student Bernadette Devlin. She held her seat in the 1970 general election, when Fermanagh and South Tyrone was won by her colleague Frank McManus. Due to realignments in nationalist politics and opposition to Devlin's radical political and social views, both lost their seats in the February 1974 general election.\n\nIn the October 1974 general election the spirit of Unity was revived, if not the name, when Frank Maguire won Fermanagh and South Tyrone as an agreed independent Republican. He held the seat until his death in 1981. In 1978 Unity merged with the remnants of the Nationalist Party to form the Irish Independence Party.\n"}

{"id": "1867960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867960", "title": "Medicine show", "text": "Medicine show\n\nMedicine shows were touring acts (traveling by truck, horse, or wagon teams) that peddled \"miracle cure\" patent medicines and other products between various entertainments. They developed from European mountebank shows and were common in the United States in the nineteenth century, especially in the Old West (though some continued until World War II). They usually promoted \"miracle elixirs\" (sometimes referred to as snake oil), which, it was claimed, had the ability to cure disease, smooth wrinkles, remove stains, prolong life or cure any number of common ailments. Most shows had their own patent medicine (these medicines were for the most part unpatented but took the name to sound official). Entertainments often included a freak show, a flea circus, musical acts, magic tricks, jokes, or storytelling. Each show was run by a man posing as a doctor who drew the crowd with a monologue. The entertainers, such as acrobats, musclemen, magicians, dancers, ventriloquists, exotic performers, and trick shots, kept the audience engaged until the salesman sold his medicine.\n\nWhile showmen pitching miraculous cures have been around since classical times, the advent of mixed performance and medicine sales in western culture originated during the Dark Ages in Europe after circuses and theatres were banned and performers had only the marketplace or patrons for support. Mountebanks traveled through small towns and large cities, selling miraculous elixirs by offering small street shows and miraculous cures. Itinerant peddlers of dubious medicines appeared in the American colonies before 1772, when legislation prohibiting their activities was enacted. Increasingly elaborate performances were developed to appeal to a largely rural population.\n\nOver the course of the nineteenth century, traveling mountebanks gave way to more polished medicine shows, which availed themselves of a burgeoning patent medicine industry. At least 1,500 patent medicines were recorded by 1858, affording enterprising drifters a specific product to sell. These \"medicines\" seldom treated the specific symptoms of an illness, instead relying on stimulants or other drugs to produce a pleasurable effect. Alcohol, opium and cocaine were typical ingredients, and their addictive qualities provided an additional incentive for consumers to continue buying them, while their supposed medicinal benefit afforded a sufficient excuse. By 1900, the patent medicine industry was an $80 million business. Also contributing to the rise of the medicine show was the expansion of the advertising industry, through which shows were able to procure inexpensive posters, fliers, handbills, and other merchandising to promote their products. Other forms of advertising included the use of memorable jingles, sensational testimonials, and scare tactics.\n\nMedicine shows combined various forms of popular entertainment with sales pitches from a self-proclaimed \"doctor\" who sold an astounding cure-all medicine or device. Shows played either outdoors from a wagon, platform or tent, or indoors in a theatre or opera hall. Admission was usually free or nominal. Pitchmen would make grandiose claims about their product's efficacy, sometimes planting testimonials in the audience. The speaker's goal was to create a need, or fear, then offer his unique medicine as the only cure. Alternating entertainment with sales pitches wore down the audience's resistance, until the crowd was saturated with a desire for the product. The show would continue to run as many days as possible, then move on to the next town. A show might remain in a given location between one night and six weeks, depending on how the troupe behaved itself.\n\nMedicine shows often brought entertainment to rural communities that might not have any other sort of performances for years at a time. Whatever the quality of the medical advice, spectators got their money's worth from the free entertainment. Some shows followed circuits covering the entire United States, though most shows focused on the rural midwest and south, where the inhabitants were considered particularly gullible.\n\nThe two largest, most successful American medicine shows were Hamlin's Wizard Oil Company, founded in Chicago by John and Lysander Hamlin, and the Kickapoo Indian Medicine Company, founded in 1881 by Charles Bigelow and John Healey. Hamlin's Wizard Oil Company troupes travelled in specially designed wagons, with built-in organs and space for musical performers. Their appeal was clean, moral, musical entertainment for the whole family. Part of their advertising included songsters, or small booklets of song lyrics and Wizard Oil advertising. The Kickapoo Indian Medicine Company created traveling shows based around sham Indian presentational ceremonies, such as war dances and marriages. \"Representatives\" of the Kickapoo tribe translated for the Indians and sold Sagwa, the most famous patent medicine. The company also presented other forms of entertainment, such as vaudeville shows, trained dog acts, dances, and acrobatics.\n\nAs reliable commercial pharmaceuticals were produced on an industrial level in the early 20th century, the reputation of and market for home remedies began to dwindle, and medicine shows came to rely ever more on their entertainment value. But as America's population became less rural and more urbanized, the availability of other forms of entertainment, such as motion pictures, vaudeville and later radio, led to the gradual disappearance of the traveling medicine show. By the 1930s few such companies continued to tour in the United States. Even fewer shows endured the economic and social upheaval of the Great Depression and World War II. Those that survived into the 1950s found themselves competing with television and came to be regarded as relics of an earlier, more innocent era. This novelty, far more than the availability of the remedies peddled, provided the chief support for the last of the traveling medicine shows.\n\nOne of the most famous of the 20th-century traveling shows was the Hadacol Caravan, sponsored by Louisiana State Senator Dudley J. LeBlanc and his LeBlanc Corporation, makers of the dubious patent medicine/vitamin tonic Hadacol, known for both its alleged curative powers and its high alcohol content. The stage show, which ran throughout the Deep South in the 1940s with great publicity, featured a number of notable music acts and Hollywood celebrities and promoted Hadacol, which was sold during intermission and after the show. Admission to the show was paid in boxtops of the vitamin tonic, sold in stores throughout the southern United States. The Caravan came to a sudden halt in 1951, when the Hadacol enterprise fell apart in a financial scandal.\n\nOne of the last great medicine shows had its swan song in the summer of 1972, when the two-man show of Chief Thundercloud (pitchman Leo Kahdot, a Potawatomi from Oklahoma) and Peg Leg Sam (harmonicist-singer-comedian Arthur Jackson) played at a carnival in Pittsboro, North Carolina. It was the last show of the year for them; Kahdot died that winter.\n\nPerhaps the last of the medicine shows was run by Tommy Scott, who staged as many as three hundred shows per year until about 1990. As a teenager in the 1930s, Scott joined the \"\"Doc\" Chambers Medicine Show\", established by M. F. Chambers in the late nineteenth century. Scott sang, played guitar, performed ventriloquism and blackface acts, and pitched Chambers's Herb-O-Lac herbal laxative. When Chambers retired in the late 1930s, Scott took charge of the show, performing for many years with his wife, Mary, and his sidekick, Gaines Blevins, known as \"Old Bleb\". Scott's daughter, Sandra, performed in the show as a singer, bass player, and acrobat, and from the 1960s onward managed the business end of the show. Herb-O-Lac eventually gave way to a mentholated skin liniment, which Scott dubbed Snake Oil. For decades, the show toured arenas and senior centers as \"\"Doc\" Scott's Last Real Old Time Medicine Show\". From the 1960s to the 1980s, the show also solicited donations for charitable organizations such as the Lions Club and the Optimist Club.\n\nThe 1930 film \"The Medicine Man\" mixes comedy and melodrama with a medicine show coming into a small town.\n\nIn the 1932 Fleischer Studios cartoon \"Betty Boop, M.D.\", Betty, Bimbo and Koko are the owners of a traveling medicine show. They are selling \"Jippo\", an all-purpose health tonic, which appears to be water pumped from a fire hydrant, although consuming it has a number of bizarre effects.\n\nIn the 1933 Krazy Kat cartoon \"The Medicine Show\", Krazy runs a medicine show where he performs some acts and sells bottled liquids which have a variety of uses.\n\nJames Thurber's eponymous \"Doc Marlowe\" (published in \"Let Your Mind Alone!\", in 1937) is a retired snake oil salesman in a traveling show, later selling the product as \"Blackhawk Liniment\". In a typical Thurber twist, Marlowe cheats in a small way at cards and in other games of chance, but his massages with snake-oil (a harmless but expensive preparation) are in fact highly effective.\n\nIn the 1949 film \"The Inspector General\", the character played by Danny Kaye works for a medicine show, selling \"Yakov's Golden Elixir\".\n\nSeveral modern musical acts have named themselves after this old-time phenomenon, including Old Crow Medicine Show, Dr. West's Medicine Show and Junk Band, Moondog Medicine Show, Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show and MV & EE Medicine Show. The name was also used in the titles of The Dream Syndicate's album \"Medicine Show\", Big Audio Dynamite's song \"Medicine Show\", Moxy Früvous's song \"The Incredible Medicine Show\", and The Band's song \"W.S. Walcott Medicine Show\". Throughout 2010 and 2011, the hip hop artist Madlib released a 12-part mix series with the title \"Madlib Medicine Show\".\n\nScience fiction author Orson Scott Card titled his online sci-fi journal \"The Intergalactic Medicine Show\".\n\nBritish comedy trio The Goodies perform a scene as part of \"The Goodies Traveling Medicine Show\" in the episode of their TV series entitled \"Hospital For Hire\". The scene includes a planted shill (Tim Brooke-Taylor) being pulled from the audience to 'prove' that the mystery elixir cured all ailments.\n\nIn Rockstar's video game \"Red Dead Redemption\", one of the main characters plays the role of an early 20th-century hustler peddling what John Marston refers to as snake oil.\n\n\"Your Song\", by Elton John, also mentions a man who makes \"potions in a traveling show\".\n\nIn 1970 two original members of The Open Theater, Barbara Vann and James Barbosa, founded Medicine Show Theatre Ensemble also in New York. It moved around a number of times in its early years, having permanent performing spaces in 14 different locations until finally settling on West 52nd Street, where it remains today. Its work has consisted of new plays, original adaptations of classic books, reconstructions of classic musicals (especially those by Cole Porter) which were thought to have been lost, and clever adaptations of famous works, like inserting Cole Porter songs into Shakespeare plays and turning them into musical comedies.\n\nOn the 1974 album \"Everything You Know Is Wrong\" by the comedy troupe The Firesign Theatre, the recording's narrator plays a wire recording of \"Dr. Firesign's\" medicine show, in which \"Professor Archer\" promotes \"Chief Dancing Knockout's Pyramid Pushover Paste\" and \"Don Brouhaha's Inca Hell-Oil Tonic\". Archer and his assistant prepare and ingest a hallucinogenic potion with these ingredients which leads to an encounter with an Indian shaman. The entertainment consists of a play parodying \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\".\n\nThe song \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\", performed by Cher, is about a girl who was \"born in the wagon of a traveling show\". Her father would sell bottles of snake oil medicine called \"Doctor Good\".\n\nThe music video for the Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney song \"Say, Say, Say\" shows McCartney, his wife, and Jackson performing a traditional medicine show.\n\nIn the \"Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy\" episode of \"The Simpsons\", Homer and Grampa Simpson travel across country, giving medicine shows for their aphrodisiac, \"Simpson and Son's Tonic\".\n\nPerforming as medicine pitchman J. Phineas Flusterbeck, magician Mark Nilsen presents shows based on the old medicine shows. He pitches \"Blue Root Elixir\", which (according to a fabricated biography) \"restored his confidence in the gullibility of the American public\".\n\nMagician \"Pop\" Haydn models his magic shows after old-time medicine shows, complete with the selling of several products such as \"Pop Haydn's Miracle Oil\", which he claims to have received from \"Placebo Indians\".\n\nThe 1977 live-action/animated musical film \"Pete's Dragon\" features a medicine showman called Dr. Terminus (played by Jim Dale), and local townspeople being first skeptical, then duped, by his claimed healing abilities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1867989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867989", "title": "Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide", "text": "Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide\n\nThe Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide (or Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide) is an annually published comic book price guide widely considered the primary authority on the subject of American comic book grading and pricing in the hobby/industry. \nMany observers tie in the growth of the direct market distribution system and comic book specialty shops to the general acceptance of Overstreet's annual guide as a standardized inventory and pricing system.\n\nBegun in 1970 by Robert M. Overstreet as a guide for fellow fans of Golden Age and Silver Age comics, the \"Overstreet\" guide has expanded to cover virtually the entire history of the American comics publication as far back as the Victorian Age and Platinum Age. The annual edition also covers promotional comics (giveaways and advertising) and \"big little books,\" while continually updating new publications and market reports that cover the prior year of market activity.\n\nOverstreet's annual guide to the comic book collecting hobby has itself become a collectible, and since the 1980s each edition of the \"Price Guide\" includes a page listing collector's values for older editions, with hardcover editions, in particular, selling for a premium. Currently, the \"Price Guide\" is published in four formats: hardcover, softcover, a larger, ring-bound edition and an electronic edition, often with multiple covers for each version.\n\nRobert M. Overstreet grew up as a comic book, coin, and Indian arrowhead collector. In the 1960s, after abandoning a project to create an arrowhead price guide, Overstreet turned his attention to comics, which had no definitive guide.\n\nComic back-issue prices had stabilized by the end of the 1960s, and, Jerry Bails, who had recently published the \"Collector’s Guide to the First Heroic Age\", was considering creating a comic book price guide. He was contacted by Overstreet, who was doing the same thing. Bails' extensive notes, supplemented by Overstreet's study of dealer listings, \"became a backbone to the \"Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide\".\" \n\nUnder the auspices of Overstreet Publications, the first \"Comic Book Price Guide\" was published in November 1970. Priced at $5, saddle-stitched and published in a print run of 1000 (a second edition of 800 was released subsequently), the book included 218 pages of listings. Among other things, Overstreet's guide included inventory lists, and it instantly became an invaluable resource tool for comic book collectors and dealers. By 1976, the guide had achieved national distribution.\n\nAn early decision was made by author to exclude the niche of underground comix, an adult-oriented expression of the genre that Mr. Overstreet had no interest in documenting, for reasons he has never made public, despite the book being promoted by its publisher as \"the most complete listing of comics from the 1500s to the present.\"\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, Overstreet also produced publications that would serve price updates regarding newer comics releases from the present, to selected titles dating from the Silver Age, including a price guide to current and valuable comics, as well as comic book and collector news, and interviews. There was also some editorial content from the publishers, and from polled bookstore owners. Various incarnations of the publication (which were published quarterly to bi-monthly, and eventually monthly) included \"Overstreet's Comic Book Price Update\", \"Overstreet's Comics Price Bulletin\",\"Overstreet Comic Book Monthly\", and \"Overstreet's Fan\", with this last incarnation showing a great deal of similarity to the successful comics news magazine \"\". Overstreet also published twenty-one issues of \"Comic Book Marketplace\" between Mar./Apr. 1993 and January 1995. Ultimately, most titles were canceled, including \"Overstreet's Fan\" which ceased publication in 1997.\n\nOverstreet sold the business to Gemstone Publishing in 1994, and continues to serve as author of the annual guides and associated publications.\n\nIn July 2003, Gemstone attempted another monthly by publishing \"Overstreet's Comic Price Review\", which ran only for nineteen issues.\n\nThey also published 3 volumes of the Overstreet Premium Ring Price Guide featuring values of thousands of collectible toy rings of all types, the most valuable of which is the Supermen of America ring, which fetches around $100,000, depending on condition. Original art for volumes 2 and 3 by artist A. Kaviraj can be viewed at Austin's Ring Museum in Las Cruces, New Mexico.\n\nThe 49th edition (2019-2020) of the \"Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide\" went on sale July 17, 2019. The 50th edition (2020-2021) is scheduled to go on sale July 22, 2020.\n\nIn connection with the publication's 50th anniversary, Gemstone is publishing a Facsimile Edition reprint of the first edition (1970), which was originally scheduled to be released April 8, 2020 but was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. There will be three editions: softcover (retail price $16.95), hardcover ($25.00, limited to 400 copies), and a signed and numbered hardcover ($50.00, signed by Robert Overstreet and limited to 100 copies).\n\n\n"}

It contained two elements, a 1901 automobile plant in downtown Lansing, and the 1920 Durant Motors factory on Lansing's Far Westside.\n\nThe Lansing plant was the longest-operating automobile factory in the United States when it closed on May 6, 2005, and one of General Motors last assembly plants where vehicle bodies were made at one plant, and then trucked to another plant to be finished. General Motors began demolition of the plant in the spring of 2006, and demolition was completed in 2007. A new plant at nearby Lansing Grand River Assembly, which began production in 2001, as well as the Delta Township called Lansing Delta Township Assembly assumed some operations when it began production in 2006.\n\nFrom the 1940s through the 1980s, it was the main producer of full-size Oldsmobiles (88 and 98), but by the 1990s it was producing compact cars for several GM divisions.\n\nLansing Car Assembly (LCA) began in 1901 when Ransom E. Olds moved his Olds Motor Works to the city. He set up his plant on the site of the fairgrounds next to the Grand River. This plant in downtown Lansing would later be known as Lansing Car Assembly – Chassis Plant.\n\nThe plant along Verlinden Avenue, on Lansing's border with Lansing Township, opened in 1920 as a factory for Durant Motor Works. After the demise of Durant in 1931, the plant remained closed until GM purchased it in 1935. It restarted production for GM's Fisher Body division, later becoming the Buick–Oldsmobile–Cadillac factory. Its final name was Lansing Car Assembly – Body Plant.\n\nThe last cars that Lansing Car Assembly produced were the Chevrolet Malibu/Chevrolet Classic, Oldsmobile Alero, and Pontiac Grand Am, which was the final vehicle built there. The plant built the very last Oldsmobile, a 2004 Alero.\n\nLCA was regularly ranked among the most productive automobile assembly plants in North America. In 2002, it was ranked the number one most productive assembly plant in North America by The Harbour Report, the auto industry's leading measurement of plant efficiency.\n\nThe main plant was located in downtown Lansing, Michigan, located along Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard at the Grand River. It sat on the original site of the Michigan State Fairgrounds. The plant also included the unique Lansing GM Building 150 which sat in between Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard bridges.\n\nIt featured two separate assembly lines. Partially completed vehicles were transported by truck from the Body Plant to either the North Line \"M\" or the South Line \"C\" for completion. Upon completion, cars were driven off the assembly line and under northbound Martin Luther King, Jr.Boulevard bridge. After final inspection, the cars were placed in staging yards to either be shipped by truck or by rail.\n\nThe first factory on site opened in 1902 as part of Olds Motor Works, and became part of General Motors when they bought that company out in 1908. The complex was closed in 2005, finally being demolished in 2007. Harbour Consulting rated it as the sixth most efficient auto plant in North America in 2006.\n\n\n\n"}

These include Ringos, Golden Wonder and Transform-A-Snack. Since 2006, it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the Northern Irish company Tayto, after being rescued out of administration.\n\nFounded in Stockbridge in Edinburgh in 1947 by the Scottish bakery owner William Alexander, the company was named after the Golden Wonder potato. The company originally had five manufacturing sites. Four sites produced crisps, two in Scotland and two in England (Widnes and Corby). The Welsh site at Crumlin produced the \"Pot Noodle\".\n\nThe company was owned by various parent companies including Imperial Tobacco, Hanson plc, and was then acquired by United Kingdom based Dalgety plc in March 1987.\n\nIts notable brands have included: \"Wotsits\", \"Ringos\", \"Jungle Fresh\" peanuts and Pot Noodle, which ceased to carry Golden Wonder branding after the brand (but not the manufacturing business itself) was sold to Unilever. In July 1995, Best Foods paid Dalgety plc about $280 million for its Golden Wonder Pot Noodle instant hot snacks manufacturing business.\n\nIn January 2006, the company was bought by Tayto, a company based in Tandragee, County Armagh.\n\nGolden Wonder now produces a number of different flavours of potato crisp. It is also the current owner of the XL Crisp brand. Golden Wonder was the former owner of the Wotsits brand, but when the company changed hands in May 2002, it was sold off separately to their rival Walkers. Previous snacks Wheat Crunchies, Chips & Burgers and the corn based Nik Naks are now owned by KP. The company launched the cheese & onion crisp flavour in 1962. This was their first flavoured crisp, the concept having been devised by Tayto in Ireland (not the same company as that which bought Golden Wonder over in 2006) in 1953.\n\nIn the 1970s, Golden Wonder produced a line of shell-shaped crisps called Rock 'n' Roller Crisps, named after that decade's rock and roll revival. They were available in Salt & Vinegar, Cheese & Onion and Crispy Bacon flavours. During the 1980s, Golden Wonder ceased to make them. \n\nIn the 1980s, Golden Wonder claimed on television and on their packets to be \"Britain's Noisiest Crisp\". In the 1990s, a popular series of television adverts with adult actors indulging in childish antics carried another famous slogan: \"You'll never grow old in Golden Wonderland!\".\n\nIn 2009, the Golden Wonder brand started to be used by Symingtons Ltd, under licence, for the production of The Nation's Noodle and The Nation's Pasta. The new range of instant noodles is very similar to the Pot Noodle range, previously produced by Golden Wonder. Golden Wonder branding now features on snacks previously marketed by Red Mill, another snack manufacturer taken over by Tayto.\n\nGolden Wonder entered into administration on 9 January 2006, threatening about 800 jobs. On 13 January 2006, it was announced that the Corby, Northamptonshire site and the contract to Mini Pringles, as produced by Golden Wonder, would transfer to Northern Irish crisp manufacturer Tayto.\n\nThe announcement brought the news that 195 of 350 jobs would be saved initially. On 20 January 2006, it was announced that Tayto was to buy all Golden Wonder's operations in the United Kingdom including the Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire site, although it would sell the Wheat Crunchies and Nik Naks brands to United Biscuits.\n\n"}

Paid for mostly by donations and the city of Leipzig, it was completed in 1913 for the 100th anniversary of the battle at a cost of six million goldmarks.\n\nThe monument commemorates Napoleon's defeat at Leipzig, a crucial step towards the end of hostilities in the War of the Sixth Coalition. The coalition armies of Russia, Prussia, Austria and Sweden were led by Tsar Alexander I of Russia and Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. There were Germans fighting on both sides, as Napoleon's troops also included conscripted Germans from the left bank of the Rhine annexed by France, as well as troops from his German allies of the Confederation of the Rhine.\n\nThe structure is tall. It contains over 500 steps to a viewing platform at the top, from which there are views across the city and environs. The structure makes extensive use of concrete, and the facings are of granite. It is widely regarded as one of the best examples of Wilhelmine architecture. The monument is said to stand on the spot of some of the bloodiest fighting, from where Napoleon ordered the retreat of his army. It was also the scene of fighting in World War II, when Nazi forces in Leipzig made their last stand against U.S. troops.\n\nBetween 16–19 October 1813, the Battle of the Nations was fought by the coalition armies of Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Sweden against the French army of Napoleon aided by Polish and Italian troops as well as Germans from the Confederation of the Rhine and German lands west of the Rhine directly annexed into France. Napoleon's army was defeated and compelled to return to France while the Allies invaded France early the next year. Napoleon was forced to abdicate and was exiled to Elba in May 1814.\n\nIn 1814 proposals to build a monument to commemorate the battle were made. Among the supporters of the project, author Ernst Moritz Arndt called for the construction of \"a large and magnificent (monument), like a colossus, a pyramid, or the cathedral of Cologne\". Architect Friedrich Weinbrenner created a design for the monument that ultimately was not used.\n\nIn 1863, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the battle, a foundation stone was placed, but the memorial was not built. Clemens Thieme, a member of the ' (Association for the History of Leipzig) learned during a meeting of the association about the past plans to build a monument. Interested in resuming the project, Thieme, who was also a member of the Apollo masonic lodge, proposed the project during a meeting and gained the support of his fellow masons. In 1894, he founded the ' (Association of German Patriots) which raised, by means of donations and a lottery, the funds necessary to construct the monument for the 100th anniversary . The following year, the city of Leipzig donated a site for the construction. The project was commissioned to Bruno Schmitz, due to his previous works at the Kyffhäuser. The construction began in 1898. The chosen construction site was the spot where Napoleon ordered the retreat of his army. Thieme financed part of the construction as well, and for his complete dedication to the project, he was named an Honorary Citizen of Leipzig.\n\nIn 1898, the construction started. of earth was moved; 26,500 granite blocks were used and the project resulted in a total cost of 6,000,000ℳ (€ in 2020), the monument was finished in 1913. On the 18th of October 1913 the Völkerschlachtdenkmal was inaugurated in the presence of about 100 000 people including the emperor Wilhelm II, and all the reigning sovereign rulers of the German states.\n\nInspired by Weinbrenner's early project, Schmitz constructed the monument over an artificial hill, and selected a pyramidal shape for a clear view of the surroundings. The base is square. The main structure, at , is one of the tallest monuments in Europe. It is composed of two storeys. On the first story, a crypt is adorned by eight large statues of fallen warriors, each one next to smaller statues called the ' (Guardians of the Dead). On the second story, the ' (Hall of Fame) features four statues, each tall, representing the four legendary historic qualities ascribed to the German people: bravery, faith, sacrifice, and fertility. The statues of the monument were sculpted by Christian Behrens and his apprentice Franz Metzner, who finished the remaining statues after Behrens's death in 1905. Metzner worked on the sculptures at the top and inside the memorial.\n\nThe memorial is constructed in granite and sandstone. The cupola is decorated with primitive Germanic shapes, inspired by Egyptian and Assyrian sculpture. Schmitz also planned to create an accompanying complex for ceremonies that would include a court, a stadium and parade grounds. However, only a reflecting pool and two processional avenues were ultimately completed. Surrounding the monument are oaks, a symbol of masculine strength and endurance to the Germanic people of antiquity. The oaks are complemented by evergreens, symbolising feminine fecundity, and they are located in a subordinate position to the oaks. The main figure on the front of the memorial represents the archangel Michael, considered the \"War god of Germans\".\n\nThe design of the monument was intended to commemorate the spirit of the German folk. Unlike previous monuments that commemorated the achievements of the monarchy, this one was created to commemorate the end of the battle in 1813, the establishment of a German community, and the maturation of the Germans as an organised ethnic group.\n\nDuring the Third Reich, Hitler frequently used the monument as a venue for his meetings in Leipzig. During WW2, an anti-aircraft gun (Flak) position was established on top of the monument. When the US Army captured Leipzig on April 18, 1945, the monument was the last stronghold in the city to surrender. 300 soldiers, men of the Volkssturm and boys of the Hitler Youth under the command of Oberst Hans von Poncet, were holding out in the monument, but after a direct artillery hit inside the structure, von Poncet was convinced to surrender following long negotiations.\n\nDuring the period of Communist rule in East Germany from 1949 to 1989, the government of the GDR was unsure whether it should allow the monument to stand, since it was considered to represent the steadfast nationalism of the period of the German Empire. Eventually, it was decided that the monument be allowed to remain, since it represented a battle in which Russian and German soldiers had fought together against a common enemy, and was therefore representative of \" (Russo-German brotherhood-in-arms) (although some Germans fought on the other side in the battle).\n\nIn 1956, the opening ceremony of the Gymnastics and Sports Festival took place in the memorial complex; the authorities stated that the monument could be interpreted as a symbol of \"long-standing German-Russian friendship\". The festival planners focused the spirit of the celebrations on German history, and the ceremony as a symbol of the desired German union.\n\nRestoration of the monument started in 2003, and is expected to be completed in 2019. The Monument of the Battle of Nations is located in the southeast of Leipzig and can be reached by tram lines 15 and 2 at \"Völkerschlachtdenkmal\".\n\n\n\n"}

Shares of stock in the company were sold for $20; annual dues were $2.\n\nIn 1827, the Law Library Company merged with the Associated Members of the Bar and became known as the Law Association of Philadelphia.

{"id": "1868016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868016", "title": "Alaunt", "text": "Alaunt\n\nThe Alaunt was an extinct breed of dog, with the original breed having existed in North Caucasus, Central Asia and Europe from ancient times until the 17th century. \n\nThis breed developed by the Alans was well renowned primarily for its quality as a large-game catch dog, and as a war dog and guard dog. \n\nIn France, the Alaunt breed had three distinct types: the Alaunt Veantre, Alaunt Boucherie and Alaunt Gentile. They all were large, short-coated dogs of varying head-types. The former two resembled the molosser-type dogs much like the present-day Dogo Argentino or like the Caucasian Shepherd Dog except with short hair and a mesocephalic head which made them excellent large-game hunters. The Alaunt was originally bred by the Alani tribes, the nomads of Indo-European Sarmatian ancestry who spoke an Iranian language. The Alans were known as superb warriors, herdsmen, and breeders of horses and dogs. The Alans bred their dogs for work and developed different strains within the breed for specific duties. The breed was further developed in Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, England, and in Italy.\n\nThe Molossus belonged to the tribe of the Illyrians, who invaded Epirus In northern Greece in about 1200 BC, coming from the north. However, their artifacts did not resemble the Mastiff prototype, as they had a long nose of a narrow type, and a long mane. Varro, however, described a herding dog of Epirus which was white, large-headed, and slightly undershot, used to defend sheep and goats. One group of Alans arrived in what is now Albania in the 5th or 6th centuries BC. Molossis of Epirus is located in Southern Albania. It is most plausible the Alaunt gave rise to the fighting dogs of the Molossi, which were introduced to Britain by Roman invasion in 43 BC. The Alans provided cavalry for Rome, many of whom were deployed to Hadrian's Wall in the Second Century AD. Thus, the Alaunt genetic template most plausibly gave rise to the British Pugnaces as fighting dogs which English Mastiffs and Bulldogs descend from.\n\nIn the AD 370s, Hun invasions divided the Alani into the Eastern and Western Alans. The Eastern Alani tribes merged with the Ossetians and other nations, introducing their dogs into the bloodlines of many Balkan breeds, such as the Šarplaninac, Metchkar, Qen Ghedje, Hellenikos Poimenikos and other Molossers of the region. The white-coloured Alaunts may be the direct ancestors of the Balkan breeds, which in turn influenced all other white dogs in the Balkans. \nThe Western Alans joined the Vandals on their raids through Europe and by the AD 410s, their fierce dogs were influencing many breeds in France, Spain, Portugal, England and other countries, spreading the use of the \"Alaunt\" name, which became synonymous with a type of a working dog, rather than a specific breed. Through breeding with various scenthounds and sighthounds, some Alaunts became valued large game hunting dogs, existing in a variety of types, dictated by regional preferences. In AD 1500, Spain was known for breeding the best Alaunts and used them to conquer the New World. \n\nIn France, Alaunts were separated into three main categories, based on physical appearance and the duties they performed. The lightest type was the Alaunt Gentil, a greyhound-like dog, which eventually became assimilated into the local hunting breeds with the Alaunt Veantre. The original mastiff variety, known as the Alaunt de Boucherie, was crucial in the development of the fighting and baiting dogs of France. The Alaunt de Boucherie in France was known as the Alaunt Butchers in England and the Alano in Spain and Italy and were termed the original Bulldogs as they were used to control and defend herds of cattle. In Spain, the three categories were the Mastins, Alanos, and Lebrels, further separated as the \"ayuda\" (defense types) and the \"presa\" (offense types), such as the Perro de presa español.\n\nThe long, broad, flat head of the Alaunt should never be confused with the modified brachycephalic breeds. The brachycephalic head type is wide in base, but short in length. While the preferred bite is reverse scissor, like the Mastiff, and may have been a trait introduced by the Mongolian breeds at some remote time in history, skull type and bite type are separate subjects of genetic traits. The dolichocephalic skull is narrow at base yet long in length, so the Alaunt could be referred to as a modified dolichocephalic breed, as mesocephalic is a balance of base to length. Moreover, the Alaunt or Mastiff must be separated from the Molossoides in head study, as this term does not separate the Mastiff from the mountain dogs or even the Pug.\n\nContemporary enthusiasts are developing new breeds based on Alaunt bloodlines, such as the British Alaunt, New Alaunt, Antebellum Bulldog or Altamaha Plantation Dog, Dogo Belgrado, Abraxas bulldog, bully kutta, gull dong and the American Alaunt. While its origins are strongly rooted in the ancient mountain dogs of the East, the Alaunt is regarded by some cynologists as the ancestor to the original bulldog breeds.\n\n\n"}

After taking part in different locations around Lisbon, like the FIL Park, Ajuda or Loures, it is now carried out in Amora, a town near Seixal in a ground bought by the Party after a massive fundraising campaign in the early 90s. The campaign was considered by the Party as the only way to avoid the boycott organised by the owners of the previous festivals grounds, that culminated in 1987 with the festival not being carried out after 11 editions. The festival is usually visited and participated in by hundreds of thousands of people, making the outside of the ground seem a gigantic camping park. The party itself consists of a three-day festival of music, with the participation of hundreds of Portuguese and international bands and artists in five different stages, ethnography, gastronomy, debates, a book & music fair, theatre (\"Avanteatro\"), cinema (\"Cineavante\") and sporting events. Several foreign communist parties also participate.\n\nIn 28 editions, the Festival counted with the presence of several famous artists, either Portuguese or foreign, like Chico Buarque, Baden Powell, Ivan Lins, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Holly Near, Johnny Clegg, Charlie Haden, Judy Collins, Richie Havens, Tom Paxton, The Soviet Circus Company, the Kuban Cossacks Choir, Dexys Midnight Runners, The Band, Hevia, Adriano Correia de Oliveira, Carlos Paredes, Jorge Palma, Manoel de Oliveira and many others.\n\nThe preparation of the party begins right after the end of the previous party.

It was founded in 1982 by members of the Communist Workers Union of Germany (; KABD).\n\nThe MLPD advocates for the establishment of a dictatorship of the proletariat, overthrowing current capitalist relations of production and replacing them with a new social order of socialist orientation. It sees this as a transitional stage to the creation of a classless, communist society. In doing so, it refers to the theory and practice of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong. It rejects the terms \"Stalinism\" and \"Maoism\" as anti-communist fighting terms that divide the Marxist–Leninist movement. Whilst criticizing particular aspects of the political works of Stalin and Mao, MLPD openly defends those works, standing in contrast to most left-wing groups in Germany.\n\nIt participates in the International Conference of Marxist–Leninist Parties and Organizations (ICMLPO) and the International Coordination of Revolutionary Parties and Organizations (ICOR). Representatives from the party have attended congresses of other communist parties around the world.\n\nThe MLPD's youth movement is called \"REBELL\" (Rebel).\n\nThe MLPD has traditionally claimed to promote Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Only part of the MLPD's membership originates from the 1960s students' movement. Willi Dickhut, the party's founder, had been expelled from the Communist Party of Germany in 1966 for criticizing the change of social conditions in the Soviet Union. His book on the \"restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union\" was published in 1971 and is a fundamental part of the MLPD's ideology. The MLPD describes the political and economic changes in most of the Eastern European countries after the 20th Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as treason to socialism. From 1976, when the economic changes provided by Deng Xiaoping were taking place, the MLPD's predecessor organizations criticized those changes as China's restoration of capitalism.\n\nIn the 1998 federal elections, the party gained only 0.01 percent of the votes. In 2002, the MLPD did not participate in the federal elections and called on people to boycott. The MLPD participated in the 2005 federal elections, generally positioning itself in campaigns as a radical alternative to the Left Party. The MLPD won 0.1 percent of the total votes cast. This marked a tenfold increase compared to the result of 1998, despite the competition with the Left Party. Its strongest showing was in the states of Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia, where it garnered 0.4 percent of the vote. MLPD also participated in 2009 federal elections and has announced its participation in the 2013 federal elections.\n\nStill some trade unions in Germany have a policy of expelling members of the MLPD. An example of this is when the former chairman of the party, Stefan Engel, was forced to leave the IG Metall and became a member of Ver.di, which does not take a stance against the MLPD.\n\nFor the 2017 federal election the MLPD formed the \"Internationalistischen Bündnis\" (Internationalist Alliance) coalition. The coalition is made up of different local electoral groups, migrant organizations (such as ATIF, ADHK and the German section of the Communist party of Iran) and labor union groups. \n\nAlthough the party has seen little success in national or state elections, the party has managed to gain a number of local councils seats. However these party are contested under a different local label and not with a explicit communist program. However these parties are all members of the MLPD-led electoral coalition Internationalist Alliance. \n\n"}

{"id": "1868035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868035", "title": "J. R. Richard", "text": "J. R. Richard\n\nJames Rodney Richard (born March 7, 1950) is an American former starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played his entire career, from 1971 to 1980, with the Houston Astros.\n\nAfter leaving high school, Richard was selected by the Astros as the second overall pick in the first round of the 1969 amateur draft. From the time he made his major league debut with the Astros in 1971 until 1975, Richard had a limited role as an Astros pitcher, throwing no more than 72 innings in a season. In 1975, Richard played his first full season in the majors as a starting pitcher.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1980, he was one of the premier pitchers in the majors, leading the National League twice in strikeouts, once in earned run average, and three times in hits allowed per nine innings, winning at least 18 games a year between 1976 and 1979. On July 30, 1980, Richard suffered a stroke and collapsed while playing a game of catch before an Astros game, and was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery to remove a life-threatening blood clot in his neck. His condition brought a sudden end to his major league career at the age of 30. His 313 strikeouts in 1979 remained an Astros franchise record until Gerrit Cole surpassed it on September 24, 2019, and he held the team's record for career strikeouts (1,493) until 1987. Two-time National League MVPs Johnny Bench and Dale Murphy both named Richard as the toughest pitcher they ever faced.\n\nIn 1981, Richard attempted a comeback with the Astros, but this failed because the stroke had slowed down his reaction time and weakened his depth perception. He spent the next few seasons in the minor leagues before being released by the Astros in 1984. After his professional baseball career ended, Richard became involved in unsuccessful business deals and went through two divorces, which led to him being homeless and destitute in 1994. Richard found succor in a local church and later became a Christian minister.\n\nRichard was born to Clayton and Lizzie (\"née\" Frost) Richard in Vienna, Louisiana and gained prominence in both baseball and basketball at historically black and since closed Lincoln High School in nearby Ruston. By the time he was a high school senior, Richard stood tall and weighed . That year, he was one of the starting pitchers for Lincoln High School and did not concede a run for the entire season. In one game Richard hit four consecutive home runs while pitching his team to a 48–0 victory against its local rival, Jonesboro's Jackson High School. Richard, whose baseball idol was St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Bob Gibson, never lost a game he started in his high school career.\n\nUpon graduating from high school, he turned down more than 200 basketball scholarship offers to sign with the Houston Astros. The Astros would later select him with the second overall pick in the 1969 amateur baseball draft, behind the Washington Senators' selection of outfielder Jeff Burroughs. Richard later recalled, \"There were other guys in my high school with as much ability as I had, but instead of working at a job, they wanted to drink wine on Saturday nights. They thought that was the in thing to do, and consequently our lives went in different directions. For some people it takes that to make a world. It does not for me.\"\n\nAfter the Astros drafted Richard, they sent him to play for the Covington Astros, a rookie-level minor league baseball team in the Appalachian League. Richard started 12 games for Covington, finishing with five wins and four losses. Despite accumulating an average of 11.41 strikeouts per nine innings, Richard had trouble throughout the season with his pitching mechanics and control. In 56 innings, Richard struck out 71 batters but walked 52 and gave up 41 earned runs, resulting in a 6.59 earned run average.\n\nThe following year, at 20 years of age, Richard was promoted to the Cocoa Astros of the Florida State League in high-A minor league baseball. Richard again compiled a low hits per nine innings (H/9IP) ratio by giving up only 67 hits in 109 total innings pitched. Despite his 4–11 win–loss record, Richard finished the season with a 2.39 ERA and even threw a no-hitter against the Daytona Beach Dodgers. During the season, Richard was able to throw an accurate fastball which occasionally exceeded 100 miles per hour, and his slider 93 miles per hour, faster than those of most major-league pitchers. During the 1970–71 off-season, the Astros again promoted Richard: this time to Class-AAA baseball, one step below the major leagues, with the Oklahoma City 89ers of the now-defunct American Association. Richard wore number 50 and kept that number for the rest of his minor-league and major-league career. Richard started all but one of the games he pitched that season. He pitched eight complete games and led the league with 202 strikeouts in 173 innings of work. He ended the season with twelve wins and seven losses before being called up by the Houston Astros.\n\nRichard entered Major League Baseball with the Astros in 1971 as a September call-up. On September 5, Richard made his major league debut at just 21 years of age, in the second game of a doubleheader against the San Francisco Giants. Richard used his fastball–slider combination to pick up the win and tied Karl Spooner's 17-year-old major league record for striking out 15 batters in his first major league start. Richard was charged with two earned runs and seven hits in the 5–3 Astros win but struck out Willie Mays and Dick Dietz three times.\n\nRichard made his next start, after five days rest, against the Cincinnati Reds, who would later finish the NL West season in a tie for fourth place with the Astros. Richard gave up a lead-off home run to Pete Rose in the first inning and pitched five innings of the two-hit, one-run game. He struck out five batters but walked six. Richard struggled in his two following starts. In a September 16 match-up against the Astros' division rival, the third-place Atlanta Braves, Richard pitched seven innings and surrendered four runs on seven hits. He struck out nine batters and even struck out the side in the first inning but also walked four batters. Furthermore, he threw two wild pitches in the first and fifth innings. In his final game of the season, against the Giants, Richard was replaced in the first inning after pitching to only four batters.\n\nDuring the next few seasons, Richard split time between the minors and majors and did not become a regular starter with the Astros until 1975. After his \"cup of coffee\" with the Astros in 1971, Richard was sent back down to Class-AAA baseball to work on his pitching with the Oklahoma City 89ers for the 1972 season. He started 19 games with the 89ers before being called back up to the Astros. In Triple-A baseball in the American Association, Richard finished with 10 wins and eight losses in 128 innings of work. His 3.02 ERA was slightly higher than that of the previous season, but he maintained approximately the same walks per nine innings ratio (BB/9IP) that he had the previous year. He recorded six complete games and finished with 169 strikeouts, for a ratio of 11.88 strikeouts per 9 innings. Richard re-entered the majors, starting a day game of a day-night doubleheader for the Astros against the San Diego Padres on July 30, 1972. He struggled and took the 10–7 loss. Richard did not pitch again until two weeks later, when he entered in relief for Ken Forsch in the fifth inning to keep the Giants limited to a one-run lead. In two innings of relief, Richard gave up one hit, struck out three batters and garnered the win. In his two final relief appearances of the season, Richard gave up five earned runs in just over one inning of work. He finished the season with a 13.50 ERA in only six innings of work and was again sent back down to Triple-A, this time with the Astros-affiliated Denver Bears.\n\nRichard started eight games with the Bears in 1973 and posted minor league career-worsts in ERA and hits allowed per nine innings. Despite his poor performance with the Bears, Richard was again called up by the Astros. Richard entered in the fourth inning of a June 16 game against the St. Louis Cardinals and his idol Bob Gibson. He pitched four innings of one-run ball and three innings of a two-hit game in his next relief outing. Afterwards, the Astros placed Richard in the starting rotation, and he made his first major league start since July 30 of the previous year. He pitched six solid innings of a one-run ballgame and struck out six while walking three batters. Richard would make his next start four days later. Richard again pitched more than six innings but earned no decision after the Astros' bullpen gave up nine runs during the top of the ninth inning.\n\nAfter starting a July 4 game against the Braves (which he won), Richard was sent into the bullpen to add Tom Griffin into the Astros' starting rotation. He made three relief appearances against the Montreal Expos before making a start against the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 27. Four days later, Richard threw his first shutout against the Dodgers, in which he gave up just five hits and struck out nine batters. Nineteen days later, Richard pitched another complete game, this time giving up two runs while striking out nine and walking three batters. He concluded the season with six wins and two losses in 16 total games, 10 of which he started. He finished with a 4.00 ERA, and struck out 75 batters in 72 innings. He walked 38 batters, giving him a ratio of 4.75 walks per nine innings, which was lower than the ratio he had had in his two previous minor league seasons.\n\nDespite his improved performance in the 1973 season, Richard was sent down to work on his pitching mechanics and ball control in Class-AA baseball with the Columbus Astros of the Southern League. He started 13 games with Columbus before being moved back up to Class-AAA with the Denver Bears. In four starts with the Bears, Richard threw three shutouts and pitched 33 scoreless innings with a 4–0 record and 26 strikeouts. He was called back into the majors on July 13 and stayed with the Astros for the remainder of the season. He first pitched 14 innings of baseball in six relief appearances before being placed on the starting rotation. He then started in all nine of the games he pitched during the remainder of the season. Richard finished with a 4.18 ERA in just over 64 innings of work during the 15 pitching appearances he made during the season.\n\nEven though Richard's statistics showed he bounced between Houston and the minors during his first four years with the Astros due to his wildness, he often told reporters that racism played a role in keeping him from becoming a regular with the big club sooner.\n\nIn the off-season, the Astros traded starting pitcher Claude Osteen to the Cardinals, and lost pitching ace Don Wilson, who died from carbon monoxide poisoning at the age of 29 on January 5, 1975. As a result, Richard entered the 1975 season as the third starter of the Astros' pitching rotation, behind veterans Larry Dierker and Dave Roberts. Richard was scheduled to start on April 9 versus the Braves. He was removed from the game in the fifth inning after jamming his toe on the first base bag but gave up no earned runs in his start. Richard continued to exhibit wildness, as shown when he issued eight walks in both his third and fourth starts of the season. He followed by pitching a complete game win against the San Diego Padres on April 29. The following start, he walked a career-high 11 batters in just six innings of pitching and also gave up seven runs in the Astros' 12–8 win over the Giants. By the All-Star break, Richard had six wins and four losses with a 4.93 ERA in just over 98 innings of work.\n\nIn an August 10 game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Richard yielded just one hit in six innings but walked 10 batters. He rebounded with a complete game shutout against the New York Mets eight days later. Richard ended the season on a strong note by winning three of his last four starts, including his final two games against the Dodgers. He finished the year with a 12–10 record for the Astros, who finished with a franchise-worst 64–97 record. Richard was the only starter on the Astros' pitching staff who had a winning record for the season. He led the team with 176 strikeouts, which was also the fifth-highest in the National League. Richard also led the league in walks allowed and wild pitches thrown, with 138 and 20, respectively.\n\nRichard entered the 1976 season as the pitching staff ace and took over Larry Dierker's position as the Opening Day starter for the Astros. In his first start of the season, Richard gave up four runs in four innings against the defending World Series champion Cincinnati Reds on April 8. He followed this inauspicious beginning with wins in five of his next six decisions. One of them included a 10-inning shutout effort that led to a 16-inning 1–0 Astros victory against the Dodgers. By the end of May, however, Richard was sitting even with a 5–5 record, loser of four straight decisions. He closed the first half of the season by winning a 10-inning shutout against the Mets on July 6, and an eight-inning start against the Expos four days later. At the All-Star break, Richard had a 9–9 record with a 2.88 ERA in over 153 innings of work.\nFrom July 10 to August 31, Richard racked up eight complete games, including one shutout, and he improved his record from 9–9 to 16–13. He pitched 98 innings and yielded only 22 earned runs, which gave him an ERA of 2.02 during the approximately 50-day span. On August 26, Richard hit his first home run of the season during the second inning of the game. In his last game of the season on October 2, Richard pitched a complete game 13-strikeout performance, and he also hit a two-run home run in the sixth inning.\n\nRichard finished the season with a 20–15 record, 14 complete games, three shutouts, and 214 strikeouts in 291 innings of work. At age 26, Richard became only the second pitcher in Astros' history (after Dierker in 1969) to record 20 wins in a season, tying him for fourth in the NL that year. Richard also became the ninth member of the Black Aces, an organization founded by Mudcat Grant that consists of all African American pitchers who have won at least 20 major league games in a season. He was named the Most Valuable Player of the Astros by the Houston chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Richard finished 17th in MVP Award voting and seventh in the NL's Cy Young Award voting. His 2.75 ERA was the seventh-best among the league's starting pitchers, and he held hitters to a 0.212 batting average. He led the league in lowest number of hits allowed per nine innings and in walks allowed; Richard also finished the season second in batters faced, innings pitched and games started. In addition, he led all NL pitchers with 14 hits, two home runs, and nine runs batted in as a hitter. However, during the year he committed ten errors and finished with an 0.853 fielding percentage, nearly 0.100 lower than the league average.\n\nRichard began the 1977 season on a high note with a nine-inning, seven-strikeout performance on April 8 against the Braves. He pitched seven complete game victories in the first half of the season. By the All-Star break, Richard had nine wins and six losses in over 160 innings of work, accompanied by 119 strikeouts and a 2.69 ERA. Although Richard struggled through July and early August, he did manage to pitch three complete games (including two shutouts) in five starts from August 27 to September 17. He had 11 and 10 strikeouts respectively in the final two starts of that roughly 20-day span.\n\nRichard closed out the season with two complete games, the first against the Braves on September 27, and the second against the Dodgers on October 2. He had a season-high 14 strikeouts in his final start, which tied Steve Carlton's season-high mark. Richard concluded the season on a high note by winning nine of his last twelve decisions. At the end of the season, he led the Astros' pitching staff in wins, starts, complete games, innings pitched, walks and strikeouts. He had 18 wins and 12 losses in 267 innings pitched and posted a 2.97 ERA and 214 strikeouts. For the first time since becoming a permanent member of the Astros' starting rotation, Richard was not the league leader in walks allowed, but as he had done in 1976, he led the league in wild pitches. He finished fourth in the league with 13 complete games, and he improved his fielding from the previous season by going through an error-free season.\n\nRichard hit well for a pitcher, going 20-for-87 in the season with two triples, two home runs and seven runs batted in. After the season was completed, Richard underwent an emergency appendicectomy on October 26, 1977 at a Houston hospital. He spent most of the off-season working out at the Houston Astrodome and, for relaxation, fishing. In early 1978, he was a participant in ABC's Superstars all-around sports competition.\n\nRichard entered the 1978 season as the Astros' Opening Day starter. In the first game of the season, he gave up seven runs on 11 hits and just made it into the fifth inning before being replaced in a loss to the Cincinnati Reds. He recovered from the loss by pitching a complete game two-hit shutout in his next outing against the Dodgers. In an eight-start period from April 26 to June 4, Richard threw six complete games, including two back-to-back shutouts, and lowered his ERA from 4.15 to 3.05. He struck out 67 and gave up only 39 hits in the 63 total innings he pitched. On a June 9 start against the Cardinals, Richard struck out 12 batters but also walked six and gave up five earned runs. By the end of the first half of the season Richard had pitched back-to-back games with nine and 12 strikeout performances, against the Reds and Dodgers, respectively. At the All-Star break, he had an 8–9 record with a 3.49 ERA but also had 157 strikeouts in 139 innings of work.\n\nAfter the break, Richard threw an 11-inning, 10-strikeout game against the Expos and followed with two complete games and another nine-inning performance in a game that went into extra innings. He was selected as the National League Pitcher of the Month after going a perfect 4–0 with a 1.29 ERA and 58 strikeouts in 56 innings during July. Throughout much of August, his season ERA hovered below 3.00, and he averaged well over a strikeout per inning. On August 21, in an 8–3 victory over the Chicago Cubs, he broke Don Wilson's 1969 club record of 235 strikeouts. In the final two months of the season, Richard's strikeout average dramatically increased, and he struck out a double-digit number of batters in three of his last five starts. In his third-to-last start, Richard broke Tom Seaver's NL record of 290 strikeouts by a right-hander when he struck out Bob Horner. In his final outing of the season, Richard reached the 300-strikeout pinnacle by striking out Rowland Office in a September 28 victory over the Braves. He also hit his seventh career home run, making him the Astros' career leader in home runs by a pitcher. At that time, he became only the tenth pitcher, third National Leaguer and first NL right-hander in history to strike out more than 300 batters in a single season.\n\nRichard finished the season with 18 wins, 11 losses and a 3.11 ERA. He led the team's pitching staff in innings pitched, starts, complete games, shutouts, hits allowed, earned runs, walks allowed and strikeouts. He held batters to a .156 batting average at home and a .196 average overall, which was the lowest in the NL. Richard again fared well in the field, finishing with three errors and a 0.957 fielding percentage, slightly higher than the 0.950 league average. He finished fourth in the Cy Young Award voting, behind Gaylord Perry, Burt Hooton and Vida Blue. He finished atop the league in strikeouts per nine innings (9.90), fewest hits allowed per nine innings (6.28), walks (141), and wild pitches (16).\n\nIn his second game of the 1979 season, Richard set the modern-day record for throwing six wild pitches in a single game against the Dodgers. Despite this, he finished the game with a 13-strikeout performance in a 2–1 Astros victory. He won his first four decisions that season but those victories were followed by four losses. He continued to accumulate strikeouts and finally began to walk fewer batters on average, exhibiting greater control over his pitching. Richard evened out his record at seven wins and seven losses by pitching a complete game three-hit shutout against the Padres on June 30. By the All-Star break, Richard had 7 wins, 10 losses, a 3.52 earned run average and 158 strikeouts in just a bit over 157 innings of work. By July 25, his record stood at eight wins and 11 losses, but after he pitched nine straight complete games (including two-hit and three-hit shutouts on August 27 and September 6, respectively) through September 6 and worked 86 consecutive innings without the need of a relief pitcher, which set an Astros club record, it was clear that he was on a winning streak. On September 21, in a game against the Reds, he pitched 11 innings and matched a career high of 15 strikeouts, which he also reached earlier in the season on August 3 in a game against the Braves. He closed out the season against the Dodgers by winning his 11th straight game against the team, with his last loss coming on June 23, 1976. He was honored as the National League Pitcher of the Month for September after going 4–1 with a 1.24 ERA, four complete games, two shutouts and 69 strikeouts in 53 innings pitched during the stretch.\n\nHe finished the season with 18–13 record and a league-best 2.71 ERA. He struck out 10 or more batters 14 times in the season, and totaled a league-leading 313 strikeouts for the season, breaking his own club record. Richard joined Nolan Ryan and Sandy Koufax as the only modern-day pitchers to strike out over 300 batters in consecutive seasons. He led the club in ERA, complete games and innings pitched and tied Joe Niekro in number of games started. He gave up 220 hits in the season, which gave him a league-best 6.77 hits per nine innings ratio. He again led the league by limiting the opposing hitters' batting averages to .209 that year. Richard finished fifth in the league in walks allowed, with his first sub-100 total since he became a mainstay starter with the Astros. He also led the league with a 9.64 strikeouts per nine innings ratio. Richard finished 19th in National League MVP Award voting and third in Cy Young Award voting, behind winner Bruce Sutter and teammate Joe Niekro, who had 21 wins and a 3.00 ERA that season. Richard fared slightly worse in batting and fielding, finishing with a .126 batting average and a .902 fielding percentage and five errors. On October 11, Richard signed a four-year contract with the Astros.\n\nBy now Richard was among the best pitchers in baseball. When asked in 2012 who was the \"toughest pitcher to get a hit off of\" during his career, Dale Murphy answered \"Anybody that played in the late 70's or early 80's will probably give you the same answer: JR Richard\". In 1980, Richard was now teamed with seven-time American League strikeout champion Nolan Ryan, who had joined the Astros as a free agent. During the first half of the season, Richard was virtually unhittable, starting the year with five straight wins, 48 strikeouts (including two starts with 12 and 13 strikeouts), and a sub-2.00 ERA. He was named National League Pitcher of the Month for April. At one point, Richard threw three straight complete-game shutouts, two against the Giants and one against the Cubs. On July 3, he broke Dierker's team record of 1487 career strikeouts in a 5–3 win over the Braves; it was to be Richard's last major league victory. After finishing the first half of the season with a 10–4 record, 115 strikeouts and a 1.96 ERA, Richard was selected to be the National League's starting pitcher in the All-Star Game on July 8, but he pitched just two innings due to various back and shoulder problems. As the season progressed, Richard began to complain of a \"dead arm\", citing discomfort in his shoulder and forearm. His concerns fell on deaf ears. Some in the media even interpreted these complaints as whining or malingering, citing Richard's reputation for moodiness. Others hypothesized that Richard was egotistical and could not handle the pressure of pitching for the Astros, while others suggested he was jealous of Ryan's $4.5 million contract.\n\nDuring his next start on July 14 against the Braves, Richard was pitching well and even struck out the side in the second inning, but had trouble seeing catcher Alan Ashby's signs and also had difficulty moving his arm. He left the game in the fourth inning after throwing a fastball and feeling his right arm go \"dead\". He had numbness in the fingers of his right hand and could not grasp a baseball. The Astros placed Richard on the 21-day disabled list. As it turned out, it would be his last major league game.\n\nNine days later, he checked into Methodist Hospital in Houston for a series of physical and psychological tests to determine the cause of his mysterious arm problems. An angiogram revealed an obstruction in the distal subclavian and axillary arteries of the right arm. Richard's blood pressure in his left arm was normal but pressure was nearly absent in his right arm due to the completely obstructed artery. On July 25, however, the arteries in his neck were studied, and the doctors reached a conclusion that all was normal and no surgical treatment needed to be performed.\n\nOn July 30, Richard went to see a chiropractor who rotated his neck to fix the flow of blood in his upper torso region. Later that day, Richard was participating in warm-ups before the game when he suffered a major stroke and collapsed in the outfield. Before the stroke, he had a headache and a feeling of weakness through his body. Eventually, that progressed into vision problems and paralysis in the left side of his body. A massive blockage in his right carotid artery necessitated emergency surgery that evening. An examination by neurologist William S. Fields showed that Richard was still experiencing weakness in his extremities and on the left side of his face. He also had blurred vision through his left eye. A CAT scan of Richard's brain later showed that Richard had experienced three separate strokes from the different obstructions in his arterial system. Furthermore, the arteries in his right arm were still obstructed. Later examinations showed that Richard was suffering from extensive arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. While pitching, his clavicle and first rib pinched his subclavian artery. As a result of this problem, Richard would feel normal for the first few innings of the game but after putting repeated pressure on his subclavian artery, his arm would start to ache in pain and eventually start to feel \"heavy\". His wife at the time, Carolyn, told reporters, \"It took death, or nearly death, to get an apology. They should have believed him.\"\n\nRichard underwent rehabilitation and missed the rest of the season. Meanwhile, the Astros recovered from the loss of one of their staff aces and qualified for the playoffs for the first time in the club's 18-year history.\n\nIn 1981, Richard underwent a rehabilitation program with the aim of recovering from the effects of the stroke. He trained with the Astros and the Texas Southern University team, participating regularly in pitching and batting practice with both towards the end of the baseball season. After pitching in a few simulated games, Richard was placed on the 40-man active roster on September 1, 1981. Astros manager Bill Virdon thought Richard was not ready to return, so Richard did not pitch with the team during the last two months of the season.\n\nThe following year, Richard pitched in a single spring training game and then went into extended spring training in Sarasota, Florida, during the first two months of the season. There he registered three wins and two losses and a 3.38 ERA in seven starts with 32 total innings. Afterwards, he joined the major league rehabilitation program with the Daytona Beach Astros of the Florida State League. In his six starts, Richard notched three wins, two complete games and posted a 2.79 ERA. He was then promoted to Triple-A baseball with the Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League. He struggled to control the ball, conceding a high number of runs to opposing teams. He took a loss on August 12 against the Phoenix Giants and on August 27 against the Salt Lake City Gulls in a 13–0 rout. His longest outing as a starter—more than five innings—was an appearance against the Giants in the last game of the season on September 1. He then joined the Astros' extended roster but did not play in any games.\n\nIn 1983, Richard started to complain of pain in his left calf. The synthetic graft inserted in his July 1980 surgery had closed off, which meant that he needed a surgical bypass in his left leg. Richard was granted free agency by the Astros on November 7, 1983, but the Astros still had faith in him, so he was re-signed on February 17 of the following year. Just a little over two months later, he was released by the Astros, thus ending his baseball career. Despite an almost complete recovery, the risk of future complications was so great that he never pitched again. His final major league record was 107–71, with 1,493 strikeouts and a 3.15 ERA in 238 games and 1,606 innings. Nolan Ryan broke his Astros record for career strikeouts in 1987.\n\n\nSource:\n\nAfter his professional baseball career ended, Richard returned to Louisiana and invested in some business ventures. He fell prey to an oil business scam, losing over $300,000 in the deal. A few years later, Richard paid $669,000 in a divorce settlement to ex-wife Carolyn. He married and divorced again, losing his suburban Houston home and most of his money. In 1989, Richard was drafted into the Senior Professional Baseball Association and played for the Orlando Juice but was cut from the team in preseason play. By the winter of 1994, Richard was homeless and destitute and lived under a highway overpass in Houston.\n\nBy 1995, Richard was eligible for his pension from Major League Baseball. He played in the Old-Timers' Day game with the Astros in the same year. In the following months, after spending many nights under the overpass Highway 59 at Beechnut Road in Houston, he turned to the Now Testament Church and sought help from its minister, Reverend Floyd Lewis. Richard overcame his homelessness by working with this minister, with a belief that he \"always knew God was on his side\". Richard started working at an asphalt company and later returned to the church as a minister.\n\nRichard became involved in the Houston community, working with local financial donors to help establish baseball programs for children. A small-budget 2005 movie, \"Resurrection: The J. R. Richard Story\", depicted Richard's baseball career as well as his life after baseball. Along with former major leaguers Dick Allen, Jim Grant, Kenny Lofton, and Eddie Murray, Richard was honored by the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum as a 2018 member of the \"Hall of Game.\" Richard was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals in 2019.\n\n\n"}

His mother died and his father traveled to New Jersey where he left the young child to be raised by a foster mother, Sophie Heinz in Newark. He enlisted in the Marine Corps on July 16, 1903, and, over the next four years, served twice in the Philippines, from September 26, 1903, to August 28, 1905, and from September 29, 1906, to January 13, 1907, and did one tour of duty in China in the intervening period. Private Stockham was honorably discharged at New York City on July 15, 1907. He moved to Belleville, New Jersey and served as a fireman in the area. Five years later, on May 31, 1912, he reenlisted in the Marine Corps.\n\nBy the time he was again discharged, on May 30, 1916, he had risen to the rank of sergeant and had served most of his term ashore in Nicaragua. Sgt. Stockham saw combat during the engagement at León, Nicaragua, on October 6, 1915, a little over a month before his departure from that troubled Latin American nation. He was honorably discharged again on May 30, 1916, this time at Mare Island, Calif. However, within a week, he had returned to New York City, where on June 7, he reenlisted.\n\nBy February 8, 1918, Sgt. Stockham was in France and heading for the trenches. Between that time and his death, he served in the Toulon sector, in the Aisne operation, and at Belleau Wood. During the last-named battle, Gunnery Sergeant Stockham displayed the \"conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty\" which later earned him the Medal of Honor by an Act of Congress.\n\nGy. Sgt. Stockham died in France on June 22, 1918. Thanks to the efforts of his former Lt., Clifton Cates (who would eventually become Marine Corps Commandant) and comrades, one of whom was the man whose life his gas mask saved, Barak Mattingly, Gy. Sgt. Stockham was belatedly and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by an Act of Congress on December 21, 1939, over 20 years after his sacrifice.\n\nRank and organization: Gunnery Sergeant, U.S. Marine Corps, 96th Company, 2d Battalion, 6th Regiment (Marines), 2d Division, American Expeditionary Forces.

General Orders: War Department, General Orders No. 15 (July 1939)\n\nCitation:\n\nDuring an intense enemy bombardment with high explosive and gas shells which wounded or killed many members of the company, G/Sgt. Stockham, upon noticing that the gas mask of a wounded comrade was shot away, without hesitation, removed his own gas mask and insisted upon giving it to the wounded man, well knowing that the effects of the gas would be fatal to himself. He continued with undaunted courage and valor to direct and assist in the evacuation of the wounded, until he himself collapsed from the effects of gas, dying as a result thereof a few days later. His courageous conduct undoubtedly saved the lives of many of his wounded comrades and his conspicuous gallantry and spirit of self-sacrifice were a source of great inspiration to all who served with him.\n\nNote – Gunnery Sergeant Stockham's Medal of Honor was awarded by the Secretary of the Army and, thus, it would have been of the Army design rather than the naval design.\n\nRank and organization: Gunnery Sergeant, U.S. Marine Corps, 96th Company, 6th Regiment (Marines), 2nd Division, American Expeditionary Forces.

{"id": "1868045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868045", "title": "Jane (comic strip)", "text": "Jane (comic strip)\n\nJane is a comic strip created and drawn by Norman Pett exclusively for the British tabloid newspaper \"The Daily Mirror\" from 5 December 1932 to 10 October 1959.\n\nJane was born when artist Norman Pett made a wager that he could create a comic strip as popular to adults as the strip \"Pip, Squeak and Wilfred\" was to children. Originally Pett's wife Mary modelled for him, but in the late 1930s, she abandoned modelling in pursuit of golf. Pett then teamed up with Chrystabel Leighton-Porter whom he met while she was modelling for a class in Birmingham in 1939.\n\nOriginally entitled Jane's Journal, Or the Diary of a Bright Young Thing, the salacious comic strip featured the misadventures of the title ingenue. The heroine had a habit of frequently (and most often inadvertently) losing her clothes. Her intimate confidant was a pet dachshund named Fritz. Her full name was Jane Gay, a play on the name Lady Jane Grey.\n\nThe strip became very popular during the Second World War and was considered morale-boosting, inspiring a similar American version, Milton Caniff's comic strip \"Male Call\". Until 1943, Jane rarely stripped beyond her undergarments, but then she made a fully nude appearance when getting out of a bath and clumsily falling into the middle of a crowd of British soldiers.\n\nNorman Pett's assistant Michael Hubbard continued, beginning in 1948, to develop the cartoon's original storyline until ending in 1959 – with charmer Georgie giving Jane a happy marriage and ending the series. The \"Mirror\" tried to revive the character on several occasions. One such comic strip was \"Jane, Daughter of Jane\", who was apparently the original's grown-up offspring, but she lacked her mother's charm and innocence. Another attempt was made during the 1980s.\n\n\nDuring 1945, King Features Syndicate attempted to distribute \"Jane\" in the United States. However, the nudity was too much for prudish American audiences, and the attempt ceased during 1946.\n\nOther comics in the tradition of, and possibly inspired by, \"Jane\" include \"Sally the Sleuth\", \"Male Call\" and \"Little Annie Fanny\".\n\nThe strip inspired an eponymous stage play during the 1940s, with Leighton-Porter playing the character of Jane (see Jane on Stage). Chrystabel also featured in a 1949 movie, \"The Adventures of Jane\", directed by Edward G. Whiting. A 1987 movie, \"Jane and the Lost City\", starring Kirsten Hughes in the title role, was directed by Terry Marcel.\n\nA television series was made by the BBC between 1982 and 1984, featuring Glynis Barber in the title role. The first season was titled simply \"Jane\", while the second was titled \"Jane in the Desert\". Despite the early evening scheduling slot, the show was decidedly risqué with Jane continuously stripping down to her underwear, including stockings and suspenders. At the end of the second series' closing episode she appeared topless momentarily. Despite considerable publicity in the press at the time of its original screening, the show became somewhat obscure and has never had a commercial video or DVD release. The show was briefly revived during 1985 as a three-part sequence shown over a single morning on Breakfast Television but without Glynis Barber in the main role.\n\nDuring and after World War II, Chrystabel Leighton-Porter performed a striptease act as the character of Jane. In the war, it was compulsory for actors and entertainers to join ENSA (Entertainments National Service Association) whose job it was to organize entertainment for the troops, and although Chrystabel's audience were mainly soldiers, she was never asked by ENSA to perform on the front line. Chrystabel explained:\n\nThe content of the act varied due to restrictions set in by local censors.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1868053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868053", "title": "Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant", "text": "Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant\n\nThe Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant, or THORP, is a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria, England. THORP is owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and operated by Sellafield Ltd (which is the site licensee company). Spent nuclear fuel from nuclear reactors is reprocessed to separate the 96% uranium and the 1% plutonium, which can be reused in mixed oxide fuel, from the 3% radioactive wastes, which are treated and stored at the plant. The uranium is then made available for customers to be manufactured into new fuel.\n\nOn 14 November 2018 it was announced that operations had ended at THORP. The facility will be used to store spent nuclear fuel until the 2070s.\n\nConstruction of THORP started in the 1970s, and was completed in 1994. The plant went into operation in August 1997. Build cost was £1.8 billion.\n\nBetween 1977 and 1978 an inquiry was held into an application by British Nuclear Fuels plc for outline planning permission to build a new plant to reprocess irradiated oxide nuclear fuel from both UK and foreign reactors. The inquiry was to answer three questions: \"1. Should oxide fuel from United Kingdom reactors be reprocessed in this country at all; whether at Windscale or elsewhere? 2. If yes, should such reprocessing be carried on at Windscale? 3. If yes, should the reprocessing plant be about double the estimated site required to handle United Kingdom oxide fuels and be used as to the spare capacity, for reprocessing foreign fuels?\". The result of the inquiry was that the new plant, the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant, was given the go-ahead in 1978, although it was not completed until the 1990s at a cost of £1.8 billion.\n\nIn 1998/99, the plant faced severe economic difficulties when it failed to reach its reprocessing targets. Shut-downs for six months in the first half of 1998 and for several further months from December 1998, due to leakages, resulted in a failure to achieve the target of reprocessing 900 tonnes of fuel over that period. Most of the reprocessing contracts were with Germany and Japan.\n\nOn 14 November 2018 it was announced that operations had ended at THORP, now that all reprocessing contracts had been fulfilled. The facility will be used to store spent nuclear fuel until the 2070s.\n\nPlant demolition will take place after a period to allow radiation levels to decline, and is expected to occur between 2075 and 2095. The estimated cost of decommissioning is forecast as £4 billion at 2018 prices.\n\nThe chemical flowsheet for THORP is designed to add less non-volatile matter to the first cycle PUREX raffinate, one way in which this is done is by avoiding the use of ferrous compounds as plutonium reducing agents. In this plant the reduction is done using either hydrazine or HAN (hydroxylamine nitrate). The plant releases gaseous emissions of krypton-85, a radioactive beta-emitter with a half-life of 10.7 years. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) commenced 24-hour atmospheric monitoring for krypton-85 in 1993, prior to the plant's commissioning.\n\nThe cooled oxide fuel is chopped up in the Shear Cell and the fuel dissolved in nitric acid. It is chemically conditioned before passing to the chemical separation plant. Pulsed columns (designated HA/HS) are used to initially separate the majority of the uranium and plutonium from the fission products by transferring them into the solvent phase, which comprises tri-butyl phosphate in odourless kerosene (TBP/OK). The transfer is done in the HA column with the HS column providing further removal of fission products. 2 further pulsed columns (designated BS/BX) and a mixer/settler assembly (1BXX) then separate the uranium and plutonium into separate streams. Plutonium is reduced to the +3 oxidation state, which is insoluble in the solvent phase so ends up in the aqueous phase exiting the 1BX column.\n\nThe 1BXX mixer/settler completes the removal of Pu from the solvent phase. The 1BS column removes any remaining Uranium from the aqueous phase by the use of fresh solvent.\n\nPulsed columns then purify the plutonium, removing the troublesome fission products that remain. A mixer/settlet (1C) is used to transfer (washes) the uranium across to the aqueous phase ready for the next stage. Uranium purification is achieved using three mixer settlers (UP1 - UP3) similar to those in use on the existing Magnox reprocessing plant. Evaporation of the two product streams then occurs before further processing is undertaken. Uranium is converted to UO powder while the plutonium is converted to PuO powder and sent to storage.\n\nPulsed columns were chosen to avoid the risk of a criticality incident occurring within the plant. This can happen if sufficient fissile material comes together to start an uncontrolled chain reaction, producing a large release of neutrons. The risks and mechanisms are well understood and the plant design is arranged to prevent its occurrence, i.e.: intrinsically safe.\n\nOn 9 May 2005 it was announced that THORP suffered a large leak of a highly radioactive solution, which first started in July 2004. British Nuclear Group's board of inquiry determined that a design error led to the leak, while a complacent culture at the plant delayed detection for nine months. Operations staff did not discover the leak until safeguards staff reported major fluid accountancy discrepancies.\n\nAltogether 83 cubic metres (18,250 imperial gallons) of nitric acid solution leaked from a small fractured feedpipe, which was discovered when a remote camera was sent in to examine THORP's Feed Clarification Cell on 19 April 2005. All the fluids collected under gravity into the secondary containment, which is a stainless steel tub embedded in 2 metre thick reinforced concrete, capable of holding 250 cubic metres of fluids.\n\nThe solution from the spill was estimated to contain 20 metric tons of uranium and 160 kilograms of plutonium. The leaked solution was safely recovered into primary containment using originally installed steam ejectors. Radiation levels in the cell preclude entry of humans and robotic repair of the fractured pipe is expected to be difficult. Officials are considering bypassing the faulty tank to resume operations.\n\nThe pipe fractured due to lateral motion of an accountancy tank, which measures volume by weight and moves horizontally and vertically in the process. The tank's original design had restraint blocks to prevent lateral motion, but these were later removed from the design for seismic uncoupling. However it appears this design change was not evaluated for fatigue, and it is inconceivable a proper review would have permitted this change.\n\nThe incident was classified as Level 3 out of 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES), a \"serious incident\", due to the amount of radioactive inventory that leaked from primary to secondary containment without discovery over a number of months. This was initially considered by BNFL to be surprisingly high, but the specifications of the scale required it.\n\nThe British Nuclear Group was convicted for breaches of health and safety regulations following the accident, and fined £500,000.\n\nProduction eventually restarted at the plant in early 2008 but almost immediately had to be put on hold again, for the repair of an underwater lift that moves fuel for reprocessing.\n\n\n\n"}

He played seventeen seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a third baseman, most notably for the Montreal Expos from to . A five-time All-Star, Wallach excelled as an offensive and as a defensive player, winning 2 Silver Slugger Awards and 3 Gold Glove Awards. In addition to the Expos, he also played for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Angels and coached for the Dodgers and Miami Marlins.\n\nWallach was born in Huntington Park, California, and grew up in Tustin, California. He attended high school at University High School in neighboring Irvine, California. There he played on the school's lower-level baseball team during his freshman and sophomore years before being promoted to the varsity team for his last two years. Wallach was not drafted by a major league team out of high school. He enrolled at Saddleback College and transferred to California State University, Fullerton to play college baseball for the Cal State Fullerton Titans.\n\nWallach played for the United States national baseball team in the 1978 Amateur World Series. His stat-line in the series was .395/.455/.763, while having 14 runs and runs batted in (RBIs), both being the second-most in the series. The United States finished second to Cuba in the tournament. Wallach led the Titans to its first Division I title in while being awarded the Golden Spikes Award. He was selected on the 1979 College Baseball All-America Team and named the \"Sporting News\" College Player of the Year.\n\nWallach made his major league debut at the age of 22 on September 6, 1980, against the San Francisco Giants after replacing Ron LeFlore at left field. In his first plate appearance in the top of the 5th inning, he was walked, but in his second plate appearance in the 8th, he hit a home run. Wallach and Brett Pill (September 6, 2011) are the only two players from Cal State Fullerton to hit a home run in their first at bat. Wallach appeared in four other games in that season. He appeared in 71 games in the following season, having 50 hits and 13 RBIs with a .236 batting average. He appeared in the postseason run with the Expos, appearing in five games. In Game 1 of the 1981 National League Division Series, he went 1-of-2 with a double and a walk while scoring a run. In the other four games that he appeared in, he went hitless. 1982 was his first full-time season, and he played in 158 games while having 160 hits, 28 home runs, 31 doubles, and 97 RBIs with a .268 batting average. He slightly regressed the following year, playing in 156 games while having 156 hits, 33 doubles, 19 home runs, and 70 RBIs with a .269 batting average. In 1984, Wallach played in 160 games with 143 total hits, 18 home runs, and 72 RBIs on a .246 batting average, but also had 101 strikeouts (a career high) while being named to the All-Star Game, his first. He improved the following year, playing in 155 games while also having 148 hits, 36 doubles, 22 home runs, 81 RBIs with a .260 batting average while also being selected to the All-Star Game once again. He was also awarded a Gold Glove and the Silver Slugger Award. He regressed a bit the next season, playing in 134 games while having 112 hits, 22 doubles, 18 home runs and 71 RBIs with a .233 batting average, although he led the league in being hit by pitch with 10.\n\nIn 1987, Wallach was named to the All-Star Game once again while winning a Silver Slugger Award and finishing 4th in Most Valuable Player voting, doing so in 153 games while having 177 hits, 26 home runs, 42 doubles, and 123 RBIs with a .298 batting average, with the latter three being career highs. He regressed a bit the next season, having 152 hits, 32 doubles, 12 home runs and 69 RBIs with a .257 batting average in 159 games, although he did win the Gold Glove, his second. He rebounded in 1989, being named to the All-Star Game, playing in 154 games while getting 159 hits, 42 doubles, 13 home runs and 77 RBIs with a .277 batting average. He continued his success in 1990, playing in a career high 161 games while having 185 hits, 37 doubles, 21 home runs, 98 RBIs and a .296 batting average while being named to the All-Star Game and finishing 10th in MVP voting while winning the Gold Glove for the third and final time. He was named team captain prior to the 1991 season, being the first team captain in franchise history. He regressed in production in his final two seasons with the Expos, playing in 301 combined games while having a total of 250 hits, 51 doubles, 22 home runs and 132 RBIs while hitting under .230 both seasons. On December 24, 1992, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Tim Barker.\n\nWallach played in 133 games for the Dodgers, getting 106 hits (his lowest since having 112 in 1986), with 19 doubles, 12 home runs and 62 RBIs with a .222 batting average. In the strike shortened 1994 season, he played in 113 games (out of 114 that the Dodgers played), having 116 hits, 21 doubles and 23 home runs (his highest since having 21 in 1990) with 78 RBIs and a .280 batting average. He finished 18th in MVP voting. He played in just 97 games for the Dodgers in 1995, having 87 hits (his lowest since having 50 in 1981) with 22 doubles, nine home runs and 38 RBIs and a .266 batting average.

{"id": "1868058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868058", "title": "Abune Paulos", "text": "Abune Paulos\n\nAbune Paulos (born Gebremedhin Woldeyohannes; 3 November 1936 – 16 August 2012) was an Ethiopian patriarch for Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church from 1992 to his death in 2012. His full title was \"His Holiness Abuna Paulos, Fifth Patriarch and Catholicos of Ethiopia, Ichege of the see of Saint Tekle Haymanot, Archbishop of Axum and one of the seven serving Presidents of the World Council of Churches.\"\n\nAbune Paulos was born in Adwa in Tigray Province; his birth name was Gebre Medhin Wolde Yohannes. His family was long associated with the Abba Garima Monastery near the town, and he entered the monastery as a young boy as a deacon trainee, eventually taking monastic orders and being ordained a priest. Then known as Abba Gebre Medhin, he continued his education at the Theological College of the Holy Trinity in Addis Ababa under the patronage of Patriarch Abune Tewophilos. He was sent to study at the St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in the United States, and afterwards joined the doctoral program at the Princeton Theological Seminary.\n\nIn 1974, his education was interrupted by a summons from Patriarch Abune Tewophilos, and returned to Addis Ababa shortly after the revolution that toppled Emperor Haile Selassie. He was anointed a bishop along with four others, assuming the name and style of Abune Paulos, and given responsibility for ecumenical affairs by the Patriarch. But because the Patriarch had named these new bishops without the permission of the new Derg communist junta, all five men were arrested, and the Patriarch was eventually executed. Abune Paulos and his fellow bishops were imprisoned until 1983. Abune Paulos returned to Princeton in 1984 to complete his doctoral degree there, and began his life as an exile. He was elevated to the rank of Archbishop by Patriarch Abune Takla Haymanot in 1986 while in exile.\n\nFollowing the fall of the Derg in 1991, the then Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Abuna Merkorios, was dethroned in circumstances that remain under dispute. Patriarch Abune Merkorios and his supporters maintain that he was forced from office by the new EPRDF-led government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and its supporters, while his opponents maintain that the Patriarch abdicated following numerous protests against him by the faithful. His attempt to reverse his abdication was refused by the Holy Synod of the Church which authorized a new Patriarchal election. Abune Paulos was elected in 1992, and Abune Merkorios and his supporters went into exile, establishing a rival synod in the United States. The enthronement of Abune Paulos as Patriarch was fully recognized by all the canonical Orthodox Christian Churches, including the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria Patriarchate in Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nDuring his office, much urban property that had been taken from the church was returned, most notably the return of the campus and the library of Holy Trinity Theological College, and the College was reopened. Abuna Paulos built a new Patriarchal office and residence complex at the site of the old one, and reformed the bureaucracy of the Patriarchate. He travelled widely, strengthening the ties of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church with other sister churches. He reluctantly acquiesced to the breaking away of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church when that country declared independence. Abune Paulos also took the initiative to the series of peace meetings between all Ethiopian and Eritrean religious leaders in 1998, 1999 and 2000 in an effort to bring peace between the two countries in response to a bitterly fought border war. Patriarch Abune Paulos and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church were extensively involved in the support of war-displaced and drought-hit Ethiopians, making the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church one of the major relief organizations in the country.\n\nIn 1995, Abuna Paulos asked for the faithful to fulfill their religious obligations by contributing their share to the restoration of Holy Trinity Cathedral. He led a Fundraising Committee of 15 people which was established to work within the country and abroad on the project.\n\nThe Patriarch continually championed the cause of the many victims of the Derg regime. Patriarch Abune Paulos presided over the funerals of Emperor Haile Selassie in 2000 (even in the face of government hostility to this event), Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen in 1997, and Princess Tenagnework in 2004. He also presided over the funerals of the 60 ex-officials of the Imperial government in 1993, and the funeral of the leading opposition leader of the time, Professor Asrat Woldeyes in 1998.\n\nAbuna Paulos also found success after he asked a British Museum to return ten \"tabots\" containing images of the Ark of the covenant. These carvings, supposedly so sacred that only ordained priests may look at them, were taken by British troops in 1868 during the rescue of the hostages imprisoned by the Emperor Tewdros. In March 2006, Abune Paulos was elected to serve as one of the seven presidents of the World Council of Churches, during its summit in Brazil. On 13 July 2007, Abune Paulos visited the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in Egypt, met with Pope Shenouda III of Egypt. This visit re-established the relationship between the Ethiopian and Coptic Church after time of separation. Abune Paulos visited some of the Coptic associations in Egypt, and on 15 July, he visited a Coptic Egyptian Church named after an Ethiopian Saint Tekle Haymanot Coptic Orthodox Church in Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nAbune Paulos implemented a proposal to build a University in Entoto that would help to commemorate the millennium according to the Ethiopian calendar. This University is intended to be a study and research center in Entoto Debre Hayl Saint Raguel Church. The Holy Synod and Abune Paulos appealed for the faithful to protect church heritages with a view to enabling them to be transferred to the next generation.\n\nAn act of Abune Paulos that caused much controversy was his advocacy of a pardon for the members of the Derg regime imprisoned in Ethiopia. The members of the Derg had asked the Patriarch to facilitate an opportunity for them to appear in the national press to ask for forgiveness from the people of Ethiopia for the errors and atrocities of their regime. The Patriarch approached the government with the idea that as the now aging members of the former communist junta were contrite and seeking forgiveness, the government should grant them clemency. On 1 June 2011, President Girma Wolde Giorgis of Ethiopia announced that the death sentences imposed on the top Derg members had been commuted to life sentences. As under Ethiopian law, a life sentence is equated to 25 years, both those previously sentenced to death and those imprisoned for life and lesser sentences were all immediately freed. This act immediately caused significant uproar among many of the survivors of Derg imprisonment, the family members of those killed during Derg rule and other opponents of Derg rule. The organization of survivors of victims of the Red Terror voiced their opposition and sent a letter of protest to the Patriarch. Members of the families of the 60 ex-officials of Emperor Haile Selassie's government executed without trial on November 23, 1974, as well as some members of the Imperial family met with Abune Paulos as well to make their views known. They believed that a commutation of death sentences to life imprisonment was not as objectionable, but that the release of people responsible for mass killings, torture, imprisonment without trial, and gross abuse of power was a great injustice. The Patriarch counseled these groups that it was the duty of Christians to forgive, especially those who voiced contrition. The groups opposed to the Derg pardon came away from the incident blaming Abune Paulos, but certain prominent members of the group, such as Mulugeta Aserate (son of Prince Aserate Kassa who was executed with the 60 ex-officials on 23 November 1974) wrote articles supporting the Patriarch's promotion of forgiveness and national reconciliation, and applauded the pardon.\n\nHis ecumenical trip to India to meet Baselios Thoma Didymos I, Catholicos of the East in December 2008, strengthened the communion of Ethiopian and Indian Orthodox Churches. On 26 June 2009, the Italian press claimed that Abune Paulos along with a man claiming to be a son of the late Prince Makonnen, Duke of Harar and Duke Amedeo of Aosta, would come forward at the Hotel Aldrovandi in Rome with the announcement that the true Ark of the Covenant, which has supposedly been kept in secret at St. Mary's of Zion in Ethiopia, would be unveiled to the public to view for the first time in history in a museum being built in Axum. The announcement was never made; instead the Patriarch immediately denied that any such event had ever been planned. The person that the Italian press had identified as the Ethiopian Prince was subsequently revealed as not being a recognized member of the former Imperial family, but rather a person claiming to be the illegitimate son of the late prince. The involvement of the Duke of Aosta in the affair was also called into question. The cornerstone for a museum at Axum was indeed laid by Patriarch Abune Paulos, but there are no plans to display or house the Ark of the Covenant there.\n\nHis attitude towards homosexual Ethiopians remains orthodox. In December 2008, he was one of nearly a dozen Ethiopian religious figures (including the leader of Ethiopian Muslim Majlis Council and the heads of the Protestant and Catholic churches) who adopted a resolution against homosexuality, urging Ethiopian lawmakers to endorse a ban on homosexual activity in the constitution. The religious figures attributed a rise in sexual attacks on children and young men to the vice of homosexuality. Abuna Paulos went on to say, \"This is something very strange in Ethiopia, the land of the Bible that condemns this very strongly. For people to act in this manner they have to be dumb, stupid like animals. We strongly condemn this behaviour. They (homosexuals) have to be disciplined and their acts discriminated, they have to be given a lesson.\"\n\nAbune Paulos died in Addis Ababa on 16 August 2012. The foreign ministry reported that he had been \"receiving treatment over the past week for an undisclosed illness.\" An opposition website, \"Ethiopian Review\", reported that he had died of a heart attack. Lij Mulugeta Aserate Kassa, an adviser at the Ethiopian embassy in the United Kingdom, and a member of a cadet branch of Ethiopia's deposed Imperial family, noted that Abune Paulos had been in good health the previous day and had led a church service. He later felt ill and was taken to Balcha Hospital, according to an independent Orthodox website, Deje Selam, where he died early in the following morning. Although Lij Mulugeta said that he could not confirm the cause of death, Patriarch Abune Paulos was known to have suffered from hypertension and diabetes. Ethiopians were stunned to learn that Prime Minister Meles Zenawi had also died only four days after the Patriarch.\n\nPaulos was buried at Addis Ababa's Holy Trinity Cathedral on August 23, 2012. Several thousand people, as well as representatives from other churches, diplomats, and government officials, attended the state funeral.\n\nAbune Paulos was a scholar and peace advocate and a former exile in the United States who has worked on reconciliation between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Patriarch Abune Paulos and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church were also involved in the support of war-displaced and drought-hit Ethiopians, making the Church one of the major \"relief organisations\" in the country. His peace efforts and humanitarian work were the main reasons for his being chosen to receive the Nansen Medal by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR).\n\nOn 30 December 2008, Abune Paulos was awarded the Order of St. Thomas (the highest honorary award given by Indian Orthodox Church) by Catholicos of the East HH Baselios Marthoma Didymos I at Parumala Seminary, India.\n\nPatriarch Abune Paulos also met with President Omar Hassan Al-Bashir of Sudan in Khartoum to try to find a peaceful solution to the Darfur conflict that has been labeled as a genocide by Western critics. Abune Paulos said “No one loves Africa more than Africans.” The Patriarch stated that finding an \"African solution\" is significant to curb problems of the continent. He also held talks with senior government officials and religious leaders during his five-day working visit to Khartoum and called for religious leaders to strengthen their efforts towards peace.\n\nHe served as a member of central committee of the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Faith and Order commission, and attended the Nairobi assembly. Abune Paulos was one of the rare exceptionally educated Patriarchs in Ethiopian history because he had completed various degrees and received his doctoral degree at prestigious institutions. Abune Paulos was one of the seven presidents of WCC as well.\n\nAbune Paulos served as an Honorary President of \"Religions for Peace\", the world's largest and most representative multi-religious coalition, advancing common action among the world's religious communities for peace.\n\nAbune Paulos was a Knight Grand Collar of The Order of The Eagle of Georgia and The Seamless Tunic of our Lord Jesus Christ, an order of the Royal family of Georgia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1868070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868070", "title": "Robert Overton", "text": "Robert Overton\n\nMajor-General Robert Overton (about 1609–1678) was a prominent English soldier and scholar, who supported the Parliamentary cause during the English Civil War, and was imprisoned a number of times during the Protectorate and the English Restoration for his strong republican views.\n\nAs positions hardened during the period before the English Civil War, Robert Overton supported the Parliamentary cause. He was probably influenced by Sir William Constable later to become a regicide. At the outbreak of the First English Civil War, he tried to join the army of Lord Ferdinando Fairfax, but no official positions were available. He was allowed to fight without any definite rank and distinguished himself in the defence of Hull and at the Battle of Marston Moor. In August 1645 the governor of Pontefract, Sir Thomas Fairfax, appointed Overton deputy governor of Pontefract. Shortly after this appointment Overton captured Sandal Castle. Overton was acting governor during the siege of Pontefract Castle; it was reported that he was inconsiderate to Lady Cutler and refused to let Sir Gervaise Cutler be buried in the church.\n\nHaving gained a commission in the New Model Army in July 1647, he was given command of the late Colonel Herbert's Regiment of Foot. During the political debates within the New Model Army he appeared as a member of the Army Council sitting on the committee for the duration of the Putney Debates. In March 1648, Fairfax appointed Overton deputy governor of Kingston upon Hull. There he became acquainted with notable puritan and poet Andrew Marvell, but was a very unpopular with the townsfolk. They were known to by sympathetic to the Royalist cause when in June 1648 the town Mayor and some of the town council petitioned for his removal. The sources differ as to his actions during Second English Civil War, but one historian concluded that he spent the war in Hull, while another that he fought with Oliver Cromwell in Wales and the North of England, capturing the Isle of Axholme; that he was also with Cromwell when Charles I was taken to the Isle of Wight.\n\nOverton enthusiastically supported the trial of the King in late 1648 and early 1649, but wrote that he only wanted him deposed and not executed. He disagreed with other points of policy of the early Commonwealth government publishing his position in a pamphlet titled \"\"The declaration of the officers of the garrison of Hull in order to the peace and settlement of the kingdom\"\" and accompanying letter to Thomas Fairfax, in early January. The letter makes it clear that he supported actions like Pride's Purge if the \"corrupt Commons\" stopped the Army's reforms. Barbara Taft reflected in the last six pages of the \"declaration\" the case made in the \"Remonstrance\" by the New Model Army to Parliament, the rejection of which had triggered Pride's Purge:\na speedy end to the present parliament; a succession of free biennial parliaments with an equitable distribution of seats; future kings elected by the people's representatives and having no negative voice; a ‘universal and mutual Agreement, … enacted and decreed, in perpetuum’, that asserts that the power of parliament is ‘inferior only to that of the people’|Declaration of the Officers of the Garrison of Hull\n\nAs divisions within the New Model Army widened during the Summer of 1649, fear spread that that disunity would be exploited by their enemies, Overton issued a letter that made it clear that he sided with the Rump Parliament and the Grandees against the Levellers. When the Third Civil War broke out in 1650 he accompanied Cromwell to Scotland and commanded a Foot Brigade at the Battle of Dunbar his regiment was also involved in the English Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Inverkeithing (20 July 1651) where Colonel Overton commanded the reserve.\nWhen New Model Army returned to England in pursuit of the invading Royalist Scottish army, Overton remained in Scotland as governor of Edinburgh. He helped complete the subjugation of Scotland and commanded an expedition to reduce the garrison forces on Orkney. On 14 May 1652 a grateful Parliament voted Scottish lands to him with an annual income of 400 pounds sterling per year. In December 1652, when George Monck's successor Richard Deane was recalled, the General appointed him as Military Commander over all English forces in the Western Highlands with the governorship of Aberdeen, the senior rank of Major-General.\n\nOn his father's death in 1653 he returned to England inheriting the family estates in Easington as eldest son and heir. At the same time he resumed duties as Governor of Hull. During 1650 he and his wife had become members of the \"church\": in retrospect he considered the execution of Charles I as a fulfilment of the fundamentals of Old Testament scripture so often cited in Ezekiel 21:26-27:\n\n\"Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.\" concerning the humble and the meek, exorcised by God in \"overturning\" the established order. Overton wrote: \"the Lord...is forced to shake and shake and overturn and overturn; this is a shaking, overturning dispensation.\" Some sources promoted the belief he was a Fifth Monarchist, but his views seemed to have spanned several of the religious beliefs and political grouping of the day and it is difficult to label him as belonging to any one group.\n\nHe hailed Cromwell's dissolution of the Rump Parliament in June 1653, yet subsequently became disenchanted, suspicious of Cromwell as more dictator than Lord Protector. Although his letters to Cromwell remained cordial, during the early years of the Protectorate he seems to have become more inclined to distance himself from the Lord Protector, advising a diminution with the speed of reform. Cromwell informed him that he could keep his position in the army so long as he promised to relinquish his office when he could no longer support the policies of the Protectorate. In September 1654 he returned to his command in Scotland, a conveniently long distance from GHQ in London. There he planned a coup d'état; in December 1654, Overton was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower for his part in the self-styled \"Overton Revolt\". It was alleged that a verse in Overton's handwriting was found amongst his papers:\nHe was accused of planning a military insurrection against the government and plotting to assassinate Monck. It is not clear how involved he was in the plot, but he was good friends with Monck at the time, so it was unlikely he was involved. But whatever his real position he was considered too lenient with his \"disaffected officers\" in sanctioning their meetings and there was evidence that he held meetings with John Wildman, an incorrigible Leveller plotter, prepared to use anyone to bring down the government. Later while in the Tower of London, he wrote to others informing them of Wildman's plans. At the time a fellow prisoner wrote of Overton, \"He was a great independent, civil and decent, a scholar, but a little pedantic.\"In 1655 Cromwell was convinced enough of his guilt to have him removed from the governorship of Hull and to confiscate the lands granted to him by Parliament in Scotland handing them back to Earl of Leven the owner before they were sequestrated.\n\nOverton remained incarcerated in the Tower until March 1658 when he was moved to Elizabeth Castle on the island of Jersey. Barbara Taft mentions that \"It is not unlikely that respect for Overton's ability and fear of his appeal as an opposition leader played a major role in his imprisonment.\" After Cromwell's death and the re-installation of the Commonwealth, Grizelle, his sister, his wife Anne, her brother, and many Republicans, presented his case to Parliament, on 3 February 1659, along with letters from Overton's close friend John Milton. Overton and John Milton probably became acquainted from an early moment in their careers in St Giles, Cripplegate, where they removed and lived for a time. Milton considered Overton a scholar and celebrated him and his exploits in his \"Defensio Secundo\" by writing:\n\n\"...bound to me these many years past in friendship of more than brotherly closeness and affection, both by the similarity of our tastes and the sweetness of your manners.\" Milton also included Overton in his list of \"twelve apostles of revolutionary integrity.\"\n\nAfter hearing his case on 16 March 1659, Parliament ordered Overton's release pronouncing his imprisonment illegal. Overton's return was called \"his greatest political triumph; a huge crowd, bearing laurel branches, acclaimed him and diverted his coach from its planned path.\" In June 1659 he was restored to a command and further compensated for his losses. Charles II wrote him promising forgiveness for past disloyalty and rewarded him for services in effecting the restoration. Overton was appointed governor of Hull and again was unpopular, many referring to him as \"Governor Overturn,\" because of his association with the Fifth Monarchists who used the phrase liberally. This perception was reinforced by the sermons of John Canne, a well known Fifth Monarchist preacher in Overton's regiment at Hull.\nOn 12 October 1659 he was one of seven major-generals in whom Parliament vested the government of the army until January 1660.\n\nBy early 1660, Overton's position started to diverge from that of Monck, as he did not support the return of Charles II, yet he and his officers refused to aid Generals Lambert and Fleetwood. Seeking to mediate published an exhortation to them to maintain the Lord's cause, entitled \"The Humble Healing Advice of R.O.\" The ambiguity implicit by his of conduct described in letters to troops stationed in Yorkshire caused Monck much embarrassment. As a result, Monck requested Lord Thomas Fairfax order him to take any order he gave. On 4 March 1660, a day after Lambert's arrest, Monck ordered Overton to surrender his command to Fairfax and come to London. Overton planned a stand, but he must have seen that defeat would have been inevitable. Hull's disaffection for him and some division among the garrison caused him to allow himself to be replaced by Thomas Fairfax's son, Charles Fairfax. The Garrison in Hull began the English Civil War as the first town to resist Charles I and was among the last to accept his son Charles II. After 1642 no monarch would set foot in Hull for over 200 years.\n\nOverton was an independent and a republican. He was regarded, perhaps falsely, as one of the Fifth Monarchists, and at the first rumour of insurrection was arrested and sent to the Tower of London in December 1660, where Samuel Pepys went to see him writing in his diary that Overton had been found with a large quantity of arms. Pepys recorded that Overton had told him that the arms were brought to London to sell.\n\nOverton was briefly at liberty in the Autumn of 1661. Realising that he might be re-arrested at any moment, he spent time arranging his financial and personal affairs. He issued a series of deeds to make provision for his mother, his wife and family and to avoid confiscation of his property by the Crown. Most of his properties were sold to his family, to his sons Ebenezer and Fairfax and his daughter Joanna, and close friends. The last documents were executed on 7 November 1661 and on 9 November 1661 he was sent to Chepstow Castle. He managed a short interval of freedom but was again arrested on 26 May 1663 on \"suspicion of seditious practices and for refusing to sign the oaths or give security.\" As Andrew Marvell, the English Satirist, wrote in a letter to John Milton, \"Col. Overton [was] one of those steady Republicans whom Cromwell was unable to conciliate and was under the necessity of security.\"\n\nIn 1664 the government sent him to Jersey, the second time he had been imprisoned there and this time it was to be for seven years. During this time he was allowed out and about on the island which was not uncommon for high-ranking political prisoners. Overton spent the years of his incarceration in Mont Orgueil Castle trying to establish his freedom. In a 370-page manuscript of letters, meditations and poetry to his beloved wife's memory and about religious subjects was the manuscript \"Gospell Observations & Religious Manifestations &c.\", He remained a prisoner on Jersey until early December 1671 when he was released to his brother-in-law by a warrant signed by Charles II. He returned to England and lived his last years with or near his daughters and probably two sons in Rutland.\n\nOverton's will is dated 23 June 1678, aged 69, Nan Overton West records that he was buried on 2 July 1678 in Seaton churchyard, overlooking the Welland Valley and Rockingham Castle while Barbra Taft writes that he was buried in the New Churchyard, Moorfields, London.\n\nOverton was born at Easington Manor in Holderness, Yorkshire in about 1609. His father was John Overton (~1566-1654) and his mother Joan (née Snawsell). He was the eldest of five children: Robert, Frances, Germaine, Griselle (Griselda) and Thomas. His education was completed at Gray's Inn where he was admitted on 1 November 1631.\n\nOverton married Anne Gardiner (a Londoner, born about 1613) at the Church of St. Bartholomew the Less in Smithfield, London on 28 June 1632. Anne's family were also extremists, republicans who were probably connected by marriage to Colonel John Rede or Colonel Thomas Reade; they were both linked to the Fifth Monarchists and the Leveller debates; they also followed the Anabaptist sect. It is unknown if they descended from Robert Rede, also named Reade, bishop of Chichester (d.1415), a courtier of Richard II.\n\nAnne Gardiner, or conceivably Gardner may have been of the same family mentioned in John Rees article. The Overtons had twelve children, Samuel, John, Robert, William, Jeremie, Fairfax and Ebenezer and daughters: Alatheia, Dorcas, Elizabeth, Anne and Joanna John (baptized at St Giles Cripplegate, London, 17 July 1635) and Joanna (born 1650). John was his eldest son, married Constance the daughter of Sir Francis Monkton of Howden, Knight. They had children Constance, Jane, Marie and Ann. John fell from grace when he left his wife and went on to marry Mary or Margaret Monckton, who was the daughter of Sir Francis and Margaret Monckton of Kent. They went on to have several more children. \"This is unclear. Did he marry someone before or after Constance Monkton?\" The Easington estate was passed to John when Robert was imprisoned for the second time, to stop it being sequestered by the crown. Two leases to John dated 1 November 1661 and 7 November 1661, put the estate in lease to John for 99 years, and the ultimate benefit of Ebenezer (Benjamin) and Fairfax, the only other two sons alive at that time. That is why John is not mentioned in his father's will.\n\nThe South Aisle of the All Saints Church in Easington contains The Lady Chapel. Above the Altar is a monument dated 1651 which was placed there by Maj. Gen. Robert Overton in memory of his parents, \"the deceased but never to be divided John Overton and his wife Joan\".\n\nOverton's great-great-grandson, John Overton (1766-1833) was a judge at the Superior Court of Tennessee between 1804–1810. John's great-great-grandson, Richard Arvin Overton (b. 1906) of Austin, Texas is a supercentenarian, who is believed to be the oldest living man as well as the oldest World War II veteran in the United States.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1868071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868071", "title": "Comic book price guide", "text": "Comic book price guide\n\nComic book price guides are generally monthly, quarterly, or yearly publications which detail the changes in the resale value of a comic over a period of time. Price guides are also important tools for collectors looking to sell their collection or determine their collection’s worth for insurance purposes.\n\nEach collector will have his or her own preference regarding which authority to follow, but popular and respected guides have included \"The Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide\", \"Comics Buyer's Guide\" magazine, \"Wizard Magazine\", the Comics Buyer's Guide \"Standard Catalog of Comic Books\", and Human Computing’s ComicBase, an inventory/databasing software program. Popular online price guides include comicbookrealm.com (free), ComicsPriceGuide.com (free and paid services), RarityGuide (free and paid), and GPAnalysis.com specifically for CGC (certified) Comics (paid). Online and print price guides will have their own discrepancies, so a combination of several sources is often used by collectors to arrive at an accurate estimated value. Checking completed auctions at eBay and Heritage is also very helpful.\n\nAlthough many price guides come and go, long-standing publications such as \"Overstreet\" (which has been running for over 35 years) or the more recent \"Standard Catalog of Comic Books\", have long since become inextricable elements of comic collection history. These guides are popular resources for collectors and enthusiasts seeking information on anything from storylines to writers and artists to the original cover price of a comic. Grand Comics Database and comicbookrealm.com, in particular, offer users the ability to quickly search for characters by appearances and deaths. The Big Comic Book DataBase combines a searchable database of per issue character and creator information and a linked price guide.\n\nThe advent of certification enabled increased liquidity of comic books by removing disputes over grading and by disclosing restoration, and accelerated sales of comic books through online auction sites such as eBay or Heritage Auction Galleries. Certification is also valued by some comic price guide providers, as certification leaves the perception of removing the uncertainty about the actual grade of the comic book being sold, although, because books that are certified are graded by numerous different individuals, the dependability of these services is not universally agreed upon. Individual and/or aggregated reports of certified comic book sales are available online.\n\nBeginning in the early 1960s comics collectors (who often traded and sold to each other) were on the rise, and the number of comics dealers began to increase as well. In 1965, Michael Cohen and Tom Horsky published what is considered the first comics price guide, the one-shot digest \"The Argosy Price Guide\" (specifically for Hollywood, California's, Argosy Book Shop).\n\nComic back-issue prices had stabilized by the end of the 1960s. In 1970, Jerry Bails, who had recently published the \"Collector’s Guide to the First Heroic Age\", was considering creating a comic book price guide. He was contacted by Bob Overstreet, who was doing the same thing. Bails' extensive notes, supplemented by Overstreet's study of dealer listings, \"became a backbone to the \"Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide\".\" Overstreet's guide instantly became an invaluable resource tool for comic book collectors.\n\nThe Overstreet guide excluded the entire category of underground comix from its listings. This void was first addressed by Jay Kennedy in 1982 with \"The Official Underground And Newave Comix Price Guide\", and while out of print is a valuable resource for information about the artists and publishers. In 2006, Overstreet advisor and contributor Dan Fogel's Hippy Comix, Inc. published \"Fogel's Underground Comix Price Guide\", with 2010 to see a supplement magazine adding minicomics and British undergrounds alongside the latest pricing data.\n\nWith the advent of online auctioning services like eBay, price guides have seen dramatic declines in sales because their price listings were not reflective of the actual sale prices of comics. Shortly thereafter, \"Comics Buyer's Guide\" magazine and the \"CBG Standard Catalog of Comic Books\" started reporting actual completed auction results from eBay, covering periods longer than eBay's results are online. The 2005 edition of the \"Standard Catalog\" is 1,624 pages long and reports results back to 2002. The current online price guide for slabbed comics is GPAnalysis, which collects data of actual verified sales from several pre-approved sellers and auction houses.\n\nAn established independent company, such as Comic Guaranty LLC (CGC) or Comic Book Certification Service (CBCS) provides third party grading services for comics. Comic books can be sent to these companies for independent, impartial certification, including grading, restoration check and encapsulation within a tamper-evident protective holder.\n\nDealers and graders may often disagree with some grading classifications. Grading of comics can be subjective, although there are basic agreed upon standards within the industry. There is a numeric system which corresponds to a titled grading system. Both range from 0.5 (Poor) to 10.0 (Mint or \"Gem Mint\"). Many collectors and companies will use only numeric grading or terminology. Titled mixed grades, such as Very Good/Fine (5.0) are always titled with the lower grade followed by the larger grade. Within the grades, there might also be descriptive notes because comics with the same technical grade may have different reasons for that grade and many collectors have their own biases of what flaws are more acceptable than others.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although he can also play as a central defender, he operates primarily as a centre forward.\n\nHe won the Tippeligaen while playing for Brann and Rosenborg, and also competed professionally in Portugal, England, Germany and Turkey.\n\nKaradas was born in Nordfjordeid of Turkish origin, his surname meaning \"Black stone\" in Turkish. He started his career with Eid IL, moving to the professionals in 1999 with SK Brann.\n\nOn 13 March 2002, Karadas signed for Rosenborg BK, reportedly receiving death threats over this move. At his new club, his performances soon earned him a call-up to the Norwegian under-21s, and it was not long before foreign eyes focused on the him. He further enhanced his reputation by scoring two goals against Inter Milan in a UEFA Champions League game, a 2–2 home draw; he was linked with the likes of Roda JC, Liverpool and Udinese Calcio, but Portuguese club S.L. Benfica eventually bought the 23-year-old, and he joined the squad of veteran coach Giovanni Trapattoni after signing a four-year contract.\n\nAfter one season at Benfica, where he scored four goals (including a brace at S.C. Beira-Mar in a 3–2 win) and helped them win the Primeira Liga championship after 11 years, Karadas was loaned to Premier League side Portsmouth for 2005–06. His spectacular volley, which helped the relegation-threatened team earn a crucial 1–1 draw against Bolton Wanderers, was both his highlight and only goal of the campaign, in 20 overall appearances.\n\nA 16 June 2006 Norwegian press release reported that Benfica and Brann had agreed on a Karadas transfer back to Bergen. The deal was speculated to be worth (), where he was to give up £435,000 worth of bonuses Benfica owed him. Only his personal contract was an issue, as the player refused to give up a £350,000 compensation which had to be paid to him whenever he was sold from the Lisbon club.\n\nDespite being declared unwanted in Lisbon, Karadas returned to Benfica after his transfer to Brann fell through. On 16 August 2006, news broke out that he was in negotiations with German's 1. FC Kaiserslautern, which had just been relegated to the second division; the clubs finally agreed with a one-year loan deal, brokered by his uncle who was also his agent.\n\nKaradas made his debut in German football on 27 August 2006 in a 2–0 home league victory over SC Paderborn 07, starting but being substituted in the 61st minute. On 9 September he scored his first goal for his new team, in its 2–0 away victory over amateurs 1. FC Gera 03 for the first round of the German Cup. His first league goal came 20 days later in a 1–1 draw at SpVgg Unterhaching, his only of the season in an eventual sixth-place finish; he was also sent off after being shown two yellow cards in a local derby against 1. FC Köln, which ended in a 2–2 draw.\n\nOn 24 August 2007, Karadas signed a contract with Brann for a second spell with the club. In his comeback to Brann Stadion, in a match against Sandefjord Fotball on 2 September, he was greeted as a hero and a banner stating \"Vi hatet deg så mye, fordi vi elsker deg så høyt!\" (\"We hated you so much, because we love you so much!\"). The season ended with Tippeligaen conquest, with four goals in only eight appearances from the player.\n\nOn 1 September 2009, Karadas signed a three-year contract with Kasımpaşa S.K. of Turkey, scoring only once in seven contests in his debut campaign as the team ranked 11th the Süper Lig. On 27 May 2012 he netted a critical goal that brought his team back to the top flight, in the play-off match against Adanaspor.\n\nKaradas joined Sogndal Fotball in August 2012, on a short-term deal. He was injured early on, and only played in seven league matches. After being a free agent for three months he decided to return to the club in February 2013, leaving at the end of the season and returning for a third stint in 2014.\n\nOn 16 July 2014, 12 years later, Karadas returned to Brann.\n\nKaradas made his debut for the Norway national team on 24 January 2001, starting in a 3–2 win over South Korea for that year's Lunar New Year Cup. He went on to earn a total of ten caps, in seven years.\n\nAfter not renewing his playing contract with Brann, Karadas signed a three-year-contract on January 6 where he'll serve as an assistant coach for Brann 2 while taking his coaching badges. Karadas already finished his UEFA B-Licence while finishing his playing career. At the end of December 2019, Karadas declined an offer to take up the role as head coach for newly-formed Øygarden FK.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1868075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868075", "title": "Lagotto Romagnolo", "text": "Lagotto Romagnolo\n\nThe Lagotto Romagnolo (plural Lagotti) is a breed of dog that comes from the Romagna sub-region of Italy. The name derives from Romagnol \"can lagòt\", meaning \"water dog\". Its traditional function is a gundog, specifically a water retriever; however, it is often used to hunt for truffles.\n\nThe Lagotto Romagnolo is a curly coated dog with an appearance of being robust and hardy. All colors are allowed except black, the coat is dense and wooly in texture. The body is square and classified as medium in size. \n\nThe Lagotto is a Sporting breed. They generally have sharp senses, although their eyesight is more sensitive to motion than to detail. The breed is very loyal and loving, making them the perfect family companion. Some are easy to train, and many get along with other animals quite easily if they are socialized as puppies. Lagotti vary in their need for exercise, but should always be given stimulation to keep their minds occupied. In 1996 the first pair (Reno and Rosetta) in the UK, came from the Mandriole kennels near Comacchio where the dogs were still worked from traditional flat-bottomed punts as duck retrievers. These Lagotti, through subsequent exports from the UK which provided the foundation stock for Canada, USA and Australia, can be found behind many Lagotti worldwide. Visitors to the Lagotto Romagnolo Club of Great Britain breed, which stand at the world-famous Crufts Dog Show in the UK, will have seen photographs of British Lagotti (including Rosetta) retrieving hare, rabbit and various types of wildfowl. It is also worth noting that the photograph on the back of the first official video produced in Italy circa 1996, showed a group of Lagotti working - not truffling, but duck-shooting from a punt. In that punt were the parents and grandparents of Rosetta and Reno. The instinct to hunt, swim and retrieve is inborn and does not have to be encouraged. Lagotti have to be trained from an early age to look for truffles.\n\nIn modern times, the Lagotto has been bred primarily as a truffle-searching dog, and not as a retriever or hunting dog. Its highly developed nose makes it a prime search dog.\n\nSome Lagotti are excellent swimmers, while some will only paddle. Some will retrieve from lakes, streams and other bodies of water without hesitation. They are lovable family pets and tend to like attention. Lagotti love to dig. Many owners give them a sandbox, or have a designated place to allow them to satisfy their digging urges. They also love to play seeking games and have very active and clever minds.\n\nThere are conflicting ideas on how to groom this breed. Some say they should be brushed regularly and others believe their coat should be allowed to grow to a naturally fluffy coat. The Lagotto coat gets matted easily, and the mats should be carefully pulled apart without tearing the coat. The Lagotto has a thick, waterproof double coat of hair rather than fur and should be groomed on a regular basis. It is recommended that the coat be cut down at least once every year.\n\nIf the coat is kept trimmed to approximately 1.5 inches all over the body and slightly longer on the head, it will be easier to maintain. Hair on the ears should be trimmed around the edges to the leather. If the ears show irritation or buildup of dirt and earwax, the hairs from the ear canal should be gently plucked out regularly. Some coats matt more easily than others. If left untended, Lagotti hair will grow to cover the eyes. The hair around their eyes should be clipped periodically to ensure that they can see.\n\nIn the United States, the coat should be shown in a rustic style with no fluffing or blowing out. The coat should match the lines of the dog and the curls should be evident. The dog should have the appearance of the working dog that it is. If clipped down, the coat will need about 3 months of growth to be ready to show. Otherwise, shaping can be performed before a competition.\n\nLagotto live roughly 15–17 years. Some health issues, especially neurological disorders are associated with this breed; however, these are mostly attributable to poor breeding. Genetically testing prior to breeding is necessary to avoid the most common diseases in the breed. \nIssues include:\n\nA new neurodegenerative disorder, called \"Neuroaxonal Dystrophy\", that was originally identified in Spanish Water Dogs has been identified in the breed in 2016. It is not known yet whether it is related to the disorders already associated with the Lagotto Romagnolo. https://os.genoscoper.com/crm/disorders/323_TECPR2_SWD/os/323_TECPR2_SWD.pdf\n\nLagotto puppies are crucial in research regarding epilepsy. In July 2011, researchers in Finland reported the discovery of a mutation in a gene called Lgi2 that may be a new candidate gene for human benign childhood epilepsy. Lgi2 is the first gene that can be linked directly to the remission that carriers experience after the age of ten. Lagotto breeders are now using genetic tests to screen for the mutation.\n\nThe Lagotto is a breed of water retriever from the lowlands of Comacchio and marshlands of Ravenna, Italy. Modern water retrieving dog breeds are believed to have descended in part from the Lagotto Romagnolo. \n\nAndrea Mantegna in the 1474 work titled \"The Meeting\" depicts a small dog in the lower left corner that resembles a Lagotto.\n\n"}

Elements of the complex dated from 1904, where all aspects of Buick vehicles were constructed, and it became known as Buick City in 1985. Operations ceased completely in 2010. The site was vacated by GM employees and site responsibilities were transferred to Motors Liquidation Company as of December 6, 2010. The final cars built at Buick City were the Pontiac Bonneville and the Buick LeSabre. Manufacturing operations were transferred to Orion Assembly.\n\nThe original factory at one time was the largest in the world, consisting of 24 separate buildings contributing to the manufacturing process, until 1928 when the Ford River Rouge Plant was completed and began operations. In the beginning, all components were manufactured in one location, to include wheel bearings, nuts, bolts, and screws, to transmissions, suspension components, wheels and interior components. Operations were carried out in this fashion well into the 1940s and beyond.\n\nAfter World War II, when vehicle production resumed, Buick City was the primary location where all components were created, with Knock-down kits distributed to assembly plants in major metropolitan US cities, where the vehicles were locally assembled and distributed in their respective regions.\n\nThe plant originated with Buick before the formation of General Motors. Other elements were built by early manufacturers and suppliers like Fisher Body. The Buick City concept represented a successful attempt by General Motors to experiment with just-in-time manufacturing methods in response to Japanese manufacturers. The experiment included successes: The 1989 Buick LeSabre built in Buick City was ranked the top car in the J.D. Power and Associates rankings for that year; it was the first American built car to appear on the list. In 1999, the year the plant was closed, Buick City won J. D. Power's Platinum Award for assembly plant quality . The plant closed on June 29, 1999. As of 2016, it is the only General Motors plant to win the award. The closing of GM's manufacturing plants in Flint, and its subsequent economic toll on the community was chronicled in Michael Moore's documentary film, \"Roger & Me\".\n\nThe plant's acreage became an EPA cleanup site .\n\nIn 2013, American Cast Iron Pipe Company announced plans to construct a new 200,000 square foot manufacturing plant on the former Buick City complex.\n\nOn August 11, 2017 A 156,000-square-foot Lear Corporation seat manufacturing facility situated on 33 acres at the former Buick City site in Flint.\n\nThe Old 97s 2001 album \"Satellite Rides\" features the track \"Buick City Complex\".\n\n\n"}

Their self-titled debut, \"Armageddon\", was recorded in England and released in the United States on A&M Records. The albums' original liner notes use the term \"supergroup\", as their personnel were drummer Bobby Caldwell (previously a member of Captain Beyond), singer Keith Relf (who had fronted the band Yardbirds and was a co-founder of Renaissance), guitarist Martin Pugh (from Steamhammer), and bassist Louis Cennamo (also formerly of Renaissance and Steamhammer).\n\nKeith Relf had helped with post production of the final Steamhammer LP, \"Speech\", in 1971/72. Steamhammer's dissolution took place the same year of the album's release, as they had undergone numerous personnel changes since their inception, not the least of which was the death of drummer Mick Bradley in February 1972. The remaining Steamhammer alumni, Pugh and Cennamo, shared a flat and were asked by Keith Relf to move to Los Angeles with him early in 1974 with a view of forming a new band. They set out to recruit a drummer and happened across Bobby Caldwell (who had also been suggested to the band by Aynsley Dunbar) at The Rainbow in Hollywood; they began rehearsing together in late 1974/early 1975. Cennamo's old friend, Peter Frampton, was also now in Los Angeles and helped them to make contact with his management and record label.\n\nArmageddon was managed initially by Dee Anthony (Peter Frampton, Humble Pie, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer) and later Jerry Weintraub (Frank Sinatra, Bob Dylan), but the band never toured (they played only 2 live shows during their existence: in July 1975 at the Starwood in Hollywood, CA), so it is likely they were negatively impacted by the consequent reduced exposure level and record sales.\n\nIn a 2001 interview, drummer Caldwell mentioned that the band's management became increasingly more difficult to communicate with; consequently they were not being promoted properly. Bassist Cennamo stated in liner notes of the CD re-release of the album on the Repertoire label in 1999 that Caldwell and Pugh's drug problems (heroin) had created difficulties within the band, which apparently ran at cross purposes with the fact that the record received good reviews and significant FM radio attention, and was selling reasonably well. Cennamo also states that Relf's long-time asthma problems were turning into emphysema (making it increasingly hard for Relf to draw air into his lungs to sing), and the band had dissolved many months prior to the sudden death of Keith Relf in May 1976.\n\nAfter Armageddon folded, bassist Cennamo reunited with his Renaissance bandmates under the name Illusion, and later worked with Jim McCarty in the bands Stairway and Renaissance Illusion. Drummer Caldwell returned to Captain Beyond for an album and tour. \nThere was an attempt in the 80's by Pugh and Caldwell to re-form the band, as they had secured some interest from Capitol Records — vocalist Jeff Fenholt was auditioned for the band, but was eventually found to be musically unsuitable. Further auditions did not result in an acceptable replacement, and the idea to reform was shelved.\nApart from that, guitarist Pugh appears to have retired from music after 1975, though he did emerge to play guitar on sessions alongside American rock guitarist Geoff Thorpe of Vicious Rumors in American band 7th Order on their debut CD, The Lake of Memory, released on the Big Island Sounds label in 2007.\n\n\n"}

Because some publishers have more stringent copyright restrictions (notably Reed Elsevier) than others, free online access is limited to approximately 60% of the library content. The main disadvantage of the database is that free online accessibility is not listed for each publication and will only become apparent when a click-through is attempted. In the final stage of the DARE programme an ambitious project called \"HunDAREd thousand\" was started. The aim was to upload 100,000 full-text objects into DAREnet within a year.

Nicknamed \"Il Vecchio Maestro\" (\"The Old Master,\" in Italian), he also led Italy to a gold medal at the 1936 Olympic football tournament, and managed the Italian championship squads of the 1930 and 1935 editions of the Central European International Cup.\n\nVittorio Pozzo was born in Turin on 2 March 1886, into a family originally from Ponderano. He attended the Liceo Cavour in Turin, his hometown; he later studied languages and played football in France, Switzerland and England. He studied in Manchester at the turn of the 20th century and met Manchester United half-back Charlie Roberts and Derby County's inside-left Steve Bloomer.\n\nAs a player, he played professionally in Switzerland for Grasshopper Club Zürich the 1905–06 season, before returning to Italy where he helped found Torino F.C. (then \"Foot-Ball Club Torino\"), a team with which he played for five seasons until retiring from football in 1911. He would serve as the technical director of Torino from 1912 to 1922. After completing his studies, he joined Pirelli, where he became manager, a position he would leave for the Italian national team.\n\nUntil the 1912 Summer Olympics, the Italy national team was guided by \"technical commissions\", when Pozzo was appointed as the first head coach of the national team during the first debut ever for an Italian selection in an official competition. Italy was eliminated in the first round after a 3–2 loss to Finland in extra time, on 29 June. Pozzo resigned after his third match, being defeated 5–1 by Austria in the consolation tournament, on 3 July. He returned to work at Pirelli; only to return to the national team in 1921 as part of a \"technical commission\", a committee composed of federal managers, referees, players, former players, coaches and journalists.\n\nThroughout his first term, the national team was guided by this diverse group of people. With the brief exception of Augusto Rangone (in 1925–1928) and Carlo Carcano (1928–1929), Pozzo was the only person to play the role of sole commissioner until the sixties. Pozzo would also serve with the Alpini as lieutenant during the First World War.\n\nIn 1921, Pozzo was commissioned by the Football Association to study a draft reform of the league to address the tensions between the bigger and the smaller teams, because it was thought that the number of participants in the championship had to be reduced. The mediation failed resulting in the split between the FIGC and CCI, before merging again the following year.\n\nIn 1924, for the occasion of the 1924 Summer Olympics, Pozzo was again appointed sole head coach. This time Italy were able to reach the quarter-finals, where they were defeated 2–1 by Switzerland. After this defeat, Pozzo resigned and returned to devote himself to his work and his wife, who shortly after died due to a disease. After the death of his wife, he moved to Milan, where he held his job at Pirelli, alongside his work as a journalist for \"La Stampa\" in Turin, which he continued almost until his death.\n\nPozzo returned to coach the Italy national team on a permanent basis in December 1929. Italy won the 1930 edition of the Central European International Cup, defeating Hungary 5–0 in Budapest. They pipped the title from Meisl's Austrian side, the so-called \"Wunderteam\", who went on to win the second edition of the tournament two years later.\n\nFollowing the 1930 defeat to Spain, Pozzo left Adolfo Baloncieri, who had served as Italy captain and who had been an international of ten years standing, out the team. In the 1932 edition of the Central European International Cup, Italy finished in second place behind Austria; Austria beat Italy, as did the Czechs, while a defeat to Hungary was only averted because of a missed penalty. This led to Pozzo bringing back the Bologna player Angelo Schiavio, who had been a regular goalscorer for his club, but in February 1934 with the World Cup looming Austria defeated Italy in Turin 4–2, Pozzo once again axed the team's captain, Umberto Caligaris, on this occasion.\n\nDuring the 1934 FIFA World Cup on home soil, the first tournament on the European continent, Pozzo's Italian side benefited from controversial officiating, which was thought to have been influenced by the political situation in Italy at the time; indeed, the Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini had apparently met with several officials prior to Italy's matches, including Ivan Eklind, who refereed Italy's semi-final and final victories. Eklind was later accused of favouring the Italians with his decisions. Italy's game against Spain in the quarter-finals, which ended in a 1–1 draw after extra-time, also raised questions against the performance of the referee Louis Baert in the match; in the replay, Swiss referee Rene Mercet did not escape criticism either, and was banned by the Swiss FA upon his arrival home. Both matches were played in a highly aggressive manner, with several players of both sides injured as a result of the extremely physical play: a foul on goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora for the equaliser in the first leg went unpunished, which ruled him out of the replay, while another on his replacement Joan Josep Nogués in the replay was also ignored; at least three Spaniards had to depart the field with injuries. The Italian Mario Pizziolo also suffered a broken leg at the hand of the Spaniards in the first leg, and would not play for the Italian national team again. Italy's 1–0 victory in the replay ultimately earned them a place in the semi-finals. Italy also benefited from the quarter-final draw between Hungary and Austria, which saw Austria prevail 2–1 in a highly competitive encounter. By the time of the semi-final, Johann Horvath was absent through injury, and Italy won the match over Austria by a single goal. Enrique Guaita, one of the squad's Oriundi, scored the only goal of the match from close range after Giuseppe Meazza had fallen over goalkeeper Peter Platzer. In the final on 10 June, at the Stadio Nazionale PNF in Rome, with temperatures surpassing , Italy came from behind to defeat Czechoslovakia 2–1 in extra-time to win the title. On the back of the World Cup success, Pozzo was awarded the title of \"Commendatore\" for achieving greatness in his profession.\n\nPozzo also coached Italy in the \"Battle of Highbury\" on 14 November 1934 against England, led by Arsenal's Wilf Copping at the team's home ground, which ended 3–2 in favour of England.\n\nItaly defended their Central European International Cup title in 1935 under Pozzo, going into the 1936 Summer Olympics on the back of a run which had seen them lose only to Austria and England; they went on to win the gold medal in the tournament, defeating Austria 2–1 in extra time.\n\nBy the time of the 1938 World Cup in France, Italy remained undefeated in recent competitions under Pozzo. Silvio Piola earned his first cap in 1935, scoring regularly for the national side and proving an effective partner for Meazza. In the quarter-finals against the hosts in Colombes, as both teams normally played in blue, Italy were controversially ordered to play in all-black attire (possibly by Mussolini himself), a colour which is associated with fascism, along with bearing a \"Fascio Littorio\" on the left breast, alongside the Savoy shield. Despite a hostile reception from the home crowd, Italy managed to win the match 3–1 and advance to the next round. Following the match, Pozzo learned that the Brazilians were so confident of appearing in the final in Paris that they had requisitioned the only airplane from Marseilles to Paris on the day after the semi-final against Pozzo's Italy. Pozzo went to the Brazilians that sunbathed in the Côte d'Azur and asked them to surrender him the aerial bookings in case of an Italian victory. The Brazilians apparently arrogantly answered \"it is not possible because we will go to Paris, because we will beat you in Marseilles\". They then reportedly offered Pozzo the ironic hospitality of a plane ride to Paris to see them play in the final. Pozzo reported to the Italian side what the Brazilians had told him to rouse the pride of the players. It was the psychological premise for revenge in the match, which Italy went on to win 2–1. Afterwards, the Brazilians did not want to sell their plane tickets to the Italians, who were then forced to reach Paris by train. In the resulting final, Italy duly won their second world title 4–2 against Hungary. There is a common legend that the Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini sent a telegram to the Italian team prior to the final, stating: \"Win or die!\"; however, Pietro Rava later denied this, commenting: \"No, no, no, that’s not true. He sent a telegram wishing us well, but no never 'win or die'.\" With the 1938 World Cup victory, Pozzo became the only manager to win two editions of the FIFA World Cup.\n\nBetween 1938 and 1939, Pozzo held the record for most consecutive wins for Italy, with nine, until the record was eventually broken in 2019 by Roberto Mancini. From 24 November 1935 against Hungary until 20 July 1939 against Finland, Pozzo also led Italy on a record 30-match unbeaten streak.\n\nDuring World War II, Pozzo remained in position throughout the hostilities. At the 1948 Summer Olympics, Pozzo's last match as Italy head coach came as a 5–3 defeat to Denmark in the quarter-finals at Highbury Stadium in London. Pozzo finished with a record 63 wins, 17 draws and 16 defeats from 95 matches (an additional two wins are recorded as part of a technical commission in 1921). He holds the record for the longest reign of any European men's senior national team coach.\n\nHis last, excruciating, official act, in 1949, was helping with the recognition of the torn bodies of the players of the Grande Torino team, his friends and pupils, who died on May 4 in the Superga air disaster from which he escaped himself for not being able to go with the team to Lisbon.\n\nPozzo became a journalist with \"La Stampa\" after retiring from football management, resuming a career he had worked in prior to his successes as coach of Italy. He reported on the 1950 FIFA World Cup as part of his work covering Italian national team matches. After watching Italy win the 1968 European Football Championship on home soil, the successor to the Central European International Cup title, which he had won twice with the Azzurri, Pozzo died later that year, on 21 December, at the age of 82. He is buried in the cemetery of his family's hometown, Ponderano. In 1986, the Stadio Communale di Torino was renamed after Pozzo in his honour; the stadium is now known as the Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino. In 2016, a museum featuring his memorabilia in Ponderano was inaugurated in his honour.\n\nUntil the 1930s, a common tactic in football was the so-called \"pyramid of Cambridge\", which is a 2–3–5 in the shape of inverted pyramid that had its apex in the Keeper. The design of this scheme is given to the team of the famous British university, and its launch is due to Blackburn Rovers, who applied it for the first time in the 1890s, and winning five league cups. For over 30 years this form experienced uninterrupted luck in the British Isles and, by extension, the world. In the years after World War I, by evolution, from the pyramid, two tactical systems originated simultaneously: the WM, or 'sistema', practiced by the Arsenal side of Herbert Chapman, and the 'metodo', whose fathers are commonly identified as Vittorio Pozzo and his friend and rival Hugo Meisl, who served as the manager of the Austria national football team for 25 years.\n\nPozzo and Meisl developed the idea of an array with two defenders as full-backs and a player in a central position in front of the defence, between the two half-backs, who effectively functioned as a central or defensive midfielder, who was a key component of the system; this position was known as that of the centre-half-back, or \"centromediano metodista\" in Italian, and was seen as a precursor to the \"regista\" or deep-lying playmaker role, as the \"metodista\"'s responsibilities in Pozzo's system were not entirely defensive but also creative. As such, the \"metodista\" was not solely tasked with breaking down possession, but also with starting attacking plays after winning back the ball. Compared to the sistema, the forward displacement of the central defender gave more support to the half-backs. Finally, the retreat towards the median of the two 'inside forwards' of the pyramid (also called \"mezzali,\" or \"half-wings,\" in Italian – not to be confused with wing half-backs) gave rise to a formation of the type 2–3–2–3, or \"WW\", because it repeated the form of these letters on the field. The metodo system was well–suited to highly technical teams whose strategies were predominantly based on a slower game made up of possession and lots of short passing on the ground, in contrast to the English \"sistema\", which favoured faster, more aggressive, and athletic gameplay.\n\nPozzo was also known to be a pioneer in his use of pre-tournament training camps.\n\nThe other matter that Pozzo benefited from was ‘oriundi’ (that is foreign-born Italian ‘nationals’) which permitted Italy to take advantage of those players from other countries who could claim some type of Italian ancestry. In the 1930s he was able to call on Luis Monti, a midfielder who had appeared for Argentina in their 1930 FIFA World Cup Final defeat to Uruguay, and who was an important part of the success of the Italian team in the 1934 World Cup.\n\nIn response to the criticisms surrounding his decision to call upon oriundi players in the victorious World Cup of 1934, he said: \"If they can die for Italy, they can also play for Italy\", referring to the fact that they had also served in the Italian army.\n\nHe was also a fan of Raimundo Orsi, an Argentinian from Buenos Aires after an undistinguished stint in the Argentinian shirt. Orsi, never a prolific goalscorer, would reward Pozzo's faith with a goal in the 1934 World Cup final. Not that he dispensed with home-grown talent, but his penchant for attacking play is demonstrated by the fact that as well as Schiavio, Pozzo was successful in converting Giuseppe Meazza, who was captain in 1938, from a striker into an inside forward; indeed Pozzo's reign is linked closely to the success of his strikers. In the 1938 World Cup another ‘oriundo’ was the Uruguayan Michele Andreolo.\n\nBrian Glanville has stated that Pozzo was not a fascist; he did, however, work alongside Giorgio Vaccaro during the 1934 World Cup campaign — a general from the fascist militia, who was also the head of the Italian Football Federation at the time. According to Gian Paolo Ormezzano, Pozzo was neither a fascist nor antifascist, while Giorgio Bocca considered him to be an officer of the \"Alpini\" and a reluctant fascist of the regime by association, \"...one who appreciated punctual trains, but could not stand \"squadrismi\", who paid homage to the monument dedicated to the Alpini, but not to the fascists' memorials.\" Following the Second World War, however, Pozzo was excluded from Italian football, due to being accused of co-operating with the fascist government, and of participating in the Italian Social Republic; as such, the new Turin stadium was not dedicated to him. Despite his associations with fascism, however, he was not a member of the National Fascist Party, and documents demonstrated that he collaborated with the National Liberation Committee as of September 1943.\n\nIn the 1938 edition of the FIFA World Cup took place in France, where numerous refugees who had escaped the fascist regime in Italy were strongly against the Italian national team's participation in the tournament. In the first match of the Italian national team, against the Norwegian national team, among the 22,000 spectators there were 3,000 escaped anti-fascist Italians who opposed \"Mussolini's national team,\" and jeered at them in protest. Pozzo replied to the demonstration with a memorable and highly controversial episode. During the presentation of the teams on the field, the Italian players had made the fascist salute, as it was custom for them to do at the time. As a result, they were overwhelmed by the jeers and whistles of protest from the crowd. Pozzo feared that that reception would demoralise the players. When the whistles diminished, after the players had lowered their arms, Pozzo, who was lined up with the team in the centre of the field, ordered them to perform another Roman salute. He later commented on the incident, stating: \"Having won the battle of intimidation, we played.\"\n\nPozzo ordered the players to continue with the fascist salute during the national anthem. Afterwards he declared: \"The match was immediately surrounded by polemic–political undertones. And unfairly so. Because our players don't even dream of making something political out of this, but the fascist salute is the official flag of the moment, it's a sort of ceremony and they must show allegiance to it. They represent our country, and naturally they wear its colours and insignias with dignity. [...] I have my ideas, but I know what my duty is. When we take to the field, as expected, a solemn attack of deafening hisses and insults attends us. And we don't lower the hand until the hisses are stopped. The action of intimidation has not succeeded\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1868133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868133", "title": "Valerie and Her Week of Wonders (film)", "text": "Valerie and Her Week of Wonders (film)\n\nValerie and Her Week of Wonders () is a 1970 Czechoslovak surrealist horror film directed by Jaromil Jireš and based on the 1935 novel of the same name by Vítězslav Nezval. It is considered part of the Czechoslovak New Wave movement. The film portrays the heroine as living in a disorienting dream, cajoled by priests, vampires, and men and women alike. The film blends elements of the fantasy and horror film genres.\n\nValerie, a pretty young girl, is asleep when a thief steals her earrings; as she tries to investigate, she is startled by a horrific man, the Constable, who wears a mask. The thief returns her earrings the next day, angering the Constable. Back at her house, Valerie's grandmother, Elsa, tells her that the earrings were left behind by Valerie's mother upon joining a convent. Previously, the earrings belonged to the Constable, who also owned their house. Valerie also learns that a group of missionaries and a company of actors are coming to town. During her neighbor Hedvika's wedding, Valerie sees the Constable watching her in the crowd and her grandmother also seems to recognize him. Valerie receives a letter from the thief, Orlík (\"Eaglet\"), warning her that the Constable, his uncle, killed Orlík's parents and now wants Valerie's earrings back. Orlík asks Valerie to meet him at the church that evening; when they meet he doesn't hide his attraction to her.\n\nLater, Valerie meets the Constable in the street, in disguise; he leads Valerie to a chamber where her grandmother whips herself to win back the love of a past lover, a priest named Gracián. Orlík saves Valerie and tells her that his uncle is in love with her. The Constable meets Elsa, who calls him Richard and was his lover when she was 17. He promises to make her young again if she sells him the house that Valerie will inherit. Meanwhile, Orlík gives Valerie a pearl for protection, then hides her from Richard again. At a picnic, Gracián tells Valerie that Orlík is her brother. That night, Gracián comes into her bedroom and attempts to rape her, but she swallows the pearl to protect herself. Meanwhile, Richard and Elsa sneak into Hedvika's; while Hedvika and her husband consummate their marriage, Elsa bites her on the neck, stealing the blood necessary to become young again.\n\nValerie finds Orlík bound to a waterfall by Richard. Valerie frees Orlík and takes him to her house, avoiding his romantic intentions by blindfolding him, since she now thinks they're siblings. They discover Gracián hanging dead from Valerie's window and take the body to a crypt under Valerie's house; Elsa is there, now a vampire. Disguised as a young woman, Elsa introduces herself as a distant cousin and tells Valerie that her grandmother left suddenly. She tries to bite Valerie, then restrains her while she's asleep and steals the earrings. Elsa imprisons Valerie, who then observes Elsa having sex with a man and then killing him, then attempting to seduce Orlík, who instead steals the earrings again.\n\nOrlík frees Valerie, returns her earrings, and confesses his love for her. He tries to explain that he's not her father's son, but Richard's, but Valerie runs away. She has guessed Elsa is actually her grandmother, and started to feel something for Richard, who's dying. Valerie steals a chicken from the market and takes it to Richard, who's just told Elsa that he is Valerie's father, and that Valerie's blood is the key to their survival. When Valerie heals Richard, he reverts to being a monster and attacks her. He plans to transplant Orlík's heart into Valerie to make her immortal, but Elsa wants it for herself. Valerie, pretending to be unconscious, overhears everything. She revives Gracián, who wasn't actually dead, and finds a goodbye letter from Orlík.\n\nValerie meets Hedvika, sick from Elsa's bite and depressed about her marriage. They retreat into Hedvika's bedroom and spend the night together, after which Hedvika is healed. Outside, Gracián tells a crowd that Valerie is a witch who tempted him into sin. He orders her captured and burned at the stake, but Valerie swallows the magic earrings and escapes unharmed. In the crypt, now a brothel, Valerie tricks Richard into drinking one of the earrings, turning him into a polecat. In a progressively more dreamlike sequence, Valerie reunites with Orlík, revealed to be one of the actors; then Elsa, who doesn't recall anything that's happened; then her long-lost parents. In the final scene everyone dances around Valerie in the forest, while the virgins sing for her. Eventually she falls asleep in a bed in the forest, alone.\n\n\nThe original screenplay was written by Ester Krumbachová who's also credited with production design on the movie. The movie was supposed to be directed by Krumbachová then husband Jan Němec. However, after August 1968 Němec was fired from Barrandov film studio and wasn't allowed to direct. The project then went to Jireš. The screenplay was approved in late April 1968, and despite Jireš's 1969 feature \"The Joke\" being banned by communist authorities, production proceeded on \"Valerie\". Jaroslava Schallerová was chosen from 1,500 girls who auditioned for the role.\nThe Czech town of Slavonice was chosen as the main filming location, because of its preserved renaissance-era town centre. The local people played extras. Some scenes were shot in nearby Kostelní Vydří monastery. Robert Nezval, son of the author of the novel Vítězslav Nezval, appears in the film as a boy with a drum.\n\nThe film soundtrack, featuring music composed by Luboš Fišer, was released for the first time in December 2006 by Finders Keepers Records. Available both on CD and LP, the booklet reveals previously unseen archive images, international poster designs, as well as notes by the label founder Andy Votel, a film professor Peter Hames and Trish Keenan from the band Broadcast. An alternative soundtrack was made by The Valerie Project in 2006.\n\nIn January 2004, the film was released on DVD in the United States and Canada by Facets Video. In June of that same year, the film was released on DVD in the UK by Redemption Films Ltd.. In June 2015, the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by the Criterion Collection, featuring a 4K digital restoration; three early short films by director Jireš, \"Uncle\" (1959), \"Footprints\" (1960), and \"The Hall of Lost Steps\" (1960); interviews from 2006 with Jaroslava Schallerová and Jan Klusák; and an alternate psychedelic folk soundtrack by The Valerie Project.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.8/10. \"The New York Times\" called the film \"Consistently and humorously anticlerical\", writing that it \"may be the most exotic flower to bloom on the grave of the Prague Spring, but it's one with deep roots in 20th-century Czech culture\".\n\nJordan Cronk of \"Slant Magazine\" wrote that the film \"may be a willfully enigmatic, even obtuse viewing experience, but every frame continues to vibrant with energy and thrum with life\", and gave the film a rating of three-and-a-half out of five stars.\n\nUniversity of Nebraska film studies professor Wheeler W. Dixon wrote in his book \"Visions of Paradise: Images of Eden in the Cinema\" \"The film's brevity and its seductive mise-en-scène, sumptuously photographed by Jan Cuřík, make the film seem almost an outlaw project, or an act of social criticism designed to enforce atheism by embracing an anti-Catholic stance, particularly in relation to sexual morality.\"\n\nIn the book \"101 Horror Films You Must See Before You Die\", author and professor at Brunel University Tanya Krzyminska called the film \"an exquisitely crafted fairy tale woven around the sexual awakening of a young woman\". Krzyminska also noted that, although the film shared many similarities with soft-core pornographic films of the period, \"it seeks a broader canvas in a blend of attributes drawn from both high and low culture.\" Krzyminska also noted the film's elements of gothic horror and fairy tales, as well as its use of symbolic imagery.\n\nMany writers have cited similarities between the film and the work of English writer Angela Carter, who saw the film during its release in England. Her screenplay for \"The Company of Wolves\" (1984) adapted from Carter's short stories, in collaboration with director Neil Jordan, bears a direct or indirect influence.\n\nIn 2006 members of New Weird America acts Espers, Fern Knight, Fursaxa and other musicians formed The Valerie Project. The group performed original compositions in unison with the film from 2006 to 2008.\n\n\n"}

Lewis, Geller, and Dykes soon moved to New York City, and Geller and Dykes began dating in 1997. When Geller asked Dykes to provide the vocals for an instrumental track he had written, they considered starting a band. With encouragement from Lewis, they played a live performance in Austin, Texas, at the 2000 South by Southwest festival.\n\nGeller and Dykes had decided on the name in 1999 while living in New York City. The band's debut album, \"Out of the Loop\", was released in 2001 on the Kindercore label and according to a 2002 interview with \"The Stanford Daily\", the band's name represented the dynamic of the duo's relationship: \"The two towers, equal and independent, together made up one entity and came to represent the relationship that Geller and Dykes forged professionally and personally.\" The duo's second album, \"The Tight Connection\", was also released on Kindercore in 2002.

{"id": "1868139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868139", "title": "Columbia Island (District of Columbia)", "text": "Columbia Island (District of Columbia)\n\nColumbia Island is an island located in the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., in the United States. It formed naturally as an extension of Analostan Island in the latter part of the 1800s, and over time erosion and flooding severed it from Analostan. The U.S. federal government deposited material dredged from the Potomac River on the island between 1911 and 1922, and again from 1925 to 1927. The island was also reshaped by the government at this time. It received the name \"Columbia Island\" about 1918. In 1968, the island was renamed Lady Bird Johnson Park. Located within the park are the Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove, Navy – Merchant Marine Memorial, and the Columbia Island Marina. The island, park, memorials, and marina are part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway and administered by the National Park Service.\n\nColumbia Island is in part natural, and in part man-made. Columbia Island did not exist in 1818 and at that time, Analostan Island (now known as Theodore Roosevelt Island) was largely rock and quite close to the D.C. shoreline. Due to deforestation and increased agricultural use upstream, the river eroded much of the northern bank and widened the gap between Analostan Island and the shore and simultaneously large deposits of silt built up around Analostan Island. By 1838, Analostan had almost doubled in length toward the south and by 1884, the new southern part of Analostan Island was defined and built up, and supported a well-established wetland. However, the river gradually eroded the center of Analostan Island, severing Columbia Island from its parent body.\n\nBetween 1911 and 1922, the Potomac River was repeatedly dredged to deepen the channel and to widen the distance between Analostan/Theodore Roosevelt Island and Columbia Island (so that the \"Virginia Channel\" west of Analostan/Roosevelt Island would not flood easily). Dredged material was piled high on Columbia Island, helping to build it higher, lengthen and broaden it, and give it its current shape. Filling in of the island was complete in the spring of 1924.\n\nThe new island received its name in about 1918 from an unnamed engineer working for the District of Columbia and the first use of this name in \"The Washington Post\" was in April 1922, the same year it was transferred to the National Park Service.\n\nIn 1922, Congress authorized the Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission (AMBC) to hold a design competition for the proposed Arlington Memorial Bridge. It awarded the design commission to the firm if McKim, Mead and White, which appointed architect William Mitchell Kendall to be the lead designer. Congress subsequently authorized construction of Kendall's bridge on February 24, 1925. The legislation authorizing construction of the bridge also provided for the construction of approaches (on-ramps, off-ramps, and pedestrian areas) on both the D.C. and Virginia ends of the bridge; for the improvement of B Street NW as a new ceremonial avenue to link to the bridge; and for the construction of a roadway (eventually called Memorial Drive) between the bridge and the main gate of Arlington National Cemetery as well as a new ceremonial entrance at this gate (subsequently known as the Hemicycle).\n\nPreliminary designs for the bridge showed it terminating on Columbia Island, which necessitated expansion of Columbia Island. The United States Army Corps of Engineers already planned to dredge the Potomac River and enlarge Columbia Island, so on April 1, Secretary of War John W. Weeks ordered the expenditure of $114,500 to dredge the river between the Highway Bridge and the Lincoln memorial. The dredged material was to be dumped on Columbia Island. To ensure the island could support the bridge, the Corps also planned to construct a levee around the island.\n\nThe Corps reached an agreement with the AMBC in April 1925 to jointly share the cost of dredging, which involved the removal of of river bottom, and the construction of of seawall and of levee. About of Columbia Island was to be removed in order to widen the main Potomac River channel, and the height of the island raised from above average water level to over two years.\n\nIn addition to the ABMC and Corps of Engineers, the United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) and the National Capital Parks Commission (NCPC) both had authority to approve aspects of the bridge. The CFA had extensive authority to review the look of the bridge.\n\nThe CFA and NCPC first discussed the bridge approaches in January 1926, when they met jointly to discuss how the Virginia terminus would serve as a gateway to Washington. The two bodies agreed to a proposal by urban planner C.A.S. Sinclair, who proposed a series of roads radiating outward from the Virginia end of the bridge. However, in December 1926, the CFA learned that Arlington National Cemetery was likely to expand eastward onto the property of the USDA Experimental Farm (which lay east of Arlington Ridge Road). Because this significantly impacted the approaches to the bridge, the CFA asked Kendall to restudy Sinclair's proposal for the Columbia Island terminus. Kendall presented the revised design for the street and highway approaches for the Virginia landing in May 1927. His plan was for a series of traffic circles on Columbia Island.\n\nBy June 30, 1927, dredging of the Potomac River was nearly complete. The reshaping of Columbia Island was finished, and the island had risen to feet above water. The following month, work began on the engineering and architectural drawings for the Boundary Channel Bridge. This bridge would cross Boundary Channel (which separated Columbia Island from Virginia) to connect Arlington Memorial Bridge with the planned Memorial Drive.\n\nKendall's May 1927 design for Columbia Island generated lengthy debate for two years. Architect Milton Bennett Medary (who left the CFA in 1927) wrote to the Commission of Fine Arts in January 1928 after having seen Kendall's proposal. Medary argued that the National Mall ended with the Lincoln Memorial and the two great roads leading from it – the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway (RCPP) and the Arlington Memorial Bridge. Columbia Island, he said, should reflect a simple, formal dignity that helps ease the transition from the Neoclassical mall and bridge to the informal landscaping of Arlington National Cemetery. Medary's argument proved persuasive to the CFA, and in late May the commission and Kendall announced a revised treatment in which a great plaza would be built on Columbia Island. From this plaza, roads would lead across the island to bridges which would connect with the proposed Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway and Lee Highway. The traffic circles were eliminated, and Columbia Island would be reshaped to allow for the north-south roadway to pass along the axis of the island. The great plaza was intended to contain two high columns representing the Union and the South. The two columns were to be surmounted by gold statues of Nike. Additionally, the CFA concluded that there should be two high pylons at both the eastern and western ends of the bridge. These pylons were to be inscribed with bas-relief images representing national accomplishments, and topped by statues of golden eagles. Kendall's design also included two large, round Greek Revival temples close to the bridge on the island's east side, and several larger-than-life Greek Revival and Romanesque Revival statues scattered about the island.\n\nBids for the construction of the Boundary Channel Bridge were opened on July 18, 1928. The project was divided among several contractors. North Carolina Granite Co. provided the below-water granite, Hallowell Granite Works provided the granite for the voussoirs and the facing on the piers above mean low water level. The Woodbury Granite Co. provided the coping granite and balustrades. Hallowell delivered its granite in May 1929, North Carolina Granite delivered its by June, and Woodbury Granite delivered roughly half its granite by June 30, 1929. The construction contract itself was awarded to the N.P. Severin Company in October 1928.\n\nNearly a year passed before the CFA approved pylon designs for Columbia Island in March 1929. But the great plaza and roads on the island needed further study.\n\nWork on the Boundary Channel Bridge began in the spring of 1929, but immediately ran into problems. An unstable rock shelf thick lay under the western abutment of the Arlington Memorial Bridge. This \"rotten rock\" had not been revealed by borings two years earlier, but now came to light as construction began on the Boundary Channel Bridge. Additionally, a thin layer of sand and gravel was discovered lying atop the bedrock of the eastern abutment of the Boundary Channel Bridge. Both obstacles had to be removed before construction could proceed further. By June 30, 1929, the Arlington Memorial Bridge's western abutment was finished (except for exterior masonry facing), and many of the concrete columns for the Boundary Channel Bridge were also finished.\n\nBy the end of June 1930, some additional filling in of Columbia Island was all that was needed to finish the Arlington Memorial Bridge. But no construction had occurred on the Columbia Island great plaza, its monumental columns, or the two pylons as the CFA had still not approved a final design for these. Additionally, work on the western half of the Boundary Channel Bridge had come to a standstill. Tracks of the Rosslyn Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad ran along the Virginia shoreline. In order to avoid an at-grade crossing with Memorial Drive, the CFA proposed in June 1927 that these tracks be lower by . Since meant extending the Boundary Channel Bridge, new engineering studies of the bridge were needed. The Corps and CFA were still studying how to depress the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks three years later. Informal negotiations had, by the end of June 1930, come to an agreement that the line would be moved closer to the river, and that an underpass through the bridge (accommodating two side-by-side tracks) and the depressed tracks should be constructed first before the railroad took title to the new line. This would permit uninterrupted rail service. The Pennsylvania Railroad also agreed to cede the old right-of-way to the government once the new tracks and tunnel were operational. Otherwise, construction on the Boundary Channel Bridge was complete.\n\nThe CFA again considered designs for the Columbia Island plaza in July 1930. Repairs to the levees on Columbia Island were made that same month. In September, the CFA reviewed but did not approve designs for the memorial columns, and for additional landscaping on the island. CFA members began to question whether the columns were effective in memorializing the reunited North and South, although there was still agreement that they were integral to the great plaza's design. Nonetheless, Kendall was asked to restudy the issue yet again. Additionally, by now the Great Depression was having a severe and negative impact on funding for the entire Arlington Memorial Bridge project. With the bridge and its connection to Arlington National Cemetery essentially finished, Congress hesitated to provide funds for Columbia Island. To cut costs, the CFA deleted the Green Revival temples and the many statues scheduled for Columbia Island. Rather than building extensive roads north and south on the island when no connections were ready to be made, the CFA also agreed that only short segments of these avenues be built adjacent to the great plaza. Eliminating the statuary on the island and on the Boundary Channel Bridge saved $478,000.\n\nDue to settling, additional dredged material was deposited on Columbia Island in October and November 1930. The new goal was to raise the island to above the average water level.\n\nThere were still problems in designing the final segment of Boundary Channel Bridge in November 1930, but the road across Columbia Island connecting Arlington Memorial Bridge with Boundary Channel Bridge was finished in December.\n\nThe CFA continued to wrestle with Columbia Island's great plaza design in 1931. The commission again discussed the columns in January, and eliminated a granite balustrade around the great plaza (saving $400,000). But by September, the agency still had come to no resolution on redesigning the plaza.\n\nDesign issues surrounding the Columbia Island great plaza were resolved in late 1931 not by the CFA, but by President Herbert Hoover. Two airfields, Hoover Field and Washington Airport, existed in Virginia just south of Columbia Island. In the spring of 1931, AMBC executive officer Ulysses S. Grant III (then a Lieutenant Colonel with the Corps of Engineers) advised the AMBC and CFA that the huge memorial columns planned for Columbia Island would be a risk to aviation. Both bodies ignored him.\n\nOn September 28, 1931, the United States Department of Commerce told the CFA that the tall columns were a risk to aviation. The Commerce Department said that the columns would seriously interfere with air traffic using Hoover Field, and demanded that the CFA either eliminate the columns or floodlight them brightly. The Washington Board of Trade added its opposition to the columns on September 29. Grant agreed that, should an investigation show a hazard, the columns would have to be eliminated. The CFA agreed that street lights should be placed alongside the roads on Columbia Island both as an aid to vehicular traffic and as a means of warning air traffic. But the CFA was adamantly opposed to floodlighting the memorial columns, for they would compete with the softer lighting illuminating the Lincoln Memorial and Arlington House in Arlington National Cemetery. William Kendall, however, was so adamant about retaining the memorial columns that he personally wrote President Hoover (who technically chaired the AMBC) in early October 1931 outlining his reasons for keeping the columns and telling Hoover to move the airport if they interfered with flight.\n\nOn October 12, Hoover ordered AMBC staff, Kendall, the CFA, and Arlington Memorial Bridge consulting engineer W. J. Douglas to restudy the columns. The \"Washington Post\" reported that several AMBC and CFA members, as well as member of Congress, were increasingly worried as well about the huge cost of the columns. The columns themselves were estimated to cost at least $500,000, with another $100,000 needed for their foundations. The CFA took up the issue at its regular meeting in early November. But when CFA members expressed skepticism about the issue, Senator Hiram Bingham (an aviation enthusiast) began organizing aviation interests to oppose them. Bingham also threatened to introduce legislation in Congress to bar any aviation hazards from being erected in the D.C. area. On November 27, 40 postal and air transport pilots wrote to President Hoover demanding that the pillars be eliminated. Three days later, the Board of Trade also contacted Hoover directly to lobby against the columns' erection.\n\nFaced with overwhelming opposition, the AMBC voted to eliminate the columns in December 1931, and asked Kendall for yet another new design for Columbia Island. In the wake of the AMBC's decision, proposals came from the public and architects outside the project to add either high-spouting fountains or towers which would retract whenever planes took off from the airports. But no decision was made.\n\nBy April 1932, work was well under way on relocating the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks. The new, slightly shifted route had been graded, tracks laid, and the western end of Boundary Channel Bridge designed. While there were some delays in completing the railroad underpass, work was well advanced. The formal dedication of the Hemicycle, Memorial Avenue, and Boundary Channel Bridge occurred on April 9. Colonel Ulysses S. Grant III, executive director of the Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission and an officer in the Corps of Engineers, formally opened Memorial Avenue and the Boundary Channel Bridge. (Memorial Avenue was only wide and unpaved, but the Corps was working to have it widened to and have it paved by July 1.)\n\nThe worsening federal budgetary situation nearly led to a complete halt in Columbia Island's development. On April 7, 1932, the House of Representatives deleted the project's entire $840,000 budget for fiscal year 1933 (which began July 1, 1932). Design and other work on the great plaza came to an immediate halt. So did the Corps' final push to fill in the island, as well as all landscaping and road grading. The CFA met in November 1932 to discuss how the incomplete work might be fixed to appear complete or become functional.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt took office as President of the United States in March 1933. Convinced that massive federal spending on public works was essential not only to \"prime the pump\" of the economy but also to cut unemployment, Roosevelt proposed passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act. The act contained $6 billion in public works spending. The act passed on June 13, 1933, and Roosevelt signed it into law on June 16. The Public Works Administration (PWA) was immediately established to disburse the funds appropriated by the act.\n\nOn July 13, just a month after the PWA was formed, the agency announced a $3 million grant to finish work on Columbia Island and other parts of the Arlington Memorial Bridge project. The CFA and NCPC met in November to decide how to proceed on Columbia Island, which had only one link to Virginia — and that led only to Arlington National Cemetery. On December 4, the agencies announced that PWA money would be used to construct bridges on the north and south ends of the island in anticipation of links with Lee Highway and a new highway the state of Virginia and Arlington County were discussing constructing in the south. (The southern bridge carrying the parkway became known as the Humpback Bridge because it had a slight rise in its center.) To connect to these bridges, completion of the roads on Columbia Island was also needed. These roads were staked out in January 1934, and the CFA and NCPC began discussing whether a new, large traffic circle should be added to the center of the island to replace the bottleneck that a simple cross-axis would be. The engineering and architectural design for the northern bridge was approved in October 1936.\n\nThe CFA further discussed what to do with the Columbia Island great plaza in January 1935, but again could come to no decision. Without funds, little action other than bridge construction or marginal improvements could be made. Improved landscaping designs for the Boundary Channel Bridge were also submitted in January 1935, and approved in March 1936. Seven months later, the CFA began studying the design for the lighting scheme for the Arlington Memorial Bridge, Columbia Island, and Memorial Drive.\n\nMinor elements of Columbia Island were completed in the last years of the 1930s. A second northern bridge, designed to link with Lee Boulevard (now known as Arlington Boulevard) was approved in 1937. The Joseph A. LaVezza & Sons construction company immediately began work on the $24,875 bridge. This new bridge, and (at last) the bridge over the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks were completed in July. Although the CFA continued to confer on plans concerning the great plaza as late as January 1938, no improvements were made. Memorial Avenue was completed in September 1938.\n\nThe final elements on Columbia Island were constructed in 1939 and 1940. In April 1939, Congress approved $100,000 to build the last connections between the bridges and central traffic circle on the island, as well as build sidewalks, trails, and parking lots and to improve landscaping there. The CFA, after four years of deliberation, finally approved the lamppost design for the island in January 1940. The last major improvement to the island came in September 1940, when a \"racetrack\" feature – a larger outer traffic circle – was constructed to handle the rapidly increasing north-south traffic on the island. This permitted north-south motorists to avoid the bottleneck at the traffic circle (which now largely handled just east-west traffic).\n\nWith filling operations on Columbia Island suspended in 1932, the island underwent a natural process of settling. By 1941, settling had damaged the abutments of the Boundary Channel Bridge, and the Bureau of Public Roads placed steel struts under each abutment in April to shore them up.\n\nBridge work on Columbia Island continued in the 1940s. In January 1942, the United States Department of Defense realized that rapid expansion of the Pentagon workforce due to entry of the United States into World War II would put significant strain on the local road networks. A new arterial, Army-Navy Boulevard (now called Army-Navy Drive) was under construction to connect Pentagon City and points south to the Pentagon. The road then continued northwest past the Pentagon to Columbia Island, where it was to run up the center of the island and connect with the Arlington Memorial Bridge. A bridge carrying Army-Navy Boulevard over the Boundary Channel was approved in January 1942. In 1948, the northwesterly bridge connecting Columbia Island to Lee Boulevard (now Arlington Boulevard) was rebuilt.\n\nAnother bridge linking Columbia Island and Virginia was proposed in 1958. At that time, one possible route for the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge was south of Little Island (the southern tip of Theodore Roosevelt Island which had become detached from the main island due to erosion). District of Columbia officials asked permission in January 1958 to build a small approach bridge to the Roosevelt span over Boundary Channel, but the CFA refused a month later. By June 1958, the bridge's location had shifted north to the southern end of Theodore Roosevelt Island, making a bridge over Boundary Channel moot.\n\nIn 1958, the northwestern bridge linking Columbia Island to Arlington Boulevard (the former Lee Boulevard) was widened to six lanes from four. The northern bridge carrying the George Washington Memorial Parkway over Boundary Channel was realigned in late 1962 as part of a larger road realignment allowing Arlington Boulevard to link to the new Theodore Roosevelt Bridge. A traffic light, the only one anywhere on the parkway, was installed to control traffic during the realignment process. The new bridge was finished and the light removed in September 1964.\n\nA year later, in September 1965, a new bridge just west of the South Washington Boulevard bridge opened. The George Washington Memorial Parkway was expanding north of its old terminus at Arlington Memorial Bridge, but this necessitated moving the parkway's southbound lanes onto the Virginia shoreline and off the northern part of Columbia Island. The new bridge connected the new parkway alignment with the old.\n\nDuring the latter part of the 1960s and the early part of the 1970s, the National Park Service relandscaped Columbia Island extensively. Part of the effort consisted of the construction of a footbridge over the Boundary Channel to connect a new, 30-car parking lot in the north Pentagon parking area to Columbia Island. The cost of the footbridge and parking lot was $500,000.\n\nIn spring 1987, the National Park Service repaved the South Washington Boulevard bridge to Columbia Island, and began planning to reconstruct the bridge by 1991.\n\nReconstruction of the Humpback Bridge began in January 2008. The bridge, which had not been renovated since its construction, now carried 75,000 vehicles a day – far more than it was designed for. Improvements included widening the bridge, adding balustrades to separate the sidewalks from the vehicular traffic lanes, and building an underpass through the Columbia Island side landing to allow pedestrians and cyclists to pass through the bridge rather than crossing the parkway. The reconstruction also removed the notorious \"hump\" in the middle of the bridge. However, the masonry facing of the bridge was retained to protect the historic character of the bridge. The bridge reconstruction was complete in 2011, and the bike/pedestrian underpass opened in November. The underpass connected the Columbia Island Marina and the LBJ Memorial Grove with the Mt. Vernon Trail.\n\nA children's garden was constructed on Columbia Island in spring 2008.\n\nVeterans of the United States Navy and the United States Merchant Marine had long argued that there was no memorial commemorating their service anywhere in Washington, D.C. Congress rectified this in the 1920s, and a memorial designed by 1922. However, fund-raising for the memorial took far longer than expected. Ground on Columbia Island for the memorial was broken by Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis Adams, Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon, Marine Corps Major General Ben H. Fuller, Coast Guard Commandant Rear Admiral Frederick C. Billard, and Assistant Secretary of Commerce David Sinton Ingalls on December 2, 1930.\n\nWork on the memorial stopped for nearly three years. The statue itself was finally emplaced in 1934. However, lack of funds meant that instead of a wavy green granite base, the statue stood atop a concrete plinth. In May 1934, the commission overseeing the memorial's construction asked the Works Progress Administration for a $100,000 grant to complete the granite steps. But no funds were forthcoming. Finally, funding for the memorial's completion began moving through Congress. With congressional support, the Works Progress Administration gave $39,000 to finish memorial in 1939. This included adding the wavy green granite steps, creating a concrete plaza around the memorial, installing two flagstone walks to lead to the memorial, and landscaping the area.\n\nColumbia Island was renamed Lady Bird Johnson Park by the United States Department of the Interior on November 12, 1968. The renaming honored Lady Bird Johnson, then–First Lady (November 22, 1963 – January 20, 1969), who sponsored a nationwide, urban-beautification campaign between 1964 and 1968. When the island was renamed, it also received extensive new plantings. More than one million daffodils and 2,700 dogwood trees were planted on the park between 1965 and 1968. These plants were paid for by the National Park Service, Society for a More Beautiful National Capital, and the 1965 Inaugural Committee.\n\nFormer President Lyndon B. Johnson died on January 22, 1973. Soon after, Johnson's admirers proposed constructing a statue in Washington, D.C., in his memory, but concern that it would be defaced led to rejection of that idea. Brooke Astor and Laurence Vanderbilt suggested a grove of trees instead, and planning for the $2 million grove began in spring 1973. Lady Bird Johnson Park was chosen as the site of the grove due to Johnson's love of the park while he was president. On December 28, 1973, Congress authorized a memorial grove dedicated to Johnson for placement on Columbia Island.\n\nBy February 1975, $1.3 million for the memorial grove had been raised. A $15 silver medal and a $350 gold medal were designed in early 1975 and sold to help raise another $150,000. Plans for the grove were largely complete by May 1975. Landscape architect Meade Palmer designed the grove, which included a contemplative meadow and a small granite plaza among some trees. The grove covered , and would be planted with white pine, dogwood trees, and flowering shrubs and bushes. A granite plaza was intended for the center of the grove, on which a , high pink granite orthostat (or \"standing stone\") quarried in Texas was to be placed. Stone carver Harold Vogel worked the exterior of the stone to give it a dynamic, rough-hewn look reminiscent of Johnson's personality. The Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas estimated the rock's age at a billion years. A flagstone walkway winding through the grove was included in the design. Four quotes from Johnson's public speeches, selected by Lady Bird Johnson, were carved into flagstones placed around the orthostat. But $600,000 was still needed in May 1975 to complete the memorial.\n\nThe orthostat was delivered to the site in August 1974, and emplaced on August 13, 1975. In December 1975, Congress authorized $1 million to complete the memorial grove and establish a maintenance fund.\n\nThe memorial was dedicated on April 6, 1976.\n\nThe Boundary Channel of the Potomac River separates Columbia Island from the Virginia shoreline, while the main stream of the Potomac surrounds the island on the other three sides. As of 2007, the island consisted of of landscaped parkland. Located within the park are the Lyndon B. Johnson Memorial Grove, the Navy–Merchant Marine Memorial, and the Columbia Island Marina.\n\nColumbia Island is accessible from downtown Washington via the Arlington Memorial Bridge, from Arlington National Cemetery via Memorial Drive, and from Northern Virginia via the George Washington Memorial Parkway. The Mount Vernon Trail runs along the side of the island facing the rest of the District, leading to Theodore Roosevelt Island in one direction and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on the other. The Pentagon is visible from the western side of the island near the marina at the southern tip.\n\nColumbia Island is a popular location which authors like to include in their fiction novels. It is mentioned in Anthony S. Policastro's \"Dark End of the Spectrum\", S.R. Larson's \"America Occupied\", Allan Leverone's \"Final Vector\", and Mary Eason's \"Killer Moves\".\n\nSean Flannery has mentioned the Columbia Island Marina and the Boundary Channel in his novel \"Moving Targets\", as did Kim Stanley Robinson in his \"Forty Signs of Rain\".

It was released for Microsoft Windows on November 19, 2007, for the PlayStation 3 on December 11, 2007, and for the Xbox 360 on July 3, 2008. \"Unreal Tournament 3\" is the fourth game in the \"Unreal Tournament\" series and the eighth \"Unreal\" game.\n\nSimilar to its predecessors, the game is primarily an online multiplayer title offering several game modes. There are eight modes, including Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, as well as modes like Duel, Warfare, Betrayal and Greed. In vehicle maps, the player is equipped with a hover board, which allows players to quickly traverse large maps and grapple onto other teammates' vehicles. Unlike its predecessors, \"Unreal Tournament 3\" single-player campaign does not follow a plot based around the Tournament Grand Championship, and it centers on a Necris attack that occurs on a colony on an unknown planet, releasing armed Kralls, a warlike race of aliens, on the humans.\n\nOriginally announced as \"Unreal Tournament 2007\" in 2005, and set to be released in 2006, the game was delayed to 2007. It was renamed as \"Unreal Tournament 3\" as the team considered it the third generation of \"Unreal\" game since it utilizes Unreal Engine 3. OS X and Linux ports were planned but they were eventually cancelled. The game received positive reviews from critics, and sold more than 1 million copies worldwide.\n\nSimilar to the prior entries of the series, the game is primarily an online multiplayer title offering several game modes, including large-scale Warfare, Capture the Flag, and Deathmatch. It also includes an extensive offline multiplayer game with an in-depth story, beginning with a simple tournament ladder and including team members with unique personalities. The following game modes are included:\n\nModes not returning from the prior \"Unreal Tournament\" games include Invasion, Mutant (having been later on partially replaced by the Titan mutator in the \"UT3 Titan Pack\"), Onslaught (replaced by Warfare), Bombing Run, Last Man Standing, Domination, and Double Domination. Assault was removed from the game during production.\n\nIn this installment of \"Unreal Tournament\", the vehicles are split into two factions, the Axon vehicles and Necris vehicles. The Axon vehicles are the same vehicles from \"Unreal Tournament 2004\", but several have significant game play changes. In addition, on vehicle maps every player is equipped with a personal hover board, a skateboard-like device that allows players to quickly traverse large maps and grapple onto other teammates' vehicles. The hover board is very vulnerable to attack, and any hit will knock the player off the board and disable him or her for several seconds, leaving the player exposed and vulnerable. The player cannot use any weapons while on the board.\n\nUnlike the prior \"Unreal Tournament\" games, the single-player campaign does not follow a plot based around the Tournament Grand Championship, and therefore several of the teams within \"Unreal Tournament 3\" are not Tournament competitors. The five playable factions are: Iron Guard, a team of human mercenaries led by former Tournament champion Malcolm; the Ronin, a band of four survivors of a Skaarj attack on a human colony; Liandri, a series of advanced humanoid robots custom-built or retrofitted for combat; the Krall, a warlike race of aliens formerly under the leadership of the Skaarj, returning from their initial appearance in the original \"Unreal\"; and the Necris, warriors who have undergone the process of the same name, making them stronger at the expense of replacing their biological processes with \"Nanoblack\", effectively turning them into undead soldiers (hence the name, Necris). In the Campaign, players control members of the Ronin, and the Necris serve as the chief antagonists.\n\nIn the game's story a Necris attack occurs on a colony on unknown planet, releasing armed Krall on the humans. The colony is defenseless, but a group of Ronins arrives on the scene, defending the survivors. Reaper, the group's leader, advises his second-in-command warrior Othello and his sister Jester to destroy the orbital Necris blockade with a fighter, and orders team's sniper expert, Bishop, to provide cover as he swarms to save the colony. Suddenly, he is caught in the explosion of an incoming rocket missile and passes out, but not before seeing an unknown Necris woman shooting a soldier next to him. Reaper is rescued by Othello and Jester and wakes up in the base of the Izanagi, a guerrilla force that fights against Necris and Axon, and he meets with the leader, revealed to be Malcolm, who also leads the Iron Guard as the Izanagi's army. He explains that the Necris attack was masterminded by Liandri, who also turn some of the Krall, into Necris, controlled undead soldiers. The unknown woman who Reaper saw turns out to be Akasha, the Necris operative who destroyed the colony and also leads the Necris forces. Reaper wants to kill her, but Malcolm tells him that he needs to prove himself first.\n\nThe game was announced on May 9, 2005 as \"Unreal Tournament 2007\" for a 2006 release. In August 2006, the game was delayed until the first half of 2007. In January 2007, the game was renamed to \"Unreal Tournament 3\". The original \"Unreal Tournament\" uses the first Unreal Engine, while \"UT2003\" and \"UT2004\" use Unreal Engine 2. Since \"2004\" incorporates all of the content from \"2003\", they are regarded as part of the same generation. \"UT3\" is the third generation, as it runs on Unreal Engine 3 and does not reuse any content.\n\nA limited collector's edition of the game features an exclusive collector's edition tin and a hardcover art book. A bonus DVD is also included, featuring more than twenty hours of Unreal Engine 3 tool kit video tutorials, the history of the \"Unreal Tournament\" series, and behind-the-scenes footage of the making of \"Unreal Tournament 3\". The \"Limited Collector's Edition\" was sold in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, South Africa, Australia and most other territories.\n\nThe PlayStation 3 version supports community-made mods that can be uploaded and downloaded to the PS3's HDD or external media, as well as mouse and keyboard inputs. The 1.1 patch was released on March 21, 2008. It adds the ability for players using the North American and European versions to play together, fixes problems with some USB headsets, and displays the lowest pinging servers at the top of the server list. Some updates are only applied on the North American version, since the PAL version released in March 2008 was already partially updated. The 2.0 patch was released on March 5, 2009, and adds better PC mod support, split screen, smarter AI, forty-eight attainable Trophies, server-side improvements, an improved map vote, local multiplayer, and a new user interface. Online and LAN multiplayer for this version was terminated on July 2014, following the shutdown of all GameSpy servers.\n\nUpon release, the Xbox 360 version had five exclusive maps, two exclusive characters, a two-player split screen mode, and all the downloadable content released by Epic already on the disc. With the release of the PS3 and PC \"Titan Upgrade\" patch on March 5, these versions offered the formerly exclusive Xbox 360 content, as well as other content. The Xbox 360 version does not support user-generated mods, as additional content has to be verified by Microsoft before being released. It is the only version to support controllers only.\n\nThe Linux and Mac OS X versions of the game were planned to be released as downloadable installers that work with the retail disc. Ryan C. Gordon has uploaded screenshots of the game, dating from September 2008, running on both platforms. On May 22, 2009, Ryan stated that the UT3 port for Linux was still in process. On December 16, 2010, Steve Polge announced that the Linux port would never be released, making it the first \"Unreal Tournament\" game not to be released on Linux.\n\n\"Unreal Tournament 3: The Soundtrack\" is primarily based on the original \"Unreal Tournament\" score, which was composed by Straylight Productions and Michiel van den Bos. Jesper Kyd and Rom Di Prisco remixed many of UT99's tracks and composed several other original tracks, which were released on November 20, 2007 by Sumthing Else. Sandhya Sanjana was featured as a guest vocalist. Kevin Riepl did also contribute in music production for the game, scoring the cutscenes as well as a few in-game music tracks.\n\nOn March 5, 2009, a free update titled \"Titan Pack\" was released for the PC; the PS3 version of the pack was released on March 19, 2009. The pack includes five maps and two characters that were formerly exclusive to the Xbox 360 version, along with eleven brand-new maps, two new game modes (\"Greed\" and \"Betrayal\"), and the \"Titan Mutator\". The Titan Mutator causes a player to grow in size as they do better, while carrying alternative weapons and power-ups. The expansion also includes a new power-up, a new vehicle, two new deployables, and the addition of stinger turrets. A new patch was also released in conjunction with the \"Titan Pack\", which allowed for various AI improvements (especially in vehicle modes), networking performance upgrades and added support for Steam Achievements (PC) and Trophies (PS3). It also adds a two-player split screen mode (formerly exclusive to the 360 version) and mod browsing for the PS3 version.\n\nThe \"Black Edition\" is a complete \"Unreal Tournament 3\" package—included is the complete \"UT3\" (with patch 2.0) as well as the \"Titan Pack\". The \"Titan Pack\" gives players a substantial amount of enhanced features and new content, including many original environments, new gametypes, the namesake Titan mutator, powerful deployables and weapons, new characters, and the Stealthbender vehicle.\n\n\"Unreal Tournament 3\" received positive reviews from critics. \"Xbox Magazine\" rated it 8.5 out of 10. \"\" gave it 5 stars out of 5 in its February 2008 issue and stated, \"\"UT3\" looks great, but it's every bit the stunner under the surface\". In March 2008, Midway announced that \"UT3\" had sold over a million copies worldwide.\n\n"}

It was established in 1990 after the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 was passed.\n\nThe mission of the program is \"to enhance and coordinate America's drug-control efforts among local, state and federal law enforcement agencies in order to eliminate or reduce drug trafficking and its harmful consequences in critical regions of the United States.\"\n\nThe term HIDTA also refers to each geographic location, usually a major city, county, or border crossing, in which the program has established a headquarters. These headquarters are placed in locations considered to be major drug trafficking zones. The five HIDTA offices along the United States–Mexico border are grouped into a single \"Southwest Border HIDTA\" unit. Twenty eight HIDTAs have been designated since the program began.\n\nEach HIDTA is governed by a HIDTA Executive Board which includes representatives of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies in the area of the HIDTA. By law, each HIDTA Board is equally divided between federal law enforcement on the one side and state and local agencies on the other.\n\nIn popular culture, HIDTA was featured in an episode of \"Law & Order\" entitled \"Locomotion\". It aired in the show's 15th year (2004–2005 season). The two primary homicide detectives visited the HIDTA Branch in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.\n\nAlso, during episode 2 of the first season of \"True Detective\" the audience learns of Rustin Cohle's previous law enforcement history, including participation in the HIDTA program including detailing the effects and consequences of participating in such programs.\n\n"}

Dick, first published in 1963 in \"Amazing\" magazine.\n\nIn this story, survivors of a global thermonuclear war live in isolated enclaves in California, surviving off what they can scrounge from the wastes and supplies delivered from Mars. The older generation spend their leisure time playing with the eponymous doll in an escapist role-playing game that recalls life before the apocalypse — a way of life that is being quickly forgotten. At the story's climax, a couple from one isolated outpost of humanity play a game against dwellers of another outpost (who play the game with a doll similar to Perky Pat dubbed \"Connie Companion\") in deadly earnest. The survivors' shared enthusiasm for the Perky Pat doll and the creation of her accessories from vital supplies is a sort of mass delusion that prevents meaningful re-building of the shattered society. In stark contrast, the children of the survivors show absolutely no interest in the delusion and have begun adapting to their new life.\n\nDavid Cronenberg's 1999 film \"eXistenZ\", which involves a virtual reality game that blurs reality and fantasy, visually refers to the Dick short story when its two stars, Jude Law and Jennifer Jason Leigh, consume fast food from containers marked \"Perky Pat's\".\n\nIn the movie \"Screamers\", Peter Weller's character refers to someone sarcastically as a real \"Perky Pat\".\n\nElements of the story were later incorporated into Dick's novel \"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\", written in 1964 and published in 1965, in which a Perky Pat simulation game is induced by drugs and miniature models.\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman and left fielder from through , most notably as a member of the Baltimore Orioles dynasty that won four American League pennants and two World Series championships between 1966 and 1971. The four-time All-Star led the American League in 1964 with a .606 slugging percentage and won the American League Most Valuable Player Award in 1970. He also played for the Cleveland Indians and the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 1979, Powell was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame.\n\nPowell was born in Lakeland, Florida; he played for that city's team in the 1954 Little League World Series. After his family moved to Key West when he was 15, Powell played at Key West High School and graduated in 1959. He joined the Orioles after leading the International League in home runs at Rochester in . Powell spent his first three seasons in Baltimore as a slow-footed left fielder before switching to first base in . At the plate he was an immediate success, hitting 25 home runs in ; in he led the American League in slugging percentage (.606) while blasting a career-high 39 home runs, despite missing several weeks because of a broken wrist. Powell slumped to .248 with 17 home runs in 1965, then won the American League Comeback player of the Year honors in (.287, 34 home runs, 109 runs batted in) while being hampered by a broken finger.\n\nPowell received the nickname “Boog” from his father. As Powell explained, “In the South they call little kids who are often getting into mischief buggers, and my dad shortened it to Boog.”\n\nIn 1966, Powell, along with Frank Robinson and Brooks Robinson, led the Orioles to the World Series, where they surprised the baseball world by sweeping the Los Angeles Dodgers in four games to become baseball's world champions.\n\nBefore the 1968 season, Powell lamented, \"once, just once, I'd like to go through a whole season without an injury.\" and he did just that, playing over 150 games each of the next three seasons. In 1969 he hit a career-high .304 with 37 home runs and 121 runs batted in, and in he was the American League Most Valuable Player, hitting 35 home runs with 114 runs batted in and narrowly missed a .300 average during the last week of the season. In the 1970 World Series, Powell homered in the first two games as the Orioles defeated the Cincinnati Reds in five games. Prior to the 1971 season, Powell appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated for the 1971 baseball preview issue. Powell helped Baltimore reach a third straight World Series that year, blasting a pair of home runs in game two of the 1971 ALCS against the up-and-coming Oakland Athletics, but he hit only .111 in the Series as Baltimore lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates in seven games.\n\nPowell had been an American League all-star for four straight years (1968–1971). However, Oriole manager Earl Weaver believed in making liberal use of the platoon system; in 1973 and 1974, Powell fell victim to it, limiting his at-bats. He and Don Hood were traded to the Cleveland Indians for Dave Duncan and minor league outfielder Alvin McGrew on February 25 1975. Powell, again a regular with the Indians, batted .297 (with 129 hits) and 27 home runs (his best season since 1970), and a .997 fielding percentage. However, he hit only nine home runs in . His final season was 1977, as a pinch-hitter for the Dodgers. He hit .244 with no home runs and 5 RBI's. He was released on August 31, 1977.\n\nIn a 17-season career, Powell posted a .266 batting average with 339 home runs, 1187 RBI, .462 slugging percentage and a .361 on-base percentage in 2042 games. Powell hit three home runs in a game three times, and was second only to Eddie Murray on the Orioles' all-time home run list before Cal Ripken Jr. surpassed Powell in 1994.\n\nIn 1983, Powell received five votes for the Hall of Fame (1.3% of all BBWAA voters) in his only appearance on the ballot.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s Powell appeared in more than ten different television commercials for Miller Lite beer, including a memorable one with umpire Jim Honochick. Playing on the theme of mocking umpires who make bad calls, the ad featured Honochick trying unsuccessfully to read the label on a beer bottle as Powell did the voice over. Borrowing Powell's glasses to bring the label into focus, and suddenly able to see who is standing next to him at the bar and providing the narration, Honochick exclaims, \"Hey, you're Boog Powell!\"\n\nPowell is mentioned in an episode of \"Cheers\" entitled \"Sam at Eleven\". The fictional star of Cheers, ex-Red Sox reliever Sam Malone, relates his greatest moment in the Major Leagues: retiring Boog Powell in both games of a doubleheader\n\nPowell is also mentioned in an episode of Bill Burr's Netflix original show \"F Is for Family\". While searching for his wife after having an argument, Frank Murphy drives past a batting cage and hears the crack of the bat hitting a pitch. He then quips to his daughter Maureen, \"That's either your mother or Boog Powell.\"\n\nPowell currently owns Boog's Barbecue, which sells barbecue sandwiches, pit beef, and ribs in three locations: on Eutaw Street at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, the Boardwalk in Ocean City, Maryland, and at Ed Smith Stadium, Sarasota, Florida, during the spring training season. Powell is an avid angler, kicking off the Maryland Fishing season with the governor. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1868210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868210", "title": "Leading zero", "text": "Leading zero\n\nA leading zero is any 0 digit that comes before the first nonzero digit in a number string in positional notation. For example, James Bond's famous identifier, 007, has two leading zeros. When leading zeros occupy the most significant digits of an integer, they could be left blank or omitted for the same numeric value. Therefore, the usual decimal notation of integers does not use leading zeros except for the zero itself, which would be denoted as an empty string otherwise. However, in decimal fractions strictly between −1 and 1, the leading zeros digits between the decimal point and the first nonzero digit are necessary for conveying the magnitude of a number and cannot be omitted, while trailing zeros – zeros occurring after the decimal point and after the last nonzero digit – can be omitted without changing the meaning.\n\nOften, leading zeros are found on non-electronic digital displays or on such electronic ones as seven-segment displays, that contain fixed sets of digits. These devices include manual counters, stopwatches, odometers, and digital clocks. Leading zeros are also generated by many older computer programs when creating values to assign to new records, accounts and other files, and as such are likely to be used by utility billing systems, human resources information systems and government databases. Many digital cameras and other electronic media recording devices use leading zeros when creating and saving new files to make names of the equal length.\n\nLeading zeros also present whenever the number of digits is technically fixed (such as in a memory register), but the stored value is not large enough to result in a non-zero most significant digit. The count leading zeros operation efficiently determines the number of leading zero bits in a machine word.\n\nA leading zero appears in roulette in the United States, where \"00\" is distinct from \"0\" (a wager on \"0\" will not win if the ball lands in \"00\", and vice versa). Sports where competitors are numbered follow this as well; a stock car numbered \"07\" would be considered distinct from one numbered \"7\". Benito Santiago, a Major League Baseball catcher who wore the number 09 for several years, is the only major professional sports league player to use a jersey number with a leading zero, not counting several who have worn the number 00 (in Santiago's case, Major League Baseball did not distinguish his 09 number from the ordinary number 9; he wore the extra zero to avoid complications with his catcher's pads, allowing the back strap to run between the numbers instead of over a single digit 9). This is most common with single-digit numbers.\n\nLeading zeros are used to make ascending order of numbers correspond with alphabetical order: e.g., 11 comes alphabetically before 2, but after 02. (See, e.g., ISO 8601.) This does not work with negative numbers, though, whether leading zeros are used or not: −23 comes alphabetically after −01, −1, and −22, although it is less than all of them. \n\nLeading zeros in a sentence also make it less likely that a careless reader will overlook the decimal point. For example, in modern pharmacy there is a widely followed convention that leading zeros must not be omitted from any dose or dosage value in drug prescribing. Likewise, just as leading zeros are mandatory, trailing zeros are forbidden. In both cases, the reason is the same: to prevent misreading and the resultant misdose by one or several orders of magnitude.\n\nLeading zeros can also be used to prevent fraud by filling in character positions that might normally be empty. For example, adding leading zeros to the amount of a check (or similar financial document) makes it more difficult for fraudsters to alter the amount of the check before presenting it for payment.\n\nA prefix codice_1 is used in C to specify string representations of octal numbers, as required by the ANSI C standard for the \"strtol\" function (the string to long integer converter) in the \"stdlib.h\" library. Many other programming languages, such as Python 2, Perl, Ruby, PHP, and the Unix shell bash also follow this specification for converting strings to numbers. As an example, \"codice_2\" does not represent 20 (2×10 + 0×10), but rather 20 = 16 (2×8 + 0×8 = 1×10 + 6×10). Decimal numbers written with leading zeros will be interpreted as octal by languages that follow this convention and will generate errors (not just unexpected results) if they contain \"8\" or \"9\", since these digits do not exist in octal. This behavior can be quite a nuisance when working with sequences of strings with embedded, zero-padded decimal numbers (typically file names) to facilitate alphabetical sorting (see above) or when validating inputs from users who would not know that adding a leading zero triggers this base conversion.\n\n"}

It emerged following a split within the Hungarian Social Democratic Party (MSZDP) in 1989. Both the SZDP and MSZDP lay claim to the same heritage: the Social Democratic Party which was part of a governing coalition in Hungary between 1945 and 1948, and a short period in 1956, which itself was renamed from the Hungarian Social Democratic Party, previously established in 1890. Traditional areas of support were the industrial areas of Budapest, especially Óbuda, Pesterzsébet and Angyalföld.\n\nOriginally a very small breakaway from the MSZDP, Imre Takács and the other founders were joined by many individuals who left the MSZDP in 1997. They objected to the increasingly centralised leadership style of László Kapolyi, by now funding and leading the MSZDP into a close association with the formerly communist MSZP. Among this group of new recruits were a number of veterans from the post-war coalition of 1945-1948 and the government of Imre Nagy, such as Róbert Gábor, Sándor Bácskai and Ernő Nagy.\n\nElectorally, the SZDP have remained a marginal party, with some limited success in local elections. Under the co-leadership of Mátyás Szűrös from 2003-2005 the party took a sharp turn towards populism and the right-wing Fidesz party. By the time Szűrös was finally forced out in 2005 the party had suffered a loss in any remaining credibility.\n\nIn April 2009, the party announced that Anna Petrasovits, leader of the MSZDP from 1989-1992 would lead the party's list for the European Parliament elections in June 2009. This failed to culminate in the necessary number of nominations from voters. Following this abortive attempt, infighting broke out between different leadership factions. The party has failed to contest national elections since the 2002 Hungarian parliamentary election and can be considered to be practically defunct on this basis.\n\nBoth the Social Democratic Party and the Hungarian Social Democratic Party have claimed to be the natural successors to the Social Democratic Party which existed before 1948 and the imposition of one-party rule in Hungary.\n\nThe Historic Social Democrats have argued that they are in the historical tradition of Hungarian social democracy as they have retained their distance from the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) - whilst the MSZDP has formed a close, shared platform with the MSZP. The MSZP are regarded by the SZDP as a post-communist formation and not within the social democratic tradition.\n\nIdeologically, some in the SZDP have been closer to what is described as democratic socialism in the United Kingdom, and have aimed to provide a democratic critique of capitalism. Others, including the current leadership, have stressed the nationalistic aspects to social democracy. Anna Kéthly is regarded as one of the historical leading figures, providing the SZDP with its own philosophy of ethical social democracy. The party is opposed to wholesale privatisation and \"extreme\" neoliberalism, and is committed to building up the \"indigenous\" Hungarian economy. The last official statement from the party in February 2013 pledged support for the current Fidesz administration.\n\n"}

For accelerated motion, the accelerated frame has an inertial frame at every instant. Two boosts a small time interval (as measured in the lab frame) apart leads to a Wigner rotation after the second boost. In the limit the time interval tends to zero, the accelerated frame will rotate at every instant, so the accelerated frame rotates with an angular velocity.\n\nThe precession can be understood geometrically as a consequence of the fact that the space of velocities in relativity is hyperbolic, and so parallel transport of a vector (the gyroscope's angular velocity) around a circle (its linear velocity) leaves it pointing in a different direction, or understood algebraically as being a result of the non-commutativity of Lorentz transformations. Thomas precession gives a correction to the spin–orbit interaction in quantum mechanics, which takes into account the relativistic time dilation between the electron and the nucleus of an atom.\n\nThomas precession is a kinematic effect in the flat spacetime of special relativity. In the curved spacetime of general relativity, Thomas precession combines with a geometric effect to produce de Sitter precession. Although Thomas precession (\"net rotation after a trajectory that returns to its initial velocity\") is a purely kinematic effect, it only occurs in curvilinear motion and therefore cannot be observed independently of some external force causing the curvilinear motion such as that caused by an electromagnetic field, a gravitational field or a mechanical force, so Thomas precession is usually accompanied by dynamical effects.\n\nIf the system experiences no external torque, e.g., in external scalar fields, its spin dynamics is determined only by the Thomas precession. A single discrete Thomas rotation (as opposed to the series of infinitesimal rotations that add up to the Thomas precession) is present in situations anytime there are three or more inertial frames in non-collinear motion, as can be seen using Lorentz transformations.\n\nThomas precession in relativity was already known to Ludwik Silberstein, in 1914. But the only knowledge Thomas had of relativistic precession came from de Sitter's paper on the relativistic precession of the moon, first published in a book by Eddington.\n\nIn 1925 Thomas relativistically recomputed the precessional frequency of the doublet separation in the fine structure of the atom. He thus found the missing factor 1/2, which came to be known as the Thomas half.\n\nThis discovery of the relativistic precession of the electron spin led to the understanding of the significance of the relativistic effect. The effect was consequently named \"Thomas precession\".\n\nConsider a physical system moving through Minkowski spacetime. Assume that there is at any moment an inertial system such that in it, the system is at rest. This assumption is sometimes called the third postulate of relativity. This means that at any instant, the coordinates and state of the system can be Lorentz transformed to the lab system through \"some\" Lorentz transformation.\n\nLet the system be subject to \"external forces\" that produce no torque with respect to its center of mass in its (instantaneous) rest frame. The condition of \"no torque\" is necessary to isolate the phenomenon of Thomas precession. As a simplifying assumption one assumes that the external forces bring the system back to its initial velocity after some finite time. Fix a Lorentz frame such that the initial and final velocities are zero.\n\nThe Pauli–Lubanski spin vector is defined to be in the system's \"rest\" frame, with the angular-momentum three-vector about the center of mass. In the motion from initial to final position, undergoes a rotation, as recorded in , from its initial to its final value. This continuous change is the Thomas precession.\n\nConsider the motion of a particle. Introduce a lab frame in which an observer can measure the relative motion of the particle. At each instant of time the particle has an inertial frame in which it is at rest. Relative to this lab frame, the instantaneous velocity of the particle is with magnitude bounded by the speed of light , so that . Here the time is the coordinate time as measured in the lab frame, \"not\" the proper time of the particle.\n\nApart from the upper limit on magnitude, the velocity of the particle is arbitrary and not necessarily constant, its corresponding vector of acceleration is . As a result of the Wigner rotation at every instant, the particle's frame precesses with an angular velocity given by the\n\nwhere × is the cross product and\n\nand expanding the Lorentz factor of as a power series gives to first order in ,\n\nusing the Lorentz factor of as above.\n\nIntroducing the boost generators\n\nand rotation generators\n\nalong with the dot product · facilitates the coordinate independent expression\n\nwhich holds if and lie in any plane. This is an \"infinitesimal\" Lorentz transformation in the form of a combined boost and rotation\n\nwhere\n\nAfter dividing by and taking the limit as in (), one obtains the instantaneous angular velocity\n\nwhere is the acceleration of the particle as observed in the lab frame. No forces were specified or used in the derivation so the precession is a kinematical effect - it arises from the geometric aspects of motion. However, forces cause accelerations, so the Thomas precession is observed if the particle is subject to forces.\n\nThomas precession can also be derived using the Fermi-Walker transport equation. One assumes uniform circular motion in flat Minkowski spacetime. The spin 4-vector is orthogonal to the velocity 4-vector. Fermi-Walker transport preserves this relation. One finds that the dot product of the acceleration 4-vector with the spin 4-vector varies sinusoidally with time with an angular frequency Ύ ω, where ω is the angular frequency of the circular motion and Ύ=1/√⟨1-v^2/c^2). This is easily shown by taking the second time derivative of that dot product. Because this angular frequency exceeds ω, the spin precesses in the retrograde direction. The difference (γ-1)ω is the Thomas precession angular frequency already given, as is simply shown by realizing that that the magnitude of the 3-acceleration is ω v.\n\nIn quantum mechanics Thomas precession is a correction to the spin-orbit interaction, which takes into account the relativistic time dilation between the electron and the nucleus in hydrogenic atoms.\n\nBasically, it states that spinning objects precess when they accelerate in special relativity because Lorentz boosts do not commute with each other.\n\nTo calculate the spin of a particle in a magnetic field, one must also take into account Larmor precession.\n\nThe rotation of the swing plane of Foucault pendulum can be treated as a result of parallel transport of the pendulum in a 2-dimensional sphere of Euclidean space. The hyperbolic space of velocities in Minkowski spacetime represents a 3-dimensional (pseudo-) sphere with imaginary radius and imaginary timelike coordinate. Parallel transport of a spinning particle in relativistic velocity space leads to Thomas precession, which is similar to the rotation of the swing plane of a Foucault pendulum. The angle of rotation in both cases is determined by the area integral of curvature in agreement with the Gauss–Bonnet theorem.\n\nThomas precession gives a correction to the precession of a Foucault pendulum. For a Foucault pendulum located in the city of Nijmegen in the Netherlands the correction is:\n\nNote that it is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the precession due to the general-relativistic correction arising from frame-dragging, the Lense–Thirring precession.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It covered an area of and had a population of 910.\n\nThe administrative centre of Noarootsi Parish was Pürksi village (). It is located 10 km north from the capital of Lääne County, Haapsalu.\n\nThere were 23 villages in Noarootsi Parish: Aulepa (Dirslätt), Dirhami (Derhamn), Einbi (Enby), Elbiku (Ölbäck), Hara (Harga), Hosby, Höbringi (Höbring), Kudani (Gutanäs), Osmussaare (Odensholm), Paslepa (Pasklep), Pürksi (Birkas), Riguldi (Rickul), Rooslepa (Roslep), Saare (Lyckholm), Spithami (Spithamn), Sutlepa (Sutlep), Suur-Nõmmküla (Klottorp), Tahu (Skåtanäs), Telise (Tällnäs), Tuksi (Bergsby), Vanaküla (Gambyn), Väike-Nõmmküla (Persåker), Österby.\n\nNoarootsi was historically the only parish on the Estonian mainland where most of the local residents were Swedish-speaking. In 1934, the parish had 4,388 inhabitants, 2,697 (64%) of them Estonian Swedes.\n\nUntil the end of the ancient historic period, today's Noarootsi area was practically unpopulated. Noarootsi peninsula was once a group of small islands, which joined the mainland in the middle of the 19th century. The first written proof of the Swedish population stems from the 13th century. There has been speculation, although unfounded, that many of the Swedes came from Finland. For historical reasons, the Swedes had privileges (\"Svensk Rätt\"—\"Swedish rights\"), which consisted mainly of personal freedom and freedom of movement, and lower taxes. The Swedish population was strengthened by influx of Swedes from Uusimaa in Finland, peaking in the beginning of the 16th century.\n\nIn the second half of the 16th century, during the Livonian war, the areas of Noarootsi were plundered by Russian army troops, and many sites, such as the church, were devastated. Beginning in the 1580s, Noarootsi was subjected to Swedish rule, which lasted until 1710. The Swedish era caused the cultural life to accelerate. In Noarootsi, the first known folk high school (first mentioned in 1650) was established by local Lutheran pastor Isaacus Mariaestadius Hasselblatt. Noarootsi church added chapels in Sutlepa, Rooslepa and Osmussaar. At the same time a line of manor houses was built, which initiated limits on the coastal Swedes' rights. Noarootsi's peasants' long fight for their freedom had begun.\n\nDuring the Great Northern War, Noarootsi was attacked by the plague epidemic during 1710–1711. The number of residents decreased by two-thirds, and many villages died out completely. Estonians from the mainland came to live in the empty villages. It was the start of Noarootsi becoming Estonianized. After the Great Northern War the conflicts between the lords of the manors and the peasants became more critical. This conflict culminated in the 1770s, with the sending of some of Hara's village residents to the mainland.\n\nIn 1816 serfdom was abolished in Estonia. It did not touch the coastal Swedish Estonians, as their condition was ambiguous. They were not slaves and yet they were not entirely free. The folks' communal self-government and permanent compulsory school attendance were established in Noarootsi in 1856.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, a new intellectual period began. Schools needed Swedish-speaking teachers. For their preparation in the Paslepa manor house, a teachers' training college was established, which was in operation for 14 years. The training college was led by the Swedish missionary Thure Emanuel Thorén. By the 1890s, a network of Swedish schools was formed in Estonia.\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, Noarootsi started to be the centre of the Swedes' intellectual activity. The local society's activities were led by Johan Nymann and Hans Pöhl. In 1898 the first choral society was established in Paslepa, and in 1902 the first Swedish lending library was established. In 1903 the first Swedish calendar was distributed. In 1909 the Swedish education association was established in the Vööla manor house. In 1920 Pürksi's folk high school was opened and it was in operation until 1943.\n\nDuring the Estonian Republic the relationship between local residents and Swedes and Finns increased remarkably. Riguldi became a very active ship construction centre, the ship Hoppet () is one ship that still exists from this era. At first, potatoes and apples were exported to Sweden and Finland. It seemed that the Swedes were developing their place in Estonian society.\n\nIn 1939 the Red Army bases were brought to Estonia. During this time, a great deal of the population was evacuated from Osmussaar island. In the summer of 1940 the Soviet Union established their power and with this a border zone. It became impossible for the residents to go on with their previous occupations and they started to think about emigration to Sweden.\n\nFrom 1943 to 1944 most of the Swedes left Estonia. In their place came war refugees from northeastern Estonia and Ingria. In 1944 the Soviet Army returned and the border zone was restored. The remaining inhabitants' contacts with their relatives in Sweden were cut off. During the forced emigration and building up of kolkhozes (collective farms), many villages were ruined and the coastal areas become military zones. Only a few villages have retained their original look.\n\nThe new age in Noarootsi's history started at the end of the 1980s. The border zone disappeared and the local residents could return to their homes. In 1988 the first folk day celebrations were organized in Noarootsi. In 1989 Swedish instruction was reinstated in Noarootsi. In 1990, Noarootsi Gymnasium, with immersion study in Swedish, was founded in Pürksi. Approximately 900 people lived in Noarootsi Parish in 2005, only 50 of them considered themselves Swedish.\n\nSome Swedes have returned to Noarootsi after the demise of Soviet Union and bought or reclaimed old property, usually land, which they developed. The area is attractive for people looking for a summer house as large areas of Noarootsi have been off limits for civilians during Soviet rule. High property tax in Sweden and low in Estonia is another reason.\n\n\n"}

As a medical student, he was awarded the Meyerhof Prize in 1921. He specialized in allergy medicine and pediatrics.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Abramson traveled widely, and was affiliated with laboratories at Johns Hopkins and Harvard, as well as the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry in Berlin. He also began long affiliations with laboratories at Mount Sinai Hospital and at Cold Spring Harbor.  Returning to P&S, he became Assistant Professor of Physiology from 1935 to 1942 and joined the staff at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City in 1941, cultivating an interest in asthma and pulmonary disease, and where he was the first ever to use aerosolized penicillin.\n\nHe was on military leave from 1943 to August of 1946, and during this period he earned the United States Army’s Legion of Merit “for vital contributions to the Chemical Warfare Service and thus to the war effort” for work involving aerosol penicillin.\n\nHe returned to P&S in September of 1946, and became Assistant Clinical Professor of Physiology from 1948-57. During the 1950s, Abramson was involved in LSD research conducted at Mount Sinai and funded by the CIA, and he appears in the Church Commission’s investigation of CIA practices. His later career was spent at Mount Sinai Hospital and other hospitals in the New York area, finally leaving Mount Sinai Hospital in 1959.\n\nWhile at Mount Sinai Hospital in 1953, Abramson proposed an $85,000 study to the CIA on the effects of LSD on unwitting hospital patients. This was the same year that the MKULTRA program was established. Funding for the project was funneled through the Macy Foundation. Abramson was an attending physician in connection with the tragic (and allegedly LSD-induced) apparent suicide of Frank Olson, a microbiologist who was covertly given LSD as part of the CIA's psychotropic drug research. Beginning in 1954, Abramson published a series of articles on the effects of LSD on Siamese fighting fish. He is said to be the person who influenced many members of the Cybernetics Group to turn to LSD, including Frank Fremont-Smith, head of the Macy foundation. (The Cybernetics Group, originally named The Conference on Feedback Mechanisms in Biology and the Social Sciences, was started in 1946). He was also an organizer of the six international LSD conferences, the first being held in 1959.\n\nIn 1967, he edited the book \"The Use of LSD in Psychotherapy and Alcoholism\".\n\nHe was the founder, with M. Murray Peshkin, of the \"Journal of Asthma Research\", and remained its editor until his death.\n\nHe also worked as director of research at South Oaks Psychiatric Hospital in Amityville and a consulting research psychiatrist at State Hospital in Central Islip.\n\nAbramson died on September 29, 1980.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1868243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868243", "title": "American Girl", "text": "American Girl\n\nAmerican Girl is an American line of dolls released in 1986 by Pleasant Company. The dolls portray eight- to twelve-year-old girls of a variety of ethnicities, time periods of origin, faiths, and social classes. They are sold with accompanying books told from the viewpoint of the girls. Originally the stories focused on various periods of American history, but were expanded in 1995 to include characters and stories from contemporary life. Aside from the original American Girl dolls, the buyer also has the option to purchase dolls that look like themselves. The options for the line of Truly Me dolls include eye color, face mold, skin color, hair texture, and hair length. A variety of related clothing and accessories is also available. A service for ordering a bespoke doll with features and clothing specified by the owner, dubbed \"Create Your Own\", has also been introduced in 2017.\n\nPleasant Company was founded in 1986 by Pleasant Rowland, and its products were originally purchasable by mail order only. In 1998, Pleasant Company became a subsidiary of Mattel. The company has been awarded the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Award eight times.\n\nThe \"Historical Characters\" line of 18-inch dolls, which were derived from the 18-inch dolls made by Götz in West Germany (known as Germany from October 1990) during the late 1980s to the 1990s, were initially the main focus of Pleasant Company, founded by Pleasant Rowland in 1986. This product line aims to teach aspects of American history through a six-book series from the perspective of a girl living in that time period. Pleasant Rowland came up with the idea after she returned from a trip to Colonial Williamsburg, where she noticed there was a significant void in the toy market for younger aged dolls and saw an opportunity to provide an alternative to baby and adult dolls. Although the books are written for girls who are at least eight years old, they endeavor to cover significant topics such as child labor, child abuse, poverty, racism, slavery, animal abuse and war in manners appropriate for the understanding and sensibilities of their young audience.\n\nIn 1995, Pleasant Company released a line of contemporary dolls called \"American Girl of Today\". In 2006, the product line was renamed \"Just Like You\"; it was changed again in 2010, to \"My American Girl\", and in 2015 to \"Truly Me\". This line has included seventy-seven different dolls over the years. Each doll has a different combination of face mold, skin tone, eye color, and hair color, length, texture, and/or style. American Girl states that this variety allows customers to choose dolls that \"represent the individuality and diversity of today's American girls.\" A wide variety of contemporary clothing, accessories, and furniture is also available, and there are regular releases and retirements to update this line. Each year, a \"Girl of the Year\" doll is released who has her own special talent; for example, Mia St. Clair, the Girl of the Year for 2008, did ice skating, and Marisol Luna, the Girl of the Year for 2005, was a dancer.\n\nBitty Baby is a line of 15\" baby dolls targeted to children aged three and older. They are cheaper than the 18\" dolls, and currently retail at $60 each.\n\nThe Bitty Twins line debuted in 2003 to represent slightly older toddlers and/or preschoolers. The Bitty Twins were the same size as the Bitty Baby dolls. They were discontinued in June 2016.\n\n\"Hopscotch Hill School\" was released by American Girl in 2003. The dolls were tall, came with jointed limbs and painted eyes, and had a slimmer overall body shape. They, along with the stories which came with the dolls written by Valerie Tripp, were aimed at elementary-age girls from four to six years old, and were sold until 2006.\n\nA reboot of the Historical Characters line dubbed as \"BeForever\" was launched in August 2014, complete with redesigned outfits, a two-volume compilation of previously-released books, and a \"Journey Book\" for each character, with players taking the role of a present-day girl who found her way to the past and met up with one of the Historical girls. The line also coincided with the relaunch of Samantha Parkington, whose collection was previously discontinued in 2008.\n\nIn June 2016, American Girl unveiled \"Wellie Wishers\", a separate doll line similar to \"Hopscotch Hill School\" aimed for younger children and with a focus on the outdoors, positioning it between Bitty Baby and the BeForever/Girl of the Year/Truly Me dolls. As the name implies, dolls from the line wear Wellington boots, and have a body design distinct from the classic, Götz-derived American Girl dolls. The line was released on June 23, 2016. The names of the Wellie Wishers are: Willa, Camille, Kendall, Emerson, and Ashlyn.\n\nIn February 2017, American Girl released a new line of 18\" dolls called contemporary characters. The first doll in the line was Tenney Grant, an aspiring country singer and songwriter. Other dolls of the contemporary line include Logan, Tenney's bandmate and American Girl's first ever boy doll, and Z Yang, who is interested in photography and making stop motion videos.\n\nIn December 2019, there is a report of declining sales for The American Girl Doll Brand.\n\nIn 2004, American Girl teamed with Julia Roberts's Red Om production company and to create the first American Girl direct-to-video movie, \"\". The film spawned a franchise that was followed by \"\" (2005), \"\" (2006), along with the 2008 theatrically released film \"\". In 2009, HBO premiered \"\". In July 2012, American Girl released a direct-to-video movie, \"McKenna Shoots for the Stars\". A seventh movie based on Saige Copeland's stories entitled \"\" was released in July 2013, and a television film entitled \"Isabelle Dances Into the Spotlight\", based on Girl of the Year 2014 Isabelle Palmer, was released in 2014. A ninth film based on 2015 Girl of the Year Grace Thomas was released under the title \"\", with Olivia Rodrigo playing the title role.\n\nA live-action web special based on Melody Ellison's stories entitled \"An American Girl Story - Melody 1963: Love Has to Win\" was released by Amazon, starring Marsai Martin as the title character. \"Love Has to Win\" was then followed by \"An American Girl Story - Maryellen 1955: Extraordinary Christmas\", starring Alyvia Alyn Lind as Maryellen Larkin and released by Amazon on November 25, 2016.\n\nThe American Girl store sells American Girl dolls, clothes, and accessories. The first store, the 35,000 square-foot American Girl Place, designed by Nancye Green of Donovan/Green, debuted in Chicago in 1998. It was followed by stores in New York City and Los Angeles. \n\nIn May 2014, Mattel American Girl opened new stores in Toronto, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada in partnership with Indigo Books and Music. The company has also expressed interest in other overseas ventures, as they are seeing orders from Europe and Latin America. In 2015, the company announced that they were expanding operations in Mexico with two stores at El Palacio de Hierro’s Perisur and Interlomas in Mexico City, and a third in Polanco.\n\n\nFormer locations include Chesterfield Mall in Chesterfield, Missouri, Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota and Natick Mall in Natick, Massachusetts.\n\nThe first temporary boutique opened in Honolulu, Hawaii at the Ala Moana Center, running from October 4, 2014, to April 2015.\n\nAmerican Girl opened several temporary locations during the holiday season in 2016 in an attempt to reach more customers. In August 2016, a temporary location was set up in Novi, Michigan a suburb of Detroit in Twelve Oaks Mall which closed on January 28, 2017. In July 2017, a temporary location opened in Raleigh, North Carolina, in the Crabtree Valley Mall; to be opened until January 28, 2018.\n\nThe \"American Girl\" magazine was run by the American Girl company. It was started by the Pleasant Company in Middleton, Wisconsin in 1992, with the first issue dated January 1993. Aimed towards girls ages 8-14, the bimonthly magazine included articles, recipes, advice columns, fiction, arts and crafts, and activity ideas. American Girl announced in late 2018 that the January/February 2019 issue would be the magazine's last.\n\nAmerican Girl launched Innerstar University, an online virtual world featuring the My American Girl contemporary doll line, on July 13, 2010. Access to the online world is via a Campus Guide, bundled with purchase of a My American Girl doll, which contains an access code for the creation of a doll avatar that then navigates the various games, shops, and challenges of the virtual campus of Innerstar U. In 2015, when My American Girl dolls were changed to Truly Me dolls, this website was closed down. The launch was simultaneous with Shine on Now, a fund-raising effort Kids In Distressed Situations, National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, National Wildlife Federation, and Save the Children charities. The company has also donated \"almost $500,000\" over several years to national non-profit homeless housing group HomeAid. These contributions are mainly through its Project Playhouse program.\n\nThe company has drawn criticism for the expense of the dolls, which cost $115 without accessories as of December 2014. Buyers can easily spend more than $600 for a doll, outfits, accessories and lunch in the company's store in New York.\nSome aspects of the doll's characters and history have also provoked controversy. Some observers questioned why Addy, American Girl's first African-American historical character, was portrayed first as a slave (in later stories Addy and her family gain their freedom after the Civil War), while Cecile Rey, American Girl's second black historical character, was portrayed as a well-to-do black girl in New Orleans. American Girl later went on with releasing their first African-American Girl of the Year, Gabriela McBride, who is portrayed as a dancer, artist, and poet. In 2005, residents of Pilsen (a neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois) criticized a passage in the book associated with the Latina-American doll Marisol, claiming it inaccurately depicted their neighborhood as dangerous. A senior public relations associate for American Girl responded to critics saying: “We feel that this brief passage has been taken out of context in the book.\" The 2009 limited-edition release of Gwen, a homeless American Girl character, was also controversial.\n\nIn 2005, some pro-life and Catholic groups criticized the company for donating funds to the organization Girls, Inc., which supports underprivileged girls and promotes abortion rights and LGBT acceptance.\n\nThe American Girl Place store in New York City was the center of a labor dispute with Actors' Equity Association (AEA). On August 3, 2006, 14 of the 18 adult actors at the store's now defunct theater went on strike. AEA reached a two-year contract effective April 1, 2008. All American Girl Place theatres were subsequently closed in September of that year.\n\nIn May 2014, the company was met with criticism on social media over its decision to discontinue four characters from the historical collection, two of them, namely African-American Cécile Rey and Chinese-American Ivy Ling, representing ethnic minorities. They however defended their move as a business decision, as they decided to \"move away from the character-friend strategy within the line\". A petition has since been filed through the activist group 18MillionRising.org for the company to provide a replacement for Ivy. The company has also drawn criticism for its recent focus on the contemporary line, specifically the Girl of the Year characters and their backstory, to which was viewed as lacking depth and more important issues in comparison to the Historical/BeForever characters' backstories. \"\" series creator Lauren Faust also expressed her concern and criticism of the line in a Twitter post, stating it \"was once radically positive for girls before it was homogenized for money\".\n\nAmerican Girl attracted considerable criticism in February 2017 when they announced that they will be changing the dolls' bodies to incorporate permanently stitched panties on contemporary dolls and certain BeForever character dolls, namely Maryellen, Melody and Julie. Public reaction to the permanent underwear—the first major change since the transition to flesh-colored bodies in 1991 following the release of the Felicity doll—was overwhelmingly negative, as fans of the franchise complained that it stifles customization and devalued a well-established and successful brand \"from heirloom quality to be passed down for generations to low-quality retail.\"\n\nThe company then reversed its decision in a Facebook post in May 2017, stating that any existing or upcoming dolls from the line will revert to the old body design, and customers who bought a doll with permanent underwear are eligible for a \"one-time\" exchange to have the dolls retrofitted with conventional torsos. In addition, the company has switched back to the old \"iconic boutique box\" packaging following complaints by collectors who deemed the new boxes to be inferior and more susceptible to damage.\n\nYouTube videos made with American Girl Dolls are becoming increasingly popular. In 2015, the American Girl fan community, more specifically the practice of creating and uploading American Girl doll-based stop motion videos, (AGSM for short) was featured in a news report for BBC News' Trending site, along with interviews and videos from several prominent doll community members. Besides stop-motion animations and music videos set to popular music, the report covers recurring subject matters in the said clips such as cyberbullying and other social issues among children and teenagers, along with doll customization, photoshoots and unboxing videos showing new and discontinued clothes, accessories and dolls from the company.\n\nBesides YouTube, social media services such as Instagram and Facebook serve as platforms for fans of the toy line, spawning a community called AGIG, or American Girl Instagram, who photograph their dolls and post their photos on the service. Although mostly made up of girls usually around the age of 12-18, a number of boys and adults also participate and congregate on AGIG.\n\nAmerican Girl's teenage fans, particularly ones on AGTube and AGIG, will meet up with other fans at American Girl stores. At the release of Lea Clark and Gabriela McBride, certain prominent community members were included in the \"Clue\" videos released by American Girl. At the release of Z Yang, American Girl hosted meetups at their New York City flagship store and at their Dallas location.\n\n"}

Since the 2002 parliamentary elections, the party has won no seats.\n\nFounded on 12 October 1930, the original party won a majority in the first elections after the Second World War, resulting in its leader, Zoltán Tildy, becoming prime minister. In the elections in November 1945, the Smallholders' polled 57% of votes against the Communists' 17%. The Communist response was the sponsoring of a coalition of \"democratic\" parties against the smallholders. The Smallholders-dominated parliament established a republic in 1946 with Tildy as president. He was succeeded as prime minister by Ferenc Nagy.\n\nIn 1947 the Communist Party carried out a coup d’état against the rule of the Smallholders’ Party. Though not all democratic institutions were abolished, the Communists firmly held power. Most of the resisting Smallholder were either arrested or forced to leave the country. Lajos Dinnyés of the Smallholders remained prime minister after the 1947 elections, but his government was controlled by the communists. Over the next two years, the Communists pressured the Smallholders into expelling their right-wing members as \"fascists\". Another Smallholder, the openly pro-Communist István Dobi, became premier in December 1948, and pushed out the remaining elements of the party who were not willing to stop their obstruction. In 1949, the party was absorbed into a People's Independent Front, led by the communist Hungarian Working People's Party. The latter prevailed in elections held that year, marking the onset of undisguised Communist rule in Hungary. The Smallholders party was dissolved later in 1949, and Dobi and several other left-wing Smallholders joined the Communist Party.\n\n"}

It is the first season to be filmed in the Mountain States region of the United States, specifically in Nevada.\n\nThe season featured seven people who lived in a converted penthouse suite on the 28th floor of the Las Vegas Palms Casino and Resort, which production started from February 13 until June 21, 2002. The season premiered on September 17 of that year, consisted of 28 episodes, which along with the season, is the highest number to date. This was the first of three seasons of \"The Real World\" to be filmed in Las Vegas. The show made a return to the city twice: in the and the seasons, the latter set in Downtown Las Vegas.\n\nDue to the popularity of the season, MTV ordered the spin-off miniseries \"\" that reunited the cast to live in the same Palms Hotel and Casino suite they filmed the original series in, five years after filming ended on \"The Real World: Las Vegas\".\n\nThe owner of The Palms Casino Hotel, where the season was filmed, asked for production to cast exclusively people over 21 years old. Thus this was the first season in which all the castmates were at least that old.\n\nThe Palms demolished six rooms to make the hotel suite in which the season was filmed, at a cost of over $2 million USD. It was designed by Sharmila Tankha of the Jerde Partnership, the same firm that designed the hotel itself. Unlike previous \"Real World\" residences, the suite is not decorated with IKEA furnishings.\n\nThe suite, which is now called \"The Real World Suite\", is one of few former \"Real World\" residences that not only overall remains in the condition in which it was used for filming (minor changes have been made, such as the addition of doors for the bedrooms, TV's and the removal of the Confessional), but in which the public can potentially reside. The hotel rents the suite for $11,200 a night (including tax), and has done so to numerous celebrities who have stayed there. Among them are Britney Spears, who stayed in the suite on New Year's Eve 2004.\n\nMost seasons of \"The Real World\", beginning with the , have included the assignment of a season-long group job or task to the housemates, continued participation in which has been mandatory to remain part of the cast since the Back to New York season. The Las Vegas housemates had various jobs throughout the season involving the Palms Casino and Resort in which they lived, including promotional work for the night club, Rain in the Desert, cocktail waiting, and go-go dancing.\n\nAfter the cast left the \"Real World\" suite, six of them, except for Trishelle, appeared to discuss their experiences both during and since their time on the show, \"7 The Hard Way: The Real World Las Vegas Reunion\" which premiered on April 8, 2003, and was hosted by Hilarie Burton.\n\nAt the 2008 \"The Real World Awards Bash\", Steven, Trishelle and Brynn took home the award for \"Steamiest Scene\".

He served as Chief of Engineers from 1798 to 1802.\n\nHenry Burbeck was born in Boston on June 10, 1754, the son of William Burbeck and his wife Jerusha Glover of Boston. His father was a British colonial officer in the ordnance department and second in command of Castle William in Boston Harbor, but gave up his commission and supported the patriot cause when hostilities broke out.\n\nBurbeck's education consisted of a public writing school in the North End of Boston under John Tileston (1735–1826). He would later credit his father with the remainder of his education. Prior to his military service, Henry worked at the copper-smith's forge with Paul Revere. He married his first wife, Abigail Webb, on April 12, 1775, in Boston.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Battle of Lexington, Burbeck's father escaped to Cambridge and reported to the Committee on Public Safety and its leader, General Joseph Warren, to join the patriot cause which resulted in a price being placed on his head by the British. Burbeck joined his father in Cambridge where they made ammunition used at the Battle of Bunker Hill and also participated in the battle. Henry served as a lieutenant in the Battle of Bunker Hill and his commission was signed by General Joseph Warren on May 19, 1775. Following the Battle of Bunker Hill, Burbeck married Abigail Webb on August 12, 1775, in Boston.\n\nHe was assigned as a lieutenant of artillery to the Massachusetts line commanded by Colonel Richard Gridley, the Continental Army's first Chief Engineer and artillery commander, in 1775.\n\nIn 1777, he briefly joined the army at Saratoga until he was assigned to Pennsylvania to join Gen. George Washington's army. He fought in the battles of Brandywine and Germantown. He remained in the Artillery Corps under General Henry Knox and, in 1777, assumed command of a company of the 3rd Continental Artillery Regiment commanded by Colonel John Crane. He marched with General Washington and the Continental Army from Valley Forge to New Jersey in 1778. Following the march, he fought in the Battle of Monmouth.\n\nHis unit was sent North and he remained in White Plains, New York, to defend the Hudson Highlands from 1779-1783. He marched into New York City when the British army evacuated it at the close of the Revolutionary War.\n\nBurbeck became an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati upon its founding in 1783. He served as president of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati from 1846 until his death in 1848. \n\nBurbeck knew General George Washington personally from his service and it was from Burbeck's associations with foreign officers serving in the American Revolution that he recognized the need to educate and train the army in artillery and engineering. Burbeck recommended the establishment of West Point Military Academy.\n\nBurbeck was honorably discharged from the Continental Army in January 1784. In October 1786 he was re-commissioned as captain of a company of artillery, one of four in a battalion commanded by Major John Doughty, and commanded the post at West Point, New York, from 1787 to 1789. In 1787, he was ordered by General Knox to Springfield, Massachusetts, to protect the arsenal there is the aftermath of Shays' Rebellion. His wife Abigail died in June 1790 in Bath, Maine.\n\nBurbeck was promoted to Major Commandant of the Artillery on March 16, 1792. He commanded the Army's Battalion of Artillery and served as General Anthony Wayne's Chief of Artillery in the Northwest Indian War in 1792-1794. He was ordered, on August 29, 1789, to Georgia to serve as a guard to Major General Benjamin Lincoln and Colonel Humphries during the unsuccessful treaty negotiation with the Creek people. He returned to Georgia in 1790 and built a fort on the St. Mary's River.\n\nBurbeck established Fort Recovery in Ohio in 1794 which was named after the lost cannons that were recovered at the site of in the aftermath of St. Clair's defeat by the Indians in 1791. Burbeck buried 200 skulls and numerous bones from Arthur St. Clair's defeat and interred them. Two brass cannons from the 1791 action, recovered by Burbeck in the Wabash, were discharged in honor of the deceased.\n\nBurbeck oversaw the transfer of power from British to American control of Fort Mackinac in 1796, 13 years after the Treaty of Paris was signed. He served at the fort through 1799.\n\nFrom 1798 to 1802, Burbeck was the senior regimental commander of artillerists and engineers. He also commanded the Eastern Department of the Army in 1800 and in that year endorsed the creation of a corps of engineers separate from the artillerists. He was Chief of the new Artillery Corps from 1802 to 1815, first as a colonel and then during the War of 1812 as a brevet brigadier general. During the Jefferson administration (1801–1809), Burbeck successfully developed and tested domestically produced cast-iron artillery pieces.\n\nIn 1808, he served on the Court of Inquiry, ordered by President Madison, held at Morin's Tavern in Philadelphia, investigating General James Wilkinson for receiving a pension from the Spanish government while serving in the United States military. Previously, Wilkinson had been a member of the Conway Cabal against Washington and resigned from the army. He received the governorship of Louisiana by Thomas Jefferson in 1805. Wilkinson's close relationship with the Spanish government led to a confrontation with Aaraon Burr which ultimately resulted in accusations that Wilkinson was tied to the Spanish government. Other members of the Court of Inquiry included Colonel Thomas Cushing of the Infantry and Colonel Jonathan Williams of the Engineers. In September 1811, during the court martial, Wilkinson took exception to the presence of Burbeck and two other members of the court and they were all replaced. Wilkinson was found not guilty on December 25, 1811.\n\nAt the beginning of the War of 1812, Burbeck was summoned to New London, Connecticut, to relieve Jirah Isham of the command of the state militia. At the same time he was placed in command of Military District No. 2 comprising the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island. While stationed in New London, he received orders to march to Boston to take command there during the blockade by a British squadron commanded by Commodore Sir Thomas Hardy. The winter march resulted in the suffering of many of the men under his command who were frostbitten from exposure to the winter elements. During the march, Burbeck refused any favors offered to him that were not also given to his men.\n\nAfter returning to New London, in July 1813, he received a letter from Gen. Armstrong which enclosed a copy of a letter written by the Governor of Virginia stating that information from British deserters indicated that British transports, under Admiral George Cockburn, sailed from Chesapeake Bay to New London, Connecticut. Burbeck responded by organizing the state militia to respond while Hardy's fleet lay off New London harbor. Burbeck continued in command of New London to the end of the war.\n\nGeneral Burbeck retired from the Army in June 1815, when the Army was reduced following the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the war. At the time of Burbeck's retirement, he had served a total of 37 years in the Continental Army and the United States Army. He was one of the relatively few officers who had served in both the American Revolution and the War of 1812.\n\nBurbeck married Lucy Elizabeth Rudd Caldwell on December 13, 1813 in New London, Connecticut. She was the daughter of Corp. Daniel Rudd Jr. and Abigail Allen. She was first married to Capt. Henry Caldwell of the Marines who died March 12, 1812 at Charlestown, Massachusetts. Caldwell was on the Little Belt during the Little Belt affair, an event that is regarded as one of the causes of the War of 1812, and he testified during the Court of Inquiry on the Little Belt Affair which convened in New York in September 1811. Lucy was a descendant of Gov. William Bradford (1590-1657) of the Mayflower and Jonathan Rudd who was married, in a legendary ceremony, at Bride Brook in what is now East Lyme, Connecticut in December 1646. Burbeck was the same exact age as Lucy's father Daniel Rudd Jr., both being born on June 10, 1754. At the time of his marriage to Lucy, Burbeck was 29 years her senior.\n\nGeneral Burbeck purchased a home at 114 Main St., in New London, Connecticut, in 1815. The house was built in 1735 and was one of the few houses in New London that remained after the city was burned by the British in 1781. Gen. Burbeck and his wife lived in the house until he died in 1848.\n\nIn 1846, being one of the very few surviving officers who had served in the Revolution, Burbeck was elected president of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati and served in that position until his death two years later.\n\nBurbeck and his second wife had six children, all born in New London: Susan Henrietta (b. September 23, 1815), Charlotte Augusta (b. March 8, 1818 in New London, Conn., d. July 13, 1897 in New London, Conn.), Henry William (b. May 31, 1819 in New London, Conn., d. February 19, 1840 at sea), Mary Elizabeth (b. March 7, 1821 in New London, Conn., d. July 13, 1897), William Henry (b. October 8, 1823 in New London, Conn., d. February 28, 1905 in New London, Conn.) and John Cathcart (b. February 9, 1825 in New London, Conn., d. April 28, 1904 in New London, Conn.).\n\nBurbeck hoped that his son Henry would follow in his military footsteps, but Henry died when he tried to test his strength by lifting a keg of silver dollars which fell on his foot and severed his toe while at sea on a revenue cutter. By the time the cutter reached New York and a physician was summoned, it was too late and he died. Thereafter, Gen. Burbeck was so overcome by grief that he would not have his son's name spoken in his house.\n\nIn his later years, he enjoyed the company of Capt. Bulkeley who also retired to New London. They maintained a close relationship despite the fact that Burbeck was a Whig and Bulkeley was a Democrat.\n\nBurbeck died at his home on Main Street on October 2, 1848, in New London, Connecticut just months after his friend Capt. Bulkeley died. The Massachusetts Society of Cincinnati, of which Burbeck was a member, erected a monument to him in Cedar Grove Cemetery (Sec. 4, Lot 1), New London, Connecticut. The inscription on the monument states:\nThe Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati Dedicate This Monument to the Memory of Their Late Honored President. He Was An Officer of the Army From the Commencement of the Revolutionary War Until The Close of His Life By a Patriotic and Faithful Discharge of the High and Responsible Duties of a Gallant Soldier And An Exemplary Citizen He Has Been Justly And Eminently Distinguished As He Was Rightfully and Universally Respected.\nHis wife Lucy died February 22, 1880, in New London and at the time of her death was one of the last in the nation to receive a Revolutionary War pension which was $130 a quarter in 1875. Burbeck's daughter Charlotte was made an honorary member of the Lucretia Shaw chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.\n\nGen. Henry Burbeck was nominated into the Connecticut Hall of Fame on February 24, 2016. It was Wyatt Kopp, a cousin of Lucy Rudd Burbeck, who nominated him back in 2013. He was finally accepted into the Hall of Fame in 2016. The Connecticut Hall of Fame is located at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford, Connecticut which is directly linked to the state capital building. The ceremony for his induction into the Connecticut Hall of Fame will be held on March 7, 2016 at the Legislative Office Building.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1868264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868264", "title": "Deviationism", "text": "Deviationism\n\nIn political ideology, a deviationist is a person who expresses a deviation: an abnormality or departure. In Stalinist ideology and practice, deviationism is an expressed belief which does not accord with official party doctrine for the time and area. Accusations of deviationism often led to purges. Forms of deviationism included revisionism, dogmatism, bourgeois nationalism, and rootless cosmopolitanism.\n\nMao Zedong in a 1953 speech referred to both \"left\" and \"right\" deviationists. Years later, in 1976, the so-called Gang of Four would strike out against \"rightist deviationism\" in China.\n\nLeon Trotsky believed that Lenin's pre-1917 idea of the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" needed to be re-worded to emphasize the importance of the proletariat's leadership in such an alliance, because the peasantry were dialectically less capable of leadership. In order to finish a socialist revolution, the revolution would have to be world-wide. This is in sharp contrast to Joseph Stalin's idea of \"socialism in one country;\" Trotsky felt that if a socialist nation-state was isolated, it would soon be destroyed by outside imperialist forces. Trotsky emphasized the importance of soviets (independent councils of workers) and the idea that a communist society will be a \"workers' democracy\".\n\nAccording to Trotskyist doctrine, the Soviet Union became a \"degenerated workers state\" and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) as \"bureaucratic centralist\". Trotskyites considered the Soviet degenerated workers state still as \"revolutionary workers' state\" or \"proletarian dictatorship\". As such, the Soviet state was \"historically progressive\" in relation to \"reactionary capitalism\". Hence it was the duty of revolutionists in all nations, even if they were opponents of Stalin and his regime, to defend the Soviet Union against any \"imperialist\" state, including their own fatherland. Another revolution was necessary however to unseat the Stalinists, who would destroy the workers state until it became fully capitalist.\n\nBefore World War II the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) had always received directives and funds from the Soviet Union via courier. Moscow's most effective control had been through Comintern representatives.\n\nEarl Browder, CPUSA leader, accepted the Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939 without hesitation. Comintern did find it necessary to fine-tune the CPUSA's stance. Immediately after the Pact, Georgi Dimitrov, chief of the Comintern, sent a ciphered message to Browder explaining that the CPUSA's line supporting the Pact was not fully correct because while it broke with President Franklin Roosevelt's policy of supporting Britain, France, and Lend-Lease aid, it failed to take the additional step of breaking with FDR's domestic policies as well. Browder and the CPUSA immediately made the required changes in its policies, and in 1940 the CPUSA did its best to oppose FDR's reelection to the presidency.\n\nWorld War II reduced the direct organization ties of CPUSA to Comintern and drastically reduced the volume of communications. Postal communications was less reliable and often delayed and subject to government inspection. International cable traffic was routinely reviewed by war-time security officials. Travel to the USSR became increasingly difficult. In 1940 the Voorhis Act was passed imposing regulatory requirements on domestic American organizations with foreign government ties. To avoid the Voorhis Act, in November 1940, CPUSA, with Comintern permission, severed its official membership in the Communist International, and the last officially designated CPUSA representative in Moscow left in 1941.\n\nBrowder developed the doctrine of indefinite collaboration with capitalism and the Harry Bridges doctrine of postwar extension of the no-strike pledge.\n\nThe wartime coalition gave Browder the vision of an Americanized Communist Party working with other American parties to solve the urgent questions facing the nation. To this end he began a policy of naturalizing the party, relaxing its discipline, and moderating its sectarianism. He transformed the wartime tactic of national unity into a postwar strategy and argued the possibility that progressive capitalism, to save itself, would embark on policies favorable to the workers at home and to the Soviet Union abroad.\n\nIn April 1945, however, Jacques Duclos of the French Communist Party, formerly high in the Comintern, published a repudiation of Browderism.\nPublication of the attack by the \"New York World-Telegram\" panicked the CPUSA into drastic action against Browder: they unceremoniously expelled him in February 1946.\n\nTitoism is a form of Leninism based on the regime of Marshal Josip Broz Tito post-World War II in Yugoslavia. While formerly heading a Comintern liberation movement, after the war Tito broke with Moscow and insisted Yugoslavia was to be non-aligned with neither NATO nor the Warsaw Pact. Tito called for \"national unity\" and \"self-management\" which enabled Yugoslavia to form relationships independent of the superpowers with other governments during the Cold War.\n\nMaoism mixes orthodox Marxism–Leninism with populism. Named after its originator Mao Zedong, the ideology relies on militant, insurrectionary and populist strategies in movement organizing (People's Wars, Cultural Revolution, Peasant Uprising, etc.). Like Stalin, Mao's China relied on Five-Year Plans, the best-known of which was the Great Leap Forward. \n\nThis view of the CCP contrasted sharply with the view of Moscow whose ideology was in line with orthodoxy of historical materialism of Marxism's early thinkers, that socialist societies must be preceded by capitalist societies, which would provide the material basis for a socialist economy. This orthodox theory of Marxism relied heavily on a dialectical \"force of history\" that would inevitably bring about the \"objective conditions\" necessary for a proletarian revolution to succeed. Any ideological concepts running counter to this thesis, that is, any formulations which called for skipping stages of historic development were considered in the orthodox view as adventuristic and counter revolutionary.\n\nMaoist deviationism inspired students and other young people who looked to the Chinese Red Guards as a model of activism. While some of these young activists were drawn to the Progressive Labor Party (PLP), the full flowering of American Maoism would not come until the proliferation of new groups such as the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Weather Underground (WUO), Black Panthers (BPP) and the Communist Party (Marxist–Leninist) (CP-ML) after 1969.\n\nThe term has also been used with respect to other ideologies. In 2002 the Religious Affairs Minister of Brunei in Southeast Asia used the same term to describe what he considered to be incorrect, presumably non-mainstream Islamic teachings.\n"}

{"id": "1868301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868301", "title": "Mandopop", "text": "Mandopop\n\nMandopop refers to Mandarin popular music. The genre has its origin in the jazz-influenced popular music of the 1930s Shanghai known as Shidaiqu, later influences came from Japanese enka, Hong Kong's Cantopop, and Taiwan's Hokkien pop — in particular the Campus Song folk movement of the 1970s. In contemporary times, it has become strongly influenced by K-pop. 'Mandopop' may be used as a general term to describe popular songs performed in Mandarin. The English term was coined around 1980 soon after \"Cantopop\" became a popular term for describing popular songs in Cantonese; \"Mandopop\" was used to describe Mandarin-language popular songs of that time, some of which were versions of Cantopop songs sung by the same singers with different lyrics to suit the different rhyme and tonal patterns of Mandarin. \n\nMandopop is categorized as a subgenre of commercial Chinese-language music within C-pop. Popular music sung in Mandarin was the first variety of popular music in Chinese to establish itself as a viable industry. It originated in Shanghai, and later Hong Kong, Taipei and Beijing also emerged as important centers of the Mandopop music industry. Among the countries where Mandopop is most popular are mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam.\n\nThe Chinese-language music industry began with the arrival of gramophone, and the earliest gramophone recording in China was made in Shanghai in March 1903 by Fred Gaisberg who was sent by the Victor Talking Machine Company (VTMC) in the U.S. to record local music in Asia. The recordings were then manufactured outside China and re-imported by the Gramophone Company's sales agent in China, the Moutrie (Moudeli) Foreign Firm. The Moudeli Company dominated the market before the 1910s until the Pathé Records () took over the leading role. Pathé was founded in 1908 by a Frenchman named Labansat who had previously started a novelty entertainment business using phonograph in Shanghai around the beginning of the 20th century. The company established a recording studio, and the first record-pressing plant in the Shanghai French Concession in 1914, and became the principal record company to serve as the backbone for the young industry in China. It originally recorded mainly Peking opera, but later expanded to Mandarin popular music. Later other foreign as well as Chinese-own recording companies were also established in China.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, people in China generally spoke in their own regional dialect. Although most people in Shanghai then spoke Shanghainese, the recordings of the pop music from Shanghai from the 1920s onwards were done in Standard Mandarin, which is based on the Beijing dialect. Mandarin was then considered as the language of the modern, educated class in China, and there was a movement to popularize the use of Mandarin as a national language in the pursuit of national unity. Those involved in this movement included songwriters such as Li Jinhui working in Shanghai. The drive to impose linguistic uniformity in China started in the early 20th century when the Qing Ministry of Education proclaimed Mandarin as the official speech to be taught in modern schools, a policy the new leaders of the Chinese Republic formed in 1912 were also committed to. Sound films in Shanghai which started in the early 1930s were made in Mandarin because of a ban on the use of dialects in films by the then Nanjing government, consequently popular songs from films were also performed in Mandarin.\n\nMandarin popular songs that started in the 1920s were called \"shidaiqu\" (時代曲 - meaning music of the time, thus popular music), and Shanghai was the center of its production. The Mandarin popular songs of the Shanghai era are considered by scholars to be the first kind of modern popular music developed in China, and the prototype of later Chinese pop song. Li Jinhui is generally regarded as the \"Father of Chinese Popular Music\" who established the genre in the 1920s. Buck Clayton, the American jazz musician, also worked alongside Li. Li established the Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe, and amongst their singing stars were Wang Renmei and Li Lili. There was a close relationship between music and film industries and many of its singers also became actresses.\n\nAround 1927, Li composed the hit song \"The Drizzle\" (\"毛毛雨\") recorded by his daughter Li Minghui (黎明暉), and this song is often regarded as the first Chinese pop song. The song, with its fusion of jazz and Chinese folk music, exemplifies the early \"shidaiqu\" - the tune is in the style of a traditional pentatonic folk melody, but the instrumentation is similar to that of an American jazz orchestra. The song however was sung in a high-pitched childlike style, a style described uncharitably as sounding like \"strangling cat\" by the writer Lu Xun. This early style would soon be replaced by more sophisticated performances from better-trained singers. In the following decades, various popular Western music genres such as Latin dance music also become incorporated into Chinese popular music, producing a type of music containing both Chinese and Western elements that characterized \"shidaiqu\". Popular songs of the time may range from those that were composed in the traditional Chinese idiom but followed a Western principle of composition to those that were done largely in a Western style, and they may be accompanied by traditional Chinese or Western instrumentation.\n\nIn 1931, the first sound film was made in China in a cooperation between the Mingxing Film Company and Pathé. The film industry took advantage of the sound era and engaged singers for acting and soundtrack roles, and Li Jinhui's Bright Moonlight Song and Dance Troup became the first modern musical division to be integrated into the Chinese film industry when it joined Lianhua Film Company in 1931. Amongst the best-known of the singer-actress to emerge in the 1930s were Zhou Xuan, Gong Qiuxia, and Bai Hong. Although later singing stars need not also have an acting career, the close relationship between the recording and film industries continued for many decades. Later Yao Lee, Bai Guang, Li Xianglan, Wu Yingyin also became popular, and collectively these seven stars became known as the \"Seven Great Singing Stars\" of the period. Other notable singers of this period include Li Lihua and Chang Loo (張露). In 1940 Yao Lee recorded \"Rose, Rose, I Love You\" which later became the first Chinese pop song to be covered by Western singers that was a hit.\nThe \"Seven Great Singing Stars\" in the Republic of China period secured the place of the \"shidaiqu\" genre in East Asian society. Zhou Xuan is generally considered the most notable Chinese pop star of the era for her highly successful singing and film career. This generation saw the rise in popularity of female singers from mere \"song girls\" to \"stars\", and for the next few decades, female singers would dominate the Mandarin popular music industry.\n\nIn this period, Pathé Records dominated the recording industry. In the late 1930s to early 1940s, it held about 90% market share of the Mandarin pop songs.\n\nThe era was a tumultuous period, with the occupation of Shanghai by the Japanese armies during the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1937 and to 1945, followed by continuation of the civil war between the Nationalists and Communists. In response to the turmoil, productions began to shift to Hong Kong, and after the Communist takeover in 1949, many stars moved to Hong Kong which then replaced Shanghai as the center of the entertainment industry in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1949, the People's Republic of China was established by the Communist party, and popular music was denounced by the PRC government as Yellow Music, a form of pornography. In the mainland, the communist regime began to suppress popular music and promote revolutionary songs. China Record Corporation became the only music recording industry body in China, and for many years Minyue (National Music) and revolutionary music were about the only kinds of music to be recorded there.\nIn 1952, Pathé Records moved its operation from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Stars from Shanghai continued to record songs in Hong Kong, and Shanghai-style music remained popular in Hong Kong until the mid-1960s. Although the music is a continuation of the shidaiqu style of Shanghai, many of its songwriters did not moved to Hong Kong, and many of the musicians employed in the Hong Kong music industry were Filipinos, Mandarin pop music in Hong Kong began to move away from its Shanghai roots. Also partly as a consequence of having fewer good songwriters, some songs of this period were adaptation of English-language songs, as well as songs from other regions such as the Indonesian song \"Bengawan Solo\" (as \"梭羅河之戀\") and the Latin-American song \"Historia de un Amor\" (as \"He is not in my heart\", \"我的心裡沒有他\"). As the style evolved, the sound of popular songs from the Hong Kong era therefore became distinct from Shanghai's. Among the recording artists of note to emerge in this period were Tsui Ping, Tsin Ting, Grace Chang (葛蘭), Fong Tsin Ying (方靜音) and Liu Yun (劉韻), some of whom were also actress. While some actress continued to sing in their film, some of the best known songs were dubbed by other singers, for example \"Unforgettable Love\" (\"不了情\") in the film of the same name starring Lin Dai was sung by Koo Mei (顧媚).\n\nShanghai-style Mandarin pop songs however began to decline in popularity around the mid-1960s as Western pop music became popular among the young, and many Hong Kong performers copied Western songs and sang Hong Kong English pop songs. This in turn gave way to pop songs recorded in Cantonese as Cantopop became the dominant genre of music from Hong Kong in the 1970s.\n\nAfter the Communist victory in China, the Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan. There were local stars in Taiwan and Pathé Records did business there as well, but the island's recording industry was not initially strong. Taiwanese youth were drawn to popular styles from abroad; as Taiwan was ruled by Japan from 1895 to 1945, Taiwanese pop songs in the Hokkien dialect, the actual mother tongue of most of the island's residents, were particularly strongly influenced by the Japanese Enka music. Popular Mandarin songs from Taiwan were similarly influenced, and many popular Mandarin songs of the 1960s were adaptations of Japanese songs, for example \"Hard to Forget the Thought\" (\"意難忘\", originally ) and \"Hate you to the Bone\" (\"恨你入骨\", from ). Popular songs were necessarily sung in Mandarin as Taiwan's new rulers, which imposed martial law in Taiwan in 1949, mandated its use as well as restricting the use of Taiwanese Hokkien and forbidding the use of Japanese. The Mandarin pop music developed in Taiwan that would become modern Mandopop is a blend of traditional Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, as well as Western musical styles. Zi Wei (紫薇) was the earliest of the Taiwan-based stars who achieved success outside of Taiwan in the late 1950s with the song \"Green Island Serenade\", followed by other singers such as Mei Dai (美黛) and Yao Surong (姚蘇蓉) in the 1960s. The 1960s however was a highly politically tense era, many songs such as \"Not Going Home Today\" (\"今天不回家\") by Yao Surong were banned in Taiwan.\n\nIn the 1960s, regional centres of Chinese pop music also started to emerge in overseas Chinese communities in Malaysia and Singapore, and singers from the region such as Poon Sow Keng (潘秀瓊) also achieved wider success.\n\nIn the 1970s, Taipei began to take center stage as Cantopop took hold in Hong Kong. In 1966, the Taiwan music industry was generating US$4.7 million annually, and this had grown exponentially through the 1970s and 1980s, and by 1996, it peaked at just under US$500 million before declining. The success of the Taiwanese film industry also helped with the popularity of its singers. Taiwanese stars such as Tsai Chin, Fei Yu-ching, and Fong Fei Fei became increasingly popular, with Teresa Teng the best known. However, the importance of Hong Kong as a center meant that some of these Taiwanese stars such as Teresa Teng were still Hong Kong-based.\n\nTeresa Teng made Mandopop a true mainstay by crossing over to mainland China after Deng Xiaoping came to power and instituted the open door policy in 1978 that allowed cultural products from Hong Kong and Taiwan to enter China. Teng's song became popular there despite an early ban on her songs by the PRC government for being \"Bourgeois Music\". Her \"soft, sweet, often whispery and restrained\" singing style in romantic songs such as \"The Moon Represents My Heart\" (月亮代表我的心) made a strong impact in mainland China where revolutionary songs were previously prevalent. A common expression then was \"By day, Deng Xiaoping rules China. But by night, Deng Lijun (Teresa Teng) rules\". The ban on Teng was lifted in 1986 and songs from Hong Kong and Taiwan, called \"gangtai\" music, became more popular within mainland China.\n\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, a different generation of Taiwanese singers and/or songwriters such as Chyi Yu, Hou Dejian, and Lo Ta-yu emerged, some of whom were influenced by folk rock and whose music may be termed \"campus folk music\". One of the most successful songs of the era was Lo Ta-yu's 1985 song \"Tomorrow Will Be Better\", which was inspired by the American song \"We Are the World\" and originally performed by 60 singers. It quickly became a hit throughout Asia and established itself as a standard. Another song soon followed in 1986 in mainland China called \"Let the World be filled with Love\" (讓世界充滿愛). Hou Dejian's song \"Descendants of the Dragon\" (龍的傳人) also became an anthem for the period. Unlike previous eras dominated by female singers, male singers are now popular, and other popular male singers included Liu Wen-cheng and Dave Wong. Wong released his Chinese debut album A Game A Dream (一場遊戲一場夢), which sold over 500,000-copies in December 1987. By around 1980, the term Mandopop began to be used for the Chinese popular music that had emerged in this period. Many Cantopop songs of the period were also sung in Mandarin by the same singers.\n\nIn South East Asia, popular local stars from the late 60s to the 80s included Sakura Teng (樱花), Zhang Xiaoying (張小英) and Lena Lim (林竹君) from Singapore, and Wong Shiau Chuen (黃曉君) and Lee Yee (李逸) from Malaysia. Some such as Lena Lim achieved some success outside the region, and the local labels also signed singers from outside the region such as Long Piao-Piao (龍飄飄) from Taiwan. The recording industry in Singapore in particular thrived. In 1979, Singapore launched the Speak Mandarin Campaign to promote the use of Mandarin over the range of Chinese dialects spoken by various segments of the ethnic-Chinese population. Mandarin songs, already a strong presence on radio stations and on television, further eroded the popularity of Hokkien and Cantonese songs in the media. In the 1980s, a genre of Mandarin ballads called \"xinyao\" developed in Singapore by singers/songwriters such as Liang Wern Fook.\n\nIn mainland China, the music industry was freed from state restriction in 1978, and regional recording companies were established in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing in the 1980s with local singers. Pop music in China in this period was dominated by Mandopop songs from Taiwan and Cantopop from Hong Kong, however the 1980s saw the beginning of rock music in China, with the emergence of singer-songwriters such as Cui Jian, followed by others such as He Yong and bands such as Tang Dynasty which became popular in the 1990s.\n\nA number of singers originally from mainland China such as Faye Wong and Na Ying began to record in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Faye Wong, referred to in the media as the Diva, first recorded in Cantonese in Hong Kong, later recorded in Mandarin. She became the first Chinese singer to perform in Budokan, Japan.\n\nDuring this period, many Cantopop singers from Hong Kong such as the \"Four Heavenly Kings\" - Aaron Kwok, Leon Lai, Andy Lau and Jacky Cheung - also began to dominate Mandopop. One of the best-selling Mandarin albums was the 1993 album \"The Goodbye Kiss\" by Jacky Cheung which sold over 1 million in Taiwan and 4 million in total Asia-wide. Nonetheless, Taiwan has their own popular singers such as Stella Chang, Sky Wu, Wakin Chau (formerly Emil Chau) and Jeff Chang. Independent labels such as Rock Records began to establish themselves in this period as some of the most influential labels. Towards the end of the 90s, other singers such as Leehom Wang and David Tao became popular, and some also began to perform in the R&B and/or hip-hop genres.\n\nIn the period from the mid-1990s to early 2000s, Shanghai and Beijing became centers of the music industry in mainland China, with Shanghai focusing on music record publishing and distribution, while Beijing focused on music recording.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the Four Heavenly Kings faded in the 2000s, but many other new artists such as Nicholas Tse and Eason Chan came to the fore.\nThe 2000s also began with an explosion of pop idols, many of whom are from Taiwan. Mainland China also saw a rapid increase in the number of Mandopop singers, bands, and idol groups as pop music becomes increasingly mainstream by mid-2000s. The growing Mainland film industry and Chinese television drama also increased demand for Mandopop. Since the 2000s, the emergence of indie rock in mainland China and Taiwan had exploded into a flourishing indie music scene in mainland China and Taiwan, adding various new diversities into Mandopop. Entry of popular Taiwan-based bands such as Mayday and Sodagreen while in mainland Chinese-based bands such as SuperVC and Milk Coffee had brought a new phase of rock fusion into Mandopop.\n\nThe music industry in Taiwan, however, began to suffer from music piracy in the digital age, and its revenue plummeted to $US95 million in 2005. The primary revenue sources in Taiwan music industry shifted to advertising, concerts, KTV (karaoke) and movie. The dramatic decline of CD sales shifted the market in favour of mainland China. While piracy was also severe in mainland China, the percentage of its digital sales is higher compared to most countries. 2005 was known as 'The First Year of Digital Music' in China as its digital music sales of $US57 million overtook CDs in 2005, and it also overtook Taiwan in term of the retail value of its music sales.\nHowever, while mainland China became increasingly important in generating revenue, the pop music industry itself in mainland China was still relatively small in the decade of 2000s compared to Taiwan and Hong Kong as popstars from Taiwan and other overseas Chinese communities were still popular in mainland China. Mandopop singers such as Jay Chou was popular performing in the rhythm and blues and rap music genre, popularising a new fusion style of music known as zhongguofeng. Other successful singers include Stefanie Sun and Jolin Tsai. Many Cantopop singers also turned towards Mandopop industry due to disputes among entertainment and record companies in Hong Kong and to increase their fan base.\n\nIn recent years, the burgeoning number of contests have brought an idol concept (偶像, \"ǒuxiàng\") to the Mandopop industry. Nationwide singing competitions in mainland China, such as the Super Girl, Super Boy, The Voice of China, Chinese Idol, and , have greatly boosted Mandopop's influence many contestants emerge as successful singers such as Joker Xue, Jane Zhang, Bella Yao, Chris Lee (Li Yuchun), Jason Zhang, Chen Chusheng, Momo Wu Mochou, Laure Shang Wenjie, etc. The same phenomenon also occurred in Taiwan, from the show One Million Star and Super Idol, new talented singers has entered the Mandopop market, including Aska Yang, Yoga Lin, Lala Hsu and so on. In Taiwan, the term \"quality idol\" (優質偶像, \"yōuzhì ǒuxiàng\") has entered the popular lexicon, referring to Mandopop singers who are good-looking, talented and highly educated, among them Wang Leehom and William Wei.\n\nRecent years also saw the rise in crossover appeal of Taiwanese bubblegum pop boybands and girlbands to the mainland Chinese scene, such as the very commercially successful acts like S.H.E and Fahrenheit. Several new boybands and girlbands also have emerged in mainland China such as Top Combine, TFBOYS and \"Idol Producer\" boy groups including Nine Percent, NEX7 and Oner.\n\nShidaiqu originated as a fusion of Chinese traditional music and European popular music, and therefore instruments from both genres were used from the very beginning of Mandopop. Songs performed in the traditional style employed traditional Chinese instruments like the erhu, pipa, and sanxian, such as in the recording of \"The Wandering Songstress\" (天涯歌女) by Zhou Xuan, whereas more Western orchestral instruments such as trumpets, violins, and piano were used in songs like \"Shanghai Nights\" (夜上海), also by Zhou Xuan. Big band and jazz instruments and orchestrations from the swing era were common in the early years. Chinese and Western instruments were also combined in some recordings.\n\nIn the 1960s, the electric guitar began to be used. Starting around the 1970s, electronic organs/synthesizers began to be heavily featured, which characterized the Mandopop music of the era. Today's Mandopop arrangements are generally westernized, covering many musical styles, including rhythm and blues, ballads, and Pop. Mandopop switched from simple imitation to adjusting the melodies and lyrics creatively in short time. Some pop stars became famous because they were presented to meet the Chinese aesthetics standard and culture features. A few Chinese pop musicians—most notably Jay Chou, Lin Jun Jie, David Tao, Leehom Wang —have experimented with fusing traditional Chinese instruments with Western styles (such as hip hop beats and progressive rock) all over again in a new style known as China Wind music (\"zhongguofeng\"), influencing many Asian singers worldwide.\n\nPopular music record labels includes independent labels such as JVR Music, Linfair Records, B'In Music and subsidiaries of major labels such as Sony Music Taiwan, Universal Music Taiwan, Warner Music Taiwan. In the past few years, mainland labels such as EE-Media, Huayi Brothers, Taihe Rye Music, Show City Times, Idol Entertainment, and Tian Hao Entertainment have also emerged.\n\nMandopop titles are also available outside of Asia. Chinese communities established in North America have made Mandopop music accessible through local businesses. In the United States, Canada and Australia they are easily found in many major urban areas, such as San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, San Diego, New York City, Vancouver, Toronto, Sydney, and Melbourne .\n\nThe Global Chinese Pop Chart is a record chart organised since 2001 by 7 radio stations from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nIn Taiwan, G-Music Chart (Chinese: 風雲榜 fēngyúnbǎng) is the most popular music ranking. It was first officially published on 7 July 2005, and compiled the top physically sold CD releases in Taiwan (including both albums and physically released singles). Only the top 20 positions are published, and instead of sales, a percentage ranking is listed next to each release.\n\n\n"}

It lies just past the southeastern limb, and can sometimes be viewed from Earth under favorable conditions of libration and illumination. The crater is located to the northeast of the older walled plain Curie, and to the southwest of Pasteur, another walled plain.\n\nThis is a prominent crater with a well-defined rim and little appearance of wear from impact erosion. The edge forms a rough circle, but it is irregular with a number of small outward bulges, particularly to the south and southwest. The small crater Sklodowska J intrudes slightly into the southeastern rim.\n\nThe inner walls have a system of multiple terraces, and there are some slumped shelves along the northeastern side. The inner wall is somewhat narrower along the north and wider to the south and northeast. Within the crater the interior floor is a nearly level plain that is marked by a number of small craterlets. There is a prominent central peak formation at the crater midpoint, which consists of two ridges separated by a narrow valley. The larger of the two peaks lies to the northeast of the center, while the smaller is to the southwest.\n\nThis crater gained its title from the birth name of Maria Skłodowska-Curie, the Polish-born French scientist.\n\nBy convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Sklodowska.\n\nL&PI topographic maps of crater:\n"}

As such, it is sometimes classified as just a variant of the Model 1861. The Model 1861, with all of its variants, was the most commonly used longarm in the American Civil War, with over 700,000 manufactured. The Model 1863 also has the distinction of being the last muzzle-loading longarm produced by the Springfield Armory.\n\nThe Model 1863 was produced in two variants. The Type I eliminated the band springs and replaced the flat barrel bands with oval clamping bands. It also featured a new ramrod, a case-hardened lock, a new hammer, and a redesigned bolster (percussion chamber). Several of these modifications were based upon Colt's contract model 1861, known as the \"Colt special\". 273,265 Type I variants were manufactured in 1863.\n\nThe Type II is sometimes referred to as the Model 1864, but is more commonly referred to as just a variant of the Model 1863. This version re-introduced band springs, replaced the clamping bands with solid oval bands, and replaced the three leaf rear sight with single leaf sight. A total of 255,040 of these were manufactured from 1864 to 1865.\n\nBy the end of the Civil War, muzzle-loading rifles and muskets were considered obsolete. In the years following the Civil War, many Model 1863 muskets were converted into breech-loading \"Trapdoor Springfields\". The breech-loading weapons increased the rate of fire from three to four rounds per minute to eight to ten rounds per minute. The Model 1863 could be converted to breech-loading for about five dollars, at a time when a new rifle would cost about twenty dollars. The conversion of Model 1863 rifles therefore represented a significant cost savings to the U.S. military. (The US Military never adopted the converted Springfields although many were used by various European militaries)\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1868310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868310", "title": "L.A.M.F.", "text": "L.A.M.F.\n\nL.A.M.F. is the only studio album by the American band The Heartbreakers, which included Johnny Thunders, Jerry Nolan, Walter Lure and Billy Rath. The music is a mixture of punk and rock and roll.\n\n\"L.A.M.F.\" stands for \"Like a Mother Fucker\"; in a 1977 interview in the UK monthly magazine \"Zigzag\", Thunders said this originated from New York gang graffiti. Thunders claimed the gangs would add the LAMF tag after writing their gang name. However, if they were on another gang's territory they would write \"D.T.K.L.A.M.F\" (Down to Kill Like a Mother Fucker). The original, vinyl release of the album has been criticised for having a lackluster sound despite several attempts to remix it.\n\nThe Heartbreakers had been trying to get a record contract in the United States since their formation in 1975.\n\nIn the autumn of 1976, Malcolm McLaren, who had informally managed the New York Dolls in their waning days, invited the band to come to England and participate in the Sex Pistols' Anarchy tour, along with The Clash and The Damned, who were replaced by Buzzcocks shortly after the tour commenced. The band accepted the offer, arriving in London on December 1, the same day that the Pistols swore at Bill Grundy on live, prime-time television, which precipitated the cancellation of most of the tour.\n\nStranded in England with little money after the Anarchy tour came to a halt, the band contemplated a retreat to New York, but their manager, Leee Black Childers, convinced them to stay in England, believing that they would be more successful there. After several gigs in London, Track Records offered the Heartbreakers a recording contract.\n\nTrack asked the band to sign to the company as \"The Chris Stamp Band Ltd.\" a holding company owned by Track, with the proviso that if that holding company went out of business, the rights to any recordings the band made would revert to the band's own business partnership. The band agreed and signed on to Track.\n\nThe band prepared for the album with a three-day demo session at Essex Studios in late February 1977, followed by two live shows at London's Speakeasy Club, which were recorded by Track Records for future release.\n\nSix songs: \"All By Myself\", \"Let Go\", \"Get Off The Phone\", \"I Wanna Be Loved\", \"Can't Keep My Eyes On You\", and \"I Love You\" were recorded at Essex with Track staff producer Speedy Keen. The band then switched to Ramport Studios (owned by The Who) to record eight more songs. During a break in the recording, the Who's Pete Townshend invited the Heartbreakers to appear as extras in the movie version of \"Quadrophenia\".\n\nMixing the recording was problematic. The band went to different studios, each member trying their own mixes. Each mix would be considered and rejected, after which band members returned to the studio to try to remix it. The band was later alleged to have used taxicabs to commute between London and Birmingham, billed to Track Records, to replenish their drug supply. The mixing sessions lasted through the summer of 1977, as they continued playing live.\n\n\"L.A.M.F.\" would be released by Track Records on October 3, 1977. Critic Jon Savage wrote in \"Sounds\" magazine, \"The sounds (mostly) are great, the playing assured ... so what's the problem? The mixing. The fantasy that they are includes an element of self-destruction, and here's where it operates — they can't seem to get it quite right ... Whichever way, some of the songs ... sound muddy — irritating 'cause you know how good they be.\"\n\nJerry Nolan told the rest of the band that if the album was released \"without a proper mix\", he would see no reason to remain in the band. Nolan quit during a UK tour, during which time Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook filled in, until Nolan was asked to return as a hired hand.\n\nMusic critic Robert Christgau named the album one of the few import-only records from the 1970s he loved yet omitted from \"\" (1981).\n\nAfter Track Records went out of business, manager Leee Black Childers acquired The Heartbreakers' tapes; the Essex demos, the Speakeasy live recordings and the masters from the \"L.A.M.F.\" sessions, including thirty-five reels full of various mixes, from the Track Records offices, due in part to the contract provision the band signed early in 1977.\n\nIn 1982, the rights to The Heartbreakers' tapes were acquired from Childers, acting on behalf of the band partnership, by Jungle Records, an independent English label. Jungle convinced Thunders and former Generation X bassist Tony James (then with Sigue Sigue Sputnik) to remix \"L.A.M.F.\".\n\nJohnny Thunders died in 1991 and Jerry Nolan died in 1992.\n\nIn 1994, Jungle Records executive Alan Hauser had The Heartbreakers' tapes reviewed, and had the best available mixes preserved on Digital Audio Tape. It was soon discovered by Hauser that many of the original mixes left behind by The Heartbreakers were best suited to the band's protopunk sound, while others had a sound similar to sixties pop hits. It was realized that the problem with the sound on the original Track Records release of \"L.A.M.F.\" was due to the manufacturing of the vinyl records. A rare cassette edition, released by Track at the same time, was said to \"[sound] as if it had a shower, shave, coffee and a cigarette\" (liner notes of 2002 reissue by Nina Antonia, p. 10).\n\nThe 300-plus available mixes were narrowed down to a shortlist of 50 tracks, and London-area friends and colleagues of Johnny Thunders, including sometime Thunders collaborator Patti Palladin and journalist Nina Antonia, were asked for their input.\n\nThe first edition of what is sometimes referred to as \"L.A.M.F.: The Lost '77 Mixes\" was released by Jungle in 1994. Eight years later, a remastered edition, appended with an MPEG video of \"Chinese Rocks\", was released. In 2012 Jungle released \"L.A.M.F.: Definitive Edition\".\n\n\n\n\n\n(*)Note: The original Track Records version of \"L.A.M.F.\" credited Dee Dee Ramone, Johnny Thunders, Jerry Nolan and Richard Hell with the writing of \"Chinese Rocks\". Jungle Records corrected this error for their 1994 and subsequent editions of the album, providing the credit attributing the song's authorship to Joey, Johnny and Dee Dee Ramone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As well as his solo career, he is known for being the frontman of Murderdolls. He has also played in several other bands, including Maniac Spider Trash, Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13, Bourbon Crow, and Gunfire 76.\n\nPoole's musical career began in 1992 when he played guitar in the band Mizery, which later became Psycho Opera and which featured guitarist Abby Normal, drummer Jeff Washam, bassist Michael Patrick, and lead vocalist Todd Cage. Poole left the band to form Maniac Spider Trash as lead vocalist, alongside Abby Normal (again on guitar) and Michael Patrick (also filling his earlier role as bassist), joined by Sicko Zero on drums. Poole fronted the band from 1992 to 1996. The band released one EP, \"Dumpster Mummies\", on Dead Hell Records in 1994. This was followed by an album, \"Murder Happy Fairytales\", in 1995; the album remained unreleased until October 5, 2010.\n\nPoole went on to form the Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13, which included Maniac Spider Trash's guitarist and drummer, Abby Normal and Sicko Zero. The band featured several different guitarists, bassists, and drummers over the years, leaving Poole to continue as the only original member. Sicko Zero was the last member to quit the band. Shortly after, Poole was forced to form another line-up before joining Murderdolls. Poole wrote and produced every album by Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13. Between 1996 and 2002, Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13 released five studio albums and six EPs with various revolving members. They were also featured on tribute albums for Alice Cooper, and Sweet. Poole stopped performing under the name in 2002 when he joined Murderdolls. In May 2006, the band announced their reunion, which was followed by a tour with Alice Cooper and a box set of the band's complete discography, entitled \"Little Box of Horrors\". This line-up featured Sicko Zero on drums and Abby Normal on bass. The band broke up once again shortly after the box set was released.\n\nPoole was contacted by Joey Jordison of Slipknot and was asked to join Jordison's new horror punk band, Murderdolls. Originally formed as a collaboration between Jordison and Tripp Eisen of Static-X and Dope, Poole was revealed as the driving force of the band after he switched from bass guitar to lead vocalist. Murderdolls released one EP in 2002, \"Right to Remain Violent\", to promote their forthcoming album of the same year, \"Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls\". Most of the songs on the album were re-recorded versions of songs by Poole's previous band, Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13. A total of two singles were released from the album, including a cover of Billy Idol's \"White Wedding\". The album reached No. 40 on the UK album chart.\n\nMurderdolls played their last show on January 17, 2004. After this, they went on an indefinite hiatus, with Jordison returning to Slipknot. Since this hiatus began, both Poole and Jordison maintained that the band did not split up for good, and that they would return to record a second album in the future. In February 2010, while on a solo tour in Australia, Poole spoke with Drum Media: \"We're possibly going to do another Wednesday record, record it in the summer and have it out around Halloween. We're in talks right now to do another Murderdolls album. So right now I don't know which of the two is going to happen, of course if Murderdolls is possible then we have to do that, it's gotta be the number one priority. It's just talks right now. We're having the same conversations that we were having in the very beginning of the band. Right now, we're just trying to get a game plan together.\"\n\nIn March 2010, Jordison revealed to \"Kerrang\" magazine that Murderdolls had reunited to work with producer Chris Harris. Jordison said: \"It's been an ongoing conversation between Wednesday and I from 2006 until now. We were bored with everything out there, and thought we had something to piss people off and shake things up. Everything is such a product or a fucking formula these days... fuck formula! Fuck the norm!\" Murderdolls released their second album, \"Women and Children Last\", on August 31, 2010. In March 2013, Wednesday 13 announced in an interview that the Murderdolls had split for good in 2011.\n\nAfter the Murderdolls went on hiatus in 2004, Poole went on a solo tour of the United Kingdom in March 2004, called the \"Graveyard A Go-Go\" tour. For his live performances, he was joined by members of horror punk band Death Becomes You, though this was not meant to be permanent. Poole returned to North Carolina in June 2004, and began to put together a more permanent band, with whom he would perform with under the Wednesday 13 name. He brought in former Frankenstein Drag Queens member, Ikky, on guitar. The band is heavily influenced by the likes of KISS and Alice Cooper, while not straying far from Poole's previous horror punk projects. In September 2004, Ikky was replaced with Matt Montgomery. Wednesday 13 toured Europe in November 2004 on the \"Look What the Bats Dragged in\" tour. Some of the dates were supported by English rockers Viking Skull.\n\nIn 2005, after touring, Poole released his debut album \"Transylvania 90210\", and made a music video for the track \"I Walked with a Zombie\", depicting the band members in footage from the original \"Night of the Living Dead\" horror movie. Following the album's release, the group embarked on a tour of the United Kingdom, entitled \"Tour from the Crypt\". Also in 2005, they played on the main stage of Download Festival at Donington, and opened some shows for Alice Cooper around Halloween.\n\nPoole parted ways with Roadrunner Records before signing a new deal with Rykodisc, with whom he released \"Fang Bang\", the follow-up to \"Transylvania 90210\", on September 12, 2006. The European version of the album contains a cover of Motörhead's \"R.A.M.O.N.E.S.\" and the Japanese edition features the same track listing as the European CD, along with a bonus song entitled \"Good Day to Die\". The American edition features \"Burn the Flames\", a Roky Erickson cover, as its sole bonus track. \"Skeletons\" was released on April 29, 2008, available exclusively through Hot Topic locations in the United States. It was released in the UK on May 12, 2008 by DR2 Records.\n\nOn November 14, 2008, Poole released his first live album, \"Fuck It, We'll Do It Live\". The CD/DVD package was recorded in 2008 at Crocodile Rock in Allentown, Pennsylvania. For distribution of this album, Wednesday 13 chose to release it exclusively through Hot Topic, just as he had for \"Skeletons\". A two-track digital download entitled \"Xanaxtasy\" was released on December 24, 2010 through iTunes. The release was announced via Wednesday 13's Facebook page on December 20, 2010, and contains two songs recorded during Wednesday's 2009 sessions. Out of the two songs, \"Xanaxtasy\" was previously released in the \"Bloodwork EP\" limited edition vinyl, and \"It's a Wonderful Lie\" was previously released on Wednesday's limited edition vinyl release \"From Here to the Hearse\". During May 2011, Poole released a remix album/EP titled \"Re-Animated\" and announced that a portion of all sales for the first month would be donated to the American Red Cross.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 13, Wednesday released the track listing for \"Calling All Corpses\" via Bravewords.com. The album was released on October 11 in the US and October 10 overseas. He released his fifth album, \"The Dixie Dead,\" on February 19, 2013. He released his sixth album, \",\" on January 12, 2015. He released his seventh album, \"Condolences,\" on June 2, 2017 after signing with Nuclear Blast.\n\nSince 2005, Poole, under the alias of Buck Bourbon, maintained an outlaw country side project called Bourbon Crow. Wednesday 13 was in contact with former drummer Jeff Washam from Psycho Opera and was going to tour on the East Coast project. Scheduling prevented JW from doing the tour. The band released their first album in 2006, \"Highway to Hangovers\", and their second album, \"Long Way to the Bottom\", was released in 2009. In 2015 the band released their third album \"Off the Wagon on the Rocks\"\n\nPoole teamed up with Todd Youth (of The Chelsea Smiles) to write and record an album with a more glam rock sound and without any horror themes, under the band name Gunfire 76. Rough mixes of the album's title track, \"Casualties & Tragedies\", were uploaded onto the band's Myspace page on August 12, 2009 for the fans to get an idea of what the band sounded like. The album debuted on October 6, 2009. Gunfire 76 toured from December 2009 to January 2010 with Bullets and Octane on the First Blood tour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seemingly limitless energy that drives Wednesday 13 led to another project in the shape of Gunfire 76.\nCasualties & Tragedies (2009) has been the only output of the Wednesday 13/Todd Youth (Danzig) collaboration so far.\nThe mastermind himself judges the album as, my extension into the rock world that has clearly been influenced by the New York Dolls and the Stooges.\n\n1.

{"id": "1868350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868350", "title": "Rifled musket", "text": "Rifled musket\n\nA rifled musket, rifle musket, or rifle-musket is a type of firearm made in the mid-19th century. Originally the term referred only to muskets that had been produced as a smoothbore weapon and later had their barrels replaced with rifled barrels. The term later included rifles that directly replaced, and were of the same design overall as, a particular model of smoothbore musket.\n\nIn the early 19th century, there were rifles, and there were muskets. Muskets were smoothbore muzzle-loading weapons, firing round lead balls or buck and ball ammunition, that were also designed to accept a bayonet. Rifles were similar in that they used the same kind of flintlock or caplock firing mechanism, but the main difference was that their barrels were rifled – that is, their barrels had grooves cut into the interior surface which would cause the bullet to spin as it left the barrel.\n\nRifles have the advantage of long range accuracy, because spinning bullets have far flatter and more stable trajectories than balls fired from smoothbore muskets. Muskets had the advantage of a faster rate of fire. A muzzle-loaded weapon required the bullet to fit snugly into the barrel. For a smoothbore weapon this can be a somewhat loose fit, but in the case of a rifle, the helical rifling lands in the barrel have to cut into the bullet to make it spin. The fit needs to be sufficiently tight for the bullet to engage the lands in order to impart spin; otherwise the bullet will wobble as it goes down the barrel, destroying its accuracy. Furthermore, if the barrel-to-bullet seal is not tight, gases will blow through the rifling grooves and around the bullet, compromising muzzle velocity, accuracy and the bullet's terminal energy at the target. Their greater accuracy and range made rifles ideal for hunting, but the slower rate of fire was a significant impediment for widespread military use, along with the fouling caused by normal firing which made them steadily more difficult to load.\n\nThe smooth-bore musket was the main weapon of the line infantry and light infantry, and rifles were used only by snipers and other specialist troops. All muskets were supplied with bayonets, which allowed them to be used in melee combat. At the time, the Russian and French armies actively used light infantry (rangers and voltigeurs), and sometimes scattered whole infantry battalions as skirmishers to fight long-term on rough terrain. Although rifles had better shooting accuracy than smoothbore muskets, their effective fire range was the same. For example, in the British Army, light infantrymen armed with ordinary muskets were trained for 300–400 yards. Since they were used as pikes, muskets tended to be fairly long and heavy weapons. They tended to be about four to six feet in length (six to eight feet including the bayonet), with a weight of around , as longer and heavier weapons were found to be too unwieldy. The length of a musket also allowed them to be fired by ranks, minimizing the risk that the men in the rear ranks would accidentally shoot the men in the front ranks in the back of the head, or, more likely, scorch their faces and burst their eardrums with the muzzle blast. Muskets six feet in length could be fired in three ranks without fear of accidents.\n\nThe relative inaccuracy and short range of the musket was not considered to be significant on the battlefield, because smoke from the black powder used at the time quickly obscured the battlefield and rendered the longer range of the rifle useless, especially as a battle progressed. \n\nRifles were more expensive to make than muskets, and were typically used by small units of specialized riflemen trained not to fight in closed ranks, but in open order, spread out as skirmishers or sharpshooters. Since they were not fired over other men’s shoulders or designed for close-combat bayonet fighting, military rifles could be much shorter than muskets, which also made loading from the muzzle easier and reduced the difficulties associated with fitting the bullet into the barrel, although the rate of fire was still slower than that of a musket. \nThe problem of slow loading of rifles caused by barrel fouling was solved by the Minié ball, which was invented in the 1840s by French inventor Claude-Étienne Minié. Despite its name, the Minié ball was not a round ball at all – it was long and conical, with an expanding skirt at the rear of the bullet. The skirt allowed the minié ball to be smaller than the barrel's bore, so it would slip in as easily as the ball of a smoothbore. When the weapon was fired, the skirt expanded to fit tightly against the inside of the rifle barrel, with less energy wasted in blow-by around the projectile and insuring that the rifling lands and grooves would impart a stabilizing spin to the minié ball.\n\nIn the 1840s and 1850s, many smoothbore muskets had their barrels replaced with similar barrels that were rifled so that they could fire the new bullet. These \"rifled muskets\" or \"rifle muskets\" were long enough to serve the function of muskets in close formations of line and square, were as quick to load as the old muskets and as easy to use with minimal training. Yet the Minié-type rifled muskets were much more accurate than smoothbore muskets. Tests of a rifled musket firing Minié ball, and a smoothbore musket firing round ball, at various ranges against a 10 by 10 inches (25 cm × 25 cm) target, showed much higher accuracy for the rifled musket. From a smooth-bore musket, from 42% to 48% of bullets hit the target at a distance of 200 yards. At a distance of 300 yards, 18% of the bullets hit the target. For a rifle, the results were much better. From a rifle, 46% to 58% of bullets hit the target at a distance of 300 yards; 24% to 42% at 500 yards. This potential accuracy, however, required skills only acquired through advanced training and practice; a rifle-musket in the hands of a raw recruit would not have performed very much better than a smoothbore. Nevertheless, the musket was still a formidable force on the battlefield. At the beginning of the American Civil War, some infantry regiments chose to keep smooth-bore muskets, preferring them because they could shoot \"ball and buck\".\n\nIn the 1850s and 1860s, new weapons produced with rifled barrels continued to be referred to as \"rifled muskets\" or \"rifle-muskets\" even though they had not originally been produced as smoothbore weapons. The term was only used for weapons that directly replaced smoothbore muskets. For example, the Springfield Model 1861 with its typical musket style lock mechanism and long barrel length was called a \"rifled musket\". In contrast, the Henry Rifle produced in the same time period did not replace a musket and did not have other musket-like characteristics, and was just referred to as a \"rifle\". \n\nIn the late 1860s, rifled muskets were replaced by breech-loading rifles. Weapons like the Springfield Model 1868 were produced by simply changing out the lock mechanism of a rifled musket. However, once this change was made, the weapon was no longer referred to as a rifled-musket and was instead referred to as simply a \"rifle\".\n\nIn general, rifle muskets were the same length as the smoothbore muskets they replaced. This meant that they typically had a barrel length of about and an overall length of about . Period U.S. Armory nomenclature described rifles and rifle-muskets as newly made firearms specifically designed and manufactured with rifling. Rifled muskets were smoothbore firearms returned to the armory or contractors for rifling. Considerable numbers of armory-stored smoothbores were converted in this way in the 1850s upon adoption of the Minié ball as the standard projectile. Rifle muskets tended to be of smaller caliber than their smoothbore predecessors, for example, the .58 caliber U.S. Springfield Model 1855 or the .577 caliber British Pattern 1853 Enfield. Tests conducted by the U.S. Army in the mid-1850s showed that the smaller caliber was more accurate at longer ranges. The cylindro-conical shape of the Minié ball also meant that the smaller-diameter but longer .58 caliber Minié ball had roughly the same amount of lead and weight as the larger .69 round ball. While the caliber was reduced, the overall length of the barrel was not. Shorter rifles could have easily been made (and were made for specific branches or arms such as mounted infantry and riflemen) that would have been more accurate than the smoothbore muskets they replaced, but military commanders still used tactics like firing by ranks, and feared that with a shorter weapon the soldiers in the rear ranks might accidentally shoot the front rank soldiers in the back of the head. Military commanders at the time also believed that bayonet fighting would continue to be important in battles, which also influenced the decision to retain existing barrel lengths.\n\nIn the US and British service standardized infantry firearms were produced in a longer \"rifle musket\" version and a shorter \"rifle\" version, such as the Springfield Model 1855. The rifle musket version had a 40-inch barrel and an overall length of . The rifle version had a barrel and an overall length of . In the British forces the distinction was retained between the full-length musket issued to the infantry as a whole, and the shorter and handier version of the Enfield produced for specialist rifle regiments and marines. The long version had the barrel held to the stock by three metal bands, while the shorter version needed just two, so they are referred to as “3-band” and “2-band” Enfields respectively.\n\nRifle muskets typically used percussion lock systems, with some exceptions like the Springfield Model 1855, which also was equipped with the Maynard tape primer system.\n\nSince rifle muskets were meant as a direct replacement for smoothbore muskets, they were fitted with bayonets. Their designers envisioned that they would be used in battle much like the bayonets on older smoothbore muskets. However, in practice, the longer range of the rifle musket and changes in tactics rendered the bayonet almost obsolete. During the U.S. Civil War, bayonets accounted for less than one percent of battlefield casualties.\n\nIn military use, rifle musket loading was simplified somewhat through the use of paper cartridges, which were significantly different from modern metallic cartridges. They typically consisted of rolled-up tubes of paper containing a premeasured amount of black powder and a greased Minié ball. Unlike the smoothbore cartridge, the entire cartridge was not simply shoved into the weapon. Instead, the paper was torn open (typically by the shooter's teeth), the powder was poured down the barrel, the Minié ball was placed into the barrel and rammed down on top of the powder with the ramrod. The paper was discarded. Also differing from a modern cartridge, a separate percussion cap had to be placed onto the percussion lock's cone before the weapon could be fired. The Maynard tape primer system attempted to speed up this last step by using paper strips similar to those used in modern toy cap guns in place of the percussion cap, but this proved to be unreliable in field service and was abandoned on later weapons.\n\nAn exception to this method is the Enfield rifle-musket cartridge. There were no lubrication rings moulded or swaged into the Enfield projectile. The projectile was inserted upside down in the cartridge and the outside of the cartridge paper was greased at the projectile end and intended to be inserted and used as a paper patch. A ramrod was used to fully seat the round.\n\nRifled muskets were heavily used in the American Civil War. The American-made Springfield Model 1861 was the most widely used weapon in the war, followed by the British Pattern 1853 Enfield. The Lorenz rifle was the third most used rifle during the Civil War\n\nThe Enfield was also used in the Crimean War where its greater range was a significant advantage over the much shorter-ranged Russian smoothbore muskets.\n\nHowever, soldiers armed with rifled muskets were not always successful on the battlefield. In the Italian War of 1859, \nAustrian troops armed with rifled muskets were defeated by French forces using aggressive skirmishing tactics and rapid bayonet assaults at close range.\n\n\n"}

Jarman was admitted to the bar in 1941 and began his law practice in Oklahoma City. Jarman enlisted in the United States Army in January, 1942 (about a month after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor). He served in the Security Intelligence Corps during World War II and was eventually discharged from military service in December, 1945. He was married to Ruth Virginia Bewley and had three children, John Henry Jarman III, Susan Jarman and Steve Jarman.\n\nJarman was later elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives and then later to the Oklahoma State Senate; Jarman was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1950 as a Democrat.\n\nJarman did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto, and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1960, the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but not the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1964, and 1968.\n\nJarman was reelected 11 times without serious difficulty, even as the Oklahoma City area trended increasingly Republican at the local level. Although the district had only supported a Democrat for president only once since Harry Truman, most local offices were still held by Democrats. By the 1970s, however, Republicans began making gains at the local level. As proof of this, in 1974, Jarman was nearly defeated by Republican newcomer Mickey Edwards in a year when Republicans were severely punished for the Watergate scandal.\n\nOn January 24, 1975, Jarman switched parties and became a Republican in protest of the removals of F. Edward Hébert, Wright Patman and William R. Poage from their committee chairmanships. Jarman claimed that the Democratic Party Caucus had changed over the years and that certain elements of the Caucus \"force their liberal views on this Congress and on this country by nullifying the seniority system and punishing those who do not adhere to the liberal party line as laid down by the caucus.\"\n\nHe did not run for reelection in 1976. Mickey Edwards won the seat, and the district remained in Republican hands until Kendra Horn unseated Steve Russell in the 2018 midterm elections approximately 42 years later.\n\nJarman declined to seek re-election to the House in 1976. After leaving Congress, he decided to resume his practice of law in Oklahoma City, where he remained until his death there on January 15, 1982. Jarman was laid to rest at Rose Hill Burial Park. Jarman spent much of his later life in Mexico and with his children and their families in Hawaii, Pennsylvania and Colorado.

A variant of other sex party urban myths, the stories claim that at these events, allegedly increasingly popular among adolescents, females wearing various shades of lipstick take turns fellating males in sequence, leaving multiple colors (resembling a \"rainbow\") on their penises. \n\nThe idea was publicized on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in 2003, and became the subject of a juvenile novel called \"Rainbow Party\". Sex researchers and adolescent health care professionals have found no evidence for the existence of rainbow parties, and consequently attribute the spread of the stories to a moral panic. On May 27, 2010, the television program \"The Doctors\" discussed the topic with dozens of teens, parents, and professionals.\n\nThe podcast \"You're Wrong About...\" explores the cultural phenomenon of rainbow parties in its episode 'Poisoned Halloween Candy and Other Urban Legends'.\n\nThe story was originally related by American pediatrician Meg Meeker in her 2002 book \"Epidemic: How Teen Sex Is Killing Our Kids\". The book related case stories of adolescents suffering cancer, sterility, acute infections, and unwanted pregnancies as a consequence of starting sexual activity too early in life. Meeker relates the following story from a 14-year-old patient from Michigan:\n[Allyson] had heard some kids were going to have a \"rainbow party,\" but had no idea what that meant. Still, she thought it might be fun, and arranged to attend with a friend. After she arrived, several girls (all in the eighth grade) were given different shades of lipstick and told to perform oral sex on different boys to give them \"rainbows.\" Once she realized what was happening, Allyson was too stunned and frightened to do anything. When a girl gave her some lipstick, she refused at first but, with repeated pressure, finally gave in. \"It was one of the grossest things I've ever done.\"\n\nThe idea of the rainbow party was publicized in October 2003 on the episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" titled \"Is Your Child Leading a Double Life?\", which was about the trend of increasing sexual promiscuity among American youth and the lack of parental awareness of the sexual practices of their children. In the \"\" Michelle Burford asserted, among other things, that many teens across the United States engaged in rainbow parties.\n\n\"Rainbow Party\" is a novel commissioned by a Simon & Schuster editor. The author is Paul Ruditis. The book, which \"Library Journal\" declined to review, is about teens who fantasize about having a rainbow party.\n\nThe book has proven controversial, as it was meant for teenagers (recommended by the publisher for ages 14 and up), thus raising questions about its propriety. In turn, concerns were raised that excluding the book from bookstores and libraries would amount to censorship. The publishers justified \"Rainbow Party\" on the grounds that it was a cautionary tale intended to teach readers that oral sex can be dangerous.\n\nDeborah Tolman, director of the Center for Research on Gender and Sexuality at San Francisco State University, writes: \"This 'phenomenon' has all the classic hallmarks of a moral panic. One day we have never heard of rainbow parties and then suddenly they are everywhere, feeding on adults' fears that morally-bankrupt sexuality among teens is rampant, despite any actual evidence, as well as evidence to the contrary.\" Tolman finds that several features of the story ring false. She was skeptical that many adolescent girls would be motivated to engage in such activity in the face of the severe social stigma still attached to sexual activity, and rejected the idea that adolescent boys would examine each other's lipstick marks. However, the urban legend was widespread; an informal survey taken by \"The New York Times\" in 2005 found that most teenagers between the ages of 13 and 16 were familiar with the rumor.\n\nCanadian parenting coach Lisa Bunnage claimed in a 2014 TEDxSFU talk that such parties were taking place. She claimed that despite rainbow parties being described by Wikipedia as an urban legend, she believed they are an ongoing issue.\n\n"}

Anderson to conclude Frank Herbert's original \"Dune\" series of science fiction novels.\n\nThe cliffhanger ending of Frank Herbert's \"\" (1985) and his subsequent death in 1986 left some overarching plotlines unresolved. Released on August 22, 2006, \"Hunters\" continues the story of the danger posed to humanity by a remote, unnamed, but ever-present \"great enemy\". The novel is based on notes left behind by Frank Herbert, but \"Hunters\" and its 2007 sequel \"Sandworms of Dune\" represent the author's version of what Frank Herbert referred to as Dune 7, his own planned seventh novel in the \"Dune\" series.\n\nThe first five chapters of the novel were available prior to the novel's publication via free download from the official \"Dune\" website, released monthly from March until July in 2006.\n\nFor three years, the no-ship \"Ithaca\" has been in an alternate universe, hiding from the \"great enemy\". It carries the clones, or gholas, of Duncan Idaho, famous military commander Miles Teg, the Bene Gesserit Sheeana, the last Bene Tleilax Master Scytale, and seven small melange-producing sandworms, as well as a number of other humans. Scytale has shared the secret of producing melange, also called spice, in tanks, because the sandworms do not produce enough to allow the ship to continue travelling. The mysterious Oracle of Time speaks to Duncan and brings the no-ship back into the 'regular' universe. The ship is discovered by the mysterious Daniel and Marty, first mentioned at the end of \"Chapterhouse: Dune.\" They attempt to capture the ship, but it escapes.\n\nOn Chapterhouse, the only remaining source of spice, Murbella, now the leader of the Honored Matres and Bene Gesserits, is attempting to merge the groups into the New Sisterhood and prevent civil war. Desperate for more spice so that their Navigators can travel through space, the Spacing Guild approaches her, but Murbella refuses, threatening to cut them off completely. Unbeknownst to everyone but the Bene Gesserit, the sandworms on Chapterhouse are not producing much melange; the Bene Gesserit are making up the shortfall with their own stockpiles.\n\nThough the Honored Matres had destroyed all Bene Tleilax worlds, their descendants (the Lost Tleilaxu) have returned from The Scattering. They use the shape-stealing Face Dancers for espionage, until the Face Dancers kill the Tleilaxu Elder Burah and replace him with a duplicate. It is revealed that they have replaced all the Lost Tleilaxu Elders, as well as countless humans on various planets in the Old Empire. Their leader Khrone sends the scribe Uxtal to serve the rebel Honored Matre leader Hellica, who has proclaimed herself Matre Superior and now rules the conquered Bene Tleilax homeworld, Tleilax.\n\nThe desperate Spacing Guild goes to Ix seeking an alternative means of space travel. Khrone and his Face Dancers have secretly infiltrated Ix, plotting to dominate the universe. Working with Daniel and Marty, Khrone offers their advanced navigation technology to the Guild as if it were of Ixian design. The Guild agrees to the development of this technology if they have a monopoly on it.\n\nUxtal has been forced to use Tleilaxu axlotl tank technology to produce the adrenaline-enhancing drug used by Honored Matres. Khrone tasks Uxtal to make a ghola of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, which is as sociopathic as the original. Khrone obtains the blood of Paul Atreides and has Uxtal make a ghola of Paul; he intends to use the ghola of the Baron to twist Paul's ghola into a weapon for Daniel and Marty's conquest of the universe. Later, Guild Navigator Edrik comes to Tleilax seeking Uxtal's knowledge of axlotl tanks; the Navigator fears his kind's obsolescence when the Ixian navigation technology becomes available. He seeks a tank-based source of spice to break the Bene Gesserit monopoly, but everyone believes that technology died with the Tleilaxu Masters. Eventually he accesses the genetic material of deceased Master Waff, and creates several Waff gholas, hoping to recover the lost technology.\n\nThe Tleilaxu sustain their lives indefinitely using gholas; Scytale's current body is dying, and he does not have a replacement. He has only one secret to use as a bargaining tool: a hidden nullentropy capsule containing cells of numerous important historical and legendary figures secretly collected by the Tleilaxu for millennia, as far back as the Butlerian Jihad. The Bene Gesserit have a vicious debate over whether to create gholas of any of these historical figures. A few at a time, the historical gholas are created, and Scytale is given a new body.\n\nOn Chapterhouse, Murbella creates the Valkyries, an elite New Sisterhood strike force. They successfully attack rebel Honored Matre strongholds on other planets, discovering that some of the Honored Matres are disguised Face Dancers. Murbella accesses the Other Memory from her Honored Matre ancestors and learns their true origins: they were vengeful Tleilaxu females, freed and assimilated by Fish Speakers and Bene Gesserits fleeing in The Scattering. Tleilaxu females had been enslaved for use as axlotl tanks by Tleilaxu males for millennia. These origins have been forgotten; Murbella now understands why the Honored Matres annihilated the Tleilaxu worlds in the Old Empire. Murbella also accesses a memory showing the origins of the mysterious force the Honored Matres call the Enemy.\n\nOn the no-ship, rebel Bene Gesserits attempt to murder the Leto II ghola, but are foiled when he transforms into a sandworm. The Paul ghola steals and consumes an overdose of spice in an attempt to remember his past, but instead has a vision of being stabbed by an evil version of himself. After being discovered by the Bene Gesserit, he concludes that he has regained prescience. Sheeana has visions that suggest the use of the gholas is dangerous, and halts the program until she knows more.\n\nDaniel and Marty tell Khrone to discard the Baron Harkonnen and Paul Atreides gholas, as they have lured the \"Ithaca\" into a trap, and will soon capture the ghola of Paul Atreides on board. Working to his own ends, Khrone continues to prepare the gholas, restoring the Baron's memories and instructing him to train the Paul ghola, which he renames Paolo. Paolo does not yet have his memories.\n\nMurbella contracts Ix's competitor Richese to provide armaments for a confrontation with the great enemy, but the rebel Honored Matres destroy the planet to cripple the Sisterhood. Murbella and her Valkyries successfully assault Tleilax, the most powerful of the rebel Honored Matre strongholds, and discover that many, including Matre Superior Hellica, were Face Dancers. Uxtal dies trying to escape, but the remaining Waff ghola finds refuge with the Spacing Guild, offering Edrik the genetic knowledge for the Guild to create their own sandworms.\n\nThe \"Ithaca\" stumbles upon the homeworld of the Handlers. An exploratory party from the no-ship discovers that the Handlers are actually Face Dancers, and barely escape back to the ship. Some Face Dancer ships crash into the \"Ithaca\", and the chaos makes it impossible to know if any passengers have been replaced by Face Dancers. The emergency forces Miles Teg to reveal his hidden power of superhuman speed.\n\nMurbella, now in complete control of the Honored Matres and Bene Gesserit, prepares a defense against the forces of the great enemy, now identified by Other Memory to be thinking machines of Omnius, the machine overlord destroyed in the ancient Butlerian Jihad. The Oracle of Time is revealed to be the living consciousness of Norma Cenva, somehow also still in existence millennia after the Jihad.\n\nDaniel and Marty are revealed to be Omnius and the independent robot, Erasmus. Before its destruction, the Omnius incarnation on Giedi Prime had launched 5,000 probes capable of constructing new machine colonies on any planets encountered. One of these probes eventually intercepted a signal transmitted by the last remaining Omnius on Corrin before it too was destroyed. Its forces and Synchronized Empire finally reassembled, the new version of the Evermind is on the way back to the Old Empire to destroy all humanity.\n\n\"The New York Times\" said of \"Hunters of Dune\" that \"Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson go through the motions, but they don't often seem to be having much fun with their material ... by the end of \"Hunters\", they have done little more than set the table for \"Sandworms of Dune\".\"\n"}

Her primary responsibilities were to protect the invasion fleet from air attack and to render fire support when called. She helped repel several air attacks, splashing another enemy plane in the process, and duelled with Japanese artillery batteries ashore. On 21 August, she entered the lagoon at Eniwetok Atoll for a week before rejoining the Fast Carrier Task Force for a 33-day sweep of the Philippines, during which the carrier planes hit targets on Luzon and Mindanao in addition to striking the Visayan and Palau island sub-groups.\n\nShe entered Ulithi on 1 October for provisions and upkeep. During her six-day stay, a typhoon struck the atoll and broke \"Stockham\" and two others loose from the nest. She cast off lines and anchored, but was later forced to get underway to evade the storm. She returned with the task group on 4 October to complete upkeep and provisioning in preparation for another cruise with the aircraft carriers.\n\nOn 6 October, the destroyer sortied from Ulithi with TG 38.2 for a month-long sweep primarily of the Philippines, but beginning with strikes on Okinawa, on the 10th, and on Formosa, from the 12th to the 14th. She supported the landing at Leyte Gulf on 20 October and screened the carriers during their strikes on southern Luzon and the Visayans on the 21st and 22d. On 25 and 26 October, she joined most of the elements of the 3rd Fleet in meeting and defeating the Japanese Northern Force during the Cape Engaño phase of the Battle for Leyte Gulf. On the 29th, Task Force 38 (TF 38) resumed air strikes on the Philippines. Those raids continued until Christmas broken only by two provisioning and upkeep periods at Ulithi, from 9 to 13 November and from 25 November until 9 December. \"Stockham\"'s crew spent Christmas Day and the eight days following it at Ulithi preparing for another cruise with the fast carriers.\n\nOn 3 January 1945, she departed with TG 30.8, the replenishment group for TF 38, and screened it until 7 January, when she rejoined the carriers. Over the next 19 days, she screened the carriers as their planes made sweeps of the inner defenses of the Japanese Empire. They hit French Indochina and Japanese shipping on the 12th, bombed Formosa a second and third time on the 15th and 21st, and struck Hainan, Hong Kong, and the China coast on the 16th. On the way back to Ulithi, they raided Okinawa again, on 22 January.\n\nFollowing two weeks of upkeep, provisioning, and training at Ulithi, \"Stockham\" put to sea with TF 38 to bomb Tokyo on 16 and 17 February and to support the Iwo Jima assault on 19 February. During the short stay in the Volcano Islands, the destroyer's guns brought down another enemy plane. On 22 February, she headed north to Japan and screened the carriers during another air strike on the Japanese home islands. On the 26th, she sank an enemy patrol craft off Tori Shima, fighting heavy seas as well as the Japanese. On 6 March, she put into Ulithi once again for provisions and upkeep.\n\nOn 14 March, she put to sea once more and operated with TF 59 until the following day, when she joined the screen of the Fast Carrier Task Force for sweeps of Kyūshū, Okinawa, and Kerama Retto. After the 1 April landings at Okinawa, \"Stockham\" remained off that coast until 29 April, protecting the invasion fleet from the onslaught of the kamikazes. On 6 April, she splashed two \"Zekes\". She bombarded Minami and Kita Daito islands on the 21st. She put into Ulithi on the 30th. On 7 May, she put to sea with TF 58 and, conducting drills along the way, headed for another series of air raids on Kyūshū and Okinawa. She screened the fleet from air attack during the strikes, helping to repel several enemy raids. She parted company with the main body of the fleet on 6 June to escort a group of crippled ships, including the bowless \"Pittsburgh\" (CA-72), to Apra Harbor, Guam. She remained at Guam from 11 to 30 June; then escorted a group of ships to Eniwetok, before rejoining TF 38 on 8 July.\n\nBetween 8 July and 15 August, she screened the fleet carriers while their planes struck their last series of blows at Japan. Starting with Tokyo on the 10th, they moved swiftly up along Honshū to Hokkaidō, pounding targets on both islands on the 14th and 15th, then returned to Tokyo on the 18th. On 24 July, she bombarded Cape Shiono at the southern extremity of Honshū, and then returned to screening the fleet from suicide attack while it sent planes to pummel Honshū and Shikoku.\n\nOn 15 August 1945, the Japanese Empire capitulated and, four days later, \"Stockham\" joined the Yokosuka occupation force, which entered Sagami Wan on 27 August. She supported the landings at Tokyo Bay and at Tateyama on the 30th and 31st respectively, then anchored off Yokosuka on 2 September for six days of upkeep, provisioning, and recreation. She was underway from 9 to 18 September, supporting the minesweeping operations in Sendai Bay and in the vicinity of Goshi. She returned to Tokyo Bay for a month on 19 September, conducted training exercises between 24 and 28 October, and then provisioned for the voyage home. On 31 October, \"Stockham\" stood out of Yokosuka to return to the United States. After more than a year on the west coast, she was decommissioned on 30 August 1946 and berthed at San Diego, California\n\nThe hostilities in Korea in 1950 necessitated an increase in the size of the active fleet. \"Stockham\" was recommissioned on 14 November 1951, Comdr. A. P. Zavadil in command. She was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet until 1953, engaged in fleet training missions out of Newport, R.I. In December 1953, the destroyer joined the United Nations Fleet and operated in the Far East, stopping at the southern tip of Japan, then traveling to the Pusan harbor briefly and later Inchon, until the summer of 1954. In July, she returned to Newport after completing a circumnavigation of the world. In November 1954, \"Stockham\" entered Boston Naval Shipyard and, at the completion of her overhaul in February 1955, she shook down in the Caribbean. She then resumed normal operations with the Atlantic Fleet until 1 February 1956, when she was posted to the 6th Fleet. She cruised the Mediterranean for four months; visited Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, and Greece; then, resumed operations out of Newport. \"Stockham\" returned to the 6th Fleet in the fall of 1956; visited France, Italy, and Greece; and participated in an antisubmarine exercise with American and Italian ships. On 23 February 1957, the destroyer returned to Newport. Seven months later, she was decommissioned on 2 September 1957 and placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Stockham\" was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register 1 December 1974, and sunk as a target off Puerto Rico 17 February 1977.\n\n\"Stockham\" (DD-683) earned eight battle stars during World War II.\n\n"}

At the Jena, he earned his doctorate in 1886.\n\nIn 1889, Nippold was invited by the Japanese government as a foreign advisor (\"O-yatoi gaikokujin\"). He taught at the Law School of the University of Tokyo.\n\nOn his return to Europe on the conclusion of his three-year contract, he worked as a lawyer in Thun and Bern and acquired Swiss citizenship in 1905. The same year, he passed his habilitation in international law at the University of Bern.

His book, \"Development of International Law After the World War,\" was drafted during the First World War. In this text, Nippold argued that the conflict created a need for a radical reinterpretation of the law of war. He reasoned that modern war cannot be given the character of a legal institution\nbecause it is really a negation of law; and therefore, war itself is an illustration of \"self-help\" on the part of the aggressor.\n\nNippold was a leader in the slow transformation of treaties from bilateral alliances or trade agreements to more \"normative\" instruments; and in the 20th century, there came to be a perceived distinction between regular treaties and \"law-making\" or \"quasi-legislative\" conventions. In 1894, Nippold summarized a point of view which would continue to evolve: \"International treaties in their totality will be the Law-book of international law.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1868388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868388", "title": "Sandworms of Dune", "text": "Sandworms of Dune\n\nSandworms of Dune is a science fiction novel by American writers Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, the second of two books they wrote to conclude Frank Herbert's original \"Dune\" series. It is based on notes left behind by Frank Herbert for Dune 7, his own planned seventh novel in the \"Dune\" series. The novel was released on August 7, 2007.\n\nAs \"Sandworms of Dune\" begins, the passengers of the no-ship \"Ithaca\" continue their nearly two-decade search for a new home world for the Bene Gesserit, while Duncan Idaho evades the tachyon net of the old couple Daniel and Marty, now known to be thinking machine leaders Omnius and Erasmus. Among the inhabitants of the \"Ithaca\" are young gholas of Paul Atreides, Lady Jessica, and others. Back in the Old Empire, Mother Commander Murbella of the New Sisterhood attempts to rally humankind for a last stand against the thinking machines. The new Face Dancers continue to infiltrate the main organizations of the Old Empire at all levels, having also sent their gholas of Paul Atreides (called Paolo) and the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen to the thinking machine capital, Synchrony.\n\nAt the prompting of Face Dancer infiltrators, the Spacing Guild has begun replacing its Navigators with Ixian navigation devices and cutting off the Navigators' supply of melange. Navigator Edrik and his faction have commissioned Waff, the imperfectly awakened ghola rescued by the Guild from the Bene Gesserit attack on Bandalong, to create \"advanced\" sandworms able to produce the melange they so desperately require. He accomplishes this by altering the DNA of the sandtrout stage and creating an aquatic form of the worms, which are then released into the oceans of Buzzell. Adapting to their new environment, these \"seaworms\" quickly flourish, eventually producing a highly concentrated form of spice, dubbed \"ultraspice\".\n\nMeanwhile, Murbella commissions Ix to copy the destructive Honored Matre Obliterators for use on the fleet of warships she has ordered from the Guild. However, Ix is now secretly controlled by Face Dancer leader Khrone; previously acting as a minion of Omnius, he continues his own plot for Face Dancer domination of the universe. Omnius's forces have begun striking world after world, releasing a deadly virus and then pressing on to the new string of inhabited planets. The thinking machine plague arrives at Chapterhouse and cripples the Sisterhood, but they rally the unified humankind into one last great stand.\n\nAboard the \"Ithaca\", Sheeana restarts the ghola project. Gholas of Serena Butler, Gurney Halleck, and Xavier Harkonnen are about to be born when the axlotl tanks are poisoned, killing all three ghola babies and the tanks. Saboteurs are suspected, as many of the ship's systems have also been failing. Scytale, the last Tleilaxu Master, finally reawakens his own ghola's past memories, but only by dying in front of his younger self. The gholas of Wellington Yueh, Stilgar, and Liet-Kynes regain their memories through various traumatic experiences. Desperate to replenish their supplies, the \"Ithaca\" lands on the planet Qelso, a world slowly being terraformed into a desert planet by the introduction of sandworms years before by the Bene Gesserit. Stilgar and Liet-Kynes decide to remain behind to help the natives slow the encroaching desert and prepare them for the inevitable.\n\nHaving successfully completed his attempts to create a new incarnation of sandworm, Waff begs Edrik to return him to the ruined planet of Rakis so that he can spend what little time to live he has left attempting to reintroduce the worms there as well. Unsuccessful, Waff resigns himself to failure and prepares to die; as the last of his sandworm specimens perishes, a dozen sandworms erupt from beneath the surface. Waff realizes that the pearl of Leto II's awareness that each sandworm carries had foreseen the Honored Matre attack on Rakis and buried themselves deep beneath the planet's surface. Knowing the planet has begun healing itself, Waff is consumed by a worm, rejoicing that his prophet has finally returned. Meanwhile, Edrik and the ultraspice are intercepted by Khrone, who seizes the spice and kills the Navigator.\n\nThe saboteurs are eventually revealed to be the Rabbi and the ghola of Thufir Hawat, who had apparently been murdered and replaced with Face Dancers back on the planet of the Handlers during the events of \"Hunters of Dune\". In the ensuing chaos that follows the discovery of the Face Dancers, the \"Ithaca\" is ensnared by the tachyon net. Miles Teg sacrifices his life in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent their capture. The \"Ithaca\" is brought to Synchrony. They are met by a party led by the ghola of Vladimir Harkonnen. Seeing the young ghola of Alia when he arrives, he immediately kills her; the original Alia had murdered his original self 5,000 years before. The Bene Gesserit gholas of Paul, Lady Jessica, Chani, and Yueh are then taken to see Omnius and Erasmus.\n\nOmnius explains that to complete his domination of humanity, he requires the superior Kwisatz Haderach of the two Paul gholas. Paolo and Paul are forced to duel, during which Paul is mortally wounded. Victorious, Paolo takes the ultraspice; overwhelmed by the rapid onset of perfect prescient vision, he slips into a coma. Paul, at the urging and efforts of Yueh, Chani, and Jessica, slowly regains his past memories and is able to repair the damage to his body using Bene Gesserit physiological control. Under the guise of aiding Paolo, Yueh takes his revenge by killing Baron Harkonnen, who had orchestrated the torture and death of Yueh's wife Wanna in their original incarnations.\n\nAs this is happening, Murbella has all the new ships in place and is finally ready to launch her fleet against Omnius's oncoming armada. But the Obliterators and Ixian navigation devices all suddenly fail. Murbella realizes that they have been sabotaged. When it appears that defeat at the hands of the thinking machine forces is imminent, the Oracle of Time appears with a thousand ships piloted by Guild Navigators and begins to attack the machines. This assault leaves the machine fleet in pieces. The Oracle then tells Murbella that she is going to Synchrony to stop Omnius once and for all; she folds space, and a visual manifestation of the Oracle appears in the room where Paul and Paolo have been dueling. The Oracle then removes every aspect of Omnius and transports the Evermind away into another dimension forever.\n\nSheeana and the young Leto II ghola free the sandworms from the \"Ithaca\"'s cargo hold, and the worms wreak havoc throughout Synchrony. Leto II regains his memories, and after the battle is finished, he tells Sheeana that he must now go back into the dreaming. Leto walks into the belly of the largest worm, Monarch, and the seven worms twist together and join into one giant superworm before digging deep into the ground.\n\nFresh from fighting the thinking machines outside on Synchrony with Sheeana, Duncan enters the chamber where a recovering Paul, his memories now restored, reveals that Duncan is the final Kwisatz Haderach, having evolved and perfected himself through thousands of years of ghola rebirth and altered DNA. Erasmus, the independent-minded robot, explains that he was the mastermind behind the rebuilding of the Synchronized Worlds. A mutinous Khrone declares that the universe now belongs to his Face Dancers, as both humans and machines have been crippled. Amused by Khrone's attempt to seize power, Erasmus explains that a fail-safe system had been built into the Face Dancers. Erasmus kills Khrone and his party—and then all enhanced Face Dancers across the universe—with the simple flip of a mental switch. The immediate death of so many Face Dancers exposes how much they have infiltrated human society. Erasmus then offers Duncan a choice. With both humans and thinking machines battered and beaten, Duncan can choose either destruction for one side or recovery and healing for both. Choosing peace over victory, Duncan and Erasmus then merge minds. Erasmus imparts Duncan with all the codes required to run the Synchronized Worlds, as well as all of his knowledge. Duncan now stands as the bridge between humans and machines. With little left for him, Erasmus again expresses his desire to learn everything possible about what it is to be human—he asks for Duncan to help him die. As Duncan shuts Erasmus down, he shares one of the many deaths he experienced with the robot.\n\nBack in the Old Empire, Murbella's forces are preparing to attack Omnius's second wave when the machines suddenly stop. With the Oracle having taken Omnius, a Navigator brings Murbella to Synchrony. She and Duncan are reunited, and he explains his intent to end the divide between humans and thinking machines—the two will co-exist. Duncan gives Synchrony to Sheeana for her Orthodox Sisterhood, while he returns with Murbella to help lead the new human-machine mode of life.\n\nOn Qelso, the gholas of Stilgar and Liet-Kynes continue to aid in the attempt to hold back the expanding desert, while simultaneously teaching the planet's occupants how to adapt to the changes that will inevitably come. Under Duncan's control, a thinking machine convoy lands on the planet; Duncan offers the gholas the aid of the thinking machines in holding back the desert. He tells Stilgar and Kynes that just as he has become both man and machine, Qelso will become both desert and forest.\n\nOn Caladan, the gholas of Lady Jessica and Wellington Yueh have returned to the ancient Atreides castle. Having removed all traces of the Baron's occupancy, the two discuss how they will go forward with their lives. Accompanying them is the unawakened ten-year-old ghola of Leto I. Looking forward to the time when his memories will be restored, Lady Jessica finds solace in the fact that she will be reunited with her Duke.\n\nWith the aid of the Tleilaxu Master Scytale, Sheeana and the Orthodox Sisterhood on Synchrony have reestablished the ancient Bene Gesserit breeding program, resolving to never again breed another Kwisatz Haderach. At her side, Sheeana has a young ghola of Serena Butler, heroine of the Butlerian Jihad. Along with gholas of the Tleilaxu Masters, Scytale has grown Tleilaxu females from newly discovered cells, vowing that they will never again be forced into becoming axlotl tanks, in the hopes that this will prevent the creation of a vengeful enemy such as the Honored Matres from ever occurring again, and also vowing to never again allow the Masters to corrupt the recovering Tleilaxu people.\n\nOn the recovering planet Dune, the awakened gholas of Paul and Chani go about restoring the planet to its former glory. Now that Paul is able to devote all of his attention to her, Chani remarks that he has finally learned how to treat his wife. As the novel closes, Paul reaffirms his love for Chani, telling her he has loved her for over 5,000 years.\n\nThe novel was commercially successful, and praised by Jackie Cassada of the \"Library Journal\":\n\"Complex in structure though never hard to follow, this sequel to \"Hunters of Dune\" ties together the threads left by \"Chapterhouse: Dune\", bringing closure to a saga of planetary birth and death and human courage and hubris. At the same time, the authors have left room for further explorations of one of the genre's most enduring worlds. Highly recommended for all SF collections.\"\nConversely, the novel was criticized by \"Publishers Weekly\" for its writing and storytelling methods:\n\"Longtime collaborators Herbert and Anderson set themselves a steep challenge—and, in the end, fail to meet it—in this much anticipated wrapup of the original \"Dune\" cycle (after 2006's \"Hunters of Dune\") [...] Though pacing is brisk and the infrequent action scenes crackle with tension, only two minor characters—gholas, who are young clones with restored memories, of Suk doctor Wellington Yueh and God-Emperor Leto II—acquire real depth. Everyone else is too busy reacting to mostly irrelevant subplots like sabotage aboard the no-ship \"Ithaca\", a plague devastating the planet of Chapterhouse and the genetic engineering of marine-dwelling sandworms. The lengthy climax relies on at least four consecutive \"deus ex machina\" bailouts... Series fans will argue the novel's merits for years; others will be underwhelmed.\"\n\"Sandworms of Dune\" was originally the working title for the fourth Dune novel, which was eventually published as \"God-Emperor of Dune\".\n"}

The character was created by Peter David and Rick Leonardi in 1992 for the Marvel 2099 comic book line, and is a futuristic re-imagining of his namesake created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. His real identity is Miguel O'Hara, a brilliant geneticist living in New York (renamed Nueva York) in the year 2099 who attempts to recreate the abilities of the original Spider-Man in other people and later suffers a related accident that causes half of his DNA to be re-written with a spider's genetic code.\n\nSpider-Man 2099 was one of the many Marvel characters to be re-imagined for the Marvel 2099 comic book line that showed future versions of classic Marvel characters living in the year 2099, a century after the current Marvel Universe time period (the Marvel 2099 timeline began its run in 1992, approximately 107 years prior to the year in which the new books would take place). Spider-Man 2099 was first featured in a five-page sneak preview of the first issue of his then-upcoming series in the 30th-anniversary issue of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". The \"Spider-Man 2099\" series' first issue appeared shortly afterward. When originally published, the Marvel 2099 stories were meant to depict the official future of the Marvel Universe: a dystopian America governed by corrupt megacorporations with a number of cyberpunk elements.\n\nThe character was originally designed by artist Rick Leonardi, with Peter David brought onto the series as writer to flesh out the character's alter ego, Miguel O'Hara, and supporting characters. \"Spider-Man 2099\" #1 was written by Peter David, pencilled by Rick Leonardi, inked by Al Williamson, and lettered by Rick Parker. David named the character after his friend, actor Miguel Ferrer. \"Spider-Man 2099\" #1 is the highest-selling single issue of any comic written by Peter David.\n\nAlthough the book was continuously selling more than 100,000 copies per issue, the book and entire 2099 comic line underwent a drastic shift in early 1996, with the firing of the 2099 series editor Joey Cavalieri. At this time, Marvel's finances and future were unstable, and sudden firings were quite common. Like virtually all of the other writers in the line, Peter David chose to show solidarity with his editor, and resigned from the book with issue #44. Marvel turned the 2099 titles over to fill-in writers and editors. The last two issues of \"Spider-Man 2099\" were done without Peter David's input and the series ended with issue #46. A few months later, Marvel announced they would publish a new 2099 title, \"\", immediately following the last issues of the original titles, under the new staff. The new bi-monthly title lasted eight issues and was meant to serve as a finale for the 2099 line and the end of its regular publication.\n\nMiguel O'Hara was seen again without a costume in 1998 in \"2099: Manifest Destiny\", a one-shot issue intended to bring further closure to the 2099 line and its unresolved storylines. The character has since made several cameo and guest appearances in such titles as \"Captain Marvel\" vol. 3 #27–30 (written by Peter David) and in \"Exiles\" #75–99. Marvel published a collected edition of the first ten issues of the original series in April 2009 and a second collection in October 2013 collecting up to #14. Spider-Man 2099 next appeared in \"The Superior Spider-Man\" #17–19 in September and October 2013, with Miguel O'Hara stranded in the mainstream Marvel timeline at the end of the story.\n\nThe character and setting were reimagined for the \"Timestorm 2009–2099\" four-issue limited series published from April to August 2009. Although bearing the Spider-Man 2099 moniker, it is a different version of the character.\nIn the 2013 \"Necessary Evil\" storyline in \"The Superior Spider-Man\", the character is stranded in the present. In July 2014 Marvel launched a second \"Spider-Man 2099\" series, with Peter David returning as writer, Will Sliney as artist, and Simone Bianchi illustrating the first issue's cover. The character appears in the 2014 \"Spider-Verse\" crossover storyline that involves different versions of Spider-Man, including Peter Parker. The new series ends with \"Spider-Man 2099\" (vol. 3) #25 (September 2017), in which Miguel O'Hara returns to 2099. The final story arc also introduces a second character using the Spider-Man 2099 identity.\n\nMiguel O'Hara was born in New York City (futuristically called Nueva York), many years after the end of what his people's history calls the \"Heroic Age\", which is the modern-day era of Marvel heroes. He grows up with his mother Conchata, his younger brother Gabriel, and his abusive father George O'Hara. A rebellious boy with prodigy-level intelligence, Miguel is an adolescent when he is awarded enrollment into the Alchemax School for Gifted Youngsters (heavily implied to be a renovated version of the X-Men's headquarters) in Westchester, owned by the powerful Alchemax megacorporation which also controls local law enforcement agencies. Here, he befriends Xina Kwan, a girl of similar intelligence who specializes in computers. Xina helps Miguel defend himself against the bully Kron Stone, son of Tyler Stone: Vice President of R&D for Alchemax.\n\nAs adults, Miguel and Xina date seriously until Miguel cheats on her with Dana D'Angelo, who originally is the girlfriend of Miguel's brother Gabe. Later on, Miguel and Dana are engaged. Though seemingly arrogant and confident in all walks of life, Miguel is a very private man and trusts almost no one except for his apartment's holographic aide Lyla, an artificial intelligence programmed by Xina.\n\nMiguel eventually becomes head of the genetics program of Alchemax, intended to create new corporation-controlled super-powered soldiers called \"corporate raiders.\" Miguel is specifically inspired by surviving records concerning Spider-Man and hopes to one day create a similarly powered person. But after a human test subject dies during an early experiment, Miguel tells Tyler Stone he wishes to resign from Alchemax and discontinue his genetics research. Rather than let Miguel leave, Tyler Stone tricks him into taking Rapture, an addictive drug that genetically bonds to the user. Tyler reminds Miguel that only Alchemax is allowed to legally distribute this drug, so if O'Hara does not remain with the corporation then Tyler must assume he is getting the drug from the black market and will be forced to tell the police. Not wishing to be a blackmailed addict, Miguel recalls that he entered his own genetic code into his machine's databanks during initial experiments, using it as a human DNA test sample. Intending to use this older template of his pure genetic code to write over his current biology and free himself from the Rapture, Miguel sneaks into Alchemax and uses the gene alteration machines on himself.\n\nAfter Miguel turns on the machine to rewrite his DNA, his jealous subordinate Aaron Delgado sabotages the machines, causing them to alter Miguel's genetic code to be \"50% spider DNA.\" Miguel survives the process, but realizes he now has spider-abilities.\n\nRealizing that there is now a person with abilities similar to Spider-Man, Tyler Stone sends agents to hunt this person. To conceal his identity while he fights his pursuers, Miguel dons a bodysuit with a mask that he once wore for the Mexican Day of the Dead festival. Miguel chooses this costume in particular because it is the only clothing he has that is made from \"UMF\" (Unstable Molecule Fabric), meaning it is the only clothing he owns that will not be torn or shred by the spider-talons that now occupy his hands and feet. After seeing him operate in public, a group of Thorites (worshippers of the Marvel hero Thor) come to believe that Miguel is the legendary Spider-Man back from the dead, and that he is the harbinger of Thor's eventual return.\n\nOriginally focused with finding a cure for his condition, Miguel's further adventures as Spider-Man 2099 cause him to realize how ignorant of the world he was and how he had turned a blind eye to the oppression and pain the corporations of the world have caused. He is also surprised at the effect his presence has on the people who have been oppressed for so long, particularly his own mother, who ironically also hates the man her eldest son has become yet admires the exploits of Spider-Man 2099. After this, Miguel decides to embrace his identity as Spider-Man. Donning his costume, he publicly proclaims himself to be an enemy to all the megacorps, saying he will use his powers to fight for ordinary people against those in power who abuse their influence and authority.\n\nLater on, Miguel discovers that an arrogant scientist at Alchemax called Jordan Boone is conducting \"Virtual Unreality\" experiments to create a doorway into another dimension. These experiments lead to the release of two mysterious figures: the Net Prophet, called \"the prophet of Thor\" by the Thorites, and a powerful megalomaniac called Thanatos. The Net Prophet becomes a new ally to Miguel. Since the Net Prophet is believed to be Thor's prophet, his association with Spider-Man 2099 leads more people to believe that Miguel's alter ego is the harbinger of Thor.\n\nIn the \"Time Flies Saga\" that occurs years later in Peter David's \"Captain Marvel\" series, it is revealed that the Net Prophet is actually the hero Justice (John Roger Tensen) and that Thanatos is a corrupt version of Rick Jones from Earth-9309.\n\nThe first major crossover of Marvel 2099 happens when Miguel and Dana visit Alchemax's floating city \"Valhalla\" and are startled by the sudden appearance of two men claiming to be Thor and Heimdall, respectively. It is later discovered that Alchemax CEO Avatarr has transformed ordinary people into duplicates of the Asgardians in order to eliminate the rising influence of new superheroes over the public. By joining forces, Doom, Ravage, the Punisher (Jake Gallows), the X-Men, and Spider-Man 2099 are able to defeat the fake Aesir, and Valhalla falls.\n\nMiguel later learns that Gabe is aware of his dual identity, having recognized Spider-Man's costume from what Miguel wore to the Day of the Dead festival years earlier. Gabe has grown a bit resentful of Miguel's new heroic career, particularly since his girlfriend Kasey seems enamored with the costumed Spider-Man 2099.\n\nAfter his holographic aide Lyla suffers a serious malfunction, Miguel asks for repairs from his ex-girlfriend Xina. Dana later accuses Miguel of cheating on her with Xina. Miguel becomes angry about this and about Dana's noticeably increasing interest in Tyler Stone. The two dissolve their romantic relationship, and Xina and Miguel become companions again.\n\nIn the 1995 one-shot, \"Spider-Man 2099 Meets Spider-Man\", Miguel and Peter Parker, the Spider-Man of the Heroic Age, find themselves having switched places, with Miguel waking up next to Peter's wife, Mary Jane, and Spider-Man finding himself in the future. They discover that their predicament is caused by Fujikawa (in the Modern Age) and Alchemax (in the year 2099) running experiments on a temporal energy generator. While Peter tackles the Vulture of 2099, Miguel faces Venom (Eddie Brock). Miguel realizes that this temporal anomaly is what will cause the end of the Heroic Age, since where he is in the past is when history tells him all the heroes and much of Earth's culture and technology were wiped out.\n\nThe two Spider-Man characters were united to face a major cause of the chaos, a time-traveling female Hobgoblin of the year 2211 (Robin Borne) from the alternative universe of Earth-9500. They are aided by this Hobgoblin's father, Spider-Man (Max Borne), and eventually everyone is sent back to their respective times.\n\nWhile eavesdropping on a conversation between his mother and Tyler Stone, Miguel learns that the Rapture that Stone gave him was only a short-lasting simulation and would have worn off in time. He also learns that Tyler Stone is his real father. Bothered by this, he leaves New York to go traveling with Xina. During this time, they travel to Nightshade, an independent research town (free of megacorp rule) run by Angela Daskelakis, their former headmistress at the Alchemax institute. While they are visiting, Alchemax attempts a hostile takeover of Nightshade, destroying most of the city and killing Angela in the process. Xina returns home and Miguel disappears into the desert, saved by a group of scavengers. As Spider-Man, they ask him to try and fix an old homunculus-like robot they had found. After seeing Spider-Man's mask, it transforms itself into a hybrid of the present day Spider-Man and Venom, naming itself Flipside. Seemingly harmless at first, the robot begins showing psychopathic and homicidal tendencies. Miguel escapes, leaving the scavengers to Flipside's mercy and returns to New York.\n\nUpon his return, Miguel finds out that Doom 2099 has assumed control over the U.S. and its megacorps. Tyler Stone is appointed as Doom's Corporate Minister and Miguel is offered the seat of CEO of Alchemax. Later, Doom 2099 offers Spider-Man 2099 the position of Minister of Supernormal Affairs. Miguel eventually accepts the position at Alchemax, deciding to change the company for the better. He also uses his new influence to order law enforcement to leave Spider-Man 2099 alone.\n\nAfter assuming his new position of power, Miguel winds up encountering a modern version of the original Spider-Man's enemy Venom. The Venom symbiote, still alive, though slightly altered, takes on a new host body and attacks Tyler Stone, currently hospitalized after being shot. During a later battle between Spider-Man 2099 and Venom 2099, Dana is killed.\n\nSoon after this, a new villain called the Goblin appears and begins a smear campaign against Spider-Man 2099, displaying out-of-context evidence that implies he is actually a tool of the corporations and only pretends to be a hero of the people. Miguel hopes to get aid from Doom 2099, but the monarch is then removed from power.\n\nMeanwhile, as Miguel O'Hara, he must deal with Alchemax business, including an uprising by the bio-engineered Neo-Atlanteans, who were bred as workers to complete Alchemax's underwater colony \"Atlantis\". Miguel gets help when his mother becomes his secretary, attempting to rebuild their relationship and confessing that she was the one who shot Tyler Stone. The neo-Atlanteans, led by Roman the new Sub-Mariner (a reverse spelling of the original, Namor), attack the city but are fended off by Spider-Man.\n\nAs the \"Spider-Man 2099\" series approached its end, Miguel confronts the Goblin again and learns that it is actually his brother Gabe, twisted by jealousy towards his brother. This story is put aside as the Phalanx approaches earth, flooding New York and paving the way for the Atlanteans to return en masse. The final volume sees the apparent deaths of Tyler Stone and Miguel's mother at the hands of the Atlanteans, as the Vulture destroys the Alchemax building. Miguel, along with Dana's sister, Jennifer, are left in an Alchemax airship, trying to decide where to find a safe place to go.\n\nIn the \"Manifest Destiny\" one-shot his mother is said to have survived and in \"Superior Spider-Man\" #17 his father is revealed to be alive as well.\n\nIn \"2099: World of Tomorrow\", the polar ice caps melt and a massive deluge kills most of the world's inhabitants. The remnants of humanity face a new threat from space: the techno-organic Phalanx. Spider-Man works together with Doom 2099 to end the invasion, in which Doom sacrifices himself for the survival of mankind.\n\nIn the later one-shot \"2099: Manifest Destiny\", society rebuilds following the Phalanx invasion. Miguel reopens Alchemax and marries Xina. Together, they reawaken Steve Rogers, offering him Thor's hammer, Mjolnir (it had been previously established in mainstream Marvel Comics that Steve Rogers was deemed worthy to lift Mjolnir). Jettisoned into space, Rogers passes Mjolnir back to Miguel, who is likewise deemed worthy enough to lift and wield the mystical hammer, gaining new power from it.\n\nSecretly aided by Zero Cochrane 2.0 (Ghost Rider 2099), Miguel rules for the next thousand years, ushering in an unprecedented age of enlightenment. Peace, morality, and progress spread from Earth to the surrounding worlds. In 3099, Rogers is once again revived and takes the hammer, leaving Miguel to retire. Miguel O'Hara's journey from a cowardly, arrogant youth to superhero to galactic leader and icon comes to an end.\n\nThere are anomalies in the 2099 timeline and it is revealed that Tiberius Stone is indeed Miguel O'Hara's grandfather and Tyler Stone's father. The story concludes with Tyler Stone stranding Miguel in the present and Miguel (aided by Lyla in a holographic wristwatch) taking the alias \"Michael O'Mara\" and becoming Tiberius's assistant to monitor the wrongdoings of the newly established Alchemax. Although the Superior Spider-Man (Otto Octavius's mind in Peter Parker's body) briefly betrays Miguel and leaves him fighting various hijacked Spider-Slayers when the Green Goblin launches a mass attack on New York, Miguel accepts Peter's explanation for his recent actions when he returns after being restored to his body reasoning that the story is too stupid to be anything but true. Although Spider-Man 2099 remains in the present to monitor Alchemax after Peter learns that it is being run by Norman Osborn.\n\nMiguel learned that he and Liz Allan will have some significant impact on future history when a time-traveler from 2211 came back in time to try to kill him to prevent the consequences of their interaction, although Miguel nevertheless refused to either let the agent kill him or Liz. When Liz nearly discovers Miguel's identity, Miguel admits to his origin from the future without admitting to his role as Spider-Man. Roped into accompanying Tiberus Stone to sell Spider-Slayers to a foreign country, Miguel is forced to fight the Scorpion—who was hired by Alchemax to further test the Spider-Slayers—after Stone is captured by the local rebels, but Miguel manages to defeat Scorpion by tricking the Spider-Slayers into attacking him, while Stone's encounter with the rebels prompts him to change his mind about the original deal.\n\nDuring the \"Spider-Verse\" storyline, Miguel O'Hara witnesses his Avenger, Timestorm and Exiles counterparts get killed by Morlun when he received a vision of his two counterparts and before the Exiles version of him can flee to Earth-616. After the portal closes due to Morlun still feeling wary about Earth-616 Spider-Man following their last fight, Miguel leaves to find Peter Parker and to let him know what happened. He and the other 616/Main Universe Spider Heroes of Earth are recruited by Spider-UK, Mayday Parker Spider-Girl of Earth-982, and Spider-Ham to join the Spider-Army to combat Inheritors, who hunt down and devour the Spider Totems like them across the Multiverse. Using dimension-travel technology Miguel O'Hara is able to return to 2099 where the Inheritor Daemos is killed before being revived in a clone body; Miguel teams up with Lady Spider (May Reily), and Six-Armed Spider-Man to find the Inheritors' weaknesses. As revived Daemos is closing after him and his teammates, Miguel needs the Alchemax's help to investigate the Inheritors' weakness. As Daemos arrives in 2099, Six-Armed Spider-Man sacrifices his life to buy some time for Spider-Man 2099 and Lady Spider to create an energy field to trap Daemos.\n\nWith Daemos trapped in an energy field, Miguel assures Lady Spider that he will not get out, explaining that the energy level holding him multiplies exponentially the more he shoves at it. He then tells her that they have an appointment with Tyler Stone. Upon meeting, Miguel spots a ceiling laser pointed at him. Miguel is less than happy with Tyler for stranding him in 2014, Tyler points out that he has returned regardless. Miguel then requests the use of the lab adjacent to Daemos' cell so they can dissect his previous body. Though Tyler is hesitant to assist him, Miguel points out that he will have to go home sooner or later. As the Spiders get to work on Daemos' corpse, his reincarnation speaks to them through the cameras, boasting that he can't be contained, Miguel retorts that the energy field will kill him before he breaks free. As they get to work, Miguel asks Lady Spider to check out the interdimensional jumping device he obtained from another version of Miguel who tried to warn him about the Inheritors. He demonstrates how Alchemax's computers can show how to work the device, to Lady Spider's amazement. As Lady Spider figures out how to work the device, Daemos attempts to broker a deal; if they let him go, he promises that he and his siblings would leave them alone. After quickly failing to find an alternate food source for the Inheritors to ingest, Miguel rejects Daemos' offer for two reasons: One, he's evil, Two that he and Lady Spider wouldn't sacrifice their counterparts to save their own skins. Miguel then runs over the bio lab to pick up something, it is unknown what he seeks but it was something Alchemax had cured in the 2040s. Lady Spider then calls him, stating that Daemos had gone into a trance-like state. His actions become apparent as Daemos commits suicide so he can be reborn in a new clone body. However, the new Daemos is accosted by the Punisher 2099, who strikes him three times with a titanium baseball bat and then lights the Inheritor up with a plasma gas cannon. Though it doesn't harm him, the flames melt the floor beneath Daemos' feet, sending him falling into the downtown areas of Nueva York. Punisher then calls Miguel, advising him to get somewhere safe before Daemos comes back. Miguel and Lady Spider take the interdimensional jumping device to the safe zone on Earth-13, only to find a great number of Spiders massacred.\n\nWhen horrified by the sight of fallen Spiders, Miguel and Lady Spider find Toei Spider-Man's Leopardon and decide to repair it. Unable to return to 2099 with Daemos still there, they transport the remains of the robot to Lady Spider's universe of Earth-803. Miguel tells Lady Spider that Leoparddon needs radiation in its arsenal for their next confrontation with the Inheritors due to their weakness. But as they get to work on the robot, Norman Osborn-803 calls his fellow Six Men of Sinistry to take out Lady Spider in revenge for her thwarting their attempted kidnapping of the mayor. Unwilling to waste any time, Miguel leaps into action, clawing at Green Goblin, bluffing him into thinking that he cut his throat, when he deliberately missed, forcing the Goblin to retreat. Miguel gets hit in the back by Electro and is thrown out the window, while Lady Spider takes cover inside Leopardon's head as Electro unleashes a lightning storm at her. The robot then reactivates, causing its right hand and foot to disable Electro and Vulture respectively, before Miguel fires upon Octopus with Kraven's ship, knocking him out cold. As they take Leopardon to rejoin the other Spiders, Lady Spider wonders where Harold Osborn will take her to dinner. Miguel assures her that she'll have plenty of time to figure that out after they return from Loomworld and finish the Inheritors once and for all.\n\nFinally arriving to Loomworld on Earth-001 to aid the surviving Spider-Totems, Miguel and Lady Spider present Takuya Yamashiro a newly improved Leopardon. After the Inheritors are defeated and Master Weaver killed by the Superior Spider-Man, the surviving Spiders need to return to their respective realities one by one. With most of the Spiders sent back to their respective realities thanks to Spider-UK and Earth-616 Peter Parker, only Spider-Man 2099 and Spider-Gwen remain. Suddenly, Superior Spider-Man begins destroying the Web of Life and Destiny with Morlun's dagger, attempting to change his fate but only causing further harm to fabric of realities. Miguel and Gwen Stacy attempt to help the 616 Spiders against Otto, but Peter Parker-616 orders them to return to their respective time lines before the portal maintained by the Great Web closes. Before departing, Miguel reveals to Gwen that in the end Peter takes his body back from Otto and the good guys win.\n\nAttempting to return home after the Spider-Verse, Miguel ends up in post-apocalyptic year 2099 of Earth-9200 (from \"The Incredible Hulk: Future Imperfect\" storyline). Miguel meets Ash and Sonner and tries learn what happened in this universe, until he is found by Maestro, who mistakes Miguel for his world's Peter Parker and imprisons him in the same cell as a woman named Strange, and also kills Ash and Sonner, putting their dead bodies on the Hollywood sign. With the help of Strange, Miguel is able to return the time period he was in before the \"Spider-Verse\". However, he is still unable to return to 2099 and is stuck in 2015 of Earth-616 again.\n\nFollowing the \"Secret Wars\" storyline, Miguel is stranded in the present.\n\nFollowing a crimefighting incident gone wrong, Miguel considers retirement. He is approached by Peter Parker, who offers Miguel a job at Parker Industries which Miguel accepts. Miguel resolves to improve the world without being Spider-Man again. However, his use of a time portal he built to investigate the future continues to reveal a devastated 2099. When his lover, Tempest, is killed in a terrorist attack, Miguel is compelled back into action to track down the man responsible: Doctor Chronos, the man who apparently taught robotics to Victor von Doom before his expulsion. During the subsequent fight, Chronos reveals that he is working for an organization known as \"The Fist\", before he dies from his injuries. Meanwhile, Roberta Mendez - the Captain America of 2099 - is revealed to have been trapped in the past shortly after the bounty hunter Venture escapes into the present through Miguel's time portal. Despite Miguel and Roberta's best efforts, Venture is retrieved and recruited by the Fist. Miguel comes into conflict with the Inhuman Lash when a Parker Industries scientist named Rhonda Flemming is revealed to be an Inhuman when she undergoes accidental Terrigenesis. Upon hatching, Rhonda's judgement is clouded by her newfound power. After sending Lash back to where he came, she rechristens herself Glorianna and begins attacking civilians. She accidentally impales her girlfriend Jasmine and disappears. Miguel later discovers from Jasmine that Tempest is actually alive, in a coma, having been secreted away by her mother, Loraine Monroe. He distracts Man Mountain Marko, who was hired by Loraine to stand guard at her room, long enough for Parker Industries to covertly relocate Tempest. Spider-Man 2099 confronts Loraine and discovers that she has powers. She confesses to have killed her second husband, because he was stalking Tempest, and that she wanted Tempest away from Miguel for protection. Miguel learns that the body of Doctor Chronos has been moved to Denver, Colorado, where a scientist named Doctor Sonny Frisco is working on a time travel experiment using Glorianna as a guinea pig. When Venture discovers him, Spider-Man fights him until Glorianna sends him back to 2099. He's then captured by that era's Venom and Doctor Octopus. Miguel later wakes up in Alchemax, which is run by that era's Sinister Six. He's freed by Kasey, who takes him to his brother Gabe, where he learns that The Fist is responsible for what happened in the future. The Sinister Six discover that the Goblin is actually Father Jennifer D'Angelo, an undercover ally of Kasey. After receiving a message from the Sinister Six, Miguel and Kasey go to Alchemax to rescue Father Jennifer. Upon escaping, Spider-Man and Father Jennifer arrive at an area where the time door appears, but Jennifer is killed by Doctor Octopus.\n\nDuring the \"Civil War II\" storyline, Roberta goes back to 2099 to find her family, despite Miguel's warnings. The Public Eye attempt to arrest her, until she's rescued by Ravage 2099. In the present, Miguel receives a call from Peter Parker, who tells him of a vision the Inhuman Ulysses had of the future: the death of Roberta Mendez. He goes back to 2099. Roberta learns from Ravage about the Anti-Powers Act, a law outlawing super-powers. Roberta and Ravage are taken to the downtown area by Hawkeye 2099, where they meet the remaining heroes. Spider-Man convinces Doctor Strange 2099 to help him out in exchange for his help in eliminating the A.P.A. Meanwhile, the CEO of Alchemax calls on Power Pack to defeat the heroes. Upon finding Roberta, Strange takes Spider-Man downtown, while Roberta leaves to find her husband upon learning his location. Roberta finds her husband Harry, who claims that she died and that they don't have kids, and gets captured by Power Pack. After Strange reveals that the CEO of Alchemax is J. Jonah Jameson, Spider-Man rallies the heroes to launch an assault on S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ and rescue Roberta. In the process, they discover that \"Jameson\" and \"Power Pack\" are actually Skrull impostors. Spider-Man and Roberta then go back to 2016.\n\nWhile on a flight to Denver, Miguel encounters Elektra in the bathroom, who questioned his connection with the Fist. Upon landing, Elektra reveals to Miguel and Roberta that the Fist is an offshoot of the Hand who broke off from it to pursue bigger plans: the destruction of the United States. Elektra goes to the Fist's HQ after knocking out Miguel and Roberta, who chase after her once they recover. They later help Elektra defeat Doctor Frisco when the base explodes. While being interrogated, Doctor Frisco reveals that the Fist brought the Sinister Six of 2099 to the present and are heading to Chicago to search a Greek witch named Medea. Arriving in Chicago, Spider-Man and Roberta witness people being turned into zombies by a spell cast by Medea. Elektra stabs Medea from behind, killing her and restoring the zombified people. Tempest wakes up from her coma and is told that she is permanently paralyzed. Informed of this, Miguel goes to the hospital only to encounter Man Mountain Marko, who was hired by Tyler Stone to delay Spider-Man 2099 while he took Tempest with him. Upon recovering, Miguel heads back to Parker Industries HQ and finds Dr. Frisco being chased by Electro 2099. After defeating Electro, Miguel takes him to his private lab.\n\nUsing a computer simulation, Miguel and Lyla trick Electro 2099 into revealing the date on which the Fist's plans come to fruition: May 15, 2019. Sonny upgrades Miguel's time portal to allow him to travel to 2019, where he puts an end to the Fist's plans with help from that era's Tempest and their son Gabri, who has taken on the mantle of Spider-Man 2099. Tempest tells Miguel that he died while rescuing her from Tyler Stone, but he insists on going through with the rescue attempt for fear that changing the past again will lead to more disasters. Miguel is indeed killed when a post-hypnotic suggestion planted by Stone prompts Tempest to stab him. Due to the hypnosis, Tempest does not realize that she is the one who killed Miguel, thus preventing her from giving him a more specific warning when they met in 2099. However, Miguel is transported to 2099 and resurrected by Doctor Strange 2099, with help from Roberta and Gabri, as well as being informed that they are finally entering a year 2100 at Happy New Year.\n\nMiguel O'Hara is a highly skilled geneticist and gifted with genius-level intelligence. Though he did not take combat training, he quickly develops an effective fighting style that maximizes the use of his superhuman agility, strength, senses, and intellect.\n\nAfter having half of his DNA re-written with the genetic code of a spider, Miguel develops a wide array of powers. He has the proportionate strength, speed, and agility of a spider. If his strength is equal to that of the original Spider-Man, he should be able to lift a maximum of approximately 10–15 tons and leap roughly 30 feet in the air. His speed allows him to dodge gunfire from a short distance away and move several times faster than a normal human being can. His superhuman agility and dexterity allow him to perform complicated acrobatic and gymnastic maneuvers that would be impossible for even the most highly trained athlete and help him achieve and regain perfect balance even under extraordinary combat situations. Access to these abilities are largely instinctual, due to his re-written genetic code.\n\nMiguel's powers give him increased vitality and resistance to injury. He once suffered a punctured lung, broken ribs and major abrasions, and was still able to make it to a hospital where doctors said only his amazing constitution kept him alive. His metabolism allows him to heal a few times faster than a normal human, although he does not have a superhuman healing factor such as Wolverine.\n\nUnlike the original Spider-Man, Miguel does not possess an extra-sensory \"spider-sense\" that warns him of oncoming threats. Instead, Miguel possess enhanced vision and hearing, which the original Spider-Man does not have. He can see in complete darkness and can accurately perceive and zoom-in on people and objects that are a great distance away. His enhanced vision causes him to be extremely light sensitive, however, requiring that he wear tinted glasses to avoid being blinded in normal lighting conditions, which he passes off as a side effect of the Rapture. The irises of Miguel's eyes became red, although when he uses his enhanced sight to zoom-in on an object that is far away, his eyes often become completely white, with no visible irises or pupils. Thanks to his enhanced vision and reflexes, he can accurately perceive objects in motion that a normal person would see only as a blur. Miguel's hearing is also enhanced, though not to the extent of his vision.\n\nSpinnerets in his forearms enable him to fire an organic adhesive substance from the top of his wrists, usable in a wide variety of ways. Like the original Spider-Man (Peter Parker), Spider-Man 2099 can travel at high speeds swinging on \"web-lines\" when necessary, and he can use his webbing to ensnare enemies. Over time, this webbing loses its tensile strength and can be removed. Pressure applied to his forearms has occasionally caused him to release webbing without meaning to.\n\nAlthough the original Spider-Man is able to have any part of his body (such as his back) adhere to surfaces through unknown and invisible means, Miguel can only cling to surfaces with his hands and feet due to angled talons protruding from his fingers and toes. These talons are not retractable but can fold down when Miguel concentrates and do so automatically when he touches his own skin so that he does not injure himself. Though only approximately an inch in length, Miguel O'Hara's talons are capable of easily slicing through flesh and plastic. They can even rend metal armor.\n\nMiguel possesses venom glands and pronounced, pointed canine teeth. When he bites a foe, he can release a toxin that temporarily paralyzes his enemy. While the exact makeup of his venom has never been discussed, it seems powerful enough to affect such foes as Thanatos and it differs from real spider venom in that it does not seem to act as a digestive agent. Miguel also cannot retract his fangs and so has had to learn how to speak in a way that does not reveal his teeth. On occasion, this has caused others to accuse him of mumbling.\n\nSpider-Man 2099's costume is made from Unstable Molecule Fabric or \"UMF.\" Originally invented by Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, this fabric was made to be indestructible and was designed to interact with super-powers without hampering them. Miguel uses his talons through the UMF gloves and boots without tearing the cloth. The UMF does not dull the strength or sharpness of his talons in the process. The UMF costume has also offered Spider-Man 2099 limited protection from energy weapons, as the energy blasts could not penetrate it. However, this did not prevent Miguel from suffering the impact of the blasts, and he was still seriously injured. Likewise, if Miguel fell from a great height, the UMF would not protect him from the impact of landing, it simply would not tear in the process.\n\nSpider-Man 2099 has a small, web-like airfoil attached to the back of his costume. The material for the air foil was obtained from a Thorite's hang-glider and is made from a material called \"Lyte Byte\" which is specially made to capture and direct air currents and gives off a low level of anti-gravity particles. This allows Spider-Man 2099 limited gliding abilities, valuable since the New York City of 2099 has massive skyscrapers that are often too far away for him to fire a web-line for travel. The Lyte Byte material also allows him to shift direction while in free fall and is very good at slowing down his descent, allowing him to fall from great distances without reaching terminal velocity. However, this does not grant Spider-Man 2099 actual flight. By the second volume of \"Spider-Man 2099\" series, however, he had added anti-gravity material to the back of his costume that enables him to fly.\n\nWhile in costume, Miguel often reinforces his mask with webbing so that enemies cannot remove it if he is captured or disabled in some way, provided he is not held for long enough for his webbing to degrade. He uses his talons to cut the webbing off when he removes his costume.\n\nAnother version of Spider-Man 2099 was one of the alternative Avengers seen briefly during the Destiny War in \"Avengers Forever\" #12. During the \"Spider-Verse\" storyline, the Destiny War version of Spider-Man 2099 was killed by Morlun.\n\nIn \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #439, the issue takes place 1,000 years (2998, based on the release date of the issue) in the future. Two archaeologists stumble across relics belonging to Spider-Man (such as his webshooters). They speculate on his career, and discuss the other heroes who were inspired by him, such as Spider-Girl, Spider-Man 2099, and Spider-Man 2211.\n\nIn issue #26 of \"What The--?!\", a humor anthology title, the character Spider-Ham (an anthropomorphic pig who parodied the original Spider-Man) was reworked for a parody of Spider-Man 2099 entitled \"Spider-Ham 15.88\". A laboratory janitor named \"Piguel O'Hara\" accidentally falls into a vat of spider venom and gains spider-powers. A short (and confusing) excursion as Spider-Ham 2099 follows, including encounters with parody versions of Punisher 2099 and Ravage 2099.\n\nThe appearance of Proteus in the 2099 era before Doom 2099 comes into power causes a divergence from the original Marvel 2099, creating a new parallel reality. This new timeline where Miguel is unmasked and leaves his world before Doom takes power is now identified as Earth-6375.\n\nAfter battling the Exiles, a team of heroes from parallel worlds who attempt to fix damaged realities, the villain Proteus possesses the body of John \"Net Prophet\" Tensen and escapes to the parallel Earth designated Earth-928 via Jordan Boone's Virtual Unreality portal (mirroring the Net Prophet's first arrival into 2099). This is the world of the Marvel 2099 future, though Proteus arrives at a time before Doom took over leadership of the United States.\n\nProteus then possesses the Hulk of that era. Spider-Man 2099 joins forces with the Exiles to stop him. Proteus, being too strong for his opponent, unmasks Miguel O'Hara before the public. Spider-Man 2099 then convinces Proteus that coming to his reality was a mistake and that he should move on. Feeling guilty that he has inflicted the crazed villain onto a parallel Earth, and now afraid of being hunted down since his identity has been exposed, Spider-Man 2099 joins the Exiles in their quest to stop Proteus and leaves his world.\n\nAfter Proteus is defeated, Spider-Man 2099 remains with the Exiles to help them continue to fix damaged realities. After a couple more adventures, the Exiles are scattered across the multiverse and Miguel O'Hara winds up on a parallel world where he is found by a red-haired woman living on the beach, later revealed to be that world's Mary Jane Watson. After an unspecified amount of time, the woman and Miguel fall in love and he remains on that world. The Exiles locate Miguel but decide to leave him in the parallel world, deciding at least one of them should be allowed a happy, normal life.\n\nYears later, he and Mary Jane are still together when the attacks of Morlun during the \"Spider-Verse\" storyline are felt. Miguel learned about Morlun during Miguel's tenure with the Exiles, and senses Morlun is out there killing spiders. He gathers some of the Exiles' old equipment and prepares to flee to Earth-616, where Morlun was once killed. However, just as Miguel and Mary Jane are about to make the jump, Morlun arrives and kills that Miguel in front of the Miguel from the original timeline stranded in the present. Morlun disappears and the portal closes, leaving the Exiles' Miguel dead and the 616 Miguel desperate to find Peter Parker.\n\nIn the 2009 miniseries \"Timestorm 2009–2099\", O'Hara is younger than in his original version. His father is a scientist at Alchemax and Miguel himself is a high school student attending the Pym Academy. Miguel lives with his father with no siblings, as opposed to the original incarnation in which he lives with his mother and brother Gabriel.\n\nMiguel received his powers in an accident caused by the Timestorm. At the time, he was attending a class on biological re-engineering in which he and his classmates were altering the genetic code of various bugs. When the Timestorm happened, his DNA was mixed with that of the spider he was working on. His powers are extremely similar to those of Peter Parker's, including a spider-sense, with the exception of Miguel's organic webbing, that is shot from the top of his hand. As opposed to the original incarnation of Miguel O'Hara, the Timestorm version does not appear to have razor sharp \"talons\" on his hands and feet.\n\nAfter gaining his powers, he creates his Spider-Man costume in a 3D printer and helps a time-lost Peter Parker battle Scorpion 2099 (Kron Stone, who was caught in the same accident as Miguel). The original Spider-Man advises him not to be a hero as it is too dangerous, and he instead uses his powers in a fighting arena against the Atlantean Human Torch.\n\nDuring the 2014 \"Spider-Verse\" storyline, the Timestorm version of Spider-Man 2099 was killed by Morlun.\n\nDuring the \"Secret Wars\" storyline, the Battleworld domain of 2099 is where Alchemax reigns supreme. However, this is not the same reality as Earth-928 as Miguel is the legitimate son of Tyler Stone and goes by his birth name Miguel Stone. He is the morally dubious head of Alchemax which he took over from his handicapped father. Miguel presides over the Alchemax-sponsored Avengers consisting of Hercules and future versions of Iron Man (Sonny Frisco), Captain America (Roberta Mendez), Black Widow (Tania), and Hawkeye (Max). When the teams comes into conflict with Defenders consisting of Hulk 2099, Silver Surfer, Valkyrie, Strange, and Roman the Sub-Mariner, Miguel offers them to go legitimate and work for Alchemax. The moment their leader Strange refuses, he orders the entire team detained at any cost. The teams though end up having to work together in the end when Martin Hargood, the descendant of Baron Mordo breaks into Alchemax and frees the Dweller-in-Darkness to wreak havoc. Miguel learned that his father was the one who called the hit on Captain America and threw him out the window. The Avengers and the Defenders succeeded in stopping Mordo and re-banishing the Dweller-in-Darkness. Miguel decides to let the Defenders keep operating as good guys in an act of gratitude towards them.\n\nDuring the events of \"Infinity Wars,\" Gamora used the Infinity Stones to fold the universe in half, resulting in the creation of Warp World, where characters and histories were merged. Spider-Man 2099 merged with Ravage 2099 to become Arachknight 2099 (who based himself on the hero Arachknight, an amalgamation of Spider-Man and Moon Knight). In this world, Miguel Ravage accessed primal arachnid DNA through a gene-surgery accident and fights using the \"spider-beast\" within.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was an influential member of the Lunar Society.\n\nWhitehurst was born in Congleton, Cheshire, to a clockmaker, the elder John Whitehurst. Receiving only a slight formal education, the younger Whitehurst was taught clockmaking by his father, who also encouraged the boy's pursuit of knowledge. In 1734, at the age of twenty-one, Whitehurst visited Dublin to inspect a clock of curious construction of which he had heard.\n\nAbout 1736, Whitehurst entered into business for himself at Derby, where he soon obtained great employment, distinguishing himself by constructing several ingenious pieces of mechanism. Besides other works, he made the clock for the town hall, and on 6 September 1737, he was enrolled as a burgess in reward. He also made thermometers, barometers, and other philosophical instruments, and interested himself in contriving waterworks. He was consulted in almost every undertaking in Derbyshire and in the neighbouring counties in which skill in mechanics, pneumatics, and hydraulics was required.\n\nIn 1774, Whitehurst obtained a post at the Royal Mint in London. In 1775, on the passage of the act for the better regulation of the gold coinage, without any solicitation on his part, he was appointed stamper of the money-weights on the recommendation of the Duke of Newcastle. Whitehurst moved to London, where he passed the rest of his life in scientific pursuits. other distinguished scientists visited his house in Colt Court, Fleet Street, formerly the abode of James Ferguson.\n\nIn 1772 - aged 59 years- he invented the \"pulsation engine\" (not to be mixed up with a Pulser pump), a water-raising device which was the precursor of the hydraulic ram.\n\nIn 1778, Whitehurst published his theory on geological strata in \"An Inquiry into the Original State and Formation of the Earth\". He had begun this while living at Derby, originally intending to facilitate the discovery of valuable minerals beneath the Earth's surface. He pursued his researches with so much ardour, that \"the exposure he incurred\" tended to impair his health.\n\nOn 13 May 1779, Whitehurst was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. \nIn 1783, he was sent to examine the Giant's Causeway and the volcanic remains in the north of Ireland, embodying his observations in the second edition of his \"Inquiry\".\n\nAbout 1784 he contrived a system of ventilation for St. Thomas's Hospital.\nIn 1787, age 74, a year before his death, he published \"An Attempt towards obtaining invariable Measures of Length, Capacity, and Weight, from the Mensuration of Time\" (London). Whitehurst wanted to study the shape of the earth by measuring differences in gravitation. For this, he studied heavy pendulums in different locations. He measured the length of the pendulum, the frequency of its oscillation and the length of the path its head was moving. He compared these to theoretical values he calculated assuming the globe is spherical. Starting on the assumption that the length of a second pendulum in the latitude of London was 39.2 inches, he deduced that the length of one oscillating 42 times a minute is 80 inches, while that of one oscillating twice as many times is 20 inches. The difference between these two lengths would therefore be exactly 5 feet. He found upon experiment that the actual difference was only 59.892 inches owing to the real length of the pendulum, oscillating once a second, being 39.125 inches. He obtained rough data, from which the true lengths of pendulums, the spaces through which heavy bodies fall in a given time, and many other particulars relating to the force of gravitation and the true figure of the earth could be deduced.\n\nOn 9 January 1745, Whitehurst married Elizabeth Gretton, daughter of George Gretton, rector of Trusley and Dalbury in Derbyshire. \nIn 1788 Whitehurst died, 75 years old, at his house in Bolt Court, Fleet Street, and was buried beside his wife in St. Andrew's burying-ground in Gray's Inn Road. There were no surviving children.\n\nIt has been suggested that Whitehurst is the model for Joseph Wright of Derby's picture of \"A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery\" in the Derby Museum and Art Gallery.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1868398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868398", "title": "Ivan Goran Kovačić", "text": "Ivan Goran Kovačić\n\nIvan Goran Kovačić (; 21 March 1913 – 13 July 1943) was a Croatian poet and writer.\n\nHe was born in Lukovdol (part of Vrbovsko), a town in Gorski Kotar, to a Croat father, Ivan Kovačić, and Transylvanian Jewish mother Ruža (née Klein). \n\nHe attended the Gymnasium Karlovac. In his honour, the Karlovac city library, the city's oldest cultural institution founded in 1838, was renamed after him.\n\nDuring World War II, in the harsh winter of 1942, Kovačić and Vladimir Nazor volunteered for the Partisan forces to set an anti-fascist example for the world. At that time, Goran was already ill with tuberculosis and Nazor was advanced in age, but they were motivated by their consciences. Kovačić was killed by Serbian Chetnik troops in an east-Bosnian village of Vrbica near Foča on 13 July 1943. \n\nHis death is described as follows: “Like in an ancient tragedy, the one who is most opposed to evil will most cruelly die from evil. The poet who raised his voice against the Ustashian killing of Serbian people had his throat cut by Serbian Chetniks….A few reliable witnesses confirm that Goran survived the hell of the fifth offensive, but when he returned to help his ill, left-behind, friend, Dr Simo Milošević, the fascists killed both the Croatian poet and the Serbian scholar without distinction. Fascism did not look on poets or scientists anywhere in the world as being of value.”\n\nDeath is a central theme in much of Kovačić's poetry, however this is not a reflection on his life outlook. His melancholy subjects came from outside events—such as his own and his brother’s affliction with tuberculosis—rather than from an internal disposition toward the morose. Jure Kaštelan, one of Kovačić's contemporaries, expressed that Kovačić was inclined both toward romanticism and realism in his poetry, and that Kovačić had an intense perception of life.\n\nHis best known work is \"\"Jama\"\" (\"\"The Pit\"\"). He penned it during the war, while in service near the town of Livno. The poem was written out of intellectual and ethical responsibility that condemns atrocities done by the Ustaše. It has been described as a metaphor about the sufferer, martyr, and victim: “The sufferer is when a person without fault suffers. The martyr is when nonhumans torture a person. The victim is when the whips of injustice extinguish life. That is Goran’s metaphor. And his life.” His work is an example of anti-war poetry with messages against torture, mass murders and war crimes. \"Jama\" was studied in elementary schools throughout the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe poem starts with a striking metaphor of blood replacing both light and darkness as victim's eyes were plucked out with a knife. That common torture was probably a mere sadism, since the victims were mass-murdered after that anyway:\n\n"}
{"id": "1868414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868414", "title": "Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform", "text": "Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform\n\nThe Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform (LCER) is an organisation formed of members and supporters of the British Labour Party, seeking to persuade the party to adopt in its manifesto a commitment to proportional representation in all UK elections.\n\nLCER characterises the First Past the Post voting system as \"unfair and deeply flawed, leading to voter apathy, disaffection with politics, and parliaments which don't represent the people\". It campaigns for its replacement with an electoral system which is \"broadly proportional, and in which all votes matter\".\n\nThe group works closely with other organisations promoting electoral reform in the UK, including Make Votes Matter, the Electoral Reform Society and Politics for the Many. LCER is distinct from these other organisations in that it focuses its efforts on promoting proportional representation within the Labour Party. This is driven by the belief that a change to the UK's voting system can only come about via Labour:\n\"We believe that the impetus for changing the voting system must come from the Labour Party. The Conservatives will never support PR, because First Past the Post gives them such a big electoral advantage. The smaller parties already support PR, but lack the influence to bring about change. Only Labour can drive the change\".\n\nLCER originated in the 1970s as the Labour Study Group for Electoral Reform. After Labour's defeat in the 1979 general election, the group changed its name to the Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform. Early supporters included academic Ron Medlow; Robin Cook, Jeff Rooker, and Martin Linton, who went on to be Labour MPs; and activist Mary Southcott, who would later become LCER's Parliamentary and Political Officer.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s – during which Labour spent most of its time in opposition – support for LCER increased steadily among both Labour members and elected representatives, with motions on electoral reform being tabled at the party conference almost every year. In 1990, the party conference voted narrowly to commission an inquiry into electoral systems; LCER is widely credited in bringing this about. The inquiry, led by Professor Raymond Plant, recommended the introduction of the supplementary vote. Labour included in its 1997 election manifesto a pledge to hold a referendum on electoral reform; however, this pledge was never honoured, despite the work of the Jenkins Commission, in which Liberal Democrat (and former Labour MP) Lord Jenkins explored possible voting systems on behalf of incumbent Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's government.\n\nIn 2010, incoming Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron announced a referendum on electoral reform in return for the support of the Liberal Democrats in a governing coalition. The referendum, which offered the Alternative Vote (AV) as an alternative to FPTP, was held in May 2011. AV is not a proportional voting system, and was seen by many electoral reformers as no great improvement on FPTP: Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg called it a \"miserable little compromise\", and some leading proponents of electoral reform considered AV to be such a poor system that they voted for the status quo. LCER did support AV in the 2011 referendum, via the Yes2AV umbrella group, but following the heavy and widely predicted defeat of the \"Yes\" campaign, LCER's activities fell into abeyance for several years, with activists exhausted and the organisation having spent almost all its money.\n\nActivity increased again in 2015 and has been rising steadily ever since; Make Votes Matter notes that one third of Labour MPs, 77 Constituency Labour Parties, and two trade unions affiliated to the Labour Party have expressed support for proportional representation.\n\nMany Labour MPs past and present have supported LCER and its activities. In the past, this included such high-profile figures as Mo Mowlam, Robin Cook, Paul Flynn, Clare Short, Tessa Jowell, Rhodri Morgan and Janet Anderson.\n\nLCER currently has prominent supporters from both the left and the right wings of the Labour party. The current Chair is Paul Blomfield, whilst the Vice-Chairs are Ruth Cadbury, Susan Elan Jones, Sandy Martin and Daniel Zeichner. In 2017, Cat Smith co-wrote the foreword to a report jointly written by LCER with Make Votes Matter.\n\nOther current supporters include MPs David Lammy, Jonathan Reynolds, Tulip Siddiq, Stephen Kinnock, Alan Whitehead, John McDonnell and, from the House of Lords, Baroness Lister.\n\nLCER does not advocate the introduction of a specific system of proportional representation, believing that the selection of a new voting system should be the work of a Royal Commission. Rather, it campaigns for the Labour Party:\n\n\nLCER's support for proportional representation is based on the belief that PR systems are more democratic than FPTP, but also on evidence that PR voting systems are associated with societies with higher levels of social and economic equality; with higher levels of public spending and redistribution; and with a lower propensity to engage in violent conflict.\n\n"}

In 1863, he entered the Polytechnic Institute in Vienna (now known as Vienna University of Technology), where he studied for two years before being recruited into the Austrian Navy as a machinist. In the Navy, he received his first mechanical experience and training. De la Barre immigrated to the United States in October 1866, landing in New York, then settling in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he found employment as a draftsman and engineer. He served as engineer for the Centennial Exposition held in Philadelphia in 1876. He was married to Louisa Verena Merian, daughter of Louis and Marie (Glaser) Merian of Philadelphia, in 1870 in Philadelphia.

Washburn), founder of the Washburn-Crosby Mills in Minneapolis, to be head engineer and superintendent of his mills. While at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, de la Barre had learned that a new process for milling flour had been invented in Europe that involved passing the grain through a series of rollers, rather than the large round millstones used in America. Washburn sent him to Europe to learn about the process firsthand. What de la Barre discovered was that in Hungary, the mills were using large porcelain rollers shaped more or less like rolling pins and that each series of rollers ground the grain finer and finer. On his return to Minneapolis, de la Barre designed rollers made from steel instead of porcelain. Using de la Barre's steel rollers, the Washburn-Crosby Mills could mill flour that was cleaner, more uniform, and with less energy than ever before. The process was no less than a revolution in milling.\n\n"}

By this time, although disco music was still popular, other styles such as punk and heavy metal were also doing well on the charts, so the team decided to incorporate a rockier sound into some of the songs. Other songs had a more soul/R&B feel to them, and in all it was probably Summer's most diverse album to date. The fusion of rock and disco was particularly evident, and synthesizers were used to augment the sound for a more electronic and dance oriented electro music in the first two songs on the album – \"Hot Stuff\" and \"Bad Girls\", which also became the first two singles to be released from the album. Both were huge hits and made number one on the American singles chart. The former also won Summer a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and became popular again in the 1990s when it was featured in \"The Full Monty\" and again in the film \"The Martian\". \"Dim All the Lights\" was the third single and also became a huge hit, peaking at number two in the U.S.\n\n\"Bad Girls\" was universally acclaimed by music reviews. The album was certified double platinum for sales in excess of 2 million copies in the U.S. on December 1, 1993 (double albums are certified per disc by the RIAA rather than per complete unit). It also became her second consecutive number-one album in the U.S., also spending three weeks at number one in Canada on the \"RPM 100\" national albums chart. As well as the aforementioned Grammy Award for \"Hot Stuff\" (Best Female Rock Vocal Performance), the song \"Bad Girls\" was also nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. \"Dim All the Lights\" was nominated for Best Disco Recording and the album itself was nominated for Album of the Year. The album was also nominated for \"Favourite Pop/Rock Album\" at the American Music Awards of 1980. The single took an American Music Award for \"Favorite Pop/Rock Single\", while Summer took awards for \"Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist\" & \"Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist\".\n\n\"Bad Girls\" would be Summer's final studio album for Casablanca Records, who ended 1979 with the release of a greatest hits double-album. For her next studio album, Summer wanted to branch out into other formats of music but since she and Casablanca could not come to an agreement on her musical direction, Summer opted to sign a new deal with Geffen Records, the then-new label formed by David Geffen. Her first album with Geffen Records was more rock/new wave oriented. In the meantime, Casablanca chose to release more singles from the \"Bad Girls\" album into 1980: \"Sunset People\" and \"Walk Away\", the latter of which became a moderate hit reaching the top 40. Casablanca/PolyGram also released a special edition compilation entitled \"Walk Away – Greatest Hits 1977–1980\", which featured a selection of her hits from the \"Bad Girls\" period and the preceding years. In 2003 Universal Music, owners of the Casablanca/PolyGram back catalogue since 1998, re-issued \"Bad Girls\" as a digitally remastered and expanded deluxe edition.\n\nThe RIAA site has the album certified as 1,000,000 sales as of May 3, 1979 (certification on December 1, 1993, is a format change and not due to sales). The RIAA did not introduce multi-plantinum awards until 1984, thus there are no artist with multi-plantinum certifications on the RIAA web site before 1984. Bad Girls the album was designated Triple Platinum in 1979. It has sold over 4 million copies in the US.\n\nAll tracks produced by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte except \"My Baby Understands\" by Donna Summer and Juergen Koppers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Because Polish adjectives have different forms for the genders, Tarnowska is the form for a female family member.\n\nThe Tarnowski family was one of the oldest and most powerful magnate families in Poland. It reached its apex in the 14th, 15th and the 16th centuries, when members of the Tarnów, Melsztyn and later Jarosław branches held prominent positions beside the Piast and Jagiellon kings of Poland. From father to son, the Tarnowski family held ten times the office of voivode of Kraków Voivodeship and six times the office of castellan of Kraków. \n\nThe history of the family started with the trusted advisor of the last Piast kings Comes Spytek z Melsztyna, the progenitor of the Tarnowski-Melsztyński-Jarosławski family. By 1320 he held the office of voivode of Krakow, and from 1331 the highest secular office in the Kingdom of Poland, castellan of Krakow. For his military service, King Władysław I the Elbow-high gave him large estates on the Dunajec river, where Spytek founded the city of Tarnow in 1330 and built two stronghold castles in Tarnow and Melsztyn around 1340.\n\nAfter the death of Spytek, the castle of Melsztyn was inherited by his son Jan z Melsztyna, who like his father was from 1360 voivode and castellan of Kraków. His younger brother, the castellan of Wiślica Rafał z Tarnowa, became the owner of Tarnow. Rafał expanded his estates, adding land in Sandomierz, Wielowieś and Dzików.\n\nThe son of Jan z Melsztyna, Spytek z Melsztyna, was the next owner of Melsztyn. He was voivode of Krakow, Feudal Lord of Podolia, and hero of the 1399 battle of Worskla. Rafał's son Jan z Tarnowa was appointed General Starost of Ruthenia, and both voivode and castellan of Kraków.\n\nThe Tarnowski-Melsztyński family achieved the highest offices in the country as well as extraordinary wealth and huge feudal estates, including land in Jarosław, Sambor, Podole, etc. Their most significant role in the history of Poland was to organise the union of Queen Jadwiga and Władysław II Jagiełło and to initiate their coronation.\n\nAfter the death of Spytek z Melsztyna and the death of his son, who was also named Spytek z Melsztyna, in the 1439 battle of Grotniki, the Melsztyn line declined. In the Tarnów line, the sons of Jan z Tarnowa fought in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 and after that divided the family property. Jan the voivode of Kraków Voivodeship settled in Tarnów, and the voivode of Sandomierz Voivodeship Spytek became the owner of Jarosław, where he started a new branch of the family, called the \"Leliwita branch\".\n\nJan z Tarnowa had five sons, of which Jan Amor Starszy Tarnowski and Jan Gratus Tarnowski together with their cousin, Spytek z Jarosławia, died with King Władysław III of Poland in the 1444 Battle of Varna. His third son Jan Rafał Tarnowski became a priest and the last two, Jan Feliks Tarnowski became voivode of Lublin Voivodeship, while Jan Amor Młodszy Tarnowski inherited Tarnów and was appointed voivode of Kraków, and in 1490 castellan of Kraków.\n\nThe son of Jan Amor Młodszy, Jan Amor Tarnowski, became Great Crown Hetman, voivode of Kraków and castellan of Kraków. In 1540 he built a castle and founded the city of Tarnopol (1548).\n\nThe Tarnowski family used the \"Leliwa coat of arms\" and their motto was: \"Tendite ad astra viri\". It is a quotation from Valerius Flaccus' \"Argonautica\", book I, verse 563.\n\n\nSome of the prominent residences of the Tarnowski family are:\n\n\n"}

From 1974 to 1986 he served as President of Austria.\n\nBorn in Niederkappel, Upper Austria, Kirschläger was orphaned at the age of 11. He graduated from high school in Horn in 1935 with distinction and started to study law at the University of Vienna. However, after the Anschluss of Austria in 1938, he had to give up his studies. Without joining the NSDAP, which he refused to do, his scholarship was revoked and Kirchschläger could not finance his studies any longer. Kirchschläger worked as a bank clerk in 1938 until he was drafted to service in the infantry of the Wehrmacht in the summer of 1939. Kirchschläger fought as a soldier from the very beginning of the war, first during the invasion of Poland, later on the Western Front, and after 1941 against Russia on the Eastern Front.\n\nIn late 1940, in order to get out of the military, he used a two-month front-leave to prepare for the final exam (Staatsexamen) of his law studies. Legend has it that he was working up to 20 hours a day, while keeping himself awake with large amounts of honey. Subsequently, he passed the exams and graduated to Doctor iuris.\n\nHowever, he was sent back to the Eastern Front, where he was wounded in 1942. Towards the end of war, he was captain and training officer at the military academy at Wiener Neustadt in the Vienna region. In early April 1945, commanding a company of cadets fighting approaching Soviet troops, he was badly wounded on his leg, an injury from which he never fully recovered.\n\nAfter the war, Kirchschläger worked as a district judge until 1954 in Langenlois and later Vienna. In 1954, he got the chance to work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, although he did not speak any foreign languages. In order to take part in the negotiations on the Austrian State Treaty, he taught himself English in only a few months. From 1967 until 1970, he was ambassador in Prague. Despite orders not to do so, he issued exit visas to Czech citizens who tried to flee from the Communists during the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. From 1970-74 he was Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nKirchschläger was elected President of Austria in 1974. In a programmatic lecture at Innsbruck University in February 1971 he outlined his understanding of an \"ethical foreign policy\". In 1974, he issued a pardon to convicted Austrian Nazi war criminal Franz Novak, who had coordinated the railroad deportation of European Jews to concentration and extermination camps.\n\nIn 1980 he was elected for a second term with an approval rate of 80%, the highest rate ever obtained in any presidential elections. In February 1984, he paid the first state visit of an Austrian President to the United States.\n\nHe was married to Herma Sorger (born 15 May 1916, Vienna – died 30 May 2009, Vienna) from 17 August 1940 until his death; they had two children: Christa (born 14 August 1944) and Walter (born 27 April 1947).\n\nRudolf Kirchschläger died of a heart attack on March 30, 2000 near Vienna, aged 85.\n\n\n\n"}

Recently, the party re-branded itself as a centrist party and distanced from the separatism of other German-speaking parties.\n\nIts long-time leader has been Andreas Pöder.\n\nThe Union for South Tyrol was founded on 2 October 1989 by the merger of the nationalist South Tyrolean Homeland Federation of Eva Klotz (2.3% in the 1988 provincial election), the national-liberal Freedom Party of South Tyrol led by Gerold Meraner and right-wing splinters from the South Tyrolean People's Party led by Alfons Benedikter.\n\nIn the 1993 provincial election the party won 4.8% of the vote and gained two seats in the Provincial Council, one for Klotz and one for Benedikter. In the 1996 general election the party had its best result ever (7.7% for party list and 19.2% in single-seat constituencies), because the South Tyrolean People's Party had formed an alliance with some Italian parties.\n\nIn the 1998 provincial election the UfS won 5.5% and Andreas Pöder, party secretary since 1994, was elected for the first time to the Council, along with Klotz. This was a turning point for the party as Pöder started to gain influence over Klotz.\n\nIn the 2003 provincial election, the UfS won 6.8% of the vote and gained two seats in the Provincial Council.\n\nIn May 2007, during a heated party congress, Pöder was re-elected party president with 76 votes in favour and 70 against. This led to a split led by Kloz, who launched a new strictly separatist movement named South Tyrolean Freedom (STF).\n\nIn the 2008 general election, severely damaged by the split and by the competition of Die Freiheitlichen (9.4%), the UfS gained only 4.2% of the vote in the Province. In the 2008 provincial election the party got only 2.3% of the vote and one elect in the Provincial Council, while STF and Die Freiheitlichen won the 14.3% and the 4.9% of the vote, respectively.\n\nThe UfS renamed itself to Citizens' Union for South Tyrol (BUfS) on 12 May 2011.\n\nIn the forthcoming 2013 provincial election the BUfS will run as part of a three-party list, along with Ladins Dolomites, a centre-left outfit, and We South Tyroleans, a left-wing split from Die Freiheitlichen. The joint list won 2.1% of the vote and Pöder was re-elected to the Provincial Council.\n\nIn the 2018 general election was League supported by BUfS. In the 2018 provincial election the party won barely 1.3% and no seats. Thus, Pöder was not elected to the Provincial Council, after 20 consecutive years of elective service. Consequently, BUfS' future and prospects look uncertain.\n\nSince the exit of Eva Klotz, the UfS tried to renew its image and to present itself as a centrist-conservative party. The 2008 party programme included defense of family values, protection of the environment, and a moderately liberal economic policy, along with the historic goal of separating South Tyrol from Italy in order to re-unify it with old historic Tyrol composed from South, North and East Tyrol, founding the \"Europaregion Tirol\" (North-and East-Tyrol are actually parts of Austria).\n\nMore recently, the party re-branded itself as a centrist, to some extent centre-left, party and distanced from its original separatism and the parties of the \"German right\". In 2011 Pöder said that, were he a German citizen, he would be a Social Democrat and in 2013 declared: \"Don't call us German right, we are a centrist movement\".\n\nThe electoral results of the UfS in the Province of Bolzano since 1992 are shown in the table below.\n\n"}

Aquidneck Island was known at the time as Rhode Island, and it later became part of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.\n\nHutchinson sailed from England to New England in 1634 with his large family. He became a merchant in Boston and served as both Deputy to the General Court and selectman. His wife was Anne Hutchinson, who became embroiled in a theological controversy with the Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony which resulted in her banishment in 1638. The Hutchinsons and 18 others departed to form the new settlement of Pocasset on the Narragansett Bay, which was renamed Portsmouth and became one of the original towns in the Rhode Island colony.\n\nHutchinson became treasurer in Portsmouth and William Coddington was the judge (or governor). A controversy compelled Coddington to relocate in 1639 and establish the town of Newport, at which time Hutchinson became the chief magistrate of Portsmouth. This lasted for less than a year, however, as he died shortly after June 1641, and his widow and many of her younger children moved to New Netherland (later in the Bronx in New York City). Mrs. Hutchinson and all but one of her children perished shortly thereafter, massacred by Indians.\n\nWilliam Hutchinson was described by Governor John Winthrop as being mild tempered, somewhat weak, and living within the shadow of his prominent and outspoken wife.\n\nWilliam Hutchinson was born into a prominent Lincolnshire family. He was the grandson of John Hutchinson (1515–1565) who had been Sheriff, Alderman, and Mayor of the town of Lincoln, dying in office during his second term as mayor. John's youngest son Edward (1564–1632) moved to Alford and had 11 children with his wife Susanna, the oldest of whom was William, who was baptized 14 August 1586 in Alford.\n\nWilliam Hutchinson grew up in Alford where he was the warden of his church in 1620 and 1621. He then became a merchant in the cloth trade and moved to London. Here he renewed a friendship from Alford with Anne Marbury, the daughter of Francis Marbury and Bridget Dryden, and the couple were married on 9 August 1612 at the Church of Saint Mary Woolnoth on Lombard Street in London. Anne's father was a clergyman, school master, and Puritan reformer who was educated at Cambridge.\n\nHutchinson and his wife raised a large family in Alford, as he prospered in his business. The couple had 14 children in England, one of whom died in infancy, and two of whom died from the plague. The Hutchinsons, particularly Anne, became very enamored with the preaching of the Reverend John Cotton who was the vicar of Saint Botolph's Church in the town of Boston, about 21 miles from Alford, and they made the day-long round trip to Boston whenever they could to hear Cotton preach.\n\nCotton had strong Puritan sympathies, however, and Archbishop William Laud began cracking down on those whose opinions differed from the established Anglican church. Cotton was forced into hiding, and then had to flee the country to avoid imprisonment. Mrs. Hutchinson was distraught to lose her mentor, and the family intended to sail with him to New England aboard the ship \"Griffin\" in 1633; however, Anne's 14th pregnancy prevented it. Instead, they sent their oldest son Edward, age 20 and under the care of Cotton, with the intention of following to New England as soon as they could. William Hutchinson's youngest brother, also named Edward, was aboard the same ship with his wife.\n\nIn 1634, William Hutchinson, his wife Anne, and his other ten children sailed from England to New England on the \"Griffin\", the same ship that had taken Cotton and their oldest son a year earlier. The family first resided at Boston where Hutchinson was admitted to the Boston Church on 26 October 1634, and his wife was admitted seven days later. He became a merchant in Boston and took the freeman's oath there in 1635. He was one of the town's Deputies to the Massachusetts Bay General Court from 1635 to 1636, and was also a selectman from 1635 to 1637, attending a selectmen's meeting for the last time in January 1638 as his tenure in Boston was coming to an end.\n\nHutchinson's wife was described by historian Thomas W. Bicknell, writing 300 years after she lived, as \"a pure and excellent woman, to whose person and conduct there attaches no stain.\" Her own contemporaries, however, did not view her in the same light. She was helpful to the sick and needy, and she was undeniably gifted in argument and speech, but her theological doctrines and open disdain toward Boston's ministers began to inflame a growing controversy between Cotton's followers and the Puritan elders. In late 1636, Governor John Winthrop wrote that Mrs. Hutchinson was \"a woman of ready wit and bold spirit,\" but she had brought several dangerous theological errors which he elaborated on in his journal. She was holding private meetings at her home, drawing many people from Boston and other towns, including many prominent citizens, and teaching them a religious view that was increasingly antithetical to the views of the Puritan church. She also began to express an open disdain for most of the Puritan ministers, with the exception of Cotton. She was finally put on trial in November 1637, convicted, and banished from the colony along with some of her followers.\n\nWilliam Hutchinson and other supporters of his wife signed the Portsmouth Compact on 7 March 1638 before leaving Boston, agreeing to form a non-sectarian government that was Christian in character. The group of signers considered going to New Netherland, but Roger Williams suggested that they purchase some land on the Narragansett Bay from the Narragansett Indians. They purchased Aquidneck Island, which was called Rhode Island at the time, and formed the settlement of Pocasset there, which was renamed Portsmouth in 1639. In June 1638, Hutchinson was the treasurer of the town and William Coddington was called judge, the name given to the chief magistrate of the settlement.\n\nThe following year, a disagreement prompted Coddington and a few other leaders to leave Portsmouth and begin a new settlement at the south end of the island called Newport. Hutchinson became the judge (governor) of the Portsmouth settlement from 1639 until 12 March 1640, when Portsmouth united with Newport to become the Colony of Rhode Island, with Coddington elected as governor of the two-town colony, and Hutchinson becoming one of his assistants. In his journal, Governor Winthrop described the 1639 disagreement in Portsmouth: \"the people grew very tumultuous and put out Mr. Coddington and the other three magistrates, and chose Mr. William Hutchinson only, a man of very mild temper and weak parts, and wholly guided by his wife, who had been the beginner of all the former troubles in the country and still continued to breed disturbance.\"\n\nHutchinson died in Portsmouth shortly after June 1641, after which his widow left Rhode Island to live in New Netherland on the border between the modern-day Bronx and Westchester County, New York. Soon after the move, she and her entire household were murdered by Indians in a massacre during a war with the Dutch in late summer 1643, with only one daughter escaping.\n\nWilliam and Anne Hutchinson had 15 children, all but the last born in England. The oldest child was Edward, a captain who died from wounds received at the battle of Wheeler's Surprise during King Philip's War. The fourth child was Faith, who married Thomas Savage, a Boston soldier and merchant. The fifth child was Bridget; she married John Sanford who succeeded William Coddington as Governor of the two towns on Rhode Island (Portsmouth and Newport) following the repeal of the Coddington Commission. Their 14th child was Susanna, the only survivor of the Indian massacre which killed her mother and six of her siblings. She was taken captive by those Indians and held by them for several years.\n\nHutchinson's sister Mary was the wife of the Reverend John Wheelwright, another banished minister who founded Exeter, New Hampshire. Prominent descendants of William and Anne Hutchinston include U.S. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush.\n\n\n\"Online sources\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1868499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868499", "title": "Valdostan Union", "text": "Valdostan Union\n\nThe Valdostan Union (, UV), also Valdostian Union or Valdotanian Union is a regionalist and centrist political party in Aosta Valley, Italy. It represents mainly the French-speaking minority in the region, and its leaders are Erik Lavévaz, party president, and Augusto Rollandin, former President of Aosta Valley.\n\nThe UV has been steadily represented in the Italian Parliament since 1976 and, due to the disappearance of the Christian Democracy party in the early 1990s, it has become the catch-all party of the region, similarly to the South Tyrolean People's Party in South Tyrol. The party steadily increased its share of vote from the 11.5% of 1973 to the 47.2% of 2003, but has since gone down, and led the regional government from 1974 to 2017 (with the exception of only three years in the early 1990s).\n\nThe UV was founded by Valdostan elements of the Italian resistance movement on 3 September 1945.\n\nThe party was originally a close ally of the Christian Democracy (DC), with which it shared government between 1946 and 1954 under Severino Caveri (UV). After that, the party distanced itself from the DC, while approaching the left-wing.\n\nAfter a five years' spell in opposition, the UV won the 1959 regional election in coalition with the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) with 51.6% against the 48.6% of an alternative coalition comprising the DC, the Italian Liberal Party (PLI), the Italian Democratic Socialist Party (PSDI) and the Italian Republican Party (PRI).\n\nThe UV–PCI–PSI coalition, led by UV's Oreste Marcoz (1959–1963) and then, again, Caveri (since 1963), governed until 1966, when the Socialists decided to switch sides and to enter in coalition with the DC, as they had done at the national level three years before. This caused the split of UV's conservative faction, which established the Valdostan Rally (RV), in order to support the coalition led by DC's Cesare Bondaz. In the 1968 regional election the UV received a mere 16.7% of the vote (the RV got 5.4%), while in 1973 Valdostan regional election, after the split of the social-democratic faction, the Progressive Valdostan Union (UVP), it stopped at 11.5% (the UPV obtained 6.7% and the RV 1.6%, while the Popular Democrats, a left-wing split of the DC, won 22.4%).\n\nThe UV returned to government in 1974 at the head of a UV–UVP–RV regionalist coalition led by Mario Andrione. In the 1978 regional election the UV returned to be the largest party with 24.7% of the vote and Andrione formed a government with the DC and the DP. In 1984 Andrione was replaced by Augusto Rollandin at the head of the government, which included the DC and the Progressive Democratic Autonomists (ADP), born by the merger of the DP and the UVP. During the 1980s the UV strengthened its role as largest party in the region: 27.1% in 1983 and 34.2% in 1988. Since the 1970s the UV was steadily represented in the Italian Parliament: Pierre Fosson was a member of the Senate from 1976 to 1987, while Luciano Caveri (scion of the party's left-wing) represented the UV in the Chamber of Deputies from 1987 to 2001. Caveri served also as undersecretary in D'Alema II Cabinet and as member of the European Parliament from 2000 to 2003.\n\nAfter having been excluded from government for three years and from the leadership of the region for three years, the UV was back in government in 1992 and, after the 1993 regional election, UV's Dino Viérin formed a centre-left cabinet with the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the Greens and the ADP (since 1994). The coalition was continued in 1998–2006 by the UV and the Democrats of the Left (DS), while Rollandin served as senator in 2001–2006. Despite its ties with the parties of the centre-left, the UV contested the 2006 general election in competition with The Union (rallied in the Autonomy Liberty Democracy list), as part of the regionalist coalition named Aosta Valley, causing the split of the Valdostan Renewal (RV), but lost and was no more represented in Parliament. This was however a turning point in regional politics: the UV dismissed the DS as coalition partners and formed a regionalist three-party coalition with Edelweiss (SA) and the Autonomist Federation (FA).\n\nIn the 2008 regional election the UV won 44.4% of the vote and 17 regional councillors (out of 35), while the regionalist coalition won 62.0% and a large majority, composed of 22 regional councillors. Augusto Rollandin, who had made a comeback to regional politics, was the most voted regional councillor with 13,836 preference votes, while incumbent President Luciano Caveri was only seventh with 2,770 votes (down from 7,313). Rollandin was thus sworn in as new President of the Region. Contextually, UV's Antonio Fosson had been elected to the Senate for the regionalist coalition: Fosson joined the For the Autonomies group and abstained from the vote of confidence on Berlusconi IV Cabinet. Both in the 2009 European Parliament election and the 2010 Aosta municipal election the UV formed an alliance with The People of Freedom (PdL). That alliance was however short-lived. In the 2013 general election UV's Albert Lanièce was elected to the Senate with support of the PdL and joined the \"Autonomies\" group.\n\nIn the 2013 regional election the UV, which had suffered the split of the new Progressive Valdostan Union (UVP), obtained 33.5% of the vote (–10.9pp from 2008) and 13 seats, and the regionalist coalition retained a narrow majority in the Regional Council. Rollandin was the most voted politician with 10,872 preference votes (2,964 less than five years before) and was re-elected President. In July 2015 the government was enlarged to the centre-left Democratic Party (PD). In June 2016, after months of negotiations, the government was joined also by the UVP. In November 2016 two regional councillors, including former senator Fosson, left the party in disagreement with Rollandin and launched For Our Valley (PNV). In March 2017 the UVP, SA (which had suffered the split of the Valdostan Autonomist Popular Edelweiss (EPAV), PNV and Autonomy Liberty Participation Ecology (ALPE) formed a new government without the UV, under President Pierluigi Marquis (SA). In October Marquis resigned and was replaced by Laurent Viérin (UVP) at the head of a coalition composed of the UV, the UVP, the EPAV and the PD.\n\nIn the 2018 general election Lanièce was narrowly re-elected to the Senate, but the four-party coalition forming the regional government lost several votes and the seat in the Chamber. In the 2018 regional election the UV did even worse, obtaining 19.2% of the vote (–14.3pp from 2013) and seven seats: its worst result in 45 years. After the election, the Regional Council elected Nicoletta Spelgatti of Lega Nord Valle d'Aosta as President, at the head of a broad left-right coalition (including one defector from UV's ranks, outgoing regional minister Emily Rini), and the UV was once again excluded from the regional government. However, in December the government fell down and was replaced by a new one led by Antonio Fosson (ex UV, then PNV), at the head of a coalition composed of the UV, the UVP, ALPE, SA and PNV.\n\n\n\n"}

Its long-time leader is Bustianu Cumpostu.\n\nThe party was founded by Anghelu Caria in 1994, in continuity with the Independentist Sardinian Party (PSIn), of which Caria had been founder and leader. After Caria's sudden death, Bustianu Cumpostu was elected new leader by defeating Gavino Sale, who would lead the party's left-wing faction for five years, before leaving in 2001.\n\nIn the 1996 general election SN won 4.3% in single-seat constituencies (11.6% in Tortolì and 9.6% in Iglesias), despite being present only in ten constituencies out of fourteen, and 2.3% for proportional representation, due to competition from the Sardinian Action Party (PSd'Az), which gained 3.8%.\n\nIn the 1999 Sardinian regional election SN had its best result ever, as Cumpostu received 5.8% of the vote for president, while the PSd'Az gained 8.3% with Franco Meloni. However, as Cumpostu did not surpass the 6% threshold and the party list stopped at 1.8%, the party did not get into the Regional Council.\n\nBoth for the 2001 general election and the 2004 regional election SN formed an alliance with the PSd'Az. This led Sale, who refused any collaboration with not parties being considered not fully committed to independence, and his faction to leave the party in 2001 to form Independence Republic of Sardinia (iRS). In the election the Sardist electorate was very fragmented (also because of the presence of the Sardinian Democratic Union, UDS, which ran on a \"nationalist\" platform) and most of SN former voters voted Sale for President (1.9%) and the iRS party list (0.7%), while only a minority voted for SN (0.4%).\n\nSN won 1.1% of the vote in the 2006 general election and 0.7% in 2008. In the 2009 regional election the party formed a \"nationalist\" left-wing alliance with To the Left for Independence, a communist party, and other minor separatist groups, but gained only 0.5%, while Sale (iRS) 3.1%.\n\nIn the 2014 regional election the party unsuccessfully sought to join the coalition led by Michela Murgia (centred on Project Republic of Sardinia), in list with alike separatist parties, and finally decided not to take part to the election.\n\nThe electoral results of SN in Sardinia since 1994 are shown in the table below.\n\n\n"}

While being traditionally part of the Sardinian centre-left, the party has recently sided with the centre-right coalition and, more specifically, with the League.\n\nThe PSd'Az is one of the oldest stateless nationalist parties active in Europe that promotes more autonomy towards the ideal of independence and joined the pro-separatist European Free Alliance in 1984.\n\nChristian Solinas, who has led the party since 2015, was elected senator in the 2018 general election and President of Sardinia in the 2019 regional election, the first Sardist since Mario Melis in 1984–1989.\n\nThe party was founded in April 1921, but soon banned under fascism, and was re-organized after World War II by Emilio Lussu, secretary for Southern Italy of the Action Party during the war, and other veterans from the Sassari brigade and anti-fascists, a social-democratic group of the Italian resistance movement. Lussu left the party in 1948 to found the short-lived Sardinian Socialist Action Party (PSd'AzS), which joined the Italian Socialist Party in 1949, along with many other PSd'Az members. Consequently, the PSd'Az started to cooperate with Christian Democracy and was quite a stable until the 1980s.\n\nThe PSd'Az and the PSd'AzS won 10.5% and 6.6% respectively in the first regional election in 1949.\n\nAfter a decline in term of votes in the 1960s and 1970s, the party re-gained strength in the 1980s (13.8% in 1984 and 12.4% in 1989). Following these results, Sardist Mario Melis was President of Sardinia between 1984 and 1989 at the head of a five-party coalition composed also by the Italian Communist Party, the Italian Socialist Party, the Italian Democratic Socialist Party and the Italian Republican Party. This was the highest point in party history: the PSd'Az was represented in the Italian Parliament from 1983 to 1994, and Melis was a MEP for the Rainbow Group from 1989 to 1994.\n\nThe party was affiliated to The Olive Tree during the 1996 general election. However, the party congress rejected a continuation of the alliance ahead the 2001 general election.\n\nIn the 2004 Sardinian regional election the PSd'Az won 3.9% of the vote and 2 regional councillors.\n\nIn the 2006 general election leader Giacomo Sanna, due to an electoral pact named Pact for the Autonomies, was a candidate of the Lega Nord (LN) for the Senate in Lombardy, but failed to get elected.\n\nThe party ran by itself in the 2008 general election, winning a mere 1.5% in the Region.\n\nIn the 2009 regional election the PSd'Az joined the centre-right coalition, provoking the split of the party's left that formed the Red Moors. Cappellacci won and the PSd'Az won 4.3% of the vote (having its strongholds in the traditionally left-wing Provinces of Nuoro and Carbonia-Iglesias, where it gained 7.5 and 7.1%, respectively) and four regional councillors plus one (Giacomo Sanna) elected in Cappellacci's regional list. The Red Moors won 2.5% and one councillor. In the 2010 provincial elections the party was strongest in Nuoro (12.8%), Sassari (6.9%), Olbia-Tempio (6.7%) and Cagliari (6.4%).\n\nIn 2013 the PSd'Az broke with Cappellacci and the centre-right, but re-joined the coalition in time for the 2014 regional election. In the election Cappellacci was defeated and the PSd'Az won 4.7% of the vote and two regional councillors.\n\nIn the run-up of the 2018 general election the party formed once again an electoral pact with the League, which presented itself as \"Lega\" all around the country. The alliance managed to get 10.8% of the vote and Christian Solinas, leader of the PSd'Az, was elected to the Senate, while Guido De Martini, a local activist of the LN, was elected to the Chamber. This marked the return of the PSd'Az to the Italian Parliament after 22 years. In August 2018 the party was suspended from the European Free Alliance because of its alliance with the League.\n\nIn the 2019 regional election Solinas was elected President of Sardinia with 47.8% of the vote, while the PSd'Az won 9.9%.\n\nThe party has failed to regain the electoral support it enjoyed upon its foundation (e.g. 36% of the popular vote in 1921 general election).\n\nThe party has been mostly marginal in the Sardinan political scene since World War II and this marginalisation has increased with the establishment of a bipolar political system in the 1990s. Eve Hepburn, a political scientist, has suggested the reasons for the party's failure in getting electoral success and influence can be identified in different factors that include its ideological incoherence, its consequent erratic choices of coalition partners, its inability to adapt to multi-level politics (e.g. its inability to devise coherent strategies at the Sardinian, Italian and European level).\n\nThe electoral results of the PSd'Az in regional and Chamber of Deputies elections in Sardinia since 1946 are shown in the chart below. For 1953 only the regional election's result is shown. In the general elections of 1972, 1976, 1979 and 2006 the party did not run lists for the Chamber of Deputies.\n\n"}

A commercial success considered to be influential in Danish film history, it marked Mads Mikkelsen's film debut.\n\nThe film is set in the criminal underground of Copenhagen, Denmark, and tells the story of the drug dealer Frank (Kim Bodnia) who, after losing a large amount of money in a drug deal gone wrong, falls into desperation as he only has a few days to raise the money he owes.\n\nAlthough he did not want to turn \"Pusher\" into a franchise, financial difficulties forced Winding Refn to make two sequels: \"Pusher II\", focusing on Mikkelsen's character after the events of the first film, and \"Pusher 3\", focusing on another secondary character introduced in \"Pusher\"; both sequels were financial and critical successes as well. A Hindi remake of the film was also released in 2010, followed by a British remake in 2012.\n\nThe film begins in Copenhagen with a low-level drug dealer Frank (Kim Bodnia) going to a heroin deal with his sidekick Tonny (Mads Mikkelsen). The pair only manage to sell some of their product, and then waste time about town. Frank then visits his friend Vic (Laura Drasbæk), a prostitute who holds some of Frank's stash for a fee. Vic wants to have a serious relationship with Frank, but Frank prefers to keep it purely casual.\n\nFrank is visited by a former cell mate, a Swede named Hasse (Peter Andersson), and the pair set up a large drug deal. Frank visits his supplier, the Serbian local drug lord Milo (Zlatko Burić), to get the heroin. Already owing Milo some money, Frank cannot cover the cost of the heroin, but Milo allows him to take the drugs provided that he immediately returns with the money.\n\nThe deal goes bad, however, when police arrive. In the process of evading the police, Frank dumps the heroin in a lake. At the station, police officers convince Frank that Tonny has delivered a confession that implicates Frank, but he still does not admit to anything. When Frank is released after 24 hours he returns to Milo to explain how he lost the money and the drugs. Milo does not believe Frank's story and demands that he pay back even more than he already owes. Frank then immediately seeks Tonny out and savagely beats him with a baseball bat.\n\nMilo's henchman Radovan (Slavko Labović) accompanies Frank to help him collect on some of his own debts to use toward his debt with Milo. The pair have a friendly conversation and Radovan shares his secret desire to open a restaurant. Radovan tries to force an addict customer of Frank's to rob a bank to cover his debt, but the addict commits suicide in front of them. As Frank makes other disastrous attempts to earn money, Vic becomes increasingly insistent that they behave as a couple. He takes her to several clubs and makes plans to drive her to the veterinarian to see her sick dog.\n\nFrank finally makes a deal, but his drug mule betrays him and switches the heroin for baking soda. Radovan drops his friendly demeanour and begins threatening Frank with serious injury should he fail to pay up soon. Frank goes on a desperate rampage, stealing some money and drugs from the gym of some drug-dealing bodybuilders, but he is soon picked up by Radovan and tortured. Frank manages to escape and makes plans to flee with Vic to Spain. After successfully making his final deal in Copenhagen, Frank receives a call from Milo, who promises to accept a token payment to put an end to their feud. When Frank bluntly informs Vic that their plans to flee are cancelled, she steals his stash of money and runs off.\n\nThe film ends with Frank grimly catching his breath as his enemies throughout the city prepare to dispose of him.\n\n\nThe movie began as a five-minute \"short\" that Winding Refn had made as an application to a Danish film school. Refn turned down the offer he subsequently received, instead deciding to transform \"Pusher\" into a feature-length independent film utilizing a nominal amount of funding that he had managed to acquire.\n\nRefn partnered with film student Jens Dahl to write the film's screenplay. His goal was to tell the story of a man under pressure, without glamorizing the lifestyle of a drug dealer. Refn organized the plot's events according to the days of the week in his notes and this was subsequently established in the final product. Refn's major inspirations for the film were \"The Battle of Algiers\", \"Cannibal Holocaust\", \"The French Connection\", \"The Killing of a Chinese Bookie\" and \"Mean Streets\".\n\nDuring rehearsal, Winding Refn became dissatisfied with the actor he had cast as Frank, thinking him too placid and boring. Two weeks before shooting was to begin, Winding Refn fired the actor without a replacement in line. Winding Refn approached Kim Bodnia, who was an established actor at the time, and Bodnia accepted. Though the other primary roles were mostly filled with experienced actors, many of the minor roles were filled by Winding Refn's friends or people accustomed to the street life.\n\nBodnia brought a greater degree of intensity and aggressiveness to the part that some actors were not prepared for. Winding Refn claimed that the surprised reactions of some actors are genuine, as they had not rehearsed with Bodnia beforehand and were expecting the previous actor's more sedate performances.\n\nSlavko Labović, who played the Serbian thug Radovan, was a friend of Serbian war criminal Željko Ražnatović. He provided a poster of Ražnatović to use as a prop in Milo's headquarters. The actor playing Milo, Zlatko Burić, is actually a Croat. Winding Refn became concerned when violence flared between Serbs and Croats during filming, but the events did not cause problems on set.\n\nThe film was shot using Danish union rules, which allowed no more than 8 hours of filming per day, and no filming on weekends. The rules, combined with the high cost of filming permits, caused time and budget constraints. The film was shot entirely using hand-held cameras. Winding Refn wanted to capture a realistic, documentary feel to the film. This caused problems with the time constraints of the shooting schedule and Winding Refn's desire to keep the film shadowy. Actors are often backlit or difficult to see due to the low levels of lighting used.\n\nThe film was shot almost completely in chronological order. Winding Refn later admitted that shooting scenes out of order was confusing to him; however, some scenes were reshot or added later. The scene in which Frank shoots at Milo's thugs was originally filmed without special effects, but Winding Refn was dissatisfied with the results and reshot the scene using squibs. The scene with the junkie was shot after shooting had completed to replace a previous scene that Refn discarded because it dealt with an outdated vision of Frank's character.\n\nPunk rocker Peter Peter and composer Povl Kristian composed the score and formed the temporary band \"Prisoner\" to perform the score: Peter playing guitar and Kristian playing the clavier. Kristian also composed the song \"\"Summers got the colour\"\" with text by Lars K. Andersen which was sung by Aud Wilken. Although Povl Kristian did not return to work on the sequels, the \"\"Pusher theme\"\" he wrote with Peter Peter was used in all of the following films.\n\nThe film was considered the first Danish-language gangster film and became a break-through success for Winding Refn and several of the lead actors. Winding Refn claimed that the film inspired cults of highly dedicated fans and influenced Danish fashion to emulate certain costumes worn by the characters. Kim Bodnia launched a very successful career as a leading man in Danish cinema largely due to the success of the movie. Zlatko Burić was given a Bodil Award in 1997 for his performance as Milo.\n\nThe film holds a score of 81% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes with the average score of 6.9/10. The review aggregator site Metacritic has given the movie an average score of 72 out of 100, which means \"Generally favorable reviews\".\n\nTwo sequels followed, focusing on different characters from the same \"underworld\" milieu of Copenhagen.\n\n\"Pusher II\" follows Frank's former partner, Tonny. Tonny struggles with his relationship with his father following his release from prison; Tonny concurrently negotiates the prospect of becoming a father himself and the discovery that his mother had died while he was incarcerated.\n\n\"Pusher 3\" follows drug lord, Milo. Milo is followed through the course of a hectic day, as he struggles with his attempt at sobriety, a series of problematic criminal deals, and his daughter's birthday celebration for which he is the chef.\n\n"}

During the period of the Cromwellian Protectorate he was involved in several Royalist uprisings and was for a time imprisoned.\n\nDespite his previous loyalty, after the Restoration of Charles II, Argyll fell under suspicion due to his hereditary judicial powers in the Highlands and his strong Presbyterian religious sympathies. Condemned to death in 1681 on a highly dubious charge of treason and libel, he escaped from prison and fled into exile, where he began associating with Whig opponents of the Stuart regime. Following the accession of Charles' brother to the throne as James II in 1685, Argyll returned to Scotland in an attempt to depose James, organised in parallel with the Monmouth Rebellion. Argyll's Rising failed, and Argyll was captured and beheaded.\n\nHe was born in 1629 in Dalkeith, Scotland, the eldest son of Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll, and Lady Margaret Douglas, the daughter of William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton.\n\nAt the age of four, an agreement was made, in accordance with a custom common amongst the Scottish nobility of the time, for young Archibald to be fostered with \nColin Campbell of Glenorchy, one of his father's kinsmen. At his parents' insistence he was raised bilingually in English and Gaelic. He enrolled at Glasgow University in 1643, and between 1647 and 1649 his father sent him to travel in France and Italy, mainly to protect him from the political upheavals taking place in Scotland at the time. His father, as one of the most powerful nobles in Scotland, became heavily involved in the politics of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, emerging as the leader of the Presbyterian Covenanter party and as the \"de facto\" head of the Scottish government for much of the period.\n\nWhile still on the Continent, young Archibald heard the news of the execution of King Charles I, and wrote to Queen Henrietta Maria assuring her of his loyalty to the Stuart dynasty. In the letter he also reiterated his father's loyalty, and defended him against accusations that he had approved of Charles's trial and execution, but added that he would serve the King even against his father, if the latter really meant otherwise than he professed.\n\nFrom c.1638 he bore the courtesy title Lord Lorne.\n\nIn 1650, after his return to Scotland, Lorne married Mary, the daughter of James Stuart, 4th Earl of Moray: the same year he was appointed to the governing Committee of Estates, his first major position of responsibility.\n\nWhen Charles II was invited to Scotland in 1650 in a brief alliance with the Covenanters against the English Parliament, Lorne was made captain of His Majesty's Foot Guards, appointed by the Scottish parliament to attend on the king's person. At the time Charles was chafing under the social restraints laid upon him by the Presbyterian clergy, but Lorne obtained favour with him by bringing him people he wished to see. Lorne was present with his regiment at the Battle of Dunbar on 3 September 1650, where his regiment was nearly wiped out and where he was supposed to have conducted himself with personal bravery, and at the Battle of Worcester, where Charles was defeated.\n\nAfter Worcester, in the winter of 1653, Lorne joined William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn, who was in arms in the Highlands with a Royalist force of 700 soldiers and 200 horses. Lorne's father, who had attempted to make peace with Cromwell's regime, warned him against becoming involved, leading to an estrangement. It has since been suspected that the political differences between Lorne and his father were exaggerated by the family in order to ensure they would prosper whichever political side won out, though Lorne's biographer John Willcock felt that his Royalist sympathies were entirely genuine.\n\nGlencairn's irregular forces prepared to invade the Lowlands, but efforts were hampered by constant quarrels between Glencairn's junior commanders. Lorne and Glengarry fell out to the point of drawing swords on each other, and remained at odds. Glencairn, for his part, distrusted Lorne. When Lorne and the Viscount of Kenmure went in joint command of a force to suppress the Kintyre remonstrants (radical Presbyterians who disapproved of the moderates' engagement with Charles) Kenmure thought that Lorne treated them too leniently, and complained to Glencairn. In March Lorne argued with James Graham, 2nd Marquess of Montrose, and came close to being killed.\n\nShortly afterwards Lorne had a final argument with Glencairn over who had authority over Lorne's own tenants. Lorne refused to give precedence to Glencairn, and took his own troops across a nearby river. For the rest of the day Glencairn feared an open battle, but the next night Lorne left his men and departed with only a few officers. The reason for this, according to Baillie, was that a letter from Lorne to the King had been intercepted in which he complained of Glencairn's behaviour, and Glencairn had ordered Glengarry to arrest him. A correspondent of John Thurloe reported a version of events more discreditable to Lorne: that the intercepted letter was written to the general of the English forces, suggesting a plan for attacking Glencairn's men.\n\nIn May 1654, Cromwell published his \"Ordinance of Pardon and Grace to the People of Scotland\", offering a general pardon for acts during the conflict. Lorne was, however, among the numerous exceptions to the pardon. In June he was reported as being reconciled with his father, Argyll, and as helping him to raise men for the English. The report was probably wrong, as in September he managed to capture a vessel loaded with provisions for Argyll's men.\n\nLater in 1654, Lorne is thought to have joined John Middleton's attempted insurrection, and by November he and his men were raiding his father's lands for cattle to feed Middleton's troops. Argyll was eventually compelled to ask for an English garrison to protect him from his son. By the beginning of December, however, Lorne had to retire to a small island with only four or five men, and on 16 December George Monck wrote to Cromwell that Lorne was to meet his father, and would probably come over to the Protector if allowed. Lorne, however, informed Argyll that he could not capitulate without Middleton's formal approval. Lorne was clearly still in communication with Charles, as in December the latter wrote to Lorne from his exile in Cologne, thanking him for his constancy to Middleton in all his distresses, acknowledging his service to the Royalist cause, and promising future rewards. Lorne's Royalist connections remained strong enough that on 18 January 1655 even Lorne's wife was driven out of Argyllshire by Cromwell's troops.\n\nOn 31 March Lorne eventually received instructions from Charles, through Middleton, in which he was urged to lose no time in taking such a course, by capitulation or otherwise, as he should judge \"\"most fit and expedient to save his person, family, and estate.\"\" He is spoken of as having been \"\"principallie engaged in the enlyvening of the war, and one of the chief movers\";\" and his \"\"deportments in relation to the enemy and the last war are beyond all \"\". Another letter to the same effect from Middleton reached him in April, dated from Paris, in which he is similarly praised. Both of these letters were produced at his trial in 1681, in an attempt to reaffirm his history of loyalty to Charles.\n\nLater in 1655, probably in May, conditions for Lorne's surrender were drawn up and finally received Cromwell's approval in August. These were that Lorne and the heads of clans serving him should come in within three weeks; that he should give security for £5,000, his officers and vassals giving proportional security; that Lorne should have liberty to march with his horses and arms (the horses to be sold in three weeks); and that he and his party should enjoy their estates without molestation, and should be freed from all fines or forfeiture. By 8 November the arrangement had been formalised and garrisons were left at Lochaber and Dunstaffnage to ensure Lorne's promises were kept.\n\nDespite his surrender, Lorne was carefully watched by Broghill, who bribed his servants, and who sent accounts of his movements to Cromwell's spymaster John Thurloe. On 20 November Broghill urged Lorne's arrest purely in order that enemies more dangerous at the time might think themselves unobserved. By the following January, however, Lorne had again declared for Charles Stuart, and had taken the island and garrison of Mull. On 8 January, Thurloe was notified that Lorne had a meeting of all his friends (probably to organise his debts, which were substantial). Lorne apparently came to a reconciliation with his father in late March: the latter brokered further agreements with the English Protectorate – of which one was that he or Lorne, whichever the parliament might direct, should go to England whenever desired, provided they had freedom within a compass of twenty miles, and leave to have audience of the council whenever they wished.\n\nDespite his capitulation, Lorne was still regarded with great suspicion. On 13 May 1656 Lord Broghill reported that he was back in correspondence with Charles, repeating the warning later in the year. Broghill suspected that Lorne had been appointed, with Fairfax, to head another Scottish revolt. Probably in consequence of Broghill's information, a new oath was imposed upon the Scottish nobility at the beginning of 1657, whereby they were compelled to swear their renunciation of the Stuarts, and their adherence to the Protectorate. Lorne refused the oath, and was immediately imprisoned in Edinburgh castle. In August 1657 Broghill urged that he and Glencairn, as the two most dangerous persons then in Scotland, should be sent to England, where they would have less opportunity for \"\"trinketing\"\".\n\nWhile Lorne was confined in the castle of Edinburgh a strange accident befell him in March 1658 during a game of \"bullets\", a form of bowling. It was described by Lamont:\n\"\"Being playing at the bullets in the castell, the lieutenant of the castell throwing the bullett, it lighted on a stone, and with such force started back on the Lord Lorne's head that he fell doune, and lay for the space of some houres dead; after that he recovered, and his head was trepanned once or twice.\"\" \n\nLorne recovered slowly and with difficulty from the skull fracture, which in modern times would likely have being diagnosed as a severe concussion, which would explain the nap he took before his execution. Several later historians speculated that some of his apparently erratic behaviour, and occasional fits of temper, in later life, can be explained by it.\n\nThe date of his release is not known, but it was probably in March 1659–60, when Lauderdale and the other prisoners taken at Worcester were set free.\n\nAt the 1660 Restoration of Charles II, Lorne went to London and was received kindly by the King. However, when his father, the Marquess, followed him hoping for a reconciliation with Charles he was arrested: as a result of his role in the Civil War he was executed in May 1661 for treason and his estates forfeit. Despite Lorne's history of loyalty to Charles he had powerful enemies at Court, and fifteen months after his father's death was himself threatened with beheading over a charge of \"leasing making\" (a form of libel). Charles however requested that the sentence be postponed: several months later Lorne was released, and his grandfather's title and estates were restored to him in October 1663. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in October 1663.\n\nAlthough he had finally regained the title of Earl and much of his inheritance, Argyll's affairs were still encumbered by debt. His harsh treatment of his own debtors and apparently unscrupulous use of his hereditary and other offices gave him a poor reputation amongst some contemporaries. He was also involved in ongoing litigation with Montrose, although they were reconciled by February 1667. Montrose visited Argyll at Inveraray in August, and in March 1669 Argyll travelled to Perthshire from Inveraray to attend his funeral, becoming guardian to his son.\n\nOn 29 April 1664 Argyll was placed on the Scottish Privy Council. During 1664 and 1665 he was regarded as one of the chief members of John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale's party, Lauderdale being godfather to one of his children.\n\nDuring the mid 1660s Argyll remained for the most part at Inveraray Castle, exercising his hereditary office of grand justiciar of the highlands, and mediating between highland chiefs. He devoted a great deal of attention to planning the gardens at Inveraray, and was particularly interested in tree raising and planting, seeking advice from John Evelyn on the subject. His plan was to stock the gardens themselves with fruit trees, and to thickly plant ornamental trees around so that the house had the appearance of rising out of a wood: he had a particular fondness for elms. He also devoted time to the production of salt herrings and distilling whisky, hoping to create an export trade to England, and sent samples of his products both to Lauderdale and to Charles II.\n\nAlthough Argyll had some involvement in the religious disputes of the period, acting to disarm the Covenanters in Kintyre, he was regarded as one of the moderates on the Privy Council. There remained opponents amongst the other council members, particularly James Sharp, the Archbishop of St Andrews. This opposition to Argyll surfaced in an attempt to challenge his formal restoration to his hereditary offices in October 1666. It again appeared when the Pentland Rising took place: Sharp would not allow Argyll's forces to participate, fearing that he and his men would join the rebels. After their rout the leaders of the rebels tried to reach the west coast to cross over to Ireland, and on 14 December Argyll received instructions from the Privy Council to capture them if possible.\n\nIn 1667 Argyll received a new charter of all his lands and hereditary and other offices from Charles II. On 3 August he was appointed, with Atholl and Seaforth, to have the oversight of the Highlands, which were then in a disturbed state. He was still on good terms with Lauderdale, and backed him against the other main party on the Privy Council, headed by the 7th Earl of Rothes: in September he wrote to Lauderdale urging him to secure Rothes's resignation of the commissionership.\n\nIn May 1668 Argyll's wife died; his personal letters at the time describe his feelings of desolation at her death. In October 1669 Lauderdale visited Scotland as high commissioner. Argyll was aware that Elizabeth Murray, Lady Dysart, who was shortly to become Lauderdale's second wife, was using her influence against him, and made a point of personally attending Lauderdale at Berwick. At the opening of the Scottish Parliament he carried the sceptre. One of the issues debated by this parliament was to formally ratify the reversal of Argyll's father's forfeiture. This was opposed by the 11th Earl of Erroll and other of Argyll's creditors, but Lauderdale pushed the ratification through by deciding it was not to be voted on and a matter for the King alone to decide.\n\nOn 28 January 1670 Argyll married for the second time, to Lady Anna Mackenzie, dowager Lady Balcarres. This caused a brief souring of his relationship with Lauderdale, who thought that his godson, the young earl, would be adversely affected by the marriage.\n\nArgyll was opposed to further persecution of the western Covenanters, but was ordered by the privy council to suppress the conventicles in his jurisdiction. On 11 July 1674 he was made an extraordinary lord of session. He had in May been made a member of the committee for public affairs appointed to put down conventicles; in 1677 he was still supporting moderate measures.\nHe quietly rebuilt his alliance with Lauderdale, and the daughter of the second Duchess of Lauderdale married his eldest son, Lord Lorne. On 10 October 1678 he received a commission to seize, with the aid of three companies, the Isle of Mull, where a vicious turf war had been going on between Argyll and the McCleans since 1674. It took until 1680 for him to gain possession.\n\nOn 12 April 1679, in consequence of the Popish Plot allegations in England, Argyll received a special commission to secure the Highlands and to disarm all Catholics, particularly the Macleans and Macdonalds. He initially wrote requesting the aid of regular troops to assist his clansmen, and received assistance from the Sheriffs of Dumbarton and Bute, as well as \"\"twelvehundredweight of powder\"\". However, in the interim severe disorder broke out amongst the Covenanters of southern Scotland following their assassination of Argyll's old opponent Archbishop Sharp, culminating in an effective open rebellion and the Battle of Drumclog. Given Argyll's previous moderate treatment of the Covenanters, the Privy Council debated cancelling his commission and he was ordered to report with as many men as he could raise to the camp of the Earl of Linlithgow, the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal forces.\n\nBy this point Argyll was in a difficult position: not only did his Presbyterian sympathies (not to mention those of his late father) make him suspect to the Court party, but his heritable jurisdictions and personal power in the west of Scotland, as the head of Clan Campbell, made him a constant threat to the King's authority. Matters came to a head when in 1680 James, Duke of York replaced Lauderdale as High Commissioner in Scotland. A parliament was held in 1681, Argyll bearing the crown at the opening on 13 August. James told Argyll that the king thought him an over-mighty subject: Argyll, finding himself isolated, assured James of his loyalty, and signed a letter of the council to Charles confirming the divine right of kings. The same month, James paid a solemn visit of ceremony to Argyll at Stirling, and directly asked him if he would convert to Catholicism, promising him great influence in Scotland if he did. Argyll, however, reiterated his dedication to Protestantism, a statement received coldly by James.\n\nThe 1681 parliament passed a Scottish Test Act, the \"\"Act anent Religion and the Test\"\". Like other Test Acts this contained a declaration of adherence to Protestantism, with an added oath of allegiance to the King's authority, to be taken by persons in office. Argyll complained about the substance of the Act, noting its internal contradictions in that it upheld Presbyterianism while committing subjects to follow the monarch's authority in religion, and concerned that the Royal Family themselves – given their Catholic leanings – were not obliged to take it. He then prevaricated over taking the test himself, despite being warned that his earlier complaints had put him in a dangerous position. Eventually he took the oath, but added the caveat \"\"only in as far as it is consistent with itself\"\". Argyll seems to have been under the belief that this qualified version of the oath had been cleared with the Duke of York, but it was enough for an exasperated James, backed by Argyll's enemies, to have him arrested on 9 November and charged with treason, assuming the legislative power, perjury, and the old Scottish capital offence of \"leasing making\" (i.e. libelling the king, his family, or court, with the intention of sowing dissension between the king and his subjects).\n\nArgyll was put in trial, on 12 December 1681, before Queensberry and four other judges. After Lockhart's defence the court adjourned; the question of fact was next day brought before a jury composed mainly of Argyll's enemies; Montrose, his hereditary foe, sat in court as chancellor. Argyll refused to defend himself. The jury acquitted him of perjury in receiving the oath in a false acceptation, and agreed with the judges on the other counts. Application was made to Charles for instructions by the council, and for justice by Argyll. Public opinion in both England and Scotland was outraged by Argyll's treatment, and blame was attached to the Duke of York in particular. George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax told Charles that in England they would not \"\"hang a dog\"\" on the pretext under which Argyll had been sentenced in Scotland. It was given out – at least by pro-Royal sources – that Charles and James were merely hoping to ensure Argyll was humbled and stripped of his judicial powers, rather than actually executed. Charles ordered that sentence of death should be pronounced but execution suspended at his pleasure. However, in the interim, Argyll – unwilling to trust James not to actually execute the sentence – escaped from prison (see below).\n\nOn 22 December the king's letter reached the council; and, questionably, sentence of death as well as of forfeiture was pronounced in Argyll's absence on the 23rd. His estates were confiscated, and his hereditary jurisdictions assigned to Atholl.\n\nAt the end of 1681 Argyll was in Edinburgh Castle, under expectation of imminent death. On 20 December, however, his stepdaughter Sophia Lindsay obtained leave to visit him; she brought with her a countryman as a page, dressed in a wig and with his head bound up as if he had been in a fight. He and Argyll exchanged clothes, and remarkably the ruse proved successful.\n\nLindsay left the castle in floods of tears, accompanied by Argyll. Some of the guards almost discovered the disguise at the last minute, but were successfully distracted, and at the gate Argyll stepped up behind the coach. On reaching the custom-house he slipped quietly off, into one of the narrow wynds adjacent. He first went to the house of George Pringle of Torwoodlee, who had arranged for the escape, and by him was conducted to William Veitch, in Northumberland, who in turn brought him, travelling under the name \"Mr. Hope\", to London.\n\nIn London Argyll was sheltered by Mrs. Smith, wife of a rich sugar-baker. He also found refuge with Major Abraham Holmes, who had arrested him in 1656–7. After a delay of some time Mrs. Smith took him to her country house at Brentford. No real steps were taken to recapture him, and his subsequent movements are opaque. In 1682 he was supposed to be in Switzerland, but Arthur Forbes, 1st Earl of Granard received a message from him in London, and held a meeting with him. Charles II is also supposed to have been informed of his whereabouts, but refused to have him arrested, ostensibly for reasons of sympathy but perhaps also as arresting such a prominent Protestant would have been hugely unpopular.\n\nDuring this period Argyll seems to have begun associating with enemies of the Stuart regime, despite his earlier loyalism. He became a central figure in the clandestine Whig circles centred on the Earl of Shaftesbury. In the autumn of 1682 the government received information that he was involved in treasonable activities: efforts to locate him were renewed, and he fled to Holland, where many Whig exiles were gathering.\n\nIn June 1683, Baillie of Jerviswood and a number of others were arrested after the discovery of the Rye House plot to assassinate Charles and his brother. Among their papers, letters from Argyll in cipher were found. The letters were sent to Scotland, and the countess was summoned in December 1683 to decipher them. She admitted that they were in Argyll's writing, but claimed she had burnt the only key she had. The cipher was, however, at length read by William Spence, Argyll's private secretary, and independently by two cryptographers, George Campbell and Gray of Crigie. Argyll, it appeared, had remonstrated with other Whig conspirators about their rejection of his proposal that he should be provided with £30,000 and 1,000 English horse. They offered £10,000 with 600 or 700 horse, the money to be paid by the beginning of July, and Argyll was then to go at once to Scotland and begin a revolt. He gave an account of the standing forces, militia, and heritors of Scotland, who would be obliged to appear for the king, to the number of 50,000. Half of them, he said, would not fight. He also said that his party needed only money and arms, and asked Holmes to communicate fully with his messenger from Holland.\n\nHolmes was himself arrested and examined on 28 June 1683, and from his replies it appeared that Argyll was then in London. In October Preston wrote from Paris, informing Halifax that Argyll had his agents in France, and added his belief that he had, after consultation with his friends in Holland, gone back to Scotland. On 28 and 29 June 1684 Spence was examined before the English privy council, but he said nothing against Argyll. In July he was sent to Scotland, and was tortured; but no more was learnt from him and he was eventually released. In September 1684 Argyll's charter chest and family papers were found concealed in a tenant's house in Argyllshire. Instructors at Benmore Outdoor Centre maintain that Scots law meant that the forfeit estates could not be transferred without the documents, which were supposedly concealed in the Paper Caves in the hillside adjacent to Loch Eck.\n\nWhile in Holland, Argyll had become associated with the Duke of Monmouth. On the news of Charles II's death and the accession of James VII as king, he moved from Friesland to Rotterdam, and was present at a meeting of Scots in Amsterdam on 17 April 1685, at which an immediate invasion of Scotland was decided on. Argyll made great efforts to convince Monmouth of the viability of a joint plan of invasion, claiming he could count on a large number of men from among his tenantry in Scotland, although he was among those who insisted that Monmouth should promise never to declare himself king. He funded the invasion preparations with £9,000 given by his supporter Mrs. Ann Smith, and £1,000 from John Locke. Argyll sailed from the Vlie on 1 or 2 May 1685 with about 300 men in three small ships, accompanied by Sir Patrick Hume, Sir John Cochrane, Spence, and several other Scots exiles. Two English conspirators, John Ayloffe and Richard Rumbold, also went with Argyll. Monmouth had promised that he would start his own attempt, the Monmouth Rebellion, within a few days, though in the event he did not set sail for several weeks.\n\nThe expedition was dogged by bad luck and divisions amongst its leadership. They anchored off Orkney on 6 May: Spence went ashore to obtain a pilot, but was arrested, and the authorities were alerted to the invasion. Argyll sailed by The Minch towards the coast of his own country, but was compelled by contrary winds to go to the Sound of Mull. At Tobermory he was delayed three days, and then with three hundred men whom he picked up there he went across to Kintyre, a Covenanter stronghold. At Campbeltown Argyll issued a declaration: James had caused the death of Charles, Monmouth was the rightful heir, and that by him he had been restored to title and estates. He had previously sent his son Charles to raise his former tenants, who since his trial had officially held their tenancies from the King; but very few answered his summons.\n\nThe rebels marched to Tarbet, where Argyll sent out a second declaration: he denied the statements of his enemies that he had come for private advantage, and promised to pay both his father's debts and his own. While he seems to have expected widespread support from the Covenanters and their sympathisers, many of the more militant Presbyterians had been angered by Argyll's involvement in the trial and execution of one of their leaders, Donald Cargill, and the majority of men who eventually joined the rebellion were Campbell clansmen. The government had also taken the precaution of stationing large numbers of soldiers and militia in those areas of the country thought to be most likely to be sympathetic to Argyll.\n\nAt Tarbet Argyll was joined by Sir Duncan Campbell with a large body of men. An invasion of Lowland Scotland was settled on by a council of war, but Argyll demurred. At Bute he was detained for three days, and his forces then marched to Corval in Argyllshire. After a pointless raid on Greenock he moved off to Inveraray, but after the appearance of two English frigates compelled him to shelter under the castle of Eilean Gheirrig. He took Ardkinglass castle, but gave up on taking Inverary, and returned to Eilean Gheirrig. He then proposed to attack the frigates, but was frustrated by a mutiny among his men. The garrison of Eilan Gheirrig deserted, the king's ships took those of Argyll, with their cannon and ammunition as well as the castle, and Argyll's standard on which was written \"For God and Religion, against Poperie, Tyrrannie, Arbitrary Government, and Erastianism\".\n\nIn a poor situation Argyll took up the lowland enterprise. Near Dumbarton he encamped in an advantageous position in the face of the royal troops; but his proposal to fight was overruled, and the rebels retreated without any engagement towards Glasgow. It crossed to the south side of the River Clyde at Renfrew by Kirkpatrick ford, dwindling from two thousand to five hundred men; and after one or two skirmishes with the troops commanded by Rosse and William Cleland, Argyll found himself alone with his son John and three personal friends. To avoid pursuit they separated, only Major Fullarton remaining with Argyll.\n\nHaving been refused shelter at the house of an old servant, the two crossed the Clyde to Inchinnan. On 18 June they were found by a group of militiamen. Argyll was said to have drawn his pistols to fire, but the powder had become damp in the river, and Argyll was struck over the head by one of his captors, a weaver. Heavily disguised in a countryman's bonnet and the full beard he had grown in exile, it was reported (probably apocryphally) that Argyll was only recognised when he cried \"\"Alas, unfortunate Argyll!\"\" as he fell, upon which the militiamen wept when they realised who they had captured, though they were too afraid not to hand him over to the authorities.\n\nHe was led first to Renfrew and then to Glasgow. On 20 June he arrived at Edinburgh, taken to the castle and put in irons. He was questioned before the council as to his associates, and threatened with torture. While in prison he was visited by his sister, Lady Lothian, and by his wife, who, with Sophia Lindsay, had been placed in confinement on the first news of his landing.\n\nOn 30 June 1685 Argyll was executed, like his father, on the maiden in Edinburgh. He had spent much of his time in Holland preparing for a death he anticipated, and he faced his execution with fortitude and good humour. A story was repeated afterwards that an official who came to his room to bring him to execution found him sleeping peacefully, and was filled with remorse in the face of Argyll's calmness (though detractors claimed that following his 1658 head injury he had always had a similar sleep every day). To Sophia Lindsay he wrote:\"\"what shall I say in this great day of the Lord, wherein, in the midst of a cloud, I find a fair sunshine. I can wish no more for you, but that the Lord may comfort you, and shine upon you as he doth upon me, and give you that same sense of His love in staying in the world, as I have in going out of it.\"\" On the scaffold he gave a speech reiterating his opposition to \"Popery\", and finally joked that the guillotine, as his \"\"inlet to glory\"\" was \"\"the sweetest maiden he had ever kissed\"\".\n\nHe was first interred in Greyfriars Kirkyard and later reburied at Kilmun Parish Church.\n\nThere are few personal descriptions of Argyll, and the polarized political landscape of the time lends itself to widely varying descriptions. John Lauder, Lord Fountainhall said that he was \"\"witty in knacks\"\" (i.e. clever in small inventions) and was \"\"so conceitly\"\" he had about twenty pockets in his coat and breeches. Lauderdale said that he had habits of winking his eye as he spoke and of holding his thumb in the palm of his hand, both of which were supposed to be \"\"ill signs\"\" prophetic of his violent fate. Argyll himself made reference to his own slight build and stature. Napier, the highly partisan pro-Jacobite historian, repeated several derogatory stories of Argyll's character and quoted John Leslie, 1st Duke of Rothes who said of Argyll that \"\"\"neither does either his person, or way of converse, recommend him\"\". However, Argyll had, like his father, made many enemies in his lifetime, and other sources give a far more favourable impression of him. Airy noted that Argyll's correspondence on the death of his first wife was \"\"touching\"\", and Andrew Lang wrote that his unpublished private letters showed him to be a \"\"man of singularly affectionate character and tender heart\"\", adding that his conduct at his execution demonstrated great personal bravery.\n\nOn 13 May 1650, at the Canongate Kirk, he married Lady Mary Stewart, daughter of the 4th Earl of Moray, with whom he had seven children:\n\n\nHe married again, in 1670, the widow Lady Anne Mackenzie, Countess of Balcarres. She survived her husband, being spared execution, and died of old age in 1707.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1868531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868531", "title": "Molecularity", "text": "Molecularity\n\nMolecularity in chemistry is the number of molecules that come together to react in an elementary (single-step) reaction and is equal to the sum of stoichiometric coefficients of reactants in this elementary reaction.\nDepending on how many molecules come together, a reaction can be unimolecular, bimolecular or trimolecular.\n\nThe kinetic order of any elementary reaction or reaction step is equal to its molecularity, and the rate equation of an elementary reaction can therefore be determined by inspection, from the molecularity.\n\nThe kinetic order of a complex (multistep) reaction, however, cannot be equated to molecularity since molecularity only describes elementary reactions or steps.\n\nIn a unimolecular reaction, a single molecule rearranges atoms forming different molecules. This is illustrated by the equation\n\nwhere P means Product(s). The reaction or reaction step is an isomerization if there is only one product molecule, or a dissociation if there is more than one product molecule.\n\nIn either case the rate of the reaction or step is described by the first order rate law\n\nwhere [A] is the concentration of species A, t is time, and k is the reaction rate constant.\n\nAs can be deduced from the rate law equation, the number of A molecules that decay is proportional to the number of A molecules available. An example of a unimolecular reaction, is the isomerization of cyclopropane to propene:\n\nUnimolecular reactions can be explained by the Lindemann-Hinshelwood mechanism.\n\nIn a bimolecular reaction, two molecules collide and exchange energy, atoms or groups of atoms.\n\nThis can be described by the equation\n\nwhich corresponds to the second order rate law: formula_2.\n\nHere, the rate of the reaction is proportional to the rate at which the reactants come together. An example of a bimolecular \nreaction is the SN2-type nucleophilic substitution of methyl bromide by hydroxide ion:\n\nA termolecular (or trimolecular) reaction in solutions or gas mixtures involves three reactant molecules simultaneously colliding. However the term \"trimolecular\" is also used to refer to three body association reactions of the type\n\nWhere the M over the arrow denotes that to conserve energy and momentum a second reaction with a third body is required. After the initial bimolecular collision of A and B an energetically excited reaction intermediate is formed, then, it collides with a M body, in a second bimolecular reaction, transferring the excess energy to it.\n\nThe reaction can be explained as two consecutive reactions:\n\nThese reactions frequently have a pressure and temperature dependence region of transition between second and third order kinetics.\n\nCatalytic reactions are often three-component, but in practice a complex of the starting materials is first formed and the rate-determining step is the reaction of this complex into products, not an adventitious collision between the two species and the catalyst. For example, in hydrogenation with a metal catalyst, molecular dihydrogen first dissociates onto the metal surface into hydrogen atoms bound to the surface, and it is these monatomic hydrogens that react with the starting material, also previously adsorbed onto the surface.\n\nReactions of higher molecularity are not observed due to very small probability of simultaneous interaction between 4 or more molecules\n\nIt is important to distinguish molecularity from order of reaction. The order of reaction is an empirical quantity determined by experiment from the rate law of the reaction. It is the sum of the exponents in the rate law equation. Molecularity, on the other hand, is deduced from the mechanism of an elementary reaction, and is used only in context of an elementary reaction. It is the number of molecules taking part in this reaction.\n\nThis difference can be illustrated on the reaction between nitric oxide and hydrogen: \n\nThe observed rate law is formula_5, so that the reaction is \"third order\". Since the order does \"not\" equal the sum of reactant stoechiometric coefficients, the reaction must involve more than one step. The proposed two-step mechanism has a rate-limiting first step whose molecularity corresponds to the overall order of 3:\n\nOn the other hand, the molecularity of this reaction is undefined, because it involves a mechanism of more than one step. However, we can consider the molecularity of the individual elementary reactions that make up this mechanism: the first step is termolecular because it involves three reactant molecules, while the second step is bimolecular because it involves two reactant molecules.\n\n"}
{"id": "1868539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868539", "title": "Boston University Bridge", "text": "Boston University Bridge\n\nThe Boston University Bridge, originally the Cottage Farm Bridge and commonly referred to as the BU Bridge, is a steel truss through arch bridge with a suspended deck carrying Route 2 over the Charles River, connecting the Boston University campus to Cambridge, Massachusetts. According to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials route log, the bridge also carries U.S. Route 3 across the river to its southern terminus at U.S. Route 20 (also known as Commonwealth Avenue). However, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation does not consider the bridge to be a part of US 3; it continues the route along Memorial Drive in Cambridge until it meets Route 2A at the end of the Harvard Bridge.\n\nIn 1949 it was renamed for Boston University, which lies at the southern end of the bridge, after a group of BU students went to the State House to propose a name change. State Senator John E. Powers sponsored the legislation and in May 1949 it passed with a unanimous vote. Contrary to popular belief, the bridge, with the Grand Junction Railroad Bridge directly underneath it, is not the only place in the world where a boat can sail under a train driving under a car driving under an airplane. Other such places include the Steel Bridge, in Portland, Oregon, and the 25 de Abril Bridge, in Lisbon, although on both those bridges are on the same span. In this case the rail and road traffic are on separate bridges.\n\nThe Boston University Bridge was designed by Andrew Canzanelli and built by The Phoenix Bridge Company in 1927, replacing an 1850s drawbridge known as the Brookline Bridge. Canzanelli also designed the Weeks footbridge and the first shell constructed on the Esplanade.\n\nThe bridge crosses diagonally over an older, now single-tracked railroad-only bridge carrying the Grand Junction Line. This bridge, formerly owned by CSX Transportation, was purchased by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the MBTA in 2010. The long-postponed Urban Ring mass transit project is expected to include a bridge at or near this location, to carry the planned route across the Charles River.\n\nDuring the period of planning for the Inner Belt, the BU Bridge represented the planned crossing point of the highway from Boston to Cambridge. Several plans were discussed for the area; had the expressway been built over the river, the bridge would have been demolished and replaced with a high-level highway overpass, while if the road had been built as a tunnel, the bridge would have been left standing as a crossing for surface route traffic.\n\nIn 2008, the bridge deck, including the sidewalks and vehicular surface, was in severe disrepair; the water below was visible through holes in the deck, and the iron stairs leading from Storrow Drive were rusted through. These deficiencies triggered the bridge to be categorized as \"structurally deficient\" under the federal NBIS standards. Nevertheless, the main structural elements of the bridge have been determined to be sound.\n\nThe approximately $20 million rehabilitation project has been among the first undertaken in the Commonwealth's Accelerated Bridge Program by the bridge owner, the Department of Conservation and Recreation.\n\nIn June 2008, one traffic lane and the west-side sidewalk was closed so that this work could begin. The project was done in 3 phases to keep traffic open throughout construction. The project was projected to wrap up in late November 2011.\n\nOn December 21, 2011, the project was substantially complete and the bridge was opened in its final configuration, with one lane entering the bridge in each direction, transitioning on the bridge to two lanes exiting. Two 5-foot bike lines are provided alongside the sidewalks.\n\n\n"}

Franklin Bell\n\nJames Franklin Bell (January 9, 1856 – January 8, 1919) was an officer in the United States Army who served as Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1906 to 1910.\n\nBell was a major general in the Regular United States Army, commanding the Department of the East, with headquarters at Governors Island, New York at the time of his death in 1919. He entered West Point in 1874, and graduated 38th in a class of 43 in 1878, with a commission as second lieutenant of the 9th Cavalry Regiment, a black unit.\n\nBell was born to John Wilson and Sarah Margaret Venable (Allen) Bell in Shelbyville, Kentucky. His mother died when he was young. Thereafter the two most important women in his life were the black woman who looked after him as a child and the white woman who became his step-mother.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Shelby County was split between Union and Confederate factions. The extended Bell family was strongly in favor of the secession. After the firing on Fort Sumter, John Wilson Bell and his brothers drew lots to determine who would remain at home to look after their parents and who would join the Southern armies. John lost and remained at home. Young James Franklin, \"Frank\" as he was known to family and friends, thus grew up in a milieu in which slavery was not only accepted and practiced but strongly defended.\n\nBell attended the public schools in Shelbyville. Until he was sixteen, he also worked on his father's farm six days a week with breaks only for school and the Sabbath. In the process, he developed a strong physical constitution that stood him in good stead for the remainder of his life. In 1872 he began working as a clerk in a general store owned by one of his uncles. His chief recreations were baseball and horse racing. One neighbor later remembered Frank and a friend tearing down country lanes on horseback \"as if the Devil\" was after them.\n\nWorking in a general store did not appeal to such a high spirited young person, and in 1874 he secured appointment to West Point. During his four years at the Military Academy, he excelled in art, horsemanship, demerits, and making friends. He graduated 38th in a class of 43. The War Department assigned him to the 9th Cavalry, one of the black units formed after the Civil War. Then in Kentucky on home leave, Bell attempted to resign his commission. This, in fact, was illegal, but someone at the War Department understood the attitudes that were behind this action and assigned him to the all-white 7th Cavalry. He joined the unit at Fort Abraham Lincoln, Dakota Territory, on October 1, 1878.\n\nBell became an instructor of military science and tactics and taught mathematics at Southern Illinois University, a position held from 1886 until 1889. While in Illinois, he read law and passed the Illinois bar. In 1889, he returned to the 7th Cavalry. Although the regiment participated in the Wounded Knee Massacre in South Dakota, Bell was on personal leave and did not participate. He was promoted to first lieutenant on December 29, 1890, and participated in the Pine Ridge, South Dakota campaign in 1891. Later that year, the 7th Cavalry was posted to Fort Riley, Kansas, and Bell joined the staff of the Cavalry and Light Artillery School. He soon became adjutant, then secretary of the school. In November 1894, Bell became aide-de-camp to General James W. Forsyth and posted to the Department of California. He was transferred to Fort Apache, Arizona Territory, in July 1897 and then to Vancouver Barracks, Washington, in February 1898.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, Bell was acting as adjutant to General Forsyth, then commanding the Department of the West, with headquarters at San Francisco. He was immediately commissioned Colonel of Volunteers, and authorized to organize a regiment. This regiment was ordered to the Philippines and, under his command, saw service in the Philippine–American War.\n\nAfter a few months in the Philippines, Bell was promoted from his commission of captain in the Regular Army to brigadier general in the Regular Army, outranking many officers previously his senior.\n\nBell was awarded a Medal of Honor for his actions of September 9, 1899 near Porac on Luzon Island in the Philippines. According to the official citation, \"while in advance of his regiment [Bell] charged 7 insurgents with his pistol and compelled the surrender of the captain and 2 privates under a close fire from the remaining insurgents concealed in a bamboo thicket.\"\n\nIn July 1903, Bell was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he headed the Command and General Staff School until April 14, 1906; Bell was promoted major general, and was appointed Chief of the Army General Staff. He served for four years, under Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. Bell was the first chief officer of the United States Army in 45 years who had not served in the American Civil War.\nWhen the United States military forces of the Western Pacific concentrated in the Philippines, he returned to Manila in 1911, as military commander, until war with Mexico seemed imminent. He was then ordered home to take command of the 4th Division. The 4th Division remained in Texas City as reserve and, although at several times he seemed about to cross the Rio Grande, he was never a part of the Mexican expeditionary force.\n\nAfter the Mexican situation quieted, Bell was relieved of the 4th Division, and placed in command of the Department of the West. He remained in command at San Francisco, where he had once been acting adjutant, until the United States entered World War I.\n\nIn the early spring of 1917, Bell was transferred to the Department of the East at Fort Jay, Governors Island, in New York City, and as commander of that department, assuming responsibility for Officers' Training Camps created by his predecessor, Leonard Wood, at Plattsburgh, Madison Barracks, and Fort Niagara. Bell's aide, Captain George C. Marshall, was most directly involved in the logistical support for these camps, battling a lethargic army supply system to properly equip the volunteer citizen soldiers. These camps, in August 1917, graduated the large quota of new officers needed for the new National Army and, to a large extent, to officer the new divisions of the east and northeast.\n\nIn the same month, Bell was offered and promptly accepted the command of the National Army Division to be organized at Camp Upton. Bell commanded the Division when the first newly appointed officers climbed the hill and reported to their first assignment, through that formative stage when barracks were thrown together at a miraculous speed, and being filled at the same rate. Then, in December, he sailed for France to make a tour of the front, and observe, first hand, actual fighting conditions. He did not return until the latter part of March 1918.\n\nOn his return, Bell failed the physical examination required for active service overseas. When the doctors decreed that he would not take his division to France, Bell was again given command of the Department of the East, and returned to his old headquarters, Governors Island, which command he held until his death in January 1919.\n\n\nRank and organization: Colonel, 36th Infantry, U.S. Volunteers.

From parallax measurements taken during the Hipparcos mission it is about from the Sun. It has a combined apparent visual magnitude of 3.89, bright enough to be seen with the naked eye in dark skies.\n\nThe system consists of a binary pair designated Eta Virginis A together with a third companion, Eta Virginis B. A's two components are themselves designated Eta Virginis Aa (officially named Zaniah , the traditional name of the system) and Ab.\n\n\"η Virginis\" (Latinised to \"Eta Virginis\") is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the two constituents as \"Eta Virginis A\" and those of \"A's\"components - \"Eta Virginis Aa\" and \"Ab\" - derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).\n\nIt bore the traditional name \"Zaniah\" , derived from the Arabic زاوية \"zāwiyah\" \"corner\", the same source as \"Zavijava\" (Beta Virginis). In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name \"Zaniah\" for the component Eta Virginis Aa on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.\n\nIn the catalogue of stars in the \"Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket\", this star was designated \"Thanih al Aoua\", which was translated into Latin as \"Secunda Latratoris\", meaning \"the second barker\". This star, along with Beta Virginis (Zavijava), Gamma Virginis (Porrima), Delta Virginis (Minelauva) and Epsilon Virginis (Vindemiatrix), were \"Al ʽAwwāʼ\", \"the Barker\".\n\nIn Chinese, (), meaning \"Left Wall of Supreme Palace Enclosure\", refers to an asterism consisting of Eta Virginis, Gamma Virginis, Delta Virginis, Epsilon Virginis and Alpha Comae Berenices. Consequently, the Chinese name for Eta Virginis itself is (, .), representing (), meaning \"The Left Law Administrator\". 左執法 (Zuǒzhífǎ), spelled \"Tso Chih Fa\" by R.H. Allen, means \"the Left-hand Maintainer of Law\" \n\nEta Virginis looks single, but lunar occultations have shown it to be a very close triple star system consisting of two stars 0.6 AU apart, assuming a distance of 91 parsecs, with a third slightly more distant star. The inner pair is a spectroscopic binary that completes an orbit in 72 days. The inclination of this orbit was determined through interferometer observations to be 45.5°, allowing the masses of the two stars to be estimated. The primary star, Eta Virginis Aa, has a mass about 2.5 times the Sun's mass, while the secondary, Eta Virginis Ab, has 1.9 solar masses. The faint tertiary star, Eta Virginis B, orbits the inner group in a wider orbit over a period of 13.1 years.\n\nEta Virginis is 1.97 degrees north of the ecliptic, so it can be occulted by the Moon and (rarely) by planets. On October 12, 272 BC the ancient Greek astronomer Timocharis observed a conjunction of the star with Venus. The last occultation by a planet took place on September 27, 1843, also by Venus, which will occult it again on November 19, 2445.\n\nTwo degrees north-following of Eta Virginis is SS Virginis, a typical Cool Carbon Star and one of the most red colored stars in the equatorial sky.\n\n"}

Scott\n\nHugh Lenox Scott (September 22, 1853 – April 30, 1934) was a United States Army officer. A West Point graduate, he served as superintendent of West Point from 1906 to 1910 and as Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1914 to 1917, which included the first few months of American involvement in World War I.\n\nBorn on September 22, 1853 in Danville, Kentucky, he grew up there and in Princeton, New Jersey, where he was educated at The Lawrenceville School. He attended Princeton University, before being accepted into the United States Military Academy at West Point.\n\nScott graduated from West Point in 1876 (his Cullum number was 2628), and was commissioned in the Cavalry. For some twenty years thereafter he served on the Western frontier, chiefly with the 7th United States Cavalry. He was assigned to the quarters only recently vacated by the widow of George Armstrong Custer. In fact, Scott was sent out to the Little Big Horn battle site to mark gravesites for Custer's men killed in the battle. He also had the opportunity to interview many of the Native Americans who fought on both sides of the battle on June 25, 1876. He saw action in campaigns against the Sioux, Nez Perce, Cheyenne and other tribes of the Great Plains and became an expert in their languages and ways of life. He was promoted to first lieutenant in June 1878.\n\nAbout 1889, while stationed with the 7th Cavalry at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, Scott made the acquaintance of an Indian scout name I-See-O (Plenty Fires) of the Kiowa tribe. I-See-O enlisted in the Indian Scouts in 1889 and taught Scott Native American sign language and techniques of frontier warfare. Scott was placed in command of Troop L of the 7th Cavalry on March 29, 1891 and of a detachment of Indian Scouts on September 18, 1891.\n\nWhen Scott was given command of Troop L of the regiment in 1891, he had I-See-O serve as his first sergeant. (Infantry regiments designated Company I for their Native American scouts, and cavalry regiments did the same with Troop L.) During the ghost dance phenomenon of the early 1890s, I-See-O helped in persuading the Apache and Kiowa tribes not to go to war. This action, while serving the interest of white settlers and speculators, undoubtedly also saved the lives of many Native Americans. Scott's gratitude to I-See-O was such that, when he was Chief of Staff of the Army, he allowed for Sergeant I-See-O to remain on active duty for life.\n\nIn 1890–91, he was given the responsibility for suppressing the \"Ghost Dance\" religious movement that swept the Indian Reservations and received official commendation for that work. In 1892, he organized Troop L of the 7th Cavalry, composed of Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Indians, and commanded it until it was mustered out, the last Indian unit in the United States Army, in 1897. In 1894–97, he had charge of Geronimo's band of Chiricahua Apache Indian prisoners at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. He was promoted to captain in January 1895, having served as a first lieutenant for 16 and a half years.\n\nIn November 1897, he was attached to the Bureau of American Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, where he began preparing a work on Indian sign languages. In May 1898, after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, he was appointed major of Volunteers and Assistant Adjutant General of the 2nd and 3rd Divisions, I Corps. He saw no action in that war, but in March 1899 went to Cuba as Adjutant General of the Department of Havana, with the rank of lieutenant colonel of Volunteers.\n\nIn May 1900, he became adjutant general of the Department of Cuba and remained in that post until May 1902. During that time, he served for a time as acting governor and took an active part in the transfer of government into Cuban hands. He was promoted to major in the Regular Army in February 1903 and served as Military Governor of the Sulu Archipelago, Philippines, in 1903–06 and also commanded troops there, taking part in various skirmishes, reorganized the civil government and institutions. During this assignment he received two Silver Star citations for gallantry in action.\nIn August 1906, he was named Superintendent of the United States Military Academy, a post he held for four years with the temporary rank of colonel. He was promoted to permanent lieutenant colonel in March 1911 and in colonel in August of the same year. He then commanded the 3rd United States Cavalry Regiment in Texas, engaged in settling various Indian troubles.\n\nIn March 1913, Scott was promoted to brigadier general in command of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, still posted to the Southwest. He won special commendation for his skillful handling of Navajo disturbances at Beautiful Mountain, Arizona, in November 1913. He was named Assistant Chief of Staff in April 1914 and Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1914 to 1917, including the first few months of American involvement in World War I. He was promoted to major general in April 1915. He continued to act in a diplomatic role with Indians and Mexican border officials in the Southwest, settling problems with the Paiutes of Utah in March 1915 and recovering property \"confiscated\" by Pancho Villa in August.\n\nFrom February to March 1916, Scott served as ad-interim Secretary of War but his energies were directed more toward preparation for possible U.S. entry into World War I. He was very influential in winning early acceptance among civil officials of the notion of conscription. He retired at the statutory age of 64 on 22 September 1917. He was succeeded as Chief of Staff by Tasker H. Bliss. Despite being retired, Scott was immediately recalled to active duty. He served stateside and became commander of the 78th Division at Camp Dix, New Jersey, in December and of Camp Dix again in March 1918.\n\nScott retired finally in May 1919 and served on the Board of Indian Commissioners from 1919 to 1929 and was Chairman of the New Jersey State Highway Commission from 1923 to 1933. In 1928, he published an autobiography, \"Some Memories of a Soldier\".\n\nScott died in Washington, D.C. on April 30, 1934 and was buried among many other family members in Section 2 of Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nThere is a large bas relief memorial plaque in his honor in the Washington National Cathedral.

He graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno in 1961 with a degree in mechanical engineering and was a part of the design team responsible for the Apollo spacecraft heat shield.\n\nRon Toomer was hired by Arrow Development founders Karl Bacon and Ed Morgan in 1965 to help design a mine train ride called Run-A-Way Mine Train at Six Flags Over Texas. It opened in 1966 utilizing the tubular steel rail technology that had been developed by Arrow for Disneyland's Matterhorn Bobsleds. The concept caught on quickly and Toomer designed 15 more mine train coasters for Arrow. All but one are still operating today. Following almost four years of development, Toomer introduced the modern looping roller coaster in 1975 with the opening of \"Corkscrew\", the first in the world with two inversions, at Knott's Berry Farm. Knott's is credited with having the first, but three more identical coasters opened later that same year. The following year he introduced the familiar Arrow teardrop-shaped vertical loop on a custom corkscrew coaster at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. At Cedar Point in 1989, Toomer unveiled the first roller coaster to top known as Magnum XL-200.\n\nIn 1981, Arrow Development was purchased by Huss Maschinenfabrik, which merged with Arrow Development to form Arrow-Huss. Toomer was made vice president and manager of engineering. In 1986, 13 of the company's American officers negotiated a buyout, and formed Arrow Dynamics to which Toomer was named president. In 1993 he was promoted to chairman of the board then became a consulting director in 1995. Toomer retired from Arrow Dynamics in 1998.\n\nAlthough Toomer primarily designed coasters for Arrow, he also assisted with some of the other Arrow products, which included providing structural engineering for the company's Log Flumes.\n\nA common misconception is that Ron Toomer never rode any of his rides. Although he did suffer from motion sickness, he would ride a coaster once, maybe twice. He was quoted as saying \"I've ridden enough to know what they are like.\"\n\nRon Toomer's designs were highly innovative with many of his coasters breaking records. Notable designs include:\n\n\nIn 2000 Ron Toomer was inducted into the IAAPA Hall of Fame as a Living Legend.\n\nFour of Toomer's coasters have been designated Roller Coaster Landmarks by American Coaster Enthusiasts: Corkscrew, Loch Ness Monster, Magnum XL-200 and Run-A-Way Mine Train.\n\n"}

The Treaty was ratified and signed on 17 December 1903.\n\nIn 1900, Bliss was elected as a veteran companion of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of Foreign Wars.\n\nBliss was commissioned as a brigadier general in the Regular Army by an Act of Congress under direction of the U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. On 15 August 1903, Bliss was appointed a member of the General Staff, Chief, 3rd Division and President of the Army War College. In September 1904, he participated in the Manassas maneuvers in Virginia.\n\nOn 7 June 1905, Bliss was ordered the Philippine Islands to command the Department of Luzon. On 9 January 1906, he was assigned as commander of the Department of Mindanao and appointed governor of the Moro Province. While still governor of the Moro Province, Bliss was ordered to command the Philippine Division on 14 December 1908. He relinquished all Philippine Islands commands on 6 April 1909, and returned to the U.S. after touring China and Manchuria.\n\nBliss was assigned to the general staff and president of the U.S. Army War College, 19 June 1909. On 12 August 1910, he was assigned to command the Department of California, in San Francisco, California. On 13 August 1911, he was assigned as Commander, Department of the East, Fort Totten, New York, and subsequently assigned to Commander, Department of the South, Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas on 26 February 1913.\n\nOn 13 February 1915, Bliss was detailed to the general staff as Assistant Chief of Staff, Army until his promotion to Chief of Staff on 22 September 1917.

He was relieved as U.S. Army Chief of Staff on 19 May 1918, and returned to his permanent rank of major general (retired) 20 May 1918. After the signing of the armistice ending World War I, on 11 November 1918, Bliss held two titles, the American Permanent Military Representative, Supreme War Council, and also, Plenipotentiary at the Paris Peace Conference. This assignment was concluded on 10 December 1919.\n\nOn 1 May 1920, Bliss was assigned as governor of the U.S. Soldiers Home, Washington, DC. He retired from that position on 1 May 1927. He was reinstated as a full general and retired on 21 June 1930.\n\nHe died on 9 November 1930. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Washington, DC.\n\nEdward Goring Bliss was the son of Tasker and Eleanor E. Bliss. Born on 2 June 1892, he graduated from the USMA in 1916 and was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the Engineer Corps. He saw service in Siberia in 1918–1919 and through World War II. He retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n\nHis daughter Eleanora, born in 1885, attended Bryn Mawr College where she became the first women to gain a doctorate in geology. She joined the United States Geological Survey where she met and married fellow geologist, Adolph Knopf.\n\nThe U.S. Navy transports and were named after him.\n\nA portrait of General Bliss hangs in Luce Hall at the United States Naval War College.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Fort Bliss, Texas is not named after him. Fort Bliss is named for Lieutenant Colonel William Wallace Smith Bliss, a veteran of the Mexican War.\n\nBliss never held the rank of colonel. He was promoted to brigadier general from major by an act of Congress at the President's request.\n\nBliss was also never commissioned as a lieutenant general. He was appointed a general by the U.S. President under U.S. Code, Title 10, Subtitle A, Part I, Chapter 6, § 164, which provided for the Chief of Staff of the Army to serve with the rank of general.\n\n\n\n"}

To that end, they produce print and internet resources, broadcast radio programs (\"The Bible Study Hour\", \"Every Last Word\", and \"Dr. Barnhouse & the Bible\") and organize conferences (Philadelphia Conference on Reformed Theology, Princeton Regional Conference on Reformed Theology, Reformation Societies) aimed at teaching the Reformed version of the Christian message.\n\nThe alliance promotes the traditional doctrines of the Protestant Reformation, particularly Calvinism, in response to a perception that \"the light of the Reformation has been significantly dimmed.\" It has been branded as \"exclusivist\" because of its focus on Reformed thought. The alliance has Anglican, Baptist, Christian Reformed, and Presbyterian supporters.\n\nThe alliance was formed in 1994 out of what was known as Evangelical Ministries when James Montgomery Boice, then senior pastor of Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia and teacher on \"The Bible Study Hour\" radio program, called together a group of like-minded pastors and theologians from a variety of denominations to unite in a common cause to help revive a passion \"for the truth of the Gospel\" within the church.\n\nOn April 17– 20, 1996, the alliance came together in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to draw up a statement that would be called the Cambridge Declaration.

Acidification, which gives the milk a tart taste, is achieved either through bacterial fermentation or through the addition of an acid, such as lemon juice or vinegar. The acid causes milk to coagulate and thicken, inhibiting the growth of harmless bacteria and improving the product's shelf life.\n\nSoured milk that is produced by bacterial fermentation is more specifically called fermented milk or cultured milk. Traditionally, soured milk was simply fresh milk that was left to ferment and sour by keeping it in a warm place for a day, often near a stove. Modern commercial soured milk may differ from milk that has become sour naturally.\n\nSoured milk that is produced by the addition of an acid, with or without the addition of microbial organisms, is more specifically called acidified milk. In the United States, acids used to manufacture acidified milk include acetic acid (commonly found in vinegar), adipic acid, citric acid (commonly found in lemon juice), fumaric acid, glucono-delta-lactone, hydrochloric acid, lactic acid, malic acid, phosphoric acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid. \n\nSoured milk is commonly made at home or is sold and consumed in Europe, especially in Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Belarus, Poland, Slovakia, Russia, Ukraine), all over the countries of the former Yugoslavia (Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia), Romania, Hungary, Greece, Finland, Germany, and Scandinavia.\n\nIt is also made at home or sold in supermarkets and consumed in the Great Lakes region of Somalia and Eastern Africa (Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania). It is also a traditional food of the Bantu people of Southern Africa. \n\nSince the 1970s, some producers have used chemical acidification in place of biological agents.\n\nRaw milk that has not gone sour is sometimes referred to as \"sweet milk\", because it contains the sugar lactose. Fermentation converts the lactose to lactic acid, which has a sour flavor. Before the invention of refrigeration, raw milk commonly became sour before it could be consumed, and various recipes incorporate such leftover milk as an ingredient. Sour milk produced by fermentation differs in flavor from that produced by acidification, because the acids commonly added in commercial manufacture have different flavors from lactic acid, and also because fermentation can introduce new flavors. Buttermilk is a common modern substitute for naturally soured milk.\n\n"}

Afterwards he was a trustee of the college from 1964 to 1972. He married the former Helen E. Inman in 1926.\n\nAccording to his official United States Army biography, Decker was commissioned a second lieutenant of infantry in June 1924, and began his army service with the 26th Infantry Regiment, then stationed at Plattsburg Barracks in upstate New York. In 1928, he was sent to Hawaii, where he served with the 35th Infantry Regiment until 1931. He was promoted to first lieutenant in April 1930. After attending advanced infantry training at the Infantry School at Fort Benning in 1932, he remained at Fort Benning with the 29th Infantry Regiment until 1935, followed by service at Vancouver Barracks, near Portland, Oregon with the 7th Infantry Regiment from 1935 to 1936 (during which time he was promoted to captain, in August 1935).\n\nIn 1936, Decker was sent to the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, from which he graduated in 1937. Subsequently, he served with the 10th Infantry Regiment at Fort Thomas, Kentucky and Fort McClellan, Alabama, and the 9th Infantry Regiment at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In 1940 he took command of Headquarters Company, I Corps, at Fort Jackson, South Carolina and was assistant supply and logistics officer, 1940–1941. In 1941 came a flurry of promotions: to temporary major (January), permanent major (June), and temporary lieutenant colonel (December). He was sent to Washington, D.C. to serve on the War Department General Staff, where he was assigned to the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Supply. He was promoted to temporary colonel in October 1942 and became deputy chief of staff of the Third Army, Fort Sam Houston, Texas. He was then sent overseas to the Southwest Pacific, where he became deputy chief of staff and then chief of staff of the Sixth Army, a position he held through the end of World War II. He had been promoted to temporary brigadier general in August 1944 and major general in June 1945, and participated in Sixth Army operations in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and the Philippines.\n\nDecker returned to Washington in 1946 to Headquarters, Army Ground Forces and Headquarters, Army Service Forces, but soon went back to the Pacific as deputy commanding general and chief of staff of United States Forces, Middle Pacific, Hawaii from 1946 to 1948.\n\nDecker became commanding general of the 5th Infantry Division in 1948, and in 1950 was assigned to the Office of the Comptroller of the Army as Chief of the Budget Division. Promoted to temporary lieutenant general in 1952, he became Comptroller of the United States Army from 1952 to 1955. He was promoted to permanent brigadier general in April 1953 and permanent major general in July 1954. In 1955, he went to Germany as commanding general of VII Corps at Stuttgart, and was promoted to temporary general in May 1956.\n\nFrom 1956 to 1957, Decker was deputy commander-in-chief of the United States European Command at its headquarters in Rocquencourt, outside Paris, France. From 1957 to 1959 he was commander-in-chief, United Nations Command, and commanding general, United States Forces Korea and Eighth United States Army.\n\nDecker was appointed Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army in 1959, and on October 1, 1960 became Chief of Staff of the United States Army, serving in that capacity until September 30, 1962. According to his army biography, highlights of Decker's tenure were supervising augmentations to meet the crisis in Berlin (prompted by the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961), increasing special warfare forces, initiating new divisional and forward depot concepts, and expanding the army to sixteen divisions. Decker retired at the end of his tenure.\n\n"}
{"id": "1868641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868641", "title": "KTXH", "text": "KTXH\n\nKTXH, virtual channel 20 (UHF digital channel 19), branded on-air as My 20 Vision, is a MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated television station licensed to Houston, Texas, United States. The station is owned by the Fox Television Stations subsidiary of Fox Corporation, as part of a duopoly with Fox owned-and-operated station KRIV (channel 26). The two stations share studios on Southwest Freeway in Houston (between the Uptown and Greenway Plaza districts); KTXH's transmitter is located near Missouri City, in unincorporated northeastern Fort Bend County.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on November 7, 1982, becoming the third independent station in Houston, after KRIV (then owned by Metromedia), and Gaylord Broadcasting's KHTV (channel 39, now Nexstar Media Group-owned CW affiliate KIAH). Its original studio facilities were located on Kirby Drive in Houston. It was also the second station in Texas owned by a group headed by television station entrepreneur Milton Grant. The station originally branded on-air as \"20 Vision.\"\n\nThe group signed on a similarly formatted station, KTXA in Fort Worth, in January 1981. KTXH programmed a general entertainment format consisting of cartoons, vintage off-network sitcoms and dramas, classic movies, westerns and sports events. The fledgling station was broadcasting from the original Senior Road Tower that collapsed on December 7, 1982, killing seven workers as the top half of the master FM antenna was being hoisted to the top. It was eventually replaced by a second tower. The station resumed operations on February 13, 1983 from the original KRIV (originally KDOG) transmitter site on top of One Shell Plaza in downtown Houston.\n\nGrant Broadcasting sold both KTXH and KTXA to Gulf Broadcasting in 1984. Gulf sold its television station holdings to Taft Broadcasting in 1985. Even after going through three owners within the same year, the station did not change its programming format, aside from adding more programming owned by Taft and distributed by new sister company Worldvision Enterprises, such as Hanna-Barbera cartoons.\n\nTaft sold its group of independent and Fox-affiliated stations, including KTXH and KTXA, to the TVX Broadcast Group in February 1987. In 1989, Paramount Pictures purchased a minority ownership in TVX, which suffered from financial problems after the Taft purchase. Paramount bought out the remainder of TVX's shares in 1991 and integrated the TVX stations into the Paramount Stations Group. Under Paramount, the station added several first-run syndicated programs in the mid-1990s, and changed its on-air branding to \"Paramount 20\" (mirroring other Paramount-owned independent stations, such as KTXA, that incorporated such branding).\n\nViacom acquired ownership of KTXH, KTXA and their sister stations when the company purchased Paramount Pictures in 1994. Channel 20 became an owned-and-operated station of the United Paramount Network (owned by Chris-Craft Industries in a programming partnership with Viacom, and later co-owned in a joint venture with Chris-Craft when it bought a 50% share in the network in 1996) upon the network's January 16, 1995 launch.\n\nKTXH was purchased by Fox Television Stations (then a subsidiary of News Corporation) in 2001, as part of a four-station trade deal which saw Viacom swapping KTXH and WDCA in Washington, D.C. in exchange for KBHK-TV (now KBCW) in San Francisco, which Fox had bought as part of its purchase of Chris-Craft's broadcasting division (that acquisition in turn, occurred after Viacom bought Chris-Craft's 50% ownership interest in UPN). The transaction established the first television duopoly in Houston between KRIV and KTXH (Fox had also owned several of KTXH's former sister stations under Taft). Channel 20 also relocated its broadcasting facilities from its original studios on Kirby Drive, near present-day NRG Park, to KRIV's studios near Greenway Plaza.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks' respective programming to create a new \"fifth\" network called The CW. Through an affiliation agreement with Tribune Broadcasting, KHWB (channel 39, which changed its callsign to KHCW shortly before the network's launch) was announced as The CW's Houston affiliate. Almost immediately, KTXH dropped all UPN network branding from its station promotions, revamped its logo to just feature the boxed \"20\", and ceased all promotion of any UPN programming. Additionally, the station began referring to itself in promos as \"Houston's 20\". Similar changes were also made to Fox's other UPN affiliates, as the initial list of CW charter affiliates consisted of both stations owned by the Tribune Company and network co-parent CBS. News Corporation also chose not to affiliate stations with The CW in markets where neither Tribune nor CBS (excluding CBS owned-and-operated stations) owned a station.\nOn February 22, 2006, in response to The CW's launch announcement, News Corporation announced the creation of a new \"sixth\" network called MyNetworkTV, which would be operated by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division Twentieth Television, with KTXH and the other Fox-owned UPN affiliates serving as charter affiliates. With the impending switch to MyNetworkTV, channel 20's on-air branding was changed to \"My20\" in June 2006. KTXH became a MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station when the network began operations on September 5 of that year. Although UPN continued to broadcast its programming on stations across the United States until September 15, 2006 (with some stations airing the final two weeks of the network's programming outside their regular primetime slots), KTXH and its Fox-owned sister stations did not carry UPN's final two weeks of programming as those stations dropped the network entirely on August 31, 2006.\n\nOn October 1, 2009, KTXH launched its new website at www.my20houston.com using the same platform as its sister station KRIV. Early content included a schedule for both local and national programming with links to weather, news, and traffic on www.myfoxhouston.com.\n\nOn the night of May 25, 2015, KTXH's over the air signal was knocked off the air for several hours as a result of the historic severe flash flooding event in Texas.\n\nOn December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company, owner of ABC's owned-and-operated station KTRK-TV (channel 13), announced its intent to buy KTXH's parent company, 21st Century Fox, for $66.1 billion, pending regulatory approval; the sale excluded KTXH and sister station KRIV as well as the Fox network, the MyNetworkTV programming service and the Fox Television Stations unit, which was transferred to a separate company. The split was officially completed on January 1, 2019.\n\nOn September 24, 2018, KTXH adopted a new on-air branding as \"My 20 Vision\", paying homage to the station's popular 1980s-era branding as 20 Vision that was first adopted under Taft ownership and lasted until its acquisition by Paramount. The station is one of several Fox-owned MyNetworkTV affiliates to have moved away from the service's brand given its eventual transition from a network to a programming service, though unlike KTXH most chose to rebrand as an extension of their sister Fox O&O's branding.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKTXH discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 20, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 19, using PSIP to display KTXH's virtual channel as 20 on digital television receivers.\n\nDespite being a network affiliate, KTXH for the most part operates as a general entertainment independent station as MyNetworkTV only broadcasts for two hours on weeknights. While it does serve as a secondary Fox affiliate in events where breaking news or severe weather coverage may preempt Fox programming, it does not regularly carry any newscasts from sister station KRIV. Most of the station's syndicated programs outside of MyNetworkTV programming consist of off-network repeats of \"The Big Bang Theory\", \"2 Broke Girls\", \"The Simpsons\", \"\", \"Dateline\", \"Chicago P.D.\" and \"America Says\", as well as repeats of first-run syndicated programs seen earlier on KRIV including \"The Wendy Williams Show\", \"The Real\", \"TMZ on TV\", \"The Dr. Oz Show\" and \"Judge Judy\". First-run syndicated programs seen exclusively on KTXH include \"Family Feud\", \"Divorce Court\", \"Caught in Providence\", \"Personal Injury Court\" and \"The 700 Club\".\n\nThroughout most of the 1980s and 1990s, as well as for select games during the late 2000s, KTXH was the over-the-air broadcast home for Houston Astros baseball and Houston Rockets basketball games, with a primary emphasis on road games while most of the teams' respective home games aired on Home Sports Entertainment (which eventually became Fox Sports Houston and even produced the teams' 2000s-era broadcasts on KTXH). Hannah Storm, later a noted national broadcast personality, anchored the station's coverage of the Rockets in the mid-1980s. Another noted broadcast personality, former \"American Gladiators\" co-host Lisa Malosky, would preside over studio hosting duties in the 1990s.\n\n\n"}

Titles in the series include \"Sideways Stories from Wayside School\" (1978), \"Wayside School is Falling Down\" (1989), \"Wayside School Gets A Little Stranger\" (1995), and \"Wayside School Beneath the Cloud of Doom\" (2020). The books tell the stories of a school built 30 floors high, with one classroom on each floor, but without a 19th floor.\n\nSachar released two spinoff books of mathematics and puzzles interspersed with stories: \"Sideways Arithmetic from Wayside School\" (1989) and \"More Sideways Arithmetic from Wayside School\" (1994). A television special loosely based on the books \"\" aired in 2005, and was followed-up by the \"Wayside\" animated series that originally ran from 2007 to 2008.\n\nWhile a student at University of California, Berkeley, author Louis Sachar began working at an elementary school to earn college credit. Sachar later recalled,\n\nSachar graduated from UC Berkeley in 1976 with a degree in Economics, and began working on \"Sideways Stories From Wayside School\", a children's book set at an elementary school with supernatural elements. Although the book's students were named after children from Hillside and there is a presumably autobiographical character named \"Louis the Yard Teacher,\" Sachar has said that he draws very little from personal experience, explaining that \"...my personal experiences are kind of boring. I have to make up what I put in my books.\"\n\nThe \"Wayside School\" books take place on the thirtieth story of Wayside School, which is taught by Mrs. Jewls, a nice teacher with occasionally impractical teaching methods. She is the replacement for the old teacher, Mrs. Gorf, who was an evil teacher who could wiggle her ears and stick out her tongue to turn the students into apples. The third book introduces her son, Mr. Gorf, who could steal voices through a third nostril, alongside Mrs. Drazil, Louis's old teacher who remembers students that forgot homework assignments from decades ago, and Ms. Wendy Nogard, who could read thoughts with a third ear on the top of her head.\n\nThe thirtieth story has had thirty students taught throughout the course of the books, such as Todd, an unfavored student of Mrs. Jewls who she sends home on the kindergarten bus after slight misdemeanors; Maurecia, a sweet and sensitive girl who loves ice cream; Dana, a girl with glasses who has a tendency to be overemotional; and Myron, a trustworthy and loyal student who was class president for one day. Other students include John, who could only read upside-down until his brain got flipped; Joe, a boy with several curly hairs who can't count right; Stephen, a boy who frequently shows up to class in silly outfits; Jenny, a girl who is often late to school and has to get there on a motorcycle; Bebe, a girl who can produce art very quickly, but is shown to be a bit troublesome in class; Rondi, a girl who is often recognized for the front teeth she doesn't have until she gets them in the second book; and Leslie, a girl with long pigtails that are often pulled by Paul, an inattentive boy who loves pulling pigtails. There are also the Three Erics, consisting of Eric Fry, the most athletic Eric who is often called \"Butterfingers\" since the other Erics aren’t athletic; Eric Bacon, the skinniest Eric who is often called \"Fatso\" since the other Erics are fat; and Eric Ovens, the nicest Eric who is usually called \"Crabapple\" since the other Erics are typically pretty negative. Sharie is a girl who wears a large coat and frequently falls asleep in class, but is respected since Mrs. Jewls believes she learns best that way; Deedee is a girl who likes sports but is always stuck with the lame yellow ball, which doesn't bounce and always goes the opposite way of where the person kicks it. Also in the books are Allison, a girl who typically tries to assert dominance, even over her friends; D.J., a boy who usually smiles, even without reason; Dameon, a boy with a crush on Mrs. Jewls who often is sent running up and down the thirty flights of stairs at Wayside; Joy, a tomboyish kleptomaniac who usually targets Todd or Dameon; Jason, a boy with a big mouth who always gets in bad situations; Kathy, a girl who is mean to all the other students; Terrence, a school bully who rarely shares and usually kicks the balls over the fence; Mac, a boy who once was named Nancy and now tells long stories in class; Ron, a boy with weak feet who loves to play kickball; and Calvin, a slow-paced student who is Bebe's art assistant.\n\nThree new students were introduced throughout the course of the series, the first being Sammy, who first appeared in \"Sideways Stories from Wayside School\", who was revealed to be a dead rat bundled in raincoats by the end of the chapter. The second was Sue, who only appeared in the spin-off books, a normal girl who transferred to Wayside, only to be confused by the school's bizarre teaching methods. The third and final was Benjamin Nushmutt, introduced in \"Wayside School is Falling Down\", being a boy who everyone believed was named Mark Miller up until the twenty-ninth chapter of the book.\n\nOther members of the school staff include Louis, a character based on Louis Sachar himself, being the school's yard teacher with a mustache of many colors who is friends with all the kids; Miss Mush, the school's cafeteria lady whose meals are so horrible, students rarely dare to eat them, as well as her assistant, Mr. Pepperadder, who only appears in the math spin-offs, being a person who is often pranked by Miss Mush because he is shorter than her. Mr. Kidswatter is the school principal, who hates all the kids and often overreacts when things don't go his way. Dr. Pickell is the school counselor, who uses hypnosis on the students to cure their ailments but also adds strange side effects. Miss Zarves is the teacher of the nineteenth story, which doesn't exist, and four kids named Ray, Virginia, Nick, and Mark. She and her students supposedly do not exist either. There is also Miss Worm, the teacher of the honors class story who is annoyed by Mrs. Jewls's teaching methods. A few one-off characters include Mrs. Waloosh, the eccentric dance teacher at the school; Mrs. Franklin, a substitute from the second book that believed all the students were named Benjamin; Mrs. Day, the school secretary; and David, Mr. Kidswatter's chauffeur.\n\nA few more characters include Hobo Bob, a hobo who hates socks brought in by Sharie for show-and-tell; Xavier Dalton, a man who made Ms. Nogard bitter and hateful after being disgusted by her third ear; Mr. Finch, a man who saved up his life savings to start an ice cream company; and the numerous cows, one of which ended up on the nineteenth story, that came to the school leading to it being shut down for 243 days.\n\n\nIn 2005, Nelvana produced an hour-long television special loosely based on the books called \"\". The special was later spun off into a series titled \"Wayside\", which aired on Nickelodeon (U.S.) and Teletoon (Canada) from 2007 to 2008.\n\nSachar, Louis. Sideways Stories from Wayside School.

When everted, it is sticky, and probably serves to hold the spore on to the intestinal wall of the prospective host, and to help separate the valves of the spore.\n\nThe polar filament is important in species classification. In some species of Ceratomyxa, the polar filament forms a straight basal section, which the rest of the filament coils around, while in the genus Sphaeromyxa, the filament is folded in a zig-zag arrangement, rather than being coiled.\n"}
{"id": "1868681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868681", "title": "Chief Justice of Fiji", "text": "Chief Justice of Fiji\n\nThe Chief Justice is Fiji's highest judicial officer. The office and its responsibilities are set out in Chapter 5 of the 2013 Constitution of Fiji. The Chief Justice is appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister, who is required by the Constitution to consult the Attorney-General (Section 106-1). Under the previous 1997 Constitution, the Prime Minister was required to consult with the Leader of the Opposition. The appointment is permanent, until the Chief Justice reaches the age of 75 years (Section 110-1).\n\nLike other judges, the Chief Justice need not be a Fijian citizen. When Sir Timoci Tuivaga retired in 2002, there were calls from the Citizens Constitutional Forum (a pro-democracy, human rights organization) for a foreigner to be appointed, to restore the independence of the judiciary that had been seen to be politically compromised by the 2000 coup. The government, however, appointed Fijian Daniel Fatiaki. In 2007, the military-backed interim government appointed Australian citizen Anthony Gates as Acting Chief Justice; he became permanent Chief Justice on 5 December 2008.\n\nAccording to Chapter 5 of the 2013 Constitution, the Chief Justice sits on the High Court (Section 100) and presides over the Supreme Court (Section 98), but is barred from membership of the Court of Appeal. This stipulation is designed to give the Appeal Court a measure of independence from the other two courts. The Chief Justice also chairs the Judicial Service Commission (Section 104(a)).\n\nAccording to the 2013 Constitution of Fiji, the Chief Justice is the first in the order of succession to discharge the duties of the President as Acting President should the President of Fiji be unable to discharge her or his office or if the office becomes vacant for any reason. The 2013 Constitution also stipulates that in the absence of the Chief Justice, the next senior most substantive judge performs the duties of the President as the Acting President.\n\nBefore 1871, when Seru Epenisa Cakobau established the first unified Kingdom of Viti under his authority, what is now Fiji was a patchwork of warring fiefdoms. Forming a government dominated by foreigners, Cakobau appointed Sir Charles St Julian, an Australian newspaper editor, as the first Chief Justice in 1872. St Julian died in office a few weeks after Cakobau ceded Fiji to the United Kingdom on 10 October 1874, under the provisions of the Pacific Islanders Protection Acts of 1872 and 1875, (amended in 1875), (long title: An Act for the Prevention and Punishment of Criminal Outrages upon Natives of the Islands in the Pacific Ocean) which sought to bring the rule of law to British subjects who were using unconventional methods to supply labour for the European-run cotton plantations in Fiji. St. Julian was followed as Chief Justice in 1875 by Sir William Hackett.\n\nFrom 1877 through 1961, the Chief Justice of Fiji was \"ex officio\" Chief Justice of the High Commissioner's Court, more commonly known as the Chief Judicial Commissioner for the Western Pacific, the chief judicial officer throughout the British Western Pacific Territories, a supra-colonial entity established by the \"Western Pacific Orders-in-Council 1877\" (amended in 1879 and 1880), and by the \"Pacific Order-in-Council 1893\". Appeals lay to the Privy Council in London. From 1942 to 1945 the High Commission was suspended by military administration during the War in the Pacific. Headed by a High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, who was also \"ex officio\" the Governor of Fiji, until the end of 1952, it included numerous islands, mostly small, throughout Oceania. Composition varied over time, but Fiji (1877-1952) and the Solomon Islands (1893-1976) were its most durable members.\n\nFrom the beginning of 1953, Fiji and Tonga were separated from the High Commission as a prelude to full independence, and the High Commission offices were transferred to Honiara on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. The office of High Commissioner was separated from that of the Governor of Fiji and was now held by the Governor of the Solomon Islands). The High Commissioner's Court, however, continued to sit in Suva, and the Chief Justice of Fiji remained the Chief Judicial Commissioner of the Western Pacific until 1962.\n\nFrom 1962 onwards, functions of the High Commissioner's Court began to be transferred to the increasingly independent island states under the provisions of \"Western Pacific (Courts) Order in Council, 1961\". The Judicial Commissioner for the Western Pacific became the Chief Justice of the High Court of the Western Pacific, and removed from Fiji to join the rest of the British High Commission in the Solomon Islands. The position was separated from that of the Chief Justice of Fiji.\n\nFiji gained independence on 10 October 1970. Although no longer connected with the British High Commission, the position of Chief Justice of Fiji continued to be filled by judges from Britain, Australia and New Zealand until the appointment of Sir Timoci Tuivaga in 1980.\n\nThe constitutional arrangements relating to the Chief Justice were temporarily overturned in 2000, following a counter-coup by Commodore Frank Bainimarama to neutralize a civilian coup d'état instigated by George Speight. The then-Chief Justice, Sir Timoci Tuivaga recognized the Interim Military Government that took office and abrogated the Constitution on 29 May, and drafted the controversial Administration of Justice Decree that was immediately promulgated by the military administration. This decree abolished the Supreme Court, made the Chief Justice head of the Appeal Court, and raised the retirement age of the Chief Justice from 70 years to 75. These changes were reversed following a decision of the High Court to reinstate the Constitution on 15 November 2000, a decision upheld by the Appeal Court on 1 March 2001.\n\nKamal Kumar is the acting Chief Justice. Anthony Gates has retired on March 2019, who succeeded Daniel Fatiaki following the military coup that deposed the Qarase government on 5 December 2006, when Commodore Josaia Voreqe (Frank) Bainimarama, the Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces and Acting President of Fiji, sent Fatiaki on leave. The military regime named him as Acting Chief Justice on 3 January 2007, and installed him as the substantive Chief Justice on 5 December 2008.\n\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n\n\n"}

The awards ceremony, presenting Emmys from the previous calendar year, is usually held on a Spring Monday night, sometime in the last two weeks in April or the first week in May. The Sports Emmy Awards are all given away at one ceremony, unlike the Primetime Emmy Awards and the Daytime Emmy Awards, which hold a \"Creative Arts\" ceremony in which Emmys are given to behind-the-scenes personnel.\n\nThe first Emmy for \"Best Sports Coverage\" was handed out at the second annual Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony in 1950, where KTLA, a local television station in Los Angeles, won the award for coverage of wrestling. The following year, another Los Angeles-based station, KNBH, won an Emmy for their coverage of the Los Angeles Rams American football team. At the seventh Primetime Emmys in 1955, NBC became the first major network to win a Sports Emmy Award for its series, the \"Gillette Cavalcade of Sports\".\n\nIn 1979, an Emmys exclusively for sports coverage was held for the first time at the Rainbow Room in New York City. Winners included golf announcer Jack Whitaker, and CBS's \"The NFL Today\". The ninth annual Sports Emmy Awards, hosted by actors Alan Thicke and Joan Van Ark and held on July 13, 1988, became the first Sports Emmys ceremony to be televised; the live telecast was syndicated nationwide by Raycom Sports. Dennis Miller hosted in the 12th Sports Emmys in 1991, which was broadcast on ESPN.\n\nAmong the Sports Emmy rules, a show must originally air on American television during the eligibility period between January 1 and December 31, and to at least 50 percent of the country. A show that enters into the Sports Emmys cannot also be entered into any other national Emmy competition. Certain shows and segments that air on sports networks that are more entertainment or news, including award shows, the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympics, and the Super Bowl halftime show, are ineligible for the Sports Emmys.\n\nEntries must be submitted by mid-January. Most award categories also require entries to include DVDs or tape masters of the show. For most program categories, the submitted DVDs should feature up to five excerpts. For most personality categories, there is no limit in the number of segments submitted, but the DVD should not run over a total of 12 minutes.\n\nVoting is done by peer judging panels between February and early March. The Academy solicits anybody with significant experience in national sports production to serve as\njudges. The panels are organized so that they only have one representative from each corporate entity (i.e. CBS Corporation, Disney, NBCUniversal, News Corporation, Time Warner etc.) Most categories only have a single voting round using preferential scoring system. The top 5 entries in each category are announced as the \"nominations\", and then the top entry is announced as the Emmy winner later at the awards ceremony.\n\nWhen a show wins a Sports Emmy, each member of the crew that worked on the production is eligible to purchase an Emmy statue, provided that their job title corresponds to the category that the show won the award in. This policy can result in many different people \"winning\" an Emmy for a single production; for example, when the Olympics on NBC wins an award for Outstanding Technical Team (Remote), as often occurs, the hundreds of personnel working on the production all have the right to purchase an Emmy statue. Depending on the production, the show or network that won the award will sometimes pay for the purchase of statues for the entire crew.\n\nAt that inaugural ceremony in 1979, there were 12 categories. The 36th ceremony in 2015 had 40 categories:\n\n\n9 wins\n\n8 wins\n\n7 wins\n\n6 wins\n\n5 wins\n\n4 wins\n\n3 wins\n\n\n2 wins\n\n\n23 wins\n\n16 wins\n\n9 wins\n\n7 wins\n\n6 wins\n\n4 wins\n\n3 wins\n\n2 wins\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1868688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868688", "title": "Beer Barrel Polka", "text": "Beer Barrel Polka\n\n\"Beer Barrel Polka\", also known as \"The Barrel Polka\" and \"Roll Out the Barrel\", is a song which became popular worldwide during World War II. The music was composed by the Czech musician Jaromír Vejvoda in 1927. Eduard Ingriš wrote the first arrangement of the piece, after Vejvoda came upon the melody and sought Ingriš's help in refining it. At that time, it was played without lyrics as \"Modřanská polka\" (\"Polka of Modřany\"). Its first text was written later (in 1934) by Václav Zeman – with the title \"Škoda lásky\" (\"Wasted Love\").\n\nThe polka became famous around the world. In June 1939, \"Beer Barrel Polka\", as recorded by Will Glahé, was number one on the Hit Parade. This version was distributed by Shapiro Bernstein. Glahé's earlier 1934 recording sold many copies in its German version \"Rosamunde\" (it is possible the reason for the rapid spread was due to the occupation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany, and subsequent emigration of thousands of Czechs to other parts of the world, bringing this catchy tune with them). The authors of the English lyrics were Lew Brown and Wladimir Timm. Meanwhile, the song was recorded and played by many others such as The Andrews Sisters in 1939, the Glenn Miller Orchestra, Benny Goodman, Bobby Vinton, Billie Holiday, and Joe Patek who sold over a million copies of his album \"Beer Barrel Polka.\"\n\nDuring World War II, versions in many other languages were created and the song was popular among soldiers, regardless of their allegiances. On VE Day, 9 May 1945, Humphrey Lyttelton played it standing on a handcart outside Buckingham Palace, a performance that could be heard in the BBC broadcast from the victory celebrations. It was claimed many times that the song was written in the country where it had just become a hit. Its actual composer was not widely known until after the war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The flight, which had originated at Idlewild International Airport (now John F. Kennedy International Airport), crashed on approach to Zaventem Airport, Brussels, killing all 72 people on board and one person on the ground. The fatalities included the entire U.S. Figure Skating team, who were travelling to the World Figure Skating Championships in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Despite a thorough investigation, the precise cause of the crash remains a mystery; the most likely explanation was thought to be a failure of the tail stabilizer-adjusting mechanism.\n\nThis was the first fatal accident involving a Boeing 707 in regular passenger service; it happened just 28 months after the 707 airliner was placed into commercial use. It remains the deadliest plane crash ever to occur on Belgian soil.\n\nThere were eleven crew members on board the ill-fated flight. The two pilots, Louis Lambrechts and Jean Roy, were both experienced ex-army pilots. There were no difficulties reported during the seven and a half hour trans-Atlantic flight from New York; there was no indication that the plane was in any particular trouble, although the flight crew did lose radio contact with Brussels airport about twenty minutes before coming in to land.\n\nUnder clear skies, at about 10:00 Brussels time (CET; 09:00 UTC), the Boeing 707 was on a long approach to Runway 20 when, near the runway threshold and at a height of , power was increased and the landing gear retracted. The airplane had been forced to cancel its final approach to Brussels airport, as a small plane had not yet cleared the runway. The 707 circled the airport and made another attempt to land on adjoining Runway 25, which was not operational; this second approach was also aborted. It became clear to observers that the pilots were fighting for control of the aircraft, making a desperate attempt to land despite the fact that a mechanical malfunction was preventing them from making a normal landing. The plane circled the airfield three times altogether, during which the bank angle gradually increased until the aircraft had climbed to and was in a near vertical bank. It then leveled its wings, pitched up abruptly, lost speed and spiralled rapidly nose down, plunging into the ground less than two miles (3 km) from the airport, at 10:05 CET (09:05 UTC).\n\nThe location of the crash was a marshy area adjacent to farmland near Berg (then an independent hamlet, nowadays part of Kampenhout), four miles northeast of Brussels. Eyewitnesses said that the plane exploded when it hit the ground and heavy black smoke was seen coming from the wreckage which had burst into flames. Theo de Laet, a young farmer and noted amateur cyclist, who was working in a field near to the crash site, was killed by a piece of aluminum shrapnel from the plane. Another field worker, Marcel Lauwers, was also hit by flying debris which amputated part of his leg.\n\nFather Joseph Cuyt, a local priest who had been observing the airplane as it came in to land, rushed to the scene but was driven back by the intense heat of the fire. Airport rescue vehicles arrived at the crash site almost immediately but the plane was already a blazing bonfire. It is believed that all 72 occupants of the plane were killed instantly on impact.\n\nBaudouin I, King of the Belgians, and his consort, Queen Fabiola, travelled to the scene of the disaster to provide comfort to the bereaved families. They donated oak coffins bearing the royal seal to transport the bodies back home.\n\nAll eighteen members of the 1961 U.S. Figure Skating team lost their lives, as well as sixteen other people who were accompanying them, including family members, professional coaches, and skating officials. Among the fatalities were nine-times U.S. ladies' champion, turned coach, Maribel Vinson-Owen and her two daughters: reigning U.S. ladies' champion Laurence Owen, aged sixteen, and her 20-year-old sister, reigning U.S. pairs champion Maribel Owen, both of whom had won gold medals at the 1961 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Colorado Springs just two weeks earlier. Laurence Owen was the cover story for the February 13 issue of \"Sports Illustrated\", just two days before her untimely death.\n\nMaribel Owen's pairs champion partner Dudley \"Dud\" Richards and reigning U.S. men's champion Bradley Lord were also killed, along with U.S. ice dance champions Diane \"Dee Dee\" Sherbloom and Larry Pierce. The team also lost U.S. men's silver medalist Gregory Kelley, U.S. ladies' silver medalist Stephanie \"Steffi\" Westerfeld, and U.S. ladies' bronze medalist Rhode Lee Michelson.\n\nDespite the fact that some national teams had already arrived in Prague for the World Championships—which were scheduled to start on February 22—the devastating loss of the U.S. team forced the event to be canceled. The competition organizers in Prague initially confirmed that the event would go ahead, but the International Skating Union (ISU) conducted a poll to agree on the most appropriate course of action; the vote, which took place on February 16, went in favor of cancelation out of respect for the U.S. team. A telegram was sent from ISU headquarters which read: \"In view of the tragic death of 44 [sic] American skaters and officials the 1961 world championship will not be held.\" Prague was given the chance to host the event the following year.\n\nThe figure skating team was mourned across the U.S. and all of the national newspapers carried the story on their front pages.\n\nIn office for less than a month, President John F. Kennedy issued a statement of condolence from the White House, which read: \"Our country has sustained a great loss of talent and grace which had brought pleasure to people all over the world. Mrs. Kennedy and I extend our deepest sympathy to the families and friends of all the passengers and crew who died in this crash.\" He was particularly affected by the tragedy; pairs skater Dudley Richards was a personal friend of the president and his brother Ted, and they had spent summers together in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.\n\nThe disaster struck a severe blow to the U.S. Figure Skating program, which had dominated the sport throughout the 1950s. Frank Shumway, who had only very recently become vice president of U.S. Figure Skating, predicted that it would take up to four years for the U.S. to regain its world prominence in the sport.\n\nBarbara Roles, the 1960 Olympic bronze medalist, felt obligated to come out of retirement, and won a gold medal at the 1962 U.S. Championships less than eight months after giving birth to her first child. At the same time, some of the younger American figure skaters progressed more quickly due to the lack of senior skaters competing in the field. Scott Allen won a silver medal at the 1962 U.S. Championships when he was just twelve years old, and then won bronze at the 1964 Winter Olympics the week of his fifteenth birthday, becoming one of the youngest Olympic medalists in history. It was not until 1965 that the U.S. started to win medals at the World Championships again; and the U.S. did not regain international prominence in figure skating until the 1968 Winter Olympics when Peggy Fleming won gold in the ladies' event and Tim Wood won silver in the men's.\n\nAs the fatalities included many top American coaches as well as the skating team, the tragedy was also indirectly responsible for bringing foreign coaches to the U.S. to fill the vacuum that was left behind. U.S. Figure Skating team coach, William Kipp, who was one of those who died on the Brussels flight, was eventually replaced by British former world champion pairs skater John Nicks in the fall of 1961. Italian world bronze medalist Carlo Fassi was another international coach who relocated from overseas to help rebuild the U.S. Figure Skating program.\n\nThe disaster prompted U.S. Figure Skating executives to issue a mandate that still applies today: No team traveling to an international competition would ever be allowed to fly together again.\n\nThe Belgian Government immediately ordered a full inquiry into the cause of the accident, and an investigation was conducted by the Belgian National authorities, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), who spent several months combing through the evidence. There was much speculation about what may have happened; the FBI even reportedly considered the possibility of terrorism.\n\nThe exact cause of the crash was never fully determined, but the authorities eventually agreed that the most likely explanation was a mechanical failure of one of the flight control mechanisms, probably a malfunction of either the wing spoilers or the tail stabilizers. Although there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt which of the flight systems had malfunctioned, the FAA were of the opinion that the tail stabilizer-adjusting mechanism had failed, allowing the stabilizer to run to the \"10.5deg nose-up position\".\n\nThere were 34 members of the U.S. Figure Skating delegation on board the fatal flight—almost half the plane's occupants—all heading for the 1961 World Figure Skating Championships in Prague. The eighteen figure skaters were accompanied by six coaches, the team manager, two judges, one referee, and six family members. The notable victims are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin days of the tragedy, the U.S. Figure Skating Executive Committee established the 1961 U.S. Figure Skating Memorial Fund, to honor the eighteen team members and their entourage who lost their lives on Sabena Flight 548. The mission of the Memorial Fund was to help rebuild the U.S. Figure Skating program, by providing financial support to promising young figure skaters to enable them to pursue their goals and develop their full potential. In March 1961, a benefit was held in the Boston Garden arena to raise money for the Memorial Fund. Over the years, thousands of young U.S. skaters have benefited from the fund which has continued to grow and prosper. One of the first beneficiaries was 12-year-old Peggy Fleming, whose coach William Kipp had died in the plane crash. Fleming became a symbol of the rebirth of U.S. Figure Skating when she went on to win gold at the 1968 Winter Olympics.\n\nIn January 2011, the 1961 U.S. Figure Skating team were inducted into the U.S. Skating Hall of Fame in a special ceremony at the 2011 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Greensboro, North Carolina. All eighteen team members were inducted, along with the six professional coaches that were accompanying them on the flight, Linda Hadley, William Kipp, Maribel Vinson-Owen, Daniel Ryan, Edi Scholdan, and William Swallender.\n\nIn 2009, U.S. Figure Skating commissioned the production of a full-length feature documentary film called \"RISE\", to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the loss of the 1961 figure skating team. The film was produced and directed by the Emmy Award winning company Lookalike Productions, of Englewood, New Jersey. \"RISE\" was shown in theaters across the U.S. for one night only, on February 17, 2011, with one encore presentation on March 7, 2011. Proceeds from the movie were donated to the U.S. Figure Skating Memorial Fund. The film was shown on the Versus network on October 22, 2011.\n\nVinson-Owen Elementary School, in Winchester, Massachusetts, is named in honor of Maribel Vinson-Owen and her two daughters who died in the accident. It ranks consistently among the top schools in Greater Boston.\n\nThe 40th anniversary of the crash was marked by the unveiling of a five-foot-high stone monument in Berg-Kampenhout, close to the scene of the tragedy. Local dignitaries attended the unveiling ceremony which took place on February 10, 2001.\n\n\n\n"}

These are most commonly found in secular colleges and universities to cater to students of particular religious beliefs where the institution is not affiliated with, cannot endorse a particular religion, or hire its own religious ministers. These are sometimes affiliated as registered student organizations of their local university.\n\nThe need for pastoral services in secular universities can be traced back to the writings of John Henry Newman advocating for societies of Catholic students to be established at secular universities in England. The rising popularity of public universities in many parts of the world over sectarian private universities also necessitated a need for Christian ministerial services for students. At the same time Christian churches in the vicinity of colleges and universities may provide worship and ministerial services to local students. \n\nIn the United States there are about 250 Catholic Newman Centers that minister to Catholic students at public universities. They trace their origin to the Newman movement and are ministered by laypeople, local parishes, or religious institutes. More recently, lay apostolates such as the Fellowship of Catholic University Students (FOCUS), established in 1997, are ministering to and re-evangelizing Catholic university students and young adults.\nLDS Student Association of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n\nProtestant Christian and Ecumenical groups following their establishment also created ministries especially focused on evangelizing students. One most recognizable group is Cru, originally known as Campus Crusade for Christ, a inner-denominational Christian ministry established in 1951 on the campus of UCLA which has ministries in over a thousand universities. Various other evangelical groups have worldwide networks of campus ministries including the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students, World Student Christian Federation, and The Navigators. Often Protestant denominations will also have a related para-church student fellowship ministry or college group directly or indirectly affiliated with their denomination, sometimes named by it. Additionally, independent churches will often have college ministries which may extend onto constituent college campuses in the form of a student organization.\nList of multi-campus protestant college ministries:\n\n"}

The trunkline follows State Street through the Saginaw area, and east of Lathrop Avenue, M-58 is split along two streets, using Davenport Avenue as well. This is the third time that the number has been used on a highway in Michigan; the first two were used in the Berrien County and Pontiac areas. The Saginaw version was designated in 1971, and it is listed on the National Highway System.\n\nM-58 starts at an intersection with M-47 (Midland Road) near the Tittabawassee River in Saginaw Township. It runs east on State Street through a commercial area in the township. Continuing east, the adjoining properties transition to residential buildings. Between Avalon and Lathrop avenues, M-58 splits into a one-way pairing of streets: eastbound traffic continues along State Street, but westbound traffic uses Davenport Avenue, one block to the north. Just east of this split, M-58 crosses into the City of Saginaw.\n\nIn Saginaw, the two parallel streets continue east and meet M-84 which runs north–south along Bay Street. The distance between the two parallel streets decreases east of North Carolina Street when Davenport Avenue shifts to the south. The intersection with Hill Street marks the beginning of the connections to the exit 3 interchange along a bend in the I-675 freeway. Hill Street is one-way carrying traffic southbound exiting from southbound I-675 to either direction of M-58. Two blocks east, Michigan Avenue carries traffic northbound under the freeway, connecting to a ramp to northbound I-675 before continuing north through the city of Saginaw. East of this intersection, State Street curves to the north, intersecting Davenport Avenue and merging into the ramp for southbound I-675. A loop ramp across the freeway provides access from northbound I-675 to Davenport Avenue. This interchange complex marks the eastern terminus of M-58.\n\nM-58 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2009 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-58 were the 28,648 vehicles daily east of the split at Lathrop Avenue; the lowest counts were the 18,827 vehicles per day by the I-675 interchange . All of M-58 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.\n\nOn July 1, 1919, the first M-58 was a highway in Berrien County connecting M-40 (now M-51) in downtown Niles with M-11 (later US Highway 12 [US 12], and presently Business Loop I-94) south of downtown St. Joseph. On November 11, 1926, the entire length was redesignated as a part of US 31. From 1930 through 1961, a second iteration of M-58 existed in Oakland County as a western bypass around Pontiac; the route ran from US 10 at the corner of Woodward Avenue and Square Lake Road south of Pontiac west to Telegraph Road and then north along Telegraph road to US 10 (Dixie Highway) north of Pontiac.\n\nThis route is the third iteration of M-58 in Michigan. This route came into being when the western segment of M-81 was redesignated in 1971 following the completion of I-675 into downtown Saginaw. The routing has remained unchanged since designation.\n\n"}

{"id": "1868723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868723", "title": "Hard Truck", "text": "Hard Truck\n\nHard Truck is a series of trucking simulators and racing video games published in the United States by ValuSoft. The series consists of three main titles and a spin-off.\n\nThe original Hard Truck, also subtitled as Hard Truck: Road to Victory, was developed by Russian developer SoftLab-NSK published by Buka Entertainment, and released on April 20, 1998. It emphasized truck racing, in which players can race against trucks without cargo on a 3-lap circuit or with cargo to deliver on any of 3 linear courses, with no other vehicles present. All racing courses, including a training course, are accessible from a central base of operations where the player can obtain cargo, as well as purchase upgrades or even new trucks.\n\nThis game featured the following trucks: DAF, ZiL, GAZelle, MAZ T-Storm, Mack Vision, Kenworth, Peterbilt, Freightliner Trucks Century Classic and Navistar (International Trucks).\n\nThe 2002 sequel to \"Hard Truck\", like its predecessor, is open world, but grants far more freedom with a larger world that only requires one loading screen per play session, while shifting focus from racing to cargo transport across various cities (although competition with rival truckers is still present). It also adds traffic, police and mafia, and trucks can fall under attack if drivers do not practice safe driving or are spotted by mafia. Making money with successful deliveries is crucial to gameplay, as running out of funds would result in a game over, and the ultimate goal of the game is to achieve dominance of the trucking market (with at least a 51% stake), but not before gaining enough money to start a company first.\n\nThe sequel incorporates the same truck brands from the first game, while also including Volvo, Scania AB and Mercedes-Benz Actros. Cars that can be encountered in gameplay include the BMW M5, the Renault Megane, the Fiat Marea, the Offroad HL/PS, the Oka and the Volga.\n\nIn the same year \"King of the Road\" was released, a third \"Hard Truck\" game developed by SCS Software was also released, subtitled \"18 Wheels of Steel\". Unlike the previous two \"Hard Truck\" games, it removes racing altogether and focuses entirely on delivery of goods, playing more similar to \"Hard Truck 2\". It also incorporates a traffic system, as well as elements of business management simulation, where drivers can be hired and routes set up to make a profit.\n\nThis is also the first game of ValuSoft's \"18 Wheels of Steel\" series, consisting of several games and spanning nearly a decade.\n\n\"Hard Truck Apocalypse\", released in June 26, 2006, is another spin-off of \"Hard Truck\", but its connection to the themes of \"Hard Truck\" is remotely in name only. Developed by the Russian developer Targem Games, released on June 26, 2006, \"Apocalypse\" is a completely different take on the hard truck games, set in an apocalyptic, \"Mad Max\"-like future. A disaster occurred and everyone on Earth has to wear special masks to survive. Trade runs between villages to make money can still be done but the main method for making money is to loot destroyed enemies of cargo and weapons.\n\nThe game takes place in an apocalyptic version of Europe, with different zones depicting countries like Germany, France, England, and many more. Five vehicles, from a simple van to the gigantic BelAZ, are available to drive. The guns vary from roof-mounted machine guns, shotguns, and mortars to laser and energy weapons.\n\nThe game was soon followed by \"Hard Truck Apocalypse: Rise of Clans\", The official standalone expansion to \"Hard Truck Apocalypse\", also developed by Targem Games. It has not been released in western stores yet, but can be purchased and downloaded online at GamersGate. It takes place in an apocalyptic version of North America. In the game the player is a vagrant, a strong loner who is searching for the mythical city of Edmonton in \"le canada\".\n\nThe game reuses a lot of material from \"Hard Truck Apocalypse\" but most of the vehicles, weapons, and enemies are the same. There are four new zones and a whole new storyline.\n\nIn the United States, the \"Hard Truck\" series sold 790,000 copies between January 2000 and August 2006.\n\n"}

His father was John D. Sweeney, a professor of Medieval English at Seton Hall University who was also an avid musician. His mother, Katharine Sweeney Hayden, is a federal judge. Sweeney's parents divorced after 20 years of marriage. He has an older brother, Gregory Sweeney, who is a musician who works on the TV show \"Kitchen Nightmares.\"\n\nHe grew up in Maplewood and South Orange, New Jersey. He went to Northwestern University later dropping out.\n\nSweeney's high school band Skunk released two albums on Twin/Tone records (\"Last American Virgin\" in 1989 and the posthumous \"Laid\", both out of print). In the nineties he recorded and performed as a singer and guitarist with NYC heavy rock band Chavez, releasing a seven-inch (\"Repeat the Ending\" b/w \"Hack the Sides Away\") two albums (1995's \"Gone Glimmering\" and 1996's \"Ride the Fader\") and one EP (1995\"s \"Pentagram Ring\") on the Matador label. Chavez did several short tours in the United States and Europe between 1994 and 1997. When Chavez slowed down Sweeney filled in on bass guitar for Guided By Voices on the \"Under the Bushes, Under the Stars\" tour. He also provided vocals on the song \"Quicksilver\" on Guided By Voices leader Robert Pollard's first solo album \"Not In My Airforce\" LP. The late '90s found him continuing to work a day job and touring with Bonnie 'Prince' Billy as a guitarist.\n\nSweeney's work has taken him across a variety of musical genres. Starting in 2000 he turned up on Cat Power's \"The Covers Record\", playing guitar on \"Salty Dog\", and a couple of Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy singles (percussion on \"A Whorehouse is Any House\" and guitar and vocals on \"Little Boy Blue\"). In 2001 he started playing and writing with Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin in what was to become Zwan. He collaborated with Billy Corgan on the soundtrack to the movie \"Spun\", singing the movie's opening song, a cover of Iron Maiden\"s \"Number of the Beast\". He was also featured as a guitarist and backing vocalist on Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy's \"Ease Down The Road\" album. He lent a helping hand to Dave Grohl in assembling the all-star heavy metal album Probot, tracking down the legendary singers and providing some guitar work (the Probot album was not released until 2004, on Southern Lord records). Sweeney recorded and toured with Zwan from late 2001-2003. He is credited as providing guitar, vocal, and some songwriting on Zwan's album \"Mary Star of the Sea\".\n\nAfter Zwan's breakup, Sweeney played guitar with Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy for several tours in 2004. January 2005 saw the release of their collaboration \"Superwolf\" on Drag City. Sweeney and Bonnie toured behind the Superwolf record in the U.S. and Europe. 2005 also saw Sweeney producing Brooklyn, NY heavy metal band Early Man's debut album, \"Closing In\". The following year found Sweeney working in both the country music and hip-hop scenes, providing guitar work, along with Mike Campbell and Smokey Hormel on the Johnny Cash album, \"\" and appearing with Yo La Tengo bass player James McNew and Def Jux founder El-P, as guest artists on the first track of rapper Cage's album \"Hell's Winter\". He also played guitar on the Dixie Chicks \"Taking the Long Way\" album. In addition, he became a member of apocalyptic Christian folk legends Current 93 touring group, playing shows in Europe in support of the \"Black Ships Ate The Sky\" album. He also recorded with long-time friend Andrew W.K. for W.K.'s \"Close Calls With Brick Walls\" album.\n\nIn 2007 Sweeney again collaborated with El-P, this time alongside Omar Rodríguez-López and Cedric Bixler-Zavala of Mars Volta, on El-P's 2007 album, \"I'll Sleep When You're Dead\".\n\nIn early 2009 Sweeney formed The Brill Sisters with Andrew W.K. and producer Don Fleming. They played their first show (without Fleming) at Santos Party House on April 2, 2009. The entire group performed on April 21.\n\nIn 2016, Sweeney toured with Iggy Pop, Josh Homme as well as Matt Helders to support their album \"Post Pop Depression\".\n\nSweeney produced Dax Riggs' album \"We Sing of Only Blood or Love\" in 2007 for Fat Possum records.\nIn late 2007, along with Bonnie 'Prince\" Billy, Sweeney produced Baby Dee's debut album for Drag City Records, \"Safe Inside the Day\". The album was released in January 2008.\n\n2008 saw Sweeney on a European tour with Current 93 and Baby Dee. Sweeney is also credited for \"wry guitar licks\" on an album for NYC heavy blues rockers Endless Boogie, called \"Focus Level.\" It is rumored he produced the album as well. He also turned up on the Six Organs of Admittance's LP \"Shelter from the Ash\". In addition, Sweeney has songwriting credit on certain pressings of Cat Power's \"Jukebox\" album, for \"Song to Bobby.\" He is also credited as an additional guitarist on that album.\n\nIn tune with his many collaborations, an unlikely combination of Sweeney and Neil Diamond was proposed by seminal producer Rick Rubin in 2008 to follow up Diamond's Rubin-produced 2005 album \"12 Songs\". The 2008 album \"Home Before Dark\", released on the 12th of May, features Sweeney on all songs.\n\nSweeney also plays guitar on Kid Rock's 2010 album \"Born Free\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1868741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868741", "title": "Ron Luciano", "text": "Ron Luciano\n\nRonald Michael Luciano (June 28, 1937 – January 18, 1995) was an American Major League Baseball umpire from 1969 to 1979 in the American League. He was known for his flamboyant style, clever aphorisms, and a series of published collections of anecdotes from his colorful career.\n\nLuciano was born in Endicott, New York, a suburb of Binghamton near the Pennsylvania border, and lived his entire life there. The 6-foot-4, 260-pound Luciano was a standout offensive and defensive tackle at Syracuse University, where he majored in mathematics. He played in the 1957 Cotton Bowl and was named to the 1958 College Football All-America Team. In 1959, he played on the Orangemen's national championship squad with future Heisman Trophy winner Ernie Davis. The Baltimore Colts selected him as an offensive tackle in the third round of the 1959 NFL Draft, and immediately traded him to the Detroit Lions; but he suffered a serious shoulder injury in the College All-Star Game, and never played for the Lions. He was traded in 1960 to the Minnesota Vikings, who released him at the end of the season. The AFL Buffalo Bills picked him up in 1961, but a knee injury forced his retirement after only two games.\n\nLuciano began umpiring in the Class A Florida State League in 1964. He was promoted to the Double-A Eastern League in 1965 and the Triple-A International League in 1967. In 1969, he became a Major League umpire, in the American League, and remained so until his retirement just before the 1980 regular season. \n\nAs an umpire he was known for his flamboyant calls, particularly his habit of \"shooting out\" players. \"My personal record is 16 shots; Bill Haller counted them,\" he wrote. \"I started screaming my calls and leaping in the air, making an attraction out of myself. The fans loved it. Naturally, the League officials hated it.\" For all his antics, his skills were respected by the players: In a 1974 Major League Baseball Players Association poll, Luciano was one of only two American League umpires rated \"excellent.\"\n\nIn addition to making theatrical events of routine outs, he was considered an \"individualist\" who played fast and loose with the league's rules of conduct. For example, rather than working from behind second base as mandated by the American League, he would frequently stand between the pitcher and the base, National League-style. He refused to call balks, insisting that the official definition was too vague to permit consistent enforcement. \"I never called a balk in my life,\" he wrote. \"I didn't understand the rule.\" He once congratulated Oakland infielder Sal Bando as he rounded the bases after hitting a home run to end a long slump. \"The third baseman was looking at me as if I were slightly out of my mind,\" he wrote. \"But before he could say a word, I said firmly, 'It's okay. We're Italian.' \" In 1973 during spring training, he switched positions and hats with Buddy Bell, playing a portion of an inning at third base while Bell umpired. (Both were reprimanded by the League.) \n\nLuciano would routinely converse with players during between-inning breaks and even during play, a practice strictly forbidden by the League. While behind the plate, he would often chat with batters. In his first memoir, he recalled a situation involving future Hall of Fame outfielder Carl Yastrzemski:\n\nHe later admitted that \"on bad days following good nights\"—when a hangover hampered his ability to call pitches accurately—he would sometimes allow trusted catchers, such as Elrod Hendricks, Ed Herrmann, or John Roseboro, to umpire for him:\n\nLuciano's antics amused players and fans, but earned him frequent reprimands from the League office:\n\nLeague President Joe Cronin sent Luciano a registered letter the next day, chiding him for \"conduct unbecoming of a major league umpire\".\n\nLuciano was a member of the 1974 World Series umpire crew, but did not work the plate; the Oakland Athletics closed out the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games. Other extra-season duties included the 1971, 1975, and 1978 American League Championship Series and the 1973 All-Star Game. He was the home plate umpire for Nolan Ryan's second no-hitter in Detroit on July 15, 1973. \n\nLuciano served two full terms as president of the Major League Umpires Association, and was one of its principal leaders and spokesmen during the 1979 umpires strike. \"The umpires have kept this game honest for 100 years,\" he explained to a reporter, in 1978. \"We're the only segment of the game that has never been touched by scandal. We gotta be too dumb to cheat. We must have integrity, because we sure don't have a normal family life. We certainly aren't properly paid. We have no health care, no job security, no tenure. Our pension plan is a joke. We take more abuse than any living group of humans, and can't give back any. If we're fired without notice, our only recourse is to appeal to the league president. And he's the guy that fires you. That's gotta be unconstitutional!\"\n\nLuciano was also known for a long-running feud with Orioles manager Earl Weaver, whose career closely paralleled Luciano's. The two men first met in Double-A during a four-game series in Reading, Pennsylvania in 1965; Weaver was managing the Elmira Pioneers. Luciano ejected Weaver from all four games, with the last ejection coming during the pre-game lineup exchange. After an argument with Luciano during a 1967 Triple-A game, Weaver literally stole second base, taking it to his dugout and refusing to give it back. In the majors, Luciano once ejected Weaver from both games of a doubleheader; the second ejection came, once again, before any pitches had been thrown. \"The problem with Earl is that he holds a grudge,\" he said. \"Other managers, if they disagree with a call, may holler and shout, but you can still go out for a beer with them after the game. Not Earl. He never forgets. Heck, he even holds your minor league record against you. Once, a couple of years ago, I made a controversial call at the plate. Earl charged out of the dugout, screaming that that was the same call I'd blown at Elmira in '66. That sort of thing can get to you.\"\n\nLuciano ejected Weaver so often that Orioles players reportedly placed bets on the inning in which their skipper would be removed. The friction became so intense that for an entire year, Luciano was transferred whenever his umpiring crew was scheduled to work an Orioles series. In the third inning of Luciano's first Orioles game a year later (August 26, 1979 at Chicago's Comiskey Park), he ejected Weaver — who in turn publicly questioned Luciano's \"integrity\" and received a three-game suspension. Eventually, each admitted a grudging respect for the other. Weaver said Luciano was \"one of the few umpires people have paid their way into the park to see.\" Of Weaver, Luciano wrote, \"It's impossible for me not to admire him, but it's pretty hard for me to like him.\"\n\nLuciano married Polly Dixon, an airline flight attendant from Chicago, in 1974. During the baseball season they saw very little of each other, and during the off-season they could not agree on where to live: she did not want to move to upstate New York, and he did not want to live in Chicago. They had no children and divorced after less than two years. \"I once went four months—from March 3 to June 28—without seeing my wife,\" he said. \"I remember the dates because, on June 29, we decided to get a divorce.\"\n\nLuciano was an enthusiastic amateur ornithologist and an avid reader. \"I don't understand Shakespeare's sonnets at all, but I follow his tragedies,\" he said. \"I like the mean characters, people like Macbeth's wife. Hey, you've got to be a masochist to be an umpire, right?\"\n\nAfter his retirement in 1980, Luciano spent two seasons partnered with Merle Harmon as a color commentator on NBC's \"Game of the Week\"; but he became best known as the author of five books—\"The Umpire Strikes Back\", \"Strike Two\", \"The Fall of the Roman Umpire\", \"Remembrance of Swings Past\" and \"Baseball Lite\"— compilations of humorous anecdotes and reminiscences from his umpiring days. He also became a popular speaker on the banquet circuit. \n\nIn 1982 he auditioned for the role of Coach Ernie Pantusso in hit TV show \"Cheers\", but producers \"wanted an experienced actor\". The part eventually went to Nicholas Colasanto.\n\nIn January 1995 Luciano was found dead at age 57 in his garage at his home in Endicott, a victim of suicide via carbon monoxide poisoning. He reportedly suffered from depression for many years, and he was hospitalized for its treatment in early 1994. He is buried at the Calvary Cemetery in Johnson City, New York.\n\n\n\n"}

He served as Attorney-General of Pennsylvania and United States Postmaster General during the presidency of Franklin Pierce.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, his father was Anthony Campbell, and his grandfather was George Campbell, a native of Fintona, County Tyrone, Ireland. James was educated at the private school of Geraldus Stockdale, studied law with Hon. Robert D. Ingraham, and was admitted to the Bar on September 14, 1833. He was made a commissioner of the district of Southwark the day after his admission, and served until his appointment to the board of education. He offered on April 16, 1840, the resolution which established the Girls' High School of Philadelphia.\n\nHe served on the board of education until 1840, when he was appointed, by Governor David R. Porter, judge of the courts of common pleas, orphan's court, and courts of oyer and terminer, which position he filled until January 1, 1851, when the judicial positions in Pennsylvania became elective.\n\nAfter the state's constitution was amended in 1850 to allow elected judges, he was nominated for the Supreme Court, at a period when Know-Nothingism and anti-Catholic feeling was rife. More than two-thirds of the party's state convention ratified the choice to nominate him, but he lost his election 179,238 to 176,101, although his four colleagues on the Democratic ticket were elected. James Buchanan remarked to a friend in Pennsylvania, \"It would be a sad affair for the party, should Campbell fail & the remainder of the Judicial ticket be elected. He is the first Catholic, I believe, who has ever been upon a ticket for a State office & he is worthy & well qualified. Should he fail, this will be attributed to his religious faith; of course, [this would] very naturally exasperate the Catholic democrats. I hope our friends every where will bear this in mind. You exercise a potent influence & can do much to prevent such a catastrophe.\"\n\nGovernor William Bigler appointed him Attorney-General of Pennsylvania, in which office he served until March 4, 1853, when he entered President Pierce's Cabinet as Postmaster-General, serving until March 4, 1857. Campbell's Cabinet service was a reward to the faction of the Democratic Party that supported James Buchanan in the 1852 presidential nomination convention. Furthermore, as a Catholic, Campbell's nomination helped Pierce reach out to new voters from Ireland.\n\nIn 1861 he was a candidate for the United States Senate against Charles R. Buckalew but was defeated by one vote in the state legislature, which at the time elected Senators. In 1873 he was elected a member of the Constitutional Convention of Pennsylvania, but declined to serve, owing to the condition of his health.\n\nFor twenty-five years he was president of the board of trustees of Jefferson Medical College, and for forty-five years was vice-president of Saint Joseph's Orphan Asylum (the oldest incorporated Roman Catholic asylum in the United States, chartered in 1807.)\n\nOn September 3, 1869, he was appointed by the judges of Philadelphia County a member of the board of city trusts, which has under its care 42 city trusts, including Girard College and Wills Eye Hospital. He served in these positions until his death.\n\nJudge Campbell looked upon his obligations, whether as public official or as trustee, as duties of the highest order and of great value to society, and he was a just and severe judge upon himself as to the manner and the faithfulness with which these duties were discharged. Even with all the cares that surrounded him, he was always ready to respond to the slightest call from any of the refuges of the poor and the ill. He made visits almost daily to St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum, to Girard College, and to the hospital, examining conditions in detail, and considering them with as much care as if they referred to his own life or to the lives of those of his own household.\n\nCampbell died in Philadelphia. Prior to his death, Campbell had been the last surviving member of the Pierce Cabinet.\n\nIn 1959 Allegheny Square Park in the Port Richmond section of Philadelphia was renamed Campbell Square in his honor.

The polar capsule is constructed of a proteinaceous and a polysaccharide layer, both layers of which continue into the polar filament.\n\nThe mouth of the capsule is covered with a cap-like structure. This structure may function as a stopper, its digestion in the alimentary tract possibly triggering the discharge of the polar filaments.\n\nTwo ideas have been proposed to explain the eversion of the polar filaments. Firstly, that the hydrostatic pressure in the polar capsule pushes the filament out, rather like the cnidocyst of jellyfish. The second is that extrusion is an active process involving contractile proteins and is calcium-dependent (Uspenskaya, 1982).\n\n"}

Vito then went on to work in the USWA and WWC using the name Skull Von Krush. LoGrasso holds a rare one-on-one pin against Mitsuharu Misawa. He also teamed with \"The Great\" Genichiro Tenryu.\n\nHe returned to the states in 1991 and became enhancement talent in the WWF. He wrestled on early editions of \"WWF Monday Night Raw\" as Von Krus, a german wrestler with an \"evil foreigner\" gimmick.\n\n1994 Vito debuted in USWA as Skull Von Krush managed by Lee Womack. He feuded with Brian Christopher, Spell Binder, and Jeff Gaylord. On March 7, 1994 Memphis Memories show. Vito, as Skull Von Krush, teamed with Danny Davis & Ken Wayne in a six-man tag match at a USWA show in Memphis to defeat the team of Jeff Gaylord, King Cobra & Spellbinder. He also later attacked Jerry Lawler.\n\nAfter a lot of success in those promotions, Vito met up with extreme wrestler Tazz at Johnny Rodz training school, who was able to get him a try out in ECW. When he started in ECW, he was still using the name Skull Von Krush. He later changed his name to Vito \"The Skull\" LoGrasso and became a member of \"Da Baldies\" stable, who in the storyline, claimed to be an offshoot of a real life New York street gang, and as such took issue with New Jack calling himself a \"Gangsta\" and began a feud with him. Vito worked a couple of shows with the now defunct LIWF with Billy Alaimo and was on the Junkyard Dog memorial show in a casket match at The Elks Lodge in Queens, New York.\n\nOn the November 19, 1999 edition of \"ECW Wrestling on TNN\", LoGrasso was pinned in a tag team match where the loser of the fall was forced to leave the company as he was already signed to WCW.\n\nIn 1999 Vito left ECW for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) where he teamed with Johnny the Bull as The Mamalukes. Managed by Tony Marinara The Mamalukes captured the WCW World Tag Team Championship twice, and were, in storyline, jointly awarded the WCW Hardcore Championship. After being awarded the championship, however, Vito and Johnny were forced to face each other in a match to crown one champion, which Vito won.\n\nIn WCW, Vito was billed from Staten Island, New York, which is where he actually grew up.\n\nIn December 2000, the Mamalukes reunited and teamed together until March 2001, when WCW was acquired by the WWF. After the acquisition, Vito was one of the wrestlers who was lost in the shuffle, neither becoming a part of The Invasion nor taking one of the large ticket buyouts offered.\n\nVito also had a brief run in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in late-2004 with Glenn Gilbertti, Trinity and Johnny Swinger as the \"New York Connection\". His only feud was with \"Irish\" Pat Kenney, in which they exchanged victories.\n\nIn early 2005, Vito worked in various dark matches with Val Venis before signing a contract with WWE in June.\n\nOn the August 6, 2005 episode of \"WWE Velocity\", Vito made his WWE debut, where he helped Nunzio win the WWE Cruiserweight Championship from Paul London. Vito and Nunzio would then reform as The Full Blooded Italians, wrestling in various tag team matches. After a brief feud with Gregory Helms, in March 2006, Vito and Nunzio would turn heel, after Vito announced he wanted to be recognized as a \"Godfather\".\n\nBeginning in May, wrestlers such as Orlando Jordan and Paul Burchill would approach Nunzio, spreading rumours that they had seen Vito in public places in various forms of cross-dress. On the June 2, 2006, episode of \"WWE SmackDown\", after Nunzio was defeated by Matt Hardy, Vito, wearing a dress, came out to help Nunzio backstage. The following week on \"SmackDown\", after arguing about Vito's clothing choices, the two had a match against each other, where Vito defeated Nunzio. Shortly after, Nunzio joined the ECW brand, leaving Vito on SmackDown, officially disbanding the team.\n\nDespite him cross dressing, Vito would continue to explain that he was a straight man; as on the June 23 episode of \"SmackDown\", Vito asked Ashley Massaro out on a date, which she agreed to. Vito would then begin to \"have more fun\" during his matches, running around and waving his dresses and otherwise interacting with the fans, turning him once again face. During this time, Montel Vontavious Porter and William Regal, as well as \"SmackDown\" color commentator JBL, began to voice their problems with a man wrestling in a dress. Both MVP and Regal threatened General Manager Theodore Long with a sexual harassment lawsuit to get out of a match with Vito. At the same time, WWE began to \"censor\" any incidents of Vito's dress raising and exposing his (bethonged) buttocks. Vito then began an undefeated streak, which would last over four months until the October 21 episode of \"SmackDown\", when Vito was defeated by Elijah Burke after interference from his partner Sylvester Terkay. On the November 3 episode of \"SmackDown\", Vito teamed with Layla in a losing effort against The Miz and Kristal.\n\nOn May 15, 2007, Vito was released from his WWE contract.\n\nOn January 25, 2007, Vito would win the Deep South Heavyweight Championship after defeating former champion Bradley Jay and Ryan O'Reilly in a three-way round robin match. After his title win, Vito would then undergo a gimmick change into a martial arts character, as he began wearing kickboxing-style trunks, a \"hachimaki\" headband, and wrestling without shoes, with Vito later explaining that the only reason he won matches was because his opponents were claiming that him wearing a dress was a distraction. Vito would briefly return in his new gimmick when he appeared as a lumberjack on the episode of \"WWE Heat\" before WrestleMania 23, in a tag team match between Carlito and Ric Flair against Chavo Guerrero and Gregory Helms. On February 22, Vito re-lost the title to Jay.\n\nVito continued to travel the world; performing in the UK, France, Italy, Malta, Nepal, and Canada, as well as wrestling in the US for ISPW, ACPW, ACW, PWX, DTW, and Wrestling for a Cause in 2009, 2010, and 2011.\n\nHe has also wrestled on various tours of Europe with Irish Whip Wrestling.\n\nFebruary 24, 2011, He returned to defeat the Himalayan Tiger in Kathmandu, Nepal for the Golden Cine Professional Wrestling Show held at the Dasharath Stadium in front of 20,000 people, to become the first ever Profession Wrestling Champion of Nepal.\nOn March 1, 2011 Vito presence was requested by the US Embassy of Nepal. He was greeted and congratulated by the councilor of public affairs of US embassy to Nepal, Terry J. White and staff.\n\nMarch 2, 2013 Vito made an appearance in Canada for the ECW Hardcore Roadtrip teaming with Nunzio against Pitbull Gary Wolfe and Balls. He also faced Al Snow earlier on the card as Skull Von Krush.\n\nAugust 2013 Vito opened a wrestling school in Clearwater, Fl and launched a website BigVito.com\n\nOn September 19, 2013, Vito appeared in Ring Warriors as the leader of the stable The Slambinos.\n\nOn September 18, 2013, LoGrasso's wrestling school announced a partnership with Dragon Gate USA wrestling as a farm system.\nIn mid-2014, Vito retired from in-ring competition.\nVito again appeared with the Ring Warriors in April 2015 as the manager of the Slambinos.\n\nLograsso had a minor role as Bodo in the science fiction film \"The Survivor\". He had a leading role in the 2014 horror thriller film \"The Church\", alongside Clint Howard, Bill Moseley, Lisa Wilcox and Ashley C. Williams. He is also set in the role of Ricardo Lewis in the upcoming action thriller film \"Apnea\", who also will work besides his acting as Stunt coordinator.\n\nVito married former wrestling personality and model Noel Harlow LoGrasso on September 27, 2014. They previously worked together in the US, where she was billed as \"Lil Noel\" as a play on his \"Big Vito\" name.\n\nLograsso began podcasting with Vince Russo's \"The Brand\" on the RELM Network in July 2017. He opened up his own podcast series with his wife Noel and Russo in August 2017.\n\nLograsso (alongside former WWE NXT wrestler Adam Mercer) filed a concussion lawsuit against WWE in January 2015, claiming “serious neurological damage, including severe headaches, memory loss, depression and anxiety, as well as deafness” as a result of WWE run. The lawsuit was dismissed in April 2018.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1868754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868754", "title": "Soldier's Home", "text": "Soldier's Home\n\n\"Soldier's Home\" is a short story by Ernest Hemingway. It was included in the 1925 \"Contact Collection of Contemporary Writers\" and published by Boni & Liveright in Hemingway's 1925 New York collection short stories, \"In Our Time\".\n\nThe story's protagonist is Harold Krebs, a young man who is unhappy after he returns home from serving in World War I.\n\nThe story begins with a very brief background of Krebs' life. Before the war, he attended a Methodist college in Kansas where he was part of a fraternity. In 1917, Krebs enlisted in the Marines and did not return to the United States from Germany until 1919.\n\nBy the time of his return to his home state of Oklahoma, the town has already given the returned soldiers a big, elaborate welcoming; Krebs’ return seems late and irrelevant as the war had already been over for some time. Krebs was involved in the battles at Belleau Wood, Soissons, the Champagne, St. Mihiel, and the Argonne Forest. At first, Krebs did not want to share his experiences, but as time progressed at home, he wanted to talk about the war but no one wanted to listen. Krebs lies about his wartime accounts in order to gain an audience, though he does not want a ton.\n\nBy late summer, Krebs is doing typical things: he sleeps in late, reads books, plays pool and his clarinet, goes for walks and reads. He has no interest getting a girlfriend. He just looks at girls because they are pretty, but he does not want to have to work to get one.\n\nAbout a month after his return, his mother requests that he come downstairs to eat breakfast. While Krebs is eating breakfast he reads the newspaper and talks to Helen. He then agrees that he loves his mother, but without much emotion.\n\nThe conversation ends as his mother comes back into the room and asks to speak with Krebs. His mother says God cannot have any idle hands in his Kingdom. Krebs replies that he is not in His Kingdom. He then feels embarrassed for saying that. Krebs’ mother then tells him that she understands how he feels, and that she is worried about him. She says that her father told her about his own service in the Civil War and that she has been praying for Krebs because she knows how he must feel. She then asks if Krebs loves her, and he says no; she cries. Krebs states that he doesn't love anybody. Krebs then realizes that he won't be able to make her understand and saying that will only hurt her. He says that he did not mean what he said but he does not love anyone anymore. Krebs begs her to believe that he did not mean it and so she prays for him.\n\nThe story concludes with Krebs plotting to leave his hometown and get a job in Kansas.\n\nIn the 1920s, Hemingway was inspired by Ezra Pound's writings and applied the poet's principles of imagism to his own early work. Hemingway's short stories from the 1920s adhere to Pound's tight definition of imagism; biographer Carlos Baker writes that in his short stories Hemingway tried to learn how to \"get the most from the least, [to] prune language, [to] multiply intensities, [to] tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth\". Hemingway adapted this style into a technique he called his iceberg theory: as Baker describes it, the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight.\n\nThe story takes place in Krebs’ hometown in Oklahoma around the early 1920s after World War I. The town is the same, while Krebs himself has changed. His home is where he reflects on things that have changed him, like watching the girls and not wanting to get one, and telling his mother he does not love her.\n\nThere are many symbols used throughout the story. Harold Krebs' name itself is a symbol. Harold \"is an old English name meaning army power or army ruler.\" Krebs also had German ties to the word crab, which is a metaphor for Krebs’ crab-like shell he has obtained from his experiences (Ullrich What's).\n\nThe way that Harold has changed represents how America has been changed from the war. His values were changed now, like how America has been challenged from changing values to more modern times (Smelstor Soldier's).\n\nKrebs’ home plays a large role in the story as well. On his porch, Krebs sits and observes the women of his town, much like how trenches in warfare allow a vantage point to observe enemy's movements. Here, Krebs' home is represented in a such a way that can be related to Krebs’ wartime experiences.\n\nThe map is another symbol. Krebs is reading a book about the war but he wished it had many more detailed maps. This symbolizes how now he is searching for direction in his own life, how he wishes his life would be mapped out. For the past two years he has been in the army listening to directions, now he is free and does not know what to do.\n\nA final symbol is the photograph in the beginning of the story. It describes Krebs and his fraternity brothers all of whom were wearing exactly the same thing. This shows \"the conformist mentality of prewar, midwestern America\" (Smelstor What's).\n\n\"Soldier's Home\" was adapted to a PBS television movie in 1977.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1868762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868762", "title": "Dale Torborg", "text": "Dale Torborg\n\nDale Christian Torborg (born October 24, 1971) is an American baseball trainer and former professional wrestler. He is the son of former Major League Baseball manager Jeff Torborg. He is currently the conditioning coordinator for the Chicago White Sox.\n\nTorborg attended Northwestern University, and played college baseball for the Northwestern Wildcats. He played professional baseball after graduating from college. His career began in 1994 with the Kingsport Mets of the Appalachian League. According to Torborg, he suffered two injuries that led to the end of his baseball career. The first occurred when he attempted to pickoff a runner while playing first base. Torborg broke his humerus bone when his arm was tangled with the base runner's arm. Torborg's final injury, which proved to be career ending, occurred when took a fastball to the face which broke his zygomatic bone and caused a change in his depth perception.\n\nIn 1995 on the way to Los Angeles, Torborg met Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage. The two of them spoke with him about going into pro wrestling. Torborg was trained by The Warlord and Jim Neidhart and debuted in 1998. He debuted in WCW and was said to have been a member of the WCW Pit Crew and was training in the WCW Power Plant.\n\nIn 1995, he then worked for the American Wrestling Federation as The MVP, a baseball player character. After the AWF closed he was employed by World Championship Wrestling and was sent to the Power Plant to train. Some of the wrestlers in the Power Plant at that time were Bill Goldberg, Lodi, Chuck Palumbo, Mark Jindrak, Jimmy Yang, Evan Karagias, Shane Helms, Allan Funk, Christie Wolf, Ron Reis and many more future superstars. In 1998, he started to get a push as the MVP but after two matches as the MVP, he was asked to portray a character named The Demon. WCW head Eric Bischoff struck a deal with the rock band Kiss to create a Kiss-themed wrestler, \"The Demon\", a gimmick modeled on the stage persona of Gene Simmons. Torborg originally was told he was the Demon and was abruptly taken out due to Brian Adams having much more experience in the ring. Adams admitted to never feeling comfortable as the character. The gimmick was played twice by Brian Adams, rejected by him without wrestling a single match, and given to Torborg. He was managed by Asya (Christi Wolf), whom he later married.\n\nThe \"Demon\" character was originally supposed to be the beginning of a stable called The Warriors of KISS, in which the other original members of the band would have a wrestler representing their look and gimmick. KISS was guaranteed their \"Demon\" themed wrestler would wrestle a Main Event match with the contract they made with WCW. This was supposed to happen at a special 1999 New Year's Eve PPV against Vampiro. The PPV and the match were taken off the table, however, after Eric Bischoff lost his position in September 1999. In order to fulfill the contractual obligation, he was booked in a \"Special Main Event\" match at Superbrawl in early 2000. Uncharacteristic to \"Main Event\" matches, it was the fourth match on the card and saw Torborg face The Wall which saw The Wall win with a chokeslam. Because Bischoff lost his position before the character's wrestling debut, The Demon character got off to a rocky start, losing to Terry Funk in its debut. Bookers at the time wanted to make Eric Bischoff look bad. Torborg contends that the character was hurt because the KISS concert to debut The Demon was one of the lowest rated segments in the history of \"WCW Nitro\" up to that point and even though Bischoff believed in the character, others believed it was dead on arrival.\n\nAfterwards, he was known simply as \"The Demon\" and placed in a stable with Vampiro and the Insane Clown Posse called The Dark Carnival. He later turned against the group and feuded with Vampiro. When WCW was bought out by the then-World Wrestling Federation in 2001, Torborg opted to go back to baseball as a strength coach and not do his scheduled tryout for the WWE.\n\nTorborg appeared with White Sox catcher A. J. Pierzynski on an episode of \"TNA Impact!\" on December 8, 2005. Along with veteran wrestling manager and color commentator Bobby Heenan. Torborg and Pierzynski presented A.J. Styles, Chris Sabin and Sonjay Dutt with memorabilia from the 2005 World Series until they were interrupted by The Diamonds in the Rough. Simon Diamond, the leader of the Diamonds and himself a former baseball player, mocked Pierzynski's .256 batting average, telling him that he needed a designated hitter. Diamond then slapped Torborg, leading to a brawl. As a result, Torborg, Sabin and Dutt, with Pierzynski in their corner, faced the Diamonds at Turning Point 2005 on December 11. At Turning Point, Dutt pinned Diamond following interference from then-Boston Red Sox outfielder Johnny Damon.\n\nOn the January 18, 2007 edition of \"iMPACT!\", Pierzynski and Torborg attacked Lance Hoyt, helping James Storm win, who was also aided by Miss Tennessee. At Against All Odds 2007 Torborg, with Pierzynski in his corner, was defeated by Hoyt, who had David Eckstein in his corner. Torborg and Pierzynski's appearance were some of the highest rated episodes for TNA.\n\nWhen WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation in March 2001, Torborg left wrestling and joined the Montreal Expos as a coach. His duties with the Expos included strength and conditioning coaching, assisting with infield drills and batting practice pitcher. At the time his father, Jeff Torborg, was the manager of the Expos.\n\nTorborg later served as the strength and conditioning coach for the Florida Marlins during his father's tenure as manager from 2002 to 2003. He made news when he scared Marlins pitcher Antonio Alfonseca into hiding in a trainer's room after Alfonseca swore at him in Spanish while refusing Torborg's request for a weigh-in.\n\nIn January 2004, Dale was hired by the Chicago White Sox baseball team as a roving strength trainer. Torborg has been a part of two World Champion baseball teams: 2003 Marlins and 2005 White Sox.\n\nTorborg had a small role in the film \"Transporter 2\", as well as numerous commercials over his acting career. He also worked with Tom Selleck for the movie \"Mr. Baseball\", as well as with Madonna and Geena Davis for the movie \"A League of their Own\".\n\nTorborg married Christie Wolf on October 5, 2000. He and Christie welcomed their first child, a daughter named Sierra Raye on August 18, 2005.\n\n"}

Tanner is an employee of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) who acts as M's Chief of Staff.\n\nSuperb in a crisis, and blessed with a dry sense of humour, Tanner is Bond's staunchest ally in the Service, and they often enjoy a round of golf when off-duty. A family man, Tanner is just a little envious of Bond's freedom.\n\nIn Ian Fleming's novels, Bill Tanner is MI6's Chief of Staff. He appears infrequently in the novels, but is a regular character in the later continuation series by John Gardner.\n\nIn 1965, Kingsley Amis wrote \"The Book of Bond or Every Man His Own 007\", a tongue-in-cheek manual for prospective secret agents, illustrated with examples from Fleming's novels. For this work, Amis used the pseudonym \"Lt. Colonel William ('Bill') Tanner\".\n\nIn \"The Man with the Golden Gun\", Bill Tanner is only seen briefly in the film and is not mentioned by name until the end credits. He appears in M's office with M and Colthorpe, discussing Francisco Scaramanga, who has sent a bullet to MI6 printed with Bond's ID number. He explains Scaramanga's fingerprints on the bullet were verified by the CIA, and that Scaramanga is attempting to provoke a battle with MI6. This leads to Bond being sent to find Scaramanga.\nIn \"For Your Eyes Only\", Bill Tanner (now played by James Villiers due to Michael Goodliffe's death in 1976) is given a bigger role, as Bernard Lee, who played M, had died. Tanner gives Bond his assignment (along with Sir Fredrick Gray), which sends him to find Hector Gonzales. Bond is unable to get information from Gonzales later on because Melina Havelock kills him after Bond is captured. Tanner then gets upset at him for not getting any information and letting Melina murder him. Tanner is last seen at the end of the film, when he connects the Prime Minister and Bond by phone. Unknowingly though, Bond is not there and it is merely a talking parrot that ends up \"flirting\" with the Prime Minister. In \"Octopussy\", the role of M was recast with Robert Brown, so Tanner did not appear.\n\nIn \"GoldenEye\", Tanner is only briefly seen in the Situation Room when the GoldenEye weapon is set off. Tanner gets scolded here for calling the new M, \"the Evil Queen of Numbers\" while she is right behind him. As Michael Kitchen was unable to reprise his role for \"Tomorrow Never Dies\", the character of Charles Robinson (played by Colin Salmon), was created in his stead.\n\nIn \"The World Is Not Enough\", Tanner is seen at the Scotland MI6 building debriefing the agents on the murder of Sir Robert King, father of Elektra King. When Bond comes to the conclusion that Renard is behind it, Tanner is seen with them talking about what Renard can do or is planning to do. He is only seen again twice, when Elektra King contacts M to get her to come and see her and finally at the end of the film where R is attempting to find Bond.\n\nTanner had never been considered a regular cinematic character until 2008's \"Quantum of Solace\". He was played by a different actor, Rory Kinnear, giving Judi Dench (who played M) the distinction of having played opposite two different actors playing the role of Tanner. Kinnear is also the godson of Dench's late husband Michael Williams. Kinnear reprised the role of Tanner in \"Skyfall\" and \"Spectre\". Kinnear also voices Tanner and provides his likeness for the 2010 remake of the \"GoldenEye\" game and the original games \"\" and \"007 Legends\".\n"}

She was a great-great-great-granddaughter of King George III, a great-granddaughter of the 1st Duke of Westminster and a niece of the Duchess of Beaufort. Her father was a nephew of the Earl of Athlone and of Queen Mary, the consort to King George V, making her a second cousin to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nLord and Lady Eltham lived on the edge of Hyde Park, London, near Lord Eltham's cousin and his wife, the Duke and Duchess of York. The young Lady Mary was educated at home under the supervision of her grandmother, nanny, and governess. During her free time, Mary would play with her friends. Often she would be invited to play with her second cousins (they shared great-grandparents, Francis of Teck and his wife Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge), the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret of York, who lived near her by Hyde Park (specifically at 145 Piccadilly). When they were in London she would also play with George and Gerald Lascelles, the children of the Princess Royal, who were her second cousins. On 29 November 1934, she was a bridesmaid at the marriage of the Duke of Kent to Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark.\n\nWhen not in London and for the duration of the London Blitz, the Cambridges sent Lady Mary to stay with her maternal grandparents, Captain the Hon. Osmond Westenra Hastings (1873–1933) and his wife Mary Caroline Campbell Tarratt (died 1955), at Hodcott House, their country house near West Ilsley in Berkshire. Near her were her cousins the Yorks and Harewoods, who were staying at Windsor Castle. Her parents remained in London, as her father was a director of Coutts & Company, a banking firm, in the city. When Mary was older, toward the end of the war, she became a volunteer nurse in the blitzed area of London.\n\nOn 9 November 1951 at Kirtling, Newmarket, Lady Mary married Peter Whitley (22 October 1923 Singapore-25 January 2003) of Leighland House, Roadwater, Watchet, Somerset, a son of Sir Norman Henry Pownall Whitley KCB, MC.\n\nAfter their marriage, the couple was given the Lord Cambridge's London townhouse in St. James's Square. Peter pursued a career with Distillers Company and became a managing director before his retirement in 1985. The couple had two children:\n\n\nLady Mary regularly attended major royal occasions, but like her father, she did not carry out royal duties. Mary was a junior bridesmaid at the 1934 wedding of her father's first cousin, Prince George, Duke of Kent to Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark in 19 . On 20 November 1947, she was also a bridesmaid at the wedding of Princess Elizabeth to Philip Mountbatten. She participated in the coronations of both King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II and attended the Trooping the Colour every year between 1950 and 1999 (excluding 1955, when it was cancelled due to a rail strike).\n\nShe attended the following royal marriages: Princess Margaret to Antony Armstrong-Jones, created 1st Earl of Snowdon (1960); the Prince of Wales to Lady Diana Spencer (1981); Anne, Princess Royal, to Captain Mark Phillips (1973) and Princess Anne's subsequent marriage to Commander Timothy Laurence (1992); Prince Andrew, Duke of York, to Sarah Ferguson (1986).\n\n\n"}

This was the last show to use dialogue by Bergman, who died by suicide shortly after production was completed.\n\nAn alien lands on Earth to make first contact in the African desert. Not realizing it is facing lions, it is killed and devoured. Its ship is discovered by the people from Starvin' Marvin's village. The village is occupied by Christian missionaries led by Sister Hollis (voiced by Michael Ann Young), who attempt to convert the community by assuring them that their faith in Christianity will get them food, prompting Marvin to board the ship in search of a place free of missionaries to relocate his people. Meanwhile, two agents with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), having found out about this spaceship and wanting it for themselves, track down the boys and torture them by making scraping noises on a balloon until Cartman suddenly cannot take it anymore and tells them where Starvin' Marvin might have taken it. The two government agents then recruit Sally Struthers, whose character is depicted as looking similar to Jabba the Hutt. She is the leader of an Ethiopian food drive that is nothing more than a front for her to get all the food she wants. They offer her Chocolate Yum Yum bars in exchange.\n\nMarvin and the boys team up, and by accidentally pressing a button, they fly via a wormhole to the home planet of the ship's owner: the planet Marklar, whose inhabitants speak a language that is identical to English except for the fact that every noun is replaced with the word \"Marklar\". The benevolent Marklar agree to allow the Ethiopians to live on their planet. Back on Earth, the boys try to round up the Ethiopians, but the government agents seize the spaceship. The boys are able to take back the spaceship, letting Marvin load his people on while the boys distract the government agents, pretending to be Tom Brokaw. The agents are easily able to see through the disguise. Despite this, they are distracted long enough to load the ship, but Kenny is lost and seized by the government agents when the boys try to make a break for it.\n\nThe boys try to make it to Marklar, but they are confronted by the missionaries, who have built their own ship and are trying to force Christianity to Marklar. During this time, while broadcasting his show \"The 600 Club\" on the Christian Broadcasting Channel, Pat Robertson is shown attempting to raise funds for various absurd weapons and upgrades to aid the missionaries while in space. A space battle ensues, before the boys have to face the government agents. The agents have had Kenny frozen in carbonite and given to Struthers so she can support them. Cartman convinces Struthers that she has influenced the boys that they need to help people more. This touches Struthers, so she lets the boys go and captures the missionary ship instead. Then, the wormhole is opened again, and all ships are taken to Marklar.\n\nWhen they arrive on Marklar, the aliens are very confused by the humans' attempts to explain their motives. Kyle explains the situation in the aliens' own language, and the Marklar are moved. They banish the missionaries and let the Ethiopians stay. The boys promise to visit again (with Cartman sarcastically adding \"Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President!\"). Struthers then takes the boys back to Earth.\n\nThe depiction of Pat Robertson and the 700 club is used as an example of South Park episodes that lampoon the religious right.\n\nThis is the first time that South Park did a cold open with no credits. On the DVD commentary, Parker and Stone refer to this as the first episode of \"Starvin' Marvin in Space\" instead of a \"South Park\" episode.\n\n"}

Hartley developed his painting abilities by observing Cubists in Paris and Berlin.\n\nHartley was born in Lewiston, Maine, where his English parents had settled. He was the youngest of nine children. His mother died when he was eight, and his father remarried four years later to Martha Marsden. His birth name was Edmund Hartley; he later assumed Marsden as his first name when he was in his early 20s. A few years after his mother's death when Hartley was 14, his family moved to Ohio, leaving him behind in Maine to work in a shoe factory for a year. These bleak occurrences led Hartley to recall his New England childhood as a time of painful loneliness, so much so that in a letter to Alfred Stieglitz, he once described the New England accent as \"a sad recollection [that] rushed into my very flesh like sharpened knives.\" \n\nAfter he joined his family in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1892, Hartley began his art training at the Cleveland School of Art, where he held a scholarship.\n\nIn 1898, at age 22, Hartley moved to New York City to study painting at the New York School of Art under William Merritt Chase, and then attended the National Academy of Design. Hartley was a great admirer of Albert Pinkham Ryder and visited his studio in Greenwich Village as often as possible. His friendship with Ryder, in addition to the writings of Walt Whitman and American transcendentalists Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, inspired Hartley to view art as a spiritual quest.\n\nHartley moved to an abandoned farm near Lovell, Maine, in 1908. He considered the paintings he produced there his first mature works, and they also impressed New York photographer and art promoter Alfred Stieglitz. Hartley had his first solo exhibition at Stieglitz's 291 in 1909, and exhibited his work there again in 1912. Stieglitz also provided Hartley's introduction to European modernist painters, of whom Cézanne, Picasso, and Matisse would prove the most influential upon him.\n\nHartley first traveled to Europe for the first time in April 1912, and he became acquainted with Gertrude Stein's circle of \"avante-garde\" writers and artists in Paris. Stein, along with Hart Crane and Sherwood Anderson, encouraged Hartley to write as well as paint.\n\nIn a letter to Alfred Stieglitz, Hartley explains his disenchantment of living abroad in Paris. A single year has passed since he began living overseas. \"Like every other human being I have longings which through tricks of circumstances have been left unsatisfied... and the pain grows stronger instead of less and it leaves one nothing but the role of spectator in life watching life go by-having no part of it but that of spectator.\" Hartley wanted to live within the noiseless countryside and an invigorating city.\n\nIn April 1913 Hartley relocated to Berlin, the capital of the German Empire, where he continued to paint and befriended the painters Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc. He also collected Bavarian folk art. His work during this period was a combination of abstraction and German Expressionism, fueled by his personal brand of mysticism. Many of Hartley's Berlin paintings were further inspired by the German military pageantry then on display, though his view of this subject changed after the outbreak of World War I, once war was no longer \"a romantic but a real reality.\" The earliest of his Berlin paintings were shown in the landmark 1913 Armory Show in New York.\n\nIn Berlin, Hartley developed a close relationship with a Prussian lieutenant, Karl von Freyburg, who was the cousin of Hartley's friend Arnold Ronnebeck. References to Freyburg were a recurring motif in Hartley's work, most notably in \"Portrait of a German Officer\" (1914). Freyburg's subsequent death during the war hit Hartley hard, and he afterward idealized their relationship. Many scholars interpreted his work regarding Freyburg as embodying his homosexual feelings for him. Hartley lived in Berlin until December 1915.\n\nHartley returned to the U.S. from Berlin as a German sympathizer following World War I. Hartley created paintings with much German iconography. The homoerotic tones were overlooked as critics focused on the German point of view. According to Arthur Lubow, Hartley was disingenuous in arguing that there was \"no hidden symbolism whatsoever.\"\n\nHartley finally returned to the U.S. in early 1916. Following World War I Hartley was obligated to return to the United States. Upon his return Hartley painted \"Handsome Drinks\". The drinkware calls back to the gatherings hosted by Gertrude Stein, where Hartley met Pablo Picasso, and Robert Delaunay. \n\nHe lived in Europe again from 1921 to 1930, when he moved back to the U.S. for good. He painted throughout the country, in Massachusetts, New Mexico, California, and New York. He returned to Maine in 1937, after declaring that he wanted to become \"the painter of Maine\" and depict American life at a local level. He continued to paint in Maine, primarily scenes around Lovell and the Corea coast, until his death in Ellsworth in 1943. His ashes were scattered on the Androscoggin River.\n\nTowards the end of his life Hartley fell in love with Alty Mason, a young fisherman. The relationship ended with the passing of Mason. He along with several relatives drowned at sea.\n\nHartley is bashful when it came to his homosexuality, often redirecting attention towards other aspects of his work. Works such as \"Portrait of a German Officer\", and \"Handsome Drinks\" are coded. The compositions honor lovers, friends, and inspirational sources. Hartley no longer felt unease at what people thought of his work once he reached his sixties. Scenes became more intimate from locker rooms to muscular hairy-chested men in what appear to be short trousers . \"Flaming American (Swim Champ)\" of 1940 has no need to decipher the homoerotic undertones. As Hartley's German Officer paintings were misread as being pro-German, these new paintings were misinterpreted as being pro-American.\n\nIn a personal memoir that was not finished, Hartley wrote \"I began somehow to have curiosity about art at the time when sex consciousness is fully developed and as I did not incline to concrete escapades. I of course inclined to abstract ones, and the collecting of objects which is a sex expression took the upper hand.\" Hartley's use of object abstraction became the motif for his paintings that commemorate his \"love object,\" Karl von Freyburg. According to Meryl Doney, Hartley conveyed his emotions regarding his friend's traits in his paintings through everyday items. In this painting the Iron Cross, Flag of Bavaria and German flag are attributes to Karl von Freyburg, along with the yellow '24', the age he was when he died.\n\nIn addition to being considered one of the foremost American painters of the first half of the 20th century, Hartley also wrote poems, essays, and stories. His book \"Twenty-five Poems\" was published by Robert McAlmon in Paris in 1923.\n\n\"Cleophas and His Own: A North Atlantic Tragedy\" is a story based on two periods he spent in 1935 and 1936 with the Mason family in the Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia, fishing community of East Point Island. Hartley, then in his late 50s, found there both an innocent, unrestrained love and the sense of family he had been seeking since his unhappy childhood in Maine. The impact of this experience lasted until his death in 1943 and helped widen the scope of his mature works, which included numerous portrayals of the Masons.\n\nHe wrote of the Masons, \"Five magnificent chapters out of an amazing, human book, these beautiful human beings, loving, tender, strong, courageous, dutiful, kind, so like the salt of the sea, the grit of the earth, the sheer face of the cliff.\" In \"Cleophas and His Own,\" written in Nova Scotia in the fall of 1936 and re-printed in \"Marsden Hartley and Nova Scotia,\" Hartley expresses his immense grief at the tragic drowning of the Mason sons. The independent filmmaker Michael Maglaras has created a feature film \"Cleophas and His Own\", released in 2005, which uses a personal testament by Hartley as its screenplay.\n\nA catalogue raisonné of Hartley's work is underway by art historian Gail Levin, Distinguished Professor at Baruch College, and The Graduate Center of The City University of New York. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1868794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868794", "title": "Sturgis Charter Public School", "text": "Sturgis Charter Public School\n\nThe Sturgis Charter Public School is a dual-campus charter school located in the village of Hyannis, Massachusetts (Town of Barnstable, MA), United States. The school received its charter in February 1998 and opened in September for the 1998-1999 academic year with 162 freshman, 15 faculty and staff, a newly renovated facility, and a $1.2 million budget. The school philosophy is International Baccalaureate for all students.\n\nFor its first six years, the school was known as Sturgis Charter School. In 2004, the Sturgis board changed the school's name to \"Sturgis Charter Public School,\" in keeping with a public relations initiative of the Massachusetts Charter School Association. According to the enabling legislation for Massachusetts charter schools, a \"charter\" school is by statutory definition a public school. Sturgis determined that many people were unaware of this and thus added the term \"Public\" for clarity.\n\nIn 2010, Sturgis decided to open a new campus on West Main Street in Hyannis, only a few blocks from the original campus. However, the campus was not built until 2012, and both schools shared space on Main Street until the new school was constructed. This new campus came to be known as \"Sturgis West\", while the original campus on Main Street in Hyannis came to be known as \"Sturgis East\", basically dividing the Sturgis campus into two separate schools. Both the East & West campuses field their own athletic teams, have their own schools mascots, and their own school colors and compete against each other in all sports offered at both schools. Sturgis East's mascot name is the \"Storm\", and their colors are Navy Blue & White. Sturgis West's mascot name is the \"Navigators\", and their colors are Green & White.\n\nAs of the 2008-09 school year, the school had an enrollment of 367 students and 36.8 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student-teacher ratio of 10.0.\n\nAs a result of the success and popularity of the \"“International Baccalaureate for All”\" program, student admission waiting lists swelled to more than 400 students for the 2011-12 school year. As a result, The Sturgis Board has developed a second campus in Hyannis that replicates the Sturgis mission of IB for All and the vibrant school culture.\n\nThe proposed second campus at 125 West Main Street in Hyannis earned the new school the name Sturgis West. A temporary location for the Sturgis West campus was used for the 2011-12 school year at the former Artifacts Furniture building at 434 Main Street in Hyannis. Construction crews began work in April 2011 so that the facility would be ready in August 2012 for approximately 220 new freshman and sophomore students and approximately 30 staff members. A significant majority of the faculty for the second campus has been recruited from outside of the school—only a few school leaders will come from the original Sturgis faculty.\n\nThe original campus at 427 Main Street has been designated Sturgis East by the administration.\n\nBoth the Sturgis East and Sturgis West campuses have their own athletic teams, school mascot, and school colors and compete against each other in all sports, along with other area high schools. Sturgis East's mascot name is the \"Storm\", and their colors are Navy Blue & White. Sturgis West's mascot name is the \"Navigators\" otherwise known as the Sturgis Gator, and their colors are Green & White.\n\nThe Sturgis Board of Trustees governs the school, and the Executive Director oversees the educational program. Each campus has a Principal.\n\nAs of 2016, the School is listed under the \"gold medal\" list, ranking 33 out of the top 100 high schools in the United States and first in Massachusetts (more than 20,000 public high schools from 50 states and the District of Columbia were analyzed) by \"U.S. News & World Report\" magazine.\n\nIn 2010, \"Newsweek\" magazine ranked Sturgis 29th in the nation in their annual ranking of America's top public high schools. The magazine's ranking was based exclusively on the number of AP and IB tests taken divided by the number of graduating seniors but is currently based on \"six components: graduation rate (25%), college matriculation rate (25%), AP tests taken per graduate (25%), average SAT/ACT scores (10%), average AP/IB/AICE scores (10%), and AP courses offered (5%)\".\n\nIn 2004, the Sturgis Charter Public School became an International Baccalaureate World School, offering the Diploma Program (DP) to students in the 11th and 12th grades, along with an intensive \"pre-IB\" program in the 9th and 10th grades. Sturgis is one of thirteen schools in Massachusetts that offer the IB Diploma Program.\n\nThe IB Diploma program of studies consists of courses taken in six groups (Language A, Language B, Individuals and Societies, Experimental Sciences, Mathematics, and the Arts). Courses are offered at the Higher Level (HL) and Standard Level (SL), for the diploma, a student must complete at least three but no more than four courses at the higher level, with the remainder at the standard level. Diploma candidates also complete a thesis known as the extended essay, a course in philosophy called Theory of Knowledge, as well as participate in CAS (creativity, action, and service) activities. Students who fulfill all these requirements earn the I.B. Diploma, students who are unable to or decide not to complete the diploma earn IB certificates in the courses for which an exam was taken. The IB Diploma is earned by students who choose to pursue it, although all students Sturgis are required to take IB courses and exams during their junior and senior years.\n\nIn North America, many colleges and universities grant credit for higher level courses scored with a sufficient mark (usually a 6 or 7), a smaller number also grant credit for standard level courses. Some institutions, such as Amherst College, Harvard University, and Binghamton University grant sophomore standing to any incoming student who has completed the full diploma.\n\nFor students wishing to study overseas, the I.B. Diploma can assist in making a student eligible to apply directly, especially when the host country's secondary educational system has more stringent requirements than the United States. For example, in the United Kingdom, university bound students are required to complete 15 years of schooling, rather than 13 that is standard in the United States or Canada. Normally, American students are required to first complete an associate degree, or alternatively enroll in a Sixth Form College in the UK (and write the required A Level exams for their programme) prior to attending a British University, however the completion of the I.B. Diploma waives this requirement at most British universities (except Oxford and Cambridge).\n\nIn the last examination session, students completed the following exams: Biology HL, Biology SL, Bus.& Man. SL, Chemistry HL, Chemistry SL, English A1 HL, English A1 SL, Environmental Systems and Societies SL, French Ab. SL, French B HL, French B SL, History HL, History SL, Information Technology in Global Society HL, Information Technology in Global Society SL, Latin HL, Latin SL, Math.Studies SL, Mathematics HL, Mathematics SL, Music HL, Music SL, Physics HL, Physics SL, Psychology SL, Spanish A2 SL, Spanish Ab. SL, Spanish B HL, Spanish B SL, Theatre HL, Theatre SL, Theory Knowl. TK, Visual Arts HL and Visual Arts SL.\n\nA joint Track and Field program was also established between Sturgis East and West back in 2015.\n\n"}

In 2008, he was convicted of mortgage fraud and sentenced to 12–37 years in prison. As of June 27, 2019, Constant was in custody at the Eastern Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison in New York. He was first eligible for parole on June, 30, 2016, but was refused; his next parole hearing eligibility date is in February 2020. He was not among 30 Haitians who were deported from the United States to Haiti on May 26, 2020. If and when he is deported, the government plans to arrest him and give him a new trial.\n\nIn mid-1993, two years after the 1991 Haitian coup d'état, Constant set up paramilitary group known as the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haïti (FRAPH) to terrorize supporters of exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. A CIA source implicated Constant in the 1993 assassination of Justice Minister Guy Malary, although the agency said the source was \"untested\".\n\nConstant was paid by the CIA from 1992 to 1994, as were several leading members of the military junta. He provided information to the agency for about $500 a month, according to United States officials and Mr. Constant himself.\n\nAfter the 1994 U.S. and UN-led multinational occupation restored Aristide to power, Constant escaped to the U.S.. He was detained by INS officials in 1995 and prepared to be deported to Haïti to stand trial for involvement in the Raboteau Massacre. However, in a December 1995 interview with Ed Bradley on \"60 Minutes\", Constant threatened to divulge secrets about his relationship with the CIA during the early '90s. In May 1996, after receiving Constant's threat, and intelligence that there was a plot to assassinate him should he return to Haïti, the Clinton administration ordered the INS to release Constant.\n\nIn 2001, Constant was convicted \"in absentia\" of his role in the Raboteau Massacre and sentenced to life in prison and hard labor.\n\nOn July 7, 2006, Constant appeared in a Long Island, New York county court to face charges that he participated in a mortgage scheme that defrauded Sun Trust Mortgage Bank and Fremont Investment and Loan of more than $1 million. The purported fraud took place while Constant was employed at Melville Brokerage.\n\nOn October 28, 2008, Judge Abraham Gerges of the Kings County Supreme Court sentenced Constant to serve 12–37 years in prison. Judge Gerges concluded his memorandum with a plea that the United States government allow Constant to serve his entire sentence in New York State, rather than return him to Haiti \"where he may evade justice due to the instability of the Haitian judicial system.\" Judge Gerges noted that \"it is apparent that the federal authorities may deport him shortly.\"\n\nIn early May 2020 it was announced that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement was planning to send Constant back to Haiti on a May 12th deportation flight. The Center for Economic and Policy Research obtained a copy of the flight's manifest which included Contant's name and categorized him as a “High Profile Removal\". The planned deportation caused a lot of controversy and was later reprieved.\n\nA new deportation of Constant was planned for May 26, 2020.\n"}

{"id": "1868823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868823", "title": "NWA World Tag Team Championship", "text": "NWA World Tag Team Championship\n\nThe NWA World Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling world tag team championship created by the National Wrestling Alliance. From 1948 to 1982, the NWA allowed member promotions to create their own territorial version of the \"NWA World Tag Team Championship\" without oversight from the board of directors. The first of these NWA World Tag Team Championships was created in 1950 in the San Francisco territory, which while billed as a \"World\" title was essentially restricted to the specific NWA territory. In 1957 as many as 13 versions of the NWA World Tag Team Championship were confirmed to be in existence. In 1982 Big Time Wrestling, based in Los Angeles, closed and abandoned their version of the championship. This meant that only the Jim Crockett Promotions' NWA World Tag Team Championship was active, but still being controlled by JCP, not the NWA board of directors. In 1991 that championship was renamed the WCW World Tag Team Championship.\n\nIn 1992 the NWA board of directors decided to sanction one world-level NWA World Tag Team Championship, working with WCW to hold a tournament to determine the inaugural officially recognized, NWA World Tag Team Championship. In 1993, the NWA and WCW severed their relationship and the NWA took with it the tag team championship. The NWA would briefly allow the World Wrestling Federation to control the championship in 1998 but by 1999 that collaboration ended. In 2002 the NWA gave control of the NWA World Tag Team Championship to the newly formed NWA Total Nonstop Action (NWA-TNA) promotion. TNA's control of the championship ended in 2007, with TNA creating the TNA World Tag Team Championship as a result. In subsequent years the championship has been defended on various continents including a period of time where it was held by several teams working for New Japan Pro-Wrestling.\n\nThe Skullcrushers (Rasche Brown and Keith Walker) held the championship for 777 days, making them the longest reigning champions in the history of the NWA board-recognized championship. Three teams have held the championship for just one day: David Flair and Dan Factor, Glacier and Jason Sugarman, and The Heatseekers (Sigmon and Elliot Russel).\n\nIn 1948 six professional wrestling promoters in the United States joined together to form the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) as a governing body for a number of different wrestling promotions, which then became known as the NWA territories. The promoters, (Pinkie George, Al Haft, Tony Stecher, Harry Light, Orville Brown and Sam Muchnick) formed a Board of Directors and decided that they would endorse two wrestling championships that all territories would recognize, the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship. Those two championships were controlled by the board, who would meet to vote on who should be given the championship next.\n\nAt the time tag team wrestling, or matches where teams of two wrestlers would fight each other, was not popular across all territories, so the board of directors did not sanction a specific NWA World Tag Team Championship. This meant that each territory was free to create their own \"World Tag Team Championship\" as they saw fit and use it within their territory without board approval. Tag team wrestling first rose to popularity on the west coast of the United States, which led to the Los Angeles territory, promoted by Johnny Doyle, creating the first NWA World Tag Team Championship of the territory era when the Dusek Riot Squad (Emil and Ernie) were billed as the champions on a July 14, 1949 show in Long Beach. The following year the San Francisco territory followed suit and created their local version of the championship when Ray Eckert and Hard Boiled Haggerty defeated the team of Ron Etchison and Larry Moquin on April 4, 1950. A month later the Midwest Wrestling Association territory, covering Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa, created their own version of the championship on May 26, 1950 as the Dusek Riot Squad (Emil and Joe) won that championship.\n\nIn 1953 the Chicago-based promoter Fred Kohler introduced the team of Lord James Blears and Lord Lathol Laytham as the local NWA World Tag Team champions, billing them as having won the championship in a different NWA territory before they began working for Kohler. Historic records do not indicate that Blears and Laytham had actually won the championship elsewhere. From mid-1953 the championship became the main tag team championship of the Illinois-Wisconsin territory. A few months later promoter Ed Don George brought in the Chicago champions to his Ohio-Upstate New York territory and used them to bring an air of legitimacy to his own version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship, allowing local wrestlers Bill Melby and Billy Darnell to defeat Blears and Martino Angelo (who substituted for an injured Athol).\n\nIn 1954 the Canadian Athletic Promotion, based in Montreal, used the NWA World Tag Team Championship name as well, but by the end of the year they had abandoned it. Also in 1954, Georgia Championship Wrestling introduced the Georgia version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship, using the Chicago version (held by Reggie Lisowki and Art Neilson) to start the Georgia branch.\n\nThe following year NWA founders Paul \"Pinkie\" George and Max Clayton introduced an Iowa-Nebraska version, with the champions splitting their time between George's Iowa territory and Clayton's Nebraska territory. The promoters billed Joe Tangaroa and Guy Brunetti as the local champions, recognizing the championship of the Chicago version up until September 1955, then splitting off in to their own lineage. Also in 1955, the first of two Texas-based NWA World Tag Team Championships was created by the Amarillo, Texas-based Big Time Wrestling, owned by Doc Sarpolis and Dory Funk. They followed in the footsteps of other NWA territories by having the Chicago champions (Lisowski and Neilson) travel to their territory to lose a version of the championship to start the local version. In this case Neilson worked regularly in the territory, while Lisowski left after only a brief stay. The promoters chose to have Rip Rogers replace Lisowski for the Amarillo version of the champions. Another version was introduced around 1955–1956 in the Idaho-Utah territory based out of Salt Lake City. The Indianapolis territory soon introduced another local version by recognizing the lineage of the Chicago version, before splitting it off into a separate entity in 1957 when Nicoli and Boris Volkoff won the championship.\n\nThree additional versions of the championship were introduced in 1957, the first of which was in Minneapolis, where the Kalmikoffs (Ivan and Karol) won a tournament to become champions. The second new championship was also the second Texas-based championship as the eastern Texas-based Houston-Dallas territory introduced Verne Gagne and Wilbur Snyder as their local champions. The third championship introduced in 1957 was used by Nick Gulas' NWA Mid-America promotion when Gulas introduced the Corsicans (Corsica Joe and Corsica Jean) as champions when they made their debut for NWA Mid-America.\n\nNo new championships were introduced in 1958 or 1959, but with all versions being active but that of Montreal, thirteen versions were being defended across the United States in 1957. In 1959/1960 the unity of the NWA was strained as several promotions broke away from the NWA, choosing to join with Minnesota promoter Verne Gagne to form the American Wrestling Association. This meant that the Minneapolis, Chicago, Iowa-Nebraska, Indianapolis and Idaho-Utah versions of the championship were all abandoned, replaced by the AWA World Tag Team Championship that was recognized in all of those territories.\n\nWhile the NWA lost some territories with the exodus to the AWA, others were added and additional NWA World Tag Team Championships were still being introduced. In 1961 Championship Wrestling from Florida created the Florida version of the championship as the Von Brauners (Kurt and Karl Von Brauner) became regular performers in Florida. In 1964 the Detroit-based Big Time Wrestling announced that Chris and John Tolos had won the newly created Detroit version of the championship on February 16, 1965. In 1966 NWA All-Star Wrestling introduced their own version, but by 1967 the promotion discontinued using them in favor of the NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship.\n\nIn 1968 the Amarillo territory stopped using their version of the world championship, favoring the NWA Western States Tag Team Championship instead. Only months later the Eastern Texas version was abandoned as well, once more in favor of a more regional championship name, the NWA Texas Tag Team Championship. Georgia Championship Wrestling followed the trend in 1969, with the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship. By 1970 the Ohio-Upstate New York territory left the NWA and became known as the National Wrestling Federation, in the process they rebranded the tag team championship as it became known as the NWF World Tag Team Championship. No territory created a new world tag team championship until 1975 where the NWA Mid-Atlantic promotion in the Carolinas introduced the Mid-Atlantic version, the first new championship in nine years. This championship would later also be recognized by Georgia Championship Wrestling. In 1977 the NWA Mid-America territory was split in two as Jerry Lawler and Jerry Jarrett took over a large part of the territory when they created the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA). After the territory splits NWA Mid-America abandoned their version of the world tag team championship.\n\nIn 1979 the San Francisco version of the championship was abandoned, while Hollywood Wrestling reintroduced the Los Angeles version of the championship shortly afterwards. The same year the Central States version was abandoned, in favor of the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship. The Detroit territory closed its doors in 1980, ending their version of the championship. In 1981 World Class Championship Wrestling briefly brought back the east Texas version of the championship, but later abandoned it in favor of the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship.\n\nIn 1982 the Los Angeles territory closed, abandoning their version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship. This meant that the Mid-Atlantic version of the championship became the only NWA World Tag Team Championship that was still active from that point forward. In 1980 MACW owner and promoter Jim Crockett Jr. became president of the NWA and started to consolidate the south eastern promotion, branding them as the \"National Wrestling Alliance\" while officially being known as Jim Crockett Promotions. The consolidation of the Crockett brand was done in part to combat the country-wide expansion of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in the early 1980s, breaking with the territory approach of the NWA. With JCP gaining national television deals the Mid-Atlantic version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship became a de facto \"World\" championship, moving from a regional championship and later recognized as a \"World Championship\" by Pro Wrestling Illustrated, the premier wrestling magazine at the time.\n\nIn 1988 the cost of the rapid expansion of JCP forced Crockett to sell his promotion to Ted Turner. Turner began to rebrand the promotion as World Championship Wrestling, but still used the NWA prefix for all of their championships at that point in time. In January 1991 WCW officially split from the NWA, spinning off the NWA Championships into WCW championships, which meant that then-reigning champions Doom (Ron Simmons and Butch Reed) became the first champions to officially be labeled as WCW World Tag Team Championship. At that point in time the NWA did not determine a new set of NWA World Tag Team Champions.\n\nA year after parting ways with the NWA, the two parties came to an agreement for WCW to host a tournament for the first ever officially board of directors sanctioned NWA World Tag Team Championship. To push the \"world\" aspect of the championship WCW and the NWA brought in several international teams for the tournament. Teams such as Sliver King and El Texano from Mexico, Hiroshi Hase and Akira Nogami from Japan, Miguel Perez Jr. and Ricky Santana from Puerto Rico and Joe and Dean Malenko representing \"Europe\". The first round of the tournament took place on June 22, 1992 at WCW's Clash of the Champions XIX show, while the remaining tournament took place at the 1992 Great American Bash. In the period of time between the Clash and the Great American Bash the team of Terry Gordy and Steve Williams had won the WCW World Tag Team Championship from The Steiner Brothers, and when they won the tournament at the Great American Bash they became double champions, carrying two belts each for their matches.\n\nWCW had five championship changes happen for the combined WCW/NWA World Tag Team Championships happen between July 1992 and August 1993, after which the NWA broke off their relationship with WCW once more. Then-champions Arn Anderson and Paul Roma were stripped of the NWA championship, a fact that was not mentioned on TV as they kept defending the WCW championship. While the NWA initially recognized the five WCW booked championship reigns, they later removed them from their official history.\n\nThe NWA did not hold a tournament for the vacant NWA World Tag Team Championship until almost two years later, holding a one night tournament on April 11, 1995. The tournament was won by The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson), defeating the team of Dick Murdoch and Randy Rhodes in the finals.\n\nIn 1998 the NWA board of directors reached an agreement with the World Wrestling Federation to feature several of the NWA championships on WWF television as part of an \"Invasion\" storyline. For the purposes of the storyline the then-champions Pat and C.W. Anderson were stripped of the championship and instead the Rock 'n' Roll Express were named the new champions so they could work with the WWF. The storyline saw WWF wrestler Jeff Jarrett lead a group of \"Old School\" wrestlers representing the NWA, including Jarrett winning the NWA North American Heavyweight Championship. As part of the storyline the Rock 'n' Roll Express lost the tag team championship to WWF regulars The Headbangers (Mosh and Thrasher) on February 17, 1998 during an episode of \"Raw is War\". The Headbangers later lost the championship to The New Midnight Express (Bombastic Bob and Bodacious Bart) as the NWA Invasion angle was being phased out.\n\nOn August 14, 1998 the New Midnight Express lost the championship to The Border Patrol (Agent Gunn and Agent Maxx), ending the association with the WWF. Over the following years the championship changed hands at various minor shows as well as the NWA 50th Anniversary Show where The Brotherhood (Knuckles Nelson and Erich Sbraccia) won the championship. In 2002 The Shane Twins (Mike and Todd) won the championship from The New Heavenly Bodies (Chris Nelson and Vito DeNucci).\n\nIn early 2002, Jeff Jarrett and his father Jerry Jarrett started a new promotion called NWA Total Nonstop Action (NWA-TNA) based in Nashville. The Jarretts reached an agreement with the NWA board of directors to allow NWA-TNA to control both the singles and tag team versions of the world heavyweight championship. Both championships were vacated to allow NWA-TNA to hold tournaments for the new champions. On July 3, 2002 A.J. Styles and Jerry Lynn defeated The Rainbow Express Bruce and Lenny in the finals of a tournament to win the championship. TNA controlled the championship from 2002 until May 2007, crowning a total of 32 champions in that period of time. At that point the NWA withdrew its recognition of NWA:TNA, which then rebranded itself \"Total Nonstop Action Wrestling\" and created the TNA World Tag Team Championship.\n\nWith the championship vacant after the split from TNA, the National Wrestling Alliance arranged a three team tournament to determine the new champions. On July 8, 2007 The Real American Heroes (Karl Anderson and Joey Ryan defeated the teams of Billy Kidman/Sean Waltman and Incognito/Sicodelico Jr. in a three-way match to win the championship. On October 4, 2008 The Skullcrushers (Rache Brown and Keith Walker) defeated \"Los Luchas\" (Phoenix Star and Zokre) to win the championship. This marked the start of a 777 day long reign, the longest in the championships history, lasting until November 20, 2010 where The Skullcrushers were defeated by The Dark City Fight Club (Jon Davis and Kory Chavis.\n\nIn 2013 the NWA began working closely together with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), co-promoting shows and NJPW hosting several championship matches for both the heavyweight and tag team championships. On April 20, 2013 the Killer Elite Squad (Davey Boy Smith Jr. and Lance Archer) defeated Scott Summers and Ryan Genesis to win the championship, the Killer Elite Squad was also the IWGP Tag Team Champions at the time of the title victory. On November 3, 2013 The IronGodz (Jax Dane and Rob Conway) won the NWA World Tag Team Championship in a special two falls match that saw Tencozy (Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima) with the IWGP championship in the other fall. Conway was the reigning NWA World Heavyweight Champion, making him the first person to hold both championships at once. On April 6, 2014 Tencozy defeated the Iron Godz to win the NWA championship and would later lose those to the Killer Elite Squad on October 10, 2014. On October 15, 2015 The Heatseekers (Sigmon and Elliot Russel) won the championship on a show in Dyersburg.\n\nOn April 27, 2019, the NWA announced on their Twitter page that the winners of the 2019 Crockett Cup tournament would be awarded the vacated NWA World Tag Team Championship as a reward. Later that night, Villain Enterprises (Brody King and PCO) defeated the wild card team of Royce Isaacs and Thomas Latimer defeated in the finals to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship.\n\nThere has been 83 total officially recognized title reigns and five \"unofficial reigns\" from the time WCW controlled the championship. Rasche Brown and Keith Walker, known as the Skullkrushers, hold the record for longest reign, which lasted 777 days before they lost the belts to The Dark City Fight Club. The Skullkrushers, by virtue of such a lengthy run as champions, also hold the record for most cumulative days as champions, 35 days longer than the two reigns of the Dark City Fight Club which totaled 742 days.\n\nAmerica's Most Wanted (James Storm and Chris Harris) are the record holders for most reigns as a team with six. Storm also holds the record for most individual reigns as champion, having eight total. In addition to holding the championship with Harris, Storm also held it with Christopher Daniels and currently holds it with Eli Drake.\n\nThe titles are currently held by Eli Drake and James Storm in their first reign. They defeated previous champions The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) and The Wildcards (Thomas Latimer and Royce Isaacs) at NWA Hard Times on January 24, 2020 in Atlanta, GA.\n\nWhen the National Wrestling Alliance Board of Directors decided to finally endorse a NWA World Tag Team Championship in 1992 they reached out to World Championship Wrestling to organize the initial tournament as well give them the rights to control the championship on a day-to-day basis. WCW pulled together a 16-team tournament that saw seven teams made up of regular WCW competitors as well as teams from various countries such as Japan, Mexico, Canada and more. The eight matches of the first round all took place on June 16, 1992 at WCW's Clash of the Champions XIX. During the show WCW started a storyline feud between WCW's top tag team, the Steiner Brothers, and the favorite non-WCW team of Steve Williams and Terry Gordy, who had been one of the top teams in Japan for years prior to the tournament. During the show Gordy and Williams attacked the Steiners' opponents prior to the match, leading to the Steiners winning by forfeit. During the show the Steiners challenged Gordy and Williams to face them in the second round that night instead of waiting for the next round. In the main event of the Clash of Champions Gordy and Williams defeated the Steiner Brothers to advance to the semi-finals. In the month between the first round and the rest of the tournament Gordy and Williams defeated the Steiner Brothers to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship.\n\nThe finals took place at that year's The Great American Bash pay per view on July 12. For the second round Japanese wrestler Shinya Hashimoto replaced Akira Nogami who had been injured after he and Hiroshi Hase had qualified for the quarter-finals. Hase and Hashimoto defeated The Fabulous Freebirds in the quarter-finals only to lose to Dustin Rhodes and Barry Windham in the semi-final. In the other semi-final match Gordy and Williams defeated the team of Nikita Koloff and Ricky Steamboat, followed by Gordy and Williams defeating Rhodes and Windham in the finals to become dual champions.\n\nWhile the NWA withdrew their recognition of the WCW controlled championship in August 1993 they did not establish new champions until almost two years later, holding a one-night, eight-team tournament on April 11, 1995 in Dallas, Texas. The tournament saw tag team veterans, and former four-time holders of the Mid-Atlantic version of the championship The Rock 'n' Roll Express defeat Dick Murdoch and Randy Rhodes to win the championship.\n\nThe NWA Board of Directors stripped the Rock 'n' Roll Express of the championship on August 4, 1995 when Ricky Morton was suspended by Smokey Mountain Wrestling and thus was unable to defend the championship. During the fall of 1995 the NWA reached an agreement with their Japanese member, International Wrestling Association of Japan (IWA Japan) to give the Japanese promotion control of the championship. IWA Japan held a multi-week, multi-team round-robin tournament to crown new champions. The finals saw Mr. Gannosuke and Tarzan Goto defeat the team of Cactus Jack and Tiger Jeet Singh to become the eight overall champions. The table below was derived from the results page.\nIn June 2002 the NWA vacated the tag team championship to allow the newly formed NWA-Total Non-Stop Action (NWA-TNA) to use the championship on their weekly pay-per-view (PPV) shows. NWA-TNA held a four-team tournament, which included the former champions the Shane Twins, albeit working as the masked tag team \"The Johnsons\".\n\nThe tournament was the focal point of NWA-TNA's third weekly PPV and saw America's Most Wanted (AMW) defeat the Johnsons in the first match, followed by The Rainbow Express (Bruce and Lenny) defeated the team of Buff Bagwell and Gran Apolo. Between the first round and the finals it was announced that both Harris and Storm of America's Most Wanted were injured and unable to compete in the final match. NWA-TNA management then announced that A.J. Styles and Jerry Lynn would replace AMW in the last match of the tournament. Styles and Lynn went on to defeat The Rainbow Express to become the first NWA-TNA era NWA World Tag Team Champions\n\nDuring the 9th weekly TNA PPV show on August 14, 2002, then-champions A.J. Styles and Jerry Lynn defended the championship against the team of Jeff Jarrett and Ron Killings. The match ended with Jarrett pinning Lynn while Styles pinned Killings, which lead to the championship being held up due to the inconclusive outcome of the match. On September 18 NWA-TNA held a tournament to determine new champions. The tournament had two stages, first a Gauntlet for the Gold, multi-man elimination match, with the final two competitors moving to the finals along with their respective tag team partners. The Gauntlet for the Gold was won by Brian Lee and Chris Harris. Immediately after the match Harris and partner James Storm (America's Most Wanted) defeated Brian Lee and his chosen partner Ron Harris to win the championship.\n\nOn February 4, 2004 A.J. Styles was scheduled to team with Abyss to wrestle then-champions The Red-Shirt Security (Kevin Northcutt and Joe Legend) for the belts. The two were storyline rivals that were forced to team up. On the night the storyline was that Abyss did not show up for the match, but Styels managed to defeat Northcutt and Legend to win the championship. Three weeks later Abyss defeated A.J. Styles to gain full control of the championship. A couple of weeks later the championship was vacated because Abyss did not defend them, nor did he chose a new partner.\n\nOver the following weeks NWA-TNA held an eight-team tournament to crown new champions. Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Low-Ki) earned their way to the finals by defeating The New Franchise (Michael Shane and Shane Douglas) in the first round and The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens) in the semi-finals. The team of Dallas and Kid Kash qualified for the finals with victories over the team of Simon Diamond and Sonny Siaki and then defeated The Disciples of the New Church (Sinn and Slash). In the finals Dallas and Kash defeated Triple X to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship for the first time.\n\nIn October 2018, during the NWA 70th Anniversary Show, it was announced that the Crockett Cup would be returning in 2019.[8] It was later revealed that the event would take place on April 27, 2019, at Cabarrus Arena in Concord, North Carolina. The event was co-produced by the NWA and Ring of Honor (ROH).[1]\n\nAt the NWA New Years Clash, The War Kings (Crimson and Jax Dane) (with Road Warrior Animal) defeated Caleb Konley and Jay Bradley to become the first team to qualify for the 2019 Crockett Cup.[10] From January 24 to January 26, 2019, Ring of Honor held a 12-team Tag Wars tournament as part of their Road To G1 Supercard tour of Texas. Villain Enterprises (Brody King and PCO) won the three-day tournament by defeating The Kingdom (Vinny Marseglia and TK O'Ryan) in the first round, The Bouncers (Brian Milonas and Beer City Bruiser) and the team of Kenny King and MVP in the second round, and Lifeblood (Juice Robinson and David Finlay) in the finals to earn a spot in the Crockett Cup as well as a match for the ROH World Tag Team Championship.[11] \nOn February 8, 2019 it was announced that ROH partner promotions Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) out of Mexico, and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) from Japan would also be sending teams for the 2019 Crockett Cup.[12][10]\n\n"}

{"id": "1868827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868827", "title": "Northumberland House", "text": "Northumberland House\n\nNorthumberland House (also known as Suffolk House when owned by the Earls of Suffolk) was a large Jacobean townhouse in London, so-called because it was, for most of its history, the London residence of the Percy family, who were the Earls and later Dukes of Northumberland and one of England's richest and most prominent aristocratic dynasties for many centuries. It stood at the far western end of the Strand from around 1605 until it was demolished in 1874. In its later years it overlooked Trafalgar Square.\n\nIn the 16th century the Strand, which connects the City of London with the royal centre of Westminster, was lined with the mansions of some of England's richest prelates and noblemen. Most of the grandest houses were on the southern side of the road and had gardens stretching down to the River Thames.\n\nIn around 1605 Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton cleared a site at Charing Cross on the site of a convent and built himself a mansion, at first known as Northampton House. The Strand facade was 162 feet (49 m) wide and the house's depth was marginally greater. It had a single central courtyard and turrets in each corner.\n\nThe layout reflected medieval traditions, with a great hall as the principal room. It had separate apartments for members of the household, who would still at that time have included gentlemen attendants such as Jassintour Rozea, French Master Chef 1748 who arranged sumptuous banquets for the Duke, Charles Seymour, one of London's wealthiest aristocrats. Many of the apartments were reached from external doors in the courtyard, in the manner still seen at Oxbridge colleges. The exterior was embellished with classical ornament in the loose way of ambitious Jacobean buildings. The Strand's most striking external feature was its elaborate four-storey carved stone gateway. The garden was wide and over long, but unlike those of neighbouring mansions to the east, it did not reach all the way down to the river.\n\nThe house passed from Lord Northampton to the Earls of Suffolk, another branch of the powerful Howard family headed by the Dukes of Norfolk. In the 1640s it was sold to the Earl of Northumberland, at the discounted price of £15,000, as part of the marriage settlement when he married a Howard.\n\nRegular alterations were made over the next two centuries in response to fashion and to make the layout more convenient for the lifestyle of the day. John Webb was employed from 1657 to 1660 to relocate the family's living accommodation from the Strand front to the garden front. In the 1740s and 1750s the Strand front was largely reconstructed and two wings were added which projected from the ends of the garden front at right angles. These were over long, in late palladian style, and contained a ballroom and a picture gallery, the latter itself 106 feet (32 m) long. The architects were Daniel Garrett, until his death in 1753; and then the better known James Paine. In the mid-1760s Robert Mylne was employed to reface the courtyard in stone; he may also have been responsible for extensions to the two garden wings which were made at that time. In the 1770s Robert Adam was commissioned to redecorate the state rooms on the garden front, and the Glass Drawing Room at Northumberland House was one of his most celebrated interiors. Part of the Strand front had to be rebuilt after a fire in 1780.\n\nIn 1819 Thomas Cundy was employed to rebuild the Garden (South) Front, which had become unstable, moving it south; and in 1824 he added the final main staircase. \nBy the end of the mid-19 century the other mansions on the Strand had been demolished. The area was largely commercial and its entertainment industry had grown, meaning it was no longer a fashionable place for aristocracy to live. The current Duke of Northumberland was reluctant to leave his generations-held home, although he was pressured to do so by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which wished to build a road through the middle of the site to connect to the new roads by the Embankment. After a fire which caused substantial damage, the Duke accepted an offer of £500,000 in 1866 (). Northumberland House was demolished and Northumberland Avenue, including its buildings fronting, was built in its place.\n\nOne of the largest buildings on the newly built Northumberland Avenue was the 500-bedroom Victoria Hotel, which in its arched entrance, and oriel window above it, imitated Northumberland House. During the Second World War it was taken over by the Ministry of Defence and renamed Northumberland House. This \"new\" Northumberland House was left empty for several years until it was purchased by the Wellcome Trust.\n\nAn archway from Northumberland House, designed by William Kent, was sold for the entrance to the garden of Tudor House, which formerly stood in Bromley-by-Bow. It was moved in 1998 to form the principal entrance to the Bromley by Bow Centre.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1868834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868834", "title": "Symmetrical components", "text": "Symmetrical components\n\nIn electrical engineering, the method of symmetrical components simplifies analysis of unbalanced three-phase power systems under both normal and abnormal conditions. The basic idea is that an asymmetrical set of \"N\" phasors can be expressed as a linear combination of \"N\" symmetrical sets of phasors by means of a complex linear transformation. \n\nIn the most common case of three-phase systems, the resulting \"symmetrical\" components are referred to as \"direct\" (or \"positive\"), \"inverse\" (or \"negative\") and \"zero\" (or \"homopolar\"). The analysis of power system is much simpler in the domain of symmetrical components, because the resulting equations are mutually linearly independent if the circuit itself is balanced.\n\nIn 1918 Charles Legeyt Fortescue presented a paper which demonstrated that any set of N unbalanced phasors (that is, any such \"polyphase\" signal) could be expressed as the sum of N symmetrical sets of balanced phasors, for values of N that are prime. Only a single frequency component is represented by the phasors. \n\nIn 1943 Edith Clarke published a textbook giving a method of use of symmetrical components for three-phase systems that greatly simplified calculations over the original Fortescue paper. In a three-phase system, one set of phasors has the same phase sequence as the system under study (positive sequence; say ABC), the second set has the reverse phase sequence (negative sequence; ACB), and in the third set the phasors A, B and C are in phase with each other (zero sequence, the common-mode signal). Essentially, this method converts three unbalanced phases into three independent sources, which makes asymmetric fault analysis more tractable.\n\nBy expanding a one-line diagram to show the positive sequence, negative sequence, and zero sequence impedances of generators, transformers and other devices including overhead lines and cables, analysis of such unbalanced conditions as a single line to ground short-circuit fault is greatly simplified. The technique can also be extended to higher order phase systems.\n\nPhysically, in a three phase system, a positive sequence set of currents produces a normal rotating field, a negative sequence set produces a field with the opposite rotation, and the zero sequence set produces a field that oscillates but does not rotate between phase windings. Since these effects can be detected physically with sequence filters, the mathematical tool became the basis for the design of protective relays, which used negative-sequence voltages and currents as a reliable indicator of fault conditions. Such relays may be used to trip circuit breakers or take other steps to protect electrical systems.\n\nThe analytical technique was adopted and advanced by engineers at General Electric and Westinghouse, and after World War II it became an accepted method for asymmetric fault analysis.\n\nAs shown in the figure to the above right, the three sets of symmetrical components (positive, negative, and zero sequence) add up to create the system of three unbalanced phases as pictured in the bottom of the diagram. The imbalance between phases arises because of the difference in magnitude and phase shift between the sets of vectors. Notice that the colors (red, blue, and yellow) of the separate sequence vectors correspond to three different phases (A, B, and C, for example). To arrive at the final plot, the sum of vectors of each phase is calculated. This resulting vector is the effective phasor representation of that particular phase. This process, repeated, produces the phasor for each of the three phases.\n\nSymmetrical components are most commonly used for analysis of three-phase electrical power systems. The voltage or current of a three-phase system at some point can be indicated by three phasors, called the three components of the voltage or the current. \n\nThis article discusses voltage, however, the same considerations also apply to current. In a perfectly balanced three-phase power system, the voltage phasor components have equal magnitudes but are 120 degrees apart. In an unbalanced system, the magnitudes and phases of the voltage phasor components are different. \n\nDecomposing the voltage phasor components into a set of symmetrical components helps analyze the system as well as visualize any imbalances. \nIf the three voltage components are expressed as phasors (which are complex numbers), a complex vector can be formed in which the three phase components are the components of the vector. A vector for three phase voltage components can be written as\n\nand decomposing the vector into three symmetrical components gives\nwhere the subscripts 0, 1, and 2 refer respectively to the zero, positive, and negative sequence components. The sequence components differ only by their phase angles, which are symmetrical and so are formula_3 radians or 120°. \n\nDefine a phasor rotation operator alpha, which rotates a phasor vector counterclockwise by 120 degrees:\nNote that α = 1 so that α = α.\n\nThe zero sequence components have equal magnitude and in phase with each other, therefore:\n\nand the other phase sequences have the same magnitude, but their phases differ by 120°:\n\nThus,\n\nwhere\n\nIn reverse phase rotation systems, the following matrix can be similarly derived\n\nThe sequence components are derived from the analysis equation\n\nwhere\n\nThe above two equations tell how to derive symmetrical components corresponding to an asymmetrical set of three phasors:\n\n\nVisually, if the original components are symmetrical, sequences 0 and 2 will each form a triangle, summing to zero, and sequence 1 components will sum to a straight line.\n\nThe phasors formula_12 form a closed triangle (e.g., outer voltages or line to line voltages). To find the synchronous and inverse components of the phases, take any side of the outer triangle and draw the two possible equilateral triangles sharing the selected side as base. These two equilateral triangles represent a synchronous and an inverse system. \n\nIf the phasors V were a perfectly synchronous system, the vertex of the outer triangle not on the base line would be at the same position as the corresponding vertex of the equilateral triangle representing the synchronous system. Any amount of inverse component would mean a deviation from this position. The deviation is exactly 3 times the inverse phase component. \n\nThe synchronous component is in the same manner 3 times the deviation from the \"inverse equilateral triangle\". The directions of these components are correct for the relevant phase. It seems counter intuitive that this works for all three phases regardless of the side chosen but that is the beauty of this illustration. The graphic is from Napoleon's Theorem, which matches a graphical calculation technique that sometimes appears in older references books.\n\nIt can be seen that the transformation matrix above is a discrete Fourier transform, and as such, symmetrical components can be calculated for any poly-phase system. \n\nHarmonics often occur in power systems as a consequence of non-linear loads. Each order of harmonics contributes to different sequence components. Harmonics of order formula_13 make no contribution. Harmonics of order formula_14 contribute to the zero sequence. Harmonics of order formula_15 contribute to the negative sequence. Harmonics of order formula_16 contribute to the positive sequence.\n\nNote that the rules above are only applicable if the phase values (or distortion) are exactly the same.\n\nThe zero sequence represents the component of the unbalanced phasors that is equal in magnitude and phase. Because they are in phase, zero sequence currents flowing through an n-phase network will sum to n times the magnitude of the individual zero sequence currents components. Under normal operating conditions this sum is small enough to be negligible. However, during large zero sequence events such as lightning strikes, this nonzero sum of currents can lead to a larger current flowing through the neutral conductor than the individual phase conductors. Because neutral conductors are typically not larger than individual phase conductors, and are often smaller than these conductors, a large zero sequence component can lead to overheating of neutral conductors and to fires.\n\nOne way to prevent large zero sequence currents is to use a delta connection, which appears as an open circuit to zero sequence currents. For this reason, most transmission, and much sub-transmission is implemented using delta. Much distribution is also implemented using delta, although \"old work\" distribution systems have occasionally been \"wyed-up\" (converted from delta to wye) so as to increase the line's capacity at a low converted cost, but at the expense of a higher central station protective relay cost.\n\n\n\n"}

It has been owned by Cominar since 2014.\n\nThe mall is home to H&M, Vero Moda, Jack & Jones, Rudsak, Massimo Dutti, Le Château, Michael Kors, Stuart Weitzman, Zara and Guess.\n\nRockland Centre has three floors; the basement, main and top. But only the main and top floors are shopping space.\n\nThe basement floor has four tenants: Sports Experts, Nautilus Plus fitness club, Eggspectation restaurant and Urban Planet shop.\n\nThe first (main) floor features boutiques and the anchors Linen Chest (part of the old Eaton's space), Pharmaprix and longtime tenant The Bay.\n\nThe second (top) floor consists of boutiques and the mall's food court. The Bay's second floor is located on the mall's top floor.\n\nRockland Centre first opened in August 1959 with Steinberg's, Morgan's, Woolworth's, Holt Renfrew, United Cigars and 35-40 other tenants.\n\nThe original Rockland Centre was a non-linear outdoor shopping centre covered on the sidewalk. It was the first shopping centre in the province to bring the \"mall\" concept, meaning a central corridor in the form of an esplanade surrounded by boutiques on each side. It was primarily a single-level mall, but Morgan's had three floors (when counting its basement). Rockland Centre was built on what used to be a golf course. It was designed by architect Victor Prus, and commissioned by Morgan's and Steinberg's.\n\nSome of the tenants of the original centre included Reitmans, Laura Secord Chocolates, Browns Shoes and Bank of Montreal.\n\nMorgan's rebranded as The Bay on June 19, 1972.\n\nBy 1982, Rockland Centre was in steady decline due to the emergence of newer shopping centres. Its 80 tenants had their sales decreased by a third in the last decade.\n\nRockland Centre began on April 23, 1982 a major renovation at the cost of 68 million $ to transform itself into the upscale shopping mall it is today. The majority of the original shopping centre was demolished. Only Steinberg's, The Bay and a handful of small tenants (e.g., Bank of Montreal) were spared from the demolition. The Bay temporarily closed its store on January 15, 1983 for renovation with the intent of reopening in August 1983 with the new mall.\n\nRockland reopened as a three level fully enclosed mall on August 24, 1983 anchored by The Bay, Eaton's, Steinberg's and Holt Renfrew. The Eaton's store was built in the place of the demolished boutiques from the old shopping centre, at 139,000 square feet and making a fifth of the size of the new mall. The Bay reopened in a new building of 153,000 square feet, larger and adjacent to its former location, but with two floors instead of three. The Bay's original building was converted into mall space and its basement was turned into a food court. Holt Renfrew inaugurated a new store of 25 000 square feet; its largest at the time in a shopping mall. The Cumberland pharmacy doubled its size, while fitness chain Nautilus (known today as Nautilus Plus) opened its largest location at 14 000 square feet. Linen-Chest moved to the mall its original store that had been located since 1961 on Queen Mary Road in the Snowdon neighbourhood.\n\nA multi-level parking lot was built on the north side between The Bay and Eaton's during the transformation of the shopping centre. Rockland Centre increased its size at 800,000 square feet and its number of tenants to 175 stores as a result of these renovations.\n\nSteinberg's, one of the last tenants from 1959, became a Metro in 1992.\n\nMetro closed the store in 1999. Today the space is shared between Pharmaprix, Société des alcools du Québec and a relocated Bank of Montreal.\n\nEaton's closed shop in 1999.\n\nThe existing Linen-Chest store doubled its size by relocating into the first floor of Eaton's in December 2001. The rest of the first floor of Eaton's went to Laura. As of 2018, the size of the Linen-Chest store has been reduced to half of what it was following a massive renovation that caused it to be temporarily closed for three months, while Laura relocated elsewhere in the mall as a regular boutique. An IGA supermarket will open in those vacant spaces during Spring 2020.\n\nThe second floor of Eaton's was initially taken over by Sports Experts. In 2005, the Sports Experts store was moved to the vacant food court area on the basement (The Bay's until 1983). In a swap of locations, the food court was moved to the second floor where Sports Experts had been (and which had been Eaton's second floor). Almost 15 years later, the food court was closed for many months in 2018 to undergo a major renovation. This food court was rechristened \"La Cuisine\" on March 13, 2019. Also located within the second floor of the former Eaton's store is a Renaud-Bray bookstore which opened on October 4, 2018. The aforementioned second floor used to have a H&M store which has since closed and is now vacant.\n\nAlthough revitalized into mall space in 1983, the exterior of the old Morgan's/The Bay building can still been seen to this day from the multi-level parking lot.\n\nThe mall was the filming location in 1992 for the episode \"Tale of the Pinball Wizard\" from the children's horror/fantasy television show \"Are You Afraid of the Dark?\".\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1863, it is California's third oldest public high school (after Lowell High School in San Francisco and Sacramento High School in Sacramento).\n\nSan José High School opened in 1863 in a room above Orbon's flour store at 210 South 1st Street. On January 1, 1868, it moved to a purpose-built $20,000 building at Santa Clara and 7th Streets that also housed Horace Mann Elementary. \n\nIn 1898 San José High School was relocated to One Washington Square, on San Fernando Street between 6th and 7th Streets, where it remained until 1952. This location was on the San Jose State College campus. The 1898 building was three stories, of brick and stone, and cost $75,000; it was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and after the school shared facilities for two years with Lincoln High School, it moved back to a replacement building on the same site, which was used from 1908 to 1951. This high school campus was designed by Pasadena architect F. S. Allen in Mission Revival style and cost $175,000; it housed different subjects in separate buildings connected by arcades forming courtyards.\n\nIn 1951, intending to expand the college, the State of California rescinded its permission for the high school to be located on the San José State campus, and the school moved in 1952 to its present location at the corner of 24th and Julian Streets. The original $2,500,000 building, by Ernest J. Kump, was chosen that year by the Museum of Modern Art as one of 43 outstanding examples of modern architecture. It has since been greatly expanded, including a swimming pool in 1959, two new wings and a full theatrical stage in 1961, and a new science building and a new career technology engineering building in the first decade of the 21st century.\n\nIn 1985, the school was renamed San Jose Academy and later San Jose High Academy as part of the federal magnet schools concept, but on March 25, 2010, it returned to its original name, San Jose High School.\n\nIn the 21st century the school's enrollment increased to 1200, the largest population since the late 1980s. The principal is Gloria Marchant, a naturalized Canadian who became a U.S. citizen in a ceremony at the school in May 2018.\n\nThe school has offered the International Baccalaureate program since 1985, and since 1999 has offered the IB Middle Years Program along with its major feeder middle school, Burnett Middle School. It was recognized as a California Distinguished High School in 1990.

The town has a harbour and a quay at the Rhine. In terms of local government organization, it is a medium-sized city belonging to the district of Kleve in the administrative region (\"Regierungsbezirk\") of Düsseldorf.\n\nEmmerich lies on the north bank of the Rhine, just within the German borders; it is only 4 km to the Netherlands to the north and 5 km to the west. Therefore, it is the last German town on the Rhine before the river flows into the Netherlands.\n\nThe populated places which comprise the municipality of Emmerich am Rhein are Emmerich, Borghees, Dornick, Elten, Hüthum, Klein-Netterden, Leegmeer, Praest, Speelberg and Vrasselt.\n\nTo the north, the municipality of Emmerich borders the Dutch municipalities Montferland and Oude IJsselstreek, both of which are in the Dutch province of Gelderland. To the east, it is bordered by the German city of Rees. To the south, it is bordered by the Rhine, and south of this river, by the German city of Kleve. To the west, it is bordered by the Dutch municipalities of Rijnwaarden and Zevenaar, both of which are also in the Dutch province of Gelderland.\n\nEmmerich, formerly called \"Embrika\" and \"Emrik\", was originally a Roman colony. Around the year 700 Saint Willibrord founded the mission \"Emmerich\" in the Utrecht diocese. The oldest documented name is \"Villa Embrici\", which survives from the year 828.\nThe collegiate church \"St. Martinikirche\" was constructed in 1040.\n\nOn 31 May 1233 Count Otto von Zutphen and Gelder arose to the royalty of the prosperous city with the authorization of the Roman Emperor Frederick II and the German King Henry (VII) Emmerich. In 1371 it fell to the Duchy of Cleves, and passed with it in 1609 to the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The town joined the Hanseatic League in 1407. In 1794 it was bombarded by the French under General Vandamme, and in 1806 it was assigned to the Duchy of Berg. It passed into the possession of Prussia in 1815.\n\nIn 1856 the railway section Oberhausen-Arnhem, of the Cologne-Mindener Railway was opened.\n\nEmmerich was 91% destroyed on 7 October 1944 as a strategic bombing target of the Oil Campaign of World War II. In 1949, Elten was annexed by the Netherlands until 1963.\n\nSince 1 February 2001 the city has officially been called \"Emmerich am Rhein\", until then it was simply \"Emmerich\".\n\nOn 28 November 2004 the four Catholic congregations of the city (St. Martini, St. Aldegundis, Heilig-Geist and Liebfrauen) combined to form the new city parish St. Christophorus.\n\nAs a part of the 1st municipal restructuring program, the municipalities of \"Borghees, Dornick, Hüthum, Klein-Netterden, Praest\" and \"Vrasselt\" were integrated into the city of Emmerich on 1 July 1969. In the course of the 2nd restructuring program, the municipality of \"Elten\" was integrated as well, on 1 January 1975.\n\nHoly Ghost Church This Catholic church was built in 1966 and is especially striking due to its version of the cross made of scrap metal and the Stations of the Cross made of linen. The architectural development during the time of the Second Vatican Council shaped the design of the church.\nRhine Bridge This bridge, which connects Emmerich on the north of the Rhine with Kleve on the south, was opened in 1965, and with a length of 803 meters and a span of 500 meters it is the longest suspension bridge in Germany. Approximately 500 ships pass underneath it every day.\n\nRhine Museum. In the Rhine Museum, 130 ship models are exhibited, as well as a radar unit, examples of fish taxidermy, maps of the Rhine, a historic Christophorus figurine and a library of the city's history. In addition there is a Biber submarine, a one-man U-Boat from World War II and exhibitions regarding shipping on the Rhine, the history of the city and fisheries.\n\nPAN-Art Forum/Poster Museum. The famous poster collection is displayed in the former Lohmann chocolate factory in rotating exhibits.\n\nCastle Borghees. The manor house Borghees used as a cultural center was expanded in its present form in the mid-18th century. Borghees Castle became historically well known due to a love affair of the 17-year-old Katharina Rickers, the later imperial countess of Wartenberg, with the Prussian king Friedrich I.\n\nEmmerich station is located about 1 km southeast of the city center on the double-track electrified \"Holland Route,\" which plays an important role in passenger travel and commercial transport and is therefore treated in the EU as a part of the Trans-European Network in the category \"priority projects which should be begun before 2010.\" In addition to the ICE International from Amsterdam to Frankfurt am Main, the night train CityNightLine to southern Germany, Austria and to Switzerland travels through here with a stop in Emmerich.\n\nWith regards to regional rail transport, the following trains pass through Emmerich, in general every hour:\nThere is another station located on the same line near Emmerich, the stop \"Praest\", which is only served by the Regional Train \"Der Weseler\" (RB 35).\n\nEmmerich lies on the A3 motorway (known in German as the Bundesautobahn 3), which has the European designation E35.

He was previously a key figure in the integration of minor league baseball in the late 1940s while working for the Dodgers organization. He went on to become the first president of the San Diego Padres (1968–77); then, between 1977 and 1984, as general manager, he assembled the California Angels teams that made the franchise's first two postseason appearances. His sons Peter Bavasi and Bill Bavasi have also served as big league general managers.\n\nBorn Emil Joseph Bavasi in Manhattan, New York City, his sister, Iola (\"Lolly\"), nicknamed him Buzzie because his mother said he was \"always buzzing around.\" Bavasi was raised in Scarsdale, New York by Joseph and Sue Bavasi. Joseph, his immigrant father, was a newspaper distributor. \n\nHe went to high school at Fordham Preparatory School, in the Bronx, with Fred Frick, the son of Ford Frick, president of the National League.\n\nHe attended DePauw University, in Greencastle, Indiana, where he was a catcher and while at DePauw roomed with Fred Frick, after which Ford Frick recommended Bavasi for an office boy position with the Dodgers to Larry MacPhail.\n\nBavasi was hired by Dodgers general manager Larry MacPhail in 1938, for $35 a week, to become a front office assistant with the Brooklyn Dodgers, and after one year was named the business manager of the Dodgers' Class D minor league team in Americus, Georgia, where he spent three seasons. In 1941 he moved to Durham, North Carolina Class B team of the Dodgers and married his wife, Evit.\n\nAfter being drafted, he was awarded a Bronze Star Medal fighting in the Italian Campaign of World War II as a machine-gunner in the United States Army.\n\nIn late 1945, after serving 18 months, Staff Sergeant Bavasi returned to Georgia to rest with his family. While there, Dodgers president Branch Rickey telephoned and asked Bavasi to become business manager of a new minor-league baseball team in the New England League, and to find a suitable city in which to place the club.\n\nAlthough Bavasi did not know for certain, he suspected that Rickey, who had started to integrate the Dodgers' farm system with the signing of Jackie Robinson the previous October, might be planning to sign more African Americans to contracts. If that was the case, the Dodgers needed a low-level minor-league team outside the American South to which to assign these players. Ultimately, Bavasi chose Nashua, New Hampshire. With fewer than 35,000 people, Nashua would be the smallest market in the New England League, and fewer than fifty African Americans resided in the community. However, the Nashua Dodgers were assured of a predominantly French Canadian fan base, a fact which both Rickey and Bavasi believed would help in the integration of African Americans into minor league baseball. Additionally, Nashua was home to the relatively new Holman Stadium, which Bavasi was able to lease from the city.\n\nIn March 1946, Bavasi received word that Brooklyn had signed former Negro League ballplayers Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe, and that they would be sent to Nashua for the season. Bavasi spent nearly a month planning for their arrival, naming \"Nashua Telegraph\" publisher Fred Dobens to the position of President of the Nashua Dodgers to ensure the newspaper's support for the integration project; Dobens's newspaper did not release any word of the signings until April. Bavasi also publicly linked the team to Clyde Sukeforth, who had scouted Campanella, Newcombe, and Jackie Robinson for Rickey and who had played minor-league baseball in Nashua in the mid-1920s. He promoted the team's French Canadian connection through his team's Quebec-born players, and even attempted to hire Frenchy Bordagaray to manage the team (eventually he settled on Walter Alston).\n\nThe 1946 season was a successful one. The Nashua Dodgers placed second in the league and won the Governor's Cup, defeating the Lynn Red Sox. In terms of attendance, Nashua also proved successful, in part because of Bavasi's imaginative promotional skills. The league saw few racially motivated incidents, with two exceptions. Campanella has claimed that Manchester Giants catcher Sal Yvars threw dirt in his face during a game at Manchester Athletic Field (Gill Stadium), but the incident was resolved on the field (though Yvars has denied that the incident took place). More seriously, players and the manager of the Lynn Red Sox hurled racial slurs and insults at Campanella and Newcombe, particularly late in the season when the two clubs were locked in a tight pennant race. On one occasion, Bavasi was so enraged by the comments of the Red Sox that he met Lynn's manager and players in the Holman Stadium parking lot and challenged them to a fight. Players restrained Bavasi and the Lynn manager, and the Lynn team boarded their bus without further incident.\n\nAs a result of their success in Nashua, Bavasi, Campanella, and Alston all were promoted to teams in higher-level leagues in 1947, and Newcombe followed in 1948.\n\nIn 1948, Bavasi became general manager of the Montreal Royals, one of the Dodgers' top two Triple-A farm teams. Around that time, as a result of continued prejudice against Brooklyn's African American ballplayers during spring training, the Dodgers sent Bavasi to find property at which to establish a permanent spring training facility. Bavasi chose a site outside Vero Beach, Florida, at which to establish Dodgertown, anchored by the newly constructed Holman Stadium. The Dodgers continued to train there virtually without interruption through 2008 before moving to a new facility in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nDuring Bavasi's term in Montreal, disagreements over the operation of the parent team in Brooklyn intensified between Rickey and Walter O'Malley; at the time, Rickey and O'Malley were two of four equal partners in the Dodgers, each holding 25 percent of the club's stock. In 1950, the illness and death of another partner, pharmaceutical executive John L. Smith, coincided with the pending expiration of Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' president and general manager. With Smith and, later, his widow both siding with O'Malley, Rickey's contract was not renewed. O'Malley then acquired Rickey's stock to assume 50 percent ownership, took over as team president, and named Bavasi the Dodgers' vice president and \"de facto\" general manager on November 3, 1950. O'Malley would acquire Mrs. Smith's 25 percent share in 1958, then become sole owner in 1975 when he bought out the heirs of Dearie Mulvey's one-quarter stake in the team. Bavasi would be given the formal title of executive vice president and general manager prior to the 1958 season.\n\nIn Bavasi's nearly 18 years as the team's top baseball operations executive, the Dodgers won eight National League pennants (, , , , , , and )—including the first four World Series titles in franchise history (1955, 1959, 1963 and 1965). Three world championships occurred after the team's move to Los Angeles in 1958, a move that Bavasi did not favor. The Dodgers also finished in a dead heat twice with the Giants, necessitating tie-breaking, best-of-three series in both 1951 and 1962. But they dropped the clinching playoff games in the ninth innings of each contest.\n\nWhile the nucleus of the Brooklyn-based team was in place when Bavasi took over in 1951, he and O'Malley remained committed to the Dodgers' extensive scouting and player development system that Rickey had constructed after the war. That system contributed players such as Joe Black, Jim Gilliam, Johnny Podres and Sandy Amoros (heroes of the 1955 World Series), Don Drysdale, Sandy Koufax, Charlie Neal and Don Zimmer to the Dodgers before their move to California. In the late 1950s, it began to churn out the core regulars of the Dodgers' 1960s dynasty, such as Tommy Davis, Willie Davis, Ron Fairly, Frank Howard, John Roseboro and Maury Wills. During the mid-1960s, the Dodgers developed key contributors to their 1965–66 pennants, such as Jim Lefebvre, Wes Parker and Don Sutton. Bavasi also made strategic additions of veteran players who proved pivotal to pennant-winning teams, like Sal Maglie (1956), Wally Moon (1959), Bill Skowron (1963), Claude Osteen (1965–66, after he was acquired for Howard), Lou Johnson (1965–66) and Phil Regan (1966). In 1960, he acquired (in a trade for Zimmer) a minor-league left-handed relief pitcher from the Chicago Cubs, Ron Perranoski, who would anchor the Dodgers' bullpen through 1967.\n\nBavasi also strongly recommended Walter Alston to O'Malley as a potential Brooklyn manager after the 1953 season. Alston, a career minor leaguer, had managed for Bavasi in Nashua (1946) and Montreal (1950). O'Malley would hire Alston and sign him to 23 consecutive one-year contracts, with Alston winning seven National League pennants and four World Series titles and forging a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the days surrounding Bavasi's June 1968 departure from the Dodgers, the club enjoyed what has been called the best amateur draft in baseball history. The regular and secondary phases of the 1968 June lottery, supervised by Fresco Thompson and Al Campanis, the team's top minor league and scouting officials who would be Bavasi's immediate successors as GM, netted Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes, Ron Cey, Bill Buckner, Bobby Valentine, Joe Ferguson, Doyle Alexander and others.\n\nAfter the Dodgers won the 1959 Series in only their second year in Los Angeles, \"The Sporting News\" named Bavasi the Major League Executive of the Year.\n\nIn June of 1968, Bavasi resigned from the Dodgers to become president and minority owner of the San Diego Padres, an expansion team set to debut in . Bavasi selected Dodger third-base coach Preston Gómez as the Padres' first manager and added former Dodgers (or Dodger farmhands) Moon, Roger Craig and Sparky Anderson as coaches for their maiden season. While the pickings in the National League expansion draft were slim, Bavasi managed to select slugger Nate Colbert and hard-hitting outfielders Ollie Brown and Cito Gaston, who provided punch to the Padre lineup during the team's early history.\n\nAs was typical for expansion teams before free agency, the Padres struggled on the field. They finished last in the National League West Division for their first six years of existence and lost over 100 games four times (and 99 games once); the team's high-water mark during Bavasi's nine-year term as club president was 73 wins (). Poor attendance forced majority owner C. Arnholdt Smith to put the Padres up for sale in 1973 and almost drove them to transfer to Washington, D.C. But fast-food magnate Ray Kroc stepped in and saved the Padres for San Diego, and attendance perked up beginning in 1974, Kroc's first season as owner.\n\nAlthough veteran minor league executive Eddie Leishman held the title of general manager during the team's early seasons, Bavasi was integrally involved in baseball decisions. After the 1972 season, he promoted his son Peter from farm system director to GM, and the younger Bavasi drafted future Hall of Famer Dave Winfield with the club's first-round pick in the 1973 Major League Baseball Draft. Peter left the Padres after the 1976 campaign to become the first president in the history of the expansion Toronto Blue Jays, and in 1977, the Bavasis became the first father-and-son duo to serve as chief executives of two different MLB teams at the same time.\n\nAfter the 1977 season, California Angels owner Gene Autry hired the elder Bavasi as executive vice president and general manager. During his seven years in the post, the Angels captured American League West Division titles in and , the club's first-ever appearances in the baseball postseason. But each time the Angels failed to advance to the World Series, dropping the 1979 American League Championship Series to the Baltimore Orioles and the 1982 ALCS to the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThrough trades, free agency and the club's farm system, Bavasi acquired players such as Rod Carew, Reggie Jackson, Carney Lansford, Bob Boone, Fred Lynn, Mike Witt and Don Aase. But there were setbacks: the shocking death of star free agent outfielder Lyman Bostock, who was murdered late during the 1978 season in a case of mistaken identity, and the failure to retain future all-time strikeout king Nolan Ryan when he became a free agent after the 1979 campaign. Nearing age 70, Bavasi retired during the closing days of the 1984 season, when the Angels finished at the .500 mark.\n\nHis son Bill is the former general manager of the Seattle Mariners and California Angels; son Peter held president or general manager positions with the Padres, Blue Jays and Cleveland Indians during the 1970s and 1980s; and another son, Chris, formerly served as mayor of Flagstaff, Arizona, and with his wife, Evit, the couple had a fourth son Bob, the former owner of the Everett AquaSox.\n\nBavasi was inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame in 2001. In 2007, he was also inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.\n\nActor Wally Cassell played Buzzie (Dodgers manager) in season 1, episode 29 of The Beverly Hillbillies, titled The Clampetts & the Dodgers.\n\nBavasi died on May 1, 2008, in San Diego, California, near his home in La Jolla, aged 93.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1868865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868865", "title": "Donald Cragen", "text": "Donald Cragen\n\nDonald Cragen is a fictional character played by Dann Florek in the American crime drama television series \"Law & Order\" and its spinoff, \"\", on NBC. Cragen is a homicide captain with the New York Police Department who later becomes captain of the department's Special Victims Unit. A recovering alcoholic, Cragen is a tough police veteran who is loyal to his officers. He appeared in the first three seasons of \"Law & Order\" and in the first 15 seasons of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\". Having appeared in 400 episodes in the \"Law & Order\" franchise, Cragen has appeared in the second-most episodes of any character in the franchise; this mark is surpassed only by Olivia Benson, a main character on \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\".\n\nCragen comes from an Irish Catholic background, and graduated from a Catholic university in New York City, although different episodes have given conflicting information about exactly which school; he calls St. Raymond's University his alma mater in the episode \"Sophomore Jinx\", but says it is St. John's in the episode \"Justice\". Cragen served as a Green Beret in the U.S. Army Special Forces in the Vietnam War before joining the New York Police Department, where he was a homicide detective partnered with Max Greevey (George Dzundza). Cragen had been married to a flight attendant named Marge (Ellen Tobie) and the two had no children, although, in a continuity error, an early \"Law & Order\" episode indicated they had a teenage child.\n\nThe episode \"Prescription for Death\" establishes that Cragen is a recovering alcoholic. He says that his drinking problem had become so severe in his early career that Greevey insisted he would no longer partner with him unless he joined Alcoholics Anonymous. Cragen finally hit rock bottom when he pulled his service revolver on a taxi driver while in a drunken rage; horrified, he quit drinking, joined AA, and has been sober ever since. Nevertheless, he admits that he feels a daily temptation to drink due to the horrors he witnesses in his job.\n\nWhile on \"Law & Order\", Cragen was depicted as easily irritated when under stress; when answering the telephone, his customary greeting was, \"\"What?!\". By the time of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\", however, he has become more unflappable. He is jaded by city politics and no longer votes. He is a fan of the New York Mets, and keeps an autographed baseball in a case on his desk.\n\nCragen's primary weapon in \"Law & Order\" is a Smith & Wesson Model 36, which he continues to carry in \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\". His primary weapon throughout \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\", however, is a Glock 19 9mm semiautomatic pistol.\n\nFlorek portrayed the character from 1990 to 1993 in the original \"Law & Order\". Six years later, he reprised his role again in \"\" from its premiere in 1999 to 2014.\n\nIn the 1991 episode \"The Blue Wall\", Cragen is investigated by internal affairs for possible corruption after evidence tampering within the department leads to the acquittal of three Wall Street bankers in a money laundering case. As Greevey and detective Mike Logan (Chris Noth) investigate the case in an attempt to clear Cragen’s name, they discover that Cragen's mentor Pete O'Farrell (Robert Lansing) accepted bribes and arranged the evidence tampering. Cragen is reluctant to cooperate in the investigation against O'Farrell, but when District Attorney Adam Schiff (Steven Hill) applies pressure by calling for his indictment, Cragen agrees to wear a wire during conversations with O'Farrell, ultimately leading to O'Farrell's arrest. Despite clearing his own name in the process, Cragen feels guilty for bringing down his former mentor and friend.\n\nWhen Greevey is murdered in the episode \"Confession\", Cragen is a pall-bearer at his funeral.\n\nThe Cragen character was removed from the series after the third season, making his last appearance in the season finale episode \"Benevolence\". Although his departure is not immediately explained, it is established in the fifth season episode \"Bad Faith\" that he has transferred to head of the Anti-Corruption Task Force. He is succeeded in the homicide precinct by Lieutenant Anita Van Buren (S. Epatha Merkerson).\n\nAfter leaving the 27th Precinct, Cragen spends six years as the head of the Anti-Corruption Task Force.\n\nCragen encounters Logan again in the 1995 episode \"Bad Faith\" during an Anti-Corruption Task Force investigation into crooked narcotics detectives. Logan is investigating the suspicious death of a friend and fellow detective, Bill Marino, and is questioned by Cragen and task force detectives due to Marino's ties to the narcotics detectives. Logan's investigation into Marino's death leads to the arrest of Joseph Krolinsky (Bill Raymond), a former Catholic priest who had molested several boys, including Logan and Marino, and who had manipulated Marino into supplying him with victims. When Logan feels conflicted about whether to testify about his knowledge of Marino's complicity in those crimes, he turns to Cragen for advice. Cragen comforts Logan and ultimately helps convince him not to commit perjury by lying about Marino.\n\nAs portrayed in the 1998 TV movie \"\", Cragen next interacts with the 27th Precinct while attempting to arrest Mafia boss Don Giancarlo Uzielli (Tony Musante) for the murders of 15 people. During that investigation, Cragen discovers that there is not only a cop in the 27th Precinct on Uzielli's payroll, but that Logan is interfering with the investigation of the don by investigating a murder of his own. With Logan's help, Cragen discovers the identity of the corrupt officer: his former detective, and trusted friend, Tony Profaci (John Fiore).\n\nAt some point before the events of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\", Cragen's wife Marge, a flight attendant, is killed in a plane crash. Florek said upon reprising the role on \"SVU\" that he and the show's producers crafted a back story in which Marge's death led Cragen to start drinking again, and that, in his loneliness, he solicited prostitutes. In that back story, Cragen becomes captain of the sex crimes unit to escape that downward spiral. Most of that story, however, is not explicitly discussed in any episodes of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\".\n\nIn 1999, the character appeared in the spinoff \"\", in which he heads a bureau dedicated to solving sex crimes. Several of Cragen's first episodes on the series reunite him with another one of his former detectives from the 27th Precinct, Lennie Briscoe (Jerry Orbach); one of these reunions involves re-opening a serial murder case that Briscoe and Logan had failed to solve six years earlier (as portrayed in the \"Law & Order\" episode \"Mayhem\").\n\nIn \"Stalked\", a first season episode, Cragen participates in a sting operation in which one of his detectives, Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay), serves as bait for Richard White (Bruce Kirkpatrick), a serial rapist who had been stalking her. When White attempts to attack her, Cragen physically incapacitates him and allows for his arrest.\n\nIn a 2001 episode, Cragen finds a kidnapped boy he and Greevey had been assigned to find in 1991 while investigating a corrupt adoption agency. Cragen and his detectives later determined that the wife of the boy's biological father killed his mother and gave the baby to the adoption agency, where he was given a home. In the end, the boy's biological father wins custody of him.\n\nIn the episode \"Criminal\", a homicide investigation leads to a suspect named Javier Vega (James McDaniel), a man Cragen arrested for murder in the 1970s who has since reformed and become a criminology professor. Convinced of Vega's guilt, Cragen becomes personally involved in the investigation, which results in Vega's arrest and conviction. When evidence surfaces proving Vega's innocence, a guilt-stricken Cragen arranges for his immediate release. Vega later kidnaps the actual killer and threatens him at gunpoint, but Cragen talks him down, then saves Vega when the killer grabs Vega's gun and tries to shoot him.\n\nAt the start of the , Cragen is briefly relieved of duty for failure to supervise due to the actions of several of his detectives, such as Benson aiding her fugitive half-brother Simon Marsden (Michael Weston) and her partner, Detective Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni), covering up his daughter's DUI. Cragen is forced to transfer to the office of Chief of Detectives and cede control of his precinct to the newly promoted Sergeant John Munch (Richard Belzer). The transfer is short-lived, however, as Cragen's command is restored after Munch allows a suspect (Cynthia Nixon) faking dissociative identity disorder to be released into her sister's care, only for her to kill her parents. In season 11, he is again suspended for 10 days, and is told that any further trouble concerning his unit will cost him his job. In \"Ace\", he uses deadly force against a baby trafficker who is about to kill a rape victim.\n\nThroughout Season 13, Cragen takes a more personalized role in SVU cases. In the episode \"Russian Brides\", Cragen takes on an undercover assignment to lure out a killer of young mail order brides, posing as the head of a children's rights organization. During a conversation with his \"date\", he mentions that he and his late wife had always wanted a child, but to no success. After his wife suffered a miscarriage, he says they attempted to adopt a child, but could not find the time to go through with it. It is left ambiguous whether Cragen is speaking of his own life, or merely improvising as part of his undercover role. The season 13 finale, \"Rhodium Nights\", closes with Cragen awakening in bed to find the body of a young female escort beside him, her throat cut, and his hands covered in blood. He is suspended while the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau investigates him for murder. In the Season 14 premiere, Bureau Chief ADA of the Public Integrity Unit, Paula Foster (Paget Brewster), investigates Cragen in the murder of the escort. He is arrested and held at Rikers Island. The SVU detectives work the case as well, trying to prove that he was framed. It is discovered that Cragen did hire a few escorts for \"company\". After it is proven that the girl was murdered by her pimp, Delia Wilson (Brooke Smith), Foster drops the murder charge, but announces that she is charging him with several other crimes, prompting Benson and the SVU detectives to dig into Foster's motives. Benson discovers that Foster is on Wilson’s payroll. The SVU detectives arrest Foster, which allows the charges against Cragen to be dropped.\n\nIn the Season 15 episode \"Internal Affairs\", Cragen asks Benson to take the Sergeant's Exam and remarks that he is approaching the mandatory retirement age, numbering the days he has left with SVU. Cragen officially announces his retirement in the episode \"Amaro's One-Eighty\". He explains that he is leaving to join his girlfriend, Eileen Switzer (Mel Harris), on a six-month cruise around the world, which would take him to his mandatory retirement date. He tells the squad room it was his privilege to work with each one of them, and announces that Benson would be taking over as their new interim supervisor.\n\nIn Season 16, Cragen returns for the episode \"\", in which he helps Sergeant Benson and Defense Attorney Bayard Ellis (Andre Braugher) look into a decades-old rape. Cragen uses his connections from the 27th precinct to help SVU get information they could never have accessed otherwise.\n\nThe following are the medals and service awards worn by Captain Cragen.\n\nDann Florek was first cast as Donald Cragen in \"Everybody's Favorite Bagman\", the pilot episode of what would later become \"Law & Order\". The pilot was filmed and produced in 1988 and it would take two more years before NBC ordered the full series. While main cast members Noth, Dzundza, Michael Moriarty and Richard Brooks had each signed option contracts that allowed them to be hired for the full series, Florek had signed no such contract. However, since he did not have any other acting roles at the time that the show went into production, he was available to join the show's cast. Florek was living in Venice, Los Angeles at the time he was cast and had to be flown into New York City for the filming of each episode.\n\nFlorek said during the formative seasons of \"Law & Order\", the cast and crew had a great deal of integrity and were dedicated to making something different, and that filming could be unpredictable as a result. However, Florek was frustrated with his lack of scenes, claiming he felt the character was not well developed and under-appreciated, and he disliked commuting so far for such little material. He also believed the producers and crew were not giving him enough direction and guidance in forming the character, pointing out that he did not learn Cragen was an alcoholic until several weeks into filming. As a result, Florek came up with much of the character by himself, and improvised many personality traits and characteristics as he went.\n\nFlorek repeatedly tried to quit the role during the first season, claiming that he was not given enough screen time. Series creator Dick Wolf persuaded him to stay, particularly due to concerns about the stability of the cast after Dzundza left the series and was replaced by Paul Sorvino as Sergeant Phil Cerreta.\n\nFlorek was ultimately terminated from the series after the third season upon orders from Don Ohlmeyer, NBC's West Coast president, to add more female cast members to the show. Wolf objected to the decision, but agreed to it in the face of possible cancellation if he did not. He was one of two actors dismissed from the series along with Richard Brooks, who played Assistant District Attorney Paul Robinette. Wolf described notifying Florek and Brooks about the decisions as \"literally the two worst phone calls I ever had to make in a business context\". Florek said he did not approve of the \"hushed and hidden\" way his firing was handled.\n\nAfter Florek's departure from the show, Wolf stayed in touch with the actor and often said he wished to work with him again. Their continued correspondence led to Florek directing several episodes of \"Law & Order\", as well as Florek reprising his role as Cragen in \"Exiled: A Law & Order Movie\". When Wolf invited him to join the permanent cast of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\", the television comedy series \"The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer\", in which Florek played Abraham Lincoln, had just been cancelled. Florek had originally expected to star in another comedy, but production was delayed, freeing the actor's schedule up. Florek had reservations about accepting the role because, he said, \"I didn't want to wind up doing the same thing; the crusty yet benign captain.\" He ultimately agreed to join the cast, in part because Ohlmeyer no longer worked for NBC. In accepting the role, Florek asked for more freedom in shaping the direction of the character. He said, \"I wanted him to have grown and changed, and to be much more actively involved.\"\nWhen \"Law & Order: SVU\" first aired, Dave Mason, television editor for \"Ventura County Star\", said Cragen was \"played brilliantly\" by Florek, and called the relationship between Cragen and Stabler the strongest aspect of the series. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist for \"The Star-Ledger\", said the Cragen character \"showed off more personality\" in the film \"Exiled\" and on \"Special Victims Unit\" than the character exhibited in the original \"Law & Order\".\n\n"}

He was Fiji's first native-born Chief Justice.\n\nTuivaga was educated at the University of Auckland in New Zealand where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts on a Lau Provincial Council Scholarship. He was further educated in Middle Temple in London, where he read Law. He was admitted to the bar in 1964 and served as a Native Magistrate from 1958 to 1961. He was appointed as Crown Counsel in 1965, becoming their principal legal officer in 1968. He held this office till 1970. In 1972, he was appointed to the bench as a Puisne judge. When the Chief Justice, Sir Clifford Grant, resigned in 1980 under pressure from Fiji's first Prime Minister, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, Tuivaga was appointed Chief Justice by the Governor-General of Fiji, Ratu Sir George Cakobau.\n\nSir Timoci was awarded a knighthood in the 1980 Queen's Birthday Honours List for his achievement as the first native Chief Justice of Fiji. He travelled to London to receive the knighthood at Buckingham Palace.\n\nTuivaga upheld the independence of the judiciary in the wake of the two military coups that rocked Fiji in 1987. His actions in a later coup in 2000, however, generated much controversy. Together with two other judges, Michael Scott and Daniel Fatiaki (who later succeeded him as Chief Justice), Tuivaga advised the then-President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, to abrogate the , as requested by the Military. Mara refused and resigned on 29 May. An Interim Military Government, headed by Commodore Frank Bainimarama took power, abrogated the Constitution, and promulgated the Administration of Justice Decree, which Tuivaga had drafted. This decree abolished the Supreme Court, made the Chief Justice the President of the Appeal Court (of which, according to the constitution, he had previously been barred from membership). Another decree extended the retirement age of the Chief Justice from 70 years to 75. Fiji Law Society President Peter Knight condemned Tuivaga's actions, saying, \"\"The eyes of the profession, the nation and the world are upon the judiciary. It cannot be seen to openly condone criminal activity. It should as a matter of record that it will continue to occupy and function in its judicial role in the same uncompromising manner as it had done prior to 19 May.\"\" (These changes to the judiciary were subsequently reversed by a High Court decision to reinstate the Constitution on 15 November 2000. This decision was upheld by the Appeal Court on 1 March 2001).\n\nTuivaga was subsequently sued by members of the deposed government of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry for his role in abrogating the constitution, which all judges were bound by oath to uphold.\n\nIn an interview with the \"Daily Post\" on 15 June 2000, Tuivaga defended his role, saying it was not an endorsement but a practical acknowledgement of \"reality.\" \"\"While a de facto government is in place it is impossible for me as Chief Justice not to acknowledge its actual existence as a matter of political reality,\"\" he said. The Interim Military Government, which he called \"\"the only viable alternative government,\"\" needed to be recognized, he said, given the \"\"situation triggered by the state of insurrection in the country which so far has proved insidiously intractable\".\"\n\nThese changes to the judiciary authorized by the decrees that Tuivaga had drafted were subsequently reversed by a High Court decision to reinstate the Constitution on 15 November 2000. This decision was upheld by the Appeal Court on 1 March 2001. That year, he turned 70, the retirement age mandated by the restored Constitution. On 1 August 2002, Daniel Fatiaki succeeded him as Chief Justice.\n\nFollowing his retirement as Chief Justice, the Fijian government nominated Tuivaga as Fiji's candidate for a position on the new International Criminal Court (ICC). His role in the 2000 coup came back to haunt him, and the Fiji Law Society strongly criticized his nomination. In what the Fijian government saw as a humiliation, he was forced to withdraw his nomination during the balloting on 9 February 2003, when Samoan candidate Tuiloma Neroni Slade outpolled him.\n\nIn May 2005, Tuivaga spoke out in favour of the government's proposed Reconciliation and Unity Commission, which would, if established, have the power to compensate victims of offenses related to the 2000 coup, and amnesty to its perpetrators, subject to presidential approval. Tuivaga cautioned, however, that the workability of the arrangement would depend on the good will of the parties involved.\n\nOn 26 May 2005, the Rev. Akuila Yabaki of the Citizens Constitutional Forum expressed concern at reports that Tuivaga might be appointed to chair the proposed commission, reports downplayed by both Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase and Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry.\n\nIn the wake of the military coup which deposed the Qarase government on 5 December 2006, Interim Attorney-General Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum announced on 22 January 2007 that there would be an inquiry into allegations concerning the role of the judiciary in the events of 2000. It was reported that Tuivaga might be subject to the inquiry. In a letter to the Fiji Sun on 23 January, Tuivaga expressed surprise, saying that the Constitution of Fiji makes no provision for investigating retired members of the judiciary.\n\nIn October 2014, Sir Timoci released his memoirs titled, \"A Memoir of Sir Timoci Tuivaga Kt. CF.\"\n\nTuivaga, who hailed from the village of Yaroi on Matuku Island, in the Lau archipelago, was the son of Isimeili Siga Tuivaga and Jessie Hill. On 20 December 1958, he married Dr. Viliamina Leba Parrott Savu at the Centenary Methodist Church in Suva. In 1992, Lady Vilimaina Savu Tuivaga suffered a cerebral stroke. She died on 13 January 2000. In July 2002, Tuivaga married Raijeli Vasakula, a lawyer and the eldest daughter of former Deputy Prime Minister and academic Tupeni Baba and Adi Miriama Cagilaba. They reside in Muanikau and Raijeli continues to run her own law practice today.. Tuivaga had five children (William, Jessie, John and Timothy) and eleven grandchildren. In a traditional reunification Fijian ceremony in 2013, Tuivaga and his clan welcomed and acknowledged Captain Koresi Toaisi Tuivaga, of Maqbool Road, Nadera, as the eldest of the Tuivaga children.\n\nTuivaga had gone out to play nine holes at the Suva Golf Club on Wednesday, 30 December 2015. Afterwards he came into the club for drinks with friends and collapsed. Efforts by Army Commander Viliame Naupoto were unsuccessful. Having lived a full life, Sir Timoci died at 84 years old.\n\n"}

{"id": "1868905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868905", "title": "Third-degree murder", "text": "Third-degree murder\n\nThird-degree murder is a category of murder defined in the laws of three states in the United States: Florida, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. It was also formerly defined in New Mexico (which once had five degrees of murder) and Wisconsin. \n\nDepending on the state, third-degree murder may include felony murder regardless of the underlying felony, felony murder only where the underlying felony is non-violent, or depraved-heart murder. It is punishable by a maximum of 40 years imprisonment in Florida (in the case of a violent career criminal) and Pennsylvania, and 25 years imprisonment in Minnesota.\n\nThe first division of the general crime of murder into graded subcategories was enacted into the law of Pennsylvania in 1794. This enactment is often explained in terms of a desire to narrow the scope of application of capital punishment in that state and in the other states which subsequently graded murder into \"first\" and \"second\" degrees. The English common law, which had been received into the laws of the U.S. states, at the time applied capital punishment to a large number of crimes; as a result, states statutorily divided the crime of murder into first and second degrees, and began applying capital punishment only to criminals convicted of first-degree murder. By 1953 three states—namely Florida, Minnesota, and Wisconsin—had further created the subcategory of third-degree murder.\n\nUnited States federal law, and the laws of the majority of states and territories, divide murder into separate crimes known as first-degree murder and second-degree murder, while the rest use other names for different categories of murder or do not divide murder into separate categories at all. However, only three states have a crime called third-degree murder.\n\nFlorida law divides murder into three degrees. First-degree murder comprises premeditated murders and felony murders where the underlying felony belongs to an enumerated list of violent or drug-related felonies; second-degree murder is depraved-heart murder; third-degree murder is felony murder where the underlying felony is not one of the enumerated felonies falling under first-degree felony murder.\n\nThe exact statutory definition of third-degree murder is \"[t]he unlawful killing of a human being, when perpetrated without any design to effect death, by a person engaged in the perpetration of, or in the attempt to perpetrate, any felony other than\" nineteen enumerated categories of felonies. It constitutes a second-degree felony. Second-degree felonies are punishable by a maximum of 15 years' imprisonment ordinarily, a maximum of 30 years for a habitual felony offender, or 30 to 40 years for a violent career criminal.\n\nThe nineteen enumerated categories of felonies falling under first-degree murder rather than third-degree murder are drug trafficking; arson; sexual battery; robbery; burglary; kidnapping; prison escape; aggravated child abuse; aggravated abuse of an elderly person or disabled adult; aircraft piracy; unlawful distribution of cocaine, opium, or other controlled substances when such drug is proven to be the proximate cause of the death of the user; carjacking; home-invasion robbery; aggravated stalking; murder of another human being; unlawful throwing, placing, or discharging of a destructive device or bomb; aggravated fleeing or eluding with serious bodily injury or death; resisting an officer with violence to his or her person; or terrorism or an act in furtherance of terrorism.\n\nMinnesota law originally defined third-degree murder solely as depraved-heart murder (\"without intent to effect the death of any person, caus[ing] the death of another by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life\"). In 1987, an additional drug-related provision (\"without intent to cause death, proximately caus[ing] the death of a human being by, directly or indirectly, unlawfully selling, giving away, bartering, delivering, exchanging, distributing, or administering a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or II\") was added to the definition of third-degree murder. Up until the early 2000s, prosecutions under that provision were rare, but they began to rise in the 2010s. Some reports linked this increase in prosecutions to the opioid epidemic in the United States.\n\nMinnesota law also defines the crime of third-degree murder of an unborn child, with the same elements of depraved mind and lack of intent to kill distinguishing it from first- or second-degree murder of an unborn child. Both third-degree murder and third-degree murder of an unborn child are punishable by a maximum of 25 years' imprisonment.\n\nNew Mexico once divided the crime of murder into five different degrees. A legal scholar writing in 1953 (by which time this level of division had been abolished) described this as the \"all-time 'record'\" for dividing murder into degrees. In the 1884 Compiled Laws of New Mexico, third-degree murder included assisting a suicide (§ 696), killing of an unborn child by injury to the mother (§ 697), administration of abortifacient causing death of an unborn child or its mother (§ 698), unintentional killing of a human being in the heat of passion in a cruel or unusual manner (§ 699), and unintentional death caused by an intoxicated physician (§ 701).\n\nPennsylvania law defines third-degree murder as a murder which is neither a first-degree murder (\"criminal homicide ... committed by an intentional killing\") nor a second-degree murder (\"committed while defendant was engaged as a principal or an accomplice in the perpetration of a felony\"). For purposes of that section, \"felony\" is specifically defined as \"engaging in or being an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing, or attempting to commit robbery, rape, or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary or kidnapping.\" There are also parallel crimes of first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree murder of an unborn child. There does not exist the crime of third-degree murder of a law-enforcement officer, only first-degree and second-degree. Third-degree murder and third-degree murder of an unborn child are punishable by a maximum of 40 years' imprisonment.\n\nThird-degree murder was introduced to Pennsylvania law in a 1974 amendment, at the same time as second-degree murder was redefined as felony murder; prior to that, second-degree murder had been defined as any murder not a first-degree murder. The common-law definition of murder as homicide \"with malice aforethought\" remains in force in Pennsylvania. A conviction for third-degree murder does not require intent to kill as in first-degree murder, but it still requires malice. In general, Pennsylvania courts have ruled that the standard of \"malice\" required for a conviction of third-degree murder is the same as that required for aggravated assault: not just \"ordinary negligence\" nor \"mere recklessness\", but \"a higher degree of culpability, i.e., that which considers and then disregards the threat necessarily posed to human life by the offending conduct\". A defense of diminished capacity may reduce first-degree murder to third-degree murder.\n\nThe crime known as drug delivery resulting in death had originally been classified as another form of third-degree murder under Pennsylvania law. In \"Commonwealth v. Ludwig\" (2005), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that this meant that conviction for the crime required the same element of malice as in any other third-degree murder. In response to this ruling, the Pennsylvania General Assembly amended the definition of the crime in 2011 to reclassify it as general criminal homicide rather than specifically as third-degree murder, thus removing the requirement of malice. However, the maximum sentence remained the same 40 years' imprisonment as for third-degree murder.\n\nSoon after statehood, Wisconsin enacted statutes repealing the common law of murder and dividing the crime of murder into three degrees, with the third encompassing felony murder. For example, the 1849 Revised Statutes defined third-degree murder as a killing \"perpetrated without any design to effect the death, by a person engaged in the commission of any felony\". The 1956 Criminal Code in § 940.03 defined third-degree murder as causing the death of another \"in the course of committing or attempting to commit a felony ... as a natural and probable consequence of the commission of or attempt to commit the felony\", and provided that the sentence for the underlying felony could thus be extended by 15 years. This was described by some commentators as a \"hybrid\" between the common-law felony murder rule and the civil law approach of treating an unintentional death as a \"penalty-enhancer\" to the punishment for the underlying felony. The 1988 revision of § 940.03 removed the term \"third-degree murder\" entirely and re-entitled the section as \"felony murder\".\n"}

If two fuels have identical Wobbe Indices then for given pressure and valve settings the energy output will also be identical. Typically variations of up to 5% are allowed as these would not be noticeable to the consumer.\n\nThe Wobbe Index is a critical factor to minimise the impact of the changeover when analyzing the use of \"substitute natural gas\" (SNG) fuels such as propane-air mixtures. The Wobbe Index also requires the addition of propane to some upgraded biomethane products, particularly in regions where natural gas has a high calorific value such as Sweden \n\nThe Wobbe index is expressed in MJ/Nm³ (or sometimes in BTU/scf). In the case of natural gas (molar mass 17 g/mol), the typical heating value is around 39 MJ/Nm³ (1,050 BTU/scf) and the specific gravity is approximately 0.59, giving a typical Wobbe index of 51 MJ/Nm³ (1,367 BTU/scf).\n\nThere are three ranges or \"families\" of fuel gases that have been internationally agreed based on Wobbe index. Family 1 covers manufactured gases, family 2 covers natural gases (with high and low ranges) and family 3 covers liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Combustion equipment is typically designed to burn a fuel gas within a particular family: hydrogen-rich town gas, natural gas or LPG.\nOther flame characteristics and composition limits may determine the acceptability of the replacement gas, e.g. flame speed, \"yellow tipping\" due to incomplete combustion, sulfur content, oxygen content, etc.\n\nIn spite of its usefulness, Wobbe index alone is not a good indicator of the interchangeability of two or more gases, or mixtures of them. It is necessary to bear in mind other criteria while determining the plenty substitution of a fuel by other, different of the one used to adjust the burning system.\n"}

The initial agreements were signed in February 1921 and formally took effect in 1923. During the interwar period the alliance with Poland was one of the cornerstones of French foreign policy. Near the end of that period, along with the Franco-British Alliance, it was the basis for the creation of the Allies of World War II.\n\nDuring the France-Habsburg rivalry which began in the 16th century, France had tried to find allies to the east of Austria and hoped to ally with Poland. Polish King Jan III Sobieski also had the intention to ally with France against the threat of Austria, but the greater threat posed by the Muslim-led Ottoman Empire made him fight for the Christian cause in the Battle of Vienna. In the 18th century, Poland was partitioned by Russia, Prussia and Austria, but Napoleon recreated the Polish state in the Duchy of Warsaw. With the rise of a united German Empire in the 19th century, France and Poland found a new common enemy.\n\nDuring the Polish-Soviet War of 1920, France, one of the most active supporters of Poland, sent the French Military Mission to Poland to aid the Polish army. In early February in Paris, three pacts were discussed by Polish Chief of State Józef Piłsudski and French President Alexandre Millerand: political, military and economic.\n\nThe political alliance was signed there on February 19, 1921 by Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Eustachy Sapieha and his French Minister of Foreign Affairs Aristide Briand, in the background of the negotiations that ended the Polish-Soviet War by the Treaty of Riga. The agreement assumed a common foreign policy, the promotion of bilateral economical contacts, the consultation of new pacts concerning Central and Eastern Europe and assistance in case one of the signatories became a victim of an \"unprovoked\" attack. As such, it was a defensive alliance. The secret military pact was signed two days later, on February 21, 1921, and clarified that the agreement was aimed at possible threats from both Germany and the Soviet Union. An attack on Poland would make France keep lines of communication free and Germany in check but not require it to send troops or to declare war. Both political and military pacts were legally not in force until the economic pact was ratified, which occurred on August 2, 1923.\n\nThe alliance was further extended by the Franco-Polish Warrant Agreement, signed on October 16, 1925 in Locarno, as part of the Locarno Treaties. The new treaty subscribed all previously-signed Polish-French agreements to the system of mutual pacts of the League of Nations.\n\nThe alliance was closely tied with the Franco-Czechoslovakian Alliance. France's alliances with Poland and Czechoslovakia were aimed at deterring Germany from the use of force to achieve a revision of the postwar settlement and ensuring that German forces would be confronted with significant combined strength of its neighbours. Although Czechoslovakia had a significant economy and industry and Poland had a strong army, the French-Polish-Czechoslovakian triangle never reached its full potential. Czechoslovakian foreign policy, under Edvard Beneš, avoided signing a formal alliance with Poland, which would force Czechoslovakia to take sides in Polish-German territorial disputes. Czechoslovakia's influence was weakened by the doubts of its allies as to the trustworthiness of its army, and Poland's influence was undermined by fighting betwee supporters and opponents of Józef Piłsudski. France's reluctance to invest in its allies' industry (especially Poland's), improve trade relations by buying their agricultural products and share military expertise further weakened the alliance.\n\nIn the 1930s, the alliance remained mostly inactive and its only effect was to keep the French Military Mission to Poland, which had worked with the Polish General Staff ever since the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920. However, with the German threat becoming increasingly visible in the latter part of the decade, both countries started to seek a new pact to guarantee the independence of all contracting parties and military co-operation in case of a war with Germany.\n\nFinally, a new alliance started to be formed in 1939. The Kasprzycki-Gamelin Convention was signed May 19, 1939 in Paris. It was named after Polish Minister of War Affairs General Tadeusz Kasprzycki and Commander of the French Army Maurice Gamelin. The military convention was army-to-army, not state-to-state, and was not in force legally, as it was dependent on signing and ratification of the political convention. It obliged both armies to provide help to each other in case of a war with Germany. In May, Gamelin promised a \"bold relief offensive\" within three weeks of a German attack.\n\nThe treaty was ratified by France on September 4, 1939, on the fourth day of German offensive on Poland.\n\nHowever, France provided only token help to Poland during the war in the form of the Saar Offensive, which has often been considered an example of Western betrayal. However, the political convention was the basis of the recreation of the Polish Army in France.\n\nPiotr Zychowicz quoted the memoirs of the French ambassador to Poland, Léon Noël, who wrote as early as October 1938, \"It is of utmost importance that we remove from our obligations everything that would deprive French government the freedom of decision on the day when Poland finds itself in war with Germany\". Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet reassured Noel by writing that \"our agreement with Poland is full of gaps, needed to keep our country away from war\". (pages 279 - 280)\n\n\n"}

Gilardino currently holds the record for being the tenth-youngest player to have scored 100 goals in Serie A, a feat which he managed at the age of 26 years and 105 days. With 188 Serie A goals, Gilardino is currently among the top 10 all-time scorers in Serie A history. His trademark goal celebration saw him get to his knees and play an imaginary violin.\n\nGilardino has played for several Italian clubs throughout his career. He first came to prominence during his time at Parma due to his consistent goalscoring, which earned him the Serie A Young Footballer of the Year Award in 2004, followed by the Serie A Footballer of the Year and the Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year Awards in 2005, as well as a move to Milan. With Milan, he won the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, the 2007 UEFA Super Cup and the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup. Gilardino has also played for Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande, with whom he won the 2014 Chinese Super League.\n\nGilardino has represented Italy at under-19, under-20, under-21, and senior levels. Gilardino was a part of the Italian side that won the 2004 UEFA Under-21 Championship, where he became the tournament's leading goalscorer. He was also named as the best player of the tournament, and one of two strikers in the UEFA Team of the Tournament. Later that year, he also won a bronze medal with Italy at the 2004 Summer Olympics. He is the all-time top scorer of the Italy U-21 national team with 19 goals in 30 appearances. At senior level, he was part of the 2006 FIFA World Cup-winning squad, and has also participated at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, the 2010 World Cup and the 2013 Confederations Cup, where he won a bronze medal.\n\nResident from birth to Cossato, in the province of Biella, Gilardino started playing with Cossatese, with whom he remained until the Under-15 category of Juniors.\n\nAfter another year in the youth of A.S.D. Junior Biellese Libertas under the guidance of Luca Prina, Gilardino went to Piacenza. The coach Luigi Simoni gave him his debut in Serie A at age 17, on 6 January 2000 against Milan. The season ended with the Piacenza's relegation to Serie B, but Gilardino still managed to make an impact by scoring 3 goals in 17 matches.\n\nIn September 2000, \"\"Gila\"\", as he is often nicknamed and already considered a talent, was sold to Hellas Verona in co-ownership, for 7 billion Italian lire (€3,615,198). Despite his young age, he scored five goals in his two seasons at the club where he made 39 league appearances. Gilardino attracted Verona to sign him in full in June 2001, for 8.5 billion lire. (€4,389,884).\n\nGilardino was bought by Parma in a co-ownership deal during the 2001–02 season for 9.5 billion lire (€4,906,341) and loaned back to Verona. At Verona, Gilardino played two seasons under the guidance of Attilio Perotti, and then Alberto Malesani.\n\nGilardino was also involved in a car accident which ruled him out of the season on 28 April 2001: a truck crossed his car off the road and ended up in the river Sile, but he managed to abandon it before it sank. However, a fracture of the sternum ruled him out of the rest of the season. Gilardino, not yet 20 years old, scored 5 goals in 39 matches in two seasons at Verona.\n\nGilardino's career was launched on the international stage in 2002, as Parma purchased the remained 50% of his registration rights and returned Šerić to Verona. The move was strongly requested by then Parma coach Cesare Prandelli. Later, Adrian Mutu, Gilardino's teammate at Verona, was also signed, to replace the departing Marco Di Vaio. However, Mutu and Adriano started most of Parma's matches in the 2002–03 Serie A, relegating Gilardino to the substitutes' bench. Gilardino nonetheless made 24 league appearances and scored four goals, as well as one goal in the Coppa Italia.\n\nIn the 2003–04 season, Gilardino scored 23 goals in Serie A, 17 of which came in the second half of the season, also thanks to the return of Adriano to Internazionale. Gilardino's 23 goals placed him second in Serie A for the season, behind Andriy Shevchenko's 24. Gilardino also scored three goals in the UEFA Cup. The player credited his manager Cesare Prandelli for helping him to grow technically. Gilardino's success at club and U-21 level earned him a contract extension until June 2007.\n\nIn his third championship in Parma (2004–05), he repeated this feat, scoring another 23 goals in the league and finishing as the second-best scorer in Serie A once again, preceded by Cristiano Lucarelli's 24. He scored in a playoff match against Bologna, bringing his total haul to 24 goals. He also scored once in the UEFA Cup. He scored 51 goals for Parma in only 97 appearances in Serie A.\n\nOn 17 July 2005, Gilardino made a €25 million transfer to Milan, acquiring the number 11 shirt. He scored his first goal for the \"Rossoneri\" in a match against Sampdoria. He would finish the 2005–06 season with 17 goals in 34 Serie A appearances and two goals in three appearances in the Coppa Italia, but he failed to find his offensive form in Milan's 2005–06 UEFA Champions League campaign, going goal-less in all 12 matches.\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, Gilardino's scored his first UEFA Champions League goal on 1 November 2006, in a 4–1 win against Anderlecht. His European offensive output the next season was equally disappointing, with only two goals. However, one of his two goals helped Milan seal a decisive 3–0 win over Manchester United in the second leg of the semi-finals on 3 May 2007, which put them back into the Champions League final and set up a rematch with Liverpool. He played only two minutes as a substitute for Filippo Inzaghi in Milan's 2–1 victory.\n\nGilardino led Milan in 2006–07 Serie A scoring with 12 goals; no other Milan player hit double figures. At the end of the season, he revealed in an interview to feel challenged, to experience bitterness at not having played the Champions League final won by Milan, and was considering the possibility of leaving Milan. However, following a clarification with management, he decided to stay.\n\nGilardino contributed a brace in Milan's 5–1 defeat of Lazio on 7 October 2007 (which marked his first domestic goal following a double in Milan's 5–2 victory over Ascoli on 18 April), and likewise for his first Champions League brace netting of the season in a 4–1 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk on 24 October. In the second half of the season, Gilardino was often left on the substitutes' bench by manager Carlo Ancelotti, to be relegated to third striker behind Inzaghi and Alexandre Pato. Later, Gilardino described the last few months spent at Milan as the worst of his career, while stressing the positive aspects of his experience in Milan and his estimate for the \"Rossoneri\".\n\nWith Milan, Gilardino was considered a strong front man who was adept at holding the ball and leading attacks.\n\nOn 25 May 2008, Fiorentina sporting director Pantaleo Corvino confirmed a deal to sign Gilardino from Milan had been completed. On 28 May, the deal was confirmed from the official website of the \"Rossoneri\": Gilardino moved for €15 million and signed a five-year deal. At Fiorentina, Gilardino was reunited by former Parma teammates Adrian Mutu, Sébastien Frey and Marco Donadel, as well as his former manager at Parma, Cesare Prandelli.\n\nGilardino's first goal with the \"Violas\" was in the first leg of the third qualifying round for the 2008–09 Champions League against Slavia Prague, where he scored the second goal of the match. On 31 August, Gilardino scored on his Serie A debut against Juventus in the 89th minute to tie the match at 1–1. In the successive league match, he supplied an assist to Adrian Mutu to open the score in the match against Napoli, but Fiorentina still finished on the losing side by suffering a 1–2 defeat at the Stadio San Paolo. In the first match in the Champions League group stage, against Lyon, he scored two goals in the first half to give Fiorentina a two-goal cushion, only to be cancelled by two second-half goals from Frédéric Piquionne and Karim Benzema. On 18 October, thanks to a brace against Reggina, Gila became the seventh youngest Italian player to score 100 goals in Serie A. On 27 October 2008, Gilardino was given a two-match suspension for unsportsmanlike conduct have after scoring with his hand in Fiorentina's 3–1 victory at Palermo. The handball was not seen by referee Emidio Morganti. Gilardino insisted the handball was unintentional, claiming it was caused by defender Paolo Dellafiore.\n\nOn 25 April 2009, Gilardino scored a brace in Fiorentina's 4–1 victory against Roma, thereby scoring 100 goals scored in his last six years. In the same period in Europe, only Samuel Eto'o, Thierry Henry and Luca Toni scored more goals. Gilardino finished the 2008–09 season with 19 Serie A goals (all from open play), placing him in fourth place in the league scoring charts and contributing significantly to the Fiorentina's fourth-place Serie A. Among the highlights of his season was a double against Roma and an astonishing tight angle shot against Genoa while being marked by three defenders.\n\nGilardino had an exceptional campaign in the Champions League the following season, first scoring a dramatic late goal to give Fiorentina a 2–2 draw at Sporting CP, then against Debrecen, and then scoring in the third minute of stoppage time against Liverpool in the final match day of the group stage at Anfield, which gave Fiorentina a first-place finish at the expense of Lyon. On this occasion, Gilardino scored ten goals in European competitions for Fiorentina, equalling the record set by Gabriel Batistuta. Gilardino later said the goal at Anfield was the most important goal of his career. He ended the 2009–10 season with four goals in the Champions League and 15 in Serie A.\n\nOn 27 February 2011, Gilardino scored the ninth league goal of the season and his 200th career goal as a professional player in a match against Bari, which gave Fiorentina 1–0 lead.(138 in Serie A, 8 in Italian Cup, 13 in the Champions League, 5 in the UEFA Cup, 17 in the senior national team, 15 in Under 21 national team, 4 in the Italian Olympic team). On 6 March 2011, Gilardino scored in Fiorentina's 3–0 victory against Catania, his 44th goal in Serie A for Fiorentina. This placed him in tenth place among the markers purple and 30th place in the scorer list of all time.\n\nOn 21 August, Gilardino scored the first goal of the 2011–12 Serie A season in the match Fiorentina against Cittadella, which ended 2–1. His first league goal of the season came in the second round against Bologna. On 17 December, he scored his second goal of the season.\n\nOn 3 January 2012, Gilardino signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with Genoa, and cost €8 million. Gilardino chose 82 as his shirt number, as his number 11 was occupied by Boško Janković. On 29 January, during a match against Napoli, he scored his first Genoa goal, at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris. He scored his first brace for Genoa from the penalty spot at the San Siro against Internazionale in an eventual 5–4 loss. He scored his fourth goal in a 2–0 win over Palermo on 13 May, helping Genoa stay six points clear of the relegation zone.\n\nGilardino scored 4 goals in 14 appearances at Genoa in the second half of the 2011–12 Serie A season. Referred to the facts of Siena – Genoa 1–4 match in the 2011–2012 season ( pressure from the fans in the stadium with the players that they had to remove the mesh), 6 October 2012 federal prosecutors asked for 30 thousand euro fine for Gilardino and his other 14 teammates.\n\nOn 31 August 2012, Gilardino switched clubs again, joining Bologna for €1.3 million loan fee. Gilardino signed a contract worth €2,341,288. He made his debut with the shirt Emilian on 1 September 2012 in the lost game against Milan, succeeding Robert Acquafresca. Gilardino netted a brace on 16 September, helping his new side overcome a 2–0 halftime deficit to defeat Roma 3–2 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Gilardino scored his second brace for Bologna, in their 4–0 defeat of Catania on 30 September, bringing his goal tally to five in five games. Gilardino scored his sixth goal for Bologna on 18 November, opening the scoring in a comfortable 3–0 defeat of Palermo, earning his new club a much needed three points.\n\nGilardino led Bologna to a much needed win on 12 January 2013, netting a brace in the side's 4–0 defeat of Chievo Verona. He powered the club to a 1–0 defeat of Inter Milan on 10 March, scoring with a classy volley from a Diego Pérez cross, firmly establishing Bologna in mid-table and easing their relegation fears. He finished the season with 13 goals in 35 matches.\n\nAfter the season at Bologna, where he dragged his team to an early salvation thanks to his 13 goals, he returned to Genoa, non-transferable declared by the president Enrico Preziosi, at the request of the former midfielder Fabio Liverani recently become the new coach of Genoa. He scored his first goal of the season on 17 August against Spezia in the Italian Cup, the defeat on penalties after a 2–2 draw in regulation time accrued. He made his debut in the league in the 0–2 defeat at the San Siro against Inter and scored his first goal of the season in Serie A the following Sunday during the 2–5 home defeat against Fiorentina.\nOn 20 October, Gilardino scored two goals in the home game against Chievo Verona in the 2–1 game won by Genoa.\n\nOn 30 October, in the 9th round of the Serie A, Gilardino scored a decisive goal that allows Genoa in front of Parma. The story is also repeated on the next match against Lazio at the Stadio Olimpico, with a penalty kick goal of doubling. On 23 November, Gilardino carries a penalty equalizer against Milan at the San Siro, coming to 6 season goals in the top flight.\nOn 8 December, Gilardino scored the opening goal at the Stadio Sant'Elia against Cagliari Calcio in a 1–2 loss game. On 6 January 2014, he scored the eighth goal of the season on a penalty kick against Sassuolo leading Genoa to 500 victories in Serie A matches with the formula of a single round. On 26 January against Fiorentina Gilardino scored the opening goal in a thrilling 3–3 draw. On 16 February, he scored his first brace against Udinese since he returned the I Rossoblu, which led his team a 3–3 draw. With this two goals, Gilardino reaches 11 season goals and 170 total goals in Serie A, thus exceeding Giuseppe Savoldi and then temporarily ranking 14th among the Serie A all-time scorers. He finished the 2013–14 Serie A season with 15 goals in 36 matches.\n\nOn 5 July 2014, it was announced that Genoa had accepted a €5 million offer for Gilardino from Chinese side Guangzhou Evergrande. Gilardino signed a contract with the Chinese side until 31 December 2016 for an amount of 10 million. Gilardino finished his 2014 CSL season in Guangzhou with 5 goals in 14 matches, as Guangzhou won the Chinese Super League title for the fourth consecutive season.\n\nOn 25 January 2015, Fiorentina officially announced that the club had made a deal with Guangzhou Evergrande that Gilardino would transfer to Fiorentina on loan until the end of 2014–15 season, with a reported buyout clause of €1.5 million. On 31 January, Gilardino scored in the new debut for the viola in a 1–1 draw against Genoa. On April 26, Gilardino scored his 175th Serie A goal in a game against Cagliari. On May 18, he scores a goal against his former team Parma in a 3–0 win of Fiorentina. He finished the second half season with 4 goals in 14 matches. At the end of the season, Fiorentina decided not to sign him and Gilardino returned to China.\n\nOn 27 August 2015, Gilardino signed with Palermo. He made his debut for Palermo in a 2–2 draw against the Carpi on September 13. On 4 October, Gilardino scored against Roma, ending 2–4 for the giallorossi. Gilardino scored the second goal of the season in the game against Inter Milan, making his eighth goal against the Nerazzurri. On 30 January 2016, he scored his 184th Serie A goal in a 1–1 away draw against Carpi, equalling Gabriel Batistuta as the eleventh-highest score in Serie A history. He also tied the record for the most different clubs scored against in Serie A (38), which he now holds alongside Francesco Totti and Roberto Baggio. On 15 May 2016, he scored in a 3–2 home win over Verona to help save Palermo from relegation at the conclusion of the 2015–16 Serie A season; the goal also enabled him to equal Giuseppe Signori and Alessandro Del Piero as the joint-ninth highest goalscorer in Serie A history, with 188 goals. He finished the season with 10 Serie A goals in 33 matches.\n\nOn 7 July 2016, Gilardino signed with Empoli on a two-year contract. He spent six months at the club, making 16 appearances across all competitions and scoring one goal.\n\nOn 9 January 2017, Gilardino joined Pescara. He only made 3 appearances for the club.\n\nOn 3 October 2017, Gilardino signed with Spezia. He left the club by the end of the season and, on 20 September 2018, announced his retirement.\n\nIn September 2018, Gilardino received his UEFA A and UEFA B coaching licences. On 7 October 2018, Gilardino was named assistant coach and technical director of Serie D club Rezzato alongside head coach Luca Prina. On 28 February 2019, Gilardino was promoted to head coach of Rezzato, with Prina demoted to the supervisory role.\n\nOn 11 July 2019, Gilardino was appointed manager of Pro Vercelli.\n\nGilardino played with Italy in the 2004 Olympics in Athens, winning the bronze medal; he scored a decisive goal in the match for third place. He also led Italy's Under-21 team to victory in the 2004 European Under-21 Football Championship. With the Italy national Under-21 team led by coach Claudio Gentile, Gilardino won the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, and was also named the best player and top scorer of the event with 4 goals. He is currently the all-time top scorer for the Italy National Under-21 team with 19 goals in 30 matches.\n\nAfter the 2004 Olympics, Gilardino was chosen by the senior national team coach Marcello Lippi. He made his debut on 4 September 2004, at the age of 22, in a 2–1 home win in a World Cup qualifier against Norway. On 13 October, he scored his first international goal in a 4–3 win in a World Cup qualifier against Belarus, in Parma. Lippi considered him a starter, often in tandem with Luca Toni.\n\nGilardino was a member of the 23-man Italy squad that won the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He played in the first two matches, scoring a goal in his nation's second group match, a 1–1 draw against the United States, with a diving header off a free kick by Andrea Pirlo; He came on as a substitute in the semifinal match against hosts Germany, hitting the post in extra time; in the last minute of the second half of extra time, he provided the assist for Alessandro Del Piero's goal two minutes after the first goal, sealing the \"Azzurri's\" 2–0 victory, which earned them a place in the final; Italy subsequently defeated France 5–3 on penalties in the final, following a 1–1 draw after extra time.\n\nOn 17 October 2007, Gilardino assumed the team captaincy for the first time in his international career after Daniele De Rossi was substituted during Italy's 2–0 friendly win over South Africa. Because of his negative 2007–08 season with the \"Rossoneri\", which ended with a miserly 7 goals in 30 appearances, Gilardino was not selected for Euro 2008 by coach Roberto Donadoni.\n\nGilardino returned to the national team on 20 August 2008 following Lippi's reappointment on the \"Azzurri\" bench. He marked his return to the national side by scoring the first of Italy's two goals at the end of the first half in an international friendly against Austria, which ended in a 2–2 draw.\n\nIn June 2009, Marcello Lippi called Gilardino up for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa. Gilardino played a friendly match against New Zealand in Pretoria, South Africa days before Italy's first match, netting two goals and displaying a wonderful performance. However, the Italian team was eliminated in the first round of the Confederations Cup after a loss to Brazil.\n\nOn 10 October 2009, Gilardino scored what he described at the time as the most important goal of his career, after scoring the equalising goal in the 89th minute of a 2–2 away draw against Ireland; this enabled Italy to qualify for the 2010 World Cup as group winners, to try to defend their 2006 title.\n\nOn 14 October 2009, Gilardino scored a hat-trick in the final 13 minutes of the game against Cyprus to cap a 3–2 victory for Italy, allowing the team to overturn the double disadvantage and win the game.\n\nGilardino was part of the Italian 2010 FIFA World Cup squad. He started Italy's first game on the group stage against Paraguay, which ended in a 1–1 draw. The tournament was a disaster for Italy and the team was eliminated in the group stage.\n\nAfter the embarrassment that was the 2010 World Cup, Cesare Prandelli was chosen as Italy's new coach. On 7 September 2010, Gilardino scored the first goal in the 5–0 victory against the Faroe Islands in the second qualification match for Euro 2012. On 29 March 2011, Gilardino was made captain in a friendly match between Ukraine-Italy (0–2) held in Kiev, 30 years since a Fiorentina player (Giancarlo Antognoni) last held the Azzurri captaincy.\nAs result of his good form after his arrival at Bologna, Gilardino was called back to the national team, alongside his teammate Alessandro Diamanti. On 7 October 2012, after an absence of over a year, Gilardino was called up again for the 2014 World Cup qualifying matches against Armenia and Denmark. On 6 February, in the friendly against the Netherlands, Gilardino came on as a sub in the final minutes, providing an assist for Marco Verratti's equaliser. On 31 May 2013, Gilardino scored a goal in Azzurri's 4–0 victory against San Marino.\n\nAfter the positive performance against San Marino, Gilardino was called up for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil by Prandelli on 3 June 2013. He came on for Mario Balotelli in the second half for the first group match against Mexico on 16 June. After Balotelli's injury, Gilardino took his place for all of Italy's subsequent matches, including the semi-final against Spain, and the victorious third place match against Uruguay.\n\nOn 6 September 2013, as Mario Balotelli and Pablo Daniel Osvaldo were suspended, Gilardino made the starting eleven for the match against Bulgaria, qualifying for the 2014 World Cup, his first half goal sealing a 1–0 win for the \"Azzurri\". This goal helped Gilardino to overtake Roberto Bettega on the all-time leading scorers' list of the Italian national team, and made him the first Genoa player to score a goal for the \"Azzurri\" since Riccardo Carapellese scored in the match against France on 12 February 1956.\n\nA quick, agile, hard-working, and prolific forward with an excellent positional sense, who is skilled in the air, both with his head and acrobatically, due to his height, Gilardino plays mainly as a striker who prefers to be served in the penalty area. This position allows him to leverage his skills, timing, opportunism, and ability to score goals and finish off chances by getting on the end of his teammates' crosses. Possessing good technique and an eye for goal, he is capable of shooting first time, but is also known for his ability to use his skills and strength to protect the ball and to defend himself with his back to goal; he often uses this ability to provide depth to his team, holding up the ball and subsequently laying it off for teammates, providing them with assists. Gilardino is naturally right-footed, but in his early years at Parma, he was able to improve his ability with his left foot.\n\nGilardino is close friends with former Milan teammate Daniele Bonera; they were also teammates at Parma. Gilardino once dedicated one of his goals to Daniele's baby daughter Talitha. Besides his goal-scoring, he is well-remembered for his goal celebration as well – getting on his knees and \"playing the violin\" at the touchline in front of the fans. He became engaged to Alice Bregoli on 31 March 2006 and had their first baby, a girl named Ginevra, on 2 March 2008. The couple were wed on 5 July 2009 at La Cervara Abbey in Santa Margherita Ligure, in the province of Genoa. Their second daughter, named Gemma, was born on 19 March 2011, while their third daughter, Giulia, was born on 4 September 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Less commonly, it may also refer to certain other regional forms of English, in particular those of Scotland or the English West Country. However, traditionally Scottish and West Country accents were called burrs due to the rolling of the R's not brogues.\n\nThe word was first recorded in 1689. Multiple etymologies have been proposed: it may derive from the Irish \"bróg\" (\"shoe\"), the type of shoe traditionally worn by the people of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands, and hence possibly originally meant \"the speech of those who call a shoe a 'brogue'\". It is debated that the term comes from the Irish word \"barróg\", meaning \"a hold (on the tongue)\", thus \"accent\" or \"speech impediment\". \n\n"}
{"id": "1868978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868978", "title": "SLOSS debate", "text": "SLOSS debate\n\nThe SLOSS debate was a debate in ecology and conservation biology during the 1970's and 1980's as to whether a single large or several small (SLOSS) reserves were a superior means of conserving biodiversity in a fragmented habitat. Since its inception, multiple alternate theories have been proposed. There have been applications of the concept outside of the original context of habitat conservation.\nIn 1975, Jared Diamond suggested some \"rules\" for the design of protected areas, based on Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson's book \"The Theory of Island Biogeography\". One of his suggestions was that a single large reserve was preferable to several smaller reserves whose total areas were equal to the larger.\n\nSince species richness increases with habitat area, as established by the species area curve, a larger block of habitat would support more species than any of the smaller blocks. This idea was popularised by many other ecologists, and has been incorporated into most standard textbooks in conservation biology, and was used in real-world conservation planning. This idea was challenged by Wilson's former student Daniel Simberloff, who pointed out that this idea relied on the assumption that smaller reserves had a \"nested\" species composition — it assumed that each larger reserve had all the species presented in any smaller reserve. If the smaller reserves had unshared species, then it was possible that two smaller reserves could have more species than a single large reserve.\n\nSimberloff and Abele expanded their argument in subsequent paper in the journal \"The American Naturalist\" stating neither ecological theory nor empirical data exist to support the hypothesis that subdividing a nature reserve would increase extinction rates, basically negating Diamond as well as MacArthur and Wilson. Bruce A. Wilcox and Dennis D. Murphy responded with a key paper \"Conservation strategy - effects of fragmentation on extinction\" pointing out flaws in their argument while providing a comprehensive definition of habitat fragmentation. Wilcox and Murphy also argued that habitat fragmentation is probably the major threat to the loss of global biological diversity.\n\nThis helped set the stage for fragmentation research as an important area of conservation biology. The SLOSS debate ensued as to the extent to which smaller reserves shared species with one another, leading to the development of \"nested subset theory\" by Bruce D. Patterson and Wirt Atmar in the 1980s and to the establishment of the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) near Manaus, Brazil in 1979 by Thomas Lovejoy and Richard Bierregaard. \n\nIn 1986, Michael E. Soulé and Daniel Simberloff proposed that the SLOSS debate was irrelevant and that a three step process was the ideal way to determine reserve size. The proposed steps were to firstly decide the species whose presence was most important to the reserves biodiversity, secondly, decide how many of the species were required for the species to survive, and lastly, based on other metapopulation densities, estimate how much space is needed to sustain the required number of individuals.\n\n\nThe purpose of the debate itself is in regards to conservation planning and is currently used in most spacial allotment planning. \n\nThe SLOSS debate has come in to play in urban planning concerning green spaces with considerations extending beyond biodiversity to human well being. The concept can also be applied to other aspects of city planning.\n\nThe general consensus of the SLOSS debate is that neither option fit every situation and that they must all be evaluated on a case to case basis in accordance to the conservation goal to decide the best course of action.\n\nIn the field of metapopulation ecology, modelling works suggest that the SLOSS debate should be refined and cannot be solved without explicit spatial consideration of dispersal and environmental dynamics. In particular, a large number of small patches may be optimal to long-term species persistence only if the species range increases with the number of patches.\n\nIn conservation biology and conservation genetics, metapopulations (i.e. connected groups of sub-populations) are considered to be more stable if they are larger, or have more populations. This is because although individual small populations may go extinct due to stochastic processes of environment or biology (such as genetic drift and inbreeding), they can be recolonized by rare migrants from other surviving populations. Thus several small populations could be better than a single large: if a catastrophe wipes out a single big population, the species goes extinct, but if some regional populations in a large metapopulation get wiped out, recolonization from the rest of the metapopulation can ensure their eventual survival. In cases of habitat loss, when the loss is dispersed, few large reserves are best, when the loss is in clusters, multiple small reserves are best.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1868983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868983", "title": "Bromide", "text": "Bromide\n\nA bromide is a chemical compound containing a bromide ion or ligand. This is a bromine atom with an ionic charge of −1 (Br); for example, in caesium bromide, caesium cations (Cs) are electrically attracted to bromide anions (Br) to form the electrically neutral ionic compound CsBr. The term \"bromide\" can also refer to a bromine atom with an oxidation number of −1 in covalent compounds such as sulfur dibromide (SBr).\n\nBromide is present in typical seawater (35 PSU) with a concentration of around 65 mg/L, which is around 0.2% of all dissolved salts. Seafoods and deep sea plants generally have high levels of bromide, while foods derived from land have variable amounts. Bromargyryte - natural, crystalline silver bromide - is the most common bromide mineral currently known, but is still very rare. Beside silver, bromine is sometimes found in minerals combined with mercury and copper.\n\nOne can test for a bromide ion by adding excess dilute HNO followed by dilute aqueous AgNO solution. The formation of creamy silver bromide precipitate confirms the existence of bromides.\n\nBromide compounds, especially potassium bromide, were frequently used as sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Their use in over-the-counter sedatives and headache remedies (such as Bromo-Seltzer) in the United States extended to 1975, when bromides were withdrawn as ingredients, due to chronic toxicity.\n\nThis use gave the word \"bromide\" its colloquial connotation of a boring cliché, a bit of conventional wisdom overused as a calming phrase, or verbal sedative.\n\nThe bromide ion is antiepileptic, and bromide salts are still used as such, particularly in veterinary medicine. Bromide ion is excreted by the kidneys. The half-life of bromide in the human body (12 days) is long compared with many pharmaceuticals, making dosing difficult to adjust (a new dose may require several months to reach equilibrium). Bromide ion concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are about 30% of those in blood, and are strongly influenced by the body's chloride intake and metabolism.\n\nSince bromide is still used in veterinary medicine (particularly to treat seizures in dogs) in the United States, veterinary diagnostic labs can routinely measure blood bromide levels. However, this is not a conventional test in human medicine in the U.S., since there are no FDA-approved uses for bromide, and (as noted) it is no longer available in over-the-counter sedatives. Therapeutic bromide levels are measured in European countries like Germany, where bromide is still used therapeutically in human epilepsy.\n\nChronic toxicity from bromide can result in bromism, a syndrome with multiple neurological symptoms. Bromide toxicity can also cause a type of skin eruption. See potassium bromide.\n\nLithium bromide was used as a sedative beginning in the early 1900s, but it fell into disfavor in the 1940s, possibly due to the rising popularity of safer and more efficient sedatives (specifically, barbiturates) and when some heart patients died after using a salt substitute (see lithium chloride). Like lithium carbonate and lithium chloride it was used as treatment for bipolar disorder.\n\nIt has been said that during World War I, British soldiers were given bromide to curb their sexual urges, although this is not well supported by documentation, and has been disputed as an urban myth, because the sedative effects of bromide would have hampered military performance. Lord Dunsany mentions a soldier being given bromide as a sedative for nervous exhaustion and overwork in his play \"Fame and the Poet\" (1919).\n\nThere are more substantiated reports that bromide was used in the food served at some concentration camps during the Holocaust. This was apparently done in an effort to both chemically restrain the interned and prevent menstruation in women.\n\nAccording to one study, bromine (as bromide) is an essential cofactor in the peroxidasin catalysis of sulfilimine crosslinks in collagen IV. This post-translational modification occurs in all animals, and bromine is an essential trace element for humans.\n\nBromide is needed by eosinophils (white blood cells of the granulocyte class, specialized for dealing with multi-cellular parasites), which use it to generate antiparasitic brominating compounds such as hypobromite, by the action of eosinophil peroxidase, a haloperoxidase enzyme which is able to use chloride, but preferentially uses bromide when available. Other than its role in collagen IV production and its facultative use in eosinophils by the body, bromide is not known in other cases necessary for animal life, as its functions may generally be replaced (though in some cases not as well) by chloride. Land plants do not use bromide.\n\nBromide salts are also sometimes used in hot tubs and spas as mild germicidal agents, using the action of an added oxidizing agent to generate \"in situ\" hypobromite, in a similar fashion to the peroxidase in eosinophils.\n\nBromide is perhaps a minor necessary nutrient for collagen IV-producing animals in the sea. However, a few sea animals, such as \"Murex\" snails, use bromide to make organic compounds. Bromide ion is also heavily concentrated by some species of ocean algae, which construct methyl bromide and a great number of bromoorganic compounds with it, using the unusual enzymes called vanadium bromoperoxidases to do these reactions.\n\nThe average concentration of bromide in human blood in Queensland, Australia is and varies with age and gender. Much higher levels may indicate exposure to brominated chemicals (e.g. methyl bromide). However, since bromide occurs in relatively high concentration in seawater and many types of seafood, bromide concentrations in the blood are heavily influenced by seafood contributions to the diet.\n"}
{"id": "1868986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868986", "title": "Bromide (language)", "text": "Bromide (language)\n\nBromide in literary usage means a phrase, cliché, or platitude that is trite or unoriginal. It can be intended to soothe or placate; it can suggest insincerity or a lack of originality in the speaker. When hypostatized and embodied, in which the concept becomes a person, bromide can mean a commonplace or tiresome person, a bore.\n\nA now outdated usage of bromide is a photographic print, stemming from the use of silver bromide in photographic films, emulsions and papers. Its original usage was as a chemical term, referring to bromine salts.\n\nBromide has both literal and figurative meanings. The word originally derives from chemistry in which it can be used to describe a compound containing the element bromine, especially as a salt or bonded to an alkyl radical. Bromine was isolated independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob Löwig (in 1825) and Antoine Jérôme Balard (in 1826) and the first appearance in print of \"bromide\" as a chemical term has been attributed to 1836. \nBy the 1870s silver halides, such as silver bromide, were in commercial use as a photographic medium. Over time, especially in British Commonwealth countries, the word \"bromide\" came to mean a photographic print; exactly when this occurred is not clear. As digital photography replaced chemical-based photography at the end of the 20th century, this usage has declined.\n\nBromine salts were discovered by the mid 19th century to have calming effects on the central nervous system. In 1857 it was first reported in a medical journal that potassium bromide could be used as an anti-epileptic drug. This action derived from the sedative effects that were calming and tranquilizing but not sleep inducing. Its medicinal use grew so widespread in the latter half of that century that single hospitals might use as much as several tons in a year (the dose being a few grams per day per person). American physician Silas Weir Mitchell, considered to be the father of neurology, also reported lithium bromide to be an anticonvulsant and hypnotic in 1870; and later advocated use of all the bromides to calm \"general nervousness.\" Sodium bromide had a narrower range of safety and efficacy but it was an ingredient in remedies such as Bromo-Seltzer that were popular for headaches and hangovers, in part due to the sedative effects.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, \"bromide\" was widely understood in the context of a being a sedative or being sedate. It was then, in April 1906, that American humorist Gelett Burgess (1866-1951) published an essay in \"The Smart Set\", a magazine edited by George Jean Nathan and H. L. Mencken, called \"The Sulphitic Theory\". It was here where Burgess is credited for coining the usage of bromide as a personification of a sedate, dull person who said boring things. In the fall of 1906, he published a revised and enlarged essay in the form of a small book, \"Are You a Bromide?\" (Burgess is also credited for coining the term \"blurb\" at this same time. ) The book's full title was \"Are You a Bromide? Or, The Sulphitic Theory Expounded and Exemplified According to the Most Recent Researches Into the Psychology of Boredom: Including Many Well-known Bromidioms Now in Use\". In these works he labeled a dull person as a \"Bromide\" contrasted with a \"Sulphite\" who was the opposite. Bromides meant either the boring person himself or the boring statement of that person, with Burgess providing many examples.\n\nThis usage persisted through the 20th century into the 21st century. Some well known quotes (or bromides) in current usage that appeared in Burgess' \"Are You a Bromide?\" include:\n\n"}

Originally SS \"Wittekind for the North German Lloyd line, the ship also served as USAT \"Iroquois and USAT \"Freedom\" after being seized by the United States in 1917.\n\nSS \"Wittekind\" was built in Germany for the Bremen–New York service of the Roland Line service of North German Lloyd, and was the sister ship of . In March 1900 \"Wittekind\" was lengthened because her cargo capacity was found lacking. Later that same year, \"Wittekind\" was among the first transports to carry German Empire troops as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance intended to put down the Boxer Rebellion in China. In August 1914, at the start of World War I, the ship was interned at Boston in the neutral United States.\n\nWhen the U.S. entered that conflict in April 1917, \"Wittekind\" was seized and turned over to the United States Shipping Board. Renamed \"Iroquois\", the ship was chartered to the United States Army as a cargo ship after a refit, and, in 1918, was renamed \"Freedom\". In January 1919 the ship was commissioned into the United States Navy, and carried almost 5,000 troops home from Europe before her decommissioning in September. Held in reserve for transport duty, the ship was laid up for five years before being scrapped in 1924.\n\nSS \"Wittekind\" was built by Blohm & Voss of Hamburg for North German Lloyd’s Roland Line, which was a fortnightly steerage and freight service from Bremen to New York. Launched on 3 February 1894, \"Wittekind\"—named for Wittekind (c. 730–808), the Duke of Saxony—and sister-ship \"Willehad\" were the first twin-screw steamers expressly built for North German Lloyd. The new liner sailed on her maiden voyage to Hoboken, New Jersey on 14 April.\n\n\"Wittekind\" and sister-ship \"Willehad\" were both quickly found to be deficient in cargo space, and plans were made to lengthen both vessels (though \"Willehad\" was never lengthened). \"Wittekind\" <nowiki>'</nowiki>s bridge was moved forward and a cargo hatch was installed behind it. After this, the ship was cut into two parts forward of the bridge's new position, and a new section was inserted, which greatly increased the cargo capacity. Sources disagree as to where the procedure was performed with one reporting it was performed at the Seebeck Yard in Germany, while another claims it was done by Tyne Pontoons & Drydock Co., at Newcastle. Wherever the work was performed, it was completed by March 1900.\n\nOn 3 July 1900, \"Wittekind\" sailed from Bremerhaven with as the initial transport ships to depart with troops of Germany’s contribution to the Eight-Nation Alliance intended to put down the Boxer Rebellion in China. \"Wittekind\" remained in naval service as a transport and hospital ship through late October 1901. After her naval service ended, \"Wittekind\" sailed variously to Baltimore, Maryland; Galveston, Texas; Montreal; and ports in South America through mid-1914.\n\nAt sea and headed for Montreal when the United Kingdom declared war on the German Empire, \"Wittekind\" instead headed for Boston and safety in the then-neutral United States. The steamer—carrying a cargo of lead and coal tar products reportedly worth $1,000,000—slipped past British cruiser in a dense fog near Sable Island. \"Wittekind\" <nowiki>'</nowiki>s wireless operator calculated that the ship passed fewer than from \"Essex\". The steamer was interned by the U.S. and her Canadian-bound passengers—18 cabin-, and 305 steerage-class who were not allowed to remain in the United States—were greeted by the Canadian Commissioner of Immigration who was stationed at Boston.\n\n\"Wittekind\" was joined in Boston by sister-ship \"Willehad\"; North German Lloyd line-mates and ; the Hamburg America Line steamers SS \"Amerika\" and ; and Hansa Line freighter . In March 1916, all except \"Kronprinzessin Cecilie\" and \"Ockenfels\" were moved from their waterfront piers to an anchorage across the harbor from the Boston Navy Yard. Daily \"neutrality duty\" by United States Coast Guard harbor tug kept a watchful eye on the ships. Many crew members of the ships eventually went ashore, were processed through immigration, and found employment, while a contingent of musicians from the vessels toured New England, frequently playing at department stores and restaurants, and drawing the ire of the local musicians' union.\n\nAfter the U.S. declared war on Germany, \"Wittekind\" and the other interned ships were seized on 6 April 1917 and handed over to the United States Shipping Board (USSB).\n\nAfter her seizure and refitting, the former liner was chartered to the United States Army as USAT \"Iroquois\". In 1918, her name was again changed, this time to \"Freedom\". On 24 January 1919, \"Freedom\" was acquired by the United States Navy and commissioned the same day, with Lieutenant J. C. C. Holier, USNRF, in command.\n\n\"Freedom\" was assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force, and after overhaul at New York, sailed on a voyage to Saint-Nazaire, France, and embarked troops for return to the United States. The cargo ship made two more voyages to France, each to Brest, with a visit to Norfolk, Virginia, between trips. She returned a total of 4,983 troops on her voyages from France.\n\nShe arrived at Hoboken on 5 September 1919 and was assigned to duty in the 3rd Naval District. \"Freedom\" was decommissioned at New York on 23 September and returned to the USSB the same day. The veteran ship was transferred to the United States Army transport reserve, and was laid up for five years. On 24 February 1924, \"Freedom\" arrived at Baltimore for scrapping.\n\n"}

{"id": "1868995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868995", "title": "Delta State University", "text": "Delta State University\n\nDelta State University (DSU) is a public university in Cleveland, Mississippi, in the Mississippi Delta. DSU is one of eight publicly funded universities in the state.\n\nThe school was established in 1924 by the State of Mississippi, using the facilities of the former Bolivar County Agricultural High School, which consisted of three buildings in Cleveland. On February 19, 1924, Senators William B. Roberts and Arthur Marshall cosponsored Senate Bill No. 236, which established Delta State Teachers College, which Mississippi Governor Henry L. Whitfield signed on April 9, 1924; the bill had been sponsored in the Mississippi House of Representatives by Nellie Nugent Somerville, the first woman to serve in the Mississippi state legislature. The three buildings were Hill Hall, an administration and classroom building, Hardee Hall, a men's dormitory, and Taylor Hall, a women's dormitory.\n\nOn February 14, 1924, James Wesley Broom was appointed president of the college, and the college opened its doors on September 15, 1925. In May 1926, Broom died following complications from an ear infection. William Zeigel was named his successor. The seal of the college was designed in 1928 as a project of an art class.\n\nWorld War II greatly affected the college. Anticipating the war in 1941, the college created a civilian pilot training program. When the war began, 254 Delta State students joined the armed forces. When the war ended, student enrollment at Delta State increased from 185 to 483, aided by the federal program for veterans known as the GI Bill to encourage education.\n\nDuring the 1947 session of the Delta Council, Dean Acheson (Under-Secretary of State in Truman's administration) delivered a speech on campus that unveiled the Marshall Plan. He detailed plans for postwar relief and investment in Europe to help the nations recover from destruction.\n\nIn 1955, the name \"Delta State Teachers College\" was changed to \"Delta State College\". Delta State earned full accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1963. It developed graduate programs, which it opened for admission in 1965. Given graduate program and research development, in 1974 the state legislature authorized the college to be named as the current \"Delta State University\".\n\nIn 1965 Delta State initiated a graduate program (Master of Education in Elementary Education, Elementary Supervision, Guidance, English, History, Math, Music, Social Studies, Business Education, Physical Education, and Science).\n\nFrom 1925 to 1967 the university had a White-only race admission policy. Twelve years after the US Supreme Court decision in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954), ruling that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional and three years after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the state and administration ended racial segregation at DSU. Shirley Antoinette Washington was the first African-American student to enroll at DSU that year.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the university developed an aviation program, which continues.\n\nIn 2005 Delta State assisted evacuees from Hurricane Katrina by opening Hugh White Hall as temporary housing.\n\n\nDelta State University is located on at 1003 W Sunflower Rd (Highway 8 West), in the northwest area of Cleveland, MS, 38733.\n\nAbout 30 percent of students reside in on-campus housing. Delta State provides both men's dormitories and women's dormitories, as well as apartments for married students.\n\nMost of the 64 buildings on campus use a particular brick pattern of yellow, orange, and white bricks. Particularly famous facilities at Delta State University are the large natatorium for holding swimming competitions, the Bologna Performing Arts Center (pictured left) with two theaters (one that seats 1,178, and another that seats 135), and the sound recording studios of the Delta Music Institute.\n\nDelta State has two mascots (one official, one unofficial). Since its inception, Delta State's sports teams have officially been known as the Statesmen because of the role State Rep. Walter Sillers, Jr. played in the location of the school in Cleveland. Sillers was speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives for 20 years. The female teams are called the Lady Statesmen.\n\nHowever, since the late 1980s, the student body has embraced a mascot that depicts a piece of okra wearing boxing gloves and brandishing a fierce expression. The \"Fighting Okra\" grew out of humor among students about the improbability that anyone would find a \"Statesman\" particularly frightening. In the mid-1990s, a student vote was taken, resulting in the university taking on \"The Fighting Okra\" as an unofficial mascot. The \"Fighting Okra\" was featured in the \"Okraphobia\" episode of the Food Network show \"Good Eats\".\n\nThe popularity of \"The Fighting Okra\" grew so much that many myths started on how the mascot came to be, the most popular of these stating there was a stubborn okra plant at first base on the baseball field that grew back every time it was cut. The true origin of the fighting okra mascot was a discussion between basketball and baseball players in the \"Court of Governors\" dormitory. The Statesman mascot was temporarily prohibited from participating in athletic activities after a physical altercation with the Mississippi College's Choctaw mascot at a basketball game. Basketball player Houston Williamson was lamenting the fact that \"Fighting Statesmen\" was not particularly frightening to their opponents. All present agreed that an alternative mascot would have to be mean and green. After a lively discussion and many suggestions, baseball pitcher Bob Black suggested that okra was green, fuzzy, and tough. The DSU baseball team began using the chant \"Okra! Okra! Okra! Okra!\" at DSU basketball games.\n\nDelta State provides an undergraduate curriculum, offering 12 baccalaureate degrees in 42 majors. The university also advances student training through certain fields by providing graduate programs of study for eight master's degrees, the Education Specialist degree, and the Doctor of Education degree.\n\nThe Delta State University Department of Athletics sponsors thirteen intercollegiate sports, competing at the NCAA Division II level. DSU is affiliated with the Gulf South Conference and New South Intercollegiate Swim Conference. The institution competes intercollegiately in men's American football, basketball, baseball, swimming, diving, tennis, soccer, and golf. The women's intercollegiate program consists of basketball, tennis, fast-pitch softball, cross-country, swimming, soccer, cheerleading, and diving.\n\nOne of Delta State's most notable sports coaches was (Lily) Margaret Wade (1912–1995). Wade played on the basketball team for Delta State, but the school dropped the sport when she was 19. The school claimed the sport was \"too strenuous for young ladies\". Wade responded, \"We cried and burned our uniforms but there was nothing else we could do.\" Basketball was revived in 1973, and Wade was asked to coach the team. She coached the women's basketball team to three consecutive AIAW national championships and a 93–4 record, including a 51-game winning streak, at the time, the longest winning streak in women's college basketball. Wade was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1985. Today, the Division I women's basketball player of the year receives the Margaret Wade Trophy.\n\nLloyd Clark, a native of Drew, took over the women's basketball program in 1983. Over the next 19 years he compiled a staggering 494–98 record. In addition, Clark's teams won three NCAA Women's Division II Basketball Championships. During those years, DSU played in the NCAA tournament 16 times, with 11 appearances in the Elite Eight. Clark's 1988–89 team became the first NCAA team to win a National Championship on its home floor. During his career, Clark compiled a record of 206–38 (.845) in Gulf South Conference Games. Lloyd Clark is a member of the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame along with other DSU heroes Margaret Wade, Lusia Harris-Stewart, and former Boston Red Sox pitcher Dave \"Boo\" Ferriss.\n\nFerriss coached the baseball program for nearly thirty years and led them to three appearances in the NCAA Division II College World Series before retiring in 1988. Boo was born in Shaw, Mississippi. San Francisco Giants catcher Eli Whiteside played baseball for the University, as did Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Brent Leach. Matt Miller of the Cleveland Indians also played for the Statesmen.\n\nOne notable would-be baseball player and student who was cut during tryouts was writer John Grisham. In 2008, Grisham returned to the campus to join Ferriss in an evening of baseball tales, raising more than $100,000 for the athletic program.\n\nDelta State alumnus Jeremy Richardson was an NBA player.\n\nDelta State won the 2004 NCAA Division II national baseball championship.\nCoach Mike Kinnison has guided the Statesmen to the 2004 NCAA National title, four College World Series appearances, nine NCAA South Regional appearances (1999–2005, 2007, 2008), 11 GSC West Division titles (1997–2005, 2007, 2008), three NCAA South Regional championships, and four Gulf South Conference titles.\n\nDelta State won the 2000 NCAA Division II national football championship. Delta State's football team won the Gulf South Conference Championship in 1998, 2000, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2014.\nThey were runner-up in the D-2 National Championship in 2010.\nThey were put out in the 4th round of the playoffs in 2011.\n\nDelta State has a fairly large flight school and is also the only university in Mississippi to offer a degree in Commercial Aviation.\n\n\n the DSU fleet of 19 aircraft consists of the following:\n\n\nDSU Flight Operations has two large hangars located at Cleveland Municipal Airport and the Gibson-Gunn Commercial Aviation building on the Delta State Campus.\n\nThere are six student residence halls on campus; three house women, two house men and one is co-ed.\n\nWomen's\n\nMen's\n\nCo-ed\n\nAll residence halls are suite style rooms with bathrooms shared amongst 4 or 6 people. The rooms vary by size. All rooms have beds, desks, chairs, closets and a chest of drawers. Bathrooms all have toilet, shower/tub (some only have shower stall), sink, mirror and cabinets/storage. All rooms have window binds, security doors, 50+ free cable channels along with Ethernet and Wireless Internet access. Foundation hall, Brumby-Castle and Cleveland hall have carpet, the rest have tiled floors.\n\nExceptions\n\nEvery residence hall resident also has unlimited, free use of commercial laundry facilities.\n\nEven though Delta State University has relatively few fraternities and sororities on campus, many students participate in Greek life. Originally, Delta State had only local organizations, such as Delta Alpha Omega or the Cavaliers, which existed until the mid-1960s, when their members joined Kappa Alpha Order and Pi Kappa Alpha respectively. However, the first national social fraternity to charter at Delta State was Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, in 1960. Within the decade, several other chapters of national Greek-letter organizations chartered at Delta State. They are governed by two independent councils—the Interfraternity Council, and the Panhellenic Council.\n\nThe Interfraternity Council is a university-specific governing body that governs four active fraternity chapters, three of which are nationally members of the North American Interfraternity Conference. The fraternities within the council are as follows:\n\nThe Delta State National Pan-Hellenic Council governs the chapters represented in the National Pan-Hellenic Council.\n\nThe Delta State Panhellenic Council is a governing body that governs three sorority chapters.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1868997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868997", "title": "KCWX", "text": "KCWX\n\nKCWX, virtual channel 2 (VHF digital channel 5), is a MyNetworkTV-affiliated television station licensed to Fredericksburg, Texas, United States. Although Fredericksburg is within the Austin DMA, the station is officially assigned by Nielsen to the larger San Antonio market, and its signal covers the San Antonio and Bexar County area. Owned by Austin-based Corridor Television, KCWX maintains offices on South Piedras Drive in northwest San Antonio, and its transmitter is located on the Gillespie–Kendall county line. On cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum channel 4, and Grande Communications and AT&T U-verse channel 2.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on August 3, 2000 as KBEJ. Although nowadays, owners of most TV/radio stations ask for a specific set of calls, the call sign was sequentially assigned within the May 1998 FCC callsign change report. It originally operated as the UPN affiliate for two markets,San Antonio and Austin–a rarity by modern standards. Prior to the station's sign-on, UPN programming had been available in the San Antonio market on KRRT (channel 35, now KMYS) from the network's launch in January 1995 until January 1998, when that station switched to The WB as a result of Sinclair Broadcast Group (which had operated the station at the time, and acquired channel 35 outright three years later)'s affiliation agreement with that network; UPN then was carried during the overnight hours on NBC affiliate KMOL-TV (channel 4, now WOAI-TV). In Austin, the network had been available first on a regional network of low-power stations across Central Texas known as the \"Hill Country Paramount Network\" (HPN), and later on K13VC (channel 13).\n\nPrior to the station's sign-on, Corridor Television entered into a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Belo, then-owners of CBS affiliate KENS (channel 5). KBEJ originally maintained a separate feed for Austin cable providers. Under the LMA with Belo, KBEJ's signal always originated from the company's headquarters in Dallas, but some of its programming was provided by KENS and content decisions were controlled from that station's studios in the city's Mockingbird Hill district. Austin ABC affiliate KVUE (channel 24) provided the microwave link for channel 2's Stonewall transmitter and to Time Warner Cable's Austin system. The station's syndicated programming at the time during the dual-market focus usually consisted of lower-tier and older programs, in order to avoid syndication exclusivity blackouts in either market; after the station began to exclusively target San Antonio, its syndicated inventory has continued to incorporate lower-profile programming somewhat, while the entire overnight schedule has been leased to paid programming distributors to run infomercials. The KENS and KVUE master controls, located in their respective cities, were completely independent from the Dallas campus and KBEJ.\n\nWhen KBEJ first signed on, Time Warner Cable was not willing to place KBEJ on its Austin system, which caused protests from fans of \"\", who were unable to watch the series' final season. This led to many fans downloading illegal copies of the episodes from the Internet or trading taped copies with friends in other cities with a UPN station. Although UPN frowned officially upon this practice, unofficially the network and its parent company, Paramount Pictures, turned a \"blind eye\" in this instance due to the circumstances of the situation. In 2001, Time Warner Cable signed a carriage agreement to transmit KBEJ, allowing cable subscribers in the market to once again be able to view UPN programming.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks' respective programming to create a new \"fifth\" network called The CW. On March 28, Corridor Television signed an agreement to make KBEJ San Antonio's CW affiliate. While the station was also expected to serve as the new network's Austin affiliate, on April 18, it was announced that the market's WB affiliate KNVA (channel 54) would also be joining The CW. On April 7, 2006, the station changed its call letters to KCWX, in order to reflect its new affiliation.\n\nSoon after The CW launched on September 18, 2006, Time Warner Cable began blacking out CW programming on KCWX in the Austin market, as KNVA owner LIN TV Corporation claimed syndication exclusivity for KNVA on October 2. Time Warner continued to carry KCWX's non-network programming until April 3, 2007, when Time Warner Cable officially dropped KCWX from its Austin channel lineup.\n\nDuring its four-year run as a CW affiliate, KCWX aired the network's children's programming blocks, Kids' WB, and later The CW4Kids, in pattern. However, when the affiliation moved to KMYS in September 2010, the block then called \"Toonzai\" (later replaced by \"Vortexx\") was carried by that station over two days, running in a lower profile slot during the early morning hours on Sundays and Mondays, when the block's target audience of children between the ages of 8 and 12 years is usually asleep.\n\nIn Sinclair Broadcast Group's annual report for 2009 that was released in March 2010, the company disclosed that it had signed an affiliation agreement to move the CW affiliation to its San Antonio MyNetworkTV affiliate KMYS on September 1, 2010. The affiliation switch was eventually moved up two days to August 30; on that date, the MyNetworkTV affiliation moved to KCWX. With the then-pending loss of its CW affiliation, Belo terminated its LMA with Corridor Television on April 24, 2010, forcing Corridor to operate KCWX on its own.\n\nKCWX's run as a CW affiliate ended on August 28, 2010, with the conclusion of the network's Friday primetime programming (which the station had delayed to Saturday night to accommodate a Major League Baseball game). By that time, The CW had discontinued its Sunday primetime programming. As a result, KCWX's last official day of its CW affiliation—August 29, 2010—featured mostly time-shifted programming from This TV. With the affiliation switch, \"WWE SmackDown\" briefly returned to KCWX for the first time since 2008 when The CW dropped the program; it moved to the Syfy cable channel one month later. As had been the case during its CW affiliation, KCWX does not serve the Austin market, as KBVO (channel 14) serves as that market's MyNetworkTV affiliate. In early 2011, KCWX launched a new website, www.kcwx.com.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nShortly after KCWX signed on its digital signal, the station launched a second digital subchannel that would serve as the San Antonio affiliate of This TV.\n\nBecause it was granted an original construction permit after the Federal Communications Commission finalized the DTV allotment plan on April 21, 1997 , the station did not receive a companion channel for a digital television station. Instead, on June 12, 2009, which was the end of the digital television conversion period for full-service stations, KCWX was required to turn off its analog signal and turn on its digital signal. The station flash-cut its digital signal into operation on VHF channel 5; as it chose that allocation as its final digital channel selection, it had to wait for CBS affiliate KENS to shut down its analog signal before KCWX could bring its digital signal online, using PSIP to display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 2.\n\nIn late May 2009, in a filing with the FCC, Belo/Corridor stated that it would not have KCWX's digital signal ready to sign-on on June 12, instead expecting it to be ready on July 10 due to weather delays. Cable subscribers continued to view the station via a direct fiber connection of KCWX from KENS to the Time Warner Cable headend. Corridor/Belo was able to negotiate with the tower installer to finish the construction of the tower earlier than expected; KCWX's digital signal finally signed on the air on July 1, 2009. The signal reaches south of San Antonio and southeast to Nixon, north to Lampasas and west to Junction.\n\nSince KCWX operates its digital signal on a low-band VHF channel, KCWX filed with FCC to increase the station's effective radiated power from 23.7 kW to 82.9 kW. It also filed an FCC application to launch two fill-in digital translators that would broadcast on VHF channel 8 and transmit at 300 watts—one in the immediate part of Austin and the other in the immediate part of San Antonio.\n\nOutside of the MyNetworkTV schedule, syndicated programs broadcast by KCWX include \"The Real\", \"The Mel Robbins Show\", \"25 Words or Less\", \"Live PD\" and \"Pawn Stars\" among others. In January 2011, KCWX began airing roller derby matches from the Austin-based TXRD Lonestar Rollergirls, airing for two hours on Saturday nights. The station also carries regular season Major League Baseball games from the Texas Rangers produced by Dallas–Fort Worth independent station KTXA.\n\n"}
