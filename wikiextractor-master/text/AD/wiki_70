The Boeing 737-200 was flying from Hilo, Hawaii to Honolulu, Hawaii, when it experienced rapid decompression when a section of the fuselage was torn away. With one flight attendant blown from the cabin to her death and 65 others injured, the aircraft was able to make a successful emergency landing at Kahului Airport, on Maui.\n\n\"Miracle Landing\" stars Connie Sellecca, Wayne Rogers, Ana Alicia and Nancy Kwan. The film aired February 11, 1990 on CBS and has since been shown in syndication on network broadcasts throughout the world.\n\nIn February 1988, two pilots in a flight simulator face the challenge of landing a crippled jet that experiences a cabin decompression, an engine fire and a loss of hydraulics. The three simulated emergencies foreshadow the events of Paradise Airlines Flight 243, taking place two months later. \n\nThree crew members: Madeleine \"Mimi\" Tompkins (Connie Sellecca), Captain Robert \"Bob\" Schornstheimer (Wayne Rogers) and Flight Attendant Michelle Honda (Ana Alicia) are flying together on Paradise Airlines Flight 243. First Officer pilot Tompkins has been selected for training to become a full Captain in the airline, having been the first female pilot to be hired by Paradise in 1979.\n\nParadise Airlines 243 is an inter-island flight from Honolulu to Hilo, with a return to Honolulu the same day. The flight takes off over Hilo, and soon beverage service begins. During that time, nothing out of the ordinary occurs, but soon after, David Kornberg (Will Estes), a young boy travelling with his mother (Jane Daly), calls the lead flight attendant, C.B. Lansing (Nancy Kwan) and asks her about the crack appearing in the ceiling.\n\nAt that moment, chaos breaks loose and the entire front and top half section of the airliner, apart from the cockpit and cargo hold, blows off in a clean separation. In the chaos, Michelle falls to the floor and clings to a passenger's seat, C.B. is blown from the aircraft off-screen, and passengers are badly injured from debris and decompression. The third flight attendant Jane Sato-Tomita (Patty Toy) is thrown to the cabin floor and sustains serious head injuries, clinging to other passengers to avoid the same fate as C.B. The cockpit crew is unaware of the full scale of the disaster and believe a bomb or decompression has occurred. Soon passengers seated in the section that was not swept away have oxygen masks fall but it is useless as all the lines were destroyed. However, the aircraft was at a low altitude thus it had not affected them as badly. Mimi and Bob contact Kahului Airport to declare an emergency.\n\nSoon, the pilots are faced with the fact they may crash and passengers would die, and both Mimi and Bob have flashbacks to her training days and his US Air Force times, respectively. Michelle has a flashback to walking the shoreline with her father who as a soldier in the Army, has died. Jane's injuries worsen and Michelle struggles to climb to her and help her. Later, she also feels she might lose it from the chaos and picks up the call phone only to find it dead.\n\nDorothy Hendricks (Herta Ware) leans out of the airliner and appears to have a state of shock before her husband George (Jack Murdock) notices and pulls her back inside. Michelle then begins to instruct the passengers on a possible crash landing or water landing and passes out life jackets. Gail Kornberg becomes hysterical when she cannot get a life jacket for David, but soon is calmed by Michelle. Roy Wesler (Glenn Cannon) panics when he sees hydraulic fluid leaking from the wings. The tower alerts Kahului Fire and Rescue personnel and they arrive before the crippled jet lands. Finally after several tense minutes, Mimi and Bob are able to figure out a plan for the emergency.\n\nAfter some time, the airliner lands but with difficulties in the brakes and hydraulics. The pilots were worried that the landing might result in a broken aircraft and fire, but miraculously their landing resulted in no deaths and the emergency notification allowed crews to treat and evacuate passengers immediately.\n\nPrincipal photography for \"Miracle Landing\" took place in Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii. The aircraft used for the movie bearing the colors of the fictitious Paradise Airlines, is a Boeing 737-297CT (Advanced), registered as N70723. At the time, it was owned by Aloha Airlines, the airline involved in the Flight 243 incident. That aircraft was used by WestJet Airlines in Canada until 2002 (re-registered as C-GCWJ).\n\n\"Miracle Landing\" was considered an authentic and accurate portrayal of the Aloha Airlines Flight 243. In his later review, Sergio Ortega said: \"Miracle Landing is one of the most technically accurate air disaster movies ever.\"\n\n\"Miracle Landing\" won the 1990 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Special Visual Effects.\n\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

It was recorded in January 1987, and released on July 6, 1987.\n\n\"In the Dark\" was the band's first album in six years, and its first studio album since 1980's \"Go to Heaven\". It became unexpectedly popular, achieving double platinum certification in the U.S. It reached No. 6 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, the Grateful Dead's only top ten album. The peppy \"Touch of Grey\" peaked at No. 9 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, the band's only top forty single; it also became a frequently played music video on MTV. \"Hell in a Bucket\" and \"Throwing Stones\" (for which videos were also made) also achieved significant album-oriented rock radio airplay.\n\n\"In the Dark\" was recorded between January 6th and 13th, 1987 at Marin Veterans Memorial Auditorium, San Rafael, California, with production by Jerry Garcia and John Cutler. Most of the songs had been played by the Dead since 1982 or 1983, which gave them a five-year edge on perfecting them for the album. After the critically panned \"Go to Heaven\", which contained songs that were mostly under a year old, the maturity of \"In the Dark\" was significantly more appreciated.\n\nSince the band had been playing the songs for some time, they decided to record the baseline tracks for the album in a darkened theater (\"In the Dark\") that was empty (no audience), on a stage with the same lighting as they would use on tour (just to have the band perform in a more comfortable, familiar setting). The idea was to capture the \"feel\" they had for the songs as if they were playing them to a live audience. This was done at Marin Veterans Memorial Auditorium in San Rafael, California.\n\nDrummer Bill Kreutzmann reminisced, \"We ran all the electric instruments through amplifiers in the basement, in isolation rooms, and kept the drums bright and loud on stage. Everything was fed to a recording truck parked outside the venue. Everybody played their parts in real time, together. When we took breaks, we'd go into the wings by the stage door and sit there and talk about what we'd just done. Talking about the music, then going right out to play the music, then talking about it some more was something that we really should've done more often — the analysis served the songs and the camaraderie served the band. It really put us in a good spot.\" \n\nThey then brought these recorded tracks to the studio and, if needed, \"cleaned\" them up, overdubbing them or redoing a guitar, vocal, keyboard, or drum track in the studio using the same riffs they used on the stage recording.\n\nGarcia spoke about the recording in an interview; \"Marin Vets turns out to be an incredibly nice room to record in. There's something about the formal atmosphere in there that makes us work. When we set up at Front Street to work, a lot of times we just sort of dissolve into hanging out. Going in Marin Vets without an audience and playing just to ourselves was in the nature of an experiment...\"\n\n\"In the Dark\" was released on CD in 1987 by Arista Records before being re-released in 2000 by BMG International. It was then remastered, expanded, and released with new cover art as part of the \"Beyond Description (1973–1989)\" 12-CD box set in October 2004. The remastered version was later released separately on CD, on April 11, 2006, by Rhino Records.\n\nThe cover art for the album was designed by Randy Tuten. The lettering forms the shape of an eye. Inside the lettering are photos of the band members' eyes. On the original LP, the photos were right side up, but when the album was released on CD in 1987, the photos were upside down. Though the band joked that the extra eye belonged to the Ayatollah Khomeini, it actually belonged to their long-time promoter, Bill Graham.\n\nNote: \"My Brother Esau\" was omitted from the LP and CD releases of \"In the Dark\", but was included on the cassette and on international releases, as well as the 2004 reissue.\n\n\n\n\nAlbum - \"Billboard\"\nSingles - \"Billboard\"\n"}

In \"Mercury\", the goal is to guide a drop of mercury to its appointed destination by tilting the stage, in a similar fashion to \"Marble Madness\" and \"Super Monkey Ball\". Levels come in different varieties that prioritize different methods of completing each level. The game was conceived when Archer Maclean used a previous minigame from \"Jimmy White's Cueball World\" and added a liquid metal physics. It was originally designed to have motion controls by using a tilt sensor peripheral for the PSP but was never released due to technical constraints. \"Mercury\" was released in North America on April 6, 2005, and in Europe on September 1, 2005.\n\nThe game had received positive reception for its original concept and level designs but had received mixed reception for its difficulty. The game's success led to receiving two sequels. The first, titled \"Mercury Meltdown\", was released for PSP, then revised and ported onto PlayStation 2 and Wii. The second sequel, titled \"Mercury Hg\", was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\n\"Mercury\" is a puzzle video game that takes on similar gameplay to that of \"Marble Madness\". The player can manipulate a droplet of mercury to move in the player's desire direction by tilting the stage using the PSP's analog stick. The player can use the directional buttons to toggle between focusing on all mercury droplets or a single droplet. The objective of each level in the game is to navigate the mercury around the stage and reach the goal. The HUD is made up of a time limit, a mercury level gauge, and a beacon count. To clear a level, all beacons on the level must be activated within that level's time and mercury limit. If the amount of Mercury on the level drops below the limit or time runs out, the level ends and must be restarted.\n\nEach stage has hazards and obstacles designed to reduce the player's amount of mercury. The mercury can also be split into separate parts by using sharp objects or other hazards in the stage. Paint Shops are floating devices that change the color of the mercury once the mercury is under it. Some switches and doors only activate if interacting with mercury of a specific color. If the mercury is split up, the two droplets can be colored differently; if the two then merge, they form a new color. Color mixing is based on the RGB color model. For example, a red droplet and a green droplet can be merged to form a yellow one.\n\nThere is a total of six worlds. Each world is split into three \"Race\" levels, three \"Percentage\" levels, three \"Task\" levels, two \"Combo\" levels, and a final boss level. Race levels prioritize completing the level as fast as possible more than mercury count. Percentage levels emphasize preserving Mercury over quick completion. Task levels will have 1 to 6 beacons that must be activated to clear the level. Combo levels are either a combination of Race and Percentage levels or a combination of Percentage and Task levels. There are is each type of combo level in each world available before the boss. Boss levels are a combination of Race, Percentage, and Task. They are the last levels in each world and completing them will result in unlocking the next available world. If the highest score is achieved in all levels of one particular world, a bonus 13th level is unlocked. After all bonus levels are discovered for each world and also achieve the highest scores, a secret 7th world is unlocked.\n\n\"Mercury\" was developed by Awesome Studios with Archer Maclean as the lead designer for the game. The game was inspired by tilting puzzle games similar to \"Super Monkey Ball\" and \"Marble Madness\". The game was conceived when Archer Maclean used one of the minigames from \"Jimmy White's Cueball World\" and implemented a \"liquid metal physics\" prototype engine. Archer Maclean chose to study the physics of mercury by obtaining a bottle of real mercury taken from barometers. During development, one of the challenges Awesome Studios had was emulating real mercury physics, how the mercury would split and merge. When Awesome Studios was in the play-testing stage of development, the developers noticed potential shortcuts the player can use in the level layouts and adjusted the level design to allow more of them. The game was originally advertised to be released with a tilt sensor peripheral in order to use motion controls, however was unable to be implemented due to cost and technical issues. Archer Maclean chose to release the game on PSP as it could make the game more noticeable for consumers. This led the game to have a tight production schedule to match the launch of the PlayStation Portable, causing the developers to cut corners in the production and resulted in the game to not be as refined as Awesome Studios intended it to be. \"Mercury\" was published by Ignition Entertainment and released in North America on April 6, 2005. The game was distributed by Atari for the European version and was released in Europe on September 1, 2005 as a launch title for the PSP. A limited edition bundle was released with its sequel, \"Mercury Meltdown\" on October 19, 2010.\n\n\"Mercury\" was received well among critics. The game has an aggregated score of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 39 reviews. Common praises for the game was in regards to its level design and physics. \"Eurogamer\" writer praised the level designs, calling them \"ingenious\". \"IGN\" was impressed with the number of levels and the variety between the different designs. \"GameSpot\" writer, in particular, gave compliments towards the physics of the mercury on how it can be stretched, reassemble and squeeze together.\" \"GamesTM\" gave praise to both the physics and level design of the game, stating, \"Mercury's subtle combination of spot-on physics, obvious answers and hidden shortcuts creates a game of continual perfection and frustration alike.\" \"GameSpy\", however, gave a lukewarm response to the level design, stating the best ones are clever and addicting but the worst ones make the player jump through too many hoops. \"Pocket Gamer\" made comparisons to the \"Lumines\" series stating, \"\"Lumines\" is more fun to play, but \"Mercury\" is more satisfying to beat.\" \n\nIn regards to the difficulty, the game had mixed reception. \"GamesTM\" stated, \"If the PSP wasn't so fragile, we'd have thrown it on the floor because of \"Mercury\"s difficulty.\" \"PALGN\" made noted the difficulty of the game can scale to \"ridiculous levels\" but defended it by assuring that it doesn't feel impossible.\" \"GameSpot\" noted that the game wasn't impossible even at its most difficult, however, criticized the difficulty pacing, stating \"The game pretty much throws you off the deep end almost immediately after you've completed the idiotically simple tutorial.\" \"Edge\", however, praised the difficulty, stating, \"Mercury exhibits a perfect hierarchy of challenge and reward, the two remaining poised throughout and ultimately growing to the point where they touch and become one. The pain becomes the pleasure because, in spite of the extraordinary degree of trial and, there's never a moment that feels broken or exploitative.\"\n\n\"Archer Maclean's Mercury\" inspired two sequels for the game. The first sequel, titled \"Mercury Meltdown\", was released PSP. The game features new puzzles and modes, as well as a more vibrant and cartoon-like style of graphics. The game was ported to the PlayStation 2 titled \"Mercury Meltdown Remix\" and to the Wii called \"Mercury Meltdown Revolution\".\n\nA second sequel titled, \"Mercury Hg\", was developed by Eiconic Games for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The game adds in 60 new levels, an online leaderboard, and a music feature that allows the mercury blob and stage to pulsate to the player's music. The game was announced in E3 2011. Eiconic chose to go back to the core elements of the original and added a style in which the developers described as \"clean and stylish\". Ignition Entertainment released the game on September 28, 2011. The game also features ghost racing, the ability to share replays, and Sixaxis tilt controls for the PlayStation 3 version. Two downloadable content (DLC) packages were released for the game. The first DLC titled \"Heavy Elements\" was released on October 19, 2011, and contains thirty discovery mode levels, ten bonus levels, and five challenges levels. The second DLC titled \"Rare Earth Elements\" was released on November 29, 2011, and contains the same amount of content as the previous. \"Mercury Hg\" received an aggregated score of 74 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 14 reviews.\n"}

{"id": "2278210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278210", "title": "Linda Schele", "text": "Linda Schele\n\nLinda Schele (October 30, 1942 – April 18, 1998) was an expert in the field of Maya epigraphy and iconography. She played an invaluable role in the decipherment of much of the Maya hieroglyphs. She produced a massive volume of drawings of stelae and inscriptions, which, following her wishes, are free for use to scholars. In 1978, she founded the annual \"Maya Meetings\" at The University of Texas at Austin.\n\nShe was from Hendersonville, TN, a northern suburb of Nashville. Her mother Ruby Richmond was active in historic preservation at Historic Rock Castle in the 1980s.\n\nBorn in Nashville, Tennessee, Linda Schele began taking commercial art courses at the University of Cincinnati in 1960 and graduated in Education and Art in 1964. With an increasing interest in literature, she spent another four years in Cincinnati's graduate program and obtained her master's degree in Art in 1968. She married the architect David Schele in 1968, and started teaching Studio Art at the University of South Alabama, remaining there till 1980, by which time she was Professor.\n\nIn 1970 she traveled with her husband, David Schele, to photograph Mesoamerican monuments in Yucatán on behalf of the University. An obligatory visit to Palenque the next summer turned into a 12-day stay spent drawing and studying Maya architecture after she was fascinated by the art. She decided to investigate the culture and history of the ancient people who had created the city.\n\nMentored by Merle Greene Robertson, Schele worked with Peter Mathews to decipher a major section of the list of Palenque kings, presenting her work in the 1973 conference \"Mesa Redonda de Palenque\", organized by Robertson. This meeting established the previously unknown Linda as a major figure in the Maya studies, not only of art and history, but also of dirt archaeology and epigraphy, and her work stimulated several later discoveries, by herself and others. In 1975, Schele was invited to the Second International Archaeoastronomy Conference at Colgate to present an exploratory paper on Palenque hierophanies and their link to emblem and skull variant glyphs, which she later published in 1977.\n\nA strong supporter of collaborative scholarship, Schele became a Fellow in pre-Columbian Studies at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C. in 1975. Alongside Peter Mathews; David Kelley; and one of her longtime mentors, Floyd Lousbury, she participated in a series of miniconferences at Dumbarton Oaks which pushed further developing and refining of the Palenque series and also opened new epigraphic frontiers. She focused on the study of word ordering in Maya inscriptions for the next two years there.\n\nStill attending graduate school, Schele founded the Maya Hieroglyphic Workshop in Texas in 1977 which consisted of 21 consecutive seminars concerning Maya hieroglyphic writing and introduced more people intrigued by the Maya field than many other books from that time that were considered \"popular\". Twenty years later, the workshop expanded into what is known as the Maya Meetings at Texas, and includes a symposium of research papers by major scholars and the Forum on Hieroglyphic Writing.\n\nBy this time in her life, Schele realized her destiny as a Mayanist; she enrolled as a graduate student in Latin American Studies at the University of Texas shortly before resigning from her position at South Alabama. She was awarded a Doctorate in Latin American studies by the University of Texas in 1980. She continued her teaching career there, in the department of Art/Art History. At the time of her death, she was the John D. Murchison Regents Professor of Art in the department.\n\nSchele joined the \"Copán Mosaics Project\" in the mid 1980s, working with David Stuart, Barbara Fash, and Nikolai Grube on the texts of that site. In 1986, Schele and Stuart identified Copan’s dynastic founder, K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo’. Shortly after, she began a related series called the \"Copán Notes\", reports on epigraphy and iconography, which were aimed at rapid dissemination of information amongst Maya scholars.\n\nIn 1986, Schele co-curated a ground breaking exhibition and catalog of Maya art, \"The Blood of Kings: A New Interpretation of Maya Art\", with Mary Miller, a project initiated by InterCultura and the Kimbell Art Museum, where it opened in 1986, and the two co-authored the catalog to the exhibition, which was published under the title \"The Blood of Kings: Dynasty and Ritual in Maya Art\". The exhibition spoke of an obsession with royal descent, of incessant warfare, and of bloody sacrifice and self-mutilation which was inconsistent with the models proposed by previous generations of Mayanists. According to Michael D. Coe, the catalog presented by Schele and Miller \"might as well stand as the most influential book on the Maya published in the past half-century.\" \n\nShe also began taking an interest in the culture of the contemporary Maya. For a decade beginning 1988, she organized 13 workshops, along with Nikolai Grube and Frederico Fahsen, on hieroglyphic writing for them in Guatemala and Mexico.\n\nMichael D. Coe claims that \"Linda's most important contribution to Maya scholarship\" is represented in her book \"Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman's Path\" published in 1993 with David Freidel and Joy Parker.\n\nOn April 18, 1998, she died of pancreatic cancer, aged fifty-five. Upon being diagnosed with this disease, Schele planned ahead knowing she would not have long to live and resumed her lectures until a few days before her passing. Just before her death, she established the Linda Schele Precolumbian Endowment, which provides financial support for the Linda and David Schele Chair in Mesoamerican Art and Writing at UT Austin.\n\nHer doctoral dissertation, \"Maya Glyphs: the Verbs\" was published in 1982 and won \"The Most Creative and Innovative Project in Professional and Scholarly Publication\" an award given by the Professional and Scholarly Publishing Division of the Association of American Publishers. \"The Blood of Kings\" was awarded the Alfred H. Barr Jr. Award of the College Art Association for the best exhibition catalogue of 1986. She was awarded diplomas of recognition of the \"Museo Popol Vuh\" and the \"Universidad Francisco Marroquin\" by the government of Guatemala in March 1998.\n\nThe Texas Notes were informal reports produced by Linda Schele and others between 1990 and 1997 to allow for the quick dissemination of results in the rapidly evolving field of Maya epigraphy. Available online at The University of Texas Digital Repository, the notes authored (or co-authored) by Schele are listed here.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2278221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278221", "title": "Enlisted Performance Report", "text": "Enlisted Performance Report\n\nAn Enlisted Performance Report (EPR) is an evaluation form used by the United States Air Force. Instructions for constructing an EPR appear in chapter 3 of Air Force Instruction 36-2406: \"Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems\". The EPR replaced the Airman Performance Report (APR) in the late 1980s.\n\nThe USAF commissioned officer equivalent is the Officer Performance Report (OPR). The United States Navy equivalent is the Fitness Report (FITREP). The United States Army equivalent is the Enlisted Evaluation Report (EER).\n\n\nAn EPR evaluates the performance of an enlisted member both on and off duty. The period of time covered by the EPR is normally no less than 120 days and no longer than 365 days. EPRs are normally written by the member's supervisor with additional input provided by their supervisor's supervisor.\n\nAlthough the bulk of the evaluation is focused on their duty (job) performance, enlisted members are also evaluated on their off-duty performance in areas such as volunteerism and continuing education. This is arguably the biggest difference between the Air Force EPR and civilian counterparts.\n\nPersonnel who have left the Air Force and are seeking jobs in the civilian world will sometimes use EPRs to augment their résumé.\n\nStratification is the \"rack-and-stack\" process senior raters use to identify their top promotion-eligible master sergeants and senior master sergeants. Senior raters are limited to stratifying the top 10 percent of their master sergeant promotion-eligible Airmen and the top 20 percent of their senior master sergeant promotion-eligible Airmen. Promotion-eligible senior NCOs who are not stratified will have their evaluations close out at the deputy evaluator (first O-6) or intermediate evaluator (unit commander) level. Only those who are stratified will have their evaluation signed/closed out by the senior evaluator (senior rater).\n\nStratification statements must be stated in quantitative terms (#1 of 125 MSgts) and will be based on the number of peers (in the same grade as the ratee) assigned within the evaluator's rating scheme. Stratification statements on all other performance reports, to include CMSgt reports, are strictly prohibited.\n\nCommander and senior enlisted members level up in their stage of professionalism through a complex point setting criteria that steers performance promotions. The point system and acquired testing baseline scores are gathered into a final summary score that can be adjusted on likeability, quarterly dorm room awards, and cookie bake-off volunteering. The process was developed through the AFI 39-1906, select Enron survey processes, and the Morgan Price home mortgage rating system. \n\nIn 2014/2015 reports were changed to close out on the same date every year and change of reporting official reports were eliminated.\n\n\nOn 12 July 2007 the Air Force announced a major overhaul of the content of the EPR and OPR reports in an effort to decrease the time required to accomplish the report. EPR narrative comments were significantly reduced and performance assessment areas now reflect the increased responsibility Airmen are charged with as they progress in rank. A section on physical fitness was added, with those scoring less than 75 receiving a referral report. Another new feature of the EPR is the ratee's signature as well as the use of digital signatures using the Common Access Card (CAC).\n\nThe implementation dates of the new versions were as follows:\n\n\nThe format for entries in the Enlisted Performance Report continues to be the \"bullet statement format\".\n\nOn 1 January 2014 a revised AFI and slightly revised EPR forms were released adding organizational climate to the listed of items to consider in the Primary/Additional Duties section.\n\nStarting November 2014, static -or fixed - annual close out dates will be used for each rank tied to regular Air Force (RegAF) promotion eligibility cut-off dates (PECD). The static dates will enable the implementation of the forced distribution and restricted stratification policy and result in more accurate, useful performance-based evaluations. The new reports will include a section for promotion recommendations that will curb inflation through forced distribution and stratification restrictions.\n\nThe EPR system has come under heavy criticism from all ranks in the Air Force. The primary complaint is that the system has become inflated. While technically the 1 through 5 scale is supposed to award an \"average\" performer a 3 and the 5 should be reserved for members that are \"Truly Among the Best\", the practice has been that nearly all personnel receive a 5 unless there are major disciplinary problems. The 2010 SSgt promotion cycle statistics show that the average eligible SrA received 128.79 points from a possible 135 from their EPR ratings, meaning the average eligible tester received one \"4\" and two \"5\" ratings. A cause may be that there is no additional guidance on the definition of a truly stellar member, and the deciding factor is most often other portions of WAPS testing, where performance is meant to be rated.\n\n\n"}

Campaigns generally refer to broader strategic operations conducted over a large bit of territory and over a long period of time. Battles generally refer to short periods of intense combat localised to a specific area and over a specific period of time. However, use of the terms in naming such events is not consistent. For example, the First Battle of the Atlantic was more or less an entire theatre of war, and the so-called battle lasted for the duration of the entire war.\n\nThe Western Front comprised the fractious borders between France, Germany, and the neighboring countries. It was infamous for the nature of the fight that developed there; after almost a full year of inconclusive fighting, the front had become a giant trench line stretching from one end of Europe to the other.\n\n1914\n\n\nThe Battle of Liège was the first battle of the war, and could be considered a moral victory for the allies, as the heavily outnumbered Belgians held out against the German Army for 12 days. From 5–16 August 1914, the Belgians successfully resisted the numerically superior Germans, and inflicted surprisingly heavy losses on their aggressors. The German Second Army, comprising 320,000 men, crossed into neutral Belgium in keeping to the Schlieffen Plan, with the ultimate goal of attacking France from the north. Liège was key strategically as it held a position at the head of a pass through the Ardennes, which made it the best possible route into the heart of Belgium itself.\n\nThe city was surrounded by a ring of 12 heavily armed forts, garrisoned by 70,000 men under the command of Gérard Leman. A night attack on 5 August was repulsed with heavy losses to the Germans, to the extreme surprise of the supremely confident German army. The next day, rather than confront the forts in battle, the German commander Erich Ludendorff attacked the city through the back, through a break in the line of fortresses that the Belgians had intended to fortify, but never did so. Although they succeeded in capturing the city, the Germans knew that they could not continue advancing troops into Belgium without first breaking down the forts. Aided by 17-inch Howitzers, the Germans finally succeeded in bringing down the forts on 16 August.\n\nThe unprecedented Belgian resistance seriously prolonged the opening German assault at the outbreak of World War I, allowing France and Britain time to organize themselves and a defense of Paris. In addition, it was an important moral victory for the Allies.\n\nThe early French initiative, to capture territory lost to the Germans in the 1870–1871 Franco-Prussian War, which France started, was played out in a series of frontier battles between the Germans and the French, known collectively as the Battle of the Frontiers. The battles at Mulhouse, Lorraine, the Ardennes, Charleroi, and Mons were launched more or less simultaneously, and marked the collision of the German and French war plans, the Schlieffen Plan and Plan XVII, respectively.\n\nThe Battle of Mülhausen was the opening attack by the French against the Germans. The battle was part of a French attempt to conquer the province of Alsace, which had been lost as a consequence of having lost the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, as it had a majority of ethnic Germans. A French force under General Louis Bonneau detached from the French First Corps and invaded the frontier on August 8, 1914. Opposing them was the German 7th Division. The capture of the area, preordained by the French Plan XVII, was to boost national pride—and to provide a guard force for the flank of subsequent invasions.\n\nThe French quickly captured the border town of Altkirch with a bayonet charge. Bonneau, suspicious of the little German resistance, was wary of a carefully planned German trap. However, under orders the next day he advanced to Mülhausen, capturing it with little effort, for the Germans had already abandoned it.\n\nIn France, the conquering of the German city Mülhausen, without a fight, was celebrated greatly. However, with the arrival of German reserves from Straßburg, the tides were turned, and the Germans mounted a counter-attack on nearby Cernay. Unable to mount an all-encompassing defense, and unable to call on reserves of his own, Bonneau began a slow withdrawal from the region. Support troops hastily sent by the French commander-in-chief Joseph Joffre arrived too late to prevent Bonneau from retiring. Joffre was immensely angry with Bonneau, charging him with a \"lack of aggression\" and immediately relieving him of command. Realizing the psychological magnitude of the loss, he assembled a force, led by Paul Pau, which tried unsuccessfully to recapture the province.\n\n\nThe invasion and recapture of Lorraine formed one of the major parts of the French pre-war strategy, Plan XVII. The loss of Lorraine (and Alsace; see above) to the Prussians in the 1870-1871 Franco-Prussian War was seen as a national humiliation by the public and military alike, and was at the forefront of their minds for the next war against the Germans.\n\nThe battle was initiated by the French First and Second armies. The First, led by General Auguste Dubail, intended to take Sarrebourg, whilst the Second, led by General Noel de Castelnau, intended to take Morhange. Both towns were well fortified, and the task of defending them fell to Crown Prince Rupprecht, who had overall control of the German Sixth and Seventh armies.\n\nRupprecht adopted a strategy in which he would fall back under the French attacks, then counter-attack once he lured the French all the way to his fortifications. As the French army advanced, it met stern resistance in the form of German artillery and machine-gun fire. Army Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke authorized a more aggressive tactic soon after, and on August 20, the German army started to roll back the French. Caught by surprise and without the assistance of entrenched positions, the Second Army was pushed back quickly, eventually into France itself. A gap was exposed between the forces in Mulhouse and those in Lorraine; the forces in Mulhouse were withdrawn to keep the gap from being taken advantage of by the Germans.\n\nDiverging from the Schlieffen Plan, Rupprecht received reinforcements and attacked the French line near the Trouée de Charmes; however, through the use of reconnaissance aircraft, the French spotted the German buildup, and were able to build an adequate defence. Thus the German gains were minimized, and were eradicated by a following French counter-assault on the 25th. Fighting continued there until the end of August, and quickly ground into a stalemate and trench warfare.\n\nThe Battle of Ardennes, fought between 21 and 23 August 1914, was another of the early frontier battles, conducted during the first month of the war. The battle was sparked by the mutual collision of French and German invasion forces in the lower Ardennes Forest.\n\nThe pre-war French strategy expected German forces in the area to be light, and the French light, rapid firing artillery was expected to convey an advantage in forested terrain over the bigger German guns. Instead, it became increasingly apparent to all of the commanders in the region that a significant enemy presence was gathering, for the Germans had planned an offensive through the area.\n\nThe sets of armies joined battle on both sides. General Pierre Ruffey's Third Army to the south and Fernand de Langle de Cary's Fourth Army to the north, fighting Germany's Fourth, led by Duke Albrecht, and Fifth army, led by Crown Prince Wilhelm.\n\nThe German troops started moving through the forest on 19 August. Conditions worsened, and by the time the two armies met, the forest was covered in a deep fog, resulting in the two forces stumbling into one another. At first, the French took the Germans as a light screening force; however, in reality the French were heavily outnumbered. The first day of the battle consisted of light skirmishes; the main battle did not begin until 21 August.\n\nAccording to the pre-war French strategy document, Plan XVII, German forces in the area were only expected to be light, with French light, rapid-firing artillery proving advantageous in a wooded terrain such as that found in the Ardennes. However, what emerged was totally opposite; the French eagerly charged at German positions in the woods, and were mowed down by machine-gun fire. The French armies retreated hurriedly in the face of superior German tactical positioning, and the Germans chased them all the way back into the French border. In addition to losing a key strategic position, the French forfeited iron resources in the region as well.\n\nThe Battle of Charleroi, another of the frontier battles, was an action taking place 12–23 August 1914. The battle was joined by the French Fifth Army, advancing north towards the River Sambre, and the German Second and Third armies, moving southwest through Belgium. The Fifth army was meant to join the Third and Fourth armies in their attack through the Ardennes. However, this plan was put into effect assuming the Germans were not considering an assault further north, through Belgium—which was the German plan all along. Charles Lanrezac, commander of the Fifth Army, was strongly against the idea, fearing an attack from the north. However Joseph Joffre, chief-of-staff, rejected any such idea; after much persuasion, Lanrezac finally convinced him to move the Fifth Army northwards.\n\nHowever, by the time the Fifth Army arrived, units of the German Second Army were already in the area. Joffre authorized an attack across the Sambre, predicting that the German force had 18 divisions, comparable to Lanrezac's 15, plus another 3 British reinforcements (the British Expeditionary Force). However, Lanrezac predicted much higher numbers, closer to the actual number—32 German divisions. He preferred to wait for reinforcements, however that same day the Germans attacked across the river and established two beachheads, neither of which fell despite several French counterattacks.\n\nThe next day, the main attack began; the fighting carried on through the day, and into the next. The French centre suffered severe losses and retreated; but the west and east flanks both held their ground. However, the retreat of cavalry divisions to the far west exposed the French west flank. With news of his situation, and the fact that his flanks could give and be completely enwrapped, Lanrezac ordered a general retreat into northern France.\n\nThe French town of Maubeuge was a major fort on the French side of the border. With a junction of no fewer than five major railway lines, it was recognized as a key strategic position by both sides; hence the construction of 15 forts and gun batteries ringing it, a total of 435 guns, and a permanent garrison of 35,000 troops. These were further bolstered by the choosing of the town as the advance base of the British Expeditionary Force. However, when these and the French Fifth Army retreated following the events at Charleroi, the town was cut off from allied support, and subsequently besieged on August 25. The German heavy artillery succeeded in demolishing the key forts around the city, and General Joseph Anthelme Fournier, in command of the garrison in the city, surrendered to the Germans some 13 days later.\n\n1914\n\n\n1915\n\n1916\n\n1917\n\n1918\n\n\n1914\n1915\n1916\n\n1917\n1918\n\n1916\n\n1917\n\n\n\nThe Gallipoli Campaign (also called the \"Dardanelles Campaign\"), was a number of battles fought between 1915 and 1916.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld War I was the first war to see major use of planes for offensive, defensive and reconnaissance operations, and both the Entente Powers and the Central Powers used planes extensively. Almost as soon as they were invented, planes were drafted for military service.\n\n\"See also the following articles:\"\n\nSome historians consider these conflicts to be part of the First World War, having started either during or just after the war. \n\nIn some cases, these conflicts were not directly caused by the war yet were exacerbated by them. For example, the 1916 Easter Rising was caused by factors generally unrelated to the war in Europe, yet took place at the time it did due to the British Army being thinly stretched in 1916, as well as the promise of German support in fighting the British, among many other factors.\n\nOthers, such as the Mexican Revolution, began before but influenced the war in terms of materiel or as factors taken into consideration by the belligerents. In the cause of the Ottoman Wars, these motivated the Young Turks to move towards war against the Allied Powers.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2278242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278242", "title": "Missouri Tigers", "text": "Missouri Tigers\n\nThe Missouri Tigers intercollegiate athletics programs that represent the University of Missouri, located in Columbia. The name comes from a band of armed guards called the Fighting Tigers of Columbia who, in 1864, protected Columbia from guerrillas during the Civil War.\nThe University of Missouri (often referred to as Mizzou or MU) is the flagship institution of the University of Missouri System. Mizzou is a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and is the only NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision program in Missouri. Its wrestling program, the only one sponsored by an SEC member school, competes in the Mid-American Conference.\n\nPrior to joining the SEC in 2012, Missouri was a charter member of the Big 12 Conference, which was created with the merger of the former Big Eight Conference and four schools from the former Southwest Conference (one of these schools, Texas A&M, joined the SEC with Missouri in 2012), and which began athletic competition in the 1996–97 academic year. Missouri competed in the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association starting in 1907, which officially changed its name to the Big Eight Conference in 1964.\n\nThe first Missouri Tigers baseball team was in 1868. The first recorded season was in 1891, when the Tigers went 2–2. The Tigers won the National Championship in 1954. The presence of former Missouri Tiger baseball players in professional baseball continues to grow each year.\n\nFormer MU head coach Tim Jamieson has seen 40 players in his 13-year tenure sign pro contracts. Notable Tiger baseball alumni include Tim Laudner, who played for the 1987 World Champion Minnesota Twins, and Phil Bradley, who played for several teams in 1980s and early 1990s, and current Major Leaguer Ian Kinsler. In 2006, pitcher Max Scherzer was selected in the first round with the 11th overall pick by the Arizona Diamondbacks. Scherzer went on to win the Al Cy Young Award with the Detroit Tigers in 2013. In 2008, pitcher Aaron Crow was picked 9th overall by the Washington Nationals.\n\nThe men's basketball program has produced several NBA players, including Anthony Peeler, Doug Smith, Jon Sundvold, Steve Stipanovich, Kareem Rush, Keyon Dooling, Linas Kleiza, Thomas Gardner, Jordan Clarkson and DeMarre Carroll. The Tigers were regularly a national power under Norm Stewart, whose tenure spanned four decades but which failed to include a Final Four appearance despite numerous conference championships. The team advanced to the Elite Eight under Quin Snyder in 2002, but inconsistent performance and various improprieties in his leadership of the program caused him to be fired in the midst of an abysmal 2006 season. He was replaced with then-UAB head coach Mike Anderson. In 2009 the team lost in the Elite Eight to the Connecticut Huskies. Then, after a first-round exit from the NCAA tournament in 2011, Anderson took the head coaching position with the University of Arkansas. The head coaching vacancy was filled in early April 2011 with Frank Haith, the former Miami (Florida) head coach who left after the 2013 season to go Tulsa. In 2014, Kim Anderson became the new head basketball coach. The program is now led by Cuonzo Martin.\n\nThe 1920–21 and 1921–22 teams were retroactively named national champions by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.\n\nThe current head coach of the women's basketball program is Robin Pingeton, formerly of Illinois State. She was hired in April 2010 to replace Cindy Stein, who resigned under pressure from boosters and media after the 2009–10 season.\n\nThe university's first football team was formed in 1890 by the sophomore class of the \"Academic School\" (now the College of Arts and Science). They challenged a team of Engineering students in April of that year upon encouragement of Dr. A. L. McRea, a university professor. Interest in the sport quickly grew among the students, professors, and administrators, and a Foot Ball Association was formed at a meeting on October 10, 1890. The first intercollegiate game for the university took place on Thanksgiving Day, 1890, when Missouri played Washington University before a crowd of 3,000 in St. Louis, Missouri. The Washington University team, which had already been playing for several years, easily defeated the University of Missouri team by a score of 28–0. Missouri has compiled a 15–16 record in bowl games, including a 41-31 victory over Oklahoma State in the 2014 Cotton Bowl and a 33-17 win over Minnesota in the 2015 Citrus Bowl. It has finished in the final Associated Press poll Top Ten eight times since the poll began in 1936, and has had two top-five finishes since 2007.\n\nMissouri softball began play in 1975. Missouri has appeared in seven Women's College World Series, in 1981, 1983, 1991, 1994, 2009, 2010 and 2011.\n\nHearnes Center is home to the Missouri Tigers' nationally ranked wrestling program. For 16 years Brian Smith has been the university's head wrestling coach. Since 1998, Smith has received honors for his coaching accomplishments at the University of Missouri: Dan Gable Coach of the Year (2007), NWCA President (2010-12), Big 12 Coach of the Year (2012).\n\nBen Askren and J'den Cox have gone on to compete for the United States in Olympic Games: 2008 and 2016. Cox earned the bronze medal at 86 kg.\n\nBen Askren, Tyron Woodley, and Michael Chandler are among the few from the university's wrestling program to make the transition to Mixed Martial Arts. Askren is a 4-time All-American wrestler (2004-2007), 2-time NCAA Division I Collegiate National Runner-up (2004, 2005), 2-time NCAA Division I Collegiate National Champion (2006, 2007),2-time Dan Hodge Trophy Collegiate Wrestler of the Year (2006, 2007), and competed in the 2008 Olympics. He has been inducted into the University of Missouri Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame (2012). Askren is the former Bellator Welterweight Champion, former One Welterweight Champion, and former UFC Welterweight contender, having retired from MMA after his loss to Scott Collie (Dundee All Scottish D1 champion - joking, it was actually Damian Mia). Chandler is a former Tiger wrestler earning All-American honors in 2009 (5th place 157 lbs.) who is the current (and 3 time) Bellator Lightweight Champion. Woodley is a former UFC Welterweight champion and former Strikeforce Welterweight title challenger\n\nThe University of Missouri Men's Rugby Club plays Division 1-AA college rugby in the Heart of America conference against traditional rivals such as Kansas and Kansas State. Mizzou has been led since 2010 by head coach J.P. Victor.\nMissouri rugby finished the 2011–2012 season ranked 17th. As the winner of the Heart of America conference, Missouri qualified for the playoffs of the 2012 men's collegiate DI-AA championships, reaching the round of 16 before losing to Wisconsin. Mizzou defeated Kansas 24–7 to finish third at the 2012 Heart of America 7s tournament. Mizzou was again successful during the 2013–2014 season, reaching the D1-AA national playoffs, where they defeated Middle Tennessee 46–10 in the round of 16 before losing in the quarterfinals to Bowling Green.\n\nThe University of Missouri Club Racquetball team has had success recently. The women's team won back-to-back Division 1 titles in 2015 and 2016 at the USA Racquetball Intercollegiate Championships. The overall team placed 2nd and 3rd respectively in those years. The team's president is Dan Witt.\n\nMissouri's newest rivalry after joining the SEC is with the Arkansas Razorbacks, known as the Battle Line Rivalry. Both the Razorbacks and Tigers have played five times before playing annually in the same conference which started in 2014. Arkansas was one of the founding members of the Southwest Conference along with the Texas Longhorns. The Razorbacks left the Southwest Conference to join the SEC, which triggered the Southwest and the Big Eight Conferences to merged to form the Big 12 in 1996. Arkansas is placed in the West Division of the SEC while Missouri is placed in the East and with the SEC current football scheduling format a team from the West and the East divisions must play annually. To keep traditional rivalries ongoing in the SEC, the conference dropped Arkansas's cross-division annual match up with South Carolina to replace the Gamecocks with the Tigers due to the proximity of the two universities. Missouri currently leads the football series 5–3. Arkansas fans do not consider this a rivalry game as historically the end of year game was against LSU. \n\nAlso known as Battle for Columbia due to the two universities in the city of Columbia in their respective states. Both the Tigers and the Gamecocks play for Missouri's newest Trophy game, the Mayors' Cup. The trophy was created in 2012 when Missouri joined the conference. Both teams are in the East division of the SEC and will play annually along with the other five members of the division. The series is currently tied at 4–4, while the trophy series South Carolina leads 4-2.\n\nHistorically, the Tigers' biggest rival was the Kansas Jayhawks, with whom they competed in the annual Border War. This was one of the most intense rivalries in college sports, going back to a time of actual armed conflict between pro-slavery residents from Missouri and anti-slavery residents of the Kansas Territory, known as Bleeding Kansas. The series ended for the foreseeable future once Mizzou moved to the SEC.\n\nThe Kansas–Missouri football series is the second-oldest and second-most-played rivalry in college football history. (See: The Rivalry (Lehigh–Lafayette)) The teams first matched up in football on October 31, 1891. Missouri claims to lead the all-time series, 57–54–9, since it counts the forfeit of Kansas' 1960 victory as a win. Missouri claims the 1911 football game in Columbia, Missouri as the world's first Homecoming. An important meeting between the Tigers and Jayhawks occurred on November 24, 2007 when the two teams played for the Big 12 North Championship and a shot at playing for the Big 12 Championship and a possible National Championship. The Tigers defeated the Jayhawks 36–28. The Tigers season later resulted in a trip to the Cotton Bowl Classic, where they defeated Arkansas 38–7.\n\nThe Missouri-Nebraska football series was another historic rivalry alongside the MU–KU series, although it ended with Nebraska's departure for the Big Ten Conference. The Missouri–Nebraska series was the second oldest rivalry in the Big 12, dating back to 1892. The two teams met 104 times, with Nebraska leading the series 65–36–3. The large lead was the result of a 24-year Nebraska winning streak from 1979 to 2002. The teams split the eight games played from 2003 to 2010. The rivalry saw renewed interest following the Flea Kicker. The two teams played for the Victory Bell trophy, which was first awarded in 1927.\n\nThere is also a relatively new basketball rivalry with the Illinois Fighting Illini of the Big Ten Conference referred to as Braggin' Rights. The Braggin' Rights game debuted in 1980 and has been played every year since 1983. Missouri trails the series 20–11. The start of football season also often matches the two schools in the \"Arch Rivalry\" game, most recently played at the Edward Jones Dome. Mizzou leads the football series with an all-time record of 14–7 since 1896. In addition, the Missouri and Illinois baseball teams have recently begun a baseball rivalry, meeting at Busch Stadium since 2005 (though the schools did not meet in 2009 or 2011). Missouri leads the series 5-1 since 2005.\n\nThe Tiger–Sooner Peace Pipe is a rivalry trophy presented to the winner of the Missouri vs. Oklahoma game.\n\nThe trophy is a ceremony of smoking the old pipe. The trophy was inaugurated in 1929 by Chester M. Brewer, Mizzou's director of athletics, and by members of Mystical Seven, a University of Missouri honorary group. The peace pipe was donated by a Mr. R. L. Hill, an \"M\" man and former president of the Missouri student body. Ceremony takes place during halves, with Mystical Seven representing Missouri, and a similar organization representing Oklahoma. Missouri won the first game, 13–0.\n\nDuring Mizzou's tenure in the Big 12, the conference's divisional play structure meant that the Tigers and the Sooners only faced off two out every four years. Therefore, only scheduled games between the two teams count for the exchange of the Peace Pipe. The most recent Big 12 Championship games featuring Mizzou and Oklahoma would not have triggered a transfer of the Peace Pipe (if Missouri had won on either occasion.)\n\nOklahoma leads the all-time series with a record of 65–23–5.\n\nIn 2010, Mizzou, ranked no. 11 in the BCS standings, defeated no. 1 ranked Oklahoma, 36–27.\n\nOklahoma leads the series since the trophy tradition started with a record of 56–14–4.\n\nThe Telephone Trophy started during a 1959 Game featuring Iowa State and Missouri when the field phones were tested prior to the game, it was found that both teams could hear each other. The problem was solved by game time, but not without considerable worry on the part of the coaches. The Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. of Ames had a trophy made and presented it to Iowa State to be awarded each year to the team winning the game. An odd sidelight to the whole affair was that the same thing happened to Missouri later in the year in a game played at Columbia. Missouri won the first game, 14–0.\n\nThe series is 58–34–9 in favor of Missouri.\n\nMissouri leads the series since the trophy tradition started with a record of 30–18–3.\n\nThe University of Missouri claims to be the originator of the tradition of homecoming. Before, games against the University of Kansas were played in Kansas City. However, a change in conference regulations required intercollegiate football games to be played on campus starting in 1911. Fearing that game attendance would be low, the new Missouri coach, C. L. Brewer, appealed with great success for the \"Old Grads\" to \"Come Back Home\" to boost attendance and help dedicate MU's new football field. The fans responded, swelling the crowd at Rollins Field in Columbia to more than ten thousand. MU, \"Trivial Pursuit\", and \"Jeopardy!\" all verify that this game in 1911 was one of the first homecoming games.\n\nThe 2010 edition of the University of Missouri Homecoming also included the first ever visit by ESPN College GameDay. 18,000 fans attended College GameDay at the Francis Quadrangle on Saturday, October 23, 2010. The turnout broke the previous record of 15,800 fans set at the University of Nebraska in 2001.\n\nBig MO is a 6-foot, 150-pound bass drum featured at Mizzou football games. Big MO's handlers are actually University of Missouri alumni rather than student members of Marching Mizzou. Big MO is used to lead fans in the traditional MIZ-ZOU cheer. The drum has been a Mizzou football tradition since 1981, when it was acquired by a Mizzou athletic booster club known as the St. Louis Quarterback Club. The club donated $5,000 to purchase the drum, which was built by Ludwig Drums in Chicago. The drum, originally painted red with gold flakes, was brought back from Chicago strapped in the back of a pickup truck. When it arrived in Columbia, the drum was repainted black and presented to the university a week before the first 1981 football game at an event known as the Tiger Fall Rally. Responsibility for Big MO was transferred to the Mizzou chapters of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma in 1993. Only student and alumni members of the two organizations are eligible to be on the Big MO crew. Big MO is the third largest bass drum in the United States, behind Big Bertha at the University of Texas and the Purdue Big Bass Drum.\n\nIn April 2011, the Mizzou chapters of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma kicked off a fundraising campaign to replace Big MO, which deteriorated over several decades of use. The current Big MO weighs 800-plus-pounds and has a 9-foot diameter and a 54-inch width, making it the largest collegiate bass drum as well as largest bass drum in the United States. The new drum was built by Neil Boumpani of Boumpani Music Company, a custom drum maker in Barnesville, Georgia. The new record-setting Big MO debuted when Mizzou entered play in the Southeastern Conference in 2012.\n\nSince 1971, there has been no doubt about the destination of the goal posts any time they have been torn down following a home football game. 1971 marked the first year in which the goal posts ended up at Harpo's Bar and Grill at 29 S. Tenth Street in Columbia. Although no concrete reasoning is known behind the tradition, it is suggested that Harpo's became the destination because of its popularity among alumni returning to Columbia on game days and because the restaurant is one of the few places that had remained under consistent ownership without any name changes, so alumni and students all easily identify with the establishment. Following the 2005 season, removable goal posts were installed, which are lowered at the close of each home game.\n\nIn 2010 the goal post tradition was revived following the victory against BCS #1 ranked Oklahoma. Thousands of fans began to swarm the field before the final play had even ended. Although there were event staff and highway patrol encircling the field, security was unable to prevent fans from storming the field and removing the north end zone goal post from the stadium.\n\nThe \"Alma Mater\" for the University of Missouri is \"Old Missouri\". It was written in 1895 and is sung to the tune of Annie Lisle and has two verses. Before and after athletic events, sometimes only the first verse is used. The first and second verses are more commonly sung at student orientation and at commencement/graduation ceremonies. Both verses are followed by the chorus.\n\nMissouri has won 2 NCAA team national championships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tiger Radio Network is anchored by KMBZ in Kansas City, KTGR AM/KCMQ FM in Columbia and Jefferson City, and KTRS in St Louis. Mike Kelly is the commentator for both sports, with Howard Richards and Chris Gervino serving as analysts for football and Gary Link filling in for basketball. In addition, the school owns and operates its own NBC affiliate, KOMU-TV, in Columbia. The station is run by MU faculty members and is staffed by professionals and students. It's the only college-owned and operated network affiliate in the country.\n\nFor indoor sports, Mizzou operates the Missouri Sports Network, a syndication package that airs on FSN Midwest and/or Metro Sports. It mainly broadcasts volleyball and basketball. Dan McLaughlin handles play-by-play for all sports, and is joined by a rotating group of color commentators, most notably Tigers coaching legend Norm Stewart for men's basketball games.\n\n"}

Part of the Houston Independent School District, Scarborough serves grades nine through twelve and has Houston ISD's Futures Academy.\n\nThe school was named after school board member George Cameron Scarborough.

Released in 1985, it spawned the hit singles \"The Old Man Down the Road\", \"Rock and Roll Girls\" and the title track \"Centerfield\". This was Fogerty's first album in nine years; After Asylum Records rejected his \"Hoodoo\" album, he decided to take a long break from the music business because of legal battles with his record company. In the meantime, Fogerty's recording contract with Asylum Records was reassigned to co-owned Warner Bros. Records so this album was the first released on the Warner Bros. label.\n\nFogerty played all the instruments on this album himself, thanks to overdubbing. The image on the cover shows an old-fashioned, \"beat-up glove\", as referenced in the title song, and text similar to a logo of a baseball team, setting the mood for the track. The RIAA has certified the album double-platinum (2 million album sales). A 25th Anniversary Edition was released on June 29, 2010 and features the original album, digitally remastered, and adds a pair of rare bonus tracks, both of which released as B-sides to 45s released in 1986; A cover of Rockin' Sidney Simien's Zydeco hit \"My Toot Toot\" (taken from Fogerty's \"Change in the Weather\" single, featuring Sidney himself on accordion) and 1950s R&B/doo wop gem \"I Confess\" by Teddy Vann and Nathaniel Nathan (from Fogerty's \"Eye of the Zombie\" single). The review at Blogcritics incorrectly credits \"I Confess\" to Bay Area gospel group The Four Rivers.\n\nAll songs written by John Fogerty.\n\n\"My Toot Toot\" \n\n\"I Confess\" \n\nThe song \"Zanz Kant Danz\" was altered and re-titled \"Vanz Kant Danz\" a few months after the release of the album in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid a defamation lawsuit from Saul Zaentz, owner of Fantasy Records. The altered \"Vanz Kant Danz\" version of this song appears on all post-1985 pressings of the album.\n\nA Zaentz lawsuit (\"Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty\") claimed that \"The Old Man Down the Road\" shared the same chorus as \"Run Through the Jungle\" (a song from Fogerty's days with Creedence Clearwater Revival: years before, Fogerty had relinquished copy and publishing rights of his Creedence songs to Zaentz and Fantasy, in exchange for release from his contractual obligations to same). The defendant Fogerty ultimately prevailed, when he showed that the two songs were whole, separate and distinct compositions. Bringing his guitar to the witness stand, he played excerpts from both songs, demonstrating that many songwriters (himself included) have distinctive styles that can make different compositions sound similar to less discerning ears.\n\nAfter prevailing as defendant, Fogerty sued Zaentz for the cost of defending himself against the copyright infringement. In such (copyright) cases, prevailing defendants seeking recompense were bound to show that the original suit was frivolous or made in bad faith. This case, \"Fogerty v. Fantasy\", became precedent when the Supreme Court (1993) overturned lower court rulings and awarded attorneys' fees to Fogerty, without Fogerty having to show that Zaentz's original suit was frivolous.\n\nThe album is dedicated to \"Gossamer Wump\". Fogerty said in an interview, \"When I was a young kid, my brothers had a record called 'The Adventures of Gossamer Wump.' Gossamer Wump is a little kid who saw a big parade comin' down the road and thinks 'Hey, this is what I want, I want to be a musician.'\n\n\"Gossamer goes through all the instruments comin' by and does not know how to decide what instrument he wants to play. Then, at the end of the parade he sees the triangle and thinks, 'Yes, that's what I want to play.' Determined to learn how to play the triangle, Gossamer takes his belongings and 26 peanut butter sandwiches and leaves for the big city. On his way he sings 'jingle, jongle, jangle, ah'm goin' to the big city to learn to play the triangle.'\n\n\"In the city, Gossamer starts taking lessons and very soon he plays 'tingle.' After ten years of courage, determination, and hard work Gossamer plays 'tingle.' No difference? At first sight, no, but Gossamer, he can hear the difference. This is what I like about this story. After ten years in my garage, I played alone. They maybe don't hear the difference, but I do. Gossamer stuck to his dream, and that's why I dedicated this album to Gossamer Wump.\"\n"}

In April 1979, Simpson left the group to perform in a musical and was replaced by Ralph Cole (bass). All of the original members were gay men, although later lineups included both gay and heterosexual singers. Cole left the band in late 1981 and was replaced by Arnold Robinson (bass).\n\nIn 1986, the group appeared on the critically acclaimed children's television show \"Sharon, Lois & Bram's Elephant Show\", featuring children's entertainers Sharon, Lois & Bram. The Nylons appeared in Season 3 of the show on the \"Treasure Island\" episode, singing \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\". These songs appeared on the band's albums \"Seamless\" (1984) and \"Rockapella\" (1989). During this era, the band also gained exposure from the mid-1980s syndicated sitcom \"Throb\" by singing (with the show's lead actress Diana Canova) the theme to the show. \n\nIn October 24, 1992, The Nylons sang \"O Canada\" at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, preceding Game 6 of the 1992 World Series, in which their hometown team, the Toronto Blue Jays, won their first championship. \n\nCooper retired from the band in 1990 and was replaced by Micah Barnes (baritone). Connors died in 1991 from AIDS related complications, and was replaced by Billy Newton-Davis (tenor). In 1994 both Newton-Davis and Barnes left the group to pursue their solo careers, and were replaced by Garth Mosbaugh (tenor) and Gavin Hope (baritone) respectively. In 1997 Hope left the group to pursue a solo career and was replaced by Mark Cassius (baritone). In 2005, Cassius left the group; Tyrone Gabriel replaced him. After Robinson's retirement in early 2006, Gavin Hope returned as baritone; Tyrone Gabriel moved to the bass position to replace Robinson.\n\nPaul Cooper died in 2013 of cardiac arrest, at the age of 63.\n\nOn May 30, 2014, the Nylons performed a show in Toronto which included the participation of every living past or present member of the band.\n\nIn fall and winter 2016, The Nylons toured and performed their farewell show throughout Canada.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Denotes the four founding members.\n\nAlbums from 1982-1989 were released on Attic Records in Canada and Windham Hill in the United States, albums from 1989-1996 were released on BMG's Scotti Brothers imprint, and albums after 1997 were released on Shoreline Records.\n"}

It is the group's third studio release, and their first since their debut album without Neil Young. It peaked at #2 on the \"Billboard\" Top Pop Albums chart; two singles taken from the album, Nash's \"Just a Song Before I Go\" and Stills' \"Fair Game\" peaked at #7 and #43 respectively on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It is currently the trio configuration's best selling record, outselling 1969's \"Crosby, Stills & Nash\" by 200,000 copies. It has been certified quadruple platinum by RIAA.\n\nIn the interregnum that followed their tour in the spring and summer of 1970 to support \"Déjà Vu\", Crosby, Stills and Nash had only completed one project together, a 1974 reunion tour of CSNY. David Crosby and Graham Nash had recorded three albums as a duo, with Crosby releasing a single solo album (in addition to a Byrds reunion album) and Nash a pair. Stephen Stills pursued other projects including the release of four solo albums, a short career with Manassas that yielded two albums, as well as a tour and an album with Neil Young, which itself nearly became a CSNY project.\n\n\"CSN\" featured strong writing from all three members, the last time for seventeen years that the band would compose songs and handle vocals without major assistance from outside sources. The production of the album fits in well with the ruling aesthetic of the time as featured in other blockbusters such as the Eagles' \"Hotel California\" and Fleetwood Mac's \"Rumours\": well-crafted, melodic songs played with precision and balance, chronicling the personal travails of the authors.\n\nMany of Stills' songs on the album echo his marital problems , with \"Dark Star\" returning to the Latin rhythms he had favored all the way back to his Buffalo Springfield days. Crosby continued the existential probings consistent with much of his past work, and Nash offered both a radio-ready acoustic ballad with \"Just a Song Before I Go\", and an elaborate set piece re-creating a vision of an LSD experience that he had in Winchester Cathedral with \"Cathedral\". Many tracks included a string section, a first on a CSNY project.\n\nThe album was released for compact disc an initial time in the 1980s, then again at Ocean View Digital from the original tapes and reissued on September 20, 1994. It was remastered once more by Steve Hoffman in April 2013, for an Audio Fidelity 24kt gold disk release in the summer of 2013.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2278289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278289", "title": "Universalist Church of West Hartford", "text": "Universalist Church of West Hartford\n\nThe Universalist Church of West Hartford is a Unitarian Universalist congregation in West Hartford, Connecticut. \n\nThe church organized in 1821, but it had its origins in Hartford in the late 18th century, during the period when the Congregational church was dominant in the area. At that time, a sizable group of people, influenced by Elhanan Winchester, began to reject Calvinist doctrine and espouse a belief in the universal goodness of God. In 1821, after a visit to Hartford by Hosea Ballou of Boston, the \"First Independent Universalist Society of the City of Hartford\" was formed and called its first minister. The name was changed in 1870 to \"Church of the Redeemer\" -- to give the church \"a specific title or name\", and in the early 1960s was changed to \"The Universalist Church of West Hartford\".\n\nThe first meetinghouse, located in downtown Hartford across the street from the Old State House, was completed and dedicated in 1824. It was used until 1860. In 1860 the church moved to a larger building on Main Street at the site where the Travelers Tower now stands. In 1906, the church moved out of downtown, to a building on Asylum Hill. Each of the first three churches was located on prime real estate in the city of Hartford, so the sale of the property each time largely financed the building of the next church. The present building was dedicated in 1931, and a sizable addition completed in 1962. It is in a strictly residential neighborhood in West Hartford, but serves a much larger community, both urban and suburban. The present building in West Hartford dates from 1931, with the addition of Fiske Hall, some church school rooms and a new sanctuary organ in 1962. The church maintains membership in the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA), organized in 1961 by the merger of the American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America.\n\nIn the early years of the church, ministers’ tenures in general were only a few years. However, since the 1860s there have been long series of ministries, averaging fifteen years. Most notable is the 25-year ministry of former Minister Emeritus, The Reverend Wallace Grant Fiske, followed by fifteen years with The Reverend Frederick Lipp and twelve years with The Reverend Stephen Kendrick. In 2001, The Reverend Dr. Judith Walker-Riggs joined the church as Interim Minister. On November 17, 2002, Jan Katrina Nielsen was installed as the 22nd Senior Minister in the history of this church.\n\nThe present church building edifice is a colonial-style, tall-steepled building, erected in 1931 and designed by Walter Crabtree. A large addition was constructed in 1962 includes additional church school rooms, music room, Fiske Hall, a large multi-purpose parish hall with a stage and main kitchen. Between the sanctuary and the addition is the most-used areas, containing newly expanded office space, conference room, library, program center with kitchen and a formal parlor. The church is one of the many in West Hartford to have a youth group, a place for teens to meet and reflect on the spirituality together. The sanctuary seats up to 350 in double rows of pews flanking a center aisle. The memorial stained glass windows which grace the chancel area were designed originally for the former church building. These and other memorial windows were saved and incorporated into this building. An Austin pipe organ was installed in 1963. On the west side of the building is a memorial garden dedicated in 1985. A large parking lot, which is leased from the Town of West Hartford, borders the south side of the property. The church also has a ten-room brick colonial parsonage on Middlefield Drive which it acquired in 1942. On December 5, 1999, the entire church was renovated with a total expenditure of $1.5 million. The extensive renovations touched nearly every inch of the building, including the refurbishing of the sanctuary and addition of a three-floor two-door elevator.\n\n\n"}

The Chinese crocodile lizard spends much of its time in shallow water or in overhanging branches and vegetation, where it hunts its prey of insects, snails, tadpoles, and worms. Individuals in captivity may be fed baby mice. A rare and little-studied lizard, it is listed in CITES Appendix II, which regulates international trade of specimens. This is the only species in the monotypic genus Shinisaurus.\n\n\"Shinisaurus\" (literally \"Shin's lizard\") honours the biologist (), a member of a joint Chinese-German expedition that discovered this species (as well as the frog \"Quasipaa shini\").\nIts specific name – like the separate genus \"Crocodilurus\" – means \"crocodile-tail\".\n\n\"Shinisaurus\" was once also regarded as a member of Xenosauridae, but most recent studies of the evolutionary relationships of anguimorphs consider \"Shinisaurus\" to be more closely related to monitor lizards and helodermatids than to \"Xenosaurus\". It is now placed in its own family: Shinisauridae.\n\nTwo subspecies are recognized:\n\n\nThe Chinese crocodile lizard is green, colored with reddish neck markings and alternating bands of light and dark marks. Males are more colorful than females, especially during the breeding season. They are 40–46 cm (16–18 in) long. Perhaps its most distinctive features are the rows of enlarged, bony scales down its back and muscular tail that resemble those of a crocodile.\n\nA 2008 study estimated 950 crocodile lizards left in China. The same year it was estimated that fewer than 150 adults were left in Vietnam. Habitat loss is a major threat to the species. It has been listed on CITES Appendix II since 1990; there are low levels of legal exports for the pet trade with CITES permits, but it is believed that illegal collection occurs at a higher level. In 2014, it was listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List based on severe population declines and ongoing threats.\n"}

It was released on 15 November 1970 by Warner Bros. Records. Originally titled \"Virgo's Fool\", \"Street Choir\" was renamed by Warner Bros. without Morrison's consent. Recording began in early 1970 with a demo session in a small church in Woodstock, New York. Morrison booked the A&R Studios on 46th Street in New York City in the second quarter of 1970 to produce two sessions of songs that were released on \"His Band and the Street Choir\".\n\nReviewers praised the music of both sessions for its free, relaxed sound, but the lyrics were considered to be simple compared with those of his previous work. Morrison had intended to record the album \"a cappella\" with only vocal backing by a vocal group he called the Street Choir, but the songs released on the album that included the choir also featured a backing band. Morrison was dissatisfied with additional vocalists to the original quintet that made up the choir, and these changes and others have led him to regard \"Street Choir\" poorly in later years.\n\n\"His Band and the Street Choir\" was as well received as Morrison's previous album, \"Moondance\", peaking at number 32 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number 18 on the UK Album Chart. It owes its success mainly to the US Top Ten single \"Domino\", which was released before the album and surpassed Morrison's 1967 hit, \"Brown Eyed Girl\". As of 2019, \"Domino\" remains the most successful single of Morrison's solo career. Two other singles were released from the album, \"Blue Money\" and \"Call Me Up in Dreamland\"; although less successful, they still managed to reach the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nRecording began with a demo session at a small church in Woodstock, which was not intended to produce any official releases. During its course Morrison worked on leftover material from his previous two albums (\"Astral Weeks\" and \"Moondance\"), recorded songs that he had not performed in the studio before (\"Crazy Face\" and \"Give Me a Kiss\"), as well as two instrumentals. Limited recording equipment was used, operated by drummer Dahaud Shaar, who was intending to open a recording studio in Woodstock at the time. Shaar remembered: \"I found an old church and we would just load in. I'd set up a pair of mikes and we would just run down some tracks with the tapes running. They became like a working thing for the album.\"\nFor his new band Morrison brought back three musicians from the \"Moondance\" sessions: saxophonist Jack Schroer; guitarist John Platania and bassist John Klingberg. The backing vocal trio of Emily Houston, Judy Clay and Jackie Verdell also returned to sing on \"If I Ever Needed Someone\". Multi-instrumentalist Dahaud Shaar joined for \"His Band and the Street Choir\"; he was a veteran of the \"Moondance\" tour, though he had not played on the album. Keyboardist Alan Hand joined Morrison's band in late April 1970, replacing Jef Labes, who had left the band and moved to Israel before the end of the year. Keith Johnson completed the line-up on trumpet and Hammond organ.\n\nBetween March and May 1970 Morrison began work on the album at the A&R recording studios in New York City. He intended to create a full \"a capella\" record, and with this in mind assembled a vocal group he called the Street Choir, consisting of his friends Dahaud Shaar, Larry Goldsmith, Andrew Robinson and then wife, Janet \"Planet\" Rigsbee, who all lived near Woodstock. He had wanted the choir to feature only four vocalists, but was persuaded to allow two additional members to join: the wives of Keith Johnson and Jack Schroer (Martha Velez and Ellen Schroer). However, Morrison was later persuaded to abandon the use of \"a cappella\": \"I had a group of people in mind for the Street Choir ... I asked them if they wanted to sing ... then the old ladies got involved and it ruined the whole thing.\" He was unhappy with the tracks recorded with the choir, as he wanted to use the group for a different effect: \"I wanted these certain guys to form an \"a cappella\" group so that I could cut a lot of songs with just maybe one guitar. But it didn't turn out.\" During this session Morrison recorded the same tracks used for the demo session in Woodstock, as well as \"Gypsy Queen\" and an additional instrumental, six of which were used on \"Street Choir\". Elliot Scheiner was used as the engineer for this session, after he helped to produce \"Moondance\". However, according to biographer Clinton Heylin, Scheiner and Morrison had a disagreement, so he was not used for the rest of the album.\n\nMorrison returned to the A&R studios between June and August to record the remaining six tracks that featured on the album. For this second session Dahaud Shaar filled the role of engineer, though Shaar did not remember Morrison giving the job to him: \"Elliot thought he was going to be the co-producer, but then again I never saw him calling takes or asking people to change parts ... I didn't consider myself co-producer. Van would ask me questions and I would give him answers, but it was never a defined role.\" Morrison felt dissatisfied with some of the final recordings, and notably reworked the song \"Street Choir\" shortly before studio work concluded.\n\nSome songs featured on \"His Band and the Street Choir\" were first recorded for the albums \"Astral Weeks\" and \"Moondance\". Morrison rewrote and rearranged them for release on \"Street Choir\" because the recordings for his new album featured different personnel and instrumentation. The songs on the album, which \"Rolling Stone\" reviewer Jon Landau believes have a free, relaxed sound to them, borrow from various music genres; the simple lyrics lack the complexity popularly expected from Morrison's work. According to \"Pitchfork\" journalist Stephen Thomas Erlewine, \"Street Choir\" eschewed \"Moondance\"s jazz influences in favor of \"soul and gospel, using folk almost as an accent\", all the while possessing a \"heavy R&B kick\". AllMusic contributor Jason Ankeny believed that, without the \"overt mysticism\" of the singer's previous two records, it was \"simply Morrison's valentine to the rhythm and blues that inspired him\".\n\nThe first recording that would feature on \"His Band and the Street Choir\" was \"I've Been Working\", an out-take from the \"Astral Weeks\" sessions in 1968 and the \"Moondance\" sessions in 1969. The final version produced on \"His Band and the Street Choir\" is upbeat and shows the influence of James Brown. Morrison notably sings the line \"Woman, woman, woman, you make me feel alright\" in unison with the horn section, which Jon Landau describes as \"breathtaking\".\n\n\"Domino\" had been recorded many times before its release. The first was in sessions from September to November 1968, just after \"Astral Weeks\" was recorded. Morrison rearranged \"Domino\" frequently from 1968 to 1970, notably recording rap and harmony versions. For its release it was arranged in a moderate 4/4 tempo and features rhythm guitar. Horn overdubs were later added to the recording. Morrison ad libs between the end of the chorus and the start of the verses, when he shouts the words \"Dig it!\", as well as near the end with \"And the band ... one more time!\", which, according to biographer Peter Mills, helps bring out the theme of \"liveliness\" in both the song and the album as a whole. The song was considered by musicologist Brian Hinton as a tribute to pianist and singer-songwriter, Fats Domino. As with \"Domino\", Morrison first recorded \"If I Ever Needed Someone\" in late 1968; it is one of many blues-influenced tracks on the album.\n\n\"Virgo Clowns\" was first recorded at the start of 1969 as \"(Sit Down) Funny Face\". Morrison next recorded it during the first \"Street Choir\" session, renaming it simply \"Funny Face\". It was re-recorded during the second session under the completely different title of \"Virgo Clowns\". In its final form, Morrison and John Platania duet on acoustic guitars. As the song fades out laughter is heard performed by Dahaud Shaar and Larry Goldsmith .\n\n\"Crazy Face\" evolved from \"Going Around with Jesse James\", a song Morrison first recorded for \"Astral Weeks\" on 15 October 1968. Both songs contain references to American outlaw Jesse James. Morrison arranged \"Crazy Face\" in the irregular time signature 8/4; the first, third and seventh beats of the bar are emphasised. It begins with a gentle piano introduction, and ends abruptly, which, in Peter Mills' view, represents a shot from a gun, consistent with the American outlaw theme.\n\n\"Give Me a Kiss\" and \"Gypsy Queen\" are the final songs recorded during the first recording session. Morrison wrote \"Give me a Kiss\" about either Planet or his newly born baby girl Shana. It is a twelve bar blues in the style of boogie rock, a music genre prominent in the 1960s, leading reviewers to compare the song to the work of The Beatles and Elvis Presley. Reviewers believed the song \"Gypsy Queen\" was inspired by \"Gypsy Woman\", first recorded by Curtis Mayfield and The Impressions. Johnny Rogan feels the song is \"a failed attempt to recapture the spirit of 'Caravan'\", another Morrison composition inspired by \"Gypsy Woman\", released on the album \"Moondance\". Morrison sings the song in falsetto, while keyboardist Alan Hand plays celeste, imitating a music box at both the beginning and end.\n\nThe second recording session yielded the remaining material. \"Call Me Up in Dreamland\" is a gospel-style composition. The lyrics refer to life on the road, as Morrison was touring when he recorded the album. They also refer to Morrison and Janet Planet's life at the time: \"We were finally, really living in a dreamland—believe it or not—it was a magical time\", Planet recalled.\n\n\"I'll Be Your Lover, Too\" was inspired by Morrison and Planet's marriage. This acoustic ballad has a moderate 4/4 tempo, with one 5/8 bar before the vocal comes in. \"Blue Money\", a pun-filled reference to Morrison's financial situation, is about a model, perhaps his wife. (Planet worked in the industry before meeting Morrison.) \"Sweet Jannie\" is the second twelve-bar blues on the album; written about young love, the song is another that reviewers speculated was about Planet. The lyrics, \"I've been in love with you baby / Ever since you were in Sunday school\" lead Clinton Heylin to believe it was written about memories from Morrison's childhood when he attended Sunday school in Belfast; Planet is a California-raised Texan.\n\nIn the album closer, \"Street Choir\", Morrison repeats the questions, \"Why did you let me down / And now that things are better off / Why do you come around\". Because of these lyrics Heylin wrote that \"such songs [as \"Street Choir\"] were spawned by an increasing awareness of just how badly ripped off he had been\". Ken Brooks has said that the lyric \"Move On Up\" is another reference on the album to a Curtis Mayfield song. The track prominently features Keith Johnson's trumpet and Morrison's harmonica. Writer Brian Hinton described the lyrics as perversely bitter, while Jon Landau wrote that \"Street Choir\" was one of the \"two or three finest songs\" of Morrison's career because of its \"musical and poetic energy\".\n\nWarner Bros. Records scheduled \"His Band and the Street Choir\" for rush-release to sell over Christmas 1970, leaving little time to plan the packaging. These pressured conditions led the company to mistitle the promotional releases as \"His Band and Street Choir\" and prepare an incorrectly ordered track listing. At the end of \"I'll Be Your Lover, Too\" an unedited conversation is left on the finished record, which Peter Mills notes is an example of the album's rough edges. Janet Planet designed the album cover and wrote the sleeve notes, which sound \"a little desperate\", in the words of Brian Hinton, as she wrote, \"This is the album that you \"must\" sing with, dance to, you \"must\" find a place for these songs somewhere in your life.\"\n\nDavid Gahr took the gatefold photos of Morrison surrounded by his musicians with their wives and children at a party for Planet's son, Peter, born from a previous relationship. Morrison dismissed these photos as \"rubbish\". However, Johnny Rogan commented that the front cover looks far worse; it included a \"hilarious\" image of Morrison in a full-length kaftan. Morrison complained about the stereotypical front cover as well: \"people think you're a hippie because of the long hair and beard. ... I'd bought the kaftan in Woodstock, and that's what people were wearing.\" Mills agrees that \"Van Morrison was never a hippie, but this was as close as he came.\"\n\n\"His Band and the Street Choir\" was first released on LP on 15 November 1970 and was Morrison's third record to be produced for Warner Bros. It was re-released by the record company on CD in 1987, 1990 and 2005, and LP in 2008 with Rhino Records. On 30 October 2015, along with \"Astral Weeks\", the album was remastered and reissued by Warner Bros. Records with five session bonus tracks; three alternate takes, and two alternate versions of \"I've Been Working\" and \"I'll Be Your Lover, Too\".\n\n\"His Band and the Street Choir\" peaked at number 32 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and at number 18 on the UK Album Chart. The album received a warm reception in North America—as \"Moondance\" had done—largely due to the success of \"Domino\", a sampler single that peaked at number 9 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. This single remains Morrison's biggest US hit (as of 2010), as it climbed one place higher than his 1967 hit \"Brown Eyed Girl\", from the album \"Blowin' Your Mind!\". \"Domino\" was also a hit in the Netherlands, reaching number 22 on the Dutch Top 40. Jon Landau of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine attributed the success of \"Domino\" to the guitar figure at the beginning of the track, which he considered \"not only a great way to start a single, but a fine way to begin the album\". \"Blue Money\" debuted as the second single, faltering outside the \"Top 20\" at number 23 in the US. The final single, \"Call Me Up in Dreamland\", managed only two weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, while reaching number 95; biographer Ken Brooks believed it deserved better. John Platania recalled that Morrison \"had designs\" on securing radio airplay for \"Street Choir\", and the success of its singles reflected a growing audience and commercial appeal for his music.\n\nReviewers generally praised \"Street Choir\". Jon Landau compared it to Morrison's previous work:\n\"ZigZag\" magazine reviewer John Tobler felt, \"even if it's inferior to \"Moondance\", it is still better than eighty per cent of the records you've got in your collection.\" Robert Christgau wrote in \"The Village Voice\", \"A few humdrum cuts and an occasional minor lapse of taste make this a less compelling album than \"Moondance\", which only means it wasn't one of the very best of 1970. The good cuts, especially 'Domino' and 'Blue Money,' are superb examples of Morrison's loose, allusive white r&b.\" Biographer Brian Hinton commented that \"His Band and the Street Choir\" is \"vaguely reminiscent of Bob Dylan's \"Nashville Skyline\"\". Singer-songwriter Elvis Costello identified \"His Band and the Street Choir\" as one of his 500 essential albums and \"Street Choir\" as one of his favorite songs. In 2006 Johnny Rogan called the songs on the album \"a severe disappointment when compared to the material on the previous two albums.\"\n\nVan Morrison regarded \"Street Choir\" poorly, as he told biographer Ritchie Yorke in 1973: \"Somewhere along the line I lost control of that album. I'd rather not think about that album because it doesn't mean much in terms of where I was at ... the album didn't sell very well and I'm glad.\" Morrison first lost control of the album before its release, when it was retitled from \"Virgo's Fool\" to \"His Band and the Street Choir\":\nDespite this, assistant producer and drummer Dahaud Shaar recalled that Morrison had positive feelings towards the album at the time of its release.\n\nJanet Planet holds the view that \"There is much to love about the songs on this album: 'Blue Money', 'Crazy Face', 'Call Me Up in Dreamland', 'Domino' - these are just great songs in any era.\"\n\nAll songs written by Van Morrison.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2278341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278341", "title": "Saint Dominic's Preview", "text": "Saint Dominic's Preview\n\nSaint Dominic's Preview is the sixth studio album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison. It was released in July 1972 by Warner Bros. Records. \"Rolling Stone\" declared it \"the best-produced, most ambitious Van Morrison record yet released.\"\n\nThe diversity of the material on the album highlighted Morrison's fusing of Celtic folk, R&B, blues, jazz and the singer-songwriter genre. \"Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)\" and the title track were blends of soul and folk, while lesser known tracks such as \"Gypsy\" and \"Redwood Tree\" continued to display a lyrical celebration of nature's beauty. Also on the album were two lengthy tracks, \"Listen to the Lion\" and the closing \"Almost Independence Day\" which were given primal, cathartic and intense vocal performances from Morrison. These tracks were similar to the songs on his 1968 album, \"Astral Weeks\".\n\nThe album reached number 15 on the \"Billboard\" 200 when it was released. This would remain Morrison's best ever US success on the \"Billboard\" 200 until 2008 when \"Keep It Simple\" came in at number 10 on the \"Billboard\" chart.\n\nThe recording sessions for \"Saint Dominic's Preview\" ran between the third quarter of 1971 and the second quarter of 1972 at the Pacific High and Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco. \"Listen to the Lion\" was left over from the \"Tupelo Honey\" sessions, that took place in the summer of 1971 at Columbia Studios in San Francisco. Morrison co-produced the album with Ted Templeman, while some of the musicians who played on it were newly recruited. Morrison's band was constantly changing at the time of recording; members were sometimes unavailable, replaced or fired in between sessions.\n\n\"Listen to the Lion\" was meant to be included on \"Tupelo Honey\", but got replaced by \"You're My Woman\", the final track recorded during the session. There were two takes that were recorded; Gary Mallaber played drums on the first and Connie Kay on the second. Mallaber contributed vibraphone to the second take instead, as he remembered: \"I did one and Connie did the other. They used the one with the live vibes, which is what I played live.\" The other musicians on the recording were pianist Mark Jordan, guitarist Ronnie Montrose and bassist Bill Church. Morrison and \"Boots\" Houston provided backing vocal overdubs.\n\n\"Almost Independence Day\" was recorded at the first session at the Pacific High Studios in autumn 1971. Morrison had used the studio recently to record a concert in front of a small audience that was broadcast over radio on 5 September. It is the only song on the album to feature guitarist Ron Elliott, double bassist Leroy Vinnegar and Bernie Krause. Mark Naftalin, who plays piano and Moog synthesizer on the song, became a part of Morrison's band and played in subsequent recording sessions. Krause's high synthesizer part was overdubbed afterwards.\n\nOn January 29, 1972, Morrison returned to the Pacific High Studios to record \"Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)\" and \"Gypsy\". This time Morrison used his touring band, which included Church, Naftalin, guitarist Doug Messenger, drummer Rick Shlosser and saxophonist Jack Schroer, with overdubs added by Schroer and \"Boots\" Houston on \"Jackie Wilson Said\", and trombonist Pat O'Hara and saxophonist Jules Broussard on \"Gypsy\". The band did not have much time to rehearse \"Jackie Wilson Said\" and the parts were rewritten frequently before recording began. The first take of the song was used for the album, as Messenger remembered: \"At the end [we] all stood in silence: had [we] got it in one go? Van called for another take, but stopped a few bars in because he felt it wasn’t working. ‘I think we’ve got it.’\" \"Gypsy\" was recorded many times, but Morrison preferred the first take, because he thought it had the better vocal. There were sections of that version that the band had not played in time, which meant the bass part had to be redone. Messenger overdubbed a twelve string guitar part and backing vocals were added as well. There were two outtakes from the session, \"Take Out the Garbage, Bring in the Trash\" and \"You've Got the Power\". The former was in a similar style to James Brown, but was abandoned because, as Doug Messenger recalled, it \"did not come together quickly\". The latter had been recorded at an earlier date, but guitar overdubs were made by Messenger, and it was released as the B-side of \"Jackie Wilson Said\".\n\nThe final session was recorded at the Wally Heider Studios, San Francisco in April 1972. Gary Mallaber replaced Shlosser on drums and Tom Salisbury replaced Naftalin on piano. \"Saint Dominic's Preview\", \"I Will Be There\" and \"Redwood Tree\", the three songs recorded at the session, were arranged by Salisbury. He had perfect pitch, which allowed him to easily write down the music over the phone with instruction from Morrison: \"[I] think he was relieved to have someone like me take over the chart preparation and arrangements of the songs he still needed to record for his next album. ... Everyone in the band was very cooperative and the rehearsals went very well. As I was perhaps the most experienced musician in the band, everyone seemed to accept my position as MD, even though Van didn't introduce me as such.\"\n\nWhen asked in late May, less than two months before the eventual release of \"Saint Dominic's Preview\", how the recording for album was going, Morrison said: \"I've still got two more songs I've got to put together and right now I don't know where they're gonna come from. I'm pretty confused right now, but, y'know, I've got a feeling that everything's starting to come together … I think it's all gonna work out.\" Peter Wrench notes that Morrison had already recorded all the songs that were to feature on the album, which suggests \"that ‘Listen To The Lion’ and ‘Almost Independence Day’ were not yet confirmed for inclusion on this release.\"\n\nUnlike his two previous albums, Morrison spoke well of this one when interviewed by biographer Ritchie Yorke: \"The album was kind of rushed because of studio time and things like that. But I thought it was a good shot, that album. There were a lot of good songs on it. \"St. Dominic's Preview\" was more into where I'm at, more into what I was doing.\"\n\nThe album opens with \"Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)\", which draws from the pop, R&B, jazz and blues genres and inspired lyrically, vocally and musically by Jackie Wilson and his hit song, \"Reet Petite\".\n\nAccording to \"Rolling Stone\" reviewer Stephen Holden on \"Gypsy\": \"Van states where he's at artistically; the rhythms, alternating between double and triple time, are driving and excited, the harmonies faintly Middle Eastern, and the multiple guitar textures exotic.\"\n\n\"I Will Be There\" evokes Ray Charles, composed of heavily realistic lyrics that speak of the singer grabbing an overcoat, his toothbrush and underwear.\n\n\"Listen to the Lion\" is an eleven-minute song that begins with a mellow opening and Morrison then improvises new singing methods, turning himself into a lion with growling, wailing and various other vocal techniques as the song progresses. It has been said to be, by both technique and emotion, \"a vocal performance that remains unparalleled by his contemporaries.\" Caledonia, one of Morrison's favourite symbols, is referred to \"during the coda when he works himself up into a trancelike gospel improvisation\": \"And we sailed and we sailed and we sailed and we sailed... way up to Caledonia.\" Brian Hinton described the song: \"We are back in \"Astral Weeks\" territory, a bass led shuffle and Van lost in his own poetic universe, but here his voice takes wilder risks; growling, a near death rattle, feral grunts and roars.\" The chorus chanting \"Listen to the Lion\" behind the singer is made up of three male voices, including Morrison, \"singing at himself\".\n\nThe title track, \"Saint Dominic's Preview\", was said by Morrison to have been composed after seeing an ad for a peace vigil to be held at St. Dominic's Church in San Francisco. The song is written in a \"stream of consciousness\" fashion as with the \"Astral Weeks\" songs. Lyrics in the song refer to different stages of Morrison's life: \"chamois cleaning all the windows\" (teenage years) and \"The record company has paid out for the wine\" (his contemporary status as a pop music star). Erik Hage calls it \"expansive and groundbreaking, representing an enlarging scope and ambition in Morrison's music.\"\n\n\"Redwood Tree\" is reminiscent of \"And It Stoned Me\" on the \"Moondance\" album, with a soulful celebration of nature, water and a boy's childhood experiences.\n\n\"Almost Independence Day\" is a two-chord cycle that uses a Moog synthesizer and various musical and vocal techniques to translate to the listener the feelings the singer had while staring across the San Francisco harbour. Along with \"Listen to the Lion\", it is more than ten minutes in length and has been compared to it as being as \"musically daring in its own way\". Erik Hage describes the song as \"a mood piece, and a precursor to his 1980s work (particularly \"Common One\"), where his whole raison d'être became trying to inspire meditative states in the listener.\" Speaking of this song, Morrison told Ritchie Yorke: \"It wasn't my concept to write a sequel to 'Madame George'. I like the song though. It was just contemplating organ and the Moog. Everything was recorded live except that one high part on the synthesiser. I asked Bernie Krause to do this thing of China Town and then come in with the high part because I was thinking of dragons and fireworks. It reminded me of that. It was a stream of consciousness trip again.\"\n\nThe album charted at number 15 on the \"Billboard\" 200. This would remain Morrison's best ever U.S. charting until 2008's \"Keep It Simple\" came in at number 10 on the Billboard charts.\n\nErik Hage wrote that \"it is one of the strongest albums in the Van Morrison canon because it seems to adapt and incorporate all of the lessons and discoveries of the rich period of evolution that came before it while still opening up new windows.\" Miles Palmer writing in \"The Times\" commented that \"The cumulative impact is devastating.\"\n\nIn \"Rolling Stone\", Stephen Holden wrote that \"The coexistence of two styles on the same record turns out to be very refreshing; they complement each other by underscoring the remarkable versatility of Van's musical imagination.\" He also declared it \"the best-produced, most ambitious Van Morrison record yet released\".\n\nRobert Christgau ends his A- rated review with: \"The point being that words—which on this album are as uneven as the tunes—sometimes say less than voices. Amen.\"\n\nThe Allmusic review with a rating of 4.5 stars comments that the album, \"hangs together on the strength of its songs, an intriguingly diverse collection which draws together the disparate threads of the singer's recent work into one sterling package.\"\n\nIt was voted number 71 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). \n\nThe album was originally planned to be titled \"Green\" but it was changed after Morrison wrote the song \"Saint Dominic's Preview\" and used it as the title song. A \"Rolling Stone\" profile of Morrison in June 1972 quoted him as saying that the song had evolved from a dream about a St. Dominic's church gathering where a mass for peace in Northern Ireland was being held. \"Rolling Stone\" then commented that later while Morrison was in Nevada he read in a newspaper article that a mass was being held the next day for peace at a St. Dominic's church in San Francisco.\n\nIt was his first album not to have love as its central theme and significantly (as his marriage was deteriorating). The cover shows Morrison sitting on church steps playing guitar with ripped trousers and scruffy boots looking like a gypsy troubadour out on the street. Photographs for the album were taken by Michael Maggid in St. Anselm's Church in San Anselmo, California, near Morrison's home and where some of the recordings for the album took place, with the cover photograph shot on the steps of Montgomery Chapel on the grounds of the San Francisco Theological Seminary in San Anselmo.\n\nAll songs written by Van Morrison.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2278351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278351", "title": "Hard Nose the Highway", "text": "Hard Nose the Highway\n\nHard Nose the Highway is the seventh studio album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, released in 1973 (see 1973 in music). The album contains the single \"Warm Love,\" a fan favourite.\n\nIt is his second solo album to contain songs not written by Morrison. A cover version of the song \"Bein' Green\", usually associated with Kermit the Frog, is included, as is a take of the traditional song \"Purple Heather\".\n\nRecorded during a series of prolific recording sessions, there was more than enough material to fill a double-album. Morrison proposed the idea to Warner Bros. Records, but he was ultimately convinced to release a single LP. During the recording sessions held between August and November 1972, there were nearly thirty songs recorded in all, at least three quarters of them original compositions. A few leftover tracks were saved or re-recorded for future albums like \"Veedon Fleece\", but most would not see release until 1998's compilation of outtakes, \"The Philosopher's Stone\", when nine of the songs would be used. Biographer Clinton Heylin suggested that \"only 'Warm Love' and 'Hard Nose the Highway' could have sat comfortably alongside 'rejects' like 'Madame Joy', 'Bulbs', 'Spare Me a Little', 'Country Fair', 'Contemplation Rose' and 'Drumshanbo Hustle'.\"\n\nBy Morrison's own account, this was the first album that was completely produced under his complete control. The recording sessions even took place in a recording studio he had built next door to his home in Fairfax, California. He remarked on the album: \"As a concept for the album, I was just trying to establish how hard it was to do what I do. Plus there were some lighter things on the other side of it. One side has a kind of hard feeling while the other is soft.\"\n\n\"Snow in San Anselmo\" is the opening song and features the backing vocals of the Oakland Symphony Chamber Chorus. Morrison says the song is, \"just a sketch on when it snowed in San Anselmo. It's about the images that were happening when it was snowing there for the first time in thirty years.\"\n\n\"Warm Love\" was released as a successful single and was also a favorite concert performance in the 70s. It featured the catchy line, \"and it's ever present everywhere, Warm Love.\"\n\nThe title song, \"Hard Nose the Highway\" is explained by Morrison as: \"the theme running through the whole song is 'Seen some hard times' which I have 'Drawn some fine lines' which I definitely have, and 'No time for shoe shines' when you're trying to make a living.\"\n\n\"Wild Children\" is actually about the post-war children growing up in other countries and getting their images—from American anti-heroes such as those portrayed by James Dean, Marlon Brando, Rod Steiger and playwright Tennessee Williams.\n\n\"The Great Deception\" is according to biographer, Richie Yorke: \"One of the most stinging indictments from any observer, let alone a rock artist, of the tragic hypocrisy of so many participants in the sub-culture, in particular the big-time rock stars of this era.\"\n\n\"Being Green\" is the first non-original composition Morrison had included on any album for Warner Bros. so far and was taken from the popular American children's TV show, Sesame Street, which he must have watched with his young daughter, Shana. He says about his interpretation of the song, \"That was just a statement that you don't have to be flamboyant. If somebody doesn't like you just because you're a certain thing, then maybe they're seeing the wrong thing.\"\n\nA reviewer said about the ten and a half minute \"Autumn Song\": \"I can't deny that it's the funkiest song about the splendors and moods of fall that has ever glided through my ears.\" \n\nThe ending song, \"Purple Heather\" is the traditional \"Wild Mountain Thyme\" written by F. McPeake as a variant of Robert Tannahill's \"The Braes of Balquhidder\", and re-arranged by Morrison.\n\nAccording to Ritchie Yorke, who published his biography, \"Into the Music\" in 1975, the album enjoyed rave reviews at the time of release. He cited one dissenting critic Charlie Gillett, who wrote in \"Let It Rock\": \"The trouble with \"Hard Nose the Highway\" is that although the music is quite often interesting, it doesn't have a convincing emotional basis...Despite the lack of inspiration and of melodic focus, the record is attractive to listen to. But Van Morrison has set high standards for himself and \"Hard Nose the Highway\" doesn't live up to them.\"\n\nRobert Christgau rated it only a B− and mostly dismissed it with: \"The relaxed rhythms are just lax most of the time, the vocal surprises mild after Saint Dominic's Preview, the lyrics dumbest when they're more than mood pieces, and the song construction offhand except on 'Warm Love'.\"\n\nStephen Holden in his 1973 \"Rolling Stone\" review said: \"\"Hard Nose the Highway\" is psychologically complex, musically somewhat uneven and lyrically excellent. Its surface pleasures are a little less than those of \"St. Dominic's Preview\" and a great deal less than those of \"Tupelo Honey\", while its lyric depths are richer and more accessible than those of either predecessor. The major theme of Hard Nose is nostalgia, briefly but firmly counter-pointed by disillusion.\"\n\nLater assessments in \"The Rolling Stone Record Guide\" (1979) and \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" (1992) were less generous. In the former, \"Hard Nose\" was listed as Morrison's only one-star album to date; reviewer Dave Marsh called it \"a failed sidestep, a compromise between the visionary demands of Morrison's work and his desire for a broad-based audience.\" In the later edition, Paul Evans called the record the \"vaguest and weakest\" of Morrison's 1970s output.\n\nIn the opinion of biographer Erik Hage, \"\"Hard Nose the Highway\" seems to have suffered a lot of unnecessary criticism—many commentators consider it his worst and most uninspired album—perhaps because it followed such a remarkable run of LPs, and because two truly forward-thinking albums had come before and after it (1972's \"Saint Dominic's Preview\" and 1974's \"Veedon Fleece\").\"\n\nAll songs written by Van Morrison, unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2278358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278358", "title": "It's Too Late to Stop Now", "text": "It's Too Late to Stop Now\n\nIt's Too Late to Stop Now is a 1974 live double album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison. It features performances that were recorded in concerts at the Troubadour in Los Angeles, California; the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, and the Rainbow in London, during Morrison's three-month tour with his eleven-piece band, the Caledonia Soul Orchestra, from May to July 1973. Frequently named as one of the best live albums ever, \"It's Too Late to Stop Now\" was recorded during what has often been said to be the singer's greatest phase as a live performer.\n\nNoted for being a mercurial and temperamental live performer, during this short period of time in 1973, Morrison went on one of his most diligent tours in years. With his eleven-piece band, The Caledonia Soul Orchestra, which included a horn and string section, he has often been said to have been at his live performing peak.\n\nMorrison said about touring during this period:\nI am getting more into performing. It's incredible. When I played Carnegie Hall in the fall something just happened. All of a sudden I felt like 'you're back into performing' and it just happened like that...A lot of times in the past I've done gigs and it was rough to get through them. But now the combination seems to be right and it's been clicking a lot.\nEvidence of his newly invigorated joy in performing was on display during the ending of the over-ten-minute-long dynamic performance of \"Cyprus Avenue\". When an audience member shouts out, \"Turn it on!\", Morrison good-naturedly replies, \"It's turned on already.\" At the very end he finished the concert with a final heartfelt, \"It's too late to stop now!\" giving the album its title (this line first appeared on the song \"Into the Mystic\").\n\nThe concert performances were described by Erik Hage as \"sequences of a young soul lion whipping the crowd into a frenzy and then stopping on a dime—teasing out anticipation, rushing, receding, and coaxing every drop out of his band.\"\n\nGuitarist John Platania says \"He had a funeral for a lot of his old songs on stage. With Caledonia, he really got off on performing. There was definitely joy getting onstage at that point. That was a wonderful time for everybody. It was really like a family. Ordinarily, with rock 'n' rollers, jazzers and classical musicians in the band, you'd think it was a three-headed serpent but everybody got along famously.\"\n\nThe performances on the live album were from tapes made at the beginning of the tour in Los Angeles and also in Santa Monica and London. Marco Bario, who attended the opening night concert at The Troubadour, said in \"Playgirl\": \"he was exceptional. The mood was right, the audience was receptive, and the music left no comparisons to be made. It was the finest opening night performance by a consummate musician that I have ever witnessed.\"\nThe London concerts were the first time he had appeared in that city since performing with Them, six years earlier. The two concerts at the Rainbow Theatre in London were referred to as \"the rock event of the year\" by critics according to Ritchie Yorke in his biography. The 24 July 1973 London Rainbow concert was the first BBC simulcast broadcast simultaneously on BBC 2 television and Radio 2 stereo so that viewers with strategically sited loudspeakers could enjoy \"stereo TV\". The broadcast took place on 27 May 1974.\n\nA mixture of songs that inspired his own musical development, together with some of his own compositions, allied to a backing band and orchestra (The Caledonia Soul Orchestra) and several performances (as noted in the album's liner notes) that were recorded in concerts at The Troubadour in Los Angeles, California (24–27 May 1973), the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium (29 June 1973) and The Rainbow (23–24 July 1973) in London. These performance result in what Myles Palmer of the \"Times\" reviewed as demolishing \"all barriers between the soul, blues, jazz and rock genres\". The songs chosen went back to his days with Them with versions of \"Gloria\" and \"Here Comes the Night\". His first solo hit \"Brown Eyed Girl\" was performed but not included on the album until the reissue in 2008. M. Mark called the album \"an intelligent selection of songs that draws on six of Morrison's records and five of the musicians he learned from.\" These musicians were Bobby Bland (\"Ain't Nothing You Can Do\"), Ray Charles (\"I Believe to My Soul\"), Sam Cooke (\"Bring It On Home to Me\"), two songs by Sonny Boy Williamson II (\"Help Me\" and \"Take Your Hands Out of My Pocket\") and a cover of a Willie Dixon song, \"I Just Want to Make Love to You\", which was popularized by Muddy Waters.\n\nUnlike most live rock albums, there was no studio overdubbing allowed by Morrison, which resulted in the exclusion of \"Moondance\" from the album due to one wrong guitar note. Morrison strictly adhered to his concept of authenticity in presenting the live performance but his musical perfectionism prevented him from including \"Moondance\". \"It's common practice to go back and fix things, but not with Van,\" bass player David Hayes said, \"I think that's what makes it one of the best ever.\" It is thought to be one of the first live albums with no overdubs and the first live album to have string players.\n\nAccording to \"Elmore Magazine\"s Mike Jurkovic, when \"It's Too Late To Stop Now\" was first released in 1974, \"everyone—and I do mean everyone—tripped over themselves to hail the two-LP set as one of the greatest live renderings of the rock era.\" Reviewing the album in \"Creem\", Robert Christgau hailed it as Morrison's best since \"Moondance\" (1970) while writing, \"Songs that wore poorly or were just lame in the first place have more force and tightness here than in their studio versions\". Ken Emerson was somewhat less impressed in \"Rolling Stone\": \"On \"It's Too Late\" Morrison's voice is in fine form, but much else is not...The other musicians, most of whom have played with Morrison many times before, never detract, but Morrison could be better served...But the power of Morrison's vocals overcomes these drawbacks.\" At the end of 1974, \"It's Too Late to Stop Now\" was voted the 20th best album of the year in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics, published by \"The Village Voice\". Ellen Willis, Greil Marcus, and Christgau ranked it 2nd, 6th, and 18th, respectively, in their ballots for the poll.\n\nThree months after the concerts for the \"Too Late to Stop Now\" tour, Morrison had disbanded The Caledonia Soul Orchestra and went on a vacation tour of Ireland for three weeks that resulted in the album \"Veedon Fleece\". \n\nIn a retrospective review, Jason Ankenny from AllMusic regarded the album as \"an engaging, warm portrait of the man at the peak of his powers\", while Morrison biographer John Collis called it \"one of the most impressive of all attempts to squeeze the stage excitement of a rock performer on to vinyl.\" Fellow biographer Johnny Rogan said that \"Morrison was in the midst of what was arguably his greatest phase as a performer.\" Chris Jones of the BBC wrote: \"In a live setting all the hyperbole about Morrison's blend of genres into one Celtic, mystic vision makes perfect sense. This is soul music in a very real sense.\" Hal Horowitz with \"American Songwriter\", on reviewing the 2008 remasters of some of Morrison's albums, said, \"The classic is 1974’s double live \"It’s Too Late\"…, rightfully on anyone’s shortlist of finest concert albums. Van typically blows hot and cold on stage, but when he ignites on the oldies and choice blues covers here, few can touch him for pure blue-eyed soul passion.\" \"It's Too Late to Stop Now\" has been on lists of greatest live albums of all time. \n\nA remastered version of the album was released on 29 January 2008 containing a live take of \"Brown Eyed Girl\" not included on the original release. , This version was then not included on the 2016 reissue and is not currently available; a recording of the song from a different night was included on Volume II of the 2016 issues.\n\nOn 10 June 2016, a box set containing the three complete Los Angeles (23 May 1973), Santa Monica (29 May 1973), and London (23/24 July 1973) shows, along with a DVD of the BBC footage from the 24 July show, was released as \"..It's Too Late To Stop Now Vol. II, III, IV & DVD\".\n\n\"The compact disc version places sides one and two on disc one with sides three and four with the bonus track on disc two.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The abbey is named for St. Meinrad, a monk who died in 861. It is one of only two archabbeys in the United States and one of 11 in the world. The abbey is located approximately 15 minutes from Monastery Immaculate Conception in Ferdinand, Indiana. Immaculate Conception is for Benedictine women.\n\nThe Benedictine community at Saint Meinrad consists of men who dedicate their lives to prayer and work. They gather in community five times a day—for morning prayer, Mass, noon prayer, evening prayer and compline—to pray for the Church and the world. Guests often join the monks in prayer in the Archabbey Church.\n\nGregorian chant is sung in the canonical hours of the monastic Office, primarily in antiphons used to sing the Psalms, in the Great Responsories of Matins, and the Short Responsories of the Lesser Hours and Compline. The psalm antiphons of the Office tend to be short and simple, especially compared to the complex Great Responsories.\n\nIn addition, the monks spend private time reading spiritual and religious materials. They live under the Rule of St. Benedict, the 6th-century instructions for community living written by St. Benedict.\n\nThe abbey is named for the 8th-century Saint Meinrad of Einsiedeln.\n\nThe monks came to southern Indiana at the request of a local priest (Fr. Joseph Kundek) for assistance in addressing the pastoral needs of the growing German-speaking Catholic population and to prepare local men to be priests. St. Meinrad became an abbey in 1870, with Martin Marty as abbot and Fintan Mundwiler as prior. Saint Meinrad now operates a graduate school of theology and has more than a score of its monks in parish work, chaplaincies, and diocesan assignments.\n\nShortly after arriving in Indiana, the Benedictines began offering high school courses to local youths. In 1861, the monks expanded their general courses to include undergraduate courses in philosophy and theology. Through these programs, the monks of Saint Meinrad began their mission, which continues today: preparing men for service in the Church as priests. The undergraduate degree program, St. Meinrad College, closed in 1998, despite the fact that it began admitting men who were not seeking the priesthood, and had considered admitting women.\n\nIn 1877, the Abbot of Saint Meinrad Abbey, Martin Marty, negotiated with an agent of the LR&FS Railroad Company, for land to establish a Benedictine monastery in northern Arkansas. The Subiaco Abbey and Academy was founded on March 15, 1878, upon the arrival of three monk-missionaries from Saint Meinrad Abbey.\n\nIn 1889, a group of monks left from St. Meinrad Abbey to travel to the Archdiocese of New Orleans. They came with an invitation from the Archbishop there to found a college seminary to train local vocations. The monks founded Saint Joseph Abbey, located in Saint Benedict, near Covington, Louisiana, north of New Orleans. Saint Joseph Abbey is now the home of a total of 48 monks who run Saint Joseph Seminary College, and a number of other ministries around the Diocese.\n\nIn 1933, Saint Meinrad founded Marmion Abbey in Aurora, IL and in 1950 Blue Cloud Abbey near Marvin, South Dakota. Then, in 1958, the monks of Saint Meinrad founded Prince of Peace Abbey in Oceanside, CA. Blue Cloud Abbey was founded in order to serve the local Native American population. Due to declining numbers and an aging population, Blue Cloud was closed by its remaining members in 2012. Prince of Peace and Marmion abbeys continue to operate.\n\nIn 1954 St. Meinrad Abbey was elevated to \"Archabbey\" by the Holy See.\n\nThe Seminary and School of Theology offers graduate-level degrees in theology. Priesthood candidates work toward a Master of Divinity. Lay degree students can earn a Master of Arts (Theology) or a Master of Arts (Pastoral Theology). A two-year pre-theology program leads to a Master of Catholic Philosophical Studies.\n\nSaint Meinrad began offering lay degree programs in 1969, although students worked on their degrees during the six-week Summer Session program. In the fall of 1993, the Seminary and School of Theology expanded its mission to allow lay ministry students to attend classes during any of the academic terms. While some classes specifically aimed at ordination preparation are reserved for MDiv students, lay ministers sometimes pursue their graduate degrees as part-time or full-time students. More than 5,000 men and women have studied in the School of Theology.\n\nOther programs in the Seminary and School of Theology include a permanent deacon formation program, which assists Catholic dioceses in the formation of their deacon candidates, and a youth and vocations program, which encourages high school and college students to participate more deeply in the Church's liturgy and consider a vocation of service to the Church.\n\nThe Seminary and School of Theology also houses the Institute for Priests and Presbyterates, which offers continuing formation for priests making the transition from seminary to parish life, priests preparing for their first assignment as pastor, and presbyterates - which is the group of priests and their bishop in a Catholic diocese.\n\nIn 1995, there was a controversy over the firing of a theologian, Carmel McEnroy, who taught at the school. In the spring of 1994, Pope John Paul II had issued an Apostolic Letter declaring the issue of the ordination of women as priests resolved and no longer open to debate. Several months after the statement was issued, Dr. McEnroy joined 1,500 others in signing an open letter opposing the Pope's teachings on the subject. After reading the open letter in the National Catholic Reporter, the Archabbot determined that Dr. McEnroy must be removed from the faculty at Saint Meinrad for publicly dissenting from the Pope's teachings. Dr. McEnroy sued on a claim of breach of contract. The lower court dismissed the case, citing lack of jurisdiction, which decision was upheld on appeal.\n\nSaint Meinrad Archabbey owned and operated an international company that produced and marketed religious, spiritual and inspirational cards, books and gifts. At one time, Abbey Press was one of the largest business enterprises in Spencer County, Indiana, with more than 100 employees.\n\nThe press was founded in 1867 when the Benedictine monks purchased a used printing press. Abbey Press marketed its products throughout the United States and in 25 English-speaking countries. More than 20 foreign companies are licensed to print some of Abbey Press' publications in native languages. Net proceeds from the sales of Abbey Press products support the good work and ministries of Saint Meinrad Archabbey.\nAs of June 30, 2017, Abbey Press closed and the printing presses and other equipment were sold. Just over 70 people lost their jobs.\n\nAbbey Caskets is a work of Saint Meinrad Archabbey. Founded in 1999, Abbey Caskets offers handcrafted wooden caskets and cremation urns directly to the public. The caskets and cremation urns are made from solid hardwoods, in the choice of poplar, cherry, walnut and oak. The Monastic Abbey Casket is designed after the caskets used by the monks of Saint Meinrad. Abbey Caskets also offers a more conventional casket, the Traditional Abbey Casket. All proceeds from the sales of the caskets and cremation urns support Saint Meinrad Archabbey and the Seminary and School of Theology.\n\n\n\nFässler, Thomas OSB: \"Of Mothers, Daughters, and Growing Up.

It features random encounters with side-scrolling battles, although some boss battles are fought with a traditional menu-based system. There are also a few platforming sections.\n\nIn single-player mode, the main character is Jack. The game can be switched between single player and multiplayer at will, with the second player controlling Ryu. Jack and Ryu share statistics, so one character never overpowers the other.\n\n\"Super Ninja Boy\" features a password system to record progress.\n\nIt is a sequel to Culture Brain's previous title, \"Little Ninja Brothers\" for the NES and contains a few cameos from other Culture Brain's games.\n\n\"Super Ninja Boy\" combines classic role-playing video game elements with action game elements. The player controls the main character Jack (or two players can control both Jack and Ryu) and randomly encounters enemies on the world map and in dungeons. In side-scrolling battles, the player can jump, punch, throw enemies, use items like shurikens or techniques such as the super jump or fireball. Battles take place in a beat'em up style and end after a specific number of enemies are killed (no matter how many are still remaining on screen). Boss battles are fought in a turn-based RPG style, using the same items and skills as normally.\n\nThere are also some 2D platform areas, which play the same as the normal battles without depth (the player can only go right or left).\n\n"}

He is most widely known, however, as a solo artist, as well as a participant in many other groups, such as Bisso Na Bisso and Dis l'heure 2 zouk.\n\nPassi was born on 21 December 1972, in Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo. In 1979, his family moved to Sarcelles, a suburb of Paris. He graduated from \"lycée\" and created the band \"Ministère AMER\" with Stomy Bugsy, who he had gone to school with. The group's first album, \"Pourquoi tant de haine?\", was released in 1992, and Passi was forced to end his agronomy studies at the University of Paris (Nanterre) to be able to focus on music. Ministère AMER followed up with \"95200\" which was released in 1994.\n\nPassi's first solo album, \"Les tentations\", was released in 1997, and it sold 450,000 copies. The project \"Bisso na Bisso\" (meaning 'Just between ourselves' in Lingala, Congo's most widely spoken language), was a collective of French hip hop artists with African origins. It included names such as Ärsenik, and he released their album \"Racines\" in 1999. That same year, Passi released his second solo album, \"Genèse\".\n\nIn 2002, Passi was asked to create the anthem for the African Nations Cup football competition together with Congolese singer Papa Wemba. The two eventually managed to attract into the project such names as Youssou N'Dour and Cheb Mami. Passi's third album, \"Odyssée\", came out in 2004.\n\nPassi is also known as the artist whose song, \"Il fait chaud\" (\"It's hot\"), was featured in the last episode in the television show, \"Sex and the City\". The song was not credited at the end of the show, leaving many viewers to call the song simply \"The French Rap\".\n\nPassi appeared in an episode of Season 27 of The Amazing Race in 2015, in which teams were required to perform one of his songs, \"79 à 99\", as part of a detour challenge. If their French pronunciation, rhythm and vibes were correct, Passi would give them their next clue.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is also home to of protected forest and three recreational areas (Fairfax, Hardin Ridge, and Paynetown). Indiana's only federally protected U.S. Wilderness Area, the Charles C. Deam Wilderness Area, is located on the south shore. The pool elevation (above sea level) is about 538 ft (164 m) year-round. During colder winters, limited ice fishing is available on protected backwater portions of the reservoir.\n\nRansburg Scout Reservation, a large Boy Scout camp comprising over 624 acres, is situated along the eastern shore with a private dock system in Siscoe Bay (also known as Boy Scout Bay). The largest marina situated on the lake is the Fourwinds Resort and Marina with over 800 boats. The reservoir provides abundant fishing throughout the year, and recreational opportunities such as boating and water skiing attract visitors from throughout Indiana and the Midwest.\n\nConstruction on the lake began in 1960 and was finished in 1965 at a cost of $16.5 million. Salt Creek was dammed south of Bloomington, Indiana and the reservoir fills the valley to the northeast of the dam extending into adjacent Brown County. It was thought that Elkinsville, a town in southern Brown County, had to be abandoned due to the path of the backwaters. Therefore, the town was acquired through the power of eminent domain. Later, this was found not to be necessary; the result of a mistake in elevation estimates. The lake was designed as a primary water source for the City of Bloomington and to prevent flood damage downstream. The lake was created and is still managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Louisville District.\n\n"}

New seating areas for disabled spectators were also added. At the same time, the press box has been lowered and moved towards the pitch. These improvements came with a reduction in overall capacity by around 3,000 seats.\n\nAtalanta officially acquired the stadium on 8 August 2017, completing an €8.6 million transaction with the city government.

Mann, the first violinist at Juilliard, served on the school's string quartet for over fifty years until his retirement in 1997.\n\nMann played and performed on many instruments, including those made by Antonio Stradivari and John Young. Mann was the subject of a 2014 documentary, titled \"Speak the Music\".\n\nMann was born and raised in Portland, Oregon. His father worked as a tailor and a grocer. Mann began his study of the violin at age nine; at 13, he was accepted into the class of Edouard Hurlimann, concertmaster of the Portland Symphony. He attended the Portland Youth Philharmonic, but had planned to become a forest ranger in his youth.\n\nIn 1938, at the age of eighteen, he moved to New York City to enroll in the Juilliard School, where he studied violin with Edouard Dethier, composition with Bernard Wagenaar and Stefan Wolpe, and conducting with Edgar Schenkman. Mann won the prestigious Naumburg Competition in 1941 and made his New York debut two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Shortly after his graduation from Juilliard, he was drafted into the US Army.\n\nAt the invitation of Juilliard’s president, William Schuman, Mann founded the Juilliard String Quartet in 1946 and served as the ensemble’s first violinist until his retirement from the quartet in 1997. The quartet, which celebrated its golden jubilee during the 1996–97 season, had played approximately 5,000 concerts and performed more than 600 works, including some 100 premieres. Its discography includes recordings of more than 100 compositions. They have received three Grammy awards for their recordings.\n\nMann composed more than 30 works for narrator with various instruments that he performed with his wife, the actress Lucy Rowan; several have been recorded on the Musical Heritage label.

The Kumam are an ethnic group of people found in Kaberamaido district, district in Eastern Uganda. Formerly they shared Soroti district with the Iteso and some parts of formerly Lira district with the Langi. In the Lango region, they are now found in Dokolo district which was detached from Lira Distict. They are found at the shores of Lake Kyoga (Namasale). In Soroti district, they are found in Serere, Asuret, Soroti town as well as the outskirts of Soroti district neighboring Kaberamaido. \n\nThey speak a Luo language similar to the language spoken by the Lango, with some Ateso vocabulary.\n\nKumam traditions say are part of the Iteso people. They probably lost their Eastern Nilotic Ateker language and took up the Western Nilotic Luo spoken by their Lango and Acholi neighbours – due to prolonged contact and intermarriages.\n\nThe Kumam descend from the early fishing, agricultural, and herding communities of Ethiopia. They migrated southwards towards Uganda because of land pressure around the 17th century. Today, they live on the shores of Lake Kyoga in the districts of Serere, Soroti and Kaberamaido\n\nThe Kumam had political structure under clan leaders known as \"wegi Atekerin\". Other people of importance in the society were \"wegi ikodeta Cel \"(leaders of dancing groups), and leaders of \"Asonya\"(ancient) homes, \"wegi Cel\". The \"wegi Cel\" were in most cases \"Dogolan\" or \"Odonge ikekoros\" (heads of part of a clan descending form one man). These clan leaders were responsible for the maintenance of law and order as well as general administration. They arbitrated in matters of politics and social affairs.\n\nMusic, dance and story telling played a big part in kumam lifestyle. At any time music would be made, at various functions, such as ceremonial, religious and political functions. In the evening, the old people would narrate stories to the younger generation as part of the oral traditions.\n\nPreviously, the parents would arrange marriages for their children. Girls would be betrothed to boys at an early age. In effect, the young girl would become wife to a respective boy but she would wait to be officially handed over when she came of age. In some cases, the young girls so betrothed would be taken to the boy's home to grow up there. When she came of age, a ceremony would be organized to formalize the relationship. With time however the system changed.

Rajmata Ahilyabai was born in the village of Chondi in Jamkhed, Ahmednagar, Maharashtra. She moved the capital to Maheshwar south of Indore on the Narmada River.\n\nAhilyabai's husband Khanderao Holkar was killed in the battle of Kumbher in 1754. Twelve years later, her father-in-law, Malhar Rao Holkar, died. A year after that she was crowned as the queen of the Malwa kingdom. She tried to protect her kingdom from plundering invaders. She personally led armies into battle. She appointed Tukoji Rao Holkar as the Chief of Army.\n\nRani Ahilyabai was a great pioneer and builder of Hindu temples. She built hundreds of temples and Dharmashalas throughout India.\n\nAhilyabai was born on 31 May 1725 in the village of Chaundi, in the present-day Ahmednagar district in Maharashtra. Her father, Mankoji Rao Shinde, was the Patil of the village. Women then did not go to school, but Ahilyabai's father taught her to read and write.\n\nHer entrance on to the stage of history was something of an accident: Malhar Rao Holkar, a commander in the service of the Maratha Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao and lord of the Malwa territory, stopped in Chaundi on his way to Pune and, according to legend, saw the eight-year-old Ahilyabai at the temple service in the village. Recognising her piety and her character, he brought the girl to the Holkar territory as a bride for his son, Khanderao (1723–1754). She was married to Khanderao Holkar in 1733. In 1745, she gave birth to their son Malerao and in 1748, a daughter Muktabai. Malerao was mentally unwell and died of his illness in 1767. Ahilyabai broke another tradition when she married her daughter to Yashwantrao a brave but poor man after he succeeded in defeating the dacoits.\n\nHer husband was killed during the siege of Kumher in 1754. In 1754, on request of support from Imad-ul-Mulk, the Mughal Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur's \"Mir Bakhshi\", Ahilya Bai's husband Khanderao Holkar, in the army of his father Malhar Rao Holkar, laid the siege of Kumher fort of Jat Maharaja Suraj Mal of Bharatpur State who had sided with the Mughal Emperor's rebellious wazir Safdar Jang. Khanderao was inspecting his troops on an open palanquin in the battle of Kumher when was hit and killed by a cannonball from the Jat army. After his death in 1754, his father Malhar Rao prevented his wife Ahilya Bai from committing sati. Malhar Rao Holkar died in 1766, 12 years after the death of his son Khanderao. Malhar Rao's grandson and Khanderao's only son Male Rao Holkar became the ruler of Indore in 1766, under the regentship of Ahilyabai, but he too died within few months on 5 April 1767. Ahilyabai became the ruler of Indore after the death of her son with Khanderao.\n\nA letter to her from her father-in-law Malhar Rao in 1765 illustrates the trust he had in her ability during the tempestuous battle for power in the 18th century:\n\nAlready trained to be a ruler, Ahilyabai petitioned the Peshwa after Malhar's death, and the death of her son, to take over the administration herself. Some in Malwa objected to her assumption of rule, but the army of Holkar supported her leadership. She led them in person, with four bows and quivers of arrows fitted to the corners of the howdah of her favourite elephant. The Peshwa granted her permission on 11 December 1767, and, with Subhedar Tukojirao Holkar (Malharrao's adopted son) as the head of military matters, she proceeded to rule Malwa in a most enlightened manner, even reinstating a Brahmin who had opposed her. Ahilyabai daily public audience and was always accessible to anyone who needed her ear.\n\nAmong Ahilyabai's accomplishments was the development of Indore from a small village to a prosperous and beautiful city; her own capital, however, was in nearby Maheshwar, a town on the banks of the Narmada river. She also built forts and roads in Malwa, sponsored festivals and gave donations for regular worship in many Hindu temples. Outside Malwa, she built dozens of temples, ghats, wells, tanks and rest-houses across an area stretching from the Himalayas to pilgrimage centres in South India. The Bharatiya Sanskritikosh lists as sites she embellished, Kashi, Gaya, Somnath, Ayodhya, Mathura, Hardwar, Kanchi, Avanti, Dwarka, Badrinarayan, Rameshwar and Jaganathpuri. Ahilyadevi also supported the rise of merchants, farmers and cultivators to levels of affluence, and did not consider that she had any legitimate claim to their wealth, be it through taxes or feudal right.\n\nThere are many stories of her care for her people. In one instance, when her minister refused to allow the adoption unless he was suitably bribed, she is said to have sponsored the child herself, and given him clothes and jewels as part of the ritual. To honour the memory of Ahilyadevi Holkar, in 1996 leading citizens of Indore instituted an award in her name to be bestowed annually on an outstanding public figure. The Prime Minister of India gave away the first award to Nanaji Deshmukh.\n\nAhilyadevi was not able to settle the conflict peacefully in the case of the Bhils and Gonds, who plundered her borders; but she granted them waste hilly lands and the right to a small duty on goods passing through their territories. Even in this case, according to Malcolm, she did give \"considerate attention to their habits\".\n\nAhilyabai's capital at Maheshwar was the scene of literary, musical, artistic and industrial enterprise. She entertained the famous Marathi poet, Moropant and the shahir, Anantaphandi from Maharashtra, and also patronised the Sanskrit scholar, Khushali Ram. Craftsmen, sculptors and artists received salaries and honours at her capital, and she even established a textile industry in the city of Maheshwar.\n\nAfter her death, she was succeeded by Tukoji Rao Holkar I, her commander-in-chief, who soon abdicated the throne in favour of his son Kashi Rao Holkar in 1797.\n\nAhilyabai died on 13th August, 1795 at the age of 70. A woman of modern times Ahilyabai's rule is remembered as a golden age in Indore’s history. Ironically, her daughter became a Sati by jumping into the funeral pyre when her husband, Yashwantrao Phanse, died. Ahilyabai was succeeded by her commander-in-chief, Tukoji Rao Holkar.\n\n\"The reign of Ahilyabai, of Indore in central India, lasted for thirty years. This has become almost legendary as a period during which perfect order and good government prevailed and the people prospered. She was a very able ruler and organizer, highly respected during her lifetime, and considered as a saint by a grateful people after her death.\" An English poem written by Joanna Baillie in 1849 reads:\n<poem>\n\"For thirty years her reign of peace,\nThe land in blessing did increase;\nAnd she was blessed by every tongue,\nBy stern and gentle, old and young.\nYea, even the children at their mother's feet\nAre taught such homely rhyming to repeat\n\"In latter days from Brahma came,\nTo rule our land, a noble Dame,\nKind was her heart and bright her fame,\nAnd Ahlya was her honored name.\"\n</poem>The Great Maratha lady who affords the noblest example of wisdom, goodness, and virtue. One English writer quoted that Akbar is among male sovereigns, and Ahilyabai is among female sovereigns\".\n\n\"Ahilyabai's extraordinary ability won her the regard of her subjects and of the other Maratha confederates, including Nana Phadnavis. Collecting oral memories of her in the 1820s, Sir John Malcolm, the British official most directly concerned with the 'settlement' of central India, seems to have become deeply enamored of her.\n\"With the natives of Malwa ... her name is sainted and she has styled an avatar or Incarnation of the Divinity. In the soberest view that can be taken of her character, she certainly appears, within her limited sphere, to have been one of the purest and most exemplary rulers that ever existed\". (J. Malcolm) \nJohn Keay called her 'The Philosopher Queen', a reference perhaps to the 'Philosopher king' Bhoj:\n\n\"This great ruler in Indore encouraged all within her realm to do their best, Merchants produced their finest clothes, trade flourished, the farmers were at peace and oppression ceased, for each case that came to the queen's notice was dealt with severely. She loved to see her people prosper, and to watch the fine cities grow, and to watch that her subjects were not afraid to display their wealth, lest the ruler should snatch it from them. Far and wide the roads were planted with shady trees, and wells were made, and rest-houses for travelers. The poor, the homeless, the orphaned were all helped according to their needs. The Bhils who had long been the torment of all caravans were routed from their mountain fastnesses and persuaded to settle down as honest farmers. Hindu and Musalman alike revered the famous Queen and prayed for her long life. Her last great sorrow was when her daughter became a Sati upon the death of Yashwantrao Phanse. Ahalya Bai was seventy years old when her long and splendid life closed. Indore long mourned its noble Queen, happy had been her reign, and her memory is cherished with deep reverence unto this day.\" (Annie Besant\n\n\"From the original papers and letters, it becomes clear that she was the first-class politician, and that was why she readily extended her support to Mahadji Shinde. I have no hesitation in saying that without the support of Ahilyabai, Mahadji would never have gained so much importance in the politics of northern India.\" (Historian Judunath Sarkar)\n\n\"Definitely no woman and no ruler are like Ahilyabai Holkar.\" (Nizam of Hyderabad)\n\n\"It reveals beyond doubt that all ideal virtues described by Plato and Bhattacharya were present in her personalities like Dilip, Janak, Shri Ram, Shri Krishna, and Yudhishthir. After thorough scrutiny of the long history of the world, we find only one personality of Lokmata Devi Ahilya that represents an absolutely ideal ruler.\" (Arvind Javlekar)\n\nA commemorative stamp was issued in her honour on 25 August 1996 by the Republic of India.\n\nAs a tribute to the great ruler, Indore domestic airport has been named Devi Ahilyabai Holkar Airport. Similarly, Indore university has been renamed as \"Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya\".\n\nIt was the specialty of the Holkar family that they did not use public funds to meet their personal and family expenses. They had their personal fund from their private property. Ahilyabai inherited personal funds which at that time was estimated to be sixteen crores rupees. Ahilyabai used the personal fund in charitable works.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2278480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278480", "title": "Hungarian pengő", "text": "Hungarian pengő\n\nThe pengő (; sometimes written as \"pengo\" or \"pengoe\" in English) was the currency of Hungary between 1 January 1927, when it replaced the korona, and 31 July 1946, when it was replaced by the forint. The pengő was subdivided into 100 fillér. Although the introduction of the pengő was part of a post-World War I stabilisation program, the currency survived for only 20 years and experienced the most serious case of hyperinflation ever recorded.\n\nThe Hungarian participle \"pengő\" means 'ringing' (which in turn derives from the verb \"peng\", an onomatopoeic word equivalent to English 'ring') and was used from the 15th to the 17th century to refer to silver coins making a ringing sound when struck on a hard surface, thus indicating their precious metal content. (The onomatopoeic word used for gold coins is \"csengő\", an equivalent of English 'clinking' meaning a sharper sound; the participle used for copper coins is \"kongó\" meaning a deep pealing sound.) After the introduction of forint paper money in Hungary, the term \"pengő forint\" was used to refer to forint coins literally meaning 'ringing forint', figuratively meaning 'silver forint' or 'hard currency'.\n\nAt the beginning of the First World War precious metal coins were recalled from circulation, and in the early 1920s all coins disappeared because of the heavy inflation of the Hungarian korona. The name \"pengő\" was probably chosen to suggest stability. However, there was some controversy when choosing the name of the new currency, though the majority agreed that a Hungarian name should be chosen. Proposals included \"turul\" (a bird from Hungarian mythology), \"turán\" (from the geographical name and ideological term Turan), \"libertás\" (the colloquial name of the poltura coins issued by Francis II Rákóczi), and \"máriás\" (the colloquial name of coins depicting Mary, patroness of Hungary).\n\nThe denomination of the banknotes was indicated in the languages of ethnicities living in the territory of Hungary. The name of the currency was translated as follows: \"Pengö\" ( \"Pengö\") in German, \"pengő\" ( \"pengi\") in Slovak, пенгов ( пенгова) in Cyrillic script Serbo-Croatian, пенгыв ( пенгывов, later пенге) in Rusyn, and \"pengő\" ( \"pengei\", later \"penghei\") in Romanian. Later \"pengov\" ( \"pengova\"), the Latin script Serbo-Croatian version was also added.\n\nThe symbol of the pengő was P and it was divided into 100 fillér (symbol: f).\n\nAfter the First World War, according to article 206 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain, the Austro-Hungarian Bank (the joint bank of the Monarchy) had to be liquidated and the Austro-Hungarian krone had to be replaced with a different currency, which in the case of Hungary was the Hungarian korona. This currency suffered a high rate of inflation during the early 1920s. A stabilisation program covered by League of Nations loan helped bring down inflation, and the korona could be replaced on 1 January 1927 by a new currency, the \"pengő\", which was introduced by Act XXXV of 1925 It was valued at 12,500 korona, and defined as 3,800 to one kilogram of fine gold – which meant that the pengő was pegged to the gold standard, however, without exchange obligation. In the beginning the cover ratio (which included gold and – to 50% – foreign exchange) was fixed at 20% which had to be raised to 33.3% within five years. This goal was reached quickly: the cover ratio was 51% on 31 July 1930. Later it decreased somewhat due to the economic and financial crisis caused by the Great Depression. Until then the pengő was the most stable currency of the region.\n\nThe effects of the Great Depression reached Hungary after 1930 and it hit predominantly agriculture. The pengő had to be devalued and the debt of the country increased. After a short period of recovery, the war preparations – amongst which the most important was the Győr-program – had loosened the financial and monetary discipline which in turn led to the depreciation of the pengő currency. The territories given back to Hungary by the First and Second Vienna Awards in 1938 and 1940 were economically less developed, which was an additional aggravating factor regarding the economic situation of the country.\n\nThe war caused enormous costs and, later, even higher losses to the relatively small and open Hungarian economy. The national bank was practically under government control, and the issue of money was proportional to the budget demands. By this time, silver coins disappeared from circulation, and, later, even bronze and cupro-nickel coins were replaced by coins made of cheaper metal. In the last act of the world war, the Szálasi government took control of banknote printing and issued notes without any cover, first in Budapest, then in Veszprém when Budapest had to be evacuated. The occupying Soviet army issued its own military money according to the Hague Conventions.\n\nThe pengő lost value after World War II, suffering the highest rate of hyperinflation ever recorded. There were several attempts to break down inflation, such as a 75% capital levy in December 1945. However, this did not stop the hyperinflation, and prices continued spiraling out of control, with ever-higher denominations introduced. The denominations \"milpengő\" (one million pengő) and \"b.-pengő\" (pronunciation: \"bilpengő\", one trillion () pengő) were used to alleviate calculations, cut down the number of zeros and enable the reuse of banknote designs with only the colour and denomination name changed.\n\nThe adópengő (lit. \"tax pengő\") was introduced on 1 January 1946 as an accounting unit for budget planning. However, from 8 July 1946, it was allowed to be used as legal tender. It was intended to retain its value as the pengő's fell. However, although its value rose dramatically relative to the pengő (finally reaching pengő), the adópengő nevertheless suffered severely from inflation. By July 1946, the adópengő became the only circulating currency as the pengő's value had fallen to such an extent that even the 100 million b.-pengő note was effectively worthless.\n\nThe Hungarian economy could only be stabilized by the introduction of a new currency, and therefore, on 1 August 1946, the forint was reintroduced at a rate of (400 octillion) = pengő, dropping 29 zeros from the old currency. In effect, the total amount of circulating pengő notes had a value of less than 0.1 fillér ( forint). A more realistic comparison was the exchange rate with the adópengő, which was set at (hence the ratio, mentioned above). The exchange rate for gold was set at 13.21 forint per gram.\n\nIn 1926, coins of 1, 2, 10, 20 and 50 fillér and 1 pengő were introduced. The 1 and 2 fillér pieces were bronze, the 10, 20 and 50 fillér were cupro-nickel and the 1 pengő coins were 64% silver. In 1929, 2 pengő coins were introduced, also in 64% silver. Commemorative 2 and 5 pengő coins were also issued on anniversaries, with a non-commemorative 5 pengő coin issued in 1939.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the 1 fillér ceased production, the 2 fillér coins were issued in steel and then zinc, the 10 and 20 fillér coins were minted in steel and the 1, 2 and 5 pengő pieces were of aluminium.\n\nIn 1945, the provisional government issued aluminium 5 pengő coins which were the last coins issued before the hyperinflation.\n\nThe Hungarian National Bank issued the first series of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 pengő banknotes in the last days of 1926. These were offset prints on watermarked paper (except for the 5 pengő note). The banknotes featured the outstanding people of Hungarian history on the obverse and either different sites of Budapest or paintings on the reverse: the banknotes also served educational purposes.\nA new series of banknotes had to be printed soon to meet higher security standards. The engravings were executed and designed by Endre Horváth, Hungarian graphic artist. New 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pengő notes were printed and even a 1000 pengő banknote was added to this series - however, the latter had such a high value that a big proportion of the people hardly ever saw any. This new series had almost the same topic as the previous. On the other hand, the 5 pengő notes were soon replaced with silver coins.\nAfter the Vienna Award, Hungary had to supply its recovered territories with money. Since increasing the amount of silver coins would have been too expensive, 1 and 5 pengő notes were issued in 1941 and 1938, respectively. These notes were of simple design and poor quality. Meanwhile, a series of new banknotes including 2, 5, 10 and 20 pengő denominations was issued. The design represented ornaments based on Hungarian folk art and people.\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, the Szálasi government and the occupying Soviet army issued provisional notes in the territories under their power without any cover.\nIn 1945 and 1946, hyperinflation caused the issuance of notes up to 100 million b.-pengő (100 quintillion or 10 pengő). During the hyperinflation, note designs were reused, changing the colour and replacing the word pengő with first milpengő, then b.-pengő, to generate higher denominations. The largest denomination produced was 100 million b.-pengő (100 quintillion or 10 pengő). The note was initially worth about US$0.20. Notes of one milliard b.-pengő (one sextillion or 10 pengő) were printed but never issued.\nThe introduction of adópengő was an attempt to limit inflation. It slowed inflation somewhat, but did not stop the depreciation of the currency. Bonds were issued by the Ministry of Finance in denominations between and adópengő. These simple design notes on low-quality paper became legal currency in the last months of the hyperinflation, almost completely replacing the pengő.\n\nThe enormous amount of paper consumed during the production of the inflation pengő notes caused a shortage of good quality security paper; this hindered the production of forint banknotes.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The area includes the doctrine of restraint of trade and, particularly in the United Kingdom, has largely been submerged in the twentieth century by statutory interventions on collective labour law and modern competition law, and certain laws governing intellectual property, particularly unfair competition law. The \"absence of any unifying principle drawing together the different heads of economic tort liability has often been remarked upon.\"\n\nThe principal torts are:\n\nThese torts represent the common law's historical attempt to balance the need to protect claimants against those who inflict economic harm and the wider need to allow effective, even aggressive, competition (including competition between employers and their workers).\n\nTwo cases demonstrate economic torts' affinity to competition and labour law. In \"Mogul Steamship Co Ltd\" the plaintiffs argued they had been driven from the Chinese tea market by a 'shipping conference', that had acted together to underprice them. But this cartel was ruled lawful and \"nothing more [than] a war of competition waged in the interest of their own trade.\" Nowadays, this would be considered a criminal cartel.\n\nIn English labour law the most notable case is \"Taff Vale Railway v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants\". The House of Lords thought that unions should be liable in tort for helping workers to go on strike for better pay and conditions. But it riled workers so much that it led to the creation of the British Labour Party and the Trade Disputes Act 1906. Further torts used against unions include conspiracy, interference with a commercial contract or intimidation.\n\nSeveral of the economic torts in English law, in particular inducing breach of contract and \"tortious interference\" (otherwise known as causing loss by unlawful means), have been reviewed and clarified by the House of Lords:\n\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada, favouring the ruling in \"OBG\", standardized Canadian jurisprudence with respect to the \"tort of unlawful interference with economic relations\" (which it preferred to call \"causing loss by unlawful means\", or the \"unlawful means tort\").

He has remained popular for more than four decades. Lam produces most of his own albums, writes many of his own songs, occasionally writes for other artists, and covers other people's songs. He is the mastermind of his concerts and many of his LP/CD cover designs. Being very innovative, he came up with the very first Cantopop rap, \"Ah Lam's Diary\", with lyrics written by himself. In addition, he pioneered the stringing together of many hit Cantopop songs to create a 10-minute long medley called \"10 Minutes 12 Inches\". In 2019, Lam intricately interwoven his songs together to put on a musical-like concert, Lamusical.\n\nOver the years, he has introduced a wide variety of songs to the Hong Kong music scene, with many of his own compositions and covers becoming classics of Cantopop. One of his special talents is in picking which songs to do covers of among a wide variety of sources, including songs from the United Kingdom, United States, Continental Europe, Russia, Middle East, Latin America, Japan, etc. The songs he chose for such covers range from classical music, songs from musicals, Hebrew folk song, to funk and rock and roll. His own compositions and covers encompass a very wide stylistic range, from country rock, rhythm and blues, rock and roll, funk, jazz, rap, Chinese-style tunes to tango and bossa nova. He is particularly skillful in interpreting and performing all songs in his own inimitable style. Lam has a wide vocal range and is known for excelling in many different genres of music. He can sing powerfully in fast rhythmic numbers and in a very heartfelt way in romantic ballads.\n\nIn recognition of his contribution to the music scene, Lam was awarded numerous awards, including the Golden Needle Award in 1994, the CASH Hall of Fame Award in 2003, the J.S.G. Lifetime Achievement Award in 2015, and the RTHK Hall of Fame Award in 2016.\n\nIn addition to his singing career, Lam has also acted in some TV dramas, and played lead roles in many films, making his film debut in \"Luckies Trio\" in 1978. Possibly his most memorable role was as a Japanese journalist in \"Boat People\" (1982), directed by Ann Hui.\n\nLam is very sporty. He used to love playing tennis and now he loves playing golf. He is very creative. Besides composing songs, he also likes to draw and is especially good at drawing mazes. In 2013, an intricate maze artwork drawn by Lam was depicted and engraved onto the cassock of a Lalique crystal Buddha. This was the very first collaboration project that the French brand Lalique had worked with a Chinese artist. Lam also likes to tailor used clothes to his own taste.\n\nLam was born in Hong Kong. He was born to a family of physicians, with both his father and paternal grandfather being doctors. He attended Tak Sun Primary School, then Diocesan Boys' School, a predominantly English-language boys school, where he was a boarder. At the latter school, he chose to study French rather than Chinese.\n\nLam started to pick up music at a young age. His grandfather often took him to movies, both Chinese and Western ones, which exposed him to film music. In addition, his mom loved to sing and dance while his dad loved listening to music and playing piano. All this constant music around him kindled his interest in this art form. He started to love listening to music on the radio when he was a teenager and taught himself to play guitar. In 1965, Lam left Hong Kong to further his studies in the U.K. During this time and his subsequent stay in the United States his musical horizon was further broadened by exposure to a great variety of musical genres in those countries.\n\nWhen he first went to the U.K. in 1965, he attended Dover College (he was a Leamingtonian there) under the headship of Timothy Cobb. His long time pal Ching Y. Wong, S.C. also went to the college from Diocesan Boys' School. After about a year, he transferred to Barcote School of Coaching to join his brother, Tony. There he formed a folk song group, The Midnighters, with two friends. Lam paid a return visit to both colleges in January 2019.\n\nAfter his studies in the U.K., Lam worked for a few years there before moving to California, where he coached tennis and worked in a stock brokerage firm. It was at this time he started writing his own songs. Not long thereafter, he returned to Hong Kong to launch his music career.\nInitially, Lam was one of the lead singers in a band called \"Jade\". In 1976, he went solo with his first English album,\"Lam\". His first Cantonese album came out in 1978. In 1980, both his own compositions《在水中央》and《分分鐘需要你》won the Top Ten Chinese Gold Songs Awards. Throughout the 1980s, Lam had 23 songs that topped the RTHK Chinese Pop Chart, second only to Alan Tam, who had 28. Lam has also hosted some TV music programs, acted in some TV dramas, and played lead roles in many films.\n\nIn May 2003, Lam accidentally fell down a 2.5-metre deep floor opening while he was performing on stage at the Hong Kong Coliseum as a guest of Lisa Wang. This fall injured his right ear, which lost part of its hearing, particularly in high frequencies, and resulted in tinnitus. Thereafter, he could essentially only hear sounds in mono. A few months after his injury, he purposely put on a series of concerts in southern China to get used to his new hearing problems. Within a short period of time, he managed to adapt to this new reality and was able to perform very well on stage and resume his career in full.\n\nLam has remained popular in Hong Kong for more than four decades. Over time, Lam has not only gained the recognition and respect of his peers such as Anita Mui, Leslie Cheung, and Paula Tsui, he has also played a part in shaping the Hong Kong music scene, as many of today's top singers such as Eason Chan, Hacken Lee, and Andy Lau were influenced by his music.\n\nLam married Ng Ching Yuen in 1980. Together, they have a son, Alex Lam Tak Shun, who is also a singer and actor, and a daughter April. Lam and Ng divorced in 1994. On 17 July 1996, he married singer and actress Sally Yeh.\n\nLam has a very wide tenor range. His highest notes could reach F5, D#6 in full head voice and volume rather than soft falsetto, and also a rock-like break in his voice. His lowest note is G2, ten notes below middle C (C4).\n\nCantonese Albums:\n\nEnglish Albums:\n\nAlbums in Mandarin:\n\n\n\n\n(actor unless otherwise noted) \n"}

The current successor is Chris-Craft Corporation, which produces motorboats under the Chris-Craft name.\n\nChris Smith built his first wooden boat in 1874 at the age of 13. Years later, he built a duck hunting boat. His friends liked the way he built them, and they asked him to build them one. This was technically the start of the boat company. He soon began to build more boats and joined his brother Hank in 1881 to begin producing boats full-time. \n\nIn 1910, the brothers joined with other partners to form the Smith Ryan Boat Company. The firm's name was changed in 1922 to Chris Smith & Sons Boat Company, then to Chris-Craft in 1924. The Detroit-area company became well known for its sleek racing boats in the 1910s and 1920s. Chris-Craft sold high-end powerboats to wealthy patrons such as Henry Ford and William Randolph Hearst. \n\nIn the late 1920s, Chris-Craft extended its market into the middle class when it became one of the first mass-producers of civilian pleasure boats. The company began assembly line production at their plant in Algonac, Michigan, dramatically lowering production costs. Formerly, most powerboats had been hand-built. Engines were supplied by both Ford and Chrysler, and by the Hercules Engine Company in later models.\n\nIn 1927, the company introduced the \"Cadet,\" an affordable 22' runabout. At the time, the domain of speedboats was largely confined to the wealthy. Its innovative advertising campaign promised a piece of \"the good life\" to the growing American middle class. The company sold its boats on the installment plan, making them among the first powerboats available to the general population.\n\nThe Great Depression robbed many Americans of discretionary income, and Chris-Craft sales suffered. The company introduced a line of low-priced powerboats to stay solvent. By 1935, a 15.5' utility boat sold for as little as US$406. During World War II, the company produced small patrol boats and launches for the U.S. Navy.\n\nAfter the war, Chris-Craft introduced a new lineup of civilian pleasure boats in time for the massive American consumer expansion of the 1950s. That decade marked the height of company prestige, and the Chris-Craft brand name became virtually synonymous with pleasure boating. The company offered 159 different models, and it was the sales leader in many categories of small civilian powerboats.\n\nThe company sold high-end boats to famous customers such as Dean Martin, Katharine Hepburn, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley. Their boats were often made from the finest mahogany and were considered to be among the best available. They were easy to operate, a must for their \"weekend sailor\" owners. In some circles, owning a Chris-Craft was considered \"de rigueur.\" Even their lower-priced boats were considered to be of high quality, often featuring such luxurious items as a liberal use of mahogany, teak, and brass.\n\nChris-Craft manufactured its first fiberglass boat by 1955. The company added a metal boat division in 1957, designated as the Roamer Steel Boats Division (RSBD). This was founded upon its purchase of the Roamer Boat Company, and the boats became known as Chris Craft Roamers. \n\nThe company continued to be independent until it was acquired by Shields & Company's NAFI Corporation in 1960 and merged with NAFI. The merged company was renamed in 1962 as Chris-Craft Industries.\n"}

{"id": "2278553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278553", "title": "J. Bracken Lee", "text": "J. Bracken Lee\n\nJoseph Bracken Lee (January 7, 1899 – October 20, 1996) was an American political figure in the state of Utah. A Republican, he served two terms as the 9th Governor of Utah (1949–57), six 2-year terms as mayor of Price, Utah (1935–47), and three terms as the 27th mayor of Salt Lake City (1960–71).\n\nLee was the most recent of three Governors of Utah who was not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the other two being Simon Bamberger (1917–1921) and George Dern (1925–1933).\n\nLee was born in Price, to Arthur J. Lee (1870-1934) and Ida Mae (Leiter) Lee (1874–1980). When he was five, the family moved to Fruita, Colorado, where they remained until he was in the eighth grade. The family then returned to Price.\n\nDuring World War I, Lee served in the U.S. Army, lying about his age and passing up his high school graduation in order to enlist. During training in California, the Army kept him there as a trainer for the soldiers going to Europe, believing that he had the excellent people skills needed for this job. This was a decision that Lee initially regretted, as he wished to serve in combat. After the war, he joined his father in the insurance business in Price prior to going into politics.\n\nLee married Nellie Pace. Their daughter, Helen (Nelson), was born in 1922 (died 2005). Two years later Nellie became seriously ill, first with pneumonia, and then with Hodgkin's disease, of which she died in 1926. The medical expenses placed Lee in considerable debt. Until the debts were paid, Lee moved into his own garage and rented out his house. Another way he tried to save money was by eating only one hamburger and drinking a quart of milk a day. During this time, his daughter lived with Lee's parents. This experience helped form his fiscal conservatism, as he vowed he would never go into debt again.\n\nOn February 23, 1928, he married Margaret Draper (1909–1989) of Wellington, Utah. They had three children, a son, James (born 1930), a daughter, Jon (Taylor) (born 1935), and a son, Richard (1944-2012).\n\nMargaret fueled Lee's political ambition, encouraging his entry into politics and actively contributing to his career. Together, they made a formidable team. She had a remarkable memory for names, a skill helpful to Bracken in public life. Margaret was active in the Women's Literary Society. She also did historical research on prominent women in the West and gave speeches about them. Bracken and Margaret were married for 61 years, until her death in 1989.\n\nLee was an avid hunter and outdoorsman, particularly enjoying the high desert in eastern Utah near Price. He played semi-professional baseball as a young man, playing shortstop. He was also an extraordinary handyman, with skills in jewelry making and painting. He was a member of the Freemasons, Shriners, and Elks.\n\nLee died in Salt Lake City and is interred in a family plot at Mt. Olivet Cemetery in Salt Lake City. Dying at 97 years of age, he lived longer than any other Utah Governor.\n\nLee was fiscally conservative and a deep opponent of the income tax. With hefty cuts in spending, he was able to run surpluses in all of his administrations. As governor, he trimmed both spending and bureaucracy by cutting the number of departments and commissioners. He particularly angered the teachers' union for his cuts in higher education. In addition to his fierce opposition to the income tax, he opposed foreign aid and the United Nations. While Lee was the descendant of Mormons, he had no religious affiliation himself, but still enjoyed political success despite the fact that he was not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Although he did not shy from criticism of the church, he was careful to maintain good diplomacy with its leadership.\n\nFor a time Lee became involved in conservative anti-tax groups who advocated the formation of an independent third party because of the increasing liberalism of both the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nLee lost his first political campaign for mayor of Price in 1931. He returned in 1935 to win by just two votes, enjoying reelection another 5 times there. He lost two runs for governor in the 1940s before a successful bid in the fall of 1948. In 1956, he lost the Republican primary, which caused him to run a strong but unsuccessful race as an independent. He ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in both 1958 and 1962, and again for governor in 1964, though he was defeated in the Republican state convention. Under the political system at the time, if no candidate running for statewide office or House of Representatives got 80% of the delegate votes at the convention, a primary was held between the top two candidates. Lee came in third at the convention, which eliminated his candidacy.\n\nIn 1960, he was the Conservative Party's nominee for President. His Running Mate was Kent Courtney. They came in 9th place by popular vote.\n\nW. Cleon Skousen had served as Salt Lake City, Utah, police chief for four years before being fired. Salt Lake City had a weak-mayor system, with the mayor being a member of the five member commission. In 1960 Lee offered a motion to fire Skousen and the majority of the commission voted yes. This happened shortly after Skousen raided an illegal poker club, where Lee was in attendance. Lee characterized Skousen's strict enforcement of anti-gambling laws as \"like a Gestapo.\"\n\nLee's biographer, Dennis Lythgoe, regards his greatest contribution his terms as mayor of Salt Lake City, where he brought fiscal responsibility and capital improvements to the city. With age having moderated his temper somewhat, he was more effective in office while remaining true to his principles.\n\nLee's legacy as governor is sometimes disputed. While many point to his temper, opinionated personality, and battles with educators as problems, he is also generally praised for his fiscal responsibility, and for the fact that Utah enjoyed a prosperous economy during his administration. Throughout his entire tenure, the state had a surplus rather than debt. Even Lee's political opponents respected his integrity and honest, open and straightforward ways of dealing.\n\nLee was often compared to President Harry S. Truman. Though the two had differing political viewpoints and were members of opposite parties, their personalities were similar. They shared folksy manners, never shied from stating their opinions, and were bluntly honest. With the two in office at the same time from 1949–1953, it was easy for many to compare the two.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2278554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278554", "title": "Sally Potter", "text": "Sally Potter\n\nCharlotte Sally Potter (born 19 September 1949) is an English film director and screenwriter. She is known for directing \"Orlando\" (1992), which won the audience prize for Best Film at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nPotter was born and raised in London. Her mother was a music teacher and her father was an interior designer and a poet. Her younger brother Nic became the bassist for the rock group Van der Graaf Generator. When asked about her background, which influenced her work as a filmmaker, she responds, \"I came from an atheist background and an anarchist background, which meant that I grew up in an environment that was full of questions, where nothing could be taken for granted.\"\n\nWhen asked about what she learned about filmmaking from trying to do it as a seventeen-year-old woman in the UK in the 60s, Potter laughs.You know, most kinds of securities are illusions, and we need to kind of duck and weave as filmmakers, go with the flow, go where the harvest is. [...] I knew very early on, if I waited for somebody to give me money to do something, I’d never do anything.\n\nPotter began making amateur films, at age 14, with an 8mm camera given to her by an uncle. She eventually dropped out of school at age 16 to pursue filmmaking. From 1968–1970 she worked as a kitchen worker and a picture researcher for BBC in order to support herself and her work. She had joined the London Film-Makers' Co-op and began making experimental short films, including \"Jerk\" (1969) and \"Play\" (1970). She later trained as a dancer and choreographer at the London School of Contemporary Dance. She made both film and dance pieces, including \"Combines\" (1972), before founding Limited Dance Company with Jacky Lansley.\n\nPotter became an award-winning performance artist and theatre director, with shows including \"Mounting\", \"Death and the Maiden\" and \"Berlin\". In addition, she was a member of several music bands (including Feminist Improvising Group and The Film Music Orchestra) working as a lyricist and singer. She collaborated (as a singer-songwriter) with composer Lindsay Cooper on the song cycle \"Oh Moscow,\" which was performed throughout Europe, Russia and North America in the late 1980s and commercially released.\n\nPotter continued as a composer when she collaborated with David Motion on the soundtrack to \"Orlando.\" She wrote the score for the film, \"The Tango Lesson,\" for which she sang \"I am You\" in the final scene. Her most recent music work is as producer and co-composer with Fred Frith of the original tracks for \"Yes\" and \"Rage\".\n\nReferring to her career as a choreographer, Potter said, \"Choreography was the perfect 'poor theatre.' All you needed were willing bodies and some space. So it was as a choreographer that I learnt how to direct and it was as a dancer that I learnt how to work.\"\n\nPotter returned to filmmaking with her short film \"Thriller\" (1979), which was a hit on the international festival circuit. This was followed by her first feature film, \"The Gold Diggers\" (1983), starring Julie Christie. She directed another short film, \"The London Story\" (1986); a documentary series for Channel 4, \"Tears\", \"Laughter\", \"Fear and Rage\" (1986); and \"I am an Ox\", \"I am a Horse\", \"I am a Man\", \"I am a Woman\" (1988), a film about women in Soviet cinema.\n\nAs director of the internationally distributed \"Orlando\" (1992), Potter received greater appreciation for her writing and direction. Starring Tilda Swinton, the film was based on Virginia Woolf's and adapted for the screen by Potter. In addition to two Academy Award nominations, \"Orlando\" won more than 25 international awards, including the Felix, awarded by the European Film Academy for the best Young European Film of 1993; and first prizes at St Petersburg, Thessaloniki and other European festivals.\n\nThe novel had previously been considered impossible to adapt for the screen, because it took place over 400 years and followed a character whose sex changes from a man to a woman. Funding the feature proved difficult, and \"Orlando\" took seven years to complete. Filming and editing took 20 weeks. Preparation for the film, including adapting the novel, funding the film, scouting locations, etc., took four years.\n\nWhen asked whether she thought she would continue to work on feminist themes, Potter replied:\nI have come to the conclusion that I can't use that term in my work. Not because of a disavowal of the underlying principles that gave birth to that word – the commitment to liberation, dignity, equality. But it has become a trigger word that stops people's thinking. You literally see people's eyes glaze over with exhaustion when the word flashes into the conversation.\n\nShe next directed the film, \"The Tango Lesson\" (1996), in which she also performed with renowned dancer Pablo Veron. First presented at the Venice Film Festival, the film was awarded the \"Ombú de Oro\" for Best Film at the Mar del Plata Film Festival, Argentina; the SADAIC Great Award from the Sociedad Argentina de Autores y Compositores de Música; as well as receiving Best Film nominations from BAFTA and the US National Board of Review. \"The Tango Lesson\" is semi-autobiographical, based on Potter's experiences learning Argentinian Tango with Veron while writing the screenplay for \"Rage.\"\n\n\"The Tango Lesson\" marks Potter's first time performing on screen. Regarding this decision she stated, \"I knew that I had to perform in this one because the impetus for the film came out of my own desire to dance.\" Potter's professional collaborations with Pablo Veron continue in \"The Man Who Cried\" and the stage production of \"Carmen\" (2007).\n\nSince \"The Tango Lesson\"'s release, Potter continued to receive letters from viewers who felt touched by it. In a 2005 interview with Jan Lisa Huttner, Potter suggests, \"I think maybe I’m not the best person to analyze it, but what people pick up on is the passion behind the film: the passion to make the film itself, the passion to dance again. At the age of 46 I put myself in a movie, dancing the Tango with the best tango dancer in the world. [...] It was so terrifying, and so driven by passion at the same time, maybe that’s partly what people respond to.”\n\n\"The Man Who Cried\" (starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Cate Blanchett and John Turturro), premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2000. Ricci plays a Jewish girl who, separated from her father when she was young in Soviet Russia, travels to America to find him.\n\nIt was followed by \"Yes\" (2004), with Joan Allen, Simon Abkarian and Sam Neill. \"Yes\" was written in response to the attacks in the United States of 11 September 2001; it is considered Potter's return to more experimental methods of filmmaking. The screenplay is written in verse and the film's budget was much smaller than that for \"The Man Who Cried\". Regarding the film's budget and stylistic approaches, Potter said:\n\nOriginally I was trying to figure out how we could shoot this film without any lights, because there didn't seem to be enough money in the budget to have any. One solution was to shoot at six frames a second, or even three. Later you print each frame four (or eight) times to bring it into sync at twenty-four frames per second. You can shoot almost in the dark, and still see people's faces ... we did some tests and found that it was very beautiful; so I decided to make it part of the language of the film.\n\nIn 2007 Potter directed Georges Bizet's \"Carmen\" for English National Opera at the London Coliseum, starring Alice Coote and designed by Es Devlin.\n\n\"Rage\" (2009) was the first feature ever to premiere on cell-phones. The cast includes Judi Dench, Steve Buscemi, Lily Cole and Jude Law. \"Rage\" was in competition at the Berlin Film Festival in 2009 and nominated for a WEBBY for Best Drama in 2010.\n\nPotter's seventh feature film entitled \"Ginger & Rosa\" was written and directed by Potter and produced by Christoper Sheppard and Andrew Lityin. The film starred Elle Fanning and Alice Englert as the title characters and received its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival. The film went into limited release in the UK in 2012 before enjoying a limited run in North America in early 2013.\n\nIn 2017, Potter's black comedy \"The Party\" was released. It was selected to compete for the Golden Bear in the main competition section of the 67th Berlin International Film Festival and was awarded the Guild Film Prize. The film features a star-studded ensemble cast with Patricia Clarkson, Bruno Ganz, Emily Mortimer, Cherry Jones, Cillian Murphy, Kristin Scott Thomas and Timothy Spall.\n\nIn 2020, Potter's drama \"The Roads Not Taken\" was released after a world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Golden Bear. It follows Molly (Elle Fanning) caring for her father, Leo (Javier Bardem), who suffers from early-onset dementia. In an interview at Berlinale, Potter described the research process involved in providing an accurate and sensitive portrayal of Leo's illness:Although my brother had a variant of it and I had already done a lot of research into it, I consulted a neurologist to make sure that everything was clinically correct.Javier Bardem also did his own research and visited a clinic for people with that particular variant of dementia. And he discovered what I knew, that it can take so many different forms and pathways. Most people think dementia is Alzheimer’s, but Alzheimer’s is just one variation of dementia.\n\n\n\nDocumentaries\n\n\n\n"}

The film stars Kristanna Loken, Michael Madsen, Matthew Davis, Will Sanderson, Billy Zane, Udo Kier, Michael Paré, Meat Loaf, Michelle Rodriguez, Ben Kingsley, and Geraldine Chaplin. The screenplay by Guinevere Turner is based on the video game of the same name from Majesco Entertainment and the game developer, Terminal Reality.\n\nThe third video game film adaptation by Boll, who previously made the films based on \"House of the Dead\" and \"Alone in the Dark\", \"BloodRayne\" received extremely negative reviews upon release and was a box office bomb, grossing only $3.7 million from a $25 million budget.\n\nRayne is an unholy breed of human and vampire known as a dhampir. Dhampir are unaffected by crucifixes and do not thirst for human blood, but maintain a vampire weakness to holy water. She is the daughter of the Vampire King, Kagan, who has gathered an army of thralls, both vampire and human, in order to annihilate the human race. She was conceived when Kagan raped her mother, and she later witnessed him killing her when she rejected his advances.\n\nSebastian, Vladimir, and Katarin are three members of the Brimstone Society, a group of warriors sworn to fight vampires. They hear of a carnival freak who may be a dhampir, so Vladimir plans to recruit her in order to kill Kagan. Kagan is also hunting for her, fearing she will interfere with his plans. Rayne escapes captivity at the carnival when her keeper tries to rape her. On the road, she encounters and saves a family being attacked by vampires. A fortune teller reveals to Rayne that Kagan has become the most powerful vampire in the land and resides in a well-protected castle. She tells Rayne that Kagan seeks an ancient talisman, a mystical eye, and if she finds it, it would allow her to gain an audience with him. Rayne sets out to the monastery where it is hidden to find it.\n\nRayne shelters for the night at the monastery and later sneaks away to where the talisman is guarded by a hammer-wielding, deformed monk, who she kills. The talisman is further protected by booby traps, and when Rayne lifts it from its pedestal, the chamber floods with holy water. As Rayne hangs from the ceiling to avoid the water, the talisman falls from the box but she catches the eyeball. Examining it closely, the eye magically becomes absorbed into her own eye, and when she falls into the water she is somehow unaffected by it.\n\nWhen she leaves the chamber, the monks explain the artifact is one of three body parts which came from an ancient vampire called Belial, who had found a way to overcome the weaknesses of a vampire. The eye overcomes holy water, the rib overcomes the cross, and the heart overcomes sunlight. When Belial died, the parts of his body were hidden across the land. As Kagan desires all these parts in order to assume Belial's powers, it becomes the heroes' mission to stop him.\n\nRayne is brought to the headquarters of the Brimstone Society and they agree to work together to kill Kagan. Katarin does not trust Rayne and betrays Brimstone to her father, Elrich, who has fallen in league with Kagan, but seeks to betray him and gain power for himself. The location of the heart talisman is known to Katarin as her grandfather hid it in water-filled caves. She seeks it out but Rayne kills her and takes it. With the talisman, Rayne attempts to gain an audience before Kagan, but he takes the heart and throws her in the dungeon. He plans to extract the eye as part of a ritual. He realizes too late that Rayne had only given him an empty box and not the heart.\n\nSebastian and Vladimir intervene, battling Kagan and his minions, but both are fatally wounded, leaving Rayne in a final battle against Kagan. As Sebastian dies he fires a final bolt from his crossbow, but Kagan is too quick and is able to catch it. Rayne is able to summon her last reserves of strength and plunge the bolt into his heart. The battle ends, and Sebastian chooses to die rather than let Rayne save him. Rayne seats herself in Kagan's throne, and reflects on the events that led to her father's death. Rayne then leaves the castle and rides off into the mountains.\n\nScreenwriter Guinevere Turner turned in the first draft two weeks late. Rather than asking for redrafts Boll accepted it and then made many of his own changes; and he then asked the actors to \"take a crack at it\". Turner estimated only 20% of her script was actually filmed.\nFilming took place in Romania, in the Carpathian Mountains. Filming also took place in a castle where Prince Vlad the Impaler presumably spent a night once.\n\nOn January 6, 2006, the film opened in 985 theaters across the United States. It was originally to have played at up to 2,500 theaters, but that number dropped to 1,600 and ended up lower due to prints being shipped to theaters that had not licensed the film.\n\nBilly Zane was involved with distributor Romar Entertainment and Uwe Boll later sued him for revenue owed.\n\nIn its opening, the film only made US$1,550,000.\nThe film ended up grossing US$3,591,980 (June 2006) against a production budget of US$25 million.\n\n\"BloodRayne\" was critically panned. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 4% approval rating based on 53 reviews, with an average rating of 2.27/10. The site's consensus reads: \"BloodRayne is an absurd sword-and-sorcery vid-game adaptation from schlock-maestro Uwe Boll, featuring a distinguished (and slumming) cast.\" It was ranked 48th in Rotten Tomatoes's 100 worst reviewed films of the 2000s. On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 18% based on 13 reviews, summarizing the reviews as \"overwhelming dislike\".\n\nJoe Leydon of Variety said the that the film \"lurches from incident to incident at a graceless plodding place, offering little in the way of genuine excitement -- the swordfights often are confusingly cut and choreographed -- and only minimal amounts of guilty-pleasure titillation.\" \nMaitland McDonagh of TV Guide wrote: \"Though indisputably the best of Uwe Boll's first three video-game-into-film adaptations, this gory, ludicrous horror-action picture isn't good by any standard.\"\nCritics ridiculed Boll for hiring actual prostitutes instead of actors for a scene featuring Meat Loaf in order to save on production costs.\n\nSome critics were more forgiving of the film. Berge Garabedian of JoBlo's movie reviews described as the film as \"actually pretty decent…for what it is\" namely a video game adaptation, with a hot lead actress in the form of Kristanna Loken, and number of surprisingly fun and bloody action sequences. He acknowledges the dialog is poor and the story lame but says the film is \"not as bad as you’d suspect\" and an adequate bloody low-budget vampire film.\nSteve Chupnick of the \"Latino Review\" gave the film a B rating, saying that although it was not a good film it was far from the worst he's seen and mentioned the Kristanna Loken nude scene as something in the films favor.\n\nActor Michael Madsen called \"BloodRayne\" \"an abomination... a horrifying and preposterous movie\", but added that he enjoyed working with Boll and would certainly work with him again if asked. \nLaura Bailey, who was the voice of Rayne in the \"BloodRayne\" games, was asked at her panel at Anime Boston 2007 what her thoughts were on the film adaptation, and said \"Oh God, that movie sucked. And that movie was so bad. I saw it on The Movie Channel and I couldn't even get through 20 minutes of it! It was so bad and it was kinda sad that they took that because I really liked the games.\" \nGuinevere Turner who wrote the draft screenplay, found the film laughable and suggested that was \"worst movie ever made\" but that it was so camp it might ripen with age.\n\nThe film was nominated for six Golden Raspberry Awards including, Worst Picture, Worst Actress (Kristanna Loken), Worst Supporting Actor (Ben Kingsley), Worst Supporting Actress (Michelle Rodriguez), Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay. \"Bloodrayne\" did not win any, having been dominated by \"Basic Instinct 2\" and \"Little Man\" with seven nominations each.\n\nAt the 2006 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, it received nine nominations, trailing behind \"Zoom\"'s ten, with four wins: Worst Picture, Worst Director (Boll), Worst Ensemble, and Least \"Special\" Special Effects. Its other nominations were for Worst Supporting Actor (Meatloaf Aday), Worst Supporting Actress (Rodriguez), Worst Screenplay, Most Annoying Fake Female Fake Accent (Rodriguez), and Least Scary Horror Movie.\n\nIn 2009, \"Time\" listed the film #6 on their list of top ten worst video games movies.\n\nThe film was number one on GameTrailers countdown of the worst video game movies ever. The reviewers from GameTrailers said that \"every actor is miscast, every wig is too fake, every sex scene is too inappropriate, and every action scene is too improvised.\"\n\nIn 2007, a sequel \"\" was made. Natassia Malthe replaced Loken in the lead role. Due to the poor box office of the first film, \"BloodRayne 2: Deliverance\" went direct-to-video instead. A third film, \"\" was released in 2011. Malthe reprised her role as Rayne. Both sequels were directed by Uwe Boll. Michael Paré appeared in all three films, but as different characters: Iancu, Pat Garrett, and Commandant Ekart Brand, respectively.\n\nBefore the DVD of this film was released, Boll removed the Romar name and logo from the credits and packaging of this film. As a result, Romar ceased distributing the film. Next to the R-rated version which was shown in cinemas, a more violent unrated director's cut which includes an extended ending was released on DVD. The director's cut DVD box set included a full copy of the \"BloodRayne 2\" video game on the second DVD.\n\n"}

His mother's family originally came from Vienna, Austria, where his great-grandfather Alfred Roth had been a colonel in the Austro-Hungarian cavalry, the highest rank accessible to a Jew in the Habsburg Imperial army.\n\nAfter hearing Pee Wee Russell the first time, he was convinced that he wanted to be a jazz musician, too; and at the age of 16 he joined the musician's union, first as a baritone saxophone player. In 1954 he joined Jack Teagarden's Band, and after only a few days with the band he made his first jazz recordings. Later on, he worked with bands led by Phil Napoleon and Pee Wee Erwin before joining the Dukes of Dixieland in 1962. The late 1960s found him free-lancing with, among others, Red Allen, Ralph Sutton, Yank Lawson and his lifelong friend Dick Wellstood.\n\nAt this time, he had also taken up the soprano saxophone, and when a spontaneous coupling with fellow reedman Bob Wilber at Dick Gibson's Colorado Jazz Party turned out be a huge success, one of the most important jazz groups of the 1970s, Soprano Summit, was born. Co-led by Wilber and Davern, both switching between the clarinet and various saxophones, during the next five years Soprano Summit enjoyed a very successful string of record dates and concerts. When the group disbanded in 1979, Davern devoted himself to solely playing clarinet, preferring trio formats with piano and drums. His collaboration with Bob Wilber was revived in 1991, the new group being called Summit Reunion. Leading his own quartets since the 1990s, Davern preferred the guitar to the piano in his rhythm section, employing guitarists Bucky Pizzarelli, Howard Alden and James Chirillo. He also made several appearances to the Colorado Springs Invitational Jazz Party and performed with numerous international jazz musicians.\n\nIn 1997, he was inducted into the Jazz Hall of Fame at Rutgers University, and in 2001 he received an honorary doctorate of music at Hamilton College, Clinton, New York. In addition to the jazz greats that inspired him, Kenny Davern indicated classical clarinetist David Weber, principal solo clarinetist with the New York City Ballet Orchestra, as his most important teacher.\n\nAlthough playing mainly in traditional jazz and swing settings, his musical interests encompass a much broader range of styles. In 1978 he collaborated with avantgarde players Steve Lacy, Steve Swallow and Paul Motian on a free jazz-inspired album appropriately entitled \"Unexpected\". In addition to his accomplishments in jazz, his ardour and knowledge of classical music was encyclopaedic, particularly of the work of conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler.\n\nEspecially after concentrating exclusively on playing the clarinet, Kenny Davern called his own an unmatched mastery of the instrument. A full, rounded tone, especially \"woody\" in the lower chalumeau register, combined with highly personal tone inflections and the ability to hit notes far above the conventional range of the clarinet, made his sound immediately recognizable. In the late 1980s, \"The New York Times\" hailed him as \"the finest jazz clarinetist playing today\". \n\nDavern died of a heart attack at his Sandia Park, New Mexico home.\n\nWith Dick Wellstood\n\nWith George Shearing\n\n"}

Valiant Entertainment, Inc. is the owner of the Valiant catalog (including Eternal Warrior). the character was created Jim Shooter and Don Perlin\n\nThe series was originally written by Jim Shooter with art by John Dixon. Later writers included Kevin VanHook, Barry Windsor-Smith, Mark Moretti, and John Ostrander.\n\nMonths following Valiant Entertainment's successful relaunch a new Eternal Warrior series titled \"Wrath of the Eternal Warrior\" was teased at the Baltimore Comic- Con in September 2012. An Eternal Warrior series debuted in September 2013 by writer Greg Pak and artist Trevor Hairsine.\n\nGranted the gift of immortality, Gilad Anni-Padda is a master tactician and one of the greatest warriors on the planet. When in danger Earth calls for her Eternal Warrior to prevent calamities and mete out justice. For countless centuries, these messages have been relayed to Gilad by the Geomancers, an unbroken line of mystics in tune with the voice of the planet. The geomancer of a given era and Gilad work together to do the bidding of the Earth.\n\nThe Eternal Warrior's journey began millennia ago in the ancient city-state of Ur when Gilad, then a flesh-and-blood-mortal, was killed during an adventure in the mythical land of the Faraway with his brothers Aram and Ivar.\n\nAs grief curdled Ivar's mind, Gilad's brother convinced himself that a mysterious machine captured in the Faraway could restore his brother to life. However, when activated, this device-known as \"the Boon\"-annihilated ancient Ur, draining the life force from thousands and ruining the city.\n\nBy 6000 B.C., Gilad had fully matured and begun his service as the Eternal Warrior-the Fist and Steel of the Earth. Locked in battle with the forces of Nergal, a death god opposed by the earth, Gilad lost his son Mitu at the hands of his own daughter, Xaran. In the wake of his loss, Gilad continued to fight for the Earth, but with grave misgivings. Eventually after centuries of doubt, Gilad abdicated his post as Earth's defender, electing instead to deliver justice on his own terms. It was only when Xaran, long thought dead, returned that Gilad was called back into service of the Earth-a call he rejected by destroying the House of Earth's California headquarters. However, he soon learned that his attack had unintended consequences. . . and that he will have no choice but to return to the Earth's service if the world is to stand any chance against the return of Nergal in two thousand years time . . .\n\nAfter teaming with his long estranged brother Armstrong to stop the nihilistic cult called the Null, Gilad then traveled to Romania, seeking to change the dangerous course being set by his old friend from centuries ago, Aric of Dacia-better known as X-O Manowar. Failing to convince Aric that his occupation of Romania would only lead to suffering for his people, Gilad reluctantly joined forces with Toyo Harada and the superhuman strike force called Unity to disarm X-O Manowar by any means necessary.\n\nMeanwhile, however, the threat of Nergal continued to grow for nearly two thousand years. In the distant future of 4001 A.D., Gilad-now known as the Eternal Emperor-stands guard over a small agricultural village situated atop the ruins of Little Rock, Arkansas. Struggling to keep his charges alive-and his young granddaughter Caroline along with them- the peace of his small kingdom is shattered when a centuries-old weapon explodes, saturating the area with radioactivity.\n\nGilad is forced to set out into the wider world to find a cure, but it soon confronted with the grim reality of what the world has become in the 41st century. Gilad and his grand-daughter eventually forge an uneasy alliance with the weaponsmiths responsible for damaging his village. They unite to destroy a death cult. Gilad returns with a cure for the radioactivity and saves the lives of most of his people. However he is saddened when he sees that Coroline has developed an interest and skill in making machines, as the ancient Gilad realizes that her interest will only lead to future generations making the same mistakes as the last.\n\nOne of three natural human immortals, Gilad is the brother of Ivar the Timewalker and Aram the Other (AKA Armstrong). The three brothers are the only naturally immortal humans known to exist. He serves as the \"Fist and Steel\" of the Geomancers and has served them for millennia. Like his brothers, Gilad has superhuman strength (though not as great as Aram's) and stamina, as well as a healing ability which allows him to regenerate tissue damaged by virtually any wound. Gilad's people once said that he carried within him the \"Leopard Spirit.\"\n\nBravest of a warrior tribe, Gilad Anni-Padda was born in 3268 BC. His skill at battlecraft and the arts of stealth are great, as he has honed them throughout the ages. With an ultra-dense cellular structure that gives him great strength and the ability to heal from the most grievous of wounds, Gilad Anni-Padda is even immune to the ravages of time. The greatest fighter from an age when the sword was the law, he was ancient before the rise of the Pharaohs, and shall survive the fall of nations yet to come. He is the Fist and Steel of those who guard the Earth - the Geomancers, and his battle is never-ending.\n\nIn 3257 BC, at the age of eleven, Gilad emerged victorious from his first battle. In 3250, Gilad's first son, Kalam, was born. In 3219 BC, Gilad and Aram's tribe battled the superior weaponry of the Mesopotamians and lost, with the warriors of Mesopotamia advancing to Gilad's camp. All of the people were killed with the exception of Gilad, Aram, and Kalam. The brothers split up, Gilad traveling with the Geomancer of the day and Aram seeking a new family and a less violent life. Centuries passed and the brothers saw each other on occasion but have largely led separate lives.\n\nIn 210 BC, Gilad first battled the Immortal Enemy, then known as General Cheng, who can reincarnate through the ages, always doing evil and seeking Gilad's destruction. Every time the Immortal Enemy reincarnates his eyes remain the same, one green and the other brown.\n\nIn World War II, Gilad meets Neville Alcott at the Battle of Dunkirk in 1940. Alcott would later serve to aid the Eternal Warrior's causes.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Gilad (now known as Gilad Abrams) fought the Immortal Enemy's latest incarnation, a Colombian drug lord Juan Javier Caldone. Gilad has also incurred the enmity of Master Darque - necromancer supreme.\n\nDuring the Unity crisis it is seen that Gilad will still be active in 4000 A.D., battling alongside Magnus, Robot Fighter. Magnus fights to protect his society threats arising from free-will robots.\n\nLike his siblings, Ivar and Aram, Gilad's dense molecular structure not only renders him immortal, but also grants him super-strength, some invulnerability, and a regenerative healing process. His millennia of life has also made him a master of all known combat and weaponry.\n\nEternal Warrior appears in the web series \"Ninjak vs. the Valiant Universe\" portrayed by John Morrison.\n\nIn August 2017, Dave Bautista is in talks to play the Eternal Warrior in a solo movie.\n\n"}
{"id": "2278611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278611", "title": "Fibril", "text": "Fibril\n\nFibrils (from the Latin \"fibra\") are structural biological materials found in nearly all living organisms. Not to be confused with fibers or filaments, fibrils tend to have diameters ranging from 10-100 nanometers (whereas fibers are micro to milli-scale structures and filaments have diameters approximately 10-50 nanometers in size). Fibrils are not usually found alone but rather are parts of greater hierarchical structures commonly found in biological systems. Due to the prevalence of fibrils in biological systems, their study is of great importance in the fields of microbiology, biomechanics, and materials science.\n\nFibrils are composed of linear biopolymers, and are characterized by rod-like structures with high length-to-diameter ratios. Oftentimes, they spontaneously arrange into helical structures. In biomechanics problems, fibrils can be characterized as classical beams with a roughly circular cross-sectional area on the nanometer scale. As such, simple beam bending equations can be applied to calculate flexural strength of fibrils under ultra-low loading conditions. Like most biopolymers, stress-strain relationships of fibrils tend to show a characteristic toe-heel region before a linear, elastic region. Unlike biopolymers, fibrils do not behave like homogeneous materials, as yield strength has been shown to vary with volume, indicating structural dependencies.\n\nDifferences in structure between fibrils of different origin is typically determined by x-ray diffraction. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) can be used to observe specific details on larger fibril species such as the characteristic 67 nm bands in collagen, but often is not fine enough to determine the full structure.\n\nHydration has been shown to produce a noticeable effect in the mechanical properties of fibrillar materials. The presence of water has been shown to decrease the stiffness of collagen fibrils, as well as increase their rate of stress relaxation and strength. From a biological standpoint, water content acts as a toughening mechanism for fibril structures, allowing for higher energy absorption and greater straining capabilities.\n\nFibrillogenesis is the expansion of fine fibrils which is common in collagen fibers of connective tissue. The definite mechanisms of fibrillogenesis are still unknown, although many hypotheses resulting from basic research help discover many possible mechanisms. In early experiments, collagen I could be distilled from tissues and recombined into fibrils with controlling the solutions. Later studies help understand the composition and structure of binding sites on the collagen monomers. Collagen is synthesized as a soluble precursor, procollagen, which supports collagen self-assembly. Since collagen fibrils have almost 50 binding components in vivo, the definite requirement to generate fibrillogenesis in vivo is still cryptic.\n\nWith acidic or saline solution, collagen can be extracted from tissues and rearrange into fibril by changing temperature or pH value. Experiments discovered attractive force between collagen monomers which helps the rearrangement. Collagen serves as a precursor, procollagen, in synthesizing reaction, which identifies self-polymerization of collagen.\n\nThere are over 30 collagens in nature that are similar in chemical composition but differ in terms of crystal structure. By far, collagen I and II are the most abundant. They initiatively form fibrils in vitro, while fibronectin, fibronectin-binding, collagen-binding integrins and collagen V are essential for collagen I forming and collagen XI for collagen II forming. Therefore, cellular mechanisms play key role in the protein self-assembly process.\n\nCollagen is the major structural protein outside cells in many connective tissues of animals. As the primary component of connective tissue, it has the largest amount among protein in mammals, occupying 25% to 35% of all protein content in the body.\n\nThe fibrils in collagen are packed in a crimp structure. The stress/strain curve of collagen, such as tendon, can be subdivided into several regions. The region of small strains,\"toe\"region, corresponds to the removal of a macroscopic crimp, uncrimping,  in the collagen fibrils, visible in light microscope. At larger strains, \"heel\" and \"linear\" region, there's no further structural change visible.\n\nTropocollagen is the molecular component fiber, consisting of three left handed polypeptide chains (red, green, blue) coiled around each other, forming a right-handed triple helix.\n\nMuscles contract and stretch via the steerable sliding/grasping of the myosin interacting with actin fibers. Actin consists of two polypeptides in a helix and myosin has a small heart-shaped structure, cross-bridge. The bind and unbind processes of cross-bridge attaching on actin filament help relative movement of these collagens and hence the whole muscle.\n\nElastin is a fibrous protein common in various soft tissues, like skin, blood vessels and lung tissue. Each monomer connects with each other, forming a 3D network, with ability to endure over 200% strain before deformation.\n\nKeratin is a structural protein mainly found in hair, nails, hooves, horns, quills. Basically keratin is formed by polypeptide chains, which coil into α-helices with sulfur cross-links or bond into β-sheets linked by hydrogen bonding. β-keratin, which is tougher than α-conformation, is more common in birds and reptiles.\n\nResilin is an elastomeric insect protein, consisting of both α-helices and β-sheets structure. It is one of the most resilient protein in nature. It has a low stiffness ~0.6MPa but a high energy restoring percentage ~98%, and efficiently helps flying insects to flap wings or fleas to jump.\n\nSpider silk fibril is composed of stiff crystallized β-sheets structure, responsible for strength, and amorphous matrix surrounding, improving toughness and elongation ability. It has exceptionally high tensile strength and ductility, with respectively low density, compared to other natural fibril. Its feature varies from different kinds of spider for different utility.\n\nThe primary cell wall derives its notable tensile strength from cellulose molecules, or long-chains of glucose residues stabilized by hydrogen bonding. Cellulose chains are observed to align in overlapping parallel arrays, with the similar polarity forming a cellulose microfibril. In plants, these cellulose microfibrils arrange themselves into layers, formally known as lamellae, and are stabilized in the cell wall by surface, long cross-linking glycan molecules. Glycan molecules increase the complexity of the potential networks plant-based cellulose can configure itself into. Coextensive in the primary cell wall to both cellulose microfibrils and complementary glycan networks, is pectin which is a polysaccharide that contains many negatively charged galacturonic acid units.\nAdditionally, cellulose microfibrils also contribute to the shape of the plant via controlled-cell expansion. The stereoscopic arrangement of microfibrils in the cell wall create systems of turgor pressure which ultimately leads to cellular growth and expansion. Cellulose microfibrils are unique matrix macromolecules, in that they are assembled by cellulose synthase enzymes located on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane. It is believed that the plant can “anticipate their future morphology by controlling the orientation of microfibrils” by a mechanism where cellulose microfibrils are arranged atop a cortical array of microtubules.\n\nStirring of a given sample of amylose is said to form fibrillar crystals which are said to precipitate out of the mother liquor. These long fibrils can be imaged using electron microscopy revealing transverse striations resembling a shish-kebab. Amylose fibrils are categorized with having one of two morphologies: ones with small rodlike fibrils and others with lath-shaped crystals.\n\nThe fibrillar structure of wood is said to play a significant role in both the mechanical stability and ability of wood to possess channels to transport minerals and water. Sprucewood (Picea abies), among others, are reported to possess cellulose fibrils with a normalized diameter of 2.5 nm. There is also a reported link between the age of the wood and the spiral angle of the fibrils with respect to the longitudinal direction. Earlywood is said to have a consistent 4.6 ± 0.6° rest angle, whereas latewood is said to have a transition region from 4.6° to 19.8 ± 0.7°. In latewood, the two spiral angle regions of cellulose fibrils are not continuous, meaning that there are two independent tracheid structures in “older” trees meeting different mechanical requirements. Moreover, longitudinally oriented fibrils improve tensile strength, whereas the addition of 20° tilted fibrils, exclusive to latewood tracheids, provides stability against compression.\n\nIn order to mimic the strong adhesion, easy detachment, and self-cleaning properties of a gecko toe pad, a fibrillar-based adhesive can be created. These performance features stem from the underlying hierarchical structure which consists of a million microfibrils called setae which further consists of billions of nano-sized branches called spatulae.\n\nMimicking this phenomenon involves four distinct design steps: \n\nIn order to mimic a mature bone matrix, self-assembled fibrils can be used to align a given mineral matrix. This is accomplished using a self-assembling molecule with a hydrophobic alkyl tail and a hydrophilic oligopeptide head. These molecules form micellar structures in situ, and disulfide bridges at low pH, leading to the formation and crystallization of 200 kDa polymeric nanofibrils. The mineral matrix ultimately interacts with the synthetic fibril via a phosphoserine residue which results in mineral nucleation and growth.\n\n"}

One of his seven siblings was the wealthy financier Otto Kahn whose son Roger Wolfe Kahn was a successful jazz musician, composer and aviator. His parents belonged to a distinguished family of bankers and merchants. In 1882, Kahn entered the Königlichen Hochschule für Musik in Berlin, where he studied for the next three years. Between 1885 and 1886, he continued his musical education under the tutelage of Josef Rheinberger in Munich. On a visit to Vienna the following year, Kahn met and befriended composer Johannes Brahms, who offered to make Kahn his pupil. Although Kahn declined the invitation out of diffidence, Brahms's music would exert a profound influence on his compositional style throughout his career.\n\nAfter finishing his military service, Kahn worked as a freelance composer in Berlin until 1890. For the next three years he was employed as a Korrepetitor (rehearsal pianist) at the Stadttheater in Leipzig. Having been appointed lecturer in composition at his alma mater in 1894, Kahn was responsible for the training of some of the leading musical luminaries of 20th century classical music. Among his famous students were pianists Arthur Rubinstein and Wilhelm Kempff, the conductor Ferdinand Leitner, the composers Nikos Skalkottas and Günter Raphael, as well as the violinist Karl Klinger.\n\nWhile Kahn was composing and teaching in Berlin he also was active as chamber musician and \"Lied\" accompanist in concert with leading soloists and singers of his time, ranging from Joseph Joachim and Richard Mühlfeld to Adolf Busch, from Johann Messchaert to Ilona Durigo and Emmy Destinn.\n\nIn 1916, Kahn was elected to the Prussian Academy of Arts, a membership he held until 1934 when the Nazi regime ordered him to resign because he was a Jew. The Nazis also prohibited the publication and performance of his music. This drove him to leave Germany for England in 1938, where he spent the last years of his life in relative obscurity but inextinguishable creative power, which resulted in a voluminous collection of piano music with more than 1,000 still unpublished pieces. He died in Biddenden, Kent. Kahn and his music were almost entirely forgotten after World War II, but are slowly being rediscovered by musicians and audiences, as is the case of many other composers of \"degenerate music\" persecuted by the Nazis.\n\nKahn composed prolifically for the chamber repertoire, writing in an intimate, lyrical style that is reminiscent of Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, and Johannes Brahms. Like his friend Brahms, Kahn eschewed the emotional extravagance of the late Romantics. His output included 2 piano quintets (besides the Quintet in C minor op.54 there is a Quintet in D Major from 1926), 2 string quartets, 3 piano quartets, 4 piano trios, 3 violin sonatas, 2 cello sonatas, several choral pieces, and numerous lieder. His only purely instrumental orchestral works were a serenade \"Aus der Jugendzeit\" (\"From Youth\") (1890) and a Konzertstück for piano and orchestra in E-flat minor, Op. 74 (1920).\n\nKahn was often commissioned to create works for some of the finest musicians of the early decades of the 20th century up to the young Adolf Busch with whom Kahn gave the first performance of his Suite op.69 for Violin and Piano. His first Violin Sonata in G minor was dedicated to Joseph Joachim who asked to perform it when Kahn was still a young student in Berlin, and even Clara Schumann mentioned this Sonata in her diary. The second Violin Sonata, in A minor, Op. 26 (1897) was dedicated to Joachim, while the String Quartet No. 1 in A major, Op. 8 (1889) was first performed by the Joachim Quartet. The second string quartet was premièred by the Klingler Quartet, the successor of the Joachim Quartet. Finally his clarinet trio op.45 was dedicated to and performed by the famous clarinetist Richard Mühlfeld who also inspired Brahms's late chamber compositions. Hans von Bülow conducted the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in the world première of Kahn's orchestral serenade.\n\n\n"}

Built on 1,850 dunams of land expropriated in 1991, it is considered an illegal Israeli settlement by much of the world, although Israel disputes this. The settlement is also referred to as Jabal Abu Ghneim, which is the Arabic name of the hill. One purpose given for the decision approving of its establishment was to obstruct the growth of the nearby Palestinian city of Bethlehem.\n\nHar Homa has secular, traditional, and Modern Orthodox Jewish populations.\n\nThe neighborhood was officially renamed \"Homat Shmuel\" in 1998 after Shmuel Meir, a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, who played an active role in its development before he was killed in a car accident in 1996.\n\nIn 2013, Har Homa had a population of 25,000.\n\nThe international community considers Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.\n\nIn the 1940s, a Jewish group purchased 130 dunams (13 ha or 32 acres) of land on the hill between Jerusalem and Bethlehem known in Arabic as \"Jabal Abu Ghneim\" (, translit).\n\nDuring the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the hill was a base for the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, a position taken over by Transjordan's Arab Legion. The Hebrew name \"Har Homa\", lit. \"Hill (of the) Wall\", refers to a wall built on the remains of a Byzantine church on the mountain which was visible to Palmach forces stationed at kibbutz Ramat Rachel. Following the war, the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property planted a small forest of non-native pine trees there to prevent misuse of the land by local Jordanian residents. After 1967, the forest was maintained by the Jewish National Fund until many of the trees were removed when the housing construction began in the late 1990s.\n\nPlans for residential development were drawn up in the 1980s, but were opposed by Israeli environmental groups working to preserve the open areas in Jerusalem. A primary aim was to complete the continuous Jewish encirclement in East Jerusalem by stopping a perceived 'hole' in this area, and thus hinder Palestinian development that would create linkage between Beit Sahour and Sur Baher. In 1991, Israeli cabinet minister Yitzhak Moda'i approved expropriation of the land, which was owned by a variety of private owners, both Jewish and Arab, on the basis of eminent domain for new building projects conforming to a master plan. Both Jewish and Arab landowners protested the land seizures and appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court, which denied their claims and ruled in favor of the government. The major landholder was David Meir, who then made an alliance with the Arabs whose land had been expropriated to block the development.\n\nPart of the original land is said also to have been owned by the Greek Orthodox Church and allegedly either sold or leased after severe pressure was applied by Israel on church authorities.\n\nAfter the first land expropriations in 1995, Arab states brought the case before the UN Security Council. In May 1995, a draft resolution condemning Israel was vetoed by the US. Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres initially approved construction plans for Jewish homes on the site, but postponed the groundbreaking ceremony to avoid conflict with Palestinians who were seeking to overturn the decision in the Israeli courts.<ref name=\"Boston Globe, 5/1/98\">Boston Globe, 5/1/98</ref> In July 1995, the government decided not to proceed with construction.\n\nOn 19 February 1997, the newly elected Benjamin Netanyahu government approved the construction of the settlement. The Arab states again went to the Security Council. The General Assembly condemned Israel's actions, but two UNSC resolutions in March were again vetoed by the US. In March 1997, the Netanyahu government, which saw the construction of homes in Har Homa as a legitimate expansion of Jerusalem, eventually started the work. In March 2015, Netanyahu said that \"we had to protect the southern gateway to Jerusalem by building here. There was huge objection, because this neighborhood is in a location which prevents the Palestinian (territorial) contiguity.\"\n\nIn October 2014, Netanyahu approved the construction of 400 additional units.\n\nAccording to ARIJ, Israel expropriated 354 dunams of land from Umm Tuba for Har Homa in 1997, while from 1997 onward, Israel expropriated hundreds of dunams of Beit Sahour land for the same purpose.\n\nIn 2013, Har Homa had 12 kindergartens, 6 day care centers, 5 elementary schools, and 4 youth movement centers (Bnei Akiva, Ezra, Ariel, and Beitar). There is no high school and students must take buses to reach nearby high schools in Gilo, Armon HaNatziv or other neighborhoods.\n\nIn 2013, Har Homa had 3 medical clinics and 3 shopping centers.\n\nEgged bus lines connect Har Homa to downtown Jerusalem, the Jerusalem Central Bus Station, the Malha Mall and Ramot. Although many residents work in central Jerusalem, there is also an express bus to Tel Aviv for those who work outside of Jerusalem's environs.\n\nIsraeli officials acknowledged that some Palestinian land was expropriated for the Har Homa neighborhood, but said that nearly 80% of the land taken for the project belonged to Jews. According to FMEP, Israelis own approximately 75% of the land. One-third of it was purchased before 1948, and the remainder during the occupation after 1967. Palestinians owned approximately 33% of the planning area.\n\nIsrael said that Har Homa is within Jerusalem, and construction work does not constitute a change in the status of Jerusalem, in accordance with the Oslo Accords. Furthermore, the land was unoccupied and undeveloped prior to the current construction; both Jewish and Arab landholders were compensated for the land; and residents of Beit Sahour would not be able to develop the land in any event as the Oslo agreements specifically barred Palestinian jurisdiction over Jerusalem for the time being, and also excluded settlements as an issue, leaving it for permanent status negotiations.\n\nResidents of Beit Sahour, in conjunction with Israeli peace activists, campaigned against the decision to build Har Homa neighborhood, setting up what they called an \"international peace camp\" at the site.\n\nMost of the residents of Har Homa today are young families who moved there in search of affordable housing. When the Jerusalem municipality approved the initial 2,500 housing units in Har Homa, it also approved 3,000 housing units and 400 government-financed housing units in the Arab neighborhood of Sur Baher, which faces Har Homa. The plans were drawn up in 1994, but the approval process was stepped up in May 1997 as a counterbalance to Jewish development at Har Homa. Palestinian officials dismissed the project as a ploy aimed at deflecting international criticism.\n\nAfter failing to stop the development of the site, the residents of Beit Sahour have petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court to return the undeveloped land between Beit Sahour and Har Homa to the Palestinian municipality, and to move the security fence to reflect their ownership of this land.\n\nPalestinians have for a long time thought that Israel attempted to tighten their control over Jerusalem by constructing Har Homa.\n\nIn 1997, the U.S. vetoed two UN Security Council resolutions that called on Israel to stop construction work. The U.S. was the only country of the 15 members on the council to vote against the resolution. In a vote of 134 to 3, the United States, along with Israel and Micronesia, were the only countries among the 185 members in the UN General Assembly to vote against an April 1997 resolution demanding an immediate halt to construction at Har Homa. The previous month, a similar resolution condemning Israeli activity at Har Homa was passed 130 to 2, with only the U.S. and Israel voting against it.\n\nWhile the United States has traditionally refrained from describing Jerusalem neighborhoods as settlements, in 2008, then U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was critical of building tenders in Har Homa announced after the Annapolis Conference meeting. She described Har Homa as \"a settlement the United States has opposed from the very beginning\".\n\nIn November 2010, the United States criticized Israeli plans to build new housing units in Har Homa.\n\nIn 2011, then EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said she was disappointed to hear that Israel was planning to expand Har Homa. She said in a statement that \"the European Union has repeatedly urged the government of Israel to immediately end all settlement activities in the West Bank, including in East Jerusalem (...) All settlement activities are illegal under international law\".\n\n"}

The title character was the original \"spunky girl reporter,\" actively seeking to infiltrate and expose criminal activity rather than just report on its consequences and served as a prototype for later characters such as \"Superman\" supporting character Lois Lane and fellow comic strip heroine Brenda Starr, Reporter. Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Mary McGrory credited \"Jane Arden\" with instilling her interest in journalism.\n\n\"Jane Arden\" was only moderately successful in the United States, but it was highly popular in Canada and Australia. The strip was widely reprinted in comic books and was also adapted into both a film and a radio series. \n\n\"Jane Arden\" was created by writer Monte Barrett and artist Frank Ellis for the Register and Tribune Syndicate. Barrett wrote the strip until his death in 1949, and his stories were used until 1952 when Walt Graham assumed the scripting duties. Ellis was one of five artists to draw \"Jane Arden\" over its 41-year run.\n\nThe work of Ellis' replacement, Russell E. Ross, is perhaps most identified with the character, as he drew the strip for 20 years. \n\nDuring the strip's last few years, under creator Bob Schoenke, it was combined with another Register and Tribune strip, \"Laredo Crockett\", to become \"Laredo and Jane Arden\" (from 1964–1968).\n\n\nIt was during Ross' stint that the strip introduced Tubby, an office boy sidekick transported from Ross' previous \"Slim and Tubby\" strip. It was during this period that the strip first included Jane Arden paper dolls and accompanying outfits.\n\nJane Arden was one of the first comic strip characters to become involved in World War II. Immediately after the outbreak of war in Europe, Barrett and Ross scrapped their current storylines and gave her a war assignment in the fictional neutral kingdom of Anderia (September 25, 1939).\n\nReprints of the newspaper strip were published in comic books beginning with \"Famous Funnies\" #2 (September 1934). After issue 35, the reprints appeared in \"Feature Funnies\" #1 (October, 1937), published by Comic Favorites, Inc (a predecessor of Quality Comics). (The Register and Tribune Syndicate was part-owner of Comic Favorites.) 20 issues later, the title was renamed \"Feature Comics\". The Arden reprints continued for ten more issues, and then appeared in the first 25 issues of \"Crack Comics\".\n\nUnited States:\n\nAustralia:\n\nA \"Jane Arden\" radio drama was broadcast from 1938 through 1939 with Ruth Yorke in the title role of the \"fearless girl reporter, the most beautiful woman in the newspaper world.\" First heard in June 1938 on WJZ in New York, the program moved to the Blue Network on September 26, 1938. Sponsored by Ward Baking, the 15-minute serial aired weekdays at 10:15am. Others in the cast: Helene Dumas, Maurice Franklin, Frank Provo, Bill Baar, Henry Wadsworth and Howard Smith. Alan Kent was the announcer. Manny Siegel provided the sound effects for director Lawrence Holcomb. The series ended June 23, 1939.\n\nIn 1939, Warner Bros. released a film adaptation, \"The Adventures of Jane Arden\", with a storyline in which Jane Arden (Rosella Towne) goes undercover to expose a gang of jewel smugglers. However, her identity is discovered by one of the gang leaders. This film, directed by Terry O. Morse, was heralded as the first of a series, but no subsequent Jane Arden films were produced.\n\n"}
{"id": "2278648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278648", "title": "West Germanic gemination", "text": "West Germanic gemination\n\nWest Germanic gemination was a sound change that took place in all West Germanic languages around the 3rd or 4th century AD. It affected consonants directly followed by , which were generally lengthened or geminated in that position. Because of Sievers' law, only consonants immediately after a short vowel were affected by the process.\n\nWhen followed by , consonants were lengthened (doubled). The consonant , whether original or from earlier through rhotacization, was generally not affected; it occasionally shows gemination in Old High German, but inconsistently and this may be an analogical change. In contrast, the second element of the diphthongs \"iu\" and \"au\" was still underlyingly the consonant at this time, and therefore was lengthened as well.\n\nIn Proto-Germanic, only appeared at the beginning of a syllable, primarily as the onset of a variety of suffixes and endings. It alternated with its syllabic counterpart in accordance with a phonological rule known as Sievers' law. This law states that consonantal appeared after a \"light\" syllable: one that contained a short vowel followed by at most one consonant. The syllabic allomorph appeared after \"heavy\" syllables, which included syllables containing a long vowel, a diphthong, or ending in more than one consonant. As the gemination itself required the consonant to be directly followed by , it therefore affected only light syllables; heavy syllables were not changed. Compare, for example, the Germanic verbs \"*fūlijaną\" \"to defile\" and \"*fuljaną\" \"to fill, to make full\", which appear in Old English as \"fȳlan\" and \"fyllan\" respectively, and in Old High German as \"fūlen\" and \"fullen\"; the first verb shows no gemination, while the second does.\n\nIn the early history of most individual Germanic languages, syllabic was generally lost, while consonantal was retained. Earlier consonantal is also lost, however, after a consonant that underwent gemination. Thus, remains only after (Old English \"werian\" < Proto-Germanic \"*warjaną\"), while appears in all other cases, even those where Proto-Germanic had (such as \"*fuljaną\" above). It therefore appears that Sievers' law was still productive at this stage, and adapted to the new syllable length by changing the suffix from its consonantal to its syllabic variety.\n\nWest Germanic gemination also operated inconsistently on consonants followed by /l/ or /r/, e.g. Old English \"æppel\" \"apple\" < Proto-Germanic *aplaz. In some cases this led to doublets, e.g. West Saxon Old English \"tēar\" \"tear (of the eyes)\" < *tæher < Proto-Germanic *tahraz (without gemination) vs. Northumbrian Old English \"tæhher\" \"tear (of the eyes)\" (with gemination).\n\nSimilar changes occurred in the history of Old Norse, although with a more limited scope. The change applied only to the combinations and , which were lengthened to and . Other consonants were not affected. Contrary to the changes in West Germanic, the remained nonsyllabic after the change, and was therefore retained rather than lost like syllabic was in other Old Norse words.\n\nThis change particularly affected the infinitives of the first conjugation of weak verbs, which ended in *-(i)janą. It also affect the short-stemmed ja(n)- and jō(n)-stem nouns and adjectives. By historical times (c. 800-900 AD), all of the West Germanic languages except Old Saxon had lost medial syllabic , but not before any that it may have developed from had triggered i-Mutation. It also triggered palatalization of velar consonants in Old English and Old Frisian: and were geminated into palatal/postalveolar and , which then developed into geminate affricates and , spelled <cc> and <cg> in Old English.\n\nExamples:\n"}

At that time it was evident, that a cease fire would soon be negotiated, and so the Prussian General Eduard von Fransecky received the command to occupy Pressburg (Bratislava). The road from Stomfa to Pressburg ran through a valley in the Little Carpathians. High mountains rise alongside the road at this point, making it an easily defensible point.\n\nThe commander of the Austrian troops in Pressburg Archduke Albrecht had located one brigade there under the command of Colonel Mondela on 18 July.

The Austrian artillery was located near Lamač and Dúbravka, from which point it was able to control the road from Stomfa to Pressburg.\n\nThe brigade was reinforced on 19–21 July by the arrival of the 9th Austrian mountain regiment. On Sunday, the morning of 22 July, the Prussian army began to attack on Lamacs. The second part, under the command of Major-General Bose, moved ahead through over Kamzík hill to surround the Austrian defence and occupy Bratislava.\n\nAbout half past six, the first shot was fired from the Austrian cannon. Prussian forces were warded off and around 8 o'clock they got General Eduard von Fransecky's message: a cease fire was in effect and would take effect at 12 o'clock, only than five hours later. The Prussian General had mounted a large number of artillery pieces, so an artillery duel had already begun. The result was large fires in Lamač and Dúbravka. The Prussian forces were warded off, despite their superior numbers. The battle's success depended on a flanking manoeuvre of Major-General Bose. The brigade moved slowly over the difficult terrain and the ceasefire was already in effect when they arrived at Kamzík. By the setting of a line of demarcation, which overshot by Záhorská Bystrica, the Austro-Prussian war terminated the fights for domination over Germany and central Europe.\n\n\n"}

Pastoral counselors often integrate modern psychological thought and method with traditional religious training in an effort to address psychospiritual issues in addition to the traditional spectrum of counseling services.\n\n\"What distinguishes pastoral counseling from other forms of counseling and psychotherapy is the role and accountability of the counselor and his or her understanding and expression of the pastoral relationship. Pastoral counselors are representatives of the central images of life and its meaning affirmed by their religious communities. Thus pastoral counseling offers a relationship to that understanding of life and faith. Pastoral counseling uses both psychological and theological resources to deepen its understanding of the pastoral relationship.\" Membership in several organizations that combine theology and mental health has grown in recent years. Some pastoral counselors have developed special training programs to encourage cooperation between religious professionals and medical professionals on treatment of issues like addiction, since spirituality is an important part of recovery for many people.\n\nPastoral counseling had its beginnings a separate discipline in North America in the first half of the twentieth century, as various religious organizations began to incorporate the insights and training of psychiatry, psychology and social work into the training of clergy. In 1925, Dr. Richard Cabot, a physician and adjunct at Harvard Divinity School, published an article in the \"Survey Graphic\" suggesting that every candidate for the ministry receive clinical training for pastoral work similar to the clinical training offered to medical students. In the 1930s, the Rev. Anton Boisen began a program of placing theological students in supervised contact with mental patients. In time, many seminaries and other training programs for religious professionals began to include clinical pastoral education as part of clerical training. Also in the 1930s, the minister Norman Vincent Peale and the psychiatrist, Dr. Smiley Blanton, collaborated to form the American Foundation of Religion and Psychiatry, now known as the Blanton-Peale Institute. Today, hundreds of mental health centers with links to specific religious traditions may be found across North America. In 1963, the American Association of Pastoral Counselors was founded to provide professional certification for pastoral counselors and pastoral counseling centers.\n\n\n"}

In his earlier years, Qin studied at the Suzhou Industrial School where he took an active role in activities against imperialism and the warlords tyrannizing China. In 1925 Qin entered Shanghai University, a university that was known for its impact on young revolutionists at the time. The ideas of Marxism and Leninism were taught there by early leaders of the Chinese Communist party like Qu Qiubai and Deng Zhongxia. Qin showed a great interest in these teachings. Later that year, Qin joined the May 30th Movement which called for protests and boycotts against imperialism. This was a precursor to his involvement in the CPC.\n\nIn 1926 Qin was sent to the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow, Russia where he continued to study both Marxism and Leninism. The Sun Yat-sen University was established under Kuomintang founder Sun Yat-sen's alliance policy with the Soviet Union and the CPC. Its aim was to systematically train young revolutionists for Chinese revolution in the Russian fashion. Using the alias \"Bo Gu\", which means \"familiar with histories\" in Chinese, Qin continued his studies while becoming acquainted with Wang Ming, a student who had come to the university a year earlier. Wang and Qin, along with many other students, such as Zhang Wentian, Wang Jiaxiang, and Yang Shangkun formed a group known as the 28 Bolsheviks.\n\nThey regarded themselves as orthodox Marxists, destined to take charge of Chinese revolution. Furthermore, with Wang's connection to Sun Yat-sen University's vice president and future vice minister of the Eastern Department of Comintern, Pavel Mif, the 28 Bolsheviks gained influence. One example being their role as missionaries and interpreters for the 6th National Congress of the CPC held in Moscow, with chances to comment on Chinese affairs.\n\nWith Mif succeeding Radek as president, his protégés, among them Bo Gu, were sent back to take charge of CPC. \nHowever, because of their inexperience in relation to veteran members such as Zhou Enlai and Zhang Guotao, the group was assigned to insignificant work. Then with the direct support from Mif, who came to China as envoy of Comintern, in the 4th Plenary Meeting of 6th National Congress of CPC in 1931 Wang and his associates won the battle with Li Lisan, who was incumbent paramount leader of CPC at that time, and Li's opponents of old CPC members, such as Labor activists He Mengxiong and Lin Yuying. Wang was appointed as member of politburo of CPC, with Mif took charge of CPC headquarter, Wang became the No1 in practice. As a reward, Bo Gu was appointed to be placed in charge of CY. When Wang returned Moscow for medical treatment, Qin was promoted to become a member of the Central Bureau of CPC, and then to be the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in charge of daily work of CPC. Under the policy of extremism and leftism of Li and Wang, CPC suffered great loss in their power struggle with KMT in cities. In 1933 Bo Gu and other members of the Central Bureau such as Zhou Enlai had to evacuate to Soviet Territory, which was the power base set up by CPC, in the countryside, in Jiangxi. Bo Gu, Zhou and Otto Braun, the military advisor from Comintern, found a military command team to replace Mao Zedong's control over the military, who was chairman of the Chinese Soviet Government at that time. Due to a change in Nationalist tactics, the CPC Red Army suffered great losses in Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Suppression against them. Bo Gu and his team had to launch a strategic diversion.\n\nDuring the Long March, the Red Army suffered heavy casualties from time to time, due to no plan and incompetence of command of the three-man leadership team. Especially, when the Red Army crossed the Xiang River, the Red Army was near a rat trap, and half of its elites were annihilated by the KMT army. Discontent and fury over the three-man leadership team increased. Under these circumstances, Mao used his diplomatic skills to communicate with Wang Jiaxiang, General Commissar of Red Army at that time, and got support from most of the generals that once had been loyal to him.\n\nThen in January 1935 came the convening of Zunyi Conference, and with the defection of 28 Bolsheviks members Zhang Wentian, Wang Jiaxiang and Yang Shangkun to Mao's camp, the three-man team's command over military was discharged, Mao, Wang and Zhou Enlai composed a new three-man team to replace them; and Bo Gu's title of General Secretary was replaced by his former associate Zhang, but he remained a member of the politburo.\n\nWhen Bo Gu reached Yan'an with the Red Army, he was still a young man, longing for a bright future of Chinese revolution. In order to make a clear distinction from his past, Bo Gu preferred others called him by his real name Qin instead of his alias. Mao still needed Gu and others of the 28 Bolsheviks such as Zhang Wentian and Wang Jiaxiang for their support in Mao's later power struggle with Wang Ming and Zhang Guotao, and thus Mao gave them some important assignments from time to time. For example, Qin was appointed as representative of CPC with Zhou Enlai and Ye Jianying, and went to Xi'an to handle the Xi'an Incident in 1936, making a contribution for the establishment of United Front against Japan. In 1937 Qin was appointed as Minister of Organization Department of CPC, which was in charge of CPC cadres' promotion and nomination. In 1938 he was the Minister of Organization Department of Yangtze River and then Southern China Division of CPC. In 1941 he was appointed as head of Jie Fang Daily and Xinhua News Agency. Qin showed great enthusiasm in promoting the newspaper and exercised his best endeavor to make it a mouthpiece of CPC. Qin pledged his allegiance to Mao in Mao's struggle with Zhang Guotao, and in Cheng Feng he criticized his former close friend Wang Ming. But Qin still could not obtain favor from Mao and he had suffered greatly from stress and humiliation. His kindness and leniency towards the Cheng Feng movement by the newspaper under his direction received heavy criticism from Mao and his secret police boss Kang Sheng. They regarded Qin's action being inefficient and too merciful. As a result, although Qin was elected as Commissioner of the Central Committee of CPC in the 7th National Congress of CPC in 1945, he was listed as the last one.\n\nAfter the end of World War II in 1945, Mao was invited by Chiang to Chongqing for peace negotiation in order to avoid civil war between CPC and KMT. Qin was one of the delegates of the CPC with Mao, which indicated his appealing to Mao and his prominence in the CPC. Qin attended the following Political Consulting Congress held in Chongqing as delegate of CPC in Feb 1946. When Qin was on his way back to Yan'an, he died in an airplane crash in Shanxi. Among the other victims were several senior CPC leaders such as General Ye Ting, secret police boss Deng Fa, and old CPC member Wang Ruofei (王若飞).\n"}

Between 1655 and 1659, he travelled on the continent with his tutor the poet Edward Sherburne. He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford in 1660 and was made a Knight of the Bath at the coronation of Charles II, the following year.\n\nIn 1667, he went with his uncle Henry Coventry to the negotiations leading to the Treaty of Breda, ending the Second Anglo-Dutch War. That year and in the following parliaments of 1678, 1679 and 1681, he was elected for Weymouth. He followed Lord Ashley in politics, and was a fairly active member.\n\nOn 21 December 1670, owing to a jest made by Coventry in the House of Commons on the subject of the King's amours, Sir Thomas Sandys, an officer of the guards, with other accomplices, by the order of Monmouth, and (it was said) with the approval of the king himself, waylaid him as he was returning home to Suffolk Street and slit his nose to the bone. The outrage created an extraordinary sensation in the Commons, and in consequence Parliament debated a bill ‘to prevent malicious maiming and wounding’ (22 & 23 Chas. II, c.1), a measure known as the \"Coventry Act\" was passed, declaring assaults accompanied by personal mutilation a felony without benefit of clergy, an Act not repealed until 1828.\n\nSir William Coventry, his uncle, speaks slightingly of him, ridicules his vanity and wishes him out of the House of Commons to be out of harm's way. The character of Amnon in John Dryden's \"Absalom and Achitophel\" (1681) is thought to be based on him.\n\nHe was suspected of having become a Roman Catholic while abroad in the 1650s and evidently was when he made his will in 1667. However, during the Exclusion Crisis, he sided with the party seeking the exclusion of the Duke of York from the king's presence.\n\nHe died unmarried.\n\n"}

The preferred name[by whom?] for the group is Fare-Fare. The adopted name Frafra is a corruption from colonial times of the greeting \"Ya fara-fara?\" which means \"How is your suffering [work]?\" It may carry pejorative overtones in local usage. Frafra-language speakers number approximately 300,000. The larger group of Gurunsi people inhabit southern Burkina Faso and northern Ghana.\n\nBolgatanga is the commercial center of the Frafra area. Other important villages and towns include Bongo, Zuarungu, Zoko, and Pwalugu. Tongo is the principal town of the Talensi people, who are ethnically distinct from the Frafra, but most of whom are bilingual in the Frafra language.\n\nThe Frafra share a common history, language and political structure. Most Gurunsi live in Burkina Faso, and the degree to which Frafra history differs from their northerly neighbors, such as the Nuna, Bwa, and Winiama, is linked to their abode in Ghana. These differences arose during colonial times, as French and British colonial systems differed.\n\nFrafra are primarily farmers, growing millet, sorghum and yams. Maize, rice, peanuts, and beans are grown in addition. Farmers throughout the region traditionally practiced slash-and-burn farming, using fields for approximately seven or eight years before they were allowed to lie fallow for at least a decade. In family fields close to villages, women grow cash crops for sale in local markets, including sesame and tobacco.\n\nMen participate in hunting during the long dry season. This is important for ritual reasons since it is during this time that men interact with the spirits that inhabit the bush. During the dry season, when food supplies are running low, some fishing is practiced in local swamps.\n\nIncreasing population-pressure has led to a shortening of fallow-times and a much smaller interval for hunting. Little bushland is available for slash-and-burn methods and the clearing of new farms.\n\nFrafra societies are mainly without social or political stratification. They are not divided among occupational castes or groups since most of them hunt and farm. They had no system of chiefs, and all important decisions were made by a council of elders consisting of the oldest members of each lineage.\n\nReligious leaders hold some political authority, determining the agricultural cycle and parceling out land for cultivation.\n\nBelief in a supreme creator is central to Frafra beliefs. A shrine to this god occupies the center of every village. Each extended family maintains its own house, in which magical lineage objects are kept. The objects allow the family to maintain contact with the vital forces of nature. These objects are inherited by descendants and are the communal property of the lineage, providing protection and social cohesion among all members of the family.\n\nThe most recognized of the Frafra art forms are cast brass jewelry and decorated architecture. In addition, anthropomorphic figures sculpted from clay and wood and various personal objects, ranging from jewelry to wooden stools, are created to honor the spirits.\n\nA body of Frafra literature is emerging. A. Pamzoya first wrote a novel on Frafra culture called \"Souvenir for Death\". Intellectual Agaysika Agambila gathered a collection of Frafra folktales under the title \"Solma: Tales from Northern Ghana\". This was followed by \"Journey\", a novel set in the Frafra area.\n\nFrafra peoples have a special, joking relationship with the Dagaare people of northwestern Ghana, which has its roots in an asserted common ancestry.\n"}

After the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, the Zaatar refugees were expelled from Damour, and the original inhabitants brought back.\n\nAccording to Thomas L. Friedman, the Phalangist Damouri Brigade, which carried out the Sabra and Shatila massacre during the 1982 Lebanon War sought revenge not only for the assassination of Bashir Gemayel, but also for what he describes as past killings of their own people by Palestinians, including those at Damour.\n\nAccording to an eyewitness, the attack took place from the mountain behind the town. \"It was an apocalypse,\" said Father Mansour Labaky, a Christian Maronite priest who survived the massacre. \"They were coming, thousands and thousands, shouting 'Allahu Akbar! (God is great!) Let us attack them for the Arabs, let us offer a holocaust to Mohammad!\", and they were slaughtering everyone in their path, men, women and children.\"\n\nThe bulk of the attacking forces seems to have been composed of brigades from the Palestinian Liberation Army and as-Sa'iqa, as well as other militias, including Fatah. Some sources also mention the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), and the Muslim Lebanese al-Murabitun militia among the attackers. There are reports that PLO forces were additionally joined by militiamen from Syria, Jordan, Libya, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and possibly even Japanese Red Army terrorists who were then undergoing training by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Lebanon.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was one of the most successful silent film stars in the first quarter of the twentieth-century.\n\nBorn in Florence, she was daughter of a woman who may have been an actress, but she was unmarried and Bertini was registered as Elena Taddei at an orphanage in 1892. Her mother, Adelina di Venanzio Fratiglioni, married Arturo Vitiello in 1910 and she took his family name. Bertini began performing on stages at the age of seventeen she began to perform in the just-born Italian movie production. She had a major role in Salvatore Di Giacomo's melodramatic story “Assunta Spina”.\n\nShe had made over 50 films by 1915 including, \"Histoire d'un pierrot\", was under the direction of Baldassarre Negroni in 1913. Gradually she developed her beauty and elegance, plus a strong, intense, and charming personality, which would be the key of her success as a silent movie actress. With \"Assunta Spina\" in 1915 she took care of the scripts as well as performing the role of the main character. Bertini was to claim with some support that she was the true director of the film which included novel acting techniques.\n\nShe was one of the first film actresses to focus on reality, rather than on a dramatic stereotype, an anticipation of Neorealistic canons. The expression of authentic feelings was the key of her success through many films. She could perform with success the languid decadent heroine as well as the popular common woman. Other important roles were Odette, Fedora, Tosca and the Lady of the Camellias.\n\nIn 1920, Fox Film Corporation in Hollywood offered to sign a contract with her, but she refused: she was married to the wealthy Swiss banker Paul Cartier and wanted to move with him to Switzerland. When her husband died, she moved back to Rome, where she would remain until her death.\n\nShe stepped into sound movies as well, but in the meantime the Italian cinema had changed greatly (the period of Telefoni bianchi comedies) and entered into a period of crisis with Fascism and censorship. It experienced a definite hiatus with World War II.\n\nIn 1976 Bernardo Bertolucci was able to convince her to emerge from her stubborn silence, accepting a role of a nun in his movie \"Novecento\". She allowed herself to be interviewed in 1981 and this was adapted for a three part TV documentary in 1982. She died in Rome at the age of 93.\n"}

He is the vain, pompous steward of Olivia's household. He is portrayed as the main antagonist.\n\nIn the play, Malvolio is defined as a kind of Puritan. He despises all manner of fun and games, and wishes his world to be completely free of human sin, yet he behaves very foolishly against his stoic nature when he believes that Olivia loves him. This leads to major conflicts with characters such as Sir Toby Belch, Sir Andrew Aguecheek, and Maria, mistress of the household.\n\nMuch of the play's humour comes from Maria, Feste, Toby Belch, and Andrew Aguecheek tormenting Malvolio with drinking, joking, and singing. Later in the play, Maria devises a way to have revenge upon Malvolio, and proposes it to Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Feste. Maria composes a love letter in Olivia's handwriting, and leaves it so Malvolio will find it. Beforehand, Malvolio had been wishing to marry Olivia. The letter convinces Malvolio that Olivia loves him, and leads Malvolio to think that Olivia wishes him to smile, wear yellow stockings and cross garters. Olivia is in mourning for her brother's death, and finds smiling offensive, and yellow is \"a colour she abhors, and cross garters a fashion she detests\", according to Maria. When Malvolio is imprisoned for being a supposed lunatic after acting out the instructions in the letter, Feste visits him both as himself and in the guise of \"Sir Topas the curate\", and torments Malvolio by making him swear to heretical texts, for example, Pythagorean precepts. At the end of the play he vows, \"I’ll be reveng’d on the whole pack of you\" for his public humiliation, and Olivia acknowledges that he has \"been most notoriously abused.\"\n\nThe role was first played by Richard Burbage at the Globe Theatre. John Marston notes that the actors of his time often played the role with \"contemptuous superiority\"; by contrast his favourite Malvolio, William Ferrin, performed it with \"lofty condescension\". Other actors famed for their performance of Malvolio include Sir Alec Guinness, Henry Irving, E. H. Sothern, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Henry Ainley, Sir John Gielgud, Simon Russell Beale, Maurice Evans, Ken Dodd, Richard Briers, Sir Nigel Hawthorne and Sir Derek Jacobi. Richard Wilson took on the role for the Royal Shakespeare Company's 2009 production. In 2012, Stephen Fry assumed the role at Shakespeare's Globe. In 2017, actress Tamsin Greig portrayed a female version of the character (renamed Malvolia) in Simon Godwin's revival of the play at the Royal National Theatre.\n\nSome Shakespearean scholars hypothesize that the character Malvolio was inspired by Puritan landowner Sir Thomas Posthumous Hoby, who was involved in a well known court case against many of his Yorkshire neighbours in the 1600s. Hoby sued his neighbours when they came uninvited to his house, drank, played cards, mocked his religion, and threatened to rape his wife. Hoby won damages in the case, which may have influenced the scene in \"Twelfth Night\" when Malvolio interrupts Sir Toby's late-night reveling.\n\nThe lines would later be repeated, with a slight alteration, by Feste in the final scene of the play as he mocks Malvolio, who afterward storms off.\n"}
{"id": "2278793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278793", "title": "Parashara", "text": "Parashara\n\nParāśara (Sanskrit: पराशर; IAST: ) was a maharshi and the author of many ancient Indian texts. He is accredited as the author of the first Purana, the Vishnu Purana, before his son Vyasa wrote it in its present form. He was the grandson of Vasishtha, the son of Śakti Maharṣi, and the father of Vyasa. There are several texts which give reference to Parashara as an author/speaker. Modern scholars believe that there were many individuals who used this name throughout time whereas others assert that the same Parashara taught these various texts and the time of writing them varied. The actual sage himself never wrote the texts; the various texts attributed to him are given in reference to Parashara being the speaker to his student. He is the third member of the Ṛṣi Paramparā of the Advaita Guru Paramparā.\n\nAccording to the Vedas, Brahma created Vasishtha, who, with his wife Arundhati, had a son named Śakti Mahariṣhi who sired Parashara. With Satyavati, Parashara is father of Vyasa. Vyāsa sired Dhritarashtra and Pandu through his deceased brother's wives, Ambika and Ambalika and Vidura through a hand-maiden of Ambika and Ambalika. Vyāsa also sired Shuka through his wife, Jābāli's daughter Pinjalā. Thus Parashara was the great-grandfather of both the warring parties of the Mahābhārata, the Kauravas and the Pandavas.\nParashara is used as a gotra for the ancestors and their offsprings thereon.\n\nThere is a story of Rishi Parashara: one day in the time after the death of his father, Sakti Rishi made Vasishtha lived in his hermitage with Adrsyanti (wife of Sakti). Vasistha heard the chanting of the Vedas and Adrsyanti told him that Vedic hymn sounds were coming from the child of his son, Sakti, that was developing in her womb. Vasistha was happy to hear this. Adrsyanti gave birth to a son and the child grew up to become Parashara, father of Vyasa.\n\nParashara was raised by his grandfather Vasishtha because he lost his father at an early age. His father, Śakti Muni, was on a journey and came across an angry rākṣasa (demon) who had once been a king but was turned into a demon feeding on human flesh as a curse from Viśvamitra. The demon devoured Parashara’s father. In the Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Parashara speaks about his anger from this:\n\nI had heard that my father had been devoured by a Rākṣasa employed by Viśvamitra: violent anger seized me, and I commenced a sacrifice for the destruction of the Rākṣasas: hundreds of them were reduced to ashes by the rite, when, as they were about to be entirely exterminated, my grandfather Vasishtha said to me: Enough, my child; let thy wrath be appeased: the Rākṣasas are not culpable: thy father's death was the work of destiny. Anger is the passion of fools; it becometh not a wise man. By whom, it may be asked, is anyone killed? Every man reaps the consequences of his own acts. Anger, my son, is the destruction of all that man obtains by arduous exertions, of fame, and of devout austerities; and prevents the attainment of heaven or of emancipation. The chief sages always shun wrath: be not subject to its influence, my child. Let no more of these unoffending spirits of darkness be consumed. Mercy is the might of the righteous.\n\nParashara Muni (Sage), at the wish of Lord Vishnu, Brahma and Mahadev, who maintain, create and destroy in time the entire universe, on one of his travels across the country, halted for the night in a little hamlet on the banks of the river Yamuna. He was put up in the house of the fisherman-chieftain Dusharaj. When dawn broke, the chief asked his daughter, Matsyagandha, whose name means \"one with the smell of fish\", to ferry the sage to his next destination. When in the ferry, Parashara was attracted by the beautiful girl. He created an island within the river by his mystic potency and asked her to land the boat there. Seeing people on the river's bank, she demurred, at which time the sage created a dense fog which enveloped the entire river. Parashara blessed her with a son, Krishna Dvaipāyana, who was dark-complexioned and hence may be called by the name Krishna (black), and also the name Dwaipayana, meaning 'island-born'. He later compiled the classic Vedic literatures of India, and so is called Vyasa who is the 17th incarnations of Lord Vishnu. Parashara granted her the boon that the finest fragrance may emit from her person. She was thereafter known as Satyavati (pure fragrance).\n\nLeaving Satyavati in the care of Vyasa, Parashara proceeded to perform Tapas (intense meditation). Later Vyasa also became a Rishi and Satyavati returned to her father's house, and in due course, married Śantanu.\n\nParashara was known as the \"limping sage\". He had his leg wounded during an attack on his āśrama. When a ṛṣi dies he merges back into an element or an archetype. When Sage Parashara was walking through a dense forest he and his students were attacked by wolves. He was unable to get away in his old age with a lame leg and he left this world merging into the wolves.\n\nThe Monument of Parashara Muni is available at Junha - Panhala fort in Tal Kavathe Mahankal Sangli district of Maharashtra. A cave supposed to be of Parāśāra Muni is present at the fort.\n\nIn the Ṛigveda, Parashara, son of Śakti Muni (Parashara Śāktya), is the seer of verses 1.65-73 which are all in praise of Agni (the sacred fire), and part of 9.97 (v.31-44) which is in praise of Soma. Below is 1.73.2\n\n\"devo na yaḥ savitā satyamanmā kratvā nipāti vṛjanāni viṣvā\"\n\"purupraṣasto amatirna satya ātmeva Sevo didhiṣāyyo bhūt\"\n\nHe who is like the divine Sun, who knows the truth (of all things), \npreserves by his actions (his votaries) in all encounters; like nature, \nhe is unchangeable and, like soul, is the source of all happiness: he is ever to be cherished.\n\n\n"}

She has received two Filmfare awards and has appeared in over 700 films, and is often cited as one of the most popular nautch dancers of her time. In 2009, Helen was awarded with the Padma Shri by the Government of India. She was the inspiration for four films and a book, and is the second wife of veteran writer-producer Salim Khan.\n\nHelen Ann Richardson was born on 21 November 1938 in Rangoon, Burma to an Anglo-Indian father and Burmese mother. Her father's name was George Desmier and her mother's name was Marlene. She has a brother named Roger and a sister named Jennifer. Their father died during World War II. The family then trekked to Bombay in 1943 in order to escape from the Japanese occupation of Burma. Helen told \"Filmfare\" during an interview in 1964: ...we trekked alternately through wilderness and hundreds of villages, surviving on the generosity of people, for we were penniless, with no food and few clothes. Occasionally, we met British soldiers who provided us with transport, found us refuge and treated our blistered feet and bruised bodies and fed us. By the time we reached Dibrugarh in Assam, our group had been reduced to half. Some had fallen ill and been left behind, some had died of starvation and disease. My mother miscarried along the way. The survivors were admitted to the Dibrugarh hospital for treatment. Mother and I had been virtually reduced to skeletons and my brother's condition was critical. We spent two months in hospital. When we recovered, we moved to Calcutta, and sadly my brother died there due to smallpox\". She quit her schooling to support her family because her mother's salary as a nurse was not enough to feed a family of four. In a documentary called \"Queen of the Nautch girls\", Helen said she was 19 years old in 1957 when she got her first big break in \"Howrah Bridge\"..\n\nHelen was introduced to Bollywood when a family friend, an actress known as Cukoo, helped her find jobs as a chorus dancer in the films \"Shabistan\" and Awara (1951).

During her initial career, Geeta Dutt sang many songs for her. \n\nThe Bollywood playback singer Asha Bhosle also frequently sang for Helen, particularly during the 1960s and the early 1970s. She was nominated for the \"Filmfare\" Best Supporting Actress Award in 1965 for her role in \"Gumnaam\". She played dramatic roles in films like China Town and Sachaai starring Shammi kapoor which went on to be very successful at the box office. She also played a sensitive character in film Chhote Sarkar(1974) starring Shammi kapoor and Sadhana. With Shammi kapoor she did many hit dance numbers like 'Suku suku' in Junglee , ' Yama yama' in China town , 'O haseena zulfonwali' in Teesri Manzil, 'Hai pyar ka hi naam' in Singapore and 'Muqabala hamse na karo' in Prince.\n\nWriter Salim Khan helped her get roles in some of the films he was co-scripting with Javed Akhtar: \"Immaan Dharam\", \"Don\", \"Dostana\", and \"Sholay\". This was followed by a role in Mahesh Bhatt's film \"Lahu Ke Do Rang\" (1979), for which she won a Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award. In 1999 Helen was given India's Filmfare lifetime achievement award.\n\nHelen officially retired from movies in 1983, but she has since then appeared in a few guest roles such as \"\" (1996) and \"Mohabbatein\" (2000).

{"id": "2278805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278805", "title": "Contagious Diseases Acts", "text": "Contagious Diseases Acts\n\nThe Contagious Diseases Acts (CD Acts) were originally passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1864 (27 & 28 Vict. c. 85), with alterations and editions made in 1866 (29 & 30 Vict. c. 35) and 1869 (32 & 33 Vict. c. 96). In 1862, a committee was established to inquire into venereal disease (i.e. sexually transmitted infections) in the armed forces. On its recommendation the first Contagious Diseases Act was passed. The legislation allowed police officers to arrest women suspected of being prostitutes in certain ports and army towns. The women were then subjected to compulsory checks for venereal disease. If a woman was declared to be infected, she would be confined in what was known as a lock hospital until she recovered or her sentence finished. The original act only applied to a few selected naval ports and army towns, but by 1869 the acts had been extended to cover eighteen \"subjected districts\".\n\nThe Act of 1864 stated that women found to be infected could be interned in locked hospitals for up to three months, a period gradually extended to one year with the 1869 Act. These measures were justified by medical and military officials as the most effective method to shield men from venereal disease. Because military men were often unmarried and homosexuality was criminal, prostitution was considered a necessary evil. However, no provision was made for the examination of prostitutes' clientele, which became one of the many points of contention in a campaign to repeal the Acts.\n\nAfter 1866, proposals were introduced to extend the acts to the north of England and to the civilian population. It was suggested that this extension would regulate prostitution and stop street disorders caused by it in large cities.\n\nThe subject of venereal disease, known as social disease, created significant controversy within Victorian society. The Contagious Diseases Acts themselves affected thousands of people's lives, from campaigners to prostitutes themselves. They sparked the debate over inequality between men and women. It was an early political issue that led to women organising themselves and actively campaigning for their rights.\n\nThe inconsistent treatment of genders inherent in the acts was a key part of Josephine Butler's campaigns for their repeal. In one of her public letters, she allowed a prostitute to deliver her own account of her personal encounters with men:\n\nFlorence Nightingale’s opposition to the “Continental system” or state regulation of prostitution probably delayed passage of the legislation by a couple of years. However, the first Contagious Diseases Act was adopted, after scarcely any debate—it was introduced without warning—in 1864.\n\nIn 1862, she prepared and had printed a thorough critique of the regulatory approach in \"Note on the Supposed Protection Afforded against Venereal Diseases, by recognizing Prostitution and Putting it under Police Regulation\". The paper included statistics of hospital admissions for venereal disease for various army units at various stations. It showed that the system of regulation did not result in lower rates of disease. However, the legislation proceeded.\n\nNightingale next recruited journalist Harriet Martineau to write on the subject and gave her background material. She published \"The Contagious Diseases Acts, as applied to Garrison Towns and Naval Stations\", in 1870. Her four articles in it, in the \"Daily News,\" by “an Englishwoman” ran on each of the last four days of 1869, the last of which launched “The Ladies’ National Association for the Repeal of the contagious Diseases Acts.” It was co-signed by leading women opponents of the Acts. Josephine Butler, who went on to lead the lengthy campaign for repeal, was the third signatory, after Nightingale and Martineau.\n\nWhen the first woman to qualify as a doctor in England, Elizabeth Garrett, wrote in favour of the Acts, Nightingale, using the name “Justina,” opposed her, with two articles, in the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" in 1870. Nightingale continued to give support behind-the-scenes to the repeal campaign.\n\nThe level of prostitution was high in Victorian England. The acts themselves would have affected a large proportion of the female workforce in Britain. For several reasons prostitution was predominantly a working class profession. For many working-class women their journey into prostitution was one of circumstance. During the nineteenth century the public began to concern itself with particular social problems, an increasing view of the \"ideal woman\" was beginning to emerge and the \"angel of the home\" was becoming a popular stereotype. This rise of the middle class domestic morality made it increasingly harder for women to obtain work in certain professions, causing an increase in such areas as needle-trades, shop girls, agricultural gangs, factory work, and domestic servants, all occupations with long hours and little pay. Low earnings, it is argued, meant that women had to resort to prostitution to be able to provide for themselves and their families, particularly in households where the main breadwinner was no longer around. The figures below, however, show this to be untrue. A study from the late Victorian period showed that more than 90 per cent of prostitutes in Millbank prison were the daughters of \"unskilled and semiskilled workingmen\", more than 50 per cent of whom had been servants, the rest having worked in dead-end jobs such as laundering, charring, and street selling.\n\nThe nature of the occupation makes it difficult to establish the exact number of prostitutes in operation during the Victorian Period. Judicial reports of the years 1857 to 1869 show that prostitutes were more common in commercial ports and pleasure resorts and less so in hardware towns, cotton and linen manufacturing centres and woollen and worsted centres. The Westminster Review placed the figure between 50,000 and 368,000. This would make prostitution the fourth-largest female occupation. However, the police estimates of known prostitutes portray an entirely different estimate:\n\nPolice estimates of known prostitutes\nHowever, this table relates only prostitutes known to the police. The unreliability of statistics during the nineteenth century prevents one from knowing if prostitution was increasing or decreasing during this period, but it is clear that Victorians during the 1840s and 1850s thought that prostitution and venereal disease were increasing.\n\nRegulating prostitution was the government's attempt to control the high level of venereal disease in its armed forces. By 1864, one out of three sick cases in the army was caused by venereal disease; admissions into hospitals for gonorrhoea and syphilis reached 290.7 per 1,000 of total troop strength.\n\nProstitutes found work within the armed forces, mainly due to servicemen's forced celibacy and the conditions of the barracks the men were forced to endure. The barracks were overcrowded, and had a lack of ventilation and defective sanitation. Very few servicemen were permitted to marry, and even those who were, were not given an allowance to support their wives, which occasionally lured them to become prostitutes as well.\n\nIn 1867, the Association for Promoting the Extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts was established and was just as prominent in the publishing of pamphlets and articles as the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was. The Association strongly campaigned for the extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts to be extended outside of the naval and army barracks and be made effective to the whole of the country, as they believed this was the best way of regulating prostitution.\n\nThere was much action taken towards the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. In 1869, the National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was established; initially restricting women from its meetings, causing the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts to be quickly established by Josephine Butler. These repeal organisations attracted the vigorous support of moralists and feminists but also those more generally concerned with civil liberties, especially since the Acts were perceived as having violated basic human rights. Both groups actively campaigned against the acts and between 1870 and 1885, 17,365 petitions against the acts bearing 2,606,429 signatures were presented to the House of Commons, and during the same period, more than 900 meetings were held.\nThe repealists struck a chord with the public consensus on the issues surrounding prostitution and they highlighted the issue of double standards.\n\nIt was the men and women of the National Association and the Ladies National Association who won the battle over the Contagious Diseases Acts, and, in 1886, the Acts were repealed.\n\nIf a woman was declared diseased she would be confined in what were known as lock hospitals. The lock hospitals or lock wards were designed specifically to treat those infected with a venereal disease since 1746. Conditions in lock hospitals may have been inadequate. An 1882 survey estimated that there were only 402 beds for female patients in all the voluntary lock hospitals in Great Britain, and out of this number only 232 were \"funded for use\". Female venereal patients generally had to resort to workhouse infirmaries.\n\nExtensive archives on the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts are held at the Women's Library at the Library of the London School of Economics.\n\n\n\n"}

A close advisor to the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa, he had an important influence on Imperial politics, mainly in the Italian conflict of Guelphs and Ghibellines.\n\nRainald was a scion of the Counts of Dassel, who had inherited large estates in the Suilbergau of Saxony upon the extinction of the ducal Billung dynasty in 1106. A younger son of the affluent count Reinold I of Dassel, he was destined as such to be an ecclesiastic, while his elder brother Ludolf succeeded in the Dassel county.\n\nRainald's father sent him to the Hildesheim Cathedral school and at a later date he probably went to Paris in France, where he studied with Adam of Balsham. As early as 1130 he is said to have had a high reputation for classical learning, and to have been a member of the Hildesheim cathedral chapter. He started working as a subdeacon under Bishop Bernard about 1146 and accompanied Abbot Wibald of Stavelot to the Roman Curia. According to documentary evidence he was appointed provost in 1148. \n\nRainald became one of the most important dignitaries in Hildesheim, where had the first stone bridge built above the Innerste river. He represented the diocese at the 1148 Council of Reims, presided over by Pope Eugene III, openly opposing a canon concerned with clerical dress. Particular attention was paid to his statements by John of Salisbury, who mentioned him in his \"Historia Pontificalis\". In 1153 Rainald received the provostship of the St Maurice monastery in Hildesheim and St Peter's Abbey in Goslar. Soon after, he was also appointed provost of the Münster Cathedral chapter (in 1154), of the Maastricht Basilica of Saint Servatius (1156), and of Xanten Cathedral. However, when a new Bishop of Hildesheim was elected in 1153, he declined the see.\n\nFrederick Barbarossa, elected King of the Romans in 1152, soon noticed Rainald's talents. As a member of the legation sent to Pope Eugene III at Rome he first revealed his political ability. After Frederick had been crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Adrian IV in 1155, he appointed Rainald his chancellor.\n\nIn the rising conflict between emperor and papacy, the Diet of Besançon in October 1157 left no doubt as to the drift of Rainald's policies. He issued a directive which insisted upon the rights and the power of the Emperor, especially in the Kingdom of Italy, the strengthening of the autonomus German Catholic clergy, and the reduction of the influence of the papacy. Full of life, at times rough and blunt and again careful and calculating, Rainald, who, in spite of his ecclesiastical dignities, knew how to wield the sword, henceforth influenced the policy of his Imperial master.\n\nThe struggle with the Curia escalated at the Diet of Besançon, where Rainald entered into a fierce controversy with the papal legate Roland of Siena (later Pope Alexander III), vigorously rejecting Pope Adrian's use of the word \"beneficium\", which might mean fief as well as benefit. In the expression used, that the pope would have been glad to grant the emperor even greater \"beneficia\" (or benefits), it was thought that the old desire of the Curia for the mastery of the world was to be found.\n\nThough Rainald did not wish to separate Germany entirely from Rome and still held the medieval respect for the Church, his temperament carried Barbarossa much further than the latter desired, or then was advantageous in the circumstances. When Frederick finally submitted, it was Rainald who prevented him from making concessions which might have proved of advantage. In 1158 he and Duke Otto I of Bavaria undertook a diplomatic journey into Italy to prepare the way for the emperor's campaign.\n\nIn January 1159 the imperial envoy Rainald entered the city of Milan, which had been peacefully conquered in 1158, however, he was expelled and almost murdered by the inhabitants. While still staying in an Imperial army camp, he was appointed Archbishop of Cologne and Archchancellor of Italy in absence, as successor of the late Frederick II of Berg. When Pope Adrian died in 1159, the double election of Pope Alexander III and Victor IV led to a schism, during which Rainald aimed at strengthening the Imperial antipope Victor. At the 1160 Council of Pavia, he served as the emperor's ambassador and was employed in diplomatic negotiations with Genoa, Pisa, as well as the courts of King Louis VII of France and King Henry II of England, whom he endeavoured to win to the side of the antipope but did not succeed.\n\nIn 1162 Emperor Barbarossa began a second siege of Milan, which would end with the destruction of the city. In 1163 Alexander III excommunicated Rainald, who had loudly proclaimed in these negotiations the right of the emperor to dispose of the papal see. Basing his action on the Roncalian decrees issued at the Diet of Roncaglia, near Piacenza, in 1158, Rainald was once more successfully employed in Italy in the affairs of the emperor. When Victor IV died, Rainald, of his own volition and without waiting for the consent of the emperor, elected at Lucca a new antipope, Paschal III. Frederick would hardly have continued the schism. Rainald knew this and therefore wished to force the emperor to continue the struggle for imperial supremacy.\n\nBack in Germany in 1164, he brought the bones of the Three Magi with him to Cologne as loot from Milan and as a gift of emperor Frederick Barbarossa; today they are still in the Cologne Cathedral. In the meantime the number of the adherents against the lawful pope increased in Germany. Rainald finally won the consent of the English king to common ecclesiastico-political action in behalf of Paschal III and once more took up arms in defence of his one ambition, which he hoped the proposed canonization of Charlemagne at Aachen in 1165 would advance. The new alliance was sealed by the engagement of King Henry's daughter Matilda with the Saxon duke Henry the Lion. In this period Rainald was notably the patron of the Archpoet.\n\nIn 1167 he was again in Italy, actively engaged in preparing the way for the emperor. Together with Archbishop Christian I of Mainz, and under Rainald's guidance an army won a victory over a much larger force of Roman troops at the Battle of Monte Porzio on 29 May 1167 and laid siege to the city. His death soon after was likely of malaria; his mortal remains were transferred to Cologne and buried in the Lady Chapel of the Cathedral.\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "2278810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278810", "title": "Beer in New Zealand", "text": "Beer in New Zealand\n\nBeer is the most popular alcoholic drink in New Zealand, accounting for 63% of available alcohol for sale. At around 64.7 litres per person per annum, New Zealand is ranked 27th in global beer consumption per capita. The vast majority of beer produced in New Zealand is a type of lager, either pale or amber in colour, and typically 4% – 5% alcohol by volume.\n\nAlthough the two largest breweries in New Zealand, Lion Nathan and DB Breweries, control almost 90% of sales by volume between them, there are over 150 smaller craft breweries and brewpubs producing a vast range of beer styles, including many ales.\n\nThere is no oral tradition or archaeological evidence of the indigenous people of New Zealand (Māori) brewing beer before the arrival of Europeans and major ingredients of beer were not introduced to New Zealand until Europeans arrived in the late 18th century.\n\nCaptain Cook was the first to brew beer in New Zealand, on Resolution Island while anchored in Dusky Sound, Fiordland. He experimented with the use of young rimu branches and leaves as a treatment against scurvy, plus wort, molasses and leaves of the mānuka (tea tree). It was brewed on Saturday 27 March 1773 \n\nThe first commercial brewery in New Zealand was established in 1835 by Joel Samuel Polack in Kororareka (now Russell) in the Bay of Islands. During the 19th century, New Zealand inherited the brewing traditions and styles of the United Kingdom and Ireland, being where the majority of European immigrants originated from during that time – thus the dominant beer styles would have been ales, porters & stouts.\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th century, similar to the UK and the US, the Temperance movement had become a powerful and popular lobby group. In 1919 at a national referendum poll, prohibition gained 49% of the vote and was only defeated when the votes of returned servicemen were counted. However, one aspect of wartime regulation was made permanent: a 6 pm closing time for licensed premises. This created the culture of the Six o'clock swill, a law that was not repealed until 1967, and was to have an influence on the styles of beer brewed and drunk in New Zealand.\n\nIn the 1930s, the New Zealander Morton Coutts invented the continuous fermentation process. Gradually, beer production in New Zealand shifted from ales to lagers, using continuous fermentation. The style of beer made by this method has become known as New Zealand Draught, and became the most popular beer during the period of 6 pm closing.\n\nDuring the same period, there was a gradual consolidation of breweries, such that by the 1970s virtually all brewing concerns in New Zealand were owned by either Lion Breweries or Dominion Breweries. Later, in the 1980s, small boutique or microbreweries started to emerge, and consequently the range of beer styles being brewed increased. The earliest was Mac's Brewery, started in 1981 in Nelson. Some pubs operated their own small breweries, often housed within the pub itself.\n\nIn recent years, pale and amber lager, the largest alcoholic drinks sector in terms of volume sales, have been on a downward trend as a result of a declining demand for standard and economy products.\n\nConversely, ale production in New Zealand is primarily undertaken by small independent breweries & brewpubs, the Shakespeare Brewery in Auckland city being the first opened in 1986 for the 'craft' or 'premium' sector of the beer market. In 2010, this 'craft/premium' sector grew by 11%, to around 8% of the total beer market. This has been in a declining beer market, where availability of beer has dropped 7% by volume in the two previous years.\n\nWith a growth rate of 25% per year, Craft beer and microbreweries were blamed for a 15 million litre drop in alcohol sales overall in 2012, with Kiwis opting for higher-priced premium beers over cheaper brands.\n\nThe craft beer market in New Zealand is varied and progressive, with a full range of ale & lager styles of beer being brewed. New Zealand is fortunate in that it lies in the ideal latitude for barley and hops cultivation. A breeding programme had developed new hop varieties unique to New Zealand, many of these new hops have become mainstays in New Zealand craft beer.\n\nGiven the small market and relative high number of breweries, many breweries have spare capacity. A recent trend has seen the rise of contract brewing, where a brewing company contracts to use space in existing breweries to bring the beer to the market. Examples of contract brewers include Epic Brewing Company, Funk Estate and Yeastie Boys.\n\nOver 2011 and 2012, New Zealand faced a shortage of hops, which affected several brewers countrywide. The shortage was primarily caused by a hop shortage in North America. Brewers Guild president Ralph Bungard noted that Americans were scrambling to get their hands on Kiwi hops as they were becoming more trendy in the American micro-brew market. One specialty brewery, Tuatara Brewery had just commenced production of an American Pale Ale—when the American hop shortage arose, they then created an Aotearoa Pale Ale, with New Zealand hops.\n\nThe most widely recognised style of beer to have originated in New Zealand is NZ Draught. This is generally a malty, lightly hopped amber lager between 4% – 5% abv. Martyn Cornell, the British beer writer, has suggested that New Zealand Draught is partly an evolution of the late 19th century Mild Ale, which was popular with the British working classes, many of whom emigrated to New Zealand. However, the beer is usually brewed using the continuous fermentation process and a lager yeast. During the period of the six o'clock swill, the beer was dispensed from kegs directly into customer's beer jugs using a hose and tap.\n\nMuch of the original ale lineage lingers on in the branding of nearly all NZ Draught beer, e.g. Speights Gold Medal Ale. In addition to this, the New Zealand Consumers' Institute recently criticised Tui for claiming to be an \"East India Pale Ale\" when it is in fact an amber lager that bears no resemblance to the traditionally hoppy, bitter India Pale Ale style.\n\n\nIn addition, some international brands are brewed under licence in New Zealand. Some examples are Heineken, Amstel, and Tiger (DB Breweries); Kingfisher, Carlsberg, Holsten, and Tuborg (Boundary Road); and Kilkenny, Corona, Budweiser, Guinness, Stella Artois, and Beck's (Lion Nathan).\n\nThe following list contains some of the notable craft breweries of New Zealand. There are numerous other small breweries and brands. \n\n\n"}

The lyrics are by Lou Reed, with music composed by John Cale, Sterling Morrison, Maureen Tucker and Reed.\n\nThe song concerns drug use, violence, homosexuality, and transvestism. Reed said of the lyrics: \"'Sister Ray' was done as a joke—no, not as a joke, but it has eight characters in it and this guy gets killed and nobody does anything. It was built around this story that I wrote about this scene of total debauchery and decay. I like to think of 'Sister Ray' as a transvestite smack dealer. The situation is a bunch of drag queens taking some sailors home with them, shooting up on smack and having this orgy when the police appear.\" \n\nAt 17 minutes 29 seconds, it is the longest song on \"White Light/White Heat\", taking up most of the second side of the record, as well as the longest song in the Velvet Underground's studio discography.\n\nRock critic Lester Bangs wrote in 1970, \"The early Velvets had the good sense to realize that whatever your capabilities, music with a simple base was the best. Thus, \"Sister Ray\" evolved from a most basic funk riff seventeen minutes into stark sound structures of incredible complexity.\"\n\n\"Sister Ray\" was recorded in one take. The band agreed to accept whatever faults occurred during recording, resulting in over seventeen minutes of improvised material. The song was recorded with Reed providing lead vocals and guitar, Morrison on guitar, and Tucker on drums, while Cale plays an organ routed through a distorted guitar amplifier. Morrison remarked that he was amazed at the volume of Cale's organ during the recording and that he had switched the guitar pickup on his Fender Stratocaster from the bridge position to the neck position to get \"more oomph\". It is also notable that the song features no bass guitar because Cale, who usually played bass or viola, played organ on the take. The band had a sponsorship from Vox amplifiers, which allowed use of top-of-the-line amps and distortion pedals to create a very distorted and noisy sound.\n\nAfter the opening sequence, which is a modally flavored I-bVII-IV G-F-C chord progression, much of the song is led by Cale and Reed exchanging percussive chords and noise for over ten minutes, similar to avant-jazz. Reed recalled that recording engineer Gary Kellgren walked out while recording the song: \"The engineer said, 'I don't have to \"listen to this\". I'll put it in Record, and then I'm \"leaving\". When you're done, come get me.'\"\n\nReed called the song \"Sister Ray\" in a nod to Ray Davies of the British band the Kinks.\n\n\n\"Sister Ray\" was a concert favorite of the band, who regularly closed their set with the song. The studio recording of the song was recorded in one single take that lasts over seventeen minutes, while live versions were known to last as much as half an hour or more. The triple live album \"\", released in 2001, features three live performances of \"Sister Ray\" from 1969, with approximate running times of 24, 38 and 29 minutes.

The site once featured a royal pavilion — said to have been the most beautiful royal villa of the time — but the only remains today is a granite water feature. This abalone-shaped watercourse highlights the importance of water in traditional Korean gardens. The \"Poseokjeong\" consists of several hand-carved stone pieces. These pieces create very geometric shape and it sloped slightly for the smooth water flow. At that time, people gathered around the Poseokjeong. They floated their cups (for alcohol) and when the cup stops at a person, he should drink and recite a poem.\n\nDuring banquets in the last days of the Unified Silla kingdom, the king's official and noble guests would sit along the watercourse, chatting and reciting poetry, engaged in drinking games. One of the guests would start by enunciating a line of poetry, challenge one of the other guests to compose an appropriate second line while floating of cup wine in the water. Due to the variety of curves in the channel, the speed the wine cups transversed the course was influenced by the shape of the cup, rate of the water flow and the level of the wine in the cup. Should the cup of wine reach the guest before he could submit a suitable subsequent line he must consume that entire cup of wine and try again, and again, until the task was accomplished.\n\nThe site has an area of 7,432 m²/4.6 mi². There are no records of when Poseokjeong was built, but the stone channel is known to have been created in the time of Unified Silla. It was designated as historic site No.1 in 1963. Poseokjeong is named after the abalone-shaped water feature. The feature itself is about 10.3 m/11.2 yd in length and 5 m/5.4 yd in width, and consists of 63 blocks of granite. These blocks are on average 26 cm/10.2 in deep and 35 cm/13.8 in wide. Zelkova, pine and bamboo trees preserve a calm atmosphere at Poseokjeong today, but the garden was tended differently at the time. Some of the trees are several hundred years old.\n\nWhen still in use, the watercourse is thought to have used water from the nearby stream in the Namsan valley. The water of the Namsan valley was appreciated by the Silla people for its purity and cleanliness. A stone turtle once spewed the water, but this feature does not remain today.\n\nA legend is linked with Poseokjeong. According to this legend, the spirit of Namsan attended a party of king Heong-gang Wang. The king danced after the god, which according to the legend started a Silla dance known as \"eomu sansinmu\" (King Dances, God Dances).\n\nKing Gyeong-ae Wang (924-927) was killed at Poseokjeong, while indulging in his pleasures here, by Gyeonhwon of later Baekje. For that reason Poseokjeong stands symbolically for the demise of the Silla kingdom.\n\n"}

It was first published anonymously in The Royal Devonport Telegraph and Plymouth Chronicle in September 1826. Over 100 years after the events.\n\nHawker, a churchman, assumed that the Trelawny mentioned in the song was Sir Jonathan Trelawny, the Bishop of Bristol, who had been imprisoned in the Tower of London by King James II in 1688. However it is more likely that it referred to his grandfather, Sir John Trelawny, a Cornish Royalist leader who had been imprisoned by parliament in 1628. The people of Cornwall did not actually march to rescue Trelawny, as told in the song. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London for three weeks, then tried and acquitted.\n\nAccording to Cornish historian Robert Morton Nance, \"The Song of the Western Men\" was possibly inspired by the song \"Come, all ye jolly tinner boys\" which was written more than ten years earlier in about 1807, when Napoleon Bonaparte made threats that would affect trade in Cornwall at the time of the invasion of Poland. \"Ye jolly tinner boys\" contains the line \"Why forty thousand Cornish boys shall know the reason why.\"\n\nIn 1881, at the laying of the foundation stone of the Cathedral at Truro, the song was described by Canon Harvey as \"... the national anthem of our dear Cornwall.\" The song is a regular favourite sung at Cornish rugby union matches and other Cornish gatherings. In some schools in Cornwall, the children are taught the first verse and chorus, and sing it at events such as Murdoch Day and St Piran's Day (5 March). Since 2016 the latter occasion has also seen the 'Trelawny Shout' - the song being sung in pubs across Cornwall for charity.\n\nA good sword and a trusty hand!<br>\nA merry heart and true! <br>\nKing James's men shall understand <br>\nWhat Cornish lads can do! <br>\nAnd have they fixed the where and when? <br>\nAnd shall Trelawny die? <br>\nHere's twenty thousand Cornish men <br>\nWill know the reason why!\n\nOut spake their Captain brave and bold: <br>\nA merry wight was he: <br>\nThough London Tower were Michael's hold, <br>\nWe'll set Trelawny free! <br>\nWe'll cross the Tamar, land to land: <br>\nThe Severn is no stay: <br>\nWith \"one and all,\" and hand in hand; <br>\nAnd who shall bid us nay?\n\nAnd when we come to London Wall,<br>\nA pleasant sight to view, <br>\nCome forth! come forth! ye cowards all:<br>\nHere's men as good as you. <br>\nTrelawny he's in keep and hold; <br>\nTrelawny he may die: <br>\nHere's twenty thousand Cornish bold <br>\nWill know the reason why\n\nThere are two versions of the song in Cornish.

Manning lived on Cougar Mountain, within the city limits of Bellevue, Washington, calling his home the \"200 meter hut\". His book \"Walking the Beach to Bellingham\" is an autobiography and manifesto fleshing out his journal of a hike along the shore of Puget Sound over a two-year span.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1956, Harvey Manning managed Seattle radio station KISW.\n\nHarvey Manning died November 12, 2006, in Bellevue.\n\nManning is most famous for being the editorial committee chair for the first edition of \"\", a textbook for climbing and scrambling. The first edition was so successful that it created Mountaineers Books, the publishing outlet of The Mountaineers.\n\nManning is also noted for writing the \"100 Hikes\" series of hiking guidebooks, along with Ira Spring:\nThese guidebooks are the standard books for hiking throughout western Washington.\n\nManning also wrote many other books on outdoor activities, including:\n\nManning advocated trail protection and maintenance for much of his life, based on his extensive experience in the Washington outdoors (having backpacked since the 1930s). He was the bane of mountain bikers in the Seattle area. Manning believed foot traffic (both the boots and the horseshoe variety) cannot coexist with the greater speeds of bicycle enthusiasts and disdained local politicians beholden to wheeled-recreation advocates for \"spouting pure Lycra\". Largely as a result of his efforts, Cougar Mountain is off-limits to bikes and even Tiger Mountain has very limited single-track mileage where bikes are permitted.\n\nManning was a member of the North Cascades Conservation Council (NCCC) since its founding in 1957, serving as an editor of the NCCC journal \"The Wild Cascades.\" Back issues are available on the NCCC website, see link below. A DVD of images of the North Cascades with his writing as the script is released by Crest Pictures as \"The Irate Birdwatcher,\" which was a moniker he used in his early writings. His final book, published by NCCC, is \"Wilderness Alps: Conservation and Conflict in the North Cascades,\" and details the history of the preservation movement there. It is available at the NCCC website.\n\nMany of the names for peaks, creeks, wetlands, and trails on Cougar Mountain were invented by Harvey Manning. He discovered Coal Creek Falls and beat a trail to it, and discovered the foundation for the steam hoist in Red Town. With the goal of preserving wildlands within urban King County, Manning designated (in the pages of \"Footsore 1\") the odd twenty mile-long spur of Cascade Mountain foothills along I-90 near Seattle as the \"Issaquah Alps\" and founded the Issaquah Alps Trails Club in 1979. The club serves to improve and publicize hiking around Issaquah, Washington. A bronze statue of Manning stands in an Issaquah park.\n\nToday many of his conservation goals are carried on by the American Alps Legacy Project, an initiative of NCCC and the Mountaineers.\n\n"}

{"id": "2278861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278861", "title": "General Chinese", "text": "General Chinese\n\nGeneral Chinese () is a diaphonemic orthography invented by Yuen Ren Chao to represent the pronunciations of all major varieties of Chinese simultaneously. It is \"the most complete genuine Chinese diasystem yet published\". It can also be used for the Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese pronunciations of Chinese characters, and challenges the claim that Chinese characters are required for interdialectal communication in written Chinese.\n\nGeneral Chinese is not specifically a romanization system, but two alternative systems: one (\"Tung-dzih Xonn-dzih\") uses Chinese characters phonetically, as a syllabary of 2082 glyphs, and the other (\"Tung-dzih Lo-maa-dzih\") is an alphabetic romanization system with similar sound values and tone spellings to Gwoyeu Romatzyh.\n\nThe character version of General Chinese uses distinct characters for any traditional characters that are distinguished phonemically in any of the control varieties of Chinese, which consist of several dialects of Mandarin, Wu, Min, Hakka, and Yue. That is, a single syllabic character will correspond to more than one logographic character only when these are homonyms in all control dialects. In effect, General Chinese is a syllabic reconstruction of the pronunciation of Middle Chinese, less distinctions which have been dropped nearly everywhere.\n\nThe result is a syllabary of 2082 syllables, about 80% of which are single morphemes—that is, in 80% of cases there is no difference between GC and standard written Chinese, and in running text, that figure rises to 90–95%, as the most common morphemes tend to be uniquely identified. For example, \"kai\" can mean only 開 \"kāi\" 'open', and \"sam\" can mean only 三 \"sān\" 'three'. Chao notes, \"These syllables then are morphemes, or words with definite meanings, or clusters of meanings related by extensions. About 20 percent of the syllables are homophones under each of which there will be more than one morpheme, [which are traditionally] usually written with different characters [...] The degree of homophony is so low that it will be possible to write text either in literary or colloquial Chinese with the same character for each syllable [...] as has been tested in texts of various styles.\" Chao compares General Chinese to how Chinese was written when the writing system was still productive: \"This amounts to a 100 percent use of writing Chinese by 'phonetic loan' [...] The situation is that when the ancients wrote a character by sound regardless of meaning, it was a 'loan character', whereas if a modern schoolboy writes one, he is punished for writing the wrong character!\"\n\nTaking a telegraphic code-book of about 10,000 characters as a representative list of characters in modern use, Chao notes that General Chinese results in a reduction of 80% in the number of characters needing to be learned.\n\nIn the 20% of cases where a syllable corresponded to more than one word, Chao generally selected the graphically most basic traditional character for General Chinese, as long as it wasn't unduly rare. However, when that character had strong semantic connotations that would have interfered with a phonetic reading, he selected a more neutral character. This phenomenon is familiar from Chinese transcriptions of foreign names.\n\nRomanized General Chinese has distinct symbols for the onsets (many of them digraphs, and a few trigraphs) and the rimes distinguished by any of the control dialects. For example, it retains the final consonants \"p, t, k\", and the distinction between final \"m\" and \"n\", as these are found in several modern dialects, such as Cantonese. General Chinese also maintains the \"round-sharp\" distinction, such as \"sia\" vs. \"hia\", though those are both \"xia\" in Beijing Mandarin. It also indicates the \"muddy\" (voiced) stops of Shanghainese. Indeed, Chao characterized GC as having \"the initial consonants of the Wu dialects [...], the vowels of Mandarin, and the endings of Cantonese. It can, however, be pronounced in any dialect, and it is meant to be, by a relatively short list of rules of pronunciation.\"\n\nLike Chao's other invention, Gwoyeu Romatzyh, romanized General Chinese uses tone spelling. However, the system is somewhat different. The difference between the \"yin\" and \"yang\" tones is indicated by the voicing of the initial consonant, which is possible because the original voicing distinctions are retained. Given that some tones are indicated by changing rather than adding letters, writing tone requires on average only one additional letter for every three syllables of text.\n\nThe digraphs are not reliably featural; for example, the digraphs for the voiced stops do not all follow the same pattern. This is because Chao ran frequency tests, and used single letters for the most common consonants and vowels, while restricting digraphs and trigraphs to the more infrequent ones. Overall, syllables in the texts he transliterated averaged under 3½ letters apiece.\n\nAn example of Romanized General Chinese can be illustrated with Chao's name:\n\nAll the General Chinese initials here are voiced: The \"h\" in \"dh\" shows that this is a \"muddy\" consonant, and the \"q\" in \"qiuan\" represents an initial \"ng-\" (becoming \"g\" in Japanese). This voicing shows up in the Cantonese \"yang\" tones, which are represented by \"h\" in Yale romanization. \"Heavy\" codas, such as \"remm\", indicate the \"departing\" () tone, as in Gwoyeu Romatzyh. Similarly, the spelling \"ao\" in \"dhyao\" indicates the \"rising\" () tone, but because of the voiced initial, it merges with \"departing\" in Mandarin and literary Cantonese (though not in colloquial Cantonese). The \"y\" in \"dhyao\" indicates that the initial is a stop in Min, Japanese, and Vietnamese, but otherwise an affricate. Cantonese and Korean retain the final \"m\" of \"remm\". These pronunciations are all predictable given the General Chinese transcription, though it was not designed with the Sinospheric languages specifically in mind. Both the pre-war and post-war Japanese orthographies are recoverable.\n\nIn every control dialect, some syllables with different spellings will be pronounced the same. However, which these are differs from dialect to dialect. There are some irregular correlations: Often a particular variety will have a pronunciation for a syllable that is not what one would expect from other syllables with similar spellings, due to irregular developments in that variety. This is especially true with the voicing of Japanese consonants, which has evolved idiosyncratically in different compound words. However, except for Japanese voicing, the system is phonetic about 90% of the time.\n\nCharacter GC has a separate character for each syllable. However, romanized GC has distinct onsets and rhymes. The onsets are as follows:\n\n泥 and 娘 are both transcribed , as these are not distinct in modern dialects. 喻, a conflation of two older initials, 云 \"hy~hw\" and 以 \"y~w\", is transcribed or ∅ according to modern rather than ancient forms; when palatalization is lost, it is transcribed . The palatal and retroflex fricatives 照穿牀審禪 fell together early on in the rime tables of Classical Chinese, but are still distinguished in some modern dialects, and so are distinguished here. The convention for nasal 疑, which drops in many dialects, is repeated in the finals, where it represents with a departing tone.\n\nAlthough to some extent systematic—the retroflex series are digraphs ending in , for example—this is overridden in many cases by the principle of using short transcriptions for common sounds. Thus is used for 精 rather than for the less common 邪, where it might also be expected; is used for frequent 微 rather than for 奉; and and , for the high-frequency 見 and 羣, have the additional benefit of being familiar in their palatalized forms (Peking ~ Beijing for example is -) from English words like \"cello\" and \"gem.\"\n\nThe voiced obstruents (the 濁 \"muddy\" column) are only distinct in Wu dialects. In Min, they are collapsed with the consonants of the tenuis column. Elsewhere they are generally collapsed with the aspirated column in the even tone, and with the tenuis column in other tones. An exception is Cantonese, where in the rising tone they are aspirated in colloquial speech, but tenuis in reading pronunciations. The sonorants do not vary much apart from , , which in Wu are nasals colloquially but fricatives when read.\n\nVelars , , are palatalized to affricates before , (the high-front vowels ) apart from Min and Yue, where they remain stops before all vowels; , also palatalize, but remain fricatives. For instance in Mandarin, they are \"g, k, h\" before non-palatalizing vowels and \"j, q, x\" before palatalizing vowels, whereas in Cantonese they remain \"g, k, h\" everywhere. (Compare the alternate spellings of \"Beijing\" and \"Peking\"; see ) The alveolar sibilants , , , , (Mandarin \"z, c, s\") are also generally palatalized before , (to Mandarin \"j, q, x\"), collapsing with the palatalized velars , , , , in dialects which have lost the \"round-sharp\" distinction so important to Peking opera.\n\nThe palatal stops , , remain stops only in Min among the Chinese topolects (though also in Japanese and Vietnamese loan words); elsewhere they are conflated with the affricates. The palatal and retroflex sibilants are generally conflated; in Yue and Min, as well as in much of Wu and Mandarin, they are further conflated with the alveolar sibilants. This contrast remains in Beijing, where 'three' is distinct from 'mountain'; both are in Sichuanese and Taiwanese Mandarin.\n\nThere are numerous more sporadic correlations. For instance, the alveolar affricates , , become stops in Taishan Yue, whereas the alveolar stops are debuccalized to , as in \"Hoisaan\" for Cantonese \"Toisaan\" (Taishan). In Yüchi, Yunnan, it is the velars , , which are debuccalized, to . In the Min dialects, , become or . In Xi'an Mandarin, the fricatives , , , are rounded to before rounded vowels, as in 'water' (Beijing \"shuǐ\" ).\n\nThe categories of the Late Middle Chinese rime tables are reduced to the four medials of modern Chinese, plus an intermediate type :\n\n⟨i⟩ and ⟨iu⟩ are omitted after labiodental initials.\n\nThe medial is used for syllables which have a palatalizing medial in Mandarin, but no medial in Yue. That is, in Mandarin should be read as , with the same effect on consonants as has, whereas in Cantonese it is silent. In Shanghainese both situations occur: is equivalent to in reading pronunciations, as or , but is not found in colloquial speech.\n\nIn Cantonese, medial can be ignored after sibilants, as palatalization has been lost in these series. That is, \"siao, shao\" are read the same.\n\nChao uses the following rimes. They do not always correspond to the Middle Chinese rimes.\n\nRimes consist of a nucleus (the main vowel) and optionally a coda. They need to be considered as a unit because of a strong historical interaction between vowel and coda in Chinese dialects. The following combinations occur (note that the vowel is treated as medial plus nucleus ):\n\nThe most salient dialectal difference in rimes is perhaps the lack of the obstruent codas , , in most dialects of Mandarin and independently in the Wencheng dialect of Oujiang, though this has traditionally been seen as a loss of \"tone\" (see below). In Wu, Min (generally), New Xiang (Hunanese), Jin, and in the Lower Yangtze and Minjiang dialects of Mandarin, these codas conflate to glottal stop . In others, such as Gan, they are reduced to , while Yue dialects, Hakka, and Old Xiang maintain the original system.\n\nNasal codas are also reduced in many dialects. Mandarin and Wu do not distinguish between and , with them being reduced to or nasal vowels, or in some cases dropped altogether. In Shanghainese many instances of have conflated as well, or been dropped, but a phonemic distinction is maintained.\n\nIn Mandarin, an additional coda is found, \"-er\" , from GC .\n\nIn Cantonese, the simple vowels \"i u iu o a e\" are , apart from and after velars, which open to diphthongs, as in \"ci\" and \"ciu\" . Diphthongs may vary markedly depending on initial and medial, as in \"cau\" , \"ceau\" , \"ciau\" , though both \"ceu ~ cieu\" are , following the general pattern of before a coda (cf. \"cen\" vs \"can\" ). Cantonese does not have medials, apart from \"gw, kw\", though sometimes it is the nuclear vowel which drops: \"giung\" , \"xiong\" , but \"giuan\" .\n\nThe following combinations of orthographic medials and rimes occur, taking \"-iu\" to be medial \"i\" + rime \"u\" :\nDouble cells show discrepancies between analysis and orthography. For instance, Chao analyzes \"ieng, iueng\" as part of the \"aeng\" series rather than the \"eng\" series, and \"ien\" as part of the \"an\" series. Though not apparent from the chart, \"eng-ing-ueng-iuing\", \"ung-ong-iung-iong\", and \"en-in-un-iun\" are similar series. The discrepancies are due to an effort to keep frequent syllables short: \"en-in-un-iun\" rather than \"*en-ien-uen-iuen\", for example; as well as a reflection of some of the more widespread phonological changes in the rimes.\n\nThe Classical correspondences, with many archaic distinctions lost, are as follows:\n\nThese all occur in the velar-initial series, but not all in the others.\n\nIn Cantonese, after coronal stops and sibilants, rounded finals such as \"-on\" and \"-uan\" produce front rounded vowels, as in \"don\" , and after velars, \"iung\" and \"iong\" lose their . \nMin dialects are similar, but in certain tones and become diphthongs rather that their usual . For example, in Fuzhou, even-tone 星 \"sieng\" is but departing-tone 性 \"sieq\" is .\n\nIn Yunnan Mandarin, is pronounced as , so that the name of the province, \"yunnom\", is rather than as in Beijing.\n\nIn Nanking, metathesizes to after alveolars, as in 天 for Beijing \"tian\" .\n\nThe basic spelling is used for the even 平 tone(s). For the rising 上 tone(s), the nucleus is doubled (with the vowel → , as that is treated as medial + nucleus ), or the coda is changed to a 'lighter' letter. For the departing 去 tone(s), the coda is made 'heavier'; if there is no coda, add . For the entering 入 tone(s), a stop coda is used.\n\n'Lighter' means that a vowel coda is made more open ( → , → ); 'heavier' means that a vowel coda is made more close ( → , → ) and a nasal coda (, ) is doubled. The nasal is 'lightened' to (as in many Polynesian languages) and made heavier as (as in the GC initial):\n\nOne consequence of this is that the rimes \"-e\" and \"-ei\" in the even tone conflate to in the rising tone. However, since there are no such syllables which begin with the same consonant and medial, no syllables are actually conflated.\n\nThe difference between \"yin\" and \"yang\" tones is indicated by the voicing of the consonant. A zero consonant is treated as voiceless (it is sometimes reconstructed as a glottal stop), so \"i, iem, uon, iuan\" are \"ping yin\" (Mandarin \"yī, yān, wān, yuān\"), whereas \"yi, yem, won, yuan\" are \"ping yang\" (Mandarin \"yí, yán, wán, yuán\"). In a few cases, the effect that voiced , , , have on tone needs to be negated to achieve a \"ping yin\" tone. This is accomplished by spelling them , , , .\n\nTo mark the toneless Mandarin syllable \"ma\", a centered dot is used: . The dot is omitted for toneless , as tonic \"me, de, te, ne, le\" do not exist.\n\nThe realization of the tones in the various varieties of Chinese is generally predictable; see Four tones for details. In Beijing Mandarin, for example, even tone is split according to voicing, with muddy consonants becoming aspirates: \"ba, pa, ma, bha\" → \"bā, pā, má, pá\" (and \"mha\" → \"mā\"). Departing tone is not split, and muddy consonants become tenuis: \"bah, pah, mah, bhah\" → \"bà, pà, mà, bà.\" Rising tone splits, not along voicing, but with muddy-consonant syllables conflating with departing tone: \"baa, paa, maa, bhaa\" → \"bǎ, pǎ, mǎ, bà\". That is, \"bhaa\" and \"bhah\" are homonyms in Beijing, as indeed they are in all of Mandarin, in Wu apart from Wenzhounese, in Hakka, and in reading pronunciations of Cantonese. Entering tone is likewise split in Beijing: \"mat, bhat\" → \"mà, bá\".\n\nHowever, the realization of entering tones in Beijing dialect, and thus in Standard Chinese, is not predictable when a syllable has a voiceless initial such as \"bat\" or \"pat\". In such cases even syllables with the same GC spelling may have different tones in Beijing, though they remain homonyms in other Mandarin dialects, such as Xian and Sichuanese. This is due to historical dialect-mixing in the Chinese capital that resulted in unavoidably idiosyncratic correspondences.\n\nIn Yue, there is a straightforward split according to consonant voicing, with a postvocalic in Yale romanization for the latter. Muddy onsets become aspirates in even and rising tones, but tenuis in departing and entering tones: \"ba, pa, ma, bha\" → \"bā, pā, māh, pāh\"; \"baa, paa, maa, bhaa\" → \"bá, pá, máh, páh\"; \"bah, pah, mah, bhah\" → \"ba, pa, mah, bah\"; \"bat, pat, mat, bhat\" → \"baat, paat, maht, baht\". In addition, there is a split in entering tone according to vowel length, with Cantonese mid-entering tone for short vowels like \"bāt, pāt\". In reading pronunciations, however, rising tone syllables with muddy onsets are treated as departing tone: \"bhaa\" → \"bah\" rather than → \"páh\". There is also an unpredictable split in the even \"ping yin\" tone which indicates diminutives or a change in part of speech, but this is not written in all Cantonese romanizations (it is written in Yale, but not in Jyutping).\n\nChao provided this poem as an example. The character text is no different in GC and standard Chinese, apart from 裏 \"lǐ\", which in any case has now been substituted with Chao's choice of 里 on the Mainland. Note that simplified characters like this would affect all of Chao's proposal, so that 對 below would become 对, etc. The only other difference is 他 \"tā\" for 'her', which may differ from contemporary written Chinese 她, but which follows Classical usage. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "2278872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278872", "title": "Raimondo Montecuccoli", "text": "Raimondo Montecuccoli\n\nRaimondo, Count of Montecuccoli (; ; 21 February 1609 – 16 October 1680) was an Italian-born professional soldier who served the Habsburg Monarchy. He was also a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire and Duke of Melfi, in the Kingdom of Naples.\n\nMontecuccoli was considered as the only commander to be the equal of the French general Turenne, (1611–1675), and like him, was closely associated with the post-1648 development of linear infantry tactics.\n\nMontecuccoli was born on 21 February 1609 in the Castello di Montecuccolo in Pavullo nel Frignano, near Modena.\n\nAt the age of sixteen Montecuccoli began as a private soldier under his uncle, Count Ernest Montecuccoli (died 1633), a distinguished Austrian general. Four years later, after much active service in Germany and the Low Countries, he became a captain of infantry. He was severely wounded at the storming of New Brandenburg, and again in the same year (1631) at the first battle of Breitenfeld, where he fell into the hands of the Swedes.\n\nHe was again wounded at Lützen in 1632, and on his recovery was made a major in his uncle's regiment. Shortly afterwards he became a lieutenant-colonel of cavalry. He did good service at the first battle of Nordlingen (1634), and at the storming of Kaiserslautern in the following year won his colonelcy by a feat of arms of unusual brilliance, a charge through the breach at the head of his heavy cavalry.\n\nHe fought in Pomerania, Bohemia and Saxony (surprise of Wolmirstadt, battles of Wittstock and Chemnitz), and in 1639 he was taken prisoner at Melnik and detained for two and a half years in Stettin and Weimar. In captivity he studied military science, and also geometry by the way of Euclid, history of Tacitus, and Vitruvius' architecture, all the while planning his great work on war.\n\nReturning to Italy and to the field in 1642, Montecuccoli commanded mercenaries loyal to the Duke of his native Modena during the First War of Castro, but when that conflict ground to an unproductive stalemate he departed. His involvement, though understandable given his allegiance to Modena, was nonetheless unusual in that his service pitted him against the papal forces of Pope Urban VIII.\n\nIn 1643 he was promoted to lieutenant-field-marshal and obtained a seat in the Council of War. In 1645–46 he served in Hungary against Prince Rákóczy of Transylvania, on the Danube and Neckar against the French, and in Silesia and Bohemia against the Swedes. The victory of Triebel in Silesia won him the rank of \"General of Cavalry\", and at the battle of Zusmarshausen in 1648 his stubborn rearguard fighting rescued the imperials from annihilation.\n\nFor some years after the Peace of Westphalia Montecuccoli was chiefly concerned with the business of the council of war, though he went to Flanders and England as the representative of the emperor, and to Sweden as the envoy of the pope to Queen Christina, and at Modena his lance was victorious in a great tourney.\n\nIn 1657, soon after his marriage with Countess Margarethe de Dietrichstein, he was ordered by the Emperor to take part in the Habsburg expedition (as agreed between the King of Poland and the Emperor) against Prince Rákóczy, Charles X Gustav of Sweden and the Cossacks, who had already, in 1655, attacked the Kingdom of Poland in the war known in Poland as \"The Deluge\" or elsewhere as the \"Second Northern War\". During the conflict he was promoted to commanding officer of the division.\n\nHe became field-marshal in the imperial army and his division, along with Stefan Czarniecki's division, Frederick William's army and Danish forces, participated in the struggle in Denmark against the invading Swedes. Eventually the war ended with the Peace of Oliva in 1660 and Montecuccoli returned to his sovereign.\n\nFrom 1661 to 1664 Montecuccoli, with inferior numbers, defended Austria against the Turks but at St. Gotthard Abbey, on the Rába, he and Carl I. Ferdinand Count of Montenari defeated the Turks so comprehensively that they entered into a twenty-year truce. They were given the Order of the Golden Fleece, and Montecuccoli became president of the council of war and director of artillery. He also devoted much time to compiling his various works on military history and science. He opposed the progress of the French arms under Louis XIV, and when the inevitable war broke out he received command of the imperial forces. In the campaign of 1673 he completely outmanoeuvred his rival Turenne on the Neckar and the Rhine, captured Bonn and joined his army with that of William III, the prince of Orange on the lower Rhine.\n\nHe retired from the army when, in 1674, the Great Elector was named command in chief, but the brilliant successes of Turenne in the winter of 1674 and 1675 brought him back. For months the two famous commanders manoeuvred against each other in the Rhine valley, but on the eve of a decisive battle Turenne was killed and Montecuccoli promptly invaded Alsace, where he engaged in another war of manoeuvre with the Great Condé. The siege of Philippsburg was Montecuccoli's last achievement in war.\n\nThe rest of Montecuccoli's life was spent in military administration and literary and scientific work at Vienna. In 1679 the emperor made him a prince of the empire, and shortly afterwards he received the dukedom of Melfi from the King of Spain.\n\nMontecuccoli died in an accident at Linz in October 1680.\n\nAs a general, Montecuccoli shared with Turenne and Condé the first place among European soldiers of his time. For his success in halting the Turkish advance he had been hailed the savior of Europe. He was also influential as a military theorist, with perhaps his most famous quote being \"For war you need three things: 1. Money. 2. Money. 3. Money.\" His \"Memorie della guerra\" profoundly influenced the age which followed his own. \"Unequalled as a master of 17th-century warfare, Montecuccoli excelled in the art of fortification and siege, march and countermarch, and cutting his enemy’s lines of communications. In advocating standing armies, he clearly foresaw future trends in the military field\".\n\nIn 1657, Montecuccoli married Countess Margarethe de Dietrichstein. With the death of his only son Leopold Philip Montecuccoli in 1698 the principality became extinct, but the title of count descended through his daughters to two branches, Austrian and Modenese.\n\nThe \"Memorie della guerra\" was published at Venice in 1703 and at Cologne in 1704. A French edition was issued in Paris in 1712 and a Latin edition appeared in 1718 at Vienna, and the German \"Kriegsnachrichten des Fürsten Raymundi Montecuccoli\" was issued at Leipzig in 1736. Of this work there are manuscripts in various libraries, and many memoirs on military history, tactics, fortification, written in Italian, Latin and German, remain still unedited in the archives of Vienna. The collected \"Opere di Raimondo Montecuccoli\" were published at Milan (1807), Turin (1821) and Venice (1840), and include political essays and poetry.\n\nIn 1934 the Italian navy launched the \"Raimondo Montecuccoli\", a \"Condottieri \"class light cruiser named in his honour which served with the \"Regia Marina\" during World War II.\n\n\n"}

The original bridge is a lift bridge, which was required to allow shipping to pass to the State Timber Yard then located on the southern bank of the Parramatta River, just west of the bridge. However the lifting mechanism was removed in the late 20th century and it has not been opened since. The bridge was paid for by the Ryde Council with the assistance of a grant from the New South Wales Government. The bridge carried a toll for 13 years until the bridge was paid for. In 1948, ownership of the bridge was transferred to the NSW Department of Main Roads.\n\nA new bridge was built on the eastern or downstream side using steel trough girders, closed on top by a composite concrete running deck, and completed in 1987.

It was officially opened on 25 November 1988 by the Premier Nick Greiner and Federal Minister For Transport Ralph Willis.\n\nBefore the original bridge was constructed, the Parramatta River was crossed in this area by a vehicular punt, just downstream of the railway bridge.

{"id": "2278890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278890", "title": "Krzyzewskiville", "text": "Krzyzewskiville\n\nKrzyzewskiville, or K-ville for short, is a phenomenon that occurs before major men's basketball games at Duke University. In simplest terms, it is the line for undergraduate students wishing to gain access to the designated tenting games. It is often mistakenly referred to as a ticket line. However, there are no student tickets; students are admitted from the line an hour and a half before each game.\n\nKrzyzewskiville is named for Mike Krzyzewski, often called \"Coach K\", the much loved coach who has helped make Duke's basketball program one of the best in the nation. He has been known to buy pizza for the K-ville residents from time to time and has held open-forum \"team meetings\" with the Cameron Crazies before games against their arch-rival, the North Carolina Tar Heels.\n\nGraduate and professional students do not participate in Krzyzewskiville, as Duke's Graduate and Professional Student Council operates a separate weekend-long campout each September followed by a lottery for a small number of graduate and professional student season tickets.\n\nWhile lining up hours before games (the UNC game in particular) had always been a regular practice, every now and then a group of students would be ambitious enough to get their sleeping bags out and sleep in line the night before in order to ensure their front row seats. In 1986 Kimberly Reed, a resident of the Mirecourt selective living group, took the practice one step further and decided with a group of her Mirecourt friends to line up even earlier for the UNC game and sleep in tents. Showing up on Thursday for the Saturday tip-off, the fifteen friends set up four tents and prepared to sleep outside of Cameron Indoor. They were quickly noticed by the rest of the student body, and by game time there were 75 tents in line to see Duke battle their long-standing rival UNC. The NBC news crew put them on the evening news, and they made the front page of USA Today. Their dedication was rewarded with an 85-72 Duke victory, and tenting in K-ville quickly became a Duke University tradition.\n\nThe number of tenting games in a single season is determined by the Line Monitor Committee of the Duke Student Government. Tents are sometimes allowed for big games like the ACC-Big 10 challenge, but the rules for UNC game tenting only apply to that game. Three to eight weeks before the actual game, students begin to put up and live in tents outside Cameron Indoor Stadium. As many as twelve people can occupy a specific tent group. As regulated by Duke Student Government, there must be a certain number of students in the tent at regular, periodic checks.\n\nThe tenting season is divided into three sections. From the beginning of tenting in early January for the first third of the season, tents of 12 must have 2 people in the tent during the day and 10 people each night. For the next third of the season, tents must have 1 person in the tent during the day and 6 people each night. For the final third, before the game, tents still must have 1 person during the day but only 2 people each night. The two weekend nights prior to the game, or the weekend before the game, are personal check nights, during which each of the twelve tent members must be at the tent for 3 of 5 personal checks spread over the two nights. If a tent misses a tent check twice, it gets moved to the end of the line (assuming availability). If K-ville is at full capacity (100 tents) and a waitlist exists at the time of the second miss, the tent gets removed completely.\n\nTents must register with the line monitors (students in charge of overseeing and enforcing K-ville rules and regulations) prior to setting up. There are three types: Black registration, which is the longest and most intense option in which the use of actual tents was forbidden in the past. All 12 tenters used to sleep in K-ville during black tenting. Today, however, pre-fabricated tents are required throughout the tenting season and only 10 people must sleep in the tent. Black tenting groups participate in attendance events and trivia that determine their order in line. A tent that starts after the beginning of black tenting but during the period when 10 members are required to be in the tent at night is referred to as a \"dirty black tent.\" Blue registration is the next period, in which a tent can register at any time before approximately two weeks prior to the game; after this, white registration goes into effect, which is significantly more complicated. A tent that does not start on the first day of blue tenting is typically referred to as a \"dirty blue tent.\" \n\nFor blue registration, a tent group need only give their names to the line monitors and start tenting. However, for white registration, students must participate in the Race to the Secret Spots, where they meet the line monitors at locations on campus that are disclosed on a website and social media at a specified time; this results in a hectic dash to the locations once they are made public. The locations are given in riddle form, making it more difficult to identify the spot, even once the clues are made public. Most tenting groups station members around campus, and identify which members are closest to the spots once they are disclosed online. Hundreds of tent representatives usually appear at the White registration locations for the 30 remaining spots not taken by Black and Blue tenters, with the spots filling up in a matter of minutes. The 31st to 60th groups to complete the Race to the Secret Spots will receive flex tenting spots, where they are required to follow the rules of white tenting but are not guaranteed tickets. Flex tenting was preceded by the walk-up line, which formed 48 hours before tipoff. It consisted of couples, and one member of each couple was required to be in line at all times. People in the walk-up line were not guaranteed to get into the game; people who had waited more than 24 hours sometimes did not get in. The rigor and uncertainty of the walk-up line agitated students, which caused a riot before the 2018 UNC game . Flex tenting began in 2019.\n\nK-ville is also a social function at Duke, as many students participate at least once. Duke has installed Wi-Fi service and Ethernet ports in the lightposts so that students can participate in tenting without falling behind in their schoolwork, although the internet is known to be very unreliable. Students also complain that the cold weather also prevents them from getting any real work done.\n\nHeaters are not permitted in K-ville; students must keep warm by simply using sleeping bags and dressing appropriately.\n\nIn December 2006, the Duke Student Government banned Robertson Scholars from UNC (who attend Duke for one semester) from participating in tenting for the game versus UNC, although they can still get in via the walk-up line. Some feel this is a violation of the Robertson Scholars Program, which states that \"they have full student privileges at both Duke and UNC-Chapel Hill. This includes access to courses; faculty and research opportunities; and arts, cultural, and sporting events.\" That tenting season, some Robertsons tented with some full-time Duke students, using their Duke ID cards to get into the game. However, once inside the student section the Robertson attendees removed Duke attire worn into the game to reveal UNC paraphernalia. To prevent this situation from happening again, Robertson Scholars visiting from UNC were banned from tenting in K-ville, starting in 2006.\n\nIn January 2017, over 150 tent groups registered for black and blue tenting, exceeding the 70 tent cap. This was the first time in the history of K-ville that the 70 tent cap reserved for black and blue tenters was exceeded. The line monitors created a preliminary trivia test based on the current men's basketball season as a way to select the lucky 70 tents that would be allowed to tent. The tenting starting date was pushed back from Wednesday, January 11 to Thursday January 12 to accommodate the testing period. If a tent group did not make the top 70 they would be placed on a wait list in the order of their scores. If a tent among the first 70 dropped or got bumped, the next group on the waitlist would move up and become a blue tent. Tenting has become such an integral part of the undergraduate experience at Duke that many of the most notable tents in K-ville are passed down within student groups from year to year. Many of tents are named and elaborately decorated, and some of which were documented in a 2015/2016 video series published by the University called \"K-Ville Kribs.\" . The oldest tent in K-ville, nicknamed \"Das Boot\", has been one of the most prominent tents in Krzyzewskiville since 2013. .\n\nOver the past few years, current players on the Duke Men's Basketball team have begun to show a greater involvement with and appreciation of the tenters in K-Ville. For the 2013-14 season, Jabari Parker made homemade dessert bars, dubbed \"Jabari Bars,\" and passed them out to tenters, and Andre Dawkins gave out fruit snacks to tenters on a different occasion. During the 2014-15 season, Marshall Plumlee gave tours of the most notable tents in K-Ville and interviewed tents' members in a mini video series called \"K-Ville Kribs.\" In his last year on the Duke Men's Basketball team (2016–17) Amile Jefferson oversaw a half-court tournament played by current tenters, where the winning tent group got to be the first group for the final game of the season (Duke vs. Florida State University).\n\n"}
{"id": "2278891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278891", "title": "Speed (card game)", "text": "Speed (card game)\n\nSpeed is a game for two players or more of the family of card games, in which each player tries to get rid of all of his or her cards first.\n\nEach player is dealt five cards to form a hand, and each player is dealt 15 cards face down to form a draw pile. If playing with jokers, they are used as wild cards and give each draw pile 16 cards. Two cards are placed in between the players, face-down. Two piles of five cards are placed beside them, face down.\n\nThe round begins when the players each flip one of the face-down cards in the center simultaneously. Using cards from their own hand, the players must then discard their cards one by one, using only one hand, matching cards so that each card played is either a meany, one number above, one number below, or the same number as the two cards on top of the center stacks. This must be done without hesitating to shuffle cards or otherwise delay the game. Only one card can be placed at a time. Ace is both a high and low card, considered one value above a King as well as one below a Two, so that the cards form a looping sequence. Whenever the number of cards in a player's hands drops below five, he or she has to draw out of their respective pile back up to five cards until that player's draw pile is depleted. When both players run out of options for play they simultaneously flip a card from the side piles onto the top of the central piles. If these piles become depleted, the central stacks are shuffled individually and are placed face-down as new side piles from which cards can be flipped.\n\nA player wins by running out of cards in their hand and draw pile before the other player. The player with no cards in their hand must say Speed and hit and on the table in order for the other player to officially lose. Speed is typically played in a two-wins-out-of-three win. If a player has a card to place it must be placed.\n\nAll cards will end up on the table and out of hands of the players if there are no mistakes.\n\nSpeed can be played with jokers as wild cards. For example, if there is a 2 in the center, a joker can be used as a 3, an ace, or, in Doubles rules, a 2. When a joker is played, then anything can be played on that joker. In any other case, a joker can also be whatever a player wants it to be. It is often prudent to save a joker in one's hand for when one is otherwise out of options or for when it would act as a missing link for a long string of moves. This is cheating if both players flip the outside cards onto the center. Players are only allowed to flip once they cannot play anything else, and because the joker is a wild card, it can be played. A joker cannot be the last card a player puts down, because jokers cannot \"top\" the deck. Once a joker is placed, the player that is quick enough to put down the next card claims that joker. \n\nWhen the player runs out of cards they slap the table or hit both stacks and say \"Speed!\" to officially win. If a player fails to do whatever has been agreed on beforehand, he must take one of the central stacks as their draw pile and resume playing.\n\nAs a variation, sometimes the rules state that once either player runs out of cards, both players are eligible to hit the stack and say \"Speed!\" and whichever does it first is the winner. This still highly favors whoever runs out of cards first.\n\nSpeed can be played with more than just two people. With three players, it is often unnecessary to have extra cards; cards are dealt by giving each player their five 'side pile' cards, placing three cards face down in the centre, and dealing the extra cards evenly as draw piles. With four players, it is often more interesting to use two decks of cards shuffled together. This is the case for quicker or more experienced players; with new, slow or young players, it is often appropriate to use only one deck, as this slows the game considerably. It is, of course, possible to have more than four players in a single game, but the playing field quickly becomes confusing and muddled simply because of the distance and amount of action.\n\nAlso known as Super-spit in Wisconsin, Spit 2 in Texas, Rush in Missouri, and Spit 3 in Kentucky, and Blackie Spit in British Columbia. California Spit is a fast paced shedding card game that has the added bonus of shuffling the deck.\n\nThe two players sit at opposite sides of a vertical playing surface. The dealer deals half of the cards to each player. The cards are held face down. Every round, each player plays five cards face up vertically in between both players and slightly closer to themselves. Once both players have done this, they look for two or more cards having the same number. When a player finds one, he places another card on top of the cards with that number until all of the cards with the common number are covered. In other words, if there are three fours out then all three cards can get a new card on top of it. If a four is played on top of a four it is called a double, and the player may place a third card on top of it. This requires that players pay attention to the cards they are laying down on the pile. If a player runs out of cards then that player wins. When there are no more groups of cards remaining, each player scoops up the four piles directly in front of him or her and places them face down on the bottom of their deck. That round ends and the next begins.\n\nSpit is a similar game in which two players simultaneously put down cards in ascending or descending order, until all of one player's cards are gone. In Speed each player holds up to five cards in their hand, and has one stock pile, face down. Two cards can be put down at once. You can not put down more than 2 at once. In Spit each player has a row of stock piles, usually five, with the top card face up, so all cards in play are visible to both players.\n\nSpeed:\nSpit:\nIn both games each player is dealt a set of 10 \"Spit Cards\", face down, and one card, face down, in their \"Spit Pile\". (See middle row of the diagrams).\n\nIn Speed each player is also dealt 10 cards in a \"Stock Pile\", and a Hand of 5 cards.\n\nIn Split each player lays out 15 cards in a \"tableau\" of 5 Stock Piles, with the topmost card of each pile turned up.\n\nThe game starts with each player simultaneously turning over the card in their Spit Pile.\n\nSubsequent played cards are placed face up on either of these Spit Piles, in ascending or descending order (with aces fitting next to both kings and twos).\n\nIn Speed cards are played from the hand, which is replenished from the player's stock pile.\n\nIn Spit the visible cards are played, and the card under it is then turned up. If a stock pile position is empty then a card can be moved from any other stock pile, whose next card is turned face up.\n\nIf neither player can move, then each turns over a Split Card onto their Spit Pile and the game restarts. If a player runs out of Spit Cards then the top card in their Spit Pile is left on the table, and the rest are shuffled and used as Spit Cards.\n\nThe game is won by the first player to get rid of their stock cards (and, in Speed, their hand).\n\nStrategy in Speed is limited by the fact that players must attempt to play everything they have in their hands, but there are many tricks that can help slow an opponent or speed the process of getting rid of cards. For example, it is usually prudent to arrange cards of adjacent rank together, but it is better to have cards in the order in which they can be played. This is often a consideration to be taken at the beginning of the game, since it is often too time-consuming during play. For example, if dealt cards of ranks 4, 5, 5, 6 and 6, it is best to order them 4, 5, 6, 5, 6 rather than in standard ascending numerical order.\n\nIf by any means it is revealed which cards are in an opponent's hand, it is often possible to 'block' the opponent from playing by not leading up to a point at which his card could be played. Each card in the game must be played individually, this may be a disadvantage to some, however can prove to be advantageous. For example, if a player knows that their opponent has a King, and the card showing is a Jack, it is better for them to play a ten than a Queen, since the Queen would allow the opponent to play. If both options are available, it is best to \"explore\" the former, by playing a card, then drawing back up to five to see if more moves can be made. On the other hand, it is sometimes advisable for a player to feed an opponent opportunities, if they will result in the value on the deck moving towards a large run in the player's own hand. This is often the case when a hand contains multiple cards of the same number. A player cannot play a ten if there is a king on a deck.\n\nIt is common to attempt to distract an opponent by making conversation or announcing one's moves aloud as they are made.\n\n"}

{"id": "2278897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278897", "title": "Francis Danby", "text": "Francis Danby\n\nFrancis Danby (16 November 1793 – 9 February 1861) was an Irish painter of the Romantic era. His imaginative, dramatic landscapes were comparable to those of John Martin. Danby initially developed his imaginative style while he was the central figure in a group of artists who have come to be known as the Bristol School. His period of greatest success was in London in the 1820s.\n\nBorn in the south-east of Ireland, he was one of a set of twins; his father, James Danby, farmed a small property he owned near Wexford, but his death, in 1807, caused the family to move to Dublin, while Francis was still a schoolboy. He began to practice drawing at the Royal Dublin Society's schools; and under an erratic young artist named James Arthur O'Connor he began painting landscapes. Danby also made acquaintance with George Petrie.\n\nIn 1813 Danby left for London together with O'Connor and Petrie. This expedition, undertaken with very inadequate funds, quickly came to an end, and they had to get home again by walking. At Bristol they made a pause, and Danby, finding he could get trifling sums for watercolours, remained there working diligently and sending to the London exhibitions pictures of importance. There his large oil paintings quickly attracted attention.\n\nFrom around 1818/19, Danby was a member of the informal group of artists which has become known as the Bristol School, taking part in their evening sketching meetings and sketching excursions visiting local scenery. His \"View of the Avon Gorge\" (1822) depicts figures sketching in a location favoured by the group. He remained connected with members of the Bristol School for around a decade, even after leaving Bristol in 1824.\n\nThe group had initially formed around Edward Bird, and Danby would eventually succeed Bird as its central figure. Bird's genre painting had a naturalistic style and fresh colours, and his influence has been seen on Danby's style. Examples are Danby's treatment of figures in \"Boys Sailing a Little Boat\" (c. 1821) and \"The Delivery of Israel out of Egypt\" (1825). Danby was also close to Edward Villiers Rippingille, whose style developed alongside that of Danby under the influence of Bird.\n\nThe Bristol artists, particularly the amateur Francis Gold, were also important in influencing Danby towards a more imaginative and poetical style. George Cumberland, another of the amateurs, had influential London connections. In 1820 when Francis Danby exhibited \"The Upas Tree of Java\" at the British Institution, Cumberland used his influence to promote its favourable reception. There is also evidence from their correspondence that Cumberland suggested subjects for Danby to paint. Cumberland was a close friend of William Blake, and it has been suggested that Blake's work may also have had some influence on Danby, for example in Danby's second exhibited painting, \"Disappointed Love\", shown at the Royal Academy in 1821.\nDanby's atmospheric work \"An Enchanted Island\", successfully exhibited in 1825 at the British Institution and then back in Bristol at the Bristol Institution, was in turn particularly influential on other Bristol School artists. Letitia Elizabeth Landon included a poem on this work in \"Poetical Sketches of Modern Pictures\" in her collection, The Troubadour (1826).\n\n\"The Upas Tree\" (1820) and \"The Delivery of Israel\" (1825) brought him his election as an Associate Member of the Royal Academy. He left Bristol for London, and in 1828 exhibited his \"Opening of the Sixth Seal\" at the British Institution, receiving from that body a prize of 200 guineas; and this picture was followed by two others on the theme of the Apocalypse.\n\nDanby painted \"vast illusionist canvases\" comparable to those of John Martin – of \"grand, gloomy and fantastic subjects which chimed exactly with the Byronic taste of the 1820s.\"\n\nDanby was sculpted by Christopher Moore in 1828.\n\nIn 1829 Danby's wife deserted him, running off with the painter Paul Falconer Poole. Danby left London, declaring that he would never live there again, and that the Academy, instead of aiding him, had, somehow or other, used him badly. For a decade he lived on the Lake of Geneva in Switzerland, becoming a Bohemian with boat-building fancies, painting only now and then. He later moved to Paris for a short period of time.\n\nHe returned to England in 1840, when his sons, James and Thomas, both artists, were growing up. Danby exhibited his large (15 feet wide) and powerful \"The Deluge\" that year; the success of that painting, \"the largest and most dramatic of all his Martinesque visions,\" revitalised his reputation and career. Other pictures by him were \"The Golden Age\" (c. 1827, exhibited 1831), \"Rich and Rare Were the Gems She Wore\" (1837), and \"The Evening Gun\" (1848).\n\nSome of Danby's later paintings, like \"The Woodnymph's Hymn to the Rising Sun\" (1845), tended toward a calmer, more restrained, more cheerful manner than those in his earlier style; but he returned to his early mode for \"The Shipwreck\" (1859). He lived his final years at Exmouth in Devon, where he died in 1861. Along with John Martin and J. M. W. Turner, Danby is considered among the leading British artists of the Romantic period.\n\nBoth of Danby's sons were landscape painters. The elder, James Francis Danby (1816–75), exhibited at the Royal Academy. \"He excelled in depicting sunrise and sunset.\" The younger, Thomas Danby (1817–86), specialised in watercolours of Welsh scenes. In 1866, the latter was nominated as an Associate of the Royal Academy, but missed election by one vote.\n\n\n"}

The Roland was also purchased by the U.S. Army as one of very few foreign SAM systems.\n\nRoland was designed to a joint French and German requirement for a low-level mobile missile system to protect mobile field formations and fixed, high-value targets such as airfields. Development began in 1963 as a study by Nord Aviation of France and Bölkow of Germany with the system then called SABA in France and P-250 in Germany. The two companies formed a joint development project in 1964 and later (as Aérospatiale of France and MBB of Germany) founded the Euromissile company for this and other missile programs. Aerospatiale took primary responsibility for the Roland 1 day/clear-weather system while MBB took primary responsibility for the Roland 2 all-weather system. Aerospatiale was also responsible for the rear and propulsion system of the missile while MBB developed the front end of the missile with warhead and guidance systems. The first guided launch of a Roland prototype took place in June 1968, destroying a CT-20 target drone and fielding of production systems was expected from January 1970. The test and evaluation phase took much longer than originally anticipated with the clear-weather Roland I finally entering operational service with the French Army in April 1977, while the all-weather Roland II was first fielded by the German Army in 1978 followed by the French Army in 1981. The long delays and ever-increasing costs combined with inflation meant Roland was never procured in the numbers originally anticipated.\n\nThe Roland SAM system was designed to engage enemy air targets flying at speeds of up to Mach 1.3 at altitudes between 20 meters and 5,500 meters with a minimum effective range of 500 meters and a maximum of 6,300 meters. The system can operate in optical or radar mode and can switch between these modes during an engagement. A pulse-doppler search radar with a range of 15–18 km detects the target which can then be tracked either by the tracking radar or an optical tracker. The optical channel would normally be employed only in daylight against very low-level targets or in a heavy jamming environment.\n\nThe Roland missile is a two-stage solid propellant unit 2.4 meters long with a weight of 66.5 kg including the 6.5 kg multiple hollow-charge fragmentation warhead which contains 3.5 kg of explosive detonated by impact or proximity fuses. The 65 projectile charges have a lethal radius of 6 meters. Cruising speed is Mach 1.6. The missile is delivered in a sealed container which is also the launch tube. Each launcher carries two launch tubes with 8 more inside the vehicle or shelter with automatic reloading in 10 seconds.\n\nFor defense of fixed sites such as airfields the shelter Roland can be integrated in the CORAD (Co-ordinated Roland Air Defense) system which can include a surveillance radar, a Roland Co-ordination Center, 8 Roland fire units and up to 8 guns.\n\n\n\nCurrent systems are capable of launching Roland 2, Roland 3 or VT1 missiles. Roland's latest upgraded versions have limited ability to counter incoming low RCS munitions (large-caliber heavyweight rockets).\n\nThe Roland system has been installed on a variety of platforms, amongst them:\n\n\nRoland 2 was proposed in the early 1980s for installation on the Leopard 1 tank chassis, probably to meet an expected Dutch army requirement but was never built. In configuration it would have been very similar to the AMX-30R.\n\nAmerican Roland on the M109 chassis was built in prototype form but production systems were rather hastily installed on 6×6 flatbed trucks. In the late 1980s there was an attempt to revive the American Roland program with the Paladin submission to the U.S. Army's \"LOS-F-H\" (\"L\"ine \"O\"f \"S\"ight - \"F\"orward - \"H\"eavy) battlefield air defense program. This new version of the American Roland system would have used the existing XM975 vehicle for testing & evaluation purposes, with production systems being fitted on a new modified M2 Bradley chassis.\n\nAn airliftable shelter named Roland CAROL has also been developed, which is a 7.8t container that can be deployed on the ground to protect fixed assets like airfields or depots or fitted on an ACMAT truck.\n\n\n\nOn 1 June 1982, during the Falklands War, Sea Harrier nº XZ456 was shot down south of Stanley by members of the GADA 601, an Argentine antiaircraft unit deployed in the area. The launcher, one of four examples delivered to Argentina, was captured in fairly intact condition by the British around Port Stanley after the surrender. It was taken back to Britain as a valuable prize and studied in detail. It is believed that an Iraqi Roland missile succeeded in shooting down an American A-10 Thunderbolt II at the beginning of the Iraq War, during the battle of Baghdad.\n\nIn October 2003, controversy erupted between Poland and France when Polish forces from the Multinational force in Iraq found four French Roland surface-to-air missiles. Polish and international press reported that Polish officers claimed these missiles had been manufactured in 2003. France pointed out that it had never sold weapons to Iraq after July 1990 in violation of the embargo. Polish authorities would later remark that the four missiles were manufactured in 1984, and that the 2003 date was the last time when Iraqi personnel had serviced them. Investigations by the Polish authorities came to the conclusion that the persons responsible for the scandal were low level commanders. Wojskowe Służby Informacyjne, the Polish Army's intelligence unit, had not verified their claims before they were leaked to the press. Poland apologized to France for the scandal, but these allegations against France worsened the already somewhat strained relationships between the two countries. The entire incident was sarcastically called \"Rolandgate\" by the Polish media, using the unofficial naming conventions of US political scandals after Watergate.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2278914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278914", "title": "Uniform access principle", "text": "Uniform access principle\n\nThe uniform access principle of computer programming was put forth by Bertrand Meyer (originally in \"Object-Oriented Software Construction\"). It states \"All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage or through computation\". This principle applies generally to the syntax of object-oriented programming languages. In simpler form, it states that there should be no syntactical difference between working with an attribute, pre-computed property, or method/query of an object.\n\nWhile most examples focus on the \"read\" aspect of the principle (i.e., retrieving a value), Meyer shows that the \"write\" implications (i.e., modifying a value) of the principle are harder to deal with in his monthly column on the Eiffel programming language official website.\n\nThe problem being addressed by Meyer involves the maintenance of large software projects or software libraries. Sometimes when developing or maintaining software it is necessary, after much code is in place, to change a class or object in a way that transforms what was simply an attribute access into a method call. Programming languages often use different syntax for attribute access and invoking a method, (e.g., versus ). The syntax change would require, in popular programming languages of the day, changing the source code in all the places where the attribute was used. This might require changing source code in many different locations throughout a very large volume of source code. Or worse, if the change is in an object library used by hundreds of customers, each of those customers would have to find and change all the places the attribute was used in their own code and recompile their programs.\n\nGoing the reverse way (from method to simple attribute) really was not a problem, as one can always just keep the function and have it simply return the attribute value.\n\nMeyer recognized the need for software developers to write code in such a way as to minimize or eliminate cascading changes in code that result from changes which convert an object attribute to a method call or vice versa. For this he developed the Uniform Access Principle.\n\nMany programming languages do not strictly support the UAP but do support forms of it. Properties, which are provided in a number of programming languages, address the problem Meyer was addressing with his UAP in a different way. Instead of providing a single uniform notation, properties provide a way to invoke a method of an object while using the same notation as is used for attribute access. The separate method invocation syntax is still available.\n\nIf the language uses the method invocation syntax it may look something like this.\n\nWhen executed, should display :\n\nWhether or not invokes a function or simply sets an attribute is hidden from the caller.\nLikewise whether simply retrieves the value of the attribute, or invokes a function\nto compute the value returned, is an implementation detail hidden from the caller.\n\nIf the language uses the attribute syntax the syntax may look like this.\n\nAgain, whether or not a method is invoked, or the value is simply assigned to an attribute is hidden\nfrom the calling method.\n\nHowever, UAP itself can lead to problems, if used in places where the differences between access methods are \"not\" negligible, such as when the returned value is expensive to compute or will trigger cache operations.\n\nConsider the following\n\ny = Egg.new( \"Green\")\ny.color = \"White\" \nputs y.color\n\nNow the Egg class could be defined as follows\n\nclass Egg\nend\n\nThe above initial code segment would work fine with the Egg being defined as such. The Egg\nclass could also be defined as below, where color is instead a method. The calling code would\nstill work, unchanged if Egg were to be defined as follows.\n\nclass Egg\n\nend\nNote how even though codice_1 looks like an attribute in one case and a pair of methods\nin the next, the interface to the class remains the same. The person maintaining the Egg class can switch from one form to the other without fear of breaking any caller's code.\nRuby follows the revised UAP, the codice_2 only acts as syntactic sugar for generating accessor/setter methods for codice_1. There is no way in Ruby to retrieve an instance variable from an object without calling a method on it.\n\nStrictly speaking, Ruby does not follow Meyer's original UAP in that the syntax for accessing an attribute is different from the syntax for invoking a method. But here, the access for an attribute will always actually be through a function which is often automatically generated. So in essence, either type of access invokes a function and the language does follow Meyer's revised Uniform Access Principle.\n\nPython properties may be used to allow a method\nto be invoked with the same syntax as accessing an attribute. Whereas Meyer's UAP would have\na single notation for both attribute access and method invocation (method invocation syntax), \na language with support for properties still supports separate notations for attribute\nand method access. Properties allow the attribute notation to be used, but to hide the\nfact that a method is being invoked instead of simply retrieving or setting a value. \n\nAs such, Python leaves the option of adherence to UAP up to the individual programmer. The built-in function provides a simple way to decorate any given method in attribute access syntax, thus abstracting away the syntactical difference between method invocations and attribute accesses.\n\nIn Python, we may have code that access an object that could be defined such that weight and color are simple attributes as in the following \n»> egg = Egg(4.0, \"white\")\n»> egg.color = \"green\"\n»> print(egg)\nEgg(4.0, green)\nclass Egg:\n\nOr the Egg object could use properties, and invoke getter and setter methods instead\n\nclass Egg:\n\nRegardless of which way is defined, the calling code can remain the same. The implementation of can switch from one form to the other without affecting code that uses the Egg class. Languages which implement the UAP have this property as well.\n\nThe C# language supports class \"properties\", which provide a means to define and operations (\"getters\" and \"setters\") for a member variable. The syntax to access or modify the property is the same as accessing any other class member variable, but the actual implementation for doing so can be defined as either a simple read/write access or as functional code.\n\npublic class Foo\n\nIn the example above, class contains two properties, and . The property is an integer that can be read (get) and written (set). Similarly, the property is a string that can also be read and modified, but its value is stored in a separate (private) class variable .\n\nOmitting the operation in a property definition makes the property read-only, while omitting the operation makes it write-only.\n\nUse of the properties employs the UAP, as shown in the code below.\n\nC++ has neither the UAP nor properties, when an object is changed such that an attribute (color) becomes a pair of functions (). Any place in that uses an instance of the object and either sets or gets the attribute value ( or ) must be changed to invoke one of the functions. ( or ). Using templates and operator overloading, it is possible to fake properties, but this is more complex than in languages which directly support properties. This complicates maintenance of C++ programs. Distributed libraries of C++ objects must be careful about how they provide access to member data.\n\nJavaScript has had support for computed properties since 2009.\n\nIn Next Generation Shell, accessing object fields is done through the codice_4 syntax, similar to other programming languages. Consistent with the rest of the language, the syntax is a shortcut for invoking a method. codice_5 is interpreted as a call to method codice_4 with arguments codice_7 and codice_8.\n\nThe built-in implementation of codice_4 returns the value of the field from the memory location dedicated exclusively to the given field of the specific object instance. To customize the behaviour of codice_4 for a particular type, one should define a method named codice_4 for that type.\n\nSimilarly, codice_12 method is called for codice_13 syntax.\n\nThe following example demonstrates default behavior of the codice_4 and codice_12 methods.\n\ntype Egg\n\nF init(e:Egg, color:Str) {\n\ne = Egg(\"Green\")\ne.color = \"White\"\necho(e.color)\nThe following example demonstrates customized behavior of the codice_4 and codice_12 methods. The code implements accessor for the codice_1 field.\n\ntype Egg\n\nF init(e:Egg, color:Str) {\n\nF .(e:Egg, field:Str) {\n\nF .=(e:Egg, field:Str, value:Str) {\n\ne = Egg(\"Green\")\ne.color = \"White\"\necho(e.color)\n"}

He later joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1925 and was sent to study at Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow, from 1926 to 1930. He was a member of the group known as the 28 Bolsheviks, but switched to supporting Mao Zedong during the Long March. He was General Secretary of the Communist Party of China from 1935 to 1943, when the post was abolished. He remained a member of the Politburo, but ranked 12th of 13 in the 7th Politburo and reduced to Alternate Member in the 8th Politburo.\n\nHe was First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China from December 1954 to November 1960. He was a participant of the Long March, and later served as an ambassador to the Soviet Union from April 1951 to January 1955. At the Lushan Conference in 1959 he supported Peng Dehuai and lost power along with Peng. During the Cultural Revolution he was attacked as an ally of Peng and Liu Shaoqi; he was rehabilitated by Deng Xiaoping after Mao's death.\n\nOn August 30, 1900, Zhang Wentian was born in Deng San Village, Nanhui, Jiangsu Province. Zhang's ancestors migrated to Pudong from Qinghe County to avoid the war. His grandfather Zhang Xiangfu and father Zhang Qimei were farmers, and his mother Jin Tianhua had attended a private school. Zhang Wentian was the eldest son of the family. In 1915, he was admitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries School (Wusong Fisheries School). After studying for two years, he decided to transfer because he could not physically get used to the studying environment there. In 1917, he entered Nanjing Hohai Engineering College. At this point, Zhang Wentian became exposed to the New Youth, and started to lean toward the idea of revolution.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the May Fourth Movement in 1919, Zhang Wentian participated in student movements and began to engage himself in literary creation and translation. In July 1920, Zhang Wentian and his classmate Shen Zemin went to study in Japan. They studied Japanese, philosophy and other texts in social sciences. In January 1921, Zhang Wentian returned to China, and became an editor for Zhonghua Book Company, working with colleagues Zuo Shunsheng, Tian Han, Li Da, He Shuheng. On January 5, 1922, Zhang Wentian published \"China's Source of Chaos and Its Solution(中国底乱源及其解决)\". The article stated: \"We are so uneasy about this unreasonable society, but what methods should we use to transform it? What should it be transformed into? Nonresistance? Resistance? Anarchism? Socialism? Like the water flowing in the river, it constantly troubles me. However, life cannot continue without a decision. Then, naturally we cannot but go down the socialist road.” In August, Zhang Wentian went to study in University of California, Berkeley at his own expense. He took several courses, but was not formally enrolled.\n\nZhang Wentian returned home in January 1924, continuing his work as an editor for to Zhonghua Book Company. In October 1924, Zhang Wentian received an invitation from the Juvenile Chinese Society Chengdu branch and took up the job as an English teacher at the Second Chongqing Women's Normal School with colleagues Xiao Chunü and Yang Angong. In May 1925, Zhang Wentian left Sichuan and returned to Shanghai with Xiao Chunü to propagate revolutionary ideas. In June, Zhang Wentian was introduced by Shen Zemin and Dong Yixiang to join the Communist Party of China. He went to Moscow to study at Sun Yat-sen University in October.\n\nWhile Zhang was studying and teaching in Moscow between 1925 and 1930, Nikolai Bukharin was still in power. Zhang learned about Bukarin's theory of allowing private rural economy through supply and marketing cooperatives, and this would later deeply influence Zhang's own policy perspectives. Zhang was much respected in the CCP circle for his thorough knowledge of Bukharin, in addition to Marxism and Leninism.\n\nIn early 1928, some members of the Chinese Communist Party branch at Sun Yat-sen University were dissatisfied with the work of the school branch office. The school branch office ignored the leadership of the party and sought to restructure the Communist Party branch. The power struggle between the two factions in Moscow reached its peak in the summer of 1928, and a ten-day meeting was held to discuss the workings of the school office. The secretary of the Soviet Communist Party Committee supported the school branch office. Despite the opposition from majority of students, under the support of minority factions including Bo Gu and others, the vote was passed to support the school branch office. After the meeting, the proud supporters of the school branch office were given the nickname\" 28 Bolsheviks” by the oppositional faction, and Zhang Wentian was one of them.\n\nOn May 19th 1930, Zhang Wentian published \"On the Two Lines of Struggle.\" The article pointed out that the Communist Party not only needs to oppose the right-wing within the party, but also needs to oppose the left-wing inside the party. This article was considered to be directed against Li Lisan and his extremism which later came to be known as \"Li Lisan line\".\n\nIn February 1931, Zhang Wentian returned to Shanghai, and soon served as the Minister of Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee. In September of the same year, the provisional central political bureau was established by Bo Gu, Zhang Wentian, Lu Futan, Li Zhusheng, Kang Sheng, Chen Yun, Huang Ping, Liu Shaoqi, Wang Yun Cheng and other nine; Bo Gu, Zhang Wentian, Lu Futan as the Standing Committee. After the outbreak of January 28 Incident in 1932, Zhang Wentian was disturbed by the class struggle mode of thinking, which denounced the Nineteenth Route Army generals as reactionary and counter-revolutionary \"anti-Japanese warlords\". He pointed out that the Party's strategy is “supporting the soldiers to struggle against Japan automatically and to oppose their superiors, using every opportunity to expose the deceptions of these officials” and making them to think that “they must kill their reactionary superiors in order to win the war.”\n\nIn December 1932, the Shanghai underground party was once again destroyed. Lu Futan and others in Politburo Standing Committee were arrested, resulting in Zhang Wentian, Chen Yun and others to almost get arrested. In January 1933, Zhang Wentian moved to the Central Soviet Area with the temporary central government, and served as the Minister of the Central Bureau of the Soviet Union, and as the chairman of Ruijin Workers and Peasants Democratic Government.\n\nAt that time, the Nationalist Government was preparing for the Fourth Encirclement Campaign against the Jiangxi Soviet. Chiang Kai-shek personally commanded the attack. Bo Gu held a meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, arguing that they should stick to their positions. This proposal has been opposed by the Communist Party of China Fujian Provincial Party Secretary Luo Ming, who said that they should continue the guerrilla warfare since people do not have the strength to resist long-term warfare. Luo Ming pointed out straightforwardly that the resolution of the Central Bureau was an \"empty preaching\". Bo Gu was enraged and wrote “The Central Bureau’s position about Decisions from Fujian Provincial Committee,” in which he accused Luo Ming of \"opportunism\" (Luo Ming doctrine), followed by the launching of anti-Luo Ming campaign. Many grassroots and front-line cadres involved were dismissed from their posts.\n\nOn February 18, 1933, Zhang Wentian published an article entitled \"What is the opportunist line of Comrade Luo Ming\" published in the \"Struggle\", a bulletin for the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Since then, Bo Gu criticized “Jiangxi Luoming line,” and Zhang Wentian also published \"Luo Ming line in Jiangxi,\" \"Fire toward the Opportunism of the Right-wing\" and other articles to support Bo Gu's action. People including Zhang Dingcheng, Liu Xiao, Deng Xiaoping, Mao Zedong, Xie Weijun, and He Shushing were involved in this movement.\n\nIn January 1934, Zhang Wentian was elected member of the Central Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Sixth CPC Central Committee. In February, he was elected as the Chairman of Central Government People's Committee. After the fall of Guangchang, Zhang Wentian criticized the military command of Bo Gu, Li De and others at the first meeting of the Central Military Commission, and began to be estranged from them. In August 1934, the authorities of the Central Soviet area stationed at Shazhou Dam was bombed by the Kuomintang, and they were forced to relocate to Ruijin. Since then, Zhang Wentian began to communicate with Mao Zedong and became close to him.\n\nIn October 1934, Zhang Wentian participated in the Long March with Mao Zedong and Wang Jiaxiang. Three people communicated many times during the march on the way and formed an alliance against Bo Gu and Li De. On January 15, 1935, the First Red Army occupied Zunyi, Guizhou during the Long March, and held a meeting. At the meeting, Bo Gu took the lead in making a report to discuss the errors of military command during the fifth anti-encirclement campaign, but mainly asserted that the difficulties were unavoidable due to circumstances. Zhou Enlai then made a deputy report, saying that it was the tactical errors made by the military command, and admitted responsibility. It was followed by Zhang Wentian's report opposing the Central Committee's military strategy that solely focused on defense. Then, Mao Zedong made a long speech, pointing out that the cause of serious loss and defeat in the fifth anti-encirclement campaign was due to the military's simple defense line, and this was manifest in the adventurism during the attack, the conservatism during the defense, and conservatism during the sortie. Mao Zedong had planned this outline in advance with Wang Jiaxiang and Zhang Wentian. Immediately, Wang Jiaxiang, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi expressed agreement. The meeting was held for three days, and the final decision was to dismiss the leadership of Bo Gu, Li De, and Zhou Enlai. Mao Zedong was co-opted onto the standing committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau by military commanders Zhu De and Zhou Enlai, and was also restored to the position as the military commander of the Red Army.\n\nOn February 5, the Red Army arrived in Bijie, and held a Politburo meeting here. Zhang Wentian replaced Bo Gu as the CPC Central Committee General Secretary. On May 12, Zhang Wentian presided over the Huili Meeting. After the First and Fourth Red Army joined forces in June 1935, Zhang Wentian supported Mao Zedong's decision to go up north and opposed Zhang Guotao's plan to go south.\n\nIn 1936, the Red Army carried out the eastern and western expedition. During this period, Zhang Wentian, Mao Zedong, and Zhou Enlai cooperated to push the anti-Japanese national united front into the CCP's focus. After the outbreak of Xian Incident in December, Zhang Wentian held a meeting to deal with the incident. At this meeting, Mao Zedong proposed to “put Chiang on trial”, “get rid of Chiang”, and Zhang Wentian advocated “not to take the opposite policy with Nanjing, not to organize opposition against Nanjing”, “to strive to gain legitimacy of the Nanjing government and join forces with anti-Chiang troops”. In the end, under the pressure from Stalin, the Xian Incident was peacefully resolved. In January 1937, Zhang Wentian secretly went to Xian to discuss matters with Zhou Enlai, Bo Gu and others.\n\nAfter the full-scale Sino-Japanese War broke out in China in August 1937, the CPC Central Committee held a Political Bureau meeting in Fengjia Village, Luochuan, Shaanxi Province. Zhang Wentian presided over the meeting and made an analytic report on the political situation both at home and abroad. He put forward a proposal of ten major of resistance against Japan and rejected national defeatism.\n\nBy the end of November 1937, Wang Ming, Chen Yun and Kang Sheng returned to Yan’an from Moscow. Zhang Wentian presided over the December Politburo meeting and made a report on \"The Current Political Situation and the Task of the Party.\" At the meeting, the Central Committee decided that Zhang Wentian should manage the Party, Mao Zedong manage the army, Wang Ming manage the United Front, forming a triumvirate layout. In 1938, Zhang Wentian opposed the marriage of Mao Zedong and Jiang Qing.\n\nAfter the 6th Plenary Session of the 6th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhang Wentian withdrew from the position of supreme leader and went on to being responsible for propaganda work and cadre education as the Minister of the CPC Central Committee and Central Propaganda Department. In 1941, Zhang Wentian responded to Mao's call and went to rural areas in northern Shaanxi and northwestern Shanxi for more than a year for a rural survey and wrote \"Return to the Start\". In 1941, the CCP was facing embargo from the Nationalist Party and offensive attacks by the Japanese army. The economy was on the verge of collapse, making CCP highly unpopular among peasants. Zhang Wentian was sent down to Shanxi in order to investigate how to increase the production of agricultural output and improve peasant's livelihood. During the investigation, Zhang found out about the key role of rich peasants in rural prosperity. Zhang proposed providing economic incentives to boost commerce and new capitalism, but his report was suppressed as it went directly against Mao Zedong's plan for organizing collective farms and mutual aid teams. In February 1942, Mao Zedong launched the Yan'an Rectification Movement, and pushed for Sinification of Marxism and study of Mao Zedong thought. When Zhang Wentian returned to Yan'an, he became a target for Yan'an Rectification Movement, and was forced to repeatedly criticize himself. He could not apply his knowledge gained from the investigation to solve economic problems. In June 1945, at the Seventh Congress of the CCP in Yanan, he was elected a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and served as director of the Central Political Research Office.\n\nAfter the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Zhang Wentian volunteered to go to the northeast for local work. After regaining trust from Mao Zedong after continuous self-criticisms, Zhang was sent to Hejiang province in northeast China to take charge of it. On October 22, 1945, Zhang Wentian and Gao Gang, Li Fuchun, Wang Heshou, Kai Feng, Chen Guang and Zhu Rui took a plane from the U.S. mediation team to Handan, and arrived in Shenyang on November 22. Afterwards, Zhang Wentian was sent to North Manchuria. Under the auspices of Chen Yun, he participated in drafting a telegram and sending it to the Central Committee jointly with Chen Yun and Gao Gang. Zhang suggested that the CCP's strategic principle in northeast should be to disperse the armed forces and cadres into the vast rural areas and small to medium-sized cities as soon as possible, and establish a consolidated base instead of concentrating too much attention on big cities. In December, Zhang Wentian served as secretary of the CPC Hejiang Provincial Party Committee. Because of the large number of bandits in Hejiang Province at the time, Zhang Wentian first conducted a social investigation in Ning'an County.\n\nIn Hejiang, he has presided over the work of building political power in Hejiang and suppressing bandits and land reform, and has also served as political commissar of Hejiang Military Region. Between 1947 and 1948, radical land reforms swept northeast China, followed by collective-style mutual aid teams. However, these aid teams soon collapsed, creating chaos in the rural areas. There was a \"leftist\" tendency in the land reform movement and other excessive violence taking place. In response, Zhang Wentian ordered newspapers in Hejiang area not to reproduce the experience of violent land reform, and to protect Hejiang's commerce and industry, and Zhang drafted the \"Directive on the Protection of Business and Industry in Distinguishing the Land. Zhang strongly objected to forceful collectivization and proposed to the Party that the emphasis should be in encouraging rural production, rather than class struggle.\n\nIn May 1948, Zhang Wentian served as a minister of the Standing Committee and Organization Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and deputy director of the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee. During this period, Zhang Wentian drafted the \"Outline on the Basic Principles of Economic Structure and Economic Development in Northeast China\" and put forward the idea of \"five kinds of economic components\". The Outline was affirmed by Mao Zedong and was forwarded to the whole party as a guideline for the economic development of all the liberated areas. In April, he took up the job as the secretary of Liaodong Provincial Party Committee, Liaodong Military District Political Committee to organize the increase of production and to improve people's lives.\n\nSince earlier periods of the CCP, Mao Zedong's emphasis on collective farms as the correct form of rural socialism differed from Liu Shaoqi and Zhang Wentian's line of supporting the supply and marketing cooperative(SMCs). Gao Gang was a prominent leftist and a staunch supporter of Stalin's and Mao's model of bolstering collectivization. Zhang Wentian clashed with Gao Gang when Zhang strongly criticized the idea of organizing all peasants into mutual aid teams. Soon afterwards, the CCP suddenly appointed Zhang as a Chinese delegate to the United Nations without consulting him. Zhang reluctantly accepted the post and repeatedly made pleas to return to his job in the economic sector, but they were ignored. In April 1951, Zhang Wentian was appointed as Ambassador of China to the Soviet Union. Zhang Wentian paid attention to studying international issues and actively submitted the analysis and policy proposals to the Central Government. For instance, the report on the first armistice negotiations in the Korean War was put forward in 1951, and was valued by the Central Government. In 1953, during his conversation with Wu Lengxi of Xinhua news agency, Zhang talked about the weakness and failures of the Soviet collectivization system and warned that China should not blindly copy the Soviet model. In January 1955, Zhang Wentian returned to China and was appointed the first deputy minister of foreign affairs of the People's Republic of China to assist Zhou Enlai in diplomatic affairs. In September 1956, the 8th National Congress of the Communist Party of China elected Zhang Wentian as alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.\n\nIn 1959, Zhang Wentian attended the Lushan Meeting. On July 14, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission and Vice Minister of the State Council and Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai wrote a letter to Chairman Mao Zedong. In the letter, he first affirmed that the principles of the Great Leap forward was correct. However, Peng subsequently pointed out the problems of the Great Leap Forward: \"Now looking back, the basic development in 1958 was overly rapid and a bit too much. In the year 1959, not only the pace could not be slowed down, nor was it properly controlled, and continuing the Great Leap Forward did not lead to immediate regulation of imbalances, but only added new temporary difficulties.” He also pointed out that the lack of democracy and personal worship are the root causes of all these evils.\" On July 19, Huang Kecheng, chief advisor of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Zhou Xiaozhou, the first secretary of the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee, spoke in support of Peng Dehuai. On July 21, Zhang Wentian made a speech for three hours and used more precise theoretical terms to criticize the leftist mistakes of the Great Leap Forward and the People's commune. He advocated the promotion of democracy within the party and supported Peng Dehuai. Subsequently, Mao Zedong, who originally advocated \"rectification of the left,\" turned to criticize the \"Peng Dehuai Anti-Party Group\". Zhang Wentian was classified by Mao Zedong as a \"Right opportunist\" element and a member of “Peng Dehuai Anti-Party Group”. After the meeting, \"Anti-Rightist Movement\" was launched again. Zhang Wentian was further criticized at the National Foreign Affairs Conference and was removed from the post of deputy minister of foreign affairs.\n\nOn November 12, 1960, he took up the job as a researcher for the Institute of Economics at Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences in Chinese Academy of Sciences, and dealt with the research on socialist economic development theories. He went to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Hunan to conduct a social survey. After the survey was over, he wrote a report “Suggestions on Market Trade”. During the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, Mao Zedong again criticized Peng Dehuai, Zhang Wentian, Xi Zhongxun and others. After the meeting, Zhang Wentian was deprived of the right to participate in all Central Committee's meetings and read any document from the Central Government. Afterwards, Zhang Wentian again put forward \"A Duality of Production Relations Theory\". On October 1, Zhang Wentian took part in the celebration of the National Day and went up to the Tiananmen Gate Tower with Mao Zedong to have a conversation.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Zhang Wentian was persecuted and received criticism with Peng Dehuai. From May 17, 1968, Zhang Wentian was under house arrest in his residence. During the period, Zhang Wentian and his wife Liu Ying were separated. In order to obtain material unfavorable to Liu Shaoqi, Kang Sheng asked Zhang Wentian to testify on Liu Shaoqi's charge on “61 Traitors Group”, but Zhang Wentian did not give in to the pressure. On October 24, 1969, Zhang Wentian was released to Zhaoqing, Guangdong with his family.\n\nZhang Wentian started to write a series of theoretical essays that were later referred to as the \"Zhaoqing Manuscript.\" He criticized the ultra-leftist line and errors of the Cultural Revolution and elaborated on the views on the basic issues of China's socialist construction. In his writing, Zhang Wentian wrote that the foremost task of socialist society is to develop productive forces, and “it is absurd to curse the principle of struggle for the material interests of the people as a revisionist, that is to say, unacceptable confusion and deceit!” About the Cultural Revolution, he thought that exaggerating the internal contradictions among the people as the contradiction between the enemy and myself \"caused great harm to the Party.\" It poses a serious disruption to the Party “to have the comrades who hold different opinions are framed as ‘agents of the bourgeoisie within the party,’ because it further confuses the enemy and ourselves.” In May 1972, the CPC Central Committee decided to restore the wages of Zhang Wentian and his wife. Since then, Zhang Wentian repeatedly asked to return to Beijing but was not approved. In August 1975, Zhang Wentian moved to Wuxi.\n\nOn July 1, 1976, Zhang Wentian died in Wuxi, Jiangsu, due to a heart disease at the age of 76. On August 25, 1979, the CPC Central Committee held a memorial service to Zhang Wentian in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.\n\nIn the mainstream historiography of the Communist Party of China, he is regarded as the leader of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China who made a significant contribution to the CCP. During the Yan’an period, Mao Zedong once remarked about Central Soviet area period’s Zhang Wentian: \"Zhang Wentian was an influential figure in the Central Soviet Area, not only because of his status and position, but also for his own qualities.\" On 25 August 1979, during the memorial held for Zhang Wentian by the CPC Central Committee in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Deng Xiaoping wrote a eulogy stating that Zhang Wentian was \"an outstanding Party member and an important leader of our party for a fairly long period of time.\" The next day People's Daily published a news that Zhang Wentian was \"an outstanding party member of the Chinese Communist Party and an older generation of proletarian revolutionaries.\" Throughout his political career, he made criticism whenever overt leftist tendency arose within the Party. Even though his adherence to Bukharin's interpretation of Lenin's \"Cooperative Plan\" set himself against Mao Zedong, who followed Stalin's way of collectivization, and caused constant fluctuations in terms of his political career, Zhang never seized to speak up. He also devoted his entire life studying the economic issues. Jiang Zemin said in his letter to Zhang Wentian's wife Liu Ying in August 1990: \"With his firm unwavering belief in communism, his generous heart as a politician and the cautious demeanor as a scholar, he adhered to the truth for the benefit of the people. His noble character to correct the errors, he always deserves to be learned by all of us in his practical, practical, humble, prudent and simple style of work.\"\n\n"}

The loan amount is determined by the value of the property, and the value of the property is determined by an appraiser from the lending institution. \n\nHome equity loans are often used to finance major expenses such as home repairs, medical bills, or college education. A home equity loan creates a lien against the borrower's house and reduces actual home equity.\n\nMost home equity loans require good to excellent credit history, reasonable loan-to-value and combined loan-to-value ratios. Home equity loans come in two types: \"closed end\" (traditionally just called a home-equity loan) and \"open end\" (a.k.a. a home-equity line of credit). Both are usually referred to as second mortgages, because they are secured against the value of the property, just like a traditional mortgage. \n\nHome equity loans and lines of credit are usually, but not always, for a shorter term than first mortgages. Home equity loan can be used as a person's main mortgage in place of a traditional mortgage. However, one cannot purchase a home using a home equity loan, one can only use a home equity loan to refinance. In the United States until December 31 2017, it was possible to deduct home equity loan interest on one's personal income taxes. As part of the 2018 Tax Reform bill signed into law, interest on home equity loans will no longer be deductible on income taxes.\n\nThere is a specific difference between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). A HELOC is a line of revolving credit with an adjustable interest rate whereas a home equity loan is a one time lump-sum loan, often with a fixed interest rate. With a HELOC the borrower can choose when and how often to borrow against the equity in the property, with the lender setting an initial limit to the credit line based on criteria similar to those used for closed-end loans. Like the closed-end loan, it may be possible to borrow up to an amount equal to the value of the home, minus any liens. These lines of credit are available up to 30 years, usually at a variable interest rate. The minimum monthly payment can be as low as only the interest that is due. Typically, the interest rate is based on the prime rate plus a margin.\n\nA brief list of fees that may apply for home equity loans:\n\n\nSurveyor and conveyor or valuation fees may also apply to loans but some may be waived. The survey or conveyor and valuation costs can often be reduced, provided one finds a licensed surveyor to inspect the property considered for purchase. The title charges in secondary mortgages or equity loans are often fees for renewing the title information. Most loans will have fees of some sort.\n\n\n"}

Ogden is perhaps best known today as the defendant in \"Gibbons v. Ogden\" which destroyed the monopoly power of steamboats on the Hudson River in 1824.\n\nOgden was born in Elizabethtown (known today as \"Elizabeth\") in the Province of New Jersey. He was the son of Robert Ogden, a lawyer and public official who served as Speaker of the New Jersey lower house immediately preceding the Revolution, and Phebe (née Hatfield) Ogden. Ogden's brother Matthias Ogden (1754–1791) was a Revolutionary War soldier and his nephew, Daniel Haines also served as Governor of New Jersey on two separate occasions.\n\nOgden, a Presbyterian, graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1773, and served as a grammar school tutor from 1773 to 1775.\n\nIn the American Revolutionary War, Ogden was appointed a lieutenant in the 1st New Jersey Regiment; his older brother Matthias Ogden was the lieutenant colonel. Aaron Ogden served in various roles through the war, seeing action and rising to the rank of brigade major. In 1778, he visited the house also occupied by the family of diarist Sally Wister, who described him as \"a genteel young fellow, with an aquiline nose.\" He was wounded at the siege of Yorktown in 1781.\n\nOgden was an original member of the New Jersey Society of the Cincinnati. He served as the Society's President General from 1829 until his death in 1839.\n\nAfter the war, Ogden studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1784. He commenced practice in Elizabeth and served as a presidential elector in the 1796 electoral college that elected John Adams. He was clerk of Essex County from 1785–1803, and was elected as a Federalist to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of James Schureman and served from February 28, 1801 to March 3, 1803. He lost his bid for reelection to the Senate in 1802.\n\nIn 1803, Ogden was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly, where he served until 1812. Ogden was elected trustee of the College of New Jersey (later to become Princeton University) in 1803, a post in which he served until his death.\n\nIn 1812, Ogden was elected as Governor of New Jersey in a wave of Federalist victories across the state due to opposition to the War of 1812. Ogden had been nominated by his Federalist colleagues as governor many times before, but the Republican majority who elected the governor held the majority from 1803 to 1812. During his term as Governor, \"funds were secured for the military's use in the war against Britain.\" After running unsuccessfully for reelection, the Federalists were voted out of the majority and with them, Ogden retired from political life. Ogden was nominated by President James Madison as major general of the Army in 1813, but declined the appointment.\n\nIn 1811, he became engaged in steamboat navigation by building the steamboat \"Sea Horse\" to run between Elizabeth and New York City. In 1812, under \"Livingston v. Van Ingen\", the courts chose to upheld a steamboat monopoly over the Hudson River. In 1813, the New York State Legislature further upheld the monopoly created by Chancellor Robert Livingston and Robert Fulton, who had designed the steamboat, so Ogden agreed to pay them for a ten-year monopoly to run his line.\n\nAs a result of a feud with his neighbor and competing steamboat operator, Thomas Gibbons, Ogden was a defendant in the \"Gibbons v. Ogden\" case that denied New York State's attempted monopoly on steamboat operation between New York and New Jersey. In the case, which eventually was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1824, Ogden was represented by Samuel L. Southard and Joseph Hopkinson, Livingston by Thomas Addis Emmet, and Gibbons by Daniel Webster and U.S. Attorney General William Wirt.\n\nOgden moved to Jersey City in 1829 and resumed the practice of law. It was in Jersey City where he was arrested for debt and sent to debtors' prison. He was released several months later under an act of the Legislature that provided \"that no Revolutionary officer or soldier should be imprisoned for debt. The law was so framed as to cover the case of Col. Ogden, and he was released.\" In 1830, he was appointed as Collector of Customs of Jersey City, an office created specifically for him by an act of Congress, and served until his death in Jersey City.\n\nOgden was married to Elizabeth Chetwood (1766–1826), the daughter of John Chetwood, an attorney, and Mary (née Emott) Chetwood (d. 1786).

Cornell was fascinated by the star of \"East of Borneo,\" an actress named Rose Hobart, and named his short film after her. The piece consists of snippets from \"East of Borneo\" combined with shots from a documentary film of an eclipse.\n\nBy chance, Cornell bought a 16mm print of \"East of Borneo\" at a junk shop. To make the 77-minute film less tedious for repeated viewings by himself and his brother, Cornell would occasionally cut some parts, rearrange others, or add pieces of nature films, until it was condensed to its final-length of 19 minutes, mostly featuring shots of the lead actress, with whom Cornell had become obsessed. As such, it might be classified as one of the earliest fanvids, which often feature character studies from stock footage from popular films and television programs.\n\nWhen Cornell screened the film, he projected it through a piece of blue glass and slowed the speed of projection to that of a silent film. Cornell removed the original soundtrack and added \"Porte Alegre\" and \"Belem Bayonne\", two songs from Nestor Amaral's album \"Holiday in Brazil\", a record that Cornell had also found at a junk shop.\n\nThe film was first shown in 1936 at Julien Levy's New York City gallery in a matinee program featuring short films from Cornell's collection. The program, which Levy called \"Goofy Newsreels\", took place around the same time as the first exhibition of surrealist art at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nSalvador Dalí was in the audience, but halfway through the film, he knocked over the projector in a rage. “My idea for a film is exactly that, and I was going to propose it to someone who would pay to have it made,” he said. \"I never wrote it down or told anyone, but it is as if he had stolen it.\" Other versions of Dalí's accusation tend to the more poetic: \"He stole it from my subconscious!\" or even \"He stole my dreams!\"\n\nAfter the Dalí incident, Cornell did not show the film again until the 1960s, when, at the behest of Jonas Mekas, it was screened again for a public audience. When the first print was made from Cornell's original in 1969, Cornell chose a 'rose' tint instead of the normal blue.\n\nIn 2001, \"Rose Hobart\" was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It was also among J. Hoberman's ten votes in both the 2002 and 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" polls of the world's greatest films.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the real life setting of the BBC series \"Peaky Blinders\", and home to Birmingham City F.C.'s ground, St Andrew's. It should not be confused with nearby Bordesley Green.\n\nIn Old English \"Bord's leah\" means 'Bord's clearing'. \"Bord\" may indicate 'boards' or 'planks', a place in the forest clearing where timber products could be obtained, but it is also a male personal name. Here, perhaps as early as the 7th century, Bord found or made a clearing in the forest to grow his crops and tend his stock.\n\nHistorically, a hamlet and chapelry, in the parish and union of Aston, Birmingham, part of the Hemlingford hundred in the county of Warwick, adjoined the town of Birmingham. The hamlet was originally very small, consisting only of a few scattered dwelling-houses, such as Stratford Place, still standing at Camp Hill and the Old Crown in Deritend both of which are of timber frame-work and plaster, with projecting upper stories, although those of Stratford Place have since been under-filled in brick. \nBy 1226, Bordesley was held in demesne by the overlords of the other manors in Aston parish and by the second half of the 13th century it was the centre of a court leet for the neighbouring vills. In 1291 it was certified as containing 61 acres of demesne, with meadows in Bordesley and in Duddeston and Overton (Water Orton); there were 4 freeholders, each with a messuage and a half-yardland, and 78 others without houses holding land newly brought under cultivation, and 16 customary tenants holding 6½ yardlands; the total value was £27 12s. 2d. In 1390 a settlement joined the manors of Bordesley and Haybarn, henceforward usually linked together. Thereafter the manor passed through the same ownership and divisions as the overlordship of the other manors in Aston parish. It appears to have been acquired by Sir Charles Holte by 1706, and to have descended with Aston, being in the hands of a later Sir Charles Holte in 1770.\n\nThe Georgian house known as Bordesley Hall, which stood in a park of 6 acres south of the Coventry Road near its junction with Bordesley High Street, may have been the successor of a medieval manor-house. The first series Ordnance Survey map places the hall in the area of Albert and Bolton Roads, this location being supported by the image of the ruins drawn by P H Witon Jnr in 1791 which places it on an elevated site. Built in 1767 for the manufacturer and banker John Taylor, to replace an existing manor house, it passed on his death in 1785, to his son John Taylor, and was burnt down during the Priestley Riots. Taylor claimed £12670 as damages and was paid £9902 but Hutton records that \"the real loss of Mr Taylor amounted to upwards £22,600,\" or approximately £2.4 million today (2017). It is reported that the house was rebuilt but sold off in 1840 for housing developments. However, Charles Pye writing of his visit to Birmingham in 1818 states that \"\"having crossed the Warwick canal, the ruins of Bordesley house are in full view; they having continued in that state ever since the year 1791, when the house was demolished by an infuriated mob. The land by which it is surrounded has been parcelled out, and advertised to be let for building.\"\"\n\nDue to its proximity to Birmingham, and lying on a main communications route it was natural that the town should grow outwards in this direction. Buildings had reached along Bordesley High Street, as far as the junction of the Coventry and Stratford roads and along the Stratford road about as far as Highgate Park by 1810 and subsequently, in 1838, Bordesley became a suburb of Birmingham, and so developed through its trade, manufactures, and public institutions. By 1841 the population of Deritend and Bordesley had passed 18,000.\n\nBordesley is part of the Nechells Ward, and is currently represented at Birmingham City Council by three Labour councillors; Tahir Ali, Rashid Chauhdry and Yvonne Mosquito.\nNationally, Bordesley is part of Birmingham, Ladywood constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2015 by Shabana Mahmood of the Labour Party.\n\nIt is served by Bordesley railway station, which primarily caters for football fans travelling to Birmingham City's St Andrews football ground on match days. There is no regular train service from the station; bus routes 17 and 60 operated by National Express West Midlands operate a more frequent service into Birmingham city centre.\n\n\nNotes:\nReferences:\n\n"}

{"id": "2278987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278987", "title": "Sender Rewriting Scheme", "text": "Sender Rewriting Scheme\n\nFor a mail transfer agent (MTA), the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) is a scheme for rewriting the envelope sender address of an email message, in view of remailing it. In this context, \"remailing\" is a kind of email forwarding. SRS was devised in order to forward email without breaking the Sender Policy Framework (SPF), in 2003.\n\nIn a number of cases, including change of email address and mailing lists, an MTA accepts an email message that is not destined to a local mailbox but needs to be forwarded. In such cases, the question arises of who deserves to receive any related bounce message. In general, that is either the author, or a person or other entity who administers the forwarding itself. Sending bounces to the author is administratively simpler and used to be accomplished by just keeping the original envelope sender. However, if the author address is subject to a strict SPF policy () and the target MTA happens to enforce it, the forwarding transaction can be rejected. As a workaround, it is possible to synthesize on the fly a temporary bounce address that will direct any bounce back to the current MTA. The scheme provides for recovering the original envelope address, so that if a bounce does arrive, it can be forwarded along the reverse path—with an empty envelope sender this time.\n\nWhile there are other workarounds, SRS is a fairly general one. Its notion of reversing the path resembles the original routing dispositions for email, see below.\n\nSRS is a form of variable envelope return path (VERP) inasmuch as it encodes the original envelope sender in the local part of the rewritten address. Consider \"\" forwarding a message originally destined to to his new address :\n\nThe example above is adapted from Shevek. With respect to VERP, the local part () is moved after her domain name (), further adding a prefix (), a hash ('), and a timestamp ('). That reflects an operational difference: Eventual bounces back to a VERP address are handled within the rewriting domain, and forged messages can at most unsubscribe some users, a kind of abuse that hasn't seen significant exploits in the last decades. Instead, SRS aims at remailing a possible bounce back to \"Alice\", so that forged bounces can become an alluring technique for injecting spam apparently originating from the rewriting sender.\n\n\nSRS provides for another prefix, , to be used for rewriting an already rewritten address, in a multi-hop scenario. If ' has to forward the message in turn, it can spare adding another timestamp and repeating the original local part (). That is, each new forwarder adds just its own hash (') and the domain name of the preceding forwarder:\n\nUsing a database can definitely control the growth of rewritten addresses, since it is sufficient to put just a unique key in the rewritten local part. It also allows for a certain amount of anonymity in the resending process, if this is desired. However, a database requires centralization and is a single point of failure.\n\nAnother possibility is to store the long rewritten address somewhere in the message header. The = tag of a DKIM-Signature may be a good place, as such choice considerably improves the security. This technique has been just observed. Unless there is a backup mechanism, it can only work if the bounce message is in a standard format.\n\nHistorically all mail transfer agents (MTAs) added their host name to the \"reverse path\". In the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) this \"reverse path\" is also known as , but paths were also used before and outside of SMTP, e.g. as \"bang paths\" in UUCP and Usenet (NetNews). All news articles still contain a header, example:\n\nThe same information in an RFC 5321 e-mail \"envelope\" - that is the SMTP info like - would be:\n\nThe 1st step reflects the sender, the 2nd step the next MTA, etc. In this example let's assume that the 2nd MTA forwards the mail to a 3rd MTA, where it is finally delivered. The final MTA is also known as Mail delivery agent (MDA), putting the mail into the mailbox of the recipient. The MDA transforms the \"reverse path\" into the known header field:\n\nSMTP uses MX records for its forward routing.\nExplicit source routes as in...\n\n...to route mail from via MTA to MDA were cumbersome. To make things worse sometimes the \"new\" (1982) style of addresses was mixed with old UUCP \"bang paths\" in constructs like...\n\n...and various other kludges. SMTP and MX records made all this essentially useless. Therefore, source routing was deprecated 1989 in RFC 1123.\n\nOne special case in RFC 1123 are gateways from or to other networks like UUCP and NetNews, where the first sending MTA cannot reach the final receiver directly with TCP. It is solved by MX records and if necessary rewriting foreign addresses at the gateway. MX is an acronym for Mail eXchanger.\n\nAnother special case are mailing lists, where the list server rewrites all \"reverse paths\" to its own error handling address for bounces (error messages) by recipients. The list server could automatically unsubscribe bouncing recipients. This type of address rewriting is known since RFC 821 and still used today (RFC 5321, as well as RFC 2821, updated the SMTP chapter in RFC 1123).\n\nLast but not least forwarding to another address always worked by rewriting the address in the \"forward path\" also known as , if and only if the forwarding MTA accepted the responsibility for both forwarding the mail and returning potential bounce messages to the sender. RFC 821 and all later SMTP specifications offer two result codes for this situation:\n\nFor privacy reasons these result codes are today rarely used; they include the or . But the meaning and the effect of forwarding to third parties is identical for and respectively.\n\nAs noted RFC 1123 deprecated source routing, that implicitly also deprecated the reverse routing of bounces. It was a relatively small Internet back in 1989, mail admins (postmasters) often knew each other and fixed problems on the fly. Routing bounce messages back via any forwarders was a waste of time and bandwidth if the MTA noting a problem (e.g. a rejection with a 5xx error code) could send the error message directly back to the MX of sender.\n\nSince RFC 1123 forwarders to third parties still rewrote the address, but kept the as is. As a side effect MTAs wishing to accept mail from forwarders generally accept any address.\n\nMore than a decade later spammers started to abuse this flaw in post-1123 SMTP, today most mails are spam and most \"reverse paths\" are forged. Note that spammers typically forge working \"reverse paths\", many MTAs reject mail if callback verification or other plausibility checks fail for the \"reverse path\".\n\nRFC 5321, as well as RFC 2821, states that non-delivery reports (bounces) must be sent to the \"originator\" as \"indicated in the reverse path\" after an MTA accepted the responsibility for delivery. However, the bounce message may be suppressed when the original content is \"hostile\" (cf. spam or virus mail) or the message is forged (RFC 5321, Section 6). Note that all current forgery detection methods require the mailbox owner to supply information for them to work. Failing to supply the criteria should not make any bounce message classifiable as backscatter, although some people mistakenly think it should.\n\nOpen relays and forwarders are in an unlucky position with regards to this issue, generally they can't guarantee that the address indicates the \"originator\", and they also can't guarantee that final delivery will succeed.\n\nThis SMTP problem caused as side effect of RFC 1123 is addressed by SPF, and the executive summary is \"SPF breaks forwarding\" - actually that's not the case, only asks receivers to check SPF at their border MTA, not later.\n\nReceivers can arrange their forwarding in a way that works with SPF with in essence three strategies:\n\nSender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) is one way for the third strategy.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2279005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279005", "title": "Nechells", "text": "Nechells\n\nNechells is a district ward in central Birmingham, England, whose population in 2011 was 33,957. It is also a ward within the formal district of Ladywood. Nechells local government ward includes areas, for example parts of Birmingham city centre, which are not part of the historic district of Nechells as such, now often referred to in policy documents as \"North Nechells, Bloomsbury and Duddeston\".\n\nEarly recorded versions of the name include \"Echeles\" (about 1180), \"Le Echeles\" (1290) and \"Le Necheles\" (1322). The latter form of the name derives from \"atten Eccheles\", \"belonging to the \"Eccheles\"\", an Old English word meaning \"land added to a village or estate\". The philologist Eilert Ekwall speculated that a more precise meaning could be \"land added by clearing,\" or \"land added by draining a marsh\". In the Middle English period, following the process of language change known as metanalysis, only the \"n\" in \"atten\" remained in oral usage and became assimilated to \"Eccheles\". So, n+Eccheles became the \"Nechells\" (pronunciation ) of modern usage. However, the pronunciation was also current, as indicated by the spelling of Tomlinson's Map of \"Duddeston and Netchells\", published in 1758. This pronunciation was also to be heard in the 20th century amongst some older inhabitants of the area.\n\nThe name \"Nechells Green\" originally referred to the triangle of land at the meeting point of the present Nechells Park Road, Nechells Place, Bloomsbury Street, Rocky Lane, Charles Arthur Street and Thimble Mill Lane. On Tomlinson's 1758 map the area was indeed shown as a village green surrounded by a few lanes and fields. In the 1950s and 60s the name was adopted for the re-developed area of Ashted, Duddeston and Vauxhall to the south-west of Nechells itself.\n\nNechells became a densely populated area during the 19th century, with mass development of houses and factories taking place. Mass immigration occurred from Ireland. In 1868 it was described thus:\n\nDevelopments in the Victorian era include the opening of the aforementioned St Clement's Church, designed by J. A. Chatwin, in 1859; St Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in 1872 (incorporating the former chapel of the Roman Catholic cemetery, designed by A. W. Pugin and opened in 1850). The later church was designed by Pugin's son, E. W. Pugin; a board school situated in Hutton (later Eliot) Street in 1879; the building of almshouses adjacent to St. Clement's church to accommodate \"31 inmates, widows, single women, and married couples - whose age is above 60\" and Bloomsbury Library of 1892 on Nechells Parkway, described as \"a typical vigorous example of the red brick and terracotta school for municipal building at the end of the 19th century.\".\n\nThe London and North Western Railway's line from Stechford to Aston cut across Nechells Park Road and neighbouring streets when it opened in 1880, as had the Grand Junction Railway from Liverpool and Manchester to Birmingham in order to reach its temporary terminus at Vauxhall in 1837.\n\nAfter World War II, further immigration occurred from parts of the Commonwealth, mostly the Caribbean and the Indian Sub Continent.\n\nBy the 1950s, however, many of the homes in Nechells had been reduced to \"slums\" and were unfit for human habitation. People were living in homes without electricity, running water, bathrooms or indoor toilets. The Gas Works caused a continuous unpleasant smell. The bulk of the area had been designated as a redevelopment area in 1937, but its regeneration was put off by some 20 years due to World War II.\n\nThe face of Nechells changed dramatically during the 1960s, with the decaying Victorian terraces being cleared and the area redeveloped with new houses and tower blocks. Some families remained in the new homes that had been built around Nechells, but there were insufficient new homes to rehouse all of the area's original residents, and as a result some families moved to new housing estates like Castle Vale and Chelmsley Wood. The new homes were certainly a big improvement on their predecessors, but the area still suffered from rising unemployment and crime.\n\nThe development of high rise flats in Nechells had actually started in the 1950s, and it was the home of Birmingham's very first tower block - Queens Tower, on Great Francis Street - which was completed in 1954 and is still standing today. However, many of the tower blocks in the Nechells area were demolished in the 1990s to make way for new low rise private and rented housing.\n\nEvents in Nechells have rarely attracted the attention of the national news media, but in 1961, the then vicar of St. Clement's, the Rev. Elwyn Evans, was called upon by police to assist them in negotiating with a man who had fired an air rifle from the window of his house in Austin Street. According to the \"Sunday Telegraph\", 500 people had watched the police try to arrest the man who had effectively laid siege to the street. The Rev. Evans eventually persuaded the man to give himself up and accompanied the unemployed man as he surrendered to the police. It was reported that Rev. Evans, who served in Nechells from 1952–64, had been taking a bath when the police arrived at his vicarage on Stanley Road.\n\nAustin Street itself, situated between Aston Church Road and Trevor Street at right angles to Nechells Park Road, no longer exists, having been built over by new housing.\n\nEarly evidence of industrial, or rather small-scale craft activity in Nechells is given on Tomlinson's 1758 map which shows a slitting mill used as a stage in the manufacture of nails situated at a point towards the northern end of what was to become Nechells Park Road.\n\nOn Ordnance Survey 1:2500 maps of 1902 and 1904 there is much evidence of industry in the early 20th century: Nechells Chemical Works and Birmingham Paper Mill were located adjacent to the Birmingham and Warwick Junction Canal at the eastern end of Cattells Grove; a Tube Works, Stove Works and Varnish Works were situated in an area bounded by the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, Holborn Hill and Long Acre; and a building shown as \"Park Mills (Edge Tool)\" is shown on Wharton Street, again adjoining the Birmingham and Warwick Junction Canal.\n\nLater in the 20th century Nechells was chosen as the location of two gasworks, in Windsor Street and Nechells Place, Two coal-fired power stations were situated on land now occupied by the Star City complex. The first power station was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1923 and a larger plant, known as Nechells \"B\", opened in 1954. The B station had a capacity of 224 megawatts (MW) and generated 52.869 GWh of electricity in 1980-81. A small railway network was used by both power stations for the transport of coal from the main line railway at Saltley and within the plant. The power stations closed in 1982, but a steam locomotive used at the site, \"Nechells No.4\", has been preserved and is operating on the Chasewater Railway in Staffordshire\n\nThe second of the two gasworks was the setting - in an \"obscure suburb on the eastern side of Birmingham\", according to one historian, - for the so-called Battle of Saltley Gate in February 1972, a confrontation between striking mineworkers, the police and the West Midlands Gas Board over the picketing mineworkers' attempt to prevent the transport of coke from the gasworks. In labour history and mythology, the name \"Saltley Gate\" (or \"Gates\") has persisted, despite the locale for the incident being in Nechells.\n\nNechells played a part in the development of the petrol-driven internal combustion motor car. At the age of twenty and with no formal qualifications, Frederick William Lanchester so impressed the owner of the Forward Gas Engine Company of Birmingham that he was offered the position of assistant works manager at their factory near Bloomsbury Street where he made various improvements to the equipment produced by this company. Lanchester resigned from the company in 1893 and went on to produce the first all-British four-wheel petrol car. A sculpture, the Lanchester Car Monument, was built in Bloomsbury Village Green to commemorate Lanchester's work.\n\nNearby, on Lingard Street, close to Bloomsbury Library, was situated another branch of the motor vehicle industry. David Haydon Ltd manufactured bodies for fire engines until the closure of the firm in the 1960s.\n\nFoundry Services Ltd, later FOSECO, moved into premises on Long Acre in 1933. The company had been created by two German Jewish refugees, Eric Weiss and Kossi Strauss, and specialized in the manufacture of fluxes and compounds used in the iron foundry industry. The firm moved to Tamworth in the 1990s and is now a multinational business.\n\nAt the corner of Long Acre and Plume Street stood the large factory of Verity's Ltd, a manufacturer of electrical motors, fans and electrical fittings. The company went into voluntary liquidation in 1959.\n\nFlights Hallmark, a coach and corporate vehicle operator, has its head office and a depot on Long Acre, on the site of the former Aston motive power depot.\n\nThe privately owned St Clements Nursing Home at the junction of Nechells Park Road and Stanley Road was built on land formerly occupied by St. Clement's Vicarage.\n\nA notable feature of the commercial life of present-day Nechells is the headquarters of the Wing Yip Chinese food and restaurant business which occupies a site at Nechells Green bounded by Thimblemill Lane, Long Acre, Nechells Park Road and Railway Terrace. This site opened in 1992, was expanded considerably in 1996 and now includes a business centre serving the Chinese community and a food superstore.\n\nAlso on Thimble Mill Lane, the Aston Manor Brewery started production in 1993 and produces beer, cider and perry. It is capable of producing 24,000 bottles per hour.\n\nOn 7 July 2016, five workers lost their lives when a concrete wall collapsed at the plant of Hawkeswood Metal Recycling on Trevor Street.\n\nThe 2011 Population Census found that 33,957 people lived in the ward with a population density of 3,400 people per km². The broad ethnic breakdown of the population is: Asian 13.5%; White 15%; Black 65%; Mixed 3.5%; and others 3%. The largest ethnic groups are: White British (12%); Pakistani (9%); African (60%) mainly Somali,Sudanese and Eritrean; Caribbean (8%) and Bangladeshi (11%).\n\nThe Census also shows that Nechells has a young population with 29% of residents under 18 years old (compared with\n25% in Birmingham as a whole). The median age of Nechells residents is 25 years as opposed to 32 years in Birmingham as a whole. Only 7% of people are 65 years or older (compared with 13% in Birmingham as a whole). More than half of the children growing up\nin Nechells are in families defined as being in child poverty.\n\nWhilst it is notable in Birmingham for being the area with the highest rate of unemployment, crime and poverty, it has been the focus of a great deal of urban regeneration by Birmingham City Council and the former Birmingham Heartlands Development Corporation.\n\nHowever, a report published in 2010 by the Birmingham Public Health Information Team concluded that:\n\n\nTwo primary schools in Nechells have acquired academy status. They are Nechells Primary E-ACT Academy (the successor to Nechells Junior and Infants school and Hutton Street Board School before that) and Nechells Church of England Academy (the successor to St Clement's Church of England Primary School which opened next to St Clement's Church in Stuart Street in 1859).\n\nNechells Secondary Modern school, for pupils aged 11–16, which was incorporated into the existing Eliot Street Junior and Infants site after the passing of the 1944 Education Act, and with additional buildings on the adjoining Crompton Road, was closed and its buildings demolished in the 1980s.\n\nNechells is currently served by Heartlands Academy, the successor to Heartlands High School and Duddeston Manor School before that.\n\nNechells is served by Duddeston railway station and Aston railway station. From 1856 to 1869, a station named \"Bloomsbury and Nechells \" was situated slightly to the north of the present Duddeston station.\n\nBus service to Nechells began in the 1850s. Osborne's railway timetable for January 1858 lists an omnibus service from the Town Hall to Nechells Green and Bloomsbury consisting of eight return journeys per day and operated by Lamyman and Monk. The fare was four pence. These services were the distant foreunners of the main bus service serving Nechells in 2019, the National Express West Midlands bus route 66 from Birmingham city centre to Sutton Coldfield via Erdington. This route is itself the successor of trolleybus route 7, which ran from the city centre to Nechells from 1922 to 1940 and the motorbus route 43 which replaced it in 1940. The West Midlands bus route 8, the \"Inner Circle\", also serves the western part of the area.\n\nWhen the planned High Speed 2 rail line from London to Birmingham is constructed, it will skirt the south-eastern edge of Nechells, running alongside the Birmingham-Derby and under the Aston-Stechford railways and Aston Church Road before continuing to Saltley and a new Curzon Street station. The site of the former Metro-Cammell works has been acquired for the construction of a depot and control centre for the new line.\n\nNechells is home to Star City – a vast entertainment complex that houses shops, restaurants, a 22-lane bowling centre (Tenpin, formerly Megabowl), a casino, a hotel and Vue Cinema which, with thirty screens, is one of the largest multiplexes in Europe. Star City has been described as a \"palace of pleasure...feeding and entertaining groups from families to young couples to children's parties\".\n\nAs well as Bloomsbury library, other community facilities include Nechells Play Centre and the Nechells Green Community Centre. Sports facilities are provided at the Heartlands High Community Leisure Centre and the Nechells Community Sports Centre.\n\nThe Villa Tavern pub at the junction of Nechells Park Road and Holborn Hill displays the date \"1897\" as the year in which it was built. However, the present building dates from 1924–25 and is a rebuilding of the original pub on this site by the architect Matthew J. Butcher. It is a Grade II listed building.\n\nNechells Baths on Nechells Park Road is also Grade II listed. Plans for baths to be constructed in the Nechells ward came about in 1900 when representatives from the ward pressured the council into providing public baths for the ward. However, the Birmingham Baths Committee were already committed to other projects in the city and were unable to immediately attend the matter.\n\nIn 1903, a site at the corner of Nechells Park Road and Aston Church Road was acquired and in 1908, approval was given for the construction of baths on the site. Construction commenced that year and the baths were opened 22 June 1910. Facilities provided included a large swimming bath with a spectators' gallery and suites of private baths for men and women. The baths were immediately popular among the locals.\n\nRefurbishment work to the baths was completed in May 2007 by Welconstruct. It cost £5.5 million, with funding from Advantage West Midlands, the Heritage Lottery Fund and ERDF.\n\n\nNechells ward is served by one Labour councillor; Tahir Ali.\n\nNechells has adopted a Ward Support Officer.\n\n\n"}

At the time sporting clubs only had access to fields owned and maintained by suburban councils and this purchase was made possible by a loan from Colonel Tom Millner MC VD.

{"id": "2279024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279024", "title": "All Tomorrow's Parties (festival)", "text": "All Tomorrow's Parties (festival)\n\nAll Tomorrow's Parties was an organisation based in London that promoted music festivals, concerts and records throughout the world for over ten years. It was founded by Barry Hogan, in 2001 in preparation for the first All Tomorrow's Parties Festival, the line-up of which was picked by Mogwai and took place at Pontins, Camber Sands, England. Named after the song \"All Tomorrow's Parties\" by The Velvet Underground, the festival exhibited a tendency towards post-rock, avant-garde, and underground hip hop, along with more traditional rock fare presented in smaller venues than typical stadium performances. It was at first a sponsorship-free festival where the organisers and artists stay in the same accommodation as the fans. It claimed to set itself apart from festivals like Reading or Glastonbury by staying intimate, non-corporate and fan-friendly. Another difference was the line-ups being chosen by significant bands or artists, resulting in unorthodox events which often combined acts of all sizes, eras, and genres.\n\nThe festival took place in the UK, USA and Australia, and was curated by the following artists: Deerhunter, TV On The Radio, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The National, The Drones, Greg Dulli (Afghan Whigs), Jeff Mangum (Neutral Milk Hotel), Battles, Caribou, Les Savy Fav, Amos, Animal Collective, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Jim Jarmusch, Pavement, The Flaming Lips, The Breeders, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Mike Patton & Melvins, My Bloody Valentine, Explosions In The Sky, Pitchfork Media, Portishead, Fennesz, Dirty Three, Thurston Moore, The Shins, Sleater Kinney, Dinosaur Jr., Devendra Banhart, Mudhoney, The Mars Volta, Vincent Gallo, Slint, Jake & Dinos Chapman, Stephen Malkmus, Mogwai, Tortoise, Shellac, Sonic Youth, Boards of Canada, Autechre, Modest Mouse, Cowboy Junkies, and Simpsons' creator Matt Groening.\n\nThe festival had its origins in the Bowlie Weekender, curated by Belle & Sebastian at Camber Sands in April 1999. Artists, usually musicians (but sometimes visual artists like Matt Groening, whose line-up featured in the Observer's list of the ten best festivals of the year, or Jake and Dinos Chapman) were asked to curate the festival by inviting their favourite performers to play. The idea was that it was akin to dipping into the curator's record collection, or as founder Barry Hogan described it, \"ATP is like an excellent mix tape\".\n\nIn 2001 the organisation spawned ATP/Recordings, a record label originally created to bring out compilation albums related to its festivals. However the label eventually moved on from just doing compilations for the festival to sign and release singles and albums from artists including Threnody Ensemble, Bardo Pond, The Magic Band, Deerhoof, White Out, Death Vessel, The Drones, Fursaxa, The Scientists, Apse, Fuck Buttons, Alexander Tucker, Sleepy Sun, Spiritualized, Built To Spill, Autolux and most recently Tall Firs and Tennis. At the end of 2007 ATP/R launched series of double 7\" singles called Custom Made, which would feature bands choosing four songs; one something old, one something new, one something borrowed (a cover version) and one something blue (artists were free to interpret this as they feel). Artists to release singles in this series were Australia's The Drones, Britain's Alexander Tucker and America's Deerhoof.\n\nIn 2002, the festival expanded to the USA, and several events took place there in subsequent years. The organisation also became involved in booking stages at the Pitchfork Music Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona, Spain. In 2008, \"All Tomorrow's Parties\" ran their first East Coast USA festival, which took place at Kutsher's Hotel and Country Club, Monticello, New York. In January 2009, the festival took place for the first time in Australia, with events in Brisbane, Sydney and Mount Buller (in Victoria) all curated by Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds.\n\nThe organisation that put on these festivals also promoted concerts in London and the rest of the United Kingdom, curated the yearly Don't Look Back concert series and ran the record label ATP Recordings.\n\nAll Tomorrow’s Parties, as with a number of modern festivals, embraced a variety of artistic genres. Most festival events featured art exhibitions and cinema programmes (in the USA, ATP collaborated with Criterion to present cinema highlighted by appearances from Paul Schrader and Jim Jarmusch), and others featured spoken word performances, stand-up comedy, and book clubs.\n\nIn 2007 the curators allowed festival-goers to pick the line-up by organising a voting process for all ticketholders in the months running up to the event, and this was repeated in May 2009. The 2007 festival took place at Butlin's Minehead. In the years before 2013, when ATP announced they were ceasing to hold residential festivals in the UK, the festival took place up to three or four times a year in the UK (in May and then in December for the 'Nightmare Before Christmas'). UK festivals were planned to recommence in 2015, moving to Pontins Prestatyn.\n\nIn 2009, Warp Films released a feature-length documentary about the festival named \"All Tomorrow's Parties\". It premiered at the SXSW Film Festival, and then premiered in the UK at Edinburgh in June. In October 2009 the film was screened at a number of 'one night only' UK theatrical screenings also featuring live music from Les Savy Fav, who feature in the film and have long been mainstays of \"All Tomorrow's Parties\" line-ups.\n\nIn 2010, ATP announced I'll Be Your Mirror, a series of events to take place in cities around the world named after the B-side to the original 1966 \"All Tomorrow's Parties\" single by the Velvet Underground. These events still involved a curator choosing all the music and films that play at the event, but without the holiday resort accommodation. The first event took place in Tokyo, Japan in February 2011.\n\nSignificant past performances at ATP festivals include the reformations of The Magic Band, Television, The Jesus Lizard, Sleep, and Slint amongst others. All Tomorrow's Parties also presented the return of My Bloody Valentine with a series of worldwide live performances throughout 2008, the London concerts of which were named Time Out London's Gig Of The Year.\n\nIn 2012, the company running the events was put into liquidation, owing £2.6 million to its creditors. The company's directors set up a new firm, Wilwall, but this also experienced difficulties, filing late accounts, incurring significant debts, and was subject to court judgements related to debt. A Grizzly Bear concert at Alexandra Palace was cancelled, as was its urban festival, Jabberwocky, the latter only 3 days before the event was due to take place. A festival hosted by Drive Like Jehu was to be held in Prestatyn in Wales in 2016, but this was moved to Manchester in England, before being cancelled. A few months later the company went in administration, and its scheduled festival in Iceland was cancelled.\n\n\n"}

The outlet of Big Moose Lake forms the North Branch in northern Herkimer County. The Middle Branch originates at the Fulton Chain Lakes in Old Forge. And the Southern Branch has its headwaters in Little Moose Lake in Hamilton County. The Middle and South branches merge in Mckeever, New York and become just Moose River. It flows generally westwardly through Herkimer County into Lewis County, reaching its confluence with the Black River in Lyons Falls.\n\nOwing to its high gradient as it drops out of the mountains, The Moose is a favorite destination for whitewater rafters, kayakers and canoeists. There are three whitewater sections below McKeever with increasing degrees of difficulty. The Middle Moose is a Class II-III section of river from the gaging station in McKeever to Rock Island. The Lower is a Class III-V section from Rock Island to just above Fowlerville Falls, which is run commercially in early spring and includes drops such as Tannery, Froth Hole, Mixmaster and Miller's Falls. The Bottom Moose is a Class V+ section from Fowlerville on. In the Spring and Fall of each year, hundreds of whitewater paddlers descend on the Moose from all parts of the US and eastern Canada. The Bottom Moose (see below), in particular, is a favorite run for paddlers who enjoy Class-V whitewater. This run has several waterfalls, ranging from straightforward and easy to difficult and dangerous.\n\nAlso because of its high gradient, there are several hydropower projects along the Moose's course.\n\n\n"}

Marsfield is located 16 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Ryde. Marsfield is often simply referred to as North Shore. \n\nThe suburb is noted for its proximity to a number of leading scientific and tertiary educational institutions such as Macquarie University, the Macquarie Park Business Park and Macquarie University Hospital.\n\nThe suburb's name is derived from Field of Mars, the original name in the early days of British colonisation of Australia, given to the area by Governor Phillip in 1792.\n\nThe whole area between the Parramatta and Lane Cove Rivers was originally known by its Aboriginal name Wallumatta. The aboriginal name survives in a local park, the Wallumatta Nature Reserve, located at the corner of Twin and Cressy Roads, North Ryde.\n\nIn 1792 Governor Phillip began the granting of parcels of lands to Royal Marines, and the area was referred to on Phillip's maps as the Field of Mars, named after the Roman Field of Mars probably because of the military link. The area was later part of the suburb of North Ryde, and many consider that Marsfield is still a part of the greater North Ryde area. Field of Mars was also the name for the parish proclaimed in 1835.\n\nIn 1874, following extensive debate including a Parliamentary Select Committee, the government resumed the Common for sale and settlement by small farmers, using the money to fund bridges across the Parramatta River at Gladesville and Iron Cove. \nThe land was subdivided into small farms of between , and released for sale in stages, starting in 1885.\n\nMany of the streets in Marsfield and bordering suburbs, mainly Eastwood and Macquarie Park, are named after famous historical conflicts or battles, such as Abuklea Road, Agincourt Road, Alma Road, Balaclava Road, Bannockburn Road (West Pymble), Buffalo Road (Gladesville), Busaco Road, Corunna Road, Cressy Road (East Ryde), Crimea Road, Culloden Road, Fontenoy Road, Khartoum Road, Plassey Road, Talavera Road, Taranto Road, Torrington Road, Trafalgar Place, Vimiera Road, Waterloo Road.\n\nIn 1894, the \"Municipality of Marsfield\" formed its own local government, splitting from Ryde Municipality.\n\nStately, historical Curzon Hall was built in the 1890s by Harry Smith and named after his wife Isabella Curzon-Smith. The house was bought in 1921 by the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul which established St Joseph's Seminary on the premises. It now serves as a function centre.\n\nUntil the 1950s, substantial parts of the North Ryde/Marsfield area were part of the \"Green Belt\" which prevented building houses on lots of less than . \nThe Marsfield-North Ryde Green Belt boundaries were revised and in December 1959, of land was rezoned. The last Green Belt land was released in September 1969 to build Macquarie Shopping Centre and Macquarie University.\n\nMarsfield is bounded by the Lane Cove River, Macquarie University Sports Fields, Talavera Road, Culloden Road, Waterloo Road, Vimiera Road, Marsfield Park and Culloden Road in the north, Epping Road, Shrimptons Creek, Kent Road, Ruse Street and Shrimptons Creek in the east, Bridge Road and Abuklea Road in the south and Terrys Creek in the west.\n\nMarsfield is home to:\n\nThis green suburb features large, modern homes on the higher parts with views, and townhouses/units in the parts of the suburb that border South Turramurra and Epping.

The average household size was 2.6 people. The tenure was split between 38.7% of properties that were rented, 29.3% owned outright and 26.1% owned with a mortgage.\n\nA number of bus routes service Marsfield. The 292/293 routes run from the city through Lane Cove and terminate in Busaco Road while other many routes e.g. 288/291 travel along Epping Road to Epping station.

The organisation was founded as the \"Women’s Defence of the Constitution League\" but was eventually shortened by the press as the Black Sash due to the women's habit of wearing black sashes at their protest meetings. These black sashes symbolised the mourning for the South Africa Constitution. The founding members gathered for tea in Johannesburg before they decided to organise a movement against the Senate Act. They succeeded to hold a vigil of 2 000 women who marched from Joubert Park to the Johannesburg City Hall.\n\nThe Black Sash initially campaigned against the removal of Coloured or mixed race voters from the voters' roll in the Cape Province by the National Party government. As the apartheid system began to reach into every aspect of South African life, Black Sash members demonstrated against the Pass Laws and the introduction of other apartheid legislation. It would later open Advice Offices to provide information concerning their legal rights to non-white South African's affected by that legislation. Its members \"\"used the relative safety of their privileged racial classification to speak out against the erosion of human rights in the country. Their striking black sashes were worn as a mark of mourning and to protest against the succession of unjust laws. But they were not only on the streets. Volunteers spent many hours in the national network of advice offices and in the monitoring of courts and pass offices.\"\" (Speech by Marcella Naidoo, National Director of the Black Sash, June 2005)\n\nBetween 1955 and 1994, the Black Sash provided widespread and visible proof of white resistance towards the apartheid system. Its members worked as volunteer advocates to families affected by apartheid laws; held regular street demonstrations; spoke at political meetings; brought cases of injustice to the attention of their Members of Parliament, and kept vigils outside Parliament and government offices. Many members were vilified within their local white communities, and it was not unusual for women wearing the black sash to be physically attacked by supporters of apartheid.\n\nIn the 1980s it was part of the National Land Committee assisting the non-white communities that were subject to forced land removals. It would also be involved on the Rural Women's Movement, supporting rural non-white women rights in regards to inheritance and land ownership. In 1983, the organisation called for the abolition of military conscription.\n\n\nThe Black Sash's resistance movement came to an end in the early 1990s with the end of apartheid, the unbanning of the ANC and the release of Nelson Mandela from imprisonment. Its role was recognised by Nelson Mandela on his release and by subsequent political leaders. The organisation was reformed in 1995 as a non-racial humanitarian organisation, working to 'make human rights real for all living in South Africa'.\n\nIn May 2015, the organisation celebrated its 60th anniversary as it shifted its focus towards education, training, advocacy and community monitoring. The celebration of the Black Sash history was also marked by the launching of two books, namely \"Standing on Street Corners: a History of the Natal Midlands Region of the Black Sash\" and \"a\" biography by Annemarie Hendrikz\".\" \n\n\n\n"}

He also had a career as a vocalist.\n\nBorn in Ocean City, New Jersey, in 1900, Foster was the eldest of three children of New Jersey natives Sallie R. (\"née\" Stratton) and Walter Foster. Preston had two sisters, Mabel and Anna; and according to federal census records, his family still lived in Ocean City in Cape May County at least as late as 1910. There his father supported the family working as a painter. Sometime between 1910 and 1918, the Fosters relocated to Pitman, New Jersey, where Preston's father was employed as a machinist. The census for 1920 and Preston's earlier draft registration card from 1918 document that he continued to reside at that time at his parents' home at the intersection of Laurel and Snyder avenues in Pitman. Those records document as well that he had a job as a clerk for the New York Ship Company in Camden, New Jersey, located about 17 miles north of Pitman. A decade later, additional census records show that Foster had moved to Queens, New York, where he was living with his first wife, Gertrude, a widow and stage actress who was seven years his senior. The federal census of 1930 also lists Foster as an actor by then, one employed in \"Legitimate Vaudeville\".\n\nFoster began working in films in 1929 after acting on Broadway, where he was still performing as late as November 1931 in the cast of \"Two Seconds\". He soon reprised that stage role in Hollywood in the filmed version of the play. Some of his subsequent films include \"Doctor X\" (1932), \"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\" (1932), \"Annie Oakley\" (1935), \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" (1935), \"The Informer\" (1935), \"Geronimo\" (1939), \"My Friend Flicka\" (1943), and \"Roger Touhy, Gangster\" (1944).\n\nOver the years, as Foster's film experience in Hollywood grew, producers and directors gained increasing respect for his ability to play an array of characters, ranging from the \"snarling family‐deserting criminal\" in \"The People's Enemy\" in 1935 to the soft-spoken, fatherly chaplain on the Pacific battlefront in the 1943 film \"Guadalcanal Diary\". Once, when asked if he ever regretted performing in villainous roles, Foster gave some insight into his family's reaction to them:\n\nFoster's career was interrupted by World War II, when he served with the United States Coast Guard. While in active service he rose to the rank of captain, and later he was awarded the honorary rank of commodore.\n\nIn addition to performing on stage and in numerous films, Foster was an accomplished singer who performed on both radio and in nightclubs, as well as a voice actor on radio. On July 25, 1943, Foster co-starred with Ellen Drew in \"China Bridge,\" a presentation of \"Silver Theater\" on CBS radio. Foster also enjoyed a secondary career as a vocalist. In 1948, he created a trio consisting of himself, his second wife Sheila, and guitarist Gene Leis. Leis arranged the songs, and the trio performed on radio and in clubs, appearing with Orrin Tucker, Peggy Ann Garner and Rita Hayworth.\n\nIn 1950, Foster began performing on the young but rapidly expanding medium of television. His first credited role on the \"small screen\" was in September of that year on the NBC anthology series \"Cameo Theatre\", in an episode titled \"The Westland Case\". Later, after a few other appearances on series, he starred in the televised drama \"Waterfront\", playing Captain John Herrick during the 1954-1955 broadcast season. He also guest-starred in 1963 in the ABC drama series \"Going My Way\", starring Gene Kelly.\n\nFoster was married twice, the first time to actress Gertrude Elene (Warren) Leonard, a widow who had been born in Woodbury, New Jersey in 1893. The two wed on June 27, 1925, in Manhattan, where they both worked as actors. In the early 1930s, the couple left New York City and relocated to Los Angeles. There, in 1939, they adopted a daughter, Stephanie; but six years later Preston and Gertrude divorced. Foster then married actress Sheila Darcy in 1946, a union that lasted 24 years, until his death.\n\nDuring times between his performances in films and on television, Foster often enjoyed boating and deep-sea fishing, especially for marlin, off California's southern coast. He continued to accept acting offers in his later years, although far less regularly during the final decade of his life. His last film credit was in the role of Nick Kassel in \"Chubasco\", which was released just two years before his death.\n\nDuring his later years, Foster lived in the seaside community of La Jolla, California, part of the city of San Diego. In 1969, when the San Diego Padres made their debut as a Major League Baseball team, Foster wrote a song titled \"Let's Go Padres\", which was billed as the team's official song. He sang it at some home games that season. Foster died in 1970 at age 69 in La Jolla after what \"The New York Times\" described as \"a long illness\". His gravesite is located at El Camino Memorial Park in San Diego, California.\n\nPreston Foster has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Blvd.\n\n\n"}

That same year, she was featured on hip hop producer, DJ, and emcee Pete Rock's album \"Soul Survivor II\", providing vocals to the track \"No Tears\". In 2005, she lent her voice to the posthumously released Ray Charles album \"Genius & Friends\", duetting with the singer on the song \"Compared to What\".\n\nJames' debut album, \"A Change Is Gonna Come\", was released on June 21, 2005. The album was conceived as a throwback to an earlier era of American soul music, building upon the legacy of 1960s and 1970s soul singers while incorporating elements of contemporary R&B, funk, and gospel.\n\nIn the lyrics to the album's lead single, \"Music\", James laments the current state of contemporary popular music. She condemns the glorification of materialism and misogyny that has often been attributed to the lyrical content of contemporary R&B and hip hop songs while pleading for the return of the artistry, dedication, and sincerity displayed by musicians of earlier decades.\n\nJames co-wrote most of the tracks on her debut album, two exceptions being her covers of the pop rock band No Doubt's 1996 hit \"Don't Speak\" and the classic title song by Sam Cooke, for which the album is named. Notable collaborators on the album include Raphael Saadiq, Kanye West and Wyclef Jean.\n\nLeela guested on Robert Randolph and the Family Band's 2006 album \"Colorblind\", lending her vocals to \"Stronger\".\n\nAfter parting ways with Warner Bros., James signed with the independent label Shanachie Records and released her second studio album on March 24, 2009, an all-cover set entitled \"Let's Do It Again\" (the title being a homage to the 1975 soundtrack album of the same name by The Staple Singers).\n\nIn June 2009, she appeared on the Moby album \"Wait for Me\", performing the vocal on \"Walk with Me\".\n\nJames' third album \"My Soul\" - her debut release for the Stax label - was released on May 24, 2010, and debuted on the US Hip Hop/R&B chart at #7. Speaking in May 2010 to UK soul writer Pete Lewis of \"Blues & Soul\", she stated: \"With this album I wanted to make sure that I showed all sides of me - in terms of variety in the music and in my vocal range - while at the same time making it clear that every song deeply came from my soul. Plus I also wanted to incorporate a little more hip hop this time, and infuse it with my traditional R&B - because I felt that. By making my beats edgier and harder-hitting, I'd show there was more to me than just doing ballads and things of that sort.\"\n\nOn July 8, 2014, Leela James released her fifth studio album, \"Fall For You\". The album's first two singles, \"Say That\" feat. Anthony Hamilton and \"Fall For You\" both reached Top 15 on the Billboard Urban AC charts, with \"Fall For You\" reaching #12. Ms. James supported her album with tours nationwide, including performances at Essence Music Festival, Arizona Jazz Fest, San Diego Jazz Fest, Capitol Jazz Fest, and more.\n\nJames' sixth album, \"Did It for Love\" was released on March 31, 2017 by Shesangz Music under license to BMG. The album has the singles \"Don't Want You Back\" released on October 28, 2016, \"Hard for Me\" released on February 25, 2017, \"Don't Mean a Thang\" released on March 27, 2017, and a video single \"All Over Again\" on May 4, 2017. The single \"Don't Want You Back\" reached number 1 on \"Billboard\"' Adult R&B Songs chart on April 15, 2017, becoming her highest charting single ever.\n\nIn Summer 2010, she appeared on the BET television series \"My Black is Beautiful\" as a co-host alongside of Tasha Smith, Kim Coles, and Alesha Renee.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, she starred on seasons 2 and 3 of the TV One reality show \"\".\n\nIn late 2018, she appeared in the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show.\n\nJames cites singers James Brown, Roberta Flack, Toni Braxton, Marvin Gaye, Donny Hathaway, Gladys Knight, Mavis Staples, Etta James and Stevie Wonder as her influences.

Formed in Birmingham in 1985, the all-female quartet originally consisted of Vix (Vickie Perks), Magz (Maggie Dunne), Jo Dunne and Tina O'Neill. The band's name was shortened to Fuzzbox for the U.S. release of their first album. They disbanded in 1990 after releasing two studio albums, and reunited in 2010 for a series of concerts. A second reunion was confirmed in 2015.\n\nResident in Moseley, Sheldon and Acocks Green, Birmingham, Fuzzbox came together in 1985. Their name was chosen after they bought a distortion pedal for their guitars and Maggie Dunne stated \"We've got a fuzzbox and we're gonna use it!\".\n\nTheir first release, in March 1986, was a single of \"XX Sex\" and \"Rules And Regulations\", with the fuzzbox featuring prominently, which reached No. 41 in the UK charts. This proved a huge success for the group; despite not reaching the Top 40, the Vindaloo Records release remained in the Indie chart for twenty-five weeks. This led to tours of the UK and Europe and, in December that year, their debut album, \"Bostin' Steve Austin\", was released (Geffen re-titled the album \"We've Got A Fuzzbox and We're Gonna Use It\" upon its US release). This album spawned the band's first Top 40 hit, \"Love Is The Slug\" and the minor hit \"What's The Point\".\n\nIn the summer of 1986 the band teamed up with their Vindaloo Records labelmates, The Nightingales and Ted Chippington to record a single \"Rocking With Rita (Head To Toe)\". The single, credited to the Vindaloo Summer Special, featured Fuzzbox tackling such classics as \"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\" on the b-side. Further discussions led to their cover of Norman Greenbaum's hit \"Spirit in the Sky\", with vocals provided by Magz (Maggie).\n\nThe band signed to WEA and for their next album, \"Big Bang!\" (1989), they made an abrupt change and reinvented themselves as a slick dance-pop vocal group, with Vickie Perks being cast centre stage as a sex symbol. The songs \"Pink Sunshine\", \"Fast Forward Futurama\" and \"International Rescue\" were all produced by Andy Richards and co-written by Liam Sternberg. The first three singles from the album, \"International Rescue\" (UK No. 11), \"Pink Sunshine\" (UK No. 14) and \"Self!\" (UK No. 24) all reached the UK Top 30, although a fourth single released from the album, a cover of Yoko Ono's \"Walking on Thin Ice\", peaked at No. 76. \"Self!\" also became the group's only charting single in the United States when it peaked at number 16 on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock chart and number 35 on \"Billboard\"'s Dance Music Club Play chart.\n\nIn 1990, they began work on a new album entitled \"Out Of This World\", but the project was halted after the release of the first single \"Your Loss, My Gain\" due to 'musical differences'. Perks decided to continue a solo career under the name of Vix whilst the other three members left the music industry. They reunited in 2008 and appeared at the Birmingham Pride festival. Previously unreleased material was released as \"Fuzz and Nonsense\" and \"From Rules and Regulations to Pink Sunshine\" featuring tracks originally slated for \"Out Of This World\". An album was later released of their two radio sessions for the late John Peel and sessions for Janice Long's show, entitled \"Love Is A Slug: Complete BBC Sessions\". Peel show listeners voted \"Rules and Regulations\" into number 31 in the Festive Fifty in 1986.\n\nIn October 2004 a compilation of Fuzzbox singles and alternative mixes entitled \"Look At The Hits On That\" was released complete with a DVD of their promotional videos – most of which were publicly unavailable up until that release.\n\nEarly in 2010, Fuzzbox announced their reunion, returning as a quintet without drummer Tina O'Neill. A 13-date UK tour took place in May, along with a new single and video, a cover of M's \"Pop Muzik\", released through Gotham Records and iTunes on 17 May.\n\nOn 25 September 2010, Fuzzbox headlined at the Shifnal Festival; on 25 March 2011, they played at the Whitby Gothic Weekend. The latter was this reunion's last gig, the project disbanding shortly afterwards.\n\nGuitarist Jo Dunne died on 26 October 2012, six weeks after being diagnosed with cancer. She was 43.\n\nIn July 2015, Fuzzbox appeared on BBC Radio 2 with Sara Cox to confirm a second reunion. On 9 September, it was confirmed that Megan Burke, Sarit Black and Hannah Layhe had joined the band on guitar, bass and drums respectively.

The Green itself, which is roughly triangular, is bounded on two of its three sides by the New King's Road section of the King's Road, A308 road and Parsons Green Lane. The wider neighbourhood is bounded by the Harwood and Wandsworth Bridge Roads, A217 road to the East and Munster Road to the West, while the Fulham Road, A3219 road may be said to define its northern boundary. Its southern boundary is less clearly defined as it merges quickly and imperceptibly with the Peterborough estate and Hurlingham.\n\nAt its historic centre lie two open spaces, the Green itself and Eel Brook Common. The name stems from the original village green, after the former residence of the rectors of Fulham Parish. It is one of the Conservation areas in Hammersmith and Fulham, that extends from the borough boundary in the east to Fulham High Street in the west.\n\nTimber rights attached to the Green are mentioned in court rolls dating from 1391. In 1625 there were only six rated residents for the area. By 1706, John Bowack opined in his \"Antiquities of Middlesex\" that it \"was inhabited mostly by gentry and persons of quality\".\n\nTwo cricket matches were held on Parsons Green in 1731 and 1733. The first was on Tuesday, 10 August 1731 between Fulham and Chelsea, Fulham winning. The second was on Tuesday, 26 June 1733 between the same two teams and played for a substantial prize of 30 guineas, although the result is unknown.\n\nIn the 18th century, changes continued with the building of grand houses with grounds. These were bought by merchants and bankers from the City and not infrequently by members of the Court and their 'associations'. The area acquired a somewhat louche reputation at that time.\n\nFulham F.C. had their ground in the park for two years from 1889. Early in the 20th century, a few test flights were carried out there with flying machines.\n\nParsons Green is referred to in an early poem by Sir John Betjeman, \"The Varsity Students Rag\", as a place where the poem's protagonist is said to have a \"run-in\" with a policeman.\n\nOn 15 September 2017 an IED exploded on a London Underground train injuring 29 people. The IED was placed in a bucket however did not detonate fully, with injuries being largely burn related. No fatalities were reported. An 18-year-old Iraqi refugee was arrested the next day at the Port of Dover. He was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment, having found to have been in contact with members of Islamic State.\n\nIn 2018, the ward of Parsons Green & Walham had a population of 11,041 people. Parsons Green & Walham has the highest income of any ward in Hammersmith and Fulham, with an average gross household income of £63,700. The ward is 56.8 per cent White British and 25.4 per cent Other White, mainly consisting of EU citizens, Australasians and North Americans.\n\n\n\nBus route 22 includes New King's Road and the area is also served by Parsons Green tube station on the District line.\n\n\n\n"}

In September of each year, hundreds of whitewater paddlers descend on the Beaver from all parts of the US and eastern Canada.\n\nAlso because of its high gradient, there are several hydropower projects along the Beaver's course. These projects, created between 1905 and 1920 have fostered a series of highly productive fisheries in the reservoir chain. Popular among locals, the Soft Maple Reservoir is an excellent Smallmouth Bass fishery.\n\nThe hamlet of Beaver River at the east end of Stillwater Reservoir, in the town of Webb has a year-round population of three that increases during the summer as many people have camps in this wilderness area.

It is considered by some to be the first significant reggae studio and label in the United States.\n\nWackies music has a distinctive sound. It is bass heavy and deliberately crafted to have what some people call a \"lo-fi\" sound. Wackies achieved this sound using special recording techniques and equipment. This equipment was so notable that some pieces now have a place in the Les Paul Museum. Popular Jamaican reggae artists such as Horace Andy, Sugar Minott, and Wayne Jarret appeared regularly on the label. However, Lloyd Barnes developed a number of New York-based artists such as: Itopia; Chosen Brothers; Love Joys; Jah Batta; Clive Field Marshall; Dub Generals, and Junior Delahaye, whose releases primarily appeared on the Wackies label. Most commonly known as \"Bullwackie All Stars,\" Lloyd Barnes worked with a notable group of studio musicians including: Jerry Harris; Ras Menelik; Jerry Johnson; Clive \"Azul\" Hunt, and Douglas Levy.\n\nWackies music, while mainly known for its contribution to reggae, influenced the burgeoning hip hop movement of late 1970s and early 1980s New York. Reggae sound system dances were quite popular throughout New York City. Wackies music was played on specialized, powerful soundsystems while reggae deejays such as Jah Batta vocalized rhythmically and melodically atop the trademark bass-heavy sound. This influenced and encouraged the development of the hip hop parties featuring live MC's, the counterpart to the reggae soundsystem deejay. In 1979, Wackies also released one of the earliest hip hop records, \"Wack Rap\" by Solid C, Bobby D, and Kool Drop, credited as the Wackies Disco Rock Band\n\nWackies continued to record and release music through the 1990s, and in 1999 collaborated with Ras Takashi to form the Wackies Far East Chapter in Japan. An extensive promotional tour of Japan featuring Ras Takashi and Ras Kush of Black Redemption Sounds of Praises occurred in the same year to establish the label. Releases on the Wackie Far East label included contribution from Lloyd Barnes, Ras Takahi, Ras Kush, among others. Wackies Far East Chapter, under the guidance of Ras Takashi, continues to be a force for Wackies release and distribution in Japan.\n\nWackies music continues to be released in the 2000s. Jammyland, Plush label, Ras Takashi, Dubsensemania and many others continue to collaborate with Lloyd Barnes. Concurrently, re-issues of 1970s and 1980s Wackies music have attained remarkable popularity and remain a constant force on the vintage scene.\n\nMost if not all of the original (1970s and 1980s) Wackies recorded releases are out-of-print and in demand among reggae music collectors. Germans Moritz Von Oswald and Mark Ernestus, passionate devotees of the label's sound, have undertaken an extensive and ongoing 12\" and LP re-issue campaign for the label through an exclusive imprint in the Basic Channel record label family, bearing the Wackies logo and label design. To date, the imprint has put out work from artists such as Horace Andy, Jerry Harris, Wayne Jarrett, Love Joys, The Meditations, and Sugar Minott, as well as several strictly dub releases by Wackies-sponsored bands.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2279119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279119", "title": "Władysław Kozakiewicz", "text": "Władysław Kozakiewicz\n\nWładysław Kozakiewicz (born 8 December 1953) is a retired Polish athlete who specialised in the pole vault. He is best known for winning the gold medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow and the bras d'honneur gesture which he showed to the hostile Soviet crowd. In Poland, where the gesture was viewed as a symbol of resistance against Soviet dominance, it became known as \"Kozakiewicz's gesture\" (\"gest Kozakiewicza\"). In addition, he won several medals at continental level, won two Summer Universiades and broke the pole vault world record three times, twice outdoors and once indoors. He is also a ten-time Polish champion.\n\nKozakiewicz was born on 8 December 1953 to a Polish family in Šalčininkai, Lithuanian SSR, near Vilnius as the fourth and youngest of four siblings. His father Stanisław was a tailor, his mother Franciszka a housewife. As he revealed in his 2013 autobiography, he was physically abused by his father during his childhood as was his entire family. The family moved to Poland in 1958 as part of the last wave of the post-war repatriations of Poles living in the Soviet Union, first staying in a refugee camp in Gryfice before settling in Gdynia where Władysław's father found a job as a dockworker.\n\nWładysław's older brother Edward (b. 1948) was an aspiring pole vaulter (later switched to decathlon) at the local club, Bałtyk Gdynia, and one day in 1966 encouraged his then 13-year-old brother to also give athletics a try. He showed his brother how to pole vault and Władysław's talent was soon noticed by Walenty Wejman who became his first coach. In 1972 Władysław Kozakiewicz broke Polish junior records both indoors and out, also breaking the 5 metres barrier for the first time. A year later, after changing the coach to Ryszard Tomaszewski, he broke the Polish senior record with 5.35 metres and made his major international debut taking silver at the 1974 European Championships in Rome. In 1975 at the European Indoor Championships in Katowice, he won a bronze medal and later in the season at the Janusz Kusociński Memorial he jumped 5.60 metres setting a new European record.\n\nAt the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Kozakiewicz was one of the favourites for the gold but the Olympic debut ended in a disappointment. During a warm-up jump before the final, he ruptured his joint capsule and was later only able to clear 5.25 metres which gave him the 11th place. The competition was won by his unheralded compatriot, Tadeusz Ślusarski. Kozakiewicz was able to return to competition just three weeks after Montreal. Soon after, however, he was disqualified by the Polish Athletic Association (PZLA) for competing in the shoes of the Japanese manufacturer Onitsuka Tiger, with which he signed a contract a year earlier, instead of Adidas, which was then the official sponsor of the federation. This resulted in Kozakiewicz being barred from competing abroad for six months and marked the beginning of a series of disputes with the national federation and bans for insubordination.\n\nThe disqualification was eventually shortened so that Kozakiewicz could compete at the 1977 European Indoor Championships in San Sebastián which he won in a new championships record of 5.51 metres. This started a very successful season in which he, among others, won the Summer Universiade in Sofia and set a new European record of 5.66 metres in the European Cup semifinal in Warsaw. In the entire year he suffered only one loss, at the 1977 World Cup, where, representing Europe, he came second behind the American Mike Tully.\n\nThe next season while again full of victories at various meetings, saw Kozakiewicz narrowly missing out on medals at two major international competitions. First he came fifth at the 1978 European Indoor Championships in Milan, and then, affected by an illness, fourth at the 1978 European Championships in Prague. The latter performance was deemed a big loss by the federation and he was handed another half-year disqualification.\n\nIn 1979 Kozakiewicz won the European Indoor Championships in Vienna, his second gold at this competition, improving the indoor European record to 5.58 metres. He later won the 1979 Summer Universiade in Mexico City where at altitude he jumped 5.60 metres.\n\nThe 1980 season did not start very well as he finished only fourth at the 1980 European Indoor Championships in Sindelfingen, West Germany, the competition won by the Soviet Konstantin Volkov, who would be Kozakiewicz's main rival at the upcoming Moscow Olympics. However, in May that year at a meeting in Milan, Kozakiewicz for the first time in his career broke the world record with a mark of 5.72 metres. The record was later that summer bettered by two Frenchmen, first Thierry Vigneron added three centimetres to it and then Philippe Houvion another two, setting it at 5.77 metres.\n\nThe sporting level in the Olympic final which took place on 30 July 1980 at the Central Lenin Stadium in Moscow, was significantly higher than four years earlier with no less than six athletes jumping higher than the previous Olympic record. The atmosphere at the stadium, however, as it was for the entire games was very hostile with the local Soviet crowd booing, hissing, and whistling at every non-Soviet competitor's attempt. Soviet officials even tried to disrupt Kozakiewicz by opening doors to the stadium during his jumps so wind conditions would disturb him.\n\nThis irritated Kozakiewicz, who after jumping 5.70 metres, higher than any other competitor that day, showed the bras d'honneur gesture in defiance to the jeering spectators. He then repeated the gesture after clearing 5.75 metres which ensured his victory over the local favourite, Konstantin Volkov. He finally confirmed his dominance over the competition by breaking the world record with 5.78 meters. This was the first time since 1920 that the world record in pole vault was broken at the Olympic Games.\n\nThe photos of the incident circled the globe, with the exception of the Soviet Union and its satellites, although the event was broadcast live on TV in many countries of the Eastern Bloc. While international observers varied in their reaction to the incident, Kozakiewicz's act received much support in Polish society, which resented Soviet control over Eastern Europe (Poland was in the midst of labor strikes that led to the creation of the labor union Solidarity less than two months later). After the 1980 Olympics ended, the Soviet ambassador to Poland demanded that Kozakiewicz be stripped of his medal over his \"insult to the Soviet people\". The official response of the Polish government was that Kozakiewicz's arm gesture had been an involuntary muscle spasm caused by his exertion.\n\nIn an interview years later, Kozakiewicz gave his thoughts about the incident:\nThe Russian crowd was whistling... at any non-Russian contestant. They were whistling to distract us, you can only imagine the noise: 70,000 people at the Luzhniki Stadium, probably only 10,000 of them were tourists.\n\nIt occurred to me that I'm the only person in the world who got whistled at for breaking the world record. So when I landed, I showed them this 'Polish shaft', the nicest one you can imagine. I expressed my anger at the whistling Soviet audience; nobody whistles in athletics. If you take a look at TV broadcasts, you find that people either clap rhythmically when they feel like it, or simply sit quietly.\nIn 1982, struggling to get into form after splitting from his long-time coach Ryszard Tomaszewski, Kozakiewicz won what would be his last medal for Poland, a bronze at the 1982 European Indoor Championships in Milan. In the summer, he decided to skip the outdoor European Championships citing poor form, for which he received another 6-month disqualification from PZLA. The following 1983 season did not begin well for Kozakiewicz as he finished only 9th at the 1983 European Indoor Championships in Budapest. After that poor showing he reunited with coach Tomaszewski and tried to build form for the 1983 World Championships in Helsinki. He eventually finished eighth in that event clearing 5.40 metres. In the Olympic year of 1984, Kozakiewicz jumped much better reaching 5.75 metres in July. However, due to a Soviet-led boycott of the Los Angeles Olympics most athletes from the Eastern bloc could not compete in the Games. Instead, an alternative event was organised for the socialist countries, the Friendship Games, with men's athletics being contested in Moscow. Kozakiewicz, not willing to take part in what he saw as a farcical event, took only one successful attempt at 5.40 metres before feigning an injury and calling it quits. His performance angered the Polish federation which demanded that he immediately return to Poland from a meeting in Brussels in which he took part soon after the Friendship Games and after he refused he was disqualified again.\n\nEven after his disqualification ended in 1985, Kozakiewicz was not allowed to participate in meetings abroad unless he jumped 5.70 metres. Given he was recovering from a knee surgery this did not seem realistic and not being able to support his family he decided to flee Poland. He last competed for his native country in April in São Paulo and in July 1985 he defected to West Germany. A move which was intended to be a temporary means to earn some money before retiring would later turn out to be permanent. He based himself in Hannover, and joined a local club where he also became a pole vaulting coach. In May 1986 Kozakiewicz gained West German citizenship as his wife's grandparents were born in Germany. Soon after he set a new West German record of 5.70 metres which lasted until 1994. In 1988 Kozakiewicz jumped 5.62 metres, the standard for the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, however, according to the rules, the Polish federation had to give him permission to compete for a new country at the Olympics which it did not. Kozakiewicz retired from professional athletics in 1989.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s apart from training young talents, he also worked as a manager for many professional athletes, mostly from the former Soviet Union. Between 1998 and 2002 he was a member the Gdynia city council. In 2011, he ran unsuccessfully for the Polish parliament from the lists of the Polish People's Party.\n\nSince 1977 he has been married to Anna Kozakiewicz, a former swimmer. They have two daughters Katarzyna (b. 1979) and Małgorzata (b. 1983). In December 1986, he settled in Bissendorf, Lower Saxony, northwestern Germany, where he lives to this day.\n\n\n\n"}

In 2013, Tolli competed in the fifth season of \"The X Factor Australia\" and reached the top five.\n\nJiordan Anna Tolli was born on 17 June 1994, in Melbourne, Victoria to parents Luke and Vanda. Her cousin, Fabio Tolli, was married to her former \"Neighbours\" co-star Kym Valentine, who played Libby Kennedy. Prior to entering \"The X Factor\", she performed in a lot of musical theatre.\n\nTolli was cast in the role of Louise \"Lolly\" Carpenter in the long-running soap opera \"Neighbours\" when she was two months old. Her parents had answered a casting call put out by Jan Russ for a baby to play the role of Tom Oliver (Lou Carpenter) and Caroline Gillmer's (Cheryl Stark) on-screen daughter. After seven years of playing Lolly, Tolli left \"Neighbours\" in 2001 to focus on her schooling. Tolli's mother said it was \"the right time\" for her daughter to leave and the producers agreed.\nTolli has appeared in numerous advertisements and has done some modelling work. In 2011, Tolli made a guest appearance in the third series of \"Tangle\". She will appear as Caitlyn in the upcoming film \"Is This The Real world.\" starring Sean Keenan and Charlotte Best. In August 2013, it was confirmed that Tolli would be making a one-off appearance in \"Neighbours\" as Lolly to celebrate Lou's 70th birthday. As she had spent a large portion of her childhood on the show, Tolli said she was comfortable returning to the set to film her scenes. Tolli appeared during the episode broadcast on 4 October 2013.\n\nIn 2013, Tolli auditioned for the fifth season of \"The X Factor Australia\" with Birdy's version of \"People Help the People\". She commented that her time on \"Neighbours\" helped calm her nerves. Tolli advanced to the super bootcamp stage of the competition. On the first day of super bootcamp, Tolli sang a rendition of \"Pumped Up Kicks\" by Foster The People and advanced to the second stage of super bootcamp, where she sang \"Last Request\" by Paulo Nutini. On the final day of super bootcamp, Tolli performed \"Running Up That Hill\" by Kate Bush to the judges and a live audience of one thousand. She then advanced to the home visits stage and was put into the Girls category, which was mentored by Redfoo. At the home visits, Tolli sang \"Bizarre Love Triangle\" by Frente! for Redfoo and his assistant will.i.am and advanced to the live shows. During the first week of the live shows, Tolli sang \"Smile\" by Lily Allen and she advanced to the second week, where she sang Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\". On 10 September, Tolli's performance of \"Thriller\" debuted at number sixty-three on the ARIA Singles Chart, becoming Tolli's first single to debut on a national chart.\n\nIn week five of the live shows, Tolli fell into the bottom two alongside Joelle Hadjia but was saved after judges Ronan Keating, Natalie Bassingthwaighte and Dannii Minogue all opted to eliminate Hadjia. Following the eliminations of Hadjia and Ellie Lovegrove, Tolli became the only remaining contestant in the Girls category. In week seven of the live shows, Tolli fell into the bottom two alongside Omar Dean but was saved via deadlock. Tolli's performance of Lorde's \"Royals\" debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at number eighty-one. In week eight of the live shows, Tolli fell into the bottom two alongside Third Degree. The judges vote went to deadlock, and Tolli was eliminated after it was revealed she received the fewest votes. She placed fifth overall in the competition. Tolli appeared on \"Sunrise\" on 21 October 2013, as a guest reporter doing a segment on the backstage drama of \"The X Factor\".

{"id": "2279144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279144", "title": "Microdialysis", "text": "Microdialysis\n\nMicrodialysis is a minimally-invasive sampling technique that is used for continuous measurement of free, unbound analyte concentrations in the extracellular fluid of virtually any tissue. Analytes may include endogenous molecules (e.g. neurotransmitter, hormones, glucose, etc.) to assess their biochemical functions in the body, or exogenous compounds (e.g. pharmaceuticals) to determine their distribution within the body. The microdialysis technique requires the insertion of a small microdialysis catheter (also referred to as microdialysis probe) into the tissue of interest. The microdialysis probe is designed to mimic a blood capillary and consists of a shaft with a semipermeable hollow fiber membrane at its tip, which is connected to inlet and outlet tubing. The probe is continuously perfused with an aqueous solution (perfusate) that closely resembles the (ionic) composition of the surrounding tissue fluid at a low flow rate of approximately 0.1-5μL/min. Once inserted into the tissue or (body)fluid of interest, small solutes can cross the semipermeable membrane by passive diffusion. The direction of the analyte flow is determined by the respective concentration gradient and allows the usage of microdialysis probes as sampling as well as delivery tools. The solution leaving the probe (dialysate) is collected at certain time intervals for analysis.\n\nThe microdialysis principle was first employed in the early 1960s, when push-pull canulas and dialysis sacs were implanted into animal tissues, especially into rodent brains, to directly study the tissues' biochemistry. While these techniques had a number of experimental drawbacks, such as the number of samples per animal or no/limited time resolution, the invention of continuously perfused dialytrodes in 1972 helped to overcome some of these limitations. Further improvement of the dialytrode concept resulted in the invention of the \"hollow fiber\", a tubular semipermeable membrane with a diameter of ~200-300μm, in 1974. Today's most prevalent shape, the needle probe, consists of a shaft with a hollow fiber at its tip and can be inserted by means of a guide cannula into the brain and other tissues.\n\nThere are a variety of probes with different membrane and shaft length combinations available. The molecular weight cutoff of commercially available microdialysis probes covers a wide range of approximately 6-100kD, but also 1MD is available. While water-soluble compounds generally diffuse freely across the microdialysis membrane, the situation is not as clear for highly lipophilic analytes, where both successful (e.g. corticosteroids) and unsuccessful microdialysis experiments (e.g. estradiol, fusidic acid) have been reported. However, the recovery of water-soluble compounds usually decreases rapidly if the molecular weight of the analyte exceeds 25% of the membrane’s molecular weight cutoff.\n\nDue to the constant perfusion of the microdialysis probe with fresh perfusate, a total equilibrium cannot be established. This results in dialysate concentrations that are lower than those measured at the distant sampling site. In order to correlate concentrations measured in the dialysate with those present at the distant sampling site, a calibration factor (recovery) is needed. The recovery can be determined at steady-state using the constant rate of analyte exchange across the microdialysis membrane. The rate at which an analyte is exchanged across the semipermeable membrane is generally expressed as the analyte’s extraction efficiency. The extraction efficiency is defined as the ratio between the loss/gain of analyte during its passage through the probe (C−C) and the difference in concentration between perfusate and distant sampling site (C−C).\n\nIn theory, the extraction efficiency of a microdialysis probe can be determined by: 1) changing the drug concentrations while keeping the flow rate constant or 2) changing the flow rate while keeping the respective drug concentrations constant. At steady-state, the same extraction efficiency value is obtained, no matter if the analyte is enriched or depleted in the perfusate. Microdialysis probes can consequently be calibrated by either measuring the loss of analyte using drug-containing perfusate or the gain of analyte using drug-containing sample solutions. To date, the most frequently used calibration methods are the low-flow-rate method, the no-net-flux method, the dynamic (extended) no-net-flux method, and the retrodialysis method. The proper selection of an appropriate calibration method is critically important for the success of a microdialysis experiment. Supportive in vitro experiments prior to the use in animals or humans are therefore recommended. In addition, the recovery determined in vitro may differ from the recovery in humans. Its actual value therefore needs to be determined in every in vivo experiment.\n\nThe low-flow-rate method is based on the fact that the extraction efficiency is dependent on the flow-rate. At high flow-rates, the amount of drug diffusing from the sampling site into the dialysate per unit time is smaller (low extraction efficiency) than at lower flow-rates (high extraction efficiency). At a flow-rate of zero, a total equilibrium between these two sites is established (C = C). This concept is applied for the (low-)flow-rate method, where the probe is perfused with blank perfusate at different flow-rates. Concentration at the sampling site can be determined by plotting the extraction ratios against the corresponding flow-rates and extrapolating to zero-flow. The low-flow-rate method is limited by the fact that calibration times may be rather long before a sufficient sample volume has been collected.\n\nDuring calibration with the no-net-flux-method, the microdialysis probe is perfused with at least four different concentrations of the analyte of interest (C) and steady-state concentrations of the analyte leaving the probe are measured in the dialysate (C). The recovery for this method can be determined by plotting C−C over C and computing the slope of the regression line. If analyte concentrations in the perfusate are equal to concentrations at the sampling site, no-net flux occurs. Respective concentrations at the no-net-flux point are represented by the x-intercept of the regression line. The strength of this method is that, at steady-state, no assumptions about the behaviour of the compound in the vicinity of the probe have to be made, since equilibrium exists at a specific time and place. However, under transient conditions (e.g. after drug challenge), the probe recovery may be altered resulting in biased estimates of the concentrations at the sampling site. To overcome this limitation, several approaches have been developed that are also applicable under non-steady-state conditions. One of these approaches is the dynamic no-net-flux method.\n\nWhile a single subject/animal is perfused with multiple concentrations during the no-net-flux method, multiple subjects are perfused with a single concentration during the dynamic no-net-flux (DNNF) method. Data from the different subjects/animals is then combined at each time point for regression analysis allowing determination of the recovery over time. The design of the DNNF calibration method has proven very useful for studies that evaluate the response of endogenous compounds, such as neurotransmitters, to drug challenge.\n\nDuring retrodialysis, the microdialysis probe is perfused with an analyte-containing solution and the disappearance of drug from the probe is monitored. The recovery for this method can be computed as the ratio of drug lost during passage (C−C) and drug entering the microdialysis probe (C). In principle, retrodialysis can be performed using either the analyte itself (retrodialysis by drug) or a reference compound (retrodialysis by calibrator) that closely resembles both the physiochemical and the biological properties of the analyte. Despite the fact that retrodialysis by drug cannot be used for endogenous compounds as it requires absence of analyte from the sampling site, this calibration method is most commonly used for exogenous compounds in clinical settings.\n\nThe microdialysis technique has undergone much development since its first use in 1972, when it was first employed to monitor concentrations of endogenous biomolecules in the brain. Today's area of application has expanded to monitoring free concentrations of endogenous as well as exogenous compounds in virtually any tissue. Although microdialysis is still primarily used in preclinical animal studies (e.g. laboratory rodents, dogs, sheep, pigs), it is now increasingly employed in humans to monitor free, unbound drug tissue concentrations as well as interstitial concentrations of regulatory cytokines and metabolites in response to homeostatic perturbations such as feeding and/or exercise.\n\nWhen employed in brain research, microdialysis is commonly used to measure neurotransmitters (e.g. dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA) and their metabolites, as well as small neuromodulators (e.g. cAMP, cGMP, NO), amino acids (e.g. glycine, cysteine, tyrosine), and energy substrates (e.g. glucose, lactate, pyruvate). Exogenous drugs to be analyzed by microdialysis include new antidepressants, antipsychotics, as well as antibotics and many other drugs that have their pharmacological effect site in the brain. The first non-metabolite to be analyzed by microdialysis in vivo in the human brain was rifampicin.\n\nApplications in other organs include the skin (assessment of bioavailability and bioequivalence of topically applied dermatological drug products), and monitoring of glucose concentrations in patients with diabetes (intravascular or subcutaneous probe placement). The latter may even be incorporated into an artificial pancreas system for automated insulin administration.\n\nMicrodialysis has also found increasing application in environmental research, sampling a diversity of compounds from waste-water and soil solution, including saccharides, metal ions, organic acids, and low molecular weight nitrogen. Given the destructive nature of conventional soil sampling methods, microdialysis has potential to estimate fluxes of soil ions that better reflect an undisturbed soil environment.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2279151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279151", "title": "Bullace", "text": "Bullace\n\nThe bullace is a variety of plum. It bears edible fruit similar to those of the damson, and like the damson is considered to be a strain of the \"insititia\" subspecies of \"Prunus domestica\". Although the term has regionally been applied to several different kinds of \"wild plum\" found in the United Kingdom, it is usually taken to refer to varieties with a spherical shape, as opposed to the oval damsons.\n\nUnlike nearly all damsons, bullaces may be either \"white\" (i.e. yellow or green) or \"black\" (i.e. blue or purple) in colour, and ripen up to six weeks later in the year. Though smaller than most damsons, bullaces are much larger than the closely related sloe. Their flavour is usually rather acidic until fully ripe.\n\nThe name probably originates from the Old French ', meaning \"sloe\", via Middle English '. Wild plums were formerly given the related name \"bullies\" in parts of Lincolnshire. They were also known as the \"bullum-tree\" in Cornwall; \"bullison\" in Wiltshire; \"scad\" in Sussex; and as the \"wild damson\" in Yorkshire. The similar word \"\" was used in the Welsh language.\n\nLike other varieties of \"Prunus domestica\", the bullace may have had its origin in hybrids between the sloe (\"Prunus spinosa\") and cherry plum (\"Prunus cerasifera\"), though there is also evidence that \"domestica\" was solely descended from the latter. Another theory suggests that the bullace developed (or was selected) over time from the sloe, without the involvement of \"Prunus cerasifera\". \"Prunus insititia\" is still, however, occasionally regarded as a separate (entirely native) species. It is possible that the bullace is genuinely native to Great Britain: the horticulturalist Harold Taylor, in his book \"The Plums of England\", described it as \"the only truly English plum\", observing that all other hybrid varieties of plum and damson had at least some non-native origins.\n\nAlthough once cultivated, and familiar to gardeners of the Tudor period, the bullace gradually fell out of favour as newer, larger or sweeter types of damson or plum displaced it, and it hung on at the fringes of cultivation. Its hardiness meant that, like the damson, it was occasionally planted as a windbreak or hedging tree, and until the 20th century was regarded as valuable for providing fruit very late in the year.\n\nFour main varieties of bullace are recognised in England: the White, Black, Shepherd's and Langley. The bullace may be found as a small tree, growing to around 8 metres in height, or as a bush, distinguishable from the sloe by its broader leaves and small number or complete absence of spines. There is, however, a wide variation between trees in different districts due to hybridization and local selection. Bullaces generally ripen in October-November, rather later than other types of plum, and fruit heavily. They may sometimes be found growing wild in woods or hedgerows, particularly near old farmhouses; others may be found in old gardens or orchards, or can still be purchased from some nurseries.\n\nThe Black Bullace is the common \"wild\" bullace of woods in England, recognisable by its small, round black or dark purple fruit. It is sometimes classified as \"insititia\" var. \"nigra\". It can be quite astringent until very ripe, or subject to a slight frost; a larger variety known as the \"New Black Bullace\" was later developed from it.\n\nThe White Bullace, sometimes classified as \"insititia\" var. \"syriaca\", has small, yellowish fruit, with greenish flesh. A very old variety, it was once known in Cambridgeshire and Essex by the name \"cricksies\" or \"crickses\", formed on an earlier plural \"creeks\", and probably originating in Anglo-Norman \"\". It was grown in large quantities in Norfolk in the 19th century, for use in preserving or cooking; Hogg described the flesh as \"firm, juicy, sweet and subacid\". It is also occasionally referred to as the \"Golden Bullace\".\n\nThis variety has relatively large round fruit, ripening by October to a grass green or yellowish green colour, with small red spots on the sunward side. It was formerly common in Kent and Essex and may still be found in hedgerows in eastern England.\n\nThe Langley Bullace, or \"Veitch's Black Bullace\", is by far the newest variety, being first raised in 1902 by the Veitch nurseries at Langley, Berkshire. It was a cross between an Orleans plum and the Farleigh damson, and is therefore not considered a true bullace in some sources. This is the largest variety, and when ripe - which occurs in November - is much the sweetest.\n\nOther names have appeared, but are likely to represent either the above broad types or variations of them; Abercrombie and Mawe, writing in 1779, described three types of bullace, the \"white\", \"black\" and \"red\". Loudon also mentions a black, white and red bullace, as well a double flowered variety \"flore pleno\". Hogg described an \"Essex Bullace\", which appears in all respects identical to the Shepherd's Bullace, and a \"Royal Bullace\", said to bear very large, yellow-green fruit. A \"New Large Bullace\", probably synonymous with the Royal Bullace, was occasionally mentioned, described as very similar to the Shepherd's Bullace but with larger leaves, many of which were glandless, a much more vigorous habit, and lighter cropping.\n\nBullaces are often stated to only be suitable for cooking. As well as being used for stewing and making various fruit preserves, they were also traditionally used to make fruit wine, and a bullace pie was stated to be one of the usual centrepieces of a 19th-century harvest home supper in the south of England. However, some bullaces are palatable raw when sufficiently ripe.\n\n"}

It broadcasts to the East Riding of Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire.\n\nIt is the AM sister station of Viking FM, playing classic pop and rock music from the 1960s to the 1980s.\n\nThe station was formed on 31 October 1988 when Viking Radio split its 1161 (originally said \"Double-One-Six-One\") medium wave frequency from its FM service. It has had many name changes, including \"Viking Gold\", \"Classic Gold\" (not to be confused with the service operated by UBC), \"Classic Gold Radio\", \"Great Yorkshire Gold\" and \"Great Yorkshire Radio\". Most of these formats, with the exception of \"Viking Gold\", shared programmes with the AM stations of the \"Yorkshire Radio Network\".\n\nAt the start of 1997, new owners Emap decided to scrap the regional Classic Gold station and replaced it with local stations under the brandname of \"Magic\", with a new format of Hot Adult Contemporary music. Magic 1161 launched on 12 February 1997.\n\nIn December 2001, EMAP decided that it was more economical for the Magic network to share off-peak programmes and in line with the other Magic AM stations began networking between 10am-2pm, and 7pm-6am. During these hours it was simply known as Magic, although there were local commercial breaks, and local news on the hour.\n\nIn January 2003, after a sharp decline in listening, the station ceased networking with the London station, Magic 105.4, and a regional northern network was created with Magic 1152 at the hub at the weekend and the Newcastle station of the same name during the week. During networked hours, local adverts are aired, as well as a local news summary on the hour.\n\nFrom July 2006, more networking was introduced across the Northern Magic AM network, leaving weekday breakfast as the only locally produced show. The local show was replaced with a regional breakfast programme from Leeds, which ran from March 2013 to December 2014.\n\nOn 5 January 2015, Magic 1161 was rebranded as Viking 2 as part of a revamp of the Bauer network and the station is now entirely networked with the other Bauer AM stations in the North although local news, weather and travel continue to be broadcast as opt-outs during the day.\n\nOn 7 January 2019, Viking 2 rebranded as Greatest Hits East Yorkshire & North Lincolnshire.\n\nThe station carries a full schedule of networked programming, produced and broadcast from Greatest Hits Radio's Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham studios.\n\nOther output originates from Clyde 2 in Glasgow and Bauer's Golden Square headquarters in Soho.\n\nIn East Yorkshire & North Lincolnshire, GHR broadcasts local news bulletins hourly from 6am to 7pm on weekdays and from 7am to 1pm at weekends. Headlines are broadcast on the half-hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside traffic bulletins. National bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried at other times.\n\n"}

Most of Villaflor's early bouts' records were not well kept, therefore, although October 1, 1966 appears to have been the date of Villaflor's professional debut, this is not known with certainty, and neither is the location where the fight took place. Villaflor ran a record of twelve wins without a loss, with eight knockouts before he suffered his first loss, against Roger Boy Pedrano, by an eight-round decision in a fight apparently held on July 1, 1967, at the Philippines.\n\nAfter winning his next fight, he faced Pedrano and again lost by decision, in another fight without much documented data.\n\nVillaflor had his first documented fight on February 1, 1968, at Manila. Villaflor and Rod Sario had a technical draw (tie) after four rounds. Villaflor would have a total of seven draws in his professional boxing career, a relatively large number in that category.\n\nAlthough Villaflor won nine, lost two and drew two of his next thirteen bouts, his fighting in the Philippines exclusively represented a problem for him to become known overseas. He began the 1970s by losing two ten-round decisions in a row, to Pedro Martinez on March 7, 1970 and to Alfredo Avila, six weeks later.\n\nVillaflor won his next seventeen bouts, however, eleven of them by knockout. He moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, so he could get more exposure in the United States and the rest of the world. Villaflor liked Honolulu so much that he still lives in the Hawaiian city. He beat Rafael López by a first-round knockout, on April 13, 1971, in what represented both his first fight in Honolulu and also his first fight abroad. He also beat former world champion Raul Cruz, beaten by knockout in ten rounds, November 11, 1971.\n\nOn April 25, 1972, Villaflor was given his first opportunity at a world title, when faced with WBA and Lineal Jr. Lightweight champion Alfredo Marcano of Venezuela. Villaflor became world champion by defeating Marcano by a fifteen-round unanimous decision at Honolulu.\n\nVillaflor then engaged in a series of non-title bouts, including one against Roberto Durán world title challenger Jimmy Robertson, beaten by Villaflor by a ten-round decision on November 15 of that year. Prior to that, he had retained the title with a fifteen-round draw against Victor Echegaray, on September 25.\n\nOn March 12, 1973, Villaflor lost his title for the first time, being beaten on points by Japan's Kuniaki Shibata over fifteen rounds in Honolulu. But, after two knockout wins, Villaflor had a rematch with Shibata, also in Honolulu, and he recovered the WBA world Jr. Lightweight championship with a first-round knockout, on October 17, also at Honolulu.\n\nNext for Villaflor was a widely expected fight across Asia, as he met Japan's top rated challenger, Apollo Yoshio, on March 14, 1974, at Toyama. The two boxers fought to a fifteen-round draw. After another non-title win, Villaflor met future world champion Yasutsune Uehara, on August 24 in Honolulu, knocking out Uehara in the second round. After that, Villaflor made his mainland United States debut, when he and perennial challenger Ray Lunny III fought to a six-round technical draw on November 14, a cut on Villaflor's head which had been caused by a headbutt being the determining factor for the fight to end with such result.\n\nVillaflor retained the title twice more, then met Samuel Serrano for the first time, on April 13, 1976, in Honolulu, and the two combatants fought to a fifteen-round draw. The draw was so controversial that the WBA ordered an immediate rematch. After winning a non-title bout by knockout, Villaflor traveled to Puerto Rico for the rematch, held on November 16, at Hiram Bithorn stadium, in San Juan. Serrano outpointed Villaflor over fifteen rounds in what turned out to be Villaflor's last professional bout.\n\nHe is currently involved in managing other boxers' careers. Villaflor is the Sergeant At Arms for the Hawaii State Senate, a position to which he is appointed by a vote of the Senate each year. In that capacity he was a co-defendant in a lawsuit stemming from his unlawful arrest and alleged assault on Mitch Kahle, a protester against the Legislature's violation of the First Amendment doctrine of the Separation of Church and State. Kahle was acquitted of all charges against him on April 29, 2010, and is currently pursuing legal action against everyone involved in his arrest, both in their official capacities and as private persons.\n\n\n"}

She attended high school at an all-girls state school. She studied German and Political Science at university. She wrote her PhD thesis about \"The Cruel Woman: Female Images in the Writing of Marquis de Sade and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch.\" After passing the state examination she graduated in 1978.\n\nDuring her studies at university in the mid-1970s she began working with video. She worked as a media associate in Marburg, Frankfurt, and Berlin.\nIn 1984, Treut earned her doctorate degree in philology from the University of Marburg. That same year she founded Hyena Filmproduktion together with Elfi Mikesch, and began producing, writing, and directing independent feature films. The following year Treut made her feature film debut with \"\", a film that explored sadomasochistic sex practices. Treut also spent time in America during the 1980s. Traveling and working in San Francisco and New York City, Treut met and worked with Annie Sprinkle and Werner Schroeter, while also producing some of her own films. These relationships led to the films \"Annie\" (documentary short), \"My Father is Coming\" and \"Encounter with Werner Schroeter\" (documentary short).\n\nFamous for her queer films, Treut also makes documentaries. Her films have explored many interests around the world. The subject matter varies from film to film; whether queer-themed, or about one woman's efforts to help street kids in Rio de Janeiro, or about the culinary arts of Taiwan—her documentaries find interesting, real people to focus on.\n\nThroughout her film career Treut has been involved in several aspects of filmmaking, including acting, directing, producing, writing, filming, and editing. Her film catalogue includes over 20 films, both in her native language German and in English.\n\n\nTreut has been recognized on several occasions for her excellence in filmmaking, having taken home the following awards for her work: \n\nTreut has been involved with \"PROJETO UERE\", an organization founded by Yvonne Bezzerra de Mello, the subject of Treut's film \"Warrior of Light\". \"PROJETO UERE\" is a program created to help the street kids of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nTreut's most recent film, \"Of Girls and Horses\", focuses on the relationship that develops between 16-year-old high school dropout Alex and upper-class Kathy at a horse farm. Alex works at the horse farm for a school internship, supervised by lesbian riding instructor Nina. In an interview from the website Afterellen, conducted by Marcie Bianco, Treut reveals her intentions for the movie and the message she hopes it will send. She says, \"In this film, I just wanted to picture [the insecurities that queer teenagers face] and find a way of coming out of it...\".\n\nIn \"The Raw and the Cooked\", Treut travels around Taiwan, exploring its rich culinary tradtitions and their relationship to the island's unique culture. The film also seeks out people who attempt to create a sustainable food system through innovative projects. \nThe film had its world premiere at the Culinary Film section of the Berlin International Film Festival on February 12, 2012.\n\nIn a book written by Ya-chen Chen, an author known for her work regarding Chinese Feminism, there is a section of the book that mentions Monika Treut’s film, Ghosted. Chen praises Treut for her ability to, “…exceed not only the essentialist restriction of physiology but also the corporeality that ghosts lose after deaths…” Chen also says that Treut did a good job at portraying a variety of different Chinese Religions and their beliefs regarding ghosts.\n\nSince 1990, Treut has been teaching, lecturing and curating retrospectives of her work at colleges across the United States (Vasser, Hollins, Dartmouth), at art institutes (SFAI) and at universities (IU Bloomington, UI Chicago, UC San Diego and Cornell U ).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2279178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279178", "title": "Absurd (band)", "text": "Absurd (band)\n\nAbsurd is a German National Socialist black metal band, and has been classified as a \"right-wing extremist\" group by the Thuringian Landesbehörde für Verfassungsschutz.\n\nThe band was founded in Sondershausen by Hendrik Möbus (also known as Randall Flagg / Jarl Flagg Nidhögg / JFN) and Sebastian Schauseil in 1992, with a third member, Andreas Kirchner, joining at a later stage.\n\nTheir lyrics concern nationalistic, pagan (Hendrik Möbus is the founder of the Deutsche Heidnische Front), pro-heathen revivalist Germanic, and anti-Judeo-Christian themes.\n\nThe band achieved infamy because its original members (now no longer in the band since 1999) murdered the 15-year-old Sandro Beyer in 1993. The canonical motive is that Beyer was privy to an illicit relationship of Schauseil's with a married woman, and had been spreading rumours about this and other activities of the band. On 29 April in Sondershausen, the then-17-year-old band members Möbus, Schauseil, and Kirchner enticed Beyer to a meeting, and strangled him there with an electrical cord. Kirchner, in a now infamous quotation, was reported as saying: \"Oh shit—now I’ve completely ruined my life.\" Schauseil claimed to have heard a voice in his head saying the nonsensical phrase \"\"Kuster Maier\"\", which he interpreted as \"\"Töte Beyer\"\" (\"Kill Beyer\").\n\nIn prison, Möbus (born January 20, 1976) was able to carry on with the band under the temporary name \"In Ketten\" (German for \"In Chains\"). After the murder in Sondershausen, Absurd became a cult band within Neo-Nazi groups. A live album was recorded in prison and had since been released on vinyl. The tape \"Thuringian Pagan Madness\" shows on its cover the grave of the murdered Sandro Beyer, and inside says: \"The cover shows the grave of Sandro B. murdered by horde ABSURD on 29.04.93 AB\".\n\nThe band members were released on parole in 1998, because they had been under eighteen when they had committed their crime. Shortly after release, Möbus violated the terms of his parole when at a concert he performed the Hitler salute, which is illegal in Germany. Hendrik and his brother Ronald \"Wolf\" Möbus also posed together in a series of photographs at Auschwitz death camp, holding up nazi banners inside a gas chamber and outside barracks. His parole was consequently revoked. He managed to flee to the United States, where he met William Luther Pierce, but was captured there. During his stay in America he also got in a conflict about money with some of his contacts who he stayed with for some time, one of them being the then neo-Nazi pagan occultist Nathan Pett, who later left the far right scene, and was apparently beaten with a hammer and threatened with a pistol by two persons. At first this was just a rumour but Möbus later admitted in an interview for a neo-nazi site that the incident had taken place. He was arrested by U.S. marshals. In 2001, after his request for asylum was denied, he was sent back to prison for the remaining three years for murder. For mocking his victim and for the Hitler salute he was sentenced to a further twenty-six months. On 15 May 2003 he was again sentenced to four years in prison. Möbus is today free and runs his own music label, called Darker Than Black Records (founded in 1994), which distributes NSBM albums and merchandise on an organized scale since 2007. Antifascist Action in Germany has organized at least one demonstration in late 2014 to protest against the racist music shop Möbus owns together with one other person. Two cars belonging to Möbus were damaged in an arson which the Antifascist Action Germany claimed responsibility for, during a campaign in Berlin where there was also posters with Möbus face and personal information on put up, and graffiti with messages against him and the label. When released from the last prison sentence Möbus appeared on stage during a neonazi live gig, but did not play anything.\n\nSchauseil is still involved with the underground metal scene; he performed between 1999 and 2004 with the folk-influenced nationalist band Halgadom, the black metal project Wolfsmond (also featuring bassplayer Unhold, who currently plays drums in Absurd), and the neofolk band In Acht und Bann. He has distanced himself from National Socialism and politics in general, as evidenced by the current direction of Wolfsmond and as stated in an interview he conducted with \"Vampire Magazine\".\n\nIn 2002 Pantheon (USA) released a tribute album to Möbus, called \"Jarl die Freiheit\" (‘Jarl of Freedom’).\n\nIn 2019, Hendrik Möbus was at a Black Metal gig in Denmark, and was seen handing out flyers promoting a nazi event. This led to him being confronted by parts of the audience, and also asked by the organizers to put down the propaganda. A fight erupted and Möbus was beaten by a group of unidentified people from the audience who left the gig afterwards but returned and threw pepperspray at Möbus, which interrupted the show for a while.\n\nThe band Absurd has continued in existence since 1999, going through many changes of personnel, and losing all of its original members. The leader is Wolf, Hendrik's brother, with Sebastian Schauseil performing the occasional clean vocal part on releases such as \"Asgardsrei\" (1999), \"Werwolfthron\" (2001), and \"Totenlieder\" (2002).\n\nThe demos and the first album \"Facta Loquuntur\" have strong Oi! and Rock Against Communism (RAC) influences. Their musical idols were bands like Mercyful Fate/King Diamond, Manowar, Danzig and especially Der Fluch, a band covered by Absurd on both \"Der fünfzehnjährige Krieg\" and the split release \"Weltenfeind\", whereas the Scandinavian bands were no significant musical or lyrical influence. On the other hand, the band called itself a black metal band from the very beginning; in an interview with the pupil magazine of his school, Hendrik Möbus said Absurd would play the hardest, rawest and most ingenious black metal in Germany Michael Moynihan and Didrik Søderlind classified the band's early recordings \"more akin to ’60s garage punk than some of the [...] Black Metal of their contemporaries\", and according to Christian Dornbusch and Hans-Peter Killguss, the second demo \"Death from the Forest\" had no similarities to black metal neither of the first nor the second wave, but was rather a mixture of primitive hard rock and punk rock elements. Due to its musical dilettantism, the band was not taken seriously by black metallers for a long time. In an ad in \"Sub Line\" magazine, the same demo was praised as \"unholy, hard guitar rock, wild and boisterous; for all the dark souls out there\" (\"unheiliger, harter Gitarrenrock, wild und ungestüm; für all die schwarzen Seelen dort draußen\"). The \"Mansion of Metal\" site classified it as \"essentially crappy punk rock/RAC\" and claims the \"Thuringian Pagan Madness\" demo to have black metal influences.\n\nHendrik Möbus called the \"Asgardsrei\" EP the band's first holistic piece of work, adjusted in concept and layout as well, and the band's step away from its former musical dilettantism; however,he still described some of it as dilettante, and Ronald Möbus criticised the final mixing.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The film, which is the second installment in the \"Tales for All (Contes Pour Tous)\" series of films by Les Productions la Fête, stars Mathew Mackay, Siluck Saysanasy, Alison Darcy, and Michael Hogan.\n\nMichael Baskin is an average 11-year-old boy. His father, Billy Baskin, is a struggling artist and temporary sole caregiver of the children while his wife attends to the needs of her recently deceased father in Australia. Upon hearing the news that an abandoned mansion has recently burned down, Michael and his friend Connie decide to explore the remains. Outside the mansion, Connie dares Michael to take a look inside, leading to a frightening encounter with the ghosts of its homeless inhabitants who had died in the fire. Michael does not know this yet, but his fearsome run in with the ghosts has given him a mysterious illness simply known as \"The Fright\". Michael wakes up the next morning to find out that \"The Fright\" has made him lose all of his hair. After a failed attempt with a wig (his wig was pulled off by an older boy during a fight in a soccer game), the ghosts visit Michael in his sleep and give him the recipe of a magical formula for hair growth, the main ingredient of which is peanut butter. Michael's first attempt to make the formula is thwarted when his father and sister think he is making something to ingest (rather than use topically) and dispose of it.\n\nThe ghosts return the following night, giving themselves a second chance to pay him back for giving his money to some homeless people, and also give Michael special instruction not to add too much peanut butter, as it will end in dreadful results. Michael successfully makes the formula this time, but ignores their instructions not to overdo the peanut butter, and wakes up the next morning to find that his new hair has already begun to grow. After only a few minutes, Michael has grown a full head of hair. Suspicious of his fast growing follicles, Connie confronts Michael about his unusual ability. When Michael reveals to him his concoction, Connie decides to apply some to his pubic area, in an attempt to create the illusion that he's going through puberty. Connie soon discovers that the joke is on him. Pretty soon, Michael and Connie's hair grows to such lengths that it has become a nuisance for the school and their classmates, resulting in their suspensions. While Michael frantically searches for a solution, Connie discovers that the hair will stop growing by yelling at it.\n\nThe art teacher at Michael's school, simply called the Signor, frightens children and forbids them from using their imagination. After getting fired from the school, the Signor finds out about Michael's condition and kidnaps him (and many other neighborhood children) to make magic paint brushes from Michael's ever-growing hair, in which he subdues Michael with a knockout drug. The kidnapped children are put to work under tough conditions. \"We have to make 500 brushes a day, or we don't eat!\" The paintbrushes are so powerful that they paint whatever their user imagines without need for detail or neatness. Connie, and Michael's sister, Suzie, discover the Signor's magical paintbrush factory and try to rescue Michael and the other kids. Connie tries to use force, but he is overpowered by Signor and his dog James. Instead, Connie tricks the Signor into painting a picture of the abandoned mansion. Connie then dares him to investigate inside, leading \"The Fright\" to be passed on from Michael to the Signor. The Signor, now bald, escapes from the haunted house and chases the children, locking them up. Just as Connie is about to escape with Michael, Susan and their dad find the factory and the Signor is arrested by the local police. The film ends with the family reunited as the mother has returned home, and Michael's hair has stopped growing out of control.\n\n\nThe Peanut Butter Solution has been released on home video numerous times.\n\nIn the United States, the film had been released only on VHS (through New World Video, Anchor Bay, and Starmaker Entertainment) until 2019 [see below].\n\nIn Canada, the film was released on DVD in 2006, as part of box set with five other Tales for All films. Another box set, with every Tales for All movie, was released in 2011. In 2012, the movie was released separately. All of these DVD releases were in French only.\n\nIn 2013, the movie was transferred to high definition from the original 35mm camera negative. This transfer was used for a Blu-ray release in Canada on April 11, 2017, and includes both French and English language tracks.\n\nOn December 10, 2019, Severin Films released it for the first time on DVD/Blu-ray in the US as the first proffering of their new Severin Kids label.\n\n"}

It lost its status as a Mechanised infantry regiment in 2010 in line with the rationalisation of resources. As a reserve unit, it has a status roughly equivalent to that of a British Army Reserve or United States Army National Guard unit.\n\nThe Regiment was formed as the \"D’Urban Volunteer Guard\", in May 1854.\nIn 1859 the unit became the \"Durban Rifle Guard\".\nIn 1873 the unit became known as the \"Royal Durban Rifles\".\nIn 1889 the unit became known as the \"Natal Royal Rifles (Left half Battalion)\".\nIn 1895 it became the \"Durban Light Infantry\".\n\nOn the constitution of the \"Union Defence Force\" in 1912, the Unit became the \"Durban Light Infantry\", renamed the \"1st Infantry, (Durban Light Infantry)\". In consequence the Unit was permitted to add to its badge \"\"Primus in Africa\"\", the motto retained by the unit today in recognition of its foundation.\n\nIn 1935, King George V conferred the title \"Royal\" on two Regiments being the \"Royal Durban Light Infantry\" and the \"Royal Natal Carbineers\", as a recognition of their seniority and service.\n\nIn 1961 with the formation of the Republic, the title \"Royal\" was considered incompatible and the Regiment reverted to being the \"Durban Light Infantry\".\n\nAt the centre of the 'Regimental Colour' is the badge worn by the Regiment since 1961. It consists of the recognised \"Infantry Silver Bugle\" with tassels and a shield with two wildebeest and a \"crown\". The wildebeest are symbolic of the Province, while the crown retained as a \"traditional device\" is reminiscent of the \"title \"Royal\"\" bestowed upon the Regiment by King George V in 1935.\n\nThe words \"\"Primus in Africa\"\" are superimposed within a scroll.\n\nThe crest is composed of a lion passant guardant on three mounds – the centre mound being charged with a pyramid. The lion is symbolic of strength, courage and fortitude. The three mounds are symbolic of the battles fought in World War II – Monte Stanco, Monte Peza and Monte Sole/Caprara. The pyramid is symbolic of the 1941–1943 Egyptian Campaign.\n\nThe \"garland\" which surrounds the coloured badge comprises the Thistle of Scotland, the Tudor Rose of England and the Shamrock of Ireland – symbols taken from the old colour – and the other two flowers, the Protea, the National flower of South Africa, and the Strelitzia, the flower of Natal (now KwaZulu-Natal).\n\n\nThe regimental headquarters of the DLI has been declared as a National Monument.\n\nThe Regiment is being deployed in Africa, Burundi, DRC; in support of the United Nations and African Union mandate\n\nAll members of the Regiment are volunteers, with employment in the civilian roles, they fulfil their responsibilities and duties on top of their duties and responsibilities to their Families and Employers.

As a reserve unit, it has a status roughly equivalent to that of a British Army Reserve or United States Army National Guard unit.\n\nThe Natal Carbineers Regiment traces its roots to 1854 but it was formally raised on 15 January 1855 and gazetted on 13 March of that year.\n\nIn 1913, the Regiment’s two ‘wings’ became known as the First and Second Mounted Rifles (Natal Carbineers) and in 1934 they re-assumed the name 1st and 2nd Natal Carbineers.\n\nThe following year, they became the Royal Natal Carbineers, a title which remained in use until the country became a republic in 1961.\n\nSince its inception, the Natal Carbineers have participated in every campaign in KwaZulu-Natal. Their baptism of fire came during the Langalibalele Rebellion in 1873 where they suffered their first casualties in action in the Drakensberg. Subsequently, during the Anglo-Zulu War, the Carbineers suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January 1879.\n\nThe Natal Carbineers participated in the invasion of Zululand in January 1879, and on 22 January, 23 members of the Regiment perished in the famous battle of Isandlwana. The unit was subsequently relegated to garrison duties at Landman’s Drift on the Mzinyathi, or Buffalo River.\n\nIn September 1899, the Natal Carbineers were mobilized for active service in the British campaign to subdue the Boer republics of the Transvaal and Orange Free State. The Regiment served until October 1900, when the Natal Volunteer Forces were demobilized. Some men continued their service in the Volunteer Composite Regiment until the end of the war in May 1902.\n\nThe Natal Carbineers saw extensive service in the Natal (or Bambatha) Uprising of 1906. From February to July 1906, the Regiment participated in the numerous sweeps and drives through the mountainous terrain of Zululand, as the Natal Colonial forces sought to trap and destroy the elusive ‘rebel’ warriors. The Carbineers were present at the decisive battle at Mhome Gorge on 10 June, where the back of the uprising was broken.\n\nThe Natal Carbineers, then known as the 1st and 2nd Mounted Rifles, were mobilized on 23 August 1914. Both battalions saw service in German South-West Africa, while the 2nd Battalion was also involved in the suppression of the short-lived Afrikaner Rebellion of 1914.\n\nOn 17 July 1940 the 1st (Royal) Natal Carbineers sailed for Kenya as part of the 1st South African Brigade. Their destination was the Italian colonial empire in East Africa. For the next 10 months the Regiment participated in the South African advance through Italian Somaliland and Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), until Italian resistance was broken at Amba Alagi in May 1941.\n\nFollowing the fall of Italian East Africa in May 1941, the 1st South African Brigade was dispatched to North Africa to confront the joint Italian-German forces in the see-saw offensives across Egypt and Libya. The Carbineers earned numerous individual battle honours between June 1941 and January 1943 when it sailed home for a well-earned leave.\n\nThe 1st Royal Natal Carbineers landed at Taranto, Italy, on 20 April 1944, just in time for the latter phases of the battles for Cassino. From there the Regiment fought its way up the Italian boot, through Rome, until final victory in May 1945.\n\nThe Natal Carbineers saw service in a counter-insurgency capacity in northern Namibia (South-West Africa) for three months from August 1976, and thereafter in numerous modular deployments over the next decade.\n\nThe regiment has been active since 1994 in internal duties in support of the police as well as border protection. They have also contributed to external peace-keeping missions to inter alia MONUSCO in the DRC.\n\nIn August 2019, 52 Reserve Force units had their names changed to reflect the diversity of the SANDF. \n\nGoing forward this units name was changed to the Ingobamakhosi Carbineers.\n\n\n\n"}

The creation of the lake and its outlet is attributed to a post-glacial isostatic rebound, which resulted in uplift of the land. As is common in Finnish lakes, the water color of the lake is dark on account of the high proportion of bogs present in the catchment of the drainage basin that drains humic substances.\n\nPielinen Lake is in the northernmost part of Karelia, which is the land of the Karelian peoples, a Northern European area of historical significance not only for Finland, but also for Russia and Sweden. Apart from the lake, several attractions on the shores of the lake are the Koli National Park known for its scenic beauty in summer and the winter sports of skiing, the whitewater rafting centre at Ruunaa Hiking Center, the active centres of Lieksa and Nurmes.\n\nThe lake is located at an elevation of in the North Karelia region in eastern Finland. It has a water spread area of and a shore length of , and is bound within geographical coordinates of 62°54–63°33N and 29°07–30°14E. The maximum length is and the width varies from .

The water courses that drain into the lake are the Haapajarvi-Valtimojarvi and Saramojoki from its north-west direction, Viekinjoki River and Lieksanjoki River from the north-east side, and flows from the small drainage basin of the Juvanjoki River into the west. The lake has many islands such the Paalasmaa (27.2 km), Kynsisaari (), Porosaari (), Toinensaari (), Hattusaari (), Koveronsaari () and Retusaari (). The lake drains, unregulated, southward through the Pielis River into the larger Saimaa Lake of the large Vuoksi watercourse, which is used for timber floating. The variation in water level is limited to ; water transport on the lake is thus substantial. The catchment of the lake is densely forested, particularly on its rugged western shore, which is capped by Koli hill. At (), the point is the highest mountain in the catchment.\n\nThe shores have a diverse landscape including barren lands, rock faces, exposed soils and beaches.

The herbaceous vegetation in marsh areas consists of various grasses (\"Poaceae\"), sedge (\"Carex sp.\") and moss (\"Sphagnum sp.\"). The agricultural crops grown in the area are barley, oat, grass and potato, which are mainly used for feeding domestic animals. It is, however, reported that agricultural use is on the decline. The primary industries in the basin are related to milk, meat and wood. The secondary industries in the basin consist of cardboard, sawed goods, milk products and rubber products.\n\nThe periphery of the lake has a large network of roads and, during winter when the lake freezes, an ice road is the short route from one bank to the other.\n\nRoad 73 passes through the Uimaharju on the southern side of the lake and goes through very scenic spots to the east end. The south end of the lake has a lock system at Pielisjoki, which connects to the Saimaa Lake.\n\nThe climatic data has been recorded at the two major towns in the lake basin, namely the Lieksa and Juuka during the period between 1931 and 1960. At Lieksa, the average annual rainfall was with mean minimum and maximum temperatures recorded as (December) and (July).

Other fish species still found are: \"Perca fluviatilis\", \"Esox lucius\", \"Rutilus rutilus\", \"Coregonus albula\", \"C. mulesum\", \"C. lavaretus\", Lota lota, Abramis brama, \"Stizostedion lucioperca\" and \"Salmo trutta lacustris\".\n\nThe lake is categorized as mesotrophic. However, there are pockets of eutrophication zones. Bogs dominate the basin area, which causes flow of humic substances into the lake water. This has resulted in the lake water attaining a dark colour. This feature is said to be a typical characteristic of the lakes in Finland. Other parameters of chemical and physical properties of the lake waters measured relate to transparency (in meters), pH value, dissolved oxygen, COD, and concentrations of chlorophyll, nitrogen and phosphorus.\n\nThe lake is used for navigation, particularly for the transportation of timber; timber floated in the Pielinen Lake is estimated at 1.2 million tonnes per year. Other uses are as a fishery resource (the fish catch in 1981 was reported at 644 tonnes), fish products of vendace and burbot, and for recreational purposes to promote tourism. Swimming, sport-fishing and yachting are common attractions. The lake provides water to the extent of per day to industries and power plants.\n\nSiltation is not an issue. However, toxic contaminants are regularly monitored including mercury, zinc, copper and DDT to ensure that the standards prescribed under food safety standards, or tolerance limits for the safe use of water, are fully maintained. There is very limited pollution from sewage, municipal wastes and industrial uses, as adequate standards for sewage treatment and sanitary facilities are maintained.\n\nThe basic National law that governs the lake and its basin is the Water law (1961, revised 1987) of Finland. The governmental ministries and agencies of Finland responsible for the complete upkeep of the lake are the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the National Board of Waters and Environment.\n\nTwo major attractions around Pielinen Lake are Koli National Park and Paalasmaa Island.\n\nThe Koli National Park is studded with islands, which are glorified in the Finnish national anthem as an important Finnish symbol. It was declared a National Park in 1991, after an intense debate between the environmentalist lobby and the owners of the land property over the location of the Hotel Koli, which stands at the top of its namesake hill. This park and its environs, which spread over a width of , has inspired Finnish artists Pekka Halonen and Eero Järnefelt to create artistic paintings with its scenic beauty. It is approachable by ferry from the mainland. As a popular winter sport resort, this park provides the adventure sports of hiking and boating during summer; it has a network of walking paths, which cover nearly . A road link is also available to the hotel from the car park at the lower level. The highest point on the hill top is called the \"Ukko-Koli,\" which is linked to another peak called the \"Akka Koli\". On the western side of \"Akka Koli\" is the \"Temple of Silence,\" which is a place for meditation. There is stone altar here and a cross mounted on the rock. Another peak close nearby is known as the \"Paha-Koli\" and to its south is the scenic view point known as \"Mäkrävaara.\" The Koli Village, within the park premises, has the information office, Internet facility and a post office. The visitor centre at the park is called the \"Luontokeskus Ukko\" (Ukko Nature Centre), where exhibitions are held on the history, nature and geology of the park. Two ski centres, used during the winter, are established here; they are known as \"Ukko-Koli\" and \"Loma-Koli\", both of which boast nine lifts and of cross country trails, with lighting along of the trail. It is one of the most accessible ski resorts in Finland. The hills here are covered with pine and birch trees.\n\nThe national park has nine basic huts and camping grounds. There are also a marina and swimming beach on the shores of the lake, where a Finnish dancing stage called the \"huvilava\" stands. Row boats are also available for rowing across the lake.\n\nThe Paalasmaa Island is the largest in the lake, with its peak rising to above mean sea level. Access to the island is through ferry services. An observatory tower stands on the island; old houses that reflect the history of the island can be seen along a trail marked \"tornille\" (to the tower).\n\nPielinen hosts an ice road, during most winters, between the villages of Koli and Vuonislahti. The ice road is long and shortens the road distance between the two villages by . The date of opening varies depending on the climatic conditions each year; the earliest the road ever opened was during the 2010-2011 winter, on the 15th day of December. Previously the winter of 1995-1996 had witnessed the earliest opening, on the 29th day of December. In the winter of 2009-2010, the road did not open until mid-January, whilst in 2008-2009 the road opened in mid-February. Helsingin Sanomat has stated that the road is probably the longest of its kind in Europe; however, this assertion is incorrect, as the Hiiumaa Ice Road in Estonia is 25 km, and is more widely believed to Europe's longest.\n\nThe asteroid 1536 Pielinen is named after the Pielinen Lake.\n"}

{"id": "2279210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279210", "title": "Sängerfest", "text": "Sängerfest\n\nSängerfest, also Sängerbund-Fest, Sängerfeste, or Saengerfest, meaning singer festival, is a competition of Sängerbunds, or singer groups, with prizes for the best group or groups. Such public events are also known as a Liederfest, or song festival. Participants number in the hundreds and thousands, and the fest is usually accompanied by a parade and other celebratory events. The sängerfest is most associated with the Germanic culture. Its origins can be traced back to 19th century Europe. Swiss composer Hans Georg Nägeli and educator Carl Friedrich Zelter, both protégés of Swiss educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, established sängerbunds to help foster social change throughout Germany and Prussia. University students began to choose the art form as an avenue for political statements. As the sängerfest concept gained popularity and spread around the world, it was adapted by Christian churches for spiritual worship services.\nEuropean immigrants brought the tradition in a non-political form to the North American continent. In the early part of the 20th century, sängerfest celebrations drew devotees in the tens of thousands, and included some United States presidents among their audiences. Sängerbunds are still active in Europe and in American communities with Germanic heritage.\n\nStudents of Swiss educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, a proponent of social reform, applied his teachings when founding some singing groups as an instrument for cultural change. One of his students was Carl Friedrich Zelter, who helped establish the sängerbund movement throughout Prussia in 1809. Pestalozzi's protégé Hans Georg Nägeli was a composer, music teacher and songbook publisher who made numerous journeys across Germany from 1819 to encourage the formation of male singing groups for social reform. Nägeli established several sängerbunds in Switzerland, which became the inspiration for the 1824 establishment of the Stuttgarter Liederkranz. Following the 1819 Carlsbad Decrees in Germany, male-only choral celebrations with hundreds or thousands of vocalists were popular with the masses and often part of political events.\n\nComposer Friedrich Silcher was directly influenced by Pestalozzi and Nägeli. He began using large choirs to express political viewpoints at least as early as 1824 when he and a group of Tübingen University students performed La Marseillaise to commemorate the storming of the Bastille. In 1827 at Plochingen, Baden-Württemberg, several male-voiced choirs combined for a regional liederfest. Sängerfests were part of the Hambach Festival of 1832.\n\nChristian church organizations known as Christlicher sängerbunds adapted the sängerfest for religious gatherings and helped spread its popularity throughout Europe, North America and Australia. They became popular in late 19th century Russia among Mennonite congregations. On 30 May 1893, a sängerfest of seven choirs was held in Rückenau in Molotschna, Ukraine. On Sunday, 29 May 1894, the all-day Russische Saengervereinigung was held in Rückenau under the direction of Polish conductor Friedrich Schweige with assistance from Aron Gerhard Sawatsky, director of the Andreasfeld Mennonite Brethren Church. Beginning on 3 May, Schweiger traveled across Russia rehearsing choirs. On 29 May there were breakfasts for attendees, an estimated 50 vocal presentations by individual choirs, prayer services and sermons, lunch for 2,000 people and afternoon snacks.\n\nMennonites established the northwest Philadelphia section of Germantown in 1683. The Philadelphia Männerchor founded by German immigrant Phillip Matthias Wohlseiffer in 1835 was the first German-American singing society organized in the United States where the sängerfest began to evolve as a form of civic entertainment. In 1836, Wohlseiffer founded the Baltimore Liederkranz, which became the first to accept women members (1838). In 1846, the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, group and the Baltimore, Maryland, group performed together at a public sängerfest. The \"\"Brooklyn Daily Eagle Almanac\"\" of 1891 listed numerous sängerbunds in the Brooklyn, New York area. On 21 June 1901, the Nord-Amerikanischer Sängerbund presented a sängerfest in Buffalo, New York, at the famous Pan-American Exposition (where 25th President William McKinley was shot by Leon Czolgosz in a reception line in September 1901). A group in Buffalo hoped to help pay the expenses of the fest by forming the Buffalo Sängerfest Company, selling 1,600 shares of stock at $25 each.\n\nIn 1838, the Cincinnati Deutscher Gesangverein was formed in Ohio, followed by the Cincinnati Deutsch Liedertafel in 1844. The Gesang und Bildungsverein Deutscher Arbeiter formed in 1846 and was the first Cincinnati group that allowed women. Groups from Ohio, Kentucky, Maryland and Indiana created the Nord-Amerikanischer Sängerbund in 1849 for a sängerfest hosted by Cincinnati, featuring the music of German composers. By 1908, it was estimated that 250,000 German Americans belonged to musical organizations, and 50,000 of those belonged to the Nord-Amerikanischer Sängerbund. The first post-Civil War sängerfest in Columbus, Ohio, took place 29 August – 1 September 1865 at Schreiner's Hall and the Opera House. Each arriving sängerbund was escorted to the hall by the Eighteenth regiment of the United States Infantry. There were an estimated 400 singers entertaining 12,000 to 15,000 attendees. The closing day was celebrated with pomp and circumstance.\n\nThe first sängerfest in Texas was held in 1853 in New Braunfels, and was held annually until 1860 when conflicting loyalties about, and participation in, the American Civil War caused a 10-year gap in the events. The San Antonio Männergesang-Verein was formed in 1847, the New Braunfels Gesangverein Germania formed in 1850, and the Austin Männerchor formed in 1852. On 4 July 1853 in San Antonio, the San Antonio Männergesang-Verein sponsored an Independence Day celebration attended by the New Braunfels Gesangverein and the Austin Männerchor. The New Braunfels Gesangverein invited everyone to meet in New Braunfels on 16–17 October 1853 for its first Texas Sängerfest. In 1854, the aggregate sängerbunds formed the Texas State Sängerbund. The San Antonio Beethoven Männerchor was organized in 1867 by Wilhelm Thielepape, assistant conductor of the San Antonio Männergesang-Verein. After the surrender of the Confederacy in 1865, Thielepape raised the Union flag of the \"Stars and Stripes\" over the historic Texan battle site and former church mission, the Alamo in San Antonio and distributed wine and songbooks. The all-male Houston Sängerbund was founded on 6 October 1883 and chartered in 1890. It affiliated itself with Der Deutsch-Texanische Sängerbund. In 1887, founding member Carl C. Zeus served as principal of the organization's German-English school.\n\n22nd and 24th President Grover Cleveland, his wife, and guests took a special train from Washington, D.C. on \"Independence Day\", 4 July 1888, forty miles northeast to see a Baltimore event. Cleveland had friends who were members of the sängerbunds. 27th President William Howard Taft attended the 1 July 1912 event in Philadelphia. On 15 June 1903, 26th President Theodore Roosevelt and Ambassador Herman Speck von Sternberg attended a sängerfest of 6,000 individual singers at Baltimore's Armory Hall. All 9,000 seats were sold out. President Roosevelt delivered an address praising the German culture and the sängerfest tradition. The Northeastern Sängerbund presented selections by composers Herman Spielter, David Melamet, Carl Friedrich Zöllner, E.S. Engelsberg, Felix Mendelssohn and Richard Wagner.\n\nWhen Newark, New Jersey, hosted the 21st National Sängerfest, held on 1–4 July 1906 in Olympic Park, 25,000 people showed up to hear the music, many arriving on chartered trains. Only a few thousand were able to get into the hall, and 2,000 were standing. Five thousand singers from more than a hundred sängerbunds representing forty cities from New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware competed for a $20,000 prize offered by Kaiser Wilhelm II. Park vendors offered souvenirs, refreshments, games, and a carousel.\n\nGermans began emigrating to Canada through Nova Scotia, where they helped found the town of Lunenburg in 1753. The sängerfests were first performed in Kitchener, Ontario, in 1862. The community events included the standard concerts and meals, with drama presentations and athletic entertainment sponsored by the local Turnvereine clubs. For the next 40 years, sängerbunds and sängerfests spread throughout Ontario. Pennsylvania Mennonites began settling in Ontario in the late 19th century. Alberta and Saskatchewan host annual Mennonite sängerfestes.\n\nIn 1916 at his sentencing for bigamy, Count Max Lymer Louden related another misdeed from his past. Louden claimed he had been hired by a group of wealthy German Americans with a secret fund of $16,000,000 to take 150,000 German reservists, disguised as sängerbunds, across the Canada–United States border for a coup d'état of Canada, on behalf of Kaiser Wilhelm II. If they drew suspicion, they were prepared to \"sing at a moment's notice.\" It was his loyalty to America, he claimed, which caused him to desert the Kaiser's singing invasion force.\n\nAlthough some local festivals were canceled or suspended during the two world wars owing to rising anti-German sentiment, the triennial Sängerfest tradition has largely survived and many communities in areas with a significant German-American population have Sängerfests today.\n\nTwo major German-American singing associations are the Nordöstlicher (North Eastern) Sängerbund and the much larger Nord-Amerikanischer (North American) Sängerbund (which, contrary to the name, also includes a few choruses from southern states).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2279213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279213", "title": "Hare and Tortoise", "text": "Hare and Tortoise\n\nHare and Tortoise is a German-style board game designed by David Parlett in 1974 and first published by Intellect Games. In 1978 it was released by Ravensburger in Germany, where the game became a huge hit. It has since sold some 2 million units in at least ten languages, including several known pirated editions. The current edition is published by Gibsons Games in the UK, Ravensburger in Germany and Rio Grande Games in the United States.\n\nThe game is based on Aesop's fable \"The Tortoise and the Hare\", in which the hare and tortoise decide to race. The tortoise wins the race by cunning while the hare fails because he overestimates himself and takes a nap during the race. The moral of the story is \"slow and steady wins the race\" which is incorporated in the game mechanic.\n\nIn Germany, there is another fable by a similar name, \"Hase und Igel\" (Hare and hedgehog), made popular by the Brothers Grimm, in which the hedgehog wins because his wife is at the finish line, and the hare mistakes her for his race opponent.\n\nThe game used a then-new (as of 1974) game mechanic. Until then, movement of pieces in race games was largely determined by the roll of dice. In Hare and Tortoise players pay carrots (the currency in the game) to move forward. The more squares the player wants to advance, the more carrots the player must pay. The cost to advance increases as triangle numbers:\n\nPlayers can earn carrots in various ways – most notably by moving backwards to designated squares (10 carrots per square). This game mechanic creates an interesting and dynamic race usually with no clear winner until the very end.\nThe players start the game with 65 carrots. The gameboard features 65 squares. There are no generic squares; instead, the board is divided in several types of squares such as hare (draw a luck card), carrots (get extra carrots for each turn skipped), etc.\n\nThe factor of luck can be eliminated completely from the game by agreement between the players not to land on \"hare\" squares.\n\nOnly one earlier \"strategic race game\" is known: Bantu, published by Parker Brothers in 1955 which, however, did not serve as a model for Hare and Tortoise.\n\nIn 1979, the game became the first winner of the now widely recognized Spiel des Jahres award. The Dutch translation won the \"Speelgoed van het jaar\" (Toy of the Year) award in 1979 when it was released.\n\nThe official world championships have been held as part of the Mind Sports Olympiad with David Parlett's endorsement 7 times.\n\n\n"}

These submarines were of advanced design, built for high underwater speed, and were known as or . The type name, was shortened to .\n\nThey were one of the fastest submarine class built during World War II, second only to Walter Type XVII closed-cycle powered submarines. Twenty-three units were ordered from the Kure Navy Yard under the 1943 construction program. Due to the deteriorating war situation, only eight boats were laid down, and only three, numbered \"I-201\", \"I-202\" and \"I-203\", were completed before the end of the war. None of them saw operational use.\n\nIn 1938 the Imperial Japanese Navy constructed an experimental high-speed submarine for evaluation purposes, which was designated for security purposes. Based on previous experience with high-speed, short-range midget submarines, Number 71 displaced only 230 tons surfaced with a length of . She could attain a submerged speed of over , making her the fastest submarine of her day. The results gained from experiments with Number 71 formed the basis for the I-201 class submarines.\n\nBy late 1942 it had become apparent to the IJN that conventional submarines were unable to survive the new ASW techniques coming into service, such as radar, HF/DF, sonar, and new depth charge projectors. New submarines were required, with a higher underwater than surface speed, quick-diving capability, quiet underwater running, and a high underwater operational radius.\n\nThe IJN General Staff made an official request for high-speed submarines in October 1943 and among the ships planned in 1944 to be constructed in 1945 were 23 \"underwater high speed submarines\" (\"Sen taka\") temporarily designated \"Ships No. 4501–4523\".\n\nThe General Staff's final requirements were stated in Order No. 295 dated 29 October 1943 to the Navy Technical Department. These included an underwater speed of which was reduced to for practical reasons. Nevertheless, they were the fastest operational submarines of World War II, outpacing even the German Type XXI.\n\nTo meet the requirement for high underwater speed the designers had to:\n\n\nThe \"I-201\" class bore little resemblance to earlier I-boats, which were optimized for long range and high surfaced speed. By contrast, the I-201 emphasized submerged performance. It featured powerful electric motors, streamlined all-welded hulls, and a large capacity battery consisting of 4,192 cells. The maximum underwater speed of was double that of contemporary American designs. The \"I-201\"s, like other Japanese submarines of the period, were also equipped with a crude snorkel, allowing underwater diesel operation while recharging batteries.\n\n\"I-201\" displaced 1,291 tons surfaced and 1,451 tons submerged. It had a test depth of . Armament consisted of four 53 cm (21 in) torpedo tubes and 10 Type 95 torpedoes. The two 25 mm anti-aircraft guns were housed in retractable mounts to maintain streamlining. The submarine was designed for mass production, with large sections prefabricated in factories and transported to the slip for final assembly.\n\nTwo submarines, \"I-201\" and \"I-203\", were seized and inspected by the US Navy at the end of the hostilities. They were part of a group of four captured submarines, including the giant and \"I-401\", which were sailed to Hawaii by US Navy technicians for further inspection.\n\nOn 26 March 1946, the US Navy decided to scuttle these captured Japanese submarines to prevent the technology from falling into the hands of the Soviet Union. On 5 April 1946, \"I-202\" was scuttled in Japanese waters. On 21 May 1946, \"I-203\" was torpedoed and sunk by submarine off the Hawaiian Islands. On 23 May 1946, \"I-201\" was torpedoed and sunk by . The Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory found the wreck of the I-201 near Hawaii using submersible craft in 2009.\nThe I-201 design and technology influenced Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force (1959).\n\nA refurbished \"I-203\" is used by the characters in the film \"Hell and High Water\" (1954).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2279223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279223", "title": "Alvin Purple", "text": "Alvin Purple\n\nAlvin Purple is a 1973 Australian sex comedy film starring Graeme Blundell, written by Alan Hopgood and directed by Tim Burstall.\n\nIt received largely negative reviews from local film critics. Despite this, it was a major hit with Australian audiences. \"Alvin Purple\" became the most commercially successful Australian film released to that time, breaking the box office record set by Michael Powell's pioneering Anglo-Australian comedy feature \"They're a Weird Mob\" (1966).\n\nThe score and title theme were composed by Australian singer-songwriter Brian Cadd.\n\nA 1974 film sequel \"Alvin Rides Again\" toned-down the sex scenes and nudity, adding more camp comedy.\n\nThis was followed by a 1976 Australian Broadcasting Commission situation comedy television series titled \"Alvin Purple\". Blundell reprised the title role in both, as well as in the 1984 movie \"Melvin, Son of Alvin\".\n\nThe film is a sex-farce which follows the misadventures of a naïve young Melbourne man Alvin Purple, whom women find irresistible. Working in door to door sales, Alvin (unsuccessfully) tries to resist legions of women who want him.\n\nAlvin is so worn-out he seeks psychiatric help to solve his problems. His psychiatrist is, of course, a woman. Alvin ultimately falls in love with the one girl who doesn't throw herself at him. She becomes a nun, and Alvin ends up a gardener in the convent's gardens.\n\nDirector Tim Burstall had worked extensively in film both in Australia and overseas in the 1960s and in the late Sixties he was closely involved in the foundation of the famous La Mama Theatre in Melbourne, established by his wife Betty Burstall. La Mama was a major focus for the new wave of Australian drama that was emerging at that time, showcasing many new plays, performance pieces and films by people such as Jack Hibberd, Alex Buzo, David Williamson, Bert Deling and Burstall himself.\n\nBurstall's first feature film, \"2000 Weeks\" was an ambitious contemporary drama about a writer, starring Scots-born actor Mark McManus (of \"Taggart\" fame) and Australian actress Jeanie Drynan, which was very notable at the time, being the first all-Australian feature film produced since Charles Chauvel's \"Jedda\" in 1954. Although it was reportedly well-received overseas, \"2000 Weeks\" was panned by local critics and it failed disastrously at the box office. The experience affected Burstall strongly and also influenced other directors and producers, including John B. Murray and Phillip Adams, who observed the hostile reaction to \"2000 Weeks\" and who as a result took their film-making in a more populist direction, as Burstall soon did himself.\n\nThis was followed by a low-budget surfing feature \"Getting Back to Nothing\" (1970). His second feature, the contemporary comedy \"Stork\" (1972) was much more successful. As well as launching the cinema career of actor Bruce Spence, who played the title role, it was the first of many successful film adaptations of plays by renowned Australian dramatist David Williamson. \"Stork\" was adapted from his play \"The Coming of Stork\", which had premiered at La Mama.\n\nIn 1972, Burstall became a partner in a new film production company, Hexagon Productions. Their first project was meant to be \"Sittin\"' based on a script from David Williamson but Williamson was still lecturing at the time as well as being inundated with other work and was not able to complete it in time (it eventually became \"Petersen\" (1974)). Burstall then decided to make an Australian version of \"The Decameron\", which was popular in cinemas at the time, and would enable Hexagon to take advantage of the new \"R\" certificate, which had been introduced to Australia in 1971. Another influence was \"Bedroom Mazurka\".\n\nBurstall considered 26 stories from writers such as Bob Ellis, Williamson, Barry Oakley and Frank Hardy before settling on \"Alvin Purple\" by Alan Hopgood.\n\nHopgood had enjoyed considerable critical success in the early 1960s with his Aussie rules football satire \"And the Big Men Fly\" and he was well-known to TV audiences at the time for his long-running role as the town doctor in the ABC's \"Bellbird\". He originally wrote \"Alvin Purple\" for the English company Tigon Films.\n\nHopgood's story was originally half comic, half serious, and Burstall originally envisioned it as a 20-minute section of a multi story picture. However he then decided to make the story strictly comic and expand it to feature length. Burstall says he rewrote much of Hopgood's script, adding many chases and the water bed sequence, and turning McBurney figure into a sex maniac. The original script played more emphasis on the relationship between Alvin and his virginal girlfriend but this was cut in the final film.\n\nThe budget was provided entirely by Hexagon - half from Roadshow, half from Burstall, Bilcock and Copping - apart from a short-term loan from the Australian Film Development Corporation, which was repaid before the film's release. Burstall cast Graeme Blundell in the lead:\nI remember Bourkie [Roadshow executive Graham Burke] saying, 'You've got to cast somebody like Jack Thompson.' I said, 'Absolutely not. You've got to cast somebody who wouldn't, on the surface, seem a stud or even particularly attractive'. I actually thought that Alvin wasn't, that the comic element was connected with having a Woody Allen or a Dustin Hoffman figure who is not very obviously sexually attractive, and the girls rushing him.

Doing this in the modern, fast-changing world is not easy, and the tagline of the film is \"When cultures meet.\"\n\n\"Bewafaa\" was produced by Boney Kapoor and the music was composed by Nadeem-Shravan. The movie was presented by Sahara Group. It is an adaptation of the Hindi film Gumrah (1963), but the treatment of the subject is more like another version of the same theme, namely the Telugu hit film Abhinandana (1988).\n\nAnjali (Kareena Kapoor) is the younger daughter of her Canadian-born mother (Nafisa Ali) and Indian father (Kabir Bedi), living in Montreal, Quebec. She shares a healthy relationship with her parents and an equally loving bond with her elder sister, Aarti (Sushmita Sen). Anjali develops an attraction toward a budding musician named Rajant Kapoor aka Raja (Akshay Kumar). Their friendship soon turns to love but Anjali keeps the relationship a secret from her parents, since Raja is not stable in his career and future as yet. Aarti assures Anjali and Raja that she will convince their parents of their true love.\n\nAarti is married to Aditya Sahani (Anil Kapoor) and the couple is soon expecting twins. Complications arise during the pregnancy and Aarti dies while giving birth to twin girls. While in mourning, and still unaware of her relationship with Raja, Anjali's parents suggest that she marry Aditya. Although she cannot bear the thought of being with anyone other than Raja, Anjali sacrifices her love for the sake of her sister's children, marries Aditya and moves with her new family to New Delhi.\nAditya, still mourning the loss of Aarti, is a business tycoon who hardly finds any time for his sister-in-law-turned wife or his two young daughters. Anjali fulfills the role of mother and wife, but cannot bridge the gap between herself and Aditya. She finds herself in a marriage that has no compatibility but only compromises. She stays in the passionless union for the sake of her nieces, whom she now considers her own.\n\nAmidst all this, one day Raja, who has since become a famous fusion singer, walks back into her life. Anjali feels torn but starts spending time with him. Raja seeks to rekindle their relationship but Anjali cannot forget her husband and children. Aditya returns from a business trip and he senses a change in Anjali, which he decides to look into by seeking the help of his friends, a flamboyant couple — Dil and Pallavi Arora (Manoj Bajpayee and Shamita Shetty). He learns the truth about Raja and Anjali's past and gives Anjali the freedom to choose between Raja and himself. Anjali ultimately chooses Aditya over Raja, not only because of her duty as a mother but also because she realises that she has come to love Aditya. Raja is heartbroken but finally has closure, and leaves to embark on a world tour.\n\n\nThe Soundtrack of Bewafaa was composed by Nadeem-Shravan and the lyrics for the songs were penned by Sameer. Singers Lata Mangeshkar, Ghulam Ali, Asha Bhosle, Kumar Sanu, Abhijeet, Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik, Sonu Nigam, Shaan & Sapna Mukherjee lent their voices for the album. There are 8 songs and 2 instrumental versions in the album. The instrumental Version of Drum Beat was the theme of Akshay Kumar character in the film, while the other instrumental piece was the instrumental version of the song titled by the same name. The recording of the songs started in 2003 and were completed by mid 2004 as said by the composers in a 2004 interview. The song \"Mera Dil\" was recorded in three versions by the composers each representing different situations and different moods in the film. The songs were chart busters and got instant popularity among the masses after their release and was very well received by even the critics mentioning that \"In The Era of remixes the albums stands out as extraordinary though traditional to the roots it does have melodies numbers that you will remember for years\". The soundtrack was listed at No.2 position in the 2004 all-time music sales chart India. The soundtrack was released in December 2004. According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 25,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's second highest-selling.\n\nThe film had an average opening, and collected Rs.10 crores. Box Office India declared the film as an average grosser.\n\nThe film got positive reviews, with the performances also getting noticed.\n"}

It was among his five personal favorite novels from his own oeuvre.\n\nWhen the galaxy's most skilled hunter is asked to use his skill to protect an important political mission, he realizes that he needs specialized aid. Thus Billy Singer must seek the shape-shifting telepathic creature only known as \"Cat\", whom he had caught and trapped for a museum. Cat agrees to help on the condition that, once the mission is over, he be given the chance to hunt his former captor. Billy accepts Cat's offer. However, Billy has been growing increasingly fatalistic in the time leading up to the story, and originally offers to let Cat kill him with no struggle. Cat, a hunter refuses, encouraging Billy to flee. Billy does so, but remains fatalistic, with Cat reading in his mind a wish to die and his foreknowledge of a final location. Billy must reconcile his personal chindi to evade Cat. Billy turns increasingly primitive, away from the technology of the day, and eventually returns to his Navajo roots. Traveling across the world using teleportation technology, he eventually comes to Canyon de Chelly where he regresses to a state where he can, or believes he can, walk in the spirit world. At the same time, a collection of psychics try to pool their powers to help him and to attack Cat. Cat is able to kill one by destroying his mind, but even so the dead man seems to linger as a part of their group consciousness.\n\nBilly is eventually able to kill Cat, but then has to face his \"chindi\", who is his deathwish, in a battle that pits him against his own shadow. The novel ends with Billy apparently united with his other self.\n\nThe dedication page reads \"To Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee\", two Navajo Tribal Police characters in detective stories by Tony Hillerman. Zelazny took much inspiration from Hillerman's stories of Navajo life and culture. Hillerman repaid the compliment by having one of his characters reading a Zelazny novel while on a stakeout.\n\nThe creature \"Cat\" is referred to as a Torglind Metamorph, last of its kind from a planet long since destroyed when its star went nova. The alien's plight parallels that of Billy Singer, who has become displaced from his people and traditions.\n\nThe book also contains several long cosmogonic poems with many beings from the Navajo pantheon in as characters.\n\nEye of Cat was nominated for the 1983 Locus Award\n\n"}

It is within the civil parish of Staintondale and the North York Moors National Park, and is north of Scarborough.\n\nA National Trail, the Cleveland Way, passes through Ravenscar, which is also the eastern terminus of the Lyke Wake Walk. The official end of the Walk is at a point where the path meets the coast road.\n\nRavenscar was the location of a late 4th century Roman signal station, part of a chain that extended along the Yorkshire coast.\n\nTo the north of the village is the old Peak alum works, now a National Trust site, but once an important part of the dyeing industry. The last alum works at Ravenscar closed down in 1871 after the invention of a synthetic dye fixer.\n\nAt the edge of the village is a disused windmill, Peak Mill, which dates from 1858.\n\nUntil the early 20th century Ravenscar was known as 'Peak' or 'The Peak'.\n\nAt the turn of the 19th–20th century, plans were made to turn the village into a holiday resort to rival nearby Scarborough. Roads were laid out, some houses were built and sewers were laid. Because of the long trek to its rocky beach, Ravenscar never achieved popularity, and the development was left unfinished – a town with sewers and streets but no houses.\n\nThe village was served by Ravenscar railway station between 1885 and 1965.\n\nIn 1540, a farm known as Peak House owned by the Beswick family occupied the site of a 5th-century Roman fort. In 1774 Raven Hall was built on the site for Captain William Childs of London, a captain in the King's Regiment of Light Dragoons, who came to Yorkshire with the army and became the owner of the Alum Works at Ravenscar. On his death in 1829 the hall passed to his daughter Ann Willis, whose family (headed by Dr Francis Willis) had become wealthy from treating George III and other royalty for their medical conditions. Ann's son, the eccentric Rev Dr Richard Willis, built the gardens and battlements which surround the house. In 1845 the property passed into the hands of William Hammond of London.\n\nHammond became a prominent local benefactor, building the village church and the windmill. He became a director of the Scarborough to Whitby railway line, insisting that it passed through his property via a tunnel and that Ravenscar should have a station.\n\nOn his widow's death in 1890 the estate was sold to the Peak Estate Company for development as a holiday resort. The house was extended for use as a hotel from 1895, and its golf course opened in 1898. It was sold by auction in 1911 after the company went bankrupt, and after several changes of ownership and use as a billet in wartime it was acquired by the present owners, who are associated with Classic Hotels.\n\nRaven Hall was once owned by Dr. Francis Willis, physician to King George III, and it is rumoured, without evidence, that King George stayed there during his treatment.\n\nThe name of the village is featured in a double episode (\"The Swords of Wayland\") of the 1980s television show, \"Robin of Sherwood\". The locations for Ravenscar, as featured in the episodes, were filmed at Cornwall and Somerset. The exterior of Ravenscar Castle was Saint Michael's Mount, and the interior, in particular the room where the seven swords were kept, was Wells Cathedral.\n\nThe comic book anti-hero John Constantine was committed to the (fictional) Ravenscar Lunatic Asylum in the Hellblazer series of comics after a disastrous summoning. He returned there throughout the series.\n\nThe fictional character Roger Comstock in the Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson has the royal title \"Marquis of Ravenscar\".\n\n"}

The image is then focused and enlarged onto a screen using a lens kept in front of the CRT face. The first color CRT projectors came out in the early 1950s. Most modern CRT projectors are color and have three separate CRTs (instead of a single, color CRT), and their own lenses to achieve color images. The red, green and blue portions of the incoming video signal are processed and sent to the respective CRTs whose images are focused by their lenses to achieve the overall picture on the screen. Various designs have made it to production, including the \"direct\" CRT-lens design, and the Schmidt-CRT, which employed a phosphor screen that illuminates a perforated spherical mirror, all within an evacuated \"tube.\"\n\nThe image in the Sinclair Microvision \"flat\" CRT is viewed from the same side of the phosphor struck by the electron beam. The other side of the screen can be connected directly to a heat sink, allowing the projector to run at much brighter power levels than the more common CRT arrangement.\n\nThough systems utilizing projected video at one time almost exclusively used CRT projectors, they have largely been replaced by other technologies such as LCD projection and Digital Light Processing. Improvements in these digital video projectors, and their subsequent increased availability and desirability, resulted in a drastic decline of CRT projector sales by the late 2000s.

After the Norman Conquest Chaffcombe was granted to the Bishop of Coutances under whom it was held by Ralph le Sor until it was acquired by Oliver Avenel (died 1226) and inherited by his descendants until 1613 when John Poulett of Hinton St George became lord of the manor and stayed in the Poulett family until 1913.\n\nThe parish of Chaffcombe was part of the South Petherton Hundred.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning.

It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nAvishays on Whiteway Hill is a large detached house which was partly built in the 17th century, but substantially altered between 1745 and 1759. The building was first recorded in 1316 as Aveneleseigh, from Oliver Avenel, and then changed hands many times. In the 17th century the Browne family leased it to the Sealy family, who purchased it in 1697, thereafter descendants of the Sealy family held it until it was sold to a Chard solicitor, Edward Clarke, in 1859. In the grounds are an 18th-century former stables and coach house, ice house and various other outbuildings.\n\nThe Clock Turret about 180 metres east of Avishays, which is also known as the Monmouth Tower or The Castle, is a 19th-century folly. It stands on the site of a former sham castle which had fallen into ruin, and served as a water tower as well as having a clock on the west side facing the house. The clock, which has a hand wound mechanism, was built by Gillett and Johnson of Croydon and was originally at Highclere Castle in Hampshire. The name Monmouth Tower comes from the escape of Elias Sealy, who owned the house, a follower of the Duke of Monmouth during the Monmouth Rebellion, who hid in a tree in the grounds when the troops of James II came looking for him.\n\nThe Anglican parish Church of St Michael and All Angels has a tower which partly dates from the 15th century, the remainder being rebuilt under J. M. Allen between 1857 and 1860. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building. There is a copy of Raphael's Madonna and Child in the north aisle, which was acquired in 1901.\n\n"}

Munro attended Sacred Heart Primary School in Mosman, New South Wales and Marist College North Shore in North Sydney. He began his career at 17 as a copyboy on \"The Daily Mirror\" in 1971. He stayed in newspapers for 7 years, before trying television and not liking it. So he returned to newspapers when Rupert Murdoch sent him to New York to work in the NewsCorp bureau writing for newspapers in Great Britain and Australia.\n\nIn 1982 he returned to Sydney and television, where he started as a senior reporter in the Channel 10 newsroom. In 1984, he joined the Nine Network and Mike Willessee on the \"Willessee\" current affairs program. Two years later he replaced George Negus as the fifth male reporter on \"60 Minutes\", where he remained for the next seven years, becoming well known for his interviews with celebrities including Madonna, Barbra Streisand, Bette Midler and Katharine Hepburn.\n\nMunro became a reporter and later the host of \"A Current Affair\". In 1996, Munro was the reporter at the centre of the infamous Paxton family expose. Munro was replaced as the host of the show in 2003. His then boss, Peter Meakin subsequently described Munro's situation/demeanour at that time as \"a little on the nose, a little out of favour, a little too brash\". Meakin added that he did \"really admire his \"(Munro's)\" courage and his grace\" ... \"in those last few months at \"A Current Affair\" because he did a brilliant job\" even when he knew he was going to lose the role. Munro said he lost the role because he was continually complaining to management about \"A Current Affair\" becoming 'A Consumer Affair' and no longer doing serious investigations, instead focusing on consumer and diet stories. For Munro, the final straw came on the night he had to introduce another reporter's story on a toothbrush survey.\n\nHe is synonymous with the biographical show \"This Is Your Life\", which he hosted from 1995 until 2005 and then again in 2008.\n\nIn 2005 he replaced Georgie Gardner on \"National Nine News Afternoon Edition\".

In addition to this, he also substituted for David Koch on the top-rating breakfast show, \"Sunrise\".\n\nIn January 2014, Network Ten announced that Munro had joined the network. On 9 February 2014, he commenced as the presenter of \"Ten Eyewitness News Weekend\". Munro later resigned in protest from Network Ten, after completing his 12 month contract, due to dozens of staff being retrenched from the News department.\n\nIn 2014, Munro was made a member of the Order of Australia for his community work and services to journalism.\n\nIn 2017, Munro hosted and helped to produce a four part science-based documentary series for Foxtel's History Channel on Bushrangers. \"Lawless - The Real Bushrangers\" The four episodes featured the crime scenes of Ned Kelly, Ben Hall, Captain Moonlite, and the Kenniff brothers. One of the one-hour specials included Munro's great uncles, Paddy and Jimmy Kenniff, one of whom was hanged in Brisbane jail in 1903 after being convicted of murdering a police constable and a station manager in the Carnarvon Ranges in Queensland.\n\nIn 2018, Munro hosted \"Mateship – Australia & USA: A Century Together\", a one hour documentary on Foxtel's History channel celebrating 100 years of the close bonds that unite Australia and America.

(These articles were collected into his first book, the non-fiction \"Twenty-One Americans\".)\n\nIn 1932, realizing he had gone as far as he was likely to go as a New York-based magazine writer/editor, Busch re-connected with agent Myron Selznick, whom Busch knew through his father, an executive who had worked for Myron's father Lewis in the teens and early twenties.\n\nMyron Selznick soon secured work for Busch at Warner Bros. Pictures, and Busch decamped to Los Angeles to write his first film, Howard Hawks's \"The Crowd Roars\". One of four writers on the production, Busch's name was misspelled in the credits.\n\nThrough the rest of the thirties, Busch worked for most of the major Hollywood studios, scripting mostly B-movies like \"The Big Shakedown\". In 1938 he was nominated for an Academy Award for \"In Old Chicago\", which was based on his story \"We the O'Learys\", but failed to win. In 1940 he co-wrote \"The Westerner\" for director William Wyler and producer Samuel Goldwyn. Soon thereafter he went to work as Goldwyn's story editor, recommending \"Pride of the Yankees\", in which Gary Cooper and Busch's soon-to-be wife Teresa Wright co-starred.\n\nSettling in the hills of Encino with his growing family, Busch began writing novels. \"The Carrington Incident\", published in 1941, was followed by the best-seller \"Duel in the Sun\", which Lewis Selznick's other son David purchased and turned into the 1946 blockbuster of the same title. He now alternated between the writing of screenplays and novels, most of which became best-sellers. \"They Dream of Home\", a tale of returning veterans, was followed by \"The Furies\" (1950), which became a film that starred Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nAnother notable film of the period — for which Busch wrote the original screenplay — was \"Pursued\" starring Robert Mitchum and Teresa Wright, one of the first psychological Westerns with \"noir\" overtones. Around the same time, Busch also adapted the noir thriller \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" (1946), for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nIn the early fifties, Busch and Wright divorced, and Busch left Hollywood for northern California, where he devoted himself to cattle ranching and the full-time writing of novels. There he would meet his fourth wife Carmencita Baker and fifth wife Suzanne de Sanz.\n\nBefore Busch's final novel \"The Titan Game\" he had become one of San Francisco's leading literary lights and a Regent's Professor at the University of California. \"California Street\" is about the San Francisco newspaper publishing business, with the title taken from California Street in the city.\n\nBusch appears in the film \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\", playing the role of \"Old Man\" in the scene in which Sabina (Lena Olin) receives the letter informing her of Tómas and Tereza's deaths. Busch was 84 at the time of the filming.\n\nBusch died from congestive heart failure in 1991 at the age of eighty-eight.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The village has a population of 1,020.\n\nThe parish consists of two villages, Charlton Mackrell and Charlton Adam. Both villages have approximately similar populations. There are also small settlements at Lytes Cary, Cary Fitzpaine (east of the A37 Fosse Way) and West Charlton. West Charlton is the shrunken remains of the original village of Charlton Mackrell.\n\nThe Fosse Way runs through the parish and Roman villa sites associated with it have been found at Windmill Hill. The parishes of Charlton Adam and Charlton Mackrell were part of the hundred of Somerton.\n\nIn the 16th century two medieval fields were divided which delayed inclosure until the 18th century, leading to the current patchwork of fields.\n\nThe Charltons have been home to several of the ancestors of politicians in the United States of America. Henry Adams and Edith Squire were married in the parish church in 1609 and she is thought to be the ancestor of Presidents John Adams, John Quincy Adams and Calvin Coolidge, as well as of Samuel Adams, who also signed the Declaration of Independence, while Presidents Millard Fillmore and William Howard Taft were descendants of her two sisters Ann and Margaret.\n\nThe manor was bought around 1800 by William Dickinson of Kingweston whose family held it until 1930.\n\nA railway station served the village as part of the Great Western Railway, from 1905 to 1962.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The civil parish was renamed from Charlton Mackrell to The Charltons in 13 March 2014\n\nThe village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Langport Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.\n\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\n\nIt is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nJust outside the village to the south west, near the main Langport and Castle Cary Railway line is the Green Down Nature Reserve run by the Somerset Wildlife Trust. It is on the side of Windmill Hill and provides a habitat for a range of species including the largest number of large blue butterflies anywhere in the world. At the eastern end of the reserve is a Powder House which was used by the Great Western Railway to store dynamite used in the construction of the Somerton Tunnel from 1903 to 1905.\n\nThe Abbey, Charlton Adam is a small country house which dates from the 16th century. The house takes its name from the fact that it was the site of the Chantry Chapel of the Holy Spirit, founded in 1237, of which some fragments may be incorporated. The interiors contain some Elizabethan panelling and reused earlier bits and pieces. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.\n\nLytes Cary is larger and has parts which date from the 14th century. A Tudor great hall was added in the mid-15th century, and a great chamber and other rooms in 1533. Other rooms and ranges were added until the Lytes family sold the manor in the mid-18th century. It is now owned by the National Trust and is also Grade I listed.\n\nCharlton House is dated as being built in 1726 by Thomas Lyte on the site of an earlier building. The Court was built in 1792. Both are grade II* listed.\n\nThe Church of St Mary in West Charlton dates from the 13th century.\n\nThe Church of St Peter and St Paul, on Church Hill, is slightly more recent.\n\n"}

The older Church of St Stephen dates from the 13th century. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building. The second centre is said to have originated when people fled to avoid the plague. The newer centre had no church until 1877 when a chapel of ease at Barrow Lane, dedicated to St John the Baptist, was given by Mrs. Emma Frances Davies (née Leir), the widow of a former rector, daughter of Rev William Leir (1768–1863). It is of stone in a 13th-century style, designed by Charles Edward Davis of Bath, and comprises an apsidal chancel and a nave with a southern bell tower. The Leir family themselves have provided a number of rectors to the parish.\n\nStavordale Priory, now a private home owned by Sir Cameron Mackintosh, is thought to be linked to the village's Old Church near the altar by a tunnel, perhaps used as a priest's escape route, some two miles in length. The building has 13th-century origins, having been founded by a member of the Lovel family, and was converted around the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, after the Priory merged with Taunton in 1533. The Priory of the Augustinian Order was first mentioned in 1243. The bell tower is known to have existed by 1374, and the church was refitted and rebuilt around 1439. The chantry of Jesus was described as having been \"recently completed\" in 1526.\n\nWilliam Arnold an important master mason who flourished between 1595 and 1637 lived in the village in 1595 where he was church warden. His first known commission was for the design of Montacute House around 1598.\n\n"}

Featuring both detective fiction and comic elements, it was originally published in serial form in the magazine \"Analog Science Fiction and Science Fact\"; the hardcover edition was first published in 1976 and the paperback in 1977. Zelazny wrote the whole story in one draft, no rewrites and it subsequently became one of his own five personal favorites in all his work. \"Doorways in the Sand\" was nominated to the Nebula and Hugo awards.\n\nA galactic confederation of alien civilizations exchanges the star-stone and the Rhennius machine, mysterious alien artifacts, for the Mona Lisa and the British Crown Jewels as part of the process of admitting Earth to its organization. The star-stone is missing, and Fred Cassidy, a perpetual student and acrophile, is the last known person to have seen it. Various criminals, Anglophile zealots, government agents and aliens torture, shoot, beat, trick, chase, terrorize, assault telepathically, stalk, and importune Fred in attempts to get him to tell them the location of the stone. He denies any knowledge of its whereabouts, and decides to make his own investigation. Through the examination of an alien telepath, Fred finds out that the star-stone entered his body through a wound while he was asleep. An alien agent, a representative of the Whillowhim culture, attempts to steal the stone when it is removed from Fred’s body. The Whillowhim seek to limit the power of an alliance of newer, less-developed members of the galactic coalition, and its theft would temporarily stop the entry of Earth to the organization. In a struggle atop the building housing the Rhennius machine, the Whillowhim agent falls to its death. Fred accepts a position as alien cultural expert for the legation of the U.S. to the United Nations. The star-stone, now identified with the name Speicus, is a sentient, telepathic sociological life-form that can gather and analyze information and make reports using Fred as its host.\n\nFred Cassidy — A building-climbing, wise-cracking, perennial student is the last known person to have seen the missing star-stone, a unique alien crystalline object of unknown origin and function. He denies any knowledge of its whereabouts. Fred receives a generous stipend from his cryogenically-frozen uncle as long as he is a full-time student and has not received an academic degree, which he has put off for 13 years by changing majors repeatedly. Since he is an acrophile, a lover of high places, he occasionally climbs tall buildings.\n\nThe Rhennius machine — An alien device can transform objects in different ways through its \"inversion program.\" In \"Doorways\" it reverses, turns inside out, and incises objects.\n\nDennis Wexroth — Fred’s latest academic counselor is determined to graduate Fred against his will.\n\nHal Sidmore — Fred’s best friend and former roommate unknowingly switches a model of the star-stone for the real one in Professor Byler’s laboratory. When he moves out, he leaves the stone in Fred’s apartment.\n\nPaul Byler — A professor of geology and world-renowned crystallographer manufactures replicas of the star-stone for the United Nations. As an extremist Anglophile, Byler is incensed by the loan of the British Crown Jewels to the alien confederation. He hires two thugs, Morton Zeemeister and Jamie Buckler, to plan and help carry out the theft of the star-stone during the delivery of a replica and the real stone to the United Nations.\n\nCharv and Ragma — Alien police officers investigate the theft of the star-stone in order to return it to the United Nations. They assume Fred does not know where it is, but believe the secret of its recovery lies in his subconscious. Ragma is disguised as either a wombat or a dog, while Charv wears a kangaroo suit.\n\nMorton Zeemeister and Jamie Buckler — Sadistic professional criminals are originally employed by Paul Byler and others in his extremist Anglophile group to plan the theft of the star-stone. Ragma and Charv assume that they want the stone for themselves to ransom it back to the United Nations; however, they really work for the Whillowhim.\n\nSpeicus (the star-stone) — A sentient telepathic alien life form of unknown origin in the shape of a stone acts as a recorder and data processor of sociological information. It needs a symbiote in order to use its nervous system to collect data. Speicus enters Fred’s body through a wound while he is sleeping and convinces him to reverse himself through the Rhennius machine so that it can be fully activated. It can keep its host alive indefinitely.\n\nDoctor M’mrm’mlrr — An alien telepathic analyst practices a technique known as assault therapy. It examines Fred and discovers that Speicus is inside him.\n\nTed Nadler — A representative of the State Department persuades the university to award Fred a Ph.D in Anthropology and hires Fred as an alien culture expert for the U.S. legation to the United Nations.\n\nThe Whillowhim Agent — An alien disguised as a black cat desires the stone in order to keep Earth from joining a coalition of newer, weaker planets whose interests are at odds with the Whillowhim civilization and the massive power block of older, entrenched powers that it belongs to. Fred identifies the Whillowhim with Carroll's Cheshire cat. And Speicus calls him a Boojum, a very bad snark.\n\nRalph Warp — Fred’s partner in the Warp and Woof, a crafts shop, lets Fred crash at his apartment.\n\nThe setting is in the “near-future Earth.” The “near future” is defined in the \"Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\" as an “imprecise term used to identify novels set just far enough in the future to allow for certain technological or social changes without being so different that it is necessary to explain that society to the reader.”\n\nOne character describes the near future in \"Doorways\":\n\nI am especially conscious of the difference between that earlier time and this present. It was a cumulative thing, the change. Space travel, cities under the sea, the advances in medicine—even our first contact with the aliens—all of these things occurred at different times and everything else seemed unchanged when they did. Petty pace.\n\nAdd air scooters and flycars and that completes the near future in \"Doorways\".\n\nThe action takes place mostly in the United States at an unnamed university in an unnamed city near an unnamed ocean. However, the Australian desert, New York, a small unnamed town in the Alps, and a spacecraft in orbit are other locations in the narrative.\n\nThe will of Fred Cassidy’s cryogenically-frozen uncle provides him with a generous stipend to attend the university until he is awarded an academic degree. By carefully choosing his courses and changing majors, Fred avoids mandatory graduation for thirteen years. He meets with his new academic counselor, Dennis Wexroth, who is infuriated by what he calls Fred’s “dronehood” (See text box.) and threatens to send him off into the real world by graduating Fred in the coming semester. Fred, however, finds a way to get enough credits in different majors to avoid graduation.\n\nFred goes to his apartment and finds it ransacked. He examines the apartment, but finds nothing missing. Paul Byler, Fred’s geology teacher comes out of a closet. He slaps Fred around demanding the return of a replica he made of the crystalline star-stone. Byler is a world-renowned expert in crystallography and says he makes copies of the star-stone in order to sell them as novelty items. Fred states that the replica is not in the apartment and maybe his ex-roommate has it. Byler does not believe Fred. After a brief fight Fred escapes through a window to an outside ledge.\n\nByler visits Hal Sidmore, Fred’s ex-roommate, roughs him up and demands the model of the star-stone. Hal insists he does not have it saying that Fred probably has it in their old apartment. Previously, during a poker game, Byler gives the copy of the star-stone to Hal. However, Hal switches it without Byler's knowledge for what he thinks is a better model, but is in fact the star-stone itself. Arriving home Fred sees a news story on television reporting Byler’s murder and the odd removal of some of his vital organs.\n\nAs part of his study plan Fred goes to the desert in Australia to study ancient carvings on a cliff. Zeemeister and Buckler, two professional criminals, arrive and torture Fred for the location of the star-stone. Two alien law officers, Charv and Ragma, disguised as a wombat and a kangaroo respectively save Fred, and they all go into orbit in their spacecraft.\n\nLater, as he comes slowly into consciousness a voice instructs Fred that he should not permit the aliens to take him to another world where they want to telepathically examine his mind for clues to the whereabouts of the star-stone. Fred convinces them that it would be against their alien field regulations to take him without his consent. They return him to Earth.\n\nAfter being set down on Earth, Fred goes to visit Hal who reports that he receives phone calls from various people trying find Fred. People break into and ransack his apartment several times. And that Ted Nadler, a State Department employee, is looking for him. Finding himself intoxicated Fred stays the night with Hal and hears the voice, now identifying itself as Speicus, that has been talking to him. It tells him to test the inversion program of the alien Rhennius machine and then get intoxicated. It is easier for Speicus to talk to Fred if he is drunk. Fred breaks into the room with the Rhennius machine and, hanging from a rope from the ceiling, puts a penny through the machine three times. The first time Lincoln is looking backwards and the ONE is also backwards. The second time the penny is incised like an intaglio. The third time returns it to normal.\n\nFred goes bar-crawling to get drunk as Speicus instructs him. He runs into a shady old school adviser named Doctor Mérimée who tells him he is being followed. He joins Mérimée at a party at his apartment, finishes getting drunk, and falls asleep. On waking Fred remembers a communication with Speicus during the night.\nAccording to Speicus, reversing himself through the Rhennius machine will put \"everything in proper order.”\n\nBy subterfuge Fred manages to reverse himself by going through the Rhennius machine. Left is right and vice versa, and letters are read backwards from right to left with the letters turned backwards. He remembers his biochemistry and realizes that this reversal can be dangerous to his health. Meanwhile, Ted Nadler convinces the university to award Fred a Ph.D. in Anthropology. This outrages Fred because he loses his uncle’s stipend and has to get a job.\n\nFred calls Hal and they agree to meet in a secret place. They begin driving, aimlessly Fred thinks. Hal explains that Zeemeister and Buckler have his wife, Mary, and are demanding the star-stone. He has another replica of the stone from Byler’s lab and is going to trade it for Mary. Fred agrees to go along with the plan against his better judgment. They go to a beach cottage where they find Zeemeister, Buckler, a cat and Mary. Zeemeister declares the stone to be a fake and threatens to pull Mary’s fingernails off until they tell him where the star-stone is. Paul Byler, brought back to life by multiple organ transplants, enters through the back of the cottage with a drawn gun. In the ensuing struggle Buckler shoots Fred in the chest, and he blacks out.\n\nFred awakens in a hospital. He is alive since his heart was on the right side of his body due to the reversal, and he was shot on the left side where the heart is usually found. Everyone else from the cottage survives with minor injuries. Ted Nadler stops by Fred’s hospital room and offers him a position as alien culture specialist for the U.S. legation to the United Nations. Fred says he'll think about it.\n\nNadler explains the history of the star-stone. The United Nations hires Byler as an expert in synthetics and crystals to make a replica for safety purposes. The loan of the British Crown Jewels to the aliens outrages Byler and some of his fanatical Anglophile friends. Byler and an accomplice exchange the real star-stone for a fake one. Byler hires Zeemeister and Buckler in their capacity as professional criminals to assist in the substitution of the stones, but they really want the original for themselves for a ransom, Nadler believes.\n\nWhile shaving the next morning Fred remembers a smile that remains with him from his night’s dreams. Ted Nadler and Fred travel to New York to meet with a telepath. As Fred enters his hotel room he is seized and raised into the air by the tentacles of an alien telepathic analyst who practices attack therapy. He attempts to reach into Fred’s subconscious for information about the star-stone. He is stunned to discover that the star-stone, Speicus, is inside Fred, having entered his body through a wound while Fred was asleep. Since he was reversed by the Rhennius machine Speicus is now fully functional and should be able to communicate telepathically directly and easily with Fred, but because Fred is now reversed it cannot. On the way to the Rhennius machine to have him reversed back to his original state, Speicus warns Fred about an unknown enemy by saying, “Our Snark is a Boojum.”\n\nIn the building housing the Rhennius machine Doctor M’mrm’mlrr, the alien analyst, supervises the removal of the star-stone from Fred’s body. On the wall Fred sees a vision of “massive teeth framed by upward curving lips. . . .Then fading, fading. . . Gone.” Fred looks up and sees a black shape and cries out, “The smile.” Fred chases a telepathic alien disguised as a black cat up to the roof and over girders of the adjacent building. It attacks Fred and falls to its death. During the fight Fred realizes that Zeemeister and Buckler work for the alien agent called a Whillowhim.\n\nRagma explains that the Whillowhim are one of the oldest, most powerful and entrenched cultures in the galaxy. However, there is an alliance of younger ones that back common policies in conflict with those of the older blocs. The Whillowhim belong to a faction of the galactic coalition that opposes the policies of younger, newer members on major issues. One way to limit the power of the newer, less developed planets is to limit their number. The Whillowhim seeks to steal the star-stone to embarrass Earth and delay its entrance into the coalition of planets thereby weakening the power of the newer planets’ alliance.\n\nFred’s future is as an alien culture expert for the U.S. legation of the United Nations and as a host for Speicus. Speicus will use Fred’s nervous system as well as his broad knowledge of many subjects to gather information and process it as a kind of sociological computer. It can produce uniquely accurate and useful reports on anything they study together. In the end, Fred sees a beach with doorways leading to unique experiences in exotic places throughout the galaxy.\n\nSome reviewers expressed disappointment not only in \"Doorways\", but in Zelazny’s previous recent work as well. Praise was unenthusiastic.\n\nSpider Robinson in \"Galaxy Science Fiction Magazine\" stated that Zelazny's initial works gave the science fiction world hope that he would write “muscular adventure in the language of the poet, uniting drama and beauty,” but he had failed. Nonetheless, he described \"Doorways\" as “A cracking good yarn, thin on calories but delicious.”\n\nRichard E. Geis in \"Science Fiction Review\" wrote that “at the end I was left vaguely unsatisfied,” but the novel had “Zelazny magic; that indefinable stylistic touch that makes him extremely readable.”\n\n\"Locus\" magazine’s Susan Wood wondered if Zelazny’s “promise would ever be fulfilled.” She described \"Doorways\" as “a well-written adventure,” and “fast enough, interesting enough, to carry any bedtime reader through arbitrary plotting to midnight and the loose-ends-tied-up conclusion.”\n\nHaving read seven of Zelazny’s most recent books in one month, Richard Cowper in \"Foundation: The International Review of Science Fiction\" lamented the loss of Zelazny as science fiction’s prose-poet:\nHope deferred maketh the heart sick. As I progressed from one improbable fantasy to the next, I winced at what I felt to be the squandering of a rare and remarkable talent and felt a growing sense of dismay—in truth as much for Zelazny as for myself. There are felicities of style, of invention, of learning or wit, which stamp it as being his alone. The energy is still there, together with the desire to experiment, but the early promise remains unfulfilled. He has yet to give us that major work.\n\nNonetheless, he rated \"Doorways\" as \"definitely superior.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Algis Budrys in \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\" wrote that \"Doorways\" “is one of the first hopeful signs from this author in some time” and “a return toward the power Zelazny once displayed, plus a maturation that runs deeper than witticism.” He called \"Doorways\" a “rather good novel.”\n\n\"Doorways in the Sand\" has had five English editions with separate ISBN numbers, the last in 1991, and has been translated into German, Bulgarian, Dutch, Russian, Hebrew, Japanese, French, Italian, and Polish.\n\nZelazny mixes other genres into his science fiction and fantasy works. In his fantasy Amber series, Krulik identifies space opera, mystery and fairy tale elements in \"Nine Princes in Amber\"; tales of knighthood and allegory in \"The Guns of Avalon\"; drawing-room mystery in \"Sign of the Unicorn\"; and, as in \"Doorways\", \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" in \"The Courts of Chaos\".\"\n\n\"Doorways\" is a science fiction novel with mystery and comic elements that evokes and offers homage to Lewis Carroll’s \"Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland\", \"Through the Looking-Glass\", and \"The Hunting of the Snark\"; and to notes by Martin Gardner in \"The Annotated Alice\".\n\nWhile it is difficult to define “science fiction,” some features often cited include:\nMany of the hallmarks of science fiction are part of \"Doorways\":\nThe setting is Earth in the near future. Aliens come in space ships giving the Rhennius machine and the star-stone. Fred leaves Earth in a space ship to orbit the globe. In the end Fred and the star-stone are on an alien world.\n\n\"Doorways\" is also detective fiction. Some characteristics of detective stories are:\nIn \"Doorways\" there are two mysteries: the location of the star-stone and what it can do. Fred investigates because everybody keeps after him thinking that he knows where it is. Two alien law officers run a parallel investigation. Some clues are offered such as the fading smile and Speicus’ communications. The star-stone and its functions are discovered. The evil party, the Whillowhim, and its goals are revealed. Its death ends the detective story.\n\nWhile Doorways is clearly not a fantasy novel, it is necessary to understand the differences between fantasy and science fiction since Zelazny converts elements of one into elements of the other. Some traits of fantasy are:\n\n\n\"Doorways\" shares none of these characteristics.\n\nZelazny laces many of his works with humor, but with \"Doorways\" he set out to write a truly comedic novel.\n\nKrulik writes:\n\nAn important reason for \"Doorways\"' success is Zelazny’s humor. This novel is probably his most wildly comic work, combining the kind of verbal humor he is known for with ridiculous situations that border on the absurd, and secondary characters whose posings and behavior give an antic flavor to the comedy.\n\nAn example of the absurd is the name Zelazny gives to the cryonics facility that stores Fred's uncle: \"Bide-A-Wee.\"\n\nHere is an example of wordplay between Fred and his best friend, Hal Sidmore:\n\n\"Enter, pray.\"<br>\n\"In which order?\"<br>\nO bless this house, by all means, first. It could use a little grace.\"<br>\n\"Bless,\" I said, stepping in.\n\nHere he satirizes some silly practices of bureaucracies with some double-talk. This is a series of conversations between Fred and the alien cop, Ragma:\n\n\"Indicated by whom?\" I asked.<br>\n\"I am not permitted to say\"<br>\nHe cut short a snappy rejoinder by pouring more water down my throat. Choking and considering, I modified it to \"This is ridiculous!\"\n\n\"How? How did you know?\"<br>\n\"Sorry,\" Ragma said. \"That's another.\"<br>\n\"Another what?\"<br>\n\"Thing we are not permitted to say.\"<br>\n\"Who does your permitting and forbidding?\"<br>\n\"That's another.\"\n\n\"However, since it is all contingent on the results of the analysis, it would be an exercise in redundancy to detail the various hypotheses which may have to be discarded.\"<br>\n\"In other words, you are not going to tell me?\"<br>\n\"That pretty well sums it up.\"\n\nIn \"Doorways\" as in \"The Courts of Chaos\" the evocations of and homage to Lewis Carroll's works provide many of the gags and mad humor. Lewis Carroll is mentioned by name in the novel. Here are some of the many allusions to \"Alice\" in \"Doorways\":\n\n\"Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Doorways\" begin on warm May afternoons. On page one of \"Doorways\" Fred says, “I glanced at my watch. It indicated that I was late for my appointment.” Zelazny relates Fred to the White Rabbit, who on page one of \"Alice\" says, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late.” He then takes out his pocket watch and looks at it. Many other \"Doorways\" characters are parallel to Alice characters:\n\n\nZelazny refers to well-known Carrollian quotations throughout the novel:\n\n\nOther references to \"Alice\" include:\n\n\n\"Doorways\" is mostly narrated in the first person by its protagonist, Fred Cassidy. However, in the last chapter Speicus, the sentient sociological computer, takes up the story.\n\nOne reviewer has been critical of Zelazny’s use of the first-person narrative technique: “It’s a difficult form to control, since the narrator has to be used to tell his . . . own story, give us a sense of his own personality, suggest enough of outside events and responses to give another perspective on that character. Over and over in his work, Zelazny only accomplishes the first of these tasks.”\n\nZelazny experimented with a number of narrative techniques. \"Doorways\" uses a flashforward technique which can be confused with flashback. Zelazny himself used the term flashback: Once I knew what the story was to be, I ran it, a piece at a time, through a flashback machine, using the suspense-heightening flashback trick so frequently and predictably that the practice intentionally parodied the device itself.\n\nZelazny divided most chapters into two to five sections, placed the most mysterious or exciting part first, then arranged the other pieces of the narrative out of sequence. His use of this method had a mixed reception.\n\nSusan Wood in \"Locus\" magazine wrote, “Used sparingly, it could effectively create suspense. Used in each chapter, however, it becomes monotonous and mannered, interfering with the flow.” Another critic stated, “It seems like grandstanding, and it gets in the way of my enjoyment of the story. . . . It makes it easy to identify with a protagonist who doesn’t know what’s going on either, but it’s irritating.” However, Fred Kiesche of \"SF Signal\" felt that “The magic of the plot [is] where you’re never sure of what exactly is going on.”\n\nZelazny has been repeatedly referred to as a prose-poet. However, there does not appear to be agreement about the true nature of his prose.\n\nGeis writes that \"Doorways\" \"is written with the Zelazny magic; that indefinable stylistic touch that makes him extremely readable.\" The prose in \"Doorways\" has been variously described as \"straight-forward,\" \"well-written and fast paced,\" \"colloquial and functional.\"\n\nCowper writes that Zelaznyhas fashioned for himself a style which . . . is designed to dazzle. Seen at its best, . . . it is allusive, economical, picturesque and witty [and] highly metaphorical. There are felicities of style, of invention of learning or wit, which stamp it as being his own.\n\nSturgeon praises him for his \"texture, cadence and pace.\"\n\nLindskold asserts that \"In the final analysis . . . unlike a poet, a fiction writer must emphasize content and character over form, image, and structure.\"\n\nLindskold adds as elements of poetic diction alliteration, internal rhyme, and metaphor to form, image, and structure.\n\nIn \"Doorway\"s, with the exception of Speicus' narration in the last chapter (See text box.), Zelazny utilizes the language of poetry to characterize the mental states of falling asleep or into a stupor, or awakening from such states.\n\nIn the Australian desert, bound and being tortured by Zeemeister and Buckler, Fred evokes losing consciousness:\n\"Sunflash, some splash. Darkle. Stardance. Phaeton's solid gold Cadillac crashed where there was no ear to hear, lay burning, flickered, went out. Like me.\"\n\nIn Charv and Ragma's space vehicle Fred comes out of unconsciousness with Speicus speaking to him in his head: Thus, thus, so and thus: awakening as a thing of textures and shadings: advancing and retreating along a scale of soft/dark, smooth/shadow, slick/bright: all else displaced and translated to this: The colors, sounds and balances a function of these two.<br>\nAdvance to hard and very bright. Fall back to soft and black . . .<br>\n\"Do you hear me, Fred?\"—the twilight velvet.<br>\n\"Yes\" —my glowing scales.<br>\n\"Better, better, better . . .\"<br>\n\"What/who?\"<br>\n\"Closer, closer, that not a sound betray . . .\"\n\nOn a long bus ride Fred nods off drunkenly: \"Drifting drowsy across the countryside, I paraded my troubles through the streets of my mind, poking occasional thoughts between the bars of their cages, hearing the clowns beat drums in my temples.\"\n\nAgain with Speicus in his head, Fred describes going to sleep and dreaming: Some upwelling in the dark fishbowl atop the spine later splashed dreams, patterns memory-resistant as a swirl of noctilucae, across consciousness' thin, transparent rim, save for the kinesthetic/synesthetic DO YOU FEEL ME LED? which must have lasted a time-less time longer than the rest, for later, much later, morning's third coffee touched it to a penny's worth of spin, of color.\n\nMore than half of Zelazny’s novels have characters who are immortal or nearly immortal. Zelazny believed living a long life would make people have great intellectual and perceptual faculties and would produce a good sense of humor.\n\nImmortality for Zelazny generally meant an immortal can be killed like any other person, but not from old age. A long life according to Zelazny would not cause ennui, but rather curiosity, changing and maturing, growing and learning, and lead to knowledge, culture and satisfying experiences. According to Samuel R. Delany, Zelazny believed that “Given all eternity to live, each experience becomes a jewel in the jewel-clutter of life; each moment becomes infinitely fascinating because there is so much more to relate it to.\"\n\nIn \"Doorways\" Fred achieves near immortality as a host for Speicus. In the hospital after being shot all of Fred’s injuries heal speedily. Later Speicus tells Fred that he is able to repair his body indefinitely.\n\nFor Zelazny one of the attractions of immortality was that an immortal could continue to learn forever. And Zelazny had a lifelong love of learning.\n\nIn college he often audited courses he found interesting in addition to his regular plan of studies. In 1971 he designed an evolving curriculum of studies for himself that he would pursue for the rest of his life. One of his concerns was to obtain greater amounts of diverse information that would make him a better writer. These studies included cultural and physical geography, ecology, education, history, biography, literature, and other sciences and humanities. A principle of his studies was the notion that we create ourselves, and learning is part of that process.\n\nIn \"Doorways\" Fred has a similar program of studies, not just motivated by a desire to learn, but also to keep money flowing from his cryogenically-frozen uncle’s trust fund.\n\nDuring his thirteen years of studies at the university he takes just enough courses in each discipline to not receive a degree according to the mandatory departmental graduation requirements, making him very broadly-educated.\n\nZelazny wrote science fiction and fantasy, receiving Hugo and Nebula awards in both genres. However, he sometimes took elements from one and converted them to the other. Krulik writes: “This imposition of science upon magic, and its reverse, forms a fascinating conflict that is apparent in his writings.” In \"Doorways\" Zelazny changes three fantasy elements into science fiction elements.\n\nJewels with supernatural properties are a staple in fantasy. In Zelazny’s Amber series the Jewel of Judgment plays a decisive role in the plot. In \"Jack of Shadows\", Jack is imprisoned in a jewel that is worn around the neck by another character, the Lord of Bats.\n\nZelazny takes the jewel fantasy motif and revises it into the star-stone in \"Doorways.\" Instead of having magical qualities, the star-stone is described in the vocabulary of science: To function properly, [Speicus] requires a host built along our lines. It exists then as a symbiote within that creature, obtaining data by means of that being’s nervous system as it goes about its business. It operates on this material as something of a sociological computer. In return for this, it keeps its host in good repair indefinitely. On request, it provides analyses of anything it has encountered directly or peripherally, along with reliability figures, unbiased because it is uniquely alien to all life forms, yet creature-oriented because of the nature of the input mechanism. It prefers a mobile host with a fact-filled head.\n\nAnother fantasy element that Zelazny converts to science fiction is Alice’s looking glass. Looking through her mirror Alice observes that objects are the same as in her drawing room, but “. . . the things go the other way.” A book held up to a mirror in the right hand has reversed writing in the mirror and the book is in the left hand of the mirror image of the person on the other side of the looking glass. The mirror reverses the image from one side to the other.\n\nIn \"Doorways\" Zelazny reimagines Alice’s looking glass as the Rhennius machine, the device given to man by the aliens that reverses objects into their mirror images. At Speicus’ urging Fred puts himself through the machine. The left side of his body is on the right and vice versa. Also left becomes right and vice versa, and writing is backwards for Fred.\n\nAnd finally, Zelazny reenvisions another \"Alice\" artifact in Fred's mind. In \"Alice\" the White Rabbit goes down the rabbit hole which leads to Wonderland. While Fred is being tortured in the Australian desert, he looks around for a doorway in the sand, a passageway that will take him out of his surreal nightmare back to his normal world.\n\nHowever, at the end of \"Doorways\" Zelazny revises the rabbit hole again. Fred imagines all the doorways in the sand that will lead to all the exotic places he and Speicus will visit and experiences that they will have throughout the galaxy: “Behind me the beach was suddenly full of doorways, and I thought of ladies, tigers, shoes, ships, sealing wax. . . .”\n\nZelazny's literary biographers have disagreed over the basic profile of his protagonists. Krulik writes:\n\nMore than most writers, Zelazny persists in reworking a persona composed of a single literary vision. This vision is the unraveling of a complex personality with special abilities, intelligent, cultured, experienced in many areas, but who is fallible, needing emotional maturity, and who candidly reflects upon the losses in his life. This complex persona cuts across all of Zelazny's writings. . . .\n\nFred Cassidy does not appear to be a complex personality, but he has two special abilities: he climbs buildings well because of his acrophlia and he has an extraordinary thirteen-year education in all the departments of the university. He is intelligent, cultured and experienced due to his education only, fallible, needs emotional maturity and experience, but does not dwell on his life's struggles very much.\n\nLindskold believes that Krulik's view oversimplifies Zelazny's protagonists and proposes four classifications: heroic, morally ambivalent \"heroes,\" more villain than hero, and ordinary people. She classifies Fred as an ordinary person \"who is forced into action by extraordinary circumstances.\"\n\nZelazny portrays Fred as a hard partyer who sometimes drinks too much, a gambler, and a good student who wants to study but not get a degree. Professor Wexroth, Fred's academic adviser, calls Fred a playboy and an irresponsible dilettante with no desire to work or repay society.\n\nWith regard to the maturation of his protagonists, Zelazny writes: \"I am interested in characters in a state of transformation. I feel it would be wrong to write a book where the character proceeds through all of the action and winds up pretty much the same at the end as he was in the beginning, just having an adventure. He has to be changed by the things that take place.\"\n\nIn this vein Krulik observes: \"Growth of any fictional character depends on what he learns about himself during the course of a work, and how he changes as a result of this knowledge. This is a basic tenet of all literature and certainly one that Zelazny subscribes to.\"\n\nIn \"Doorways\" Fred goes through a series of life-changing experiences. He is stalked, slapped around, beaten, chased, threatened, terrorized, tortured and shot. He fears mutilation and contemplates his own death.\n\nIn the end he accepts a responsible position as an alien culture specialist for the U.S. legation to the United Nations. And he agrees to serve as host for Speicus and travel the galaxy studying various cultures. His old mentor, Professor Dobson, urges him to learn something in his job, if only humility. Using Fred's acrophilia as a metaphor, Dobson tells him to \"Keep climbing. That is all. Keep climbing, and then go a little higher.\"\n\nZelazny makes many obscure literary and scientific allusions. His critics disagree over the effect these references might have on readers.\n\nTheordore Sturgeon in his introduction to \"Four For Tomorrow\" calls Zelazny's more obscure allusions \"furniture.\" Some allusions, he writes \"can keep a reader from his speedy progress from here to there, and that his furniture should be placed outside the traffic pattern.\"\n\nKrulik takes the view that \"It's a risky business, but Zelazny has enormous stylistic power, and his strong characterizations are usually able to draw back the reader to the written word after chewing momentarily on the morsel given to him for thought.\"\n\nLindskold feels that in stories \"the reader who is uninterested in delving into the subtext can still enjoy the story simply for the plot alone.\"\n\nBelow are a few of the literary and scientific allusions in \"Doorways\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The instrument was braced by a crossbar that stiffened the structure and provided a means of supporting its weight on the player's shoulder. Some specimens survive in the archaeological record, two from the ruins of Pompeii.\n\nThe \"cornu\" may be difficult to distinguish from the buccina. It was used by the Roman army for communicating orders to troops in battle. In Roman art, the \"cornu\" appears among the instruments that accompany games \"(ludi)\" or gladiator combat in the arena, as on the Zliten mosaic.\n\nThe \"cornu\" was carried by the \"cornicen\" (horn-blower) who coded the general's orders into signals and broadcast them over the field during battles. The Roman army also made use of a straight trumpet called a \"tuba,\" which bore no resemblance to the modern tuba.\n\nThe military writer Vegetius described the use of horns to give signals:\nThe music of the legion consists of trumpets, cornets and buccinae. The trumpet sounds the charge and the retreat. The cornets are used only to regulate the motions of the colors; the trumpets serve when the soldiers are ordered out to any work without the colors; but in time of action, the trumpets and cornets sound together. The \"classicum\", which is a particular sound of the \"buccina\" or horn, is appropriated to the commander-in-chief and is used in the presence of the general, or at the execution of a soldier, as a mark of its being done by his authority. The ordinary guards and outposts are always mounted and relieved by the sound of trumpet, which also directs the motions of the soldiers on working parties and on field days. The cornets sound whenever the colors are to be struck or planted. These rules must be punctually observed in all exercises and reviews so that the soldiers may be ready to obey them in action without hesitation according to the general's orders either to charge or halt, to pursue the enemy or to retire. For reason will convince us that what is necessary to be performed in the heat of action should constantly be practiced in the leisure of peace.\"\n\nThe cornu was revived as the \"tuba curva\" during the French Revolution, along with the buccina. Both were first used in music that François Joseph Gossec composed for the translation of the remains of Voltaire to the Pantheon, on 11 July 1791.\n\n\n"}

According to writer Daniel Codd, who observed the skull in February 2010: \"Upon being shown Theophilus' skull, I was curious to see his lower jaw was missing and that he appears at some stage to have been varnished.\" Codd goes on to say, \"The reason for Theophilus Brome's desire that his head be hidden was very natural, given the era in which he died, and his tomb in the church is concealed beneath the church wall nearest the farm — meaning that his head and body were buried apart, but as near to each other as was possible under the circumstances.\" Several attempts to inter the skull have resulted in terrible and unexplained noises being heard throughout the farmhouse.\n\n\n"}

The parish had a population of 139 in 2011. The civil parish also includes the village with Blackford (located one mile to the east) and therefore population is based on the two villages together. Blackford parish was merged with Compton Pauncefoot on 1 April 1933. The civil parish holds a Parish Meeting twice a year and has no Parish Council.\n\nThere are approximately 35 houses in the village of Compton Pauncefoot and a similar number in Blackford. Compton Pauncefoot is a designated Conservation Area. The civil parish is in the Blackmore Vale ward of South Somerset District Council and Somerset County Council.\n\nThe name of the village is believed to come from ‘compton’, or narrow valley, belonging to a Norman knight called Pauncefote (‘Fat-bellied’).\n\nThe parish was part of the hundred of Catsash.\n\nBaron Blackford, of Compton Pauncefoot in the County of Somerset, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1935 for the barrister William Mason. He had already been created a Baronet, of Compton Pauncefoot in the County of Somerset, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1918. The titles became extinct in 1988 on the death of his great-grandson, the fourth Baron.\n\nThe stream through Compton Pauncefoot is a tributary of the River Cam (Somerset). It travels under the A303 to join the Yarlington headwaters. The River Cam flows onto the Royal Naval Station where it joins the River Yeo and the Yeo in turn flows west to the south of Yeovilton and through the town of Ilchester. The river course continues to the west and at Langport becomes the River Parrett.\n\nThe stream has its headwaters in the hills around Blackford & Compton Pauncefoot together with a number of springs. The main waters come from 3 primary sources: 1. Maperton, 2. Quarry Hill, 3. Sigwells Hill. The first 2 combine in Blackford around the Crossroads/Hollow and further springs contribute at a number of points all the way through both villages. The A303 is nearby and during construction major drainage pipes were laid at intervals that bring significant quantities of water into the stream. This contributes to the rapid rise in the stream during rainfall.\n\nThe parish has no parish council and has a Parish Meeting which has limited responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover very limited permitted expenditure (basically minimal operating expenses and contribution to burial authority) and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish meeting helps evaluate local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish meeting's role also includes liaising with the district council over projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also matters that the parish meeting has a say on but no formal responsibility.\n\nThe village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wincanton Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. \n\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, major roads (except trunk routes such as the A303 which is the responsibility of the Highways Agency), public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\n\nIt is also part of the Somerton and Frome, a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nCompton Castle was built for Mr Hussey Hunt about 1825, in a Gothic style with large grounds, gatehouse, and lawns stretching down to a lake.\nIt should not be confused with Compton Castle (a fortified manor house in the village of Compton, about 5 miles (8.0 km) west of Torquay).\n\nThe Old Rectory has Georgian, additions to an earlier building. Recently this house and the church were used quite extensively in a serialised version of Jane Austen's \"Mansfield Park\".\n\nThe mainly 18th-century Manor House includes parts which date back to the 15th century.\n\nThe Crescent is a quarter circle of cottages built in about 1815 for farm workers, and originally known as Waterloo Crescent.\n\nThe church dates from the 15th century and is built of hamstone. In 1485 Sir Walter Pauncefoot left money for the building of the church and for a chantry at Compton Pauncefoot, where a priest could pray daily for his soul and for those of his immediate family. He also left several yards of differently coloured silks to be made into vestments. Until 1864 the church comprised a nave with south aisle and porch, and a tower at the west. The inner arches of the tower carried a spire of graceful proportions. The north aisle was added in 1864, and at the same time the two stone coffins (now in the churchyard by the yew tree) were removed.\n\nThe interior of the church can be viewed here and here. The font is 13th-century and is perfectly plain. There is a mass dial on the south wall. The frieze in the south aisle has part of a stone inscribed \"Anne Whyting 1535.\" In the wall under the sill of the adjacent window is a long stone panel divided into compartments, each containing a shield bearing coats of arms relating to the Whyting and Pauncefoot families.\n\nThe south wall of the chancel contains a piscina with a stone button in the centre of the bowl. Five stained glass windows in the church are signed — a rare phenomenon — by Jean-Baptiste Capronnier of Brussels. The west window is by Charles Eamer Kempe, 1896. The church's three bells were cast in 1627, and one of them has the royal arms inscribed. The chancel was panelled with oak in 1934. The church registers date from 1559.\n\nThe top of the spire became unsafe, and an appeal was launched in 1980, with the help of grants from the Department of the Environment and the Historic Churches Preservation Trust. These efforts raised £18,000 for the necessary work to be carried out. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. The church is part of the Camelot Group of Parishes in the Diocese of Bath & Wells.\n\n"}

{"id": "2279370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279370", "title": "Clay Belt", "text": "Clay Belt\n\nThe Clay Belt is a vast tract of fertile soil stretching between the Cochrane District in Ontario, and Abitibi County in Quebec, covering in total with of that in Ontario. It is generally subdivided into the Great Clay Belt to the north running eastward from Kapuskasing, past Lake Abitibi and on to Amos, and the V-shaped Lesser Clay Belt to its south, running from Englehart down to the Wabi River to the northern tip of Lake Timiskaming, and long the eastern side of Timiskaming and back up to Rouyn-Noranda. The Clay Belt is the result of the draining of the Glacial Lake Ojibway around 8,200 BP, whose lakebed sediment forms the modern landform. The Clay Belt is surrounded by the Canadian Shield, forming an island of \"southern flatlands\" in the midst of the hilly and rocky surroundings. Similar \"glaciolacustrine deposits\" dot the northern areas of Ontario, Quebec and Labrador.\n\nThe area was first mapped by Dr. Robert Bell and his assistant Arthur Barlow in 1887, as part of a wider series of surveys in northern Ontario. In 1899, Barlow wrote a report on the geology and natural resources of the area, which suggested that the rich belt of clay that lay north of Lake Temiskaming was ideal for agricultural settlement. The area has a rich clay soil, in contrast to the low fertility of the muskeg and exposed bedrock shield surrounding it. Moreover, the combination of its general fertility, flat topography, high water table and relative accessibility to an extensive network of roads for logging and mining make it suitable for some types of farming. The following year, the government announced plans to develop the area by tapping its natural resources.\n\nSoon after, Bernhard Eduard Fernow traveled the area at the behest of the federal Commission of Conservation, ostensibly to survey the area of the Canadian National Railway transcontinental main line (formerly the Grand Trunk) and the potential for fire. He makes extensive mention of the condition of the timber, and has a somewhat tempered view of their potential commercial value. He then moves on to a somewhat more positive report on the soil and its suitability for farming, saying its future is \"bright\". Wishing to avoid the \"Trent watershed\" problem, an earlier failed settlement attempt, he suggested setting up an experimental farm to test what \"treatment is necessary on the various soils\". Such a farm was set up in Kapuskasing on the west side of the river to explore and develop crops and systems for farming the area.\n\nThe Canadian government encouraged immigrants to settle there as farmers during and after World War I. Governments of the day were mistakenly impressed with the agricultural potential of the Great Clay Belt. Under the \"Soldier Settlement Act, 1917\" (shortly replaced by the \"Soldier Settlement Act, 1919\") the Soldier Settlement Board established the Kapuskasing Soldier Colony to settle veterans that had returned from the Great War. Settlers received homesteads, grants and guaranteed loans and were paid for clearing their own land. But by 1920 only nine of more than a hundred original settlers remained. The farming consisted of some grains, mostly oats, and vegetables.\n\nThe Ontario government also passed legislation in 1927 to enable the migration of farmers from barren lands in older parts of the Province, such as Haliburton County, to areas such as the Lesser Clay Belt through the exchange of land.\n\nIn spite of numerous rocky outcrops some farming was successfully established within the Great Clay Belt, however, it proved to be impractical because of the short growing season. The clay soil is tremendously fertile, but long snowy winters coupled with unpredictable rainfall during the short growing season meant most farming yielded little.\n\nBy 1935, immigration to the Great Clay Belt virtually ended. One farmer, describing why he returned to urban life, stated that, in the Great Clay Belt, \"there are seven months of snow, two months rain, and all the rest is black flies and mosquitoes.\" Some of the farmers returned to Toronto and Montreal. Some moved west to the prairie provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta once the National Transcontinental Railway was completed. Many of the farmers shifted to mining once minerals were found in the area. Others entered the logging industry. Some towns still remaining today include Cochrane, New Liskeard, Timmins, Kapuskasing, and Hearst.\n\nNeither the Great nor the Lesser Clay Belt seems able to attract any sort of sustainable industry to employ people for long periods of time. Both regions go through periodic boom and bust cycles, depending upon the fortunes of the pulp and paper industries, and the mining industries.\n\n\n"}

In her absence, the Council of Valdemar has been considering an offer of an alliance marriage between Princess Elspeth and the Prince of Hardorn, a young man named Ancar. While the Council is generally in favor, Queen Selenay has her suspicions about the idea, and she and Talia overrule the Council. Meanwhile, the budding lifebond between Talia and Herald Dirk is frustrated due to a misunderstanding - Dirk thinks Talia is in love with his best friend, the handsome Herald Kris. The problems of the kingdom occupy Talia's time so completely that she cannot speak to him, nor spend as much time with the young Princess as she used to. As a result, Dirk falls into depression (worsened by the death of a young Herald who was his special pupil) and begins drinking heavily. Elspeth, through the work of a trusted Councilor, Lord Orthallen, begins spending time with unsavory young men.\n\nDirk is falsely accused by Orthallen, and when Kris (Orthallen's nephew) does not immediately believe his innocence, the two have a falling-out. Dirk's slide into depression continues, and he neglects his health until he collapses from pneumonia.\n\nTalia becomes caught up in all of these seemingly unsolvable problems and briefly loses her emotional footing, but her friends reassure her that the lifebond will work itself out in time. Then things fall apart again; Elspeth's new circle of male friends plan to seduce and then disgrace the Princess. Talia arrives just in time; she drives off the young cad, and then she and Elspeth have an argument. Afterwards, Talia confesses what she has done to Queen Selenay, who reassures her that she did the right thing by scolding Elspeth. The Queen then sends Talia and Kris on a mission to Hardorn to investigate Prince Ancar, in case the alliance marriage could be pursued after all.\n\nTalia and Kris (who has resolved his quarrel with Dirk) arrive in Hardorn, and witness Ancar murdering his own father and the Hardornen court. As they themselves are trying to escape, Kris and his Companion are killed, and Talia, wounded, is taken prisoner. Rolan, Talia's Companion, escapes, and Talia is able to use him to deliver a message to Selenay and her retinue, who would otherwise have come into the city. Warned, the Queen stops at the border between Hardorn and Valdemar.\n\nTalia has managed to convey to them that Kris is dead and that there is no hope for her. In desperation, Dirk and Elspeth use their Gifts (she is able to see at great distances, he is able to lift and move objects with his mind) and the strength of the Companion herd to pull her out of Ancar's dungeon. She is severely injured, for Ancar has tortured and raped her, and she drank a large amount of poison as a suicide attempt. The impossible feat leaves both Elspeth and Dirk incapacitated for some time.\n\nTalia revives and remembers some information Ancar has told her; Orthallen is a secret agent who is working for Hardorn because Ancar has promised to give him the throne. Through his manipulations, he has been working in various ways to see to it that Elspeth never becomes Queen. The Princess and Talia set up a trap to reveal his guilt; when he attacks the two women, Elspeth executes him. While still in recovery, Talia makes Dirk understand that she loves him.

It is noted for a manor house and estate, formerly home to a wildlife park.\n\nThe name Cricket St Thomas is not related to the game of cricket, but is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word \"cruc,\" meaning a hill or ridge.\n\nThe estate is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it is described as \"Land of the Count of Martin\" paying tax to the king for six hides, or about . It also had two slaves, six villagers, five smallholders and a variety of livestock — all valued at 100 shillings.\n\nThe parish of Cricket St Thomas was part of the South Petherton Hundred.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\n\nThe parish falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Chard Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.\n\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\n\nIt is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nThe parish church is dedicated to St Thomas. It is based on Saxon and medieval origins, but was almost totally rebuilt in 1819 to 1820 for Samuel Hood, 2nd Baron Bridport. The church contains monuments to the families of Hood (Viscount Bridport) and their predecessors the Viscounts Nelson, who gained the title through Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson. These include, on the chancel south wall, a commemoration of Alexander Hood, who died in 1814, which was designed and signed by Sir John Soane, with a black marble base topped by a white marble monument on Ionic columns framing the memorial plaque. Mounted on the north nave wall is a fragment of the altar cloth used in the Coronation Service of Queen Elizabeth II. The church is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building.\n\nIn the churchyard is a white marble monument, dating from the early 20th century, showing a figure of St Michael. It commemorates Alexander Nelson Hood, 4th Duke of Bronté, 2nd First Viscount Bridport (created in 1868) who died in 1904. A note in the church states that for many years the statue was laid flat, as the white figure at night scared too many locals. There are also two 18th-century chest tombs, made from hamstone, one of which commemorates John Northcote, who died in 1738.\n\nCricket St Thomas manor house, known as Cricket House, has 14th-century origins, but was rebuilt and considerably modified at the beginning of the 19th century for Sir Alexander Hood under the direction of Sir John Soane.\nThe 19th-century orangery attached to the house was later turned into a parrot house but is now used for bowling by Warner holiday guests.\nIn the grounds is a small garden house known as The Admirals Seat.\n\nThe house was used as \"Grantleigh Manor\", the setting for the television series \"To the Manor Born\" which aired from 1979 to 1981. The Manor House was then owned by the father-in-law of the writer Peter Spence. Despite the closeness depicted on screen, the Manor and Lodge are in fact about one mile (1.6 km) apart.\nThe Lodge was given additional features such as gateposts to give the impression it was a gatehouse, following various previous alterations. The house was again used as \"Grantleigh Manor\" in a 25th anniversary special of \"To The Manor Born\" shown in 2007.\n\nIn 2009, the estate was added to English Heritage's Heritage At Risk register due to development pressures from various businesses connected with the estate. Its vulnerability is now classed as 'Medium'.\n\nThe grounds of the house, known as Cricket Park, were designed by D.D (David) Davis, a noted Horticulturist at the start of the 19th Century, and later turned into a wildlife park. The grounds also became home to Crinkley Bottom, a theme park created by Noel Edmonds around the Mr Blobby character from his hit television series \"Noel's House Party\". The project was short-lived and was later abandoned. The grounds reverted to their previous use and the wildlife park was home to 600 rare and endangered species including lemurs, primates, camels, reptiles and wildfowl. Questions were raised in the UK parliament in 1995 after a rare Asian elephant was euthanised at the park. The wildlife park closed in 2009 and most of the larger animals were moved to other zoos around the country. Some of the smaller animals, such as the lemurs, were kept and the park was returned to gardens and lakes, re-opening in mid-2010. The park has since closed again and very little remains of the enclosures or buildings.\nThe manor house was developed into a Warner Leisure Hotels resort in 1999.\n\nAs a result of pressure from the development of the hotel and leisure market, it has been added to the Heritage at Risk Register; despite areas being restored through Natural England's Environmental Stewardship scheme.\n\nCricket Park was also briefly the home of Crinkley Bottom, a theme park based around the BBC television show Noel's House Party. Mr Blobby's house, named 'Dunblobbin' situated at the rear of the park. Mr. Blobby, the house and its gardens opened as an attraction in 1994, but it closed within four years, shortly after Noel's House Party went off air. Other attractions at the park included a TV-themed dark ride and a walkthrough exhibit of Noddy's Toyland Adventures. Remains of the house and its 'blobbyland' theme park could still be seen until 2014, overgrown and strewn with fallen leaves and mud. Mr Blobby's house was demolished late 2014.\n\n"}

{"id": "2279412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279412", "title": "21 July 2005 London bombings", "text": "21 July 2005 London bombings\n\nOn Thursday 21 July 2005, four attempted bomb attacks disrupted part of London's public transport system two weeks after the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The explosions occurred around midday at Shepherd's Bush, Warren Street and Oval stations on the London Underground, and on London Buses route 26 in Bethnal Green on Hackney Road. A fifth bomber dumped his device without attempting to set it off.\n\nConnecting lines and stations were closed and evacuated. Metropolitan Police later said the intention was to cause large-scale loss of life, but only the detonators of the bombs exploded, probably causing the popping sounds reported by witnesses, and only one minor injury was reported. The suspects fled the scenes after their bombs failed to explode.\n\nOn Friday 22 July, CCTV images of four suspects wanted in connection with the bombings were released. Two of the men shown in these images were identified by police on Monday 25 July as Muktar Said Ibrahim and Yasin Hassan Omar. The resultant manhunt was described by the Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Ian Blair as \"the greatest operational challenge ever faced\" by the Met. During the manhunt, police misidentified Jean Charles de Menezes as one of the suspected bombers and shot and killed him.\n\nBy 29 July, police had arrested all four of the main bombing suspects from 21 July attempted bombings. Yasin Hassan Omar was arrested by police on 27 July, in Birmingham. On 29 July, two more suspects were arrested in London. A fourth suspect, Osman Hussein, was arrested in Rome, Italy, and later extradited to the UK. Police also arrested numerous other people in the course of their investigations.\n\nOn 9 July 2007, four defendants, Muktar Said Ibrahim, 29, Yasin Hassan Omar, 26, Ramzi Mohammed, 25, and Hussain Osman, 28, were found guilty of conspiracy to murder.<ref name=\"Four guilty over 21/7 bomb plot\"></ref> The four attempted bombers were each sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum of 40 years' imprisonment.\n\n\nIn each case, only the detonator caps fired and the bombs themselves did not go off; this may have been due to the low quality hydrogen peroxide used in the devices, which had been obtained from a large number of easily available sources. The explosions were small—only about as powerful as a large firework—and no injuries were reported, although a person who suffered an asthma attack was counted as the incident's sole injury.\n\nIn response to the blasts, the stations were all evacuated and other stations including Archway in North London, Moorgate, St. Paul's in the City and Green Park in the West End were also cleared. Many parts of the London Underground system including the Victoria line, Northern line, Hammersmith and City Line, Bakerloo line and Piccadilly line were suspended.\n\nSome eyewitnesses reported a \"strange smell\", described by some as resembling burning rubber, emanating from the Underground stations. Some early reports seem to be suggesting that the smell preceded the bang by several minutes. It appears that people on a train smelt a strange odour, and realised something was wrong. They ran from one carriage to another while the train was still moving and then heard an explosion behind them.\n\nEyewitnesses at the scenes reported seeing men running away from the site of the explosions, and there were unconfirmed suggestions that one of the bombers had been injured.\n\n\nThe vehicle involved was Stagecoach London Dennis Trident 2 (17762, LX03 BUU), identical in type to the bus destroyed on 7/7, and based at the same depot; Stratford (SD).\n\nIt was reported that one of the 7 July suspects, Jamal (Germaine) Lindsay, had bought £900 worth of perfumes immediately before the bombings, possibly to disguise the acrid smell of the decomposing explosives. Some witnesses reported seeing a white powder: TATP is a white crystalline powder. An eyewitness mentioned that as one of the explosions occurred there was a \"smell of vinegar\" which could be attributed to combustion byproducts of the explosive TATP.\n\nUniversity College Hospital, near Warren Street, was cordoned off at 14:30 BST, reportedly by armed police. Eyewitnesses reported seeing three armed police officers entering the building.\n\nBoth CNN and \"The Times\" reported that the armed police at University College Hospital were pursuing a suspected bomber who fled into the building following a chase on foot down Tottenham Court Road. Witnesses reported shots being fired as the man led police on the chase from Warren Street Underground station. Police say the \"gunshots\" may have actually been detonators going off.\n\nAn internal memo at the hospital told employees to look for a tall man with wires protruding from his clothing. The memo reportedly described the suspect as \"a black male, possibly of Asian origin, about 6 ft 2 in (188 cm) tall, wearing a blue top with wires protruding from the rear of the top.\" The BBC spoke to Prof Jim Ryan of UCH, who said he had not seen any such memo and dismissed the idea as \"absolute rumour.\" A BBC reporter, however, said that he had been given a copy of an email sent to staff asking them to look for the suspect.\n\nLater in the afternoon police said they had ended their armed operation at the hospital, but returned 30 minutes later. A Scotland Yard spokesman told the BBC: \"We've got our armed deployment at UCH but we can't discuss it further.\" There were conflicting reports on whether the redeployment was related to the bombings. CNN reported that sources told them police had returned to conduct a manhunt inside the building, but police said the deployment was unrelated to the explosions.\n\nAt 15:30, around two hours after the explosions, a major security alert occurred in Whitehall outside the Ministry of Defence during which a man was arrested by armed police. The man was ordered to lie on the pavement before being handcuffed and arrested, about 20 metres from Downing Street. He was also ordered to open his jacket and shirt before being taken by the police, presumably to allow police to see any hidden explosives that may have been on his person. He did not appear to be carrying any bags, and did not seem to be wearing a belt, although it was very hard for the reporter to see. The BBC reported (and television coverage showed) that he was wearing a small black backpack which the police had him remove before undoing his shirt.\n\nTwo other people were also arrested: one in the Whitehall area, and one near Tottenham Court Road, according to the BBC. But all were later released without any charges being brought against them.\n\nAccording to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair, the two arrests in Whitehall were \"totally unconnected\" to the earlier explosions.\n\nA security alert was declared, mid-afternoon, at St Albans railway station, north of London. The station was closed and the surrounding area evacuated following the discovery of an unattended backpack. A number 37 bus (Putney to Peckham) was also cordoned off after a \"suspect package\" was discovered. These incidents are both believed to be bomb scares.\n\nPolice shot and killed a Brazilian man, Jean Charles de Menezes, at Stockwell Underground station shortly after 10:00 on 22 July. Officers had pursued de Menezes from a location under surveillance, believing him to be one of the men wanted for the attacks of the previous day. They apparently believed de Menezes, who was claimed to be wearing a heavy jacket – later shown to be an ordinary denim jacket – was a possible suicide bomber.\n\nPolice later confirmed he was not related to the bombing incidents and issued an apology, saying that \"For somebody to lose their life in such circumstances is a tragedy and one that the Metropolitan Police Service regrets.\"\n\nServices on the Victoria line between Victoria and Brixton and on the Northern line between Kennington and Morden were suspended at the request of the police.\n\nSky and BBC News reported that the East London Mosque on Whitechapel Road in Whitechapel had been surrounded by armed police and that residents were told to stay indoors. The mosque was evacuated at about 10:30 and searched. However, police confirmed that it was a bomb scare and the all-clear was given after just over an hour.\n\nSecurity alerts continued into the weekend, with major disruption to London's transport system.\n\nOn 23 July, a suspect package was found in bushes in Little Wormwood Scrubs, just north of White City and Shepherd's Bush. It was subjected to a controlled explosion and appears to have been a further bomb made to the same design as the others used on 21 July. This led to speculation that a fifth bomber might be at large. Scotland Yard stated that they were looking for more than just the four men caught on CCTV, and by 29 July five suspected bombers had been arrested.\n\nLike other devices used on 21 July, the device was packed into a six-and-a-quarter-litre clear plastic food container with a white lid, manufactured by Delta of India, sold in about 100 outlets across the UK. The police made an appeal to retailers who may have sold five or more in the time period.\n\nIt was immediately apparent that the explosions were the result of an attempted terrorist attack, but it was initially unclear whether the explosions were a serious attempt to repeat 7 July bombings or were merely a symbolic attack or hoax intended to cause panic rather than mass casualties. The explosives used by the bombers consisted of Chapatti flour powder mixed with liquid hydrogen peroxide, detonated by a booster charge. This was not the same explosive mixture used by the bombers in the 7/7 bombings two weeks earlier, which had used TATP. It was later confirmed that substantial improvised explosive devices capable of causing significant numbers of casualties had in fact been involved, but had failed to explode. The explosions were caused by detonators which failed to detonate the main explosive charge. Police later disclosed that some of the devices used had survived the explosions and were available for forensic investigation.\n\nBoth sets of bombings involved three Underground trains and a bus; in both cases, rucksacks were involved; and in both cases, the three Underground explosions were roughly simultaneous while the bus explosion was an hour later. Moreover, in both cases, the four explosion locations were dispersed around central London in such a way that they could be reasonably said to have occurred \"in the north, south, east, and west,\" recalling the wording of several Islamist manifestos.\n\nIt was later reported that three of the four devices were of similar size and weight to those used on 7 July, with the fourth being housed in a smaller plastic box; all were said to have used the same type of explosive.\n\nLate Thursday night, a group calling itself the Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigade, after a nickname for one of Osama bin Laden's lieutenants who was killed in a 2001 airstrike in Afghanistan, posted a statement claiming responsibility for the attempted bombings. The group vowed that the terror would continue as long as Europe's soldiers were in Iraq. The group also claimed responsibility for the 7 July 2005 London bombings, the 2004 Madrid train bombings, and the 2003 North America blackout. Experts doubt the legitimacy of the group, as security experts have discredited the claims of the Madrid attack, and investigators have ruled out sabotage as a cause of the blackout. In its statement, the group cited Rome, Amsterdam and Copenhagen as future targets. However, the group has made threats in the past that it has failed to carry out. The group has also previously falsely claimed responsibility for events that were the result of technical problems, such as the 2003 London blackout and Northeast Blackout of 2003.\n\nSeveral individuals were reported to have been arrested on 22 July in connection with the bombings, including one man in Stockwell—the area where the shooting incident took place—and another man at a Snow Hill railway station in the city of Birmingham who was soon released without charge. The former may be among the individuals seen running away from the scenes of the incidents who were caught on CCTV footage. Police released images of people they wished to question with regards to the attempted bombings captured from London transport CCTV cameras.\n\nOn 25 July, two of the suspects were named by police as Yasin Hassan Omar and Muktar Said Ibrahim (also known as Muktar Mohammed Said). Yasin Hassan Omar is suspected of trying to detonate the device at Warren Street tube station and Muktar Said Ibrahim is suspected of trying to detonate the device on the bus. The Home Office has stated that both men have legally been residents for at least ten years.\n\nOn Wednesday 27 July, police arrested Omar in Birmingham. A suspect package was found in the course of his arrest. Three further arrests were also made in Birmingham. This raid was raised because the caretaker of the area found around 10 large bottles of hair dye, which can be used in explosives, and he was suspicious so called a low level police contact.\n\nMajor police raids occurred in west London on 29 July. It has been reported that a further two of the pictured suspects, Muktar Said Ibrahim and Ramzi Mohammed, were arrested in the course of these raids, while the Shepherd's Bush suspect – Osman Hussain – was arrested in Rome that day. The men arrested in London were apparently the suspects wanted in connection with the Oval tube and bus bombing attempts, and the man arrested in Rome is the Shepherd's Bush suspect. A European Arrest Warrant for Osman Hussain was issued by the Metropolitan Police, and he was extradited to the UK where he was charged on 8 December 2005. In addition the suspected fifth bomber Whabi Mohammad, 22, the brother of Ramzi Mohammad, was also under arrest by 28 July.\n\nOn 7 August 2005, Yasin Hassan Omar, Muktar Said Ibrahim, and Ramzi Mohammed were charged with attempting to murder passengers and being in possession of an explosive substance. Along with a fourth man, Manfo Kwaku Asiedu, they were also charged with conspiring to murder passengers.\n\nOn 26 February 2008, a Tanzanian-born Muslim man who dubbed himself \"Osama bin London\" was found guilty of encouraging his followers to murder non-believers and of running violent Islamist training camps in Britain. Mohammed Hamid, 50, who came to England when he was five, was convicted along with three followers – Kibley da Costa, 25, Mohammed al-Figari, 45, and Kader Ahmed, 20 – whom the jury found guilty of attending the training camps. A fifth suspect, Atilla Ahmet, 43, who once boasted of being Al Qaeda's top figure in Europe, admitted three charges of soliciting murder at the start of the complex four-month trial at Woolwich Crown Court. The trial was closely watched in Britain as Hamid was accused of providing the inspiration for the men who tried to carry out suicide bombings on London's transport system on 21 July 2005.\n\nMuktar Said Ibrahim, Manfo Kwaku Asiedu, Hussein Osman, Yasin Hassan Omar, Ramzi Mohammed and Adel Yahya began trial in relation to the attacks of 21 July 2005 at Woolwich Crown Court on 15 January 2007. The case was anticipated to last for 'up to four months,' but in fact the jury only retired to consider the verdict on 28 June 5½ months later.\n\nOn 9 July 2007, the jury found Muktar Said Ibrahim, Yasin Hassan Omar, Ramzi Mohammed, and Hussain Osman guilty of conspiracy to murder.\n\nIn November 2007, Manfo Kwaku Asiedu admitted conspiracy to cause explosions while a charge of conspiracy to murder was dropped. Adel Yahya pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.\n\nIn April 2008 the Court of Appeal judges dismissed a challenge by Ibrahim, Omar, Mohammed and Osman to their convictions.\n\nDecember 2014 an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights lodged in 2008 by Ibrahim, Omar and Mohammed claiming that their rights were breached in the 'safety interviews' after their arrests was rejected.\n\nIn the afternoon of 22 July, house raids were conducted on Harrow Road in West London (approximately a mile from Paddington railway station). The road was cordoned off by armed police and some eyewitnesses reported seeing a bomb-disabling robot.\n\nOn 25 July police announced that they had raided a property in north London. The property was a council flat in Curtis House, Ladderswood Way, New Southgate in which Yasin Hassan Omar had been living since 1999. No arrests were made in the raid although two men have been arrested in the area. Later reports suggested that explosives may have been found at the raided address.\n\nThe BBC has a summary of raids to date.\n\nMajor raids were carried out by the police on 29 July in the Notting Hill and North Kensington areas of West London. Three people were arrested during these raids, including two of the suspects who were thought to have carried out the failed bombing attempt. (see Wikinews article).\n\nOn 26 July it was reported that police had seized a vehicle abandoned in East Finchley, north London. The BBC reported that the vehicle was a white VW Golf which was not owned by any of the suspects but which was thought to have been used by them.\n\nAs of 8 August 2005 the following people had been charged in relation to 21 July or 7 July bombing attempts:\n\nAs of 8 August, the following individuals were being held by police in relation to 21 July or 7 July bombing attempts:\n\nAs of 8 August, the following individuals had been released from custody after being held by police in relation to 21 July or 7 July bombing attempts:\n\n\nDuring the initial investigation in Rome, Hussain said he was motivated to participate in the attacks after viewing videos of war-torn Iraq. \"I am against war,\" Osman said \"I've marched in peace rallies and nobody listened to me. I never thought of killing people.\" He claimed that the bombs were never meant to detonate or kill anybody, only to draw attention to the Iraq war.\n\nOther news sources reported that the bombers watched videos of women and children killed in Iraq by British and American troops before embarking on their mission. Some quoted him as\nsaying \"Muktar showed us some DVDs with images of the war in Iraq, especially women and children killed by American and British soldiers,\" Hussain said, adding that they were not to talk about these videos with others.\n\n\"There was a feeling of hatred and conviction that it was necessary to give signal—to do something.\" Hussain denied links with either the Al-Qaeda or the 7 July bombers.\n\nPrime Minister Tony Blair, Home Secretary Charles Clarke, and other ministers and key officials from government and the emergency services attended a meeting in COBR. Blair interrupted a meeting with Prime Minister of Australia John Howard to attend a COBR meeting, although he and Howard later gave a joint news conference in response to the attacks on both the London Underground and Bethnal Green (Howard was also in Washington, D.C., at the time of the 11 September 2001 attacks.) Whitehall, the main artery serving the governmental district, was initially sealed off and evacuated, but was reopened at 14:45. It was subsequently closed again around 15:25 following an arrest and a bomb scare, both of which were fairly quickly resolved.\n\nSir Ian Blair, the Met police chief, described the incident as \"serious\" but said that there were \"fewer injuries\", caused by bombs that appeared to be \"much smaller than those used on 7 July\".\n\nThe police advised people to stay where they were and not travel unless absolutely necessary. However, people living within a 300 metre radius of the bomb sites were evacuated, due to worries about chemical agents being used. By about 16:00, however, Sir Ian Blair described the situation as \"firmly under control\" and urged London \"to get ... moving again\".\n\nAccording to the \"Evening Standard\", stranded commuters and evacuated locals in Shepherd's Bush held an impromptu street party during the evening of 21 July, in the vicinity of the crime scene, which lasted until the early morning. Music was provided by a peace activism group, and several photographs of this appeared in London's local press the following day.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister John Howard condemned the attack on the London Underground and Bethnal Green stated that Australia stood by Britain and that people should \"beware the minds of terrorists\" during a press conference with Tony Blair.\n\nThe United States Department of State informed President George W. Bush of the attacks and The Pentagon raised its security level in response to the incidents in central London and Bethnal Green. In addition, New York City Police Commissioner, Raymond Kelly announced that they would begin randomly searching backpacks on the New York City Subway system, though they have said that this move had been under consideration before the events in London.\n\nChina Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao has said that \"China thoughts are with the peoples of London\" by this tragedy and once again \"condemned\" any terrorist attacks targeted at civilians.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

This type of right is available in many countries but, notably, not in the United States, United Kingdom or Canada. Although a utility model is similar to a patent, it is generally cheaper to obtain and maintain, has a shorter term (generally 6 to 15 years), shorter grant lag, and less stringent patentability requirements. In some countries, it is only available for inventions in certain fields of technology and/or only for products. Utility models can be described as second-class patents.\n\nWhile no international convention requires countries to protect utility models (unlike copyright, trade marks or patents) and they are not subject to the TRIPS agreement, they are subject to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, which means that countries that do protect utility models are required to comply with rules such as national treatment and priority. Utility models are also available (in countries that have a utility model system) via the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) system of international patent applications.\n\nA utility model is a statutory exclusive right granted for a limited period of time (the so-called \"term\") in exchange for an inventor providing sufficient teaching of his or her invention to permit a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art to perform the invention. The rights conferred by utility model laws are similar to those granted by patent laws, but are more suited to what may be considered as \"incremental inventions\". Specifically, a utility model is a \"right to prevent others, for a limited period of time, from commercially using a protected invention without the authorization of the right holder(s).\" \n\nTerms such as \"petty patent\", \"innovation patent\", “short-term patents”, \"minor patent\", and \"small patent\" are generally considered to fall within the definition of \"utility model\". The German and Austrian utility model is called the \"\"Gebrauchsmuster\"\", which influenced some other countries such as Japan.\n\nMost countries having utility model laws require that the invention be new. However, many patent or utility model offices do not conduct substantive examination and merely grant the utility model after checking that utility model applications comply with formalities. This is why for a utility model the granting process is sometimes called simply registration of the utility model. Furthermore, some countries exclude particular subject-matter from utility model protection. For example, in some countries, methods (i.e., processes), chemical substances, plants and animals are barred from utility model protection.\n\nThe law in Australia provides for the grant of a utility model known, since 2001, as an innovation patent. From 1979 to 2001, a similar regime existed under the name \"petty patent\". For an innovation patent to be valid the invention claimed must be novel and involve an innovative step. An invention will lack novelty if it has already been disclosed to the public through prior publication or prior use anywhere in the world. Publication within a \"grace period\" of 12 months prior to the filing date of an innovation patent with the consent of the applicant is not considered to form part of the prior art for the assessment of novelty. The innovative step requirement is supposedly a lesser requirement than the inventive step required for a standard patent under Australian law. An invention will involve an innovative step if there are differences between the invention and the prior art, that make a substantial contribution to the working of the invention.\n\nAn innovation patent is granted automatically after a formalities check without substantive examination, however, infringement proceedings cannot be instituted unless and until the innovation patent has been certified, which requires a substantive examination. Examination cannot proceed until the innovation patent has been granted. Innovation patents have a maximum term of eight years subject to payment of annual renewal fees payable from the second anniversary of the date of filing. Innovation patents are available to persons outside Australia, but an Australian address for service must be provided. Innovation patent specifications must be prepared by a registered patent attorney unless the application proceeds as a Convention application or as a divisional application. Innovation patent applications cannot proceed as national phase of an international patent application (see Patent Cooperation Treaty), but can proceed as a divisional application from an international patent application that is open to public inspection.\n\nIn 1997, the European Commission proposed the harmonisation of utility model laws across all EU countries. In 1999, the proposal was updated. No agreement could be reached, and in 2006 the proposal was withdrawn.\n\nIn Germany, a utility model is considered to be new if it does not form part of the state of the art. The state of the art comprises any knowledge made available to the public by means of a written description or by use within Germany before the date relevant for the priority of the application. Description or use within the six months preceding the date relevant for the priority of the application shall not be taken into consideration if it is based on the conception of the applicant or his predecessor in title.\n\nIn Italy, a utility model (in Italian: 'Modello d'utilità') is considered to be new if it does not form part of the state of the art. The state of the art comprises any knowledge made available to the public by means of a written or oral disclosure, anywhere in the World, before the filing date of the application or the priority date (if claimed). The utility model must also involve an inventive step, i.e. machines, devices or items which are claimed in the utility models must be more effective and/or easier to use than the ones according to prior art. Utility models cannot claim processes or methods. At the time of filing the application a filing fee is due which also covers the maintenance for years 1 to 4. No claim fee is provided. The Italian Patent and Trademark Office (UIBM) does not perform substantive examination of the application in order to assess novelty and inventive step of what is claimed; the examination is limited to formal requirements only. Publication occurs at 18 months from the filing date or the oldest priority date, if any; at the time of filing the application the applicant may request advance publication, which normally occurs within 90 days. In any case only bibliographic data are published after 1 month from the filing. Grant generally occurs within 2 years. The validity of an Italian utility model is ascertained by the Judge and his/her technical expert, during litigation. At the end of the fourth year from the filing of the application, a maintenance fee for the years 5 to 10 falls due. Foreign companies/residents must indicate an address of service in Italy, that may correspond to the domicile of a lawyer or, as always occurs, a chartered patent attorney.\n\nIn Japan, a utility model is considered to be new if it has not been made available to the public by means of a written description or by use before the date relevant for the priority of the application (same as for patents). Japanese utility models are not subject to substantive examination, but the owner must request one or more \"reports on technical opinion\" before instituting infringement proceedings.\n\nIn Spain, the novelty requirement for obtaining a utility model () is \"relative\", i.e. only public written disclosure of the invention in Spain is prejudicial against the novelty of the invention claimed in the utility model. This is in sharp contrast with Spanish patents for which absolute novelty is required. What constitutes a \"disclosure of the invention \"in Spain\"\" has been the subject of two decisions of the Spanish Supreme Court, in 1996 and 2004.\n\nUtility model applications may be prepared and filed at local patent offices in countries where utility model protection is available.\n\nThe table below is a list of countries having utility model protection under various names as at March 2008.\n\n(†) The members of ARIPO (Lusaka Agreement) are: Botswana, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.<br>\n(*) The Dutch short-term patent is no longer granted since June 5, 2008.<br>\n(+) A Malaysian Utility Innovation cannot be filed directly from a PCT, but it can be interconverted from a national phase patent application.<br>\n(‡) The members of OAPI are: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Togo.\n"}

Indeed, [he is] ... an original voice celebrating music.\"\n\nJeremy Joseph Beck was born January 15, 1960, in Painesville, Ohio. His father, Albert William Beck (b. April 4, 1931, in Scranton, Pennsylvania; d. May 16, 2018 in Quincy, Illinois), known as \"Al\", was a visual artist and poet who taught for many years at Culver-Stockton College in Canton, Missouri. His mother, Mila Katrine Aho (b. June 24, 1935, Painesville, Ohio; d. March 26, 2018 in Memphis, Tennessee), known as \"Katrine\", was a pianist and organist who taught music privately. Beck's parents married in 1958, but not without some controversy: the Beck family was Jewish and the Aho family was Lutheran. Albert's parents agreed to support the wedding as long as the Ahos knew they were Jewish. Katrine's parents agreed to support the wedding only if Katrine's father – Gustav Axel Aho, also known as \"G.A. Aho\", a Lutheran minister – performed the ceremony in his own church. Under those conditions, the nuptials took place.\nThe family lived briefly in and around Cleveland, Ohio, before moving to Kansas City for a year, 1967–68, where Al served as Dean of Students at the Kansas City Art Institute. The family then settled in Quincy, Illinois. Beck's parents were divorced in 1977.\n\nBeck's earliest musical studies were with his mother; he then began playing the cello in the 4th grade in Quincy. While in high school, Beck studied music composition and theory privately with Thom Ritter George, an Eastman graduate and conductor of the Quincy Symphony Orchestra. Following his graduation from high school in 1978, Beck moved to New York City, earning a B.S. in Composition from the Mannes College of Music where he studied with David Loeb. He later earned a master's degree in composition from Duke University where he studied with Stephen Jaffe and Thomas Oboe Lee. Following his studies at Duke, Beck completed a second master's degree and a doctoral degree in composition at the Yale School of Music, studying with Jacob Druckman, Martin Bresnick, Lukas Foss, and Allen Forte.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale, Beck taught music composition and theory at the University of Northern Iowa, earning tenured there in 1998. Beck took a leave of absence from UNI to teach for a year at Chatham College in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. However, instead of returning to Iowa, in 1999, Beck accepted a position as an associate professor of music composition and theory at California State University, Fullerton, where he also earned tenure, in 2002. During his teaching years, Beck was invited to teach and lecture on American music, music theory, and composition around the world, including in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Ghana.\n\nIn 2002, Beck accepted a short-term teaching position at the University of Louisville. Following a change in the administration and the loss of his position, Beck decided to pursue a law degree, graduating from the university's Brandeis School of Law in 2007. In addition to his continuing work in composition, now Beck is also a practicing attorney in Louisville, Kentucky. He blends his music background into his entertainment law practice, with an emphasis on copyright, trademark, and contracts.\n\nBeck has released five CDs of his music on the innova label. The critic Donald Rosenberg describes the music on Beck's most recent CD, \"String Quartets\" (2013), as \"forceful and expressive … concise in structure and generous in tonal language, savouring both the dramatic and the poetic,\" while Joshua Kosman of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" states Beck's music is \"appealing and skillfully crafted … [with] lush tonal harmonies.\" Kosman further observes that \"novelty isn't the only thing music can provide, and the moody expressiveness of Beck's writing is its own reward.\"\n\nBeck's 2011 CD, \"IonSound Project\", features the ensemble-in-residence at the University of Pittsburgh. His music on this recording has been described as \"uplifting, buoyant and ... emotional and sensitive to both the performer and the listener.\" In addition, critic Andrew Sigler finds Beck's music \"rhythmically intricate, and makes nods to the past while sitting squarely in the present. … Though architecturally rigorous, Beck writes clearly and without pretense[.]\"\n\nBeck's third innova CD, \"Never Final, Never Gone\" (2008), features a variety of chamber and vocal music.\n\nHis second CD, \"pause and feel and hark\", released in May 2006, includes \"Black Water\", a monodrama based on the novel by Joyce Carol Oates. \"Black Water\" received its Australian concert premiere at the 2012 Adelaide Fringe Festival. The stage premiere of this monodrama was produced by the Center for Contemporary Opera at Symphony Space on April 29, 2016 in New York City.\n\nIn 2004, \"Wave\" – a Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra CD devoted to Beck's music – was released on the Innova label. This recording includes his four-movement \"Sinfonietta\" for string orchestra, \"a harmonically inventive, thoroughly engaging work.\" The disc also includes his operatic soliloquy, \"Death of a Little Girl With Doves\", for soprano and orchestra. This \"deeply attractive\" composition is based on the life and letters of the sculptor Camille Claudel. The recording of this major work was heralded for its \"imperious melodic confidence, fluent emotional command and yielding tenderness.\"\n\nBeck's short comic opera, \"Review\", with a libretto by Patricia Marx, was one of three finalists in the 2010 National Opera Association's New Chamber Opera Competition. It was performed by Oberlin Opera Theater in February, 2014, and twice by Peabody Opera: in October, 2011 in Baltimore, and in Richmond, Virginia, at the College Music Society's annual convention. \"Review\" was previously included in the 2009 Opera America and Houston Grand Opera New Works Sampler. Following that successful showcase, \"Review\" was then produced by the Moores Opera Center at the University of Houston and later was given its New York premiere by the Center for Contemporary Opera.\n\nBeck's opera \"The Biddle Boys and Mrs. Soffel\" was named by the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" as one of the Top Ten Cultural Events in Pittsburgh for the year 2001.\n\nWith a libretto by the composer based on a novel by Joyce Carol Oates, his monodrama \"Black Water\" received its stage premiere on April 29, 2016. Produced by the Center for Contemporary Opera, the sold-out production at Symphony Space's Thalia Theater in New York City featured Laura Bohn, soprano, and Isabella Dawis, piano, with music direction by Lidiya Yankovskaya and stage direction by Eugenia Arsenis.\n\nBeck has earned awards, grants and honors from the American Composers Orchestra, California Arts Council, the Los Angeles Chapter of the American Composers Forum, Kentucky Arts Council, Millay Colony for the Arts, Wellesley Composers Conference, Oregon Bach Festival, and the Iowa Arts Council.\n"}

{"id": "2279432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279432", "title": "Eden, New South Wales", "text": "Eden, New South Wales\n\nEden is a coastal town in the South Coast region of New South Wales, Australia. The town is south of the state capital Sydney and is the most southerly town in New South Wales, located between Nullica Bay to the south and Calle Calle Bay, the northern reach of Twofold Bay, and built on undulating land adjacent to the third-deepest natural harbour in the southern hemisphere, and Snug Cove on its western boundary. At the , Eden had a population of 3,151.\n\nThe eastern coastline has rugged cliffs at the southern end and a wide, sandy surf beach, Aslings Beach, north of the cliffs. The beach ends at the entrance to Lake Curalo, a safe boating inlet of Twofold Bay. Although the urban settlement of Eden commenced in 1843 the settlement was not officially proclaimed as a township until 20 March 1885. The town's main industries include fishing, forestry, and tourism.\n\nThe local Aboriginal people who lived in the region prior to the arrival of Europeans were the Thaua, or Thawa, people of the Yuin nation.\n\nWhaling ships had been operating in the area in 1791. George Bass first took shelter in Twofold Bay on the return leg of a voyage to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) in February 1798, having noted the bay on the southward leg of this same voyage in December 1797. Later, in September of that year, on a subsequent voyage with Matthew Flinders, he and Flinders surveyed the bay for the first time. They also made first contact with the local Thawa Aboriginal people on this occasion.\n\nThe Australian botanist, Allan Cunningham, landed at Snug Cove in December 1817 so that he could collect botanical specimens from the district.\n\nThe first whaling station, for shore whaling, was established in the area by John Raine in 1828. Local Aboriginal people were employed in the whaling industry. In 1834 the Imlay brothers, Alexander, George and Peter, set up a whaling station at Snug Cove. Nearby they built a small slab and bark hut, the first-known building erected at Eden. Sketches of the hut were made by Sir Oswald Brierly in 1842 and by Captain Owen Stanley from HMS \"Rattlesnake\" in 1843. In around 1860 Davidson commenced a partnership with the Solomon family of Eden-Monaro. Initially the prevalent orcas were seen by the partnership as a nuisance. But the boat crews employed, Yuin aboriginals, refused to kill orcas, and a new policy encouraged collaboration between whalers and the killer whales; the killer whales would trap humpback whales that entered Twofold Bay, the whales would then be harpooned, and the orcas rewarded with prize pieces of the humpback carcasses.\n\nThe graziers from the Monaro district inland from Twofold Bay were seeking a better way to transport their cattle to Hobart, Tasmania. It was decided to establish cattle-handling facilities and an accompanying township on an appropriate site on Twofold Bay. Thus, in 1834, the Home Government authorised the captain of HMS \"Alligator\" to seek an appropriate site for a settlement on Twofold Bay. Early in 1835 the Governor of New South Wales, Governor Richard Bourke, visited Twofold Bay and the site of the proposed new settlement on board HMS \"Hyacinth\".\n\nEventually the area for the proposed town, to be called Eden, was surveyed in 1842 by Mr Thomas Townsend, the Government Surveyor. The main street, Imlay Street, was named after the Imlay brothers who were early pioneers to the district. Other streets were named after Lieutenant Flinders, George Bass, Queen Victoria and her consort, Prince Albert. A wharf was built out into a cove, now named Cattle Bay, from a site on the western edge of Eden, where cattle could be grazed prior to their being loaded onto the ships. Cattle were also grazed on Lookout Point until 1853, then this land was subdivided for housing.\n\nEden was named after George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland, the British Secretary for the Colonies, Baron Auckland, whose family name was Eden. After the town plan was finalised the first blocks were auctioned on 9 March 1843. The land was sold to Thomas Aspinall, Benjamin Boyd, S. Clinton, Lewes Gordon, W. Hirst, James Kirwan, J.P. Robinson and T.A. Townsend.\n\nThe first postmaster was appointed in 1843 but the first post office did not open until 1847. The Customs House was built in Eden in 1848. Earlier the first customs officer was appointed in 1846 but he was located at East Boyd initially, until the customs house was constructed.\n\nEden grew in the 1850s following the decline of nearby Boydtown, and the discovery of gold in Kiandra, which led to the 1859–1860 gold rush. For a few hectic months hundreds of gold seekers landed at Eden, replenished their supplies then headed for Kiandra. With the winter snow falls at Kiandra came the hurried exodus of those same people keen to leave the district as soon as possible. For a short period Eden flourished, only to quickly return to its usual quiet pace again.\n\nIn the 1850s there were four hotels in Eden. One of these hotels, the \"Crown and Anchor\" first licensed in 1845, still stands. It is no longer licensed but it still provides accommodation to travellers. Just south of this building is another built in 1850 as a commercial premises. Various businesses occupied the site. The building is now used as a private dwelling. The first government school started in 1857. The school attached to St Joseph's Roman Catholic church commenced in 1888. There were also several private tutors in Eden.\n\nThe shipping of cattle from Eden ceased in the late 1890s. Prior to that the business had expanded to include the shipping of cattle to South Australia, Queensland and to New Zealand.\n\nBecause Eden is equidistant between Sydney and both Melbourne and Tasmania, the port town was considered as a location for the Australian capital following Australian Federation in 1901. However, the ‘Limestone Plains’ in southern New South Wales were chosen instead as the location of the new city of Canberra.\n\nWhaling declined in the 1920s and ended in 1930.\n\nAccording to the 2016 census of Population, there were 3,151 people in Eden.\n\nFrom its inception Eden was located in the County of Auckland, named earlier after the Earl of Auckland from whom Eden also took its name. However, the County of Auckland was not considered to be within the bounds of the Colony of New South Wales until many years after the settlement of Eden commenced.\n\nThe town of Eden lies within the Bega Valley Shire local government area. \nIt is within the federal electorate of Eden-Monaro, which has for a long time been a key marginal seat, resulting in significant focus by the media and political parties during election campaigns. It is represented in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly by the electorate of Bega.\n\nHorse-racing commenced in Eden in the mid-1850s and continued until the mid-1920s. The racecourse was located on the northern bank of Lake Curalo.\n\nA number of industries are based in the town in the mid-2000s. These are mainly related to the tourist industry and include a wide variety of accommodation, places to eat and entertainment, especially fishing and sailing. As well, cruises of Twofold Bay and for whale-watching leave the Eden Wharf located in Snug Cove. The cruise of Nullica Bay, Twofold Bay, allows close views of the two major wharves mentioned in the article on Twofold Bay.\n\nTourism contributes AU$180 million yearly to the economy of the shire, which includes Bega and several other towns. The area receives 550,000 visitors annually. Many people visit Eden for whale watching as whales migrate from Antarctic to tropical waters in June and July, and back again later in the year.\n\nA significant fishing fleet is based in the harbour (Snug Cove). A tuna cannery opened in the town in 1949. It was closed in 1999, at the cost of many jobs. Sawmilling of timber has also been an important local industry for most of the life of the town. For over one hundred years the collection and export of wattle-bark was also a major local industry.\n\nWhaling played a very important role in the town's economy for over 100 years before its decline in the area in the 1920s and its end in 1930. [Eden’s Killer Whale Museum] informs visitors of the history of whaling in the area and the role of orcas (killer whales) led by Old Tom in herding whales into the harbour and helping whalers kill them. The whalers rewarded the orcas by allowing them to eat the lips and tongues of the dead whales.\n\nThe Port of Eden is one of two regional ports in New South Wales administered by the New South Wales Maritime Authority, the other is at Yamba on the North Coast. The Port of Eden is the largest fishing port in New South Wales. The major export handled by the port is woodchips. The port is shared with the Department of Defence who have constructed a large wharf for the servicing of their warships. The port also handles cruise ships.\n\nFrom the 1850s to 1950s the port was serviced by the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company.\n\n\n\n"}

It is on the Fivehead River (also known as the River Ile), east of Taunton in the South Somerset district. The village has a population of 306.\n\nAt the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 the manor was held by Roger de Courselles, also the owner of Fisherton in Wiltshire, which was held under Curry. It later passed to the Malet (also spelt as Mallet or Mallett) family, with William Malet, one of the guarantors of the Magna Carta, lord of the manor in 1215. It passed on through the descendants of the Malet family until 1356 when it was sold to Sir Matthew Gourney and his family until 1443 when the estate passed to the king and became part of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nCurry Mallet was part of the hundred of Abdick and Bulstone.\n\nThe Manor House is a Grade II* listed building, includes a Great Hall (or perhaps a barn) of the 15th century, and a small irregular manor house of the late 16th century. It stands on the site of, and incorporates parts of, the castle built by William Malet, a Norman knight who fought at the Battle of Hastings.The entrance hall extension and other parts were upgraded and connected with the main house c 1939 by Clough Williams-Ellis whose client was the Selous family. The Manor House was lived in by the Pyne family who are buried in an Elizabethan family tomb to be found in the Mallet Chapel in the village Church of St James. Elizabeth II visited the house as part of her duties when she was head of the Duchy of Cornwall.

{"id": "2279439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279439", "title": "British Rail Class 20", "text": "British Rail Class 20\n\nThe British Rail (BR) Class 20, otherwise known as an English Electric Type 1, is a class of diesel-electric locomotive. In total, 228 locomotives in the class were built by English Electric between 1957 and 1968, the large number being in part because of the failure of other early designs in the same power range to provide reliable locomotives.\n\nThe locomotives were originally numbered D8000–D8199 and D8300–D8327. They are known by railway enthusiasts as \"Choppers\".\n\nDesigned around relatively basic technology, the 73-tonne locomotives produce and can operate at up to . Designed to work light mixed freight traffic, they have no train heating facilities. Locomotives up to D8127 were fitted with disc indicators in the style of the steam era; when headcodes were introduced in 1960 the locomotive’s design was changed to incorporate headcode boxes. Although older locomotives were not retro-fitted with headcode boxes, a few of the earlier batch acquired headcode boxes as a result of repairs. Unusually for British designs, the locomotive had a single cab. This caused serious problems with visibility when travelling nose first, though in these circumstances the driver's view is comparable to that on the steam locomotives that the Class 20s replaced. It was common however to find Class 20s paired together at the nose, with their cabs at opposite ends, ensuring that the driver could quite clearly see the road ahead.\n\nThe Class 20 saw only limited service on passenger trains. A small number were fitted with a through pipe for steam heating, primarily for use in conjunction with a Class 27 locomotive on the West Highland Line. Otherwise their use was limited to summer relief services, particularly to Skegness often under the adopted title of The Jolly Fisherman starting from various places including Burton-on-Trent, Stoke-on-Trent, Derby and Leicester. Also occasionally other holiday resorts on the east coast of England, occasional duties as a pilot, and short distance diversions of electric-hauled trains over non-electrified lines.\n\nThe shift of light mixed freight to the road network left British Rail with an oversupply of small locomotives. The Class 20s, however, could work in multiple and so handle heavier traffic. Most spent the majority of their working lives coupled nose to nose in pairs to provide a more useful unit and to solve the visibility problems.\n\nMost have now been withdrawn but a few remain with GBRf and other minor and industrial operators. Several that are usually operated singly have been fitted with nose-mounted video cameras as a way of solving the visibility problems.\n\nThe Série 1400 locomotives of Portuguese Railways (CP) are based on the BR Class 20s.\n\nThe first batch of Class 20s were allocated to Devons Road depot in Bow, London to work cross-London transfer freights, with the following eight locos allocated to Hornsey depot. After a trial with D8006, D8028–D8034 were allocated for work in highland Scotland, and had tablet catcher recesses built into the cabsides. D8035–D8044 were originally to be allocated to Norwich, but were actually used for empty coaching stock (ECS) workings in and out of London Euston. D8050–D8069 were allocated to the new Tinsley TMD in South Yorkshire, from where they regularly worked into Lincolnshire and Humberside. D8070–D8127 were sent to operate in the Scottish lowlands, particularly in the Forth-Clyde area, and the Fife coalfield. This completed the original orders for 128 locos, the last being delivered in August 1962.\n\nWith the subsequent order for a further 100 Class 20 locos, deliveries recommenced with D8128 in January 1966. Tests in 1967 using D8179 and D8317 resulted in locos from D8316 being delivered from the manufacturer with the new electronic control system for working merry-go-round (MGR) coal trains. Trains to Longannet Power Station sometimes required locos to triple-head trains.\n\nSome Class 20s were used on the construction of the Channel Tunnel and High Speed 1 and some even made their way to France to work for the Compagnie des chemins de Fer Départementaux (CFD) in industry there, although these have since been repatriated. Some locos have in the past been hired by Hunslet-Barclay to provide motive power for weedkilling trains.\n\nThe fleet of Class 20/3s owned by Direct Rail Services (DRS) has at times seen frequent work across Britain in pairs (or with Class 37s) on nuclear flask trains, the company's speciality. DRS supplies class 20s for use with the Rail Head Treatment Train in winter.\nPerhaps the most unusual train hauled by a Class 20 was the \"Kosovo Train for Life\" charter train in autumn 1999 which carried 800 tonnes of aid. Leaving London's Kensington Olympia station on 17 September 1999, the train was hauled by 20 901, 20 902 and 20 903 throughout, reaching Prague by 20 September and arriving at Pristina station at 10:00 on 25 September.\n\nDRS initially had a fleet of 15 operational Class 20/3 locomotives. Three of these have subsequently been disposed of for scrap, after stripping for spares; a further two have been sold on to Harry Needle Railroad Company (HNRC). Following the end of the 2019 Sandite season (Rail Head Treatment Trains), all of the remaining DRS Class 20/3 fleet were stood down, awaiting disposal.\n\nIn 2005 HNRC acquired a large number of 20/0s and 20/9s from the stored DRS fleet. By May 2008 HNRC had eight operational Class 20s and sixteen in storage; two were on hire at Corus Scunthorpe (nos. 81 and 82).\n\nOver a ten-year period, concluding in 2019, a number of class 20s from HNRC were employed to deliver new S-Stock from Bombardier Transportation at Derby Litchurch Lane Works, to London Underground at Neasden depot or West Ruislip depot, for commissioning. Subsequently, immediately after the completion of deliveries, modification of these units (addition of equipment for automatic signalling) was required and they were returned to Derby in the same manner. Formation of the trains usually consisted of a pair of Class 20s, two barrier wagons, the LU S-Stock set, two barrier wagons and a dead-in-tow pair of Class 20s at the rear.\n\nin March 2020, Rail Operations Group began lease of 4 Class 20s from HNRC, for use on stock moves, such as taking Mark 3 Carriages for scrapping, the numbers of these 4 20s being 20118, 132, 311 and 314. as of May 2020, these are the only 4 Class 20s in regular service on the mainline.\n\nD8000 was delivered in June 1957 in overall green livery, with grey footplate, red bufferbeams and a grey roof extending down the bodyside to the edge of the roof panels. The original batch of 10 locos bore the BR crest facing towards the nose on both sides, used yellow sans serif numerals, and had green cab roofs; locos from D8010 had the correct pattern BR crest, white numerals and grey cab roof. This was adjusted after D8103 to include a small yellow warning panel, although the precise size and detail of such panels varied somewhat.\n\nIn 1966, D8048 was selected by the BR design panel for livery experiments and was painted in the prototype standard blue, including the bufferbeams and roof. The exceptions were the full yellow front ends and a black underframe. After the adoption of Rail Blue as the BR livery, D8178 became one of the first locomotives to be delivered in this livery (along with Class 25 D7660 and Class 47 D1953) and all subsequent locomotives were delivered in this livery. Despite this, some locos continued to be returned to traffic in green livery, although often with the later BR \"double arrow\" logo and data panel; thus 20 141 was the final main line loco to carry BR green livery.\n\nSome locomotives, including 20 227, were repainted in the Railfreight grey livery with red sole bars, yellow ends and large double arrows on the sides.\n\nAt least four of the class were painted in the British Rail Telecommunications livery:\n\nClass 20/3 locomotives operated by DRS have all been painted in DRS Oxford Blue livery, with red bufferbeams and full yellow ends. There have been small variations in the shade of yellow used on these locos, and the penetration of blue from the sides onto the ends.\n\nClass 20 locomotives operated by the Harry Needle Railroad Company (HNRC) are painted into house colours of orange and black, with yellow nose ends (20 121, 20 166, 20 311 and 20 314). Some other locomotives owned by HNRC, of subclasses 20/0 and 20/9, have been painted in a variation of two-tone Railfreight grey livery. These have dark grey roof, mid-grey upper body and light grey lower body, black underframe and buffer beam. The nose ends are painted yellow, with the lower part of the cab end in yellow and the upper part black, this continuing around the cab sides but with the light grey instead of yellow. Others are in BR Blue or Railfreight Red-stripe livery. HNRC Class 20s on long-term hire to Corus were painted in Corus livery; previously silver but currently a bright yellow with red solebar (No.81 - 20 056). Since the Corus business was bought by the Indian Tata Steel group, some of these locomotives have been repainted into Tata Blue livery (No.82 - 20 066). Two HNRC Class 20s have been painted into GBRf Europorte's blue and gold livery (20 901 and 20 905), while two other HNRC Class 20s have been painted in the White livery of Hope Construction Materials (now Breedon Cement), with a black solebar (No.2 - 20 168) and a white solebar (No.3 - 20 906).\n\nFour locomotives carried the orange and white livery of the CFD (\"Compagnie de Chemins de Fer Départementaux\") whilst working in France, these were 20 035, 20 063, 20 139 and 20 228.\n\nTwo locomotives, numbers 20 142 and 20 189, were briefly (for a matter of months during 2013) painted into a Balfour Beatty blue and white livery but were then returned to a variation of BR blue.\n\nThe last built class 20, number 20 227, has been used extensively on the London Underground network. In the mid-2000s it was painted in Metropolitan maroon livery and named \"Sir John Betjeman\" by the Class 20 Locomotive Society as acknowledgement of this work. It was repainted in a special 'modern taste' LUL-based livery, to mark the London Underground 150 celebrations but has now been repainted, again into Metropolitan maroon, but this time lined, and renamed \"Sherlock Holmes\". The \"Sir John Betjeman\" name is now carried by 20 142, which also sports Metropolitan line maroon livery.\n\nMainline registered class 20s are:\n\nIn the 1995 James Bond film \"GoldenEye\", 20 188 was used as the locomotive of an escape train on the Nene Valley Railway, with the addition of armour plating to give the impression of a Russian armoured locomotive.\n\n20 Class 20 locomotives are preserved, including the first of the class built, D8000, which is part of the National Railway Collection at the National Railway Museum in York.\n\nA further three engines were preserved but later used for spares, then eventually scrapped. 20 035 was stripped of parts for use on fellow Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway based classmate D8137, and later scrapped at EMR Kingsbury. 20 177 was located at the Severn Valley Railway and became a source of spare parts for D8188 & D8059; with the remains eventually going to C.F. Booth Ltd., Rotherham. 20206 was operated on the Mid-Norfolk Railway, but later sold by its owner, stripped of parts and scrapped.\n\nIn 2008 Hornby Railways launched its first version of the BR Class 20 in OO gauge. Since 2016 Hornby have produced a basic representation of the prototype as part of their Railroad range in BR Blue.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2279440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279440", "title": "Yuya", "text": "Yuya\n\nYuya (sometimes Iouiya, also known as Yaa, Ya, Yiya, Yayi, Yu, Yuyu, Yaya, Yiay, Yia, and Yuy) was a powerful Egyptian courtier during the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt (circa 1390 BC). He was married to Tjuyu, an Egyptian noblewoman associated with the royal family, who held high offices in the governmental and religious hierarchies. Their daughter, Tiye, became the Great Royal Wife of Amenhotep III.\n\nThey also may have been the parents of Ay, an Egyptian courtier active during the reign of pharaoh Akhenaten, who eventually became pharaoh, as \"Kheperkheprure Ay\". There is no conclusive evidence, however, regarding the kinship of Yuya and Ay, although certainly, both men came from the town of Akhmim. Yuya and Tjuyu also are known to have had a son named Anen, who carried the titles.\"Chancellor of Lower Egypt\", \"Second Prophet of Amun\",\"sm-priest of Heliopolis, and \"Divine Father\".\n\nThe tomb of Yuya and Tjuyu was, until the discovery of Tutankhamun's, one of the most spectacular ever found in the Valley of the Kings despite Yuya not even being a pharaoh. Although the burial site was robbed in antiquity, many objects not considered worth plundering by the robbers remained. Both the mummies were largely intact and were in an amazing state of preservation. Their faces in particular were relatively undistorted by the process of mummification, and provide an extraordinary insight into the actual appearance of the deceased while alive (see photographs).\n\nYuya came from the Upper Egyptian town of Akhmim, where he probably owned an estate and was a wealthy member of the town's local nobility. His origins remain unclear. The study of his mummy showed that Yuya had been a man of taller than average stature and the anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith considered that his appearance was not typically Egyptian.\n\nTaking into account his unusual name and features, some Egyptologists believe that Yuya was of foreign origin, although this is far from certain. The name Yuya may be spelled in a number of different ways as Gaston Maspero noted in Theodore Davis's 1907 book—\"The Tomb of Iouiya and Touiyou\". These include \"iAy\", ywiA\", yw [reed-leaf with walking feet]A, ywiw\" and, in orthography—normally a sign of something foreign—\"y[man with hand to mouth]iA\".\n\nThe \"Biographical Dictionary of Ancient Egypt\" suggests that foreign origin. \"it is conceivable that he had some Mitannian ancestry, since it is known that knowledge of horses and chariotry was introduced into Egypt from the northern lands and Yuya was the king's 'Master of the Horse'.\" It also discusses the possibility that Yuya was the brother of queen Mutemwiya, who was the mother of Pharaoh Amenhotep III and may have had Mitannian royal origins. However, this hypothesis can not be substantiated, since nothing is known of Mutemwiya's background. While Yuya lived in Upper Egypt, an area that was predominantly native Egyptian, he could have been an assimilated descendant of Asiatic immigrants or slaves who rose to become a member of the local nobility at Akhmin. If he was not a foreigner, however, then Yuya would have been the native Egyptian whose daughter was married to Amenhotep III. Yuya is believed to have died around 1374 BC in his mid 50s.\n\nYuya served as a key adviser for Amenhotep III, and held posts such as \"King’s Lieutenant\" and \"Master of the Horse\"; his title \"Father-of-the-god\" possibly referred specifically to his being Amenhotep's father-in-law. In his native town of Akhmin, Yuya was a prophet of Min, the chief god of the area, and served as this deity's \"Superintendent of Cattle\".\n\nYuya and his wife were buried in the Valley of the Kings at Thebes, where their private KV46 tomb was discovered in 1905 by James Quibell, who was working on behalf of Theodore M. Davis. Although the tomb had been penetrated by tomb-robbers, perhaps they were disturbed as Quibell found most of the funerary goods and the two mummies virtually intact. As the Egyptologist Cyril Aldred noted: \nThough the tomb had been rifled in antiquity, the [tomb's] opulent funerary furniture was largely intact, and there was no doubt as to the identity of the pair, who were found resting among their torn linen wrappings, within their nests of coffins.\n\nThe goods buried with Yuya and Tjuyu constituted probably the finest ensemble of high-class New Kingdom furniture, etc., recovered before the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun seventeen years later.\n\nJournalist Ahmed Osman in his book \"Stranger in the Valley of the Kings\" has suggested an identification between Joseph, the ancient Hebrew patriarch who led the tribe of Israel into Egypt during a famine, and Yuya. This theory has not been accepted in mainstream Egyptology. Donald B. Redford wrote a scathing review of \"Stranger in the Valley of the Kings\" for \"Biblical Archaeology Review\". Similarly, Deborah Sweeney has expressed great doubt toward the proposed identification. Sweeney states that the title \"God's father of the Lord of the Two Lands\" is an extension of the title \"God's Father,\" which is not exclusive to Yuya. The Bible claims that Joseph's mummified body was exhumed and transported to Canaan by the Israelites, while Yuya's remained undisturbed in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, where his mummy was discovered in 1906.\n\n"}

The parish has a population of 2,148. The parish includes the hamlet of Burton Pynsent.\n\nThe site of a Roman house has been discovered south of Fairview House. The site is on the Heritage at Risk Register due to ploughing.\n\nThe unusual name Curry Rivel, comes from the Celtic word , meaning boundary and \"Rivel\" from its 12th century landlord Sir Richard Revel.\n\nIn 1237 the king granted Henry de l'Orti a licence to empark his woods in Curry Rivel separating it from the control of the foresters of Castle Neroche.\n\nCurry Rivel was part of the hundred of Abdick and Bulstone.\n\nEarnshill House was built in 1725 by John Strachan for Henry Combe, a prominent Bristol merchant.\n\nBurton Pynsent House was built around 1756 for William Pitt, after he inherited the estate from Sir William Pynsent, 2nd Baronet. It formed part of a wing on a larger earlier house, that was demolished around 1805. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. The grounds were laid out in the mid 18th century by Lancelot Brown and William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, and include early 20th century formal gardens designed by Harold Peto. The Chatham Vase is a stone sculpture commissioned as a memorial to William Pitt the Elder by his wife, Hester, Countess of Chatham. It was originally erected at their house in Burton Pynsent, in 1781, and moved to the grounds of Chevening House in 1934, where it currently resides.\n\nThe Pynsent Column (also known as the Curry Rivel Column, Burton Pynsent Monument, Pynsent Steeple or Cider Monument) stands on Troy Hill, a spur of high ground about 700 m north-east of the house. It was designed in the 18th century by Capability Brown for William Pitt. It was restored in the 1990s by the John Paul Getty Trust and English Heritage.\n\nMidelney Place is a Victorian architecture country house, completed in 1866. GradeII listed and privately owned, it is set in of landscaped grounds.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\n\nThe village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Langport Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. The population of this electoral ward at the 2011 Census was 2,527.\n\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\n\nThere is an electoral ward of the same name. The ward extends beyond \"Curry Rivel\" to include Midelney. The total ward population taken at the 2011 census was 2,527.\n\nIt is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nThe Anglican parish Church of St Andrew dates from the 13th century and is designated as a Grade I listed building.\n\n"}

Currency of some type has been used in China since the Neolithic age which can be traced back to between 3000 and 4500 years ago. Cowry shells are believed to have been the earliest form of currency used in Central China, and were used during the Neolithic period.\n\nAround 210 BC, the first emperor of China Qin Shi Huang (260–210 BC) abolished all other forms of local currency and introduced a uniform copper coin. Paper money was invented in China in the 9th century, but the base unit of currency remained the copper coin. Copper coins were used as the chief denomination of currency in China until the introduction of the yuan in the late 19th century.\n\nCurrently, the \"renminbi\" is the official currency of the People's Republic of China (PRC). It is the legal tender in mainland China, but not in Hong Kong or Macau. The special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau use the Hong Kong dollar and the Macanese pataca, respectively.\n\nThe use of shell money is attested to in the Chinese writing system. The traditional characters for 'goods' (), 'buy/sell' (), and 'monger' (), in addition to various other words relating to 'exchange', all contain the radical , which is the pictograph for shell (simplified in the People's Republic to ). The extent of the circulation of shell money is unknown, and barter trade may have been common. However, copies of cowry shells made out of bone, wood, stone, lead and copper were common enough to presume that they were used in trade.\nThe Chinese may have invented the first metal coins, coins found in Anyang date to before 900 BC. At that time, the coin itself was a mock of more earlier used cowry shells, so it was called the Bronze shell.\n\nBronzed shells were found in the ruins of Yin, the old capital of the Shang dynasty (1500–1046 BC). Bronze became the universal currency during the succeeding Zhou dynasty. During the Warring States period, from the 5th century BC to 221 BC, Chinese money was in the form of bronze objects that were of three main types. The Zhou, the Wei (), the Han () and the Qin () all used coins shaped like a spade (\"bu\"). The Qi () used money in the shape of a knife (\"dao\"). The Zhao () and the Yan () used knife money before switching over to spade money roughly halfway through the Warring States period. The Chu () used money in the forms of \"ant nose\" coins (\"yibi\").\n\nAs part of the Unification of China, Qin Shi Huang (, 260 BC – 210 BC) introduced a uniform copper coin with the inscription \"Ban Liang\" based on the coins previously used by Qin. All other forms of local currency were abolished. The coins were round with a square hole in the middle which was the common design for most Chinese copper coins until the 20th century. Due to the low value of an individual coin, the Chinese have traditionally strung a nominal thousand copper coins onto a piece of string. Government taxes were levied on both coins and products such as rolls of silk. Salaries were paid in \"stones\" (, \"dàn\") of grain during the Qin and Han dynasties.\n\nTang merchants rapidly adopted forms of paper currency starting with promissory notes in Sichuan called \"flying money\" (\"feiqian\"). These proved so useful the state took over production of this form of paper money with the first state-backed printing in 1024. By the 12th century, various forms of paper money had become the dominant forms of currency in China and were known by a variety of names such as \"jiaozi\", \"huizi\", \"kuaizi\", or \"guanzi\".\n\nDuring the early Song dynasty (Chinese: , 960–1279), China again reunited the currency system displacing coinages from ten or so independent states. Among pre-Song coins, the northern states tended to prefer copper coins. The southern states tended to use lead or iron coins with Sichuan with its own heavy iron coins which continued to circulate for a short period into the Song dynasty. By 1000, unification (south of the Liao) was complete and China experienced a period of rapid economic growth. This was reflected in the growth of coining. In 1073—the peak year for minting coins in the Northern Song—the government produced an estimated six million strings containing a thousand copper coins each. The Northern Song is thought to have minted over two hundred million strings of coins which were often exported to Inner Asia, Japan, and South-East Asia, where they often formed the dominant form of coinage. \n\nThe Mongol-founded Yuan dynasty (Chinese: , 1271–1368) also attempted to use paper currency. Unlike the Tang dynasty, they created a unified, national system that was not backed by silver or gold. The currency issued by the Yuan was the world's first fiat currency, known as Jiaochao. The Yuan government attempted to prohibit all transactions in or possession of silver or gold, which had to be turned over to the government. Inflation in 1260 caused the government to replace the existing paper currency with a new one in 1287, but inflation that resulted from undisciplined printing remained a problem for the Yuan court until the end of the Yuan dynasty.\n\nThe early Ming dynasty (, 1368–1644) also attempted to use paper currency in the early re-unification period. This currency also experienced rapid inflation and issues were suspended in 1450 although notes remained in circulation until 1573. It was only in the very last years of the Ming dynasty when Li Zicheng threatened Beijing in 1643 and 1645 that printing took place again. For most of the Ming China had a purely private system of currency for all important transactions. Silver, which flowed in from overseas, began to be used as a currency in the Far South province of Guangdong where it spread to the lower Yangzi region by 1423 when it became legal tender for payment of taxes. Provincial taxes had to be remitted to the capital in silver after 1465, salt producers had to pay in silver from 1475 and corvée exemptions had to be paid in silver from 1485. The Chinese demand for silver was met by Spanish imports from the Americas, in particular Potosí in Peru and Mexico, after the Spanish became established at Manila in 1571. It circulated as minted Spanish dollars sometimes stamped with Chinese characters known as \"chop marks\" which indicated that they were verified by a merchant and determined to be genuine. Spanish silver also circulated as ingots (known as sycee or \"yuanbao\") which weighed a nominal \"liang\" (about 36 grammes) although purity and weight varied from region to region. The \"liang\" was often referred to by Europeans by the Malay term \"tael\". The first Chinese yuan coins had the same specification as a Spanish dollar, leading to a continuing equivalence in some respects between the names \"yuan\" and \"dollar\" in the Chinese language.\n\nLate Imperial China maintained both a silver and a copper currency system. The copper system was based on the copper cash (wen). The silver system had several units which by the Qing Dynasty were: 1 tael = 10 mace = 100 candareens = 1000 lí (silver cash).\n\nIn 1889, the Chinese yuan was introduced at par with the Mexican peso and was subdivided into 10 jiao (, not given an English name, cf. \"dime\"), 100 fen (, \"cents\"), and 1000 wen (, \"cash\"). The yuan was equivalent to 7 mace and 2 candareens (or 0.72 tael) and, for a time, coins were marked as such in English.\n\nThe earliest issues were silver coins produced at the Kwangtung mint in denominations of 5 fen, 1, 2 and 5 jiao and 1 yuan. Other regional mints were opened in the 1890s producing similar coins. Copper coins in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 wen were also issued. The central government began issuing its own coins in the yuan currency system in 1903. Banknotes were issued in yuan denominations from the 2019 by several local and private banks, along with the \"Imperial Bank of China\" and the \"Hu Pu Bank\" (later the \"Ta-Ch'ing Government Bank\"), established by the Imperial government.\n\nThe Republic of China was founded after the Xinhai Revolution toppled the Qing dynasty. The Nanjing Provisional Government of the Republic of China urgently needed to issue military currency for use in place of the previous Qing currency. Successively, each province declared independence from the Qing and issued their own military currency. In 1914, the National Currency Ordinance established the silver dollar as the national currency of the Republic of China. Although designs changed compared with Imperial era coins, the sizes and metals used in the coinage remained mostly unchanged until the 1930s. The majority of regional mints closed during the 1920s and 1930s, although some continued until 1949. From 1936, the central government issued copper , 1 and 2 fen coins, nickel (later cupro-nickel) 5, 10 and 20 fen and yuan coins. Aluminium 1 and 5 fen pieces were issued in 1940.\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s saw the price of silver appreciate in the international market, increasing the purchasing power of the Chinese currency and leading to a massive efflux of silver out of China. It became evident to the Chinese government that it could not retain the Silver Standard without debt defaults increasing, and so chose to abandon it. The situation was exacerbated by the multitude of commercial, provincial and foreign banks issuing currencies all at different values.\n\nIn 1935, the Central Government enacted currency reforms to limit currency issuance to four major government controlled banks: the Bank of China, Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications and later the Farmers Bank of China. The circulation of silver dollar coins was prohibited, and private ownership of silver was banned. A new currency issued in its place was known as fabi (), literally \"legal tender\".\n\nCustoms gold units (, pinyin: \"guānjīnyuán\") were issued by the Central Bank of China to facilitate payment of duties on imported goods. Unlike the national currency which suffered from hyperinflation, the CGUs were pegged to the U.S. dollar at 1 CGU = US$0.40.\n\nUnfortunately, the peg was removed in 1935 and the bank allowed CGUs to be released for general use. Already awash with excessive paper currency, the CGUs only added to rampant hyperinflation.\n\nAfter the defeat of Japan in 1945, the Central Bank of China issued a separate currency in the northeast to replace those issued by puppet banks. Termed \"\" (pinyin: \"Dōngběi jiǔ shěng liútōngquàn\"), it was worth approximately 10 times more than fabi circulating elsewhere. It was replaced in 1948 by the gold yuan. The Northeastern Provinces yuan was an attempt to isolate certain regions of China from the hyperinflation that plagued the fabi currency.\n\nThe onset of World War II saw a sharp devaluation of the fabi currency. This was largely due to unrestrained issuance of the currency to fund the war effort. After the defeat of Japan and the return of the Kuomintang Central Government, a further reform was instituted in August 1948 in response to hyperinflation. The Gold Yuan Certificate replaced the fabi at the rate of 1 gold yuan = 3 million yuan fabi = US$0.25. The gold yuan was nominally set at 0.22217 g of gold. However, the currency was never actually backed by gold and hyperinflation continued.\n\nFinally, in 1949, the Kuomintang again announced a reform with the introduction of the Silver Yuan Certificate, returning China to the silver standard. The silver yuan would be exchanged at 1 silver yuan = 100 million gold yuan, and was backed by silver dollars minted by the Central Mint of China.\n\nThis currency was short-lived, as the Communist Party of China soon gained control of the Mainland provinces. It was replaced by currency issued by the People's Bank of China which was less prone to inflation.\n\nAfter the retreat of the Kuomintang to Taiwan, the silver yuan remained the de jure legal currency of account of the Republic of China, although only Taiwan dollars issued by the Bank of Taiwan were circulating in areas controlled by the ROC. After a currency reform in 1949 created the New Taiwan dollar, the statutory exchange rate was set at 1 silver yuan = NT$3.\n\nAn amendment was passed in 2000 to make the New Taiwan dollar the official legal currency of the Republic of China.\n\nThe Bank of Taiwan was originally established by the Japanese in 1899 whilst Taiwan was under Japanese administration. The bank issued Taiwanese yen which were pegged to the Japanese yen. After the retrocession of Taiwan to the Republic of China, the new Bank of Taiwan was allowed to continue issuing its own currency. Called the \"Taiwan dollar\", it replaced the Taiwanese yen at par. This was an attempt by the Kuomintang to prevent the hyperinflation affecting the mainland from affecting Taiwan.\n\nHowever, mismanagement by the Governor-General Chen Yi meant that the Taiwan dollar also suffered depreciation. It was replaced by the New Taiwan dollar in 1949 at the rate of 40,000 to 1.\n\nThe Japanese Imperial Government issued currency through several means during their occupation of China.\n\nAt the time of invasion of China's northeast in 1931, multiple currencies were circulating. These included local provincial issues, the Kuomintang fabi and yen currencies issued by the Bank of Chosen and the Bank of Taiwan.\n\nAfter the puppet state of Manchukuo was created, the Japanese founded the Central Bank of Manchou on July 1, 1932 in Changchun (), then known as Hsinking (). While the bank provided commercial functions, it also acted as a central bank and issuer of currency. The Manchukuo yuan was initially set at 1 Manchukuo yuan = 23.91 g silver, but became pegged to the Japanese yen at 1:1 in 1935 after Japan left the gold standard. The currency lasted until the end of World War II. It was replaced by the Northeastern Provinces Yuan issued by the Central Bank of China.\n\nBefore Japanese occupation, the predominant bank of China's northern provinces (including Suiyuan, Chahar and Shanxi) was the Charhar Commercial Bank. When the Japanese invaded, the bank evacuated the area taking all of its capital and all unissued currency. The Japanese military government quickly established the Channan Commercial Bank to replace its note issuing functions.\n\nWith the formation of Mengjiang puppet state, the authorities established the Bank of Mengjiang which amalgamated the Channan Commercial Bank with three other smaller regional banks. The Bank of Mengjiang issued Mengjiang yuan from 1937 which was pegged to the Japanese military yen and Japanese yen at par.\n\nThe Japanese managed to establish two collaborationist regimes during their occupation in China. In the north, the \"Provisional Government of China\" () based in Beijing established the Federal Reserve Bank of China (, pinyin: \"Zhōngguó Liánhé Zhǔnbèi Yínháng\"). The FRB issued notes in 1938 at par with Kuomintang fabi. Although initially equivalent, the Japanese banned the use of Nationalist currency in 1939 and set arbitrary exchange rates in favour of the FRB yuan. The FRB yuan was replaced by Kuomintang fabi in 1945 at 5 FRB yuan = 1 fabi.\n\nThe Wang Jingwei government in Nanjing established the collaborationist Nanjing Reformed Government () in 1938. This was later reorganized into the Nanjing National Government () in 1940. They established the Central Reserve Bank of China (, pinyin: \"Zhōngyāng Chǔbèi Yínháng\") which began issuing CRB yuan in 1941. Although initially set at par with the Nationalist fabi, it also was arbitrarily changed to equal 0.18 Japanese military yen. In 1945, it was also replaced by the Nationalist fabi at 200 CRB yuan = 1 fabi.\n\nThe Japanese military yen was distributed in many regions throughout East Asia under Japanese occupation. Initially, these were issued as payment to soldiers. The intention was the payout of an indefinite amount of Japanese military yen which could not be converted into Japanese yen and therefore could not cause inflation in Japan. However, the destructive effects on local East Asian economies was not a major concern.\n\nThe currency became legal tender in China commencing in 1937. It was later replaced by issues from puppet banks. However, the currency remained in force in Hong Kong between 1941 and 1945. Initially set at HK$2 = JMY1, the Hong Kong dollar was largely preferred by locals and hoarded away. In order to address this, the Japanese government made possession of Hong Kong dollars illegal in 1943 and required a conversion to JMY at 4 to 1.\n\nThe Communist Party of China gained control of large areas of the northeast of China during 1948 and 1949. Although several regional banks were established, they were united in December 1948 as the People's Bank of China. Established in Shijiazhuang, the new bank took over currency issuance in areas controlled by the Communist Party.\n\nAfter the promulgation of the People's Republic of China, there was a brief period where 100,000 gold yuan could be exchanged for 1 yuan Renminbi.\n\nRenminbi notes were issued in 12 denominations: 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 5000, 10,000, and 50,000 yuan. These denominations were subdivided into 62 styles. After adjusting the currency value with ratio 1:10,000 in March 1955, the second edition of Renminbi were issued in 12 denominations, including 1 fen, 2 fen, 5 fen, 1 jiao, 2 jiao, 5 jiao, 1 yuan, 2 yuan, 3 yuan, 5 yuan and 10 yuan.\n\nThe People's Republic of China began issuing aluminum coins in December 1957, in denominations of 1, 2 and 5 fen. From 1961, China outsourced the printing of 3, 5 and 10 yuan notes to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe fifth and latest editions of the currency of the People's Republic of China have been produced since 1 October 1999. Notes have been produced in 8 denominations: old types of 1 fen, 2 fen and 5 fen, as well as new issues depicting Mao Zedong: 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 20 yuan, 50 yuan and 100 yuan. In 2004, a 1 yuan note depicting Mao Zedong first came into production. Since 1999, coins have been produced in denominations of 1 fen, 2 fen, 5 fen, 1 jiao, 5 jiao and 1 yuan.\n\nThe Bank of China on the Mainland was chartered as the main foreign trade and exchange bank. Foreign visitors to the People's Republic of China were required to conduct transactions with Foreign Exchange Certificates issued by the Bank of China between 1979 and 1994. These have been abolished, and all transactions now occur in Renminbi.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2279471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279471", "title": "Amanda Award", "text": "Amanda Award\n\nThe Amanda Award () is an award given annually at the Norwegian International Film Festival in Haugesund, Norway, to promote and improve Norwegian film. The award originated in 1985, and has since 2005 been exclusively a film award (not television). Winners are awarded a trophy by the Norwegian sculptor Kristian Kvakland, and the name—and theme—of the sculpture comes from a legendary local woman from the 1920s. The award ceremony is marked every year by a major, nationally televised, event.\n\nThe Amanda Award was instituted in 1985 as part of the Norwegian International Film Festival \"to increase the quality of and further the interest for Norwegian films\". The year 1993 marked an exception to the norm, when the so-called \"Nordic Amanda\" included contribution from all the Nordic countries. From 2005 onwards, TV-drama was no longer included among the categories honoured, as the TV-specific award \"Gullruten\" had taken over this function. Instead the award became exclusively for films. Around the same time another change occurred also. Since the beginning, the award ceremony had been produced in cooperation with the Norwegian state broadcasting corporation Norsk rikskringkasting (NRK). In 2006, however, NRK ended the partnership, and the show has since that time been the responsibility of the private broadcasting company TV 2.\n\nIn the year 2007, a \"People's Amanda\" (\"\"Folkets Amanda\"\") was awarded for the first time, where the winner was arrived at by popular vote. The first winner of the award was the horror movie \"Fritt Vilt\", directed by Roar Uthaug.\n\nThe name \"Amanda\" is derived from a song, or sea shanty, titled \"\"Amanda fra\" [from] \"Haugesund\"\". Supposedly the song in turn refers to a real woman from the 1920s – a single mother who made a living from selling liquor to sailors during the prohibition period.\n\nThe figurine that is awarded to prize winners originated from a competition held by the local newspaper Haugesunds Avis in 1985, to create a sculpture of the legendary Amanda. The competition was won by Kristian Kvakland from Nesodden in Akershus. The full-size sculpture now stands outside the newspaper's office, but a miniature version was adopted as a trophy for the Amanda Award. The figurine is 30 cm (11.81 in) tall, with a skirt measuring 14 cm (5.51 in) in diameter. While the current sculpture is hollow and weighs 2.5 kg (5.51 lbs), for the first few years it was made of solid metal. Weighing in at 4.5 kg (9.92 lbs) it was difficult to hoist for many winners.\n\nIt was one of these prizes that, in the year 1986, was won by director Anja Breien, who decided to sell it through a newspaper advert, as a protest against that year's budget cuts for Norwegian film. The Swedish Film Institute, which had experienced similar cuts and sympathized, bought the sculpture. In 2005, as Breien was presented with an honorary award, she was also given back the original sculpture by former Minister of Culture and director of the Swedish Film Institute, Åse Kleveland.\n\nThe award show has long been a central point of the film festival, as well as a major television event for the whole of Norway. Particularly in earlier years, international stars were sometimes brought in to enhance the prestige of the event. Examples of this are Roger Moore, who was a special guest at the very first ceremony in 1985, and Diana Ross in 1987, then married to Norwegian entrepreneur Arne Næss, Jr. Other international names appearing in the show as presenters have included Ned Beatty, Lauren Bacall, Jon Voight, Brian Cox, Jeremy Irons, Ben Kingsley and Pierce Brosnan.\n\nThe show has in recent years been hosted by prominent Norwegian comedians. Jon Almaas, known from the TV-show \"Nytt på nytt\", played host for several years in the early 2000s. Thomas Giertsen, known as a stand-up comedian and from several TV-shows, has hosted the show in recent years. An episode that received some media attention in 2005 was when host Marit Åslein and Minister of Culture and Church Affairs from the Christian conservative party KrF, Valgerd Svarstad Haugland, kissed on stage as part of a humorous routine.\n\nThe only actor ever to have won four Amanda Awards is Bjørn Sundquist. These were awarded for the movies \"Over grensen\" (1987), \"Søndagsengler\" (1996) and \"Sejer - se deg ikke tilbake\" (2000), as well as an Honorary Award in 2000. Also Ane Dahl Torp has won three awards for specific acting roles; she won Best Actress for her roles in \"Svarte penger - hvite løgner\" (2004) and \"Gymnaslærer Pedersen\" (2006), and was the first ever to receive the newly created award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her effort in \"Lønsj\" in 2008. Sverre Anker Ousdal has also been named Best Actor twice, for \"Kreditorene\" in 1990 and \"Blodsbånd\" in 1998, and won the Honorary Award in 2009. Nils Ole Oftebro, Espen Skjønberg and Anneke von der Lippe have all been honoured twice each – Oftebro and Skjønberg once as lead actors and once as supporting actors. Among the directors, Ola Solum, Nils Gaup, Berit Nesheim and Bent Hamer have each received two awards. Erik Gustavson has the rare distinction of having won in three different categories: for best film and best documentary, in addition to winning the special \"Nordic Amanda\" in 1993. This is an accomplishment also Kjersti Holmen can claim, for winning the Best Actress award in 2000, Best Supporting Role in 1993, and the Honorary Award in 2009. The only film to have won the three main awards – best film, best actor and best actress – is \"Budbringeren\" in 1997.\n\nAs of 2010, the categories awarded are:\n\n"}
{"id": "2279472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279472", "title": "Yuan (currency)", "text": "Yuan (currency)\n\nThe yuan (; sign: ¥; ; ) is the base unit of a number of former and present-day currencies in Chinese.\n\nA \"yuan\" () is also known colloquially as a \"kuai\" (; originally a lump of silver). One \"yuan\" is divided into 10 \"jiao\" () or colloquially \"mao\" ( \"feather\"). One \"jiao\" is divided into 10 \"fen\" ().\n\nToday, the term \"Yuan\" usually refers to the primary unit of account of the renminbi (RMB), the currency of the People's Republic of China. RMB banknotes start at one Yuan and go up to 100 Yuan. It is also used as a synonym of that currency, especially in international contexts – the ISO 4217 standard code for renminbi is CNY, an abbreviation of \"Chinese yuan\". (A similar case is the use of the terms \"sterling\" to designate British currency and \"pound\" for the unit of account.) \n\nThe symbol for the yuan (元) is also used in Chinese to refer to the currency units of Japan \"(yen)\" and Korea \"(won)\", and is used to translate the currency unit \"dollar\" as well as some other currencies; for example, the United States dollar is called \"Meiyuan\" () in Chinese, and the euro is called \"Ouyuan\" (). When used in English in the context of the modern foreign exchange market, the Chinese yuan (CNY) refers to the renminbi (RMB), which is the official currency used in mainland China.\n\nIn Standard (Mandarin) Chinese, \"yuán\" literally means a \"round object\" or \"round coin\". During the Qing Dynasty, the yuan was a round coin made of silver.\n\nIn informal contexts, the word is written with the simplified Chinese character , that literally means \"beginning\". In formal contexts it is written with the simplified character or with the traditional version , both meaning \"round\", after the shape of the coins. These are all pronounced \"yuán\" in modern Standard Chinese, but were originally pronounced differently, and remain distinct in Wu Chinese: = ', = '.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, '￥' or 'RMB' is often prefixed to the amount to indicate that the currency is the renminbi (e.g. ￥100元 or RMB 100元).\n\nIn many parts of China, the unit of renminbi is sometimes colloquially called \"kuài\" (, literally \"piece\") rather than \"yuán\". The pinyin term \"kuài\" has also been written as \"quay\" in English language publications \n\nIn Cantonese, widely spoken in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong and Macau, the \"yuan\", \"jiao\", and \"fen\" are called \"mān\" (), \"hòuh\" (), and \"sīn\" (), respectively. \"Sīn\" is a loan word from the English \"cent\".\n\nThe traditional character is also used to denote the base unit of Hong Kong dollar, the Macanese pataca, and the New Taiwan dollar. However, they do not share the same names for the subdivisions. The unit of a New Taiwan dollar is also referred to in Standard Chinese as \"yuán\" and written as 元, 圆 or 圓.\n\nThe names of the Korean and Japanese currency units, won and yen respectively, are cognates of Mandarin \"yuán\", also meaning \"round\" in the Korean and Japanese languages.\n\nThe Japanese yen (\"en\") was originally also written with the kanji (Chinese) character , which was simplified to with the promulgation of the \"Tōyō kanji\" in 1946.\n\nThe Korean won (\"won\") used to be written with the hanja (Chinese) character from 1902 to 1910, and some time after World War II. It is now written as in Hangul exclusively, in both North and South Korea.\n\nIn 1889, the yuan was derived from the Spanish dollar which circulated widely in southeast Asia since the 17th century due to Spanish presence in the region, namely the Philippines and Guam. It was subdivided into 1000 cash (), 100 cents or fen (), and 10 \"jiao\" (, \"cf.\" dime). It replaced copper cash and various silver ingots called sycees. The sycees were denominated in tael. The yuan was valued at 0.72 tael, (or 7 mace and 2 candareens).\n\nBanknotes were issued in yuan denominations from the 1890s by several local and private banks, along with the Imperial Bank of China and the \"Hu Pu Bank\" (later the \"Ta-Ch'ing Government Bank\"), established by the Imperial government. During the Imperial period, banknotes were issued in denominations of 1, 2 and 5 \"jiao\", 1, 2, 5, 10, 50 and 100 yuan, although notes below 1 yuan were uncommon.\n\nThe earliest issues were silver coins produced at the Guangdong mint, known in the West at the time as Canton, and transliterated as Kwangtung, in denominations of 5 cents, 1, 2 and 5 \"jiao\" and 1 yuan. Other regional mints were opened in the 1890s producing similar silver coins along with copper coins in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 cash. Other regional mints were opened in the 1890s. The central government began issuing its own coins in the yuan currency system in 1903. Banknotes were issued in yuan denominations from the 1890s by several local and private banks, along with banks established by the Imperial government.\n\nThe central government began issuing its own coins in the yuan currency system in 1903. These were brass 1 cash, copper 2, 5, 10 and 20 cash, and silver 1, 2 and 5 \"jiao\" and 1 yuan. After the revolution, although the designs changed, the sizes and metals used in the coinage remained mostly unchanged until the 1930s. From 1936, the central government issued nickel (later cupronickel) 5, 10 and 20 fen and yuan coins. Aluminium 1 and 5 fen pieces were issued in 1940.\n\nThis table sets out the first \"silver yuan\" coins minted by each province.\nIn 1917, the warlord in control of Manchuria, Zhang Zuolin, introduced a new currency, known as the Fengtien yuan or dollar, for use in the Three Eastern Provinces. It was valued at 1.2 yuan in the earlier (and still circulating) \"small money\" banknotes and was initially set equal to the Japanese yen. It maintained its value (at times being worth a little more than the yen) until 1925, when Zhang Zuolin's military involvement in the rest of China lead to an increase in banknote production and a fall in the currency's value. The currency lost most of its value in 1928 as a consequence of the disturbance following Zhang Zuolin's assassination. The Fengtien yuan was only issued in banknote form, with 1, 5 and 10 yuan notes issued in 1917, followed by 50 and 100 yuan notes in 1924. The last notes were issued in 1928.\n\nThe number of banks issuing paper money increased after the revolution. Significant national issuers included the \"Commercial Bank of China\" (the former Imperial Bank), the \"Bank of China\" (the former Ta-Ch'ing Government Bank), the \"Bank of Communications\", the \"Ningpo Commercial Bank\", the \"Central Bank of China\" and the \"Farmers Bank of China\". Of these, only the Central Bank of China issued notes beyond 1943. An exceptionally large number of banknotes were issued during the Republican era (1911–1949) by provincial banks (both Nationalist and Communist).\n\nAfter the revolution, a great many local, national and foreign banks issued currency. Although the provincial coinages mostly ended in the 1920s, the provincial banks continued issuing notes until 1949, including Communist issues from 1930. Most of the banknotes issued for use throughout the country bore the words \"National Currency\", as did some of the provincial banks. The remaining provincial banknotes bore the words \"Local Currency\". These circulated at varying exchange rates to the national currency issues. After the revolution, in addition to the denominations already in circulation, \"small money\" notes proliferated, with 1, 2 and 5 cent denominations appearing. Many notes were issued denominated in English in cash (\"wén\").\n\nDuring the 1930s, several new currencies came into being in China due to the activities of the invading Japanese. The pre-existing, national currency yuan came to be associated only with the Nationalist, Kuomintang government. In 1935, the Kuomintang Government enacted currency reforms to limit currency issuance to four major government controlled banks: the Bank of China, Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications and later the Farmers Bank of China. The circulation of silver yuan coins was prohibited and private ownership of silver was banned. The banknotes issued in its place were known as fabi () or \"Legal tender\". A new series of base metal coins began production in 1936 following the reforms.\n\nThe Japanese established two collaborationist regimes during their occupation in China. In the north, the \"Provisional Government of the Republic of China\" () based in Peking (Beijing) established the \"Federal Reserve Bank of China\" (). The Japanese occupiers issued coins and banknotes denominated in \"li\" () (and were worth of a yuan), fen, jiao and yuan. Issuers included a variety of banks, including the \"Central Reserve Bank of China\" (for the puppet government in Nanking) and the \"Federal Reserve Bank of China\" (for the puppet government in Peking (Beijing)). The Japanese decreed the exchange rates between the various banks' issues and those of the Nationalists but the banknotes circulated with varying degrees of acceptance among the Chinese population. Between 1932 and 1945, the puppet state of Manchukuo issued its own yuan.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War and during the civil war which followed, Nationalist China suffered from hyperinflation, leading to the introduction of a new currency in 1948, the gold yuan. In the 1940s, larger denominations of notes appeared due to the high inflation. 500 yuan notes were introduced in 1941, followed by 1000 and 2000 yuan in 1942, 2500 and 5000 yuan in 1945 and 10,000 yuan in 1947.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1948, banknotes were also issued by the Central Bank of China denominated in \"customs gold units\". These, known as \"gold yuan notes\", circulated as normal currency in the 1940s alongside the yuan.\n\nBanknotes of the yuan suffered from hyperinflation following the Second World War and were replaced in August 1948 by notes denominated in gold yuan, worth 3 million old yuan. There was no link between the gold yuan and gold metal or coins and this yuan also suffered from hyperinflation.\n\nIn 1948, the Central Bank of China issued notes (some dated 1945 and 1946) in denominations of 1, 2 and 5 jiao, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 yuan. In 1949, higher denominations of 500, 1000, 5000, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000, 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 yuan were issued. The Central Bank of China issued notes in denominations of 1 and 5 fen, 1, 2 and 5 jiao, 1, 5 and 10 yuan.\n\nIn July 1949, the Nationalist Government introduced the silver yuan, which was initially worth 500 million gold yuan. It circulated for a few months on the mainland before the end of the civil war. This silver yuan remained the \"de jure\" official currency of the Republic government in Taiwan until 2000.\n\nThe various Soviets under the control of the Communist Party of China issued coins between 1931 and 1935, and banknotes between 1930 and 1949. Some of the banknotes were denominated in \"chuàn\", strings of wén coins. The People's Bank was founded in 1948 and began issuing currency that year, but some of the regional banks continued to issue their own notes in to 1949.\n\nAfter the defeat of Japan in 1945, the Central Bank of China issued a separate currency in the northeast to replace those issued by the puppet banks—north-eastern yuan (). It was worth 20 of the yuan which circulated in the rest of the country. It was replaced in 1948 by the gold yuan at a rate of 150,000 north-eastern yuan to 1 gold yuan. In 1945, notes were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 yuan. 500 yuan notes were added in 1946, followed by 1000 and 2000 yuan in 1947 and 5000 and 10,000 yuan in 1948.\n\nVarious, mostly crude, coins were produced by the Soviets. Some only issued silver 1 yuan coins (Hunan, Hubei-Hunan-Anhui (Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei or E-Yu-Wan Soviet Area), Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi (Min-Che-Kan or Min-Zhe-Gan Soviet Area), North Shaanxi (North Shensi or Shanbei Base Area) and Pingjiang (P'ing Chiang Base Area)) whilst the West Hunan-Hubei (Hsiang-O-Hsi or West Xiang-E) Soviet only issued copper 1 fen coins and the North-West Anhui (Wan-Hsi-Pei or North-West Wan) Soviet issued only copper 50 \"wen\" coins. The Chinese Soviet Republic issued copper 1 and 5 fen and silver 2 jiao and 1 yuan coins. The Sichuan-Shaanxi (Szechuan-Shensi or Chuan-Shan) Soviet issued copper 200 and 500 \"wen\" and silver 1 yuan coins.\n\nNotes were produced by many different banks. There were two phases of note production. The first, up until 1936, involved banks in a total of seven areas, most of which were organized as Soviets. These were:\n\nProduction of banknotes by Communist Party forces ceased in 1936 but resumed in 1938 and continued through to the centralization of money production in 1948. A great many regional banks and other entities issued notes. Before 1942, denominations up to 100 yuan were issued. That year, the first notes up to 1000 yuan appeared. Notes up to 5000 yuan appeared in 1943, with 10,000 yuan notes appearing in 1947, 50,000 yuan in 1948 and 100,000 yuan in 1949.\n\nAs the People's Liberation Army took control of most of China, they introduced a new currency, in banknote form only, denominated in yuan. This became the sole currency of mainland China at the end of the civil war. A new yuan was introduced in 1955 at a rate of 10,000 old yuan = 1 new yuan, known as the renminbi yuan. It is the currency of the People's Republic of China to this day.\n\nThe term \"yuan\" is also used in Taiwan. In 1946, a new currency was introduced for circulation there, replacing the Japanese issued Taiwan yen, the Old Taiwan dollar. It was not directly related to the mainland yuan. In 1949, a second yuan was introduced in Taiwan, replacing the first at a rate of 40,000 to 1. Known as the New Taiwan dollar, it remains the currency of Taiwan today.\n\nOriginally, a silver yuan had the same specifications as a silver Spanish dollar. During the Republican era (1911–1949), the transliteration \"yuan\" was often printed on the reverse of the first yuan banknotes but sometimes \"dollar\" was used instead.\n\nIn the Republic of China, the common English name is the \"New Taiwan dollar\" but banknotes issued between 1949 and 1956 used \"yuan\" as the transliteration. More modern notes lack any transliteration.\n\n\n"}

The map was commissioned in 2002 by Bob Abramms and Howard Bronstein of ODT Inc., and drafted by cartographer Mick Dyer, as a modification of the 1910 Behrmann projection. The name \"Hobo–Dyer\" is derived from Bronstein and Abramms' first names (Howard and Bob) and Dyer's surname.\n\nThe original ODT map is printed on two sides, one side with north upwards and the other, south upwards. This, together with its equal-area presentation, is intended to present a different perspective compared with more common non-equal area, north-up maps. This goal is similar to that of other equal-area projections (such as the Gall–Peters projection), but the Hobo-Dyer is billed by the publisher as \"more visually satisfying\". To this end, the map stretches the low latitudes vertically less than Peters, but at the price of greater compression near the poles.\n\nIn 2002, the Carter Center used the Hobo–Dyer projection in a map of its global locations that it circulated to mark its founder Jimmy Carter's receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n"}

It is performed as a solo piece by John Lennon. The song was written by Lennon (though credited to Lennon–McCartney) about his mother Julia Lennon, who died in 1958 at age 44.\n\nThe track is the final song on side two (disc one on CD) of \"The Beatles\" and was the last song recorded for the album. In 1976, it was issued as the B-side of the Beatles single \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\".\n\n\"Julia\" was written by John Lennon (credited to Lennon–McCartney) in the key of D major and features Lennon on vocals and acoustic guitar. It was written during the Beatles' 1968 visit to Rishikesh in northern India, where they were studying under the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. It was here where Lennon learned the song's finger-picking guitar style (known as 'Travis-picking') from the Scottish musician Donovan. Donovan later explained:\n\nNo other Beatle sings or plays on the song. While Paul McCartney made several \"solo\" recordings attributed to the group, dating back to his famous song \"Yesterday\", this is the only time that Lennon played and sang unaccompanied on a Beatles track. The ballad itself was the final track to be composed during recording sessions for \"The Beatles\". \n\n\"Julia\" was written for John's mother, Julia Lennon (1914–1958), who was killed by a car driven by a drunk off-duty police officer when John was 17 years old. Julia Lennon had encouraged her son's interest in music and bought him his first guitar. But after she split with John's father, John was taken in by his aunt, Mimi, and Julia started a new family with another man; though she lived just a few miles from John, Julia did not spend much time with him for a number of years. Their relationship began to improve as he neared adolescence, though, and in the words of his half-sister, Julia Baird:\n\"I lost her twice,\" Lennon said. \"Once as a five-year-old when I was moved in with my auntie. And once again when she actually physically died.\"\n\nThe song was also written for his future wife Yoko Ono, whose first name, which literally means \"child of the sea\" in Japanese, is echoed in the lyric \"Oceanchild, calls me.\" Towards the end of his life, he often called Yoko \"Mother.\"\n\nThe line \"Half of what I say is meaningless, but I say it just to reach you\" was a slight variation of Kahlil Gibran's \"Sand and Foam\" (1926) in which the original verse reads, \"Half of what I say is meaningless, but I say it so that the other half may reach you\". Lennon also adapted the lines \"When I cannot sing my heart, I can only speak my mind\" from Gibran's \"When life does not find a singer to sing her heart she produces a philosopher to speak her mind\".\n\n\"Julia\" was originally released as the final song on side two of \"The Beatles\" on 22 November 1968. In 1976, it was released as the B-side of the \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" single. In 1988, \"Julia\" was one of the nine Beatles songs on the soundtrack album \"\". In 2006, a portion was used for the \"Love\" album, mixed with \"Eleanor Rigby\".\n\nCoinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, Jacob Stolworthy of \"The Independent\" listed \"Julia\" at number 13 in his ranking of the White Album's 30 tracks. He commented: \"The first disc ends on a sanguine note with Lennon’s ode to his deceased mother, Julia. It remains the only Beatles song he wrote and performed by himself.\"\n\n\n"}

Livraga's father died when he was 15, and this led to a spiritual crisis, where, via his English teacher, he eventually came into contact with the Argentine Theosophical Society in the early fifties. He was a member of the Theosophical Society from 1950 to 1962. \n\nAt some point, he founded the magazine \"Estudios Teosóficos\" with Ada Albrecht, and founded New Acropolis, an association intended to promote Philosophy, along the lines of the classical Schools of Philosophy, such as Plato’s Academy.

{"id": "2279486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279486", "title": "Special collections", "text": "Special collections\n\nIn library science, special collections (Spec. Coll. or S.C.) are libraries or library units that house materials requiring specialized security and user services.\n\nMaterials housed in special collections can be in any format (including rare books, manuscripts, photographs, archives, ephemera, and digital records), and are generally characterized by their artifactual or monetary value, physical format, uniqueness or rarity, and/or an institutional commitment to long-term preservation and access. They can also include association with important figures or institutions in history, culture, politics, sciences, or the arts.\n\nIndividual libraries or archival institutions determine for themselves what constitute their own special collections, resulting in a somewhat mutable definition. For research libraries, a special collections area or division can be a fundamental part of their mission. Some special collections are standalone institutions that are privately funded, such as the Newberry Library or the American Antiquarian Society while others are part of a larger institution, such as the Beinecke Library at Yale University. Many American university special collections grew out of the merging of rare book rooms and manuscripts departments in a university's library system.\n\nIn contrast to general (or circulating) libraries, the uniqueness of special collections means that they are not easily replaced (if at all) and therefore require a higher level of security and handling.\n\nThe primary function of a special collections division is to foster research by providing researchers access to items while ensuring their longevity. Many staff members involved with special collections have either advanced degrees or specialized training related to the collections for which they are responsible.\n\nItems in a special collection are usually stored in closed stacks (not directly accessible to library patrons) which contain noncirculating items, meaning that items cannot be loaned or otherwise removed from the premises. Access to materials is usually under supervision. Depending on the policies of an institution holding special collections, researchers may be asked to present identification cards, letters of reference, or other credentials to gain access.\n\nMost special collections are stored in areas in which the temperature, humidity, illumination, and other environmental conditions are carefully monitored to ensure the integrity of materials, and adequate security is provided to protect the materials from unauthorized access, theft, and vandalism.\n\nOffsite storage facilities have become increasingly popular among institutions holding special collections. Most libraries consider it their mandate to maintain acquisition of new collections, although the limitations of their physical plants may not be able to handle all that is acquired. Storing materials offsite allows flexibility in how libraries design and apportion their space and provides security for materials. The 2010 \"Taking Our Pulse\" report cites a survey in which 67% of responding institutions use offsite facilities, with another 5% in planning stages.\n\nSpecial reading rooms are often provided to minimize the risk to holdings while being consulted by patrons, which are sometimes monitored by library personnel who also provide reference assistance and relay requests for materials. Rules often apply to use of materials in order to protect against inadvertent damage; Writing implements which use ink are very commonly prohibited, as well as flash photography, use of mobile phones, and the presence of food and beverages. Protective gloves are sometimes required when consulting particularly delicate materials, photographs, and metal objects, and many libraries may require that books be read only while resting in special cradles.\n\n\n"}

It not only changes colors and flavors when sucked on, but also never gets any smaller or disappears. In 1976 the name of the fictional candy was used for a product similar to a normal gobstopper, or jawbreaker.\n\nAlthough only briefly mentioned in the book and its 2005 film adaptation, the 1971 film adaptation \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" used the Everlasting Gobstopper as a plot device in which Wonka's business rival Slugworth attempts to bribe the children visiting the Wonka factory to steal one for him. This is later revealed as a lie; Slugworth is actually Mr. Wilkinson, one of Wonka's workers. The proposal is a test Wonka set up to judge the worthiness of the ticket holders to take over the factory, given to all five children.\n\nThe actual Everlasting Gobstopper prop used in the Gene Wilder movie was sold for $100,000 to the owners of TV show \"Pawn Stars\".\n\nA product called the Everlasting Gobstopper was introduced in 1976 by the Chicago candy company Breaker Confections. Breaker Confections had licensed the \"Willy Wonka\" name in 1971 so that their candy could be used as merchandising tie-ins for the film \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\", which was released the same year. The Willy Wonka Candy Company brand was later bought by Nestlé and production has been moved to Itasca, Illinois.\n\nThe everlasting gobstopper is like a normal gobstopper or jawbreaker and is composed of several discrete layers. The layers allow for the color and flavor changing effects described in the book. They are available in a variety of different flavor combinations and usually have a chalky center with a cherry flavor. A version with a chewy center is also available.\n\nThe everlasting gobstopper product resembles the gobstopper from the book and its 2005 film adaptation far more than the ones in the 1971 film. The version from the 1971 film is a multi-coloured, bumpy, spiky candy and the ones in the book and the 2005 film are round, single-coloured spheres. Unlike the ones from the book and the films, where Willy Wonka says you would break your teeth if you tried to chew a gobstopper, the Nestlé produced gobstoppers are chewable once sucked long enough, and unlike their fictional counterparts they are not \"everlasting\".\n\nSeasonal variants such as \"Gobstopper Snowballs\" and \"Gobstopper Heart-breakers\" are available during winter holidays and around the time of Valentine's Day, respectively. An example is the Gobstopper Candy Cane, which is the company’s only non-spherical Gobstopper: the product is modeled after the regular candy canes that are popular during the Christmas season.\n\n"}

Her brother, John, was father of Mervyn Griffith-Jones, the prosecuting barrister (later judge) involved in the 1960 prosecution of Penguin Books for the publication of D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover and the 1963 trial of Stephen Ward relating to the Profumo affair.\n\nShe, along with many women of her time, had no formal qualifications. During World War I, she served as a welfare officer at a munitions factory in Wales, for which she was awarded an MBE.\n\nIn 1923, Griffith-Jones — widely known as “Miss Griff” — came to Singapore to spend a three-month holiday with her brother, Oswald Phillips Griffith-Jones. After her vacation, she chose to stay in Singapore to dedicate her life to the education of expatriate children, founding the Tanglin Day School which later became the Tanglin Preparatory School. When the school first opened in March 1925, it functioned from a disused supper shed within the premises of the Tanglin Club. It began with five students but soon began to grow rapidly. The school served the needs of children up to the age of eight. At the time, many British expatriates living in Singapore had to send their children to Britain to attend boarding school at an early age. This meant being separated from their children for a lengthy period of time.\n\nGriffith-Jones saw the need to provide a British-style education in Singapore so that parents could postpone boarding school until their children were of an older age.\n\nIn 1934, she opened a second school, the Tanglin Boarding School, in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia. The school was intended to serve as a \"near-by\" alternative for expatriate families living in the region who would otherwise have to send their children to boarding schools in Britain. Many of the children who attended the school in Singapore then went on to the boarding school in the Cameron Highlands, which catered for students up to the age of 13. At the end of 1938, the number of pupils at the school grew to 68. \nAt both schools, there was much emphasis on the British Empire. In preparing the boys for English Preparatory Schools, she would teach them football, taking the forward line across the playing field and showing them how to pass the ball. Similarly at cricket, she demonstrated the \"straight bat\" and footwork at the crease.\n\nThe two schools continued to grow until the outbreak of the Second World War (1942–1945). The Japanese Occupation of the Malay Peninsula forced the closure of both schools, as British expatriates in the region (including Griffith-Jones) were interned by the Japanese at Singapore's Changi Prison and Sime Road Camp. Throughout her confinement, she displayed the same qualities of organisation and leadership that were a feature of her everyday life. In the course of her imprisonment, she rose to the challenge of internment and set about establishing a school for the internees.\n\nAfter the war, the two schools reopened, but the school at the Cameron Highlands failed to flourish. In 1948, it had to close due to an outbreak of poliomyelitis. \n\nA second closure occurred during the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960). The school had to be placed under full-time armed guard after the Malayan National Liberation Army surrounded the school. In 1950, it was forced to close by the Federal Government for security reasons. Thereafter, the property was sold to the British War Office.\n\nIn 1958, Griffith-Jones retired to the Cameron Highlands and the British European Association, now the British Association of Singapore, took over the private company, 'Tanglin School Limited'.\nWhile residing at the resort, Griffith-Jones became actively involved in sport and social work. For many years, she served as Secretary of the Cameron Highlands Church (which is presently known as All Souls' Church).\n\nIn mid-1958, she offered to donate a site adjoining the former Slim School grounds for the erection of a school chapel. However, after consultation with the District Officer, it was established that the State Government would not alienate any further land to the British Forces based at the retreat. Subsequently, she transferred the land to the Anglican Diocese on the understanding that a small church would be built on it. \n\nThe construction of the church commenced in 1958. The Nissen hut structure was completed in September that same year. The name 'All Souls' Church' was given at the church's consecration on Thursday, 30 April 1959. The Right Rev H W Baines, Bishop of Singapore and Malaya, conducted the services.\n\nGriffith-Jones received three awards during her lifetime. Her MBE, which she received in her twenties, was elevated to an OBE for her services to education. In 1962, the Sultan of Pahang bestowed on her the \"Pingat Jasa Kebaktian\" award for meritorious service.\n\nGriffith-Jones died in 1973 at the Ipoh General Hospital after suffering a severe stroke. She was buried in Tapah, Perak, in the foothills of the Cameron Highlands. In 2015, her grave was visited by a group of students from Singapore's Tanglin Trust School. They read out a prepared text and placed a floral tribute on her grave before leaving.\n\n\n"}

A chalk often corresponds to a platoon-sized unit for air assault operations, or a company-minus-sized organization for airborne operations. For air transport operations, it can consist of up to a company-plus-sized unit. Oftentimes, a load of paratroopers in one aircraft, prepared for a drop, is also referred to as a \"stick\".\n\nThe term was first coined in World War II for airborne troops during Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Europe. The aircraft flight number was placed on the troops' backs with chalk. It was later used during the Vietnam War, when it was common practice to number with chalk the sides of the helicopters involved in an operation. \n\nIn current military terminology a \"chalk\" may mean either passengers or equipment loaded as cargo. Equipment is loaded in the order it will be needed on arrival. It is not uncommon for planners to refer to aircraft loads by their chalk number, \"You are in chalk five but your gear will be shipped in chalk two.\"\n\nIn the Army 75th Ranger Regiment they use the term chalk. A chalk can be made of a Company or as small as a four man fire team. It takes no less than four men to make a fire team so that is the smallest number of men that can be called a chalk.\n"}

It adjoins the River Isle, near its confluence with the Parrett, and the former Westport Canal. The parish includes the hamlet of Midelney.\n\nThe village has a population of 379 and is home to St Catherine's parish church and the \"Drayton Arms\" pub.\n\nIt is trite in Anglo-Saxon language the name of the village means literally \"\"drawing-town\"\", the word dray being largely obsolete save for dray horse being one that drags or draws a load, at a time when the inceptive form of town \"ton\" had not turned into its larger sense today. Locally this may refer to \"ledges or drays\" being used for boats or for the drawn plough as in most other examples.\n\nThe probable site of a Roman house has been identified west of the vicarage.\n\nThe village is one of a few places in the UK that has an Anglo Saxon Wassailling tradition.\n\nDrayton was part of the hundred of Abdick and Bulstone.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\n\nThe village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Langport Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.\n\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\n\nIt is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nMidelney Manor is a Grade I manor house in landscaped grounds. It is sited on a former island site, and was the property of Muchelney Abbey, passing to the Trevillian family after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The present house was built in the late 16th century in two distinct halves by Richard and Thomas Trevillian. Drayton Manor is more recent and was built in the late 18th or early 19th century.\n\nSt Catherine's exterior is Blue Lias and golden hamstone. It dates from the 15th century, being restored in 1855 by Maurice Davis of Langport and again in 1896. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. The 15th century cross in the churchyard has a sculpture of St Michael with a sword and shield in the act of vanquishing a dragon. The rectory, known as Drayton Court, which dates from the early 19th century, is now a private house.\n"}
{"id": "2279531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279531", "title": "Double tap", "text": "Double tap\n\nA double tap is a shooting technique where two shots are fired in rapid succession at the same target with the same sight picture (as opposed to the controlled pair, where a second sight picture is acquired for the second shot). Instruction and practice of the double-tap improves overall accuracy as shooters often do not have the gun fully extended on the first shot meaning the second of a double-tap is usually the better. The term hammer is sometimes used to describe a double tap in which the firearm's sights are not reacquired by the shooter between shots.\n\nThe origin of the double tap technique is credited to William Ewart Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes, British police chiefs working in Shanghai during the 1930s who developed the technique in order to overcome the limitations of full metal jacketed (FMJ) ammunition. FMJ ammunition is commonly used by militaries for feeding reliability, adherence to the Hague Conventions regarding non-expanding ammunition, and improved penetration. FMJ rounds can fail to cause sufficient damage, requiring more hits and better shot placement. In Ian Dear’s book \"Sabotage and Subversion\" about British Special Operations Executive (SOE) and United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS) forces, Fairbairn is reported to have instructed SOE personnel in the double tap from 1944 to 1945 at the SOE training school directed by Fairbairn and Sykes near Arisaig in Scotland. The term \"double tap\" is now used to describe the broader technique of firing two rounds quickly and accurately to disable an opponent. The tactic is still used today by firearms handlers, police tactical teams, military personnel, counter-terrorist combat units, and other special operations forces personnel.\n\nThe Russian assault rifle AN-94 can automatically shoot two bullets in a rapid burst to penetrate body armor better.\n\nDouble taps are an integral part of the El Presidente combat pistol shooting drill developed by Jeff Cooper in the 1970s and published in the January/February 1979 issue of \"American Handgunner\". Also developed by Cooper in the 1970s is the Mozambique Drill or Failure Drill, for a situation where a double-tap to the torso fails to stop an attacker, adding a third shot to the head.\n\nIn the double-tap technique, after the first round is fired, the shooter quickly reacquires the sights for a fast second shot. This skill can be practiced by firing two shots at a time, taking time between the shots to reacquire the sights. With practice, the time between shots grows shorter and shorter until it seems to the observer as if the shooter is just pulling the trigger twice very quickly.\n\nAccording to a U.S. Army training manual, \"There is a natural arc of the front sight post after the round is fired and the recoil kicks in. The soldier lets the barrel go with this arc and immediately brings the front sight post back on target and takes a second shot. The soldier does not fight the recoil. In combat, soldiers shoot until the enemy goes down. For multiple targets, each target should receive a double tap. After all targets are engaged, soldiers engage the targets again as needed.\"\n\nThe term has also been used more recently to refer to the practice of following up a strike, e.g., a missile, air strikes, artillery shelling or improvised explosive device attack with a second strike several minutes later, hitting response teams, helpers, and medics rushing to the site.\n\nDouble-tap strikes have been used by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, by the United States in Pakistan and Yemen, and the Russian and Syrian governments in the Syrian Civil War.\n\n"}
{"id": "2279535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2279535", "title": "Shag (tobacco)", "text": "Shag (tobacco)\n\nShag, also known as rolling tobacco, loose tobacco, baccy and rollies is fine-cut tobacco, used to make self-made cigarettes by hand rolling the tobacco into rolling paper or injecting it into filter tubes. It got its name from the finely cut strands appearing like 'shag' fabric and was originally considered poor quality. Various types of cut are used; most shag blends use a simple mixture of cutting styles, consisting mostly of loose cut but also krumble kake, ribbon cut and flake may be used. Some shag blends use cuts reminiscent of pipe tobacco. These were imported to the United Kingdom by Rory Innes following the Virginia tobacco plantations in North America. \n\nA cigarette made with shag tobacco may be called a \"rollie\", a \"roll-up\"/\"dole-up\" or \"hand-rolled.\" The flat bags in which shag is typically packaged for commercial sale are often called \"tobacco pouches\". Oppositely, pre-processed and packaged cigarettes may be referred to colloquially as \"tailor-mades\" or \"straights\".\n\nThere are several shag blends or tobacco styles using different tobaccos, curing techniques and cutting types. Sometimes additives like sugar, glycerol and fruit flavors are added.\n\n\nShag tobacco has always had a high market-share in the Dutch tobacco-market, although it is declining. In 1989 some 53% of the combined shag and cigarette market was for shag-tobacco while in 2010 it was about 42%. Smoking shag is cheaper than smoking ready-made cigarettes. The price of a standard pouch tobacco (originally 50 grams, now often 42.5 grams) is about the same as a packet of cigarettes. As the average self-rolled cigarette will contain less than one gram of tobacco often 50 or more cigarettes are rolled from a pouch for nearly the same price as 19 or 20 ready-made cigarettes.\n\nBesides the \"hand rolled\" cigarette using brands like Drum, Samson or Van Nelle, many people also smoke \"homemade cigarettes\": with the help of a special tool they fill empty tubes with tobacco. The longer pieces of tobacco used for shag is not ideal for this use. For these smokers many (smaller) tobacco companies sell tobacco that resembles the type that is used for cigarettes: it is cut in much smaller pieces and is also \"drier\" than the normal shag. This \"home cigarette\" tobacco comes in packs or drums of 200 gram. Although the same tobacco-firms produce both shag as well as this \"cigarette\" tobacco it isn't sold under the name of their major brand-names.\n\nThe three main producers of shag-tobacco are Van Nelle, Drum and Niemeyer - where Van Nelle and Drum are both part of Imperial Tobacco since Sara Lee sold their tobacco interests, while Niemeyer is a subsidiary of British American Tobacco. Six of the top 10 brands of shag tobacco are brands of these two companies, while three of the remaining brands are \"economy\" brands sold in some of the large discount supermarkets.\n\nThe fictional detective Sherlock Holmes frequently solved crimes whilst smoking as much as an ounce (about 30 grams) of shag tobacco, as in \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\".\n\nIrish singer-songwriter Gavin Friday's 1995 album was titled \"Shag Tobacco\".\n\n\n"}
