It began and largely remained a mail-order enterprise, recruiting people through advertising in popular magazines and through direct mail solicitations.\n\nThe first advertisement for Psychiana, which Robinson himself penned and took around to local publishers in Spokane, Washington in 1929, featured a picture of Robinson with the headline, \"I TALKED WITH GOD (yes I did, actually and literally).\" Those who expressed an interest in Robinson's promises of health, wealth, and happiness by responding to one of his ads were offered a series of bi-weekly lessons by mail on a subscription plan. Robinson had his own printing presses and started a small publishing company, which offered many of his own books on various spiritual themes, as well as his memoir, \"The Strange Autobiography of Frank B. Robinson\".\n\nThematically, Robinson's ideas, as expressed in Psychiana, grew out of the metaphysical tradition and can be classified under the New Thought umbrella. Robinson adopted concepts such as affirmations, positive thinking, self-help and mental healing into Psychiana's lessons and emphasized health and material prosperity as possible rewards for dedicated and hardworking Psychiana students.\n\nRobinson said that the name he chose, \"Psychiana,\" came to him in a dream. He unabashedly referred to himself as a prophet, and envisioned his movement as becoming a worldwide, revolutionary spiritual force; at the same time, he made little effort to establish any kind of organizational structure beyond his headquarters office in Idaho, preferring to keep the operation strictly on a correspondence level.\n\nPsychiana burgeoned during the Great Depression, but Robinson offended many of his contemporaries, not only by the \"businesslike\" nature of Psychiana, but also with his harsh criticisms of conventional Christianity.\n\nDeportation proceedings were initiated against him in a federal court in Idaho, his opponents claiming that he was a foreign national illegally residing in the United States. During the trial, Robinson contended that although he had been raised in England, he had been born in New York City while his father was visiting the U.S., and was therefore a U.S. citizen. Nonetheless he was ordered to leave the country. Robinson traveled to Cuba, where he stayed briefly while Idaho Senator William Borah intervened on his behalf and helped him to obtain a visa. Robinson was soon back in Idaho and became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1942.\n\nRobinson had a penchant for mink coats and other trappings of wealth, and was accused of taking financial advantage of his followers. Mitch Horowitz devotes a chapter to Robinson in his 2009 book \"Occult America\", writing that by all accounts Robinson was sincere in his devotion to Psychiana and truly believed he was offering useful guidance and advice. Additionally, writes Horowitz, Psychiana was wildly successful, but much of the movement's income went to cover postage costs for mailing thousands of Psychiana pamphlets. Robinson's annual income was estimated at the equivalent of about $130,000 in 2009 dollars—above the average income, but not outrageously so and within the reach of many white collar workers and hardly rising to the level of an opulent lifestyle.\n\nUpon Robinson's death in 1948, his wife, Pearl Robinson, and son, Alfred Robinson, tried to continue the operation of \"Psychiana\". At the end of five years, however, Alfred shut the business down, refusing a buyout offer from St. Louis and giving \"Psychiana\"'s archived materials to the University of Idaho. It is said that Alfred, a Presbyterian, did not agree with his father's theological beliefs.\n\n\n\n"}

In the Family Computer version of the game, the cars come in three colors: red, light orange, and dark blue.\n\nGameplay in the Family Computer version is similar to that of Namco's \"Pole Position\". Finishing in first, second, or third results in a podium finish; players must win on each track to advance to the next. Vehicles in the game have a generic two-speed manual transmission governing their speed (with a \"LOW\" setting and a \"HI\" setting). There are ten tracks in the race; the game repeats itself after the conclusion of the tenth circuit. Three difficult levels help beginners to adjust to the artificial intelligence on \"skill level 1\" while novices get some extra challenge on \"skill level 2\" and experts get the ultimate challenge on \"skill level 3.\" A strict time limit forces players to finish races without mistakes in order to progress to a more complicated race track. When the player's car come into contact with other cars, it will be destroyed and respawn, usually losing several seconds.\n\nSeveral Nintendo characters appear at the end of race circuits for the Game Boy version: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Bowser, Link, Samus, Pit and Donkey Kong. The game resulted in a Grand Prix series sequel, featuring \"\" and \"\". Similar to the original, both games were never released outside Japan.\n\nThe Game Boy version has a considerably different gameplay compared to the original version, with longer race tracks set in different countries and new driving mechanics, as well as different game modes. The player is able to activate a temporary speed boost by pressing and holding up on the D-pad, this replaces the low-high gear setting from the Famicom version. In addition, the player is able to powerslide by continuing to hold left or right when turning sharp corners. Unlike the Famicom version, colliding with other cars no longer destroys the player's car and hitting an obstacle simply makes the car spin out.\n\nDevelopment of \"F1 Race\" was handled by Japanese video game designer Satoru Iwata, alongside a small team at his company HAL Laboratory. Production of the game began shortly after the completion of \"Golf\", and was in development alongside several other Famicom titles such as \"Pinball\", \"Mach Rider\" and \"Balloon Fight\". In a 1999 interview with \"Used Games\" magazine, Iwata recalled the game being a challenge to produce; \"F1 Race\" was the first Famicom game to feature raster scrolling, a feature that was not automatically built into the system, leading to him and his team having to program it from scratch. It was developed based on Iwata's personal love for racing games, which would become influential in his later projects such as the \"Mario Kart\" series and \"F-Zero\". It was published by Nintendo and released in Japan on November 2, 1984.\n\nA Game Boy version of \"F1 Race\" was published in Japan on November 9, 1990, in North America on February 3, 1991, and in Europe on October 10, 1991. The conversion was developed by Nintendo Research & Development 1 (R&D1) and designed by Naotaka Onishi, with music by Ryo Yoshiyoshi Ninohe and programming by Kenji Imai. Retitled \"F-1 Race\", it allows for four-person multiplayer via the Game Boy Four Player Adapter.\n\nGamesRadar ranked it the 49th best game available on the Game Boy and/or Game Boy Color. The staff called it a \"first-class racing game\" and praised its wide appeal to racing fans.\n"}
{"id": "1830167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830167", "title": "Saturation arithmetic", "text": "Saturation arithmetic\n\nSaturation arithmetic is a version of arithmetic in which all operations such as addition and multiplication are limited to a fixed range between a minimum and maximum value.\n\nIf the result of an operation is greater than the maximum, it is set (\"clamped\") to the maximum; if it is below the minimum, it is clamped to the minimum. The name comes from how the value becomes \"saturated\" once it reaches the extreme values; further additions to a maximum or subtractions from a minimum will not change the result.\n\nFor example, if the valid range of values is from −100 to 100, the following \"saturating arithmetic operations\" produce the following values:\n\nAs can be seen from these examples, familiar properties like associativity and distributivity may fail in saturation arithmetic. This makes it unpleasant to deal with in abstract mathematics, but it has an important role to play in digital hardware and algorithms where values have maximum and minimum representable ranges.\n\nTypically, general-purpose microprocessors do not implement integer arithmetic operations using saturation arithmetic; instead, they use the easier-to-implement modular arithmetic, in which values exceeding the maximum value \"wrap around\" to the minimum value, like the hours on a clock passing from 12 to 1. In hardware, modular arithmetic with a minimum of zero and a maximum of \"r\" − 1, where \"r\" is the radix can be implemented by simply discarding all but the lowest \"n\" digits. For binary hardware, which the vast majority of modern hardware is, the radix is 2, and the digits are bits.\n\nHowever, although more difficult to implement, saturation arithmetic has numerous practical advantages. The result is as numerically close to the true answer as possible; for 8-bit binary signed arithmetic, when the correct answer is 130, it is considerably less surprising to get an answer of 127 from saturating arithmetic than to get an answer of −126 from modular arithmetic. Likewise, for 8-bit binary unsigned arithmetic, when the correct answer is 258, it is less surprising to get an answer of 255 from saturating arithmetic than to get an answer of 2 from modular arithmetic.\n\nSaturation arithmetic also enables overflow of additions and multiplications to be detected consistently without an overflow bit or excessive computation, by simple comparison with the maximum or minimum value (provided the datum is not permitted to take on these values).\n\nAdditionally, saturation arithmetic enables efficient algorithms for many problems, particularly in digital signal processing. For example, adjusting the volume level of a sound signal can result in overflow, and saturation causes significantly less distortion to the sound than wrap-around. In the words of researchers G. A. Constantinides et al.:\nSaturation arithmetic operations are available on many modern platforms, and in particular was one of the extensions made by the Intel MMX platform, specifically for such signal-processing applications. This functionality is also available in wider versions in the SSE2 and AVX2 integer instruction sets.\n\nSaturation arithmetic for integers has also been implemented in software for a number of programming languages including C, C++, such as the GNU Compiler Collection, LLVM IR, and Eiffel. This helps programmers anticipate and understand the effects of overflow better, and in the case of compilers usually pick the optimal solution.\n\nSaturation is challenging to implement efficiently in software on a machine with only modular arithmetic operations, since simple implementations require branches that create huge pipeline delays. However, it is possible to implement saturating addition and subtraction in software without branches, using only modular arithmetic and bitwise logical operations that are available on all modern CPUs and their predecessors, including all x86 CPUs (back to the original Intel 8086) and some popular 8-bit CPUs (some of which, such as the Zilog Z80, are still in production). On the other hand, on simple 8-bit and 16-bit CPUs, a branching algorithm might actually be faster if programmed in assembly, since there are no pipelines to stall, and each instruction always takes multiple clock cycles. On the x86, which provides overflow flags and conditional moves, very simple branch-free code is possible.\n\nAlthough saturation arithmetic is less popular for integer arithmetic in hardware, the IEEE floating-point standard, the most popular abstraction for dealing with approximate real numbers, uses a form of saturation in which overflow is converted into \"infinity\" or \"negative infinity\", and any other operation on this result continues to produce the same value. This has the advantage over simple saturation that later operations decreasing the value will not end up producing a misleadingly \"reasonable\" result, such as in the computation formula_1. Alternatively, there may be special states such as \"exponent overflow\" (and \"exponent underflow\") that will similarly persist through subsequent operations, or cause immediate termination, or be tested for as in codice_1 as in FORTRAN for the IBM704 (October 1956).\n\n\n"}

More specifically, the word \"gettone\" can be used to refer to the \"gettone telefonico\" (telephone token), which was used during much of the 20th century in Italian phone booths.\n\nThe \"gettone\" was introduced in 1927 by STIPEL and subsequently adopted by other telephone companies. The last version of it (as reproduced in the picture linked below) was produced from 1959 to 1980. In this last version, the \"gettone\" had the date marked on it in the form of a four digit number at the bottom of the obverse side of the token. The first two digits represent the year in which the token was minted. The last two digits represent the month. Example: \"7805\" represents \"May 1978\". Its use ceased in 2001, in coincidence with the upcoming introduction of the European wide Euro currency in 2002.\n\nIn the 70's the value of the metal used in Italian small coins had reached a higher value than the face value. This led to a coin shortage in the market, forcing the circulating use of gettone, stamps and bus tickets for small transactions or part exchanges of a larger payment.\n\n\"Gettoni\" became so common and so well known that they were considered legal tender, almost always being accepted as payment.\nOne g\"ettone\" was valued 50 lire up to 1980, 100 lire up to 1984 and 200 lire from 1984.

{"id": "1830174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830174", "title": "Battle of Schooneveld", "text": "Battle of Schooneveld\n\nThe Battles of Schooneveld were two naval battles of the Franco-Dutch War, fought off the coast of the Netherlands on 7 June and 14 June 1673 (New Style; 28 May and 4 June in the Julian calendar then in use in England) between an allied Anglo-French fleet commanded by Prince Rupert of the Rhine on his flagship the Royal Charles, and the fleet of the United Provinces, commanded by Michiel de Ruyter.\n\nThe Dutch victories in the two battles, and at the Battle of Texel that followed in August, saved their country from an Anglo-French invasion.\n\nThe Franco-Dutch War of 1672–1678 resulted from the attempts of Louis XIV of France to annex the Spanish Netherlands. In 1672, troops from France, Münster and Cologne invaded the Netherlands by land, while England's navy attacked Dutch shipping and threatened a seaborne invasion. The conflict between England and the Republic is commonly called the Third Anglo-Dutch War.\n\nThe years 1672-1673 were particularly desperate for the Dutch, with the French stopped only by Holland Water Line, a deliberate flooding of large parts of the countryside, and the withdrawing of guns and men from the fleet to augment the army of William III of Orange, now Admiral-General of the fleet. A surprise attack by De Ruyter in June 1672, resulting in the Battle of Solebay, had however prevented the allies from establishing naval superiority on the North Sea, keeping open the sea lanes so vital to Dutch trade.\n\nWhen the French invaded, the Orangist party took power, falsely accusing the former leading politician Johan de Witt and his personal friend Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter of plotting to betray the Republic to the French. The Orangists themselves were in fact subsidised by the English. Both England and France hoped to create a Dutch puppet state, using the enormous Dutch mercantile assets to gain world trade dominance, each expecting that any moment the Dutch might surrender to one of them, but fearing not being the one chosen. Therefore, during the battles, mutual suspicion between the French and the English was considerable. This reflected political divisions within the Dutch fleet. De Ruyter was seen as pro-French, while Lieutenant-Admiral Cornelis Tromp, readmitted to the Dutch fleet early in 1673, was a, traditionally pro-English, Orangist. William had asked De Ruyter to purify the fleet from supporters of the old States regime, but the admiral refused. De Ruyter accused Tromp in his face of hoping to sabotage his command in the middle of a battle, but his fears proved to be unfounded. Tromp cared for battle honours above all else.\n\nMichiel de Ruyter, since February 1673 Lieutenant-Admiral-General of the confederate Dutch fleet, planned to blockade the main English fleet in the Medway by sinking blockships in its narrowest part, then deal with the remaining English squadrons at his leisure. But the English fleet took to sea in time to prevent this operation, and De Ruyter retreated on 15 May to the Schooneveld, the coastal waters at the mouth of the Schelde River, near the island of Walcheren, to prevent the allies from establishing the naval superiority needed for the transport and landing of a force of 6,000 soldiers of the English Army waiting at Yarmouth. The Schooneveld basin, between two shoals, was so narrow the allies could not take advantage of their numerical superiority. There, De Ruyter was joined by Tromp, adding the squadrons of the admiralties of Amsterdam and the Northern Quarter to that of the Admiralty of de Maze and the Zealandic fleet. De Ruyter read a message from the stadtholder to his captains, informing them they were not only the champions of their nation but of the whole of Christendom and that for any cowards, \"the least safe place will be the ports of the State for there they shall escape neither the severe hand of Justice nor the curse and hatred of their compatriots\", many later being overheard repeating these words to themselves.\n\nOn 2 June 1673 (New Style; 23 May in the Julian calendar then in use in England), the allies, deciding they had waited long enough, approached the Dutch fleet. Prince Rupert had a considerable superiority in ships (eighty-six against sixty-four), men (24,295 to 14,762) and cannon (4,826 to 3,157) — indeed the Dutch admirals nicknamed their fleet the \"Little Hope\". The Dutch fleet was smaller than usual because the Admiralty of Frisia was unable to assist, that province and Groningen being attacked by Bernhard von Galen, bishop of Münster. However a sudden storm prevented a battle. On 7 June, the wind blowing from the northwest, Rupert tried again and arranged his own squadron of the Red in the van, the French squadron of the White commanded by Jean II d'Estrées in the centre, and Sir Edward Spragge's squadron of the Blue in the rear. The Dutch van was commanded by Tromp, the centre by Lieutenant-Admiral Aert Jansse van Nes under direct supervision of De Ruyter himself and the rear by Lieutenant-Admiral Adriaen Banckert.\n\nRupert, convinced that the smaller Dutch fleet would withdraw to Hellevoetsluis when pressed, detached a special squadron at nine in the morning to cut off the retreating Dutch from the north. In this taskforce he concentrated all lighter ships from the regular squadrons so that it would be able to manoeuvre more easily over the shoals. However, De Ruyter did not budge. When however the squadron at last returned to the main allied line, joining Rupert's squadron, the Dutch started to move, but surprisingly in the direction of the enemy. This forced Rupert to attack immediately to prevent the Dutch from gaining the weather gauge, before he could form a proper keel line.\n\nThe battle began at noon and lasted for nine hours. Using his superior knowledge of the shallow waters, De Ruyter was able to manoeuvre his fleet so close to the shoals that the allies found it difficult to engage without grounding.\n\nRupert first made contact with the squadron of Cornelis Tromp. He had now about half of the allied fleet with him. Sailing slowly to the northeast after some time he reached the edge of the basin. This gave him the opportunity to surround Tromp from the north with the mass of frigates while simultaneously using his favourable windward position to attack him directly from the west with the heavy English ships. The frigate squadron was now in complete disarray however and could not execute such a complicated manoeuvre. Nor did Rupert choose the direct attack. He was much criticised for this afterwards and defended himself by claiming his approach would have been blocked by shoals. This was simply not true and Rupert knew it. Whatever his motives he turned to the southwest, both fleets bombarding each other from a distance, the Dutch inferiority in numbers compensated by the fact that their leeward position gave their guns a better range and the lack of a proper battle line in the enemy squadron.\n\nDe Ruyter had at first closely followed Tromp; but becoming aware the French flotilla of de Grancey had joined Spragge against Banckert, creating a gap in the French line, he suddenly tacked to the southwest, separating Tromp from the rest of the Dutch fleet. This greatly surprised the French fleet. The French main force of d'Estrées, both frightened and delighted by what it saw as a brilliant manoeuvre, disengaged slowly to the northwest to keep the weather gauge, but like Rupert didn't use this position to attack. This caused De Ruyter to comment: \"The \"De Zeven Provinciën\" can still inspire awe among its enemies\". The Dutch centre now moved in opposite tack behind the enemy rear. Spragge understood that if De Ruyter reached the southern edge of the basin his force would be trapped between the Dutch centre and rear. He immediately broke formation to tack to the southwest also, narrowly escaping to the west with his flotilla, but leaving the flotillas of Ossorey and Kempthorne behind with that of de Grancey in a slower turn in the same direction. Banckert now united his squadron with the Dutch centre by making a similar but larger turn, sailing behind De Ruyter. The Dutch supreme commander had thus gained an excellent position: the enemy fleet was now divided in four uncoordinated parts and he could attack the confused enemy rear with a numerical superiority having the weather gauge. At that moment he had no knowledge of Tromp's situation however and typically decided not to take any unnecessary risks but to join Tromp with the remainder of the Dutch fleet instead, saying: \"First things first; it's better to help friends than to harm enemies\". He tacked to the northeast, Banckert now in front, towards both vanguards moving in the opposite direction. Seeing him approach Tromp yelled to his men: \"There's Granddad! (the Dutch sailors used this term of endearment for De Ruyter) He's coming to help us. I in return shall never abandon him, as long as I can breathe!\" The heat of battle transcended the old animosities. As the Dutch crews of the van had become rather nervous by the size of their opposing force, Tromp had for hours pretended to be in signal contact with the Dutch centre. The allied rear could now escape to the west also.\n\nWhen the Dutch main force reached Tromp it again tacked to the southwest forming a perfect continuous line of battle with his squadron. The allied rear tried to do likewise with their centre and van, but its formations remained very confused. Spragge, having moved far to the north to reach Tromp, his personal enemy, now inserted his flotilla between d'Estrées and Rupert. The combined Dutch fleet then broke repeatedly through the many gaps in the allied line and Rupert, worried by the mounting disorder in his fleet, was happy to disengage at nightfall, only halting his retreat at first light, when it became clear the Dutch were not pursuing. Two French ships were lost (as well as several French fireships expended ineffectually against the Dutch fleet), one Dutch ship was captured and then recaptured, and one, \"Deventer\" (70), sank after grounding the next day. Dutch Vice-Admiral Volckhard Schram (of the van) and Rear-Admiral David Vlugh (of the rearguard) were killed.\n\nThe allies cruised off the Dutch coast for a week, each accusing the other of having caused the failure, while the British gave vent to recriminations against each other also. Spragge accused Rupert: \"...the battle was, in truth, as ill fought on our side, as ever yet I saw\". Worse was to come however. The allies had no intention to enter the Schooneveld again. Captain George Legge of HMS \"Royal Katherine\" wrote to his Lord High Admiral the Duke of York: \"That hole is too little and the sands too dangerous for us to venture among them again\". They hoped to lure the Dutch fleet to open sea; when at first nothing happened they grew so despondent, they were surprised when the Dutch did in fact come out. On 14 June 1673, De Ruyter, reinforced by four ships (including the heavy \"Oliphant\" and \"Voorzichtigheid\") and fresh crews and fully resupplied, took advantage of a favourable northwest wind to attack the allied line. In this battle the allies were in total disarray — partly the result of having been two weeks at sea, including one battle — but mainly because of a curious coincidence: it so happened Spragge, now commanding the van, was visiting Rupert the moment the Dutch attacked. He immediately left for his squadron, but Rupert, suddenly fearing Spragge could never reach his force in time, decided to form the van with his own rear squadron. He tried to overtake the French in the centre, but never having made his intentions clear to them, they did their utmost to remain in formation, i.e. in front of Rupert. Needless to say, the chaos was complete.\n\nEdward Spragge wrote in his journal:\n\nRupert repeatedly raised the bloodflag and then lowered it again upon seeing the confusion among his ships, which made a coordinated attack impossible. De Ruyter, utterly amazed and exclaiming, \"What's wrong with this man? Has he gone mad or what?\", exploited this disarray by engaging from some distance and firing at the allied masts and rigging, severely damaging Rupert's squadron. The French, when attacked by Banckert, disengaged immediately, very suspicious of the bizarre course of events. Only Tromp clashed with great fury with his eternal enemy Spragge until nightfall.\n\nA heavy sea made it impossible for the allies, though in a leeward position, to open their lower gunports, and strong gales had driven all three fleets dangerously close to the British coast. Rupert now desperately attempted to close with the Dutch to save his fleet from destruction, but they, four miles from the coast, retreated to save theirs, and by the morning of 15 June, the damaged allied fleets sailed into the Thames and De Ruyter was safely back in the Schooneveld.\n\nThe allies had not lost any ships, but they had suffered considerable damage and had to return to port for repairs.\n\nBy skillful manoeuvre, De Ruyter had fought two engagements against a superior fleet, inflicted such damage against his opponents that they were forced to lift the blockade and retire, and taken care to avoid the decisive battle that the allies were hoping to fight.\n\nAfter refitting and establishing with great difficulty somewhat more cordial relationships, the allies decided to cruise off the Texel in the hope of drawing De Ruyter out of the Schooneveld and bringing him to action. But the resulting Battle of Texel was a Dutch victory, and England was forced to withdraw from the costly and unproductive war.\n\n"}

Recanati was founded around 1150 AD from three pre-existing castles. In 1290 it proclaimed itself an independent republic and, in the 15th century, was famous for its international fair. In March 1798 it was conquered by Napoleon Bonaparte.\nIt is the hometown of the tenor Beniamino Gigli and the poet Giacomo Leopardi, which is why the town is known to some as \"the city of poetry\". Famous medieval ashkenazi kabbalist rabbi Menahem Recanati flourished here in the 13th century. Teatro Persiani named after Giuseppe Persiani an opera composer, born in 1799, is located in the town.\n\nThe origin of Recanati are unclear, although the area was inhabited since prehistoric times by the Piceni. In Roman times, the river Potenza, which was navigable then, saw the rise of two cities: \"Potentia\", at the mouth, and \"Helvia Recina\", located more inland. When the Goths led by Radagaisus ravaged the region around 406 AD, their inhabitants took refuge on the hills, perhaps founding the modern Recanati, which would take its name from Ricina.\n\nIn the 12th century, during the controversies between Frederick Barbarossa and the Papacy, Recanati expelled the feudal counts which ruled its area, and gave itself a communal constitution under the lead of consuls (\"consoli\"). In 1203 they were replaced by \"podestà\". In 1228, Recanati sided with Barbarossa's nephew, Frederick II, who again was in conflict with the popes; for this aid, the town was given the control of the nearby Adriatic shore, and the right to found a port (the modern Porto Recanati). In 1239, however, Recanati supported the pope, and the following year Gregory IX gave it the title of City and bishopric seat that had been previously held by the nearby Osimo.\n\nIn the early 14th century, the strife between Guelphs and Ghibellines, which plagued much of Italy, also affected Recanati. In a series of incidents, citizens of Recanati, among the others, ravaged and plundered the cathedral, and later killed some Guelph (pro-papal) exponents. In response, in 1322, papal mercenaries besieged Recanati, and destroyed its fortifications, the main Ghibelline palaces, and the Priors' Palaces. By 1328, the Pope had pardoned the city; however, her seat as a bishopric was restored only in 1354. In 1415 Recanati hosted former Pope Gregory XII, who died here two years later.\n\nAt the time, the town was home to a popular trading fair, which was further boosted by Pope Martin V in 1422. During several centuries of economic prosperity, Recanati became home to prominent jurists, writers, and artists such as Lorenzo Lotto and Guercino.\n\nRecanati was occupied by Napoleonic troops in 1798. In 1831 it took part to the Risorgimento riots, and was annexed to the newly formed Kingdom of Italy in 1860 after the dissolution of most of the Papal States.\n\n\n\n\nThe Diocese of Recanati was a Roman Catholic diocese in Italy. It was founded in 1240 by Pope Gregory IX.[1]\n\nIts principal church, S. Flaviano, was raised to the dignity of a cathedral on 21 December 1239, and separated from the jurisdiction of the diocese of Osimo. The diocese of Osimo was suppressed, having chosen to support the Emperor Frederick II against the pope.[2] On 22 May 1240, the Castello di Recanati was raised to the dignity of a city by Gregory IX.[3]\n\nDuring its early history it often lost and regained its episcopal status due to Papal politics.[4] On 27 July 1263 the diocese was completely suppressed by Pope Urban IV in the Bull Cives Recanatensis, due to its support of Manfred, who claimed the Kingdom of Sicily.[5]\n\n"}

{"id": "1830189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830189", "title": "Madden NFL 06", "text": "Madden NFL 06\n\nMadden NFL 06 is an American football video game which was released in 2005. It is also a launch game for the Xbox 360. It is the 16th installment of the Madden NFL series by EA Sports, named for noted color commentator John Madden. The product features former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb on the cover. It is the first Madden game for the PlayStation Portable and Xbox 360.\n\nThe game's box art was the first Madden football game to not include Madden's picture on it. The game also features WWE and UFC superstar, Brock Lesnar as a playable character.\n\n\"Madden 06\" introduces the Superstar mode, which allows the player to create and take control of an NFL player from his rookie year all the way to retirement. An athlete can be created by evaluating pairs of judging, based on their IQs, occupations, and hobbies, whether their child would excel in the NFL or by importing a player. Superstar mode is essentially Madden's Franchise mode seen through the eyes of this athlete. Rather than manage the team's front office, the player manages the career of his athlete.\n\nIt also features the new QB Vision Control. A cone, appearing as a spotlight emitting from the quarterback, simulates his field of vision. To make an accurate pass, the quarterback must have his intended receiver in his field of vision. Passing to a receiver not in the cone reduces pass accuracy significantly. The size of the quarterback's vision cone is directly correlated to his Awareness rating.\n\nHowever, this has been criticized by many fans because it may resemble some bias that EA Sports and the Madden series itself is frequently accused of. A player can shift the vision cone with the right analog stick, or focus the cone on a specific receiver by holding a shoulder button and pressing the button assigned to that receiver. This change also met with the poor reception. Although the passing system adds a whole new level of realism, it also makes the game significantly more difficult for players playing teams with less-aware quarterbacks. These players will be forced to improve their reflexes in order to be competitive, as throwing outside the QB vision cone results in a very weak and inaccurate pass.\n\nAccompanying QB Vision is Precision Passing. Pressing the directional button or left analog stick in a certain direction as the quarterback passes the ball will make the throw over the receiver's head, behind him, in front of him, or at his knees.\n\nThe most critically acclaimed new feature is the highlight stick, which functions like an offensive version of the hit stick from the previous year. When running the football, a player can push forward the right analog stick to run over the defender, at the cost of risking a potential fumble. Several features from previous titles return such as hot routes, playmaker features, and franchise features.\n\nThe soundtrack for \"Madden NFL 06\" featured EA Trax integration that includes Avenged Sevenfold, Tech N9ne, Memphis Bleek, Slim Thug, Disturbed, Foo Fighters and many more hip hop/rock artists.\n\nThe player could import their created player from Own The City mode in \"NFL Street 2\" into the game's Superstar mode after finishing the game mode. The player starts as an 18-year-old rookie in NFL Superstar mode and attributes are given by how development points were distributed in \"NFL Street 2\". Also, draft classes from \"NCAA Football 06\" could be imported to franchise mode. If the player has a save file from \"Madden NFL 06\", they can unlock the Madden Challenge Bus in \"Burnout Revenge\"; a gameplay demo of \"Revenge\" is also available on the PlayStation 2 version of the game.\n\nThe game was met with very positive to mixed reception. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 85.26% and 88 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 84.11% and 86 out of 100 for the Xbox version; 83.07% and 86 out of 100 for the GameCube version; 76.61% and 78 out of 100 for the PC version; 74.55% and 74 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version; 74.14% and 75 out of 100 for the PSP version; 69% and 71 out of 100 for the Game Boy Advance version; 66.67% for the Mobile version; and 63.22% and 66 out of 100 for the DS version.\n\nFans and EA developers both view \"Madden NFL 06\" as \"the undisputed lemon of the franchise\", because of the concurrent shift from the Xbox and PlayStation 2 to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The passing cone was so unpopular that it disappeared in \"Madden NFL 09\". Reviewers criticized the game's lack of new features and lackluster soundtrack (a recurring complaint), claiming the game plays very similarly to \"Madden NFL 2005\" if the QB Vision cone is turned off. GameSpot gave the mobile version a score of 7 out of 10 and called it \"a decent game of football with a solid statistical foundation. It breaks new ground for the franchise and promises future installments for football fans. However, this edition definitely shows EA's wireless inexperience and wasn't the stunner it should have been. In particular, the game's visuals are a disappointment. If you already have a V Cast phone, Madden 06 isn't a bad way to go. It's just not the killer app that forces an upgrade.\" Similarly, IGN gave the same version seven out of ten, saying that the game \"was developed not internally, but by a development house called Finite Monkeys. And it ultimately feels like they were rushed to get this game on the decks by \"Madden Tuesday.\" This is unfortunate, because I think a lot of people will download the game hoping to have a \"Madden experience\" on their handset, and just end up with an average football game, albeit one with above-average visuals and spoken commentary.\"\n\n\"Madden NFL 06\" was 2005's only NFL-Licensed football videogame, due to the 2004 deal between the NFL/NFLPA and Electronic Arts. The deal grants EA exclusive rights to the likenesses and names of all players, stadiums, logos, and jerseys. Electronic Arts also signed a long-term deal with ESPN, complicating the game's relationship to its titular announcer. In early 2006, Madden — at the time under contract as color commentator for ABC's Monday Night Football — moved to NBC to join their Sunday night NFL coverage beginning in the 2006 season. The Xbox 360 version of Madden 06 features neither Al Michaels nor Madden in the announcing booth. Some positives with the Xbox 360 version were the right stick being used for the QB Vision feature and different songs from the original.\n\nIn the United States, the game's PlayStation Portable version alone sold 590,000 copies and earned $28 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 48th highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country.\n\nE3 2005 Game Critics Awards: Best Sports Game\n"}

{"id": "1830215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830215", "title": "Henri Selmer Paris", "text": "Henri Selmer Paris\n\nHenri Selmer Paris is a French family-owned enterprise, manufacturer of musical instruments based at Mantes-la-Ville near Paris. Founded in 1885, it is known as a producer of professional-grade woodwind and brass instruments, especially saxophones, clarinets and trumpets.\n\nSelmer Paris instruments have been played by many well-known saxophonists such as Marcel Mule, Claude Delangle, Frederick Hemke, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Paul Desmond, Herschel Evans, Zoot Sims, Michael Brecker, Sonny Rollins, Ornette Coleman and Coleman Hawkins. Among famous Selmer Clarinet players is Benny Goodman in his early career.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, brothers Alexandre and Henri Selmer graduated from the Paris Conservatory as clarinetists. They were the great-grandchildren of French military drum major Johannes Jacobus Zelmer, grandchildren of Jean-Jacques Selmer, the Army Chief of Music, and two of 16 children in this musical family. At the time, musical instruments and accessories were primarily hand made, and professional musicians found it necessary to acquire skills allowing them to make their own accessories and repair and modify their own instruments. Establishing Henri Selmer & Cie. in 1885, Henri began making clarinet reeds and mouthpieces. In 1898 Selmer opened a store and repair shop in Paris and started producing clarinets. In 1904, Selmer clarinets were presented at the Saint Louis (USA) World's Fair, winning a Gold Medal. Alexandre Selmer established himself in New York in 1909, opening a shop that sold Selmer clarinets and mouthpieces. The H&A Selmer (USA) Company, originally a retail partnership between the two brothers, was incorporated to expand with H. Selmer & Cie retaining a minority interest in 1923, then sold to its American partner George Bundy in 1927, ending the financial interest of H. Selmer & Cie in the company.\n\nA semi-independent branch of Selmer for the United Kingdom was created in 1928 under the leadership of two brothers, Ben and Lew Davis. They concentrated primarily on licensing, importing and distribution rather than manufacturing, and by 1939 had grown to become the largest company in the British musical instrument industry.\n\nIn 1935 Selmer UK began producing sound reinforcement systems under the Selmer name. They expanded their manufacturing facilities by purchasing another P.A. company called RSA in 1946. By 1951 they were manufacturing electric organs and in 1955 they gained the exclusive licensing rights to make Lowrey organs and Leslie organ speakers for the UK. They were also the primary importers and distributors for Höfner guitars, a well-known German guitar company, from the early 1950s through the early 1970s. In 1967, Höfner actually produced a small range of semi-acoustic and acoustic guitars for Selmer UK These were badged with the Selmer logo and most had a Selmer \"lyre\" tailpiece. Model names were the Astra, Emperor, Diplomat, Triumph and Arizona Jumbo.\n\nWith the growth of skiffle music and the arrival of rock and roll in the mid-1950s, Selmer UK began producing guitar and bass amplifiers. In the early 1960s, despite Selmer's apparent market domination, The Shadows' and The Beatles' endorsement of Vox amplifiers relegated Selmer guitar amplifiers to a distant second place in sales. The management of the company made various lukewarm attempts to gain endorsement from aspiring musicians but became increasingly distant from the developments in pop culture from the mid-1960s considering that its role was to support \"real\" or established professional musicians and not the headliners of the pop industry. This was the beginning of the end for Selmer UK.\n\nBy the early 1970s Selmer UK had been purchased by Chicago Musical Instruments, then the parent company of Gibson Guitars, which Selmer was distributing in the UK. By this time Marshall guitar amplifiers had cornered the market, and the Selmer manufacturing facility was an expensive drain on resources. During this period, the Selmer range of Treble & Bass 50 & 100 valve amplifiers appeared to be stylistic relics from pre-1959 and the decision was made to move the manufacturing facility to a disused brush and coconut matting works dating from 1914, based in rural Essex. The factory which purchased from Music and Plastic Industries. This was a disaster, coupled as it was to an uninspiring reworking of the Selmer range of speaker cabinets and the introduction of a poorly designed range of solid state power amplifiers.\n\nAfter being passed around several other owners, Selmer once again found itself owned by the Gibson Guitar parent company, this time through a holding company called Norlin Music USA. The marketing policy adopted by management involved allowing its distributors to arrange short-term loans of Gibson instruments on a trial basis. This was considered an excellent marketing ploy had it been controlled but the reality of the situation was that instrument loans were made freely available to any musician and bands who made a request. The consequences were that these very expensive musical instruments were used, damaged, and returned unsold to the UK warehouse, where attempts were made to repair them with the limited facilities on hand, as the distribution agreement with the manufacturing base in Kalamazoo, Michigan, did not allow for the return of defective items. At one time in 1977 there were over one thousand damaged, broken and disassembled Gibson guitars stored in an unheated warehouse in Braintree, Essex.\n\nThe factory in Braintree also developed the manufacturing of Lowrey keyboards from KD kits exported from the Chicago manufacturing base of CMI. These instruments were technically advanced but the build quality was poor compared with keyboards which were just beginning to reach the UK and European markets from Japan. To supplement earnings the company took the decision to import a low cost Italian designed organ marketed as a Selmer product which was distributed in large numbers by catalogue sales. Again the return rate, this time due to damage in transit, was significant. In spite of a rebranding as Norlin Music (UK) the management of the company failed to address the key factors preferring to effect a range of cost-cutting measures. In 1976 Norlin Music Inc., faced with mounting debts, began dismantling Selmer UK piece by piece, until the only facility was a repair center for Lowrey organs with a single employee. This shut down in the early 1980s.\n\nDespite being largely unknown in the U.S., Selmer guitar amplifiers from the early 1960s have begun to gain a reputation as vintage collectibles among valve amplifier enthusiasts.\n\nIn 1932 Selmer partnered with the Italian guitarist and luthier Mario Maccaferri to produce a line of acoustic guitars based on Maccaferri's unorthodox design. Although Maccaferri's association with Selmer ended in 1934, the company continued to make several models of this guitar until 1952. The guitar was closely associated with famed jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt. (see also Selmer-Maccaferri Guitar and About Selmer-Maccaferri guitars)\n\n\n\n\nSelmer Paris sold less-expensive clarinets under the names Barbier, Bundy (Paris) and Raymond until ca. 1935, after which they focused exclusively on professional clarinets.\n\nNote: Selmer Paris harmony clarinets (sizes other than B♭ and A soprano clarinet) are mostly called by their model number rather than a name, but there are, for example, RI bass clarinets and Series 9 alto and bass clarinets.\n\nThey are usually custom made guitars for professionals. Their cost are\ndepending on wood and upgrades like tuners, frets, size, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Rather than residing in the Manoogian Mansion, official residence of the mayor of Detroit, Gribbs maintained residence in Rosedale Park Historic District (Detroit, Michigan), a neighborhood in northwest Detroit. In 1969, Gribbs created the Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets (STRESS), a secret and elite police unit.\n\nSTRESS used a tactic called \"decoy operation,\" where a police officer tried to entrap potential criminals in an undercover sting. From its inception, STRESS all but ignored white criminals, instead focusing their operations on black communities. STRESS increased confrontations between the black community and police. For example, during its first year of operation the Detroit Police Department had the \"highest number of civilian killings per capita of any American police department.\" The unit was accused of conducting 500 raids without the use of search warrants and killing 20 people within 30 months.\n\nIn 1973, Gribbs declined to seek re-election and was replaced by Coleman Young who was elected Detroit's first African-American mayor in November of that year.\n\nAfter leaving the mayor's office, Gribbs returned to private practice. Gribbs became a circuit court judge in 1975. He was elected to the Michigan Court of Appeals in 1982, upon which he served until his retirement in 2001. Gribbs retired to Northville in suburban Detroit, and conducted private practice in mediation and arbitration. He was the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Piast Institute, a research center devoted to Polish and Polish American affairs.\n\nGribbs was married to Katherine Stratis (1932–2011) from 1954 to 1982, and together they had four daughters (Paula, Carla, Rebecca, Elizabeth) and one son (Christopher). In 1990, he married Leola Young Barr. Lee had two children by a previous marriage, Robert Brent Barr, deceased, and Dr Michelle Barr. Gribbs died on April 5, 2016 at his home in Northville, Michigan from cancer, aged 90.\n"}

It was managed under the general supervision of the Minister of Health. Before entering the operating theatre, an anaesthetic consisting of Nupercaine was administered by means of a lumbar puncture. The spinal anaesthetics had been given by Dr.Malcolm Graham. At that time, it was common practice to store such anaesthetic in glass ampoules immersed in a phenol solution to reduce the risk of infection. Unknown to the staff, the glass had a number of micro-cracks which were invisible to the eye but which allowed the phenol to penetrate. When used, the phenol-contaminated anaesthetic caused permanent paraplegia.\n\nA later analysis suggests that the most probable cause of the paralyses was an acidic descaler which, by an oversight, had been allowed to remain in the sterilizing water boiler.\n\nAs the law then stood, to find negligence proved, there must be a duty of care, the defendant must have breached that duty, and that breach must have caused the loss or damage sustained by the plaintiff. The standard of care required of defendants was judged by applying an objective test, considering what a \"reasonable man\" would or would not have done in the same situation. In \"Hall v Brooklands Auto Racing Club\" (1933) 1 KB 205, it was held that it was the duty of the operators to ensure that the racing track they had designed was as free from danger as reasonable care and skill could make it, but that they were not insurers against accidents which no reasonable diligence could foresee. Similarly, in \"Glasgow Corporation v Muir\" (1943) 2 AER 44, a defendant was not negligent in allowing a group to enter a tea room to escape bad weather, because the \"reasonable man\" would not have foreseen that these invitees would be injured (scalded) upon entering the tearoom.\n\nIn the Supreme Court of Judicature, court of appeal the learned Justices said as follows:\n\nDenning LJ. \"We must not look at the 1947 incident with 1954 spectacles.\" It was held that the micro-cracks were not foreseeable given the prevailing scientific knowledge of the time. Thus, since no reasonable anaesthetist would have stored the anaesthetic differently, it was inappropriate to hold the hospital management liable for failing to take precautions. That the profession had changed its practice in the light of experience proved that the profession was responsible in its self-regulation. In 1954, anaesthetists coloured the phenol with a dye. If a vial became contaminated, the dye showed inside the vial. These vials were then discarded. But, given that the hospital was applying the best practice of the time, there was no negligence.\n\nSomervell LJ. \"It is now clear that phenol can find its way into an ampoule of nupercaine stored in a solution of phenol through cracks which are not detectable by the ordinary visual or tactile examination which takes place in an operating theatre — these cracks were referred to in the evidence as \"invisible cracks\" — or through molecular flaws in the glass. The attention of the profession was first drawn to this risk in this country by the publication of Professor Macintosh's book on Lumbar Puncture and Spinal Anaesthesia in 1951. In 1947 the general run of competent anaesthetists would not appreciate this risk. (Dr Mcintosh, Day 3, 18, 19, 42-E; Dr Organe, Day 8, 61; Dr Cope, Day 9, 25). Dr Graham certainly did not appreciate this as a risk. I accordingly find that by the standard of knowledge to be imputed to competent anaesthetists in 1947, Dr Graham was not negligent in failing to appreciate this risk and a fortiori the theatre staff were not negligent.\"\n\nMorris LJ \"It is now known that there could be cracks not ordinarily detectable. But care has to be exercised to ensure that conduct in 1947 is only judged in the light of knowledge which then was or ought reasonably to have been possessed. In this connection the then-existing state of medical literature must be had in mind. The question arises whether Dr Graham was negligent in not adopting some different technique. I cannot think that he was\"\n\n"}

Charlestown High School is the only high school in Charlestown. Charlestown is part of Boston which means the school is part of the Boston Public School System. According to the article, \"Focus On Children, the Boston Publics Schools School Report Card,\" of the students enrolled in 2003-2004, 70.6% were in regular education 7.1% in bilingual education, and 22.2% in the special education. The racial/ethnic composition of the student population in the school was: 46.3% Black, 26.4% Hispanic, 19.5% Asian, and 7.6% White.\n\nThe school consists of grades nine through twelve. The school provides a strong academic program due to the five small learning communities/pathways. These communities and pathways are within an upper school and lower school. They were created in 1998 and 1999. The five small learning communities have a college-based curriculum with a signature theme. These signature themes range from web design, law & justice, and pre-engineering, to business/technology and MCAS preparation/academics. There are ten teachers and one leader in each small learning communities. Each teacher has one specific theme to teach.\n\nThe Charlestown High School curriculum is strongly based on preparing students for a college education. In addition to the basic curriculum, extensive attention is given to college and exploration. Most of the students participate in the Boston University COACH (College Orientation and Career Help) program. Each Friday two groups of Boston University students come to the school where they divide up by teams and go to the pathways classes, for both juniors and seniors. They work with the students on the entire college application process and portray what college life is like to the students. Since the Boston University (and Harvard at one point) COACH program has been at the Charlestown High School, college application and admission has risen 28%. Because of this rise in college applicants at Charlestown High, over 70 percent of the recent graduates have gone to college.\n\nCharlestown High School is also known for its vibrant visual arts program. Recognized in a 2005 Fund for Teachers award, student artwork adorns many school and municipal facilities. Other electives include a popular forensics class and Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps.\n\nIn addition, the school provides extensive support services through college and business partnerships, such Harvard, Bunker Hill, Liberty Mutual and more. Student volunteers from the Harvard College chapter of Peer Health Exchange also visit the high school to teach sexual and health education classes.\n\nCharlestown High School received considerable national attention in the 1975-1976 school\nyear when court-mandated forced busing brought African-American children to what was at that time a predominantly white high school in an Irish neighborhood of Boston. Forced busing initially brought great discord and resulted in fights and arrests. There were also enduring images such as the famous photograph of a black and a white student holding hands out the window of their school bus (see the NPR article in the external links below).\n\nContributing to the discord was the infamous September 28, 1979 school shooting of Darryl K. Williams, an African-American football player for Jamaica Plain High School, at Charlestown High School during a football game. Three Irish Americans, at least one of whom had dropped out of Charlestown High School, shot Williams at halftime on the field from a building rooftop while his team was huddled for a pep talk. (See List of school shootings in the United States). Williams was permanently paralyzed below the neck. The shooting was initially considered racially motivated, and a race riot was barely averted. However, a large rally in support of the shooting victim was held at City Hall Plaza in Boston for Williams. Also, for security reasons Charlestown High School did not play home football games for nine years.\n\nThe Charletown High school boys basketball team is in the Boston City League. The Basketball team won the State Championship for four straight years, in 1999-2003. The team won the Division 2 State Championshion again in 2005. In the 2004-2005 season the team record was 26 and 1. For all these years, the head coach was Jack O'Brien and his assistant coaches were Zach Zegarowski, Steve Cassidy and Hugh Coleman.

It is led by the prelature of a bishop administering the diocese from the mother church St. Mary's Cathedral in Fall River, Massachusetts.\n\nThe diocese was canonically erected by Pope Pius X on March 12, 1904, taking its territories from the Diocese of Providence in Rhode Island. It comprises the counties of Barnstable, Bristol, Dukes, and Nantucket, as well as three towns in Plymouth County.\n\nReligious include the bishop, 147 priests currently serving in parishes, 90 permanent deacons, 16 religious brothers and 295 religious sisters. There are 96 parishes, 11 missions, a health care center, and 5 nursing homes.\n\nThe total Catholic population of the area as of 2013 is approximately 313,115.\n\nThe diocese maintains one college, Stonehill, five high schools — (Bishop Connolly High School in Fall River, Bishop Stang High School in Dartmouth, Bishop Feehan High School in Attleboro, Coyle and Cassidy School in Taunton, and Saint Pope John Paul II High School in Hyannis), two middle schools and fifteen elementary schools.\n\nThe current Superintendent of Schools is Stephen Perla. \nThe following is a list of superintendents:\n\nThe following is a list of bishops and their terms of service:\n\n\n\n\n\nFather William Stang was appointed the first bishop of Fall River March 12, 1904, the day the diocese was erected. He died in office. Bishop Stang High School was named in his memory.\n\nOn July 2, 1907, Father Daniel Feehan was appointed Bishop of Fall River. Ordained a bishop on September 19, 1907, by Bishop Thomas Daniel Beaven, he served until incapacitation and died on July 19, 1934, in office. Bishop Feehan High School was named in his honor.\n\nFeehan was succeeded by James E. Cassidy, his Coadjutor Bishop and Vicar General for many years. In 1945 Bishop Cassidy received the assistance of a Coadjutor Bishop, the Most Reverend James L. Connolly, who would later succeed him. Bishop Cassidy High School, now known as Coyle and Cassidy High School, was named in his honor.\n\nBishop James Louis Connolly was born in Fall River in 1894 and graduated from B. M. C. Durfee High School in 1913. \n\nIn 1945, he was named Coadjutor Bishop of Fall River.\n\nFollowing the death of Cassidy, Connolly became Bishop of Fall River in May 1951. One key to his tenure as Bishop was a special concern with providing secondary education in the four urban areas of the Diocese. As a result, four Catholic high schools were constructed under his guidance. Bishop Connolly High School was dedicated in his name in 1967. He also founded the diocesan newspaper, \"The Anchor\". Connolly attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council. He served as Bishop of Fall River until 1970 when he retired. \n\nIn the early 1990s, revelations surfaced about how the Diocese of Fall River protected former priest James Porter from being potential sex abuse charges in between 1960 and 1964. After being transferred to St. Mary's parochial grammar school in 1960, where he was charged with managing the school's altar boys, Porter gained a reputation there as a child molester, However, no action was taken against him by the Catholic Church until 1963, by which time at least four parents had complained to his superiors about his inappropriate behavior. Rather than contact the police, however, Church officials moved Porter to a parish in Fall River, where further complaints about his behavior surfaced. Despite being arrested as early as 1964 for sex abuse, all of his sex abuse charges only resulted in hospitalizations until he was jailed in Minnesota in 1992, which also happened many years after he left the priesthood to get married and start a family In the early 1960s, Porter abused more than 60 North Attleboro children, and nearly 100 in southeastern Massachusetts. In Massachusetts in 1993, Porter's lawyer struck a plea bargain, and Porter was sentenced to 18–20 years in prison, with the possibility of parole, with counseling, after six years. Parole was consistently denied for several years. He completed his prison sentence in 2004, but was held until his death pending a civil commitment hearing. In December 1993, then-Diocese of Fall River Bishop Sean O'Malley acknowledged the Diocese's protection of Porter and apologized.\n\nDaniel Anthony Cronin became the fifth Bishop in December 1970 upon the retirement of Bishop Connolly. Cronin continued the work of implementing the decrees of the Second Vatican Council and supported liturgical renewal, continuing education of the clergy and the restoration of the permanent diaconate. He devoted himself to the pastoral care of the sick in hospitals, to the expansion of Catholic Counseling and Social Services, to the Family Life Ministry and other various activities. Late in 1991 Pope John Paul II appointed Bishop Cronin Archbishop of Hartford.\n\nOn July 3, 2014, Bishop Edgar Moreira da Cunha, S.D.V., was announced as the eighth bishop of the Diocese of Fall River, and installed September 24. Edgar M. da Cunha was born in Nova Fatima, then part of the municipality of Riachão do Jacuípe, Brazil. He studied at the Universidade Catolica Fatima dos Salvados and was ordained a priest on March 27, 1982 by Bishop Joseph A. Francis, S.V.D. He was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark as well as titular bishop of Ucres on June 27, 2003 by John Paul II. da Cunha was consecrated an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Newark on September 3, 2003 as the only Brazilian-born bishop in the United States.\n\nIn addition to St. Mary's Cathedral, two other major churches in the diocese are St. Anthony of Padua in New Bedford, Santo Christo Church and Shrine, and St. Anne's both in Fall River.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1830287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830287", "title": "Jet Age", "text": "Jet Age\n\nThe Jet Age is a period in the history of aviation defined by the advent of aircraft powered by turbine engines, and by the social change this brought about.\n\nJet airliners were able to fly much higher, faster, and farther than older pistonpowered propliners, making transcontinental and intercontinental travel considerably faster and easier: for example, aircraft leaving North America and crossing the Atlantic Ocean (and later, the Pacific Ocean) could now fly to their destinations non-stop, making much of the world accessible within a single day's travel for the first time. Since large jetliners could also carry more passengers than piston-powered airliners, air fares also declined (relative to inflation), so people from a greater range of socioeconomic classes could afford to travel outside their own countries.\n\nBesides the pure jet, the turbine driven propeller engines offered improvements of the piston engine delivering a smoother ride and better fuel efficiency. One exception to jet-powered domination by large airliners was the contra-rotating propellers turboprop design that powered the Tu-114 (first flight 1957). This airliner was able to match or even exceed the speed, capacity and range of contemporary jets; however, the use of such powerplants in large airframes was totally restricted to the military after 1976.\n\nThe introduction of the Concorde supersonic transport (SST) airliner to regular service in 1976 was expected to bring similar social changes, but the aircraft never found commercial success. After two and a half decades of service, a fatal crash near Paris in July 2000 and other factors eventually caused Concorde flights to be discontinued in 2003. This was the only loss of an SST in civilian service. Only one other SST design was used in a civilian capacity, the Soviet era Tu-144, but it was soon withdrawn due to high maintenance and other issues. McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed and Boeing were three U.S. manufacturers that had originally planned to develop various SST designs since the 1960s, but these projects were eventually abandoned for various developmental, cost, and other practical reasons.\n\nThe term \"Jet Age\" was coined in the late 1940s. At the time, the only jet-powered aircraft in production were military types, most of which were fighters. The expression reflects the recognition that the jet engine had effected, or would soon, a profound change in aeronautics and aviation.\n\nOne view is that the jet age began with the invention of the jet engine in the 1930s and 1940s. In the history of military aviation it began in 1944 with the introduction into service of the Arado Ar 234 reconnaissance bomber and the Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter during World War II. In commercial aviation the jet age was introduced to Britain in 1952 with the first scheduled flight of the de Havilland Comet airliner and to America later in the decade with the first American-built jet airliners.\n\nThe British de Havilland Comet was the first jet airliner to fly (1949), the first in service (1952), and the first to offer a regular transatlantic service (1958). One hundred and fourteen of all versions were built. However, the first jet airliner to provide a sustained and dependable service was the Soviet Tupolev Tu-104 (201 built) which was the only jet airliner in operation worldwide between 1956 and 1958 (the Comet having been withdrawn in 1954 due to structural failure issues). The Comet and Tu-104 were later outstripped in production by the American Boeing 707 (which entered service in 1958) and Douglas DC-8, which joined it in the skies over the next few years. Other types of the period included the French Sud Aviation Caravelle.\n\nWhen the Boeing 707 began service on the New York to London route in 1958, this became the first year that more trans-Atlantic passengers traveled by air than by ship.\n\nAs the number of passengers soared, it became impractical to increase the number of aircraft flying from the major hub airports. International airports like that of Orly Airport in Paris, France would construct terminals around bag-check and customs processing efficiency in response to rising passenger numbers. Instead, designers created even larger widebody airliners and the engine manufacturers responded with larger, more powerful and also more fuel-efficient engines. The first \"jumbo jet\" was the Boeing 747, and it both increased airport passenger capacity and reduced the cost of air travel, further accelerating the social changes brought about by the Jet Age.\n\nMilitary aviation had entered the jet age somewhat earlier, during the closing stages of World War II. In the early postwar years, the increasing use of jet aircraft had little significant impact, serving mainly to continue the slow but steady improvements in performance seen in the past. Supersonic flight brought about a step change in aircraft performance. The Bell X-1, first to break the sound barrier in level flight, was an experimental rocket-powered type, and production jets which followed it into service could fly little faster. The first jet aircraft designed from the outset for supersonic flight was the British Fairey Delta 2. On March 10, 1956 it became the first aircraft to fly faster than 1,000 miles per hour, heralding an era of \"fast jets\" typically limited to a speed of Mach 2.2 by the engineering materials available. As jets became faster, their armament changed from guns to missiles. Avionics systems became more complex with radar, fire-control and other systems. Aircraft became larger and more expensive, and so were required to do more to make them economical. All this profoundly affected the nature of military strategy during the Cold War.\n\n"}

While performing the line \"\"you was a ballerina/ I got the pictures I seen ya\"\" a photograph of Prodigy, as a child, dressed in ballet clothes, appeared on the large screen. Aside from its role in the Jay-Z & Nas feud, Takeover was largely seen as damaging to Prodigy (and Mobb Deep's) careers.\n\nIn the second verse, Jay Z alleges that Prodigy (member of Mobb Deep) took ballet classes as a child and mocks Prodigy's small stature. Jay-Z further dismisses Mobb Deep as competition in the hip hop industry by pointing out that his career had more commercial success than they ever would, and dissing Mobb Deep's famous song \"Shook Ones Pt.

Mobb Deep replied to Jay Z in a subsequent LP diss track, but their rivalry has more or less been overshadowed by the rivalry between Nas and Jay Z.\n\nIn the third verse (which has 32 bars, while the other verses have 16), Jay Z ridicules Nas's discography (at the time consisting of four albums) and claims Nas has a \"one hot album every ten year average.\" Jay-Z referred to a widespread feeling from many hip hop critics and artists that Nas's subsequent albums after his legendary \"Illmatic\" debut were mediocre follow ups, and dissed Nas' famous song from that album \"The World Is Yours\". Jay Z sampled some of Nas' lines for the chorus of Jay Z's famous song \"Dead Presidents II\", and claimed in \"Takeover\" that he sampled it because Nas was using it wrong (\"So yeah I sampled your voice, you was usin' it wrong/\nYou made it a hot line, I made it a hot song\"). Jay Z also questions Nas's street credibility and claims Nas has lied or exaggerated about his past in songs, with the lines, \"Nigga, you ain't live it you witnessed from your folks' pad/Scribbled in your notepad and created your life/I showed you your first tec, on tour with Large Professor (Me! That's who!)/Then I heard your album 'bout your tec on your dresser.\"(This is a reference to the Illmatic song \"Represent\"). Jay Z also ridicules Nas's style, flow, and career decisions, with lyrics like, \"Nigga switch up your flow, your shit is garbage/What you trying to kick knowledge? (Get the fuck outta here)\" and \"Fell from top ten to not mentioned at all/To your bodyguard's Oochie Wally verse better than yours/Matter fact you had the worst flow in the whole fuckin' song...\" which \"Oochie Wally\" is a song by The Bravehearts from the collaborative album QB's Finest, and samples the song in this song when Jay-Z mentions it.\n\nThe song initiated one of the biggest and most hyped hip hop rivalries within the industry, and the song was generally well received by fans. At the time, the song's hard-hitting caliber was such that Jay-Z and many hip hop fans had felt that this song could have potentially ended Nas's career. On the contrary, however, the track merely served to reinvigorate Nas' career as he responded to \"Takeover\" with a diss track of his own, entitled \"Ether\".\n\nJay-Z responded to \"Ether\" with a freestyle entitled \"Supa Ugly\". Jay-Z and Nas would release other subsequent diss tracks and records referencing the feud, including \"Blueprint 2\" (from Jay Z's \"\") and \"Last Real Nigga Alive\" (from Nas's \"God's Son\".)\n\n\"Takeover\" was produced by Kanye West and samples The Doors' \"Five to One\" as well as \"Sound of da Police\" by KRS-One. 50 Cent swards Mobb Deep in his own diss song \"Piggy Bank\", by telling his rival Jadakiss \"Jada don't fuck with me if you wanna eat, 'cause I'll do your lil' ass like Jay did Mobb Deep.\" Coincidentally, 50 signed Mobb Deep to his G-Unit Records imprint a mere few months later.\n\nOn Mos Def's 2004 album \"The New Danger\", the track \"The Rape Over\" is essentially a revision of \"Takeover\", with a similar Kanye West backing track using the same Doors sample. Mos Def's rewritten lyrics criticize the hip-hop industry in general and attribute hip-hop's direction at the time to \"old white men\", \"corporate forces\", and substance abuse.\n\nChicago pop-rock band Fall Out Boy referenced this song in their 2007 album \"Infinity on High\" with the song \"The Take Over, the Breaks Over\" as a direct mention to the rivalry.\n\nIn 2007 Mistah F.A.B. used the beat from the track on his Royce da 5'9\" diss track entitled \"C.I.A.\"\n\n\"Takeover\" appeared at 51 on Pitchfork's The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s.

A car fanatic since he was a boy, he wrote letters to Mini designer Alec Issigonis asking how to become a car designer and received kindly and encouraging replies. He studied Engineering at the University of Liverpool before graduating with a master's degree in vehicle design from the Royal College of Art in London.\n\nHaving begun his career at Porsche in 1973 which also included a short stint working on commercial vehicles for Ogle Design in Letchworth, Smith moved to Audi in 1977, then briefly to BMW only to return to Audi where he would remain for the majority of the 1980s and 1990s. At Audi he transformed the mundane Audi Coupe into the legendary Audi Quattro and subsequently became Head of Audi's Munich Design Studio. He helped introduce a slippery aerodynamic look and austere functional cockpits to the Audi range as evidenced by the 1982 Audi 100 and 1986 Audi 80. Whilst in charge of the Audi Munich Design Studio, he worked with J Mays on the 1991 Audi Avus Quattro concept car which previewed a geometrical style as well as the extensive use of aluminium. His last position at Audi was the Head of Interior Design where he oversaw and developed the first generation Audi TT interior.\nIn 1997 he moved to Opel as Design Director for compact cars, working on the Opel Speedster and the 2004 Astra. In 2002 he became Executive Design Director for Opel responsible for the design of the entire product line-up and where he realigned Opel design from the inoffensive but bland of the 1990s to a more dynamic direction in line with his 2004 Opel Trixx, Opel Astra, Insignia concept and Vauxhall VX Lightning. Under his guidance, this new direction influenced the whole Opel range including the 2004 Opel Tigra TwinTop, 2005 Opel Zafira, 2005 facelift of the Opel Vectra/Opel Signum, the 2006 Opel Corsa, and 2007 Opel Antara.\nIn 2004 Ford's European Design staff underwent a comprehensive reorganisation, the first step coming in July 2004 seeing Smith lured from Opel to become Executive Design Director for Ford of Europe, where he reports to the Ford global group Vice President for Design, former colleague J Mays. This was quickly followed by fellow Opel refugee Stefan Lamm joining in autumn 2004 as Chief Designer for Exteriors at Ford. Smith was also reunited with another former colleague, Chris Bird, who moved to Ford as Design Director from Audi in 1998. This reorganised staff quickly made its aims clear: to move Ford of Europe design its New Edge design philosophy towards the ethos of 'Kinetic Design' which roughly translates to 'Energy in Motion', a language that consists of clean angles and complex surfacing to give Fords a sportier, more dynamic, exciting look. This language was first implemented by Smith and his team on the Ford SAV Concept, and has progressively been developed in a series of other concepts including the Ford Iosis, Iosis X and Verve concepts. These designs, or at least elements of these designs, have increasingly been adopted on production models, with the 2006 Ford S-MAX, 2006 Ford Galaxy, 2007 Ford Mondeo, and 2008 Ford Kuga all designed within the Kinetic Design paradigm. Under Smith's leadership, the Ford of Europe design team rolled out Kinetic Design onto numerous models including: the 2007 Ford C-MAX Facelift, 2008 Ford Focus Facelift, 2008 Ford Fiesta, 2008 Ford Ka, 2009 Ford C-MAX, and 2012 Ford B-MAX. In line with the One Ford strategy, Smith and his team were given lead responsibility for the global 2010 Ford Focus, whilst also supporting the development of the 2013 Ford Fusion and 2014 Ford Mondeo. In addition to his responsibilities at Ford of Europe; Smith has since May 2006 also been responsible for overseeing vehicle design in the Australian, Chinese and Asia-Pacific markets, with the task of giving the line-up a more consistent look.\n\nIn May 2014 it was announced that Smith would be stepping down as Executive Design Director for Ford of Europe in July 2014, to be succeeded by Joel Piaskowski, before retiring completely from Ford in December 2014. In his last 6 months of Ford he worked on a global project studying the future direction of Ford design, working closely with Moray Callum, vice president, Design, Ford Motor Company.\n\n"}

The family were temporarily domiciled at Drumdowney while their new mansion at Bellevue, near Waterford was under construction.\n\nHis father was Edward Sheil, who had acquired considerable wealth in Cadiz in southern Spain and owned an estate in Tipperary. His mother was Catherine McCarthy of Springhouse, near Bansha, County Tipperary, a member of the old aristocratic family of MacCarthy Reagh of Springhouse, who in their time were Princes of Carbery and Counts of Toulouse in France. The son was taught French and Latin by the Abbé de Grimeau, a French refugee. He was then sent to a Catholic school in Kensington, London, presided over by a French nobleman, M. de Broglie. \nFor a time he attended the lay college in St Patrick's College, Maynooth.\nIn October 1804 he was removed to Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, and in November 1807 entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he specially distinguished himself in the debates of the Historical Society.\n\nAfter taking his degree in 1811 he was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the Irish bar in 1814. In 1816, he married a Miss O’Halloran, niece of Sir William McMahon, master of the rolls. They had one son, who predeceased Sheil. His wife died in January 1822.\n\nHis play of \"Adelaide, or the Emigrants\", was played at the Crow Street Theatre, Dublin, on 19 February 1814, with success, and on 23 May 1816 it was performed at Covent Garden. \"The Apostate\", produced at the latter theatre on 3 May 1817, established his reputation as a dramatist. His principal other plays are \"Bellamira\" (written in 1818), \"Evadne\" (1819), \"Huguenot\", produced in 1822, and \"Montini\" (1820).\n\nIn 1822 he began, along with W. H. Curran, to contribute to the \"New Monthly Magazine\" a\nseries of papers entitled \"Sketches of the Irish Bar\". These were edited by Marmion Wilme Savage in 1855 in two volumes, under the title of \"Sketches Legal and Political\". Sheil was one of the founders of the Catholic Association in 1823 and drew up the petition for inquiry into the mode of administering the laws in Ireland, which was presented in that year to both Houses of Parliament.\n\nIn 1825 Sheil accompanied O'Connell to London to protest against the suppression of the Catholic Association. The protest was unsuccessful, but, although nominally dissolved, the association continued its propaganda after the defeat of the Catholic Relief Bill in 1825; and Sheil was one of O'Connell's leading supporters in the agitation persistently carried on until Catholic emancipation was granted in 1829. In July 1830 he married Anastasia Lalor Power, a widow. He then added the name Lalor.\n\nIn the same year he was returned to Parliament for Milborne Port, and in 1831 for Louth, holding that seat until 1832. He took a prominent part in all the debates relating to Ireland, and although he was greater as a platform orator than as a debater, he gradually won the somewhat reluctant admiration of the House. In August 1839 he became Vice-President of the Board of Trade in Lord Melbourne's ministry.\n\nAfter the accession of Lord John Russell to power in 1846 he was appointed master of the Mint, and in 1850 he was appointed minister at the court of Tuscany. He died at Florence on 23 May 1851. His remains were conveyed back to Ireland by a British ship-of-war, and interred at Long Orchard, near Templetuohy, County Tipperary.\n\nSee \"Memoirs of Richard Lalor Sheil\", by W Torrens McCullagh (2 vols, 1855). His \"Speeches\" were edited in 1845 by Thomas McNevin.\n\nGeorge W. E. Russell said of him:Sheil was very small, and of mean presence; with a singularly fidgety manner, a shrill voice, and a delivery unintelligibly rapid. But in sheer beauty of elaborated diction not O'Connell nor any one else could surpass him.\n\n\n"}

Its plot revolves around a young pizza driver from New York City, who inherits a trillion US dollars from one of his ancestors who lived in 16th century Florence. With the money comes a prophecy that he must use it to give humanity back its lost future.\n\nThe title is correctly translated into English as \"One Trillion Dollars\", as it refers to the long scale use of the word billion (10), which is called a trillion in the short scale.\n\nJohn Salvatore Fontanelli, the son of a shoemaker in New York who works as a pizza driver, is one day invited to the Waldorf Astoria by an Italian lawyer, where he is informed that he inherited a huge fortune simply by being the last male descendant of a wealthy Italian merchant living and working in 16th century Florence. This merchant put a rather small amount of money in a bank account some 500 years ago. Through the magic of compound interest, this sum has now grown into the equivalent of roughly 1,000,000,000,000 US dollars.\n\nIn one fell swoop, John Fontanelli has become by far the richest person in the world, his net worth being bigger than the GDP of most countries. Yet, his ancestor has charged his heir with the task of using the inheritance \"to give back mankind its lost future\".\n\nAfter some hither and thither, he accepts the role assigned to him by his ancestor and tries to better the world socially and ecologically. On the advice of his mysterious new consultant, Malcolm McCaine, he founds a huge corporation called Fontanelli Enterprises and strategically invests the inherited fortune in a diversified group of projects to grow his power and influence. Starting with the hostile takeover of ExxonMobil, John Fontanelli's orders now decide the fate of other companies, currencies, and even complete countries' economies.\n\nWith the passing of time, John recognizes that all this will not ultimately lead him to success in mastering his assigned task. To get a better picture of the future development of mankind, he sets up a gigantic and secret scientific project, which uses complex computer models to simulate different future scenarios. When the sobering result is finally announced, Fontanelli and McCaine differ about the correct approach to save humanity from its obvious self-destroying development. McCaine leaves Fontanelli, thinking that mankind is doomed to being minimized down to a small but qualified elite. By using his own money, he sets up another company and tries to entice away leading scientists in the research of the AIDS virus to withdraw their manpower from the development of an effective cure.\n\nFontanelli, on the other side, is setting up a foundation to organize and enforce the election of a \"world speaker\". In his belief, the multi-national companies can only be controlled by global laws to prevent a catastrophe. The opposing and contradictory strategies of Fontanelli and McCaine to save humanity from its disastrous fate culminate in an exacerbated struggle for power. Fontanelli achieves a partial victory: The election of a \"world speaker\" finally takes place.\n\nThe book ends with the death of John Fontanelli, who gets shot by an old friend who gradually came under the influence of McCaine.\n\nIt would be theoretically possible to build up a fortune as described in the book. The initial investment of 300 Florin, assuming an equivalent of 10,000 US-Dollars and an annual interest rate of 4%, would have grown to roughly $1 trillion in the 470 years mentioned in the novel.\n\nHowever, there are certain factors that would render it probably impossible under realistic conditions. Most of the capital appreciation would only happen during the later years of the process. In a time span of 500 years, there would be a great probability of catastrophic events like hyperinflation or even a national bankruptcy which could potentially wipe out the entire investment. But since the capital was spread across various banks in numerous countries at an early point, it is unlikely that it would wipe out the entire fortune. Member of the Vacchi family: \"While there were some setbacks, we managed to achieve the average interest rate of 4% a year.\"\n\nOther possible causes for complete or partial loss of the money include theft and embezzlement. The lack of these, however, can be explained by the Vacchi family's faith that they are performing a sacred task, this also explains why they would continue said task even though the compensation was insubstantial for some decades.\n\n\n\nThe novel was adapted as a 4-part radio play in 2003 by German radio station Südwestrundfunk.\n\n"}

The Office of the Chief Legislative Liaison (United States Army) (OCLL) operates directly under the Office of the Secretary of the Army. Its mission is to coordinate efforts between the US Army and Congress. Prior to his assignment with the OCLL, he was the first commanding general of the Joint Force Headquarters National Capital Region (JFHQ-NCR), a dual-hatted role combined with commanding the Military District of Washington (MDW).\n\nAfter his retirement from the U.S. Army, Jackman was hired in October 2008 by Raytheon Company, a Massachusetts-based defense contractor, as the vice-president over U.S. Army Programs, U.S. Business Development. \n\nJackman may be best known for his role during the seven days in June 2004 that marked the death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan. As the then-commanding general of the MDW (CG MDW), he became a known figure when he escorted former First Lady Nancy Reagan, the former president's wife.\n\nJackman was born in August 1951 in Scottsbluff, Nebraska and is one of at least three children born to Virgil and Maxine Jackman. At the time of his birth, Jackman's parents lived in the nearby city of Gering, where the family lived until they moved to Nebraska's capital, Lincoln, in 1965. Jackman graduated from Lincoln East High School in 1969.\n\nJackman attended the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on an Army ROTC scholarship. While at the University he became an active member of the National Society of Pershing Rifles, an ROTC military fraternal organization known for including many who later became successful Army officers. Upon graduation he was commissioned into active duty in the U.S. Army in June 1973. His first duty assignment was with the 1st Battalion (ABN) 508th Infantry, 82nd Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he served as a rifle platoon leader, anti-tank platoon leader, company executive officer, and battalion adjutant. He next served with the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry, 25th Infantry Division, Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, as a battalion S4, rifle company commander, and battalion S3. Following assignment as a Procurement Officer with the United States Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, he served at Fort Bragg as Procurement Officer, Squadron Executive Officer, and Support Squadron Commander in 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (Airborne) (1st SFOD-D(A)), more commonly known as \"Delta Force.\"\nJackman has commanded the 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry, 25th Infantry Division (Light); 2nd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division (Light), Fort Ord, California; and the Ranger Training Brigade, Fort Benning, Georgia. It was under then-Colonel Jackman's command at the Ranger Training Brigade that four Ranger Candidates were killed in training on February 15, 1995 in the Florida swamps of Eglin Air Force Base. Killed were Captain Milton Palmer, Second Lieutenant Curt G. Sansoucie, Second Lieutenant Spencer D. Dodge, and Sergeant Norman Tillman. It was reported to be the worst incident in the Ranger School's 44-year history . Multiple accounts held the leadership climate, both at the command level and at the trainer level, responsible for the multiple errors that led to the training accident and deaths. Among the reasons named for the deaths include the command's lack of a proper risk assessment of the weather conditions surrounding the exercise before it took place and the Ranger trainers' decision to continue with the exercise despite poor training conditions and high water dangers. As a result of the accident, the Ranger School's command changed swamp training to include more food and sleep for trainees and now require trainers to go into potentially high water before their trainees do. No evidence exists to suggest that Jackman suffered any career-related consequences due to the incident.\nFollowing his command at the Ranger Training Brigade, Jackman served as the Director of Combined Arms and Tactics at the United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, as well as the Deputy J3 for Training and Readiness, United States Pacific Command (USPACOM), Hawaii. He was then assigned as Chief of Staff, 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry), Fort Drum, New York, during which he participated as part of NATO's \"Follow-on Force\" in Operation Joint Forge, Bosnia-Herzegovina. Shortly thereafter he was made Assistant Division Commander for Support for the 10th Mountain Division.\n\nJackman served as Director of Operations, United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) from 2001–2003, concentrating mostly on anti-drug and anti-terrorism endeavours. He took command of the MDW in mid-2003 and subsequently the JFHQ-NCR in late 2004 at its official inception. While in this dual command capacity, Jackman organized the proceedings and security for the dedication of the World War II Memorial on the National Mall and its accompanying WWII reunion, organized former President Ronald Reagan's state funeral, served as the official escort to the former President's wife, former First Lady Nancy Reagan, and served as commander of the Joint Task Force-Armed Forces Inaugural Committee for President George W. Bush's 2005 Presidential Inauguration. Jackman was assigned as the Army's Chief of Legislative Liaison on July 21, 2005. He retired from that position, and the U.S. Army after 35 years of service, in July 2008.\n\nIn 1982 Jackman married Cathy (née Dowd), herself the daughter of a retired Army officer. Cathy Jackman is originally from Fayetteville, North Carolina and is a 1970 graduate of Terry Sanford High School. The Jackmans have two sons, David and Patrick. David Jackman is a graduate of Guilford College in Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\nJackman graduated from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln in 1973 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History. After entering the U.S. Army in June, he completed the three-month Infantry Officer Basic Course, United States Army Infantry School, Fort Benning, Georgia, towards the end of 1973. He later completed the six-month Infantry Officer Advanced Course, also at the United States Army Infantry School, in 1978. In 1983, Jackman graduated after attending the US Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas after nearly a year of study. That same year, he earned a Masters of Science degree in Acquisition/Procurement and Contract Management from the Florida Institute of Technology.

{"id": "1830319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830319", "title": "Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew", "text": "Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew\n\nThe Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew is a part of the New Testament apocrypha, and sometimes goes by the name of The Infancy Gospel of Matthew, but the actual name of the text in antiquity was The Book About the Origin of the Blessed Mary and the Childhood of the Savior. Pseudo-Matthew is one of a genre of \"Infancy gospels\" that seek to fill out the details of the life of Jesus of Nazareth up to the age of 12, which are briefly given in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. In the West, it was the dominant source for pictorial cycles of the Life of Mary, especially before the late Middle Ages. According to the research of J. Gijsel / R. Beyers (1997) the archetype of the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthews Recensio-α dates to 800 AD and the composition date to the first half of the seventh century, maybe to around 600 and 625 AD. Gijsel furthermore points out that Joachims representation in Pseudo-Matthews is meant to evoke the model figure of a Merowingian nobleman, this one, according to Gijsel, being Dagobert I during his reign (629-639). According to Berthold, the composition date of the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew is around 650 AD at the earliest, due to the fact that it \"shows literary dependence on Vita Agnetis of Pseudo-Ambrose\", which itself was used in De Virginitate in 690 AD. According to G. Schneider the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthews was composed in the 8th- or 9th century during the Carolingian dynasty. Pseudo-Matthew shares many similarities with, and likely used as sources, the apocryphal Gospel of James and Infancy Gospel of Thomas.\n\nThe narrative is prefaced by a series of letters between the early Church father Jerome and the Bishops Comatius and Heliodorus. In these letters the Bishops request that Jerome translate a \"Hebrew volume, written by the hand of the most blessed Evangelist Matthew,\" concerning the birth of the virgin mother and the infancy of Jesus. Though the work is attributed to St. Jerome, it is unlikely that St. Jerome actually wrote or translated it: \"no one who is acquainted with the style of Jerome's letters will think this one authentic.\"\n\nThe author of the pseudo-Jerome letter claims he compiled and translated the work, taking care to \"render it word for word, exactly as it is in the Hebrew, since it is asserted that it was composed by the holy Evangelist Matthew, and written at the head of his Gospel,\" though he expressed doubt as to their authenticity.\n\nThe first half of the narrative tells the story of St. Joachim and St. Anne, the parents of Mary; Joachim's sorrow and persecution on account of their lack of progeny, his exile and return to Anna with child, and the birth of Mary; her entering service as a temple virgin, her prayerful life and vow of chastity, and the choosing of Joseph as her husband and guardian upon her becoming too old to continue as a temple virgin; the Annunciation; Joseph's distress at finding her pregnant, and his eventual acceptance of her honesty; his and Mary's being tested in the temple, and the acceptance of the people in the temple of Mary's and Joseph's innocence.\n\nThe content of the text is primarily an edited reproduction of the Protevangelium of James, followed by an account of the Flight into Egypt (it is not known on what this is based), and subsequently an edited reproduction of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas. Essentially, it is a (fairly successful) attempt to merge these texts into a single work. To its sources, the Gospel adds the first known mention of an ox and a donkey being present at the nativity of Jesus. The work also helped popularize the image of a very young Mary and relatively old Joseph from the Gospel of James.\n\nIt had a strong influence in medieval thought, partly due to its inclusion in the Golden Legend. One of the consequences of this is the creation of derivative works, such as the Libellus de Nativitate Sanctae Mariae (), which consists of just the early part of the text concerning the birth of Mary. Another text to be based on Pseudo Matthew is the Syriac Infancy Gospel, which includes many supernatural embellishments.\n\nEvents described in the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew inspired \"The Cherry-Tree Carol\".\n\n\n"}

Therefore, the second ship, MV \"Galaxy\", was given a longer hull compared to the \"Century\", and the galley and pantry areas were completely redesigned.\n\nThe keel of the \"Galaxy\" was laid on 25 May 1995, she was launched from drydock in May 1996 and delivered to Celebrity Cruises on 10 October 1996. Following a promotional visit to Southampton, the ship sailed across the Atlantic Ocean without passengers. Further promotional visits in Boston, Philadelphia and Port Canaveral followed, after which the ship sailed to Port Everglades to begin her commercial career with Celebrity Cruises.\n\n\"Galaxy\" entered service with Celebrity Cruises on 21 December 1996 on a week-long cruise from Port Everglades to the Caribbean. Alongside her near-sister ship \"Century\" she operated week-long alternating western and eastern Caribbean cruises. During the 1997 northern hemisphere summer season the \"Galaxy\" relocated to the west coast of North America to operate week-long cruises to Alaska from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This pattern was repeated from 1997 up until 2000.\n\nIn 1998, \"Galaxy\" was the setting of BBC television's docusoap \"The Cruise\", which made Jane McDonald famous.\n\nFor the 2001 summer season, \"Galaxy\" was replaced by the brand-new in the Alaskan service. As a result, \"Galaxy\" was relocated into European waters, cruising the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. On 2 June 2001, while departing Amsterdam in the Netherlands for a two-week cruise the \"Galaxy\" touched bottom on an outskirt of Forteiland at IJmuiden due to heavy northwesterly squalls, resulting in major damage to the port side propeller. The ship returned to the Port of Amsterdam for inspection and disembarkation of the passengers. The cruise had to be cancelled as the \"Galaxy\" went into drydock at Blohm + Voss in Hamburg, Germany. There it was discovered that all four blades of the port side propeller would have to be replaced; however the ship only carried two spare blades on board. To solve the problem two extra propeller blades carried on board \"Galaxy\"s sister ship MV \"Mercury\" were flown from the Caribbean to Hamburg and installed on the \"Galaxy\". Following repairs the ship re-entered service on 16 June 2001.\n\nFor the 2002 and 2003 summer seasons the \"Galaxy\" was based in Baltimore, making 10- and 11-day cruises to the Caribbean.\n\nOn May 21, 2004 the \"Galaxy\" berthed at Civitavecchia (Rome) and began its series of summer voyages in the Mediterranean. The \"Galaxy\" made multiple transatlantic crossings during the fall and winter seasons to take advantage of the Caribbean's tropical climate.\n\nIn February 2008 the \"Galaxy\" was renamed \"Celebrity Galaxy\" to comply with Celebrity Cruises' new naming scheme.\n\nIn April 2008 Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the parent company of Celebrity Cruises, announced that the \"Celebrity Galaxy\" would cease service with Celebrity in March 2009 and subsequently be transferred to the fleet of TUI Cruises, a joint subsidiary of Royal Caribbean Cruises and TUI AG aimed at the German cruise market.\n\nFollowing withdrawal from Celebrity Cruises' service, the ship sailed to the Lloyd Werft shipyard in Bremerhaven, Germany where she received a € 50 million refit to modernise her facilities and cabins to make her better suited for the needs of the German market. Additional cabins were also fitted on existing outside cabins. Following the 38-day refit the ship was renamed \"Mein Schiff\" in Hamburg on 15 May 2009, and she entered service with TUI Cruises on a Baltic Sea cruise starting from Kiel on 23 May 2009.\n\nIn August 10, 2014, the 76 meter long service supply vessel Princess Marseilles struck the \"Mein Schiff 1\" in the port of Bergen, Norway. The \"Mein Schiff 1\" sustained minimal damage.\n\nIn the evening of October 12, 2014, around 9 p.m. a fire broke out in the incinerator on deck 3 while the cruise ship was en route from Barcelona to Palma de Mallorca with more than 2000 passengers. The crew was able to extinguish the fire within short time, and the ship docked as scheduled at Palma in the morning of October 13. The message \"Bravo, Bravo, Bravo, Fire in the Garbage\" could accidentally be heard from the PA system. Some minutes later the master Rolf Johannes Noack notified the passengers about the incident. The show in the Theater had been interrupted until the fire was out. The passengers had remained calm. In May 2015, TUI Group announced that as part of their modernization strategy, TUI Cruises' Mein Schiff 1 and Mein Schiff 2 would be transferred to Thomson Cruises over the next few years.\n\nIn March 2017, it was announced that the ship would join the Marella Fleet in May 2018 and would be renamed TUI Explorer\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that the ship will start operating under the company's new brand name Marella Explorer, after a Yard Refit in Cadiz.\n\nIn 2018, \"Marella Explorer\" underwent a 4-week, multi-million-pound makeover.\n\nThe primary dining area on board the \"Marella Explorer\" can host 1,088 diners on a single seating, and is decorated in the art deco style utilized on ocean liners from the 1930s onwards.\n\n\n"}

The heat from the welding process and subsequent re-cooling causes this change from the weld interface to the termination of the sensitizing temperature in the base metal. The extent and magnitude of property change depends primarily on the base material, the weld filler metal, and the amount and concentration of heat input by the welding process.\n\nThe thermal diffusivity of the base material plays a large role—if the diffusivity is high, the material cooling rate is high and the HAZ is relatively small. Alternatively, a low diffusivity leads to slower cooling and a larger HAZ. The amount of heat input during the welding process also plays an important role as well, as processes like oxyfuel welding use high heat input and increase the size of the HAZ. Processes like laser beam welding and electron beam welding give a highly concentrated, limited amount of heat, resulting in a small HAZ. Arc welding falls between these two extremes, with the individual processes varying somewhat in heat input. To calculate the heat input for arc welding procedures, the following formula is used:\n\nwhere \"Q\" = heat input (kJ/mm), \"V\" = voltage (V), \"I\" = current (A), and \"S\" = welding speed (mm/min). The efficiency is dependent on the welding process used, with gas tungsten arc welding having a value of 0.6, shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding having a value of 0.8, and submerged arc welding 1.0.\n\n"}

It is located in the West Herzegovina Canton, a federal unit of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThe name Posušje is derived from \"suša\" (the Bosnian and Croatian word for drought). The area of Posušje was historically a dry area with water-supply problems. The problem was solved by building an artificial lake in Tribistovo in 1989.\n\nThe last census conducted in 2013 placed the population of the Posušje town at 6,000 residents.\n\nPosušje is 29 km from Široki Brijeg, 54 km from Mostar,10 km from Imotski and 71 km from Makarska.\n\nPosušje field is located at an altitude of about 610 m, Vir field at about 520 m, Rakitno at about 900 m, Pločno (peak of Čvrsnica mountain) is at 2228 m, and the area around the lake Blidinje 1050 meters and more.\n\nThere has been settlement in the area since pre-Slavic times when the Illyrians inhabited the region.\n\nFrom the older (Paleolithic) and middle (Mesolithic) periods of Stone Age, the period of primitive man hunter and wild berries collector, in the area of Posušje municipality were not found traces of human beings.\n\nIn the early period (Neolithic) stone age in southern Europe the way of human life significantly changed became a farmer and cattleman, built a permanent settlement, and was making ceramics. From this period, from his older sub-period, in the municipality Posušje, there are remains a human beings from sites Vučje Njive (Wolves fields), Iličinova Lazina, Prataruša and Žukovia cave in Vir.\nIn the younger Neolithic in this region has dominated Hvar-lisičić culture .Its remainings in the area of the municipality Posušje were found in localities: Brig next Bagaruša, Mostina (Batin), Sridnji Brig (Gradac), Central (Gradac and Vrijovički brig (Gradac). In Copper age (2400–1800 BC ), there was prevailing \"stringy ceramics\" so-Herzegovina, belonging to such sites: Nečajno and Trostruka gradina (triple fort) between Posušje and Grude.\n\nDissolution of the Neolithic groups and the beginning of the new groups, the metal age in this region is, caused primarily by great migration of Indo-Europeans that took place in the last centuries of 3rd and beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. This great migration, like the other before and later, also happened in steps, and her third and last step, completed the occupation of the area between the Sava and the Adriatic Sea. From then on the immigrant culture and indigenous people mix, new types of settlements, ruins, and very closed communities are being created. As a typical example of such a Bronze Age culture, is set aside, in this region, the dominant \"Cetina culture\" mostly in central Dalmatia, and in some segments quite similar to her \"Posušje culture\", mainly by widespread Herzegovina, central and northern part of Dalmatia.\n\nIron Age (8th century BC – 9 years AD) is the genesis completion time and the time of Illyrian tribes and communities forming, their touches via trade with Apennine Peninsula, the Greeks, and a number of bloody wars with the Romans. Municipality Posušje certainly belonged to the Illyrian tribe Dalmatae. Dalmatae were very warlike and livestock people, and in a series of wars during the 2nd and 1st century BC, gave the huge resistance to the great Roman state. Neither large Gaius Julius Caesar did not succeed to defeat them. It succeeded, after great difficulty, and thousands of casualties, the first Roman emperor Octavian Augustus. Roman impression by Dalmatae caused them later to name the whole province, much higher than territory of Dalmatae, after them (\"Dalmatia\") .\n\nFrom the Iron Age in the Posušje municipality area there is a huge number of ruins, the typical settlement of Dalmatae and over today Posušje and Vir field is considered to be an important trade route went from the commercial port Narona (Vid near Metković) to the town of Delminium (today Tomislavgrad in Duvno field), the main center of Illyric tribes. The money, \"drachma Dyrahija\", found in Vir, supports this theory.Prominent archaeologist Zdravko Marić claimed that the Vir is one of the most important cultural sites in the territory of Dalmatae. Another prominent archaeologist Borivoj Čović has classified the area of Posušje in the \"central Illyrian territory.\"\n\nRomans, after the occupation of this area, have been developing villages near the former Illyrian settlements. Settlements have been connected with its famous roads whose rare remains are today still visible in the municipality Posušje. Roman road Gradac - Tribistovo - Poklečani - Petrović has been documented as a verified safe route . On the other hand, archaeologists Ballif and Patsch claim that Vinjani were also an important road junction. A road direction from Vir, below Zavelim and towards Vinica and later towards Aržano, has been marked as a safe one.\n\nIn Roman times in the entire Posušje municipality area there were settlements, forts and cemeteries. Among the most important settlements was, most probably Gradac, where were two forts and settlement, the well-known late antique Christian basilica (4th-5th century), while in the area of Čitluk there was a Roman Villa Rustica. In the Čitluk area, near Orlov kuk, there has been also a Roman fort as well as in the Plišivica on Vinjani, while in the Vir such fort was on the site of Gradina above the Glavica. In Tribistovo have been found two Roman forts as well as in Sutina in Rakitno, while in Petrovići there were fort and basilica. In the area of Zagorje, however, there were found coins of the emperors Constantine I and Valens.\n\nIn the 7th century Croats appeared on the historical stage establishing their first principalities, mainly Tomislav, then King of the Kingdom of Croatia. The entire Posušje area at this time belonged to the Kingdom of Croatia, which among other things, is proved by the Old Croatian-style graves around the early Christian basilica in Gradac.\nIn later periods (the early and late Middle Ages), Posušje was predominately ruled by the noble family Nelipić from Sinj, with their rule being interchanged with the House of Kotromanić. The name Posušje is first mentioned in written document are 1378, in the parliaments description invited by Margareta, widow of the nobleman Ivan Nelipić who was owner of Posušje. Another mentioning of Posušje dates in 1403 in a document related to the commercial relations of Republic of Dubrovnik and Kingdom of Bosnia. It is important to note that in the third mentioning of Posušje was in the 1408, in the Charter of the Bosnian King Stjepan Ostoja where Posušje was called „župa“ (county, parish). Soon after, King Ostoja gave Radivojević Posušje. Later period are blamed to the weak kings of Bosnia and the powerful Croatian-Hungarian king Sigismund of Luxembourg. Feudal anarchy, torn apart by the Croatian regions, and the Ottomans rather easily at 1463 have conquered Bosnia.\nHerzegovina was conquered by the Ottoman Empire completely in 1482 with the battle of Herceg-Novi, but the year of Posušjes downfall is attributed to the Krbava battle in 1493. The last Posušje settlement and the last Herzegovina settlement conquered by Turks was Vir. The defenders of Vir had a chain of defence forts above Vir and managed to resist up to 1513.\n\nThe first mentioning of Herzegovina sanjak dates from one news from the end of February 1470. With Ottoman conquests the area of this sanjak has been spreading. This sanjak has been of Rumelia Eyalet until the 1580 when it was merged into the newly formed Pashalik of Bosnia and remained inside of it until 1833. Sanjaks were divided on smaller administration area :qadis and nahiyas. All the land in the area of Posušje has become the property of sultan who has been sharing it among his subordinated noblemen. The name Čitluk village dates from this period. Posušje area in the subsequent liberation wars in the 17th century, has become the border area between the Ottoman Empire and Venice, and as such had suffered a lot.\n\nIn 1878, after Herzegovinian rebellion against Turks in which people from Posušje have participated, the army of Austria-Hungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina. The army of Austria-Hungary was mostly composed of Croats and the Croatian generals Josip Filipović and Stjepan Jovanović led the invasion. Austria-Hungary established a protectorate and later in 1908 it annexed the country. Authorities of A-U were trying to improve the economy and literacy in the country. In the 1886/1887 it opened elementary school Rakitno in Poklečani. In 1903/04, a school in Vir started to work. Later, schools have also been opened in city of Posušje, Gradac and other places. Special legacy for education of the local people goes to fra Didak Buntić.\n\nIn 1918 Posušje has been included into the newly composed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In 1939, based on the Cvetković–Maček Agreement, Banovina of Croatia was formed, including the Posušje area. During NDH, 1941–1945, the area of the current municipality was divided between \"Great county of Hum\" and \"Great county of Pliva-Rama\".\n\nIn this area there are many cultural and historical monuments, among them being the old ruins from the Neolithic Age and the Illyrian, Roman fortress of Gradac, the remains of Roman roads, over 20 Latin inscriptions on stone, early Christian basilica of the 4th century, discovered and preserved 1971–1976. And almost every village, at least one stećci necropolis with a medieval tombstones.\n\nIn the Rastovača, near Posušje born fra Grgo Martić, a famous Franciscan and famous poet, who celebrated its avengers, consecration and memories. Renown was his protest, the Congress of Berlin read:\nIn the area of Posušje, was born also fra Petar Bakula, a tireless architect, writer and scientist. This clergeman wrote 27 works.\n\nIn the downtown of Posušje is placed a monument in a tribute to Croatian defenders of Posušje. On the road to Blidinje from the west side of town is a monument to 'Vlado the Builder', a mythical figure in Posušjian lore, renowned for his contributions to the local Prosciutto and Rakija culture.\n\nThe huge church in downtown of Posušje is named after Virgin Mary.\n\nIn Posušje there are lots of sport clubs.\nThere are clubs for most popular sports (football and basketball) . NK Posušje competes in Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina and KK Posušje The football fans from Posušje carry name \"Poskoci\" –after the most dangerous viper in the area (poskok-plural \"poskoci\"= Vipera ammodytes) as the word game with \"Posušje\".

Developed by Sir Hem Chandra Bose, Azizul Haque and Edward Henry in the late 19th century for criminal investigations in British India, it was the basis of modern-day AFIS (Automated Fingerprint Identification System) classification methods up until the 1990s. In recent years, the Henry Classification System has generally been replaced by ridge flow classification approaches.\n\nAlthough fingerprint characteristics were studied as far back as the mid-1600s, the use of fingerprints as a means of identification did not occur until the mid-19th century. In roughly 1859, Sir William James Herschel discovered that fingerprints remain stable over time and are unique across individuals; as Chief Magistrate of the Hooghly district in Jungipoor, India, in 1877 he was the first to institute the use of fingerprints and handprints as a means of identification, signing legal documents, and authenticating transactions. The fingerprint records collected at this time were used for one-to-one verification only; as a means in which records would be logically filed and searched had not yet been invented.\n\nIn 1880, Dr. Henry Faulds wrote to Charles Darwin, explaining a system for classifying fingerprints, asking for his assistance in their development. Darwin was unable to assist Dr. Faulds, but agreed to forward the letter to his cousin, Sir Francis Galton. Dr. Henry Faulds and Sir Francis Galton did not engage in much correspondence, but in the following decade, they devised very similar fingerprint classification systems. It is unclear whom to credit for the classification system. However, we do know that Dr. Henry Faulds was the first European to publish the notion of scientific use of fingerprints in the identification of criminals. In 1892, Sir Francis Galton published his highly influential book, \"Finger Prints\" in which he described his classification system that include three main fingerprint patterns - loops, whorls and arches.\n\nAt the time, the alternative to fingerprints was Bertillonage, also known as Anthropometry. Developed by Alphonse Bertillon in 1879, Bertillonage consists of a meticulous method of measuring body parts for the use of identifying criminals. In 1892, the British Indian police force adopted Anthropometry. Two years later, Sir Edward Henry, Inspector General of the Bengal Police in India became interested in the use of fingerprints for the use of criminal identification.\n\nInfluenced by Galton's \"Finger Prints\", the men corresponded regularly in 1894; and in January 1896, Sir Henry ordered the Bengali Police to collect prisoners’ fingerprints in addition to their anthropometric measurements. Expanding on Galton's classification system, Sir Henry developed the Henry Classification System between the years 1896 and 1925. He was primarily assisted by Azizul Haque who developed a mathematical formula to supplement Henry's idea of sorting in 1024 pigeon holes based on fingerprint patterns, and Hem Chandra Bose, another Henry's assistant also helped refine the system, and both, on the recommendation of Henry received recognition years later by the British Government for their contribution. The\nHenry Classification System was to find worldwide acceptance in 1899.\nIn 1897 a commission was established to compare Anthropometry to the Henry Classification System. As the results were overwhelmingly in favor of fingerprints, fingerprinting was introduced to British India by the Governor General, and in 1900, replaced Anthropometry. Also in 1900, Henry was sent to Natal, South Africa to assist in the reorganization of the local police force and establish a fingerprint bureau. His efforts in South Africa were highly\nsuccessful; and in 1901 Sir Henry returned to Britain and was appointed Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard, head of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). In the same year, the first UK fingerprint bureau was established at Scotland Yard. (Harling 1996) (Met) (Early)\n\nThe Henry Classification System allows for logical categorization of ten-print fingerprint records into primary groupings based on fingerprint pattern types. This system reduces the effort necessary to search large numbers of fingerprint records by classifying fingerprint records according to gross physiological characteristics. Subsequent searches (manual or automated) utilizing granular characteristics such as minutiae are greatly simplified. The Henry Classification System is a method to classify fingerprints and exclude potential candidates. This system should NEVER be used for individualization.\n\nThe Henry Classification System assigns each finger a number according to the order in which\nit is located in the hand, beginning with the right thumb as number 1 and ending with the left\npinky as number 10. The system also assigns a numerical value to fingers that contain a whorl\npattern; fingers 1 and 2 each have a value of 16, fingers 3 and 4 have a value of 8, fingers 5 and 6 have a value of 4, fingers 7 and 8 have a value of 2, and the final two fingers having a value of 1. Fingers with a non-whorl pattern, such as an arch or loop pattern, have a value of zero. The sum of the even finger value is then calculated and placed in the numerator of a fraction. The sum of the odd finger values is placed in the denominator. The value of 1 is added to each sum of the whorls with the maximum obtainable on either side of the fraction being 32. Thus, the primary classification is a fraction between 1/1 to 32/32, where 1/1 would indicate no whorl patterns and 32/32 would mean that all fingers had whorl patterns.\n\nExample of a Henry Classification:\n\nplus 34edg\n\nKey- Ridge count first loop\n\nMajor- Value of the ridge counts or the tracings of fingers #1, #6\n\nPrimary- Summation of the value of: Whorl type patterns fingers (#2, #4, #6, #8, #10 for Numerator), (#1, #3, #5, #7, #9 for Denominator); Value of fingers as whorls: #1 & #2 (16), #3 & #4 (8), #5 & #6 (4), #7 & #8 (2), #9 & #10 (1); Plus 1 in both Numerator and Denominator.\n\nSecondary- Pattern types in fingers #2 and #7, (U) Ulna Loop, (R) Radial Loop, (W) Whorl, and (A) Arch\n\nSub-Secondary- Value of ridge counts or tracing- fingers #2, #3, #4 in Numerator; #7, #8, #9 in Denominator.\n\nFinal- is the ridge count of the loops or whorls in both little fingers expressed in numbers. The right little is used as the numerator and the left little as the denominator. If a loop appears in one finger and a whorl in the other, enumerate both their ridge counts by treating the whorl as an ulnar loop.\n\nThe Henry Classification System has been a highly influential force in the formation of current IAFIS technology (Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System). When IAFIS solutions attempted to emulate the Henry process.\n\nUp until the mid-1990s, it was not unusual for a state or city to continue to maintain its physical file of Henry-sorted fingerprint cards just in case a disaster occurred in the IAFIS. As processing speeds, network throughput capacities, and system reliability increased, it was no longer necessary for automated fingerprint matching to mirror what had been the manual processes.\n\nIAFIS began to classify fingerprints according to the distance between the core and delta, minutiae locations, and pattern type, the latter being based on the Henry Classification System. Presently, there are some forensic AVIS solutions (e.g. state and local) that still employ a Henry Classification System based manual fingerprint filing. However, other than for legacy systems, the Henry Classification System is not essential for automated systems. (Carlton)in 20234\n\n"}

The sequence has been dated as no younger than 3.85 billion years old - that is, in the Hadean eon - based on the age of an igneous band that cuts the rock. The supracrustal sequence contains layers rich in iron and silica, which are variously interpreted as banded iron formation, chemical sediments from submarine hot springs, or hydrothermal vein deposits. Carbon in the rock, present as graphite, shows low levels of carbon-13, which may suggest an origin as isotopically light organic matter derived from living organisms. \nHowever, this interpretation is complicated because of high-grade metamorphism that affected the Akilia rocks after their formation. The sedimentary origin, age and the carbon content of the rocks have been questioned.\n\nIf the Akilia rocks do show evidence of life by 3.85 Ga, it would challenge models which suggest that Earth would not be hospitable to life at this time.\n\n\n"}

They exhibit their author as a man with an eye at once for simplicity of design and delicacy of proportion. Indeed, some of his pieces possess a dainty and slender elegance which has never been surpassed in the history of English furniture.\n\nThere can be little doubt that Shearer exercised considerable influence over George Hepplewhite, with whom there is reason to suppose that he was closely associated, while Thomas Sheraton has recorded his admiration for work which has often been attributed to others. Shearer, in his turn, owes something to the Adam brothers, and something, no doubt, to the stock designs of his predecessors.\n\nThere is every reason to suppose that he worked at his craft with his own hands and that he was literally a cabinet-maker—so far as we know, he never made chairs. Much of the elegance of Shearer's work is due to his graceful and reticent employment of inlays of satinwood and other foreign woods. But he was as successful in form as in decoration, and no man ever used the curve to better purpose.\n\nIn Shearer's time the sideboard was in process of evolution; previously it had been a table with drawers, the pedestals and knife-boxes being separate pieces. He would seem to have been first to combine them into the familiar and often beautiful form they took at the end of the 18th century. The combination may have been made before, but his plate is, in point of time, the first published document to show it.\n\nShearer, like many of his contemporaries, was much given to devising \"harlequin\" furniture. He was a designer of high merit and real originality, and occupies a distinguished place among the little band of men, often, like himself, ill-educated and obscure of origin, who raised the English cabinet-making of the second half of the 18th century to an illustrious place in artistic history.\n"}

Normally seen clothed in white, Lachesis is the measurer of the thread spun on Clotho's spindle, and in some texts, determines Destiny, or thread of life. Her Roman equivalent was Decima. Lachesis was the apportioner, deciding how much time for life was to be allowed for each person or being. She measured the thread of life with her rod.

In mythology, it is said that she appears with her sisters within three days of a baby's birth to decide its fate.\n\nAccording to Hesiod's Theogony, Lachesis and her sisters (Atropos and Clotho) were the daughters of Erebus (Darkness) and Nyx (Night), though later in the same work (ll. 901-906) they are said to have been born of Zeus and Themis.

{"id": "1830426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830426", "title": "VA loan", "text": "VA loan\n\nA VA loan is a mortgage loan in the United States guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The program is for American veterans, military members currently serving in the U.S. military, reservists and select surviving spouses (provided they do not remarry) and can be used to purchase single-family homes, condominiums, multi-unit properties, manufactured homes and new construction. The VA does not originate loans, but sets the rules for who may qualify, issues minimum guidelines and requirements under which mortgages may be offered and financially guarantees loans that qualify under the program.\n\nThe basic intention of the VA home loan program is to supply home financing to eligible veterans and to help veterans purchase properties with no down payment. The loan may be issued by qualified lenders.\n\nThe VA loan allows veterans 103.3 percent financing without private mortgage insurance (PMI) or a 20 percent second mortgage and up to $6,000 for energy efficient improvements. A VA funding fee of 0 to 3.3% of the loan amount is paid to the VA; this fee may also be financed and some may qualify for an exemption. In a purchase, veterans may borrow up to 103.3% of the sales price or reasonable value of the home, whichever is less. Since there is no monthly PMI, more of the mortgage payment goes directly towards qualifying for the loan amount, allowing for larger loans with the same payment. In a refinance, where a new VA loan is created, veterans may borrow up to 100% of a property's reasonable value, where allowed by state laws. In a refinance where the loan is a VA loan refinancing to VA loan (IRRRL Refinance), the veteran may borrow up to 100.5% of the total loan amount. The additional .5% is the funding fee for a VA Interest Rate Reduction Refinance.\n\nVA loans allow veterans to qualify for loan amounts larger than traditional Fannie Mae / conforming loans. Standard VA guidelines state that the VA will insure a mortgage where the monthly payment of the loan is up to 41% of the gross monthly income vs. 28% for a conforming loan assuming the veteran has no monthly bills, although there is no hard limit to the DTI for a VA home loan. Veterans have been known to be approved with a DTI of up to 80%, if there are other factors that strengthen their loan application. These factors include a low Loan-To-Value (LTV), sufficient residual income, additional income received but not used to qualify for the loan, good credit, etc...\n\nThe original Servicemen's Readjustment Act, passed by the United States Congress in 1944, extended a wide variety of benefits to eligible veterans. The VA loan guarantee program was especially important to veterans. Under the law, as amended, the VA is authorized to guarantee or insure home, farm, and business loans made to veterans by lending institutions. Over the history of the program, 20 million VA home loans have been insured by the government. The VA can make direct loans in certain areas for the purpose of purchasing or constructing a home or farm residence, or for repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling. The terms and requirements of VA farm and business loans have not induced private lenders to make such loans in volume during recent years.\n\nThe Veterans Housing Act of 1970 removed all termination dates for applying for VA-guaranteed housing loans. This 1970 amendment also provided for VA-guaranteed loans on mobile homes.\n\nMore recently, the Veterans Housing Benefits Improvement Act of 1978 expanded and increased the benefits for millions of American veterans.\n\nUntil 1992, the VA loan guarantee program was available only to veterans who served on active duty during specified periods. However, with the enactment of the Veterans Home Loan Program Amendments of 1992 (Public Law 102-547, approved 28 October 1992), program eligibility was expanded to include Reservists and National Guard personnel who served honorably for at least six years without otherwise qualifying under the previous active duty provisions. Such personnel are required to pay a slightly higher funding fee when obtaining a VA home loan.\n\nDespite a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding, the federal government generally does not make direct loans under the act. The government simply guarantees loans made by ordinary mortgage lenders (descriptions of which appear in subsequent sections) after veterans make their own arrangements for the loans through normal financial circles. The Veterans Administration then appraises the property in question and, if satisfied with the risk involved, guarantees the lender against loss of principal if the buyer defaults.\n\nIn association with the VA's program, the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act protects service members from financial woes on their home loan that may occur as a result of active duty commitments, freezing their interest rates at 6%.\n\nOn October 26, 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced it has guaranteed 20 million home loans since its home loan program was established in 1944 as part of the original GI Bill of Rights for returning World War II Veterans. The 20 millionth loan was guaranteed for a home in Woodbridge, Va., purchased by the surviving spouse of an Iraq War Veteran who died in 2010. (www.va.gov)\n\nOn June 22, 2019, the VA loan program celebrated its 75th anniversary since the passing of the original Servicemen's Readjustment Act, also knowns as the G.I. Bill. During the celebration, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced the program had guaranteed 24 million VA home loans since its inception. \n\nOn June 25, 2019, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 was signed into law temporarily increasing the VA funding fee for active duty service members and veterans starting January 1, 2020. The law removed VA county loan limits for homebuyers with full VA loan entitlement and made Purple Heart recipients exempt from paying the VA funding fee. Several members of Congress were displeased after the passing of the act, writing an open letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy asking that future bills not be paid for by increasing VA loan fees.\n\nA funding fee must be paid to VA unless the veteran is exempt from such a fee because he or she receives any VA disability compensation. It is a myth that the disability compensation must be some percentage, \"such as minimum of 10%\". The statute actually reads, \"...38 U.S. Code § 3729.Loan fee - (1) A fee may not be collected under this section from a veteran who is receiving compensation (or who, but for the receipt of retirement pay or active service pay, would be entitled to receive compensation) or from a surviving spouse of any veteran (including a person who died in the active military, naval, or air service) who died from a service-connected disability...\" If a veteran is awarded disability compensation after paying a funding fee, he/she can apply for a refund of this funding fee, so long as the beginning date of the disability is prior to the closing date of the home mortgage.\n\nIn August 2012, Congress passed a bill that allows a Veteran to receive the benefits of having Veteran Disability while it is still pending. The amount paid for the funding fee can be refunded back to the Veteran when a determination is made and the paperwork is received.\n\nThe VA Funding fee may be paid in cash or included in the loan amount. Closing costs such as VA appraisal, credit report, loan processing fee, title search, title insurance, recording fees, transfer taxes, survey charges, or hazard insurance may not be included in the loan. However, the seller may pay these on behalf of the VA borrower.\n\nDue to the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019, the VA funding fee is equalized for all branches of service starting January 1, 2020. For active duty military members and veterans, this means an increase in VA funding fee costs for a period of 2 years. If you have a service-connected disability that you are compensated for by the VA or if you are a surviving spouse of veteran who died in service or from service-connected disabilities, the funding fee is waived.\n\nThe VA funding fee can be financed directly into the maximum loan amount for the county in which the home is located. For subsequent use VA loans, if the sales price and the financed VA funding fee total more than maximum loan amount for that county, the borrower or seller must pay for the fee out of pocket. All VA loans require an impound account for property taxes and homeowners insurance which makes the monthly payment of VA loans calculated as a PITI payment.**\n\n\n\nPrivate mortgage insurance (PMI) guarantees conventional home mortgage loans - those that are not guaranteed by the government. This loan program is a private sector equivalent to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and VA loan programs.\n\nThe PMI company insures a percentage of the consumer's loan to reduce the lender's risk; this percentage is paid to the lender if the consumer does not pay and the lender forecloses the loan.\n\nLenders decide if they need and want private mortgage insurance. If they so decide, it becomes a requirement of the loan. PMI companies charge a fee to insure a mortgage loan; the VA insures a loan at no cost to a veteran buyer (other than the VA funding fee); the FHA charges a monthly fee to guarantee the loan.\n\nThe VA loan application is a standardized loan application form 1003 issued by Fannie Mae also known as Freddie Mac Form 65. It is a Federal crime punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both, to knowingly make any false statements on a VA loan application under the provisions of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, et seq.\n\nYou will need the following paperwork to apply:\n\nThe Veteran Loan program is designed for veterans who meet the minimum number of days of completed service. Some of the other eligibility requirement for the VA loan program and some specific home loan benefits include the length of service or service commitment, duty status and character of service. The program does allow for benefits to Surviving Spouses.\n\nThe VA does not have a minimum credit score used for pre-qualifying for a mortgage loan, however, most Lenders require a minimum credit score of at least 620.\nA Veteran who has used their entitlement to previously purchase a home, may have entitlement left to purchase another one. If you previously purchased a home using your VA Benefits then you might still have some of that “Entitlement” available to you for the purchase a new home. To Calculate Maximum Entitlement available, consider the following:\n\nAllowable Income Sources used to qualify for a VA Loan include: Retirement Income, Social Security Income, Child Support, Alimony and Separate Maintenance, BAH, BAS and Disability Income. Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) for a Surviving Spouse can also be included. In addition, stable, documented income from employers remains the best income source for VA loans.\n\nThe National Center on Homelessness Among Veterans (NCHAV) has planned to increase recovery-oriented care provided to homeless Veterans, or those soon to be, through the development and dissemination of evidence-based programs, policies as well as best practices. It was established in 2009 to support the execution of the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs’ (VA’s) Five Year Plan to End Homelessness Among Veterans. This plan was born out of the goals and timeframes set forth by the legislators, governors, nonprofits, faith-based and community organizations, the U.S. Congress, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, business entities and philanthropic leaders to end homelessness in America and progress to make affordable and stable housing available to all its people.\n\nBelow are the four core activities of NCHAV’s integrated and organized work:\n\n\n"}

As the first school of international relations in the post–Cold War era, the Whitehead School was founded with a need to “prepare the next generation of global leaders.” \nThe School's founding was supported by the United Nations Association of the United States of America, with which it still enjoys a close relationship. Its close proximity to New York City has also historically allowed its students and faculty to participate in U.N.-sponsored functions. Consequently, students from the school often interact with U.N. diplomats. The alliance with UNA-USA has also afforded students opportunities to receive internships and employment with various organizations of the U.N.\n\nIn June 2013, it was announced that John C. Whitehead asked for his name to be removed from the school. Dr. Andrea Bartoli, an international conflict resolution expert who has served in academic and diplomatic positions for more than two decades, joined the School as Dean in July 2013. Under his leadership the School launched three new academic and research centers in the spring of 2014: The Center for United Nations and Global Governance Studies, The Center for Peace and Conflict Studies, and The Center for Emerging Powers and Transnational Trends. These new centers are in addition to the Center for Global Health Studies.\n\nThe School offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees, a Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts in Diplomacy and International Relations, as well as an Executive M.S. in International Affairs, available in on-campus, online, and hybrid formats. It also offers Graduate Certificates in Post-Conflict State Reconstruction and Sustainability (online), United Nations Studies, Global Health Management, and Global Studies for both working professionals as well as matriculated graduate students, and a United Nations Intensive Summer Study Program for graduate students, advanced undergraduates and working professionals. The UN program may be taken as a three credit course for credit or not for credit. In addition to its formal academic programs, the school is often a venue for professional workshops and conferences.\n\nThe undergraduate program, working toward a Bachelor of Science degree, is an intensive program which includes 120 total credits, 45 of which are Diplomacy specific coursework. Students take a wide range of courses in international relations, history, economics, and law. In addition, there is an eighteen-credit foreign language requirement which usually leads to the completion of a minor. As part of the curriculum, all undergraduate students complete at least one internship for academic credit. A five year B.S./M.A. program is offered for students who wish to complete a master's degree in an accelerated time frame. A six year B.S./J.D. program prepares students for both an undergraduate degree in International Relations and a law degree. \n\nStudents enrolled in the M.A. program participate in a two-year program that culminates with either a research project or a thesis. Degree requirements include the completion of an academic internship and at least two of thirteen different specializations. Students choose between functional fields of study such as: \n\nRegional specializations include:\n\nStudents can also design their own fields of study. Each specialization consists of three or four different courses. All students have to satisfactorily complete 45 credits. In addition, with the school's emphasis on building a strong economics background, all students have to complete a series of courses in economics.\n\nTo complement the M.A. degree, the School also offers several dual-degree programs in collaboration with other academic units of the university. These include:\n\nIn addition to these programs, the School also offers a ten course Executive M.S. in International Affairs for mid-career professionals, available in on-campus, online, and hybrid formats. Graduate Certificates are offered in Post-Conflict State Reconstruction and Sustainability (online), United Nations Studies, Global Health Management, and Global Studies.\n\nInternships are an integral part of the School as they allow students to get first-hand experience working in the international relations field and to apply what they learned in their classes to current events. Undergraduate students are required to complete at least two internships and graduate students are required to complete at least one internship prior to graduating. Students at the School have interned at ABC News, American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, BBC, Caritas Internationalis, Council on Foreign Relations, Doctors Without Borders, Human Rights Watch, International Rescue Committee, Interpol, New York Times, U.S. Fund for UNICEF, U.S. Department of State, various missions to the United Nations, and at the offices of mayors, congressmen and women, and senators. \n\nBoth undergraduate and graduate students have the opportunity to spend a semester in Washington, D.C. as part of the School's collaboration with the United Nations Foundation. While there, they take seminar-style classes and examine the causes, consequences and possible solutions to today's global policy challenges. Students are placed in competitive Washington, D.C. based internships while maintaining their financial aid and full-time student status. \n\nThe School also offers study seminars in China, Cyprus, Ethiopia, and Kosovo. Each trip offers an intensive study of international affairs where students see international relations theory and practice come together. In these courses, students are immersed in political, social, economic and cultural issues as a diplomatic delegation. \n\nStudents of all majors can participate in both the semester in Washington, D.C.and study seminars. \n\nThe School is also known for its high-profile lecturers. The past two United Nations Secretaries-General Kofi Annan and Ban Ki-moon have both participated in the Forum, as well as Sinn Féin Leader Gerry Adams, Iranian President Mohammed Khatami, Nobel Peace Laureate John Hume, President of Israel Shimon Peres, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, Liberian peace activist and Nobel Laureate Leymah Gbowee, United States National Security Advisor Susan Rice, United States Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, and most recently, the President of the 72nd United Nations General Assembly Miroslav Lajčák. Other heads of state have included former Polish President Lech Wałęsa, and former Prime Minister Tony Blair. \n\nThe Journal of Diplomacy and International Relations is an internationally distributed periodical produced by the School's graduate students.\n\nThe Journal's editorial board has worked together with notable contributors such as: UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan; European Court Justice President, Gil Carlos Rodriguez Iglesias; President Oscar Arias Sánchez; Former Director-General of the World Health Organization, Gro Harlem Brundtland; Iranian President Mohammad Khatami; Deputy Secretary of U.S. Treasury Stuart Eizenstat; and Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering.\n\nThe Journal is indexed by Columbia International Affairs Online, the International Relations and Security Network, Public Affairs Information Service, International Political Science Abstracts, America: History and Life and Historical Abstracts, and Ulrich’s Periodicals Directory.\n\n"}
{"id": "1830431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830431", "title": "The Legend of Zorro", "text": "The Legend of Zorro\n\nThe Legend of Zorro is a 2005 American swashbuckler film directed by Martin Campbell, produced by Walter F. Parkes, Laurie MacDonald and Lloyd Phillips, with music by James Horner, and written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. It is the sequel to 1998's \"The Mask of Zorro\"; Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones reprise their roles as the titular hero and his spouse, Elena, and Rufus Sewell stars as the villain, Count Armand. The film takes place in San Mateo County, California and was shot in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, with second-unit photography in Wellington, New Zealand. The film was theatrically released on October 28, 2005, by Columbia Pictures (instead of TriStar due to Columbia holding the sequel rights to Tristar's pre-1999 film library), and earned $142.4 million on a $75 million budget.\n\nIn 1850, nine years after the events of the first film, California is voting on whether to join the United States of America as a state. Alejandro Murrieta/Zorro, now known as Don Alejandro De La Vega, foils a plot to steal the ballots, but during the fight with a gunman named Jacob McGivens, he briefly loses his mask. A pair of Pinkerton agents sees his face and recognize him. The following day, the Pinkertons confront Alejandro's wife, Elena, and blackmail her into divorcing him.\n\nThree months later, the separation from Elena and his son Joaquin, and the feeling that the people no longer need Zorro, are taking its toll on Alejandro. His childhood guardian, Father Felipe, convinces him to attend a party at French Count Armand's new vineyard. There, Alejandro discovers that Elena is dating the count, an admirer from her time spent in Europe. After leaving the party, Alejandro witnesses a huge explosion close to Armand's mansion and becomes suspicious of him.\n\nMcGivens leads an attack on the family of Guillermo Cortez, Alejandro's friend, to seize their land deed. Donning his mask again, Zorro rescues Guillermo's wife and son, but fails to save Guillermo and the deed. Zorro follows McGivens to Armand's mansion and discovers that Armand plans to build a railroad on Cortez's land. He also encounters Elena and, learning of an upcoming shipment, he tracks McGivens to a cove where the cargo is delivered. Unbeknownst to him, Joaquin also hitched a ride on McGiven's cart, having sneaked out of a class trip. Zorro saves his son from the bandits and, examing the shipment, he sees a piece of the cargo - a bar of soap - and the name \"Orbis Unum\" on a crate lid. Upon researching the phrase, Felipe and Alejandro learn that Armand is the head of a secret society, the Knights of Aragon, which has been secretly ruling Europe. The United States is deemed a threat to the Knights, so they plan to throw the country into chaos before it can gain too much power.\n\nAlejandro is captured by the Pinkertons, who reveal that they forced Elena to divorce Alejandro in order to get close to Armand and learn of his plans without the aid of Zorro, as they dislike Zorro and his vigilante ways. Joaquin frees Alejandro from captivity. Zorro goes to Armand's mansion, meets Elena, and eavesdrops on Armand's meeting. He learns that the soap bars are secretly used as an ingredient for nitroglycerin, which Armand plans to distribute throughout the Confederate army, with the help of Confederate Colonel Beauregard, to destroy the Union. Zorro and Elena reconcile, and Zorro prepares to destroy the train carrying the explosives. McGivens arrives at Felipe's church to look for Zorro. Unable to find him, McGivens shoots the priest and kidnaps Joaquin.\n\nMeanwhile, however, Armand's butler Ferroq tracks down and kills the Pinkertons and informs his master about Elena's deception. Armand confronts Elena, and takes her and Joaquin hostage on the train carrying the explosives, making Zorro unable to destroy it. Zorro is captured and unmasked in front of his son. Armand takes Joaquin and Elena away and orders McGivens to kill Alejandro. Felipe, having been saved from McGivens's bullet by the cross he wears, arrives, and he and Alejandro overpower and kill McGivens.\n\nZorro catches up with Armand, and they engage in a sword fight. Meanwhile, Elena has Joaquin escape into the back cars of the train, which she disconnects. Elena fights Ferroq in the nitro storage car and throws him and a bottle of nitro out of the car and at the feet of Colonel Beauregard at their prearranged meeting point, killing them. Further along the tracks, the governor prepares to sign the bill to make California a Union state. Joaquin collects Tornado, Zorro's horse, jumps off the train, and overtakes it. He hits a track switch, causing the train to harmlessly pass around the ceremony. Zorro and Armand's duel takes them to the very front of the train engine. Seeing the track is a dead end, Zorro hooks Armand to the train by tying him up on the front of the engine and escapes with Elena. The train crashes into the pile of rails at the end of the track, setting off the nitroglycerin, killing Armand and destroying the train.\n\nWith Zorro as an official witness, the governor signs the bill, and California becomes the 31st state of the United States of America. Felipe remarries Alejandro and Elena, and Alejandro apologizes to his son for hiding his identity, admitting that Zorro's identity is a family secret rather than just his own. With Elena's support, Zorro rides off on Tornado to his next mission.\n\n\nAn alternate ending, included on the DVD, shows a grown-up Joaquin putting on the costume and riding off into the sunset, following his father's and maternal grandfather Diego de la Vega's (portrayed by Anthony Hopkins in \"The Mask of Zorro\") footsteps as Zorro, while the elderly Alejandro and Elena watch proudly. This was changed to the theatrical ending in order to allow for future sequels with Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, something that never happened.\n\n\"The Legend of Zorro\" continues its predecessor's inclusion of historical elements of California history into the fiction, though many liberties have been taken. Alejandro, the Mexican-born Californian who became Zorro at the end of \"The Mask of Zorro\", is a fictional brother to Joaquin Murrieta, for whom the character's son Joaquin is named. Military governor Bennet Riley, the last of California's heads of state prior to statehood, is portrayed, but the Maryland-born American is played by the Mexican actor Pedro Armendáriz Jr. who speaks English with a Hispanic accent. Leo Burmester plays R. S. Beauregard, a Confederate colonel whose character is not to be confused with the historical P. G. T. Beauregard. Pedro Mira plays a pre-Presidential Abraham Lincoln as an observer to California's statehood, though the real Lincoln never traveled to the region. The film also features a fictional monument called Bear Point, commemorating the site where the original Bear Flag of the California Republic flew briefly in 1846. Although the actual flag flew in Sonoma County, the film suggests that Bear Point is located in San Mateo County.\n\n\"The Legend of Zorro\", which takes place in 1850, includes a significant number of deviations from national history as well, particularly in depicting an organized Confederate States of America and a presumed completed First Transcontinental Railroad, each more than a decade before their times. Additional deviations include a quote from the \"Gettysburg Address\", which would not be written until 1863. A map discovered by Zorro delineates two states (Arizona and New Mexico) that did not achieve statehood until 1912; several other states depicted on the map entered into the Union long after California. The film also features characters who identify themselves as agents of the Pinkerton Detective Agency, which had been established in the year 1850 but was known at the time as the North-Western Police Agency.\n\nA deleted scene on the film's DVD features a short discussion on a magic lantern presentation.\n\nThe use of the Henry repeating rifle by Jacob McGivens is a mistake, it was introduced in the early 1860s and produced through 1866.\n\nThe film currently holds a rating of 47 out of 100 on Metacritic, and a 26% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with its consensus stating, \"Zorro can survive a lot of things, but it looks like he can't survive marriage\". Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film a below-average review, awarding it one and a half out of four stars, commenting that \"of all of the possible ideas about how to handle the Elena character, this movie has assembled the worst ones.\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave \"The Legend of Zorro\" two out of four stars, saying that \"the action is routine\", \"the chemistry between the two leads, which was one of the highlights of \"The Mask of Zorro\", has evaporated during the intervening years\", and that the movie \"fails to recapture the pleasure offered by \"The Mask of Zorro\".\"\n\nStephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised the film, calling it \"entertaining, bold, and self-effacing at once\", noting the civic and parental questions it raises. \"Slate Magazine\" critic David Edelstein also praised the film, in particular the action scenes, villains, and chemistry between Banderas and Zeta-Jones. Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said the film was \"watchable – not remotely enjoyable, but watchable.\" Nathan Rabin of \"The Onion\"s \"A.V. Club\" gave the film a lukewarm review, saying that \"director Martin Campbell doles out action sequences stingily\", and added that \"\"The Legend of Zorro\" still feels like a half-hearted shrug of a sequel.\" Brian Lowry of \"Variety\" said that \"The Legend of Zorro\" is \"considerably less charming than \"The Mask of Zorro\"\", but added that the film \"gets by mostly on dazzling stunt work and the pleasure of seeing its dashing and glamorous leads back in cape and gown.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" awarded the film a \"B-\" score. Schwarzbaum said that \"too many scenes emphasize gross butchery over the elegance of the blade\", but added that the film is \"well-oiled\" and praised the \"fancy fight sequences\".\n\nStephen Hunter of \"The Washington Post\" reacted negatively, calling \"The Legend of Zorro\" \"a waste of talent, time, and money\" and \"stupid and boring\". Marc Savlov of the \"Austin Chronicle\" was also not impressed, remarking that \"there are precious few things for a Zorro fan – or a film fan, for that matter – not to loathe about \"The Legend of Zorro\".\" The film did reasonably well at the box office, grossing $142,400,065 internationally, but did not match the success of its predecessor.\n\nThe film was released on DVD and VHS on January 31, 2006. It was later released on Blu-ray on December 11, 2007.\n\n"}

{"id": "1830448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830448", "title": "Nativity of Mary", "text": "Nativity of Mary\n\nThe Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Nativity of Mary, or the Birth of the Virgin Mary, refers to a Christian feast day celebrating the birth of Mary, mother of Jesus.\n\nThe modern canon of scripture does not record Mary's birth. The earliest known account of Mary's birth is found in the Protoevangelium of James (5:2), an apocryphal text from the late second century, with her parents known as Saint Anne and Saint Joachim.\n\nIn the case of saints, the Church commemorates their date of death, with Saint John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary as the few whose birth dates are commemorated. The reason for this is found in the singular mission each had in salvation history, but traditionally also because these alone were holy in their very birth (for Mary, see Immaculate Conception; John was sanctified in Saint Elizabeth's womb according to the traditional interpretation of ).\n\nDevotion to the innocence of Mary under this Marian title is widely celebrated in many cultures across globe.\n\nThe \"Protoevangelium of James\", which was probably put into its final written form in the early second century, describes Mary's father Joachim as a wealthy member of one of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. He and his wife Anne were deeply grieved by their childlessness.\n\nPious accounts place the birthplace of the Virgin Mary in Sepphoris, Israel where a 5th-century basilica is excavated at the site. Some accounts speak of Nazareth and others say it was in a house near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem. It is possible that a wealthy man such as Joachim had a home in both Judea and Galilee. However, Charles Souvay, writing in the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\", says that the idea that Joachim possessed large herds and flocks cannot be asserted with certainty, as the sources for this are \"...of very doubtful value...\".\n\nTradition celebrates the event as a liturgical feast in the General Roman Calendar and in most Anglican liturgical calendars on 8 September, nine months after the solemnity of her Immaculate Conception, celebrated on 8 December. The feast is also included in the Tridentine Calendar for 8 September. This date is also used in the Western Rite Orthodox Church.\n\nThe Byzantine Rite Orthodox likewise celebrate the Nativity of the Theotokos on 8 September. The Syriac Orthodox Church, like its closely related sister church, the Byzantine Rite Antiochian Orthodox Church, also celebrates the feast on 8 September. For churches using the old Julian Calendar for liturgical purposes September 8 falls on September 21 of the Gregorian Calendar. In other words, \"Old Calendar\" Churches, such as the Russian Orthodox Church, still celebrate the Nativity of the Theotokos on the 8th, but the day is actually the 21st according to the everyday calendar used by society at large.\n\nThe Armenian Apostolic Church also uses the traditional date of 8 September. Yet the Coptic Orthodox and Ethiopian Orthodox Christians celebrate it on May 9 (1 Bashans, EC 1 Ginbot).\n\nThe earliest document commemorating this feast comes from a hymn written in the sixth century. The feast may have originated somewhere in Syria or Palestine in the beginning of the sixth century, when after the Council of Ephesus, the cult of the Mother of God was greatly intensified, especially in Syria.\n\nThe first liturgical commemoration is connected with the sixth century dedication of the \"Basilica Sanctae Mariae ubi nata est\", now called the Church of St. Anne in Jerusalem. The original church built, in the fifth century, was a Marian basilica erected on the spot known as the shepherd's pool and thought to have been the home of Mary's parents. In the seventh century, the feast was celebrated by the Byzantines as the feast of the Birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Since the story of Mary's Nativity is known only from apocryphal sources, the Latin Church was slower in adopting this festival. At Rome the Feast began to be kept toward the end of the 7th century, brought there by Eastern monks.\n\nThe church of Angers in France claims that St. Maurilius instituted this feast at Angers in consequence of a revelation about 430. On the night of 8 September, a man heard the angels singing in heaven, and on asking the reason, they told him they were rejoicing because the Virgin was born on that night; but this tradition is not substantiated by historical proofs.\n\nThe winegrowers in France called this feast \"Our Lady of the Grape Harvest\". The best grapes are brought to the local church to be blessed and then some bunches are attached to the hands of the statue of Mary. A festive meal that includes the new grapes is part of this day.\n\nIn Goa, the feast of Mary's Nativity, called the \"Monti Fest\", is a major family celebration, serving as a thanksgiving festival blessing the harvest of new crops, and observed with a festive lunch centered on the blessed grain of the harvest.\nIn Mangalore it is the feast of Mary's Nativity, called the \"Monthi Fest\". On this day every Mangalorean eats pulses and vegetables.\nThe priest blesses a branch of grain which is added to food. Before the feast on 8 September there are nine days of novena followed by the throwing of flowers on baby Mary's statue.\n\nThe scene was frequently depicted in art, as part of cycles of the Life of the Virgin. Medieval depictions of Mary in infancy often include her birth by Saint Anne. In late medieval depictions the setting was often in a wealthy household.\n\nIn 1730, devotion to Mary in her first infancy among the Franciscan nuns in Lovere, Italy, where a wax statue of the \"Santissima Maria Bambina\" was venerated and later brought to Milan under the care of Sisters of Charity. In Southern France, the devotion penetrated into the bride gift wedding custom of \"Globe de Marièe\", where the baby Mary is placed on the cushion, representing children and fertility as one of the ideal wishes of a newlywed bride.\n\nA similar devotion showcasing the toddler years of Mary began to develop, mainly in former Spanish territories such as Mexico, Guatemala and the Philippines, where the \"La Niña María\" is portrayed as a prepubescent girl.\n\nIn 19th-century Mexico, the Conceptionists nun Sister Magdalena endorsed a devotion to the infant Virgin, using the \"Cabeza\" or head of a cherub angel from a damaged monstrance to create a Santo image. Later, Marian visionary, Rosario Arrevillaga, began a religious order devoted to the same Marian title called the \"Order of the Slaves of the Immaculate Child\".\n\nPope Benedict XV recognised the Marian image in Senglea, Malta under the title of \"Maria Bambina\" honouring the nativity of the Virgin Mary, granting the decree of its canonical coronation on 1 May 1920, subsequently crowned by Archbishop Mauro Caruana on 4 September 1921. The image which once adorned a Catholic galleon was shipwrecked in 1618 near the Dalmatian islands and was rescued to the present town, which also celebrates its feast on September 8.\n\nIn the Philippines, pious Catholics adopted the same devotion to the toddler Virgin, dressing her in pastel colours and crowning her with flowers to emphasise her virginity and innocence, as opposed to the traditional diadem reserved for images of adult saints. Similar to Hispanic traditions, candies and cakes are popularly offered in the infant Virgin's honour, emphasizing her honorific title as \"La Dulce María\" or the Sweet Mary. On 27 December 2018, the House of Representatives of the Philippines officially approved bill #7856, in honor of the Virgin Mary's birthday for September 8 as a working holiday. On August 13, 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte has signed \"Republic Act 11370\", a law declaring September 8 a special working holiday in the entire country to commemorate the Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nThough unrelated, certain places with Marian devotion juxtapose the Feast of Mary's birthdate with their own respective localised images such as the following:\n\n\nThe Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral is located in Biloxi, Mississippi. There is also a Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Juneau, Alaska. The Nativity of Mary, Blessed Virgin Catholic Church in High Hill, Texas is an historic church built in 1906. The Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish in Lorain, Ohio was founded in 1898 to serve the Polish-American community. Nativity of Mary Catholic Church and School is located in Bloomington, Minnesota and is part of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul-Minneapolis.\n\nThe Nativity of the Virgin Mary Orthodox Church in Madison, Illinois is part of the Orthodox Church in America Diocese of the Midwest. The Nativity of the Theotokos Monastery in Saxonburg, Pennsylvania, north of Pittsburgh, is the first Greek Orthodox women's monastery in America, founded in 1989.\n\nThe birth of Mary is narrated in the third \"sura\" (chapter) of the Qur'an with references to her father Imran, after whom the chapter is named, as well as her mother, Hannah. Hannah prayed to God to fulfil her desire to have a child and vowed, if her prayer was accepted, that her child (whom she initially thought would be male) would be dedicated to the service of God (a direct parallel to the Old Testament Hannah, whose mothering of the judge and prophet Samuel followed an identical storyline). She prayed for her child to remain protected from Satan (Shayṭān) and Muslim tradition records a \"hadith\", which states that the only children born without the \"touch of Satan\", were Mary and Jesus.\n\nOn the Maltese Islands, this feast is also referred to as the Feast of Our Lady of Victories (Maltese: \"Il-Festa tal-Vitorja\") owing to its coinciding with several important events in Maltese history. Such is the importance of this feast (both religious and historical), that September 8 is a national holiday referred to by many names, mainly Victory Day, il-Vitorja and il-Bambina (a shortening of Marija Bambina).\n\n\n"}

He was listed in American Men of Science and Who's Who in America.\n\nDuring his 36 years in government service, he often was called upon to provide his beetle expertise to the Smithsonian Institution and entomological organizations in the United States and elsewhere. He once provided entomological advice to writer John Steinbeck and found himself quoted on the subject of killer bees in the opening of Arthur Herzog's best-selling novel \"The Swarm\".\n\nRamsay was widely known for his research on a potato cyst eelworm — the parasitic golden nematode (\"Globodera rostochiensis\"). The worm was discovered in 1941 in potato fields on Long Island, New York, the only state where it has established a foothold. Around 1946, the worm was found on a lily of the valley plants imported from the Netherlands. Ramsay helped trace the worm to infested flower fields in Germany that had been converted for potato cultivation during World War II. Inspectors from the Department of Agriculture began testing cargoes of lilies in Hamburg, which initially slowed the golden nematode's spread from across the Atlantic. The Golden Nematode Act was enacted on June 15, 1948, to combat the worm. As of 2003, the golden nematode is one of 22 federally regulated organisms in the United States. According to Society of Nematologists, \"he played an instrumental role in reducing the spread of \"Globodera rostochiensis\" in the United States.\" \n\nHe also studied Dutch elm disease, termite infestations in Puerto Rico, and Mexican bean beetles in New York State, and helped develop methods for estimating losses from the parasites. He later trained inspectors from Japan, El Salvador, Jordan, and Indonesia in an effort to identify infested crops before they reached American shores. When those crops were found, agriculture officials usually ordered the cargoes dumped at sea and the ships fumigated. Raymond F. Bednar, a former director of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in New York, recalled that Ramsay \"always saw the new pest coming down the pike.\"\n\nRamsay was born and raised in Buffalo by his mother Lillian Maynard and father William \"Dowie\" Ramsay, a conductor and brakeman for the Nickel Plate Road. Ramsay studied under Albert R. Shadle and graduated from the University at Buffalo with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology. Continuing his education at Cornell University, Ramsay graduated with a Master of Science degree in Mammalogy.\n\nWhile living in Staten Island, Ramsay was awarded a Ph.D. in Entomology from Cornell in 1941, and gained employment with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Ramsay was one of the first few Ph.D. holders in service to the Department, and thus, colleagues bestowed him with the nickname \"Doc\". Encouraged by Shadle, \"Doc\" Ramsay then married Alberta June Wentworth, a beautician and owner of Alberta's Beauty Shop, from Canisteo.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1956, he served as a port entomologist, and then in 1967 was appointed to APHIS. He retired in 1977. Dr. Ramsay was also a former president of the Insecticide Society of Washington.\n\nAlberta Ramsay died in 2003. Two years later, Maynard Ramsay died of pneumonia on March 20, 2005, in a Silver Spring nursing home. The couple resided in Bowie, Maryland.\n\n\n"}

Two to four players travel around the virtual city of Fooblitzky, spending \"foobles\" and attempt to deduce what four objects are needed to win the game (and then obtain them).\n\nPlayers purchase objects in stores and can visit City Hall to have their possessions evaluated. Much in the same style as Mastermind, the player is told \"how many\" of their objects are correct, but not \"which ones\".\n\nEach box contained four sets of laminated game boards and erasable markers which could be used to track the progress of a game. Two sets of documentation were also included: a set of \"quick-start\" guidelines (\"The Bare Essentials\") and a more detailed set (\"Official Ordinances\").\n\nAs a test, for the first six months \"Fooblitzky\" was only advertised to those on Infocom's mailing list, although others could order it from the company. It sold very poorly; Infocom sold only 8,225 copies through 1986, the fewest of the five titles introduced in 1985, and from 1987 to 1989 the number of copies returned exceeded those sold.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" called \"Fooblitzky\" \"a fun way to spend time with a few friends\", stating that the advertising comparing it to \"Mastermind\" and \"Clue\" was correct. It noted that the game began as an Infocom project to see if graphical games could be written for easy porting between computers like the company's text adventures, and criticized the Atari version's resulting graphics as \"jerky and slow\". \"COMPUTE!\" stated \"probably no game on the computer software market today gives one the feel of playing a board game as much as does \"Fooblitzky\"\", adding that the principles \"Fooblitzky\" used were the same ones that made \"Monopoly\" popular. Cautioning that because it was so different from other computer games that \"it probably isn't for everyone's tastes\", the magazine recommended \"Fooblitzky\" for those seeking a game for families to enjoy.\n\nIn \"Zork Zero\" one of the possible magic words needed to win the game is \"fublitskee\".\n\n"}

The Gothic revival building is located at 736 Bathurst Street at the intersection with Lennox Street. The 500-seat theatre is in the former church sanctuary, while the smaller 100-seat Annex Theatre is in an adjoining building at 730 Bathurst Street. The building is also home to the Randolph College for the Performing Arts, a performing arts school. The theatres are rented out to travelling shows and local theatre companies, as well as used for the school's productions.\n\nThe building was originally home to Bathurst Street Wesleyan Methodist Church. This congregation was an extension of Elm Street WMC, and started in 1860. In 1862, services were being conducted in a cottage on nearby Markham Street, and the area was known as Seaton Village, still outside of the Toronto city limits.\n\nAfter a gift of land on Bathurst Street from the son of John Strachan, the first building on this site was constructed in 1866. Following a congregational split in 1869 (when Primitive Methodists in the area formed their own congregation), this congregation continued to grow and was joined by the former Primitive Methodist congregation in 1884, following the union of Methodists across Canada.\nThe present building (originally known as Bathurst Street Methodist Church) was erected by the congregation in 1888 to meet the demands of the growing population, and the United Methodist presence in Toronto. The building was designed by the architectural firm of Gordon & Helliwell.\n\nIn 1925, the congregation joined the new United Church of Canada and became Bathurst Street United Church. A minority of Presbyterians from St. Paul's PC (then located north of Bloor) joined, as St Paul's (which merged with Dovercourt Road PC in 1968, Chalmers in 1980, Dufferin Street PC in 1994, and closed in June 2005) remained within the Presbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nIn the 1950s, as the earlier families emigrated to the suburbs, the congregation shrank. A number of strategies were tried to increase attendance: one of these was the Sunday Evening Forums, wherein the Sunday evening sermon was replaced by a panel discussion on social issues among prominent guests. Running from 1944 to 1951, noted panelists included Tim Buck, who lived nearby.\n\nThe small congregation had difficulty maintaining the old structure, and they began to rent out the building for concerts and plays. Increasingly, the building became better known for its role as a theatre than for being a church.\n\nIn 1985, the congregation finally opted to leave the building, and it now meets at nearby Trinity-St. Paul's United Church. The building then became a permanent and well-known theatre. In 2000, the United Church of Canada sold the building to George Randolph Jr.\n\n"}

Elected as the youngest member of Franklin D. Roosevelt's first \"New Deal\" Congress, his political career stalled in 1938 when he gave up his seat at Roosevelt's urging to run for a U.S. Senate seat held by another Democrat, Guy M. Gillette, but primary voters rallied behind Gillette. He became a prolific writer, which led to his election to the Cowboy Hall of Fame.\n\nWearin was born on a farm near Hastings, Iowa in Mills County and graduated from Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa. While returning to Mills County to farm, the reputation he developed as a writer helped to jump-start his political career. He travelled to Europe to inspect their farming methods, which he described in articles printed in rural Iowa newspapers and published in his first book, \"An Iowa Farmer Abroad.\" By age 25, a newspaper reported that he had already \"gained prominence as a farm bureau speaker and writer in the past few years.\" Later that year he was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives as a Democrat, even though his home county was a traditional Republican stronghold and the influence of native-son presidential candidate Herbert Hoover at the top of the Republican ticket led to Republican gains throughout Iowa. He served two terms in the Iowa House, winning re-election in 1930.\n\nIn 1932, he became the first Democrat ever to win election to the U.S. House seat for Iowa's 7th congressional district. As a twenty-nine-year-old, he was Congress's youngest member. Congressman Wearin was known for his progressive ideals. He was re-elected in 1934 and in 1936, but by increasingly narrow margins in the general elections. In 1938 he sought the Democratic nomination for U. S. Senator, having the support of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was trying to purge Senator Guy M. Gillette, but he lost in the primary.\n\nIn 1950 he made a second unsuccessful attempt to win the Democratic nomination for Iowa's second seat in the U.S. Senate. He finished a distant third in the primary, behind Al Loveland and Nelson Kraschel. In 1952 he sought unsuccessfully the Democratic nomination for Governor of Iowa, losing in the primary to Herschel C. Loveless.\n\nIn 1969, after Iowa's state senator resigned one year before his term ended, Wearin was nominated by his party as the Democratic candidate in the special election to succeed him. However, Wearin's Republican opponent, Earl Bass, won the election.\n\nAfter the end of his active political career, Wearin raised purebred Angus cattle on the family estate, \"Nishna Vale,\" near Hastings. Despite deterioration of his eyesight, he wrote books and articles, studied Iowa history, and worked in conservation.\n\nAs a writer of westerns, his books include \"Before the Colors Fade,\" (1971), \"Along Our Country Road,\" (1985), \"I Remember Yesteryear\" (1974), \"Heinhold's First and Last Chance Saloon: Jack London's Rendezvous\" (1974) and \"Grass Grown Trails\" (1981). His writings were cited in his 1985 induction into the Cowboy Hall of Fame. Outside of that genre, he wrote many other books, including \"Century on an Iowa Farm\" (1959), \"I Remember Hastings\" (1965), \"Political Americana\" (1967), \"Clarence Arthur Ellsworth,: Artist of the Old West, 1885-1964,\" (1967) \"Country Roads to Washington \" (1976), and \"Rhymes of a Plain Countryman\" (1980).\n\nHe died at Glenwood, Iowa and is buried at Malvern, Iowa.\n"}

That is, until his parents invite Vic (Kevin Bacon) over. A charming wilderness survival guide, Vic convinces them that two weeks off the grid is exactly what Alan needs to become a man.\n\nAlan reluctantly joins Vic and three other teens –– Chris (Matt Adler), Mitch (Jonathan Ward) and George (K.C. Martel) –– for a trek into the great outdoors, which turn out to be not so great for him. He is taunted by Chris and George and learns that Vic is deadly serious about his job, but he does manage to form a friendship with Mitch. On their first night, Alan carves his initials into a tree. After Vic finds out, he calls the others to vote on his punishment. They take away his knife.\n\nIn another incident, the group goes swimming at a nearby river. Alan and Mitch listen to a ball game on the radio, but Vic catches them, and confiscates the radio, reminding them that they've left that kind of thing behind. Later on, Vic asks Alan to be his bowman while white water rafting. Alan is unprepared and loses an oar. Vic forgives him for it, but Alan feels Vic set him up to fail.\n\nLater, Vic asks the boys to cross a dangerous swing bridge over a deep ravine. Alan crosses it with the others but leaves their tent poles behind. When he later realizes this, Vic sends him back to collect them alone. As Alan attempts to re-cross, a rope snaps, causing Alan to nearly fall into the ravine, and he fails to cross the bridge. Embarrassed, Alan returns and explains that he couldn’t find the poles but Vic catches him in his lie; he watched him all along and even retrieved the poles.\n\nThe tension between Alan and Vic reaches a breaking point when the group go fishing on an island. Instead of following Vic’s lead and catching them with his bare hands, Alan invents a fish trap. Furious, Vic tosses the fish he caught and forces him to clean the others’ fish. Alan refuses and Vic leaves with the group, stranding him on the island until the fish are cleaned, instructing him to signal when he's done. Alan stays on the island overnight, through a thunderstorm, and defiantly does not complete the task.\n\nThe next morning, Vic sends the other boys to retrieve Alan. When they return, they find that Vic has disappeared. The boys fight with each other about what to do and take cover in a cave after another thunderstorm hits. The next morning, out of the blue, Vic returns and praises their survival skills. Alan demands to know where Vic went and why he ditched them, but Vic does not answer.\n\nAlthough everyone has grown weary of Vic, they follow him on their next group activity of climbing Devil’s Tooth –– a treacherous peak. When they reach a gap, Vic creates a pendulum for the boys to swing to the other side. Chris, George and Mitch successfully make it, but Alan, the last to go, in a mix of fear and distrust of Vic, slips and is left hanging over the gap. Vic instructs Alan to make an effort and get a footing off the cliff to climb back to safety, but Alan insists he needs help. Vic refuses, and leaves Alan hanging until he gets himself out, against the protests of the other boys.\n\nChris challenges Vic’s leadership and Vic retaliates by holding him over the edge of a cliff. Left to his own devices, Alan eventually does manage to climb back to the cliff, and creates enough momentum to swing across the gap, and he catches up to the others. Everyone, including Vic, is proud of Alan for successfully rescuing himself, but Alan declares this was the last straw, and the other boys agree. They demand Vic take them home, but Vic again refuses, so the boys set off on their own. After they successfully find their way back to the bottom of the mountains, Vic catches up to them. In the confrontation that follows, Chris throws rocks at Vic and hits him with an oar –– sending him over the edge of a ravine. Vic suffers a head wound, and a broken leg. Alan creates a pulley and the group hoist him out of the ravine.\n\nAs the group’s new leader, Alan instructs the others to follow the river to the ranger station to find help, while he stays with Vic. Although Vic is stable, he's losing blood, so Alan sits him in a canoe and they raft down a wild river, to get help themselves. Alan skillfully navigates the rapids but the canoe capsizes after plunging down a small waterfall. Alan brings Vic to the riverbanks, and the two share a moment of camaraderie. Soon enough, a rescue helicopter arrives, bringing them to safety. An older Alan mentions that the other three boys were rescued as well, and he and Vic have made their peace. Also, Alan has now taken a liking to visiting nature every summer... in the city park!\n\n\"White Water Summer\" was originally produced as \"Rites of Summer\" in 1985, and given its current name upon release in 1987. The film's action is framed by commentary from the now-older character of Alan (Sean Astin), as he remembers a camping trip led by Vic (Kevin Bacon). The narration was filmed two years after the film itself; Astin is noticeably older.\n\nThe film was photographed by John Alcott, a frequent collaborator of Stanley Kubrick. Alcott died shortly before the release of the film, which is dedicated to his memory. Scenes were shot in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, as well as in western Quebec, Canada, at the small French Quebec town of Fort-Coulonge, and New Zealand locales.\n\nColumbia Pictures released the film theatrically in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States; a wider release was planned, but never carried out.\n\n\nNine songs are included in the film:\nWritten by Bruce Hornsby and John Hornsby\nPerformed by Bruce Hornsby and The Range\nCourtesy of The RCA Records Label of BMG Music\nWritten by Bruce Hornsby and John Hornsby\nPerformed by Bruce Hornsby and The Range\nCourtesy of The RCA Records Label of BMG Music\nWritten by Steve Perry, Jonathan Cain and Neal Schon\nPerformed by Journey\nCourtesy of CBS Records\nWritten by Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy\nProduced by Rick Rubin\nPerformed by The Cult\nCourtesy of Sire Records\nby arrangement with Warner Special Products and Beggars Banquet Records Limited\nWritten by Nick Van Eede (as Nicholas Eede)\nProduced by Terry Brown & Cutting Crew\nPerformed by Cutting Crew\nCourtesy of Siren Records Ltd.\nComposed, Produced and Performed by Michael Boddicker\nWritten by Kaylee Adams and Charlie Mitchell\nProduced by Charlie Mitchell\nPerformed by Kaylee Adams\nCourtesy of Warner Bros.

{"id": "1830477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830477", "title": "Pseudoextinction", "text": "Pseudoextinction\n\nPseudoextinction (or phyletic extinction) of a species occurs when all members of the species are extinct, but members of a daughter species remain alive. The term pseudoextinction refers to the evolution of a species into a new form, with the resultant disappearance of the ancestral form. Pseudoextinction results in the relationship between ancestor and descendant still existing even though the ancestor species no longer exists.\n\nThe classic example is that of the non-avian dinosaurs. While the non-avian dinosaurs of the Mesozoic died out, their descendants, birds, live on today. As of now it is accepted that modern birds evolved from \"Archaeopteryx\", a small dinosaur with flight feathers from the Mesozoic period. Many other families of bird-like dinosaurs also died out as the heirs of the dinosaurs continued to evolve, but because their birds continue to thrive in the world today their ancestors are only pseudoextinct.\n\nFrom a taxonomic perspective, pseudoextinction is \"within an evolutionary lineage, the disappearance of one taxon caused by the appearance of the next.\" The pseudoextinction of a species can be arbitrary, simply resulting from a change in the naming of a species as it evolves from its ancestral form to its descendant form. Taxonomic pseudoextinction has to do with the disappearance of taxa that are categorized together by taxonomists. As they are just grouped together, their extinction is not reflected through lineage; therefore, unlike evolutionary pseudoextinction, taxonomic pseudoextinction does not alter the evolution of daughter species. From an evolutionary perspective, pseudoextinction entails the loss of a species as a result of the creation of a new one. As the primordial species evolves into its daughter species, either by anagenesis or cladogenesis, the ancestral species can be subject to extinction. Throughout the process of evolution, a taxon can disappear; in this case, pseudoextinction is considered an evolutionary event.\n\nFrom a genetic perspective, pseudoextinction is the \"disappearance of a taxon by virtue of its being evolved by anagenesis into another taxon.\" As all species must have an ancestor of a previous species, much of evolution is believed to occur through pseudoextinction. However, it is difficult to prove that any particular fossil species is pseudoextinct unless genetic information has been preserved. For example, it is sometimes claimed that the extinct \"Hyracotherium\" (an ancient horse-like animal commonly known as an eohippus) is pseudoextinct, rather than extinct, because several species of horse, including the zebra and the donkey, are extant today. However, it is not known, and probably cannot be known, whether modern horses actually descend from members of the genus \"Hyracotherium\", or whether they simply share a common ancestor.\n\nOne proposed mechanism of pseudoextinction is endocrine disruption (changing hormone levels). Additionally, when the primary sex-ratio (male to female ratio of a population) is male-biased, predicted levels of pseudoextinction increase. Because the variance of the population size increases with time, the probability of pseudoextinction increases with the length of the time horizon used.\n\nMammal systematist and paleobiologist David Archibald has estimated that as many as 25% of the extinctions recorded in three different early Puercan mammal lineages are pseudoextinctions.\nPseudotermination is an extreme form of pseudoextinction, when a lineage continues as a new species; phylogeny is often difficult to determine in such cases.\n\nExtirpation or regional disappearance can be a stage in pseudoextinction when progressive diachronous range contraction leads to final extinction by the elimination of the last refuge or population growth from this temporal bottleneck.\n\nThe notion of pseudoextinction is sometimes applied to wider taxa than species. For instance, the entire superorder Dinosauria, as traditionally conceived, would have to be considered as pseudoextinct, because feathered dinosaurs are considered by the majority of modern palaeontologists as the ancestors of modern-day birds. Pseudoextinction for such higher taxa appears to be easier to prove. However, pseudoextinct higher taxa are paraphyletic groups, which are rejected as formal taxa in phylogenetic nomenclature; either all dinosaurs are stem-group birds, or birds are derived dinosaurs, but there is no taxon Dinosauria, acceptable in cladistic taxonomy, that excludes the taxon Aves. Pseudoextinction cannot be applied to the genus or family levels as, “when a species evolves to a new form, causing the pseudoextinction of the ancestral form, the new species is normally assigned the same higher taxa as the ancestor.” When a family or genus goes extinct it must be true extinction, because pseudoextinction would mean that at least one member of the family or genus is still extant.\n\nPseudoextinction is an event that occurs much more frequently under the assumption of a Phyletic gradualism model of evolution, under which speciation is slow, uniform and gradual. The majority of speciation would occur through anagenesis under this model, resulting in a majority of species undergoing Pseudoextinction. However, the model of punctuated equilibrium is more widely accepted, with the proposal that most species remain in stasis, a state of very little evolutionary change, for a large proportion of the species' lifespan. This would result in increased cases of speciation through cladogenesis and true extinction, with fewer cases of Pseudoextinction. Nearly all species undergo true extinction under the model of punctuated equilibrium. Charles Darwin proposed the idea of stasis in his book, \"On the Origin of Species\". He suggested that species spend the majority of their evolutionary lifespan in the same form, having undergone very little morphological or genetic change.\n\nAnother concept of species on the tree of life is the composite species concept. It sees one species as occupying all internodes of the tree that have the same combination of (morphological, ecological, etc.) characters. Here, a species starts with the acquisition of a character and ends when another change is fixed in its lineage. This process - of one lineage turning into what is afterwards seen as another species because of the fixation of a novel character - is often called anagenesis. But we have a similar situation here where a species is considered to end by definition but is not really extinct (it survived, after all, in the form of one descendent species with a different character combination), and so we could also consider it to be pseudoextinction. On the other hand, under the composite species concept a species continues through a lineage split if only one of the two resulting lineages acquires a new character, an event that is sometimes called speciation through \"budding\". The one that has a new character is now a new species but the other lineage, the one that looks identical to the common ancestor, is considered to be the common ancestor. An example would be a widespread breeding group remaining unchanged while \"budding off\" a small isolated population that accumulates changes until it cannot interbreed with the others any more.\n\n\n"}

The rule of Edward Gierek led to a short period of economic prosperity. With the aid of foreign loans, Gierek instituted a programme to modernise industry and increase the availability of consumer goods. The standard of living increased markedly and for a time he was hailed a miracle-worker. The economy, however, began to falter during the 1973 oil crisis and by 1976 price increases became necessary, mostly to ease the repayment of these loans.\n\nTo obtain much needed foreign currency from Polish society, authorities permitted in 1972 the creation of a network of shops under a state-owned bank named Pekao. There, the foreign hard currency could be exchanged for both foreign and domestic goods, many of which were unavailable to Poles at that time. Since ownership of hard currency as cash was forbidden and all dollars and Deutschmarks had to be deposited to dollar bank accounts, authorities introduced Bon PeKaO cheques, which were tied to the U.S. Dollar in a 1:1 ratio and could be used as currency in Pekao shops. Later on the Pekao bank created a separate company, Przedsiębiorstwo Eksportu Wewnętrznego – the Pewex. While the letter \"x\" is not present in the Polish alphabet, it was used nevertheless.\n\nDuring the Communist era, Poles were allowed to own Dollars, something that was not allowed in other Eastern Bloc states. Many Poles at the time also received remittance from friends and family members in the United States. The US Dollars received by Poles could either be used for foreign travel or used at the Pewex shops. Products that Poles would otherwise have to wait a long time and settle for poor imitations could be had immediately by buying them at a Pewex shop.\n\nPewex offered a number of items not available for purchase on the normal market. Items were purchased outside of the rationing system then in place, and customers did not have to queue up for items. Items sold include liquor, cigarettes, household appliances, cars and furniture.\n\nShopping at Pewex at the time was seen as a rather exclusive affair, due to the high cost of its items when compared to the average salary at the time. This turned Pewex into a symbol of luxury and privilege.\n\nAt one point, Pewex had a network of 80 shops in Poland. In 1987, Pewex was noted in a report issued by the United States Joint Publications Research Service to have had a sales volume of about 70 billion złoty, based on the then-official exchange rate to the US Dollar, with a revenue of 20 billion złoty.\n\nAs part of the peaceful transition of the economic system in Poland after 1989's revolution in Poland, the Polish economy was privatised and the ownership of foreign currency was deregulated. This made the Pekao cheques obsolete and soon afterwards most of the goods that had only been available from Pewex stores started to be sold in private shops as well.\n\nIn 1991, Marian Zacharski, a former Polish spy who was sentenced to life in prison by American authorities for stealing military secrets and was subsequently released in a spy exchange, became the chain's chief.\n\nIn 1993, Pewex filed for bankruptcy for the first time. In December 1995, it was announced that a debt restructuring deal will see the a bank named Polski Bank Rozwoju, along with two French companies, swap a debt worth 93.6 million złoty at the time for a majority stake in 1996.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1830487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830487", "title": "Johann Gottfried Seume", "text": "Johann Gottfried Seume\n\nJohann Gottfried Seume (29 January 176313 June 1810) was a German author.\n\nSeume was born in Poserna (now part of Lützen, Saxony-Anhalt). He was educated first at Borna, then at the Nikolai school and University of Leipzig. The study of Shaftesbury and Bolingbroke wakened his interest in theology, and, breaking off his studies, he set out for Paris. On the way he was seized by Hessian recruiting officers and sold to England, whereupon he was drafted to Canada.\n\nAfter his return in 1783 he deserted at Bremen, but was captured and brought to Emden; a second attempt at flight also failed. In 1787, however, a citizen of Emden became surety for him to the amount of 80 talers, and he was allowed to visit his home. He did not return, but paid off his debt in Emden with the remuneration he received for translating an English novel.\n\nHe taught languages for a time in Leipzig, and became tutor to a Graf Igelstrom, whom, in 1792, he accompanied to Warsaw. Here he became secretary to General von Igelstrom, and, as a Russian officer, experienced the terrors of the Polish insurrection (Kościuszko Uprising). In 1796 he was again in Leipzig and, resigning his Russian commission, entered the employment of the publisher Göschen.\n\nIn December 1801, he set out on his famous nine months' walk to Sicily, described in his \"Spaziergang nach Syrakus\" (1803). Some years later he visited Russia, Finland, Sweden and Denmark, a journey which is described in \"Mein Sommer im Jahr 1805\" (1807). His health now began to fail, and he died on 13 June 1810, in Teplitz (now also known as Teplice).\n\nHis reputation rests on the two books just mentioned, to which may be added his autobiography, \"Mein Leben\" (1813, continued by C.A.H. Clodius). These works reflect Seume's sterling character and sturdy patriotism; his style is clear and straightforward; his descriptions realistic and vivid. As a dramatist (\"Miltiades\", 1808), and as a lyric poet (\"Gedichte\", 1801), he had but little success.\n\nSeume's \"Gesammelte Schriften\" were first edited by J. P. Zimmermann (1823–1826); his \"Sämtliche Werke\" (1826–1827) passed through seven editions. The most recent edition (as of 1911) is J. G. Seume's \"Prosaische und poetische Werke\" (10 vols, 1879). See Oskar Planer and Camillo Reißmann, \"J. G. Seume. Geschichte seines Lebens und seiner Schriften\" (1898).\n\nSeume died in Teplitz in June 1810. Ludwig van Beethoven spent three weeks in August 1811 and another short period during the summer of 1812 at Teplitz. He is known to have visited Seume's grave, and wrote to a music teacher from Cassel, Georg Christoph Grosheim (1764–1841), telling him of the feelings of admiration for Seume that that occasion had produced in him. In his letter to Beethoven of 10 November 1819, Grosheim talks of a \"marriage\" of Seume's poem \"Die Beterin\" (\"The Pleader\") with Beethoven's \"Moonlight\" Sonata. It is unclear whether this was a reference to an idea that had been previously discussed between the two men, or a new idea of Grosheim's. Thayer also reports that Grosheim had tried to persuade Beethoven to arrange the slow opening movement of the \"Moonlight\" Sonata for voice and piano, to the words of Seume's poem \"Die Beterin\". Beethoven is said to have agreed to the idea, but nothing ever came of it.\n\nNevertheless, in the minds of some writers the association between \"Die Beterin\" and the sonata came to assume more solidity than it ever had in reality. \"Die Beterin\" was also sometimes said to be a painting. In the 1954 edition of \"Grove's Dictionary of Music\", it is specifically denied that the \"Moonlight\" Sonata has any connection with \"a picture, \"Die Beterin\" (\"The Pleader\")\".\n\nBeethoven had two volumes of Seume's works in his possession when he died.\n\n"}

The film is ultimately a Buddhist parable about the nature of karma. There were some cuts in the Mainland China edition to meet the requirements for release there.\n\nThis is the second film starring Andy Lau in which he wears a prosthetic suit. In his previous film, \"Love on a Diet\", he wore a fat suit, while in this film, he wears a muscle suit.\n\n\"Running on Karma\" was a critical and commercial success, grossing HK$26,339,848 at the Hong Kong box office, making it the third-highest grossing film of the year in the territory, and received 13 nominations at the 23rd Hong Kong Film Awards, winning Best Film, Best Screenplay and Best Actor for Lau, who wins the award for the second time after being awarded for his performance in \"Running Out of Time\" in 2000. In addition, Lau's performance in the film also won him the Hong Kong Film Critics Society Award for Best Actor and the Chinese Film Media Awards for Best Actor of the Hong Kong/Taiwan region.\n\nBig (Andy Lau) was a Buddhist Monk, but he gave up this occupation when he realized he could see a person's past life, which would mean he would be able to predict what would happen to that person because of Karma. Big then became a bodybuilder and worked in a strip bar when he ran into Lee Fung-yee (Cecilia Cheung). Lee was working as an undercover cop in the CID which busted Big in his strip show, but Big became entangled in another police case to catch a murderer when he tried to escape.\n\nWhile Big was running away from Lee's pursuit, he saw a police dog and has visions of the dog's previous life. The dog was previously a child who beat up dogs, and the dog was shot by a stray bullet meant for the criminal. This was the first time that Big showed his ability to see the past, and later saw the past life of Lee, a Japanese soldier killing civilians.\n\nBig (after realizing that Lee was kind-hearted), decided to help her in the investigation of a homicide, but also swore to leave her after they solved the case. After Big had inspected the corpse, he saw the deceased's previous life. The deceased had betrayed the murderer in his previous life and hence killed by him in this life. Big also saw that in the previous life of the murderer, before the murderer died, he cut off a one-horn beetle's left arm and hence deduced that in the current life, there would be someone without a left arm who would help to find the present murderer. Big successfully helped the police to arrest the murderer and saved Lee's life in the process as well. Her karma gets broken as well but subsequently returned, as seen through Big's vision. He also stopped an angry police sergeant who was beating the murderer by saying to him, \"One thought Heaven, One thought Hell\"(一念天堂，一念地獄).\n\nLee, now realizing that she was, in her previous life, a Japanese soldier, made efforts to compensate for the atrocities she committed in her previous life. Deciding to repay Big before she dies, Lee decided to find Big's childhood friend's killer, and she thinks the killer is hiding in the mountains somewhere. She went to the mountains and on the sixth day of her journey, she encounters the killer at a part of the mountains where Big never went to find his friend's killer. The killer runs away from her while she tries to help him. Then, the killer comes behind her, and drags her to a rocky place where she was hit by a rock in the head, and beheaded by the murderer. The whole incident was recorded by her video camera. The video camera was retrieved after a search party to look for her. Big saw the video after a police officer showed it to him and he gets angry and goes to the mountains. When he was on the mountains, he heard Lee's watch. He followed the sound to her buried body in the ground and her head in a tree. He became enraged and pursued a man, presuming he is Lee's killer into an underground temple. Big, expecting to find the killer in the temple but found his future self, a killer, bloodthirsty and vengeful. They argued and fought and came to terms peacefully in meditation.\n\nBig becomes a monk again and lives on the mountain. After five years, he meets his childhood friend's killer again, and in forgiveness, escorts him kindly to the police. In the end, at the \"place where Big couldn't jump over,\" we see the positive karma that Lee cultivated and radiated ultimately saved Big.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1830519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830519", "title": "Kilbirnie", "text": "Kilbirnie\n\nKilbirnie (Gaelic: \"Cill Bhraonaigh\") is a small town of 7,642 inhabitants situated in the Garnock Valley area of North Ayrshire, on the west coast of Scotland. It is around south-west of Glasgow and approximately from Paisley and Irvine respectively. Historically, the town's main industries were flax production and weaving before iron and steelmaking took over in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The suburb of Kilbirnie in the New Zealand capital of Wellington is named after the town.\n\nArchaeological digs conducted in the 19th century have shown that the area was inhabited during the Bronze Age. A crannog with a connecting causeway was discovered in Kilbirnie Loch. The town derived its name from the parish church, the \"Auld Kirk\". In 1740 there were only three houses; the population grew to 959 people by 1801. Half a century later, and the town had grown substantially. In 1851 Kilbirnie contained 5,484 people, due to the Industrial Revolution, hastened by the locality of the Ayr and Glasgow railways. During this time the town was a hub of industrial activity with 2 flax-spinning mills, linen-thread mills, wincey factories, 5 fishing-net factories, 2 rope-works, engineering works, mines and ironworks. The steelworks opened in 1841 and quickly became the main industry in the area causing an inpouring of people and during the early to mid 20th Century the town grew to its height of around 10,000 people. However, the industry entered a decline and was eventually closed. The Decoy Bride a film starring David Tennant and Kelly Macdonald was partially filmed in Kilbirnie.\n\nThe town was hit particularly hard by the closure of traditional industries. The town has the 9th lowest life expectancy among pensioners in the United Kingdom according to a report published in the Daily Mail newspaper in 2012. In addition Kilbirnie has highest bankruptcy rate in Scotland. Kilbirnie has a rate of 71 insolvencies per 10,000 people, just ahead of Clydebank and Gorebridge.\n\nGlengarnock Steel Works opened its blast furnaces around 1841 which caused a massive influx of people from all over the country, as well as all over the world. Initially these works were owned by Merry & Cunninghame before being taken over by David Colville & Sons and eventually nationalised as part of British Steel Corporation and finally closed in 1985. The steelworks in Glengarnock provided employment for most men of the community. The entire collection of staff magazines of the steelworks at Glengarnock have been preserved and are held at the Mitchell Library. This provides content such as spotlights on employees and departments, and contains photographs over 100 years old.\n\nThese mills are famous for their nets, used by the British Army and BT Tower. They are one of very few companies in the United Kingdom who have expertise in this area. W & J Knox Threadmills was owned by the Knox family who were prominent, not only in Ayrshire but in the South of England too, becoming important members of society. Some of the mansion houses they built still remain, the Knox Institute was donated by a member of the Knox family and housed Kilbirnie's first public library and one of the cemeteries in the town contains an underground vault where the family are interred, next to the main Knox monument. Who's Who editions of the period list many members of the family.\n\nSince the closure of the steel works in the 1980s, the area has been an unemployment blackspot with distinct social problems. The town has very few local employers, and people generally commute out of the town to work. Glengarnock railway station serves the town and has three trains per hour to Paisley and Glasgow. There are regular bus services to Glasgow, Paisley, Largs and Irvine provided by Western Buses and McGill's.\n\nAmongst many other old buildings in the Town, stands the Walker Hall, a memorial hall dedicated to Dr Walker, one of the first physicians in the town. In the 1950s and '60s it was a famous concert venue, coming second only to the Barrowlands. Famous bands to have played the hall include Gerry & The Pacemakers and Bill Haley & His Comets. These days however, it houses the town's Citizens Advice Bureau.\nOther sources of entertainment in the 1950s and 60s included two cinemas, both of which have long since closed. One of these cinemas is now the Radio City . An Association was formed in 1998 to identify ways of providing much needed local facilities. During the 1997 election campaign, Brian Wilson met with a group of local teenagers who stressed the need for facilities, and plans were developed to provide a Healthy Living Centre which would include fitness facilities, internet access, a healthy eating cafe and child care. Bids for funding were made to private organisations and the National Lottery.\n\nThe fair was considered the largest horse market in the west of Scotland. Robert Burns refers to the town in his poem \"\"The Inventory\"\" about a plough-horse that he purchased at the fair:\n\n\"\"My furr-ahin 's a wordy beast,\nAs e'er in tug or tow was traced.\nThe fourth's a Highland Donald hastle,\nA damn'd red-wud Kilburnie blastie!\"\"\n\nLocal football team Kilbirnie Ladeside F.C. derive their sobriquet \"\"the blasties\"\" from the poem, a suitable appellation and an epithet which remains to this day due to the town's past of steel and iron production, as a reference to the blast furnaces.\n\n\nThe \"Auld Kirk\" is one of the oldest churches in Scotland still in use both pre-and post-Reformation. Robert Burns allegedly came to the blacksmiths near the Kirk. It is from this Church that Kilbirnie takes its name.\n\nFather Thomas P Lee, a young Irish priest, was sent in 1859 to be the resident priest in Kilbirnie. It is unclear how he raised the money to build the church. He chose St. Brigid (devotion to the poor) to be the patron saint of the parish. Opened in 1862. The current parish priest is Father Mark Kelly.\n\nTracing its roots back to 1889, a full history of the assembly can be found in the middle if the article here:-\nhttp://www.plymouthbrethren.org/article/5989\n\n\n\n\nThe area is served by Stagecoach West Scotland and McGill's Bus Services.\n\n\nThe hills between Kilbirnie and Largs were often black spots for aircraft passing over and many crashed due to low fog. The crash sites are available to visit, with wreckage still visible and some of these now form part of Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park.\n\nLying 2 miles (3 km) north of Kilbirnie on a promontory overlooking the wooded ravine of the River Garnock is Glengarnock Castle, a ruined 15th century keep. Ladyland Castle, mostly demolished, lay nearby and Ladyland House still survives as designed by David Hamilton.\n\nKilbirnie Loch is long and nearly broad. Part of the area around the Loch is sliding possibly due to the old mining shafts under the area. A social centre built on the shores of the loch began to sink and had to be demolished.\n\n\n"}

A last-ditch effort to counteract it is designed and executed. It works far too well.\n\nCenturies if not millennia later, the planet is entirely covered in a thick, opaque cloud layer. Giant wolf packs roam the frozen wastes, and the mammoth has re-emerged from the elephant stock. Mankind ekes out a living in a few handfuls of settlements, connected by a network of massive armored trains. The network in turn is in the hands of the gargantuan Viking Union, which is merciless towards threats to its power. A few radicals, though, are willing to attempt a change, and managing to hijack a train of the Union, the \"Transarctica\", they set out in search of the \"sun\".\n\nThe game is divided into two modes; exploration and combat.\n\nThe train roams Eurasia using its various facilities and tools, gathering coal for currency and fuel, visiting towns to trade and to enhance the train, and searching for clues for its quest. The dystopic setting is rather well integrated, and for instance the use of slave labor is necessary to complete the game.\n\nThe interface is quite original but rather cumbersome. This part has been criticized for the under-efficiency of trading in comparison to mining.\n\nThe Viking Union is out for blood, and meeting with another train triggers a simple battle mode. Battles are real-time plus slow-paced and may be dull at first, but the amount of things to handle will multiply with time - though this hardly helps the common mop-up period at the end.\n\nThe two sides are positioned on parallel tracks some distance away from each other. Maneuvering is limited to horizontal movement. Combat assets include cannons (to attack enemy wagons), machine guns (to mow down ground troops, on both sides if timed poorly), infantry (jacks of all trades to operate on and in between trains, attack ground troops, set charges on hostile wagons and clear them from friendly ones) and mammoth cavalry (to attack ground troops and to shield and transport infantry). All other wagons, save the locomotives, are dead weight.\n\nCombat is won when the enemy is disarmed, the train is then looted for intact wagons and materials and the contents of destroyed wagons are written off. The game is lost if the \"Transarctica\" loses a vital wagon. All engagements can be expected to take several minutes.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" in May 1994 criticized the train controls as both too simple and \"intentionally annoying\", train combat as \"painfully slow\", and other \"annoying, rough edges\". The magazine concluded that the game's \"blemishes derail an otherwise original and delightful premise\".\n\n"}

Like much of Gnostic teaching, it was only designed to be understood once a certain level of understanding was reached, and so appears to the casual observer to be quite obscure as to its meaning or purpose. The text has only been known for a brief time, and so there is not much academic research into them, however it does appear to be the case that the texts are some sort of manual for one or more unknown Gnostic ritual(s).\n\n"}

The orchestra performs primarily in the Marcus Center for the Performing Arts, in Uihlein Hall. The orchestra also serves as the orchestra for Florentine Opera productions. \nThe precursor ensemble to the orchestra was the Milwaukee Pops Orchestra, a part-time ensemble which had been founded 10 years earlier. In 1959, the orchestra formally changed its name to the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, with Harry John Brown as its first music director. During his nine-year tenure, Brown led the orchestra's transition from a semi-professional pops group to a fully professional, full-time symphony orchestra.\n\nDuring the tenure of Kenneth Schermerhorn, the orchestra's second music director, from 1968 to 1980, the orchestra had begun its 'State Tour' programme of concerts around Wisconsin, to such cities as Fish Creek, Fond du Lac, Marinette, Ripon, Rhinelander, Three Lakes, West Bend, and Whitewater, Wisconsin, as well as Naperville, Illinois. The orchestra also initiated its concerts for students, as well as giving its first performance at Carnegie Hall. The Milwaukee Symphony Chorus was also established during this time. Lukas Foss served as the orchestra's third music director, from 1981 to 1986, which saw a notable increase in performances of contemporary music and American compositions, along with the orchestra's first European tour in 1986.\n\nZdeněk Mácal was the orchestra's fourth music director, from 1986 to 1995. The orchestra began to record for Koss Classics during this period, and established its Arts in Community Education programme in 1990. From 1995 to 1997, Stanisław Skrowaczewski served as the orchestra's artistic advisor, prior to the advent of Andreas Delfs as the orchestra's fifth music director. Delfs was music director from 1997 to 2009. During his tenure, in 1999, the orchestra performed in Cuba, the first American symphony orchestra to do so since the U.S. embargo against Cuba was implemented in 1962. Delfs became the orchestra's conductor laureate after the conclusion of his tenure in 2009.\n\nEdo de Waart was the orchestra's most recent music director, from 2009 to 2017. His appointment was unusual in that de Waart had not conducted the orchestra prior to his appointment. Upon the conclusion of his tenure, the orchestra granted de Waart the title of conductor laureate. The orchestra's current assistant conductor is Yaniv Dinur. Past principal pops conductors have included Doc Severinsen, who holds the title of Principal Pops Conductor Emeritus, and Marvin Hamlisch. \n\nIn December 2017, the orchestra purchased the former Warner Grand Theatre, with the intention to relocate there in 2020.\n\nIn May 2018, Ken-David Masur first guest-conducted the orchestra. The orchestra immediately re-engaged him for a subsequent guest-conducting appearance in September 2018. On the basis of these concerts, in November 2018, the orchestra announced the appointment of Masur as its next music director, effective with the 2019-2020 season, with an initial contract of 4 seasons. Masur took the title of music director-designate with immediate effect.\n\nThe orchestra has presented more than 100 world and American premieres of works by composers such as Lukas Foss, Philip Glass, Geoffrey Gordon, Daron Hagen, Roy Harris, Erich Korngold, Gian Carlo Menotti, Marc Neikrug, Matthias Pintscher, Daniel Schnyder, Jean Sibelius, Roberto Sierra, Gunther Schuller, William Schuman, Ottorino Respighi, Richard Rodgers, and others. Over 22 compositions have been by MSO musicians.\n\nThe MSO has also released 14 recordings on the Koss Classics and Telarc labels. These include such projects as the complete symphonies of Antonín Dvořák; an all-Kodaly disc; an acclaimed recording of Beethoven's \"Symphony No. 9\"; Berlioz' \"Symphonie Fantastique\"; Prokofiev’s \"Alexander Nevsky\"; and Smetana's \"Ma Vlast\". On September 16, 2005, the MSO became the first American orchestra to sell recordings of recent concerts for download on iTunes and through the orchestra's web site.\n\nThe \"Cuba Concerts\" CD features a live recording made during the MSO's 1999 Cuba Millennium Tour. 1999 also saw the release of an \"a cappella\" CD featuring the Milwaukee Symphony Chorus. In 2002, the MSO released a CD featuring Prokofiev’s \"Romeo and Juliet\" and Tchaikovsky’s \"The Nutcracker\".

Suggs began his solo career in 1995, while still a member of Madness. Since then, he has released two studio albums and two compilation albums. His solo hits include \"I'm Only Sleeping\", \"Camden Town\", \"Cecilia\" and \"Blue Day\".\n\nSuggs has also been an actor, with roles in films, theatre and television. He is married and is the father of two children.\n\nGraham McPherson was born on 13 January 1961 in Hastings, Sussex, England to William Rutherford McPherson (1935–1975) and jazz singer Edith Gower. The couple had married in Paddington in 1960 and Suggs was raised in Hastings by his mother. His father had left by the time Suggs was three. In a 2009 interview, before learning that his father had died decades ago, Suggs responded when asked about what happened to him:\n\nI don't know, but what I've heard hasn't been good: heroin, injecting his eyeballs with paraffin, being sectioned. He must be dead now. I mean, he would have got in touch if he was alive, wouldn't he? Yeah, he must be dead, poor bugger.\n\nSuggs spent three years of his childhood in Haverfordwest, in Pembrokeshire, Wales and had just started at a grammar school when his mother moved to North London. He then went to the Quintin Kynaston comprehensive school at Swiss Cottage, North London. On the official Madness website, he has stated:\n\nI was born in Hastings on a stormy evening on 13 January 1961. I only lived with my mum, so we were free agents. She was a singer in the pubs and clubs. We moved to Liverpool then London. I lived with relations in Wales for a while and came back to London. Because I was an only child, I was pretty insular and stubborn. All the upheaval made me lazy academically, so by the time I got to Quintin Kynaston school in St John's Wood I didn't bother much, I stayed onto the sixth form for social security reasons, and got two O-levels and a CSE on the way. I met Mike Barson hanging around Hampstead School.\n\nSuggs got his nickname from randomly sticking a pin in an encyclopaedia of jazz musicians (hitting Peter Suggs) while he was still in school, to avoid being labelled as the member of an ethnic minority owing to his Scottish name. To capitalise on the name he went as far as to create a myth about it, writing lines like \"Suggs is our leader\" on the walls and only answering to that name.\n\nAfter leaving school, he worked at a butcher's for eight months, his first proper job. He also worked as a painter and decorator. The first gig he went to was the Who supported by the Sensational Alex Harvey Band in 1976.\n\nIn 1976 Mike Barson, Chris Foreman and Lee Thompson formed the North London Invaders, which later became the band Madness. The original members recruited were John Hasler, Cathal Smyth and vocalist Dikron Tulane. This six-piece line-up was stable until 1977, when Suggs took over the lead vocals and Tulane left the band. After a decline in hits, the band broke up in 1986. Suggs has said that he felt \"a bit lost\" after the band split up, and he saw a psychotherapist on four occasions.\n\nAfter Madness' reformation for Madstock! in 1992 and 1994, Suggs went to work on his first solo album with the production help of reggae producers Sly and Robbie. In 1995 \"The Lone Ranger\" was released on Warner Music and peaked on the UK Albums Chart at No. 14. The first single to be released from the album was a cover of the Beatles song \"I'm Only Sleeping\" entering the UK Top 10 at No. 7. Its music video featured appearances from Madness bandmates Mike Barson and Chas Smash. This was followed by \"Camden Town\", a homage to Suggs's favourite part of London, which reached No. 14 in the UK.\n\nIn December of that year, Suggs released \"The Christmas E.P.\" featuring his song \"The Tune\" (co-written with Mike Barson) plus covers of \"Sleigh Ride\" and \"Alright\" by Supergrass. In 1996 the third single from the album, a version of the Simon & Garfunkel song \"Cecilia\", became his most successful release, peaking at No. 4 in the UK and being certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry. The final single to be released from the album was \"No More Alcohol\", charting at No. 24.\n\nIn 1997, Suggs recorded the song \"Blue Day\" for Chelsea F.C. with Chelsea players. It was the official song for the team for the FA Cup, which Chelsea eventually won. The song reached No. 22 in the UK charts.\n\nIn 1998, Suggs released his second solo album, \"The Three Pyramids Club\", on Warner Music, which was produced by Steve Lironi. The first and only single to be released was \"I Am\" charting at No. 38 in the UK. The song was also featured on the soundtrack to \"The Avengers\". The album includes a collaboration with reggae artist General Levy and the trombone talents of ska legend Rico Rodriguez.\n\nAfter completing his solo releases, Suggs returned to work with Madness on their first original album in fourteen years. \"Wonderful\" was released in 1999 and was followed by the cover album \"The Dangermen Sessions Vol. 1\" in 2005. In 2009, Madness released \"The Liberty of Norton Folgate\" which reached No. 5 in the UK Album Charts.\n\n\"Suggs – The Platinum Collection\" was released on 30 July 2007 on Warner Music, featuring a selection of Suggs best tracks from his two solo albums along with \"Blue Day\" and a remixed version of \"Cecilia\".\n\nIn 2008, Suggs contributed vocals to a cover of Al Bowlly's \"Hang Out the Stars in Indiana\" for the soundtrack for \"The Edge of Love\" composed by Angelo Badalamenti. Suggs also made a cameo in the film, singing the track.\n\nSuggs worked with Morrissey between 1989 and 1990, singing backing vocals on the tracks \"Piccadilly Palare\" and \"Sing Your Life\". From early 1990 to 1992, he co-managed The Farm and co-produced their first album \"Spartacus\" which reached number-one in the UK Album Charts and spawned the international hit \"All Together Now\". He also produced their first single \"Hearts and Minds\" in 1984.\n\nSuggs has collaborated with Jools Holland twice on his \"Small World Big Band\" albums, firstly in 2001 with the song \"Oranges and Lemons Again\" and then with \"Jack O The Green\" in 2003. He also played with Holland and his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra in 2003 for a television special where they performed two songs with veteran ska singer Prince Buster.\n\nIn July 2005, shortly after the terrorist attacks in London, Suggs and Chas Smash performed the Bob Marley song \"So Much Trouble in the World\" with Billy Bragg at a concert in London's Brockwell Park in aid of the victims. Also in 2005, Suggs collaborated with electronic group Audio Bullys on the track \"This Road\" from their Top 40 album \"Generation\". In 2006, Suggs performed the Madness song \"My Girl\" with The Ordinary Boys at the Brixton Academy which was released as a B-side on their UK hit single \"Nine2five\".\n\nIn May 2008, Suggs and Chas Smash joined the Pet Shop Boys on stage at a gig in London's Heaven nightclub where they performed a dance version of the Madness song \"My Girl\". In 2010, Suggs and Mike Barson again worked with the Audio Bullys on their album \"Higher Than the Eiffel\". They appear on the tracks \"Twist Me Up\" and \"Goodbye\".\n\nSuggs has acted in films such as \"The Tall Guy\" and \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" (1998). He starred in the Channel 4 drama \"The Final Frame\" (1990), in which he played a pop star named East. He also played a pop star (called Jason Wood) in the \"Press Gang\" episode \"Friends Like These\" in 1990. Suggs also appeared in the 2008 romantic drama \"The Edge of Love\" starring Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller, playing the part of \"the crooner\" (also credited as Al Bowlly) and singing Bowlly's hit \"Hang Out the Stars in Indiana\".\n\nIn late 2011, Suggs began a nationwide UK tour of a new one man stage show entitled \"LIVESUGGS\". In the show, Suggs shared various anecdotes from his childhood to the present day, intertwined with musical numbers. The show was well received by critics.\n\nIn 2003 Suggs appeared as Joe's dad in the stage musical \"Our House\", featuring the songs of Madness, for a limited run in London's West End. The show then ran at Isis Prison, Woolwich. In November 2012, Suggs reprised his role of Joe's dad in the 10th Anniversary Concert of the musical \"Our House\" in aid of Help for Heroes.\n\nSuggs was a principal and original DJ on BBC Radio 6 Music when it launched in March 2002. He worked with Bob Monkhouse on the BBC Radio 4 musical sitcom \"I Think I've Got a Problem\", also starring comedian Phil Cornwell and written by Andrew McGibbon.\n\nHe became a DJ on Virgin Radio with the show \"Virgin Party Classics\", and was nominated for a Radio Academy Award in 2005. In 2006, Virgin launched the \"Party Classics\" radio channel, available via digital television. The channel was hosted by Suggs, but was short-lived, pulled just four months after it launched. He regularly featured on Virgin Radio competitions where listeners could win the chance to meet him and have a drink with him. On one such occasion, well-known children's book writer Simon I. Boy chatted about pop records that Suggs was pleased he had no connection with, particularly a 1974 Decca recording entitled \"Name It You Got It\" by Micky Moonshine. The year 2007 saw him presenting a new show on the station five days a week entitled \"Afternoon Tea with Suggs\" which ran every weekday afternoon between 14:0016:00. In August 2007, the show was given an extra hour and was on every weekday 13:0016:00. It was produced by Mark Bingham, and the promotion of the show was voiced by Brian Sewell.\n\nOn 3 December, Suggs quit Virgin and Neil Francis took over his weekday afternoon slot with immediate effect. On 27 September, Suggs and Madness closed down Regent Street to perform for Absolute Radio's first birthday. On 2 May 2013, he appeared on the \"Cultural Exchange\" feature of the BBC Radio 4 series \"Front Row\", where he nominated a poem by John Betjeman (\"On a Portrait of a Deaf Man\"), as a piece of art work which he had found particularly meaningful.\n\nSuggs appeared twice with Madness on the British TV comedy show \"The Young Ones\", first on the episode titled \"Boring\" in which the band performed \"House of Fun\". On the second series, the band performed \"Our House\" on the penultimate episode \"Sick\".\n\nSuggs has hosted a celebrity karaoke game show on the UK's Channel 5, titled \"Night Fever\". He was a team captain in the BBC music trivia game show \"A Question of Pop\", hosted by Jamie Theakston, opposite Noddy Holder. Suggs has also appeared as a guest on the BBC Two show \"Never Mind the Buzzcocks\".\n\nHe has co-presented two series of sixty-minute programmes called \"Salvage Squad\", one restoring a Model T Ford, and one restoring a Ruston-Bucyrus 10RB in which a group of engineers restored rare old machinery. Some other items restored included a steamroller, a ploughing engine called \"Margaret\", a Blackpool \"Coronation\" tram, a Scammell Mechanical Horse, a Revopak garbage truck, various boats, World War II tanks, early C20 motor launches, railway locomotives and vintage cars.\n\nIn 2005, he filmed a series called \"Disappearing London\" for ITV in the London area, in which he investigated architectural and other curiosities that are vanishing. The series won three Royal Television Society awards with Suggs winning the award for \"Presenter of the Year\". A second series was filmed in 2006 for transmission in early 2007. In 2005 he filmed a similar one-off programme for the BBC entitled \"A Picture of London by Suggs\", which featured the newly penned song \"Cracks in the Pavement\". Suggs has twice been a guest presenter on the BBC's long-running chart show \"Top of the Pops\", once in 1995 and again in 2005.\n\nIn 2006, Suggs was the main presenter of the BBC London series \"Inside Out\", a weekly programme for Londoners looking at surprising stories in the capital. He was part of Declan Donnelly's Boy Band on \"Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway\" the same year and performed \"It Only Takes a Minute\" by Take That.\n\nIn 2007, Suggs starred in a series of Birds Eye commercials which feature the Madness song \"Our House\". A popular online game featuring Suggs was also based on the commercials. In December 2007, he narrated a one-off documentary for ITV on the London music venue the Hammersmith Palais, which had closed down in 2007. The programme was broadcast on BBC Four on Christmas Eve.\n\nIn February 2008, Teachers TV broadcast Suggs in a one-off \"Teaching Challenge\". The challenge required Suggs to return to his secondary school, Quintin Kynaston School in North London, and teach a music lesson to a group of GCSE students. In this lesson he was assisted by renowned vocalist Paul Curtis, his voice coach Been Cross and his valet S.I. Boy. The class performed Curtis's \"Name It You Got It\". Also in 2008, he presented his own chat show titled \"Suggs in the City\". The show, set in the Soho members club The Colony Room, aired on ITV London on Thursday nights. In October 2008, he presented a new culture series called \"Suggs' Italian Job\" which was aired on Sky Arts, following the singer around Italy's most culturally significant hot spots.\n\nIn 2009, Suggs performed with Zoë Ball in \"Let's Dance\" For Comic Relief dancing to \"You Can Never Tell\" from \"Pulp Fiction\" but was eliminated. He also appeared in an episode of Australian music quiz show \"Spicks and Specks\" on 15 April that year.\n\nIn 2015, Suggs appeared as a panelist on \"QI\", in series L episode 15.\n\nIn 2016, he performed with Madness on the ITV comedy Benidorm (TV Series)\n\nIn 2017, Suggs unearthed British war history alongside detectorist Stephen Taylor in the 8-episode series \"WW2 Treasure Hunters\" for TV channel HISTORY, returning for a second season in November 2018 which included a special WW1 episode.\n\nIn August 2009 Suggs published his first book, \"\", which is partly based on his TV series \"Disappearing London\". In October 2013 Suggs released his autobiography, \"Suggs: That Close\".\n\nSuggs learned of his father's death in 2012, through reading his own Wikipedia entry. In August 2012, he appeared at the Queen's Hall in Edinburgh as part of the Festival Fringe. In his show \"Suggs: My Life Story in Word and Music\", he talked about his early life and his search to find out more information about his father. He referenced his Wikipedia entry and stated that some published information relating to his early life was untrue, adding that he would get bored in interviews and make things up. He confirmed that although he was born in Hastings, the family moved around and he spent much of his early life in Wales. He stated that his father left when Suggs was three, not before he was born.\n\nSuggs is married to singer Bette Bright, who is the vocalist of the 1970s British band Deaf School. They met through their connection with Clive Langer, married in 1981 and live in Holloway. They have two daughters, Scarlett and Viva. Suggs also owns a holiday home in the Italian countryside.\n\nSuggs is a patron of the charity Children in Need, and has frequently appeared on the annual television fundraiser, performing various Madness tracks with other celebrities. He has also been involved with Cancer Research UK and their \"Busking Cancer\" campaign, for which he performed live with Rod Stewart on in May 2009. Following the death of his sister-in-law Alanah in 2012 from pancreatic cancer, he organised a fundraising night for Pancreatic Cancer UK called An Evening with Suggs and Friends. Another event was held at Porchester Hall in London in March 2014. A third charity gala took place in March 2015.\n\nSuggs is a member of the \"Useless Information Society\" (founded 1995), a society of journalists, writers and entertainers which focuses on useless esoteric information and has released books such as \"The Book of Useless Information\". Other members include or have included Keith Waterhouse, Richard Littlejohn, Noel Botham, Ken Stott and Brian Hitchen.\n\nSuggs is a fan of Chelsea F.C., made apparent by the FA Cup related song \"Blue Day\" which he wrote and then performed along with the rest of the 1996–1997 Chelsea squad.\n\n\n\n"}

The Winter Garden Theatre is seven storeys above the Elgin Theatre. They are the last surviving Edwardian stacked theatres in the world.\n\nThe pair of theatres were originally built as the flagship of Marcus Loew's theatre chain in 1913. The building was designed by architect Thomas W. Lamb, who also designed the Ed Mirvish Theatre nearby.\n\nBoth theatres were built to show vaudeville acts and the short silent movies of the time. Each theatre was intended for a different class of patron. The gold-and-marble, domed, 'hard-top' lower theatre (originally called Loew's Yonge Street Theatre) was home to continuous vaudeville and movies. The upper-level Winter Garden is an 'atmospheric' country garden under the stars, painted with murals of plants and garden trellises, with tree trunk columns and lantern lights. The upper theatre was built for the 'Big Time' vaudeville market and had reserved seats at premium prices, catering to affluent patrons. As well as competing in a different market, the upper theatre could be used for experimentation with acts, without the risk of closing the lower theatre.\n\nBy 1928, feature-length silent films were popular, but sound films were just coming into their own. In 1928, the lower theatre was converted to show sound films and the upper theatre was closed. The Winter Garden remained shuttered for about sixty years. Left inside it was a large collection of vaudeville flats and scenery, now the world's largest surviving collection. In 1969, Loews sold the Elgin to Famous Players. By the 1970s, the Elgin was showing mainly B movies and soft-core pornography.\n\nSince 1979, the Elgin Theatre has served as one of the hosts to the annual Toronto International Film Festival.\nIn 1981, the Ontario Heritage Foundation bought the structure from Famous Players. From March 1985 through March 1987 the musical \"Cats\" was very successfully presented in the essentially unrestored Elgin, showing the viability of the theatre. The building closed in 1987 for a full restoration and reopened in 1989.\n\nIn 1991, Dr. David Griesinger and Steve Barbar of Lexicon, Inc., at the request of acousticians Neil Muncy and Robert Tanner, installed the first production LARES system, an electroacoustic enhancement system that augments architectural acoustics, in the Elgin Theatre. This initial LARES system used two microphones placed at the balcony's front edge to pick up sound from the stage. The microphone signals were digitized and processed in two mainframe computers, and the resulting signals were sent to 56 loudspeakers in the main ceiling and 60 under the balcony, for the purpose of providing additional intelligibility and ambience.\n\nThe Elgin Theatre housed the world premiere of the \"Napoleon\" musical in 1994, which later transferred to London's West End in 2000. In 1995, it was home to \"The Who's Tommy\" musical. It also Since 1996, Ross Petty Productions has staged pantomimes at the Elgin Theatre each Christmas season.\n\nFrom February 10 to 14, 2004, Conan O'Brien taped four episodes of NBC's \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" from the Elgin Theatre. The visit came about via the Toronto City Council's CDN$1 million (~US$750,000 at the time) payment to NBC to have the American television program visit Toronto for a week worth of shows, part of the overall council-funded PR effort of promoting Toronto as a tourist destination for Americans in the wake of the widely publicized summer 2003 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic which adversely impacted the city's tourism industry.\n\nThe Elgin Theatre played host to the taping of \"Bryan Adams in Concert\" for the American broadcast of \"Great Performances\" on PBS. The show was filmed in July 2014 and first aired on March 1, 2015.\n\nThe cover photos for Rush's 1981 live album \"Exit...Stage Left\" were shot at the Winter Garden and the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium.\n\nThe Winter Garden is seen in the 1994 film Camilla. The location is also featured in the 2017 movie \"The Shape of Water\" and receives an acknowledgement in the closing credits. The music video for \"Changes\" by the Montreal band Stars is also set there.\n\n\n\n"}

A bright red or orange solid, it is used as pigment, in the manufacture of batteries, and rustproof primer paints. It is an example of a mixed valence compound, being composed of both Pb(II) and Pb(IV) in the ratio of two to one.\n\nLead(II,IV) oxide has a tetragonal crystal structure at room temperature, which then transforms to an orthorhombic (Pearson symbol \"oP\"28, Space group Pbam, No. 55) form at temperature . This phase transition only changes the symmetry of the crystal and slightly modifies the interatomic distances and angles.\n\nLead(II,IV) oxide is prepared by calcination of lead(II) oxide (PbO; also called litharge) in air at about 450–480 °C:\n\nThe resulting material is contaminated with PbO. If a pure compound is desired, PbO can be removed by a potassium hydroxide solution:\n\nAnother method of preparation relies on annealing of lead(II) carbonate (cerussite) in air:\n\nYet another method is oxidative annealing of white lead:\n\nIn solution, lead(II,IV) oxide can be prepared by reaction of potassium plumbate with lead(II) acetate, yielding yellow insoluble lead(II,IV) oxide monohydrate, PbO·HO, which can be turned into the anhydrous form by gentle heating:\n\nNatural minium is uncommon, forming only in extreme oxidizing conditions of lead ore bodies. The best known natural specimens come from Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia, where they formed as the result of a mine fire.\n\nRed lead is virtually insoluble in water and in ethanol. However, it is soluble in hydrochloric acid present in the stomach, and is therefore toxic when ingested. It also dissolves in glacial acetic acid and a diluted mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide.\n\nWhen heated to 500 °C, it decomposes to lead(II) oxide and oxygen. At 580 °C, the reaction is complete.\n\nNitric acid dissolves the lead(II) oxide component, leaving behind the insoluble lead(IV) oxide:\n\nWith iron oxides and with elemental iron, lead(II,IV) oxide forms insoluble iron(II) and iron(III) plumbates, which is the basis of the anticorrosive properties of lead-based paints applied to iron objects.\n\nRed lead has been used as a pigment for primer paints for iron objects. Due to its toxicity, its use is being limited. It finds limited use in some amateur pyrotechnics as a delay charge and was used in the past in the manufacture of dragon's egg pyrotechnic stars.\n\nRed lead is used as a curing agent in some polychloroprene rubber compounds. It is used in place of magnesium oxide to provide better water resistance properties.\n\nRed lead was used for engineer's scraping, before being supplanted by engineer's blue.\n\nIt is also used as an adultering agent in turmeric powder.\n\nWhen inhaled, lead(II,IV) oxide irritates lungs. In case of high dose, the victim experiences a metallic taste, chest pain, and abdominal pain. When ingested, it is dissolved in the gastric acid and absorbed, leading to lead poisoning. High concentrations can be absorbed through skin as well, and it is important to follow safety precautions when working with lead-based paint.\n\nLong-term contact with lead(II,IV) oxide may lead to accumulation of lead compounds in organisms, with development of symptoms of acute lead poisoning. Chronic poisoning displays as agitation, irritability, vision disorders, hypertension, and a grayish facial hue.\n\nLead(II,IV) oxide was shown to be carcinogenic for laboratory animals. Its carcinogenicity for humans was not proven.\nThis compound's Latin name \"minium\" originates from the Minius, a river in northwest Iberia where it was first mined.\n\nLead(II,IV) oxide was used as a red pigment in ancient Rome, where it was prepared by calcination of white lead. In the ancient and medieval periods it was used as a pigment in the production of illuminated manuscripts, and gave its name to the \"minium\" or miniature, a style of picture painted with the colour. As a finely divided powder, it was also sprinkled on dielectric surfaces to study Lichtenberg figures.\n\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, red lead is used to treat ringworms and ulcerations, though the practice is limited due to its toxicity. Also, \"azarcón\", a Mexican folk remedy for gastrointestinal disorders, contains up to 95% lead(II,IV) oxide.\n\nIt was also used before the 18th century as medicine.\n\n\n"}

On his return to court, his stepmother, the empress, attempts to seduce him. To avert danger he is bound over to a week's silence by Sindibad, leader of the Seven Wise Masters. During this time, the empress accuses him to her husband, and seeks to bring about his death by seven stories which she relates to the emperor; but her narrative is each time confuted by the Seven Wise Masters led by Sindibad. Finally the prince's lips are unsealed, the truth exposed, and the wicked empress is executed.\n\nThe frame narrative served as the flexible way to transmit tales to other listeners.\n\nThe cycle of stories, which appears in many European languages, is of Eastern origin. An analogous collection occurs in Sanskrit, attributed to the Indian philosopher Sindibad/Syntipas in the first century BC, though the Indian original is unknown. Other suggested origins are Persian (since the earliest surviving texts are in Persian) and Hebrew (a culture with similar tales, such as that of the biblical Joseph).\n\nHundreds of surviving European texts are known. These normally contain fifteen tales, one for each sage, seven from the stepmother, and one from the prince; though the framework is preserved, only four of the commonest European tales are also found in the Eastern version.\n\nTravelling from the east by way of Arabic, Persian, Syriac and Greek, the work became known as \"The Book of Sindibd\", and was translated from Greek into Latin in the 12th century by Jean de Hauteseille (Joannes de Alta Silva), a monk of the abbey of Haute-Seille near Toul, with the title of \"Dolopathos\" (ed. Hermann Österley, Strassburg, 1873). This was translated into French about 1210 by a trouvère named Herbers as \"Li romans de Dolopathos\". Another French version, \"Li Romans des sept sages\", was based on a different Latin original.\n\nThe German, English, French and Spanish chapbooks of the cycle are generally based on a Latin original differing from these. Three metrical romances probably based on the French, and dating from the 14th century, exist in English. The most important of these is \"The Sevyn Sages\" by John Rolland of Dalkeith edited for the Bannatyne Club (Edinburgh, 1837).\n\nThe collection later supplied tales that circulated in both oral and written traditions. Giovanni Boccaccio used many of them for his famous work, the \"Decameron\".\n\nThe Latin romance was frequently printed in the 15th century, and Wynkyn de Worde printed an English version about 1515. See:\n\nThe \"Seven Sages Society\", founded in 1975, maintains a perpetual scholarly bibliography, with annual updates in its on-line and printed (free of charge) Newsletter, at <http://sevensagessociety.org>.\n\nThe tale collection has been thought to contain the origins of the Aarne-Thompson-Uther tale type ATU 671, \"The Three Languages\". The story tells of a commoner boy who can understand the language of animals, which converse among themselves that the boy will lord over their mother and father in the future. His parents expell him for such affront. After a series of adventures, the boy becomes a king or pope and returns to his family's house. His parents serve him with a water and a towel and he reveals his identity.\n\nSome variants of the story inspired legends of the ascendancy of historical popes.\n\n\n"}

It lies at one of the country's border crossing points with Ethiopia; on the other side of the border is Ethiopia's corresponding border village Metemma.\n\nThe town and district form a small ethnographical island in Al Qadarif, having been founded in the 18th century by a colony of Takruri from Darfur, who, finding the spot a convenient resting-place for their fellow-pilgrims on their way to Mecca and back, obtained permission from the Emperor of Ethiopia to make a permanent settlement there. Lying on the main trade route from Sennar to Gondar (some 90 miles to the east) as well as being the center of the frontier province of Ras al-Fil, Gallabat grew into a trade center of some importance. The Scottish explorer James Bruce (who calls the town Hor-Cacamoot) spent two months in the town in 1772, disabled with dysentery which was cured only by the herbs of a local medicine-man and the attentions of his companion Yasin.\n\nOne notable ruler of Gallabat was Sheikh Miri, who has been described as \"probably the most celebrated of these border chiefs\". The Sheikh formed an alliance with the Khedive some time after Muhammad Ali of Egypt had conquered the Sennar sultanate in 1821, and proclaimed himself independent of the Ethiopian Empire. He accompanied the Turks (Egyptians) in their raid on Gondar, but escaped the ambush of \"Dejazmach\" Kinfu had sprung on the raiders. In 1838 Emperor Tewodros avenged the sack of Gondar with an attack on Gallabat; Sheikh Miri, with many of the Takruri, was killed.\n\nIn about 1870, the Egyptians garrisoned Gallabat. In 1886, the town was attacked by followers of Abdallahi ibn Muhammad (the successor of Muhammad Ahmad) and sacked. From Gallabat, a Mahdist raiding party penetrated to Gondar in Ethiopia. The Mahdists then looted Gondar. In March 1889, in revenge, an Ethiopian army under Emperor Yohannes IV attacked the Mahdists close to Gallabat in what is known as the Battle of Gallabat (or Metemma). Yohannes IV was originally successful, with the Mahdists suffering many casualties, but a shot from a lone sniper killed the Emperor late in the battle, causing his army to flee and routing the attack.\n\nIn 1899 the Mahdists were decisively defeated in the Sudan by British and Egyptian forces during the Battle of Umm Diwaykarat. After the even more decisive Battle of Omdurman, Mahdist rule in the Sudan was at an end. From 1899 to 1956, Gallabat was located in what was known as the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.\n\nIn July 1940 during the East African Campaign, Italian forces advancing from Italian East Africa forced a small British garrison commanded by Wilfred Thesiger to withdraw from Gallabat to the pass at Khor el Otrub. The Italians then occupied the town until November when the British under Brigadier Slim launched an attack to take the town back, but due to poor morale of the Essex Regiment and lack of coordination by the British bombers, failed to capture Metemma.\n\nIn 1956 the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan became the independent Republic of the Sudan.\n\nIn 1991 British television presenter Michael Palin travelled through Gallabat on his way to Gonder for the television show \"Pole to Pole\".\n\n"}

The company continues to exist only as real-estate development site, on which a new urban district will be built by the LSR Group construction company.\n\nThe factory was founded on 2 August 1916 as the Moscow Automotive Society or AMO (). The factory was completed in 1917, just before the Revolution, and was built south of Moscow near Moscow River in Tjufeleva grove. It was a modern building with the latest in American equipment and was designed to employ 6,000 workers. The plans were to produce Fiat F-15 1.5-ton trucks under license. Because of the October Revolution and the subsequent Russian Civil War it took until 1 November 1924 to produce the first vehicle which was shown at a parade in 7 November, the AMO-F15. Nevertheless the factory still managed to assemble trucks bought from Italy in 1917-1919. In April 30 1923 the factory was named after an Italian coummunist Pietro Ferrero, but in 1925 was renamed to First National Automobile Factory (Russian: 1-й Государственный автомобильный завод). 2 years later in 1927 Ivan Likhachov was appointed as a head of the factory, a person whose name the factory bears from 1956. In April 1929, it was agreed on to expand the plant to build Autocar 2.5-ton truck models.\n\nIn 1931 the factory was re-equipped and expanded with the help of the American A.J. Brandt Co., and changed its name to Automotive Factory No. 2 Zavod Imeni Stalina (ZIS or ZiS). After Nikita Khrushchev denounced the cult of personality of Joseph Stalin in 1956, the name was changed again to Zavod imeni Likhachyova, after its former director Ivan Alekseevich Likhachov.\n\nZiL lanes—road lanes dedicated to vehicles carrying top Soviet officials—were named after the car. The ZiL limousines were the official car that carried the Soviet heads of state, and many Soviet Union allied leaders, to summits or in parades. The limousines were flown to international summits as for example in 1990 to Washington DC for President Mikhail Gorbachev's official state visit.\n\nZil has a history of exporting trucks to Cuba, a trade resumed in the early 21st century. The ZiL factory is portrayed in a 2014 documentary, \"The Last Limousine\".\n\nAfter the final ZIL limousine was built in 2012, the Moscow factory administration stopped truck production and the company was declared bankrupt in 2013. ZiL still exists as a legal entity, but produces no vehicles. In 2014 it was announced that the factory site will be turned into a residential development. Most factory buildings were dismantled in 2015.\n\nThe factory's equipment and other automotive assets were auctioned off to a new company, \"MSTs6 AMO ZIL\". It employs 47 staff, mostly former ZiL workers. The company took part in the Moscow International Automobile Salon 2016.\n\n\n\n"}

Originally a military alliance, it evolved to a federation with the issuing of a constitution with effect from 1 July 1867. In the course of the war, Prussian troops had occupied the Free City of Frankfurt and the King of Prussia (later to become Emperor of Germany) had purchased the remnants of the Thurn-und-Taxis Post organisation. According to article 48, the federal area of the Northern German states, \"de facto\" an enlarged Prussia, came under the united postal authority, led by director Heinrich von Stephan.\n\nWith the German unification upon the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, the Deutsche Reichspost was established as a state monopoly and became the official national postal authority of the German Empire including the annexed province of Alsace-Lorraine. Its official name was \"Kaiserliche Post und Telegraphenverwaltung\". The Southern German federated states of Baden (until 1872), Württemberg (until 1902) and Bavaria initially maintained separate state post authorities, that nevertheless were integrated into the nationwide administration. On 1 January 1876 a \"Reichspostamt\" under Postmaster General von Stephan was split-off from Bismarck's Reich Chancellery as a government agency in its own right. In the First World War, a \"Reichsabgabe\" tax was levied on the postal traffic from 1 August 1916 in order to finance the war expenses.\n\nWith the establishment of the Weimar Republic upon the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the former \"Reichspostamt\" in Berlin became the \"Reichspostministerium\". After the hyperinflation period, the \"Deutsche Reichspost\" (DRP) agency was again spun off in 1924 and operated as a state-owned enterprise. On 2 June 1932 Paul Freiherr von Eltz-Rübenach was appointed Reichspost Minister by Chancellor Franz von Papen and he maintained his office upon the \"Machtergreifung\" of the Nazi Party in 1933, \"assisted\" by Nazi state secretary Wilhelm Ohnesorge. The postal area was significantly enlarged with the incorporation of the Saar territory in 1935, the Austrian \"Anschluss\" in 1938, and the annexation of the \"Sudetenland\" according to the Munich Agreement. It was during this time that the Reichspost installed the first public videophone.\n\nIn the Second World War the \"Reichspost\" authority spread out to the Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany, such as the \"Reichsgau Wartheland\", the \"Reichsgau Danzig-Westpreußen\", and the Polish General Government. In 1941 postal codes were introduced. The \"Feldpost\" military mail organisation of the Wehrmacht not only served Army, \"Luftwaffe\" and \"Kriegsmarine\" service members, but also \"SS-Verfügungstruppen\", \"Waffen-SS\" and \"Reichsarbeitsdienst\" members in the field, becoming the general postal authority of the occupied territories. Deliveries were more and more affected by the advance of Allied troops from January 1945 on. The Reichspost finally ceased to function with the German Instrument of Surrender on May 8. The last \"Reichspostminister\" Julius Dorpmüller, a member of the Flensburg Government, was arrested two weeks later, and governmental authority was officially taken over by the Allied Control Council with the Berlin Declaration of June 5.\n\nThe Reichspost was initially replaced by Allied-controlled postal authorities that provided mail services in the occupation zones. From 1947 a united agency served the British-American Bizone area. With the emergence of two German states, the \"Deutsche Bundespost\" (German federal post office) was established in West Germany, and the \"Deutsche Post\" in East Germany. In addition, there was a separate \"Deutsche Bundespost Berlin\" for West Berlin, as well as the \"Saar\" postal authority (1947–1956).\n\nAfter the reunification of Germany in 1990, the state-owned \"Bundespost\" continued to function as the sole provider of postal services until 1995, when the postal, telecommunications, and banking divisions were spun off as separate entities. The \"Deutsche Bundespost\" eventually became Deutsche Post AG, a share holding company, later reintegrating the Postbank, and Deutsche Telekom.\n\n\n"}

He was born at Rome and died at Florence.\n\nHe studied at the University of Rome La Sapienza, took his degree in 1855 in natural science and mathematics, and entered his uncle's pharmacy as an assistant. His scanty leisure was, however, given to study. He learned Greek by himself, and gained facility in the modern language by conversing with the Greek students at the university. In spite of all disadvantages, he not only mastered the language, but became one of the chief classical scholars of Italy.\n\nIn 1857 he published, in the \"Rheinisches Museum\", a translation of some recently discovered fragments of Hypereides, with a dissertation on that orator. This was followed by a notice of the annalist Granius Licinianus, and one on the oration of Hypereides on the Lamian War. In 1859 he was appointed professor of Greek at Pisa on the recommendation of the duke of Sermoneta. A few years later he was called to a similar post at Florence, remaining emeritus professor at Pisa also. He subsequently took up his residence in Rome as lecturer on Greek antiquities and greatly interested himself in the Roman Forum excavations. He was a member of the governing bodies of the academies of Milan, Venice, Naples and Turin. He was appointed senator in 1891.\n\nIn Pisa, in 1863, he met Leone Raffalovich, a businessman from Odessa. After a short engagement, he married Leone's daughter Elena on 13 August, and in 1865 their daughter Laura was born. Their different natures meant that the couple drifted apart, and in 1872 Elena left the family to settle in Venice. Laura married Luigi Adriano Milani, and Domenico Comparetti, wishing that their last name should be was transmitted to her daughter's male descendants, got the royal concession to the addition of his name to those of the Milani grandchildren. His great-grandson was Don Lorenzo Milani.\n\nThe list of Comparetti's writings is long and varied. Of his works in classical literature, the best known are an edition of the \"Euxenippus\" of Hypereides, and monographs on Pindar and Sappho. He also edited the great inscription which contains a collection of the municipal laws of Gortyn in Crete, discovered on the site of the ancient city.\n\nIn the \"Kalewala and the Traditional Poetry of the Finns\" (English translation by I. M. Anderton, 1898) he discusses the national epic of Finland and its heroic songs, with a view to solving the problem whether an epic could be composed by the interweaving of such national songs. He comes to a negative conclusion, and applies this reasoning to the Homeric problem. He treats this question again in a treatise on the so-called Peisistratean edition of Homer (\"La Commissione omerica di Pisistrato\", 1881).\n\nHis \"Researches concerning the Book of Sindibad\" were translated in the \"Proceedings of the Folk-Lore Society\". His \"Vergil in the Middle Ages\" (translated into English by E. F. M. Benecke, 1895) traces the strange vicissitudes by which the great Augustan poet became successively grammatical fetich, Christian prophet and wizard. Together with Alessandro d'Ancona, Comparetti edited a collection of Italian national songs and stories (9 vols, Turin, 1870–1891), many of which had been collected and written down by himself for the first time.\n"}

Burkina's contribution to African cinema started with the establishment of the film festival FESPACO (Festival Panafricain du Cinéma et de la Télévision de Ouagadougou), which was launched as a film week in 1969 and gained government support and permanent structures in 1972. It is the largest film exhibition venue in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than half a million attendees, and takes place in odd numbered years in March. Burkina is also one of the countries producing the most feature films in Africa. Many of the nation's filmmakers are known internationally and have won international prizes. For many years the headquarters of the Federation of Panafrican Filmmakers (FEPACI) was in Ouagadougou, rescued in 1983 from a period of moribund inactivity by the enthusiastic support and funding of President Thomas Sankara In 2006 the Secretariat of FEPACI moved to South Africa but the headquarters of the organization is still in Ouagaoudougou. Between 1977 and 1987 Burkina Faso housed a regional film school, Institut d'Education Cinématographique de Ouagadougou (INAFEC), which was instigated by FEPACI and funded in part by UNESCO. But eighty percent of its funding came from the government of Burkina Faso; no other African country participated in its funding and few sent students.\n\nIn the late 1990s, local private production companies began to proliferate and digital production became increasingly prevalent. By 2002 over twenty-five small production companies existed in the country, many pooling their resources and expertise in order to produce. The best known directors from Burkina Faso are: Mamadou Djim Kola, Gaston Kaboré, Kollo Daniel Sanou, Paul Zoumbara, Emmanuel Kalifa Sanon, Pierre S. Yameogo, Idrissa Ouedraogo, Drissa Toure, Dani Kouyaté, and Régina Fanta Nacro. Burkina also produces popular television series such as Bobodjiouf. The internationally known filmmakers such as Ouedraogo, Kabore, Yameogo, and Kouyate make also popular television series.\n\nMany films shot in Burkina Faso by local directors have found distribution in Francophone Europe and several have received assistance from the French Ministry of Co-operation. However, while these films have won awards in Europe and are regularly featured in African Studies courses, in Africa itself they are little known outside of academic circles.\n\nBurkina Faso hosts the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO) every two years in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital.\n\nIn 2005, director Gaston Kaboré, who won the top prize at FESPACO in 1997 for his film \"Buud Yam\", opened a training school for new filmmakers in Ouagadougou. The school, named Imagine, was built with millions of CFA of Kaboré's own money and opened its doors for the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou 2005.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its home is the reconstructed Court Tennis Building at the Newport Casino. The National Tennis Club hosted the Real Tennis World Championship match in 2004, when Robert Fahey successfully defended his title against Tim Chisholm. The Court Tennis Building was constructed as part of the original Casino complex in 1880 and in 1980 the National Tennis Court was rededicated, largely through the efforts of Clarence \"Clarry\" Pell, as the symbolic home of the sport in the United States.\n\nCourt tennis, also known as \"real tennis,\" is the original indoor racquet sport from which the modern game of lawn tennis (usually simply called tennis) is descended. It is known as court tennis in the United States, royal tennis in Australia and courte-paume in France. The expression \"real\" was primarily used by journalists in the mid-20th century to distinguish the ancient game from modern \"lawn\" tennis (even though the sport is rarely played on lawns outside the few social-club managed estates such as Wimbledon).\n\nReal tennis is played today on 47 existing courts in the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States, and France. Despite a documented history of courts existing in the German states during the 17th century, real tennis eventually died out there during or after the World War II reconstruction.\n\nThe rules and scoring are similar to those of lawn tennis. In both sports game scoring is by fifteens (with the exception of 40, which is shortened from 45), however in real tennis the player with six games wins a set even if the opponent has five games. A match is typically best of three sets, except for the major open tournaments in which the matches are best of five sets. Another difference is that unlike the latex-based technology underlying the modern lawn-tennis ball, real tennis still utilizes a cork-based ball very close in design to the original ball used in the game, which are much less bouncy than lawn tennis balls and weigh about 2 ounces (compared to the lawn tennis ball weighing at 2 ounces). Real tennis also uses long racquets (27 inches) made of wood and use very tight strings to cope with the heavier balls.\n\nA real tennis court is enclosed by walls on all four sides, three of which have sloping roofs, known as \"penthouses.\" A game of real tennis has characteristic features such as the various window-like openings below the penthouse roofs that offer players a chance to win the point instantly by hitting the ball into the opening.\n\nThe National Tennis Club (NTC) was formed in 1980 when the original court tennis court, destroyed by a series of arsenic fires in 1945 and 1946, was completely rebuilt. The only thing that remains original is the floor and some of the lower walls, dating back to 1880.\n\nA group of devoted players and enthusiasts, the National Court patrons, including the former President, Clarence C. Pell, provided funding for the restoration through the United States Court Tennis Association (USCTA). The informal reopening of the court, known as the National Tennis Court, occurred on September 29, 1979. The official dedication was observed in August, 1980, following ceremonies at the conclusion of the first world doubles tournament for the Tiffany Cup.\n\nThe National Tennis Court has been considered to be the official court of the USCTA since its restoration in 1980. As the game has grown, new institutions have been formed, such as the U.S. Court Tennis Preservation Foundation (USCTPF) to provide complementary leadership and funding for this amateur game.\n\nThe Club originally was only opened for play in summer months, but the court is now in use year round. The club has an active membership of approximately 100 players. It is also one of the busiest court tennis courts in the United States and has a program for all levels, including club handicaps, inter-city play, night leagues, and national and international tournaments. Club members compete worldwide.\n\nThe Club has been led by its governors, Jonathan Isham, Barclay Douglas, Sr., Clarry Pell, Jim Wharton, Jonathon Pardee and Jane Lippincott.\n\nResident Active Membership\n\nThese members may use the court for singles and doubles matches throughout the year and are eligible to enter all club events and tournaments and championships for which they qualify by handicap.\n\nNon-Resident Membership\n\nThis category is available to individuals and families who reside further than 40 miles from the court and are limited to 50 hours of court time annually. Some members who qualify for non-resident membership will choose the Active category so that they are not limited on court hours. They are eligible to enter all club events and tournaments and championships for which they qualify by handicap.\n\nSocial Membership\n\nSocial members receive all club mailings and invitations to social events.\n\nInternational Membership\n\nFor individuals who live overseas but who wish to support the National Tennis Club there is the International category. They are limited to 5 hours of court time annually without charge.\n\nJunior Membership\n\nFor individuals who are 25 years or younger, the junior membership is available.

{"id": "1830606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830606", "title": "Utila", "text": "Utila\n\nUtila \"(Isla de Utila)\" is the smallest of the Honduras' major Bay Islands, after Roatán and Guanaja, in a region that marks the south end of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, the second-largest in the world.\n\nThe eastern end of the island is capped by a thin veneer of basaltic volcanic rocks, erupted from several pyroclastic cones including Pumpkin Hill which forms the highest point on the island. It has been documented in history since Columbus' fourth voyage, and currently enjoys growing tourism with emphasis on recreational diving and is known as one of the world's best dive locations. The people of Utila are of African (Garifuna), English and Dutch descent.\n\nArcheological, historical and ethnographic evidence of the Bay Islands indicates that they were inhabited well before the Europeans arrived, as long ago as 600AD by a pre-Columbian culture known as the Paya and now known as Pech. The Paya people may have entered Central America in the great North to South America migration in 5,000 BC, although to the contrary, linguistic studies indicate that the Paya may have been descendants of South American tribes. Christopher Columbus, on his fourth voyage to the new world, landed on the island of Guanaja on 30 July 1502, after encountering a small fleet of dugout canoes destined from the mainland to the Bay Islands. These vessels were filled with cotton cloth, maize, cacao, beans, copper goods and wooden swords with sharp flint edges, and on this meeting one dugout canoe carrying 25 men, women and children was captured. On land, Columbus encountered a fairly large population of Paya whom he believed to be cannibals. In 1516, licensed slavers were sent to the Islands under the authority of Diego Velasquez and captured 300, killing others who put up resistance. The slaving vessel returned to Havana harbour, Santiago de Cuba, where it was taken over by the Paya who demanded repatriation. On hearing that the Paya had been repatriated, Velasquez commissioned two ships back which then captured 400 Paya on Utila and on one of the other islands, and during this raid 100 Paya were reported to have been killed. After their capture, this and future shipments of Paya slaves were forced to work in mines, farm sugar cane plantations and tend livestock on Santiago de Cuba, and were also sent to work in the gold and silver mines of Mexico.\n\nLater on, English, French, and Dutch pirates established settlements on the islands and raided the Spanish cargo vessels laden with gold and other treasures from the New World. The Welsh buccaneer Henry Morgan established his base at Port Royal on Roatán, about 30 kilometers from Utila, in the mid-17th century; at that time as many as 5,000 pirates were living on that island.\n\nColonization by the Spanish began in the early 16th century. Over the next century, the Spanish plundered the island for its slave trade and eliminated the island of its natives by the early 17th century. Britain, in its aggressive attempt to out-colonize the Spanish in the Caribbean, occupied the Bay Islands on and off between 1550 and 1700. During this time, the buccaneers found the vacated, mostly unprotected islands a haven for safe harbour and transport. Utila is rich in pirate lore, and even presently, scuba divers look for sunken treasure from Captain Morgan's lost booty from his raid on Panama in 1671.\n\nThe British were forced to give the Bay Islands to the Honduran government in the mid 19th century. It was at this time that the nearly uninhabited islands were being populated by its now Caymanian roots. They remain rich in Caymanian culture and dialect.\n\nUtila has been a part of Honduras for approximately 150 years. For nearly 200 years Spanish \"conquistadores\" and British pirates battled for control of these islands, ignoring the native people for the most part. During this period, the Islands were used for food and wood supplies, safe harbour, and slave trading. Remains of British forts and towns named after famous pirates remain as their legacy.\n\nMaking a significant impact on Utila's cultural base were the Black Caribs, who originated as the Callinagu in the Orinoco Delta in Brazil. Migrating north to the Lower Antilles the Callinagu subsequently exterminated the Arahuaco men, but kept and bred with their women creating a new ethic subgroup that became known as the Caliponan, or Yellow Caribs. In 1635 African slaves who had been shipwrecked by their own devices began to marry the Caliponan women, adopting their language and culture so as to assimilate locally and thwart their owners attempts to retrieve them. Thus the Garifuna society was born. On 12 April 1797, a total of 2,248 Garifunas were sent to Honduras and the Bay Islands in an attempt by the English to restrain the Garifuna from assisting the French in the English/French dispute over the islands of Martinica, and Santa Lucia. Scattered on the north coast of Honduras and in the Bay Islands, the Garifuna still populate much of the Bay Islands, maintaining their own cultural identity and language. On Roatan the Garifuna maintain a strong presence in the Sandy Bay community, on the western most side of East Harbor, a number of them having made the journey to Utila from Cayo Chachahuate, a small nearby island that is a bastion of the Bay Island's Garifuna.\n\nWith favourable diving conditions, the island increasingly attracts general tourists, along with more traditional international backpacker visitors.

It was once a modest fishing station, with all or part of the fishing station being known as Beck Hythe. In the latter part of the 19th century it was catapulted into prominence, and became known as “the village of millionaires”.\n\nThe London journalist and travel writer Clement Scott came to Overstrand in 1883, christened the area ‘’Poppyland’’, and wrote about the church tower on the cliff edge and its “Garden of Sleep”. While in Overstrand he stayed at the Mill House with miller Alfred Jermy and his daughter Louie, who became “the Maid of the Mill” in his articles about ‘’Poppyland’’.\n\nScott had many London contacts in the theatrical world, and his writings led a number of them and others from London society to come to Overstrand. Some bought land in the village and had houses built there, and for a while the village was the place to visit. A large hotel was built on the cliff edge, though this slid into the sea in the 1950s.\n\nThe Edwardian architect Sir Edwin Lutyens worked at Overstrand, designing Overstrand Hall for Charles William Mills, 2nd Baron Hillingdon, The Pleasaunce for Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea and the Methodist Church. The large houses of the gentry have largely passed from private ownership to other uses.\n\nOverstrand railway station was on the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway between Cromer and North Walsham. It is now closed.\n\nThe Overstrand biplane bomber was named after the village, having been made at the Boulton & Paul aircraft factory in Norwich in the early 1930s.\n\nSeason 1, episode 2 of the BBC TV series \"Screen Two\" was called \"Poppyland\" (1985). Directed by John Madden, it took place in Overstrand and tells the story of Clement Scott in his travels there.\n\nAs with much of the Norfolk coast, erosion was and continues to be a major problem. Clifton Way is an experimental site; its sea defences include riprap (at £1,300 a boulder, predominantly shipped from Norway), wooden groynes, revetments, gabions and Offshore Reefs. The cliffs of soft boulder clay slump because of the water running through the clay, and the resulting material on the beach is removed by the succeeding high tides. In the neighbouring village of Sidestrand, the church was moved back from the cliff edge in the 19th century, though the tower of the church was left standing on the cliff top.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1830609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830609", "title": "Political ideas in science fiction", "text": "Political ideas in science fiction\n\nThe exploration of politics in science fiction is arguably older than the identification of the genre. One of the earliest works of modern science fiction, H. G. Wells’ \"The Time Machine\", is an extrapolation of the class structure of the United Kingdom of his time, an extreme form of Social Darwinism; during tens of thousands of years, human beings have evolved into two different species based on their social class.\n\nMost story and novel-length works of science fiction include speculation (directly or indirectly) on modes of life and behaviour. They are sometimes allegorical and often serious attempts to model possible future societies, political institutions and systems. Examples include Harry Harrison's novel \"Make Room! Make Room!\", \"The Dispossessed\" by Ursula K. Le Guin; and the \"Hostile Takeover\" Trilogy by S. Andrew Swann. \nImagined societies may be based on very different assumptions. Often the future is modeled on historic forms - feudalism, or in the case of The Foundation series, the Roman Empire. A common theme is the integration of humanity into some greater interstellar society. A popular modern example is the \"Uplift\" series by David Brin where a species' status is defined based on the concept of biologically uplifting other species.\n\nThe term Utopia was invented by Thomas More as the title of his Latin book \"De Optimo Reipublicae Statu deque Nova Insula Utopia\" (circa 1516), known more commonly as Utopia. He created the word \"utopia\" to suggest two Greek neologisms simultaneously: outopia (no place) and eutopia (good place). More depicts a rationally organised society, through the narration of an explorer who discovers it—Raphael Hythlodaeus. Utopia is a republic where all property is held in common. In addition, it has few laws, no lawyers and rarely sends its citizens to war, but hires mercenaries from among its war-prone neighbours.\n\nGenerally speaking, utopias are generally societies whose author believes either perfect, or as perfect as can be attainable. Ernest Callenbach's \"Ecotopia\" is a contemporary example. This can cause some confusion, in that some works generally recognized as “utopian”, such as Plato’s \"Republic\", can come across as much less than ideal to a modern reader. They are one of the smaller subsets of political science fiction, possibly because it is difficult to create dramatic tension in a world the author believes is perfect. Various authors get around this problem by postulating problems in the utopian society, such L. Neil Smith does. Other ways of presenting a utopian society in science fiction, is to send characters outside it to explore beyond its confines (ala \"Star Trek\"), or focus on an outsider character entering the society, as in Aldous Huxley’s \"Brave New World\". This last method is often used to show that the utopian society shown is actually a dystopia. Kim Stanley Robinson's approach in \"The Mars Trilogy\" involved exploring the creation of utopian and ecotopian societies on Mars.\n\nAnother option for a Utopian society can be found in robotocracy, or the rule of Robots or Computers, with the theory that a programmed machine can dispassionately provide for the welfare of all. Examples of this include various works of Isaac Asimov and the planet of Sigma Draconis VI in the Star Trek episode \"Spock's Brain\". If the machine rule becomes harsh or oppressive, it may become a dystopia instead.\n\nDystopias are societies where the author illustrates the worst that can happen. Usually this encompasses extrapolating trends the author sees as dangerous. During the 20th century many examples were written in reaction to the rise of Nazism, Communism and Religious Fundamentalism:\n\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that scenarios which some would describe as dystopic, others would describe as utopian. Norman Spinrad's novel\" The Iron Dream\" was generally recognised to be a dystopic novel, but lauded by neo-Nazis as a utopia.\n\nOften the political focus of a science fiction novel is less on the social order, but how people maneuver and achieve their agendas within a given system. Many space operas rely on vast interstellar bureaucracies to drive their plots \"(see: Galactic empire)\". George Lucas's famous \"Star Wars\" saga features political science modeled after historic events. The Retief stories by Keith Laumer and the Chanur books by C. J. Cherryh have politics and political maneuverings as some of the main themes, and Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" books offer advanced explorations of human politics, including the dovetailing economics. Often this focus can descend into conspiracy and paranoia where the premise is that there are secret forces out to get the protagonists, the seminal example of which is the \"Illuminatus! Trilogy\". Most commonly, science fiction deals with the political fallout of its own premises. A story will posit some new event or technology and explore its political dimensions; this includes most techno-thrillers but also encompasses a large body of traditional science fiction. An example is the Philip K. Dick story \"The Minority Report\" (upon which the film starring Tom Cruise is based), which introduces the idea of perfectly predicting a crime of violence so the perpetrator can be arrested before the crime is committed, and the political and legal ramifications of actually using such a system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The former, which was printed by John Ros in 1575, may have been written before 1560. The latter was translated from a Scots prose version at the suggestion of an aunt (\"ane proper wenche\"), who had found his treatment of the courtly allegory involved and uninteresting.\n\nThe \"Court of Venus\" was edited by Walter Gregor for the S.T.S. in 1884. See W. A. Craigie's long list of corrections of that edition in the \"Modern Language Quarterly\" (March 1898). \n\nIn \"The Allegory of Love\" (1936), C. S.

He played the whole of his Football League career at Blackpool, usually at right back. Between 1954 and 1971 he played 627 games in all competitions, scored six goals, and spent a decade as the club's captain. He also represented the England national team 43 times between 1959 and 1966, and captained them in 15 games. He was a member of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad. After retiring from playing, Armfield managed Bolton Wanderers and Leeds United.\n\nArmfield was born to Christopher and Doris Armfield. After Armfield's family moved to Blackpool from Denton during the Second World War, he was spotted in a practice match at Bloomfield Road by manager Joe Smith. Armfield, who played on the left wing for that game, scored all of Blackpool's goals in a 4–1 victory. Impressed, Smith offered him a trial. After finishing his studies at Arnold School in Blackpool and obtained his higher school certificate, he joined Blackpool at the age of 17. On 27 December 1954, Armfield made his Blackpool debut at Portsmouth. Armfield recalled of the game: \"That League debut at Fratton Park was not, I fear, a very conspicuous one for me. I found myself up against Gordon Dale, a very clever and strong winger with plenty of experience. He was far too good and we lost 3–0. Gordon really gave me the run-around, and I realised just how much I had to learn. They were a very good team in those days, and they scored a goal in about the first two minutes — and I hadn't touched the ball. We were three down after fifteen minutes.\"\n\nHe was part of the Blackpool side that finished in what is to date still the club's highest-ever League position when they finished as First Division (then the top flight in England) runners-up in the 1955–56 season.\n\nArmfield was voted Young Player of the Year in 1959. In 1966, he narrowly lost out to Bobby Charlton for the Footballer of the Year award and had to content himself with being Blackpool's Player of the Year. Blackpool achieved little success in his seventeen years with them, the club having won the FA Cup the year before his arrival. The exception was promotion to the First Division in 1969–70.\n\nArmfield was awarded a testimonial match, played on 2 September 1970, his 35th birthday, and thousands turned out to pay tribute to him. He played his final game for Blackpool on 1 May 1971, in front of a crowd of over 30,000 against Manchester United at Bloomfield Road, in what would be the last game played by Blackpool in the top flight of English football for almost 40 years. He came back from a ten-game injury lay-off to make his swan song appearance.\n\nArmfield won 43 caps for England between 1959 and 1966, and captained his country on fifteen occasions. He made his international debut on 13 May 1959, against Brazil in front of over 120,000 fans at the Maracanã Stadium. He played in the 1962 World Cup in Chile, where he was acclaimed as \"the best right-back in the world\". He was also voted \"best right-back in Europe\" between 1962 and 1964. However, a groin injury suffered in Blackpool's last match of the 1963–64 season, against Ipswich Town ruled him out of the side for England's busy summer programme. Fulham's George Cohen took the opportunity to establish himself as England's first choice right-back with a series of strong performances, and Armfield was unable to force his way back into the team. He played two further matches in the warm-up to the 1966 World Cup and was included in the winning squad but a toe injury sustained in the pre-tournament appearance against Finland and Cohen's incumbency ensured he played no part in the tournament. His appearance against Finland was his last for his country.\n\nIn the 1966 World Cup final only the 11 players on the pitch at the end of the 4–2 win over West Germany received medals. Following a Football Association-led campaign to persuade FIFA to award medals to all the winners' squad members, Armfield was presented with his medal by Gordon Brown at a ceremony at 10 Downing Street on 10 June 2009.\n\nNot long after the end of his playing career, Armfield became manager of Bolton Wanderers in 1971, leading them to promotion to the Second Division in the 1972–73 season as Third Division champions.\n\nOn 4 October 1974, Armfield took the helm at Leeds United, replacing Brian Clough as manager, leading them to the European Cup Final in the 1974–75 season in which they lost 2–0 to Bayern Munich under controversial circumstances. Assisted by Don Howe, Armfield was responsible for rebuilding Don Revie's aging but still formidable side, a task which he achieved with some success. Armfield bought in players such as Tony Currie and Brian Flynn, and under his stewardship Leeds never finished outside of the top ten, qualified for the UEFA Cup, and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1976–77 and the League Cup in 1977–78. He was dismissed as manager in July 1978, being replaced by Celtic manager Jock Stein.\n\nLeeds was Armfield's final managerial role, and he decided to work in the media. He worked as a journalist with the \"Daily Express\" from 1979 to 1991. Later he was known as a match summariser for BBC Radio Five Live. 2009 marked his 30th year on the BBC. To mark the occasion, Armfield picked his personal Top 5 Players from each decade he had been summarising and these were broadcast as part of 5 Live's 2009 FA Cup Final pre-game programme.\n\nHe also worked as a consultant with the Football Association and in this role was responsible for the appointment of Terry Venables as England coach in 1994 and was also a key figure in Glenn Hoddle's appointment two years later. In 2000, he was awarded an OBE for services to football and in 2004 he was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of his home county of Lancashire. In 2005–2006 he served as High Sheriff of Lancashire.\n\nAlthough born in Denton, Armfield lived mainly in Blackpool, moving there in a Second World War evacuation, and in 2003 he was awarded the freedom of the resort.\nIn 2004, he released his autobiography, \"Right Back to the Beginning: The Autobiography\", which a book review in \"The Times\" described as \"Authoritative and engaging, but at the same time warm-hearted and kind, there is not a harsh word, and hardly a critical one, in it\".\n\nOn 23 September 2005 he received a civic reception in Blackpool just after his 70th birthday on 21 September when a tangerine flag was flown from the town hall for the day in his honour.\n\nIn July 2007, Armfield was awarded with an Honorary Fellowship from nearby Myerscough College, recognising his pioneering contribution to developing the attacking full-back role.\n\nOn 22 September 2007, Armfield was the half-time guest at Blackpool's Championship home match against Colchester United. He received a standing ovation, and he thanked the Blackpool fans for their support, which, he said, helped him get through the recent dark days.\n\nOn 2 March 2008, Armfield was awarded the Outstanding Contribution honour at the Football League Awards ceremony in London. On 18 September 2008 Armfield was awarded a place in the football Hall of Fame at the National Football Museum in Preston, joining fellow former \"Seasiders\" Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen in the list of Blackpool players selected. The panel which consisted of Bobby Charlton, Tom Finney and Mark Lawrenson opted to induct Armfield. He was presented with the honour by former England teammate, Jimmy Greaves at the National Football Museum Hall of Fame Night, held in London.\n\nOn 27 April 2008, Armfield was awarded the PFA Merit Award at the 35th Annual Awards Dinner at London's Grosvenor Hotel. He received three standing ovations when he got up to accept the award.\n\nIn July 2009 he was honoured by Tameside Council in Denton, where he was born, and the Denton and Audenshaw District Assembly presented him with a lifetime-achievement award.\n\nArmfield was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2010 New Year's Honours list for services to the community in Lancashire.\n\nArmfield's son, John, also played football, albeit to a less successful level and became a teacher in Lancashire. In October 1980, he signed associated schoolboy forms with Manchester United, but never made a professional appearance before going on to play non-league football for Runcorn, Barrow and Workington.\n\nIn May 2010, after Blackpool won promotion to the Premier League for the first time, Armfield—who attended the Championship play-off Final at Wembley—wrote a column for the \"Daily Mail\".\n\nOn 5 May 2012 Armfield presented the trophy to the winning captain. at the FA Cup Final between Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nJimmy Armfield was awarded Global Football Ambassador at the Football Business Awards 2016.\n\nOn 11 May 2007, he announced on BBC Radio Lancashire that he had been undergoing chemotherapy treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in his throat, and was being advised to rest by his doctors, but he remained positive about his future. The cancer was successfully treated, but returned in November 2016.\n\nArmfield died of the disease on 22 January 2018 in Blackpool, at the age of 82.\n\nArmfield was inducted into Blackpool's Hall of Fame at Bloomfield Road, when it was officially opened by him in April 2006. Organised by the Blackpool Supporters Association, Blackpool fans around the world voted on their all-time heroes. Five players from each decade are inducted; Armfield is in the 1960s.\nThe South Stand at Bloomfield Road, which was opened on 20 March 2010, is named the \"Jimmy Armfield South Stand\" with ARMFIELD spelled out in white seats amongst the tangerine majority. A statue of Armfield was commissioned by the Blackpool Supporters' Association in 2009. The nine foot high statue, costing £100,000, is located outside the main entrance, behind the West Stand facing Seasiders Way, and was unveiled by Sir Trevor Brooking on 1 May 2011.\n\nOn 2 September 2019, The FA unveiled the Jimmy Armfield Lecture Theatre at St. George's Park in his honour.\n\nSource:\n\nAs a player:\n\nAs a manager:\n\nBolton Wanderers\n\nLeeds United\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of the most common species of land snail in Europe, and has been introduced to North America.\n\n\"Cepaea nemoralis\" is the type species of the genus \"Cepaea\". It is used as a model organism in citizen science projects.\n\n\"Cepaea nemoralis\" is among the largest and, because of its polymorphism and bright colours, one of the best-known snails in Western Europe. The colour of the shell of \"Cepaea nemoralis\" is very variable; it can be reddish, brownish, yellow or whitish, with or without one or more dark-brown colour bands. Names for every colour variant were established in the 1800s; but this system was later abandoned.\n\nThe thickened and slightly out-turned apertural lip usually dark brown, rarely white. The umbilicus is narrow but open in juveniles, and closed in adults. The surface of the shell is semi-glossy, and it has from 4½ to 5½ whorls. The width of the shell is 18–25 mm. The height of the shell is 12–22 mm.\n\nThe similar species \"Caucasotachea vindobonensis\" is less intensely coloured. The grove snail is closely related to the white-lipped snail, \"C. hortensis\", shares much the same habitat, and has similar shell colour and pattern. The grove snail is usually the larger of the two species when mature, but the principal difference is that the adult grove snail almost always has a dark brown lip to its shell, whilst adults of \"Cepaea hortensis\" almost always have a white lip. However, a morph of the grove snail also has a white lip. In areas where lip colour is variable, dissection is necessary: the structure of the love dart is quite different in the two species, as are the vaginal mucus glands. A cross-section of the love dart shows a cross with simple blades, whereas that of \"C. hortensis\" has bifurcated blades. \"C. hortensis\" has 4 or more branches of body light with reddish or brownish hue, upper side often slightly darker, tentacles darker and 15 mm long.\n\nApart from the band at the lip of the shell, grove snails are highly polymorphic in their shell colour and banding. The background colour of the shell can sometimes be so pale as to be almost white; it can also be yellow, pink, chestnut through to dark brown, and the shells can be with or without dark bandings. The bands vary in intensity of colour, in width and in total number, from zero up to a total of six.\n\nThe polymorphism has been intensely studied from 1940 onwards for its heredity, evolution and ecology. Researchers have variously asserted that the cause is random genetic drift, different natural selection pressures in different areas (the snail often has darker camouflage in woodland, lighter in rough grassland) with mixing by migration, and balanced polymorphism. Balanced polymorphism could arise when a predator like the song thrush has a given 'search image', so it tends to see and kill snails of a particular colour and pattern. Natural selection would then favour a diversity of colours and patterns as an antipredator adaptation. However it appears that no one explanation is the whole answer: most probably, the polymorphism has several causes, including selection of paler, more reflective colours in hot environments to reduce water loss.\n\nDifferent coloration and banding of the shells of \"Cepaea nemoralis\":\n\nThe native distribution of this species is from northern and western Europe to central Europe, including Ireland and Great Britain. The species is rare and scattered in northern Scotland, where it has been introduced. It is not found in the Hebrides, Orkney or Shetland. It seems to have been affected by air pollution and soil acidification in some parts of England.\n\nThe species is found in France, Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, eastwards to northwestern Poland, Czech Republic, SW Hungary, southern Portugal, central Spain, Bosnia, in Italy to Lucania, and as far north as southern Sweden. In Eastern Europe it is found in Latvia, Kaliningrad, Estonia (Hiiumaa island), and Ukraine. This species has been reported in British Columbia, Canada and Northern Ontario, and western Washington State.\n\nNo doubt aided by human transport, this species is a good colonizer, and is often found in gardens, parks and abandoned land in cities. In Eastern Europe it occurs in urban areas. More recently, the grove snail has been introduced to North America, and Venezuela.\n\nThe white-lipped snail has a similar range, but that species extends further north, to border the Arctic.\n\nThis is a very common and widespread species in Western Europe, occupying a very wide range of habitats from dunes along the coastline, to woodlands with full canopy cover. It lives in shrubs and open woods, in plains and highlands, dunes, cultivated habitats, gardens and roadsides. It can be found up to an altitude of 1200 m in the Alps, 1800 m in the Pyrenees, 900 m in Wales, 600 m in Scotland.\n\nThis species feeds mainly on dead or senescent plants. It is not noxious to crops.\n\nLike most pulmonate land snails, it is hermaphrodite and must mate to produce fertile eggs. Mating tends to be concentrated in late spring and early summer, though it can continue through the autumn. The snails often store the sperm they receive from their partner for some time, and individual broods can have mixed paternity. In Britain it lays clutches of 30–50 (in France 40–80) oval eggs between June and August (in France May–October, in W France until November).

They are \"Cilappatikāram\", \"Manimekalai\", \"Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi\", \"Valayapathi\" and \"Kuṇṭalakēci\". The first mention of the \"Aimperumkappiyam\" (lit. Five large epics) occurs in Mayilainathar's commentary of \"Nannūl\". However, Mayilainathar does not mention their titles. The titles are first mentioned in the late-18th– to early-19th-century work \"Thiruthanikaiula\". Earlier works like the 17th-century poem \"Tamil vidu thoothu\" mention the great epics as \"Panchkavyams\". Among these, the last two, \"Valayapathi\" and \"Kuṇṭalakēci\" are not extant.\n\nThese five epics were written over a period of 5th to 10th century CE and act and provide historical information about the society, religions, culture and academic life of Tamil people over that period. \"Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi\" introduced long verses called \"virutha pa\" in Tamil literature, while \"Cilappatikāram\" used \"akaval\" meter (monologue), a style adopted from Sangam literature.\n\n\"Cilappatikāram\" also referred to as Silappathikaram or Silappatikaram, is the earliest Tamil epic. It is a poem of 5,730 lines in almost entirely akaval (aciriyam) meter and is a tragic love story of a wealthy couple, Kannaki and her husband Kovalan. It is set in Poompuhar a seaport city of the early Chola kingdom. Kannaki and Kovalan are a newly married couple, blissfully in love. Over time, Kovalan meets Madhavi – a courtesan and falls for her, leaves Kannaki and moves in with Madhavi. He spends lavishly on her. Kannaki is heartbroken, but as the chaste woman, she waits despite her husband's unfaithfulness. During the festival for Indra, the rain god, there is a peome recital competition. Kovalan recites a poem about a woman who hurt her lover. Madhavi then recites a song about a man who betrayed his lover. Each interprets the song as a message to the other. Kovalan feels Madhavi is unfaithful to him, leaves her, returns to Kannaki. Kovalan is poor, they move to Madurai, and try to restart their life. Kannaki gives him one from her pair of jeweled anklets to sell and raise capital. Kovalan sells it to a merchant who grows suspicious of the stranger and falsely accuses of theft of the queen' jeweled anklet which is also missing. The king orders his execution, hurrying the checks and processes of justice. Kannaki learns what has happened. She protests the injustice and then proves Kovalan's innocence by breaking the remaining anklet of the pair in the court . The king accepts his mistake. Kannaki curses the king and the people of Madurai, tears off her left breast and throws it at the gathered public. The king dies of heartbreak and the city of Madurai is burnt to the ground. In the third section of the epic, gods and goddesses meet Kannaki and she goes to heaven with god Indra. The royal family of the Chera kingdom learns about her, resolves to build a temple with Kannaki as the featured goddess. They go to the Himalayas, bring a stone, carve her image, call her goddess \"Pattini\", dedicate a temple, order daily prayers, and perform a royal sacrifice.\n\n\"Manimekalai\" , also spelled Manimekhalai or Manimekalai, is a Tamil epic composed by Kulavāṇikaṉ Cittalaic Cātaṉār probably around the 6th century. It is a Buddhist \"anti-love\" sequel to the \"Silappadikaram\", with some characters from it and their next generation. The epic consists of 4,861 lines in akaval meter, arranged in 30 cantos. \"Manimekalai\" is the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi, who follows in her mother's footsteps as a dancer and a Buddhist nun. The epic tells her story. Her physical beauty and artistic achievements seduces the Chola prince Udhayakumara. He pursues her. She, a nun of Mahayana Buddhism persuasion, is committed to free herself from human ties. She rejects his advances, yet finds herself drawn to him. She hides, prays and seeks the help of her mother, her Buddhist teacher Aravana Adikal and angels. They teach her Buddhist mantras to free herself from fears. One angel helps her magically disappear to an island while the prince tries to chase her, grants her powers to change forms and appear as someone else. On the island, she receives a magic begging bowl. Later, she takes the form and dress of a married woman in the neighborhood, as the prince pursues her. The husband sees the prince tease her, and protects \"his wife\" – Manimekalai-in-hiding – by killing the prince. The king and queen learn of their son's death, order the arrest of Manimekalai, arrange a henchman to kill her. Angels intervene and Manimekalai miraculously disappears as others approach her, again. The queen understands and repents. Manimekalai is set free. Manimekalai converts the prison into a hospice to help the needy, teaches the king the dharma of the Buddha. In the final five cantos of the epic, Buddhist teachers recite main doctrines of Buddhism. She goes to goddess Kannaki temple in Vanci (Chera kingdom), prays, listens to different religious scholars, and practices severe self-denial to attain Nirvana (release from rebirths).\n\n\"Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi\", an epic of the 10th century CE was written by Thiruthakka Thevar, a Jain monk. The epic is organized into 13 cantos and contains 3,145 quatrains in viruttam poetic meter. It narrates a supernatural fantasy story of a prince who is the perfect master of all arts, perfect warrior and perfect lover with numerous wives. The epic begins with the story of a treacherous coup, where the king helps his pregnant queen escape in a peacock-shaped air machine but is himself killed. The queen gives birth to a boy. She hands him over to a loyal servant to raise and becomes a nun herself. The boy grows up into a super-human man perfect in every art, every skill, every field of knowledge. He excels in war and peace, kills his enemies, wins over and marries every pretty girl he meets, then regains the kingdom his father had lost. After enjoying power, sex and begetting many sons with his numerous wives, he renounces the world and becomes a Jaina ascetic.\n\nThe \"Kundalakesi\" epic has partially survived into the modern age in fragments, such as in commentaries written centuries later. From these fragments, it appears to be a tragic love story about a Hindu or Jain girl of merchant caste named Kundalakesi who falls in love with Kalan – a Buddhist criminal on a death sentence. The girl's rich merchant father gets the criminal pardoned and freed, the girl marries him. Over time, their love fades and they start irritating each other. During an argument, Kundalakesi reminds him of his criminal past which angers Kalan. A few days later, he invites her to a hike up a hill. When they reach the top, he tells her that he will now kill her. The wife requests that he let circum-ambulate him – her husband – three times like a god, before her death and he agrees. When she is behind him, she pushes her husband over into the valley below and kills him. She feels remorse for her actions and pines for the boy she once fell in love with and married. She meets teachers of various religious traditions, adopts Buddhism, renounces and becomes a nun, then achieves Nirvana. \n\n\"Vaḷaiyāpati\" is another lost work, that has survived in fragments as quoted in other Tamil texts. It is a story of a father who has two wives, abandons one who gives birth to their son, and the son grows up and seeks his real father. The available content and the commentaries that mention \"Valayapathi\", suggest that it was partly a jain text that disputed and criticized other Indian religions, that it supported the ideologies found in early Jainism, such as asceticism, horrors at meat consumption, and monastic aversion to women. It is therefore \"almost certain\" to be a Jain epic, written by a Jain ascetic, states Kamil Zvelebil – a Tamil literature scholar. However, the substantial sections on Shaivism have led to uncertainty.\n\nThe great Tamil commentator Atiyarkkunallar (12th–13th century CE) wrote that poems were of two kinds – \"Col thodar nilai ceyyuḷ\" () or poems connected by virtue of their formal properties and \"Poruḷ toṭar nilai ceyyuḷ\" () or poems connected by virtue of content that forms a unity. \"Cilappatikāram\", the Tamil epic is defined by Atiyarkkunallar as \"Iyal icai nāṭaka poruḷ toṭar nilai ceyyuḷ\" (), poems connected by virtue of content that unites with elements of poetry, music and drama. Such stanzas are defined as \"kāvya\" and \"kappiyam\" in Tamil. In Mayilainathar's commentary (14th century CE) on the grammar \"Nannūl\", we first hear the mention of \"aimperumkappiyam\", the five great epics of Tamil literature.\n\nEach one of these epics have long cantos, like in \"Cilappatikāram\", which has 30 referred as monologues sung by any character in the story or by an outsider as his own monologue related to the dialogues he has known or witnessed. It has 25 cantos composed in \"akaval\" meter, used in most poems in Sangam literature. The alternative for this meter is called \"aicirucappu\" (verse of teachers) associated with verse composed in learned circles. \"Akaval\" is a derived form of verb \"akavu\" which means \"to call\" or \"beckon\". \"Cilappatikāram\" is an example of the claim that folk songs institutionalised literary culture with the best-maintained cultures root back to folk origin. \"Manimekalai\" is an epic in \"ahaval\" metre and is noted for its simple and elegant style of description of natural scenery. \"Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi\" is one of the earliest works of Tamil literature in long verses called \"virutha pa\".\n\nSimilar to the five great epics, Tamil literary tradition classifies five more works as \"Ainchirukappiyangal\" () or five minor epics. The five lesser Tamil epics are \"Neelakesi\", \"Naga kumara kaviyam\", \"Udhyana kumara Kaviyam\", \"Yasodhara Kaviyam\" and \"Soolamani\".\n\nU. V. Swaminatha Iyer (1855–1942 CE) resurrected the first three epics from neglect and wanton destruction of centuries. He reprinted the literature present in the palm leaf form to paper books. Ramaswami Mudaliar, a Tamil scholar first gave him the palm leaves of \"Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi\" to study. Swaminatha Iyer faced difficulties in interpretation, missing leaves, textual errors and unfamiliar terms. He set for journeys to remote villages in search of the manuscripts. After years of toil, he published \"Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi\" in book form in 1887 CE followed by \"Cilappatikāram\" in 1892 CE and \"Manimekalai\" in 1898 CE. Along with the text, he added much commentary and explanatory notes of terms, textual variations and context.\n\n\"After the last line of a poem, nothing follows except literary criticism,\" observes Iḷaṅkō in \"Cilappatikāram\". The postscript invites readers to review the work. the five poems are criticized for being unfamiliar and difficult to understand. To some critics, \"Maṇimēkalai\" is more interesting than \"Cilappatikāram\", but in literary evaluation, it seems inferior. The story of \"Maṇimēkalai\" with all its superficial elements seems to be of lesser interest to the author whose aim was pointed toward spread of Buddhism. In the former, ethics and religious are artistic, while in the latter reverse is the case. \"Maṇimēkalai\" criticizes Jainism and preaches the ideals of Buddhism, and human interest is diluted in supernatural features. The narration in \"akaval\" meter moves on in \"Maṇimēkalai\" without the relief of any lyric, which are the main features of \"Cilappatikāram\". \"Maṇimēkalai\" in puritan terms is not an epic poem, but a grave disquisition on philosophy.\n\nThere are effusions in \"Cilappatikāram\" in the form of a song or a dance, which does not go well with the Western audience as they are assessed to be inspired on the spur of the moment. Calcutta review claims that the three works on a whole have no plotand insufficnient length characterization for an epic genre. They believe plot of \"Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi\" is monotonous and deficient in variety in strength and character and does not stand the quality of an epic.\n\nThere have been multiple movies based on \"Silappathikaram\". The most famous is the portrayal of Kannagi by actress Kannamba in the 1942 Tamil movie \"Kannagi\" with P.U. Chinnappa as Kovalan. The movie faithfully follows the story of \"Silappathikaram\" and was a hit when it was released. The movie \"Poompuhar\", penned by M. Karunanidhi, is also based on \"Silapathikaram\". There are multiple dance dramas as well by some of the exponents of Bharatanatyam (a South Indian dance form) in Tamil as most of the verses of \"Silappathikaram\" can be set to music.\n\n\"Maṇimēkalai\" has been shot as a teleserial in Doordarshan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1830657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830657", "title": "Free Me (album)", "text": "Free Me (album)\n\nFree Me is the second solo studio album by English singer Emma Bunton. It was released on 9 February 2004 by 19 Recordings. The album peaked at number seven on the UK Albums Chart and spawned three top-10 singles: \"Free Me\", \"Maybe\" and \"I'll Be There\".\n\nIn 2001, Bunton released her solo debut album \"A Girl Like Me\" through Virgin Records. It spent over 12 weeks inside the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number four and earning a gold certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It also produced her only solo chart-topper \"What Took You So Long?\", as well as the top-five singles \"What I Am\" and \"Take My Breath Away\", and the top-20 entry \"We're Not Gonna Sleep Tonight\". When it came to her second album, her record company \"came to me and said, 'Let's do a demo thing for the second album.' And I thought, 'Hold on a minute.' Not a lot of people know this, but I actually walked away from it. We put so much into it, and when they don't give you that support anymore, it's quite heartbreaking\", says Bunton. \"I said, 'Thank you very much for the demo idea, but I want to take this where I know people are going to be right behind me and work as hard as I do.'\"\n\nThe album was largely produced by Mike Peden and Yak Bondy, who have produced tracks for acts such as S Club 7 and Lucie Silvas. Other contributions on the album are courtesy of Cathy Dennis, Henry Binns, and Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi. The album was released via 19 Recordings, which is a division of 19 Management, the company owned by Simon Fuller. Bunton says of the inspiration behind the album: \"I've been listening to Motown since I was about five, and just loving it, being very passionate about the fact how it was all done live, and I thought, 'Hold on, I always talk about the fact I love '60s and Motown', so I thought I'd take elements of it, bits of it, and put it into my album, so that's exactly what I did.\" However, Bunton's songs on this album mainly started life as a simple scribble. She says, \"I have a little book beside my bed, where I put all my ideas for songs and stuff. It's kind of weird, 'cuz usually when I'm having a dream, I'll wake up, and I'll write something down, then I'll look at it again and think, 'God, what was I dreaming about?'\"\n\nThe album's lead single, \"Free Me\", was released in May 2003. The song immediately picked up airplay, peaking at number five on the UK Singles Chart. \n\n\"Maybe\" was released as the second single in October 2003, and also gained extensive airplay throughout the United Kingdom, peaking at number six.\n\nIn January 2004, \"I'll Be There\" was released as the third single from the album. Like its two predecessors, it performed well on the charts, peaking at number seven on the UK chart.\n\nLater in the year, in May, \"Crickets Sing for Anamaria\", was released as the fourth single. The song peaked at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn the United States, both \"Free Me\" and \"Maybe\" were dance club regulars, reaching numbers four and six on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart, respectively.\n\nThe album was acclaimed by critics for its catchy and fun use of sounds from the Motown and the 1960s era. BBC Music says the album is \"light and frothy, like a good cappuccino, but this time it's with the sugar taken out\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave a positive review saying, \"This music is stylish without being flashy, thanks in large part to the charmingly tuneful, sturdy songs (all but one bearing a writing credit from Emma). While Bunton may still have a small, sweet voice, she's developed a stronger presence on record, giving this album not just a face, but a fetching persona that's hard to resist\".\n\nAccording to Lynsey Hanley from newspaper \"The Daily Telegraph\", Bunton's new musical direction was \"a brave move, given that high-sheen, saucy R&B is currently the main mode of expression for female pop performers, but Emma's lilting vocals and only faintly suggestive image suit this album's less aggressive style\".\n\n\"The album's got charm, grace and it's fun\", said \"Q\" magazine. \"Marie Claire\" magazine said it \"mixes up bossa nova with James Bond soundtrack\" and that \"Emma resembles a seductive Brigitte Bardot\".\n\nNotes\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Free Me\".\n\n\nsalesref=\n"}

It accepts for competition only films by African filmmakers and chiefly produced in Africa. FESPACO is scheduled in March every second year, two weeks after the last Saturday of February. Its opening night is held in the Stade du 4-Août, the national stadium.\n\nThe festival offers African film professionals the chance to establish working relationships, exchange ideas, and to promote their work. FESPACO's stated aim is to \"contribute to the expansion and development of African cinema as means of expression, education and awareness-raising\". It has also worked to establish a market for African films and industry professionals. Since FESPACO's founding, the festival has attracted attendees from across the continent and beyond.\n\nCreated in 1969, it was first called the Pan-African film and television festival of Ouagadougou. It has evolved into an internationally recognized and respected event. Alimata Salambere, the cultural minister of Burkina Faso from 1987 to 1991, was one of the founders of the festival. At its third edition in 1972, the festival was named FESPACO for short, keeping its full title as \"Festival pan-Africain du cinema et de la television de Ouagadougou.\" FESPACO was recognized formally as an institution by governmental decree on January 7, 1972. Its award ceremony and base of operations is Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, where the annual awards ceremony is also held.\n\nIn 1972 the first winner of the best film award was \"Le Wazzou Polygame\" by Oumarou Ganda of Niger. Since then, the best film award has been won by directors from Cameroon, Morocco, Mali, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Burkina Faso, Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nAt the festival's founding in 1969, five African nations: Upper Volta (Burkina Faso), Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Niger and Senegal, were represented, as well as France and the Netherlands. A total of 23 films were shown. At its second edition, the participant African countries rose to nine, including for the first time Algeria, Tunisia, Guinea, Mali, and Ghana, and a total of 40 films were shown. In 1983, the festival included MICA (\"le Marche International du Cinema et de la television Africaine\"), a market for African film stock and video footage.\n\nFrom 1985 onward, the festival adopted different themes for the annual event, starting with \"the cinema, people, and liberation\". The theme for the 2007 festival was \"the actor in the creation and promotion of African films\".\n\nAs the festival became more prominent, its budget and sponsors increased; the donor countries include Burkina Faso, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Republic of China. Donor organizations include AIF (ACCT), PNUD, UNESCO, UNICEF, European Union and Africalia. Due to its international recognition, FESPACO has enabled African filmmakers to show their talents and sell their products in the international market, as well as to promote development of African products and technicians in the industry.\n\nThe general secretaries of FESPACO since 1972 have been Louis Tombiano, from 1972 to 1982; Alimata Salembere, from 1982 to 1984; Filippe Savadogo, from 1984 to 1996, Baba Hama, from 1996 to 2008, Michel Ouedraogo, from 2008 to 2014, and Ardiouma Soma, from 2014 to present.\n\n\nThe most prestigious award of the festival is the \"\"Étalon de Yennenga\"\" (Stallion of Yennenga), named after the legendary founder of the Mossi empire. The \"\"Étalon de Yennenga\"\" is awarded to the African film that best shows \"Africa's realities\".\n\nOther special awards include the Oumarou Ganda Prize, given for the best first film, and the Paul Robeson Prize for the best film by a director of the African diaspora. (The latter is named for a major 20th-century American actor, singer and civil rights activist in the United States.)\n\n\n"}

Rodriguez spoke Spanish until he went to a Catholic school at 6. As a youth in Sacramento, California, he delivered newspapers and worked as a gardener. He graduated from Sacramento's Christian Brothers High School.\n\nRodriguez received a B.A. from Stanford University, an M.A. from Columbia University, was a Ph.D. candidate in English Renaissance literature at the University of California, Berkeley, and attended the Warburg Institute in London on a Fulbright fellowship. A noted prose stylist, Rodriguez has worked as a teacher, international journalist, and educational consultant, and he has appeared regularly on the Public Broadcasting Service show, \"NewsHour\". Rodriguez's visual essays, \"Richard Rodriguez Essays\", on \"The News Hour with Jim Lehrer\" earned Rodriguez a Peabody Award in 1997. Rodriguez’s books include \"Hunger of Memory: The Education of Richard Rodriguez\" (1982), a collection of autobiographical essays; \"Mexico's Children\" (1990); \"Days of Obligation: An Argument With My Mexican Father\" (1992), which was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize; \"Brown: The Last Discovery of America\" (2002); and \"Darling: A Spiritual Autobiography\" (2013). Rodriguez's works have also been published in \"Harper's Magazine\", \"Mother Jones\", and \"Time\".\n\nInstead of pursuing a career in academia, Rodriguez suddenly decided to write freelance and take other temporary jobs. Rodriguez worked as a contributing editor to newspapers and magazines, including \"Harpers\" and the \"Los Angeles Times.\" His first book, \"Hunger of Memory: The Education of Richard Rodriguez\", was published in 1982. It was an account of his journey from being a \"socially disadvantaged child\" to becoming a fully assimilated American, from the Spanish-speaking world of his family to the wider, presumably freer, public world of English. However, the journey was not without costs: his American identity was achieved only after a painful separation from his past, his family, and his culture. \"Americans like to talk about the importance of family values,\" said Rodriguez. \"But America isn't a country of family values; Mexico is a country of family values. This is a country of people who leave home.\"\n\nWhile the book received widespread critical acclaim and won several literary awards, it also stirred resentment because of Rodriguez's strong stands against bilingual education and affirmative action. Some Mexican Americans called him \"pocho\", Americanized Mexican, accusing him of betraying himself and his people. Others called him a \"coconut,\" brown on the outside, but white on the inside. He calls himself \"a comic victim of two cultures.\"\n\nRodriguez's most recent book, \"Darling: A Spiritual Autobiography\" (2013), explores the important symbolism of the desert in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. In an interview before the book came out, Rodriguez reported that he was \"interested in the fact that three great monotheistic religions were experienced within this ecology.\" A sample of the project appeared in \"Harper's Magazine\" (January 2008). In this essay, \"The God of the Desert: Jerusalem and the Ecology of Monotheism,\" Rodriguez portrays the desert as a paradoxical temple, its emptiness the requisite for God's elusive presence.\n\nRodriguez is gay.

Willard Marriott Library is the main academic library of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah. The university library has had multiple homes since the first University of Utah librarian was appointed in 1850. The current building was opened in 1968 and named for J. Willard Marriott, founder of Marriott International, in 1969. After two major renovations, the building is more than and houses more than 4.5 million volumes. The University of Utah Press and Red Butte Press are divisions of the Marriott Library.\n\nThe first University of Utah librarian was appointed in 1850, the same year the school was founded. University president John R. Park opened a library and reading room stocked with his personal collection of books on loan to the university in 1874. The library moved to the LeRoy Cowles Building in 1900 and the George Thomas Library Building in 1935, both on Presidents Circle. The current five-story building was opened in 1968 and was named for J. Willard Marriott in 1969 when he contributed $1 million for library collections, the largest single contribution ever received by the university at that time.\n\nThe library was expanded in 1996, which almost doubled the library's size, and was expanded again during a major renovation between 2005 and 2009. The purpose of this renovation was to improve the seismic stability of the building, provide clearer pathways through the building, improve environmental controls, and allow for more natural light. Several additions were also made to the building including an automated storage and retrieval system that can store up to 2 million items, a larger computer lab, additional classrooms and teaching labs, a new indoor café, a rooftop garden, and additional study areas including the George S. Eccles Grand Reading Room.\n\nThe library's Special Collections department collects, preserves, and makes available books, periodicals, documents, photographs, films, and original materials, particularly those documenting the history of Utah, the Mormons, the West, the Middle East, and the University of Utah. These collections include the papers of Marriner Stoddard Eccles, Chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1934 to 1938; David O. McKay, ninth President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Leonidas Ralph Mecham, Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts from 1985 to 2006; and Wallace Stegner, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1972. Materials are accessible to all patrons, regardless of their status.\n\nThe library hosts over 100 unique digital collections, many of which include items from Special Collections. Digital collections include USpace, Utah Digital Newspapers, the Western Soundscape Archive, and the Western Waters Digital Library. The library also hosts the Mountain West Digital Library, a digital collaborative program of the Utah Academic Library Consortium. The library provides access to print on demand books via an Espresso Book Machine.\n\nThe Aziz S.

It is a collection of some of Springsteen's hit singles and popular album tracks through the years along with four new songs at the end, mostly recorded with the E Street Band in 1995. The latter constituted Springsteen's first (albeit very partial) release with his backing band since the late 1980s. Some of the songs are shorter versions of the original album releases.\n\nThe incorporation of the \"new\" tracks was portrayed in the 1996 documentary \"Blood Brothers\". \"Murder Incorporated\" and \"This Hard Land\" were, in fact, unused 1982 songs from the \"Born in the U.S.A.\" sessions, with the latter being re-recorded here more than a decade later, and both subsequently became Springsteen concert staples. \"Blood Brothers\", on the other hand, was played only as the final closing song of both the 1999–2000 Reunion Tour and 2002–2003 Rising Tour, both times with an extra verse added. \"Secret Garden\" achieved notoriety via the soundtrack of the 1996 film \"Jerry Maguire\". Alternate versions of several of these new tracks were released on the 1996 \"Blood Brothers\" EP.\n\nThe compilation was commercially successful, hitting the peaks of the U.S. album chart and UK Album Chart and selling more than four million copies in the U.S.\n\nThe reception by music critics of \"Greatest Hits\" was rather negative upon the album's release, as are more contemporary reviews. David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt that the album was released when it was because the Grammy Awards were coming up and \"Streets of Philadelphia\" was up for five awards and that the songs on the album were selected because of charting success, which means that several important songs were overlooked. He also felt that \"Murder Incorporated\" (in reference to the 1930s Murder, Inc.) was the only good new song on the album and that overall the album felt as if Bruce did not believe in himself any more. \n\nThe \"Rolling Stone\" review of the album by Parke Puterbaugh is rather unfavorable. Parke felt that the songs on the collection belonged on their original LP releases, that songs from before \"Born to Run\" should have been included and that the new songs weren't that good. A more contemporary review by Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine is also unfavorable, saying that a lot of Bruce's hits and popular album tracks were missing, that \"Murder Incorporated\" was better than the other new songs, and that \"The Essential Bruce Springsteen\" was much better than \"Greatest Hits\".\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 the week of March 18, 1995 with more than 250,000 copies sold, it remained on the chart for forty-three weeks. As of March, 2009 it has sold over 4,092,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan. It was certified four times platinum by the RIAA on July 23, 1999 for shipments of 4,000,000. \n\nIn the United Kingdom the album entered at number one on March 11, 1995, and topped the chart for two non consecutive weeks. It was present on the chart for one hundred thirty four weeks. It was certified four times platinum by the BPI on March 21, 2014 denoting shipments of 1,200,000 units.\n"}

This does not mean that the organisation does not campaign. The organisation believes that it is effectively easier to 'form the minds of the young instead of attempting to amend adult ones.' Therefore, by educating the young, next generations will be equipped with environmentally aware citizens. The project also has a special division which visits companies and other organisations to educate their employees or members, on the current environmental issues which our planet is suffering due to human activities.\n\nThe Amazonia Conference is considered to be the biggest educational project in Portugal (Diário de Notícias, 2000), and has recently received the British Airways Best Environmental Project Award 2004.\n\nThe Amazonia Conference was established in 1990 by Professor Valdir Bento, physicist and former head of NASA's Laser technology department.

It is particularly associated with the agricultural region in the Snake River Plain located in the area. The northern Magic Valley region — particularly Blaine and Camas Counties — is also known as the Wood River Valley after the Big Wood River.\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census the counties of the Magic Valley region had a combined population of 185,790, or nearly 12% of Idaho. Twin Falls is the region's largest city and metropolitan area. Burley is the principal city of the region's other micropolitan area. Other cities include Jerome, Rupert, Gooding, Wendell, Bliss, Hagerman and Hailey.\n\nThe name \"Magic Valley\" is a reference to the construction of Milner and Minidoka Dams and a series of irrigation canal systems (such as the Gooding Milner canal) on the Snake River during the first decade of the 20th century. In a short time these projects \"magically\" transformed what had been considered a nearly uninhabitable area into some of the most productive farmland in the northwestern U.S. Many cities and towns in the region were founded between 1900 and 1910 as a direct result of these projects.\n\nThe College of Southern Idaho (CSI) in Twin Falls is the Magic Valley's only college. Most of the region's cities and towns support separate public school districts.\n\nCultural events are routinely held at CSI. County fairs are held throughout the region in the late summer, the largest being the Twin Falls County Fair in Filer during the week immediately preceding Labor Day. The Sun Valley resort in Blaine County hosts several attractions throughout the year. The town of Hagerman hosts a large blues fest in September.\n\nThe Magic Valley is home to the Magic Valley Arts Council, a non-profit umbrella arts organization that serves the greater Twin Falls area and surrounding 8-county Magic Valley region. The organization's mission is to \"foster and promote experiences in the arts for all people in the Greater Twin Falls.\" It is an association of arts organizations, individuals, educational institutions and businesses looking for opportunities to improve the quality of life in the Magic Valley area by providing arts and cultural opportunities. Annual events and programs include Kids Art in the Park, Arts on Tour, Brown Bag Lecture Series, theatrical productions, the Full Moon Gallery of Fine Art and Contemporary Craft, public art projects and many others.\n\nPopular leisure activities in the Magic Valley include camping, hunting and fishing. Skiing at several resorts throughout the region is one of the most popular winter activities. Jackpot, Nevada, which is closely associated with the Magic Valley region, offers casino gaming. The Perrine Bridge draws many BASE jumpers from around the world. It is the only man-made structure in the USA that is legally jumpable without a permit.\n\nImportant agricultural commodities in the Magic Valley include beans, sugar beets, corn (maize) and potatoes. Dairy production is also significant, especially in Jerome and Gooding Counties.\n\n"}

{"id": "1830721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830721", "title": "Duty to retreat", "text": "Duty to retreat\n\nIn law, the duty to retreat, or requirement of safe retreat, is a legal requirement in some jurisdictions that a threatened person cannot harm another in self-defense (especially lethal force) when it is possible to instead retreat to a place of safety. This requirement contrasts with right in some other jurisdictions to \"stand one's ground\", meaning being allowed to defend one's self instead of retreating.\n\nIt is a specific component which sometimes appears in the criminal defense of self-defense, and which must be addressed if criminal defendants are to prove that their conduct was justified.\n\nMost U.S. jurisdictions have a stand-your-ground law enacted or in practice, with only Washington, D.C. requiring a person to retreat from an attack and allow the use of deadly force in self-defense only when retreat is not possible, or when retreat poses a danger to the person under attack. The duty to retreat is not universal, however. For example, police officers are not required to retreat when acting in the line of duty. \n\nOther states apply what is known as the castle doctrine, whereby a threatened person need not retreat within his or her own dwelling or place of work. Sometimes this has been the result of court rulings that one need not retreat in a place where one has a special right to be. In other states, this has been accomplished by statute, such as that suggested by the Model Penal Code.\n\nStill other states have passed stand your ground laws that do not require an individual to retreat and allow one to match force for force, deadly force for deadly force. \n\nMost state legal systems began by importing English Common Law such as Acts of Parliament of 2 Ed. III (Statute of Northampton), and 5 Rich. II of 1381 (Forcible Entry Act 1381)—which imposed criminal sanctions intending to discourage the resort to self-help. This required a threatened party to retreat, whenever property was \"involved\" and resolve the issue by civil means.\n\nToday, the majority of American states have construed their statutes of forcible entry, both penal and civil, in such a manner as to abrogate (i.e. abolish) the common law privilege to use force in the recovery of possession of land.\n\nIn \"Erwin v. State\" (1876), the Supreme Court of Ohio wrote that a \"true man\", one without fault, would not retreat. In \"Runyan v. State\" (1877), the Indiana court rejected a duty to retreat, implying it was un-American, writing of a referring to the distinct American mind, \"the tendency of the American mind seems to be very strongly against\" a duty to retreat. The court went further in saying that no statutory law could require a duty to retreat, because the right to stand one's ground is \"founded on the law of nature; and is not, nor can be, superseded by any law of society.\"\n\nIn English law the focus of the test is whether the defendant is acting reasonably in the particular situation. There is no specific requirement that a person must retreat in anticipation of an attack. Although some withdrawal would be useful evidence to prove that the defendant did not want to fight, not every defendant is able to escape. In \"R v Bird\" the defendant was physically attacked, and reacted instinctively and immediately without having the opportunity to retreat. Had there been a delay in the response, the reaction might have appeared more revenge than self-defense.\n\nAs to carrying weapons in anticipation of an attack, \"Evans v Hughes\" held that for a defendant to justify his possession of a metal bar on a public highway, he had to show that there was an imminent particular threat affecting the particular circumstances in which the weapon was carried. Similarly, in \"Taylor v Mucklow\" a building owner was held to be using an unreasonable degree of force in carrying a loaded airgun against a builder who was demolishing a new extension because his bills were unpaid. More dramatically, in \"AG's Reference (No 2 of 1983)\" Lord Lane held that a defendant who manufactured ten petrol bombs to defend his shop during the Toxteth riots could set up the defense of showing that he possessed an explosive substance \"for a lawful purpose\" if he could establish that he was acting in self-defense to protect himself or his family or property against an imminent and apprehended attack by means which he believed to be no more than reasonably necessary to meet the attack.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1830725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830725", "title": "The 300 Spartans", "text": "The 300 Spartans\n\nThe 300 Spartans is a 1962 CinemaScope epic film depicting the Battle of Thermopylae. Made with the cooperation of the Greek government, it was shot in the village of Perachora in the Peloponnese. The working title was \"Lion of Sparta\". It stars Richard Egan as the Spartan king Leonidas, Sir Ralph Richardson as Themistocles of Athens and David Farrar as Persian king Xerxes, with Diane Baker as Ellas and Barry Coe as Phylon providing the requisite romantic element in the film. Greek warriors, led by 300 Spartans, fight against a Persian army of almost limitless size. Despite the odds, the Spartans will not flee or surrender, even if it means their deaths.\n\nWhen it was released in 1962, critics saw the movie as a commentary on the Cold War, referring to the independent Greek states as \"the only stronghold of freedom remaining in the then known world\", holding out against the Persian \"slave empire\".\n\nKing Xerxes of Persia leads a vast army of soldiers into Europe to defeat the small city-states of Greece, not only to fulfill the idea of \"one world ruled by one master\", but also to avenge the defeat of his father Darius at the Battle of Marathon ten years before. Accompanying him are Artemisia, the Queen of Halicarnassus, who beguiles Xerxes with her feminine charm, and Demaratus, an exiled king of Sparta, to whose warnings Xerxes pays little heed.\n\nIn Corinth, Themistocles of Athens wins the support of the Greek allies and convinces both the delegates and the Spartan representative, warrior king Leonidas I, to grant Sparta leadership of their forces. Outside the hall, Leonidas and Themistocles agree to fortify the narrow pass at Thermopylae until the rest of the army arrives. After this, Leonidas learns of the Persian advance and travels to Sparta to spread the news and rally the rest of the troops.\n\nIn Sparta, his fellow king Leotychidas is fighting a losing battle with the Ephors over the religious harvest festival of Carnea that is due to take place, with members of the council arguing that the army should wait until after the festival is over before it marches, while Leotychidas fears that by that time the Persians may have conquered Greece. Leonidas decides to march north immediately with his personal bodyguard of 300 men, who are exempt from the decisions of the Ephors and the Gerousia. They are subsequently reinforced by about 700 volunteer Thespians led by Demophilus and few other Greek allies.\n\nAfter several days of fighting, Xerxes grows angry as his army is repeatedly routed by the Greeks, with the Spartans in the forefront. Leonidas receives word sent by his wife that, by decision of the Ephors, the remainder of the Spartan army, rather than joining him as he had expected, will only fortify the isthmus in the Peloponnese and will advance no further. The Greeks constantly beat back the Persians, and following the defeat of most of his personal bodyguard in battle against the Spartans plus the killing/death of Xerxes' own two brothers, Xerxes begins to consider withdrawing to Sardis until he can equip a larger force at a later date. As he prepares to withdraw, as advised by Artemesia (who, having a Greek mother, has her own agenda to dissuade the king from continuing invasion), Xerxes however, receives word from the treacherous and avaricious Ephialtes of a secret old goat-track through the mountains that will enable his forces to attack the Greeks from the rear. Promising to richly reward the traitorous goatherd for his betrayal (just as Ephialtes had expected) an emboldened Xerxes sends his army onward.\n\nOnce Leonidas realizes he will be surrounded, he sends away the Greek allies to alert the cities to the south. Being too few to hold the pass, the Spartans instead attack the Persian front, where Xerxes is nearby. Leonidas is killed in the melée. Meanwhile, the Thespians, who had refused to leave, are overwhelmed (offscreen) while defending the rear. Surrounded, the surviving Spartans refuse Xerxes's demand to give up Leonidas' body. They are then all annihilated as the remaining Immortals rain down a barrage of arrowfire.\n\nAfter this, narration states that the Battle of Salamis and the Battle of Plataea end the Persian invasion, which could not have been organized and victorious without the time bought by the 300 Spartans who defied the tyranny of Xerxes at Thermopylae. One of the final images of the film is the stone memorial bearing the epigram of Simonides of Ceos, which the narrator recites in honour of the slain 300 Spartan men's bravery :\n\n\"Oh stranger, tell the Spartans that we lie here obedient to their word.\" \n\nThen ends with : \"...But it was more than a victory for Greece, it was a stirring example to free people throughout the world of what a few brave men can accomplish once they refuse to submit to tyranny!\"\n\nThe battle scenes were shot near the village of Perachora, on the mainland side of the Corinth Canal, as it was impossible to shoot at the actual location in Thermopylae, where 2,500 years of silt had shrunk the Malian Gulf drastically since the battle in 480 BCE, turning the strait where the battle was fought into a broad coastal plain. The Greek Defense Ministry agreed to make available to the producers up to 5,000 members of the Hellenic Army for a pre-negotiated fee. However, the film's budgetary constraints reduced the numbers drawn to only two battalions (approximately 1,100 men). The largest establishing scenes, of the Persian Army entering Greece, utilized many of these soldiers, together with a combined total of several hundred civilian extras, horses, cattle, ox carts, and chariots. For the wider establishing scenes of the battle, one battalion was retained to play both Greeks and Persians. For closer compositions of the fighting and encampments, military extras were called (call-sheeted) by company-size or smaller units, in meeting the specific needs of the day's shooting schedule. Director of Photography Geoffrey Unsworth made good use of the tree groves, which lined the coastal plain aside the \"Limni Vouliagmeni\" lagoon, to cover for the obvious deficiency in the number of troops that would have been amassed on the Persian-side of the battle line.\n\nOriginally developed as an Italian sword-and-sandal project, the cooperation and blessing of the Greek government allowed the producers to both finance and complete the production on a budget of 500,000 GBP () or approximately US$1,350,000 (), roughly twice for what most Italian peplum films were being made at the time. \"The 300 Spartans\" was the last film of Richard Egan's seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox. It was also the last film appearance of David Farrar, who then chose to retire from acting.\n\nIn 1970, despite the attributed Cold War connotations, the film was dubbed in Russian and shown in the USSR. The film proved to be very popular, with 27.1 million total viewers.\n\n\nFrank Miller's 1998 graphic novel \"300\" depicts the same Battle of Thermopylae. The comic artist saw \"The 300 Spartans\" as a boy and said \"it changed the course of my creative life\". In 2006, his book was adapted into a successful film of the same name directed by Zack Snyder.\n\n\n"}

He never reached the battlefield, as his train was hit by a shell, wounding Hamvas, who was discharged.\nIn 1919 his father refused to take an oath of allegiance to Czechoslovakia, whereupon his family was expelled from Bratislava. They moved to Budapest, where Hamvas attended Péter Pázmány University. After graduation he became a journalist at the newspapers \"Budapesti Hírlap\" and \"Szózat\". Hamvas considered this job shallow and humiliating, but he had to support his family (his father received a pension from 1924). Three years later he quit, as he had found a better job in the main library of Budapest. He was appointed as a senior librarian in 1927. By this time he was writing articles, reviews and essays for 25 different journals. He married Ilona Angyal in 1929, but divorced in 1936 to marry Katalin Kemény in 1937. She was his partner in founding the Sziget circle, a literary group which later gained prominent members like Antal Szerb, Károly Kerényi, László Németh, or Antal Molnár.\n\nNearly 20 years of library work was ended by World War II. Hamvas was drafted for military service three times. He continued his literary work while on the front lines - translating Laozi and Heraclitus among others. His first essay collection was published in 1943.\n\nThe couple survived the siege of Budapest. Their apartment was hit by bombing, destroying his library and manuscripts. Despite the Soviet siege and repeated harassment by the authorities, 1945 to 1947 were his most fruitful years.\n\nIn 1948 he was placed on the b-list (banned from publishing) by the Soviet installed socialist government, and was forced into retirement from his library job. Although he had published more than 250 works before his ban, most of Hamvas's body of work was written anonymously later on. He got a licence to farm in the garden of his brother-in-law in Szentendre, and tended plants there between 1948 and 1951, during which time he also completed \"Karnevál\", one of his major essays.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1964 he was employed as an unskilled worker in power plants in Tiszapalkonya, Inota and Bokod, under harsh conditions. Whenever he had spare time he translated from Sanskrit, Hebrew and Greek, and wrote about the Cabala, Zen, and Sufism. Between 1959 and 1966 he completed \"Patmosz\", his last major work.\n\nAged 67, he finally received a pension. Béla Hamvas died of a hemorrhagic stroke in 1968. He is buried in Szentendre.\n\nIn 1990 he posthumously received the Kossuth Prize.\n\nHe was a great thinker and essayist who integrated Eastern and Western traditions as well as posing many serious questions about the modern age, together with the possibility of resolving them. According to one of his central thoughts: \"\"The present eon, since 600 B.C. stands in the sign of personal salvation. Only since this time is there a notion of humanity, because there is only one single collective category of personality and this is humanity.\"\"\n\nBéla Hamvas found his form of expression in the essay, a genre at once literary and philosophical. His early essays were published in \"Magyar Hüperion\" (1936, \"Hungarian Hyperion\"), marking the end of his first period of thinking, to be followed by \"Szellem és egzisztencia\" (1941, \"Spirit and Existence\"), an essay discussing the philosophy of Karl Jaspers, one of the main inspirations for Hamvas’ thinking. He published a selection of essays on literature, psychology, philosophy and cultural history in \"A láthatatlan történet\" (1943, \"The Invisible Story\"). Analyzing the spiritual crisis of the age, Hamvas read himself into the metaphysical tradition, the collective spiritual knowledge of humanity conveyed by sacred books. His collection \"Scientia Sacra\" (the first six volumes, 1942–43) served to direct the attention of the age towards the philosophy of the Far East (The Upanishads, Tao Te King, The Tibetan Book of the Dead and others) and European mysticism. From 1945 Hamvas belonged to the spiritual renaissance for three years, during which time he edited the series Leaflets of the University Press, held lectures and published the metaphysical \"Anthologia humana: Ötezer év bölcsessége\" (1946, \"Human Anthology – The Wisdom of Five Millennia\"), the fourth edition of which was banned and pulped by the socialist regime. His essays written together with his wife on the history of art \"Forradalom a művészetben: Absztrakció és szürrealizmus Magyarországon\" (1947, \"Revolution in Art: Abstraction and Surrealism in Hungary\") survey Hungarian art from Károly Ferenczy, Tivadar Csontváry Kosztka and Lajos Gulácsy up to the activity of the “European School”. Hamvas saw in surrealism and abstract art the heritage of magic, the “tremendous presence of a higher existence”, and opposed “realistic” art. This concept of modern art was attacked by the Marxist ideologist, György Lukács, and Hamvas was dismissed from the library and silenced for the rest of his life. His writings were published in samizdat.\n\nHis essays are grounded in tradition, their sense of humour is granted by knowledge, and humour, in turn, grants their freedom. \"Unicornis, Titkos Jegyzőkönyv, Silentium\" (1948–51, \"Unicorn, Secret Protocol, Silence\") were published as late as 1987, but were written alongside Hamvas’s great novel, \"Karnevál\" (1948–51, \"Carnival\", published in 1985). This Magnum Opus, also called a “catalogue of fate”, a “human comedy”, spans continents and ages, Heaven and Hell. Hamvas’ three shorter novels, \"Szilveszter\" (1957, \"New Year’s Eve\"), \"Bizonyos tekintetben\" (1961, \"From a Certain Aspect\") and \"Ugyanis\" (1966–67, \"Therefore\") were published together in 1991, followed by his collection of essays, \"Patmosz\" (1959–1966; \"Patmos\") in 1992, whose title alludes to John the Apostle’s exile to the island of Patmos, and the second part of \"Scientia Sacra: az őskori emberiség szellemi hagyománya II. rész: A kereszténység\" (1960–64, \"Sacred Science – Spiritual Heritage of Mankind, part II. Christianity\") published in 1988.\n\n\n"}

A devout churchman, learned scholar, and reforming schoolmaster, Sewell was strongly influenced by the Tractarians.\n\nBorn on the Newport, Isle of Wight, the second son of a solicitor and Fellow of The Queen's College, Oxford, he had six brothers, four of whom became national figures. Richard Clarke Sewell was a recognised poet, legal writer and Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford. Henry Sewell worked in the family firm before emigrating to become Premier of New Zealand. James Edwards Sewell was Warden of New College, Oxford (1860–1903). Elizabeth Missing Sewell wrote devotional religious books and children's stories. She founded Ventnor St Boniface School for girls.\n\nSewell was educated at Winchester, which he disliked because he was bullied. He went up to Merton College, Oxford, where he gained a postmastership and a first in Literae Humaniores. He was elected a Petreian Fellow of Exeter College in 1827, and then won both the Chancellor's English Essay Prize and the Chancellor's Latin Essay Prize. Still aged only twenty-six, he was ordained. From 1831 to 1853 he was a tutor there, an Examiner in Greats, Librarian to the College, Sub-Rector, and by 1839 also Dean.\n\nIn 1835 he tried for the Headmastership of Winchester, but was defeated by Dr Moberley by one vote. From 1836 to 1841 he was White's Professor of Moral Philosophy. Sewell, who took holy orders in 1830, aged only twenty-six, was a friend of Pusey, Newman, Keble and R. H. Froude in the earlier days of the Tractarian movement, but subsequently considered that the Tractarians leaned too much towards Rome, and dissociated himself from them. His novel \"Hawkstone\" was opposed to Newman's position at the time. When, however, in 1849, JA Froude published his \"Nemesis of Faith\", Sewell denounced the wickedness of the book to his class, and, when one of his pupils confessed to the possession of a copy, seized it, tore it to pieces, and threw it in the fire. He was a prolific writer of numerous sermons, commentaries, poetry and translations. He also had a large number of correspondents, including William Gladstone. He contributed to the political \"Quarterly Review\" on various subjects that interested him. Sewell was supremely confident, had a winning manner, but lacked the droll humour of the cloistered academics.\n\nIn April 1843 he, with some friends, Monsell and Todd, founded at Stackallan House, County Meath, St Columba's College, designed to be a sort of Irish Winchester and Eton \"and something more than Winchester or Eton.\" In 1861 the Clarendon Commission defined it as a public school, but Sewells aim was to provide an Anglican education for the ailing Church in Ireland, with emphasis on pastoral care and rigorous classical disciplines. The school was supported by the nobility and church. From Lord Boyne Singleton and Sewell rented the land with conspicuous approval of the Archbishop of Armagh, Lord George de la Poer Beresford, the College's Governor. Set in beautiful countryside Sewell hoped to inspire boys \"in locis parentis\", give them cubicles to live in, and \"strengthen, enlarge and purify their minds.\" With the classics they were to teach modern languages, modern history and mathematics, drawing, architecture and the Irish language.\n\nSewell was disliked at St Columba's. In spite of his trips to raise much-needed funds, they had shown bad faith towards a financial supporter who brought much furniture and silver to the College. His connections at Oxford, particularly Magdalen College, were useful. Another substantial Sewell contribution was a large library collection. His colleagues wanted a more relaxed Irish Gaelic school, whereas he was known to have punished boys for failing to show good table manners befitting young gentlemen. Cold showers and hard beatings were necessary, but Sewell believed the most dreaded exclusion to be from chapel. Emphasis on regular attendance at Evensong and Matins was central to his scholastic vision of a High Church interpretation of the \"Book of Common Prayer\". While he also gained a reputation for high standards of cleanliness and medical health. Singleton agreed with Sewell that there must be fasting and feast days, but this offended Irish Protestant sensibilities. The Fellows Lord Adare and William Monsell converted to Roman Catholicism. In May 1846 he resigned with Warden Singleton to return to Oxford and Exeter College, having been outvoted by the Fellows of St Columba's. \nSingleton met in Turl Street to discuss the opening of another college. On 9 June 1847, he helped to found Radley College, installing Singleton as Warden. Sewell's intention was that each of these schools should be conducted on strict High Church principles.\n\nSewell was originally himself one of the managers of St Columba's, and later the third Warden of Radley, but his business management was not successful in either case, and his personal responsibility for the debts contracted by Radley caused the sequestration of his Oxford fellowship.\n\nIn 1862 his financial difficulties compelled him to leave England for Germany, and he did not return till 1870.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1830746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830746", "title": "Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa", "text": "Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa\n\nSandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa (Ojibwe: Gaa-mitaawangaagamaag-ininiwag) are a historical Ojibwa tribe located in the upper Mississippi River basin, on and around Big Sandy Lake in what today is in Aitkin County, Minnesota. Though politically folded into the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, thus no longer independently federally recognized, for decades, Sandy Lake Band members have been leading efforts to restore their independent Federal recognition.\n\nSince the earliest of days, \"Gaa-mitaawangaagamaag\", as the Sandy Lake is known in \"Anishinaabemowin\" or the Chippewa language, acted as a commercial hub in both east-west trade (via Savanna Portage) and north-south trade (via the Mississippi River). Originally, the area occupied by the Sandy Lake Band was inhabited by the Gros Ventres (Atsina) Tribe. Approximately 1,600 years ago, the Nakota Sioux advancing northward displaced the Gros Ventres westward. With the arrival of the Chippewa approximately 800 years ago, conflicts between the Assiniboine and the Chippewa pursued. By the time the French fur traders made contact in the Sandy Lake region, the Sandy Lake Band had near full control of the area's trade routes. By the time of the arrival of the European settlers around Sandy Lake, the Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa became the instrumental tribe controlling the Savanna Portage trade-route that connected the Lake Superior and east with the Mississippi River and west. Sandy Lake Band became a treaty signatory to the 1787 British Treaty of Peace with the Dakota, Chippewa and Winnebago. Then starting with the 1825 First Treaty of Prairie du Chien, Sandy Lake Band became treaty signatory to it and other successive treaties with the United States.\n\nDue to last-minute changes in the annual annuity payments from a central region around La Pointe, Wisconsin, to not so central but as well known location of Sandy Lake in the fall of 1850, representatives from 19 Chippewa bands packed up and started an arduous journey to the shores of Sandy Lake, where they had been told to gather in late October for annual annuity payments and supplies. As it turned out, the annuity payments and supplies were late in coming to Sandy Lake, and the people had to wait until early December before they received the limited sums of money and available supplies. Trying to survive on spoiled and inadequate government rations while waiting for the annuities, about 150 Chippewa people died from dysentery and measles at Sandy Lake. Another 230-250 died en route home.\n\nAs a result of this tragedy, the Mississippi Chippewa Bands agreed to the establishment of Chippewa Reservations. Sandy Lake Indian Reservation was established in 1855, together with other Mississippi Chippewa Reservations of Lake Pokegama, Rabbit Lake, Gull Lake and Mille Lacs Lake. The same treaty established the Rice Lake Reservation, but due to the Bureau of Land Management claims of the Rice Lake Reservation being within the boundaries of the Sandy Lake Reservation, the Rice Lake Reservation was never formally platted.\n\nThe Sandy Lake Band remained neutral during the Dakota War of 1862 against the United States. Due to this neutrality, the Sandy Lake Band were not forced to relocated to what eventually became the White Earth Reservation in Northwestern Minnesota, though the Band members were socially pressured to relocate and many did. Those who did relocate became the Removable Sandy Lake Band while those who remained became the Non-removable Sandy Lake Band. The Removable Sandy Lake Band members first relocated to Pokegama Lake Indian Reservation near Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Though friction developed between the Pillager Bands of Chippewa and the Mississippi Bands of Chippewa when most of the Mississippi Chippewa reservations were dissolved with all residences relocated to the area surrounding the original Leech Lake Indian Reservation, while all other removable Mississippi Chippewa Bands negotiated relocation to a less hostile area to form the White Earth Indian Reservation, the Pokegama Lake Band and some of the Removable Sandy Lake Band negotiated to remain in the area, forming the White Oak Point Band on the White Oak Point Indian Reservation in 1873, which in 1934 merged with the Leech Lake and other bands of the 5 contiguous Indian Reservations in the area to form the contemporary Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe and the \"Greater\" Leech Lake Indian Reservation.\n\nWhen plans were being negotiated by the United States in 1887 to consolidate all the Ojibwe bands scattered about Minnesota, including the Sandy Lake Band, to the White Earth Indian Reservation, the commission for these plans, after an unsuccessful meeting with the Mille Lacs Indians and on their way to meet with the Fond du Lac Band, stopped to meet with the Sandy Lake Band, but again without success in negotiations, as they learned later the Sandy Lake Band had purposely avoided the meeting. In 1889 with the passage of the Indian Allotment Act to officially relocate all scattered Ojibwe bands in Minnesota to the White Earth Indian Reservation, the Treaty-established Sandy Lake Reservation of approximately 27 mi² (70 km²) was erased from the maps, forcing the Non-removable Sandy Lake Band to be a federally recognized tribe without a reservation. On 4 March 1915, President Woodrow Wilson issued an Executive Order to set aside a tract of land within the Sandy Lake Indian Reservation for the Fond du Lac Band along the banks of the Sandy Lake. In addition, on August 24, 1940, Sandy Lake community managed to secure 147 acres (59.5 ha) parcel of land adjacent to the northeast corner of the original reservation for the benefit of the Sandy Lake Band, and other small tracts of land within the original Sandy Lake Reservation area. However, in 1980, the Bureau of Indian Affairs issued a Solicitor's Opinion that the Executive Order re-established a reservation at Sandy Lake and that the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe is empowered to exercise control over the reservation.\n\nThe Non-removable Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa lost their independent federal recognition under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 when the Bureau of Indian Affairs approved the constitution of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, which grouped all the scattered bands in the Mille Lacs region to form the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, and then placing their lands under the auspices of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, as Mille Lacs Reservation District II. Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs-approved constitution, thence comprised the Non-removable and Removable Mille Lacs Indians of the Mille Lacs Lake Reservation, Non-removable Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa of the Sandy Lake Reservation, Rice Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa, and the Snake River and Kettle River Chippewa Communities of the St. Croix Chippewa Indians. During the early years of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, each of the historical Bands that formed the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe had a representative on the new amalgamated Band's tribal council known as the Reservation Business Committee (RBC). However, after the a significant revision to the RBC structure, allowing for only one elected representative from each RBC district, Sandy Lake Band was faced with losing full representation. In protest, many Sandy Lake Tribal members dis-enrolled from the Mille Lacs Band and formally began the process of regaining independent Federal recognition. Sandy Lake Tribal members continued to reside on the original Sandy Lake Indian Reservation lands and many did not receive any tribal services or housing because the many Sandy Lake tribal members were not enrolled in the Mille Lacs Band.\n\nWhen the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe became a Gaming Compact Tribe in 1988, a large rush of eligible enrollees attempted to enroll with the Mille Lacs Band. Some Sandy Lake Band members who dis-enrolled and never re-enrolled elsewhere were eligible to re-enroll with the Mille Lacs Band. Sandy Lake Band members who dis-enrolled from the Mille Lacs Band and re-enrolled elsewhere were automatically excluded from dis-enrolling from their new tribe to re-enroll with the Mille Lacs Band. Meanwhile, the Sandy Lake Band members who dis-enrolled from the Mille Lacs Band without re-enrolling elsewhere continued to struggle with their effort to re-gain their independent Federal recognition.\n\nEach of the component historical Bands and communities forming the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe still form very distinct tribal entities from each other, each with separate tribal histories—Sandy Lake Band is no exception. Today, the Sandy Lake Band community is primarily located along the north-shore of Sandy Lake while the Mille Lacs Band's Sandy Lake community is primarily located along the south-shore of Sandy Lake near Lake Minnewawa.\n\nFor nearly thirty years, many Sandy Lake Band members continue to lead efforts to restore their independent federal recognition while others fully participate in the Mille Lacs Band tribal government process. Independent federal recognition status is often resisted by the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe members who urge the Sandy Lake Band to first hold regular government sessions with minutes recording their proceedings, such that the Sandy Lake Band may provide documented evidence of regular and consistent government sessions. Sandy Lake Band, in conjunction with their efforts to restore independent federal recognition, have pursued both county and state recognition. The Sandy Lake Band was recognized by Aitkin County, Minnesota in 1992 and affirmed of the recognition in 1996. For the State recognition process, bills have been sent to the Minnesota legislatures in 1997, 1999 and 2000, failing each time by a narrow margin of votes.\n\n\n"}

They are heavy-boned with thick legs and are used for draft work. \n\nTheir history reaches back to Ancient Rome, and throughout the years blood from several other breeds has been added to the Ardennes, although only the Belgian breed had any significant impact. The first Ardennes were imported to the United States in the early 20th century, and the first breed registry was established in Europe in 1929. The horses have been used throughout history as war horses, both as cavalry mounts and to draw artillery, and are used today mainly for heavy draft and farm work, meat production and competitive driving events. They have also been used to influence or create several other horse breeds throughout Europe and Asia.\n\nTheir history reaches back to Ancient Rome. The Ardennes breed could be a direct descendant of the prehistoric Solutré horse, and is claimed to be descended from the type of horse described by Julius Caesar in his \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\". Caesar described these horses of Belgium as \"rustic, hard and tireless\", and recommended them for use in heavy cavalry units. The early type was used by many later Roman emperors for military applications. The breed's ancestors are thought to have been bred for 2,000 years on the Ardennes plains, and it is one of the oldest documented European heavy draft breeds. In the Roman era, the breed stood only around high. Later, Napoleon added Arabian blood to increase stamina and endurance and used the breed in his Russian campaign. In 1780, the breed still stood only and weighed around .\n\nPercheron, Boulonnais and Thoroughbred blood were also added, although they had little impact. In the 19th century, Belgian draft blood was added to give the breed the heavier conformation it has today. The extra weight and size was desired to turn the breed into a very heavy draft breed, after their role as an artillery horse had diminished through the advent of mechanization, as well as a desire for a meat animal. The breed increased in size from an average of to their current weight, which at the same time had the consequence of reducing their vigor and endurance. The first breed registry was established in Europe in 1929. Today there are 3 separate studbooks in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, although there is extensive interbreeding between all three. The Ardennes Horse Society of Great Britain was also formed in the late 20th century to preserve and promote Ardennes horses in Great Britain, but today is not recognized as a studbook or passport issuing organization by the British government and may not exist in any form.\n\nThe first Ardennes were imported to the United States in the early 20th century, but it is still not known precisely when. Originally, when imported to the United States, Ardennes horses were eligible for registration with the now-defunct National French Draft Horse Association of America or French Draft Horse Society. This organization published a stud book and registered six individual French draft breeds as belonging to a single breed, combining the information so that no totals of individual breeds are known. Many of these horses were imported to the United States with their breed being considered simply \"French draft\" and no individual type being specified. Some Ardennes horses imported to the United States before 1917 were called Belgians when they were imported and subsequently registered as Belgians. Ardennes horses have continued to be imported into the United States from Belgium, with imports occurring as late as 2004.\n\nIn France, Ardennes stallions stand about high, and mares about , while in Belgium these are the maximum allowable heights. They weigh . Their heads are heavy, with a broad face and a straight or slightly convex profile. Their conformation is broad and muscular, with a compact body, short back, and short, sturdy legs with strong joints. Their fetlocks are feathered. Their coats may be bay, roan, chestnut, gray, or palomino. Bay and roan are the two most common colors. Black is very rare and is excluded from registration. White markings are small, usually restricted to a star or blaze. The breed matures early, and they are said to be easy keepers, economical to feed despite their size. The Ardennes is a free-moving, long-striding breed, despite their compact body structure.\n\nHorses from the Ardennes region were used as war horses in the Crusades in the 11th century by knights led by Godfrey of Bouillon. They were used during the 17th century by Marshal Turenne as remounts for his cavalry. In the French Revolution, they were considered to be the best artillery horse available, due to their temperament, stamina and strength. Napoleon used large numbers of Ardennes horses to pull artillery and transport supplies during his 1812 Russian campaign. They were said to be the only breed used by Napoleon that was hardy enough to withstand the winter retreat from Moscow, which they did while pulling a large amount of the army's wagon train. They were also used to pull artillery in World War I, when they were depended upon by the French and Belgian armies. Their calm, tolerant disposition, combined with their active and flexible nature, made them an ideal artillery horse. The breed was considered so useful and valuable that when the Germans established the Commission for the Purchase of Horses in October 1914 to capture Belgian horses, the Ardennes was one of two breeds specified as important, the other being the Brabant.\n\nToday, the breed is used mainly for meat, due to its extensive musculature. Horse meat is a dietary staple in many European countries, including France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. However, they are increasingly used for farm, forest and leisure work. Their nimble action, stamina and good temper make them increasingly used for competitive driving across Europe, and they have also been used as mounts for therapeutic horseback riding. The breed is known for its ability to work in rough, hilly terrain.\n\nArdennes horses have been used as foundation bloodstock to develop several other draft horse breeds and subgroups. These include the Baltic Ardennes and Russian Heavy Draft. The Swedish Ardennes is well established in that country, where it is in demand for use in forestry. It was first recognized as a separate sub-group in the 19th century, but today is considered a separate breed, even though its ancestry is entirely from the Ardennes horses of Belgium and France. Another closely related breed is the Auxois. Ardennes horses were also used in the 1920s to improve the Comtois by adding size. Along with the Breton and the Anglo-Norman, the Ardennes horse was used to create the Sokolsky horse. Similarly, the Trait Du Nord was created through a mixture of Ardennes and Belgian blood.\n"}

In the summer of 2009 the old AstroPlay surface was replaced with FieldTurf.\n\nA new scoreboard with two video strips was mounted at the top of the stadium's north bowl for the 2005 season, correcting a quirk of the stadium that north-driving teams had no way to see the clock without turning around. In 2006, the playing field was named Kivisto Field in honor of prominent donor Tom Kivisto.\n\nThe University of Kansas broke ground on the new $31-million Anderson Family Football Complex on October 6, 2006, and it opened in 2008. The building includes offices, academic areas, a weight room, locker rooms, an audio-visual room, meeting rooms, a cardio room, a hydro-therapy room, a nutrition area and a display area. It is also joined by new practice fields to the southeast of the stadium.\n\nOn September 17, 2009, the Kansas Board of Regents approved a $34 million addition of luxury seating on the east side of the stadium. The addition, known as the Gridiron Club, will increase the stadium's capacity by 3,000 seats. However, as of 2015, construction has yet to begin.\n\nIn the summer of 2014 the track around the football field was removed and artificial turf was laid in its place.\n\nThe stadium was renovated in August 2017 with new seats, a new touchdown club behind the north end zone, and the outside walls with banners. The rim of the northern bowl also had a series of 5 flagpoles installed on both sides of the scoreboard, with one side set to feature American flags, and one side set to feature the state flag of Kansas. \n\nThe stadium's current official capacity is 50,071. A then-record crowd of 51,574 saw the Jayhawks defeat Kansas State 25–18 in 1973.\n\nAt the Jayhawks' November 5, 2005 streak-snapping 40–15 victory over Nebraska, it was announced that that attendance record was broken, with a standing-room-only crowd of 51,750.\n\nOn November 18, 2006 a then attendance record of 51,821 fans watched the Jayhawks defeat Kansas State, 39–20. The home attendance average of 44,137 in seven games during the year set a new season record, surpassing the prior season's record of 43,675 in six contests. Over the last three seasons, stadium attendance has averaged more than 41,000 per game.\n\nOn November 1, 2008, the Jayhawks set a new record of 52,230 fans in attendance. The Jayhawks beat Kansas State 52–21 in the Sunflower Showdown.\n\nOn September 5, 2009 Kansas broke the record again as 52,530 fans watched the Jayhawks defeat Northern Colorado in the opening game of the Jayhawks' 2009 season.\n\n\nMemorial Stadium also hosted the Kansas Relays track and field event every year from 1923 through 2013, except in 1943, 1944 and 1945 due to World War II and 1998 and 1999 due to construction. The Relays annually see top area high school and intercollegiate competitors, and the open events often draw Olympic runners such as Maurice Greene and Marion Jones. The Kansas Relays is the location where world-record holder Justin Gatlin tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs in 2006. Gatlin served a four-year suspension, but has since returned to track prominence.\n\nIn 2014, the Kansas Relays left Memorial Stadium and moved to Rock Chalk Park, a new multi-sport complex located northwest of the KU campus. The new track facility seats 7,000 and features a nine-lane, IAAF certified track.\n\nThe stadium has also hosted numerous Kansas State High School Activities Association state championship games and Kansas Shrine Bowl all-star games, and was used by Lawrence High School before it constructed a stadium on its campus.\n\n\nThe following are the top 10 largest crowds in stadium history:\n\n\n"}

Young George was a keen golfer and member of the Bruntsfield Links Golfing Society - which met at the Golf Tavern and played on the adjacent Bruntsfield Links. It was through spending time at the Golf Tavern that George became friends with many of Edinburgh's leading brewers; including Thomas Aitchison, George Bernard and Robert Clark.\n\nIn 1868, George Lorimer came of age and inherited his father's estate. George was determined to use the money to start his own brewery. He enlisted the help of Robert Clark, then Head Brewer at the Alexander Melvin Brewery in Edinburgh and together they opened Lorimer and Clark's Caledonian Brewery on the Slateford Road site. In 1892, to designs by the architect Robert Hamilton Paterson, buildings on the site were re-constructed and new brewery and maltings buildings erected.\n\nAlthough the brewery sold its beers and a number of stouts all over Scotland, its most popular beer was Lorimer's Best Scotch, which was sold predominantly in the north-east of England.\n\nOn George Lorimer’s death in 1939, The Caledonian Brewery passed into the hands of Sunderland-based Vaux Breweries, who developed Lorimer’s Best Scotch brand into one of the most popular beers in the North East of England. In 1986 they decided to cease brewing in Edinburgh and transfer the operation to their base in Sunderland.\n\nEventually neglect and lack of investment took their toll and placed the brewery under threat of closure. In 1987, the brewery was saved through a management buy-out led by Head Brewer Russell Sharp.\n\nIn 2004, the brewery site and production facilities were bought by Scottish & Newcastle (S&N), following their closure of the McEwan's Brewery in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh. Production of McEwan's ales has been transferred to the Caledonian Brewery.\n\nAt the same time, a new Caledonian Brewing Company (CBC) was formed by several former shareholders and directors of the pre-2004 business. CBC owns the Caledonian brands and operates the brewery site on behalf of the owners. Whilst S&N has taken a 30% share in this business, CBC operates on an independent basis.\n\nIn January 2006, the Caledonian Brewing Company purchased the Harviestoun Brewery based in Alva, makers of Bitter and Twisted.\n\nIn 2008, S&N bought the remaining shares in CBC to take full control of the company. The brands remain unaffected and brewing will continue at the site. Harviestoun was not part of the takeover and was retained by Caledonian's shareholders to run as a separate concern. With the takeover of S&N, Heineken now control the Caledonian Brewery Company.\n\nCaledonian's most well known beers are Deuchars IPA and 80/- (Now rebadged as Edinburgh Castle). They also brew Flying Scotsman, four seasonal beers and several monthly guest ales.\n\n"}

It is highly toxic and reacts slowly with water. Its main use is as a ligand in metal complexes. As a ligand, it parallels carbon monoxide in metal carbonyls, and indeed its toxicity is due to its binding with the iron in blood hemoglobin in a similar way to carbon monoxide.\n\nPhosphorus trifluoride has an F−P−F bond angle of approximately 96.3°. Gaseous PF has a standard enthalpy of formation of −945 kJ/mol (−226 kcal/mol). The phosphorus atom has a nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift of 97 ppm (downfield of HPO).\n\nPhosphorus trifluoride hydrolyzes especially at high pH, but it is less hydrolytically sensitive than phosphorus trichloride. It does not attack glass except at high temperatures, and anhydrous potassium hydroxide may be used to dry it with little loss. With hot metals, phosphides and fluorides are formed. With Lewis bases such as ammonia addition products (adducts) are formed, and PF is oxidized by oxidizing agents such as bromine or potassium permanganate.\n\nAs a ligand for transition metals, PF is a strong π-acceptor.\nIt forms a variety of metal complexes with metals in low oxidation states. PF forms several complexes for which the corresponding CO derivatives (see metal carbonyl) are unstable or nonexistent. Thus, Pd(PF) is known, but Pd(CO) is not. Such complexes are usually prepared directly from the related metal carbonyl compound, with loss of CO. However, Nickel metal reacts directly with PF at 100 °C under 35 MPa pressure to form Ni(PF), which is analogous to Ni(CO). Cr(PF), the analogue of Cr(CO), may be prepared from dibenzenechromium:\n\nPhosphorus trifluoride is usually prepared from phosphorus trichloride via halogen exchange using various fluorides such as hydrogen fluoride, calcium fluoride, arsenic trifluoride, antimony trifluoride, or zinc fluoride:\n\nPhosphorus trifluoride is similar to carbon monoxide in that it is a gas which strongly binds to iron in hemoglobin, preventing the blood from absorbing oxygen.\n\nPF is highly toxic, comparable to phosgene.\n\n\n"}

The Motorola 68881 was introduced in 1984. The addition of one of these devices added substantial cost to a computer, but added a floating-point unit that could rapidly perform floating point mathematical calculations. In the mid 1980s, this feature was useful mostly for scientific and mathematical software.\n\nThe 68020 and 68030 CPUs were designed with the separate 68881 chip in mind. Their instruction sets reserved the \"F-line\" instructions – that is, all opcodes beginning with the hexadecimal digit \"F\" could either be forwarded to an external coprocessor or be used as \"traps\" which would throw an exception, handing control to the computer's operating system. If an FPU is not present in the system, the OS would then either call an FPU emulator to execute the instruction's equivalent using 68020 integer-based software code, return an error to the program, terminate the program, or crash and require a reboot.\n\nThe 68881 has eight 80-bit data registers (a 64-bit mantissa plus a sign bit, and a 15-bit signed exponent). It allows seven different modes of numeric representation, including single-precision, double-precision, and extended-precision, as defined by the IEEE floating-point standard, IEEE 754. It was designed specifically for floating-point math and is not a general-purpose CPU. For example, when an instruction requires any address calculations, the main CPU handles them before the 68881 takes control.\n\nThe CPU/FPU pair are designed such that both can run at the same time. When the CPU encounters a 68881 instruction, it hands the FPU all operands needed for that instruction, and then the FPU releases the CPU to go on and execute the next instruction.\n\nThe 68882 is an improved version of the 68881, with better pipelining, and eventually available at higher clock speeds. Its instruction set is exactly the same. Motorola claimed in some marketing literature that it executes some instructions 40% faster than a 68881 at the same clock speed, though this did not reflect typical performance, as seen by its more modest improvement in the table below. The 68882 is pin compatible with the 68881 and can be used as a direct replacement in most systems. The most important software incompatibility is that the 68882 uses a larger FSAVE state frame, which affects UNIX and other preemptive multitasking OSes that had to be modified to allocate more space for it.\n\nThe 68881 or 68882 were used in the Sun Microsystems Sun-3 workstations, IBM RT PC workstations, Apple Computer Macintosh II family, NeXT Computer, Sharp X68000, Amiga 3000, and Atari Mega STE, TT, and Falcon030. Some third-party Amiga and Atari products used the 68881 or 68882 as a memory-mapped peripheral to the 68000.\n\n\n\nThese statistics came from the comp.sys.m68k FAQ. No statistics are listed for the 16 MHz and 20 MHz 68882, though these chips were indeed produced.\n\nStarting with the Motorola 68040, floating point support was included in the CPU itself.\n\n"}

{"id": "1830828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830828", "title": "Treasure Valley", "text": "Treasure Valley\n\nThe Treasure Valley is a valley in the western United States, primarily in southwestern Idaho, where the Payette, Boise, Weiser, Malheur, Owyhee, and Burnt rivers drain into the Snake River. It includes all the lowland areas from Vale in rural eastern Oregon to Boise, and is the most populated area in Idaho.\n\nHistorically, the valley had been known as the Lower Snake River Valley or the Boise River Valley. Pete Olesen, president of the valley's association of local Chambers of Commerce, coined the name \"Treasure Valley\" in 1959 to reflect the treasure chest of resources and opportunities that the region offered.\n\nThe tribes that roamed the area, specifically, were the Northern Paiute and Shoshone. In 1834, Thomas McKay built the original Fort Boise, in the area near present-day Parma, which was run for a time by Francois Payette. It later was moved because of flooding troubles and was abandoned in 1854. The Oregon Trail runs through the Treasure Valley.\n\nThe valley was settled for the most part by ranchers and farmers, initially to supply the gold and silver mining communities in the higher elevations nearby: Idaho City in the Boise Basin and Silver City in the Owyhees. A new Fort Boise was constructed by the U.S. Army in 1863 in present-day Boise, from which the city grew. In 1883, the Oregon Short Line Railroad reached the Treasure Valley, creating a thriving community, with Nampa as the center of the area's rail activity.\n\nMany Basques, primarily from northern Spain, came to the area looking for gold but, meeting discrimination, it seemed to many that a better occupation was shepherding, familiar from their homeland. Over 50,000 Basques came to the Treasure Valley, making it the largest community of Basques outside of Europe.\n\nAs Boise began to grow, so did the riches of large planters such as Thomas and Frank Davis. They moved to Idaho in 1862 for mining and homesteaded right below the Boise Bench on the Boise River. Tom Davis became very successful at growing fruit, as he made over $10,000 on one year's apple crop. He later purchased more land for orchards and horses. In 1907, he donated much of this land as Julia Davis Park in honor of his wife.\n\nThe Owyhee Project was one of the most influential developments of the area. It essentially began in 1903, when surveyors began investigating a site on the Owyhee River for the construction of a dam, to impound water for irrigation. The Owyhee project received official Congressional sanction in 1924 on December 5 and the Owyhee Dam was completed on September 16, 1932. While the dam was under construction, over of irrigation canals were being dug to the north and south. The main purpose of the Owyhee Project was irrigation. By 1965, over were being irrigated for a value of more than $23 million.\n\nIn 1941, J. R. Simplot built a dehydrator and began processing large quantities of dehydrated potatoes and onions at a plant near Caldwell. His business thrived, selling potatoes to the government and fertilizer to local farmers.\n\nIn 1973, Hewlett Packard purchased a site for a future peripherals plant in Boise. Micron Technology was founded in 1978, creating an additional, local industry aside from farming and potato packaging.\n\n\n"}

The Costa da Morte extends from the villages of Muros and Malpica.\n\nThe Costa da Morte received its name because there have been so many shipwrecks along its treacherous rocky shore. The shore of the Costa da Morte is exposed directly to the Atlantic Ocean. It is an area that has suffered a number of oil spills, including the spill from the Prestige in 2002.\n\nThe exterior cape region is known for anthropological, historical and geographical reasons. Its name in the Galician language is Fisterra, which descends from the Roman legend which held that this area was the end of the world (\"Finis-terrae\"). The area was largely Christianized by the Catholic Church with the aid of a large flux of Christian pilgrims arriving on the Way of St. James.\n\nThe people of the area still preserve pre-Christian ritual places and pass on some of the traditional beliefs. For example, there are giant \"pedras de abalar\" (i.e. \"oscillating stones\", the common term in English is rocking stone) throughout the region. These pedras de abalar were sacred locations and used in various rituals that are remembered in local culture. There is also a local legend that the wind creates wild nightmares.\n\n\nThe Costa da Morte includes Cape Finisterre (Spanish: Cabo Finisterre; Galician: Cabo Fisterra), a rock-bound peninsula in the uttermost west of Galicia, Spain.\n\nCape Finisterre is not the westernmost point of Spain, contrary to popular belief. This title belongs to Cape Touriñán, which is found just north of Finisterre. Finisterre's name, like that of Finistère in France, derives from the Latin \"Finisterrae\" which literally means \"Land's End\".\n\nCape Finisterre has a notable lighthouse on it, and the seaside town of Fisterra is located nearby.\n\nFurther north are the Rías Altas\n\nThese are some of the towns, villages, hamlets and cities along the \"Costa da Morte\":\n\n\n"}

This name was his religious name, given by his meditation instructor in 1905, and Manhae (만해) was his pen name; his birth name was Han Yu-cheon.\n\nManhae was born in Yucheon in Chungcheongnam-do, Hongseong. During his childhood, he studied Chinese classics in Seodang, a popular elementary school during the Joseon Dynasty. Prior to being ordained, he was involved in resistance to Japanese influence in the country, which culminated in the Japanese occupation from 1905 to 1945. He lived in seclusion at Ose-am in the Baekdam Temple from 1896. During this period, he studied Buddhist sacred texts and several books of modern philosophy. In 1905 he received the robes of the Jogye Order of monks and in 1908 he went to Japan and visited several temples to study Buddhism and Eastern philosophy for six months. In 1919 he was one of the patriot signatories to the Korean Declaration of Independence.\n\nAs a social writer, Manhae called for the reform of Korean Buddhism.\n\nManhae's poetry dealt with both nationalism and sexual love, often mingling the two. One of his more political collections was \"Nimui Chimmuk\" (Lover's Silence, 님의 침묵), published in 1926. These works revolve around the ideas of equality and freedom and helped inspire the tendencies toward passive resistance and non-violence in the Korean independence movement.\n\nIn 1913, Han Yongun published \"The Restoration of Korean Buddhism (\"Joseonbulgyo-yusimlon\"), which criticized the anachronistic isolationist policy of Joseon Buddhism and its incongruence with the then contemporary reality. The work sent tremors through the intellectual world. In this work, the author promulgated the principle of equality, self-discovery, the potential for Buddhism for safeguarding the world, and progress. His development as an activist and thinker resulted from his adherence to these very principles.\n\nIn 1918, Han published \"Whole Mind\" (\"Yusim\"), a work that aimed to enlighten young people. In the following year, he played an important role in the 3.1 Independence movement with Chae Lin, for which he was later imprisoned and served a three-year sentence. During his imprisonment, Han composed \"Reasons for Korean Independence\" (\"Joseondoglib-i-yuseo\") as a response to the official investigation into his political engagement. He was later acquitted in 1922, at which time he began a nationwide lecture tour. The purpose of the tour was to engage and inspire youth, an objective first established in Han's \"Whole Mind\". In 1924, he became the Chair of the Buddhist youth assembly.\n\nThe poems published in Han's \"Nim-ui Chimmuk\" had been written at Baekdam Temple in the previous year. This book garnered much attention from literary critics and intellectuals at the time. Despite his many other publications, from Chinese poems to sijos and the poems included in \"Yusim\", and novels such as Dark Wind (\"Heukpung\"), Regret (\"Huhoe\"), Misfortune (\"Bakmyeong\"), this collection remains the poet's most significant and enduring literary achievement. In it, love for the motherland plainly appears under the guise of longing for the loved one, as in the poem \"I Do Not Know\".\n\nHan's model for such rhapsodic, long-lined expressions of devotion was Rabindranath Tagore, whose work he knew, and behind Tagore the long Indian tradition of combining mysticism with eroticism. In 2007, he was listed by the Korean Poets' Association among the ten most important modern Korean poets.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1830848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830848", "title": "Edward Bawden", "text": "Edward Bawden\n\nEdward Bawden, (1903–1989) was an English painter, illustrator and graphic artist, known for his prints, book covers, posters, and garden metalwork furniture. Bawden taught at the Royal College of Art, where he had been a student, worked as a commercial artist and served as a war artist in World War Two. He was a fine watercolour painter but worked in many different media. He illustrated several books and painted murals in both the 1930s and 1960s. He was admired by Edward Gorey, David Gentleman and other graphic artists, and his work and career is often associated with that of his contemporary Eric Ravilious.\n\nEdward Bawden was born on 10 March 1903 at Braintree, Essex, the only child of Edward Bawden, an ironmonger, and Eleanor Bawden (\"née\" Game). His parents were Methodist Christians. A solitary child, he spent much time drawing or wandering with butterfly-net and microscope. At the age of seven he was enrolled at Braintree High School, and began studying or copying drawings of cats by Louis Wain, illustrations in boys' and girls' magazines, and Burne Jones's illustrations of Malory's \"Morte d'Arthur\". Later his parents paid for him to attend the Friends' School at Saffron Walden, and there, when he was fifteen, the headmaster recommended him to study for one day a week at Cambridge School of Art.\n\nUpon leaving school in 1919, he attended Cambridge School of Art full-time from 1919 to 1921. There he became interested in calligraphy and in the work of Aubrey Beardsley, Richard Doyle, William Morris and other Victorians. This was followed in 1922 by a scholarship to the Royal College of Art School of Design in London, where he took a diploma in illustration until 1925. Here he met his fellow student and future collaborator Eric Ravilious; the pair were described by their teacher Paul Nash as \"an extraordinary outbreak of talent\".\n\nIt was during this period that Bawden produced the tiles for the London Underground that were exhibited at the International Building Trades Exhibition at Olympia in April 1928.\n\nIn 1928, Bawden was commissioned by Sir Joseph Duveen, at the rate of £1 per day, to create a mural for the Refectory at Morley College, London along with Ravilious and Charles Mahoney. The mural was unveiled in 1930 by former Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, who was at the time Leader of the Opposition.\n\nBy 1930, Bawden was working one day a week for the Curwen Press, as was Ravilious and their former tutor, Nash, producing illustrations for leading companies at the time such as London Transport, Westminster Bank, Twinings, Poole Potteries, Shell-Mex, the Folio Society, Chatto & Windus, and Penguin Books. In the early 1930s he was discovered by the Stuart Advertising Agency, owned by H. Stuart Menzies and Marcus Brumwell. Around this time Bawden produced some of his most humorous and innovative work for Fortnum & Mason and Imperial Airways. He also worked for \"The Listener\".\n\nIn 1932, Bawden married Charlotte Epton, who had been a fellow-student at the Royal College. They had two children, Joanna and Richard, both of whom would become artists. At first the couple lived in a flat in Hammersmith, but soon moved to a Georgian house in Great Bardfield, Essex, only a few miles from Braintree, where Bawden had been born. Following his move to the country he began to paint more, in addition to his commercial design work, developing his watercolour technique. Most of his subjects were of scenes around Great Bardfield. He held an exhibition of his Essex watercolours at the Zwemmer Gallery in 1934, and another show of his paintings was held at the Leicester Galleries in 1938.\n\nIn 1938, Bawden collaborated with John Aldridge, who also lived in the village, on a range of wallpapers that they intended to be printed commercially, but from lino blocks handcut by the designers. The project left little other time for other work during the year, and war intervened before the papers could go into production.\n\nOne of Bawden's most familiar designs from this era was the 'Puzzled Lion and Startled Unicorn' \"Observer\" masthead, which was created around 1939 and remained in use by the national newspaper until 1989.\n\nDuring the Second World War Bawden served as an official war artist, first with the British army in France and then, following the army's evacuation from there, in the Middle East. Already in France before World War II was declared, he recorded defences being prepared at Halluin, then witnessed the bombing of Armentières and the evacuation from Dunkirk. He was posted to North Africa as a War Office Artist on a full-time War Artists' Advisory Committee contract. Bawden painted landscapes and portraits in Libya, Sudan, Cairo, Eritrea and Ethiopia, reaching Addis Ababa in May 1941. At the start of 1942 he travelled with Anthony Gross to Palestine and Lebanon.\n\nAfter making a series of studies of the Marsh Arabs in southern Iraq, Bawden was recalled to London. Bawden departed Cairo aboard the SS \"Stratheden\" but transferred to the RMS \"Laconia\" in Durban on 27 August 1942. After the Laconia was torpedoed and sunk, on 12 September 1942, he spent five days in an open lifeboat before being rescued by a French ship, the \"Gloire\". He was held prisoner in a Vichy internment camp in Casablanca for two months before the camp was liberated by American troops. From Casablanca he sailed to Norfolk, Virginia. When he eventually returned to Britain, Bawden did portrait work at the Military Hospital in Colchester and in Scotland, with Polish forces training there. He returned to Iraq in September 1943, as a Ministry of Information artist to work in Baghdad and Kurdistan, before he joined the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit on its trek to Jeddah. From Jeddah, he returned to the Marsh Arabs in southern Iraq, before entering Iran to portray supply shipments to the Soviet Union.\n\nBawden returned to England in 1944 and for a short while, painted at Southampton docks before departing for Yugoslavia, by way of Rome. Unable to enter Yugoslavia he went to Ravenna, then Greece, Austria and Florence before travelling back to England in July 1945.\n\nBawden lived in Great Bardfield, Essex from the 1930s to 1970. While living at Bardfield he was an important member of the Great Bardfield Artists. This group of local artists were diverse in style but shared a love for figurative art, making the group distinct from the better known St Ives art community in Cornwall, who, after the war, were chiefly dominated by abstractionists.\n\nIn 1949, Bawden provided illustrations for the book \"London is London – A Selection of Prose and Verse by D. M. Low\". Bawden completed a series of eleven murals for the First Class lounge of the P&O liner \"Oronsay\", which was launched in 1951. The theme was the English pub and Bawden depicted traditional pub names, such as the Rose & Crown, in purely visual form in his design. For the Festival of Britain in 1951 he created a mural, \"English Country Life\", that was displayed in the entrance of The Lion and the Unicorn Pavilion.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Great Bardfield Artists organised a series of large 'open house' exhibitions which attracted national press attention. Positive reviews and the novelty of viewing art works in the artists' own homes (including Bawden's Brick House) led to thousands visiting the remote village during the summer exhibitions of 1954, 1955, and 1958. As well as these shows, the Great Bardfield Artists held several touring exhibitions of their work in 1957, 1958, and 1959.\n\nAfter the death of his wife in 1970, Bawden moved to the nearby town of Saffron Walden, where he continued to work until his death at home on 21 November 1989.\n\nBawden bequeathed about 3,000 of his works to The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum, Bedford.\n\nHis work can be seen in many major collections and is shown regularly at the Fry Art Gallery, Saffron Walden and at the Higgins. His notable surviving public works include a tile depicting a foot ferry on the River Lea, commissioned by London Underground and located on the Victoria line platform at Tottenham Hale station. Bawden also produced the cameo-like silhouette of Queen Victoria located at Victoria underground station. An early map, produced in 1931 for Scarborough's Pavilion Hotel and presented to Scarborough Library when the hotel was sold, was recently restored and rehung in the library.\n\nThe original Morley College mural that Bawden created in the 1930s was destroyed during a wartime bombing raid; however the rebuilt and relocated college on the South Bank contains a fine surviving mural by him. In 1965 Bawden completed a mural for Queen's University, Belfast.\nHaving briefly taught design and book illustration at Goldsmiths, University of London from 1928 to 1931, Bawden then went on to teach at the Royal College of Art between 1930 and 1963 (except for the years of the Second World War). In 1968, he became a tutor at the Royal Academy Schools. In 1969 Edward became a Senior Part-Time Lecturer in Graphics at the City of Leicester Polytechnic.\n\nAmong his numerous appointments and awards that came later in his career are:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1830863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830863", "title": "4B5B", "text": "4B5B\n\nIn telecommunication, 4B5B is a form of data communications line code. 4B5B maps groups of 4 bits of data onto groups of 5 bits for transmission. These 5 bit words are pre-determined in a dictionary and they are chosen to ensure that there will be sufficient transitions in the line state to produce a self-clocking signal. A collateral effect of the code is that 25% more bits are needed to send the same information. \n\nAn alternative to using 4B5B coding is to use a scrambler. Some systems use scramblers in conjunction with 4B5B coding to assure DC balance and improve electromagnetic compatibility.\n\nDepending on the standard or specification of interest, there may be several 5-bit output codes left unused. The presence of any of the unused codes in the data stream can be used as an indication that there is a fault somewhere in the link. Therefore, the unused codes can be used to detect errors in the data stream. \n\n4B5B was popularized by fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) in the mid-1980s. It was adopted for digital audio transmission by MADI in 1989. and by Fast Ethernet in 1995.\n\nThe name \"4B5B\" is generally taken to mean the FDDI version. Other 4-to-5-bit codes have been used for magnetic recording and are known as group coded recording (GCR), but those are (0,2) run-length limited codes, with at most two consecutive zeros. 4B5B allows up to three consecutive zeros (a (0,3) RLL code), providing a greater variety of control codes.\n\nOn optical fiber, the 4B5B output is NRZI-encoded. FDDI over copper (CDDI) uses MLT-3 encoding instead, as does 100BASE-TX.\n\nThe 4B5B encoding is also used for USB Power Delivery communication, where it is sent over the USB-C CC pin (further encoded using biphase mark code) or the USB-A/B power lines (further encoded using frequency-shift keying).\n\n4B5B codes are designed to produce at least two transitions per 5 bits of output code regardless of input data. When NRZI-encoded, the transitions provide necessary clock transitions for the receiver. For example, a run of 4 bits such as 0000 contains no transitions and that causes clocking problems for the receiver. 4B5B solves this problem by assigning the 4-bit block a 5-bit code, in this case 11110. \n\nThree consecutive zero bits only appear in normal data when a code ending with two 0 bits (2, E) is followed by a code beginning with a 0 bit (1, 4, 5, 6), so will always appear separated by multiples of the 5-bit encoded symbol length (and never separated by a single symbol). Violations of this property are used for special synchronization codes.\n\nThe following codes are sometimes referred to as command characters. They are commonly used in pairs, although USB-PD uses 4-symbol sequences to begin its packets.\n\n"}

They do not necessarily hold public office themselves; most historical bosses did not, at least during the times of their greatest influence. Numerous officeholders in that unit are subordinate to the single boss in party affairs. Each party in the same ward or city may have its own boss; that is, the Republican boss of Ward 7 controls Republican politics, while the Democratic boss controls the Democratic party there. Bosses may base their power on the support of numerous voters, usually organized voting blocs, and manage a coalition of these blocs and various other stakeholders. When the party wins, they typically control appointments in their unit, and have a voice at the higher levels. Reformers typically allege that political bosses are corrupt. This corruption is usually tied to patronage; the exchange of jobs, lucrative contracts and other political favors for votes, campaign contributions and sometimes outright bribes. \n\nThe appearance of bosses has been common since the Roman Republic, and remains fairly common or maybe widespread today. In Spanish America, Brazil, Spain, and Portugal political bosses called \"caciques\" hold power in many places; while in Italy they are often referred to as \"ras\". Bosses were a major part of the political landscape during the 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States, such as the political machine of Tammany Hall, which controlled financing of campaigns and influence via owing of favors to arrange patronage public appointments.\n\nIn the South, charismatic populist politicians like Huey Long commanded large networks of supporters. Similar practices existed in the northern cities, particularly New York City, where Boss Tweed (arguably the most infamous political boss) wielded control over the powerful Democratic political machine. In Denver, Colorado during the 1890s there was Jefferson Randolph \"Soapy\" Smith who operated as the Republican party boss and political fixer.\n\nCharles Brayton exercised great influence over the politics of turn of the 20th century Rhode Island. He exemplified rural bossism within the Republican Party. Chicago had numerous colorful bosses, such as Democrats Hinky Dink and Bathhouse John. The Republican counterparts included Big Bill Thompson, who became mayor in the 1920s. Of course the iconic figure was longtime mayor and chairman of the Cook County Democratic Committee Richard J. Daley. Daley had a major voice in state and national Democratic politics. With a few exceptions in the Southwest, such as Phoenix, most large cities of 100,000 or more in the early 20th century had machine organizations, and usually claimed one or more local bosses. Most were Democrats. Some had a major impact on state politics, such as E. H. Crump in Memphis, Tennessee. A few bosses had reputations as reformers, such as Frank Hague of Jersey City.\n\nThe HBO television series \"Boardwalk Empire\" focuses on Enoch \"Nucky\" Thompson (based on the historical Enoch L. Johnson), a Republican Party boss and gangster who controls Atlantic City, New Jersey during the Prohibition period of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nBoss Tweed was played by Philip Bosco in the 1986 TV movie \"Liberty\", and by Jim Broadbent as a major supporting character in the 2002 film \"Gangs of New York\". Tweed is portrayed as a defender of the rights of minorities and helper of those in need in Pete Hamill's 2003 novel \"Forever\".\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1830910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830910", "title": "Chanin Building", "text": "Chanin Building\n\nThe Chanin Building, also known as 122 East 42nd Street, is a 56-story office skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan in New York City. It is located on the southwest corner of 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue, near Grand Central Terminal to the north and adjacent to 110 East 42nd Street to the west. The building is named for Irwin S. Chanin, its developer.\n\nThe structure was designed by Sloan & Robertson in the Art Deco style, with the assistance of Chanin's own architect Jacques Delamarre. It incorporates architectural sculpture by Rene Paul Chambellan, as well as a facade of brick and terracotta. The skyscraper reaches , with a roof topped by a spire. The Chanin Building includes numerous setbacks to conform with the 1916 Zoning Resolution.\n\nThe Chanin Building was constructed in 1927–1929, and was almost fully rented upon opening. Over the years, the upper floors have contained a movie theater, observation deck, and radio broadcast station, while the lower floors were used as offices and a bus terminal. The building was designated a New York City landmark in 1978, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\n\nThe Chanin Building was designed by Sloan & Robertson in the Art Deco style. Though the exterior contains a relatively muted design, the interior contains ample ornament. The building's design took several elements from Eliel Saarinen's Tribune Tower design. The Chanin Building is tall to its roof, or tall when including its spire.\n\nThe building is located at 122 East 42nd Street and is bounded by Lexington Avenue to the east, 42nd Street to the north, and 41st Street to the south. The lot measures along 42nd Street, along 41st Street, and along Lexington Avenue. It is part of the Terminal City area of Grand Central Terminal, and abuts 110 East 42nd Street directly to its west. The Grand Hyatt New York hotel is located across 42nd Street, while the Socony–Mobil Building is located across Lexington Avenue.\n\nThe Chanin Building employs a series of setbacks that end in a \"vigorous, toothed\" pinnacle. Because of the varying widths of the surrounding streets, three separate groups of setbacks were mandated for each side per the 1916 Zoning Resolution, with the result that the Chanin Building was \"design[ed] in masses rather than in facades\". The lowest four stories occupy the entire building lot, while there is a recession in the middle of the eastern facade from the fifth through 17th stories. The subsequent stories form a jagged \"pyramid\", with setbacks above the 17th, 30th, and 52nd stories.\n\nThe Chanin Building is clad with brick, limestone, and terracotta, as well as bronze, marble, and colored glass ornament that was custom-designed. The base of the building bears black Belgian marble around the store front windows, which are each made of plate glass. Directly above, a bronze frieze depicts scenes of evolution, ranging from simple organisms to more complex animals and plants. A second terracotta frieze runs the whole length of the lower facade, presenting a dramatic collection of angular zigzags and curvy leaves. A bas-relief by Edward Trumbull, designed in the Art Deco style, wraps around the facade.\n\nThe facade continues upward in relatively simple tones. The second and third floors include bronze-framed groups of triple-paned windows, with bronze Art Deco spandrel panels between the floors. Each grouping is separated by vertical piers made of limestone, topped by elaborate capitals. The fourth story is faced with ornate terracotta panels depicting plants, evoking the stylized forms common in the Art Deco style. There are buttresses on the fifth and sixth stories of the Lexington Avenue facade's recessed section, and at the corners of the 30th through 49th stories. The crown, above the Chanin Company's 52nd floor offices, contains abstract-patterned projecting ornamentation.\n\nOriginally, 212 artificial candles at the top of the Chanin Building provided the equivalent of 30 million candlepower. These lights, meant to highlight the details of the building, were characteristic of the Art Deco style, and on cloudless nights, could be seen from more than away. They had been toned down by the late twentieth century.\n\nThe interior design was mostly the work of Rene Paul Chambellan and Jacques Delamarre. The former specialized in architectural sculpture in numerous styles, such as the Art Deco style, while the latter worked for the Chanin Company.\n\nThe lobby is accessed by passageways from 42nd and 41st Streets, with a side entrance from Lexington Avenue. The lobby is decorated in a \"modernistic\" style themed around \"The City of Opportunity\". Eight bronze reliefs designed by Chambellan perch above ornate bronze radiator grilles. The grilles depict four categories of physical and mental life. The bronze ornamentation continues in the waves on the floor, mailboxes, and elevator doors extending the general Art Deco style from the outside inward. The lobby also contains other ornamentation such as terrazzo floors with bronze inlays, as well as tan marble walls.\n\nMarble stairs lead to the basement where there are connections to Grand Central Terminal and the New York City Subway's Grand Central–42nd Street station. Also inside are 21 high speed passenger elevators, split up into three elevator banks, as well as one service elevator. When the building was opened, the first floor, mezzanine, and second floor were used by banks and other commercial concerns.\n\nThe lobby originally served as a \"palatial\" bus terminal operated by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The terminal was outfitted with marble surfaces and also contained waiting rooms and ticket offices. Buses would pull onto a revolving turntable within the terminal, which received boarding passengers on one side and deposited alighting passengers on the other. The coach terminal closed after the railroad discontinued all passenger service north of Baltimore in 1958.\n\nThe third through 48th floors consist almost entirely of leasable office space, while the 49th and 50th floors contain the Chanin brothers' board room and offices. When originally completed, the 50th floor also had a small movie theater, which was later converted into the Chanin Organization's offices. The floors above the 52nd floor were originally the offices of the Chanin Organization, with an Art Deco restroom that a building trade convention's judges referred to as \"America's finest bathroom\". Irwin Chanin's 52nd floor offices were accessed through a set of bronze gates designed by Chambellan, while bronze vector grilles were situated within the office.\n\nAs a dominant landmark in the midtown skyline upon its opening, the building had an open-air observation deck on the 54th floor. It was one of three open-air observatories in the city following World War II, the others being at 30 Rockefeller Plaza and at the Empire State Building, though there had been several other observation decks in the city prior to the war. The Chanin Building only charged 25 cents for admission, since it was not as well known as the other two buildings with outdoor observatories. Over the years, several people have committed suicide by jumping off the 54th floor observation deck. In later years, other nearby buildings surpassed the Chanin Building in height (including the Chrysler Building, diagonally across Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street), and so the observation deck was closed in the mid-20th century.\n\nThe top of the building was used as a transmission site for WQXR-FM starting on December 15, 1941, when it was relocated from Long Island City in Queens. In 1965, the transmitter was moved to the Empire State Building.\n\nThe completion of the underground Grand Central Terminal in 1913 resulted in the rapid development of the areas around Grand Central, and a corresponding increase in real-estate prices. Among these were the New York Central Building at 47th Street and Park Avenue, as well as the Grand Central Palace across 42nd Street from the present Chanin Building. By 1920, the area had become what \"The New York Times\" called \"a great civic centre\". One site that had yet to be redeveloped was the Manhattan Storage Warehouse, which was built in 1882 and still occupied the site of the Chanin Building.\n\nIrwin Chanin was an American architect and real estate developer who designed several Art Deco towers and Broadway theaters. He and his brother Henry I. Chanin designed their first Manhattan buildings in 1924 and later built and operated a number of theaters and other structures related to the entertainment industry, including the Roxy Theatre and the Hotel Lincoln. The Chanins took over an existing 105-year leasehold for the land underneath the warehouse in August 1926, upon which they planned to build a skyscraper. The brothers still had a reputation for being involved mostly in the theater industry. According to one author, when the Chanins cleared the site in 1927, many members of the general public could not tell \"whether the Chanins were builders or [...] theater-owners who had taken up building as a sideline.\" The warehouse itself was difficult to clear, since its walls had been designed to protect against \"burglary, fire and assault\". The process entailed clearing away 7,500 truck loads of brick, 1,000 of scrap metal, and 3,500 of loose earth.\n\nThe official plans for the Chanin Building were filed with the New York City Department of Buildings in June 1927, at which point 60% of the warehouse had been demolished. Sloan & Robertson, architects of the nearby Graybar Building, Pershing Square Building, and 110 East 42nd Street, were hired to design the Chanin Building.\n\nOnce the foundation had been laid, the first steel columns were installed in January 1928, with Irwin S. Chanin driving in the first rivet. The steel frame weighed an estimated and was held together by 1.5 million rivets and 160,000 bolts. Crowds frequently stopped to observe the construction process. The erection of the frame was not without problems: in one incident, the boom of a construction derrick fell from the 20th floor, nearly splitting a truck in half, though no one was injured or killed. The steelwork was completed by that June, and as was tradition at the time, two gold rivets for the Chanin Building were driven into the frame on July 2 to mark this event. The building held its topping out ceremony in August 1928.\n\nThe structure was declared complete on January 23, 1929, exactly one year after the first rivet had been driven into the building. It opened January 29 at an estimated cost of $12-14 million, with an informal opening attended by mayor Jimmy Walker. The Chanin Building thus became the first major skyscraper in Terminal City, and the third-tallest building in New York City behind the Woolworth Building and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower. Though the Chanin Building was later surpassed in height by other buildings, including the adjacent Chrysler Building that opened a year later, Irwin Chanin was instead focused on attracting tenants with an \"efficient, up-to-date\" facility.\n\nUpon opening, the Chanin Building was almost fully rented. The builders projected that by September 1, 1929, the building would be 70% rented, though the actual occupancy rate at that date was 92%. Furthermore, in 1930, \"The New York Times\" reported that 95% of the structure's was occupied by 9,000 workers. Initially, the lobby space was occupied by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's bus terminal, ticket offices, and waiting rooms. The office space included such tenants as the Kimberly-Clark paper company, Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company, and Fairchild Aircraft, while the Chanin company took all the space above the 50th floor. In addition, the Sterling National Bank took up much of the mezzanine space on the Lexington Avenue side, and a self-service and table-service restaurant opened in the basement. Through the Great Depression, leasing proceeded actively.\n\nThe building's owners filed to reorganize the operations of the Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street Corporation, which operated the Chanin Building, in 1947. In subsequent years, the Chanin Building continued to attract tenants such as Guest Keen and Nettlefolds, a Howard Johnson's restaurant, and the Barry Goldwater 1964 presidential campaign's New York state headquarters. In addition, the building hosted U.S. Chess Championships. Despite this success, the Chanin Building faced some issues: its owners, along with those of the Nelson Tower and Century Apartments, were charged with real estate tax fraud in 1974. The Chanin Building's owners were estimated to have evaded $138,549 in real estate taxes.\n\nThe Chanin Building was designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1978, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. By the 1990s, the building was owned by a syndicate headed by Stanley Stahl. Modern tenants include the Apple Bank for Savings, of which Stahl was the only stockholder, as well as the International Rescue Committee, which had moved to the building in 1994.\n\nShortly after the building's completion, architectural critic Matlack Price wrote in an \"Architectural Forum\" article that \"The architects have not here compromised a fine vision either with major errors in scale or with minor trivialities.\" Paul Goldberger of \"The New York Times\" said that the Chanin Building was \"one of the pre-eminent pieces of American Art Deco—a gracefully ornamented, 56-story slab\". The fifth edition of the \"AIA Guide to New York City\", published in 2010, characterized the Chanin Building as being \"classic style, rather than stylish ephemera. Such distinguished self-improvement seems beyond the grasp of current developers.\"\n\nThe interior design of the building was also praised. Herbert Muschamp wrote in 1992 that the Chanin Building \"tells a story of New York as the legendary beacon for immigrants\", and that its numerous amenities \"were integral to the Chanin Building's drama\". Historian Donald L. Miller stated, \"Restrained on the outside, the inside is exuberantly ornate\".\n\n\n"}

His father was a factory worker and his mother a homemaker.\n\nMetin Oktay married Servet Kardicali on May 12, 1965, in Istanbul. On February 9, 1965, the couple had a daughter who was named by Metin Oktay as \"Zeynep\". She died the same day she was born. In 1979, Metin and Servet Oktay had a granddaughter from their son Rifat Halil Pala who was named Zeynep Pala. Metin Oktay lived with his family; his spouse Servet Kardicali Oktay, his son Rifat and granddaughter Zeynep until he died on 13 September 1991 in Istanbul.\n\nOktay started his career at his local amateur club, Damlacık, in 1952 and moved to another amateur side, Yün Mensucat, in the following season during which he made his first appearance for the junior national team in 1954. He was quickly transferred to İzmirspor at the end of the season and became the top scorer with 17 goals in the İzmir League the following season, the first of many times that he would lead the top scorers in the league. In 1955, Gündüz Kılıç, trainer and former footballer of Galatasaray transferred him. Oktay, then only 19 years old, signed a five-year contract with Galatasaray in exchange for a Chevrolet car. Despite his young age, he was the top scorer in his first season in the Istanbul League, with 19 goals, and his team Galatasaray won the championship. Oktay was top scorer for four seasons in the İstanbul League and then three more in the Turkish League, thus making it seven consecutive years in the competitions he played in.\n\nOktay made a record-breaking contract with Galatasaray in 1960 and because of this deal he had to divorce his wife Oya Sarı who wanted him to play for his old club İzmirspor. In December that year, he scored four goals (after 1, 9, 61 and 71 minutes) in a 5–0 victory against arch rivals Fenerbahçe which fixed his hero status among Galatasaray supporters. Songs were created for him and he became the first-ever Turkish footballer to play himself in a movie based on his life while actively pursuing his career.\n\nMetin Oktay stayed with Galatasaray until 1969, with the exception of a short period in 1961–1962, when he played for Palermo in Italy. He was the most crowned (six times) top goalscorer in the Turkish League and set a record with 217 goals in total. Tanju Çolak broke his record of most goals in a season in 1988 by a margin of one goal. Nicknamed the Taçsız Kral or \"King without a crown\", he was a particularly strong goal scorer in Derby matches. During a Derby match against Galatasaray's archrivals Fenerbahçe in 1959, he hit the ball hard enough to open a hole in the opponents' goal net. This unforgettable shot was one of the 18 goals that Oktay scored against Fenerbahçe in his career. The other major Istanbul rivals, Beşiktaş let in 13 of his goals.\n\nOktay was also assistant coach and head coach of Galatasaray football team in the 1969–70 season and he later coached Bursaspor for a couple of years. Oktay was a board member of the club in 1984 for two years.\n\nHe played 36 times for the Turkish national team and scored 19 goals. Breaking almost every record in the history of Turkish football that stood at the time, the \"King\" retired in 1969. Oktay died on 13 September 1991 in Istanbul in a car accident.\n\nTurkish comics artist Abdullah Turhan once made a comic strip about Metin Okay, published in the magazine 1001 Roman and Fotomaç. \n\nEvery year on 13 September, Galatasaray players and supporters pay homage to the \"Uncrowned King\" at his grave in Kozlu cemetery near Topkapı in Istanbul.\n\nGalatasaray's sports complex and training facility, the Metin Oktay Sports Complex and Training Center, located in Florya, Istanbul, is named after him.\n\nA goals tally in bold indicates that Oktay was the competition's top scorer for that season.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since 2004, it has been operated as part of the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad, which is owned by Genesee & Wyoming Inc.\n\nThe Pittsburg and Shawmut Railroad is often confused with the similarly named Pittsburg, Shawmut and Northern Railroad from which the P&S had its origins. Further adding to the confusion is the fact that both were nicknamed the \"Shawmut Line\", both operated in roughly the same geographic area, and both used similar diamond logos during their history. In fact the two were separate and unrelated companies after their 1916 split.\n\nThe main line consisted of approximately 88 miles (140 km) of standard gauge track extending from Brockway, Pennsylvania to Freeport, Pennsylvania. The main shops were located in Brookville, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Pittsburg and Shawmut Railroad Company began life on July 21, 1903 as the Brookville and Mahoning Railroad, leased by the Pittsburg, Shawmut and Northern Railroad. When the PS&N declared bankruptcy in 1905, the B&M was spun off into a separate entity and was renamed in 1909 due to confusion with the Boston and Maine Railroad's initials. Like its parent, the P&S was also financially troubled in its early years. The company struggled until corporate fortunes improved with the war mobilization of the 1940s. Coal was the principal commodity for the line for its entire existence. Doodlebugs and passenger trains ran on the route in the early years but had all been eliminated by 1939.\n\nThe company acquired a ten-mile (16 km) section of Conrail track running from Sligo to Lawsonham in 1989 and reorganized it as the Red Bank Railroad. On December 31, 1991 the company purchased about of the Low Grade Secondary track from Lawsonham to Driftwood, Pennsylvania from Conrail and organized it as the Mountain Laurel Railroad.\nThe company operated under its own management until 1996 when it was acquired by the Genesee & Wyoming Inc.. The Genessee & Wyoming operated the Pittsburg & Shawmut Railroad under its own banner until January 1, 2004 when it was absorbed into the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad, another G&W company. Simultaneously, a new company with the same name was created to purchase the property, which is now operated by the BPRR. (The P&S also acquired the residual common carrier obligation on the lines.) Several portions of the main line were abandoned before the absorption and several others since.\n\nThe spelling of \"Pittsburgh\" as \"Pittsburg\" derives from the company’s origins in the Pittsburg, Shawmut & Northern Railroad. That company was chartered in 1899 when the name of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was commonly spelled without the \"h\". The United States Board on Geographic Names advocated the \"h\"-less spelling from 1891 to 1911 in an effort to standardize the spelling of place names in the United States.\n\n"}
{"id": "1830922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830922", "title": "Jon-Erik Hexum", "text": "Jon-Erik Hexum\n\nJon-Erik Hexum (; November 5, 1957 – October 18, 1984) was an American actor, known for his lead roles in the TV series \"Voyagers!\" and \"Cover Up\", and his supporting role as Pat Trammell in the biopic \"The Bear\". He died by an accidental self-inflicted blank cartridge gunshot to the head on the set of \"Cover Up\".\n\nHexum was born in Englewood, New Jersey, to Gretha and Thorleif Hexum, who were of Norwegian descent. He and his elder brother, Gunnar, were raised in Tenafly, New Jersey, by their mother after their parents divorced when Hexum was four. After graduating from Tenafly High School, Hexum went on to Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland to study biomedical engineering. He soon left that university, however, and transferred to Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. During that time, he worked as a radio disc jockey, played on the 1978 Michigan State Spartans football team, and acted in minor stage roles.\n\nA few days after graduation, he moved to New York in 1980 to pursue his acting career. While working as an apartment cleaner, he met Bob LeMond of LeMond/Zetter Management, the manager of John Travolta. LeMond saw great potential in Hexum. At LeMond's urging, Hexum relocated to Los Angeles in September 1981 to audition for a movie called \"Summer Lovers,\" which was to be directed by Randal Kleiser. Though he lost the part to Peter Gallagher, Hexum attracted the notice of Hollywood powerbrokers, and in short time was cast in the lead role of Phineas Bogg in the NBC series \"Voyagers!\". \"Voyagers!\" aired during the 1982–83 television season, with Hexum's role earning him $10,000 a week. When NBC wanted to replace the show with its own news magazine show \"Monitor\" to compete against \"60 Minutes\" on CBS however, \"Voyagers!\" was canceled after one season. Hexum's good looks and charm kept him marketable, however, and he was cast opposite Joan Collins in the made-for-television movie \"Making of a Male Model\", also starring Jeff Conaway and Roxie Roker.\n\nIn 1984, Hexum guest-starred in an episode of ABC's prime time drama \"Hotel\". He played Prince Erik, a Prince Charming-type character who sweeps his Cinderella off her feet.\n\nThat same year, Hexum took the part of terminally ill quarterback Pat Trammell, a small but well-received role in the feature film \"The Bear\", a tribute to University of Alabama football coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, played by veteran actor Gary Busey. \"The Bear\" represents Hexum’s sole performance in a feature film, released just three weeks before his death.\n\nAfter pondering several development deals, Hexum came upon a project he felt had possibilities: \"Cover Up\". When the series began production in 1984, Hexum played Mac Harper, an undercover CIA operative posing as a male model, opposite co-star Jennifer O'Neill. Hexum described the role as part \"Indiana Jones, James Bond, Mr. Magoo, and Superman.\" According to then-girlfriend, actress and singer Elizabeth \"E.G.\" Daily, \"he loved living this rich fantasy life. He was a big strong man, looked kind of like a Viking bodybuilder, and he loved to show his strength. He also liked the whole idea of guns and soldiers.\"\n\nOn October 12, 1984, the cast and crew of \"Cover Up\" were filming the seventh episode of the series, \"Golden Opportunity,\" on Stage 17 of the 20th Century Fox lot. One of the scenes filmed that day called for Hexum's character to load bullets into a .44 Magnum handgun, so he was provided with a functional gun and blanks. When the scene did not play as the director wanted it to in the master shot, there was a delay in filming. Hexum became restless and impatient during the delay and began playing around to lighten the mood. He had unloaded all but one (blank) round, spun it, and—simulating Russian roulette—he put the revolver to his right temple and pulled the trigger, apparently unaware of the danger.\n\nBlanks use paper or plastic wadding to seal gunpowder into the cartridge, and this wadding is propelled from the barrel of the gun with enough force to cause injury if the weapon is fired within a few feet of the body, particularly a vulnerable spot, such as the temple or the eye. At a close enough range, the effect of the powder gasses is a small explosion, so although the paper wadding in the blank that Hexum discharged did not penetrate his skull, there was enough blunt force trauma to shatter a quarter-sized piece of his skull and propel the pieces into his brain, causing massive hemorrhaging.\n\nHexum was rushed to Beverly Hills Medical Center, where he underwent five hours of surgery to repair his wounds. On October 18, six days after the accident, Hexum was declared brain dead. With his mother's permission, his body was flown to San Francisco on life support, where his heart was transplanted into a 36-year-old Las Vegas man at California Pacific Medical Center. Hexum's kidneys and corneas were also donated: One cornea went to a 66-year-old man, the other to a young girl. One of the kidney recipients was a critically ill five-year-old boy, and the other was a 43-year-old grandmother of three who had waited eight years for a kidney. Skin that was donated was used to treat a 3½-year-old boy with third degree burns. Hexum's body was then flown back to Los Angeles. He was cremated at Grandview Crematory in Glendale, California, and a private funeral was held. His ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean, near Malibu, California, by his mother. He left an estate estimated to be worth $255,000.\n\nHexum's death was ruled accidental. His mother later received an out-of-court settlement from 20th Century Fox Television and Glen A. Larson Productions, the production team behind \"Cover Up\".\n\nThe episode on which Hexum had been working was broadcast on November 3, 1984, two weeks after Hexum's death. \"Cover Up\" continued production without Hexum's character. Three weeks later, on November 24, Antony Hamilton was introduced as agent Jack Striker, posing as a new member of the modeling team. Hexum's character Mac is noticeably absent, said to be on another mission. At the end of the episode, Henry Towler (Richard Anderson) breaks the news that Mac has been killed on the other assignment and would not be coming back. As the tears flowed, the camera panned back, and a memoriam written by Glen Larson appeared onscreen:\nWhen a star dies, its light continues to shine\nacross the universe for millenniums (sic).\nJohn (sic) Eric Hexum died in October of this year ... but the lives he touched will continue to be brightened by his light\n... forever ... and ever.\n\n\n"}

He played for the Midlands club for ten seasons, nine at the highest level, and finished a runner-up in both the 1989–90 and 1992–93 league championships. He also played in their 1994 League Cup final triumph where they defeated Manchester United at Wembley.\n\nDuring this period, Daley was capped seven times for England between 1991 and 1992 under former club manager Graham Taylor. He made his full debut as a substitute in a vital 1–1 draw in Poland on 13 November 1991 that saw England qualify for 1992 European Championships in Sweden. He was subsequently chosen for the squad at the tournament and played in two of England's three games there, but after the tournament he never played for England again.\n\nHe nearly got onto the scoresheet in the 1994 Football League Cup Final against Manchester United, but his shot hit the post and was rebounded by Dalian Atkinson, only for Andrei Kanchelskis to block it with a handball for which he was sent off. Dean Saunders converted the penalty and put Villa 3–1 ahead, a scoreline which formed the final result and gave Villa a record fifth League Cup win. Daley collected what would be the only major trophy of his career.\n\nDaley linked up with Graham Taylor again as he finally left Aston Villa for Wolverhampton Wanderers in July 1994 for £1.25 million, but he was plagued with injuries and was only able to manage 21 appearances for the club in four seasons.\n\nHe was signed once more by Graham Taylor, now at Watford, in July 1998, on a free transfer. His injury woes continued though and he struggled to get fit, missing the final months as the club won promotion to the Premier League, Daley scoring once in the process against Birmingham City. He was given a free transfer to newly promoted Division 1 side Walsall in June 1999, and after a six-month spell there, he finished his playing career with Conference side Forest Green Rovers, hanging up his boots in July 2002.\n\nDaley's perhaps best known goal came in a First Division game against Everton at Villa Park on 22 October 1988. A spectacular flying volley in a 2–0 win for Villa, the goal quickly – thanks in no small part to the popular football video series 'Goals Galore' – became known as 'Daley's Dazzler' and is also remembered for full-back Chris Price (who supplied the cross) having a little celebration all of his own.\n\nUpon finishing his career in professional football due to persistent injury, Daley completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Sports and Exercise Science at Coventry University. During this time, he also remained at Forest Green Rovers as their fitness coach and worked with youth players at Aston Villa's academy.\n\nFollowing his studies, he joined Sheffield United as a fitness and conditioning coach in June 2003 but later quit his post following a row with new manager Bryan Robson on 30 August 2007. He was not out of work for long as he joined former club Wolves in the same role the following month. He remained at Wolves in this role for almost ten years before leaving in May 2017.\n\nIn 1995, Daley was the subject of a half-hour documentary. The series \"Respect\" was produced and directed by Pogus Caesar for Carlton TV, and featured the likes of Dwight Yorke, John Barnes and Ron Atkinson all paying tribute to the winger.\n\nIn March 2020, Daley joined the Lion's Den Gym, Bassett's Pole, as a personal trainer.\n\n"}

He was the drummer in a college band called The Jokers (later The Jolly Jokers in 1975) as Carlos Bartos, around 1965 to 1972. Between 1975 and 1991, he was, along with Wolfgang Flür, an electronic percussionist in the electronic music band Kraftwerk. He was originally recruited to play on Kraftwerk's US \"Autobahn\" tour. In addition to his percussion playing, Bartos was credited with songwriting on the \"Man-Machine\", \"Computer World\", and \"Electric Café\" albums and sang one lead vocal on the latter.\n\nBartos left Kraftwerk in August 1990, reportedly frustrated at the band's slow progress in their activities due to the increasingly perfectionist attitude of founding members Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. Karl Bartos hinted at this fact in the interview entitled \"I was a Robot\", which is a part of the documentary film \"Kraftwerk and the Electronic Revolution\".\n\nIn 1992 Bartos founded Elektric Music. This new project released the Kraftwerk-style \"Esperanto\" in 1993, and then the more guitar-based \"Electric Music\" in 1998. In between the two albums, Bartos collaborated with Bernard Sumner and Johnny Marr on Electronic's 1996 album \"Raise the Pressure\", and co-wrote material with Andy McCluskey of OMD, which appeared on both \"Esperanto\" and OMD's \"Universal\" album. In 1998, he also produced an album by Swedish synthpop band the Mobile Homes, much in the style of his work with Electronic: guitar-pop with very slight synthetic references. It was received as a great disappointment to synthpop fans, but it sold more than any of their previous albums and was used in an advert for an airline.\n\nIn 1992 Elektric Music were asked to remix Afrika Bambaataa's song \"Planet Rock\" for release on a remix album. Planet Rock was the subject of an out-of-court settlement between Kraftwerk and Tommy Boy Records head Tom Silverman, as it uses significant parts from both Kraftwerk's \"Trans-Europe Express\" and \"Numbers\".\nIn 2003, using his own name, he released the synthpop album \"Communication\", featuring such songs as \"I'm the Message,\" \"Camera,\" and \"Ultraviolet.\"\n\nIn 2007 his music provided the soundtrack to the documentary \"Moebius Redux – A Life in Pictures\", about the graphic artist Jean Giraud.\n\nKarl Bartos announced in early 2008 that he had opened the first edition of the audio-visual exhibition \"Crosstalk\" for public viewing at the white cube section on the official Karl Bartos website.

He had become devoted to natural history and especially botany at an early stage in his life, which might be regarded as self-evident for a son of a pharmacist.\nIn Magnol's days, the study of botany and medicine were inseparable. Thus he enrolled as a student in medicine at the University of Montpellier on 19 May 1655.\n\nBy Magnol's time the city of Montpellier was already long established as an important commercial and educational centre. The University of Montpellier was officially founded in 1289 (though it is said to be older) and it was the first French university to establish a botanic garden, donated in 1593 by Henry IV of France, for the study of medicine and pharmacology. Its medical school attracted students from all over Europe. Individuals well-known in medicine and botany such as Leonhart Fuchs (1501–1566), Guillaume Rondelet (1507–1566), Charles de l'Ecluse (1526–1609), Pierre Richer de Belleval (c. 1564-1632), and the great writer (and doctor) François Rabelais (c. 1493-1553), all studied at this university. So it was in one of the intellectual and botanical capitals that Magnol took his education. He got his doctor's degree (M.D.) on 11 January 1659. After receiving his degree, his attention once again shifted to botany, this time even more seriously.\n\nMontpellier was a bastion of Protestantism and Magnol was raised in the tradition of Calvinism. At that time, Roman Catholicism was the official state church, but since the Edict of Nantes (1598), Protestants officially had religious freedom and the right to work in any field or for the state. The edict did not end religious persecution and discrimination. In his life, Magnol was several times denied a position because of religious discrimination. With the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Magnol renounced Protestantism and converted to Catholicism.\n\nIn December 1663 Magnol received the honorary title \"brevet de médecine royal\" through mediation of Antoine Vallot, an influential physician of the king. No means of his financial stability are mentioned (Magnol did not have a wealthy family to support him) but it is suggested that he was practicing medicine and had an income out of that. From 1659 on he devoted much of his time to the study of botany and made several trips through the Languedoc, the Provence, to the Alps and to the Pyrenees. In 1664 there was a vacancy for 'Demonstrator of plants' in Montpellier and Magnol was proposed for the position. He was denied the appointment because of religious discrimination. This happened again in 1667 when he was the leading candidate for the chair of Professor of medicine.\n\nMeanwhile Magnol had contacts with many prominent botanist and was highly esteemed by his contemporaries. He corresponded with John Ray, William Sherard and James Petiver (England), Paul Hermann and Petrus Houttuyn (Leiden), Jan Commelin (Amsterdam), J.H. Lavater (Zurich) and J. Salvador (Barcelona), among others.\n\nIn 1687, after his conversion to Catholicism, Magnol eventually became 'Demonstrator of plants' at the botanic garden of Montpellier. In 1693, recommended by Guy-Crescent Fagon (1638–1718), then court physician, and his own student Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1656–1708), he was nominated 'doctor to the kings court'. In 1694 he finally was appointed Professor of medicine at the University of Montpellier. Through intervention of Fagon, he received a \"brevet de professeur royale\". Magnol was also appointed Director of the botanic garden in 1696, for a three-year period. After that, he received the title 'Inspector of the garden' for the rest of his life.\n\nMagnol was one of the founding members of the Société Royale des Sciences de Montpellier (1706) and held one of the three chairs in botany. In 1709 he was called to Paris to occupy the seat in the Académie Royale des Sciences de Paris that was left empty when his former student Joseph Pitton de Tournefort died prematurely.\n\nAmong Magnol's students were Tournefort and the brothers Antoine and Bernard de Jussieu.\n\nMagnol's most important contribution to science is without doubt the invention of the concept of plant families, a natural classification, based on combinations of morphological characters, as set out in his \"Prodromus historiae generalis plantarum, in quo familiae plantarum per tabulas disponuntur\" (1689) (See under major works). His work may be regarded as one of the first steps towards the composition of a tree of life. In his \"Prodromus\" he developed 75 tables, which not only grouped plants into families but also allowed for an easy and rapid identification by means of the morphological characters, the same he used to compose the groups.\n\n1676, \"Botanicum Monspeliense, sive Plantarum circa Monspelium nascentium index.\" Lyon.

[New character of plants, divided into two treatises: the first on herbs and small shrublike plants, the second on shrubs and trees]\n\nIn 1703 Charles Plumier (1646–1704) named a flowering tree from the island of Martinique \"Magnolia\", after Magnol. The name was later adopted by William Sherard, when he did the nomenclatural parts of \"Hortus Elthamensis\" by Johann Jacob Dillenius, and \"The Natural History of Carolina\" by Mark Catesby, to denote a flowering tree now known as \"Magnolia virginiana\", taking it for the same species as that described by Plumier. Linnaeus took over this name in the first edition of \"Species plantarum\", including references to both Plumier's and Sherard's names. In this way, \"Magnolia\" became the generally recognized name of a large genus of ornamental flowering trees.\n\n"}

{"id": "1830983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830983", "title": "Perchta", "text": "Perchta\n\nPerchta or Berchta (English: Bertha), also commonly known as Percht and other variations, was once known as a goddess in Alpine paganism in the Upper German and Austrian regions of the Alps. Her name may mean \"the bright one\" (Old High German \"beraht, bereht\", from Proto-Germanic *\"brehtaz\") and is probably related to the name \"Berchtentag\", meaning the feast of the Epiphany. Eugen Mogk provides an alternative etymology, attributing the origin of the name \"Perchta\" to the Old High German verb \"pergan\", meaning \"hidden\" or \"covered\". \n\nPerchta is often identified as stemming from the same Germanic goddess as Holda and other female figures of German folklore (see Frija-Frigg). According to Jacob Grimm and Lotte Motz, Perchta is Holda's southern cousin or equivalent, as they both share the role of \"guardian of the beasts\" and appear during the Twelve Days of Christmas, when they oversee spinning. \n\nGrimm says Perchta or Berchta was known \"precisely in those Upper German regions where Holda leaves off, in Swabia, in Alsace, in Switzerland, in Bavaria and Austria.\"\n\nAccording to Erika Timm, Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably Celtic, traditions of the Alpine regions after the Migration Period in the Early Middle Ages.\n\nPerchta had many different names depending on the era and region: Grimm listed the names \"Perahta\" and \"Berchte\" as the main names (in his heading), followed by \"Berchta\" in Old High German, as well as \"Behrta\" and \"Frau Perchta\". In Baden, Swabia, Switzerland and Slovenian regions, she was often called \"Frau Faste\" (the lady of the Ember days) or Pehta or 'Kvaternica', in Slovene. Elsewhere she was known as \"Posterli,\" \"Quatemberca\" and \"Fronfastenweiber\".\n\nThe mother of the Franks emperor Charlemagne may have had a related albeit unwitted influence, as it did the Visigoth queen Brunhilda on her own, into its medieval folklore, Bertha or Berthrada was said to be of long and wide feet, in effect taller than her husband called precisely, Pippin \"the Short\" and may have been the reason why Charlemagne inherited from her his unusual height.\n\nIn southern Austria, in Carinthia among the Slovenes, a male form of Perchta was known as \"Quantembermann\", in German, or \"Kvaternik\", in Slovene (the man of the four Ember days). Grimm thought that her male counterpart or equivalent is \"Berchtold.\"\n\nRegional variations of the name include \"Berigl\", \"Berchtlmuada\", \"Perhta-Baba\", \"Zlobna Pehta\", \"Bechtrababa\", \"Sampa\", \"Stampa\", \"Lutzl\", \"Zamperin\", \"Pudelfrau\", \"Zampermuatta\" and \"Rauweib\".\n\nIn some descriptions, Perchta has two forms; she may appear either as beautiful and white as snow like her name, or as elderly and haggard.\n\nIn many old descriptions, Perchta had one large foot, sometimes called a goose foot or swan foot. Grimm thought the strange foot symbolized her being a higher being who could shapeshift to animal form. He noticed that Bertha with a strange foot exists in many languages (Middle German \"Berhte mit dem fuoze\", French \"Berthe au grand pied\", Latin \"Berhta cum magno pede\", Italian \" Berta dai gran piè\", title of a medieval epic poem of italian area): \"It is apparently a swan maiden's foot, which as a mark of her higher nature she cannot lay aside...and at the same time the spinning-woman's splayfoot that worked the treadle\".\n\nIn the Tyrol she appears as little old woman with a very wrinkled face, bright lively eyes, and a long hooked nose; her hair is disheveled, her garments tattered and torn.\n\nInitially, Perchta was the upholder of cultural taboos, such as the prohibition against spinning on holidays. In the folklore of Bavaria and Austria, Perchta was said to roam the countryside at midwinter, and to enter homes during the twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany (especially on the Twelfth Night). She would know whether the children and young servants of the household had behaved well and worked hard all year. If they had, they might find a small silver coin the next day, in a shoe or pail. If they had not, she would slit their bellies open, remove their stomach and guts, and stuff the hole with straw and pebbles. She was particularly concerned to see that girls had spun the whole of their allotted portion of flax or wool during the year. She would also slit people's bellies open and stuff them with straw if they ate something on the night of her feast day, other than the traditional meal of fish and gruel.\n\nThe cult of Perchta, under which followers left food and drink for \"Fraw Percht\" and her followers in the hope of receiving wealth and abundance, was condemned in Bavaria in the \"Thesaurus pauperum\" (1468) and by Thomas Ebendorfer von Haselbach in \"De decem praeceptis\" (1439).\n\nLater canonical and church documents characterized Perchta as synonymous with other leading female spirits: Holda, Diana, Herodias, Richella and Abundia.\n\nGrimm thought Holda is her equivalent while the Weisse Frauen may derive directly from Berchta in her white form.\n\nThe word \"Perchten\" is plural for Perchta, and this has become the name of her entourage, as well as the name of animal masks worn in parades and festivals in the mountainous regions of Austria. In the 16th century, the Perchten took two forms: Some are beautiful and bright, known as the \"Schönperchten\" (\"beautiful Perchten\"). These come during the Twelve Nights and festivals to \"bring luck and wealth to the people.\" The other form is the \"Schiachperchten\" (\"ugly Perchten\") who have fangs, tusks and horse tails which are used to drive out demons and ghosts. Men dressed as the ugly Perchten during the 16th century and went from house to house driving out bad spirits.\n\nSometimes, \"der Teufel\" is viewed as the most \"schiach\" (\"ugly\") \"Percht\" and \"Frau Perchta\" as the most \"schön\" (\"beautiful\") \"Percht\".\n\nIn Italy, Perchta is roughly equivalent with La Befana, who visits all the children of Italy on the night before 6 January to fill their socks with candy if they are well behaved or a lump of coal if they are not.\n\nAccording to Jacob Grimm (1882), Perchta was spoken of in Old High German in the 10th century as Frau Berchta and thought to be a white-robed goddess who oversaw spinning and weaving, like the myths of Holda. He believed she was the feminine equivalent of Berchtold, and was sometimes the leader of the Wild Hunt. However, John B. Smith disagrees and suggests that Perchta represents the personification of the feast of the Epiphany (Perchta's Day), and is therefore not pre-Christian.\n\nIn contemporary culture, Perchta is portrayed as a \"rewarder of the generous, and the punisher of the bad, particularly lying children\".\nToday in Austria, particularly Salzburg, where she is said to wander through Hohensalzburg Castle in the dead of night, the Perchten are still a traditional part of holidays and festivals (such as the Carnival Fastnacht). The wooden animal masks made for the festivals are today called \"Perchten\".\n\nIn the Pongau region of Austria large processions of \"Schönperchten\" (\"beautiful Perchten\") and \"Schiachperchten\" (\"ugly Perchten\") are held every winter. Beautiful masks are said to encouraging financial windfalls, and the ugly masks are worn to drive away evil spirits.\n\nOther regional variations include the \"Tresterer\" in the Austrian Pinzgau region, the stilt dancers in the town of Unken, the \"Schnabelpercht\" (\"trunked Percht\") in the Unterinntal region and the \"Glöcklerlaufen\" (\"bell-running\") in the Salzkammergut. A number of large ski-resorts have turned the tradition into a tourist attraction drawing large crowds every winter.\n\n\n"}

Then he served as an assistant at the university and devoted himself to painting, drawing, photography, and wood-block art. Morimura first attracted attention in 1988, when a number of his self-portraits were included in the Venice Bienalle's Aperto exhibition for young artists. Morimura's first published artword was a recreation titled \"Portrait (Van Gogh)\" in 1985 where he recreated Vincent van Gogh's famous portrait after he had cut off his ear. Next was his redoings of well-known pieces like (\"Mona Lisa in its Origin\" [1998]), (\"An Inner Dialogue with Frida Kahlo [Collar of Thorns]\" [2001]), (\"In Praise of Velázquez: distinguished ones in confinement\" [2013]) and (\"A Requiem: Theatre of Creativity/Self-portrait as Pablo Picasso\" [2010]), world figures like Ché Guevara, Adolf Hitler, and Chairman Mao. Morimura's self-portraits were of Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, Greta Garbo, and Liza Minnelli. Other earlier works include Little Sister (+ Elder Sister; 2 works), Angels Descending a Staircase, and Six Brides Six Brides all from 1991.\n\nMorimura borrows images of figures from history and art history (including: Douglas MacArthur, Emperor Hirohito, Audrey Hepburn, Édouard Manet, Rembrandt, Cindy Sherman), and inserts his own face and body into them. He also disguises himself as the principal subjects that appear in the artworks he is inspired by. Many of the works he puts himself in pushes cultural, racial, ethnic, and gender boundaries as an Asian male because most of the artworks he appropriates have Western subjects, particularly female subjects. These include Mona Lisa, Frida Kahlo's self-portraits, and the characters in Velázquez's \"Las Meninas\" (1956). He also inserted himself into some of the Western male subjects, and the majority of those works mostly deal with race and ethnicity. Through the use of disguises, he overturns the effects of the male gaze, gender, race, ethnicity, and cultural standards, challenging the traditional methods of portraiture that he alters the original Western artworks by incorporating details related to Japanese culture. In one of his works, \"Portrait (Futago)\", Morimura changes the floral shawl from the original artwork, \"Olympia\" by Manet, with a kimono decorated with cranes. Because traditional portraits were mostly Western dominated, Morimura's combination of crossing multiple boundaries at a marginalized position became a major focus through his photographic works. He has also created a series of hybrid self-portraits modeled after the art of Frida Kahlo.\n\nParody is discussed as the postmodern strategy. It is theorized with regard to concepts of gender and sexual identities as performative acts, as much as to aesthetic practices. Using photography and his own body, Morimura re-images some of art history's masterpieces. As well as, images drawn from popular culture such as stills of female movie stars like Marilyn Monroe, Jodie Foster, Vivien Leigh, and Marlene Dietrich. Through his masterworks, Morimura transgresses his cultural and gender territories; from East to West and from male to female. His photographs also reveal that photography deconstructs the self-portrait, and that the photographic self-portrait is a new way of constituting and realizing the self, and of our contemporary way of seeing our own absence.\n\nAmong others, Morimura's exhibitions have been shown at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1992), the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art in Jouy-en-Josas, France (1993), the Hara Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo (1994), the Guggenheim Museum (1994), the Yokohama Museum of Art in Yokohama, Japan (1996), Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego (2006), the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney (2007), and The Japan Society in New York City (2018).\n\n\nMorimura was nominated for the Hugo Boss Prize in 1996. He was nominated for the Kyoto Cultural Merit Award in 2006. Morimura was also nominated for the Minister of Education for Fine Arts in 2007. In 2011, he was nominated for 52nd Mainichi Art Award, Photographic Society of Japan, the 24th kyoto Artistic Culture and he received the Medal with Purple Ribbon. In 2013, he was selected as Person of Cultural Merit by Kyoto City.\n\nHe won the Osaka Culture Prize in 2016.\n\n"}

The village lies between Broughton and Longridge, and mostly lies in the civil parish of Whittingham, although the ancient centre lies in the civil parish of Goosnargh. The parish of Goosnargh had a population of 1,204 recorded in the 2001 census, increasing to 1,316 at the 2011 Census. The village population in 2011 was 1,072.\n\nThe name, meaning \"Gosan's or Gusan's hill pasture\", derives from Gosan or Gusan (an Old Irish personal name) and \"erg\" (Norse for \"hill pasture\"). The name appeared in the Domesday Book as \"Gusansarghe\" but by 1212 had changed to \"Gosenargh\", closer to today's pronunciation. However, one reference suggested \"Gusansarghe\" was from Old Norse \"gudhsins hörgi\" (related to \"hörgr\"), meaning \"at the idol's (god's) temple.\"\n\nThe Anglican parish church of St Mary the Virgin is situated on Church Lane. Trinity Methodist Church, originally dating from the early 1880s, is situated on Whittingham Lane.\n\nGoosnargh has two public houses, \"The Grapes\" located on Church Lane and \"The Stags Head\" on Whittingham Lane. The \"Bushells Arms\", also located on Church Lane, closed in 2010 and is now a private residence.\n\nThere is also a Post Office, hairdresser, pharmacy, village hall and a fish and chip shop in the village. There used to be a gift shop and an estate agent in the village but these have recently closed down. The village is also the location of the Whittingham and Goosnargh Social Club.\n\nThe village holds an annual festival on the first Saturday after the Spring Bank Holiday Monday during which there is a procession through the village. The procession includes decorated floats, fancy dress, maypole dancing and marching bands.\n\nThe village gave its name to the Goosnargh Cake, a type of caraway seed shortcake biscuit. Goosnargh Cornfed Chicken and Duck is championed by chefs including Gordon Ramsay.\n\nThe oldest house in Goosnargh is Stone Cottage on Goosnargh Lane. It is now 339 years old. The beams in the 900-year-old local church have traces of sea salt in them. People believe they were from old Viking long boats.\n\nThe village itself has a population of 1,540, much of which is included in the civil parish of Whittingham.\n\nThe number 4 bus runs through Goosnargh about every hour and goes to Preston in one direction and Chipping in the other. It is the only bus service to Goosnargh, except for school buses (584, 585 and 678).\n\nGoosnargh village has a primary school: Goosnargh Oliversons C of E. Broughton High School, Longridge High School and St Cecilia's RC High School are the three high schools whose catchment areas include Goosnargh.\n\nThe footballers Lily Parr and Peter Corr both died in Goosnargh.\n\nBushell House, formerly known as Bushell's Hospital, on Mill Lane, is a retirement home and a Grade II listed building dating from 1722.\n\nGoosnargh parish includes the small villages of Inglewhite and Whitechapel, and Beacon Fell Country Park.\n\nThe parish contains the Roman Catholic church of St Francis, Hill Chapel, and an adjoining Catholic primary school of the same name. The sixteenth-century Catholic martyr George Beesley was born at the site.\n\nOnly one side of one road in Goosnargh village, including the parish church, lies within Goosnargh parish; almost all of the village lies within adjacent Whittingham parish. This may explain why the village is sometimes referred to as \"Goosnargh and Whittingham\", as if there were two villages. Some road signs on entering the village display \"Goosnargh and Whittingham\". The website of the local \"Goosnargh & Whittingham Whitsuntide Festival\" refers to \"the twin villages of Goosnargh and Whittingham\". An article in a local newspaper also refers to \"the villages of Whittingham and Goosnargh\". However, no modern maps show a village marked \"Whittingham\" and the website of Whittingham Parish Council refers only to the village of Goosnargh.\n\nThe parish was part of Preston Rural District throughout its existence from 1894 to 1974. In 1974 the parish became part of the Borough of Preston, which became a city in 2002.\n\nTwo miles out of Goosnargh village is Ye Horn's Inn, noted for its roast duck and incorporating the Goosnargh Brewing Company. The brewery produces a number of beers including Goosnargh Gold, Goosnargh Truckle and Real Goosnargh Bitter (RGB).\n\nFive of the 10 Lancashire cheese dairies listed on the British Cheese Board's website in 2009 are located in Goosnargh parish: Butler's, Greenfields, Mrs Kirkham's, Shorrocks and Carron Lodge.\n\nIn July 2015 an outbreak of bird flu was officially confirmed at Field Foot Farm on Eaves Green Lane in the parish and a exclusion zone was established, within which movement of poultry, birds and mammals was forbidden without licence. The strain of flu was identified as H7N7, and there was little risk to public health. 170,000 birds were expected to be culled.\n\nThe parish is the home of Goosnargh Gin which is inspired by the nearby Bowland Fells.\n\nDuring the Second World War the operations bunker of RAF Barton Hall was located at a site on Langley Lane on the border of the parishes of Goosnargh and Whittingham. After the War the Royal Observer Corps 21 Group Headquarters and the Western Sector Control of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation took over the bunker. In the bunker was the standby national control of the famous \"four-minute warning\" air raid warning system for the UK. The ROC and UKWMO were disbanded between 1991 and 1995 and the nuclear bunker was closed. The premises are now used as a veterinary practice.\n\nThe name \"Goosnargh\" appears in the works of Douglas Adams. In \"So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish\", it is a Betelgeusian word used by Ford Prefect \"when he knew he should say something but didn't know what it should be\". Alternatively, in \"The Meaning of Liff\", his comic dictionary based on British place names, it is defined as \"Something left over from preparing or eating a meal, which you store in the fridge despite the fact that you know full well you will never ever use it\".\n\n\n"}

There he attended art school and befriended Gustave Moreau. He worked for five decades as a restorer for antique dealer Madame Lelong. He began writing after he met the musician Germaine de SurVille in 1913.\nLong before the First World War, he participated, as a painter, sculptor, poet, theater presenter, playwright and creator of groups and magazines, in the great adventure of modern art.Apollinaire, of whom he is a friend, names him \"the Pyrogene\", so fiery is his flame of innovator and exciter.\nFrom January 1916 to December 1919, Albert-Birote edited the avant-garde art magazine \"SIC\", an acronym for \"Sons Idées Couleurs\" (\"Sounds Ideas Colors\"), which featured writings by Futurists, Surrealism, and Dadaists.His review Sic becomes the turntable of all avant-garde initiatives, from cubism or futurism and to surrealism, a movement that he will help to be born, but to which he will not adhere, this \"blaster\" having the religion of independence and objectivity.\nIf he wrote a number of poem books (Thirty-one Pocket Poems; 1917; Daily Poems, 1919; La Triloferie, 1920; Poems to the Other Me, 1927; Amenpeine, La Cle des Champs, La Panthere noire, 1938; Natural Amusements, 1945; 110 drops of poetry, 1952, etc.) this work of an explosive lyricism, funny and eminently \"modern\" is inseparable from the theatrical work that Alber-Birot composed, from 1917 to 1922, in a bourlesque tone which announces Ionesco: Larountala, Matoum and Trevibar, The man cut into pieces, the Bondieu, the folding women, etc, and it is dominated by two great epics in prose: Grabinoulor (1933) and the Memoirs of Adam (1943).\nHis first volume of poems was \"Trente et un Poèmes de Poche\" (1917). His novel \"Grabinoulor\" appeared in 1919.Grabinoulor, which was partially brought to light in 1964, is certainly his masterpiece and one of the most important works of \"modern\" poetry.Bernard Jourdan has finely established that the name of the hero of this poem-river, from which all punctuation is banned, is the almost successful anagram of \"We Albert-Birot\"; contemporary type, this Grabinoulor knows a host of adventures, some daily, others wonderful, which resemble him to the heroes of Rabelais and Lewis Caroll, but also, and above all, to the supermen of modern mythology, from Fantomas to Tarzan , from Arsene Lupine to science fiction superman, capable of traveling through the centuries as well as through the stars.We also owe Pierre Albert-Birot, a singular man, poet on the fringes who exerts a great fascination for the new generations, fanciful novels like Remy Floche, employee (1934), learned translations of Homere, Eschyle and Virgile, transcriptions in modern French medieval poets and interesting studies on prosodic forms.\n\nAlbert-Birot directed the first performance of \"Les mamelles de Tirésias\" (\"Tiresias's Breasts\", 1917) by Guillaume Apollinaire, a friend who had also been a contributor to \"SIC\".

{"id": "1831011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831011", "title": "Mazda B series", "text": "Mazda B series\n\nThe Mazda B series is a series of pickup trucks first manufactured in 1961 by Mazda. Since the launch of the B series, Mazda has used the engine displacement to determine each model's name; the B1500 had a 1.5 L engine and the B2600 had a 2.6 L engine. In Japan, the name Mazda Proceed was used for the compact pickup. Other names used for this line include Mazda Bravo (Australia), Mazda Bounty (New Zealand), Mazda Magnum/Thunder/Fighter (Thailand), and Mazda Drifter (South Africa).\n\nMazda's partnership with Ford resulted in both companies selling this vehicle under different names; Ford called its version the Ford Courier, and later the Ford Ranger. The Mazda B-series and Ford Ranger models sold in North America were developed by Ford, whereas models sold elsewhere under the same badge were engineered by Mazda.\n\nMazda's first vehicles were three-wheeled trucks, also known as auto rickshaws starting with the Mazda-Go in 1931, followed with the Mazda K360 in 1959, the , and the larger . One of Mazda's first four-wheeled trucks was the 1958 D1100, briefly called the , with a 1105 cc air-cooled in-line two cylinder engine installed under the seat. That engine was replaced by a water-cooled unit in 1959 and joined by the larger capacity D1500. In 1962, passenger car size requirements no longer applied to commercial vehicles and the truck grew longer, with a two-liter D2000 available and the smallest D1100 discontinued. The D1500 and D2000 remained in production until the June 1965 introduction of the Mazda Kraft.\nThe Mazda B-series pickup truck was introduced in Japan in August 1961 as the B1500 (BUA61). This model was the only Japanese market model to be badged under the B-series naming scheme, i.e. B1500. The BUD61 (second generation) that followed was the first model of the long-running \"Proceed\" series sold in Japan. It had a 1,484 cc OHV water-cooled engine with wet sleeve cylinders which produced , and a one-ton payload. This model also had a torsion bar front/leaf spring rear suspension, which was advanced for its time, giving it a relatively smooth ride. The B1500 was remodeled between late 1962 and September 1963; it received a new chassis code, BUB61. The BUB61 was more spacious; its cabin was extended by and it had a stretched body and wheelbase. The BUB61 had a new, upside-down, trapezoidal grille instead of the earlier full-width unit, with thirteen bars rather than nine, turn signals on the fenders, and more chrome trim—including a decor strip on the side.\n\nIn addition to the standard two-door \"styleside\" pickup truck body there were also a double-cab truck, and a similar double-cab version called the \"pickup.\" The \"pickup\" had a fully integrated coupé utility body rather than the separate bed of the truck version, as it was based on the somewhat passenger-oriented light van. This model was a two-door, fully glazed van with a fold-down tailgate and an electrically powered window, which was rare in the Japanese market at the time. The light van (BUAVD) was introduced in September 1962, and the two double-cab models followed shortly after. These three models were built on the shorter wheelbase chassis; when the longer chassis was introduced it was not deemed worthwhile to create new bodywork. These models were produced for only a few months. The B1500 was sleeker and considerably more powerful than its competitors in the Japanese market, but it was also markedly more expensive and it failed to sell in the expected quantities.\nThe 1966 B1500/Proceed presented in October 1965 used the same 1,484 cc OHV I4 engine as its predecessor, with minor changes to the cylinder head and valves and the use of a downdraft carburetor instead of the sidedraft unit used on the models sold between 1961 and 1965. The UA engine now produced at 5200 rpm. The chassis was now called the \"BUD61\"; it was longer than its predecessor and received new bodywork of a squarer design, and four headlights. In January 1971, a 1600 cc model with the chassis code BNA61 was introduced. This had SAE in global markets; US brochures did not specify its power output and European importers claimed DIN. In Japan, a minimum (SAE gross) was claimed; the model was advertised in Japan as the \"GT-Truck\".\n\nIn March 1972, the Proceed 1300, with a smaller 1.3-liter engine, was released and remained available in Japan until 1975. It had in SAE gross but was advertised as a GT-truck. The B1500 was the first Japanese pickup truck to be assembled in New Zealand from CKD kits. Assembly started in 1967 at Steel's Motor Assemblies, which also built the Toyota Corona and later became Toyota New Zealand's Christchurch plant after a government order for 672 units. The model remained in local assembly at various plants for several generations.\n\nThe B series was introduced to the United States with the 1972 \"B1600\". In 1974, the similar rotary-powered \"Rotary Pickup\" was released in the US. The engine was enlarged to 1.8-liters for 1975's B1800, a model that had been available to Canadian customers since around 1970. It was known in the Japanese market as the \"Proceed\", where it was also sold as the Ford Courier. Its strong sales in the US market—mostly with Ford badging—relieved Mazda's pressing cash flow troubles in the period following the 1970s energy crisis.\n\nEngines:\n\nThe Rotary Pickup (REPU) was the world's first and only Wankel-engined pickup truck. It was sold from 1974 to 1977 and appears to only have been available in the US and Canada. The Rotary-Engined Pickup (REPU) had a four-port 1.3-liter \"13B\" four-barrel carbureted engine, flared fenders, a battery mounted under the bed, a different dash, a front grille, and round taillights.\n\nIt is estimated that just over 15,000 units were built. Most were made for the 1974 model year (PA136 chassis), but the effect of the energy crisis on sales caused Mazda to restamp many of the 1974 models with a prefix \"S\", designating them as 1975 models; (SPA136). Approximately 700 units were built for the 1976 model year, when the four-speed manual transmission was upgraded to a five-speed. Mazda invested in a moderate redesign for the 1977 model (PA236), updating its electrical systems and adding a cab stretch for increased comfort. About 3,000 units were manufactured, after which the REPU was discontinued due to poor sales.\n\n\"Road & Track\" magazine was impressed with its \"smooth, quiet power\" and \"nice\" interior. The vehicle retailed for about ; its observed fuel economy was . Most of the trucks are found on the West Coast of the US; they continue to be sought out by enthusiasts. Like many Mazda rotary vehicles, the REPU was raced. It took third place in the 1976 SCCA Mojave 24 Hour Rally driven by Malcolm Smith and Jack Sreenan.\n\nThe first generation Ford Courier was introduced for the 1972 model year and sold for a little over when introduced—close to the price of a Ford F-100. The Courier was manufactured by Toyo Kogyo (Mazda), and imported and sold by Ford Motor Company as a response to the unforeseen popularity of the small Toyota and Nissan (Datsun) pickups among young buyers in the West. Like the other mini-pickups of the time, it featured a sub-2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine, a four-speed manual transmission, rear wheel drive, a load capability of , and was fairly inexpensive compared to full-size pickups of the time. To circumvent the 25 percent chicken tax on light trucks, Couriers like Chevrolet LUV's were imported in \"cab chassis\" configurations, which included the entire light truck without the cargo box or truck bed, and were only subject to a 4 percent tariff. Subsequently, a truck bed would be attached to the chassis and the vehicle could be sold as a light truck.\n\nThe body styling was effectively that of the related Mazda B series, but its frontal treatment was unique; its grille was designed to emulate that of the larger Ford F series and large, single headlights were fitted instead of the B series's smaller twin units. When the Courier was introduced, it was supplied with a 1.8-liter overhead cam engine that produced at 5,070 rpm and at 3,500 rpm. A four-speed manual transmission was standard; a three-speed automatic option was also offered. A five-speed manual option was added in 1976.\n\nBadging was changed several times in the first generation of the series. In 1972, the tailgate read \"Ford Courier\" in large, raised letters; there was a small \"Courier\" badge on the front of the hood. From 1973 until 1976, the hood badging read \"Ford\". In 1973, the tailgate read \"Courier\" in large letters, with a small \"Ford\" badge on the upper left. In 1974, it read \"Ford\" in large letters, with a small \"Courier\" badge on the lower right. In 1976, the cab was lengthened by and extra trim was added to the grille.\nThe model's third generation was introduced in April 1977 as the PE chassis for the Proceed 1600. The Japanese model had a claimed and a top speed of . The new model was more comfortable than the previous; it had a woodgrain dashboard and other luxuries. Outside Japan it was sold as the B1600 and later as the B1800, which was originally sold only in North America. In the US for the 1980 model year, it was sold as the B2000, which used a 2.0-liter F/MA engine, replacing the B1800. The diesel 2.2-liter B2200 was sold from 1981 with the chassis code UD (introduced during 1982 for the United States). In the US, the 1984 B2000 continued to be sold through 1985; the next generation only appeared as a \"1986\". The 2.0-liter version was called PE2M6/M7 until 1981—\"6\" for the short wheelbase, \"7\" for the long bed—after which it had the chassis code UC. In Japan, this truck was discontinued in October 1979 because commercial customers preferred vans over the less space-efficient, bonneted trucks.\n\nThe B2000 was also available in a long-bed version with a longer wheelbase and rear overhang, which was given the model name \"Sundowner\" in some markets—a reference to nomadic Australian herders who would make camp wherever they were at sundown. The regular model code UC11 was changed to UC21 when it was fitted with a long bed. The chassis coding system used for the US market in 1981 when a standardized VIN code was introduced. This change led to a second coding system, complicating the identification and grouping of these trucks. The B series was reskinned during 1982, with new sheetmetal below the belt line, and was replaced in January 1985. By this time, 1.8 million Mazda B-series trucks had been built since 1961.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the Courier was a compact pick-up built for Ford by Mazda in Japan. It was first offered on the Australian market in 1979. Both Mazda and Ford versions for New Zealand were assembled locally. Gulf Auto Restorations in New Zealand also built a run of double-cab Ford Couriers in 1979, long before Mazda themselves developed such a model.\n\nEngines:\n\nIn 1977, the Courier was redesigned and various new options were made available. The truck was available with front disc brakes and a Ford-built 2.3-liter engine option, which was the same engine used in the Ford Pinto and Mustang II. The key feature distinguishing the Courier from Mazda's B series was the single headlights, although with park and indicator lights were placed inset starting in 1978. 1977 models retained the turn signal lights in the bumper. In 1979, the base model engine was increased in size to 2.0-liters. The optional Ford 2.3-liter engine was produced in Brazil.\n\nThe Courier was never available with a diesel engine in the US. However, the 1982 Mazda B2200 was available with the S2, a Perkins-built 4.135, 2.2-liter four-cylinder diesel engine, producing at 2,100 rpm. This diesel engine was available for the 1983 and 1984 Ford Ranger; for the 1985 to 1987 Ford Rangers it was replaced with the 2.3-liter \"4D55T\" turbo diesel.\n\nThe Courier continued to be sold in North America until the model year 1982, when power steering was added. For 1983, Ford of North America introduced its own Ford Ranger to fill its compact truck segment, which replaced the Courier in the US and Canadian markets. In other markets such as Australasia, this generation of Courier continued to be sold until 1985, when the next generation was introduced. Australian models were redesigned in 1982 or 1983.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1982, a number of electric Ford Couriers were produced. Jet Industries purchased \"vehicle gliders\"—Ford Courier bodies without engines, and fitted them with a series-connected direct current motor and lead-acid accumulators; they labeled the vehicles the Jet Industries ElectraVan 750. These were sold mainly as service trucks, generally to local government departments. They had a top speed of around , and covered on a full charge. A number of these vehicles still exist, usually with upgraded motor control systems and higher-voltage battery packs.\nA new Proceed/B series (UF) was introduced in January 1985; it was produced until June 1999. A five-speed manual transmission was the primary choice in most markets, with options of a four-speed automatic transmission option and part-time four wheel drive. The 2.6-liter, Mitsubishi-powered B2600 was added in 1986. 1987 saw the Mazda inline-four engine upgraded to 2.2-liters in the B2200; the smaller engine was phased out of the North American markets after that year. In 1988, the Mitsubishi engine was replaced with a new family of Mazda powerplants. This generation also returned to the Japanese market as the \"Proceed\", where it was marketed mostly as a \"lifestyle\" truck.\n\nFrom 1991, an SUV/RV version of this generation was manufactured and sold as the Proceed Marvie; this was sold as the Ford Raider in Australia. The Proceed Marvie had a UV chassis code. It had three rows of seats, with the rearmost accessible by walking past the second row on the left. This car was only offered with right-hand-drive. A similar version of the vehicle was developed in Thailand, where it was sold as a version of the Mazda B series. In 1988, the larger Mitsubishi carbureted engine was replaced with Mazda's more powerful, 2.6-liter, four-cylinder, fuel-injected engine. The new model was named B2600i—\"i\" for injection. Both Mazda B series and the Ford Courier versions were assembled from CKD kits in New Zealand. The New Zealand lineup started with the 2.2 diesel with , with the petrol 2.2 offering and the fuel injected 2.6 .\n\nIn South Africa, South African Motor Corporation (SAMCOR)—now Ford SA—fitted the B series with the 3.0- and later the 3.4-liter Ford Essex V6 as a range-topping engine option. The Essex engine was produced at Ford's Struandale engine plant in Port Elizabeth. In Zimbabwe, the B series was assembled at the Willowvale Mazda Motor Industry plant in Willowvale, Harare, where it was fitted with the 1.6 and 1.8-liter engines.\n\nEngine options:\n\n\nUpon its North American debut in 1986, the B2000 was very well received by automotive critics. It was praised for its comfortable ride, smooth handling, and general car-like feel despite its ability to perform those tasks required of a truck.\n\nFor the 1986–1993 model years, there were mainly three trim levels available in North America: Base, SE-5, and LX (later LE-5). The base model came with standard 14-inch steel wheels and not much else besides the basics (this did not include a rear step bumper). The SE-5 was the \"sporty\" trim level, with added features such as a tachometer, side-mounted truck mirrors, a rear step bumper, an AM/FM stereo, sporty white/black wheels, white-lettered Bridgestone SF Radial tires (which have long since been discontinued), and a prominent stripe graphic kit, the latter being the most easily distinguishable feature of the SE-5. The LX was the more luxurious trim level, with standard features that made it the most well-equipped trim line of the bunch. Such added features included air conditioning, power steering, power brakes, cruise control, AM/FM stereo with cassette deck and equalizer, center console, locking glove box, and chrome trim throughout (interior door handles and window cranks, taillight bezels, chrome added trim on the sides of the body, a chrome rear step bumper, a chrome strip on the front bumper, and the same steel wheels that came with the SE-5 but with a chrome finish). For the 1990 model year, the LX trim level was replaced with the LE-5, which combined a hybrid of styling and features from both the LX and SE-5.\n\nThe beefy B2600 4x4 model (1986–1987) had its own styling distinctions, such as a three-spoke steering wheel, fender flares, a wider front bumper, mud guards, and a carbureted Mitsubishi engine, which was added in response to complaints about the B2000's lack of power when compared to other trucks in its class. In 1989, the B2600 had an italicized \"i\" added to the badging (B2600i) to distinguish between the Mitsubishi engine and the new fuel-injected Mazda G6 engine. The B2600i was also available in the two wheel drive version. All B2600i models were factory equipped with a hood that has a distinct center bulge, commonly referred to as a \"bubble hood.\"\n\nAlthough the Mazda B series remained largely unchanged in appearance throughout its eight-year run in the North American markets, there were minor changes here and there. For instance, 1986 was the only year that the Mazda B series retained a small chrome/white \"MAZDA\" emblem on its grille; in 1987, it was changed to a larger painted plastic piece to match the colors of the grille itself, and this remained unchanged throughout the remainder of its run. The 1990 model year saw the first major refresh in the B series: the front bumper and grille, which had been painted a dark metallic gray with light silver headlight bezels from 1986–1989, were changed to black with light silver headlight bezels. 1990 also brought the upgrade of a new and more modern alloy style wheel for the upper trim levels. Perhaps the most noticeable difference throughout the years was the gradual disappearance of the SE-5's stripe graphics. In 1986, the kit (which only came in a grayscale color scheme) covered a large portion of the sides of the truck, with lower and upper portions of the body being taken into account. In 1987, the SE-5's stripe kit was reduced to a much more simple set of lines running along the lower portions of the body and coming upwards towards the taillights where they read \"SE-5\". By 1989, the stripes had been reduced even more, with new gradient-style graphics starting from the doors and running towards the back.\n\nFor the North American markets, Mazda spent more than to design and develop the 1986–1993 B-series trucks to meet consumer demands. For the 1994 model year, to save costs related to the chicken tax, Mazda introduced a rebadged version of the Ford Ranger, which was produced at Ford's Twin Cities Assembly Plant in Minnesota, and Edison Assembly in New Jersey. Because of declining sales and a lack of significant updates to its parent platform, the Ford-built B series was discontinued after the 2009 model year. The North American Ranger was discontinued at the end of 2011 with the closure of the Twin Cities plant.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1997 a badge-engineered version of the Mazda Proceed Marvie wagon was sold as the Ford Raider. Like the Mazda version, it was an SUV/MPV based on the Proceed/B-Series/Ranger/Courier.\n\nIn the 1998 model year, Mazda renewed its B series for international markets. Production at the AutoAlliance Thailand plant began in May 1998. It has the chassis code \"UN\". This model was also sold as the Ford Ranger in Europe and Asia and as the Ford Courier in Australia and New Zealand. Production also began that year at the Ford Motor Company Philippines plant. CKD versions were also assembled in South Africa and Ecuador. In March 2002 a 2892 cc (2.9-liter) version of the naturally aspirated 2.5-liter diesel engine was also developed and sold in \"general markets\" and the Gulf States as the B2900.\n\nThe truck was sold in more than 130 countries under a variety of names. It was called the Fighter and Ranger in Southeast Asia—except in Singapore where it was called the Proceed—the Mazda Bounty and Ford Courier in New Zealand, the Mazda Bravo in Australia, and the Mazda Drifter in South Africa. The B2600/B2200s sold in Venezuela and nearby Latin American countries were assembled in Colombia by Compañía Colombiana Automotriz S.A. (CCA). They had a 2.6-liter inline-four engine, four-wheel-drive model and an entry level model with a 2.2-liter inline-four with rear-wheel-drive. In 2002, a \"Freestyle\" model with rear suicide doors became available on this platform. The rest of the range was revised in 2002 and 2004. These models are unrelated to the Mazda B-series and Ford Ranger models in North America.\n\nIn Australia, in January 2005, the Courier received a 4.0 V6. It was available in GL (Super Cab and Double Cab) and XLT (Double Cab only) trims. The B series was released in September 2005, with the B4000 Bravo DX (Dual Cab only), DX+ (Freestyle and Dual Cab) and SDX (Freestyle and Dual Cab) trims being available.\n\nThere were two fuel tank sizes available. For the 2WD Stretch Cab and Dual Cab, the fuel tank size is 63 L. For all 4WD models (and the 2WD Regular Cab), the fuel tank size is 70 L.\n\nThe Ford Everest or Endeavour is a midsized SUV version of the Ford Ranger that shares more than 30 percent of its components with the donor pickup truck model. The concept was similar to the Mazda Proceed Marvie and its Ford Raider twin sold in the 1990s based on the previous generation Mazda B series. It was a four-door SUV, but in similar fashion to the original Toyota 4Runner of the cargo area having a removable top.\n\nThe Everest was sold in Asia, Central America and the Bahamas. The Everest was introduced in March 2003; it was built at the AutoAlliance Thailand plant in Rayong, and as CKD kits in Chengalpattu, India; and Hai Duong, Vietnam. In India, the Everest was called the Ford Endeavour.\n\nThis Everest had its origins in the Ford Ranger, which was built for the Southeast Asian markets at the Rayong plant. Its underpinnings remained very much those of a pickup truck, while its engine was a Mazda-derived unit used for its low cost, fuel efficiency and emissions, which met the markets' standards. A Hiroshima-based design team developed the Everest/Endeavour to suit developing markets. In 2006, the Everest, the Ford Ranger and Mazda B-series pickups were replaced with the new Mazda BT-50 and its derivatives. While the Mazda versions introduced the new \"BT-50\" name, Ford versions continued under the names \"Ranger\" for pickups and \"Everest\" for wagons.\n\nThe Everest came with three-row seating in rear- or four-wheel drive, with either a 2.5-liter diesel or 2.6-liter petrol engine. It rides on a wheelbase.\n\nFor the 1994 model year, Mazda North America replaced the fourth-generation (UF) B-Series with a compact truck derived from the Ford Ranger. Effectively the reverse of the 1972-1982 agreement that produced the Ford Courier, the Mazda B-Series for the United States and Canada was produced by Ford alongside the Ranger in its Twin Cities Assembly facility.\n\nAlong with becoming a counterpart of the highest-selling compact truck in North America, producing the vehicle in the United States allowed Mazda to entirely circumvent the 25% \"chicken tax\" (the first brand to do so). Sharing identical mechanical underpinnings, the two model lines were produced with a high degree of visual similarity, with the B-Series receiving its own front fascia and pickup bed design; extended cabs were styled with separate exterior trim from the Ranger.\n\nFollowing the development of the Ranger in its body and chassis, the B-Series underwent an update for the 1998 model year. For the 2002 model year, the model line was renamed Mazda Truck in North America.

It is an independent, not-for-profit, global organisation, supported by government and NGO membership from around the world.\n\nBased mostly in the developing world, it has 20 regional, national or project offices in all continents and a head office in Ede, the Netherlands. \nThe NGO works in over 100 countries and at different scales to tackle problems affecting wetlands. With the support of dozens of governmental, NGO and corporate donors and partners, it supports about 80 projects.\n\nWetlands International's work ranges from research and community-based field projects to advocacy and engagement with governments, corporate and international policy fora and conventions. Wetlands International works through partnerships and is supported by contributions from an extensive specialist expert network and thousands of volunteers.\n\nIt was founded in 1937 as the International Wildfowl Inquiry and the organisation was focused on the protection of waterbirds. Later, the name became International Waterfowl & Wetlands Research Bureau (IWRB). The scope became wider; besides waterbirds, the organisation was also working on the protection of wetland areas.\n\nLater, organisations with similar objectives emerged in Asia and the Americas: the Asian Wetland Bureau (AWB) (initiated as INTERWADER in 1983) and Wetlands for the Americas (WA) (initiated in 1989). In 1991, the three organisations started to work closely together. \n\nIn 1995, the working relation developed into the global organisation Wetlands International.\n\nWetlands International works in many thematic areas throughout the world, including the links between peatlands and climate change, as well as wetlands and waterbird migration, based on extensive research as well as field projects. It coordinates the International Waterbird Census, a large-scale citizen science project with decades of data. \n\nCurrently, Wetlands International has four strong areas of work, which are:\n\nWetlands International's peatlands work is focused in Eurasia and southeast Asia. The peatswamp forests of Central Kalimantan are studied and worked on in particular for climate mitigation. The project Restoring peatlands in Russia is a joint-effort with the government and Greifeswald University, and was recognised by the UNFCCC with a Momentum for Change award in 2017, for storing up to 200,000 tonnes CO2e of carbon emissions every year by rewetting peatlands and preventing fires. \n\nIn the severely degraded peat lands of Central Kalimantan (Indonesia), drainage canals and logging have had disastrous impacts in an attempt to convert the unsuitable peatswamps into rice fields. By building small dams and blocks, the drainage of the area was stopped, preventing further oxidation of the peat soil. The area was then reforested with native tree species and community fire brigades to prevent the island's huge problem of peat fires.\n\nPrevious work in China has included the Ruoergai marshes, and new work is looking at the Yellow Sea/Bohai migratory bird flyway. Runoff from the glaciers in the Himalayas towards China’s lowland is regulated and stored in the Ruoergai marshes. The Wetlands International China office worked to have this peatland declared a Ramsar site, giving the Chinese government the obligation to protect the area. Furthermore, because of the work with the local Chinese authorities in measuring the impact of different management options, peat mining and drainage are now no longer allowed in Ruoergai and the neighbouring counties. This also leads to improved water supply to the Yellow River and Yangtze River.\n\nIn Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, the Wetlands International Latin America office built awareness of sustainable use of the peatlands from the local to the national level, which have contributed to their protection.\n\nCoastal wetlands such as mangrove forests and coral reefs reduce the impact of storms. Mangroves can even cope with sea-level rise and provide protection from impacts of waves. \n\nIn dryland regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, less rainfall and longer droughts increase the already huge importance of the Sahelian wetlands, and at the same time threaten overexploitation of these areas.\n\nWetlands International works in Mali to improve the livelihoods and water provision of communities in the Inner Niger Delta in a changing climate.\n\nWetlands International works to protect and restore the rich biodiversity of wetlands. Millions of waterbirds depend on wetlands like marshes, lakes and coastal zones. Wetlands International coordinates an International Waterbird Census in most countries of the world outside the USA where it approximates to the Christmas Bird Count run by the Audubon Society. The census takes place in 143 countries, divided into five regions, visiting 15,000 sites over 60 years. \n\nWetlands International promotes the establishment of ecological networks of well managed, protected wetlands, along the main flyway routes of migratory waterbirds. These wetlands provide stepping stones for migratory waterbirds; crucial for their survival. Wetlands International supports international governmental agreements to create these networks.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1831028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831028", "title": "BT 21CN", "text": "BT 21CN\n\nThe 21st Century Network (21CN) programme is the data and voice network transformation project, under way since 2004, of the UK telecommunications company BT Group plc. It was intended to move BT's telephone network from the AXE/System X Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) to an Internet Protocol (IP) system. As well as switching over the PSTN, BT planned to deliver many additional services over their new data network, such as on-demand interactive TV services.\n\nBT originally stated that it would accrue annual savings of £1 billion when the transition to the new network was completed, and hoped to have over 50% of its customers transferred by 2008 (see \"External links\" below for current progress on the roll-out of optical fibre by Openreach). Capital expenditure was put at £10 billion over five years, this being 75% of BT's total capital spending plans in that period.\n\nThe new network is based on an architectural model of five classes of network nodes. These are:\n\nPremises nodes includes residential, small-medium enterprise (SME) and enterprise. The presumption is that all these will have high speed connections to the network, delivered over copper (in the form of ADSL or other DSL technologies) or over fibre, as either PON or direct fibre in the case of large enterprises. The sole exception to this presumption is for legacy PSTN, where provision will continue to be made for analogue voice.\n\n21CN introduced the concept of the \"multi-service access node\" (MSAN). This logical node takes the various access technologies (mentioned above) and, where possible, aggregates these onto a single backhaul network technology. This includes converting analogue voice into \"voice over IP\" (VoIP) using the MSAN as a media gateway (MGW). The aim is to implement a few hundred access nodes. Note that these will not have any IP routing capability, but will essentially be layer 2 Ethernet devices.\n\nThe backhaul network will terminate on the metro nodes. At this point the IP-based services will be implemented, and the metro nodes are the first location where IP traffic is routed. Call control (via a softswitch or an IMS CSCF) will be implemented here, although the softswitches and the IMS components won't be described as a part of the metro node – they are parts of the iNode. The metro nodes are also \"provider edge\" (PE) routers in MPLS terminology, encapsulating the IP traffic in MPLS tunnels for transmission over the core. The aim is to implement around 100 metro nodes.\n\nThe core nodes are MPLS switches, with the MPLS traffic carried over optical (DWDM) transport. They are completely unaware of customer IP traffic, and only switch based on MPLS tags (all customer IP traffic is encapsulated with an MPLS header by the metro node PEs). Native IP is only used by the core nodes for protocols such as MP-BGP, an IGP, LDP, and RSVP to exchange routing and label information between all core and metro nodes. The aim is to have approximately 10 core nodes.\n\niNodes are the logical nodes that provide the control for the services implemented using the other four types of node. BT has announced that it intends to create an IMS based iNode capability, although its initial PSTN replacement will not be an IMS implementation. The iNode will implement a set of standardized functions – common capabilities – that deliver layered services. Common capabilities include session management, authentication, profile, address book, presence and location. Combinations of these capability primitives will be used to deliver different service types and functionality.\n\nThe iNode is built upon the AXE telephone exchange TSS (Telephony Softswitch Server) and is currently using HP Alpha processors (APZ 212 50) as well as the IS-Blade in the APZ logic. After extensive field testing in the South Wales Pathfinder area, all current logical and intelligent network services now operate in conjunction with the existing PSTN and the MPLS network.\n\nThe most significant differences between the legacy 20th century network (20CN) and 21CN are:\n\nAny chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and in the case of 21CN, its weakest link – the access network – is also its most valuable. Although the architecture of 21CN simplifies the network plant, it does not look to solve the problem which will have the greatest effect on data rate, that is loop length i.e. the length of cable from the exchange to the customer. Unlike the active core network, the access network is a passive network and has no capability for self-discovery. Reasonable consumer expectations can be established based upon the length and characteristics of these wires. A more global model would require precise knowledge of wire material (e.g. copper or aluminium), where the wires are routed, and the direction in which traffic flows around the circuit. This information is not held at present, and would need significant effort to obtain.\n\nBy moving the MSANs deeper into the network, i.e. to street side cabinets, length issues are more likely to be reduced; however, line transmission characteristics are still highly variable since lines may be bridged with materials other than copper (such as aluminium) which have a degrading effect on conductivity and hence signal strength. In addition changes in wire gauge (thickness) are common and introduce signal reflection due to changes in impedance.\n\nThe original 21CN design did not look to drive MSANs deeper into the network; instead it locates them in each exchange. Without detailed information on the critical local routings, it is difficult to ascertain what capacity remains in the duct network and which connections run through it. This makes planning of future upgrades or fibre additions difficult. Openreach considered integrating MSANs into the access network, although this was originally deemed unlikely to happen because there are only 5,600 exchange buildings and over 85,000 'primary connection points', usually in the form of street cabinets.\n\nHowever, in July 2007, Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of BT, stated that BT was considering fibre to the kerb and that VDSL2 was a 'likely development going forward'. In October 2007, Ofcom launched a consultation into Next Generation Access Networks in the UK after pressure from the government.\n\nSubsequently, Openreach began a rollout of VDSL2 FTTC technology over 21CN, deploying DSLAMs in thousands of new street-side cabinets. BT Retail launched their BT Infinity service in 2010 and expected to continue expanding availability by installing new cabinets until at least 2014. The FTTC deployment essentially installs a small (96-288 line) DSLAM into thousands of street cabinets, each backhauled using direct fibre to a larger exchange or metro node, removing much of the local-loop length limitations and allowing end-user speeds exceeding 100 Mbit/s following future upgrades.\n\nIn April 2005, BT announced that it had selected eight suppliers for its 21CN roll-out. These were:\n\nAlcatel and Lucent merged in December 2006 to form Alcatel-Lucent.\n\nThe fact that Britain's Marconi received no major 21CN contract was a surprise to commentators and sent the company's shares tumbling. An example of analysis before BT's announcement is Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein's: \"[Marconi is] so advanced with its products and so entrenched with BT Group plc that its selection looks certain.\"\n\nBT's plans for broadband internet access services were criticised. BT's main plan for providing Internet access was to upgrade their DSLAMs to ADSL2+ in the exchange. This was controversial because ADSL2+ was already an old technology and is limited to 24Mbit/s downstream, and would be even more dated by the time 21CN is completed. This led to criticisms that BT was not future proofing their network, since fibre, while more expensive to lay, is a lot more future-proof. Critics argue that fibre to the home would be more appropriate, which would mean replacing the current copper wire which supplies individual homes (the \"last mile\").\n\nIn late 2009, British ISP Andrews & Arnold reported severe issues with 21CN, citing multi-hour outages due to single points of failure and said that 21CN was not \"fit for purpose\" due to this and numerous other problems.\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 16, 1993. In the episode, Springfield legalizes gambling to revitalize its economy. Mr. Burns opens a casino where Homer is hired as a blackjack dealer. Marge develops a gambling addiction, Bart opens a casino in his treehouse, and Burns' appearance and mental state deteriorate in a parody of Howard Hughes.\n\nThe episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer. Gerry Cooney and Robert Goulet guest starred as themselves. The episode features cultural references to the films \"\", \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Rain Man\", and \"\". Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 11.7, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.\n\nAt a town hall, Mayor Quimby fields suggestions on ways to improve Springfield's dwindling economy. Principal Skinner suggests the town legalize gambling to rejuvenate its economy; everyone, including frequent naysayer Marge, likes the idea. Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a casino, where Homer is hired as a blackjack dealer. Burns designs the casino himself, with his likeness atop a mermaid's body adorning its neon sign.\n\nWhile waiting for Homer's shift to end, Marge finds a quarter on the casino floor and uses it to play a slot machine. When she wins, she immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Bart is too young to gamble at Burns' Casino, so he starts his own casino in his tree house, tricking Robert Goulet into performing there. Burns grows even richer from his casino, but his appearance and mental state deteriorate, making him resemble Howard Hughes. He develops paranoia and a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinating in jars and wearing tissue boxes instead of shoes on his feet.\n\nMarge spends all her time at the casino and neglects her family. She fails to notice when Maggie crawls away from the slots and is nearly mauled by a white tiger from Gunter and Ernst's circus act. She forgets to help Lisa make a costume for her geography pageant, forcing her to wear one poorly designed by her father. Homer bursts into the casino searching for Marge. Security cameras capture his rampage, causing Burns to demote him to his old job at the power plant. After realizing how much he misses the plant, Burns decides to return to it. When Homer confronts Marge with her behavior, she realizes that she has a gambling problem. \n\nLisa wins a special prize in the geography pageant because Homer's poor costume design makes the judges think she did it all by herself. Ralph receives the same prize for his primitive costume: a note taped to his shirt that reads \"Idaho\".\n\nThe episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer. The story of the episode originated from a newspaper article that Oakley and Weinstein found about a town in Mississippi that was introducing riverboat gambling. Oakley said another inspiration for it was that there had not been many episodes about Springfield as a whole and how \"crummy\" the town was, so they filled the whole first act with scenes showing how \"crummy\" and \"dismal\" Springfield was. Oakley particularly liked the animation of the lights inside the casino on the slot machines and the lamps in the ceiling. The \"way they radiate out\" had always amazed him. Archer, who directed the animation of the episode, also thought they turned out well. The lights were especially hard for them to animate back then because the show was animated traditionally on cels, so Archer was pleased with the results. A deleted scene from the episode shows Homer dealing cards to James Bond. The staff liked the scene, so they decided to put it in the clip show episode \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\".\n\nThere was a brief period when the episode had a different subplot that revolved around the restaurant chain Planet Hollywood. Groening had been told by a spokesperson that if he put Planet Hollywood in \"The Simpsons\", the creators of the restaurant, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Sylvester Stallone, would agree to make guest appearances on the show. The writers of \"The Simpsons\" were excited about this so they wrote a new subplot for the episode that featured Planet Hollywood and the three actors. However, for unknown reasons, they were unable to appear in the episode.\nInstead, Gerry Cooney and Robert Goulet guest starred as themselves. Executive producer David Mirkin enjoyed directing Goulet because he was \"such a good sport\" and had \"a great sense of humor\". Oakley thought it was nice that Goulet was willing to make fun of himself in the episode, which at the time was rare for guest stars on \"The Simpsons\". This episode features the first appearances of Gunter and Ernst, the Siegfried and Roy-esque casino magicians who are attacked by their white tiger, Anastasia. Ten years after this episode first aired, Roy Horn was attacked by one of the duo's white tigers. \"The Simpsons\" production team dismissed the novelty of the prediction by saying that it was \"bound to happen\" sooner or later. The Rich Texan also makes his debut appearance in this episode, referred to as \"Senator\" by Homer.\n\nThe title is a reference to the 1964 film \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\", the music of which was composed by Laurie Johnson. Two of his songs, \"Happy-go-lively\" and \"Rue de la park\" can be heard within the News on Parade segment at the beginning of the episode. Burns' bed looks similar to the one occupied by Keir Dullea's character Dave Bowman in the end of the 1968 film, \"\". Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise appear at the casino to reprise their roles from the 1988 film \"Rain Man\". Homer is impressed by the card-counting abilities of a man who resembles Raymond Babbitt, Hoffman's character in the film. Krusty's show at midnight is similar to Bill Cosby's 1971 album \"For Adults Only\", which was recorded at a casino at midnight. Marge reminds Homer that his lifelong dream was to be a contestant on the television show \"The Gong Show\".\n\nBurns's paranoid obsession with germs and cleanliness, and his refusal to leave his bedroom once the casino opens, parodies American magnate Howard Hughes, who had obsessive-compulsive disorder, and was involved in the casino business in his later years. The \"Spruce Moose\", an absurdly tiny wooden plane Burns makes in the episode, is a parody of Hughes' impractically enormous wooden plane, derisively nicknamed the \"Spruce Goose\". Homer parodies the scene in the 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\" when the Scarecrow demonstrates his newly acquired intelligence by (incorrectly) reciting the law that governs the lengths of the sides of an isosceles triangle. Unlike in the film, somebody correctly points out that the Pythagorean theorem recited applies only to right triangles, not isosceles triangles.\n\nIn its original American broadcast, \"$pringfield\" finished 35th in the ratings for the week of December 13 to December 19, 1993, with a Nielsen Rating of 11.7, translating to 11 million households. The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.\n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that \"this excellent episode includes a surprising number of concurrent plots. Homer also works in the casino and tries to care for the family without Marge. It balances them deftly and provides great laughs along the way.\" Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it the third best episode of the season. He also praised the episode's cultural references. The authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: \"There's a lovely nod to the earlier episodes in which Marge protests the citizenry's hare-brained ideas at council meetings. A series of bizarre moments rather than a story—we're especially fond of Homer's photographic memory and Mr Burns' descent into insanity—but great fun.\" Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A, and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave it a score of 4 out of 5. The episode is Sarah Culp of \"The Quindecim\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s eleventh-favorite episode of the show, and one of Les Winan of Box Office Prophets's favorite episodes. A scene from the episode where former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger meets Burns was included in the 2002 documentary film \"The Trials of Henry Kissinger\".\n\n"}

In 1930, he declared himself the rightful heir to the crown as pretender to the throne. He died on 7 January 1943 in Maidenhead, England and was buried in Kerbala, Iraq.\n\nEven before the dethronement of his brother Ahmad Shah Qajar by Reza Shah, he was still a inconsequential figure in Iranian politics. This was not from a lack of trying however; in early march of 1921, the Mohammad Hassan Mirza approached the British legation with proposals to supplant his brother, the king of Iran at the time. The High Commissioner's office in Baghdad informed Herman Norman in a telegram that Zia'eddin Tabatabaee informed them that Mohammad Hassan Mirza was \"very dissatisfied with the shah and fears for safety of Persia from the Bolsheviks...\", and that \"he [Mohammad Hassan Mirza] is prepared to form new government as he considers the Shah useless...\". Mohammad Hassan Mirza proposals were ignored, except by Percy Cox who was the former attache of Britain in Iran. Herman Norman who was current British diplomat to Iran thought of the dethronement of Ahmad Shah Qajar by his brother as a tactical mistake which would divide Persia; \"\"[I am prevented] from encouraging any movement which has for its object dethronement of His Majesty.

The film was scored, produced and co-written (with director William Dear) by Michael Nesmith.\n\nLyle Swann is a well-known dirt bike motorcycle racer who is in the desert competing in the Baja 1000, a multiclass vehicle cross-country race. Swann has a reputation for being a great rider but is plagued by technical problems from the high-tech gadgetry he incorporates into his C and J framed XT500 Yamaha. When Swann accidentally goes far off course, he stumbles across a time travel experiment that utilizes \"maser velocity acceleration\" to send objects (in this case, a simian subject by the name of Esther G.) back in time.\n\nSwann rides through the field and gets sent back to November 5, 1877. The scientists in charge of the experiment soon realize what has happened, but Swann rides off, unaware of what has happened to him, before he can be returned to the present. While taking a swim break in a local pond, he runs into a gang of outlaws led by Porter Reese, who becomes obsessed with stealing Swann's motorcycle, and the outlaws pursue Swann into the small village of San Marcos, but his red suit and dirtbike scare the local Mexicans, who think he is 'El Diablo' (Spanish for 'The Devil'). \n\nThere, he meets a beautiful woman, Claire Cygne, who gives him a safe place to hide, and who severely wounds one of Reese's men Carl Dorsett. The village priest compels them to withdraw, but Reese continues to plot the capture of Swann's dirtbike. In the village, Swann is seduced by Claire and sleeps with her, but she is later kidnapped by Reese's henchman Claude Dorsett as revenge for her shooting and wounding his brother Carl. \n\nThey also manage to capture the dirtbike, leading to a series of hijinks, while Swann gets help from a posse of two U.S. Marshals, Ben Potter and Daniels, who are trying to capture or kill the gang. Potter has a personal vendetta against Reese, for Reese killed Potter's son two years previously. Swann manages to retrieve his dirtbike and rescue Claire. Potter is killed by Reese in an ambush, and Daniels is mortally wounded and dies later.\n\nIn a final showdown, Reese's band of outlaws faces Swann, the last survivor of the posse, and Claire atop a plateau. When a helicopter shows up (sent by the builders of the time travel experiment to take Swann home), Reese's men run away in fear, but Reese stays behind and fires at the helicopter, killing or wounding one of the pilots. The helicopter begins spinning wildly as the co-pilot tries to maintain control, knocking the dirtbike off the side of the plateau. Reese is killed by the helicopter's tail rotor. The helicopter manages to land on the plateau and extract Swann. \n\nJust as the helicopter pulls away, Claire snatches a pendant from Swann's neck that was handed down from his great-great-grandmother, who had stolen it from his great-great grandfather as a reminder of \"one incredible night they had together.\" Swann realizes that he is his own great-great-grandfather.\n\n\nThe off-screen dialogue (narrated by Macon McCalman) heard over the opening credits explains the time travel experiment as having the goal of sending a rhesus monkey to the year 1862 (according to the inscription on the canister containing the monkey which Swann reads aloud, the experiment begins on November 4, 1982). After Swann stumbles into the experiment, the scientists in charge of the experiment determine that Swann and the monkey were sent to about \"1875,\" then later pinpoint the date as being November 5, 1877. The screenplay's \"time travel arrival day\" of November 5 had first appeared in 1979's \"Time After Time;\" and was also the \"time travel arrival day\" in a later film, 1985's \"Back to the Future.\" As another plot clue, Claire's last name, Cygne, is the vocative singular form of \"cygnus,\" Latin for \"swan.\"\n\nIn addition to the grandfather paradox and the predestination paradox presented in the film, the necklace that Claire takes from Lyle presents an ontological paradox (i.e., an object with no creation point and continually in the time-loop), similar to the pocket watch in the 1980 time-travel film \"Somewhere in Time\". These paradoxes were highlighted in the 2004 \"South Park\" episode \"Goobacks,\" where various time-traveling techniques in movies are compared.\n\nThe film's screenplay was written by Michael Nesmith, a member of the band The Monkees. The movie is produced by Zoomo Production, which is a subsidiary of Michael Nesmith's Pacific Arts Corporation. The movie was also released by Pacific Arts Video, another entity of Nesmith's, who appears briefly as one of the Baja 1000 officials in the beginning of the film.\n\nTwo brief scenes were cut from the above theatrical version for the 2001 Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release:\n\n\nShout! Factory released the film on Blu-ray on March 19, 2013. It has since gone out-of-print.\n\nUpon its theatrical release, Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" commented, \"At the point at which I walked out, about 55 minutes into the story, there hadn't been a single characterization, situation, line of dialogue, camera angle or joke to indicate that anyone connected with \"Timerider\" had the remotest idea of what he was doing.\"\n\nContemporary critics reviewed the film upon its 2001 DVD release:\n\nPatrick Naugle of \"DVD Verdict\" said, \"\"Timerider\" starts off a bit slow. It seems as if the first twenty minutes are taken up watching Swann ride his bike all over the dry desert plains. After that sluggish beginning, Timerider kicks into a funny and enjoyable fish-out-of-water story.\"\n\nNesmith also produced, wrote, and recorded the . Eighteen years after the soundtrack was recorded, it was finally released by Videoranch (the official website and another subsidiary of Nesmith's Pacific Arts).\n\n"}

His mother Sönam Tso was a daughter of Gerab Nyerchen Göntse of the Sogmotsang family, from a Mongol background.\n\nAt twelve, he was recognized by Thartse Khenchen Jampa Kunga Tendzin as the incarnation of Jampa Namkha Chimé, and was given the name Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo Kunga Tenpé Gyaltsen Palzangpo. At twenty-one, he received full ordination from Minling Khenchen Rigdzin Zangpo at Mindrolling Monastery. In all, he had more than one hundred and fifty teachers, who were masters from all four major Tibetan Buddhist schools from the regions of Ü and Tsang as well as Kham, including Minling Trichen Gyurme Sangye Kunga, Shechen Gyurme Thutob Namgyal, Sakyapa Dorje Rinchen and the khenpo brothers of Thartse, Ngorpa Thartsé Khenpo Jampa Kunga Tendzin (1776–1862) and Thartsé Pönlop Naljor Jampal Zangpo (b. 1789).\n\nIn time, his fame spread throughout Tibet and he became known by the name of Pema Ösel Dongak Lingpa, and renowned as a holder of the seven special transmissions (ka bab dün).\n\nHis many disciples included Jamgön Kongtrul, Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso, Dodrupchen Jikmé Tenpé Nyima, Orgyen Chokgyur Lingpa, Tertön Sogyal, Ayu Khandro and many other masters of the Nyingma school; the Sakya Trizin Tashi Rinchen, the fourth Zimwock Rinpoche of Nalendra Monastery, many of the khenpos of Ngor and many other masters of the Sakya tradition; the fourteenth and fifteenth Karmapas, the tenth and eleventh Tai Situpas, Taklungma Rinpoche and other holders of the Kagyü teachings; Könchok Tenpa Rabgyé, the Nomihan of Drakyab, Lithang Khenchen Jampa Phuntsok, Horkhang Sar Gyalwa and other geshes of the Gelug tradition, and also followers of the Bon tradition.\n\nSeveral tulkus of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, including those of body \"(sku)\", speech \"(gsung)\", mind \"(thugs)\", qualities \"(yon tan)\" and activity \"()\", were recognized in Tibet. Of these, the body incarnation was Dzongsar Khyentse Jamyang Chökyi Wangpo, who was enthroned at Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo's main seat at Dzongsar Monastery but died in an accident c. 1909. The activity incarnation Dzongsar Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö, who was originally enthroned at Katok Monastery succeeded him. The speech incarnation was the Second Beru Khyentse and the mind incarnation Dilgo Khyentse. Since the early 1960s, Dilgo Khyentse, single-handedly upholding the unique tradition of Khyentse incarnations, propagated Buddhism tirelessly in India, Bhutan, Nepal, Tibet, and the West\n\nList of the immediate emanations of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo:\n\n\nAlternate names by which Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo was known include: \"Dorje Zijitsal; Jigme Khyentse Nyugu; Khyentse Wangpo; Kunga Tenpai Gyeltsen Pelzangpo; Osel Dorje Tukchoktsal; Osel Tulpai Dorje; Pema Osel Do-ngag Linpa; Tsangse Gyepai Loden; Tsokye Lama Gyepaibang; Tsuglamawai Nyima Tsokye Shonnui Langtso.\"\n\n\n"}

As a junior in 1955, he led the team in rushing, punt returns, kickoff returns, pass interceptions and pass receptions, setting the ACC record in pass receptions (31) and yards out of the backfield (349). After the 1955 football season ended, he joined the baseball team at third base where he hit .319, led the league in stolen bases (17) and helped Wake Forest win the 1955 National Baseball Championship.\n\nIn 1956, Barnes became the first player in the ACC to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a single season when he rushed for 1,010 yards. He was the second leading rusher in the nation, an All-American and 1956 ACC Player of the Year. In 2009, he was inducted into the ACC Football Championship Game Legends Class.\n\nBarnes was drafted in the second round of the 1957 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. He made the Pro Bowl his first three years in the league (1957–1959) and was a key member of the backfield during the Eagles' 1960 NFL Championship team. During the title game against the Green Bay Packers, Barnes ran the ball 13 times for 42 yards. He had a nine-yard run and key 13-yard pass reception on the game-winning drive, and blocked Packer defensive end Bill Quinlan that helped Ted Dean to score the winning touchdown.\n\nFollowing the 1961 season, Barnes was traded to the Washington Redskins for center Jim Schrader. He had two good seasons with the Redskins, leading the team in rushing in 1962. Barnes was cut by the Redskins before the start of the 1963 season because of an injury he sustained during the pre-season.\n\nIn 1965, Barnes returned to the Eagles as a free agent, but was traded to the Minnesota Vikings for a draft choice before the season began. Barnes retired following the 1966 season, and became head coach of the Continental Football League's Charleston Rockets in 1968. He eventually became an assistant coach in the NFL, and served as Norm Van Brocklin's backfield coach for the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nBarnes was inducted into the Wake Forest University Hall of Fame in 1975 and the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 1979.\n"}

Most contemporary theories of technology reject two previous views: the linear model of technological innovation and technological determinism. To challenge the linear model, today's theories of technology point to the historical evidence that technological innovation often gives rise to new scientific fields, and emphasizes the important role that social networks and cultural values play in shaping technological artifacts. To challenge technological determinism, today's theories of technology emphasize the scope of technical choice, which is greater than most laypeople realize; as science and technology scholars like to say, \"It could have been different.\" For this reason, theorists who take these positions typically argue for greater public involvement in technological decision-making.It also refers to a company name which usually provides the tech related content to the user\n\n'Social' theories focus on how humans and technology affect each other. Some theories focus on how decisions are made with humans and technology: humans and technology are equal in the decision, humans drive technology, and vice versa. The interactions used in a majority of the theories on this page look at individual human's interactions with technology, but there is a sub-group for the group of people interacting with technology. The theories described are purposefully vague and ambiguous, since the circumstances for the theories change as human culture and technology innovations change.\n\n\n\nCritical theory goes beyond a descriptive account of how things are, to examine why they have come to be that way, and how they might otherwise be. Critical theory asks whose interests are being served by the status quo and assesses the potential of future alternatives to better serve social justice. According to Geuss's definition, \"a critical theory, then, is a reflective theory which gives agents a kind of knowledge inherently productive of enlightenment and emancipation' (1964). Marcuse argued that whilst matters of technology design are often presented as neutral technical choices, in fact, they manifest political or moral values. Critical theory is a form of archaeology that attempt to get beneath common-sense understandings in order to reveal the power relationships and interests determining particular technological configuration and use. \nPerhaps the most developed contemporary critical theory of technology is contained in the works of Andrew Feenberg including 'Transforming Technology' (2002).\n\n\nThere are also a number of technology related theories that address how (media) technology affects group processes. Broadly, these theories are concerned with the social effects of communication media. Some (e.g., media richness) are concerned with questions of media choice (i.e., when to use what medium effectively). Other theories (social presence, SIDE, media naturalness) are concerned with the consequences of those media choices (i.e., what are the social effects of using particular communication media).\n\n\nAdditionally, many authors have posed technology so as to critique and or emphasize aspects of technology as addressed by the mainline theories. For example, Steve Woolgar (1991) considers \"technology as text\" in order to critique the sociology of scientific knowledge as applied to technology and to distinguish between three responses to that notion: the instrumental response (interpretive flexibility), the interpretivist response (environmental/organizational influences), the reflexive response (a double hermeneutic). Pfaffenberger (1992) treats \"technology as drama\" to argue that a recursive structuring of technological artifacts and their social structure discursively regulate the technological construction of political power. A technological drama is a discourse of technological \"statements\" and \"counterstatements\" within the processes of technological regularization, adjustment, and reconstitution.\n\nAn important philosophical approach to technology has been taken by Bernard Stiegler, whose work has been influenced by other philosophers and historians of technology including Gilbert Simondon and André Leroi-Gourhan.\nIn the Schumpeterian and Neo-Schumpeterian theories technologies are critical factors of economic growth (Carlota Perez).\n\nFinally, there are theories of technology which are not defined or claimed by a proponent, but are used by authors in describing existing literature, in contrast to their own or as a review of the field.\n\nFor example, Markus and Robey (1988) propose a general technology theory consisting of the causal structures of agency (technological, organizational, imperative, emergent), its structure (variance, process), and the level (micro, macro) of analysis.\n\nOrlikowski (1992) notes that previous conceptualizations of technology typically differ over scope (is technology more than hardware?) and role (is it an external objective force, the interpreted human action, or an impact moderated by humans?) and identifies three models:\n\nDeSanctis and Poole (1994) similarly write of three views of technology's effects: \n\nBimber (1998) addresses the determinacy of technology effects by distinguishing between the:\n\n"}

It consists of a board of polystyrene foam clad with an outer facing of paper on either side, typically white clay-coated paper or brown kraft paper.\n\nThe original white foamcore board was made in thicknesses for the graphic arts industry by Monsanto Company under the trade name \"Fome-Cor®\" starting in 1957.\n\nThe surface of the regular board, like many other types of paper, is slightly acidic. However, for modern archival picture framing and art mounting purposes it can be produced in a neutral, acid-free version with a buffered surface paper, in a wide range of sizes and thicknesses.\n\nFoam-cored materials are also now available with a cladding of solid (non-foamed) polystyrene and other rigid plastic sheeting, some with a textured finish.\n\nFoamcore does not adhere well to some glues, such as superglue, and certain types of paint. The foam tends to melt away and dissolve. Some glue works well in casual settings, however, the water in the glue can warp the fibers in the outer layers. Best results are typically obtained from higher-end spray adhesives. A hot glue gun can be used as a substitute, although the high viscosity of hot glues can affect finished projects in the form of board warping, bubbles, or other unsightly blemishes.\n\nSelf-adhesive foam boards, intended for art and document mounting are also available, though these can be very tricky to use properly; this is because the glue sets very fast. It is considered cheaper to buy plain foam board and use re-positionable spray mount adhesive.\n\nFoamcore is commonly used to produce architectural models, prototype small objects and to produce patterns for casting. Scenery for scale model displays, dioramas, and computer games are often produced by hobbyists from foamcore.\nFoamcore is also often used by photographers as a reflector to bounce light, in the design industry to mount presentations of new products, and in picture framing as a backing material; the latter use includes some archival picture framing methods, which utilize the acid-free versions of the material.

Egypt was already ancient to outsiders, and the idea of Egypt has continued to be at least as influential in the history of ideas as the actual historical Egypt itself. All Egyptian culture was transmitted to Roman and post-Roman European culture through the lens of Hellenistic conceptions of it, until the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics by Jean-François Champollion in the 1820s rendered Egyptian texts legible, finally enabling an understanding of Egypt as the Egyptians themselves understood it.\n\nAfter Late Antiquity, the Old Testament image of Egypt as the land of enslavement for the Hebrews predominated, and \"Pharaoh\" became a synonym for despotism and oppression in the 19th century. However, Enlightenment thinking and colonialist explorations in the late 18th century renewed interest in ancient Egypt as both a model for, and an exotic alternative to, Western culture, particularly as a Romantic source for classicizing architecture.\n\nHerodotus, in his \"Histories\", Book II, gives a detailed if selectively coloured and imaginative description of ancient Egypt. He praises peasants' preservation of history through oral tradition, and Egyptians' piety. He lists the many animals to which Egypt is home, including the mythical phoenix and winged serpent, and gives inaccurate descriptions of the hippopotamus and horned viper. Herodotus was quite critical about the stories he heard from the priests (II,123), but Diodorus Siculus, who visited Hellenistic Egypt in the 1st century BCE, gave credit to what he was told by priests: that many famous Greek philosophers had studied in Egypt. Both Plutarch and Diogenes Laërtius (3rd century) mention that Thales studied in Egypt, while nothing is really known about Thales from his own time. Iamblichus of Chalcis in the 3rd century CE reports that Pythagoras studied in Egypt for 22 years.\n\nFrom the classical texts that thus evolved, a mythical Egypt emerges as the mother-country of Religion, Wisdom, Philosophy, and Science.\n\nAmong the Romans, an Egypt that had been drawn into the Roman economic and political sphere was still a source of wonders: \"\"; the exotic fauna of the Nile is embodied in the famous \"Nilotic\" mosaic from Praeneste, and Romanized iconographies were developed for the \"Alexandrian Triad\", Isis, who developed a widespread Roman following, Harpocrates, \"god of silence\", and the Ptolemaic syncretism of Serapis.\n\nEgypt is mentioned 611 times in the Bible, between and . The Septuagint, through which most Christians knew the Hebrew Bible, was commissioned in Alexandria, it was remembered, with the embellishment that though the seventy scholars set to work upon the texts independently, miraculously each arrived at the same translation.\nFollowing the 7th-century Muslim conquest of Egypt, the West lost direct contact with Egypt and its culture. In Medieval Europe, Egypt was depicted primarily in the illustration and interpretation of the biblical accounts. These illustrations were often quite fanciful, as the iconography and style of ancient Egyptian art, architecture and costume were largely unknown in the West (\"illustration, right\"). Dramatic settings of the Finding of Moses, the Plagues of Egypt, the Parting of the Red Sea and the story of Joseph in Egypt, and from the New Testament the Flight into Egypt often figured in medieval illuminated manuscripts. Biblical hermeneutics were primarily theological in nature, and had little to do with historical investigations. Throughout the Middle Ages \"Mummia\", made, if it were genuine, by pounding mummified bodies, was a standard product of apothecary shops.\n\nDuring the Renaissance the German Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher gave an allegorical \"decipherment\" of hieroglyphs through which Egypt was thought of as a source of ancient mystic or occult wisdom. In alchemist circles, the prestige of \"Egyptians\" rose. A few scholars, however, remained skeptic: in the 16th century, Isaac Casaubon determined that the \"Corpus Hermeticum\" of the great Hermes Trismegistus was actually a Greek work of about the 4th century CE (even though Casaubon's work was also criticized by Ralph Cudworth).\n\nEarly in the 18th century, Jean Terrasson had written \"Life of Sethos\", a work of fiction, which launched the notion of Egyptian mysteries. In an atmosphere of antiquarian interest, a sense arose that ancient knowledge was somehow embodied in Egyptian monuments and lore. Following the Rosicrucian example, an Egyptian imagery pervaded the European Freemasonry of the time and its imagery, such as the eye on the pyramid — still depicted on the Great Seal of the United States (1782), which appears on the United States one-dollar bill — and the Egyptian references in Mozart's Masonic-themed \"Die Zauberflöte\" (The Magic Flute, 1791), and his earlier unfinished \"Thamos\".\n\nThe revival of curiosity about the Antique world, seen through written documents, spurred the publication of a collection of Greek texts that had been assembled in Late Antiquity, which were published as the corpus of works of Hermes Trismegistus. But the broken ruins that sometimes appeared in paintings of the episode of the Rest on the Flight into Egypt were always of Roman character.\n\nWith historicism came the first fictions set in the Egypt of the imagination. Shakespeare's \"Antony and Cleopatra\" had been set partly in Alexandria, but its protagonists were noble and universal, and Shakespeare had not been concerned to evoke local color.\n\nThe rationale for \"Egyptomania\" rests on a similar concept: Westerners looked to ancient Egyptian motifs because ancient Egypt itself was intrinsically so alluring. The Egyptians used to consider their religion and their government somewhat eternal; they were supported in this thought by the enduring aspect of great public monuments which lasted forever and which appeared to resist the effects of time. Their legislators had judged that this moral impression would contribute to the stability of their empire.\nThe culture of Romanticism embraced every exotic locale, and its rise in the popular imagination coincided with Napoleon's failed Egyptian campaign and the start of modern Egyptology, beginning very much as a competitive enterprise between Britain and France. A modern \"Battle of the Nile\" could hardly fail to stir renewed curiosity about Egypt beyond the figure of Cleopatra. At about the same moment, the tarot was brought to Europe's attention by the Frenchman Antoine Court de Gebelin as a purported key to the occult knowledge of Egypt. All this gave rise to \"Egyptomania\" and occult tarot.\n\nThis legendary Egypt has been difficult, but not impossible to concile with the 1824 decryption of hieroglyphs by Jean-François Champollion. Inscriptions that a century earlier had been thought to hold occult wisdom, proved to be nothing more than royal names and titles, funerary formulae, boastful accounts of military campaigns, even though there remains an obscure part that might agree with the mystic vision. The explosion of new knowledge about actual Egyptian religion, wisdom and philosophy has been widely interpreted as exposing the mythical image of Egypt as an illusion that had been created by the Greek and Western imaginations.\n\nIn art the development of Orientalism, and the increased possibility of travel produced a large number of depictions, of varying degrees of accuracy. By the late 19th-century exotic and carefully studied or researched decor was often dominant in depictions of both landscape and human figures, whether ancient or modern. \nOn the most popular 19th-century level, all of ancient Egypt was reduced in the European imagination to the Nile, the Pyramids and the Great Sphinx in a setting of sand, characterized on a more literary level in the English poet Shelley's \"Ozymandias\" (1818):\n\nEgyptian Revival architecture extended the repertory of classical design explored by the Neoclassical movement and widened the decorative vocabulary that could be drawn upon.\n\nThe well-known Egyptian cult of the dead inspired the Egyptian Revival themes first employed in Highgate Cemetery, near London, which was opened in 1839 by a company founded by the designer-entrepreneur Stephen Geary (1797–1854); its architectural features, which included a 'Gothic Catacomb' as well as an 'Egyptian Avenue', were brought to public attention once more by James Stevens Curl.\n\nAncient Egypt provided the setting for the Italian composer Verdi's stately 1871 opera \"Aida\", commissioned by the Europeanized Khedive for premiere in Cairo.\n\nIn 1895, the Polish writer Bolesław Prus completed his only historical novel, \"Pharaoh\", a study of mechanisms of political power, described against the backdrop of the fall of the Twentieth Dynasty and the New Kingdom. It is, at the same time, one of the most compelling literary reconstructions of life at every level of ancient Egyptian society. In 1966, the novel was adapted as a Polish feature film.\n\nIn 1912, the discovery of an exquisite painted limestone bust of Nefertiti, unearthed from its sculptor's workshop near the royal city of Amarna, added the first new celebrity of Egypt. The bust, now in Berlin's Egyptian Museum, became so famous through the medium of photography that it became the most familiar, most copied work of ancient Egyptian sculpture; Nefertiti's strong-featured profile was a notable influence on new ideals of feminine beauty in the 20th century.\nThe 1922 discovery of the undamaged tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun introduced a new celebrity to join Nefertiti — \"King Tut\". The tomb's spectacular treasures influenced Art-Deco design vocabulary. Also, for many years there persisted rumors, probably tabloid-inspired, of a \"curse\"; the rumors focused on the alleged premature deaths of some of those who had first entered the tomb. A recent study of journals and death records, however, indicates no statistical difference between the ages at death of those who had entered the tomb and of expedition members who had not; indeed, most of the individuals lived past age 70. The idea of a \"mummy's curse\" inspired films such as \"The Mummy\", starring Boris Karloff, which popularized the idea of ancient Egyptian mummies reanimating as monsters. Another literary occurrence at that time of Egypt is Agatha Christie's 1936 mystery novel \"Death on the Nile\".\n\nHollywood's depiction of ancient Egypt is a major contributor to the fantasy Egypt of modern culture. The cinematic spectacle of Egypt climaxed in sequences of Cecil B. deMille's \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956) and in Jeanne Crain's Nefertiti in the 1961 Italian Cinecittà production of \"Queen of the Nile\", and collapsed with the failure of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in \"Cleopatra\" (1963).\n\nIn 1978, Tutankhamun was commemorated in the whimsical song, \"King Tut\", by American comedian Steve Martin, and in 1986 the poses in some Egyptian mural art were evoked in the song \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" by The Bangles.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art resurrected the Temple of Dendur within its own quarters in 1978. In 1989, the Louvre raised its own glass pyramid, and in 1993 Las Vegas's Luxor Hotel opened with its replica tomb of Tutankhamun.\n\nA best-selling series of novels by French author and Egyptologist Christian Jacq was inspired by the life of Pharaoh Ramses II (\"the Great\").\n\nHBO's miniseries \"Rome\" features several episodes set in Greco-Roman Egypt. The faithful reconstructions of an \"ancient Egyptian\" court (as opposed to the historically correct \"Hellenistic\" culture) were built in Rome's Cinecittà studios. The series depicts dramatized accounts of the relations among Cleopatra, Ptolemy XIII, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. Cleopatra is played by Lyndsey Marshal, and much of the second season is dedicated to events building up to the famous suicides of Cleopatra and her lover Mark Antony in 30 BCE.\n\n\"La Reine Soleil\", a 2007 animated film by Philippe Leclerc, features Akhenaten, Tutankhaten (later Tutankhamun), Akhesa (Ankhesenepaten, later Ankhesenamun), Nefertiti, and Horemheb in a complex struggle pitting the priests of Amun against Akhenaten's intolerant monotheism.\n\nAmerican singer Katy Perry released in 2013 the song \"Dark Horse\" and the plot of the music video for the song was set it ancient Memphis. The video features numerous ancient Egyptian symbols and many of the things featured in it are historically accurate even though no egyptologists were consulted during its production. The turquoise makeup worn by Katy Perry in the video would have been used in Ancient Egypt, the dress she wore is similar in style to the Graeco-Roman clothes worn by nobles such as Cleopatra, the video features the Eye of Horus a powerful symbol in Ancient Egypt and the paintings behind the throne that Katy Perry sits on appear to have been made based on real examples from Ancient Egyptian tombs.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed\" launched in 2017 \"Assassin's Creed Origins\" and the plot of the game is set in Egypt during the Ptolemaic dynasty. The game follows Bayek, a medjay from the Siwa Oasis who is trying to revenge the death of his son. The depiction of Ancient Egypt in the game is really historically accurate and it offers a unique glimpse into the life of Egyptian people in 1st century AD. The buildings, landscapes, animals, even the language people are talking in were molded based on historical sources as many historians and egyptologists were consulted during the making of the game.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1831107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831107", "title": "War on I-4 (arena football)", "text": "War on I-4 (arena football)\n\nThe War on I–4 was a rivalry between the Tampa Bay Storm and the Orlando Predators in the Arena Football League. The teams met at least twice and up to four times a season starting in 1991, and both were consistently at the top of the league standings. The rivalry has been compared to the Yankees – Red Sox rivalry in Major League Baseball.\n\nAlthough the Tampa Bay and Orlando markets, separated by an 80-mile stretch of Interstate 4, have teams in each of the major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada, none of the Big Five leagues had a team in both cities. Orlando has the Magic of the NBA and Orlando City SC of MLS while Tampa Bay hosts the Rays in MLB, Buccaneers in the NFL and Lightning in the NHL. Despite each market being of relatively large size in its own respective right, few leagues (especially those that have had long histories) have attempted to place teams in both cities; this has created few opportunities for the two nearby cities to form rivalries. The Arena Football League was an aberration in this regard when it approved the Orlando Predators as an expansion team in 1991, then allowed for the Pittsburgh Gladiators, a charter AFL team, to relocate to the Tampa Bay area and become the Tampa Bay Storm. The Storm and Predators became instant rivals.\n\nThe games were played either at the teams' respective home arenas. At the time the series ended, these arenas were Amway Center for Orlando and Amalie Arena (previously known as the \"Ice Palace\", \"St. Pete Times Forum\", and \"Tampa Bay Times Forum\") for Tampa Bay. Games hosted by the Storm before the 1997 season were held at what is now Tropicana Field, but was known as \"Florida Suncoast Dome\" before 1994 and \"Thunderdome\" thereafter. Games hosted by the Predators until the end of the 2010 season were at Hummer Field at the Amway Arena (originally the \"Orlando Arena\", later \"TD Waterhouse Centre\"). For the 2014 season, the Predators played at CFE Arena on the campus of The University of Central Florida.\n\nThe Predators led the overall series 34–27 in regular season and playoff games combined. The sides met eight times in the AFL playoffs, with each team winning four times, twice being in the ArenaBowl, with each team winning once. Their final playoff meeting was on August 14, 2010 in the American Conference Championship game, in which Tampa Bay won 63–62 as a long field goal attempt by the Predators fell short as time expired.\n\nThe games between the teams were notable for featuring some of the highest attendances in AFL history. The ArenaBowl IX title match of September 1, 1995 drew an Arena Bowl record crowd of 25,087 to Thunderdome to see the Storm defeat the Predators by 48–35. Both teams were known to organize bus trips for supporters down Interstate 4 (hence the War on I-4) to the other city to see their squad play.\n\nThe series also had the top overall attendance record in league history when Orlando defeated Tampa Bay 46–45 in front of 28,745 at the Florida Suncoast Dome in week 6 of the 1993 AFL season.\n\nIn 2010, the rivalry resumed after a year off caused by the Arena Football League suspending operations in 2009. The rivalry ended when Orlando announced they would suspend operations following the conclusion of the 2016 season. Tampa Bay did the same following the 2017 season. The Predators were relaunched as an expansion team in the National Arena League prior to the 2019 season. The Arena Football League ceased operations after filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in late 2019.\nShortly after the Predators withdrew from the AFL, the University of South Florida, based in Tampa, and the University of Central Florida, based in Orlando, claimed the \"War on I-4\" name for their own sports rivalries.\nWinner in bold.\n"}

His family, Tabani, an industrial house has large business holdings in Pakistan.\n\nDuring his childhood Habib Wali Mohammad often listened to Qawwali music. But due to economic and business reasons, he gave priority to academics.\n\nHe received his MBA from Syracuse University, New York in 1947, and then lived in Mumbai for about 10 years before moving to Pakistan. His brother Ashraf W. Tabani was the governor of the province of Sindh, Pakistan around 1988. He died on 3 September 2014 in Los Angeles, USA. The Tabanis belong to the Gujarati-speaking Memon community.\n\nAs a youth, Habib Wali received classical music lessons from Ustad Latafat Hussain, nephew of Ustad Fayyaz Khan. In college, he became active in the musical functions of Ismail Yusuf College, gaining the nickname 'Taan Sen'. He completed his bachelor's degree in Bombay.\n\nIn 1941, Habib Wali was awarded first prize in a Bombay music competition with 1200 contestants, including the singer Mukesh Chand Mathur. His winning performance was singing the ghazal of the last Moghul Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar, \"Lagta Nahin Hai Jee Mera Ujray Diyar Mein\".\n\nEncouraged by this honour, at a young age, he took more interest in ghazal singing. During his stay in America, he had been out of touch with music. Hence, he felt lonely and missed his earlier college functions in Bombay. In his own words, \"He was not happy in ‘Ujray dayar mein’, the same ghazal which had won him an award of a lifetime. He put a lot of effort and came out with a gramophone record of ghazals in his voice. On one side of the record, he dubbed Bahadur Shah Zafar's ghazals and on the other side, Ghalib's ghazals.\n\nUnfortunately, the Indian public was reluctant to buy them.\n\nListening to these ghazals, actress Meena Kumari became a fan of his, and since she was at the time affiliated with Radio Ceylon, she had his recordings broadcast often. This boosted Habib Wali's sales and caused him to become a celebrity.\n\nAfter the independence of Pakistan in 1947, his family migrated to Pakistan and established an industrial group which includes the Shalimar Silk Mills. He gave most of his time to the family business, recording ghazals and geets for films in his spare time, however music was not pursued as a profession.\n\nHowever he still sang ghazals for the music companies.(including a geet written by Parveen Shakir: ‘Gori karath singhar’). In the eighties, he recorded ghazals on audio cassettes which were composed by the renowned music director Nisar Bazmi and the Pakistan Television, Karachi Center's music director \"Niaz Ahmed\". In addition, he received offers to become a film playback singer for the Pakistani film industry.\n\nHabib Wali Mohammad was from an early group of singers ever to record the ghazals. But probably because of his background and as a member of a well-established family, Habib Wali had never pursued an aggressive and mainstream career as a singer, though he was still highly regarded.\n\nHis famous ghazals include Bahadur Shah Zafar's 'Na kisi ki aankh ka noor hoon' and Qamar Jalalvi's 'Kab mera nasheman ahelay chaman'. All of his performances of the ghazals of Bahadur Shah Zafar have been very popular.\n\nHis other well known ghazals, include Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo. He also sang the famous national song, \"Roshan-o-Rakhshan, Nayyar-o-Tabaan, Pakistan rahay\".\n\nHabib Wali Mohammad lived in Los Angeles California, United States with his wife, Rehana and his family, including his sons, Rizwan Wali Mohammad Tabani and Nadeem Wali Mohammad Tabani. Both are ghazal and geet performers in their own right. Anwar Wali Muhammad Tabani lives in New Jersey and the daughter Rukhsana lives in Karachi, Pakistan.\n\nSome of the ghazals, recorded in the voice of Habib Wali Mohammad are listed here below:\n\n‘Ye na thi hamari Qismath’: poet: Mirza Ghalib\n\n‘Ja kahio unsay naseem-e-sahar’: poet: Bahadur Shah Zafar\n\n‘Gajra bana kay lay Aa malaniya’: poet: Afshan Rana\n\n\nNational songs like: ‘Roshan-o- rakhshan, nayyar-o-taban’, Aye nigar re watan tu salamat rahay, Sohni dharti Allah rakhe, Lahoo jo sarhad pe beh chuka hay, La fata illah ali la saif-o – illah zulfakar.\n\n\nHabib Wali Mohammad had a ghazal concert on 27 February 2010 in Edison, New Jersey, and on 28 February 2010 in West Virginia, performing with his son Nadeem Wali Mohammad, and former singer Bela Modi.\n\nHabib Wali Mohammad recently performed in April 2012 in San Jose California for the Human Development Foundation, a fund raising event.\n"}

On the lakeshore to the north of the building is the Terrace, a popular outdoor space overlooking Lake Mendota. It has gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful student centers on a university campus.\n\nThe exterior of the main wing was designed by University Architect Arthur Peabody. Opened October 5, 1928, the facility is operated by the Wisconsin Union, a membership organization. Porter Butts, the first director, called it a \"college union\" because it combines the characteristics of a student union (\"student activity center\" in other countries) and a student government (\"students' union\" in other countries) in an organization that brings together students, faculty, and members of the surrounding community.\n\nThe building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 19, 2015.\n\nOutside the main building is the Memorial Union Terrace, a stone outdoor dining and recreation area on the shore of Lake Mendota. The Terrace was designed by Peabody's daughter, Charlotte. It is a popular spot among students and local residents for socializing because of the backdrop of the lake, with its view of sailboats, and the sound of live music, usually free to the public in the evening. The Wisconsin Union Directorate funds music on the Terrace four nights a week in the summer, and on the Terrace or in der Rathskeller on weekends during the school year (depending on weather).\n\nWithin the Union are rooms and artworks reflecting the local heritage. The largest is \"Der Rathskeller\", a German-style beerhall with elaborate murals, where political debates and card or board games are common among students over a beer.

{"id": "1831116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831116", "title": "Mario Lozano", "text": "Mario Lozano\n\nMario Lozano is a United States Army specialist, best known for once being indicted by an Italian court for his role in the death of Italian Secret Service officer Nicola Calipari in a supposed incident on Route Irish, immediately following the Rescue of Giuliana Sgrena. Lozano was not the only American soldier involved in this incident, but received much more attention because he was the one who fired the machine gun killing Calipari. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion of the 69th Infantry Regiment, 42nd Infantry Division of the New York Army National Guard, based in Manhattan.\n\nIn 2007, a superior Italian court decided that Italy had no jurisdiction in this case—though renouved, this motivation has been since dubbed as foul by the High Jury Italian court in 2008.\n\nLozano is largely of Puerto Rican ancestry, although he has a paternal grandfather who was half Sicilian ancestry. He is a native of the Bronx borough of New York City, New York.\n\nLozano shot and killed Secret Service agent Nicola Calipari in Baghdad during a disputed incident at BP 541, a blocking position (a loose term indicating a mobile roadblock that allows no traffic to pass) located behind a ninety-degree turn on the ramp joining Route Vernon to Route Irish. (The road was between the heavily fortified Green Zone and Baghdad International Airport.) Calipari was returning from a successful rescue mission to liberate Giuliana Sgrena, an Italian independent journalist, detained by Iraqi insurgents. Both Sgrena and a colleague of Calipari, Andrea Carpani, were wounded in the shooting.\n\nLozano and members of his squad had been directed to set up the blocking position as part of security measures for Ambassador John Negroponte's convoy from the city to the airport. Although the ambassador's convoy had already passed twenty minutes earlier, a communications failure with the dispatching unit (which had just deployed to Iraq, and was on the job for the first time), meant that Lozano's squad had been in place for more than eighty minutes, sixty-five minutes over the customary length.\nAn internal U.S. Army investigation cleared Lozano of any wrongdoing and concluded that he acted within the standing rules of engagement. It was pointed out during the Army investigation that Calipari, who had previously been in contact with the United States Embassy in Baghdad and had previously been sharing information and working with US Coalition forces in order to free Sgrena, did not share information about the rescue attempt with the embassy. In addition, two members of Lozano's unit were killed two days previously in a car bombing very near to where the incident occurred. While 58 bullets were missing from his M-240B machine gun, forensic evidence showed that the vehicle had been struck only a total of 11 times by the 7.62mm bullets, and that 2 had entered through the windshield. Lozano told investigators that he had fired the remaining bullets while test-firing his weapon and while attempting to walk the bullets up to the speeding car to warn it of the impending danger from the blocking position.\n\nA related report and issued by Italian authorities, rather than accusing Lozano of being the sole culprit, pointed to the inappropriate placement of the blocking position (at the end of a one-way ramp between two highways) and lack of proper warning signals and/or concertina wire. The Italian report stated that because of the short span of visible road from the BP, Lozano, being in charge of both the searchlight used to warn incoming vehicles and of the machine gun, had only seconds to react, point the searchlight, warn the vehicle, assess it was not halting, man the weapon, aim, shoot warning shots, and then disabling shots.\n\nOn May 8, 2007, the Italian television channel Canale 5 broadcast a video of the first moments after the shooting. In this video, Calipari's car is seen stopped on the road after the shooting, with the door open, the lights switched on, and apparently more than 50 meters away from the US Army Armored Humvee. This video contradicts claims by the US that the car was traveling with its lights switched off and was fired upon by Lozano when it was less than 50 meters from his position.\n\nCalipari's death caused a major international incident, since Calipari, a highly decorated SISMI agent, had become a national hero in Italy. As a result, there was significant pressure on the Italian government to publicly support another investigation into the shooting, this time being conducted by Italian prosecutors.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi indicated in Parliament on May 5, 2005 that the government remained fully committed to supporting the ongoing judicial investigation into Calipari's death. One of the most prominent leaders of the opposition in the lower house of parliament, Piero Fassino, called for the United States to facilitate cooperation with the investigation, indicating that they believed the U.S. Army should produce Lozano for questioning by the prosecuting magistrates.\n\nAlfonso Pecoraro Scanio, head of the Italian Federation of the Greens, indicated that should the United States fail to cooperate with this investigation by allowing Lozano to be questioned, he would push for a hearing at the International Court of Justice.\n\nThe non-Italian media had been reporting that it was unlikely that Italy would seek to try Lozano \"in absentia\" were the U.S. to not render him to Italian custody. Despite the Italian government's desire to maintain a firm alliance with the United States an Italian judge has decided to try Lozano \"in absentia\".\n\nItalian prosecutors actively sought to interview Lozano as part of their criminal investigation into Calipari's death. On December 22, 2005, the special prosecutors of the Magistrate's service of Rome announced that they were considering charging Lozano with voluntary manslaughter.\n\nOn January 18, 2006, it was reported that the prosecutors had decided to charge Lozano with murder. The prosecutors indicated that despite making over twenty formal requests to the U.S., the U.S. refused to formally identify Lozano. After confirming Lozano's identity, the Magistrate service appointed an attorney to represent Lozano during the charging process.\n\nIn June 2006, the Italian government announced that prosecutors have formally charged Lozano with murder, and were considering an extradition request. The Italian government then carried through with its request, and the U.S. government, as expected, denied the extradition request. At that point, the Italian authorities considered putting Lozano on trial \"in absentia\".\n\nPutting foreigners on trial \"in absentia\" is a relatively uncommon practice in Italy, but exceptions are made for cases of \"political murder\". Prosecutors in Italy announced that the case against Lozano qualifies as a \"political murder\" case, and was thus eligible for trial \"in absentia\".\n\nIn the meantime, newspapers in the United States have quoted soldiers in Lozano's unit who said that he had been \"devastated\" when he learned that he had killed an Italian officer and wounded a female civilian, and that he was unable to sleep for days afterward.\n\nOn April 10, 2007, Lozano gave an interview to CBS Television in which he appeared deeply concerned about the legal proceeding in Italy, and very sorry about the \"pain he'd provoked to the family of Nicola Calipari\". He also reconfirmed the version he and his superiors already gave of the incident in Iraq, providing a sole new insight: contrasting the opinion of Mrs. Sgrena's life partner Pier Scolari that he'd shot \"300- or 400- rounds into and around the car\", he stated that it would have been impossible for him to do so as he'd have had to reload the machine gun at least once or twice to fire that many rounds.\n\nLozano's trial \"in absentia\" began on April 17, 2007. On October 25, 2007, an Italian court dismissed the charges against Lozano after determining that multinational forces in Iraq were under the exclusive jurisdiction of the country that sent them.\n"}

{"id": "1831132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831132", "title": "Loyola High School (Montreal)", "text": "Loyola High School (Montreal)\n\nLoyola High School is a private Catholic school for boys in grades 7–11 located in Montreal (Quebec, Canada). It was established in 1896 by the Society of Jesus as part of Loyola College, at the request of the English Catholic community in Montreal. It is named after St.Ignatius of Loyola, who founded the Jesuit Order in 1534.\n\nFounded in 1896, Loyola High School began as Loyola College (an eight-year classical college or \"\") which assumed responsibility for the English section of Collège Sainte-Marie de Montréal, a French Jesuit school which existed from 1848 to 1969. In 1916, Loyola College moved from its downtown location to the west end location on Sherbrooke St. West. In 1964, the Loyola High School Corporation was established to run the school separately from the college. When Loyola College merged with Sir George Williams University in 1974 to form Concordia University, the title to the land that the school occupied on the north-east corner of the campus was transferred from the college.\n\nTo this day, Loyola has remained true to its Jesuit apostolate, educating \"Men for Others\" who are intellectually competent, open to growth, religious, loving, and committed to doing justice.\n\nLoyola was originally located in an abandoned Sacred Heart Convent on Bleury and St. Catherine Street. A fire broke out at this location in 1898, provoking the college to move into the former Tucker School on Drummond Street. That summer, a wing was added, but space soon became inadequate. In 1900, the Jesuits purchased the Decary Farm in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce located in the west end of Montreal, where the school remains to this day on what is commonly referred to as the Loyola Campus of Concordia University.\n\nIn 1916, Loyola College officially moved to the new campus. The high school was located in the Junior Building and, until 1961, shared the Administration Building and then the north half of the Central Building. It was the Junior Building, which was designed in the Collegiate Gothic architectural style and covered in gargoyles, leaded and stained-glass windows and oak moulding, where young men began their journey to become \"Eight-Year Men\". After four years of high school and four years of college, they graduated with university degrees in Arts or Sciences.\n\nIn 1961, the era of boarders ended and the high school moved exclusively to the Junior Building. An extension was added in 1968 and a gymnasium was built south of Sherbrooke Street in 1978. In 1988 a decision was reached to erect a new building in order to properly accommodate the student body and to enable the school to offer the curriculum outlined by the Ministry of Education.\n\nLoyola considered a number of possible options for the future building, including adding an extension onto the Junior Building, and relocating the school to Côte Saint-Luc on land owned by Loyola (currently the location of Côte Saint-Luc City Hall). The school eventually made arrangements with Concordia University to swap the Junior Building for a site on the south-west end of Loyola campus beside the school gymnasium. The new building was completed in 1992. The Bishops Atrium and a three-story wing was constructed in 2004, along with an auditorium the following year.\n\nIn the school’s Mission Statement, Loyola is described as a “university-preparatory school.” Students are also expected to complete the requirements for a Secondary School Diploma to be admitted to C.E.G.E.P. Core and optional subjects offered in the high school curriculum are broken down according to cycle - Cycle 1 (years 1 and 2) and Cycle 2 (years 3, 4, and 5). The high school performs competitively locally and provincially in examinations results.\n\nAs a Catholic and Jesuit school, all of Loyola's activities are meant to be inspired by Catholic teachings in the tradition of St. Ignatius of Loyola. In 2015 Loyola's Board of Governors put forward a five-year strategic plan which identified five \"foundational pillars\" in order to pursue the school's mission. The plan proposed, among other things, to \"infuse all programmes with a truly Catholic and Ignatian pedagogy\" and to \"foster the maintenance of an Ignatian environment that engages the broader Loyola community\"\nWhile the school's president is ultimately responsible for ensuring the school's spiritual mission, the Loyola Ignatian Formation director oversees its particular activities in the entire Loyola community (alumni, parents, faculty, and students). The Campus Ministry is tasked with overseeing students' spiritual formation.\n\n\nThe Christian Service Program (CSP) is both an academic course and considered part of spiritual formation. In the course of their high school years, students participate in some form of supervised program known as \"CSP\" involving service to others.\n\nCSP is a compulsory program for all students. CSP project opportunities are already approved by the school. Alternatively, the students may find their own project around their area, subject to approval by the school deacon. CSP is broken down into two categories. For grades 7 – 10 students must complete a certain amount of community service hours twice a year (before Christmas break and after Christmas break. (Example: Grade 7: 2 hours before Christmas, 2 hours after Christmas; Grade 8: 4 hours before and after; Grade 9: 6 hours before and after; Grade 10: 8 hours before and after). For students in grade 11 the period of service is for 2 hours a week over the course of 12 weeks (total: 24 hours) before or after Christmas.\n\nLoyola is a member of the American Jesuit Schools Network, and is administered by the Jesuits of English Canada. The two Jesuit provinces, English and French, are currently in the process of merging into one Canadian Jesuit province.\n\nLoyola fields a number of athletic teams in competition with other schools in Canada and the United States, primarily competing in the Greater Montreal Athletics Association and Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec. Loyola's traditional rivals in athletics are Lower Canada College and Selwyn House School.\n\n\nOne of the largest high school sports tournaments in North America, the Ed Meagher Sports Tournament (est. 1971) boasts 40 teams and over 700 student-athletes, participating in hockey, basketball, and wrestling. Originally named the \"Invitational Winter Sports Tournament\", the tournament was renamed after its co-founder Ed Meagher in 1996 (the year of his passing). Meagher was a former student, teacher, and sports coach at Loyola High School.\n\nThe annual week-long tournament takes place each January and has grown considerably since its inception. Senior hockey (now Juvenile) was the original sport in 1971. In 1974, Senior basketball (now Juvenile) was added to the tournament, followed by Bantam hockey in 1981. Midget basketball was added in 1982, wrestling in 1995, Bantam basketball in 1998, and Pee-Wee hockey in 2003. In 2000, the Concordia University Arena (the arena used for all Loyola hockey home games and tournaments) was named the Ed Meagher Arena.\n\nThe name \"Loyola\" is derived from the Spanish \"Lobo-y-olla\", meaning \"wolf\" and \"kettle\". The school's coat of arms is a variation of St. Ignatius of Loyola's coat of arms, which depicts the union of the House of Loyola (represented by the two wolves and kettle) and the House of Onaz (represented by the seven red bars on a field of gold) in 1261. The phrase \"Loyola y Onaz\" typically appears at the bottom, though another variation of the school's coat of arms includes the Jesuit motto \"Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam\", meaning \"for the greater glory of God\".\n\n\nIn 2008, Quebec's Ministry of Education, Sport and Leisure introduced a mandatory \"Ethics and Religious Culture\" (ERC) course to all Quebec schools. Loyola had reservations about the course's ability to meet its objectives from a relativistic perspective, and applied for an exemption to teach an ERC equivalency course. Loyola's equivalency course had similar goals as the government's ERC but was structured on a methodology that was more in keeping with its Catholic, Jesuit identity. The government denied the request for exemption and, as a result, Loyola took the matter to the Superior Court of Quebec where in 2010 the Superior Court ruled in Loyola's favour. The Ministry appealed and in 2012 the appellate court overturned the Superior Court's decision.\n\nLoyola then took the case to the Supreme Court of Canada where, on 19 March 2015, it was ruled that the Quebec Ministry was in violation of Loyola's religious freedom and ordered the Ministry to reconsider the exemption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was established in 1865 and is part of the Society of Jesus. It is the oldest continuously run educational institution in Southern California.\n\nLoyola High School of Los Angeles is the region's oldest continuing educational institution pre-dating both the Los Angeles public school and the University of California systems. The school began in the downtown plaza Lugo adobe in 1865 as Saint Vincent's College at the behest of Archdiocese of Los Angeles Bishop Thaddeus Amat. After relocating to Hill Street in 1869 and to Grand Avenue in 1889, the Vincentian fathers ceded control of the school to the Society of Jesus in 1911, and it relocated to Avenue 52 in Highland Park as the prep school Los Angeles College. In 1917 the school moved to its current location on Venice Boulevard after the copper magnate and Irish philanthropist Thomas P. Higgins helped secure land for the school.\n\nThe college was renamed Loyola College the following year, in honor of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus. Until 1929, the campus housed the college, the law school, and the high school. At that time, the Jesuits purchased additional property to house the college and separate facilities were acquired for Loyola Law School just west of downtown Los Angeles. The college, now Loyola Marymount University, was moved to the area now known as Westchester in West Los Angeles.\n\nRecent campus development of the school occurred in the 1980s: the gym, track, and swimming pool, along with additional classroom space, were built after the administration secured major donations. A $30 million renovation with donations from the William Hannon Foundation, the Ardolf Family, and others have provided for a new science building, counseling and student centers, additional classrooms, and central plaza, which were operational as of June 2007, when construction of a new Xavier Center was begun. Hannon Theatre on campus with its large stage serves the students along with actors from throughout Southern Califrornia.\n\nThe primary admissions entry point for Loyola High School is in 9th grade, with varying transfer opportunities offered in 10th and 11th grades. Transfer is not allowed going into the senior year, except for rare situations. Admission is based on standardized test scores; recommendations from the candidate's teachers, principal, and minister; involvement in extracurricular activities; a personal statement; and grades.\n\nLoyola draws its students from throughout the greater Los Angeles area, from Pacific Palisades to East L.A., from Pasadena to San Pedro, from the South Bay as well as the San Fernando, San Gabriel, Santa Clarita, and Hidden Valleys. Nearly 50% of the student body is composed of individuals of African-American, Latino, and Asian heritages, which serves to enhance the ethnic and socio-economic diversity of the school.\n\nApproximately 800 students apply for 310 slots in the freshman class each year.\n\nFour years each of social studies and English studies courses are required, along with three years of foreign language study and of science, and one year of fine art. Eight semesters of theology are also a central part of the curriculum, covering Holy Scripture, systematic theology, Catholic social thought, moral theology, and one senior elective. Advanced Placement courses are offered in 25 subject areas with a historical \"pass\" rate of almost 80%, and students are encouraged to take a wide variety of electives outside of the required courses. Loyola also offers more than 19 Honors courses. Ninety-six percent of Loyola graduates attend a four-year college.\n\nIn 2014 Loyola sent 23 students to USC which has an 18% acceptance rate: the Loyola contingent was the most from any school.\n\nIn 2017, among 153 private high schools in the Los Angeles metro area, Niche ranked Loyola 13th in college readiness, and among 52 Catholic high schools 2nd overall with an A+ grade. Also, according to Niche, Loyola is the best all male school.\n\nSince the 1970s Loyola students have performed over one million hours of service to the community. As part of its commitment to educating \"men for and with others,\" Loyola students participate in four major service-oriented projects during their high school careers. The freshman serve as tutors on the Loyola campus for the award-winning High School Placement Test Prep Projects for 8th (October - January) and 7th graders (February - April), as well as assist with the Special Olympics. The second and third service projects include minimum 25-hour service projects during each of the sophomore and junior years. The Senior Service Project is a minimum 85-hour immersion commitment to a non-profit service organization in January of senior year. Inner city grade schools, special education schools, hospitals, hospices, shelters, and soup kitchens are preferred sites for this service experience. Now in its 29th year, the Senior Service Project was featured in \"Making A Difference\" as part of the NBC National News hosted by Brian Williams on March 11, 2010. The film clip is accessible on the Loyola and NBC websites. Loyola students' community service has been regularly featured on the local news programs of the ABC affiliate, Channel 7, including Kool Kids and a fundraising car wash conducted on behalf of Homeboy Industries in Los Angeles, the gang member reformation program founded by Greg Boyle, a Loyola graduate and former faculty member.\n\nLoyola sponsors one of the leading Community Service fairs in metro Los Angeles during the third week of September each year with over 100 local agencies, centers, schools, and organizations sending representatives to enroll Loyola students as volunteers. This event supports all of the school's service and justice education programs and seeks to support better-informed choices for service by the students.\n\nSeveral times over the course of the year, the Cubs Urban Plunge in Los Angeles is offered to students and faculty as a way for them to better experience the community from the position of the poor, disenfranchised, and marginalized. This is one of Loyola's distinguishing programs. Still the only high school in Los Angeles, public or private, to offer such a program, through this three- to four-day program, students serve in a number of shelters and centers on Skid row, Hollywood, and East Los Angeles. This program continued through the summer of 2010 with four urban plunges being offered. An overview of the Cubs Urban Plunge program may be found in the July edition of the \"Beverly Press.\"\n\nStarting in June 2007, Loyola began an out-of-area, hands-on service program with a two-week service immersion in New Orleans. The 2008 program took Loyola students to Appalachia, focused in Wheeling and Charleston, West Virginia. In July 2008 Loyola launched its foreign service immersion in Puebla and Cholula, Mexico. In June 2009, Loyola launched a five-week, academic exchange and service immersion with Colegio Del Salvador, the Jesuit high school in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The 2009 summer service immersion program included student, faculty, and staff service teams in New Orleans/Slidell, Louisiana, in mid June and another student, staff, alumni, and parent service team to Lima and Cusco, Peru, in late July and early August. The 2010 service immersion program included one that is agriculturally based in the Salinas Valley in Northern California and an extended urban immersion in Los Angeles, both conducted in mid-June. In 2010 Loyola again conducted a six-week Argentina Intercambio program based in Buenos Aires, expanded to include nine days in metropolitan Montevideo, Uruguay. The Intercambio is conducted in conjunction with the Jesuit colegios in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and in Santa Fe, Montevideo, Uruguay. An overview of the summer service immersion program may be found in the July 31, 2010, edition of \"The Tidings\", the weekly newspaper of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.\n\nOverall, each Loyola student completes a minimum of 150 hours of direct service by graduation with many of them matriculating with between 250 – 300 hours. Non-credit service activities include the annual Community Service Fair conducted each September, the Community Service Leadership Team, the annual AIDS Walk Los Angeles, the Peace and Justice Coalition, the annual School of the America's Watch and Ignatian Teach-In conducted just before Thanksgiving, Catholic Lobby Day in Sacramento, California, an annual social justice speakers series, and ongoing collection of food, clothing, books, and toys for distribution to the needy served by some of the school's 1,000 placement partners. Service and justice are two significant factors considered in making the most of the \"Big Seven\" awards for graduating seniors each June. Outstanding service leadership is recognized at the annual student awards ceremony and the Annual Community Service Awards Banquet held each May.\n\nLoyola is an active member of the Ignatian Solidarity Network (ISN), an association of 70 US Jesuit high schools, colleges, and universities engaged in social advocacy and justice education for students and adults. National and regional topical workshops included Loyola's hosting 500 students and adults from the US and Mexico for the 2008 ISN conference on comprehensive immigration reform. In years past, Loyola delegations have participated in national conferences on racism and poverty in New Orleans (2007) and comprehensive immigration advocacy in Washington, DC (2009). The 2010 ISN program occurred in Washington, DC, and focused on immigration, the environment, health care, and education.\n\nLoyola parent, alumni, faculty, and staff involvement in various service projects with students is a distinguishing characteristic of the Loyola program. Parents and alumni are heavily involved in staffing the Saturday tutoring programs for 8th graders and 7th graders each Fall and Spring. In December 2008 and again in October 2009, the whole Loyola faculty, staff, and administration spent the better part of a retreat day serving in the same agencies and schools as their students.\n\nLoyola's service program has received numerous awards from the City of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the California State Senate, and a number of various agency and civic groups for the million plus hours of student service contributed to the children, men, and women of Los Angeles.\n\nLoyola High School has a strong history of athletics success, including national championships in football and volleyball. Loyola has won at least one California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) title for ten years running, and in 2017 won the CIF Commissioner's Cup for the ninth year in a row. In the 2002-2003 academic year, Loyola set the California state record for most section championships (5) won in a single school year: cross-country, basketball, volleyball, track, and golf. The Cubs matched their still-standing state record in the 2015-2016 school year, winning section titles in Golf, Lacrosse, Swimming, Volleyball, and Soccer.\n\n\nTop All-Boys Athletic Program in the nation as ranked by ESPN RISE: 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011\n\nLoyola's football team competes in the highly competitive Serra League. The team achieved a particularly successful 2011-2012 campaign by notching 8 wins. During the 2015-16 season, the Cubs ended the regular season 8-2, including a perfect 7-0 on the road. This record led them to their first CIF Division 1 playoff appearance since 2011. They eventually lost in the second round to nationally ranked St. John Bosco, finishing the season with a 9-3 record and ranked in the Top 15 football programs in the state of California.\n"}

The company currently has its world headquarters in Farmingdale, Long Island, New York, and its European headquarters in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. It is a family-owned and operated business that is one of the largest string manufacturers in the world, not only producing several lines of strings under their own brand names, but also making OEM strings for other musical instrument companies.\n\nD'Addario also produces and distributes other musical accessories under other brands. Some of the products offered are cables, capos, ear plugs, electronic tuners, straps, humidifiers, picks, slides, drumheads, drum sticks, and reeds for woodwind instruments.\n\nThe D'Addario (phonetically pronounced in American English or in Italian) family of string-makers originated in the small Italian town of Salle in the province of Pescara. A baptismal form from 1680 names a \"Donato D'Addario\" as a \"cordaro\", where \"cordaro\" is a regional variant of Italian \"cordaio\" meaning \"maker or seller of ropes and strings\". From other historical records it appears that the town's primary occupations were farming and string-making. At the time strings were made of sheep or hog gut, and making them was a laborious process.\n\nAfter an earthquake devastated the town in 1915, two brothers-in-law, Rocco and Carmine D'Addario emigrated to Astoria in Queens, New York in an attempt to expand their market, importing and selling the strings made by their family in Salle. By 1918 Rocco had returned to Salle, and Carmine, who later, known as Charles, began making his own strings in a small shop behind the family home. Still made from gut, the process of making strings involved all members of the family.\n\nThe guitar saw a major rise in popularity in the early part of the 20th century, because of new popular music, and sometime in the 1930s the family began making strings for this instrument, producing strings made to order for individual musicians or for guitar manufacturers.\n\nThe development of nylon by DuPont during World War II produced a major change in the family business. Sent samples by Dupont in 1947, the D'Addarios immediately began experimenting with this new material, consulting with many of its regular customers in developing the strings.\n\nDuring the late 1940s and early 1950s (especially after the birth of rock and roll) nylon-stringed \"classical\" guitars were being eclipsed in popularity by the steel-string guitar. Some of the younger members of the family wanted to expand into steel strings, but Charles was reluctant to risk the family business on what he considered an uncertain market. In 1956 a new company (the Archaic Musical String Mfg Co.) began to make steel strings, run by Charles' son, John D'Addario Sr. The company made strings for several of the major guitar makers of the time, including Gretsch, D'Angelico, Martin, and Guild. In 1962 the two companies were merged under the name Darco.\n\nThe guitar had become the most popular instrument in the United States, and the Darco company came up with many innovations in the manufacture of guitar strings, including the first automated equipment to wind strings and the first roundwound bass guitar strings.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Darco was approached by Martin Guitars regarding a merger in order to pool resources and development efforts. While the partnership was beneficial for both companies, by 1974 the D'Addario family decided it was time to market strings under their own name, and the J.

{"id": "1831154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831154", "title": "State Socialism (Germany)", "text": "State Socialism (Germany)\n\nState Socialism () was a set of social programmes implemented in Germany that were initiated by Otto von Bismarck in 1883 as remedial measures to appease the working class and detract support for socialism and the Social Democratic Party of Germany following earlier attempts to achieve the same objective through Bismarck's anti-socialist laws. As a term, it was coined by Bismarck's liberal opposition to these social welfare policies, but it was later accepted by Bismarck.\n\nThe Prussian welfare state was developed by the German academic \"Sozialpolitiker\" (Social Policy Supporter) group, intellectually associated with the historical school of economics.\n\nAt the time, they influenced social liberalism in the United Kingdom and progressivism in the United States as well as the current post-World War II German economy (the social market economy) which is a continuation of similar policies.\n\nAccording to William Harbutt Dawson, despite being labeled socialist by his opponents, Bismarck's social legislation sought to preserve the existing economic order and state in Germany. This was in stark contrast to socialists, who sought to subvert the power of the existing state and eventually replace the capitalist order with a socialist economy.\n\nThe 1880s were a period when Germany started on its long road towards the welfare state as it is today. The Social Democratic, National Liberal and Centre political parties were all involved in the beginnings of social legislation, but it was Bismarck who established the first practical aspects of this program. The program of the Social Democrats included all of the programs that Bismarck eventually implemented, but also included programs designed to preempt the programs championed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Bismarck's idea was to implement the minimum aspects of these programs that were acceptable to the German government without any of the overtly socialistic aspects.\n\nBismarck opened debate on the subject on 17 November 1881 in the Imperial Message to the Reichstag, using the term \"practical Christianity\" to describe his program. In 1881, Bismarck had also referred to this program as \"Staatssozialismus\" when he made the following accurate prediction to a colleague:\nIt is possible that all our politics will come to nothing when I am dead but state socialism will drub[force] itself in [\"Der Staatssozialismus paukt sich durch\"].\n\nBismarck's program centered squarely on insurance programs designed to increase productivity and focus the political attentions of German workers on supporting the Junker's government. The program included health insurance, accident insurance (workman's compensation), disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension, none of which then in existence to any great degree. After Bismarck left office in 1890, further social legislation regulated working time and conditions and sought to protect more vulnerable workers (women and children) and establish a system to allow redress for employer abuse.\n\nBased on Bismarck's message, the Reichstag filed three bills designed to deal with the concept of accident insurance and one for health Insurance. Retirement pensions and disability insurance were placed on the back burner for the time being. Other bills were passed after Bismarck left office.\n\nThe first bill that had success was the Health Insurance bill, which was passed in 1883. The program was considered the least important from Bismarck's point of view and the least politically troublesome. The program was established to provide health insurance for the largest segment of the German workers. The health service was established on a local basis, with the cost divided between employers and the employed. The employers contributed one-third, the workers the rest. The contributions were made to \"sickness funds\", which employees could draw from when they needed medical care. The minimum payments for medical treatment and sick pay for up to 13 weeks were legally fixed. The individual local health bureaus were administered by a committee elected by the members of each bureau and this move had the unintended effect of establishing a majority representation for the workers on account of their large financial contribution. This worked to the advantage of the Social Democrats, who through heavy worker membership achieved their first small foothold in public administration.\n\nBismarck's government had to submit three draft bills before it could get one passed by the Reichstag in 1884. Bismarck had originally proposed that the federal government should pay a portion of the accident insurance contribution to show the willingness of the German government to lessen the hardship experienced by the German workers as a means of weaning them away from the various left-wing parties, most importantly the Social Democrats. The National Liberals took this program to be an expression of state socialism, which they were strongly against. The Centre Party was afraid of the expansion of federal power at the expense of states' rights. As a result, the only way the program could be passed at all was for the entire expense to be underwritten by the employers. To facilitate this, Bismarck arranged for the administration of this program to be placed in the hands of \"the organization of employers in occupational corporations\". This organization established central and bureaucratic insurance offices on the federal and in some cases the state level to perform the actual administration. The program kicked in to replace the health insurance program as of the 14th week. It paid for medical treatment and a pension of up to two-thirds of earned wages if the worker was fully disabled. This program was expanded in 1886 to include agricultural workers.\n\nThe old age pension program, financed by a tax on workers, was designed to provide a pension annuity for workers who reached the age of 70. At the time, the life expectancy for the average Prussian was 45, although this reflects the high infant mortality of the era and retired workers could expect to live until 70 years. Unlike accident insurance and health insurance, this program covered industrial, agrarian, artisans and servants from the start. Unlike the other two programs, the principle that the federal government should also contribute a portion of the underwriting cost, with the other two portions prorated accordingly, was accepted without question. The disability insurance program was intended to be used by those permanently disabled. This time, the state supervised the programs directly.\n\nThis law set up stricter regulations to ensure greater workplace safety, banned work on Sundays, introduced a maximum working day of eleven hours for women and ten hours for workers under 16 years of age and prohibited night work by them, banned those under the age of 13 from working in industry and encouraged the establishment of worker's committees in factories to address disputes. As a result, industrial tribunals were set up to settle disputes between employees and employers.\n\nThe law further tightened regulations on child labor to prevent exploitation of children.\n\n\n"}

She has recorded and performed as a singer and songwriter, and is known for the musicals \"The Secret Garden\" and \"Doctor Zhivago\".\n\nSimon was born in New York City, the daughter of the co-founder of the book publisher Simon & Schuster, Inc., Richard L. Simon and Andrea (Heinemann) Simon, a former switchboard operator, civil rights activist, and singer. Her father was from a German Jewish family, while her maternal grandfather Friedrich was of German descent. Lucy's maternal grandmother, known as \"Chibie\", was a Catholic from Cuba, and was of pardo heritage, a freed-slave descendant (the show \"Finding Your Roots\" tested Carly Simon's DNA as 10% African and 2% Indigenous). Her grandmother was sent to England and raised by nuns until the age of sixteen.\n\nShe is the older sister of musician Carly Simon. In addition to her younger sister Carly, she has an older sister, opera singer Joanna, and a younger brother, photographer Peter. Simon grew up in Fieldston, a section of Riverdale in the Bronx. She attended the Fieldston School, graduating in 1958 and Bennington College.\n\nSimon began her professional career at the age of sixteen singing folk tunes with sister Carly as The Simon Sisters and later folk-rock. Simon's setting of \"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod\" has been recorded by many diverse artists, including The Doobie Brothers, Mitzie Collins, and The Big Three (Cass Elliot, Tim Rose, and James Hendricks). In the mid-70's, after a number of years away from recording, Lucy released two albums on the RCA label of mostly original compositions, along with a few collaborations and covers. Her self-titled debut album was more folk-rock in orientation while her second album, \"Stolen Time,\" had a contemporary pop sound. Carly Simon and James Taylor provided backing vocals on half of the songs from \"Stolen Time.\"\n\nSimon made her Broadway debut as the composer of \"The Secret Garden\", for which she was nominated for a 1991 Tony Award for Best Original Score and a 1991 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music. She also wrote songs for the Off-Broadway show \"A... My Name Is Alice\".\n\nShe composed the music for a musical version of the Russian novel \"Doctor Zhivago,\" with lyricists Michael Korie and Amy Powers and book writer Michael Weller. The musical had its world premiere at the La Jolla Playhouse, San Diego, California, in May 2006. A new version of Doctor Zhivago ran in Sydney, Australia, Melbourne and Brisbane in 2011 under the title \"Doctor Zhivago - A New Musical\", starring Anthony Warlow in the title role and Lucy Maunder as Lara, the sensitive doctor's secret muse. The musical was produced by John Frost with Des McAnuff directing. Anthony Warlow starred in the Australian production of \"The Secret Garden\" and at that time Simon said of him, \"There is my Zhivago\". The musical premiered on Broadway \non March 27, 2015 (previews), with an official opening on April 21, 2015 at the Broadway Theatre, but was not successful, closing after 26 previews and 23 regular performances.\n\nSimon also contributed to the Off-Broadway musical \"Mama and Her Boys\".\n\nShe has won a Grammy award in 1981 together with her husband, David Levine, in the Best Recording for Children category for \"In Harmony/A Sesame Street Record\", and again in 1983 in the same category for \"In Harmony 2\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMarried to psychoanalyst David Levine, she has two children.\n\n"}

Following this, he became deputy executive producer on Sky's breakfast show \"Sunrise\" before moving to Channel 4 as their editor of news and current affairs. He was appointed senior editor (politics) at the \"New Statesman\" in late spring of 2009, where he stayed until May 2012, then becoming political director of \"The Huffington Post\" website.\n\nHasan became a presenter on Al Jazeera's English news channel in May 2012. Hasan has appeared (six times) on the BBC's \"Question Time\" programme, and the Sunday morning programmes \"The Big Questions\" and \"Sunday Morning Live\".\n\nIn 2013, Hasan took part in a debate at the Oxford Union to consider whether Islam is a peaceful religion. Hasan vouched for Islam as a religion of peace, citing political and cultural reasons for violence in Muslim majority countries, as opposed to holding the religion of Islam responsible. In the vote on the motion, the house affirmed with Hasan and the other proposers that Islam is a religion of peace with 286 votes in favor and 168 votes against.\n\nRecorded at the Oxford Union, \"Head to Head\" is a programme on Al Jazeera English in which Hasan interviews major public figures; it had run for three series by December 2014. Since 2015, working full-time for the network in Washington DC, Hasan has hosted a weekly interview and discussion programme.\n\nHasan began a podcast in 2018 entitled \"Deconstructed\", which is featured on the investigative journal \"The Intercept\". It considers recent news events covering topics ranging from police shooting, to inequality, to President Donald Trump activity on Twitter. The Podcast also has occasional guest star appearances, with his first podcast being with Bernie Sanders.\n\nIn a 14 February 2013 article for the \"New Statesman\", Hasan wrote:\nThe Iraq war was a strategic disaster – or, as the Tory minister Kenneth Clarke put it in a recent BBC radio discussion, 'the most disastrous foreign policy decision of my lifetime ... worse than Suez'. The invasion and occupation of the country undermined the moral standing of the western powers; empowered Iran and its proxies; heightened the threat from al-Qaeda at home and abroad; and sent a clear signal to 'rogue' regimes that the best (the only?) means of deterring a pre-emptive, US-led attack was to acquire weapons of mass destruction. ... Iraq has been destroyed and hundreds of thousands of innocent people have lost their lives, as the direct result of an unnecessary, unprovoked war that, according to the former chief justice Lord Bingham, was a 'serious violation of international law'.\n\nA regular contributor to \"The Guardian\", Hasan argued in November 2011: \"Wouldn't it be rational for Iran – geographically encircled, politically isolated, feeling threatened – to want its own arsenal of nukes, for defensive and deterrent purposes?\" Pointing out the difference between America, and its allies, going to \"war with non-nuclear Iraq\" and their \"diplomacy with nuclear-armed North Korea\", Hasan concluded: \"The simple fact is there is no alternative to diplomacy, no matter how truculent or paranoid the leaders of Iran might seem to western eyes.\"\n\nHasan wrote an article in \"The Guardian\" in September 2011 condemning the Iranian regime for its proposed execution of an \"apostate.\" \"The death sentence given to Youcef Nadarkhani in Iran is an affront to universal moral values and a disservice to Muslims.\"\n\nHasan, a Shia Muslim, has written articles about Islam and Muslims for the \"New Statesman\" and newspapers. \"My Islamic faith is based on the principles of peace, moderation and mercy\", he wrote in September 2012. He also said that while Muslims \"have every right to be angry\", such \"anger, however, is not an excuse for extremism.\"\n\nIn April 2009, Hasan argued against the concept and idea of an Islamic state. He argues that \"Today it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify a Muslim-majority nation that could plausibly be identified as a modern, viable and legitimate \"Islamic state\" and that \"contrary to popular Muslim opinion, there is not a shred of theological, historical or empirical evidence to support the existence of such an entity.\"\n\nIn November 2009, Hasan wrote a column denouncing suicide bombing from an Islamic perspective. Hasan argued that \"There is, in fact, nothing Islamic about so-called Islamic terrorism… So why are many Muslims so reluctant to condemn such cold-blooded tactics of terror?\"\n\nIn April 2010, Hasan wrote a piece condemning the controversial Islamic advocacy of the death penalty for apostasy in the \"New Statesman\". He states that \"The sharia (or Islamic law), it is claimed, sanctions the death penalty for any adult Muslim who chooses to leave the faith, or apostatise. This is an intellectually, morally and, perhaps above all, theologically unsustainable position.\"\n\nIn April 2012, Hasan wrote an article criticising British Muslims for being obsessed with foreign affairs and the anti-war movement. He criticised British Muslims' apparent apathy towards national issues: \"Why is it that most British Muslims get so excited and aroused by foreign affairs, yet seem so bored by and uninterested in domestic politics and the economy?\"\n\nFollowing allegations of Jewish conspiracy by British peer Lord Ahmed in March 2013, Hasan referred to antisemitism in the British Muslim community as being \"routine and commonplace\".\n\nIn May 2013, he appeared at an Oxford Union debate proposing a motion arguing that Islam is a religion of peace. The motion was carried.\n\nFollowing the 2017 Westminster attack, Hasan wrote an article in \"The Intercept\" criticising what he referred to as the \"common stereotype of the Middle Eastern, Muslim-born terrorist.\" He pointed out that the perpetrator of the attack, Khalid Masood, was born and raised in the United Kingdom and, therefore would not have been affected by any immigration ban. He also pointed out that Masood converted to Islam late in life and still had a history of criminality prior to his conversion. Hasan concluded, ergo, that while \"a distorted, simplistic and politicized form of Islam\" provided the justification for Masood's actions, the main motivation lay in \"social networks and family ties; issues of identity and belonging; a sense of persecution; mental illness; socio-economic grievances; moral outrage over conflict and torture; a craving for glory and purpose, action and adventure.\" Hasan also referenced to a 2008 leaked report by researchers for MI5, a 2010 Demos study, and a 2016 Egmont study, that came to similar conclusions \"challeng[ing] the conventional... wisdom on the role of religion in the radicalization process.\"\n\nHasan stated that the media should be sanctioned for \"dishonest, demonising press coverage\" of Muslims and other minorities, stating: \"I'm all in favour of free speech and the robust criticism of all religious beliefs. But it's the made-up stories and the smearing of individuals and whole communities that I have an issue with. Why isn't anti-Muslim bigotry as unacceptable in the press as anti-Jewish bigotry?\".\n\nIn October 2013, on BBC \"Question Time\", Hasan claimed that the \"Daily Mail\" was, among other accusations, \"Muslim-smearing\". The paper responded by claiming that he had applied to them for a column in 2010, praising their editorial standards and some of their positions.\n\nHasan has defended his anti-abortion views in print, writing \"What I would like is for my fellow lefties and liberals to try to understand and respect the views of those of us who are pro-life\" in an October 2012 online column for the \"New Statesman\". Hasan argued that the issue of abortion \"is one of those rare political issues on which left and right seem to have swapped ideologies: right-wingers talk of equality, human rights and 'defending the innocent', while left-wingers fetishise 'choice', selfishness and unbridled individualism.\" (He later regretted expressing himself in this way.) The article gained much attention on Twitter and Hasan debated the issue with Suzanne Moore on the \"Today\" programme on BBC Radio 4.\n\n\"Telegraph\" blogger Brendan O'Neill thought both Hasan and his pro-choice opponents shared the modern left's \"instinct for paternalism\" which contrasted, he asserted, with the pre-occupations of radicals a century ago, an era in which such figures, Hasan asserted, often opposed abortion. Labour MP Diane Abbott thought that \"any feminist, worth the name, knows that control over [our] own bodies is ground zero for every educational, social and economic advance that women have made in the last century\". Cristina Odone wrote: \"There are some things no one is allowed to speak of – especially if they are men.\"\n\nHasan has made several statements in opposition to the Saudi government, including challenging a statement made by Donald Trump, in which he claimed that he himself had no financial interests in Saudi Arabia, an allegation which Trump called \"fake news\". Hasan challenged Trump's statements in a video essay published by \"The Intercept\" in October 2018.\n\nIn February 2019, during a debate organised by Intelligence Squared in London, Hasan stated that the West should cut ties with Saudi Arabia, saying “It’s time we make clear that the West needs to cut its ties with Saudi Arabia, especially military ties, arms exports, weapons, bombs,” The comments were made in response to the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, allegedly ordered by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad Bin Salman, as well as several human rights violations which Hasan cited as also being carried out by Saudi Arabia. Hasan had previously interviewed Khashoggi about freedom of speech in Saudi Arabia.\n\nDuring a sermon delivered in 2009, quoting a verse of the Quran, Hasan said to an audience:\n\nIn response to criticism over the use of the term \"cattle\" to describe non-believers, Hasan wrote in his \"New Statesman\" blog: \"The Quranic phrase 'people of no intelligence' simply and narrowly refers to the fact that Muslims regard their views on God as the only intellectually tenable position, just as atheists (like Richard Dawkins or Sam Harris) regard believers as fundamentally irrational and, even, mentally deficient.\" Hasan returned to this issue in August 2012 following criticism from the columnist Peter Hitchens. Hasan wrote: \"the entire 45-minute speech is primarily an attack on Muslim extremists who try and justify violence against non-Muslims on an 'ends justify the means' basis\", but noted of his 2009 comments that his \"phraseology was ill-judged, ill-advised and, even, inappropriate\".\n\nIn January 2014, Hasan was awarded the Services to Media award at the British Muslim Awards. In 2017, he was named European Young Leader by the Brussels-based Friends of Europe think tank.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1831167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831167", "title": "Coedpoeth", "text": "Coedpoeth\n\nCoedpoeth is a large village and community within Wrexham County Borough in Wales. The built-up area with Minera had a population of 5,723, 2011 census. \n\nThe etymology of the placename is from Welsh \"coed\" \"wood\" with \"poeth\" meaning, in its original sense, \"burnt\", although the modern Welsh word translates as \"hot\". The name therefore translates roughly as \"burnt wood\", perhaps referring to the charcoal burning heritage in the village and local woods.\n\nIn its early history the area known as Coedpoeth was not a settlement, but was described (in 1411) as a \"waste\" – an uncultivated area – and later as a \"common\", presumably a wood with rights of common, in the upper part of the township of Bersham. Even as recently as 1832, the village of Coedpoeth did not yet exist as it currently does, and was instead four small hamlets. The Nant (from the Welsh word \"nant\", a stream or brook) to the south possessed two mills on the River Clywedog: Adwy'r Clawdd (literally \"the gap in the dyke\") to the north-east was named after a gap in Offa's Dyke. The Talwrn (from Welsh \"talwrn\", a cockpit, or more usually a field or open space) in the valley of the River Gwenfro to the north, was home to several small-scale coal mines, and the name of the Smelt, to the west, referred to smelting of lead in the area. These four hamlets became areas of Coedpoeth which grew, with increasing industrial development, around the inns and market hall on the ridge that became the high street of the village. The changes in population were reflected by a new church opening in 1875, with a replacement stone-built church, dedicated to St. Tudfil, being opened in 1895 as a chapel of ease within the ecclesiastical parish of Minera. By the 1860s, the village was named Coed Poeth, and this form of the name remained until the 1940s at the latest. The majority of 18th to early 20th century buildings in the village are constructed from local sandstone quarried at Penygelli quarries, with later examples being built with Ruabon red brick.\n\nIn civil administrative terms, Coedpoeth remained within the civil parish of Bersham. Later reorganisations, notably the 1974 changes subsequent to the 1972 Local Government Act, saw Coedpoeth included in its own local government community, with Bersham village placed in the community of Esclusham. A traditionally Welsh-speaking village, the use of Welsh has declined rapidly in the last two decades.\n\nTraditional methods of employment included the areas many coal mines, lead mining and smelting at Minera Lead Mines and the Smelt, and quarrying, in the nearby Penygelli, Berwig, and Minera quarries, all served directly by local railways. The late 20th century saw a decline in the area's traditional industries, and all have now disappeared. Today Coedpoeth is a dormitory village for commuters to Wrexham, and a point of sale for goods used by local farms and hamlets. There are still many small businesses in the village centre along the high street; but these small shops face fierce competition from large chain stores in Wrexham.\n\nThe village was surrounded by natural resources such as lime, iron ore, coal, and lead, and many ruins show the industrial past of the area. The earliest industry was lead smelting and an area of the village named \"The Smelt\" contains street names referencing the industry.\n\nCoal mining in Coedpoeth is documented from the early 15th century. Limited and shallow extraction took place throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, especially for the local iron industry. However, significant extraction did not begin until the sinking of the first deep shafts in the early 20th century, and now little remains of the industry. A number of colliery waste tips survive, now grown over, and the remains of shallow workings and bell pits are relatively common in some areas, with scheduled examples near Nant Mill. The most significant remains of the industry exist at Plas Power, where many buildings survive after reclamation of the waste tips in the 1990s. The owners of this colliery were also the owners of Plas Power Hall, which was built in 1757 by the Myddleton family; the name was changed to match an early owner, Sir Henry Power. The hall was damaged in a fire and demolished in 1951; but the stables remain after a campaign to list them led by Councillor Gordon Roberts of Middle Road. The estates boundary wall remains, and fills the gap between Coedpoeth and Wrexham, and the northern boundary is followed by the A525, apart from modifications at the A483 junction.\n\nThe village once had its own railway station on the Wrexham and Minera Railway of the Great Western Railway — albeit in name only as it was sited in the parish of Minera. A campaign was launched in 1905 by the business people of Coedpoeth to have a branch line laid from the station to the village centre, one mile distant. Local businesses claimed the station's location was of little benefit to them. The Great Western Railway company did not agree, and the campaign was abandoned in 1906. In 1914, the original station buildings were destroyed in a fire set by militant suffragettes.\n\nOriginally offering through services to two further halts on the line (Vicarage halt serving western Minera, and Berwig Halt), the station was a passenger terminus from 1926 and passenger services were withdrawn from 1930, although heavy goods use of the line by Berwig Quarry and Minera Limeworks continued until closure of the line in 1970, after the Limeworks was reduced to a base for road aggregates and was served by road.\n\nBus services first came to the village in the 1920s; they were first provided by the local government's Wrexham & District Transport Co. Ltd bus service from Wrexham, and followed by Great Western Railway's own bus services. Eventually Crosville Motor Services expanded into the area, and remained until Arriva North West & Wales came to manage all of their services, vehicles and depot in the area.\nToday, the village is linked to Wrexham by two bus services, one run by Arriva Buses Wales and another by D Jones and Son; also GHA Coaches provide a night time service, as well as all routes through the village going on to Ruthin and Denbigh, which now also stop along the high street. George Edwards and Son used to provide a daytime service, but in late 2008 they sold their service routes to D Jones and Son.\n\nCoedpoeth has two schools: Ysgol Penygelli and Ysgol Bryn Tabor (a Welsh-medium school). Originally one school in a Victorian building located to the north of the A525, Ysgol Penygelli was split into an infants school incorporating a nursery year and years 1–2, and a junior school, for years 3–6. The junior school is a feeder for the secondary school Ysgol Clywedog, in nearby Wrexham. Ysgol Bryn Tabor shared the same complex as Penygelli Infants to the south of the A525, which was part early 20th-century, with a large 1980s extension. Originally the local LEA planned to refurbish the original building on the north side of the road, but after a fire which destroyed the wooden beams supporting the original Welsh Slate roof, this building was demolished and materials reclaimed for an affordable housing scheme on the site. As a result, a new school complex was built and opened in July 2006, on the playing fields of the newer school, and Penygelli Infants and Penygelli Juniors are now one school again. Ysgol Bryn Tabor then expanded into the old Penygelli Infants site. The old junior school building was left vacant until demolition during March 2007. The site was then used for a new community centre and hall, named Plas Pentwyn. Pentwyn was the name of a farm that once stood nearby, belonging to the Powell family.\n\nThe original local library was a Carnegie Library built in 1904 as Coedpoeth Free Library. It cost £1,500 at the time, all of which was donated by Andrew Carnegie, the Scottish-American steel magnate. It was built in the same local sandstone as other buildings in the village, from quarries nearby, and stands opposite the villages memorial park and bowling greens. When opened, the ground floor featured a billiard table in a games room, as well as a refreshments room, with the rear of the building used for meetings of the local parish government. The reading room, which could also be used as a lecture room, was on the first floor. As the library was modernised, it was moved to the large games room on the ground floor, and the rest of the building became the community council headquarters.\n\nAs use of the old library increased, it became crowded, and the facilities were deemed inadequate. When Plas Pentwyn was constructed, room for a new library was provided, leaving the sole purpose for the old Carnegie Library as the headquarters for Coedpoeth Community Council, which has had a growing role in recent years.\n\nThe missionary Gwenfron Moss was born here in 1898.\n\nOlympic champion rower Tom James grew up in the village.\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion footballer Jordan Davies.\n\nActor Ricky Tomlinson previously lived here.\n\nCoedpoeth is on a hill between the Clywedog and Gwenfro valleys, surrounded by countryside with views of the Cheshire plain, Tanyfron, Southsea and the town of Wrexham.\n\nThe highest point of the village is Rock Place at 800 feet (245 m) above sea-level. The neighbouring village of Bwlchgwyn is one of several claiming to be the highest village in Wales, at 1090 feet (333 m).\n\nThe area is prone to snowfall, and has suffered localised flooding in recent years due to heavy rain. Welsh Water significantly invested in new drainage for the village in 2012, alleviating this problem.\n\nFor a full history see; \"List of football seasons involving Coedpoeth and Minera teams\"\n\nThe first football club in Coedpoeth was Lloftwen who there are reports of in January 1878. The next club in the village was Equitable who formed around 1880, and folded around 1884. Equitable entered the Welsh Cup in 1881. A club called Coedpoeth also existed at the same time who competed in the Welsh Cup from 1882–1884. Given that both these clubs appear and disappear at simultaneously it is possible that they were the same club, using interchangeable names depended on the reporter.\n\nIn 1884 there are reports of a team called White Stars (Coedpoeth), whilst in 1887 there is reports of a team called North End (Coedpoeth) who played at a ground called The Terrace.\n\nThe short lived Minera Rovers and Minera Victoria contested the Welsh Amateur Cup in 1890 and 1891. By 1892 Adwy United had emerged to represent the area. Adwy United reached the Semi Final of Welsh Amateur Cup in 1895. By 1898 they were joined in the Denbighshire League by another local team, Minera St Marys. Minera St Marys only lasted one season in this competition, taking on the fixtures of Cerney Swifts and finishing second from bottom.\n\nAdwy United were more competitive in the Denbighshire League, finishing third in 1899. They also won the St Martins Cup beating St Martins 5–0 at The Racecourse, Wrexham. There are reports of Adwy United playing in \"the same coloured jerseys\" as Chirk. Whilst this does not provide a definite answer on what colours Adwy United wore, it is documented that Chirk played in White and Blue.\n\nAdwy United withdrew from the Denbighshire League in 1900 and merged with Coedpoeth Victoria to form Adwy Victoria. This team finished second in the Denbighshire League in 1901.\n\nCoedpoeth United were first mentioned in 1907 when they joined the Wrexham & District League. They finished second in the Second Division and were promoted to the First Division for the 1908–09 season where they finished third. The 1908–09 season also saw the introduction of a Coedpoeth United Reserves team in the Second Division, who were joined in the league by another team from the village, Coedpoeth St Davids. In 1909 the team also reached the final of the Denbighshire & Flintshire Charity Cup, and St Martins Cup. Coedpoeth United withdrew from the Wrexham & District League in 1910.\n\nThis is the last record of any football teams in Coedpoeth prior to World War One.\n\nFollowing the end of hostilities Coedpoeth United re-emerged in 1920 in the North Wales Alliance League Division 2, a competition in which they finished as Runners Up, only missing out on being Champions on goals scored. From 1921-1924 Coedpoeth entered the newly formed Welsh National League (North). Between 1935-1938 the club competed in the Wrexham & District League.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, Coedpoeth re-emerged in the newly formed Welsh National League Wrexham Area East. They were Champions of the East Division in 1948 and 1949. The 1949 League winning team had a 100% record, and was promoted to Welsh National League Wrexham Area Division 1. The club stayed in Division 1 for two seasons, before being relegated in 1951. The club finished as Runners Up in Division 2 in 1953 achieving Promotion back to Division 1. The team was immediately relegated again, and played a final season in Division 2 before folding at the end of the 1955 season.\n\nIn 1964 almost a decade after the previous Coedpoeth team had folded, Coedpoeth Sports Club entered Welsh National League Wrexham Area Division 3. Coedpoeth SC were immediately successful and were Champions in their first season gaining Promotion to Division 2. Their stay in Division 2 lasted two seasons as in 1967 they were Champions and Promoted again. The club lasted 5 seasons in Division 1 before finishing 15th in 1972 and dropping two leagues back to Division 3. The club initially struggled back in Division 3, however in 1974 Coedpoeth SC were Champions and promoted. 1976 saw the club complete a League and Cup double as they won Division 2 alongside the Horace Wynne Cup. The club finished 10th back in Division 1, however folded in 1977 after being knocked out of the Welsh Cup in the Qualifying Round.\n\nCoedpoeth once again reformed for the start of the 1980-81 season and finished Second in Welsh National League Wrexham Area Division 4 however were not Promoted. The following the season the club went one better and were Champions of the Division 4. This marked the beginning of an astonishing rise, as the club claimed the Division 3 title at its first attempt, and finished as Division 2 Runners Up straight away too. The club finished 13th in its first season in Division 1 and was subsequently relegated. The club remained in Division 2 before folding in 1989.\n\nThe current Adult section of the club reformed in 1999 and joined the Welsh National League.\n\n"}
{"id": "1831168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831168", "title": "United Party (Papua New Guinea)", "text": "United Party (Papua New Guinea)\n\nThe United Party is a political party in Papua New Guinea. As of May 2019, it has one seat in the National Parliament and is led by Minister for Foreign Affairs, Rimbink Pato.\n\nThere were attempts from 1964 to 1968 to form political parties. A meeting was held in Port Moresby and a Territory Country Party, organized along the Australian Country Party was formed in 1967.\n\nThe connection between Australian Country Party and political parties in PNG was through the Compass Party (later United Party). Despite talks and media release, the Compass Party was formed in Minj in 1967 by certain expatriate and indigenous Members of the House of Assembly who were aligned with the farmers and planters association, the Highlands Farmers & Settlers Association Incorporated (HFSA). Members of HFSA in Parliament were Ian Downs, Highlands Special (President of HFSA), John Watts (WH Regional), Mike Casey (Kainantu), Sinake Giregire (Goroka) (first indigenous member of HFSA). The prominent national being Giregire and Members from Simbu and EH.\n\nAfter its formation, Tei Abal (Wabag) was appointed its Leader with Giregire as Deputy. The United went into 1968 Elections and returned as a force against the pro independence, Pangu Party. As the Partyy was conservative, most of its Members were appointed Ministers and Vice Ministers. The Party went again to the polls in 1972 and returned and with the self-government in 1973, Tei Abal and Sinake Giregire and Paul Langro were on the Constitutional Planning Committee.\n\nThe third Party was the Peoples Progress Party (1970) under Julius Chan (Namatanai). At this time, the Australian Country Party sent an officer to PNG to assist the United Party in establishing its working structure. This ACP officer was in Eastern Highlands (Goroka) and so Giregire took on the advantage of the Australian canvassing and organisational assistance to form a PNG version of the Australian Country Party. Using the Constitutional Planning Committee (a faction calling itself the Nationlaist Pressure Group - Giregire, Fr. John Momis and John Kaputin) Giregire canvassed support to bring a fourth force with Members from United Party and Pangu Pati to form Country Party which was formally recognized on the floor of Parliament in March 1974. The Country Party had 14 Members under the leadership of Sir Sinake Giregire (MP for Goroka and later Daulo) and Michael Pondros (Manus).\n\nThe role of Country Party featured prominently in the Constituent Assembly when it was more or was taking the lead in the Nationalist Pressure Group (Momis, Kaputin and Giregire) who wanted to present the CPC Report as it is to become the Constitution and on one hand Somare and Pangu who wanted amendments such as dropping the Provincial Government system.\n\nThis followed on with Melanesian Alliance Party under Fr. John Momis and the Mataungan Association taking a political party status with John Kaputin and Oscar Tammur on floor of Parliament.\n\nDespite the breakup, United Party contested the 1977 Elections and came with a majority of Members but Pangu formed a COalition with PPP, National Party, Melanesian Alliance and Mataungan against United/Country Party with Somare as Prime Minister.\n\nCountry Party, United Party and National Party were seen as a Highlands dominated Party. To break that stronghold Somare appointed Paias Wingti as his Deputy Leader in 1982. Wingti then broke ranks with Pangu and with other Members including from United Party formed Peoples Democratic Movement in 1985.\n\nWith the loss of Sir Tei Abal, Leader of United Party in 1987, leadership tussle came into play with Roy Evara, Anton Parao, Paul Torato and others.\n\nGradually, the fortunes of United Party waned in 1992 and 1997 Elections. In 1997 Elections it had only one MP in Gabia Gagarimambu. In 2002, it had three MP's in Bire Kimisopa (Goroka), Bob Dadae (Kabwum) and Ben Kiagi (Daulo). The party went to the 2007 National Elections under leadership of Hon. Kimisopa but returned with two out of 109 seats in the 2007 General Elections.\n\nAt the 2002 elections, the party won 3 seats in the 109-seat national parliament. The party leader for the 2002-2007 term was Bire Kimisopa, member for Goroka Open, in Eastern Highlands province.\n\nIn the 2007 elections, the party won 2 seats in parliament.\nKimisopa was replaced as party leader on 22 August 2007, having lost his seat. He was replaced as leader by Bob Dadae, member for Kabwum Open in Morobe Province. Dadae crossed to the People's National Congress in May 2012, stating that his people wanted him to be aligned with a major party.\n\nThe party won one seat at the 2012 election, with Rimbink Pato winning Wapenamanda Open and assuming the United Party leadership.\n\n"}
{"id": "1831174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831174", "title": "Plastic wrap", "text": "Plastic wrap\n\nPlastic wrap, cling film, Saran wrap, cling wrap or food wrap is a thin plastic film typically used for sealing food items in containers to keep them fresh over a longer period of time. Plastic wrap, typically sold on rolls in boxes with a cutting edge, clings to many smooth surfaces and can thus remain tight over the opening of a container without adhesive. Common plastic wrap is roughly 0.0005 inches (12.7 μm) thick. The trend has been to produce thinner plastic wrap, particularly for household use (where very little stretch is needed), so now the majority of brands on shelves around the world are 8, 9 or 10 μm thick.\n\nPlastic wrap was initially created from polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which remains the most common component globally. PVC has an acceptably-low permeability to water vapor and oxygen, helping to preserve the freshness of food. There are concerns about the transfer of plasticizers from PVC into food.\n\nA common, cheaper alternative to PVC is low-density polyethylene (LDPE). It is less adhesive than PVC, but this can be remedied by adding linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), which also increases the film's tensile strength.\n\nIn the US and Japan, plastic wrap is sometimes produced using polyvinylidene chloride (PVdC), though some brands, such as Saran wrap, have switched to other formulations due to environmental concerns.\n\nThe most important role plastic wrap plays in food packaging is protection and preservation. Plastic wrap can prevent food from perishing, extend its shelf-life, and maintain the quality of food. Plastic wrap generally provides protection for food from three aspects: chemical (gases, moisture, and light), biological (microorganisms, insects and animals), and physical (mechanical damage). In addition to food protection and preservation, plastic wrap can also reduce food waste, tag food information, easy the distribution processes, and increase product visibility and microwavability.\n\nPlastic materials are widely used in the food industry due to its low price and convenience; however, there has been an increased health concern because of the possibility of releasing undesirable chemicals from plastic materials into food products. Plastic packages are made of various materials such as polyethylene, low-density polyethylene and etc. Additives, including lubricants, plasticizers, UV absorbers, colorants, and antioxidants, are added into plastic materials in order to improve the quality and properties of the plastics. Besides, plastic materials are often coated and printed in the final processes, in which inks and varnishes are used. Although the barrier properties of the plastic packages provide protection of foods from external contaminations, the additives and coating materials in the plastic packages are possible to penetrate into foods and cause health-related issues.\n\n\"It is true that substances used to make plastics can leach into food,\" says Edward Machuga, Ph.D., a consumer safety officer in the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. “But as part of the approval process, the FDA considers the amount of a substance expected to migrate into food and the toxicological concerns about the particular chemical.” A couple of cases have caught media attention in recent years. One case is in regard to diethylhexyl adipate (DEHA). DEHA is a plasticizer, a substance added to some plastics in order to make them flexible. The public concerns about DEHA exposure while consuming food with plastic wraps. There are potentials of exposure to DEHA; however, the levels of the exposure are much lower than the no toxic effect levels in animal studies. Another case is in regard to the dioxins, labeled as \"likely human carcinogen\" by the Environmental Protection Agency. The public has been misled by the claims that plastics contain dioxins, while Machuga stated that no evidence that shows plastic containers or films contain dioxins was seen by the FDA. Overall the use of plastic wrap in the food industry does not pose danger to human health.\n\nThe accumulation of plastic debris on the Earth threatens both wildlife and the environment. Plastic debris might choke or trap wildlife, and it could also penetrate toxic compounds into ecosystems. This land-originated problem has become a problem in ocean ecosystem as well since streams and rivers which are close to the land have carried the plastic debris into the coast, and currents transfer it to everywhere in the ocean. Plastic debris is a potential danger to all forms of aquatic life. Some marine species, like sea turtles, take plastic as prey items by mistake. Besides, some species might even pick up plastics and feed their offspring, which cause huge problems on growth and even cause mortality. Toxic compounds in plastics can disrupt hormone regulation in the cells of organisms, which can lead to alteration of animals’ mating behavior, reproductive ability, and even cause the development of tumors. Plastic debris could be a big threat to lives in the ocean.\n\nA study shows that using recycled plastic materials can reduce the environmental impacts significantly as a result of minimizing exploration, mining and transportation of natural gas and oil. One of the possible ways to increase the recycling rate is adding fibrous reinforcement into plastics. The environmental impact has been assessed using the life cycle assessment method. The results showed that plastics with fibrous reinforcement added can sharply reduce resource usage and global warming in civil applications.\n\n\n"}

One exception, they agree, is Danny Breslin (Bobby Jordan), a young boxer who is studying economics and destined for success. While Danny's future looks bright, the future of his former best friend, Muggs McGinnis (Leo Gorcey), appears to hold little more than troubles with the law and juvenile probation. One day, when Danny learns that Muggs has been speaking poorly of his schoolteacher sister Mary (Charlotte Henry), he marches over to Clancy's Pool Hall, their favorite neighborhood haunt, and punches Muggs. The fight eventually turns into a pool hall riot, which results in Muggs's arrest. Officer Tom Brady (Warren Hull), Mary's sweetheart, believes that many of the boys can be reformed, and when he learns that Muggs has been involved in another fight, he tries to enlist Danny's help in determining the reason behind Muggs' propensity to fight. Danny surprises his mother, sister and Tom when he violently protests Tom's request, saying that he hates \"coppers,\" and vows never to return to the police gym for his boxing practice. While Tom lays plans to reform Muggs by entering him as a fighter in the upcoming Golden Glove Tournament, Danny unwittingly gets involved with notorious thug Monk Martin (Bobby Stone). Unknown to Danny, Monk has used him to drive his getaway car in a grocery store holdup. After paying Danny for his \"services,\" Monk manages to persuade him to quit school and join his racket. Meanwhile, Muggs, having made great strides at the Whitney reform school, goes to live with Tom and his mother (Martha Wentworth), much to the dismay of Mary, who promptly breaks off her relationship with Tom. Muggs eventually wins the respect of the entire neighborhood and earns the police department's sponsorship of his fight in the Golden Glove Tournament. So completely has Muggs given up his delinquent ways that he curses Monk when the racketeer offers him $1,000 to take a fall in the tournament fight. Later, after overhearing Tom's mother blaming his arrival for the break-up of Tom and Mary's relationship, Muggs becomes despondent and decides to move out. Just before the fight, crooked fight promoter Slats Morrison (Eddie Foster) plants the intended bribery money in Muggs's gear and tries to frame him. Danny, meanwhile, is wounded by Tom as he and Monk are caught fleeing from a robbery. Hospitalized and in desperate need of blood, Danny's life hangs in the balance until Muggs volunteers his blood and saves his best friend. Mary has a change of heart and returns to Tom, and Tom announces that Monk made a full confession before dying. Danny's family gathers around a radio and listens with pride as Muggs knocks out his opponent at the tournament. Following the fight, Slats and his boss Dorgan are arrested, and Tom and Mary look forward to their wedding.\n\nHuntz Hall's first East Side Kids film.

He pledged that, if the party formed the next government, it would give ten percent of the national budget to churches to assist young people, stating that \"PNG proclaimed itself to be a Christian country but the Government had not made that a reality.\" He also pledged to fight corruption and to investigate a number of past financial deals involving the national government.\n\nThe party won four seats at the 2002 election: Yama (Usino-Bundi Open), Yuntavi Bao (Kainantu Open), Miki Kaeok (Wapenamanda Open) and Ekis Ropenu (Kerema Open). It supported Michael Somare for Prime Minister and was to be allocated one ministry in his government, but Yama stated that he would step aside due to a misconduct investigation. Three more MPs were reported to have joined the party in December 2002: Cecilking Doruba (sole MP for the PNG First Party), Gordon Wesley (sole MP for the One People Party) and independent Fabian Ine, although they faced issues with anti-floor crossing laws. The misconduct proceedings against Yama were quashed in March 2003.\n\nThe party won an additional seat at the Southern Highlands supplementary election in May 2003, with the election of Balus Libe in Komo-Magarina Open. Yama claimed at that time that with further defections the party had a total of 10 MPs Yama was promoted to the ministry in August 2003 as Minister for Labour and Industrial Relations, but was sacked in November. Bao also served as a minister in Somare's government, but was himself sacked in January 2004 after the party voted against an attempted constitutional amendment to curb no-confidence votes.\n\nFollowing their sacking, the party moved to the opposition and attempted to oust the Somare government. In May 2004, Yama was briefly recognised as Leader of the Opposition when Speaker Jeffrey Nape attempted to prevent Peter O'Neill from taking the office. However, in July, the party announced that Repenu had replaced Yama as leader, and that the party would again support the government. The party again reversed later in the term, with Yama regaining the leadership and the party pledging to strongly oppose the re-election of the Somare government by the time of the 2007 election.\n\nThe party won two seats at the 2007 election: Patrick Kondo in Daulo Open and Koni Iguan in Markham Open, while Yama was defeated in a bid for Governor of Madang Province.

Legends of romantic tragedy are often associated with a Lover's Leap.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lovers' Leap at Hawks Nest State Park in the town of Ansted, West Virginia, along the historic Midland Trail, has a drop of from a high cliff overlooking the New River Gorge. The promontory was named \"Lovers' Leap\" by settlers, and has acquired a legend involving two young Native Americans from different tribes.\n\nBlowing Rock Mountain, outside Blowing Rock, North Carolina, has a similar legend of a young lover leaping from the cliff and instead of plunging to his death, is saved. In this version the lover is saved by the blowing wind which sends him back into the arms of his sweetheart.\n\nWills Mountain has a Lovers' Leap overlooking Cumberland Narrows on the west side of Cumberland, Maryland. It is above sea level and made up of oddly squared projections of rock from its top all the way down to the National Road (U.S. Route 40) below. The city of Cumberland and the surrounding states of Pennsylvania and West Virginia may be seen from this point.\n\nMark Twain in \"Life on the Mississippi\" writes: \"There are fifty Lover's Leaps along the Mississippi from whose summit disappointed Indian girls have jumped.\" Princess Winona is one such legend, in which the daughter of a Dakota chief leaps to her death rather than marry a suitor she does not love. Maiden Rock, Wisconsin, is one site for the Winona legend, though other locations include Winona Falls in Pennsylvania, Camden County, Missouri and Cameron Park in Waco, Texas.\n\nDovedale in the Peak District in the United Kingdom has a limestone promontory named Lovers' Leap reached by a set of steps built by Italian prisoners of war captured in World War II. The local legend is that a young woman believed her lover had been killed in the Napoleonic wars, so she threw herself off the top of the promontory. Later, her family found out that her lover was alive and well.\n\nThe south coast of Jamaica at Saint Elizabeth Parish has a Lovers' Leap above the Caribbean Sea. Lovers' Leap is named after two slave lovers from the 18th century, Mizzy and Tunkey. According to legend, their master, Chardley, liked Mizzy; so, in a bid to have her for himself, he arranged for her lover, Tunkey, to be sold to another estate. Mizzy and Tunkey fled to avoid being separated but were eventually chased to the edge of a large steep cliff. Rather than face being caught and separated, the lovers embraced and jumped over the cliff. The story was used as the basis for a romantic novel.\n\n\n"}

The term was first used in British law in a statute of the British Parliament in 1885 and was carried forward in other statutes throughout the British Empire. The offense was never actually defined in any of the statutes which used it, which left the scope of the offense to be defined by court decisions. The concept of gross indecency as a criminal offense is reflective of Victorian-era morality. \n\nThe term \"gross indecency\" was first used in the Labouchere Amendment (section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885), which criminalized sexual acts between men, including those done in private.\n\nGross indecency statutes consequently spread throughout the British Empire. Canada adopted the term in section 178 of the Criminal Code in 1892. The term was also used in the Criminal Code (sections 206 (1906, 1927), 149 (1953–1954), 157 (1970), 161 (1985)) as well as in the Criminal Law Amendment Act (1968–1969, section 7); however, all statutes that used the term were repealed in 1985 with an amendment to both the Criminal Code and the Canada Evidence Act.\n\nThe United Kingdom later used the term in the Sexual Offences Act 1956 and in section 1(1) of the Indecency with Children Act 1960.\n\nOscar Wilde was charged and convicted of gross indecency in 1895. His trial and punishment is the subject of the 1997 play \"\".\n\nAlan Turing pleaded guilty to the crime in 1952, the consequences of which led to his suicide in 1954. Turing, who had been convicted of gross indecency for consensual, private homosexual acts, received a posthumous pardon in 2013. In 2017, under the Alan Turing law, all men convicted of gross indecency due to consensual, private sexual acts were pardoned.\n\nEverett George Klippert was the last person in Canada to be arrested, charged, prosecuted, convicted, and imprisoned for gross indecency for homosexuality before the decriminalization of homosexual acts in 1969; the reform was a direct result of the Klippert case. In 1965 Everett George Klippert was interrogated by the police as part of an arson investigation in the Northwest Territories. Klippert was arrested after admitting that he had had sex with other men. When psychiatrists determined that he was unlikely to stop having sex with men, he was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to life in prison. \"Maclean's\", Canada's popular newsweekly, then printed an article sympathetic to homosexuals. This led to increasing calls to reform Canada's law on homosexuality. Klippert was released in 1971.\n\nIn Australia, a gross indecency statute exists in South Australia, with gross indecency requiring the involvement of a minor (a person under 16 years old). A first-time offense is a three-year felony, and any subsequent offense is a five-year felony.\n\nGross indecency between male persons of any age, in public or private, is a felony punishable by up to five years' imprisonment. Gross indecency is a lesser offense than sodomy, which is punishable by up to 14 years' imprisonment. LGBT rights activists are trying to repeal the law.\n\nIn the United States, Michigan is the only state that currently has gross indecency statutes. Michigan has three types of gross indecency crimes exist, all of which are five-year felonies:\n\nGross indecency between male persons was codified first, and the other two were made into laws later. Historically, the definition of gross indecency was unclear, and courts relied on nebulous notions such as the \"common sense of society\". The vagueness of the term allowed for adults who engaged in consensual sex with no monetary transactions in the privacy of their own homes to be charged with the crime, and men who had sex with men were particularly vulnerable to prosecution. Over time, the definition increasingly narrowed through Michigan Supreme Court decisions, and a 1994 decision officially narrowed it to sex acts that occurred in a public place or that involved a minor, the application of force, or a monetary transaction. Michigan now has separate statutes addressing all four aforementioned acts in statutes regarding indecent exposure, criminal sexual conduct (CSC), and prostitution; however, the gross indecency statutes remain in effect.\n\nThe gross indecency statutes have been criticized by LGBT rights activists.\n\n"}

His most notable film role was that of Vincent Vacarri in the 1980 film \"The Idolmaker\" for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. He is also known for his role as Sonny Steelgrave in the television series \"Wiseguy\".\n\nSharkey was born in Brooklyn to Cecelia and Ray Sharkey, Sr. He was of Irish and Italian descent. Sharkey's father was a professional drummer who abandoned the family when Sharkey was five years old. He was raised by his mother, Cecelia in Brooklyn's Red Hook neighborhood. Sharkey became interested in acting after seeing Jack Lemmon in the 1962 film \"Days of Wine and Roses\". After attending New York City Community College for one year, he enrolled at the HB Studio to study acting. While attending the HB Studio, Sharkey performed in various Off-Broadway stage productions. In 1973, he and his friend boxer/actor Chu Chu Malave moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting careers.\n\nIn 1974, he made his film debut in \"The Lords of Flatbush\". Sharkey went on to appear in more than forty motion pictures and dozens of guest appearances on various television series.\n\nIn 1980, Sharkey portrayed rock promoter \"Vincent \"Vinnie\" Vacarri\" in \"The Idolmaker\". The role boosted Sharkey's career and earned him a Golden Globe Award for his performance in the film. The following year, he was nominated for another Golden Globe for his role in \"The Ordeal of Bill Carney\", in which he played the title role. Shortly after appearing in \"The Idolmaker\", Sharkey developed a $400 a day heroin habit. As a result of his drug use, his career declined and he was relegated to mainly supporting roles. He overdosed several times and was involved in four drug-related car accidents, two of which required him to undergo microsurgery on his eyes. He tried undergoing rehab treatment several times but would ultimately relapse a few months later. In 1987, Sharkey spent two months in an Orange County rehab center in an effort to kick his drug and alcohol addiction for good.\n\nFour days after leaving rehab, he won the role of Sonny Steelgrave in the series \"Wiseguy\". The character proved to be popular with audiences and boosted Sharkey's career. The character was written out of the series in 1989. Sharkey then co-starred in the biographical film \"Wired\". Based on the life of John Belushi, Sharkey portrayed a Puerto Rican angel who meets Belushi after his death in the morgue and \"show[s] him the error of his ways.\" Sharkey's next role was in the 1989 black comedy film \"Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills\".\n\nIn 1991, he starred in the ABC sitcom \"The Man in the Family\". While Sharkey received good reviews for his performance, the show was panned by critics and canceled after one season. The following year, he appeared in a guest spot on \"Jake and the Fatman\", and starred in the television movie \"\". On July 30, 1992, while filming a guest spot on the television series, \"The Hat Squad\", in Vancouver, he was arrested for drug possession. Canadian customs officials, making a routine inspection of incoming cargo at the airport, discovered small amounts of cocaine and heroin in a black envelope being sent from Los Angeles to Sharkey in Vancouver. Police searched his hotel room and found an additional supply of drugs. He was jailed and later released on bail. Sharkey was later fired from \"The Hat Squad\". Sharkey's final role was in the 1993 comedy film \"Cop and a Half\".\n\nIn May 1981, Sharkey married model Rebecca Wood. The marriage ended in 1986 due to Sharkey's drug abuse. In 1988, he married actress Carole Graham. That marriage produced one daughter, Cecelia, in 1989. In November 1992, Graham divorced Sharkey also citing his drug abuse as the reason for the divorce. \n\nOn September 22, 2015, Sharkey's daughter, Cecelia Bonnie Sharkey, was charged with capital murder for the death of her boyfriend's mother, Patricia Metropoulous (Hickerson) . In November 2017 she pleaded no contest, was declared insane at the time of the crime and was committed to Patton State Hospital.\n\nSharkey was diagnosed as HIV positive in the late 1980s. He reportedly contracted the virus through intravenous drug use. After his death, Sharkey's manager Herb Nanas admitted that they both decided to keep his diagnosis a secret fearing it would hurt his career. Despite his diagnosis, Sharkey remained in denial about his HIV positive status and, according to his manager, had sex with an estimated 100 women after he was diagnosed.\n\nIn April 1991, Sharkey began a relationship with model/actress Elena Monica, daughter of comedian Corbett Monica. In July 1991, she became ill and was hospitalized with aseptic meningitis. During a routine check, she tested positive for HIV. Monica believed she contracted the virus from Sharkey who continued to deny that he had infected her. Monica ended the relationship in October 1991 due to her suspicions. In July 1992, she learned that another woman also suspected that Sharkey had infected her with HIV as well. Later that same year, Monica filed a $52 million lawsuit against the actor for knowingly infecting her with HIV.\n\nIn an interview with \"Details\" magazine conducted in March 1993, three months before his death, Sharkey told the reporter that he was in fact HIV-positive by saying that he \"harbored a strain of HIV\" that he believed would never develop into AIDS. At the time of the interview, Sharkey weighed , had a hacking cough and was suffering from a brain lesion. When asked about his ex-girlfriend Elena Monica who accused him of infecting her with HIV, Sharkey said, \"This disease is funny. One day you're negative and the next day you're positive. And people suffer. I don't think she suffered from me.\" Monica won her lawsuit against Sharkey by default judgment after his death (Sharkey declined to challenge her suit when it was originally filed), but she received no compensation from his estate because the actor had very little money.\nOn June 11, 1993, Sharkey died of complications from AIDS at Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York, at age 40. He is interred in Saint Charles Cemetery in Farmingdale, Long Island, New York.\n\nIn June 1993, shortly after Sharkey's death, a Beverly Hills graphic designer, who said she had an on-and-off relationship with Sharkey from 1985 to 1991, announced that she was suing Sharkey's estate. The woman, who was only identified as \"Joyce\", cared for Sharkey in his final months and said that she believed that she also had contracted HIV from Sharkey after she was diagnosed with the virus in April 1992.\n\n"}

It is specifically used in heparin overdose, in low molecular weight heparin overdose, and to reverse the effects of heparin during delivery and heart surgery. It is given by injection into a vein. The onset of effects is typically within five minutes.\nCommon side effects include low blood pressure, slow heart rate, allergic reactions, and vomiting. Allergic reactions may be severe and include anaphylaxis. The risk is greater in males who have had a vasectomy. While there is no evidence of harm from using during pregnancy it has not been well studied in this group. Protamine works by binding with heparin.\nProtamine sulfate was approved for medical use in the United States in 1969. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$2.82–12.20 per vial. It was originally made from the sperm of salmon. It is now mainly made using recombinant biotechnology.\n\nProtamine sulfate is usually administered to reverse the large dose of heparin administered during certain surgeries, especially heart surgery where anti-coagulation is necessary to prevent clot formation within the cardiopulmonary bypass pump apparatus. A dose of protamine is given once the patient is off-pump, when extracorporeal circulation and anticoagulation are no longer needed.\n\nIt is also used in gene transfer, protein purification and in tissue cultures as a crosslinker for viral transduction. In gene therapy, protamine sulfate has been studied as a means to increase transduction rates by both viral and nonviral-mediated delivery mechanisms (e.g. utilizing cationic liposomes).\n\nProtamine is used in insulin aspart protamine and NPH insulin.\n\nDosage for heparin reversal is 1.0 to 1.5 mg protamine sulfate IV for every 100 IU of active heparin. PTT should be monitored at 5 to 15 minutes after dose then in 2–8 hours afterward.\n\nProtamine has been reported to cause allergic reactions in patients who are allergic to fish, diabetics using insulin preparations containing protamine, and vasectomized or infertile men. These occur at rates ranging from 0.28% to 6%.\n\nAvoiding rapid infusion of protamine sulfate and pre-treating at-risk patients with histamine receptor antagonists (H1 and H2) and steroids may minimize these reactions. A 5 to 10 mg test dose is recommended following pretreatment before administering the full dose.\n\nIt is a highly cationic peptide that binds to either heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to form a stable ion pair, which does not have anticoagulant activity. The ionic complex is then removed and broken down by the reticuloendothelial system. In large doses, protamine sulfate may also have an independent — however weak — anticoagulant effect.\n\nProtamine was originally isolated from the sperm of salmon, but is now mostly made by recombinant biotechnology.\n\n"}

Manuel Rivera died while conducting a training mission over the Persian Gulf when his AV-8B Harrier smashed into the Omani coastline while approaching the deck of the amphibious assault ship USS Nassau (LHA-4) for a landing. The real cause of the crash was not settled. Investigators believed condensation on the AV-8B's canopy could have interfered with the pilot's vision, or maybe that he just became disorientated by the horizon\n\nCapt. Manuel Rivera is buried in Section 14, Site 966 of the Calverton National Cemetery, a United States National Cemetery in the Town of Riverhead in Suffolk County on eastern Long Island in New York.\n\nOn January 30, 1991, the United States House of Representatives paid tribute to Capt. Manuel Rivera and on May 9, 1991, the Hon. James H. Scheuer of the House of Representatives also paid tribute to the fallen Marine. P.S. 279 (Public School 279) was renamed P.S. 279 Capt. Manuel Rivera Jr. honoring his memory. Also, a street, park and public housing project were named after him in the South Bronx. In March 1995, the United States Marines donated a McDonnell-Douglas TA-4F, a Marine Corps fighter jet, to Aviation High School in memory of Rivera Jr.. The students at the school will use the jet to learn inspection and maintenance procedures. His name was engraved in \"El Monumento de la Recordación\" (Monument of Remembrance), dedicated to Puerto Rico's fallen military members and situated in front of the Capitol Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and unveiled by Puerto Rico Senate President Kenneth McClintock and PR National Guard Adjutant General Col. David Carrión Baralt on Memorial Day, 2007.\n\nAmong Rivera's military decorations are the following:\n\nBadges:\n"}
{"id": "1831239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831239", "title": "Protamine", "text": "Protamine\n\nProtamines are small, arginine-rich, nuclear proteins that replace histones late in the haploid phase of spermatogenesis and are believed essential for sperm head condensation and DNA stabilization. They may allow for denser packaging of DNA in the spermatozoon than histones, but they must be decompressed before the genetic data can be used for protein synthesis. However, in humans and maybe other primates, 10-15% of the sperm's genome is packaged by histones thought to bind genes that are essential for early embryonic development.\n\nProtamine and protamine-like (PL) proteins are among the sperm specific nuclear basic proteins (SNBPs). The PL proteins are intermediate in structure between protamine and Histone H1, the C-terminal of which being the precursor of vertebrate protamine.\n\nDuring the formation of sperm, protamine binds to the phosphate backbone of DNA using the arginine-rich domain as an anchor. DNA is then folded into a toroid, an O-shaped structure, although the mechanism is not known. A sperm cell can contain up to 50,000 toroid-shaped structures in its nucleus with each toroid containing about 50 kilobases. Before the toroid is formed, histones are removed from the DNA by transition nuclear proteins, so that protamine can condense it. The effects of this change are 1) an increase in sperm hydrodynamics for better flow through liquids by reducing the head size 2) decrease in the occurrence of DNA damage 3) removal of the epigenetic markers that occur with histone modifications.\n\nThe structure of the sperm head is also related to protamine levels. The ratio of protamine 2 to protamine 1 and transition nuclear proteins has been found to change the sperm head shape in various species of mice, by altering the expression of protamine 2 via mutations in its promoter region. A decrease in the ratio has been found to increase the competitive ability of sperm in Mus species. However, further testing is required to determine how this ratio influences the shape of the head and whether monogamy influences this selection. In humans, studies show that men who have unbalanced Prm1/Prm2 are subfertile or infertile. Protamine 2 is encoded as a longer protein that needs its N-terminal cleaved before becoming functional. Human and chimp protamine has undergone rapid evolution.\n\nWhen mixed with insulin, protamines slow down the onset and increase the duration of insulin action (see NPH insulin).\n\nProtamine is used in cardiac surgery, vascular surgery, and interventional radiology procedures to neutralize the anti-clotting effects of heparin. Adverse effects include increased pulmonary artery pressure and decrease peripheral blood pressure, myocardial oxygen consumption, cardiac output, and heart rate.\n\nProtamine sulfate is an antidote for heparin overdose, but severe allergy may occur. A chain shortened version of protamine also acts as a potent heparin antagonist, but with markedly reduced antigenicity. It was initially produced as a mixture made by thermolysin digestion of protamine, but the actual effective peptide portion codice_1 has since been isolated. An analogue of this peptide has also been produced.\n\nIn gene therapy, protamine sulfate's ability to condense plasmid DNA along with its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have made it an appealing candidate to increase transduction rates by both viral and nonviral (e.g. utilizing cationic liposomes) mediated delivery mechanisms.\n\nProtamine may be used as a drug to prevent obesity. Protamine has been shown to deter increases in body weight and low-density lipoprotein in high-fat diet rats. This effect occurs through the inhibition of lipase activity, an enzyme responsible for triacylglycerol digestion and absorption, resulting in a decrease in the absorption of dietary fat. No liver damage was found when the rats were treated with protamine. However, emulsification of long-chain fatty acids for digestion and absorption in the small intestine is less constant in humans than rats, which will vary the effectiveness of protamine as a drug. Furthermore, human peptidases may degrade protamine at different rates, thus further tests are required to determine protamine’s ability to prevent obesity in humans.\n\nMice, humans and certain fish have two or more different protamines, whereas the sperm of bull and boar, have one form of protamine due to a mutation in the PRM2 gene. In the rat, although the gene for PRM2 is present, expression of this protein is extremely small because of limited transcription due to an inefficient promoter in addition to altered processing of the mRNA transcript.\n\nThe 2 human protamines are denoted PRM1 and PRM2.\n\nExamples of protamines from fish are:\n\nThe primary structure of protamine P1, the protamine used for packaging DNA in sperm cells, in placental mammals is usually 49 or 50 amino acids long. This sequence is divided into three separate domains: an arginine-rich domain for DNA binding flanked by shorter peptide sequences containing mostly cysteine residues. The arginine-rich domain consists of 3-11 arginine residues and is conserved between fish protamine and mammalian protamine 1 sequences at about 60-80% sequence identity.\nAfter translation, the protamine P1 structure is immediately phosphorylated at all three of the above-mentioned domains. Another round of phosphorylation occurs when the sperm enters the egg, but the function of these phosphorylations is uncertain. When protamine P1 binds to DNA, cysteine from the amino terminal of one protamine P1 forms disulfide bonds with the cysteine from the carboxy-terminal of another protamine P1. The disulfide bonds function to prevent the dissociation of protamine P1 from DNA until the bonds are reduced when the sperm enters the egg.\n\nThe secondary and tertiary structure of protamine is not known with certainty, but several proposals have been published.\n\n"}

He graduated from York University in Toronto in 1991 with a bachelor's degree in economics.\n\nIn 1994, Shnaider co-founded Midland Group—originally a steel producer—with former business partner Eduard Shifrin. The company operated in Ukraine before government-owned steel factories were privatized. In 1999, Midland Resources began buying shares in the Zaporizhstal steel mill. By 2001, Shnaider's consortium had bought 93 per cent of the mill for $70 million.\n\nAccording to the Panama Papers, in 2010, Shnaider sold at least half of Midland's ownership in Zaporizhstal to buyers financed by Russian state-owned Vnesheconombank, who were then themselves acquired by the development bank.\n\nShnaider bought Jordan Grand Prix from Eddie Jordan in February 2005 for approximately US$50 million, and renamed it Midland F1 Racing for the 2006 Formula One season. On 9 September 2006, the team was sold to Spyker Cars.\n\nIn December 2007, Shnaider bought Israeli soccer team Maccabi Tel Aviv for an estimated 12 million euros. On 4 August 2009, Shnaider sold the club to Canadian property developer Mitchell Goldhar, after investing $20 million in the club. Goldhar took on Shnaider's 80 per cent stake in the club by agreeing to take on its financial commitments; he also paid $750,000 to the Maccabi Tel Aviv sports foundation for its 20 percent stake.\n\nShnaider partnered with Donald Trump in the construction of the Trump International Hotel and Tower, which is in Toronto. Trump was a minority shareholder in the project, and his firm owned the property management contract (the minority share and management contract were bought out in 2017, with the property renamed the Adelaide Hotel Toronto). In 2007, Shnaider was reported as having decided to keep the penthouse suite for himself, at an estimated value of $20 million. In 2017, the building and Shnaider were named as key links in a financial connection between Trump and the Russian government. Shnaider reportedly used proceeds from the sale of his Ukrainian steel mill to partially meet cost overruns at the Toronto Trump Tower.\n\nIn March 2010, Shnaider invested in a property consortium that bought Toronto's King Edward Hotel for $50 million. The asset was purchased in a distressed sale from Lehman Brothers. Shnaider originally invested alongside three other real estate companies, Skyline International Development Inc., Dundee KE Inc., and Serruya Realty Group Inc. However, on 1 August 2012, Omni Hotels & Resorts CEO James D. Caldwell also took a stake in the hotel; and on 24 November 2015, Omni Hotels and Resorts announced that it had bought the other parties out and fully owned the hotel.\n\nIn 2011, Shnaider formed a Delton Retail fund, a property group, with N3 Real Estate, owned by Dutch businessman A.D.G van Dam.\n\nOn 30 December 2015, Shnaider invested NIS₪39 million in Mishorim Development Ltd., a real estate company controlled by developer Gil Blutrich. Shnaider had already invested alongside Blutrich in the King Edward Hotel, which Blutrich invested in via Skyline International Development Inc., a Mishorim subsidiary. On July 2016, he increased his holdings in this company from 21% to 37%.\n\nShnaider is married to Simona Shnaider (\"née\" Birshtein). They have three daughters.

{"id": "1831255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831255", "title": "This Week in Tech", "text": "This Week in Tech\n\nThis Week in Tech–casually referred to as TWiT, and briefly known as Revenge of the Screen Savers–is the weekly flagship podcast and namesake of the TWiT.tv network. It is hosted by Leo Laporte and many other former TechTV employees and currently produced by Karsten Bondy. It features round-table discussions and debates surrounding current technology news and reviews, with a particular focus on consumer electronics and the Internet. TWiT is produced in the TWiT \"eastside\" studios in Petaluma, California, United States, as of 27 August 2016, a few miles away from the former \"brickhouse\" studios where it was produced for 5 years, and earlier TWiT \"cottage\", where it was produced for over 6 years. The podcast is streamed live on Sundays at 2:15 P.M. PST.\n\nFollowing the show's number, title, sponsors and theme tune, Leo Laporte typically begins an episode of \"TWiT\" by introducing the week's panelists, allowing each of them to discuss his or her recent projects or work. The main portion of the show consists of a round-table discussion and debate, pegged loosely to a selection of the week's major technology headlines. The format of the show encourages spontaneity and the conversation often diverges wildly from technology topics. This causes the length of each episode to vary, sometimes considerably, from show to show, although most episodes run approximately two hours. Each episode typically features three or four commercial breaks, usually in the form of a \"live read\" from Laporte that may include interaction with the panelists (e.g., Laporte usually prompts guests for recommended audiobooks during spots for frequent advertiser Audible.com). The show closes with each panelist giving a personal \"plug\" for their affiliated website or Twitter account.\n\nThe most frequently recurring guests on TWiT include John C. Dvorak, Patrick Norton, Wil Harris, Kevin Rose, Robert Heron, David Prager, Tom Merritt, Roger Chang, Dwight Silverman and Jason Calacanis. Other guests include Becky Worley, Steve Gibson, Xeni Jardin, Alex Lindsay, Owen Stone, Veronica Belmont and Molly Wood.\n\nThe show has had a number of famous guests, including Steve Wozniak, Kevin Mitnick, John Hodgman, Lawrence Lessig, artist Roger McGuinn, as well as \"\" cast members LeVar Burton (Geordi La Forge) and Wil Wheaton (Wesley Crusher).\n\nIn September 2015, Leo Laporte famously \"banned\" his long-time friend and frequent TWiT guest John C. Dvorak from the show for various comments Dvorak made on Twitter. In reply to Dvorak's comments that Laporte was biased, Laporte told Dvorak \"you won't ever have to worry about it again\", insinuating that he never wanted Dvorak back on TWiT. Laporte apologized a few days later, but continued to berate Dvorak publicly. Dvorak returned to TWiT on December 23, 2018.\n\nThe program began when Laporte recorded a one-off round-table discussion between himself, Patrick Norton, Sarah Norton, Kevin Rose, David Prager, and Roger Chang at the 2005 Macworld Expo in San Francisco.\n\nAfter publishing the show on his blog to an enthusiastic public reception, Laporte decided to rename this discussion \"episode 0\" and turned the round-table concept into a weekly downloadable audio file, or \"podcast,\" featuring more cast members from his former TechTV program \"The Screen Savers\". The first episode was posted on Monday, April 18, 2005 as \"Revenge of the Screen Savers\", but it was temporarily renamed \"Return of the [BEEP]\" and shortly thereafter changed in response to a cease and desist letter sent to Laporte from Comcast, owners of TechTV's intellectual property rights, arguing it too closely resembled the defunct show's name. (TWiT started using the Screen Savers trademark after Comcast allowed it to expire, and \"The New Screen Savers\" was launched as a separate weekly program on May 2, 2015.) In episode 2, Laporte announced a contest in which listeners could suggest a new name for the show. One listener suggested \"This Week in Geek\", which inspired Laporte to create the eventual name, \"This Week in Tech\", or \"TWiT\".\n\nThe weekly show was originally recorded with all of the hosts staying at their respective homes and talking via Voice over IP (mostly using Skype). Starting around episode 10, Norton began physically coming to Leo's Petaluma office during the taping. Upon Rose's announcement that he was moving to San Francisco, Laporte started to gather the panelists for public live tapings in the San Francisco area, with most episodes being videotaped and released as a video podcast download.\n\nDuring the fall of 2005, several of the previously regular hosts began to move on to other projects, resulting in the format of the show changing from being a show with a core group of hosts and occasional guests, into Laporte being the only regular host, and inviting in a variety of different guests each show. Around the same time, the people responsible for filming the shows, the Pixel Corps and their leader, Alex Lindsay became more involved with the show, with many also contributing.\n\nDuring the first few years TWiT episodes were made available in a variety of file formats for individual download or RSS subscription. These included a standard 64 kbit/s MP3, a low-bandwidth 16 kbit/s MP3, Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), and open source Ogg Vorbis. However, the Ogg Vorbis version of the show ceased to be offered in August 2009 with the AAC and low bandwidth MP3 versions ending in early November 2009. In response, Leo Laporte stated that he was a believer that his content should be made available to the widest audience possible in the format of their choice, as well as philosophically agreeing with the open source nature of Ogg Vorbis. However the time and effort the TWiT Staff needed to encode, upload, and distribute alternate audio formats in the limited time between recording and release each Sunday evening was not justified by the number of people choosing to listen to them.\n\nThe show recording is usually posted every Sunday evening.\n\n\"TWiT\" has won two Podcast Awards, as both the \"People's Choice\" and as \"Best Technology Podcast\". This Week in Tech also made Time Magazine's Top 10 Podcasts of 2006, ranked 9th.\nIt also won Podcast of the Year from the 2007 Weblog Awards.\n\nTWiT began as an audio podcast, although several video episodes were filmed in the first few years of the show. Starting in 2008, the show was made available for live streaming in both audio and video formats. Since episode 215 in October 2009, the show has been available weekly as both an audio and video download as well as on YouTube.\n\nAll episodes are licensed under the Creative Commons attribution share-alike noncommercial license, and are distributed via direct download from the TWiT.tv website, from Apple's iTunes Store, or as a subscription on any device with the necessary internet connection and podcasting software. There is no charge to download current or past shows.\n\nThe show is typically available in three formats: 64 kbit/s MP3, 32 kbit/s MP3, and 64 kbit/s AAC. Occasionally, other bitrates are used for episodes produced in stereo, however most episodes are monaural. The files are available as direct downloads, with bandwidth provided by Cachefly. On 23 February 2014, before recording TWiT 446, Laporte stated that episode bandwidth for the entire network is around 950 terabytes per month.\n\nA sponsorship deal with America Online was announced on July 4, 2005, following the server demand that resulted from the release of iTunes 4.9's built-in podcasting directory. Since the new TWiT website was launched, the TWiT Torrent server initially preferred by Laporte has ceased operation. In several episodes, Laporte has noted that the distributed nature of BitTorrent makes it impossible to accurately gauge the popularity of the show, decreasing the likelihood of attracting advertisers. As of episode 174, TWiT began being hosted from AOL Radio. AOL hosting ended in the summer of 2013.\n\nLaporte stated in episode 3 that the show would always remain free and without advertising. However, due to ongoing costs as a result of TWiT.tv's constant expansion, a roadmap for the introduction of podcast and web-based advertising was announced during episode 45 of This WEEK in TECH. On 5 September 2006, TWiT.tv officially became one of the first major advertising-supported podcast networks, sponsored initially by both Visa and Dell.\n\nListeners have always been invited to support the network by means of an automatic PayPal subscription or one-time payment. In the past, this granted access to an exclusive TWiT forum which no longer exists, yet donations are still accepted. Listener funding has been used for the operational costs of the network including improvements to Laporte's recording studio and to purchase radio-quality microphones and digital audio-recording devices for the hosts. Financial compensation for the network mostly comes from the network's sponsors. Sponsors of the network include Ford, Audible, Lantronix, Squarespace, Hulu, Rackspace, Hover, Carbonite, Stamps.com and more.\n\nBefore recording started for This Week in Tech 268 on 3 October 2010, while discussing the sale of TechCrunch to AOL, Laporte mentioned that his network would \"do three to four [million ]\" in advertising revenue for 2010. Based on the increase in the number of sponsored programs as well as the increase in sponsors, the 2013 gross revenue is estimated to be in the eight million dollar range. This Week in Tech Episode 561 on 5/08/2016 had extensive talk about podcast revenue. In the episode, Leo Laporte said a recent New York Times article stated that podcasts ad revenue was $57 million per year and \"If that's true, than I actually own 25% of all of the podcasting revenue in the world.\" This would put TWIT ad revenue around $13–14 million per year.\n\n\n"}

Some examples of lignans are enterolignans, enterodiol and enterolactone.\n\nFrom \"lign-\" (Latin, \"wood\") + \"-an\" (chemical suffix).\n\nPlant lignans are polyphenolic substances derived from phenylalanine via dimerization of substituted cinnamic alcohols (see cinnamic acid), known as monolignols, to a dibenzylbutane skeleton 2. This reaction is catalysed by oxidative enzymes and is often controlled by dirigent proteins.\n\nMany natural products, known as phenylpropanoids, are built up of C6C3 units (\"n\"-propylbenzene skeleton 1) derived from cinnamyl units just as terpene chemistry builds on isoprene units. Structure 3 is a neolignan, a structure formed by joining the two propylbenzene residues at other than the β-carbon atom of the propyl side chain.\n\nWhen a part of the human diet, some plant lignans are metabolized by intestinal bacteria to mammalian lignans enterodiol (1) and enterolactone (2). Lignans that can be metabolized to mammalian lignans are pinoresinol, lariciresinol, secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, hydroxymatairesinol, syringaresinol and sesamin.\nLignans are one of the major classes of phytoestrogens, which are estrogen-like chemicals and also act as antioxidants. The other classes of phytoestrogens are isoflavones and coumestans.\n\nFlax seed and sesame seed contain higher levels of lignans than most other foods. The principal lignan precursor found in flaxseed is secoisolariciresinol diglucoside. Other sources of lignans include cereals (rye, wheat, oat and barley - rye being the richest source), soybeans, cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and cabbage, and some fruit, particularly apricots and strawberries.\n\nSecoisolariciresinol and matairesinol were the first plant lignans identified in foods. Typically, lariciresinol and pinoresinol contribute about 75% to the total lignan intake whereas secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol contribute only about 25%. Lignans are some of the secondary metabolites present in Cannabis sativa.\n\nSources of lignans:\nA 2007 study shows the complexity of mammalian lignan precursors in the diet.

It was established in 1993 to honor wrestlers who began their careers long before the 1990s, mostly alumni of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), the predecessors of WCW. Inductees received commemorative plaques that had their names & portraits inscribed on them. Wrestlers were inducted by Gordon Solie, a senior commentator in professional wrestling, and received their plaque during the \"Legends Reunion\" segment at WCW's May pay-per-view event, Slamboree. The WCW Hall of Fame was the second hall of fame established to honor professional wrestlers, after the creation of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) Hall of Fame in February 1993. After the 1995 Hall of Fame ceremony, WCW stopped the production of the Hall of Fame without a formal announcement. In 2001, the WWF acquired all of its assets; this led to the formal stoppage of the WCW Hall of Fame. The WWF, however, stopped producing its Hall of Fame ceremony after 1996. In 2004, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), the WWF's successor, reinstated the WWE Hall of Fame, which included inductees that were alumni of WWE, NWA, JCP, and WCW.\n\nThe first Hall of Fame ceremony was held on May 23, 1993 at Slamboree 1993 at The Omni in Atlanta, Georgia. The first wrestler inducted into the Hall of Fame was Lou Thesz, along with Verne Gagne and Mr. Wrestling II. Eddie Graham was also inducted that year; he was the first posthumous inductee into the Hall of Fame. During the following Hall of Fame ceremony on May 22, 1994 at Slamboree 1994 at Civic Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Harley Race led the Class of 1994. Ole Anderson, The Crusher, posthumous inductee Dick the Bruiser, Ernie Ladd, and Masked Assassin were also inducted that year. The final ceremony was held at Slamboree 1995 on May 25, 1995 in St. Petersburg, Florida at Bayfront Arena, in which Wahoo McDaniel led the Class of 1995. Also inducted that year were posthumous inductee Big John Studd, Terry Funk, Antonio Inoki, Angelo Poffo, Dusty Rhodes, and Gordon Solie. Following the 1995 ceremony, Solie, who both inducted the wrestlers and was an influential figure in the selections, resigned from WCW in protest of Poffo's initiation, feeling that management only inducted an unqualified person into the WCW Hall of Fame as a favor to Poffo's son, and one of the company's top draws, Randy Savage.

Geographically Ü-Tsang covered the south-central of the Tibetan cultural area, including the Brahmaputra River watershed. The western districts surrounding and extending past Mount Kailash are included in Ngari, and much of the vast Changtang plateau to the north. The Himalayas defined Ü-Tsang's southern border. The present Tibet Autonomous Region corresponds approximately to what was ancient Ü-Tsang and western Kham.\n\nÜ-Tsang was formed by the merging of two earlier power centers: Ü () in central Tibet, controlled by the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism under the early Dalai Lamas, and Tsang () which extended from Gyantse to points west, controlled by the rival Sakya lineage. Military victories by the powerful Khoshut Mongol Güshi Khan that backed 5th Dalai Lama and founded Ganden Phodrang government in 1642, consolidated power over the combined region, followed by the rule of the Qing Dynasty started in 1720 by the Qianlong Emperor that continued until the British expedition to Tibet (1903–1904).\n\nÜ-Tsang is the cultural heartland of the Tibetan people, originally governed by Rinpungpa dynasty. The Tsangpa dynasty had ruled the Tsang part between 1565 and 1642. The dispute between Tsang kings, Karma Tenkyong Wangpo followers of karmapa and Khoshut khans, Güshi Khan, follower of gelugpa and Dalai Lamas ended by the rule on Tibet from the Potala and Norbulingka palaces in Lhasa from the last one. Jokhang, perhaps the most holy temple in Tibetan Buddhism, is also located there. The Lhasa dialect is used as a \"lingua franca\" in Ü-Tsang and the Tibetan Exile koiné language is also based largely on it.\n\nTsang, whose largest cities are Gyantse and Shigatse, near where the Panchen Lama has his traditional seat at Tashilhunpo Monastery, was designated on maps of the Qing dynasty as \"Back Tibet\", while Ü, where the Dalai Lama has his seat at Lhasa, was designated \"Front Tibet\". This division was an artificial construct of the Chinese and had no currency within Tibet where the Dalai Lama exercised effective rule over both Tsang and Ü. An attempt had been made in the 18th century during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor to split Tibet by offering the Panchen Lama dominion over Tsang, but the expansive offer was declined, the Panchen Lama only accepting a small portion of the offered territory. Later attempts, during the period 1906–1913 and in 1950, by the Panchen Lama to resurrect a separate Back Tibet over which he would have dominion were rejected by the Chinese.\n"}

It is the state's largest state park at and is home to the Alabama Wildlife Center, Oak Mountain Interpretive Center, and Oak Mountain BMX Track. Park activities include hiking, swimming, camping, fishing, horseback riding, and golf. The park is managed by the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.\n\nOak Mountain was created when the State Land Act of 1927 granted the park the between Double Oak Mountain and Little Oak Ridge. From 1934 to 1941, the park saw improvements made by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Works Progress Administration. Remnants of the CCC era—foundations, bridges and other infrastructure, often made of stone quarried from within the park—can be seen throughout the park. In 1943, the National Park Service (NPS) deeded the state park approximately of surrounding land that the NPS had acquired in the 1930s. Further improvements beginning in 1971 saw development of the golf course, pro shop, cottages, administrative buildings, demonstration farm and campgrounds in the area of Dry Brook basin and adjacent to the park's lakes.\n\nBeach/Day-Use Area - Double Oak Lake has shaded picnic areas, covered pavilions for rent, a beach for public swimming, volleyball courts, and paddle boat rentals.\n\nFishing - Oak Mountain Fishing Center is located at the north end of the park at the \"Back Gate.\" The park has three fishing lakes, totaling , stocked with largemouth bass, bream, catfish and crappie. The park sells bait and rents flat-bottomed fishing boats. The park has facilities for launching private boats and allows the use of electric trolling motors. Fishing licenses are required and are available at the park.\n\nHiking - The park has of hiking trails that range from easy to moderate in difficulty. The Treetop Nature Trail is an elevated boardwalk where owls, turkey vultures, and other non-releaseable birds housed in large cages may be viewed.\n\nCamping - The park's campground has 85 improved and 60 primitive campsites. Backcountry camping is also available.\n\nHorseback Riding and Equestrian Camping - The Orange Trail (or Horse Trail) is dedicated to equestrian use, with foot and bike traffic unpermitted.

{"id": "1831309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831309", "title": "Education in Switzerland", "text": "Education in Switzerland\n\nThe education system in Switzerland is very diverse, because the constitution of Switzerland delegates the authority for the school system mainly to the cantons. The Swiss constitution sets the foundations, namely that primary school is obligatory for every child and is free in public schools and that the confederation can run or support universities.\n\nThe minimum age for primary school is about six years in all cantons but Obwalden, where it is five years and three months. After primary schools, the pupils split up according to their abilities and intentions of career paths. Roughly 25% of all students attend lower and upper secondary schools leading, normally after 12 school years in total to the federal recognized matura or an academic Baccalaureate which grants access to all universities. The other students split in two or more school-types, depending on the canton, differing in the balance between theoretical and practical education. It is obligatory for all children to attend school for at least 9 years.\n\nThe first university in Switzerland was founded in 1460 in Basel, with a faculty of medicine. This place has a long tradition of chemical and medical research in Switzerland. In total, there are 12 Universities in Switzerland; ten of them are managed by the cantons, while two federal institutes of technology, ETHZ in Zurich and EPFL in Lausanne, are under the authority of the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation. In addition, there are seven regional associations of Universities for Applied Sciences (\"Fachhochschulen\") which require vocational education and a special \"Berufsmatura\", or a \"Fachmatura\" (a graduation by a \"Fachmittelschule\") to study. Switzerland has a high rate of foreign students in tertiary education including one of the highest in the world of doctoral level students.\n\nMany Nobel prizes have been awarded to Swiss scientists. More recently Vladimir Prelog, Heinrich Rohrer, Richard Ernst, Edmond Fischer, Rolf Zinkernagel, Didier Queloz, Michel Mayor, Kurt Wüthrich, and Jacques Dubochet have received nobel prizes in the sciences. In total, 113 Nobel Prize winners stand in relation to Switzerland and the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded nine times to organizations residing in Switzerland. Geneva hosts the world's largest particle physics laboratory, the CERN. Other important research centers are the Empa and Paul Scherrer Institute which belong to the ETH domain.\n\nThe obligatory school system usually includes primary education (\"Primarschule\" in German, \"école primaire\" in French, \"scuola primaria / elementare\" in Italian and \"scola primara\" in Romansh) and secondary education I (\"Sekundarschule\" or \"Sekundarstufe I\" in German, \"secondaire I\" in French and \"scuola secondaria / media\" in Italian and \"scola secundar\" in Romansh). Before that, children generally go to \"Kindergarten\", with one or two years is required in most cantons. In the Canton of Ticino, an optional, third year is available for three-year-old children. In some German speaking cantons kindergarten and the first one or two years may be combined into a \"Grundstufe\" or \"Basisstufe\" where they are all taught together in a single class. In French speaking cantons kindergarten is combined into a four-year \"cycle primaire 1\" or \"cycle 1\" which is followed by a four-year \"cycle primaire 2\" or \"cycle 2\" which completes their primary school.\n\nThe minimum age for primary school is about six years in all cantons but Obwalden, where it is five years and three months. The cantons Thurgau and Nidwalden allow five-year-olds to start primary school in exceptional cases. Primary school continues until grade four, five or six, depending on the school/canton. Any child can take part in school if they choose to, but pupils are separated depending on whether they speak French, German or Italian.\n\nAt around age 11–12, depending on which canton in Switzerland the child goes to school in, there \"could\" be a screening exam to decide how to separate the students for secondary school. Some cantons have a system of examination in the second semester of the final year of primary school, some cantons have an exam in second semester and continuous evaluation in both first and second semesters. In some cases, parents or legal guardians of the child are also asked for their recommendations (see Indicator C below) along with a self-evaluation done by the child. Parents' recommendation in combination with child's self-evaluation is called the third indicator (Indicator C) for evaluating the student, the first being teacher's evaluation (Indicator A), the second the results of tests (Indicator B) held in first semester. The fourth criteria is the final exam that takes place in the middle of the second semester of the final year primary school (usually held before Easter Break).\n\nAt the end of primary school (or at the beginning of secondary school), pupils are separated (see Indicator C for Fribourg under Primary School) according to their capacities and career-intentions in several (often three) sections for a period of 2–3 years (Sekundarschule) in either Pre-higher secondary school section, General section or Basic section (Basic may be called Realschule in German or Classe d'exigence de base in French). Students who aspire for an academic career enter \"Mittelschule\" (also named \"Gymnasium\", or \"Kantonsschule\", a public school by the canton/state) to be prepared for further studies and the Matura (normally obtained after 12 or 13 years of school usually at the age of 18 or 19). Students intending to pursue a trade or vocation complete three to four additional years before entering Vocational Educations which are regulated by federal law and are based on a cooperation of private business offering educational job-positions and public schools offering obligatory school-lessons complementary to the on-the-job education. This so-called \"dual system\" splitting academic and vocational training has its continuation in the higher education system. While the academic training leads to the matura and free admission to universities, successfully completed vocational education gives access to third level of practical education, the \"Höhere Fachschule (Schweiz)\". If in addition to the vocational training the \"Berufsmaturitätsschule\" is completed the Fachhochschule may be visited instead. Rather recently introduced is a third, middle path via the Fachmittelschule which leads to a direct access to a \"Fachhochschule\" after a successful graduation of a \"Fachmatura\". In some cantons, students with a \"Fachmatura\" may also get access to universities after a successful additional year. In the science literacy assessment of PISA, 15-year-old students in Switzerland had the 16th highest average score of 57 countries.\n\nIn the lower second level, there are several different teaching and school models that may exist. Some cantons define a specific model, while others allow the individual municipalities to determine which model to follow.\n\nPupils are allocated to institutionally separate school types, according to their performance levels. The structure is based on the principle of equal capacities among pupils. Generally, each school type has its own adapted curricula, teaching material, teachers and, in some cases, its own range of subjects. In general, there are 2 to 3 school types (4 in a minority of cantons), the names of which vary. In the structure with 2 school types, a distinction is made between the performance-based group at basic level (with the least demanding requirements), and the performance-based group at advanced level. In the structure with 3 school types, there is a performance-based group at basic level, a performance-based group at intermediate level and a performance-based group at advanced level. The requirements of the performance-based group at advanced level are the most demanding and this school type generally prepares pupils for transfer to the matura schools.\n\nThe cooperative model is based on core classes with different performance requirements. Each pupil is assigned to a core class according to his or her performance level. The pupils attend lessons in certain subjects in differentiated requirement-based groups (whereby the core classes are mixed).\n\nThe integrated model does not use different school types or core classes. Pupils with different performance levels attend the same class and mixing is maintained. In certain subjects, teaching occurs on differentiated requirement-based levels.\n\nAs of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC) listed Switzerland as having 105 international schools. ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms \"ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country’s national curriculum and is international in its orientation.\" This definition is used by publications including The Economist.\n\nSwitzerland was the birthplace of the International Baccalaureate in 1968 and 50 schools in Switzerland offer one or more of the IB programmes (Primary, Middle Years, Diploma and Career-related Programmes).\n\nTertiary education depends on the education chosen in secondary education. For students with a matura, university is the most common one. Apprentices who attended a vocational high school will often add a Fachhochschule or a Höhere Fachschule to their curriculum.\n\nThere are 14 public and generic universities in Switzerland, 10 of which are maintained at cantonal level and usually offer a range of non-technical subjects. Of the remaining 4 institutions, 2 are run by the Swiss Confederation and are known as \"Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology\".\n\nSwitzerland is well known for its advanced business education system. A number of world-class universities and MBA programmes, such as the International Institute for Management Development, HEC Lausanne, St. Gallen, Kalaidos FH and University of Zurich belong to that category. All of them are also registered in the Financial Times ranking. See also the list of universities in Switzerland.\n\nSwitzerland has a high rate of international students. In 2013, 16.9% of the total tertiary enrollment in Switzerland came from outside the country, a rate that is the 10th highest of the 291 countries included in the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. This rate was just higher than Austria (16.8) and just lower than the United Kingdom (17.5). However, due to the much smaller tertiary system in Switzerland their 47,000 foreign tertiary enrollments are dwarfed by much larger countries such as the United States (740,000), the United Kingdom (416,000), France (228,000) and Germany (196,000). Many international students attend Swiss universities for advanced degrees. In 2013 masters programs enrolled about 27% foreign students (fourth highest rate) and doctoral programs were 52% foreign (second behind Luxembourg).\n\nSwitzerland also has a high rate of PhD students and inhabitants with doctoral degrees. In 2014 Switzerland had the highest rate of inhabitants (2.98%) with doctoral degrees in the world. In 2010, with 2.5%, Switzerland had the second-highest rate of inhabitants with doctoral degrees in Europe. In 2008, the number of students graduating with a PhD was 3209 (up from 2822 in 2000) of which 45% were foreigners (up from 31% in 2000).\n\nIn 1995 Switzerland took part in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) assessment. TIMSS is an international assessment of the mathematics and science knowledge of fourth- and eighth-grade students around the world. It was developed by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) to allow participating nations to compare students' educational achievement across borders. In 1995, Switzerland was one of forty-one nations that participated in the study. They did not participate in later studies. Among 8th graders, Switzerland ranked 15th overall, 8th in math and 25th in science.\n\nA National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) study that used the TIMSS assessment among 12th graders found similar results. The Swiss students were in their upper secondary education and were attending either a gymnasium, general education, teacher training or advanced vocation training. In math, the Swiss scored a 540 (the average score was 500), and were 3rd out of 21. Their science score was 523, which was 8th out of 21. In physics, they scored 488 (the average was 501) and were tied for 9th place out of 16. The advanced mathematics score was 533 which was 3rd out of 16.\n\nThe World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report for 2010-11 ranked Switzerland as first overall. Under the fifth pillar of the report, \"Higher education and training\", the Swiss had a score of 5.79, which is the fourth highest among all the countries surveyed.\n\nWhile compulsory schooling in Switzerland is between 9 and 11 years long, many of the specifics of the system vary by canton. In most cases, kindergarten lasts 1 to 2 years, primary level lasts 6 years, and the lower secondary level 3 years. In Ticino, there is a third, non-mandatory, kindergarten year, primary lasts 5 years, followed by 4 years of lower secondary. In some German speaking cantons kindergarten and the first one or two years may be combined into a \"Grundstufe\" or \"Basisstufe\" where they are all taught together in a single class. In the French speaking cantons (FR, GE, JU, NE, VD, VS) kindergarten is combined with primary to create 2 primary levels, each 4 years long. In 17 cantons, it is compulsory to attend pre-school. In almost all cantons, the municipalities are obliged to provide at least one year of pre-school classes.\n\nThis table shows the school system for 2017/2018 and how the lower secondary schools are organized:\n\nDuring the 2008/09 school year there were 1,502,257 students in the entire Swiss educational system. In kindergarten or pre-school, there were 152,919 students (48.6% female). These students were taught by 13,592 teachers (96.0% female) in 4,949 schools, of which 301 were private schools. There were 777,394 students (48.6% female) in the obligatory schools, which include primary and lower secondary schools. These students were taught by 74,501 teachers (66.3% female) in 6,083 schools, of which 614 were private. The upper secondary school system had 337,145 students (46.9% female). They were taught by 13,900 teachers (42.3% female) in 730 schools, of which 240 were private. The tertiary education system had 234,799 students (49.7% female). They were taught by 37,546 teachers (32.8% female) in 367 schools.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1831371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831371", "title": "Cabrini University", "text": "Cabrini University\n\nCabrini University is a private Roman Catholic liberal arts university in Radnor Township, Pennsylvania. The college was founded by the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in 1957, and was named after the first American naturalized citizen saint, Mother Frances Cabrini. It was one of the first universities in the United States to make community service a graduation requirement for all undergraduates; it now has a core curriculum centered on social justice which includes their signature classes, Engagements in the Common Good, also known as ECG.\n\nThe site of the original Cabrini College was originally the estate of Dr. John T. Dorrance, inventor of the process of making condensed soup and president of the Campbell Soup Company. It was known as Woodcrest. Dorrance owned a stable with many horses, had social events within the main hall of his mansion, and also had personal servants. The property was purchased by the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (MSC) in 1953. It was first named \"Villa Cabrini\" after the organization's namesake, Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini. At first, Villa Cabrini was an orphanage.\n\nIn 1957, Sister Ursula Infante established a school in the villa. Upon opening, it was a female-only school of only thirty-seven students. The orphanage was still a part of the community and they shared the use of the buildings.\n\nThe first graduating class was in 1961. Also around this same time period, Cabrini was awarded full accreditation by the Middle States Association.\n\nIn the 1950s, Cabrini was only made up of a few buildings. The mansion of the college was the central point of the college, housing the students, providing a cafeteria, classrooms, library, and a chapel. In 1958, they converted the stable house, now known as Grace Hall, to include both classrooms and dormitories.\n\nIn 1960, Cabrini finished construction on the Sacred Heart Hall (now known as Founder's Hall), which was a library, cafeteria, gymnasium, and even held science laboratories. The 1960s also saw the construction of a chapel in 1961 and a library in 1965.\n\nThe early 1970s were a time of much change for the college. After Infante's ten-year presidency in 1967, three presidents were to follow in only three years. Sister Barbara Leonardo was president from 1967–68. During her time at the college, she was also a dean and taught history. In 1968, Sr. Gervase Lapadula became president, but soon had to resign due to health problems.\n\nFrom 1969–73, Sr. Regina Casey was president of Cabrini College. During her presidency, the college was starting to change from a girls-only to a co-educational establishment. Through a program with Eastern University, located next to the college, males started to attend classes at Cabrini. In turn, Cabrini students were offered more courses through both expansion and external courses at Eastern.\n\nEven more changes took place between 1972 and 1982.\nMost importantly, the school became completely coeducational.\n\nDuring Sister Eileen's presidency, political science, social work, and computer science programs were added and Xavier Hall, a 124-student residence hall, was built. The faculty voted to make community service a requirement for all students, and Cabrini was recognized as one of the first colleges in the country, and the first in Pennsylvania, to integrate community service into the core curriculum.\n\nToni Iadarola was the first lay president of Cabrini College. During her tenure, undergraduate enrollment increased from 732 to 1,700 and the number of resident students tripled. New and renovated buildings in this time included the Dixon Center, Founder's Hall, and the Center for Science, Education, and Technology (now the Antoinette Iadarola Center for Science, Education, and Technology).\n\nCabrini College garnered national attention when, in the midst of a national economic recession, it announced a tuition reduction of nearly 13%.\n\nDr. Don Taylor became Cabrini College's first male President on July 1, 2014. During his inaugural address on October 25, 2014, Dr. Taylor introduced the Cabrini 2020 Roadmap to Growth. This plan is a means to measure the college's progress, as the following are promised to have occurred by 2020. The initiative promises to have 100 percent of undergraduate students participating in a Living & Learning Community, pledges all undergraduate students will experience two or more High-Impact Coeducational Practices in their first year and denotes a commitment to ensuring all students encounter at least four of these High-Impact practices before they are graduated by the college.\nUnder Taylor's leadership, Cabrini College changed its name to Cabrini University on July 1, 2016.\n\nCabrini University offers 40 undergraduate majors, additional minors, and specialized tracks. The institutional also offers part-time graduate degrees in Accounting, Biological Sciences, Data Science, Education, and Leadership. In 2016, it started two new part-time doctoral programs for working professionals: EdD in Educational Leadership and PhD in Organizational Development.\n\nAll undergraduate students participate in the university's core curriculum, \"Justice Matters\", in which, the university asserts, \"students learn skills that will advance their careers and that can be used for the benefit of their communities, linking theory to practice in the world, preparing them for professional careers through a rigorous liberal learning experience.\"\nThe curriculum drives to raise awareness of social problems, involve students hands-on in social justice issues, to teach students to see themselves as participating in value-driven decision making, and to develop liberally educated persons.\n\nCabrini University was one of the first universities in the United States to make community service a graduation requirement for all undergraduates.\n\nCabrini is ranked 122nd in the Regional Universities (North) category by US News & World Report for 2018.\n\nCabrini University has its own student-run variety radio station.\n\n\"The Loquitur\" has been the student-run newspaper of Cabrini University since 1959. The paper is now printed on a monthly basis, featuring on and off campus news, lifestyles, sports and perspective pieces. \"The Loquitur\" is celebrating its 60th anniversary during the 2018-19 academic year.\n\nCabrini University has 19 varsity teams and various recreational sports clubs. The teams compete in the NCAA Division III, ECAC and the Atlantic East Conference (AEC). Cabrini is known for their men’s lacrosse team which won the NCAA Division III National Championship in 2019 against Amherst College at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\n"}

It opened numerous overseas branches during the World War I era as the Sumitomo \"zaibatsu\" business globalized.\n\nAfter World War II, the Sumitomo group was dismantled and its constituent companies were forbidden from using the Sumitomo name. The bank renamed itself Osaka Bank in October 1948. In December 1952, its name was changed back to Sumitomo Bank. Sumitomo was the main bank for several major Japanese manufacturers during the early postwar era, including NEC and Panasonic (Matsushita).\n\nIn the 1970s, it lost nearly $1 billion in the restructuring of Osaka-based general trading company Ataka & Co., which, combined with the contemporaneous bailout of Mazda, had a major impact on Sumitomo's finances, driving it down from the most profitable bank in Japan to being only ninth-ranked. However, the Ataka and Mazda bailouts enhanced Sumitomo's industry reputation by showing its dedication to customers. It became the largest Japanese bank by deposits until the merger of Dai-Ichi Bank and Nippon Kangyo Bank to form Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.\n\nIn 1986, Sumitomo merged with Heiwa Sogo Bank in order to expand its presence in the Tokyo area. In the same year, it acquired 12.5% of Goldman Sachs.\n\nSumitomo incurred major losses during the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in the 1990s. In 1993 it wrote off 100 billion yen in bad loans, and in 1994 its Nagoya branch manager was murdered in possible connection with a bad debt collection. In 1995, it posted the first net loss of a major Japanese bank in the postwar era. It sold Sumitomo Bank of California, the sixth-largest bank in California, at a steep discount to Zions Bancorporation in 1998 (SBC is now part of California Bank and Trust).\n\nIn 1999, amid intensifying competition as other Japanese and foreign banks consolidated, Sumitomo announced its merger with Sakura Bank to form Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. The merger was approved in June 2000 and combined Sakura's strong retail operation and eastern Japan presence with Sumitomo's strong wholesale operation and western Japan presence. The merger created the world's third-largest banking group at the time, after Deutsche Bank and the pending merger that would form Mizuho Bank.\n\nSumitomo's SWIFT code was \"SMITJPJT.\"\n\n"}

Nineteen-year-old Fynn takes Anna home to his mother, who takes her in, though Fynn becomes Anna's main caretaker and closest friend. Fynn recounts his time spent with Anna, and gives a very personal account of her outpourings on life, mathematics, science and her mentor, Mister God. The sequels of \"Mister God, This Is Anna\" are \"Anna's Book\" (1986), and \"Anna and the Black Knight\" (1990).\n\nThe book was reissued by HarperCollins in 2005 with a Foreword by Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nThe story begins on the streets of the East End of London in the mid-1930s. While roaming the docks at night, the author comes across a small girl sitting on the grating below a shop window. He sits down next to her, and engages her in conversation. Unable to find out where she came from, Fynn takes the child home, only to discover she is an abused runaway. She spends her next three years as Fynn's inseparable companion.\n\nThe book gives an account of their friendship. Anna by nature is the inquisitor, the forever probing creature who likes to find a reason for everything. Fynn, a student, tries to follow her hard-to-understand, yet simple logic. Philosophical questions are investigated through the eyes of a child, who proposes simple, common-sense solutions. Many of the conversations involve religion, with Anna personalising God, calling him \"Mister God\".\n\n\"At five years Anna knew absolutely the purpose of being, knew the meaning of love and was a personal friend and helper of Mister God. At six Anna was a theologian, mathematician, philosopher, poet and gardener. If you asked her a question you would always get an answer – in due course. On some occasions the answer would be delayed for weeks or months; but eventually, in her own good time, the answer would come: direct, simple and much to the point.\"\n\nAnna is involved with everything. The gist of the book is the philosophy of a child who has the wisdom to comprehend more than what would be expected of her. \n\nThe ending of the book describes Anna's death at age seven after falling from a tree and Fynn's profound grief. \"She never made eight years, she died by an accident. She died with a grin on her beautiful face. She died saying, 'I bet Mister God lets me get into heaven for this'.\" Fynn experiences a period of angst, blaming God, but when he visits Anna's grave and sees it to be a riot of flowers, he lets go of his anger against God. The answer, he realizes, is \"Anna is in my middle\". This particular reference is to a conversation between Anna and Fynn. God is part of everybody and everybody is part of God. Fynn walks away from her graveyard with renewed hope. \n\nThe sequels to \"Mister God, This Is Anna\" are \"Anna's Book\" (1986), and \"Anna and the Black Knight\" (1990).\n\nHopkins, as a teenager and young adult, lived in the East End of London in the early 1930s. He was briefly drawn towards the politics of Oswald Mosley, but soon became disillusioned. He won a scholarship to a local grammar school, Cooper's Company College, London E3, and left aged 15 to work for The Russian Oil and Petroleum Company, where he had aspirations of becoming a research chemist. Following a fall off a cliff he suffered chronic insomnia and in 1939 was referred to Finchden Manor in Kent, a therapeutic community run by George Lyward O.B.E., and later joined the staff.\n\nTheologian Vernon Sproxton commented that Hopkins' \"most formative thinking took place far from the quads and colleges and punted rivers amongst the small streets, warehouses, and canals of the East End. But with his modest job and his Woolworth's do-it-yourself laboratory he produced thought to which few PhD's have approximated.\"\n\nIt is not clear to what extent the story is autobiographical, and how much is fictional.\nIn his preface to both the British and American editions of the book, Vernon Sproxton remarks that he has seen Anna's drawings and notes and that he believes her to be real.\n\nThere is some uncertainty about Syd's age on first encountering Anna. Early editions of the book say he was nineteen, but this would be impossible if he was to know Anna for 3 years before the outbreak of war, and in the latest editions of \"Mister God, This Is Anna\" his age has been amended to sixteen.\n\n\n"}

Olin Foundation was a conservative American grant-making foundation established in 1953 by John M. Olin, president of the Olin Industries chemical and munitions manufacturing businesses. Unlike most other foundations, it was charged to spend all of its assets within a generation of Olin's death, for fear of mission drift over time and to preserve donor intent. It made its last grant in the summer of 2005 and officially disbanded on November 29, 2005. It had disbursed over $370 million in funding, primarily to conservative think tanks, media outlets, and law programs at influential universities. It is most notable for its early support and funding of the law and economics movement and the Federalist Society. \"All in all, the Federalist Society has been one of the best investments the foundation ever made,\" wrote the Foundation to its trustees in 2003.\n\nAccording to the official website, \"the general purpose of the John M. Olin Foundation is to provide support for projects that reflect or are intended to strengthen the economic, political and cultural institutions upon which the American heritage of constitutional government and private enterprise is based. The Foundation also seeks to promote a general understanding of these institutions by encouraging the thoughtful study of the connections between economic and political freedoms, and the cultural heritage that sustains them.\"\n\nThe fund was largely inactive until 1969, when John M. Olin was disturbed by the Willard Straight Hall takeover at his alma mater, Cornell University. At the age of 80, he decided that he must pour his time and resources into preserving the free market system.\n\nThe Foundation is most notable for its early support and funding of the law and economics movement, a discipline that applies incentive-based thinking and cost-benefit analysis to the field of legal theory. Olin believed that law schools have a disproportionately large impact on society given their size and to this end decided to focus the majority of his funding there.\n\nThe executive director of the Foundation in its early years was conservative activist Michael S. Joyce, who left to head the similar Bradley Foundation. William E. Simon, a leverage buyout pioneer who was United States Secretary of the Treasury under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, was president of the Foundation from 1977 until his death in 2000. He frequently discussed the foundation's commitment to supporting the \"counter-intelligentsia\". Conservative scholar James Piereson was the last executive director and secretary.\n\nThe foundation supported conservative thinkers such as Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute; Mac Donald is the \"John M. Olin Fellow\" at this New York City-based institution. In 2005, following longstanding plans, the foundation announced its final grants and closed its doors. The foundation closed in the same year as the Franklin W. Olin Foundation, which was established by John Olin's father, Franklin W. Olin. The Franklin W. Olin Foundation also shut down for donor intent reasons, but the two foundations were entirely independent and unrelated, except for the family connection of their founders.\n\nAccording to the Philanthropy Roundtable, the Olin Foundation \"dispensed hundreds of millions of dollars to scholars, think tanks, publications, and other organizations\" and \"shaped the direction and aided the growth of the modern conservative movement that first sprang into visibility in the 1980s.\" According to the \"New York Observer\", the Foundation distributed \"grants to conservative think tanks and intellectuals-the architects of today’s sprawling right-wing movement-for a quarter-century.\"\n\n\nThere are several dozen John M. Olin Professors at universities and law schools around the world, including:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1831462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831462", "title": "Hollister Ranch", "text": "Hollister Ranch\n\nHollister Ranch is of fallow and fertile fields, mountains and valleys along the Pacific coast of California between Gaviota State Park and Point Conception. It was the site of some of the oldest known human settlements in the new world, the last native population of which was the Chumash. The Spanish Portolà expedition, the first European land explorers of California, traveled along its coast in 1769. It became part of the extensive Spanish land grant known as Rancho Nuestra Señora del Refugio, operated by the family of José Francisco Ortega from 1794.\n\nThe land was purchased by William Welles Hollister after the Civil War as part of a large acquisition, the center of which was at Glen Annie, Tecolotito canyon. It continues to be privately owned, and is one of the last remaining undeveloped coastal areas in Southern California. There have been conflicts over public access to coastal parts of the ranch for nearly 40 years. Beaches along the Ranch remain technically open to the public per California state law, but access is difficult because the ranch itself is protected private property.\n\nA cattle ranch since the days of the Ortegas, Hollister Ranch is the fourth largest cattle ranch in Santa Barbara County having shipped over of beef in the summer of 2005. As a result of the Hollister Ranch Owners' Association CC&Rs, Santa Barbara County zoning and California's Agricultural Preserve Program, when fully built out, over 98% of the property will continue to be devoted to well managed cattle grazing. Other benefits to Hollister Ranch owners as a result of the cattle operation include a reduced fuel load in the event of range fire and the tax benefits that result from adherence to the restrictions imposed by the Uniform Rules of the Agricultural Preserve. Relative to the land prices for parcels in Hollister Ranch, however, the cattle ranching is probably uneconomic, and may continue largely for the sake of fuel load management for fire protection, Agricultural Preserve tax consequences and aesthetic considerations.\n\nThe Hollister family, previous owners of the property, allowed some recreational use of the area. In the late 1950s, they granted a pass to the regional Sportsman Hunting Club, which later split into several smaller clubs, including the Santa Barbara Surf Club. During over a decade of regular use, the Santa Barbara Surf Club discovered and named many surfing spots off the coast of 8 miles (13 km) of beach, such as Razor Blades, Drake's, Little Drake's, Utah, Rights and Lefts, St. Augustine, Lefts and Rights, and on the adjacent Bixby Ranch land, Cojo Point, Perko's Point, and Government Point.\n\nToday recreational use of the beach and surrounding area is restricted to both the owners of the Hollister and Bixby Ranches, and the public, who access the area by foot along the beach and by boat in the offshore waters. For decades the boat launch at Gaviota Pier allowed unfettered access to all Californians and visitors to the state tidelands all the way up to Point Conception. The launch was disabled about five years ago. The restoration of the public access it provided, is currently held up by the California Coastal Commission. California law allows public access to all land below the mean high tide line, and many surfers, divers, and fisherman access the State waters by boating or walking in from Gaviota State Park on the east and Jalama County Park on the west. The area is generally called \"The Ranch\" by surfers, divers, and fishermen.\n\nMany associated with the present Hollister Ranch describe themselves as responsible stewards of the land, ardently claiming to have worked out a successful formula balancing ecological preservation with residential development which functions within both a working commercial agricultural operation and a healthy natural habitat with a wide range of flora and fauna. The Hollister Ranch Association long term practice of a \"formal beach driving program\" has been described by the California Coastal Commission as “degrading [to] beach habitats and the natural coastline” and against the law. The ranch rules were amended to prohibit beach driving in 2018. The working cattle operation that has shipped as much as 1,000,000 pounds of beef in a good and rainy year has been criticized as primarily existing for tax-front purposes and as being subsidized by the owners. Regardless of the fact that cattle have continuously grazed at Hollister Ranch since the 1860s, some environmentalists note the potential impact such an operation could have on native flora and fauna. The ranch has also been criticized for precluding public access over private property to beaches, in alleged conflict with California state law. A sharp difference of opinion exists between Ranch owners, who describe the pristine nature of the Ranch after 45 years as an owners' association versus government officials and the public, some of whom view Ranch policies as exclusivist and disingenuous.\n\nIn 2004, the National Park Service abandoned a proposal to designate parts of the Gaviota coastline, including the seashore in front of Hollister Ranch, as a national seashore. Local landowners, especially those in Hollister Ranch, mounted a lobbying campaign to oppose the study. In addition to others in Santa Barbara County who, after learning of the proposed designation, hired advocates to oppose the National Seashore, the Hollister Ranch Owners' Association assessed its members to hire a former congressman to lobby against the National Seashore proposal.\n\nPrevious projects proposed since the 1970s have included oil development, a nuclear power plant and high-density housing.\n\nFor over twenty years Santa Barbara-area grade school children have been encouraged to participate (at no cost to the schools) in the Hollister Ranch Conservancy's \"Tidepool Classroom\" that preserves intertidal life forms not found elsewhere along the coast.\n\n\n"}

Unlike most major annual meteor showers, there is no sharp peak for this shower, but rather a broad maximum with good rates that last approximately one week centered on May 5. The meteors we currently see as members of the Eta Aquariid shower separated from Halley's Comet hundreds of years ago. The current orbit of Halley's Comet does not pass close enough to the Earth to be a source of meteoric activity.\n\nAlthough this shower is not as spectacular as the Leonids may be and well below the rates of the Perseids or the Geminids, it is not an ordinary event. The Eta Aquariids get their name because their radiant appears to lie in the constellation Aquarius, near one of the constellation's brightest stars, Eta Aquarii. The shower peaks at about a rate of around a meteor per minute, although such rates are rarely seen from northern latitudes due to the low altitude of the radiant.\n\nThe Eta Aquariids are best viewed in the pre-dawn hours away from the glow of city lights. For northern observers, the radiant of the shower is only above the horizon for the few hours before dawn, and early-rising observers are often rewarded with rates that climb as the radiant rises before sunrise. The shower is best viewed from the equator to 30 degrees south latitude.\n\nThe activity is fairly constant from one return to the next. However, in 2013, the maximum ZHR exceeded the average level significantly for about two days. An explanation was presented by Mikiya Sato\n(Sato & Watanabe, 2013), showing that the meteoroids are from very old ejection from the parent 1P/Halley and are trapped probably in resonances to Jupiter's orbit (similar to the Orionids observed between 2007 and 2010). The peak ZHR reached 135 ± 16. Updated information on the expected time and rates of the shower is provided through the annual IMO Meteor Shower Calendar.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1831479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831479", "title": "Switch statement", "text": "Switch statement\n\nIn computer programming languages, a switch statement is a type of selection control mechanism used to allow the value of a variable or expression to change the control flow of program execution via search and map.\n\nSwitch statements function somewhat similarly to the codice_1 statement used in programming languages like C/C++, C#, Visual Basic .NET, Java and exists in most high-level imperative programming languages such as Pascal, Ada, C/C++, C#, Visual Basic .NET, Java, and in many other types of language, using such keywords as codice_2, codice_3, codice_4 or codice_5.\n\nSwitch statements come in two main variants: a structured switch, as in Pascal, which takes exactly one branch, and an unstructured switch, as in C, which functions as a type of goto. The main reasons for using a switch include improving clarity, by reducing otherwise repetitive coding, and (if the heuristics permit) also offering the potential for faster execution through easier compiler optimization in many cases.\n\nIn his 1952 text \"Introduction to Metamathematics\", Stephen Kleene formally proved that the CASE function (the IF-THEN-ELSE function being its simplest form) is a primitive recursive function, where he defines the notion codice_6 in the following manner:\n\nKleene provides a proof of this in terms of the Boolean-like recursive functions \"sign-of\" sg( ) and \"not sign of\" ~sg( ) (Kleene 1952:222-223); the first returns 1 if its input is positive and −1 if its input is negative.\n\nBoolos-Burgess-Jeffrey make the additional observation that \"definition by cases\" must be both mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. They too offer a proof of the primitive recursiveness of this function (Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey 2002:74-75).\n\nThe IF-THEN-ELSE is the basis of the McCarthy formalism: its usage replaces both primitive recursion and the mu-operator.\n\nIn most languages, programmers write a switch statement across many individual lines using one or two keywords. A typical syntax involves:\n\n\nEach alternative begins with the particular value, or list of values (see below), that the control variable may match and which will cause the control to goto the corresponding sequence of statements. The value (or list/range of values) is usually separated from the corresponding statement sequence by a colon or by an implication arrow. In many languages, every case must also be preceded by a keyword such as codice_3 or codice_11.\n\nAn optional default case is typically also allowed, specified by a codice_12, codice_13, or codice_14 keyword. This executes when none of the other cases match the control expression. In some languages, such as C, if no case matches and the codice_12 is omitted the codice_2 statement simply exits. In others, like PL/I, an error is raised.\n\nSemantically, there are two main forms of switch statements.\n\nThe first form are structured switches, as in Pascal, where exactly one branch is taken, and the cases are treated as separate, exclusive blocks. This functions as a generalized if–then–else conditional, here with any number of branches, not just two.\n\nThe second form are unstructured switches, as in C, where the cases are treated as labels within a single block, and the switch functions as a generalized goto. This distinction is referred to as the treatment of fallthrough, which is elaborated below.\n\nIn many languages, only the matching block is executed, and then execution continues at the end of the switch statement. These include the Pascal family (Object Pascal, Modula, Oberon, Ada, etc.) as well as PL/I, modern forms of Fortran and BASIC dialects influenced by Pascal, most functional languages, and many others. To allow multiple values to execute the same code (and avoid needing to duplicate code), Pascal-type languages permit any number of values per case, given as a comma-separated list, as a range, or as a combination.\n\nLanguages derived from C language, and more generally those influenced by Fortran's computed GOTO, instead feature fallthrough, where control moves to the matching case, and then execution continues (\"falls through\") to the statements associated with the \"next\" case in the source text. This also allows multiple values to match the same point without any special syntax: they are just listed with empty bodies. Values can be special conditioned with code in the case body. In practice, fallthrough is usually prevented with a codice_8 keyword at the end of the matching body, which exits execution of the switch block, but this can cause bugs due to unintentional fallthrough if the programmer forgets to insert the codice_8 statement. This is thus seen by many as a language wart, and warned against in some lint tools. Syntactically, the cases are interpreted as labels, not blocks, and the switch and break statements explicitly change control flow. Some languages influenced by C, such as JavaScript, retain default fallthrough, while others remove fallthrough, or only allow it in special circumstances. Notable variations on this in the C-family include C#, in which all blocks must be terminated with a codice_8 or codice_20 unless the block is empty (i.e. fallthrough is used as a way to specify multiple values).\n\nIn some cases languages provide optional fallthrough. For example, Perl does not fall through by default, but a case may explicitly do so using a codice_21 keyword. This prevents unintentional fallthrough but allows it when desired. Similarly, bash defaults to not falling through, when terminated with ;; but more recent versions allow fallthrough with ;& instead.\n\nAn example of a switch statement that relies on fallthrough is Duff's device.\n\nOptimizing compilers such as GCC or Clang may compile a switch statement into either a branch table or a binary search through the values in the cases.\nA branch table allows the switch statement to determine with a small, constant number of instructions which branch to execute without having to go through a list of comparisons, while a binary search takes only a logarithmic number of comparisons, measured in the number of cases in the switch statement.\n\nNormally, the only method of finding out if this optimization has occurred is by actually looking at the resultant assembly or machine code output that has been generated by the compiler.\n\nIn some languages and programming environments, the use of a codice_3 or codice_2 statement is considered superior to an equivalent series of \"if else if\" statements because it is:\n\n\nAdditionally, an optimized implementation may execute much faster than the alternative, because it is often implemented by using an indexed branch table. For example, deciding program flow based on a single character's value, if correctly implemented, is vastly more efficient than the alternative, reducing instruction path lengths considerably. When implemented as such, a switch statement essentially becomes a perfect hash.\n\nIn terms of the control flow graph, a switch statement consists of two nodes (entrance and exit), plus one edge between them for each option. By contrast, a sequence of \"if...else if...else if\" statements has an additional node for every case other than the first and last, together with a corresponding edge. The resulting control flow graph for the sequences of \"if\"s thus has many more nodes and almost twice as many edges, with these not adding any useful information. However, the simple branches in the if statements are individually conceptually easier than the complex branch of a switch statement. In terms of cyclomatic complexity, both of these options increase it by \"k\"−1 if given \"k\" cases.\n\nMany languages evaluate expressions inside codice_2 blocks at runtime, allowing a number of less obvious uses for the construction. This prohibits certain compiler optimizations, so is more common in dynamic and scripting languages where the enhanced flexibility is more important than the performance overhead.\n\nFor example, in PHP, a constant can be used as the \"variable\" to check against, and the first case statement which evaluates to that constant will be executed:\n\nswitch(true) {\nswitch(5) {\n\nThis feature is also useful for checking multiple variables against one value rather than one variable against many values. COBOL also supports this form (and others forms) in the codice_25 statement. PL/I has an alternative form of the codice_26 statement where the control expression is omitted altogether and the first codice_27 that evaluates to \"true\" is executed.\n\nIn Ruby, due to its handling of codice_28 equality, the statement can be used to test for variable’s class:\ncase input\nwhen Array then puts 'input is an Array!'\nwhen Hash then puts 'input is a Hash!'\nend\nRuby also returns a value that can be assigned to a variable, and doesn’t actually require the codice_3 to have any parameters (acting a bit like an codice_30 statement):\ncatfood =\n\nA switch statement in assembly language:\n\nswitch:\na:\nb:\nswtend:\n\nA number of languages implement a form of switch statement in exception handling, where if an exception is raised in a block, a separate branch is chosen, depending on the exception. In some cases a default branch, if no exception is raised, is also present. An early example is Modula-3, which use the codice_31...codice_32 syntax, where each codice_32 defines a case. This is also found in Delphi, Scala, and Visual Basic.NET.\n\nSome alternatives to switch statements can be:\n\n\n\n"}

He is currently a radio broadcaster for the New York Mets on WCBS. Previously, Rose called play-by-play for the New York Rangers and New York Islanders.\n\nRose was born in Brooklyn, New York into a Jewish family. He attended PS 205Q (The Alexander Graham Bell School), Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Bayside, Queens, and graduated from Queens College in 1977. He lives on Long Island in Woodbury, New York with his wife and two daughters. His oldest daughter, Alyssa, was an actress who appeared on the soap opera \"One Life to Live\", had two separate podcasts, called Scoring Position and Drunk Love, and currently works for Sportsnet New York.\n\nRose started his career doing sports updates on New York City-based Sports Phone, a telephone dial-in service, during the mid-1970s, which led to sports updates on news radio station WCBS-AM through the early 1980s.\n\nRose has called Mets play-by-play on radio or television since 1995, and is regarded by fans and media outlets alike as an expert of Mets history. He has previously hosted the \"Mets Extra\" pre- and post-game shows. He worked the television booth until the retirement of long-time Mets radio voice Bob Murphy in 2003. The following year, Rose took Murphy's spot alongside Gary Cohen on WFAN. Cohen became the play-by-play broadcaster on then-new Mets television network SportsNet New York starting during the 2006 season, sharing the radio booth with partner Tom McCarthy. In 2008, Wayne Hagin replaced McCarthy, and from 2012-2018, Rose called games with Josh Lewin. As of 2019, Howie calls games with Wayne Randazzo. From 2014-2018 he called games on WOR, before moving to WCBS in 2019. He has also co-hosted MLB Now, joining Brian Kenny, Mark DeRosa, and Ken Rosenthal on MLB Network.\n\nRose has also been the master of the ceremonies during key Mets events, including Opening Day at Shea Stadium and Citi Field since 2004. He has hosted ceremonies marking the opening of Citi Field in 2009, the 40th anniversary of the Mets 1969 World Series victory, a special pregame ceremony honoring Ralph Kiner in 2008, and Mike Piazza's number retirement ceremony in 2016.\n\nRose's end-of-game catchphrase is, \"Put it in the books\", used after the final out is recorded in a Mets win. After Mets losses, Rose says \"and the ballgame is over\". When he uses the phrasing \"and the Mets are leading by a score of _ to _\", he is using the same diction as original Mets broadcaster Lindsey Nelson.\n\nRose worked as a play-by-play radio announcer for the New York Rangers, and was paired mainly with Sal Messina. He is most recognized by Rangers fans for his call of \"\"Matteau! Matteau! Matteau!\"\" made when Stéphane Matteau scored the game-winning goal in double-overtime of Game 7 of the 1994 NHL Eastern Conference Finals against the New Jersey Devils en route to the Stanley Cup Finals. The Rangers would go on to win the cup that year over the Vancouver Canucks 4 games to 3, their first Stanley Cup victory in 54 years.\n\nRose was the play-by-play announcer for Islanders telecasts where he worked alongside Butch Goring. For the season, Rose's work was simulcast on radio as well. Rose replaced Jiggs McDonald on Islanders broadcasts in and was previously partnered with Ed Westfall, Joe Micheletti, and Billy Jaffe.\n\nAfter the 2015-2016 season, Rose announced he would not return to call Islanders games after the end of the season.\n\nRose was the original prime-time radio host on WFAN when the station went all-sports in 1987, hosting the program until 1995. Rose occasionally worked games for \"Fox NHL Saturday\" in the mid-1990s, and now works for \"Fox Saturday Baseball\". He has also called Long Island Blackbirds basketball and soccer.\n\nOn March 1, 2013, his book \"Put it in the Book\" was released. The book is an autobiography and memoir of 50 years of Mets history. The book was co-written with Phil Pepe.\n\nIn 2012, Rose was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. He has won two Emmy awards for excellence in broadcasting for the New York Islanders. In 2019, it was announced that Howie would be inducted into the New York Baseball Hall of Fame. \n\n"}
{"id": "1831487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831487", "title": "Eddy current brake", "text": "Eddy current brake\n\nAn eddy current brake, also known as an induction brake, electric brake or electric retarder, is a device used to slow or stop a moving object by dissipating its kinetic energy as heat. However, unlike friction brakes, in which the drag force that stops the moving object is provided by friction between two surfaces pressed together, the drag force in an eddy current brake is an electromagnetic force between a magnet and a nearby conductive object in relative motion, due to eddy currents induced in the conductor through electromagnetic induction. \n\nA conductive surface moving past a stationary magnet develops circular electric currents called eddy currents induced in it by the magnetic field, as described by Faraday's law of induction. By Lenz's law, the circulating currents create their own magnetic field that opposes the field of the magnet. Thus the moving conductor experiences a drag force from the magnet that opposes its motion, proportional to its velocity. The kinetic energy of the moving object is dissipated as heat generated by the current flowing through the electrical resistance of the conductor. \n\nIn an eddy current brake the magnetic field may be created by a permanent magnet or an electromagnet, so the braking force can be turned on and off or varied by varying the electric current in the electromagnet windings. Another advantage is that since the brake does not work by friction, there are no brake shoe surfaces to wear out, necessitating replacement, as with friction brakes. A disadvantage is that since the braking force is proportional to the relative velocity of the brake, the brake has \"no holding force\" when the moving object is stationary, as is provided by static friction in a friction brake, so in vehicles it must be supplemented by a friction brake. \n\nEddy current brakes are used to slow high-speed trains and roller coasters, as a complement for friction brakes in semi-trailer trucks to help prevent brake wear and overheating, to stop powered tools quickly when power is turned off, and in electric meters used by electric utilities.\n\nAn eddy current brake consists of a conductive piece of metal, either a straight bar or a disk, which moves through the magnetic field of a magnet, either a permanent magnet or an electromagnet. When it moves past the stationary magnet, the magnet exerts a drag force on the metal which opposes its motion, due to circular electric currents called eddy currents induced in the metal by the magnetic field. Note that the conductive sheet is not made of ferromagnetic metal such as iron or steel; usually copper or aluminum are used, which are not attracted to a magnet. The brake does not work by the simple attraction of a ferromagnetic metal to the magnet. \n\nSee the diagram at right. It shows a metal sheet \"(C)\" moving to the right under a magnet. The magnetic field \"(B, green arrows)\" of the magnet's north pole \"N\" passes down through the sheet. Since the metal is moving, the magnetic flux through sheet is changing. At the part of the sheet under the leading edge of the magnet \"(left side)\" the magnetic field through the sheet is increasing as it gets nearer the magnet. From Faraday's law of induction, this field induces a counterclockwise flow of electric current \"(I, red)\", in the sheet. This is the eddy current. In contrast, at the trailing edge of the magnet \"(right side)\" the magnetic field through the sheet is decreasing, inducing a clockwise eddy current in the sheet.\n\nAnother way to understand the action is to see that the free charge carriers (electrons) in the metal sheet are moving to the right, so the magnetic field exerts a sideways force on them due to the Lorentz force. Since the velocity v of the charges is to the right and the magnetic field B is directed down, from the right hand rule the Lorentz force on positive charges \"qv×B\" is toward the rear in the diagram (to the left when facing in the direction of motion of the sheet) This causes a current \"I\" toward the rear under the magnet, which circles around through parts of the sheet outside the magnetic field in two currents, clockwise to the right and counterclockwise to the left, to the front of the magnet again. The mobile charge carriers in the metal, the electrons, actually have a negative charge, so their motion is opposite in direction to the conventional current shown. \n\nDue to Ampere's circuital law, each of these circular currents creates a counter magnetic field (\"blue arrows\"), which due to Lenz's law opposes the change in magnetic field, causing a drag force on the sheet which is the braking force exerted by the brake. At the leading edge of the magnet \"(left side)\" by the right hand rule the counterclockwise current creates a magnetic field pointed up, opposing the magnet's field, causing a repulsive force between the sheet and the leading edge of the magnet. In contrast, at the trailing edge \"(right side)\", the clockwise current causes a magnetic field pointed down, in the same direction as the magnet's field, creating an attractive force between the sheet and the trailing edge of the magnet. Both of these forces oppose the motion of the sheet. The kinetic energy which is consumed overcoming this drag force is dissipated as heat by the currents flowing through the resistance of the metal, so the metal gets warm under the magnet. \n\nThe braking force of an eddy current brake is exactly proportional to the velocity \"V\", so it acts similar to viscous friction in a liquid. The braking force decreases as the velocity decreases. When the conductive sheet is stationary, the magnetic field through each part of it is constant, not changing with time, so no eddy currents are induced, and there is no force between the magnet and the conductor. Thus an eddy current brake has no holding force. \n\nEddy current brakes come in two geometries: \nThe physical working principle is the same for both.\n\nDisk electromagnetic brakes are used on vehicles such as trains, and power tools such as circular saws, to stop the blade quickly when the power is turned off. A disk eddy current brake consists of a conductive non-ferromagnetic metal disc (rotor) attached to the axle of the vehicle's wheel, with an electromagnet located with its poles on each side of the disk, so the magnetic field passes through the disk. The electromagnet allows the braking force to be varied. When no current is passed through the electromagnet's winding, there is no braking force. When the driver steps on the brake pedal, current is passed through the electromagnet windings, creating a magnetic field, The larger the current in the winding, the larger the eddy currents and the stronger the braking force. Power tool brakes use permanent magnets, which are moved adjacent to the disk by a linkage when the power is turned off. The kinetic energy of the vehicle's motion is dissipated in Joule heating by the eddy currents passing through the disk's resistance, so like conventional friction disk brakes, the disk becomes hot. Unlike in the linear brake below, the metal of the disk passes repeatedly through the magnetic field, so disk eddy current brakes get hotter than linear eddy current brakes. \n\nJapanese Shinkansen trains had employed circular eddy current brake system on trailer cars since 100 Series Shinkansen. However, N700 Series Shinkansen abandoned eddy current brakes in favour of regenerative brakes, since 14 of the 16 cars in the trainset used electric motors. In regenerative brakes, the motor that drives the wheel is used as a generator to produce electric current, which can be used to charge a battery, so the energy can be used again.\n\nMost chassis dynamometers and many engine dynos use an eddy-current brake as a means of providing an electrically adjustable load on the engine. They are often referred to as an \"absorber\" in such applications. \n\nInexpensive air-cooled versions are typically used on chassis dynamometers, where their inherently high-inertia steel rotors are an asset rather than a liability. Conversely, performance engine dynamometers tend to utilize low-inertia, high RPM, liquid-cooled configurations. Downsides of eddy-current absorbers in such applications, compared to expensive AC-motor based dynamometers, is their inability to provide stall-speed (zero RPM) loading or to motor the engine - for starting or motoring (downhill simulation). \n\nAlso, since they do not actually absorb energy, provisions to transfer their radiated heat out of the test cell area must typically be provided. Either a high-volume air-ventilation or water-to-air heat exchanger adds additional cost and complexity. In contrast, the high-end AC-motor dynamometers cleanly return the engine's power to the grid.\n\nLinear eddy current brakes are used on some vehicles that ride on rails, such as trains. They are used on roller coasters, to stop the cars smoothly at the end of the ride.\n\nThe linear eddy current brake consists of a magnetic yoke with electrical coils positioned along the rail, which are being magnetized alternating as south and north magnetic poles. This magnet does not touch the rail, but is held at a constant small distance from the rail of approximately 7 mm (the eddy current brake should not be confused with another device, the magnetic brake, in wide use in railways, which exerts its braking force by friction of a brake shoe with the rail). It works the same as a disk eddy current brake, by inducing closed loops of eddy current in the conductive rail, which generate counter magnetic fields which oppose the motion of the train. \n\nThe kinetic energy of the moving vehicle is converted to heat by the eddy current flowing through the electrical resistance of the rail, which leads to a warming of the rail. An advantage of the linear brake is that since each section of rail passes only once through the magnetic field of the brake, in contrast to the disk brake in which each section of the disk passes repeatedly through the brake, the rail doesn't get as hot as a disk, so the linear brake can dissipate more energy and have a higher power rating than disk brakes.\n\nThe eddy current brake does not have any mechanical contact with the rail, and thus no wear, and creates no noise or odor. The eddy current brake is unusable at low speeds, but can be used at high speeds both for emergency braking and for regular braking.\n\nThe TSI (Technical Specifications for Interoperability) of the EU for trans-European high-speed rail recommends that all newly built high-speed lines should make the eddy current brake possible. \n\nThe first train in commercial circulation to use such a braking system has been the ICE 3.\n\nModern roller coasters also use this type of braking, but in order to avoid the risk posed by potential power outages, they utilize permanent magnets instead of electromagnets, thus not requiring any power supply, however, without the possibility to adjust the braking strength as easily as with electromagnets.\n\nIn physics education a simple experiment is sometimes used to illustrate eddy currents and the principle behind magnetic braking. When a strong magnet is dropped down a vertical, non-ferrous, conducting pipe, eddy currents are induced in the pipe, and these retard the descent of the magnet, so it falls slower than it would if free-falling. As one set of authors explained\n\nIn typical experiments, students measure the slower time of fall of the magnet through a copper tube compared with a cardboard tube, and may use an oscilloscope to observe the pulse of eddy current induced in a loop of wire wound around the pipe when the magnet falls through.\n\n\n"}

The standard supports algorithms enabling seamless handover between wired and wireless networks of the same type as well as handover between different wired and wireless network types also called Media independent handover (MIH) or vertical handover. Vertical handover was first introduced by Mark Stemn and Randy Katz at U C Berkeley. The standard provides information to allow handing over to and from wired 802.3 network to wireless 802.11, 802.15, 802.16, 3GPP and 3GPP2 networks through different handover mechanisms.\n\nThe IEEE 802.21 working group started work in March 2004. More than 30 companies have joined the working group. The group produced a first draft of the standard including the protocol definition in May 2005. The standard was published January 2009.\n\nCellular networks and 802.11 networks employ handover mechanisms for handover within the same network type (aka horizontal handover). Mobile IP provides handover mechanisms for handover across subnets of different types of networks, but can be slow in the process. Current 802 standards do not support handover between different types of networks. They also do not provide triggers or other services to accelerate mobile IP based handovers. Moreover, existing 802 standards provide mechanisms for detecting and selecting network access points, but do not allow for detection and selection of network access points in a way that is independent of the network type.\n\n\nImplementation is still in progress. Current technologies such as 802.11 that accomplish handover use software to accomplish handovers and suggest that software will also be the way that handover will be implemented by 802.21. The use of software as a means to implement 802.21 should not cause large increases in the cost of networking devices. An open source software implementation is provided by ODTONE.\n\nCrossing different administrative connectivity domains will require agreements among different network operators. Currently, such agreements are still not in place. In smart phones today, a user can manually select to use WiFi or cellular LTE, but the connections are not automatically maintained should a \ndisconnection of one network occurs. \n\nHence, seamless handovers across different wire/wireless networks are still not available today.\n\n\nUnlicensed Mobile Access (UMA) technology is basically a mobile-centric version of 802.21. UMA is said to provide roaming and handover between GSM, UMTS, Bluetooth and 802.11 networks. Since June 19, 2005, UMA is a part of the ETSI 3GPP standardization process under the GAN (Generic Access Network) Group.\n\nThe Evolved Packet Core (EPC) architecture for Next Generation Mobile Networks (3GPP Rel.8 and newer) provides the Access Network Discovery and Selection Function element (ANDSF) (see 3GPP TS 23.402 and 3GPP TS 24.312). Its S14 interface provides the communication path between the Core Network and the User Endpoint device on which to exchange discovery information and inter-system mobility policies, enabling as such a network suggested reselection of access networks.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1831493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831493", "title": "Eagle River, Anchorage", "text": "Eagle River, Anchorage\n\nEagle River is a community within the Municipality of Anchorage situated on the Eagle River, for which it is named, between Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson and Chugach State Park in the Chugach Mountains. Its ZIP code is 99577. Settled by homesteaders, Eagle River has been annexed to the Municipality of Anchorage since the 1970s—a relationship that is, at times, complicated. On the one hand, Eagle River functions as an Anchorage suburb, with a number of Eagle River residents working in, shopping or participating in community life in the Anchorage bowl. Much of the community is also made up of residents from nearby Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. On the other hand, the community is itself a significant business hub between Wasilla and Anchorage, offering shopping, restaurants, recreation and employment. Secession efforts have from time to time gained traction by residents who would like Eagle River legally regarded as a separate community. Eagle River also has a close relationship with its neighboring community to the north, Chugiak, with which it shares some history. If Eagle River were not part of the Municipality of Anchorage, it would be classified as one of the five largest cities in Alaska.\n\nThe Eagle River (and Chugiak) area was settled by homesteaders and prospered on agricultural activities. The name Eagle River was first reported in 1939 by the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Eagle River post office was established in 1961.\n\nIn 1964, the state legislature first divided the state into seven boroughs. Over the next decade, many area residents objected to the Chugiak-Eagle River area being lumped in as part of a Greater Anchorage-Area Borough. The Chugiak-Eagle River Borough was established in 1974, only to be dissolved shortly thereafter when the arrangement was ruled unconstitutional by the Alaska Supreme Court.\n\nIn spite of some local opposition, both Chugiak and Eagle River became annexed to the Municipality of Anchorage when the City of Anchorage and the Greater Anchorage Area Borough were unified in 1975. Efforts to secede from the Municipality surfaced around 2000, and then became less prominent for a while as the community saw an influx of individuals with social and economic ties to Anchorage and the nearby Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson. However, secession talks began again in 2019.\n\nMount Baldy, a 3,218-foot peak in Chugach State Park is a popular hiking and hang-gliding area.\n\nThe Eagle River runs through the southern end of the community.\n\nNeighborhoods along the Glenn Highway and Old Glenn Highway corridor are level or sloping, rising towards the Chugach Mountains east of the Old Glenn Highway. The remainder of the community lies along the canyon of the Eagle River; some neighborhoods built in the late 20th century and early 21st century near the Briggs Bridge are built very close to the bottom of the canyon. Neighborhoods along the northern portions of Eagle River, plus Hiland Road and Eagle River Road east of the curve where the road leaves the section line and descends into the canyon, mainly consist of houses built across the mountainsides. Wallace Mountain, on the far northeast corner of the community's road system, is home to several radio station transmitters and towers at the level.\n\nEagle River's average temperatures in January range from 6 to 20 degrees; in summer, temperatures range from 50 to 70. Annual precipitation is 15.9 inches, with 69 inches of snowfall. The bulk of the snowfall is usually from mid-October through December, with fewer snowstorms from January through April. On average, the area experiences 2 to 3 \"chinooks\" - a warm, dry wind that melts much of the snow and creates a minor thaw - during the winter months. Springtime is generally referred to as \"break up\" in the area and further north, referring to the breaking up of the ice on rivers and lakes. Local lore holds that seedlings should not be planted outdoors until after Memorial Day in May, and even then temperatures should be watched for light frost until June.\n\nEagle River first appeared on the 1960 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village, and again in 1970. It was annexed into Anchorage in 1975.\n\nThe 2000 census found a population of 22,236 in Eagle River and an additional 8,000 in the settlements northeast of Eagle River: Chugiak, Birchwood, Peters Creek, Thunderbird Falls and Eklutna. About 30,000 people live in the Eagle River and Chugiak areas, on both sides of the Glenn Highway. Many personnel from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (and formerly from their predecessors, Fort Richardson and Elmendorf Air Force Base) live in Eagle River, and many of the area's civilian residents additionally commute to jobs in the \"Anchorage bowl.\"\n\nEagle River is the shopping hub between Anchorage, Palmer, and Wasilla. Major stores are Wal-Mart, Fred Meyer, Carrs Safeway, and Walgreens. The last decade has seen two major improvements in local services: shopping and the availability of medical and dental services. The local movie theater reopened in 2006 with six screens, then closed down in December 2011. The number of local restaurants available almost doubled over the same 10-year span. As of 2006, leading industries in the community were the service industry, followed by trade (retail) and government (mainly working at public schools for the Anchorage School District.\n\nAnnual community events include a Fourth of July celebration held at Lion's Park, and the Bear Paw Festival, which is in July and is celebrated with multiple events throughout Eagle River.\n\nThe Bear Paw Festival kicks off on Thursday evening with the Miss Bear Paw pageant held at the Steve Primis Auditorium at Chugiak High School. This scholarship pageant sponsored by the Chugiak-Eagle River Chamber of Commerce also presents awards for Bear Paw Princess, Official Escort, Best Costume with an Alaskan Theme and Miss Congeniality. The Sleeping Lady Mountain Lions Club provides a Community Service Award scholarship. Saturday morning there is a 5k foot race, followed by a parade. A Renaissance anachronistic group does performances on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nEagle River has numerous public, parochial and charter school programs available for K-12 grades. The public school district is the Anchorage School District (ASD). ASD schools serving Eagle River are: Eagle River Elementary, Gruening Middle School, Eagle River High School, and Chugiak High School, which is located northeast of town. (The town is zoned such that roughly half of local public high school students go to Eagle River High School; the other half attends Chugiak High School.) However, due to damage from the 2018 Anchorage earthquake, Eagle River Elementary and Gruening Middle School, officials closed both schools for repairs through at least the 2019-2020 school year, with displaced students accommodated by other ASD schools. Homeschooling is also a popular form of education in the area, both through home-based charter schools and independently.\n\nThe University of Alaska Anchorage provides classes in the area and formerly had a campus at the Eagle Center building, adjacent to the middle Glenn Highway interchange. In 2019, the university chose not to renew its lease, but continues to provide classes at local public school locations. There is also a local bible college.\n\nThere is a lot of local interest in sports: hockey, both indoor and outdoor soccer, baseball, softball, basketball, football, swimming/diving, hiking, and cross-country running and skiing. A bike trail runs alongside the Glenn Highway from Anchorage past Eagle River and to Chugiak. Sidewalks are available and kept clear most of the winter in the downtown area for walking and jogging along the Old Glenn Highway and Business Boulevard. Cross-country skiing trails are available along Birchwood Road near Chugiak High School and recently trails have been put in around Eagle River High School. Hockey, figure skating, leisure skating, and indoor soccer are available at the Harry J. McDonald Memorial Center, which hosted seven games at the 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Outdoor soccer is available at the Russell Oberg Soccer Complex. Chugiak Youth Sports Association (CYSA) is a local non-profit organization that offers recreational team sport opportunities to the youth of Chugiak and Eagle River including soccer, basketball, volleyball and flag football. Eagle River Soccer Club (ERSC) provides pre-competitive soccer (U9 and U10) and recreational youth and adult leagues. Chugiak Soccer Club (CSC) provides competitive soccer for U11-U19 soccer players.\n\nPopular local activities include rafting, hiking, skiing and exploring the mountains. One of the more popular local hikes is up Mount Baldy, which overlooks the town. There is little fishing in the river, but anglers do gather at Fire and Mirror Lakes.\n\nThe 1996 Arctic Winter Games were held in Chugiak and Eagle River.\n\nThe Chugiak-Eagle River Star is a weekly newspaper that serves Eagle River, Chugiak, Eklutna, Peters Creek and Birchwood. The newspaper was founded in 1971 by Lee B. Jordan, who for decades remained active in the community as an authority on local history. He died in 2018.\n\nThe \"Star\" is part of the Binkley Company family of newspapers and shares reporting resources with its nearby sister publication, the Anchorage Daily News.\n\nThe ECHO is a community magazine focused on the same areas.\n\nFrom 1958 through 1973, The Knik Arm Courier covered the area. The Chugiak-Eagle River Historical Society maintains an online archives, saying, \"The Knik Arm Courier, established by James and Marie McDowell in 1958, was published through 1973 and is a reliable source of information from that period in Chugiak-Eagle River’s history.\" \n"}
{"id": "1831498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831498", "title": "Richard B. Angus", "text": "Richard B. Angus\n\nRichard Bladworth Angus (28 May 1831 – 17 September 1922) was a Scottish-Canadian banker, financier, and philanthropist. He was a co-founder and vice-president of the Canadian Pacific Railway, president of the Bank of Montreal, president of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, president of the Montreal Art Association, and co-founder and president of the Mount Royal Club. He was the natural successor to Lord Mount Stephen as president of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1888, but he did not desire the position; he twice refused a knighthood. The CPR Angus Shops were named for him, as was one of the later CP Ships.\n\nIn 1831, Angus was born in Scotland at Bathgate. He was a younger son of Alexander Angus (b. 1792), a merchant grocer from Rafford, Morayshire, and his wife Margaret Forrest (b. 1802), of Bathgate. Alexander Angus was a friend of the father of Sir James Young Simpson, and five of his eight children came to Canada at various stages. Educated at Bathgate Academy, Angus' first employment was in Manchester as a clerk with the Manchester and Liverpool Bank. In 1857, at Manchester, he married his wife, Mary Anne Daniels (1833–1913), the daughter of a Manchester wine merchant. In the same year as his marriage, he came with his wife to Montreal and found employment as a book-keeper with the Bank of Montreal, from where he advanced rapidly. \n\nBy 1861, Angus was placed in charge of the bank's Chicago office, and two years later, he was promoted to second agent in New York. The following year, he returned to Canada as interim manager of the bank's headquarters in Montreal. By 1869, he succeeded Edwin Henry King as the bank's general manager with an annual salary of $8,000, a position he held for the next ten years. During this time, he improved relations with the federal government (at a time when the Bank of Montreal acted as Canada's national bank) and turned over respectable profits despite the economic slump of the 1870s.\n\nDuring his time with the Bank of Montreal, Angus was free to pursue opportunities for private investment. In 1868, he went into partnership with the future Lords Mount Stephen and Strathcona at the time that they were becoming interested in developing railways across to the Canadian West. Their ventures were largely financed by the Bank of Montreal, of which Mount Stephen was president, and as his number two at the bank, Angus was closely involved. Angus resigned from the bank in 1879, briefly relocating to St. Paul, Minnesota, to represent the group's interests there as vice-president of the Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad.\n\nIn Minnesota, Angus had worked closely with James J. Hill, constructing and improving the line. But by 1880, he spent most of his time with Mount Stephen as they made numerous trips to Ottawa, New York, and London to negotiate the land grants, subsidies, and building of the Canadian Pacific Railway. With Angus providing the analysis and Mount Stephen the acumen, they proved to be a formidable pair. Angus was general manager of the CPR until the appointment of Sir William Cornelius Van Horne in 1882, when Angus became vice-president. In that position, Angus was entrusted with the creation of the eastern network, notably the extension of the Ontario and Quebec Railway and the purchase of the western section of the 'Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Occidental Railway' in 1882. \n\nThe construction of the CPR was fraught with financial peril, testing the resilience of the syndicate – Hill resigned in 1883, followed by Angus' close friend Duncan McIntyre the next year. To lobby for funds more successfully, Angus resigned from the St. Paul Railway in 1884. The CPR, completed in 1885, was an immediate financial success, becoming \"the world's greatest transportation system\". He remained vice-president of the CPR after Lord Mount Stephen resigned from an active role as president in 1888. Apparently never aspiring to the position, Angus supported Stephen's selection of Van Horne as president and, 11 years later, Van Horne's choice of Lord Shaughnessy as his successor. Angus would serve as a director and committee member of the CPR for over 40 years, necessitating frequent trips to the Canadian Pacific Offices on Trafalgar Square in London.\n\nAngus's wealth now allowed him to further invest in the vast number of companies associated with the CPR and its directors. Among others, he sat on the boards of Canada North-West Land Company; Royal Trust Company; Dominion Bridge Company; Dominion Iron and Steel Company; Grand Falls Power Company; Pacific Coal Company; Canadian Salt Company; and the London & Lancashire Assurance Company in England. \n\nHe joined Sir William Van Horne and former CPR contractors James Ross and Sir William Mackenzie as an investor in street railways in Montreal, Toronto and Winnipeg. Prior to his death, he would be the principal shareholder in Mackenzie's Toronto Power Company. He invested with Van Horne in the Laurentide Paper Company, was among the founding financiers of the British Columbia Sugar Refinery, and was a principal backer of the Federal Telephone Company. The British Columbia Sugar Refinery was started by Benjamin Tingley Rogers, the 'brash' husband of his niece, Mary Isabella Angus.\n\nAngus also played a role in maintaining the close relationship between the CPR and the Bank of Montreal, whose growth in the Canadian West ran side by side that of the railway. In 1891, he returned to the bank as a director, and after the death of Sir George Alexander Drummond, he was elected as the bank's president from 1910 to 1913, when he was succeeded by his son-in-law's brother, Sir Vincent Meredith. By 1912, Angus was one of the bank's largest shareholders, and after retiring as president, he remained a director until his death.\n\nIn 1878, Angus and his family moved into his new house at 240 Drummond Street in the Golden Square Mile. Like many wealthy Montrealers, Angus had a passion for floriculture, particularly his beloved orchids, and the house featured a large conservatory. His new home provided a suitable space for the art collection that he had started with purchases from Montreal and London dealers in the late 1870s. His collection contained many fine examples of the Old Masters. Angus served as president of the Art Association of Montreal, donating six paintings in 1889 – the most significant gift since the Association's foundation and the first major one in contemporary art. Before his Montreal home was demolished in 1957, it served as McGill University's conservatory of music.\n\nIn 1901, Angus commissioned the construction of a grand country house on an estate named Pine Bluff at 218 Senneville Road in Senneville, Quebec, overlooking the Lake of Two Mountains. It was designed in the Châteauesque style by Edward Maxwell and his younger brother, William Maxwell. The house was completed in 1904 and replaced a home that had been built on the site in 1886 for Angus and then remodeled by Edward Maxwell from 1898 to 1899 before being destroyed by fire soon after. The new home, which included an ice house and a peach house, was later remodelled and eventually demolished in the 1950s.\n\nDespite the dawn of the automobile, when Angus was president of the Bank of Montreal in 1910, he was still seen every morning arriving at the bank's headquarters in his four-in-hand carriage. A \"quiet, purposeful man\", Angus enjoyed vigorous health and remained active until the end of his life, even embarking on a European tour in 1921, at the age of ninety.\n\nAngus had become one of the wealthiest men in Montreal, and he was also well known for his philanthropic activities and generous donations to the causes to which he allied himself. He was President of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, and in 1906 co-founded the Alexandra Contagious Diseases Hospital, serving as a governor. He was President and Governor of the Fraser Institute Free Public Library; vice-president of the Victorian Order of Nurses, Governor of McGill University (to which he donated one of his more considerable sums) and Governor of the Montreal General Hospital. He was a director of the Charity Organization Society, which he generously funded.\n\nAs one of Montreal's most prominent Scots-Quebecers, he was elected President of the St Andrew's Society. In 1889, he co-founded the Mount Royal Club, where he was later President. He was a member of more than a dozen clubs throughout Canada, including: the St. James Club, of which he was formerly chairman; the Montreal Jockey Club; the Auto Club and Aero Club; the Forest and Stream Club; the Winter Club; the Rideau Club of Ottawa; The Toronto Club; the York Club; and the Manitoba Club. He was an honorary member of the Antiquarian and Numismatic Society of Montreal.\n\nAngus had occupied one of the most prominent positions in Canadian banking by the age of thirty eight. Abandoning that position for a highly speculative railway venture, he not only revealed his personality but also the allure of the railways and the riches they offered. As President of the Bank of Montreal and with the fortune he made from the CPR, he had already secured for himself a place of the highest standing in Canada, but he more than doubled that fortune through his associations with, and investments in, coal, pulp and paper, iron and steel, land and insurance. Angus paid for the education of several of his nephews, including Captain Harry Angus (1891–1989), who graduated from Balliol College, Oxford, before returning to Victoria, British Columbia.\n\nAngus' estate was divided between his eight surviving children:\n\nAlthough Lord Mount Stephen is generally credited as the genius that created the CPR empire, with his banking and administrative experience, Angus was an indispensable lieutenant. In 1904, the CPR named its new repair complexes in Montreal the CPR Angus Shops in his honour. He died at his country house, Pine Bluff, on 17 September 1922. Two days later, on the day of his funeral, the CPR stopped all trains for two minutes – a symbolic gesture to one of its founding partners. He was buried at the Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal.\n\n"}
