It was recorded in 1994, and came at a personal and professional career crossroads for Watt. fIREHOSE had broken up after eight years and six releases earlier in 1994, and his marriage to former Black Flag bassist Kira Roessler had ended in divorce (although both their friendship and their dual-bass project Dos continued; Kira also contributed some computer graphics to the album's artwork).\n\nThe title references the difference between being a team player or being a glory hog. Watt explained it as \"Are you going to be the tugboat which helps boats dock in rough surf safely? Or are you going to be like some glory hound who shoots the fucking ball every time you get it?\"\n\nWithout a full-time band, Watt recruited a wide variety of friends and fellow travelers to participate in the recording of the album. These included fellow SST Records alumni like former Black Flag vocalist Henry Rollins, members of Sonic Youth, Curt and Cris Kirkwood of the Meat Puppets, former Saccharine Trust guitarist Joe Baiza, Dinosaur Jr's J Mascis, and former SST house producer Spot, as well as members of bands who had either toured with and/or been influenced by the Minutemen and Firehose, including Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, Nirvana's Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl (making their first recorded appearance on a record since Kurt Cobain's death), Jane's Addiction and Porno for Pyros drummer Stephen Perkins, Red Hot Chili Peppers's Flea, Bikini Kill's Kathleen Hanna, Soul Asylum's Dave Pirner, former Germs and Nirvana guitarist Pat Smear, former Pixies singer Frank Black, former Screamers and Twisted Roots keyboardist Paul Roessler (who was also Watt's brother-in-law), The Lemonheads frontman Evan Dando, The Circle Jerks' Zander Schloss, former Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan and guitarist Gary Lee Conner, jazz/punk guitarist Nels Cline and his drummer Michael Preussner, that dog's Petra and Rachel Haden and Anna Waronker and Mike D and Ad-Rock of the Beastie Boys. Also participating on the album were Parliament/Funkadelic organist Bernie Worrell, Carla Bozulich of the Geraldine Fibbers, Vince Meghrouni and Tony Atherton from the jazz band Bazooka and Bruce Hornsby drummer John Molo.\n\nIn interviews and on his online tour journals, Watt has nicknamed \"Ball-Hog...\" \"The Wrestling Album\", as he considered the various lineups we worked with on the album as \"people getting into the ring\" with him. Watt has also mentioned in interviews that professional wrestling is one of the few things he regularly watches on television (He once named The Magnificent Muraco as a favorite wrestler of his.) Watt's longtime friend, artist Raymond Pettibon (another wrestling fan), added to the wrestling theme by contributing to the artwork a panel cartoon with the caption \"Sex with you is like watching scientific wrestling\".\n\n\"Big Train\" was the first single from the album and one of only two songs Watt sang lead vocal on (the other being the closing track, \"Coincidence Is Either Hit Or Miss\".) The album's other singles, \"Against The 70's\" and \"Piss-Bottle Man\", featured Eddie Vedder and Evan Dando on lead vocals respectively. All three of the singles were airplay hits on both modern rock and college radio, with \"Against The 70's\" peaking at #21 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. Videos were also shot for \"Big Train\" and \"Piss-Bottle Man\"; the former video originally featured models of Union Pacific trains in the footage, which was blurred out in a subsequent version of the clip after the company raised a copyright objection.\n\nAs part of the label's push behind the album, Columbia released the album as a limited-run double-vinyl LP, pressed on deep blue vinyl, and in a limited edition cardboard 12-inch by 6-inch sleeve that included both the standard CD insert as well as a second CD booklet that contained a \"glossary of Pedro slang\".\n\nTo date, \"Ball-Hog...\" is the greatest selling album of Mike Watt's career other than the Minutemen's \"Double Nickels On The Dime\".\n\nWatt assembled an all-star grouping for his initial tour for the album in early 1995, attracting a great deal of attention from the alternative music press. Watt was backed by Vedder on guitar and vocals, Smear on guitar, William Goldsmith on drums, and Dave Grohl alternating on guitar and drums. The tour also featured Hovercraft (also featuring Vedder, performing semi-anonymously beside his then-wife Beth Liebling), and the Foo Fighters on their first national tour. Watt's ensemble performed on \"The Jon Stewart Show\" during this tour. Special guests such as Carla Bozulich and Perry Farrell appeared at select shows.\n\nA May 1995 tour date in Chicago was recorded and later released as \"\"Ring Spiel\" Tour ’95\".\n\nLater in the year Watt toured with a four-piece nicknamed The Crew Of The Flying Saucer with guitarist Nels Cline and two drummers, Michael Preussner and Vince Meghrouni, who served as an opening act for Primus on their 1995 US tour.\n\nAll tracks composed by Mike Watt; except where indicated\n\n\n\nThe album liner notes list the following performers by track:\n\n"}

Ginger beef is derived from the original \"Geung Ngao Yuk\" (Chinese: 薑牛肉) dish.\nAs with many dishes, the invention of ginger beef is claimed by several restaurants and chefs. However, the most widely accepted origin attributes the dish's development during the mid-1970s by chef George Wong at the Silver Inn in Calgary, Alberta.

{"id": "1994258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994258", "title": "Breton literature", "text": "Breton literature\n\nBreton literature may refer to literature in the Breton language (\"Brezhoneg\") or the broader literary tradition of Brittany in the three other main languages of the area, namely, Latin, Gallo and French – all of which have had strong mutual linguistic and cultural influences.\n\nBreton literature can be categorised into an Old Breton period, from the 5th to 11th century; and a Middle Breton period, up to the 17th century. The period break is marked by the Norman invasions of the 10th and 11th centuries which triggered an exodus out of Brittany. Many Old Breton extant words are glosses in Latin manuscripts from the 9th and 10th centuries, now scattered in libraries and collections throughout Europe. It is likely there was a highly developed oral tradition during the Old Breton period. And on the evidence of Breton names, it would appear that Old and Middle Breton literature inspired much of Arthurian literature, the story of Tristan and Iseult and the \"Lais\" of Marie de France.\n\nThe oldest surviving manuscript in the Breton language (dating to the end of the 8th century) is kept in Leyden University, Netherlands, and predates by more than a century the oldest text referenced in French. It is generally assumed by specialists that this is the most ancient text in a continental Brythonic language and was studied by the late Professor Léon Fleuriot (1923–1987). The manuscript itself is a fragment of medicinal recipes composed of plants suggesting that Breton may well have been used by people of learning at the turn of the 11th century.\n\nAlthough written in Latin the Breton Gospel (\"British Library, Egerton 609\") is an important literary work in terms of the wider scope of Breton culture. Amongst other things it attests to a high degree of learning and, presumably, monasterial wealth in Brittany comparable to that of Lindisfarne and Kells. The Gospel Book manuscript dating from the 9th century contains the Latin text of the four Gospels, along with prefatory material and canon tables – an interesting admixture of traditions. The Breton Gospel is similar to the form of Carolingian minuscule developed at Tours – one of the classicising centres of the Carolingian Renaissance, and although the form of the large illuminated letters that form the beginning of each Gospel are comparable to those found in Carolingian manuscripts, the decoration thereof is far more similar to insular manuscripts such as the Book of Kells and the Lindisfarne Gospels, suggesting a continuum of cultural tradition. However, the decoration here is simpler and more geometric in form than that to be found in insular manuscripts. The beginning of each Gospel is preceded by a full miniature of the appropriate Evangelist's symbol and the vellum folios themselves measure 32.5 by 23 centimetres.\n\nAnother early known piece of Breton literature is found in the margins of a 14th-century Latin manuscript, scribbled by a scribe weary of his toil and mind on more immediate concerns, he left for posterity a four line love poem, the first two lines beginning:\n\nThe main principle of Breton poetry is that the next to last syllable in a line should rhyme with one or more other syllables in the same line. For example, in the first line above, \"en\" is the second to last syllable, which rhymes with \"guen\" and \"heguen\". In the second line, \"at\" is the second to last syllable which rhymes with \"hegarat\".\n\nThere are several texts from the 15th and 16th century:\n\nBefore the literary revival movement promoted by Gwalarn in the early 20th century, most literature in Breton consisted of religious writings.\n\nJean-François Le Gonidec (Breton: Yann-Frañsez ar Gonideg) (1775–1838) played an important role in Breton literature by initiating a reform of Breton orthography, producing an orderly grammar and making the first Breton translation of the New Testament.\n\nProse writings in Breton, almost exclusively religious, start appearing from the 17th century. The second half of the 18th century saw the appearance of the first secular works in Breton: \"Ar Farvel Goapaer\" by François-Nicolas de Pascal de Kerenveyer and \"Sarmoun great war ar maro a Vikael Vorin\" by Claude-Marie Le Laë. Most literature remained oral, however.\n\nIn the 19th century antiquarians and Celtic revivalists undertook the collection of folk texts, songs and stories. The wave of interest in collecting oral traditions reached Brittany around 1815-1820 when educated members of the gentry such as Aymar de Blois de La Calande, Barbe-Émilie de Saint-Prix, Jean-Marie de Penguern, Jean-François de Kergariou, Ursule Feydeau de Vaugien, exchanged their findings informally. Writers such as Anatole Le Braz and Théodore Hersart de la Villemarqué (son of Ursule Feydeau de Vaugien) brought new readers to traditional Breton literature.\n\n\"Barzaz Breizh\", the \"Ballads of Brittany\", (literally, \"Barzaz Breizh\" = bards of Brittany) is a collection of Breton popular songs collected by La Villemarqué and published in 1839 (revised and expanded edition 1845). It was compiled from oral tradition and preserves traditional folk tales, legends and music. Although hugely influential, La Villemarqué's work came under attacke from a later generation of collectors for having edited his materials in accordance with the demands of contemporary literary taste. Taking a more rigorous approach to the collection of oral material, François-Marie Luzel published \"Gwerziou Breiz Izel\" (1868–1874) and \"Contes Bretons\" (1870).\n\nAuguste Brizeux used Le Gonidec's standardised Breton for \"Telenn Arvor\" (1844), and his collection of proverbs, \"Furnez Breiz\" (1845).\n\nThe poet Jean-Pierre Calloc'h (1888–1917) was killed during the First World War. His posthumously-published collection \"Ar en deulin\" established his reputation as a war poet.\n\nIn the 1920s, a movement, in which the linguist and author Roparz Hemon played an important part, arose to introduce the trends of modern literature into Breton. The literary magazine \"Gwalarn\" provided an outlet for modern authors, such as Jakez Riou and Yves Le Drézen (who published the first long novel in Breton in 1941). The artistic movement \"Seiz Breur\" included writers.\n\nThe literary magazine Al Liamm published its first issue in 1946. Numerous authors of modern Breton literature, such as Abeozen, Per Denez, Youenn Drezen, Xavier de Langlais (Langleiz), Añjela Duval, Reun Ar C'halan, Maodez Glanndour, Youenn Gwernig, Roparz Hemon, Ronan Huon, Paol Keineg, Kerverzioù, Meavenn, Youenn Olier, Yann-Ber Piriou ... have made contributions to the magazine with poems, short stories, essays, studies, ... Breton poets and singers who were directly involved in the revival of the music of Brittany, such as Milig ar Skañv (Glenmor), Youenn Gwernig, or Bernez Tangi, have also published poems and songs in Al Liamm.\n\nPierre-Jakez Hélias (1914–1995) wrote prose and poetry in both Breton and French. His contemporary Añjela Duval (1905–1981) wrote poetry reflective of her peasant origins, mysticism, and social conscience.\n\nIn contrast to the concentration on short-form writings in Breton which had dominated production in the previous century, a trend towards novel-length writing developed from the 1980s. By the beginning of the 21st century a dozen or so novels on average were being published in Breton every year. The choice of genres was diverse, including detective fiction, historical fiction and autobiographies. With incentives from educational contexts, contests and literary prizes, there has been a development of young adult fiction, often using fantasy and science-fiction themes. Yann-Fañch Jacq is a notable author of such fiction aimed at young Breton-speaking readers. New more adult themes have appeared as the novel genre has developed: for example, Yann Fulub Dupuy's \"Par Dibar\" (2006) deals with sexuality. Finally special mention should be made of the poet singer Denez Prigent, whose creative career and international success (a rarity in contemporary France, as opposed to the epoch of Jacques Brel) testifies to the appeal of Breton artists. \n\n\"Prizioù\" is an annual (since 1997) award for expressions of Breton culture in seven categories, of which fiction is one. \"Prix Xavier de Langlais\" (named after Xavier de Langlais) is an annual (since 1976) prize for best unpublished prose work or poetry collection.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1994260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994260", "title": "Mountain warfare", "text": "Mountain warfare\n\nMountain warfare refers to warfare in the mountains or similarly rough terrain. This type of warfare is also called Alpine warfare, after the Alps mountains. Mountain warfare is one of the most dangerous types of combat as it involves surviving not only combat with the enemy but also the extreme weather and dangerous terrain.\n\nMountain ranges are of strategic importance since they often act as a natural border, and may also be the origin of a water source (e.g. Golan Heights – \"water conflict\"). Attacking a prepared enemy position in mountain terrain requires a greater ratio of attacking soldiers to defending soldiers than a war conducted on level ground. Mountains at any time of year are dangerous – lightning, strong gusts of wind, rock falls, avalanche, snow pack, ice, extreme cold, glaciers with their crevasses and the general uneven terrain and the slow pace of troop and material movement are all additional threats to combatants. Movement, reinforcements, and medical evacuation up and down steep slopes and areas where even pack animals cannot reach involves an enormous exertion of energy.\n\nThe term mountain warfare is said to have come about in the Middle Ages after the monarchies of Europe found it difficult to fight the Swiss armies in the Alps because the Swiss were able to fight in smaller units and took vantage points against a huge unmaneuverable army. Similar styles of attack and defence were later employed by guerrillas, partisans and irregulars who hid in the mountains after an attack, making it challenging for an army of regulars to fight back. In Bonaparte's Italian campaign, and the 1809 rebellion in Tyrol, mountain warfare played a large role.\n\nAnother example of mountain warfare was the Crossing of the Andes carried out by the Argentinean Army of the Andes () commanded by General José de San Martín in 1817. One of the divisions surpassed 5000 m in height.\n\nIn 218 BC (DXXXVI a.u.c.) the Carthaginian army commander Hannibal marched troops, cavalry and African elephants across the Alps in an effort to conquer Rome by approaching it from north of the Italian peninsula. The Roman government was complacent because the Alps were apparently a secure natural obstacle to would-be invaders. In December 218 BC the Carthaginian forces defeated Roman troops, in the north, with the use of elephants. Many elephants did not survive the cold weather and disease that was typical of the European climate. Hannibal's army fought Roman troops in Italy for 15 years but failed to conquer Rome. Carthage was ultimately defeated by Roman general Scipio Africanus at Zama in north Africa in 202 BC (DLII a.u.c.).\n\nMountain warfare came to the fore once again during World War I, when some of the nations involved in the war had mountain divisions that had hitherto not been tested. The Austro-Hungarian defence repelled Italian attacks as they took advantage of the mostly mountainous terrain in the Julian Alps and the Dolomites, where frostbite and avalanches proved deadlier than bullets. During the summer of 1918, the Battle of San Matteo took place on the Italian front; this battle was fought at the highest elevation of any in the war. In December 1914, another offensive was launched by the Turkish supreme commander Enver Pasha with 95,000–190,000 troops against the Russians in the Caucasus. Insisting on a frontal attack against Russian positions in the mountains in the heart of winter, the end result was devastating and Enver lost 86% of his forces.\nThe Italian Campaign in World War II, Siachen conflict were also large-scale mountain warfare examples.\n\nExamples of mountain warfare used during WWII include:\nBattles of Narvik,\nKokoda Track campaign,\nOperation Rentier,\nOperation Gauntlet, and\nOperation Encore.\nSince the Partition of India in 1947, India and Pakistan have been in conflict over the Kashmir region. They have fought two wars and numerous additional skirmishes or border conflicts in the region. Kashmir is located in the Himalayas, the highest mountain range in the world.\n\nThe first hostilities between the two nations, in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, showed that both were ill-equipped to fight in biting cold, let alone at the highest altitudes in the world. During the Sino-Indian War of 1962, hostilities broke out between India and China in the same area.\n\nThe subsequent Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 between India and Pakistan was mainly fought in Kashmir's valleys rather than the mountains themselves, although several mountain battles took place. In the Kargil War (1999) Indian forces sought to flush out opponents who had captured high mountain posts. The proxy warfare in 1999 was the only modern war that was fought exclusively on mountains. Following the Kargil War, the Indian Army implemented specialist training on artillery use in the mountains, where ballistic projectiles have different characteristics than at sea level.\n\nMost of the Falklands War took place on hills in semi-Arctic conditions on the Falkland Islands. However, during the opening stage of the war, there was military action on the bleak mountainous island of South Georgia, when a British expedition sought to eject occupying Argentine forces. South Georgia is a periantarctic island, and the conflict took place during the southern winter, so Alpine conditions prevailed almost down to sea level. The operation (codenamed Operation Paraquet) was unusual, in that it combined aspects of long-range amphibious warfare, arctic warfare and mountain warfare. It involved several ships, special forces troops and helicopters.\n\nThroughout history but especially since 1979, many mountain warfare operations have taken place throughout Afghanistan. Since the coalition invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 these have been primarily in the eastern provinces of Kunar and Nuristan.\n\nKunar and eastern Nuristan are strategic terrain. The area constitutes a major infiltration route into Afghanistan, and insurgents can enter these provinces from any number of places along the Pakistani border to gain access to a vast network of river valleys. In this part of Afghanistan (Regional Command East), the US military has adopted a hybrid style of mountain warfare incorporating counterinsurgency (COIN) theory in which the population is paramount as the center of gravity in the fight.\n\nIn counterinsurgency, seizing and holding territory is less important than avoiding civilian casualties. The primary goal of counterinsurgency is to secure the backing of the populace and thereby to legitimize the government rather than focus on militarily defeating the insurgents. Counterinsurgency doctrine has proved difficult to implement in Kunar and Nuristan. In the sparsely-populated mountain regions of Eastern Afghanistan, strategists have argued for holding the high ground—a tenet of classical mountain warfare. The argument suggests that if the counterinsurgent does not deny the enemy the high ground, the insurgents will be able to attack at will. In the Kunar and Nuristan regions, US forces continue to pursue a hybrid style of counterinsurgency warfare, with its focus on winning hearts and minds, and mountain warfare, whereby the US forces seize and hold the high ground.\n\nThe expense of training mountain troops precludes them from being on the order of battle of most armies except those who reasonably expect to fight in such terrain. Mountain warfare training is arduous and in many countries is the exclusive preserve of elite units such as special forces or commandos, who as part of their remit should have the ability to fight in difficult terrain (e.g. the Royal Marines). Regular units may also occasionally undertake training of this nature.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The secret society blazed briefly in the headlines in 2001 when members announced plans to make their own pornographic film on campus starring other Yale students, although the film was never released or even completed. Nevertheless, a fictionalized version of the club's experiences was produced as a TV movie titled \"Porn 'n Chicken\" and broadcast on Comedy Central. A Porn 'n Chicken club has been confirmed to exist at the University of Virginia.\n\nIn the October 2000 \"Yale Herald\" article by Joseph Ax that is the first known public discussion of the club, it was mentioned that the club planned to shoot its own porno film that spring. The film's name, later infamous, had already been selected -- \"The StaXXX\". \"Everyone is invited to audition: undergrads, TAs, professors, local high school students,\" one of the club members explained. \"We're pretty serious about this film. We'd like to have a screening at UPIX.\"\n\nIn November 2000 they posted around campus for actors and actresses, and even filmed their first scenes in late January (one of their actresses was taking a semester in Nepal during the bulk of the filming, so her scenes were completed early). Blurry snapshots of the action appeared in the \"Yale Daily News\". A week later the \"New York Times\" had the story, and a national media frenzy ensued.\n\n\"The New Yorker\", Fox News Boston, \"Hustler\", \"The New York Post\", \"Brill's Content\", \"The Village Voice\", \"Premiere Magazine\", \"The London Evening Standard\", and others all inquired for information. Club organizers claimed that they were getting irritated by all the interview requests, and shut out MTV, the \"New York Post\", and the \"New Haven Register\".\n\nAccording to the stories that followed, many students wanted to be involved, but few were willing to let their names or faces appear in the film. The movie's plot accommodated this by following the induction of members into one of Yale's secret societies, allowing the actors to wear masks.\n\nTowards the end of the school year, nobody saw any filming going on. Word leaked that the scenes that had been filmed first had since been destroyed at the request of one of the actresses. Sentiment shifted to the hypothesis that the film, if not the entire club, was merely a prank. Students who had been contacted earlier in the year heard nothing more. Posters were hung in April advertising a preliminary screening of the film, but the public was not invited and many doubted that any footage existed. \n\nClub members insisted \"The StaXXX\" existed, and even asserted that a sequel was in the works. This film, to be called \"Dubya\", would depict the sexual exploits of U.S. President George W. Bush during his years at Yale. The budding filmmakers offered that they were being represented by the Creative Artists Agency. When contacted, CAA acknowledged that it was representing a Yale student named James Ponsoldt in connection with PnC, but Ponsoldt vehemently denied having anything to do with the club.\n\nPnC (or people pretending to be PnC) continued to host events on campus, including a movie screening and lecture by \"Village Voice\" sex columnist Tristan Taormino.\n\nA trailer for \"The StaXXX\" was ultimately released and was shown before a screening at the Yale Film Society, but no other footage ever emerged.\n\nPonsoldt, along with other Yale alumni, sold the Porn 'n Chicken stories to Comedy Central, which filmed on the Columbia University campus. The movie premiered on Comedy Central on October 13, 2002. Porn stars Jenna Jameson and Ron Jeremy appear in the film as guest speakers at a club meeting.\n\n"}

The original station, close to the shore, was built in 1808 with two wooden towers that were replaced in 1841 in spite of questions as to why a single tower would not be adequate. In 1877, two new towers, made of cast iron rings, replaced those. One of the towers was moved to the Eastham area and became Nauset Light in 1923.\n\nThe station was established in 1808; it was the second light station on Cape Cod. To distinguish it from Highland Light, the first Cape Cod light, and to act as a range, twin octagonal wooden towers were built. They were on skids so that they could be moved to keep them in line with the entrance channel as it shifted. Samuel Nye was appointed as the first Keeper of the Chatham Lights by President Jefferson on October 7, 1808. The light had an interesting history afterwards.\n\n\nChatham Light was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Chatham Light Station on June 15, 1987, reference number 87001501.\nThe following individuals were the principal light keepers over the years.\n\n\nToday, the former keeper's house is an active U.S. Coast Guard station, and on-duty personnel living quarters.

{"id": "1994297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994297", "title": "Pinball Wizard", "text": "Pinball Wizard\n\n\"Pinball Wizard\" is a song written by Pete Townshend and performed by the English rock band the Who, featured on their 1969 rock opera album \"Tommy\". The original recording was released as a single in 1969 and reached No. 4 in the UK charts and No. 19 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nThe B-side of the \"Pinball Wizard\" single is an instrumental credited to Keith Moon, titled \"Dogs Part Two\". Despite the title, it has no musical connection to the Who's 1968 UK single \"Dogs\".\n\nThe lyrics are written from the perspective of a pinball champion, called \"Local Lad\" in the \"Tommy\" libretto book, astounded by the skills of the opera's eponymous main character, Tommy Walker: \"He ain't got no distractions / Can't hear those buzzers and bells / Don't see lights a flashin' / Plays by sense of smell / Always gets a replay / Never seen him fall / That deaf dumb and blind kid / Sure plays a mean pin ball.\", and \"I thought I was the Bally table king, but I just handed my pinball crown to him\".\n\nTownshend once called it \"the most clumsy piece of writing [he'd] ever done\". Nevertheless, the song was a commercial success and remains one of the most recognised tunes from the opera. It was a perpetual concert favourite for Who fans due to its pop sound and familiarity.\n\nIn late 1968 or early 1969, when The Who played a rough assembly of their new album to critic Nik Cohn, Cohn gave a lukewarm reaction to it. Following this, Townshend, as \"Tommy\"s principal composer, discussed the album with Cohn and concluded that, to lighten the load of the rock opera's heavy spiritual overtones (Townshend had recently become deeply interested in the teachings of Meher Baba), the title character, a \"deaf, dumb, and blind\" boy, should also be particularly good at a certain game. Knowing Cohn was an avid pinball fan, Townshend suggested that Tommy would play pinball, and Cohn immediately declared \"Tommy\" to be a masterpiece. The song \"Pinball Wizard\" was written and recorded almost immediately. The single version was slightly sped up and runs to 2:57, whilst the natural length album version runs to 3:04.\n\nThis song is one of the band's most famous live songs, being played at almost every Who concert since its debut live performance on 2 May 1969. The live performances rarely deviated from the album arrangement, save for an occasional jam at the end sometimes leading to another song. Bootleg recordings show that this song has been known to last as long as 8 minutes (at a concert at the Rainbow Theatre in London on 3 February 1981), although live versions lasting as long as that are extremely rare. Pinball Wizard was also played during the Super Bowl XLIV Halftime Show on 7 February 2010.\n\n\nThe song was performed by Elton John in Ken Russell's 1975 film adaptation of \"Tommy.\" This version was released in 1975 as a promotional single only in the US, and in 1976 in the UK, where it reached number 7. John's version uses a piano as the song's centerpiece in place of the acoustic guitar in the original (in the film, John's character is shown playing his pinball machine via a small piano keyboard), and features additional lyrics specially written by Townshend for the movie version, as well as a subtle inclusion of musical phrases from The Who's 1960s hit \"I Can't Explain\" during the outro (similarly, The Who's later cover of Elton John's \"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\" included parts of \"Take Me to the Pilot\"). Unlike most of the soundtrack's music, which featured various combinations of The Who and some of the era's best session players, Elton John used his own band and producer Gus Dudgeon for the track. John has performed the song as part of his Las Vegas Red Piano Show, as well as on various tours. To date, it is the only cover of a Who song to reach the top 10.\n\nThe song has subsequently been performed by Taron Egerton who portrayed Elton John in the film \"Rocketman\" (2019).\n\n\nIn Toronto, \"Pinball Wizard\" spent two weeks at number one on the CHUM survey. In Chicago, \"Pinball Wizard\" remained on the WLS Musicradio Survey as an \"extra\" for five and a half months, from mid-April to late September as an album track in heavy rotation.\n\n\n"}

Bush to protect the Development Fund for Iraq for the rebuilding of Iraq from any legal attachments or liens. Further, it protects Iraqi oil products and interests and ownership by US persons (defined to include US corporations) from attachment as well. Executive Order 13303 also terminates sanctions specified in EO 12722, EO 12724, EO 13290, as it applies to the development fund. In effect, EO 13303 provides an extraordinarily broad legal shield for any and all contractors and mercenaries working in Iraq on behalf of US corporations in any oil related enterprise.\n\nThe primary effect of EO 13303 is the legal protection of US oil companies. EO 13303 is part of a broader endeavor by the Bush administration to exert control over Iraqi oil revenues. The plan centers on the Development Fund for Iraq, created by the United Nations and nominally controlled by the United States, with advice from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The second part of the plan is EO 13303, providing absolute legal protection for US interests in Iraqi oil.\n\nCritics of EO 13303 contend new debt for Iraq will accrue from the new Development Fund for Iraq. They say that it will allow opportunities for grave abuses because it offers little illuminating context and its tone suggests the language should be read quite broadly. These concerns stem from the apparent likelihood the fund will be used to leverage US government and corporate interests. \n\nThe United Nations Security Council approved Resolution 1483 on May 22, 2003, ending economic sanctions against Iraq while clearing a path for the transfer of over $1 billion from the Oil-for-Food program as seed money for establishment of the development fund. Critics are also alarmed because all proceeds from the sale of Iraqi oil and natural gas are to be placed into the fund, noting developing countries have amassed huge debts in exchange for selling out their natural resources to powerful corporations. This paradigm, they contend, cloaks corporate welfare and neocolonialism in terms of 'poverty alleviation', and now in Iraq as 'humanitarian assistance'.\n\nThere are differences between the original text (UN Security Council Resolution 1483) and EO 13303, which may lead a court to hold implementation is overbroad.\n\n\n\n"}

The third-longest and second-busiest line on the system, the Framingham/Worcester Line is plagued by poor track conditions, interference from freight trains, and a number of non-handicapped-accessible stations. Service on the line is a mix of local and express trains serving Worcester plus short-turn Framingham locals.\n\nThe Framingham/Worcester Line was one of the first commuter rail lines, with daily commuter-oriented service to West Newton beginning in 1834. Originally the Boston and Worcester Railroad, service has been operated by the Boston and Albany Railroad, New York Central, Penn Central, and since 1964 by Boston and Maine Railroad, Amtrak, and the MBCR until 2014 under contract to the MBTA. Since 2014 service has been operated by Keolis North America. In 1975 the line was cut back to Framingham, but service returned to Worcester in 1994 with four infill stations added between 2000 and 2002.\n\nAfter purchasing the Framingham-Worcester trackage from CSX in 2012, the MBTA has begun adding service to the outer section of the line and performing track work to increase speeds and reliability. A new station at Boston Landing opened in 2017. The line is the second-busiest on the MBTA Commuter Rail system, with 18,636 daily riders by a 2018 count.\n\nAll stations from Boston Landing east and West Natick west are handicapped accessible; those in between are not.\n\nOriginally built in 1834 as the Boston and Worcester Railroad, the line was later part of the Boston and Albany Railroad and New York Central Railroad systems. The Massachusetts Turnpike Authority acquired the tracks from Newton to Back Bay station in order to construct the Boston Extension of the Massachusetts Turnpike from the Route 128 circumferential highway to the then-elevated Central Artery in downtown Boston. Construction ran from 1962 to 1964, and reduced the railway to two tracks.\n\nThe New York Central was merged into Penn Central Transportation in 1968, which went bankrupt in 1970. Amtrak was created in 1971 to take over intercity rail service from the private railroads. When Amtrak started operations on May 1, 1971, no intercity service was kept on the line, thus ending direct connections from Boston to Springfield, Pittsfield, and Albany. In mid-May, Amtrak added the Boston-New Haven \"Bay State\". The train struggled to find consistent ridership, with frequent changes of schedule and destination. In 1973, the westbound trip operated as a quasi-commuter train. The \"Bay State\" was canceled on March 1, 1975.\n\nOn January 27, 1973, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) acquired the remainder of the tracks east of Framingham, and began subsidizing service between Framingham and Boston. Commuter rail service between Worcester and Framingham (with no intermediate stops after 1960) was not subsidized by the MBTA; with just ten riders per day riding from Worcester, service was cut back to Framingham on October 27, 1975. Amtrak began operating a Boston-Albany section of the \"Lake Shore Limited\" four days later. Boston-New Haven (Inland Route) service was restored under the \"Bay State\" name in 1984, and ran in various forms until the early 2000s.\n\nThe trackage on the western segment was inherited by Conrail in 1976, which returned to profitability in the 1980s; after a corporate breakup in 1999, CSX Transportation became the owner of the Worcester-to-Framingham segment. Service along the remaining Boston-Framingham segment was considerably increased in October 1979; this was intended to partially compensate for the closure of the Needham Line that month to make room for Southwest Corridor construction. As part of the Southwest Corridor project, the Orange Line was rerouted into parallel tracks sharing the Framingham Line's right of way between Back Bay station and the portal to the Washington Street Tunnel.\n\nMBTA commuter rail service expanded to Worcester on September 26, 1994 with limited rush-hour-only service. Off-peak service was added beginning on December 14, 1996. Worcester Union Station underwent a major renovation in 2000, and in 2006 the city's main bus terminal was co-located at the train station. Infill stations at , , , and were added in 2000 and 2002. The total cost of the Worcester Commuter Rail Extension Project was $97 million.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the line had some of the worst on-time performance in the MBTA system for several years. While state agencies including the MBTA owned the line out to Framingham, CSX Transportation owned from Framingham to Worcester and ran frequent freight trains as far east as Beacon Park Yard in Allston. CSX then dispatched (controlled signals) on the line from their operations base in Selkirk, New York, resulting in low priority for passenger trains. Conflicts with freight trains, ongoing track work, and an increase of passenger load of about 40% since opening were all blamed for the poor on-time performance, as were new federal speed regulations that went into effect in 2005.\n\nIn 2007, pessimistic that CSX would ever sell the line, the state Executive Office of Transportation began studying alternatives to improve service. Possibilities included adding interlockings or additional tracks to the line, or even running service from Worcester to North Station via over the Pan Am Railways Worcester Branch (former Worcester, Nashua and Rochester Railroad) and the Fitchburg Line.\n\nIn October 2007, only 48.4% of trains ran on time (no more than 1 minute early or 5 minutes late), improving to 69.3% in January 2008 after CSX and MBCR officials began meeting daily. On February 18, 2008, a new schedule went into effect, intended to more accurately reflect the run time on the line. By August 2009, actual on-time performance was at 82%.\n\nIn January 2008, the Framingham/Worcester Line became the first in the MBTA system to offer Wi-Fi service aboard the trains. The service was expanded system-wide after a test period, but the Worcester Line was chosen for the pilot phase in part to compensate for low on-time performance, as well as to test the service across the line's varied terrain.\n\nOn October 2, 2008, the state government announced an agreement with CSX Transportation for the purchase and upgrade of several of CSX's freight lines in the state. CSX agreed to sell the Framingham-to-Worcester section of the Worcester Line, its lines from Taunton to Fall River and New Bedford for use by the South Coast Rail project, the Grand Junction Branch,and the South Boston Running Track. Other parts of the agreement included plans for double-stack freights west of Worcester and the abandonment of Beacon Park Yard. Weekday Worcester service was increased to twelve round trips on October 27, 2008 under the agreement. The agreement was signed on September 23, 2009, with the Worcester Line transfer then expected in 2011.\n\nIn June 2012, New Balance announced plans to build a new station stop at their new development in Allston-Brighton. was originally to open in 2014, but has since been delayed to 2016.\n\nIn July 2012, the MBTA announced plans to add additional service on the line as CSX moves freight transload operations from Beacon Park Yard in Allston to a new yard in East Worcester that does not interfere with passenger operations. Three additional weekday Boston-Worcester round trips were added on October 29, 2012 after the October 4 signing of the deed that transferred ownership of the Framingham-Worcester section to the MBTA. A rush-hour express serving Worcester was added on April 29, 2013. The ultimate goal was originally for 20 Worcester round trips by October 2013, up from 12.5 round trips before the service increases; however this was pushed back by delays in the rebuilding of Yawkey station and the delivery of the new MPI HSP46 locomotives and bilevel passenger cars.\n\nBy early 2013, Beacon Park was largely vacated except for the locomotive maintenance facility, leaving only occasional freight service east of Framingham. MBCR took over dispatching of the line from CSX in August 2013, meaning that passenger trains are now given full priority over freight trains. The dispatching changeover brings other benefits for passenger service: MBCR has greater flexibility to deal with minor emergencies affecting operations, to communicate directly with train crews, and to dispatch extra trains to cover for a late or stalled train. Blanket heat-related speed restrictions were intended to be eliminated, limiting delays even on hotter summer days.\n\nA series of public comment hearings in 2013 were held to determine schedules. Implementation of the new schedules was delayed because the completion of Yawkey station's rehabilitation and expansion was delayed. The expansion included installation of a second track, crucial to the service expansion. The increase to 20 weekday and 9 weekend round trips to Worcester took place on March 10, 2014.\nThe MBTA has long been planning to speed travel times on the line by adding a second main track through Beacon Park Yard – the only single-track section of the line. The former second track through the yard was turned into a yard lead with no through service in the 1950s.\n\nIn November 2013, MassDOT announced plans to spend $15 million through 2014 and 2015 to improve travel times on the line. Some of the work involves heating and cutting quarter-mile rail segments to eliminate heat kinks. The promised reduction in heat-related speed restrictions has not yet occurred due to the poor condition of the tracks; the work to reduce them started in 2014 with $1.2 million in work between Worcester and Grafton, but will not be complete until 2016.\n\nIn early 2014, MassDOT proposed DMU local service for the inner part of the line as part of the \"Indigo Line\". In September 2014, MassDOT announced plans to build the multimodal in Beacon Park Yard as a transfer point between local DMU service and mainline locomotive-hauled commuter rail service. The $25 million station would have been constructed simultaneously with a $260 million reconfiguration of the Mass Pike through Beacon Park Yard and was planned to open in 2020.

She was a member of two gold medal-winning World Championships teams and was the 1998 European Champion on the floor exercise.\n\nUngureanu began gymnastics at the Petrolul Ploieşti club in her hometown of Ploieşti, but spent the major part of her career training in Bucharest under Leana Sima. In the national training center in Deva, she was coached by Octavian Belu. Ungureanu's first international assignment was a junior dual meet between Romania and Germany, where she placed first with her team and eighth in the all-around. She resurfaced on the international scene again in 1996, when she won the all-around title at the EcoAir Cup. She did not compete in the 1996 Olympics, but was a member of the gold medal-winning Romanian teams at the 1997 and 1999 World Gymnastics Championships. She was forced to retire in 1999 due to a spinal cord injury.\n\nAfter retiring from gymnastics, she sparked some controversy by posing nude for the January 2000 edition of Playboy Romania. These pictures were reprinted in Playboy Japan in May 2000 and led to her producing a nude photobook, , in Japan later that year. In 2002, along with former teammates Lavinia Miloșovici and Claudia Presăcan, Ungureanu appeared in two Japanese DVDs, \"Gold Bird\" and \"Euro Angels\", which included scenes of the three gymnasts performing gymnastics routines topless. A second nude photobook, \"LCC Gold\" , appeared at the same time. A number of photographs from the photobook and DVDs were subsequently published in the Japanese magazine \"Shukan Gendai\". An edited version of the DVDs entitled \"3 Gold Girls\" was released in Germany in 2004.\n\nThe DVDs proved controversial as some of the scenes and publicity material featured the gymnasts in their official Romanian team leotards. It later emerged that they had not been aware of the contractual obligation to wear their official leotards until filming had already begun . In the wake of the controversy, Ungureanu and her former teammates were banned from coaching or competing in Romania from 2002 to 2007. To compensate, Ungureanu spent some time coaching in Italy.\n\nIn 2004, her authorized biography, \"Corina Ungureanu: Beginning and End\", written by Laurian Stãnchescu was published. Ungureanu is now also a spokesmodel for Bucovina SA, a bottled water company in Romania. She currently manages a coffee shop called New Haven in Ploieşti with her boyfriend.

They were managed in the later stage of their pairing by Gail Kim.\n\nThe team became one of the greatest tag teams in TNA's history, legitimately credited with putting the TNA tag team division on the map, and engaging in many feuds with such teams as The Disciples of The New Church, The Naturals, Team Canada, 3Live Kru, Triple X (with whom they had NWA's Match of the Year in 2004) and Team 3D. Chris Harris and James Storm are 6 times NWA World Tag Team Champions together a record for those championships as a team.\n\nBefore the tag team was formed, James Storm and Chris Harris were occasional rivals on the independent circuit. They wrestled each other in the TNA tryout show, and did so well that show alone got them jobs at TNA. In the DVD \"The History of TNA: Year 1\", Chris Harris remembers being backstage after the match, and TNA founder Jeff Jarrett winked at him and told him he would be in touch. They were brought together at NWA:TNA PPV on June 26, 2002, when another tag team called The Dupps refused to fight the Rainbow Express (Lenny and Bruce). Storm and Harris won the match, and joined forces from then on.\n\nOn September 18, NWA:TNA PPV, AMW participated in a 20-man Gauntlet for the Gold match for the vacant NWA World Tag Team Championship. AMW and Disciples of The New Church (Brian Lee and Slash) were the finalists of this Gauntlet and then a tag team match began for the vacant titles. AMW went on to win the match and their first NWA World Tag Team Championship. They began feuding with Lee and Slash and had a dominant reign as they defended the titles against almost all the teams of TNA. On the November 13 PPV, they dropped the titles to Lee and Slash. They regained the titles, however, on the January 8, 2003 PPV, by defeating Disciples of The New Church.\n\nTwo weeks later, they lost the titles to Triple X (Low Ki and Elix Skipper). On March 26, the problems started between AMW because Harris was doing a singles match. On April 9, it was rumored that Harris might join Sports Entertainment Xtreme (S.E.X.) because Harris was found in the S.E.X. locker room. The tensions continued as Storm walked out on Harris on April 23 during a match against Elix Skipper and Christopher Daniels. The duo faced each other in a singles match on May 7 which Storm won. After the match, Storm teased the breakup and then shook hands with Harris. Harris teamed up with Chris Sabin in the number one contenders' Anarchy Alliance tag team tournament with the winners getting a title shot at the NWA World Tag Team Championship. Harris and Sabin qualified in the first round, but in the second round, Harris' partner James Storm replaced Sabin and the duo won the second round match. After the match, Harris refused to join S.E.X. and reaffirmed his partnership with Storm. On June 11, AMW won the Anarchy Alliance tournament by defeating David Young and Tracy Brookshaw in the finals and getting themselves a title shot at the NWA World Tag Team Championship.\n\nOn June 25, they finally defeated Triple X in a great steel cage match to win their third NWA World Tag Team Championship. This was a historic match in the history of TNA's tag team division and AMW would become popular. They began feuding with the team of Simon and Swinger against whom they had two title defenses in a row. On the August 20 PPV, they lost a non-title match Bullrope match to Diamond and Swinger which earned the duo a tag title match. The next week, AMW dropped the titles to Diamond and Swinger.\n\nIn early 2004, they feuded with Red Shirt Security (Kevin Northcutt and Legend) after AMW defeated New York Connection (Glen Gilberti and David Young). On the January 21 PPV, they lost to Red Shirt Security in a number one contender's tag team match. On June 4 edition of \"Impact!\", AMW defeated Kid Kash and Dallas to win their fourth NWA World Tag Team Championship. They defended the titles against many teams during their fourth reign before losing the titles to The Naturals (Chase Stevens and Andy Douglas) on July 7 PPV in 12 seconds. Two weeks later, they faced Naturals in a Six Sides of Steel match for the titles but lost the match.\n\nThey began feuding with Naturals while they also feuded with Triple X. On September 1, Naturals defeated Triple X and AMW in a triple threat tag team match to retain the tag titles. The next week, Storm wasn't cleared to wrestle while Christopher Daniels was injured, so AMW's Harris teamed up with Triple X's Elix Skipper to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship from Naturals. On September 24 edition of \"Impact!\", Storm teamed up with Daniels to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship. They ended up losing the titles to Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young) on October 15 edition of \"Impact!\". AMW entered a feud with Triple X. They defeated them in an Elimination Last Man Standing match at Victory Road 2004. After that, they agreed to a Six Sides of Steel match at Turning Point 2004 where the losing team would separate. AMW won the grueling match, ending Triple X and winning the feud once and for all.\n\nAt Final Resolution 2005, they defeated Team Canada to win their fifth NWA World Tag Team Championship. They lost the titles to The Naturals on April 29, 2005 edition of \"Impact!\". At Hard Justice 2005, they lost to the Naturals in a rematch for the titles.\n\nAt Unbreakable, AMW took part in a fatal four-way tag team elimination match challenging The Naturals for the tag team titles, which also involved Team Canada and the team of Johnny Candido and Alex Shelley. On September 15, 2005, AMW turned into a villain by siding with Jeff Jarrett and Team Canada, helping Jarrett win back the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Raven in Canada. The team then served as enforcers and backup for Jeff Jarrett and Gail Kim. At Bound for Glory, they successfully retained their titles against The Naturals. They had also sparked up a rivalry with Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon), assaulting them and leaving them bloody in the ring when they debuted and staging a mock funeral for their careers afterwards. At Genesis 2005, Jarrett and AMW lost to Team 3D and Rhino. At Turning Point 2005, they lost to Team 3D in a Tables match. After Team 3D defeated AMW in non-title matches, they got a title shot at Final Resolution 2006, which AMW won and retained the titles.\n\nAMW's sixth and final reign as the NWA Tag Team Champions was also the longest reign in the belt's history since its revived inception in 1998. They became the longest-reigning NWA World Tag Team Champions in TNA history on March 29, 2006, surpassing The Naturals reign of 24 weeks. In the summer of 2006, they feuded with A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels. They successfully defended the titles against Styles and Daniels at Sacrifice 2006, before dropping the titles to them at Slammiversary 2006. After losing the belts they once again turned into fan favorites and started feuding with The Latin American Xchange (Homicide and Hernandez) in the fall of the year. At Genesis 2006, they unsuccessfully challenged LAX for the NWA Tag Team Championship. At Turning Point 2006, AMW lost a flag match to LAX. When Storm hit Homicide with a beer bottle, glass flew into the eyes of Harris. Storm blamed the loss on Harris. AMW got a re-match on the December 14, 2006 edition of \"Impact!\" in a \"Titles vs. Team\" match with the stipulation that AMW would have to split up if they lost. They lost after Storm deliberately hit Harris with a beer bottle.\n\nStorm and Harris feuded soon afterwards, ending AMW. Afterwards, Gail left and was replaced by Jackie Moore as Storm's manager. Storm officially turned heel and would later begin teaming with former Team Canada member Robert Roode to form \"Beer Money, Inc.\" with Jackie Moore as their manager and winning the TNA World Tag Team Championship together four times. Harris ended up departing TNA and joined rival promotion World Wrestling Entertainment, wrestling on its ECW brand under the name Braden Walker before being released from his WWE contract only two weeks later. Kim went on to headline TNA's Women's Division by becoming the inaugural TNA Knockouts Champion before parting ways with TNA. Since then, Harris has been wrestling on the independent circuit while Gail Kim returned to WWE for a time before rejoining TNA's Women's Division. On May 12, 2011, Harris returned to TNA as a member of the heel group Immortal and tag team partner of Matt Hardy, challenging Beer Money, Inc. for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, but was pinned after receiving AMW's signature move, the Death Sentence. On October 20, 2011, James Storm defeated Kurt Angle to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the first time.\n\n\n\n"}

She began studying violin at age 4. At age 14, she graduated from Neodesha High School, where her father was superintendent. DeLay studied for one year at the Oberlin Conservatory with Raymond Cerf, a student of César Thomson, and transferred to broaden her education at Michigan State University, where she earned a B.A. in 1937 at age 20. She then entered the Juilliard Graduate School, where she studied with Louis Persinger, Hans Letz, and Felix Salmond.\n\nShe was the founder of the Stuyvesant Trio (1939–42) with her cellist sister Nellis DeLay and pianist Helen Brainard, and she played with Leopold Stokowski's All-American Youth Orchestra. While touring with this orchestra in 1940, she met Edward Newhouse, a novelist and writer for The New Yorker, and they married four months later in 1941. They had a son, Jeffrey Newhouse and a daughter Alison Newhouse Dinsmore.\n\nIn addition to many honorary degrees, Miss DeLay received the National Medal of Arts in 1994, the National Music Council's American Eagle Award in 1995, the Sanford Medal from Yale University in 1997 and the Order of the Sacred Treasure from the Japanese Government in 1998.\nIn 1975, she was recognized by the American String Teachers Association (ASTA) with their Artist Teacher Award.\n\nDorothy DeLay died from cancer in New York City at the age of 84. She was survived by her husband, Edward Newhouse, two children, and four grandchildren.\nBy the mid-1940s, DeLay decided that she did not want to continue as a performer.\nIn 1946, she returned to Juilliard to study with Ivan Galamian,\nbecoming his assistant in 1948.\nIn addition to teaching at Juilliard, she taught at Sarah Lawrence College (1947–1987), the University of Cincinnati – College-Conservatory of Music (30 years until 2001), the New England Conservatory, the Meadowmount School of Music and the Aspen Music Festival and School, among others.\n\nHer former students include many noted violinists of the late 20th century. She assisted Galamian with Itzhak Perlman. She also taught Anne Akiko Meyers, Albert Stern, Midori Goto, Akiko Suwanai, Sarah Chang, Philippe Quint, Kurt Sassmannshaus, Gong Qian Yang, Cho-Liang Lin, Chin Kim, Ray Iwazumi, \nShunsuke Sato, Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, Angèle Dubeau, Pierre Ménard, Dmitri Berlinsky, Nigel Kennedy, Alyssa Park, Yoon Kwon, Misha Keylin, Shlomo Mintz, Gil Shaham, Dezso and Tibor Vaghy (of the Vaghy String Quartet), Fudeko Takahashi, William Fitzpatrick, Vilhelmas Čepinskis, Brian Lewis, and Li Chuan Yun, Brian Dembow (violist of the Grammy Award-winning Angeles String Quartet), among others. She also taught many significant orchestral musicians and pedagogues, such as Simon Fischer, author of \"Basics\"; Paul Kantor, pedagogue at Rice University; Chicago Symphony Orchestra Concertmaster Robert Chen; Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra concertmaster Frank Almond; violinist and pedagogue Anton Miller; Philadelphia Orchestra Concertmaster David Kim; Liu Yang, and Lü Siqing, first Asian violinist to win 1st Prize at the Paganini Competition in Italy, among others.\n\nIn a 1992 interview, Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg said: \"I think the greatest thing about Dorothy DeLay is that she has the ability to look at a young student or an old student and pretty much size up their character and the way that they think — their personality, basically — and how in a short period of time what's the best door to use to get them into here. And that's her method — the fact that there is really no method.\"\n\nItzhak Perlman said of DeLay's pedagogic approach: \"I would come and play for her, and if something was not quite right, it wasn't like she was going to kill me. She would ask questions about what you thought of particular phrases—where the top of the phrase was, and so on. We would have a very friendly, interesting discussion about 'Why do you think it should sound like this?' and 'What do you think of that?' I was not quite used to this way of approaching things.\"\n\nDeLay's students have gone forward to solo careers, principal orchestra positions with the world's leading orchestras, and have gone on to win many of the major violin competitions of the world.\n\nIn 2003, Itzhak Perlman was appointed to his teacher's position at Juilliard, the Dorothy Richard Starling Chair of Violin Studies. The position was established in 1997 with a leadership grant from the Dorothy Richard Starling Foundation to The Campaign for Juilliard and was held by DeLay until the time of her death in March 2002.\n\n\nFor an in-depth profile of Miss DeLay, see Helen Epstein's book \"Music Talks\", now on Kindle.

They are marked with yellow-green speckling, which provides excellent camouflage in their rocky habitat of lichen-covered rocks and schist outcrops. Like most skinks, grand skinks are omnivores and feed on a wide variety of insects and fleshy fruits.\n\nGrand skinks are only found in very specific locations in Otago, and are typically limited to the large schist rock outcroppings found in that region.

A part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco, this school provides education for young men. The school has an academic focus with a college preparatory curriculum.\n\nSerra High School was founded in 1944 by the Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco and was originally located at Columbia Drive and Alameda de las Pulgas in San Mateo, which is the current site of St. Bartholomew's Catholic Parish. The original student body consisted of 86 freshmen and sophomores. The school moved to new facilities at 451 West 20th Avenue in San Mateo in the fall of 1955 when the student body grew to 576. In 1978, Michael Peterson was named the first lay principal of Serra and Fr. Stephen H. Howell was named the school's first president. From 2002-2004, Fr. Joe Bradley served as president, overseeing fundraising efforts for major campus renovation. In 2008, Barry Thornton, Ed.d, was named principal and Lars Lund was named president. Under their tenure, the school expanded course offerings and completed large-scale renovations.\n\nMore than 60 percent of Serra students are enrolled in honors and Advanced Placement courses. Serra has averaged an 80 percent AP pass rate over the past five years, which is more than 20 points higher than the national average. Serra's Class of 2018 received more than $27 million in college scholarships.\nSerra has a one-to-one device program in each classroom and 99 percent of Serra graduates exceed the minimum course requirements set for the CSU and the University of California. Serra features 30 honors and AP classes, and 93 percent of Serra faculty members hold advanced degrees.\n\nThe Serra athletic program has grown dramatically since its very modest beginnings in the mid-1940s. For a time in the years after World War II, the San Mateo school offered just three sports: Football, basketball, and baseball. Boxing was also available, particularly on one night of the year when so-called student \"Golden Gloves\" competition was presented. Early on, Serra joined an embryonic Catholic Athletic League, a Bay Area-wide aggregation of what were then small Catholic schools. The Padres had some significant successes in that circuit. Two of its varsity football teams were unbeaten in 1949 and 1954; those remain the only unblemished football teams in school history. Serra captured five CAL baseball championships and seven CAL football crowns. In 1967, as new Catholic schools were opening throughout the region, the Padres joined what was a direct outgrowth of the CAL, the new West Catholic Athletic League. Since that point, Serra's athletic program has flourished.\n\nNow, the school offers 14 competitive team sports. Stars like Tom Brady, Lynn Swann, and Barry Bonds, among others, all came onto the scene as Serra stretched its sporting legs in the WCAL. As time went by, the Padres became one of Northern California's signature prep sports entities and the league itself morphed into a state powerhouse. As of early 2018, the school had won 67 WCAL varsity titles, 31 Central Coast Section championships, and two state crowns (basketball in 2016 and football in 2017). Serra athletes had garnered individual state championships in several sports. A number of them had become Olympians. A total of 11 Serra baseball players, including the record-setting Bonds, have played in the major leagues; Jim Fregosi, Serra's first big league star, also managed several teams in the majors. Nearly a dozen Padres have played professional football. Brady and Swann, an all-American at USC and a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, were both Super Bowl MVP's. Tom Scott is in the Canadian Football League Hall of Fame. In the mid-1970s, Jesse Freitas led the nation in passing at San Diego State. One of the most dominating exhibitions by a Serra football team occurred in 2017 when the Padres, coached by Patrick Walsh, posted an overall 13-2 record (10-0 vs. WCAL foes, a feat never accomplished before in the history of the league) and won a California Interscholastic Federation state championship, the first for a San Mateo County high school football team since 1926.\n\nPhase I of Serra's master plan was completed in 2005, featuring new facilities for football, baseball, and wrestling, along with a 150-space parking structure. Phase II was completed in 2011, and created five new science lecture-labs, a new music room, two art classrooms, an academic resource center, and a 550,000-gallon infinity pool for competitive aquatics. In 2016, Serra undertook a smaller project, renovating the playing surfaces used for baseball, football, soccer, lacrosse, and track.\n\n\nJunípero Serra High School is a Roman Catholic school. It offers faith and theology education through its Campus Ministry program and curriculum. Campus Ministry offers four-day-long Kairos retreats, retreat leadership opportunities, liturgical leadership opportunities and Immersion trips to Watsonville, West Virginia, Nicaragua, San Jose and Los Angeles. The Campus Ministry office also manages the school's Christian Service program. Theology courses offer instruction in the Catholic faith, morality and worship, and stress the importance of individual faith development.\n\nJunipero Serra High School is a part of a program called \"Tri-School\", a partnership with Notre Dame High School, Belmont, and Mercy High School, Burlingame, both all-female schools. The schools host some morning classes with mixed education and collaborate in other activities as well.\n\n"}

Localities in which caledonite occurs as well developed crystals are quite rare and include the Mammoth-St. Anthony Mine at Tiger, Arizona, a few mines in California, such as the Reward Mine. A few other mines in Arizona and Chile have been known to produce samples. \n\nGiven that caledonite is found in oxidized copper/lead deposits, it is frequently found in association with other copper and lead minerals. Frequently associated minerals include: linarite, malachite, cerussite, brochantite, anglesite, leadhillite, and azurite.\n\nCaledonite's blue color is a useful indicator, but insufficient, especially since one of its associates, linarite, is a vivid blue as well. Useful tests for determining if a specimen is caledonite include its density, streak, and crystal habit.\n\n"}

The city is located above sea level on the Langbian Plateau in the southern parts of the Central Highlands region. Da Lat is a popular tourist destination in Vietnam.\n\nDa Lat's specific sights are pine wood (forming the name: \"City of thousands of pine trees\") with twisting roads and tree marigold (Vietnamese: \"dã quỳ\") blossom in the winter. The city's temperate weather stands in contrast to Vietnam's otherwise tropical climate. Mist covering the valleys almost year-round leads to its name \"City of the Eternal Spring\".\n\nDa Lat is also known as an area for scientific research in the fields of biotechnology and nuclear physics.\n\nWith its year-round cool weather, Da Lat supplies temperate agriculture products for all over Vietnam, for example: cabbage, cauliflower, coffee and wine. Its flower industry produces two typical flowers: hydrangea (Vietnamese: \"cẩm tú cầu\") and golden everlasting (Vietnamese: \"hoa bất tử\"). The confectionery industry offers a wide range of \"mứt\", a kind of fruit preserve that closely resembles varenie, made from strawberry, mulberry, sweet potato, and/or rose.\n\nDa Lat is known regionally for avocado ice-cream, for bánh tráng nướng (Vietnamese pizza), and for its large garment market, with broad selection of cool-weather clothes.\n\nAccording to some sources, the name derives from the acronym of the Latin phrase 'Dat Aliis Laetitiam Aliis Temperiem' (\"It Gives Pleasure to Some, Freshness to Others\"), which the French colonial government used in their official emblem of Đà Lạt. In reality, the name Da Lat derived from the language of the local ethnic group Lạt and its original meaning is \"Stream of the Lạt\", and the acronym above is in fact a backcronym.\n\nDuring the 1890s, explorers in the area (including the noted bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, protégé of the renowned French chemist Louis Pasteur), which was then part of the French colony of Cochinchina, asked the French governor-general, Paul Doumer, to create a resort center in the highlands. The governor agreed. The original intended site for the hill station was Dankia, but Étienne Tardif, a member of the road-building expedition of 1898–99, proposed the current site instead. In 1907, the first hotel was built. Urban planning was carried out by Ernest Hébrard.\nMany Europeans used to travel up to Da Lat to escape the heat of the lower coastal areas . \n\nThe French endowed the city with villas and boulevards, and its Swiss charms remain today. Hébrard included the requisite health complex, golf course, parks, schools, and homes but no industry. The legacy of boarding schools where children from the whole of Indochina were taught by French priests, nuns, and expatriates still existed as late as 1969. In 1929, the Christian and Missionary Alliance established a school which later relocated to Bangkok, Thailand, due to the Vietnam War and has been located in Penang, Malaysia, since the 1970s. There were seminaries of Jesuits (such as Pius X Pontifical College) and other orders. The elite Vietnamese National Military Academy graduated its first class of future leaders in 1950. There was an aviation school at Cam Ly Airport.\n\nDuring World War II, Da Lat was the capital of the Federation of Indochina, from 1939 to 1945.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the Vietnamese Scout Association established their national training grounds at Da Lat.\n\nThe only major involvement Da Lat had during the Vietnam War was within the 1968 Tet Offensive. Fierce battles raged from January 31 to February 9, 1968. Most of the fighting took place between the South Vietnamese MP units stationed in Da Lat and the Việt Cộng (VC) forces. American MPs were also involved in the fighting and suffered several KIAs during a rocket attack on their compound. Defeats and victories alternated between the two during the sporadic-yet-intense battles. However, the South Vietnamese MPs were eventually able to regain control of Đà Lạt. It is stated that around 200 VC were killed-in-action (KIAs) during this battle. Although South Vietnamese MP forces were known to have significantly fewer KIAs, their injured list grew steadily throughout the engagement because of periods of low supplies and support. What ultimately saved the South Vietnamese MPs was the fact that they held strong defensive positions throughout Da Lat from the beginning to the end of the battles.\n\nDa Lat is located above sea level on the Langbian Plateau in the southern parts of the Central Highlands (in Vietnamese: \"Tây Nguyên\").\n\nDa Lat is a source area for pyroxene from the Australasian strewnfield.\n\nDa Lat is divided into 12 wards which are numbered 1 to 12, and 4 communes: Ta Nung, Xuan Truong, Xuan Tho and Tram Hanh.\n\nDa Lat features a subtropical highland climate under the Köppen climate classification (\"Cwb\") and is mostly mild year round.\n\nDa Lat's year-round temperate weather, standing in contrast to central & southern Vietnam's otherwise-tropical climate, has led it to be nicknamed the “City of Eternal Spring”. The average temperature is . The highest temperature ever in Da Lat was , and the lowest was . Mist covers the adjoining valleys almost year-round. Its temperate climate also makes it ideal for agriculture. Indeed, Da Lat is renowned for its orchids, roses, vegetables, and fruits. There are nascent wine-making and flower-growing industries in the region.\n\nThere are two separate seasons in Da Lat. The rainy season lasts from April to November, and the dry season is from December to March. The average annual precipitation is 1,768 mm.\n\nThe architecture of Đà Lạt is dominated by the style of the French colonial period. Đà Lạt Railway Station, built in 1938, was designed in the Art Deco architectural style by French architects Moncet and Reveron, although it incorporates the high, pointed roofs characteristic of the \"Cao Nguyen\" communal buildings of Vietnam's Central Highlands. The three gables represent an art deco version of Normandy's Trouville-Deauville Station. The station's unique design—with its roofs, arching ceiling, and coloured glass windows—earned it recognition as a national historical monument in 2001. \nThey designed the Lycée Yersin, which opened in 1927.\nThe Dominion of Mary Church and Convent, home to Roman Catholic nuns of the Mission of Charity, were built in 1938 with a similar pointed-roof style.\nOf particular note is the unconventional architecture of the Hằng Nga guesthouse, popularly known as the “Crazy House”. Described as a “fairy tale house”, its overall design resembles a giant banyan tree, incorporating sculptured design elements representing natural forms such as animals, mushrooms, spider webs and caves. Its architecture, consisting of complex, organic, non-rectilinear shapes, has been described as expressionist. Its creator, Vietnamese architect Dang Viet Nga (also known as Hằng Nga), who holds a PhD in architecture from Moscow State University, has acknowledged the inspiration of Catalan Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí in the building's design. Visitors have variously drawn parallels between the guesthouse and the works of artists such as Salvador Dalí and Walt Disney. Since its opening in 1990, the building has gained recognition for its unique architecture, having been highlighted in numerous guidebooks and listed as one of the world's ten most “bizarre” buildings in the Chinese People's Daily. While superficially amusing, the compound is let down by the construction debris and household refuse behind the facades, and the lack of attention to safety issues.\nĐà Lạt is also well known for a series of three Mansions of the Vietnamese Last Emperor. The First Mansion was built in 1940 by the French millionaire Robert Clément Bourgery and was bought by Emperor Bao Dai in 1949. It was used as a summer mansion for President Ngo Dinh Diem and following presidents of the Republic of Vietnam until 1975. The Second Mansion was built in 1933 as the summer mansion for Governor of French Indochina Jean Decoux. Built in 1933–1938, the Third Mansion was the residence of Emperor Bao Dai and his family. The whole mansion itself attributes to the typical European style since both its front and backyard have flower gardens. The Third Mansion is currently open for tourists who wish to have a look back in time when Queen Nam Phuong resided during her lifetime.\n\n\n\nDa Lat is a famous tourist city of Vietnam which was included in the list of Asia's overlooked places by the CNN in 2017.\n\nHoa Binh Area is the center downtown of Da Lat which attracted numerous visitors. Some popular sites located at Hoa Binh Area are Coi Xay Gio bakery, Lien Hoa bakery, Windmills coffeehouse and Tung coffeehouse. Coi Xay Gio is known as a perfect selfie spot thanks to its remarkable yellow wall.\n\n\n\n"}

Grasshopper Glacier is approximately long and wide. Starting at a point more than above sea level, the glacier originally was more than long but has receded significantly since first researched in the early 20th century. As of 2007, the glacier consists of several smaller glaciers, each occupying a different north-facing cirque. Grasshopper Glacier was named for the tens of millions of grasshoppers (locusts) that have been found entombed in the ice, some for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years. Many of the grasshoppers are of species that are now extinct, and their high level of preservation allowed early researchers to send some specimens to entomologists for identification. During this research it was discovered that some of the grasshoppers were of the extinct species \"Melanoplus spretus\" (Rocky Mountain locust), known to have existed at least up to the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nKnown to travel in swarms numbering in the trillions in some years, it is believed that the grasshoppers found in the glacier may have been caught in severe storms and perished. Until the late 20th century, the grasshopper remains were quite common; however, lower snowfall rates since the late 1980s and higher temperatures have contributed to a higher melting rate of the glacier and many specimens decompose before they can be retrieved.\n\nAccess to the glacier is difficult due to poor weather conditions and the requirement to travel via off road vehicle and then hike on foot several miles to the base of the glacier. The road is impassable for up to 10 months of the year. The Beartooth Highway (U.S. 212) is one of the closest access roads. Two smaller glaciers in the immediate region also have the same species of grasshoppers entombed in their ice; one is also named Grasshopper Glacier, the other simply Hopper Glacier. Other glaciers also bear the name for the same reason, including one in the Crazy Mountains north/northwest of the Beartooths, and Grasshopper Glacier in the Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming.\n\n"}

The game features Mega Man fighting against the mad scientist Dr. Wily and the six Robot Masters under his control. The game features Robot Masters and stages from \"Mega Man 4\" and \"Mega Man 5\".\n\n\"Mega Man\" received generally positive reviews from video game critics upon release, though retrospective reviews was more mixed. Due to being exclusive to North America, copies of the game go for US$400. \n\n\"Mega Man\" is an action-platform game that is very similar to the original series. The protagonist, Mega Man, is able to run, jump, shoot, and climb his way past obstacles and enemies. It is based on elements from the Nintendo Entertainment System versions of \"Mega Man 4\" and \"Mega Man 5\". Differences include a lack of continues (if the game is over, it restarts to the title), the addition of vertical scrolling, powerups bouncing when they hit the ground, and a hard difficulty mode (though the player has to get at least a password from this mode, since both difficulties don't share the same passwords).\n\nThe Robot Masters featured at the beginning are Bright Man, Napalm Man, Star Man, and Stone Man. Dr. Cossack's fortress contains Wave Man's and Toad Man's levels and respective bosses. Wily's fortress is Quick Man's stage from \"Mega Man 2\", though the player is taken to a condensed Dr. Wily stage after going through the first boss door instead. The ending features Dr. Cossack's fortress being destroyed.\n\n\"Mega Man\" was published by British-based publisher U.S. Gold. The \"Mega Man\" series was created by Japanese-based company Capcom. U.S. Gold sublicensed the series from Capcom and had a different company, Freestyle, develop the game. It was released exclusively in North America on the Game Gear in 1995.\n\nReception to the game was generally positive. \"Mega Man\" received an 87% from the UK-based magazine \"Sega Power\". \"GamePro\" gave the game a total score of 3.75 out of 5, complimenting its graphics and sound, but noting that the small Game Gear screen increases the difficulty. Mean Machines gave it a 75%.\n\nRetrospective reviews for the game have been mixed. 1UP.com's Nadia Oxford elaborated, \"Mega Man often has to fight with his enemies in such close quarters, he might as well hold their hands and try his luck at a friendship. The constant screen-scrolling and sticky controls makes for a very frustrating game, although the Game Gear's low battery life ends the torment in a couple of hours anyway.\" GameSpot contributors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer described it as \"a decent, if somewhat sluggish, translation of the \"Mega Man\" series\". Damien Butt from Retro Gamer, while giving it praise for its graphics, was more mixed towards its gameplay, criticizing its difficulty and the enemies moving too fast for the player. Robert Workman for \"GameZone\" believed the game deserved a second chance for re-release, praising it for its controls, visuals, and sound.\n\nIn 2013, due to an ESRB listing, there was speculation that the Game Gear title was being released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console. Despite the listing, nothing came of it. Because of the game's North American exclusivity, copies of the game garner a high price point, with complete copies going for $400.\n"}

{"id": "1994430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994430", "title": "Soviet partisans", "text": "Soviet partisans\n\nThe Soviet partisans were members of resistance movements that fought a guerrilla war against the Axis forces in the Soviet Union, the previously Soviet-occupied territories of interwar Poland in 1941–45 and eastern Finland. The activity emerged after Nazi Germany's Operation Barbarossa was executed during World War II, and it was coordinated and controlled by the Soviet government and modeled on that of the Red Army. The partisans made significant contributions to the war by frustrating German plans to exploit occupied Soviet territories economically, gave considerable help to the Soviet Army by conducting systematic strikes against Germany's rear communication network, disseminated political work among the local population by publishing newspapers and leaflets, and succeeded in creating and maintaining a feeling of insecurity among German forces.\n\nSoviet partisans also operated on Polish, Ukrainian and Baltic territories occupied by the Soviet Union in 1939–1940, but they had significantly less support there and often clashed violently with local pro-independence and pro-Western national partisan groups, as well as pro-Nazi, German-backed police.\n\nAfter the German invasion of Poland in 1939, which marked the beginning of World War II, the Soviet Union invaded the eastern regions of the Second Polish Republic (referred to as the \"Kresy\") and annexed the lands totalling with a population of 13,299,000 inhabitants including ethnic Belarusians, Ukrainians, Poles, Jews, Czechs and others. Soviet era sources state that in 1939, Soviet forces took control of regions of the Polish Republic that had \"a population of more than 12 million, including more than 6 million Ukrainians and about 3 million Belarusians.\"\n\nThe program of the partisan war was outlined in Moscow after the German attack in 1941 against the USSR. Directives issued on July 29, 1941 and in further documents by the Soviet People's Commissaries Council and Communist Party called for the formation of partisan detachments and 'diversionist' groups in the German-occupied territories. Joseph Stalin iterated his commands and directives to the people in his radio speech on 3 July 1941, and appointed himself Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army on 20 July 1941.\n\nIn 1941, the core of the partisan movement were the remains of the Red Army units destroyed in the first phase of Operation Barbarossa, personnel of destruction battalions, and the local Communist Party and Komsomol activists who chose to remain in Soviet-occupied prewar Poland. The most common unit of the period was a \"detachment\". The first detachments commanded by Red Army officers and local Communist Party activists were formed in the first days of the war between former allies Germany and the Soviet Union, including the \"Starasyel'ski\" detachment of Major Dorodnykh in the Zhabinka district (June 23, 1941) and the Pinsk detachment of Vasily Korzh on June 26, 1941. The first awards of the Hero of the Soviet Union order occurred on August 6, 1941 (detachment commanders Pavlovskiy and Bumazhkov). Some partisan detachments were parachuted into German-occupied territories in the summer of 1941. Urban underground groups were formed as a force complementing the activities of partisan units, operating in rural areas. The network of underground structures developed and received a steady influx of specially chosen party activists. By the end of 1941, more than 2,000 partisan detachments (with more than 90,000 personnel) operated in German-occupied territories.\n\nHowever, the activity of partisan forces were not centrally coordinated and supplied until spring of 1942. In order to coordinate partisan operations the Central Headquarters of the Partisan Movement under Stavka, headed by Panteleimon Ponomarenko (Chief of Staff) and initially commanded by top Politburo member Kliment Voroshilov, was organized on May 30, 1942. The Staff had its liaison networks in the Military Councils of the Fronts and Armies. The territorial Staffs were subsequently created, dealing with the partisan movement in the respective Soviet Republics and in the occupied provinces of the Russian SFSR.\n\nSome formations calling themselves Soviet partisans operated a long way outside Soviet territory - usually organized by former Soviet citizens who had escaped from Nazi camps. One such formation, \"Rodina\" (Motherland), acted in France. In 1944 Soviet partisans provided \"proletarian internationalist\" help to the people of German-occupied Central Europe, with seven united formations and 26 larger detachments operating in Poland, and 20 united formations and detachments operating in Czechoslovakia.\n\nBy Soviet estimates, in August 1941 about 231 detachments were operating already. Units formed and inserted into Belarus totaled 437 by the end of the 1941, comprising more than 7,200 personnel. However, as the front line moved further away, conditions steadily worsened for the partisan units, as resources ran out, and there was no large-scale support from beyond the front until March 1942. One particular difficulty was the lack of radio communication, which was not addressed until April 1942. The partisan unit also lacked the support of local people. For several months, partisan units in Belarus were virtually left to their own devices; especially difficult was the winter of 1941-1942, with severe shortages in ammunition, medicine and supplies. The actions of partisans were generally uncoordinated.\n\nGerman pacification operations in the summer and autumn 1941 were able to curb the partisan activity significantly. Many units went underground, and generally, in late 1941 to early 1942, the partisan units were not undertaking significant military operations, but limiting themselves to sorting out organizational problems, building up support and establishing an influence over the local people. Although data is incomplete, at the end of 1941, 99 partisan detachments and about 100 partisan groups are known to have operated in Belarus. In Winter 1941-1942, 50 partisan detachments and about 50 underground organisations and groups operated in Belarus. During December 1941, German guard forces in the Army Group Center rear comprised 4 security divisions, 1 SS Infantry Brigade, 2 SS Infantry Brigades, and 260 companies from different branches of service.\n\nBy the end of 1943, partisans controlled more than 100 thousand square km. of Belarus, which was about 60 percent of the republic's territory. The partisans controlled more than 20 regional centers and thousands of villages. By the time of the return of the Soviet Army, most of the Belorussian SSR was in the hands of the partisan groups and the actual size of the republic controlled by the Germans was small.\n\nThe turning point in the development of the Soviet partisan movement came with the opening of the Vitsyebsk gate, a corridor connecting Soviet-controlled and German-occupied territories, in February 1942. Soviet strategists started taking the partisan units into account after that. The Red Army organized centralized administrative and logistical support, and the Gate proved an important factor in assisting partisan detachments in occupied territory with weapons. As a result, the partisans were able to effectively undermine German troops and significantly hamper their operations in the region from April 1942 until the end of the year. Some Jews and lower-rank Soviet activists felt more secure in the partisan ranks than in civilian life under Soviet rule.\n\nIn spring 1942 the concentration of smaller partisan units into brigades began, prompted by the experience of the first year of war. The coordination, numerical buildup, structural reworking and established supply lines all translated into greatly increased partisan capability, which showed in the increased instances of sabotage on the railroads, with hundreds of engines and thousands of cars destroyed by the end of the year.\n\nIn 1942 terror campaigns against the territorial administration staffed by local \"collaborators and traitors\" received extra emphasis. This resulted, however, in definite divisions within the local civilian population, resulting in the beginning of the organisation of anti-partisan units with native personnel in 1942. By November 1942, Soviet partisan units in Belarus numbered about 47,000 persons.\n\nIn January 1943, out of 56,000 partisan personnel, 11,000 operated in western Belarus, 3.5 fewer per 10,000 local people than in the east, and even more so (up to a factor of 5 to 6) if one accounts for much more efficient Soviet evacuation measures in the east during 1941. Smallholders in the west showed \"surprising\" sympathies to the partisans.\n\nThere is strong evidence that the central Soviet authorities deliberately refrained from a larger accumulation of partisan forces in western Belarus and let Polish underground military structures grow in these lands during 1941-1942 in order to strengthen Moscow's relations with the Polish government-in-exile of Władysław Sikorski. A certain level of military cooperation, imposed by the command headquarters, was noted between Soviet partisans and the Polish Home Army, \"Armia Krajowa\" (AK). Soviet partisans avoided to some extent attacking people of Polish nationality during the terror campaigns in 1942. After the breakdown of diplomatic relations between the USSR and the Polish government-in-exile in April 1943 resulting from the discovery of the Katyn massacre (which the Katyn Commission of April-May 1943 attributed to the Soviets), the situation changed radically. From this moment on, Moscow treated the AK as a hostile military force.\n\nThe buildup of the Soviet partisan force in western Belarus was ordered and implemented during 1943, with nine brigades, 10 detachments and 15 operational groups transferred from east to west, effectively tripling the partisan force there (reaching 36,000 troops in December 1943). It is estimated that 10–12,000 personnel were transferred, and about same number came from local volunteers. The buildup of the military force was complemented by the intensification of the underground Communist Party structures and propaganda activity.\n\nThe Soviet victory at Stalingrad, a certain lessening of the terror campaign (\"de facto\" from December 1942, formally permitted in February 1943) and an amnesty promised to collaborators who wished to return to the Soviet camp were significant factors in the 1943 growth of Soviet partisan forces. Desertions from the ranks of the German-controlled police and military formations strengthened units, with sometimes whole detachments coming over to the Soviet camp, including the Volga Tatar battalion (900 personnel, February 1943), and Gil-Rodionov's 1st Russian People's Brigade of the SS (2,500 personnel, August 1943). In all, about 7,000 people of different anti-Soviet formations joined the Soviet partisan force, while about 1,900 specialists and commanders were dropped into occupied Belarus in 1943. However, local people mainly accounted for most increases in the Soviet partisan force.\n\nThe first year of the war was devastating for the Soviet partisans of Ukraine. Nevertheless, between August 1941 and the beginning of March 1942, 30,000 partisans had been organised into more than 1,800 detachments; by the beginning of May 1942, there were just 37 detachments, consisting of 1,918 individuals, that were operational and communicating with the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1942-1943, Putivl’ partisan detachment led by Sydir Kovpak they carried out a raid from the Briansk forests to eastern Ukraine through Pinsk, Volyn’, Rovno, Zhitomir, and Kiev oblasts. In 1943, they carried out operations in the Carpathians. Kovpak's Sumy partisan unit covered a distance of more than 10,000 kilometers in fighting at the rear of German troops and destroyed garrisons in 39 populated areas. Kovpak's operations played an important role in the development of the partisan movement against German occupying forces. This precipitous growth in the strength and activity level of partisan units prompted members of the German General Staff to suggest that Hitler consider the use of poison gas as a possible remedy to deal with the growing partisan menace.\n\nPartisans in regions of Ukraine assisted the Soviet Army in battles in Kiev, where the first partisan regiment under the command of E.K. Chekhov, was formed by forces from the NKVD, local Communist Party and Komsomol. Partisans in Dnipropetrovsk province provided significant assistance to troops on the southern and southwestern fronts, who helped restrain the German offensive in the Donbass in October–November 1941. Partisan detachments operating in the Novomoskovsk region under the command of P. Zuchenko raided a prisoner of war camp where Soviets were held, and having defeated the guards of the camp, released 300 prisoners.\n\nThe partisan struggle was noteworthy in Odessa province, with partisan forces led by V.Molodtsov-Badaev. Occupation forces testified that, \"During the two years of occupation, carried out mainly by Romanians, the city turned into a fortress of the partisan movement. Withdrawing from Odessa in the autumn of 1941, the Russians created a reliable partisan core in the city. The partisans settled in catacombs, the extensive network of which at 100 kilometers had no equal in Europe. It was a real underground fortress with staffs, shelters, logistical facilities of all kinds, right up to its own bakery and printing house, in which leaflets were printed.\" \n\nAccording to historian Alexander Gogun the partisans overstated their effectiveness in their reports. These inflated figures were passed back up the chain of command to Stalin, even finding their way into Soviet history books. Gogun says that the primary partisan targets in 1941–42 were not the German invaders but rather the local police, who were under German direction, and civilian collaborators. Gogun argues that the years 1943–44 were the peak of partisan activity within the territory of present-day Ukraine, as the Soviets battled the far-right, nationalistic OUN and the UPA, both of whom collaborated with the Nazis. According to Gogun reprisal measures for attacks on Soviet partisans or support for Ukrainian nationalists included burning down villages and executions. Gogun cites sources stating that whole families were killed, and children, even babies, were sometimes bayoneted or burned alive.\n\nIn the Bryansk region, Soviet partisans controlled large areas behind the German lines. In the summer of 1942 they effectively held more than 14,000 square kilometers (5,405 square miles) with a population of over 200,000 people. Soviet partisans in the region were led by Oleksiy Fedorov, Alexander Saburov and others and numbered over 60,000 men. The Belgorod, Oryol, Kursk, Novgorod, Leningrad, Pskov and Smolensk regions also had significant partisan activity during the occupation period. In the Oryol and Smolensk regions partisans were led by Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nTerritories liberated or under partisan authority were important during the war. There were major partisan areas and zones in Leningrad, Kalinin, Smolensk, and Orel oblasts. In Kalinin Oblast, for example, the partisans held 7,000 km. Partisan zones and areas made it difficult for the German-led occupation forces to carry out re-groupings and pinned down a considerable portion of their forces. During offensives by Soviet troops, German-led forces were often unable to organize strong defenses in the partisan zones. As a result, the German forces was forced to group forces only along the roads. Partisan areas were frequently used by regular Soviet troops to reach the flanks and rear of German groupings rapidly, to drop (land) airborne forces, and to disrupt organized enemy withdrawal.\n\nThe partisan and underground struggle in the German-occupied territories influenced the reduction of morale and combat effectiveness of the German-led armed forces and contributed to Soviet Army victories. There was a collapse of German military and political leadership in the occupied Soviet territories that deprived German forces of raw materials, food, and labor. The political work of the partisans and underground forces was a powerful force in the struggle against occupation. According to the commander of garrisons belonging to German Army Group Center, the partisan movement was combined with \"efficient and skillful propaganda, which calls on people of the occupied areas to fight against invaders.\" This led to more reluctance to collaborate with German occupation forces.\n\nAccording to the memoirs of Marshal G.K. Zhukov, the partisan fighters operating in Smolensk and Orel districts contributed significantly to Soviet Army victories in the summer of 1943 in Kursk and Orel. Further, as in the case of the earlier Soviet victories at Moscow and Stalingrad, the Kursk victory too stimulated strong new growth of the partisan movement overall\n\nBecause of the aggressive partisan attacks on rail communications, German Army Group North was forced to use truck transport to move reinforcements to the crucial sectors of the front where combat raged. German occupation leader Ziemke discussed the intensity of partisan fighting in northwestern Russia, stating: \"Meanwhile the partisans had so thoroughly disrupted the railroads that the other two reserve divisions had to be routed to Pskov, 130 miles north of Nevel, and there loaded in trucks, not enough of which were available. On 9 October Kuchler decided to wait until the reinforcements were assembled before trying again to close the gap.\"\n\nAccording to German estimates, in August 1941, 10 percent of the Nazi rear area was full of Soviet partisans. By October 1942 this figure had risen to 75 percent, and by the autumn of the same year, fully 10 per cent of all German field divisions in Russia were engaged in fighting with partisans.\n\nIn 1943, after the Red Army started to liberate western Russia and north-east Ukraine, many partisans, including units led by Fedorov, Medvedev and Saburov, were ordered to re-locate their operations into central and western Ukraine still occupied by Nazis. Partisans of the Leningrad and Kalinin (Pskov and Novgorod) regions operated against German forces for as many as three years before liberation by the Red Army.\n\nThere was a large scale sign up by women to participate. S.V. Grishin led in Smolensk the partisan brigade \"Thirteen\" which had an all female reconnaissance including Evdokiya Karpechkina. Due to lack of respect by men towards women, a rejection was made by nina when a platoon made out of men was proposed to be put under the leadership of Nina Zevrova in Leningrad.\n\nWhile Soviet sources claim that thousands of partisans were operating in the Baltic region, they only operated in the Latgale region of Latvia and the Vilnius district. Thus Estonia remained partisan free throughout most of the war. By 1944 only 234 partisans were fighting in Estonia and none were native volunteers, all being either NKVD or Red Army personnel parachuted in from the Soviet-controlled territories. A very small pro-Soviet underground, however, did exist. In Latvia, the partisans were first under Russian and Belarusian command, and from January 1943, directly subordinated to the central Headquarters in Moscow, under the leadership of Arturs Sproģis.\n\nPartisan groups in the Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia made a significant contribution to the Soviet victory. According to Alexander Chapenko, history professor at Murmansk State University: The most numerous partisan movement was in Latvia. There were large partisan units of Vilis Samsons, which carried out large military activities. In Lithuania, there were two underground forces - these are quite large subdivisions - and by mid-1944, about 220 underground Communist organizations were operating. By the end of the war, there were 2 partisan brigades and 11 detachments. Two brigades took part in the liberation of Vilnius and provided assistance to Soviet troops.\n\nIn 1941, the Soviet partisan movement in Lithuania began with the actions of a small number of Red Army soldiers left behind enemy lines, much like the beginning of partisan movements in Ukraine and Belarus. The movement grew throughout 1942, and in the summer of that year the Lithuanian Soviet partisan movement began receiving material aid as well as specialists and instructors in guerrilla warfare from Soviet-held territory. On 26 November 1942, the Command of the Lithuanian Partisan Movement (Lietuvos partizaninio judėjimo štabas) was created in Moscow, headed by the First Secretary of the Lithuanian Communist Party Antanas Sniečkus, who fled to Moscow in the wake of the German invasion in 1941. Although the Soviet partisans in Lithuania were nominally under the control of the Command of the Lithuanian Partisan Movement, the guerrilla warfare specialists and instructors sent by it reported directly to the Central Command of the Partisan Movement. Modern Lithuanian historians estimate that about half of the Soviet partisans in Lithuania were escapees from POW and concentration camps, Soviet activists and Red Army soldiers left behind the quickly advancing front line, while the other half was made up of airdropped special operations experts. It is estimated that in total, about 5,000 people engaged in pro-Soviet underground activities in Lithuania during the war. In general, the role of Soviet dissident groups in Lithuania in Second World War was minimal.\n\nDuring the Finnish occupation of Eastern Karelia, many ethnic Russians and some Karelians supported the partisan attacks. Approximately 5,000 partisans altogether fought in the region, although the typical strength of the force was 1,500–2,300. Peculiarities of this front were that partisan units were not created inside occupied territory. Their personnel came from all over the Soviet Union and that they mainly operated from the Soviet side of the front line.\n\nPartisans distributed propaganda newspapers, \"Pravda\" in the Finnish language and \"Lenin's Banner\" in the Russian language. One of the more notable leaders of the partisan movement in Finland and Karelia was the future leader of the USSR, Yuri Andropov.\n\nIn East Karelia, most partisans attacked Finnish military supply and communication targets, but inside Finland proper, and Finnish sources claim that almost two-thirds of the attacks targeted civilians, killing 200 and injuring 50, mostly women, children and elderly. Finnish sources claim that on one occasion in the small village the partisans murdered all civilians, leaving no witnesses to the atrocities. According to Russian historians, Finnish historians and especially the mass media have politicized the issue of relations between Soviet partisans and Finnish civilians. In particular, Finnish historians characterize actions of a sabotage group against a group of Finnish border guards in the village of Kuoska in eastern Lapland as an attack on civilians.\n\nRussian views however differ, as according to Sergey Verigin, Director of the Institute of History in Petrozavodsk University, the allegation that partisans killed civilians in Finland is \"an absolutely unreasonable point of view. It is contrary to international law and all documents and treaties concluded after the Second World War. The hype began during perestroika. There were publications about the death of peaceful Finnish civilians at the hands of partisans. The topic has been politicized. On Finnish territory, partisans entered villages searching for food. They had no goal of specifically destroying civilians. But it's clear that there were some conflicts. And the population of the border areas had weapons i.e. it had ceased to be peaceful.\"\n\nPartisan operations against Finns were estimated as being highly ineffectual. The partisans did not have sufficient strength to attack military targets, and would often falsely report their raids to higher command, claiming attacks on German or Finnish military targets even if the victims were civilians. Already in the autumn of 1941 the report of Komissariat of Interior Affairs was highly critical, and it became only worse, as stated in the counter-intelligence agency's report of April 1944. The main explanations given for the operations' failures were the isolated headquarters at Belomorsk, which did not know what operative units were doing, personnel who had no local knowledge and were partly made up of criminals (10-20% of all personnel were conscripted from prisons) without knowledge of how to operate in harsh terrain and climate, efficient Finnish counter-partisan patrolling (more than two-thirds of the infiltrating small partisan groups were completely destroyed) and Finnish internment of the ethnic Russian civilian population in concentration camps from those regions with active partisan operations. Internees were released to secure areas, preventing partisans from receiving local supplies. In addition, many Soviet Karelians reported to the Finns the movements of the partisans and did not support the Soviet Partisans.\n\nBetween 1941 and 1944 forty groups were active behind the Axis front line in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, acting against the Romanian troops which took over the territory following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. The partisan detachments distributed propaganda and attacked local industrial and military facilities, neutralizing around 14,000 enemy soldiers and officers and capturing extensive military equipment. With a maximum strength of 3,900, its loses amounted to 600 captured and up to 850 executed.\n\nIn the former eastern territories of the Second Polish Republic, attached to the Ukrainian and Belarusian Soviet Republics after the Soviet invasion of Poland, the organization and operation of Soviet partisans were similar to that in Ukrainian and Belarusian territories. However, there were notable differences in the interaction of partisans with Polish national forces and the local population. There were also Soviet-affiliated and controlled groups, namely Gwardia Ludowa, later transformed into Armia Ludowa, which while often described as parts of the Polish resistance, were de facto controlled by Soviets, and as such can also be seen as extensions of the Soviet partisans.\n\nAfter an initial period of wary collaboration with the independent Polish resistance, the conflicts between Soviet-affiliated and independent groups intensified, especially as Poles were principally the victims of Soviet terror between 1939 and 1941, and Soviet diplomatic relations with the Polish exile government in London continued to worsen and were broken off completely by Soviet government in the aftermath of the discovery of the Katyn Massacre in 1943. As a result, Soviet partisans started extensive operations against both the Polish underground and the civilian population of the areas seized by the Soviets in 1939. The campaign of terror resulted in reports to London of horrifying looting, rape and murder. This made many local AK commanders consider the Soviets as just another enemy and eventually on June 22, 1943 Soviets partisans were ordered by Moscow to take on the Polish units as well. The study by the historian Bogdan Musial states that Soviet partisans, instead of engaging German military and police targets, targeted the poorly armed and trained Belarusian and Polish self-defense forces. Additionally, the Soviet partisans were instructed to collaborate with the Nazis by providing the German forces intelligence on Polish non-communist resistance formation.\n\nBogdan Musial states that Soviet partisans, instead of engaging German military and police targets, targeted the poorly armed and trained Belarusian and Polish self-defense forces. In addition, the Soviet partisans were instructed to collaborate with the Nazis by providing the German forces intelligence on Polish anti-Nazi resistance formation. The Soviet partisans were involved in several massacres of Polish civilians, including at Naliboki, on May 8, 1943 and at Koniuchy on 29 January 1944. Soviet partisans and Red Army Officers have also murdered members of Polish anti-Nazi resistance after inviting them to \"negotiations\" in 1943, and also denounced them to the Germans, who then killed the Poles.\n\nTo survive, resistance fighters largely relied on the civilian population. This included access to food, clothing and other supplies. Soviet partisans requisitioned food, livestock and clothes from local peasants, and when peasants did not share them willingly, they often did it by force. The results of such requisitioning were made more severe by the fact that Axis occupation forces had been already carrying out their own requisitions. This led to conflicts between Soviet partisans and local populace in areas less friendly to the Soviet Union, mostly in territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939 and the Baltic states annexed in 1940.\n\nPartisans are accused of provoking brutal countermeasures from the Nazi occupiers that targeted civilians. Trying to limit partisan activities, German command employed mass killings of hostages among the residents of areas supporting partisan forces. In the case of partisan attack or sabotage, a number of locals would be executed. Such hostage operations happened in the form of preliminary arrests, post-attack retaliation actions, and/or compulsory \"watch-groups\" deployed on vulnerable sites and killed if they did not avert the attack. In Belarus alone, according to historian Christian Gerlach, German anti-partisan actions killed an estimated 345,000 people, mostly civilians.\n\nNumerous accounts of Soviet partisan operations in former Polish territories discuss their strained relations with local peasants. Polish peasants often refused to voluntary support the Soviet partisans, which in turn lead to the Soviets forcefully acquiring supplies.\n\nChodakiewicz reported that a high ranking Soviet commander said, “Most partisan units feed, clothe, and arm themselves at the expense of the local population and not by capturing booty in the struggle against fascism. That arouses in the people a feeling of hostility, and they say, ‘The Germans take everything away and one must also give something to the partisans’.”\n\nAmong the targets of Soviet partisans were not only Axis military and their collaboration units, but also civilians accused of being collaborators or sometimes even those who were considered not to support the partisans strongly enough. In some cases, Germans allowed peasants to form self-defense units against Soviet raids, which in extreme cases led to violent clashes between the Soviet partisans and local peasants, resulting in civilian casualties, as was the case with the Koniuchy and Naliboki massacres in Polish-Lithuanian borderland in 1943-1944.\n\nIn territories that were a part of the Soviet Union before the war, their relations with the locals were much better. There, Soviet partisans often had the support of civilians and the unity of partisans and the local population had a positive effect on partisan activities. Elderly men and women and children often put themselves in mortal danger. A number of Soviet sources extol the level of cooperation between the partisans and the populace, for example, a leader of the Minsk underground Communist Party committee reported: \"The local people helped us in the search for weapons. From rivers, swamps, and forests, people located rifles, ammunition, shells, and all this was delivered to us.\" The local population provided food and clothing to partisans voluntarily. Local civilians organized into self-defense detachments, delivered food, collected weapons from past battles, and prepared lodging for partisans. Residents cared for sick and wounded fighters. Self-defense groups assisted partisans to secure areas and conduct reconnaissance. Communist Party leadership in partisan organizations was significant and had a positive influence. Commissars were responsible for ensuring discipline and supervised all partisan activities to ensure they followed guiding principles of the partisan movement. Political commissars insisted that partisan fighters enhance their ideological and political awareness and maintain close and friendly relations with the local population. In territories freed by the partisans, the partisans accumulated and trained reserves, provided care to the sick and wounded, built airfields to receive planes from the rest of the Soviet Union. Large numbers of Soviet citizens fleeing destruction from German-occupied areas were provided relief by partisans.\n\nIn Belarus, workers and employees of Minsk, Brest, Grodno, Borisov and other cities that were occupied by Germany transferred weapons to partisan detachments that were sometimes stationed far away from large settlements. Weapons were bought, exchanged, or taken directly from garrisons, warehouses and then taken secretly to the woods. In 1942 and in the first half of 1943, residents of the Ushachsky district in Vitebsk region handed over 260 tons of bread to partisans. On the eve of the Soviet offensive into Belarus, partisan intelligence reported on German plans to deport a portion of the population to Ostrovets and to shoot the rest of the citizens. On 3 July 1944, the partisans seized the town and held it for several days until they were relieved by advancing Soviet forces. Belorussian partisans alone managed to rescue 15,000 Soviet citizens from German hands and moved another 80,000 inhabitants from German-occupied territory to the Soviet rear.\n\nAccording to Alexander Statiev,\"Despite the ruthless procurement policy sanctioned at the top level and numerous abuses by commanders that aggravated this policy, most requisitions in these regions still had a benign outcome: civilians perceived the loss of some of their assets to partisans as a fair price for the temporary absence of Germans and the eventual victory. However, most people in the borderlands, incorporated by the Soviet Union in 1939–1940, resented the Soviet regime and its representatives, the partisans.\"\n\nAt the same time, when pressed for supplies, partisans also engaged in significant amount of plunder: \nParticularly in Crimea, the Soviet partisans relation with local populace, Crimean Tatars, was very bad. Having failed to properly provision the troops before the area was overrun by the Germans, partisans launched \"in the words of the Crimean Provincial Party Committee, ‘violent confiscations of food in Tatar villages without distinguishing friends from foes'\". This resulted in violent conflict between mostly Slavic partisans and local Tatars, encouraged by the Germans who allowed Tatar villages to raise self-defence militia. Being unable to obtain supplies, the Soviet partisans suffered major casualties, and the partisan resistance in the Crimea nearly vanished by the summer of 1942.\n\nVasily Korzh raid, Autumn 1941-March 23, 1942. raid of a partisan formation in the Minsk and Pinsk Oblasts of Belarus.\n\nFrom the very beginning of its existence, the partisan intelligence had been aimed chiefly at serving the Red Army operational purposes. It had frequently been asked to provide detailed information on enemy's whereabouts, strengths, armaments, movements and intentions. Yet, the partisans’ ability to meet the expectations of military consumers was limited. In 1941-1942, they relied chiefly on field intelligence – foot patrols, observation and questioning of local population – and only from late 1942 onwards succeeded in developing human intelligence capabilities. Unfortunately, the majority of their agents and collaborators were illiterate farmers and laborers unprepared for intelligence work. Technological means of collection such as communications interceptors and night vision devices were used by the partisans only on rare occasions. Besides, the wide scale deployment and high efficiency of the German security services limited the partisans’ gathering capabilities in the military field to the rural areas, almost completely preventing their access to the Wehrmacht's bases and decision making centers.\n\nPartisan intelligence's contribution to the political leadership of the Soviet Union and its intelligence community appears to have been more significant, especially in collecting information on conditions in the occupied territories, as well as on the structure of the occupation administration, its everyday behavior, local collaborators and sympathizers. This contribution allowed the Soviet regime to maintain its authority and control behind the German lines and reinforced its anti-Nazi propaganda effort in the occupied territories and in the West. The Soviet intelligence and security services used the information obtained by the partisans for improving their operational capabilities in the German-controlled territories and preparing the measures for reoccupation of Eastern Poland and the Baltic States.\n\nThe partisan propaganda means had developed over the occupation period. In its early stage, the partisan messages were mainly short and unsophisticated and used simple spreading channels, such as verbal communication and leaflets. Consequently, some of the big-sized and mighty partisan detachments succeeded in establishing their own print houses that published periodic ‘partisan newspapers’ based on the propaganda broadcasts from Moscow and local reality.\n\nThe effect of the partisan psychological warfare is hard to evaluate. Nevertheless, it appears that at least a part of the defections from the Wehrmacht and other Axis troops, that occurred on the Eastern front in 1942-1944, might be attributed to the partisan propaganda effort, as well as the relatively high number of the local volunteers to the Soviet guerrilla detachments starting from the summer of 1943. Furthermore, in many occupied areas the very presence of anti-German irregulars emphasized the continued presence of ‘Kremlin’s watchful eye’, unnerved occupying forces and their collaborators and thus undermined the enemy's attempt to ‘pacify’ the local populace.\n\nA significant number of Soviet citizens were outside Soviet borders during the war and many took part in numerous partisan formations and saboteur groups in France, Poland, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and other countries. More than 40,000 Soviet citizens joined partisan formations in these countries. For example, about 25,000 Soviet partisans fought in Poland and Czechoslovakia. Some of these perished in the resistance and have become national heroes in the countries they fought in, including M. Gusein-Zade in Yugoslavia, F. Poletaev in Italy, and V. Porik in France. More than 12,000 Soviet partisans operated in Poland alone, the most notable of which were P. Vershigora's 1st Ukrainian Partisan division and other partisan brigades and units commanded by I. Banov, V. Karasev, G. Kovalev, S. Sankov, and several others. Many of these partisans, together with 600,000 Red Army soldiers, died on Polish soil.\n\nAble-bodied male Jews were usually welcomed by the partisans (sometimes only if they brought their own weapons). More than 10% of the Soviet partisan movement were Jews. However, Jewish women, children, and the elderly were usually not welcome. Often, however, separate Jewish groups, both guerrilla units and mixed family groups of refugees (like the Bielski partisans), were subordinated to the communist partisan leadership and considered as Soviet allies.\n\nThe Soviet Ukrainian partisans achieved some success only in Slovakia, a nominally independent country under German tutelage. The Slovakian countryside and mountains became a ‘hotbed’ for the Soviet guerrillas in the second half of 1944. Dozens of the partisan detachments that came from Soviet Ukraine and formerly Soviet-occupied Poland conducted sabotage acts against German communication lines, harassed the local German community and finally took an active part in the Slovak National Uprising launched by the Slovak resistance movement on 29 August 1944. The insurgents established their headquarters in the central-Slovakian town Banská Bystrica, conducted contacts with the Allied powers, managed to hold out for two months against the German and the Slovak collaborationist troops, and even dispatched sabotage and intelligence units to Hungary and Moravia.\n\nHowever, due to the Red Army's inability or possibly unwillingness to support the rebels, many of whom were loyal to the London-based Czechoslovak government-in-exile, the Slovak National Uprising was brutally suppressed in late October 1944. The attempt of the Soviet Ukrainian partisans to continue the guerrilla war in the Carpathian Mountains during the winter of 1944-1945 had little effect on the Germans but led to severe losses among the partisans. Most returned to the Soviet-controlled territory without being able to assist the Red Army war effort. Nonetheless, the remnants of the Soviet Ukrainian partisan networks remained active in Slovakia and Moravia, mostly in the intelligence field, until early May. \n\nIn addition to fighting the Nazis, Soviet partisans fought against organizations which sought to establish independent non-communist states of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus and Ukraine. Most of the resistance groups in the Baltic States and Poland sought to re-establish independent states free of Soviet domination.\n\nSoviet partisans are therefore a controversial issue in those countries. In Latvia, former Soviet partisan Vasiliy Kononov was prosecuted and convicted for war crimes against locals. The conviction was ultimately upheld by European Court of Human Rights.\n\nIn the early years of the war, following German invasion of the Soviet Union, many Polish and Soviet partisans saw Germans as the common enemy, and hostility between the two groups was limited. However, by mid-1943, as the Soviets gained the upper hand and started to push German forces westwards, and following the breakdown of diplomatic relationship between Polish government in exile and the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the revelations about the Katyn massacre on June 22, 1943, Soviet partisans received orders to engage non-communist Polish partisans of Armia Krajowa, and the hostilities between the two groups escalated. On numerous occasions in the years 1943-1944, The Soviets would invite Polish partisans to talks, then disarm them and some times execute The Polish partisan leaders.\n\nThe Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) formed in 1942 as a military arm of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists engaged in armed conflicts with Soviet partisans and the Polish resistance. While the UPA initially attempted to find a common anti-Soviet ground with Nazi Germany against the USSR, it soon was driven underground as it became apparent that the Germans' intentions for Ukraine were to establish a German colony with a subjugated local population, not an independent country as the UPA hoped for. As such, the UPA was driven underground and fought both the Nazi occupiers and the Soviet forces (including partisans) at the same time.\n\nLater, the UPA and Soviet partisan leaders tried to negotiate a temporary alliance, but Moscow's NKVD Headquarters began harshly suppressing such moves by its local commanders. With both sides becoming established enemies, the Ukrainian civil population was primarily concerned with their survival.\n\nSoviet partisan relations with the population of the Baltic countries were complex. The Soviet government annexed these territories in June 1940 and faced increasing resistance after repressive actions against the Baltic populations. The German offensive in the Baltic was swift and effectively defeated the Soviet forces stationed there. But over time, the number of Soviet underground workers increased. Their ranks, as in the other occupied territories, grew at the expense of the NKVD sabotage groups that were being abandoned, escaped prisoners of war. The local population also became increasingly dissatisfied with Nazi Germany.\n\nSoviet forces focused on communicating with the local population. In August 1941, regular radio programs began in Latvian from Moscow. The newspaper \"For Soviet Latvia” began to be published.\n\nAccording to the Daugavpils Regional Commissioner in his report of 20 May 1942:“The activities of the partisans in the Latgale region are rampant. There are daily reports that clashes with guerrilla groups occur in different places, which are partially parachuted or crossed the border or consist of prisoners of war who escaped from camps and armed by local residents. The number of fleeing increases every day. The guerrillas do not seek more shelter from the population, but organize their bases in impassable forests and wetlands, from where they are attacking settlements.\"In November and December 1943, punitive expeditions were organized against Oshkaln partisans, and police from Riga province were mobilized. Partisans maneuvred and retreated to the Zalveskie forests (40 km west of Jekabpils). Due to the support of the local population, the Oshkaln partisans withstood difficulties of the winter of 1943/44.\n\nLatvian headquarters of the partisan movement reported that in the summer of 1944, partisans of eastern and central Latvia directly rescued more than 3,220 from being transferred to western Latvia, and also 278 Soviet soldiers were liberated from captivity, and they immediately joined partisan detachments. In the woodlands in the north-east of Latvia, about 1,500 families of civilians were hiding under the direct protection of the detachments of the 1st Partisan brigade.\n\nTheir involvement in actions that affected the civilian population (for example, the killing of the Polish civilians in Kaniūkai and the destruction of the village of Bakaloriškės). The anti-Soviet resistance movements in the Baltic states, known as the [[Latvian national partisans|Latvian]] or [[Lithuanian partisans]], (established before the Soviet re-occupation in 1944), and [[Local Self-Defence in Lithuania during the Nazi German occupation (1941–1944)|local self-defence]] units often came into conflict with Soviet partisan groups. In Estonia and Latvia, almost all the Soviet partisan units, dropped by air, were either destroyed by the German forces or the local self-defense units.\n\nIn eastern and south-eastern Lithuania, Soviet partisans constantly clashed with Polish [[Armia Krajowa]] (\"Home Army\") partisans; AK did not recognise any territorial changes after 1939 and considered this region as a legal part of Poland, while the Soviets planned to annex it into the Soviet Union after the war. Only in April 1944 did Polish and Soviet partisans start coordinating their actions against the Germans.\n\nSome historians assert that the Soviet reactions to returning partisans were not better than for Soviet POWs. However most of the partisans were included in soviet regular forces. A lot of former POWs avoided repressions because of joining the partisan units after the escape. In 1955, a pardon was given to all returned prisoners of war and Nazi collaborators.\n\nWith the German supply lines already over-extended, the partisan operations in the rear of the front lines were able to severely disrupt the flow of supplies to the army that acted deep into the Soviet territory. In the second half of the war, major partisan operations were coordinated with Soviet offensives. Upon liberation of parts of the Soviet territory, the corresponding partisan detachments usually joined the regular Army. According to Soviet sources, the partisans were a vital force of the war. From 90,000 men and women by the end of 1941 (including underground) they grew to 220,000 in 1942, and to more than 550,000 in 1943.\n\nThe Soviet partisan activities was a strategic factor in the defeat of the German forces on the Soviet-German front. During the summer and autumn of 1942, when partisan warfare did not reach its highest peak, the German Army devoted about 10 percent of its overall strength in fighting partisans, including 15 regular and security divisions and 144 security and police battalions. At the same time, the total strength of German and Italian forces in North Africa was 12 divisions. The partisans made significant contributions to the war effort by interrupting German plans to exploit Soviet territories economically. German forces obtained only one-seventh of what they looted from other European countries. While about $1 billion worth of food and other products were expropriated from Soviet territories by the Germans, more than $26 billion worth of goods and services were extracted from other European countries.\n\nThe partisans rendered substantial help to Soviet Army forces operating at the front by conducting damaging strikes against the German rear area communication network. Partisan activities combined with the Soviet Army's increasing offensive success helped to inspire the local population in occupied territories to join or support the struggle against the German occupation. According to historian Leonid Grenkevich, This partisan warfare on so vast a scale was unprecedented in Russian history. In the end it was a genuine people’s war. In general, the populace supported the partisan fighters by providing them not only moral support, and care and attention, but also food and masses of intelligence information.\n\nAccording to historian Geoffrey Hosking, \"All in all, the Soviet peoples displayed between 1941 and 1945 endurance, resourcefulness and determination which may be well beyond the capacities of economically more advanced nations. They won the war partly because of, partly in spite of, their leaders . . . The war showed the Soviet system at its best and at its worst.\"\n\nHistorian Matthew Cooper argued that, \"The guerrilla was not simply a man fighting for his country; he was a political being struggling for a powerful and pervasive cause, against his own race as well as against the enemy. Militarily, he was to assist the progress of the Red Army by creating unbearable conditions in the enemy’s rear; politically he was to be the champion of the class struggle in the furtherance of the Communist millennium. The Soviet partisans were representatives of the Soviet regime and evidence that neither it nor ideology was defeated.\"\n\nThe partisan movement succeeded in accomplishing its ideological tasks. US Air Force historians N. F. Parrish, L. B. Atkinson, and A. F. Simpson remarked, \"Aside from direct or indirect damage to the German war machine, the Moscow-controlled partisan movement was the sole effective means by which the Soviet government could maintain a measure of control of, and extract varying degrees of loyalty from, the Soviet populations behind the German lines.\" The historian J. Armstrong also highly praised Soviet partisans ’efforts in this field, stating, \"The great accomplishment of the partisans in the psychological field was their major contribution in turning the population of the occupied territories against the Germans.\"\n\nPolish historian [[Marek Jan Chodakiewicz]]: alleges that the \"Soviet-allied guerrillas routinely engaged in plundering peasants. He argues that they \"lacked popular support\" and claims that such allegations have been \"eliminated from the standard Soviet narrative about them\". The book \"Soviet partisans in 1941-1944\" by Polish author [[Bogdan Musiał|Bogdan Musial]] was criticized by Belarusian media for denigrating the partisan movement.\n\n\n\n[[Category:Soviet partisans| ]]\n[[Category:National liberation armies]]\n[[Category:World War II resistance movements]]"}

Jatti\n\nBasappa Danappa Jatti (10 September 1912 – 7 June 2002) was the fifth Vice President of India, serving from 1974 to 1979. He was Acting President of India from 11 February to 25 July 1977. The soft-spoken Jatti rose from a humble beginning as a Municipality member to India's second-highest office during a five-decade-long chequered political career.\n\nBasappa Danappa Jatti was born in Bagalkot district of Karnataka on 10 September 1913. His father was a humble grocer. He braved family difficulties and completed his education. After completing his graduation in Law from Rajaram Law College in Kolhapur, then affiliated with the University of Bombay, B.D.Jatti did his legal practice as an advocate for a very short span of time in his home town Jamkhandi. \n\nIn 1940, he entered politics as a Municipality member at Jamkhandi and subsequently became the President of the Jamkhandi Town Municipality in 1945. Later, he was elected as a member of the Jamkhandi State Legislature and was appointed a minister in the government of the princely state of Jamkhandi. Finally he became the 'dewan' (Chief Minister) of Jamkhandi state in 1948. As dewan, he maintained cordial relations with the Maharaja, Shankar Rao Patwardhan, and brought about the accession of the small principality to the Indian Union. On 8 March 1948 after Jamkhandi was merged with Bombay state, he returned to legal practice and continued with it for 20 months.\n\nLater, Jatti was nominated as member of the Bombay State Legislative Assembly to represent the merged area and within a week of his nomination, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the then Bombay Chief Minister, B. G. Kher. He worked in that capacity for a couple of years. After the 1952 general elections, he was appointed Minister of Health and Labour of the then Bombay Government and held that post till the reorganisation of states.His autobiography, 'I'm my own model', is very popular \n\nJatti became a member of the Mysore Legislative Assembly after the reorganisation and was Chairman of the Land Reforms Committee, which paved the way for the 1961 Mysore Land Reforms Act (which abolished the tenancy system and absentee landlordism). He was the Chief Minister and Kadidal Manjappa was the Revenue Minister when the Bill was adopted. In 1958, when S.Nijalingappa stepped down as Chief Minister of the state, Jatti was elected leader of the party in the face of a stiff challenge from Congress veteran T. Subramanya. He became the Chief Minister of Mysore in 1958 and continued in that office until 1962.\n\nRe-elected from Jamkhandi constituency in the third general elections, Jatti was appointed Finance Minister on 2 July 1962 in the S. Nijalingappa Ministry. He was re-elected to the fourth Assembly from the same constituency and appointed as Minister of Food and Civil Supplies.\n\nJatti subsequently moved onto the national scene and was appointed as the Lieutenant Governor of Pondicherry in 1968. He became the Governor of Odisha in 1972 and, in 1974, assumed office as the fifth Vice-President of India. He became acting President for a brief period after the death of Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed in 1977.\n\nHowever, his acting presidency was not without controversy. In April 1977, when Union Home Minister Charan Singh took the debatable decision to dissolve the assemblies of nine states, Jatti declined to sign the order and broke the tradition of the President accepting the advice of the Cabinet. Though he later signed the order, Jatti took the stand that the Centre's action should not only be politically and constitutionally correct but also appear to be proper. After leaving office as Vice-President in 1979, Jatti continued to be in the limelight as a keen observer of the political situation in the country.\n\n\nA deeply religious man, Jatti was the founder president of the \"Basava Samithi\", a religious organisation which propagated the preachings of 12th-century saint, philosopher and reformer of Lingayat religion Basaveshwara. The Basava samithi established in 1964 has published many books on Lingayatism and Sharanas and has got the 'vachanas' of sharanas translated into various languages. He was also involved in various organisations concerned with social activities.\n\nHe died on 7 June 2002. He was hailed as a man who set an example of selfless service and stood for value-based politics. He was once called an ordinary man with extraordinary thought, and he named his autobiography, \"I'm My Own Model\". His centenary celebrations were held in 2012.\n\n"}
{"id": "1994475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994475", "title": "Certis Group", "text": "Certis Group\n\nCertis, formerly Certis CISCO Security Private Limited and CISCO Security Private Limited, is one of the five commercial Auxiliary Police forces authorized to provide armed security officers to government organizations as well as private companies or individuals in Singapore. Certis originated from the Guard and Escort unit of the Singapore Police Force (SPF), which was separated from the SPF as the Commercial and Industrial Security Corporation (CISCO) in 1972 as a statutory board with a monopoly over most areas of the local private armed security industry.\n\nFrom 1 June 2005, the statutory board was dissolved and Cisco Security Pte Ltd was formed upon its corporatisation as a fully owned subsidiary of Temasek Holdings, and inaugurated on 5 July 2005. The abbreviation of the former statutory board, \"CISCO\", was retained due to its reputation in the local market. The company was renamed as Certis CISCO Security Pte Ltd on 13 September 2007 and as Certis Group in 2018. Cisco Annual Security Report on 20 January 2016 reveals a decline in defender confidence and the increased impact of industrialised attackers.\n\nAs the oldest Auxiliary Police Force with a monopoly over most of the private armed security sector in Singapore for 33 years, CISCO maintains a visible presence in many key establishments, including the private residences of VVIPs. They were deployed in major events such as the Singapore 2006 IMF Meetings, the New Year Countdown at Marina Bay in 2007 and 2008, the Chingay Parade and the Thaipusam processions. They also continue to dominate some services such as the transportation of valuables, most visibly in the form of delivering cash to automated teller machines.\n\nCISCO came into being in 1972 in the wake of a police employment scheme review by a committee led by Professor Lee Soo Ann a year earlier. It recommended that the Singapore Police Force's Guard and Escort Unit, itself formed in 1958, be hived off as a statutory board of the Government of Singapore, in a bid to relieve manpower constraints on the SPF by empowering the new statutory board with the ability to conduct its own recruitment schemes tailored specifically for armed security services. The company was established under the Commercial and Industrial Security Corporation Act.\n\nAt its dissolution, the Guard and Escort Unit had a strength of 1,600 police officers, who received the same training as their counterparts in police divisions, and are mostly deployed as guards in commercial banks. The new statutory board absorbed most of these regular officers, although the committee recommended the early retirement of 460 older officers, with an enhanced pension scheme offered to them as compensation. A recruitment drive was also initiated on 1 April to recruit other police officers and boost its strength to 2,000.\n\nCISCO, as a separate statutory board, became Singapore's only commercial entity offering armed security services. Its policemen continue to receive training via a 7-week residential training course at the CISCO Police Training School, which is adjacent to the Police Academy at Thomson Road, with training assistance from the Academy. Over time, the course was streamlined to fit their specific operation needs, and instruction was gradually taken over by fellow CISCO officers. CISCO police officers were dressed largely similar to their counterparts in the Singapore Police Force, and CISCO vehicles were also largely similar, except with the addition of a CISCO logo. CISCO officers were paid a salary of about S$650 in the 1970s.\n\nIn the next decades, the company diversified its operations beyond the provisioning of armed guards, providing a range of security-related services, including enforcement, management, and consultancy services for not just physical, but also data and IT-related needs. In 1991, the board's new chief executive, Chan Boon Kiong initiated wide-ranging changes to turn the company round into a commercial entity with an annual turnover of S$200 million, with diversification into various aspects of security. As the company began to diversify, its traditional armed police operations were organised under the name of CISCO Auxiliary Police under the Product Division, together with the CISCO Recall Total Information Management Pte Ltd and other specialised departments. It also began to expand abroad, having first established a joint venture with Zhong-Bao Security Industry Company in China in July 1995 with a 60% stake.\n\nIn 1982, CISCO announced that the position of unarmed warden was dropped and constable was the lowest rank.\n\nCISCO officially opened its new Headquarters building at Jalan Affifi off Upper Paya Lebar Road on 20 June 1986, which then boasted some of the most modern facilities including the first computerised indoor shooting range in Singapore. On 2 March 1994, work commenced to extend the CISCO Headquarters building to incorporate facilities to process and store high-value items and a computer disaster recovery centre. The SCORE Counselling Centre was opened in the building on 5 December 1996.\n\nCISCO entered into a joint venture with Brambles Industries Ltd from Australia in May 1996 with a 51% stake to form CISCO Recall Total Information Management Pte Ltd (now Iron Mountain Recall) as part of its foray into the information management industry. On 8 June 1999, the first purpose-built CISCO Recall Centre was officially opened, which included a 43-metre high document storage facility, the tallest single-storey building in Singapore. A second CISCO Recall Centre was opened in Chin Bee Avenue on 10 September 2003, by which time the company's CISCO Recall service has 33 government agencies amongst its clients.\n\nBy 1998, the company has over 2,000 clients which has installed security systems linked to CISCO's alarm monitoring system, an increase of 25% since 1996. This included some 500 private homes which paid between S$2000 to S$1million for such systems. CISCO entered into a joint-venture with the National Library Board on 21 June 1999 to establish a digital signature certification authority service.\n\nCISCO manned the Area Licensing Scheme gantries in 1975 until the introduction of Electronic Road Pricing in September 1998, where 105 officers were redeployed. CISCO officers began to assist the Traffic Police as traffic wardens to curb illegal parking on 1 November 1999. Over 12,100 parking violation notices were subsequently issued in the next two months, prompting their implementation in more areas to allow the Traffic Police to concentrate on enforcing traffic rules on the move.\n\nDuring the height of the SARS crisis, CISCO officers were deployed to serve Home Quarantine Orders at the residents homes and install CCTVs at their homes. These were enforced by about 60 officers, who were given the power to electronically tag those who violate the order Their high-risk duty was mentioned for praise during the then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's National Day Rally Speech in 2003\n\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, CISCO reported an increase in business as a result of heightened security demands. From November 2004, CISCO officers were deployed to assist in enforcing sensitive locations such as Jurong Island. CISCO ventured into professional investigation services in 2005.\n\nIn August 2012, cash and valuables were reported missing from safe deposit boxes held by Certis CISCO in at least 8 police reports. Clients were warned not to talk to the media. This was followed by a rush of customers to check on their safe deposit boxes and annulment of contracts due to various integrity issues.\n\nOver the years, the license to provide armed security services has been extended to other companies, including the Auxiliary Police Forces operated by PSA Corporation, Changi International Airport Services, Singapore Airport Terminal Services, and Singapore Technologies Kinetics, although these officers have their policing powers restricted to their areas of operation. In the wake of rising security concerns, the government decided to introduce greater competition in the armed security service industry.\n\nAs a result of measures to create a more level playing field, the CISCO Act was dissolved in 2005, and CISCO ceased being a statutory board, corporatised as a fully government owned company, and came instead under the same legislative and regulatory guidelines as the other Auxiliary Police Forces. The new company will no longer utilise the Singapore Police Force's crest, and changes will be made to the uniforms of its police officers, in line with its counterparts in the armed security industry.\n\nTo minimise disruptions during the corporatisation process, the Ministry of Home Affairs transferred all of its former statutory board's assets, liabilities, staff and contracts to the new company, and did not give it a moratorium since the statutory board has already engaged in commercial services. The new company took over all businesses the statutory board had engaged in, and is now liberated to enter or exit from contracts based on its own commercial interests.\n\nOn 1 June 2005, the corporatisation process was completed and the new CISCO Security Private Limited formed.\n\nDue to the difficulty to recruit Malaysian and Singaporean nationals in the ranks of Certis, the company began to recruit Taiwanese nationals willing to work in Singapore in 2016.\n\nSome were deployed to work at land checkpoints alongside Singaporeans in 2018. According to reports from Radio Taiwan International, some Taiwanese nationals refuse to continue working due to the stress in their assigned job posts.\n\nOn 29 January 2019, Certis announced the establishment of a K-9 unit to protect facilities under contract.\n\nCertis has implemented a work-study scheme for any of its employees looking to study part-time while working.\n\nCertis has supported the following inititiatives:\n\n\nProspective Certis recruits were trained at the Police Academy with four weeks of residential training. Previously, most were trained at its Kallang facility, but recruits had to go to the academy to practice shooting drills. Requirements for Cisco constables were to attend residential training for three months while wardens were required to attend residential training for a month.\n\nIn 2017, Cisco opened a new shooting range facility at Jalan Afifi where its officers can practice shooting techniques.\n\nGiven its former affiliation with the Singapore Police Force, CISCO officers wore the same dark blue uniform as that of the police force when it was formed in 1972. As the sole private armed security agency, and with several sensitive roles passed on to CISCO, the uniforms were kept similar such that the general public would not be able to tell CISCO officers from regular police officers unless under close scrutiny. The primary distinguishing feature was of a black plastic name tag with a white border, as opposed to the plain all-black name tags worn by the police regulars.\n\nAs a result of several uniform reviews both by CISCO and the police in subsequent decades, however, it became easier to distinguish CISCO officers. The blue beret and long-sleeved shirts, phased out in favour of the peaked cap and short-sleeved shirts for most normal police officers, was still retained in the CISCO uniform. Similarly, CISCO retained the old metallic cap badges and collar lapels although they were replaced with embroidered versions in the SPF.\n\nWhen CISCO was corporatised as CISCO Security on 1 June 2005, officers continued to don the old uniforms pending a review of their uniforms. Under governmental direction, the uniform was modified to inject distinguishing features between them and that of those worn by officers of the SPF to foster a more level playing field with other Auxiliary Police Forces in Singapore. From 15 June 2005, all 3,200 uniformed CISCO personal switched to the new uniforms.\n\nThe new uniforms saw the adoption of a new corporate colour, steel blue, and the material was changed from pure polyester to poly viscose. New buttons and badges on the cap and collars incorporating CISCO's logo were used in place of similar logos to the regular police force. The leather belt was changed from black to brown, as is a band around the peak cap. There is also a horizontal cutting across the chest from one pocket to the other.\n\nWhile the new uniform was implemented across the company, some officers tasked to perform specific roles were exempt from the change, in particular those involving provision of security for sensitive locations or personnel, such as the Istana, the Supreme Court building and the private residences of VVIPs. Close resemblance of the old CISCO uniform with that of the regular police has allowed the latter to outsource sensitive roles, yet providing a visual impression of continued police presence. This practice was thus continued at sensitive locations despite the introduction of the new uniforms.\n\nAs of 2019, CG uniforms are outsourced to a local Singaporean clothing company Chin Bee Pte Ltd.\n\n\nSince its inception, CISCO officers have been involved in a number of incidents. Several CISCO constables and Lance Corporals have been shot and killed while on duty, and others injured. Several officers has also been involved in some high-profile incidents, such as a gun-snatching incident and an attempted bank robbery by a CISCO officer in Bukit Timah. One Lance Corporal prevented a robbery by firing two rounds at a robber.\n\nThere have also been multiple complaints linked to Certis CISCO officers for unprofessional conduct in performing their duties. In one recent incident, a complaint was issued against an officer for his lack of sensitivity and flexibility while on duty at the Singapore General Hospital. There have been numerous allegations of Certis CISCO officers using high-handed tactics while performing their duties e.g. indiscriminate issue of fines.\n\nThere were many cases of officers running foul of the law. From July 1999, CISCO implemented measures to curb corruption amongst its officers in the midst of several publicised cases of corruption involving CISCO Officers.\n\n\nAs an armed organisation, there have been cases of CISCO officers committing or attempting to commit suicide with their service revolvers, although few cases were actually attributed to work-related issues.\n\n\n"}

The series was written by Adam Warren, who also provided layouts, and pencilled by Rick Mays.\n\nThe series stars a group of fictional androids who are members of a covert black ops program code named Project Livewire. These androids are on a mission to seek out and destroy other black ops.\n\n\nProject Livewire was founded by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a means of testing the next generation of S.H.I.E.L.D. androids. These androids are based on the long-standing S.H.I.E.L.D. android, the Life Model Decoys (LMDs), and the LMD successors, the Mannites. The androids of Project Livewire combine the super-human abilities of the Mannites with the human appearance of the LMDs. Most of the work for Project Livewire was done by David Jenkins, the assistant chief designer of the project.\n\nIn total, ten androids were created for Project Livewire. By the beginning of the limited series, there were only five left functioning.\n\nThe series opens in the middle of a mission with Stem Cell's activation as a replacement for Homebrew. The team has located one of their targets at a facility operated by a company named Thermogentech. The rogue Black Op is using cells secretly taken from the original Human Torch. These cells have been used to create a hive race of giant burning nanomachine-based robots called Pyronanos. The Pyronanos have gone rogue and have taken over the Thermogentech lab where they were created. Project Livewire assaults the building and discovers the Pyronanos attempting to build a nuclear fusion cannon to spread themselves across the land. After a long fire-fight, the members of Project Livewire manage to destroy both the facility and the Pyronanos.\n\nSince Stem Cell is straight \"out of the box\", she still has her default human emotional responses in place and has difficulty adapting to the experiences.\n\nAfter escaping the site of their battle in Issue 1, the team uses a plasma grenade to destroy Homebrew's remains, buries them, and then proceeds to their next two missions.\n\nThe first of these missions is the intimidation of a rogue AIM scientist. The second mission is carried out solo by Gothic Lolita. To succeed in her mission she has to steal an experimental Sentinel antimatter power core that is being transported aboard a civilian cargo plane.\n\nThe team infiltrates a night club that is the evening hang-out of a research scientist who is a known employee for one of their targeted black ops. Inside, Social Butterfly dances with the scientist and while doing so, uses her abilities to get his security codes. Meanwhile, Hollowpoint Ninja distracts the scientist's robotic bodyguard and makes sure it records nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nUsing the codes, Cornfed sabotages the black op's computers and in the process uncovers information that indicates a location where they could gain access to the highest priority target on their list. This target is a black op so secret that even its true code-name is unknown. It is known only by the nickname The White Whale.\n\nThe team stows aboard a tanker truck containing a shipment of inert nanofluid that is being delivered to the White Whale by AIM. At the arrival point, a huge black robot appears and takes the entire tanker up to the White Whale's headquarters. The headquarters is revealed to be a massive flying structure that was built around the frame of an \"officially wrecked\" S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. The White Whale itself is revealed later to be a hive mind made up of modified Nick Fury-based LMD's.\n\nOnce aboard, the White Whale discovers their existence very quickly, and the team's plans begin to fall apart. In the resulting turmoil there is a scramble to find safety as their enemies open fire. Team members begin to drop at this point. One of the huge outer guns is turned inward to shoot at the area of the fire-fight. Cornfed is hit and the blast disintegrates most of his body; his head and right shoulder are the only parts left intact. Gothic Lolita is caught by one of the White Whale LMD's and thrown into the Helicarrier's electromagnetic launcher. The launcher is designed to put a 10-ton payload into orbit, but Gothic Lolita is launched down instead of up. The impact is enough to cause a significant explosion. The last member to fall is Social Butterfly. She is cut to pieces by one of their foes using a high-tech monowire whip. Hollowpoint Ninja is captured shortly after pushing Stem Cell into the relative safety of a fuel pipe. Stem Cell is then forced to hack herself so that she can alter her emotions at will.\n\nThe battle ends when Stem Cell uses plans stolen from Thermogentech's files to create an upgraded version of the Pyronanos. Stem Cell designs these Pyronanos to run even hotter than the originals; she plans for the resulting explosion to destroy the Helicarrier. Lost in the resulting fight between the Pyronanos and the White Whale, Stem Cell recovers the remains of Cornfed and Social Butterfly. She then rescues Hollowpoint Ninja, who had lost one arm and both legs in the meantime, and launches an escape pod. Fleeing to safety, the two survivors watch as the Helicarrier explodes behind them.\n\nAfter reaching the ground, Stem Cell recovers the fused remains of Gothic Lolita and sets out for Project Livewire's headquarters with what is left of her teammates. Instead of the high tech building she is expecting, she finds a huge hole and demands Hollowpoint Ninja tell her what happened. He then shares a memory archive showing the events that took place when Project Livewire's mission orders were activated.\n\nUnknown to the other members of the Project, David Jenkins had a hidden agenda. He predicted that the robot's programmed machine logic would lead them to the conclusion that humans were likely to compromise the Project and that they would believe it to be within mission parameters to kill everyone else in the Project. Jenkins adapted their mission so that it would lead to the destruction of other black projects funded by the US government from a list he made himself. His reasoning for all of this was 'The sociopaths in suits can't be trusted.' Using the base's gamma reactor and more personal means, the robotic members killed all the human members of Project Livewire. Jenkins was voluntarily included in this killing. Before his death, he asked them to give his glasses to one of their own; they gave them to Stem Cell.\n\nThe series ends with Stem Cell trying to decide on a new name as she sets out to find a place to rebuild her teammates.\n\n\"Livewires\" #1-6 were published February - August 2005.

The concept was coined by Yuri Lotman in 1984 and is now applied to many fields, including cultural semiotics generally, biosemiotics, zoosemiotics, geosemiotics, etc. The concept is treated more fully in the collection of Lotman's writings published in English under the title \"Universe of the Mind: A Semiotic Theory of Culture\"(1990)\n\nYuri Lotman, a semiotician at Tartu University, Estonia, was inspired by Vladimir Vernadsky's terms biosphere and noosphere to propose that a semiosphere comes into being when any two Umwelten are communicating. Later, Jesper Hoffmeyer suggested a variation to the effect that the community of organisms occupying the semiosphere will inhabit a \"semiotic niche\". This implies that the semiosphere may be partially independent of the Umwelten. Kalevi Kull argues that this suggestion is not consistent with the nature of semiosis which can only be a product of the behaviour of the organisms in the environment. It is the organisms that create the signs which become the constituent parts of the semiosphere. This is not an adaptation to the existing environment, but the continuous creation of a new environment. Kull believes that it is only possible to accept Hoffmeyer's view as an analogy to the concept of an ecological niche as it is traditionally used in biology, so that the community develops according to the semiotic understanding of the processes which are responsible for the building of Umwelt.\n\n"}

The script was written by playwright Noel Langley, one of the screenwriters of \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nClem Morgan, demobilised from the Royal Air Force and unemployed after the war, is drawn into the world of crime. His psychopathic crime boss Narcy (short for Narcissus) deals in the black market, transporting goods in coffins to his headquarters in a funeral parlour. Clem finds the activity harmless enough, until one day he finds drugs in the latest coffin. Clem objects and tells his girlfriend, Ellie, that he will quit after one last job that night, the looting of a warehouse. Narcy betrays him, triggering the burglar alarm while he is inside. Clem manages to get back in the car with Narcy and another member of the gang, Soapy, before they drive off. When Narcy orders Soapy to run down a policeman, Clem grabs the wheel in an unsuccessful attempt to save the man's life and the car crashes into a lamppost. Narcy knocks him unconscious and has him moved to the driver's seat before fleeing with Soapy. Inspector Rockliffe arrives on the scene with other police officers to find the police officer dead and Clem injured in the car.\n\nClem is convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to fifteen years in prison in HM Prison Dartmoor. Sally Connor, Narcy's girlfriend, visits him in prison, telling him that Narcy is now with Ellie (who has not visited Morgan in prison) and that she knows he was framed as she was told so by Cora, Soapy's girlfriend. Sally offers to try and persuade Soapy to give evidence but Clem tells her to go away.\n\nBack in London, Sally tells Cora that she has seen Clem and wants to go and speak to Soapy to get him to tell the police what really happened, but Narcy has found out that Sally has gone to see Clem in prison and brutally beats her up.\n\nClem escapes from prison and the police start a manhunt for him. He seeks shelter in a remote farmhouse, where Mrs. Fenshaw lets him bathe, shave and change his clothes, and also cooks him some food. Mr. Fenshaw comes into the room, but turns out to be a hopeless drunk who is hardly aware of his surroundings. Mrs. Fenshaw then tries to get Clem to shoot her husband, stating that as he is already a murderer it won't make any difference to him. Clem refuses and leaves, but he has handled the gun, leaving his fingerprints on it, and Mrs. Fenshaw uses it to shoot her husband dead.\n\nClem is now wanted for the murder of Mr. Fenshaw as well, but makes his way back to London and goes to stay with Sally; he then manages to escape both the police and Narcy, but Sally is kidnapped by Narcy and his gang and taken to their hideout, where Cora is already being held. Cora is forced to tell Narcy where Soapy is hiding out (in a room in a rundown hotel nearby) and Narcy sends Jim to go and kill Soapy, which he does.\n\nClem, whilst trying to find Cora and Soapy, is caught by Rockliffe, who tells him that he is not convinced by Mrs. Fenshaw's story, the first indication that the police might believe in Clem's innocence. In order to use him as bait, Rockliffe lets Clem go, and he goes to the Valhalla funeral parlour to meet with Narcy's gang. After knocking other members of the gang out, Clem and Narcy end up fighting on the roof of the parlour, before Narcy falls to the ground. Rockliffe, Sally and Clem gather round, begging Narcy, who is dying, to tell the truth about who killed the policeman but Narcy sticks to his story and repeats that it was Clem, before dying. Rockliffe leads Clem away, whilst Sally promises to wait for him. The ending is rather ambiguous, as Clem presumably has to return to prison, and he is also facing a possible murder charge; all that Rockliffe can do is promise to look at any new evidence that comes up.\n\n\nAccording to trade papers, the film was a \"notable box office attraction\" at British cinemas in 1947.\n\n\"Artfully sculpted and suspenseful,\" wrote \"TV Guide\", \"THEY MADE ME A FUGITIVE makes for gripping, adult cinema.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1994555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994555", "title": "Omer (unit)", "text": "Omer (unit)\n\nThe omer ( \"‘ōmer\") is an ancient Israelite unit of dry measure used in the era of the Temple in Jerusalem. It is used in the Bible as an ancient unit of volume for grains and dry commodities, and the Torah mentions as being equal to one tenth of an \"ephah\". According to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" (1906), an \"ephah\" was defined as being 72 \"logs\", and the \"Log\" was equal to the Sumerian \"mina\", which was itself defined as one sixtieth of a \"maris\"; the \"omer\" was thus equal to about of a \"maris\". The \"maris\" was defined as being the quantity of water equal in weight to a light royal talent, and was thus equal to about 30.3 litres, making the \"omer\" equal to about 3.64 litres. The \"Jewish Study Bible\" (2014), however, places the \"omer\" at about 2.3 liters.\n\nIn traditional Jewish standards of measurement, the \"omer\" was equivalent to the capacity of 43.2 eggs, or what is also known as one-tenth of an ephah (three \"seahs\"). In dry weight, the \"omer\" weighed between 1.560 kg. to 1.770 kg., being the quantity of flour required to separate therefrom the dough offering.\n\nThe word \"omer\" is sometimes translated as \"sheaf\" — specifically, an amount of grain large enough to require bundling. The biblical episode of the manna describes God as instructing the Israelites to collect \"an omer for each person in your tent\", implying that each person could eat an omer of manna a day. In the Torah, the main significance of the \"omer\" is the traditional offering (during the Temple period) of an \"omer\" of barley on the day after the Sabbath, or, according to the rabbinical view, on the second day of Passover during the feast of unleavened bread, as well as the tradition of the Counting of the Omer (\"sefirat ha'omer\") - the 49 days between this sacrifice and the two loaves of wheat offered on the holiday of Shavuot. During the Temple period, the offering of the \"omer\" was one of twenty-four priestly gifts, and one of the ten which were offered to priests within the Temple precincts, when Jewish farmers would bring the first of that year's grain crop to Jerusalem. \n\nJews in Lancaster, Pennsylvania used an \"omer\" board from about 1800 to keep track of harvest days between Passover and Pentecost. An example of such a board survives at the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe \"omer\" should not be confused with the homer, a much larger unit of volume for liquids.\n\n"}

For his military service in World War I, he was awarded two Crosses of St. George personally by the Emperor Nicholas II of Russia (an award for exceptional military heroism). After the Russian Revolution he joined the \"All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)\" and fought for the Red Army partisan units against the German forces, as well as against Denikin's White Army in a Vasily Chapayev's cavalry division. In the interwar period he was a head of the local government in the town of Putyvl, Sumy Oblast (province).\n\nAt the time of the German invasion of Soviet Ukraine partisan units led by Sydir Kovpak waged guerrilla warfare against Axis forces originally in partisan strongholds in Sumy and Bryansk regions but later its operation spread deep into German occupied territory including Kiev, Zhytomyr, Rivne, Homyel, Volyn and other regions. These partisan units also fought against the nationalist Ukrainian Insurgent Army. In 1944 partisans under Kovpak's leadership raided enemy forces throughout western Ukraine and Belarus and even reached Romanian border regions during the Carpathian raid inflicting heavy casualties on the Germans.\n\nKovpak mastered guerrilla tactics and was awarded Hero of the Soviet Union title twice.

Depending on the supply of food, river trout measure in length; exceptionally they may be up to long and weigh up to over . Their back is olive-dark brown and silvery blue, red spots with light edges occur towards the belly, the belly itself is whitish yellow. River trout usually attains a weight of up to . They can live for up to 18 years.\n\nRiver trout live in fast flowing, oxygen-rich, cool clear waters with gravel or sandy riverbeds. They occur across almost all of Europe, from Portugal to the Volga, with the exception of Central Anatolia and the Caucasus regions. They are found as far north as Lapland. They do not occur in Greece or on the islands of Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily.\n\nRiver trout are very faithful to their habitat (i.e. they live only at one spot and do not migrate), leaving it only to reproduce. Even after being disturbed they will return to their traditional sites. The adult river trout requires its own territory. During the day it is hidden in the shadows of the river bank, facing upstream.\n\nDepending on size and habitat, they feed mainly on insects and insect larvae that live in water, small fish such as bullhead, small crustaceans, snails and other water animals. Cannibalism has also been frequently observed among river trout. They are fast swimming predators, but in rivers and streams they will usually take prey that is being driven past by the current.\n\nRiver trout spawn between October and January in the northern hemisphere and between May and June in the southern hemisphere. The fish uses rapid fanning of the tail and caudal fin on a rock riverbed to make several shallow pits, into which about 1,000 to 1,500 reddish eggs, four to five millimetre wide, are laid. The fish larvae emerge after two to four months.\n\nThe river trout has a special significances as a host fish for the glochidia of the freshwater pearl mussel.\n\nBecause trout live in habitats with fixed boundaries, in addition to the river trout, \"Salmo trutta fario\", there are various other subspecies of \"Salmo trutta\". \"See Species of Trout.\"\n\nThe tiger trout (\"Salmo trutta fario\" × \"Salvelinus fontinalis\") is a genetic cross between a river trout and a brook trout. It gets its name from its characteristic golden yellow markings. Tiger trout are sterile, despite male and female may be distinguished by their external markings. The female tiger trout does not develop any gonads. By contrast, male tiger trout develop testicles as well as secondary sex features such as kypes, humps, darker and thicker skin and a lighter fillet colouring during the spawning season.\n\nIn the past, European waterbodies were heavily and artificially stocked with rainbow trout, a native of America that grows more quickly and is less demanding of water quality. It is disputed whether this threatens the river trout. Today, it is bred in fishponds with almost the same rate of success as the rainbow trout, for food and for restocking rivers. To protect native species of fish, the stocking of rivers with non-native species has been restricted for several years.\n\nRiver trout makes an excellent fish dish.\n\nRiver trout is very popular with anglers. It is frequently fished using artificial lures. Angling with natural lures (worms, maggots, grasshoppers) is discouraged in most rivers because it is difficult to throw those trout back that are below the minimum landing size uninjured, when they have ingested this food so quickly and deeply.\n\nFly rods are used to catch river trout. Medium-sized, wet and dry flies are thrown into streams with a rod of AFTMA Class 4-6 and are intended to mimic an emerging or egg-laying insect.\nA spinning rod can also be used in some waters. For this purpose, a light spinning rod and various artificial lures, such as spoon lures and spinners are used. In using wobblers and rubber fish care should be taken because they are banned on some waterbodies or may only be used with restrictions.\n\nThe fish has been used as a bio-indicator species in freshwater systems due to their sensitive nature. They are a well-established ‘model organism’ in aquatic toxicology research, especially for heavy metal bioaccumulation.\n\n"}
{"id": "1994668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994668", "title": "Hāfu", "text": "Hāfu\n\n\n\nHāfu refers to a person who has one ethnic Japanese parent and one non-ethnic Japanese parent. The term ethnic Japanese refers to the Indigenous Japanese people of the Japanese archipelago. Over the course of centuries the minority ethnic groups such as the Ainu and Ryukyuans were mostly assimilated into the Yamato population. Mixed race couples and thus hāfu people were rare in feudal Japan. There were mixed Asian couples between ethnic Japanese and other East and Southeast Asian peoples.\n\nThe most well-regarded theory is that present-day Yamato Japanese are descendants of both the Indigenous Jōmon people and the immigrant Yayoi people. The Yayoi were an admixture (1,000 BCE–300 CE) of migrants from East Asia (mostly China and the Korean peninsula).\n\nModern mainland (Yamato) Japanese have less than 20% Jomon people's genomes. In modern Japan, the term Yamato \"minzoku\" is seen as antiquated for connoting racial notions that have been discarded in many circles since Japan's surrender in World War II. The term \"Japanese people\" or even \"Japanese-Japanese\" are often used instead.\n\nGenetic and anthropological studies indicate that the Ryukyuans are significantly related to the Ainu people and share the ancestry with the indigenous prehistoric Jōmon period (pre 10,000–1,000 BCE) people, who arrived from Southeast Asia and with the Yamato people. During the Meiji period, the Ryukyuans distinct culture was suppressed by the Meiji government and faced forced assimilation.\n\nEnglish sailor William Adams, a navigator for the Dutch East India Company, settled in Japan in April 1600. He was ultimately granted the rank of samurai, one of the few non-Japanese to do so. He wed Oyuki (お雪), a Japanese woman and together, they had two children, Joseph and Susanna, who were \"hāfu\".\n\nChinese military leader Chenggong Zheng, historically known as Koxinga (1624-1662), was \"hāfu\", born in Japan to a Japanese mother and Chinese father and raised there until the age of seven, known by the Japanese given name, Fukumatsu.\n\nSince 1899, the Ainu were increasingly marginalized. During a period of only 36 years, the Ainu went from being a relatively isolated group of people to having their land, language, religion and customs assimilated into those of the Japanese. Intermarriage between Japanese and Ainu was actively promoted by the Ainu to lessen the chances of discrimination against their offspring. As a result, many Ainu are indistinguishable from their Japanese neighbors, but some Ainu Japanese are interested in traditional Ainu culture.\n\nThe presence of the United States Armed Forces in Japan and Asia saw the birth of many children born to American fathers; these children were called Amerasians. It's estimated that by 1952, anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 Japanese children were fathered by American servicemen, with many of the children placed for adoption by their Japanese mothers due to the stigma of out-of-wedlock pregnancy and miscegenation and the struggles of supporting a child alone in post-war Japan. One orphanage, , in Yokohama, run by Franciscan nuns, opened in 1946 and, by 1948, staff members were caring for 126 children fathered by American servicemen, by 1950 and 136 children. A letter, dated 1948, detailed an incident of a malnourished infant born to a Japanese teenager whose American father refused to support for fear his wife would learn of his extramarital affair. Another orphanage, opened in Ōiso by a Japanese woman named Miki Sawada, cared for more than 700 Amerasian children, none of whom were visited or supported by their American fathers.\n\nFashionable images of the half Japanese people have become prominent especially with the increased appearance of \"hāfu\" in the Japanese media. \"Hāfu\" models are now seen on television or fill the pages of fashion magazines such as \"Non-no\", \"CanCam\" and \"Vivi\" as often as newsreaders or celebrities. The appearance of \"hāfu\" in the media has provided the basis for such a vivid representation of them in the culture.\n\nOne of the earliest terms referring to half Japanese was \"ainoko\", meaning a child born of a relationship between two races. It is still used in Latin America, most prominently Brazil (where spellings such as \"ainoco\", \"ainoca\" (f.) and \"ainocô\" may be found), to refer to \"mestizo\" (broader Spanish sense of mixed race in general) or \"mestiço\" people of some Japanese ancestry. Nevertheless, it evolved to an umbrella term for Eurasian or mixed Asian/mestizo, Asian/black, Asian/Arab and Asian/indigenous heritage in general. At the same time it is possible for people with little Japanese or other Asian ancestry to be perceivable just by their phenotype to identify mostly as black, white or mestizo/pardo instead of \"ainoko\", while people with about a quarter or less of non-Asian ancestry may identify just as Asian.\n\nSoon this, too, became a taboo term due to its derogatory connotations such as illegitimacy and discrimination. What were central to these labels were the emphasis on \"blood impurity\" and the obvious separation of the half Japanese from the majority of Japanese. Some English-speaking parents of children of mixed ethnicity use the word \"double.\" Amerasian is another term for children of mixed ancestry, especially those born to Japanese mothers and U.S. military fathers.\n\nOf the one million children born in Japan in 2013, 2.2% had one or more non-Japanese parent. According to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, one in forty-nine babies born in Japan today are born into families with one non-Japanese parent. Most intermarriages in Japan are between Japanese men and women from other Asian countries, including China, the Philippines and South Korea. Southeast Asia too, also has significant populations of people with half Japanese ancestry, particularly in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\nIn the 21st century, stereotyping and discrimination against hāfu occurs based on how different their identity, behaviour and appearance is from a typical Japanese person. The hafu of international marriages between Japanese and other Asians tend to blend in easier in Japanese society. They can have a bicultural identity. Their foreign side could be suppressed in Japan's homogeneous culture.\n\nThe documentary film \"Hafu: The Mixed-Race Experience in Japan\" was released in April 2013. It is about the experiences of five hāfu living in Japan. It deals with issues of identity, multiculturalism, relationships, hardship and stereotyping that they face.\n\nIn September 2018, Naomi Osaka is the first Japanese woman and hāfu to contest a Grand Slam singles final and the first Japanese Grand Slam singles champion. Naomi Osaka is the winner of the 2018 US Open Women's Singles.\n\nThe population is aging and decreasing due to the low birthrate in Japan. The fertility rate is about 1.44 children per woman (2019). This is far below the 2.1 children per woman that's required to maintain a stable population. Japan had 126.5 million people in 2018. The population of only Japanese nationals was 124.8 million in January 2019. So there's an estimated 1.7 million foreign residents in Japan which is the highest to date. 2/3rd of all migrants come from China, South Korea, Vietnam and the Philippines. Currently 1 in 4 people is aged 65 and older in Japan. If the birthrate doesn't improve then there will be 1 in 3 old people by 2050.\n\nThe percentage of hāfu is increasing, but it is still a minority in Japan. The Government of Japan regards all naturalized Japanese citizens and native-born Japanese nationals with multi-ethnic background as Japanese. It doesn't distinguish based on their ethnicity. There's no official ethnicity census data.\n\n describes an individual who is either the child of one Japanese and one non-Japanese parent or, less commonly, two half Japanese parents. Because the term is specific to individuals of ethnic Japanese (Yamato) ancestry, individuals whose Japanese ancestry is not of ethnic Japanese origin, such as Zainichi Koreans (e.g. Crystal Kay Williams and Kiko Mizuhara) will not be listed. This list is only for notable Hāfu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are fictional hāfu characters.\n\nIn a wider sense, the word can be used to describe a child between any combination of mixed parents. For example \"Meghan Markle is a \"hāfu\" between a Black and a White\".\n\n"}

The series follows a police detective suffering from multiple personality disorder.\n\n\"MPD Psycho\" was adapted as a live action television miniseries in 2000, directed by Takashi Miike.\n\nYôsuke Kobayashi is a detective and is on the case of a serial killer who dismembers his victims. The killer later sends Yôsuke's girlfriend dismembered but kept alive. Yôsuke hunts down the killer and due to the events, loses his sanity and develops Dissociative identity disorder with the two main personalities being Kazuhiko Amamiya, a cool headed detective and Shinji Nishizono, a reckless psychopath. After being placed in prison for murdering the killer, Yôsuke Kobayashi is released and works for an independent detective agency ran by Machi Isono. Later serial killers are appearing with barcodes in their left eyes, which Yôsuke Kobayashi also has. Yôsuke Kobayashi investigations lead him to believe he is not who he thinks he is and that his Kazuhiko and Shinji personalities have existed since childhood.\n\nDuring the case known as \"Lucy Seven\", Shinji gains control of Yôsuke Kobayashi and disappears.\n\nLater, it is found out that the Gakuso organization is behind the barcodes. Machi investigates and learns that Kazuhiko Amamiya and Shinji Nishizono are programmed personalities, genetically created (apparently by Gakuso) so that they could merge into a joint personality that is expected to greatly resemble that of Lucy Monostone, a legendary serial killer with a counter-culture personality.\n\nIt is revealed that there are multiple Shinji Nishizono personalities and that one exists in Machi's sister, Miwa. Miwa meanwhile runs into Yôsuke Kobayashi on a plane and manages to absorb the Kazuhiko Amamiya personality. At the same time, another host of a Shinji Nishizono personality (a teenager named Tetora Nishizono, who can temporarily transfer his Shinji Nishijono personality template to others) escapes from the Gakuso organization and runs into Miwa. She later gives the Kazuhiko personality to Tetora, who needs to add that personality to his own in order to remain psychologically stable. In exchange, Miwa demands that Tetora promise to keep the Kazuhiko personality alive and safe inside him no matter what.\n\nMeanwhile, evidence of internal conflict inside Gakuso and of political use of same by high Japanese authorities mounts, and the police officers investigating the murders find themselves dealing with conflict and suspicion from all sides.\n\nA few years later, Tetora continues his run from the Gakuso organization. The plot takes surprising turns, removing central characters while introducing new ones, leading to issue #11 which is in its entirety a flashback to events previous to the first issue of the series, bringing a new, more complete understanding of the whole situation. By #12 we resume the current day storyline and learn of new motivations for at least two characters. Gakuso's nature and goals are also fleshed out in a surprising way.\n\n appears to be a police detective working on a serial killing case. While tracking down a serial killer who mutilates his victims by severing their limbs, his girlfriend (Chizuko) is mutilated by the killer, who claims to recognise the detective as a fellow psychopath. \nAfter tracking down the killer, , an arrogant and callous psychopath, emerges and shoots the killer. This personality quickly disappears and is replaced by , a cool-headed, serious criminologist. Amamiya is then arrested and imprisoned for the murder of the serial killer.\nThroughout the course of the story, Amamiya Kazuhiko and Nishizono Shinji's personality switch back and forth, with Shinji's personality usually emerging only after a traumatic incident (such as the burning of several bodies) or when the body is in danger. It is usually clear to the reader which personality is in control at any given time as Kazuhiko Amamiya is near-sighted and wears glasses, whereas Shinji Nishizono does not require glasses.\nIt is later revealed that the original personality of the body belonged to Nishizono Shinji who had killed, along with Murata Kiyoshi, the original Kobayashi Yosuke, the original Amamiya Minako and the original Sakurai Kotone as well as severely burning the original Amamiya Kazuhiko.\nAfter seeing the decapitated bodies of two of the Lucy 7, Nishizono Shinji regains control over his body and reappears after a 6-month time-skip. Coincidentally, he sees Isono Miwa and decides to get on the same flight as her because he thought that \"some interesting things would occur\" and assists in the hijacking of the plane for his own purposes. While on the plane, Isono Miwa, after a brief struggle, successfully absorbs the personality of Amamiya Kazuhiko from him.\nHe is shot and killed by a Gakuso Company member while facing off with Nishizono Tetora on the Gakuso experiment ship.\n\n is an intelligent female criminologist who runs a private consultancy firm. She employs Kazuhiko Amamiya upon his release from prison and invites him to live in the large apartment which serves as home to herself and her sister as well as the headquarters of her business. Her real name is revealed in #13 to be Wakana Isono Monostone.\n\n is the younger sister of Isono Machi. She is initially introduced as a schoolgirl with a forceful personality who occasionally helps Machi and Amamiya in their cases. As the series progresses, she becomes more important as revelations about her role in the conspiracy that runs through the book are revealed. She is later revealed as a new generation bar-coder who carries a crucial alternate personality for the formation of Lucy Monostone. Her last seemingly important role was to transfer the personality of Kazuhiko Amamiya to Nishizono Tetora. Miwa Isono appears episodes five and six of the television series as a comatose girl rescued from a burning hospital who later forms a relationship with Amamiya.\n\n is a young teenaged version of Kazuhiko Amamiya, Tetora Nishizono also carries the psychopathic personality of Shinji Nishizono, although the personality of Shinji is far more dominant in Tetora. He receives Kazuhiko's personality from Isono Miwa. \"Tetora Nishizono does not appear in the TV mini-series.\"\n\n\nGakuso is a very secret, very influential and ruthless company with surprisingly high technology in the field of genetics, shrouded in mystery and sometimes confusing in its goals. Some evidence exists that it suffers from serious internal conflict and seems to have a branch referred separately to as \"Onihigata\". Many of the antagonists are involved with Gakuso in some capacity, not always knowing or willing so. For some reason, one of the main projects of Gakuso seems to be recreating Lucy Monostone by mixing fragments of programmed personalities in a host body. It is revealed in chapter 79 that the reason Gakuso does the barcode experiments is not just to make a perfect killer, but a controllable one who will serve to further their companies aims.\n\nAfter hints in previous issues, Gakuso's larger political goals are fleshed out in #12.\n\nA pale-haired man who seems frequently involved with many serial killers, including Toguchi Kikuo, Nishizono Shinji (original) and Umemiya Akio. He refers to an unnamed woman as his \"mama\". He shows abnormal regenerative abilities (being able to completely regenerate his forearm) and wears earphone-like machines which can release endorphins to dull his sense of pain. He often uses guns with abnormally powerful firepower. As a punishment for \"losing Tetora\" as well as several other blunders, he was disfigured.\n\nThe real first appears in chapter 10 in a flashback of \"20 years ago\" where he is apparently killed and burnt by Nishizono Shinji and Murata Kiyoshi. He reappears as an adult near Teu at the end of chapter 28 with a distinctive burn on the left side of his face and a later flashback reveals that he was rescued by an individual that appears to be Teu. He dies after being tricked by Nishizono Tetora into absorbing a destructive program.\n\nSomewhat shy and mentally retarded, the real Murata Kiyoshi first appears in chapter 10 in a flashback of \"20 years ago\" where he assists the real Nishizono Shinji in disposing of the corpses of the other children and the nurse at Amamiya clinic. He refers to Shinji as \"Shin-chan\" and claims that he was the only one who did not bully him. He is burnt to death after a fire spreads to the oil that he is drenched with.\n\n, a deceased former American pop star and terrorist, is thought by the mysterious corporation at the heart of the conspiracy to be the perfect killer. While genetic engineering can recreate Monostone's body, the challenge appears to be recreating his soul in order for the ultimate murderer to be reborn. It seems that this can only be achieved by combining a number of personalities, representing the different parts of Monostone, into a single vessel.\n\nA bumbling police detective and friend of Kazuhiko and Machi. Short tempered and easily confused, Sasayama is nevertheless a \"straight arrow\" and reliably on the side of the good guys. After Kazuhiko Amamiya is taken over by Nishzono Shinji, Sasayama becomes a much more central character to the story.\n\nA police officer, introduced in Chapter 8 (Vol. 8). Plays a major role in the \"Wings\" case. Later on is suspected in the death of a Chinese doctor.\n\nA police detective that partners with Sasayama, beginning in Chapter 8 (Vol. 8). Often made fun of by Sasayama for her short stature.\n\nA high-ranked police officer introduced in Chapter 3 (Vol. 3). Despite his duties to Onihigata, he seems sincerely interested in unraveling the mysteries behind the murders and promoting justice and safety. He is the Spare of Tatsuo Onihigata, making the sole purpose of his existence to be an organ donor should original need one. He dies after a failed attempt to kill Onihigata, and ultimately donates his liver (unwillingly) to his would-be victim.\n\nMinister of Justice of Japan. Heavily involved in the plot and a highly skilled manipulator.\n\nA later employee of Machi Isono. He is the nephew of Lucy Monostone, and the supposed \"perfect vessel\" for the personalities that make up the soul of his uncle. He is killed by Nishizono Tetora while trying to retrieve the personality of Kazuhiko Amamiya.\n\nA journalistic photographer that often works along Sasayama at the time of the beginning of the story. He plays an important role in revealing the existence of the Shinji Nishizono personality to Machi Isono. His most recognizable feature is his eyepatch that often contain different pictures such as an eyeball, a smiley face, a barcode, (etc.) on its surface. After he learns that he has cataracts in his remaining eye, he reverts into the killer that all of the bar-code samples ultimately become.\n\nA field operative of Gakuso. He is thought to be immortal by many characters as he seems to survive every attack made on him, including being run over by a car, and falling with a helicopter which explodes crashes into a tower when the pilot is shot.\n\nGakuso staff. Enjoys sweets and candy to a pitiful extent. Talks through a mechanical device attached to his neck. He was in charge of keeping Nishizono Tetora under control by supplying him with medicines which must be taken in sequential order based on the numbers printed on the pills. He calls these pills \"candies\". These medications stabilize Tetora's personalities and allow him to survive. However, when Sasayama supplies Tetora with the \"zero candy\", he is no longer reliant on the Candyman and kills him.\n\nGakuso staff. Often changes her name. Head of the Gakuso research boat. She is apparently involved with a faction of Gakuso that is in conflict with Onihigata.\n\n\"MPD Psycho\" was initially published in \"Shōnen Ace\", moving to \"Comic Charge\" in 2007 and remaining there until the magazine was cancelled in 2009. Then it moved again, this time to the new publication \"Young Ace\", which debuted in the later half of 2009. The \"Last Chapter\" of \"MPD Psycho\" was published on February 4, 2016 and it was followed by \"The End+ONE\" on March 4. Dark Horse Comics published the English translation, but put the series on indefinite hiatus after volume 9 was released. Dark Horse announced in September 2010 it would resume \"MPD Psycho\" with the stabilization of the American manga market. The tenth volume was published in December 2011, followed by another hiatus that ended with the publication of the eleventh volume on July 23, 2014. The digital volumes of \"MPD Psycho\" were released on BookWalker on November 6, 2015.\n\nDrawn by \n\nThe plot is similar to the beginning of the manga series but does not relate to the incidents of Lucy Monostone and the Gakuso Company. Yosuke Kobayashi, a detective assigned to a homicide unit, saw his wife killed by a serial killer, Shinji Nishizono. From the shock of the incident, he suffers from multiple personality disorder and becomes Kazuhiko Amamiya. Soon after he manages to hunt down and kill his wife's murderer. Now a series of murders have started and the suspect claimed to be Shinji Nishizono.\n\n"}

It rises imposingly on a rocky hill, above sea level, surrounded by the Buna and Drin rivers. Shkodër is the seat of Shkodër County, and is one of Albania's oldest and most historic towns, as well as an important cultural and economic centre.\n\nDue to its strategic location, the hill has been settled since antiquity. It was an Illyrian stronghold during the rule of the Labeates and Ardiaei, whose capital was Scodra.\n\nDuring the Third Illyrian War the Illyrian king Gentius concentrated his forces in Scodra. When he was attacked by the Roman army lead by L. Anicius Gallus, Gentius fled into the city and was trapped there hoping that his brother Caravantius would come at any moment with a large relieving army, but it didn't happen. After his defeat, Gentius sent two prominent tribal leaders, Teuticus and Bellus, as envoys to negotiate with the Roman commander. On the third day of the truce, Gentius surrendered to the Romans, was placed in custody and sent to Rome. The Roman army marched north of Scutari Lake where, at Meteon, they captured Gentius' wife queen Etuta, his brother Caravantius, his sons Scerdilaidas and Pleuratus along with leading Illyrians.\n\nThe fall of the Ardiaean Kingdom in 168 BC is transmitted by Livy in a ceremonial manner of the triumph of Anicius in Rome:\n\nThe 19th-century German author and explorer Johann Georg von Hahn suggested that the ancient and medieval city of Shkodër was located immediately south of the Rozafa hill, between the hill and the confluence of Buna and Drin. The fortifications, as they have been preserved to date, are mostly of Venetian origin.\n\nWithin the Castle there are the ruins of a 13th-century Venetian Catholic church, considered by scholars as the St. Steven's Cathedral, which after the siege of Shkodër in the 15th century, when the Ottoman Empire captured the city, was transformed into the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Mosque.\n\nThe castle has been the site of several famous sieges, including the siege of Shkodër of 1478-79 and the siege of Shkodër of 1912-13. The castle and its surroundings form an Archaeological Park of Albania.\n\nThere is a famous legend among Albanians associated with the construction of the Rozafa Castle, which has been transmitted orally from ancient times, with immurement and human sacrifice as main themes.\n\nThe story tells about the initiative of three brothers who set down to build a castle. They worked all day, but the foundation walls fell down at night. They met a wise old man who seems to know the solution of the problem asking them if they were married. When the three brothers responded positively, the old man said:\n\nThe three brothers swore on \"besa\" to not speak with their wives of that happened. However the two eldest brothers broke their promise and quietly told their wives everything, while the honest youngest brother kept his \"besa\" and said nothing. The mother of the three brothers knew nothing of their agreement, and while the next afternoon at lunch time, she asked her daughters-in-law to bring lunch to the workers, two of them refused with an excuse. The brothers waited anxiously to see which wife was carrying the basket of food. It was Rozafa, the wife of the youngest brother, who left her younger son at home. Embittered, the youngest brother explained to her what the deal was, that she was to be sacrificed and buried in the wall of the castle so that they could finish building it, and she didn't protest but, worried about her infant son, she accepted being immured and made a request:\n\n\n"}

The precise origin of the practice of leaving crosses on the hill is uncertain, but it is believed that the first crosses were placed on the former Jurgaičiai or Domantai hill fort after the 1831 Uprising. Over the generations, not only crosses and crucifixes, but statues of the Virgin Mary, carvings of Lithuanian patriots and thousands of tiny effigies and rosaries have been brought here by Catholic pilgrims. The exact number of crosses is unknown, but estimates put it at about 55,000 in 1990 and 100,000 in 2006. It is a major site of Catholic pilgrimage in Lithuania.\n\nOver the generations, the place has come to signify the peaceful endurance of Lithuanian people despite the threats they faced throughout history. After the 3rd partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Lithuania became part of the Russian Empire. Poles and Lithuanians unsuccessfully rebelled against Russian authorities in 1831 and 1863. These two uprisings are connected with the beginnings of the hill: as families could not locate bodies of perished rebels, they started putting up symbolic crosses in place of a former hill fort.\n\nWhen the old political structure of Eastern Europe fell apart in 1918, Lithuania once again declared its independence. Throughout this time, the Hill of Crosses was used as a place for Lithuanians to pray for peace, for their country, and for the loved ones they had lost during the Wars of Independence.\n\nThe site took on a special significance during the years 1944–1990, when Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union. Continuing to travel to the hill and leave their tributes, Lithuanians used it to demonstrate their allegiance to their original identity, religion and heritage. It was a venue of peaceful resistance, although the Soviets worked hard to remove new crosses, and bulldozed the site at least three times (including attempts in 1963 and 1973). There were even rumors that the authorities planned to build a dam on the nearby Kulvė River, a tributary to Mūša, so that the hill would end up underwater.\n\nOn September 7, 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the Hill of Crosses, declaring it a place for hope, peace, love and sacrifice. In 2000 a Franciscan hermitage was opened nearby. The interior decoration draws links with La Verna, the mountain where St. Francis is said to have received his stigmata. In May 2013, Šiauliai District Municipality adopted rules regarding the placement of crosses. People are allowed to erect wooden crosses less than in height with no permits.\n\nIn December 2019, a woman tourist from China removed and tossed away a cross believed to be set up by Hong Kong pro-democracy camp. She later condemned the protesters in a Twitter post and in an Instagram video saying, \"We have done a good thing today. Our motherland is great.\" Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevičius condemned the woman's action in a tweet that called it a \"shameful, disgraceful act of vandalism\" and said such behavior \"can't and won't be tolerated.\"\n\n"}

Specifically it is used for joint infections, meningitis, pneumonia, sepsis, urinary tract infections, malignant otitis externa, \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" infection, and vibrio infection. It is given by injection into a vein, muscle, or eye.\nCommon side effects include nausea, allergic reactions, and pain at the site of injection. Other side effects may include \"Clostridium difficile\" diarrhea. It is not recommended in people who have had previous anaphylaxis to a penicillin. Its use is relatively safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is in the third-generation cephalosporin family of medications and works by interfering with the bacteria's cell wall.\nCeftazidime was patented in 1978 and came into commercial use in 1984. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Ceftazidime is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$2.84–16.76 per day. In the United States a course of treatment costs $100–200.\n\nCeftazidime is used to treat lower respiratory tract, skin, urinary tract, blood-stream, joint, and abdominal infections, and meningitis. \nThe drug is given intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM) every 8–12 hours (two or three times a day), with dose and frequency varying by the type of infection, severity, and/or renal function of the person. Ceftazidime is also commonly prescribed off-label for nebulization in people with cystic fibrosis for the suppression of \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" in the lungs as well as the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations. Those with kidney disease are dosed less frequently.\n\nCeftazidime is the first-line treatment for the tropical infection, melioidosis, an important cause of sepsis in Asia and Australia.\n\nLabeled indications include the treatment of patients with: \n\nAs a class, cephalosporins have activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The balance of activity tips toward Gram-positive organisms for earlier generations; later generations of cephalosporins have more Gram-negative coverage.

It is not active against methicillin-resistant \"Staphylococcus aureus\".\n\nClinically relevant organisms against which ceftazidime has activity include:\nThe following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few clinically significant pathogens:\n\nCeftazidime is generally well tolerated. When side effects occur, they are most commonly local effects from the intravenous line site, allergic reactions, and gastrointestinal symptoms. According to one manufacturer, in clinical trials, allergic reactions including itching, rash, and fever, happened in fewer than 2% of patients. Rare but more serious allergic reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme, have been reported with this class of antibiotics, including ceftazidime. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, were reported in fewer than 2% of patients.\n\nAnother source reported, in addition, blood tests of patients may show increased eosinophils (8%), increased lactate dehydrogenase (6%), increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (5%), positive direct Coombs test (4%), increased platelets (thrombocythemia) (2%), increased ALT (7%), increased AST (6%), or increased alkaline phosphatase (4%).\n\nCeftazidime is contraindicated in people with a known allergy to ceftazidime or to any other cephalosporin antibiotic.\n\nCeftazidime is mainly eliminated by the kidneys into the urine. As such, drug levels in the blood may build up in persons with kidney injury or kidney disease. This includes those on dialysis. In these cases of renal impairment, the drug is dosed less frequently. No dose adjustment is needed for those with liver disease.\n\nCeftazidime falls under the pregnancy category B. According to the manufacturer, research studies in mice and rats showed no evidence of harm to the fetus, even at up to 40 times the human dose of ceftazidime. Importantly, though, no high-quality research studies of the effects of the drug in pregnant women were conducted.\n\nThird-generation cephalosporins differ from earlier generations in the presence of a C=N-OCH group in their chemical structure (cefuroxime & cefuzonam also bear this functional group but are only listed as class II). This group provides improved stability against certain beta-lactamase enzymes produced by Gram-negative bacteria. These bacterial enzymes rapidly destroy earlier-generation cephalosporins by breaking open the drug's beta-lactam chemical ring, leading to antibiotic resistance. Though initially active against these bacteria, with widespread use of third-generation cephalosporins, some Gram-negative bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are even able to inactivate the third-generation cephalosporins. Infections caused by ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria are of particular concern in hospitals and other healthcare facilities.\n\nIn addition to the \"syn\"-configuration of the imino side chain, compared to other third-generation cephalosporins, the more complex moiety (containing two methyl and a carboxylic acid group) confers extra stability to β-lactamase enzymes produced by many Gram-negative bacteria. The extra stability to β-lactamases increases the activity of ceftazidime against otherwise resistant Gram-negative organisms including \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\". The charged pyridinium moiety increases water-solubility. Ceftazidime shares the same variable R-group side chain with aztreonam, a monobactam antibiotic; the two drugs share a similar spectrum of activity, including activity against \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\".\n\n"}

He wrote the screenplay which formed the basis for the 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\" and is one of the three credited screenwriters for the film. His finished script for the film was revised by Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf, the other credited screenwriters. Langley objected to their changes and lamented the final cut upon first seeing it, but later revised his opinion. He attempted to write a sequel based on \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\" using many of the concepts he had added to its predecessor, but this was never realised.\n\nBorn on Christmas Day in Durban, South Africa, Noel Langley was the son of Durban High School headmaster Aubrey Samuel Langley and Dora Agnes Allison. Noel Langley attended his father's school (Durban High School- KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) until 1930. Noel's relationship with his headmaster father was a strained one as he did not meet his father's expectations. His father, Aubrey Samuel 'Madevu' (the isiZulu word for mustache), was a queer mix of sensitive artist, strict disciplinarian and rugby football enthusiast valued boys who were physically active. It seems that Langley senior rejected his son who was artistically inclined and physically weak (he was barred from sport and cadet drill by his doctor, Dr George Campbell). Their relationship was so poor that Noel bragged to Jack Cope (a fellow Natalian, poet and novelist) after his father's death that he had helped kill his father by sending him money for drink.\n\nHe then studied at the University of Natal, from which he graduated with a BA in 1934. While at University, he began writing plays. His play \"Queer Cargo\" was produced by the Durban Repertory Theatre in 1932. Sailing for England, post-graduation, he by chance met a cousin of Charles Wyndham, the founder of London's Wyndham's Theatre. \"Queer Cargo\" was subsequently produced at Wyndham's Theatre where it ran for seven months. Langley wrote other plays for the West End stage in this period, which included \"For Ever\" and \"Farm of Three Echoes\". His first big success came in 1935 with the publication of his first novel, \"Cage Me a Peacock\", a satire set in ancient Rome. This was followed by another novel, \"There's a Porpoise Close Behind Us\", and a children's book, \"The Land of Green Ginger\", in 1936. Langley began writing for films in the 1930s, helping to write the British films \"King of the Damned\" and \"Secret of Stamboul.\" Langley then left London for Hollywood, having accepted a seven-year contract as a screenwriter for MGM.\n\nAt MGM, his first credited film was \"Maytime\", a musical based on the 1917 operetta. In part due to the success of his own children's book \"The Land of Green Ginger\", he was one of the screenwriters chosen for the job of adapting L. Frank Baum's children's novel \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" for film. In 11 days, he provided a 43-page adaptation. Changes he introduced to the story are the inclusion of the actors playing the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, and the Lion characters as farmworkers in the sepia tone Kansas sequences as well as changing the color of Dorothy's shoes from silver to ruby. Langley also introduced Miss Almira Gulch, the Wicked Witch's Kansas counterpart. He then wrote a final draft. However, unbeknownst to him, MGM hired Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf to do rewrites. But, producer Arthur Freed was displeased with their work and turned the script back over to Langley. Langley disliked their changes and removed many of them. He felt that their version was \"so cutesy and oozy that I could have vomited.\" The final film was released in August 1939. Langley was dismayed by the end result. He said, \"I saw it in a cinema on Hollywood Boulevard at noon and I sat and cried like a bloody child.\" However, he amended his opinion when he saw the film for a second time in England during its 1949 re-release: \"I thought, 'It’s not a bad picture. Not a bad picture, you know'.\"\n\nAfter World War II, during which he served in the Canadian Navy, Langley worked on many British films. He also co-wrote the hit West End play \"Edward, My Son\" with Robert Morley. His film credits include the film noir \"They Made Me a Fugitive\" (1947), the remake of \"Tom Brown's Schooldays\" (1951), the Alastair Sim \"Scrooge\" (1951), \"The Pickwick Papers\" (1952), \"Ivanhoe\" (1952) and the Technicolor \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" (1952). (His contribution to \"Zenda\", however, was minimal, since the 1952 film followed the script nearly word-for-word the 1937 film version, on which Langley did \"not\" work.)\n\nIn 1964, Langley made a series of tapes for New York radio station WBAI, reading \"The Tale of the Land of Green Ginger\" in its entirety. He subsequently edited it down to fit on an LP, which was issued by the listener-sponsored station and offered as a fund-raising premium. Langley continued to write novels and plays throughout his life. He also wrote short stories for the \"Saturday Evening Post\" and other magazines.\n\nIn 1937, Langley married Naomi Mary Legate in Los Angeles. They had been a couple since his days in South Africa. They later had five children. The couple divorced in California in 1954 and Noel Langley obtained custody of the children. She is believed to have returned to her hometown of Pietermaritzburg.\n\nLangley married actress Pamela Deeming in 1959.\n\nIn 1961, Langley became a naturalised US citizen.\n\nIn his later years, Langley worked part-time in drug rehabilitation. He died in 1980 in Desert Hot Springs, California, United States.\n\n\n\n"}

He is a singer/songwriter and author. He is the vocalist of the Taiwanese band Mayday. Ashin majored in art in college, where he also began his musical career. Mayday is one of the most successful Taiwanese bands and has greatly influenced the Taiwanese entertainment industry. Ashin is also the founder and designer of the clothing line StayReal and a shareholder of the music label B'in Music. He was elected as a board member of the Taiwan Public Television Service in 2013.\n\nAshin was born into a family of four, consisting of his parents, himself, and a younger brother. His family owned a record store, which inspired his passion for music. Ashin's childhood ambition was to become a singer, but his vocal range was too narrow. He claims his bandmates selected him to be Mayday's singer as he was the worst instrumentalist out of all of them. Ashin can play both guitar and drums.\n\nAshin attended a public elementary and middle school in Beitou District. After graduating from middle school, he was accepted into one of the top high schools in Taiwan, The Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University, where he majored in visual arts. Ashin joined the high school's guitar club and was made president the following year. It was in the guitar club that he met the other members of Mayday: Monster, Masa, and Stone. At the age of 19, he started composing. The first song, \"Hao Ju Hao San\", was released on Richie Jen's 2001 album \"Fei Niao.\" After graduating from high school, Ashin attended Shih Chien University, where he majored in interior design. Mayday began to start seeing success while Ashin was still in college.\n\nIn 1995, together with Monster and Qian You-Da (Mayday's original drummer), Ashin formed \"SoBand\". Shortly after the band formed, Masa came on board as the band's bassist. Ashin was both the lead vocalist and the guitarist and during their formative years the band played at a number of major bars across the country. In 1997, shortly after Stone joined the band, the members decided to change their name to Mayday. Ming joined the band later as the group's drummer.\n\nMayday first started off as an underground rock band. They sent demo tapes to the then major record labels and were spotted by renowned producer Jonathan Lee (李宗盛) of Rock Records. Mayday released their first official album in 1999 and began to gain a steady stream of fans. They released five albums under Rock Records, before teaming up with director of Rock Records, Chen Yong-Zhi(陳勇志) to found B'in Music Co. Ltd (相信音樂) in 2006.\n\nAshin used to be Mayday's sole composer; it was only during production of the band's fifth album that other band members began to contribute their own work. Ashin's compositional talents have been highly sought after by other artists and as a result he has composed a significant number of songs for other artists, such as: Fish Leong (梁静茹), Rene Liu (劉若英), S.H.E.\n\nAshin published his first book, Happy.Birth.Day, in 2006. It features the lyrics of 60 of his songs, as well as a selection of his photography.\n\nIn 2008, he published \"Escape to Japan\", a guidebook to unconventional travelling in Japan.\n\nIn 2012, he collaborated with Ninagawa Mika and published a photography book called \"Stairway to Heaven\".\n\nIn 2019, he collaborated with Jay Chou (周杰倫) and released a single called Won't Cry (說好不哭).\n\nIn 2006, Ashin and his high school classmate No2good (不二良) were invited by BenQ to create the MusiQ dog tag MP3 player. The development process took 8 months with the help of top designers from China and Taiwan. In 2007, Ashin and No2good designed a symbolic lion figure toy named Jr.Q for BenQ. In the same year, Ashin and No2good unveiled their new clothing line, StayReal, in Taiwan.\n\nAshin's has stated that he's highly influenced by: The Beatles, Lo Ta-yu (羅大佑), Wu Bai(伍佰) and Mr. Children to name a few.

{"id": "1994756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994756", "title": "United States environmental law", "text": "United States environmental law\n\nUnited States environmental law concerns legal standards to protect human health and improve the natural environment of the United States. While subject to criticism at home and abroad on issues of protection, enforcement, and over-regulation, the country remains an important source of environmental legal expertise and experience.\n\nThe United States Congress has enacted federal statutes intended to address pollution control and remediation, including for example the Clean Air Act (air pollution), the Clean Water Act (water pollution), and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or Superfund) (contaminated site cleanup). There are also federal laws governing natural resources use and biodiversity which are strongly influenced by environmental principles, including the Endangered Species Act, National Forest Management Act, and Coastal Zone Management Act. The National Environmental Policy Act, governing environmental impact review in actions undertaken or approved by the U.S. federal government, may implicate all of these areas. \n\nFederalism in the United States has played a role in the shape of national environmental legislation. Many federal environmental laws employ cooperative federalism mechanisms - many federal regulatory programs are administered in coordination with the U.S. states. Furthermore, the states generally have enacted their own laws to cover areas not preempted by federal law. This includes areas where Congress had acted in limited fashion (e.g., state site cleanup laws to handle sites outside Superfund) and where Congress has left regulation primarily to the states (e.g., water resources law).\n\nThe history of environmental law in the US can be traced back to early roots in common law doctrines, for example, the law of nuisance and the public trust doctrine. The first environmental statute was the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, which has been largely superseded by the Clean Water Act (CWA). However, most current major environmental statutes, such as the federal statutes listed above, were passed in the time spanning the late 1960s through the early 1980s. Prior to the passage of these statutes, most federal environmental laws were not nearly as comprehensive. \n\n\"Silent Spring,\" a 1962 book by Rachel Carson, is frequently credited as launching the environmental movement in the United States. The book documented the effects of pesticides, especially DDT, on birds and other wildlife. Among the most significant environmental disasters of the 1960s was the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, which generated considerable public outrage as Congress was considering several major pieces of environmental legislation. (\"See\" Environmental movement in the United States.)\n\nOne lawsuit that has been widely recognized as one of the earliest environmental cases is \"Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission,\" decided in 1965 by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, prior to passage of the major federal environmental statutes. The case helped halt the construction of a power plant on Storm King Mountain in New York State. The case has been described as giving birth to environmental litigation and helping create the legal doctrine of standing to bring environmental claims. The Scenic Hudson case also is said to have helped inspire the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the creation of such environmental advocacy groups as the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nLaws from every stratum of the laws of the United States pertain to environmental issues. Congress has passed a number of landmark environmental regulatory regimes, but many other federal laws are equally important, if less comprehensive. Concurrently, the legislatures of the fifty states have passed innumerable comparable sets of laws. These state and federal systems are foliated with layer upon layer of administrative regulation. Meanwhile, the US judicial system reviews not only the legislative enactments, but also the administrative decisions of the many agencies dealing with environmental issues. Where the statutes and regulations end, the common law begins.\n\nConsistent with the federal statutes that they administer, US federal agencies promulgate regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations that fill out the broad programs enacted by Congress. Primary among these is Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, containing the regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Other important CFR sections include Title 10 (energy), Title 18 (Conservation of Power and Water Resources), Title 21 (Food and Drugs), Title 33 (Navigable Waters), Title 36 (Parks, Forests and Public Property), Title 43 (Public Lands: Interior) and Title 50 (Wildlife and Fisheries).\n\nThe federal and state judiciaries have played an important role in the development of environmental law in the United States, in many cases resolving significant controversy regarding the application of federal environmental laws in favor of environmental interests. The decisions of the Supreme Court in cases such as \"Calvert Cliffs Coordinating Committee v. U.S. Atomic Energy Commission\" (broadly reading the procedural requirements of NEPA), \"Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill\" (broadly reading the Endangered Species Act), and, much more recently, \"Massachusetts v. EPA\" (requiring EPA to reconsider regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act) have had policy impacts far beyond the facts of the particular case.\n\nThe common law of tort is an important tool for the resolution of environmental disputes that fall beyond the confines of regulated activity. Prior to the modern proliferation of environmental regulation, the doctrines of nuisance (public or private), trespass, negligence, and strict liability apportioned harm and assigned liability for activities that today would be considered pollution and likely governed by regulatory regimes. These doctrines remain relevant, and most recently have been used by plaintiffs seeking to impose liability for the consequences of global climate change.\n\nThe common law also continues to play a leading role in American water law, in the doctrines of riparian rights and prior appropriation.\n\nIn the United States, responsibilities for the administration of environmental laws are divided between numerous federal and state agencies with varying, overlapping and sometimes conflicting missions. EPA is the most well-known federal agency, with jurisdiction over many of the country's national air, water and waste and hazardous substance programs. Other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service pursue primarily conservation missions, while still others, such as the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, tend to focus more on beneficial use of natural resources.\n\nFederal agencies operate within the limits of federal jurisdiction. For example, EPA's jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act is limited to \"waters of the United States\". In many cases federal laws allow for more stringent regulation by states, and of transfer of certain federally mandated responsibilities from federal to state control. US state governments, therefore, administering state law adopted under state police powers or federal law by delegation, uniformly include environmental agencies. The extent to which state environmental laws are based on or depart from federal law varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\nThus, while a permit to fill non-federal wetlands might require a permit from a single state agency, larger and more complex endeavors—for example, the construction of a coal-fired power plant—might require approvals from numerous federal and state agencies.\n\nIn the United States, violations of environmental laws are generally civil offenses, resulting in monetary penalties and, perhaps, civil sanctions such as injunction. Many environmental laws also provide for criminal penalties for egregious violations. Some federal laws, such as the Clean Water Act, also allow a U.S. citizen to file a lawsuit against a violator, if the government has failed to take enforcement action.\n\nEnvironmental agencies often include separate enforcement offices, with duties including monitoring permitted activities, performing compliance inspections, issuing citations and prosecuting wrongdoing (civilly or criminally, depending on the violation). EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance is one such agency. Others, such as the United States Park Police, carry out more traditional law enforcement activities.\n\nAdjudicatory proceedings for environmental violations are often handled by the agencies themselves under the structures of administrative law. In some cases, appeals are also handled internally (for example, EPA's Environmental Appeals Board). Generally, final agency determinations may subsequently be appealed to the appropriate court.\n\nEnvironmental law courses are offered as elective courses in the second and third years of JD study at many American law schools. Curricula vary: an introductory course might focus on the \"big five\" federal statutes—NEPA, Clean Air Act, CWA, CERCLA (Superfund) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (or, alternatively, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act)—and may be offered in conjunction with a natural resources law course. Smaller seminars may be offered on more focused topics. Some US law schools also offer an LLM or JSD specialization in environmental law. Additionally, several law schools host legal clinics that focus on environmental law, providing students with an opportunity to learn about environmental law in the context of real world disputes involving actual clients. U.S. News & World Report has consistently ranked Vermont Law School, Lewis & Clark Law School, and Pace University School of Law as the top three Environmental Law programs in the United States, with Lewis & Clark and Vermont frequently trading the top spot.\n\nMany American law schools host student-published law journals. The environmental law reviews at Yale, Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, NYU and Lewis & Clark Law School are regularly the most-cited such publications.\n\nInternational environmental lawyers often receive specialized training in the form of an LL.M. degree at US institutions, after having a first law degreeoften in another country from where they got their first law degree.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1961 he also founded one of the first sleep laboratories in New York City at the Maimonides Medical Center, devoted to the experimental study of dreams and telepathy.\n\nUllman resigned from Maimonides in 1974 and, since then, was engaged in work on dreams and dreaming. He was in the forefront of the movement to stimulate public interest in dreams and to encourage the development of dream sharing groups. Working in a small group setting that he believed to be both safe and effective, Ullman spent the last three decades of his life leading such groups both in the United States and overseas. \n\nUllman was also Clinical Professor of Psychiatry Emeritus at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and was a president of both the Parapsychological Association and of the American Society for Psychical Research.\n\nUllman's dream telepathy experiments have not been independently replicated. James Alcock has written the dream telepathy experiments of Ullman and Stanley Krippner at Maimonides have failed to provide evidence for telepathy and \"lack of replication is rampant.\"\n\nThe picture target experiments that were conducted by Krippner and Ullman, were criticized by C. E. M. Hansel. According to Hansel there were weaknesses in the design of the experiments in the way in which the agent became aware of their target picture. Only the agent should have known the target and no other person until the judging of targets had been completed, however, an experimenter was with the agent when the target envelope was opened. Hansel also wrote there had been poor controls in the experiment as the main experimenter could communicate with the subject. \n\nAn attempt to replicate the experiments that used picture targets was carried out by Edward Belvedere and David Foulkes. The finding was that neither the subject nor the judges matched the targets with dreams above chance level. Results from other experiments by Belvedere and Foulkes were also negative.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a pediatrician and gynecologist by profession.\n\nA notable personality in the Young Poland movement, Boy was the \"enfant terrible\" of the Polish literary scene in the first half of the 20th century. He was murdered in July 1941 by the Germans during the Nazi occupation of Poland, in what became known as the massacre of Lviv professors.\n\nTadeusz Kamil Marcjan Żeleński (of the \"Ciołek\" coat-of-arms) was born on 21 December 1874 in Warsaw, to Wanda, \"née\" Grabowska, who was from a Frankist family, and Władysław Żeleński, a prominent composer and musician. Tadeusz's cousin was the notable Polish neo-romantic poet Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer. Because higher education in Polish was forbidden in Warsaw under Russian rule, in 1892 Żeleński left for Kraków, in Austrian-ruled Galicia, where he enrolled at the Jagiellonian University medical school.\n\nCompleting his studies in 1900, Żeleński began medical practice as a pediatrician. In 1906 he opened a practice as a gynaecologist, which gave him financial freedom. The same year, he co-organised the famous \"Zielony Balonik\" (\"Green Balloon\") cabaret, which gathered notable personalities of Polish culture, including his brother Edward and Jan August Kisielewski, Stanisław Kuczborski, Witold Noskowski, Stanisław Sierosławski, Rudolf Starzewski, Edward Leszczyński, Teofil Trzciński, Karol Frycz, Ludwik Puget, Kazimierz Sichulski, Jan Skotnicki and Feliks Jasieński.\n\nIn the sketches, poems, satirical songs, and short stories that he wrote for \"Zielony Balonik\", Boy-Żeleński criticized and mocked the conservative authorities and the two-faced morality of the city folk, but also the grandiloquent style of \"Młoda Polska\" and Kraków's bohemians. This earned him a reputation as the \"\"enfant terrible\"\" of Polish literature.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I, Żeleński was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army and served as medic to railway troops. After the war, he returned to Poland and, in 1922, moved to Warsaw. He did not return to his medical practice but instead focused entirely on writing.\n\nWorking for various dailies and magazines, Boy-Żeleński soon became one of the authorities of the Polish liberal and democratic intelligentsia. He criticized the two-faced morality of the clergy, promoted the secularization of public life and culture, and was one of the strongest advocates for the equality of women. He was one of the first public figures in Poland to support the women's right to legal abortion. Also, Boy-Żeleński often fought in his essays against the Polish romantic tradition, which he saw as irrational and as seriously distorting the way Polish society thought about its past.\n\nIn addition, Boy translated over 100 classics of French literature, which ever since have been considered among the best translations of foreign literature into Polish. In 1933, Boy-Żeleński was admitted to the prestigious Polish Academy of Literature.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War II, Boy-Żeleński moved to Soviet-occupied Lwów, where he stayed with his wife's brother-in-law. In Lviv, Boy joined the Soviet-led University as the head of the Department of French Literature. Criticized by many for his public and frequent collaboration with the Soviet occupation forces, he maintained contacts with many prominent professors and artists, who found themselves in the city after the Polish Defensive War. He also took part in creating the Communist propaganda newspaper \"Czerwony Sztandar\" (Red Banner) and became one of the prominent members of the Society of Polish Writers.\n\nAfter Nazi Germany broke the German–Soviet treaty and attacked the USSR and the Soviet-held Polish Kresy, Boy remained in Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine). The city was captured on the night of 4 July 1941; he was arrested and taken to the Wulka hills where he was murdered for being \"a Soviet spy\", together with 45 other Polish professors, artists and intelligentsia in what became known as the massacre of Lviv professors.\n\n\n"}

Granulation tissue typically grows from the base of a wound and is able to fill wounds of almost any size. Examples of granulation tissue can be seen in pyogenic granulomas and pulp polyps. Its histological appearance is characterized by proliferation of fibroblasts and new thin-walled, delicate capillaries (angiogenesis), infiltrated inflammatory cells in a loose extracellular matrix. \n\nDuring the migratory phase of wound healing, granulation tissue is:\n\nGranulation tissue is composed of tissue matrix supporting a variety of cell types, most of which can be associated with one of the following functions:\n\nAn excess of granulation tissue (\"caro luxurians\") is informally referred to as \"proud flesh\".\n\nThe extracellular matrix of granulation tissue is created and modified by fibroblasts. Initially, it consists of a network of type-III collagen, a weaker form of the structural protein that can be produced rapidly. This is later replaced by the stronger, long-stranded type-I collagen, as evidenced in scar tissue.\n\nThe main immune cells active in the tissue are macrophages and neutrophils, although other leukocytes are also present. These work to phagocytize old or damaged tissue, and protect the healing tissue from pathogenic infection. This is necessary both to aid the healing process and to protect against invading pathogens, as the wound often does not have an effective skin barrier to act as a first line of defense.\n\nIt is necessary for a network of blood vessels to be established as soon as possible to provide the growing tissue with nutrients, to take away cellular wastes, and transport new leukocytes to the area. Fibroblasts, the main cells that deposit granulation tissue, depend on oxygen to proliferate and lay down the new extracellular matrix.\n\nIn vascularisation, also called angiogenesis, endothelial cells quickly grow into the tissue from older, intact blood vessels. These branch out in a systematic way, forming anastomoses with other vessels.\n"}
{"id": "1994789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994789", "title": "Northern Australia", "text": "Northern Australia\n\nThe unofficial geographic term Northern Australia includes those parts of Queensland and Western Australia north of latitude 26° and all of the Northern Territory. Those local government areas of Western Australia and Queensland that lie partially in the north are included.\n\nAlthough it comprises about half of the total area of Australia, Northern Australia includes only about one quarter of the Australian population. However, it includes several sources of Australian exports, being coal from the Great Dividing Range in Queensland/New South Wales and the natural gas and iron ore of the Pilbara region in WA. It also includes major natural tourist attractions, such as Uluru (Ayers Rock), the Great Barrier Reef and the Kakadu National Park.\n\nAlmost all of Northern Australia is a huge ancient craton that has not experienced geological upheaval since the end of the Precambrian. The only exception to this generalisation is the Wet Tropics of northern Queensland, where active volcanoes have been present as recently as the Pleistocene.\n\nThe vast craton in the north and west contains a number of quite rugged mountain ranges, of which the highest are the MacDonnell and Musgrave Ranges on the southern border of the Northern Territory. These rise to over , but the most spectacular features are the deep gorges of rivers such as the Finke. Most of the craton, however, is distinctly flat and generally low-lying with an average elevation of around , whilst in the Lake Eyre Basin most of the land is not far above sea level.\n\nThe climate of the north of Australia ranges from arid (Köppen BWh) in the south to monsoonal (Köppen Aw) in the Top End and Kimberley. On the eastern coast, however, the climate is much more humid and ranges from humid sub-tropical (Köppen Cfa around Brisbane and Cwa further north) to humid tropical (Köppen Am and Af) in the Wet Tropics. Except in the western part of the Pilbara and Gascoyne where the heaviest rain often occurs from May to July under northwest cloudbands, rainfall is heavily concentrated in the \"summer\" months from November to March. For instance, in Burketown, the months May to September are rainless in over fifty percent of years, with over eighty percent of Augusts having no rain.\n\nTemperatures in summer are generally unpleasantly hot apart from the eastern coastal belt. Maximum temperatures elsewhere between October and April range from in the south in April to around in the inland Pilbara and Kimberley before the wet season breaks. Further north, maxima are consistently around but extreme humidity makes conditions very unpleasant. On the coast, maxima in January range from in the south to , with minima generally around .\n\nIn July, temperatures show a wider range, from in the north to around in the south, where minima can be as low as in Alice Springs in June and July.\n\nThe above generalisations, however, mask the immense variability of the climate throughout the whole region. With the exception of the extreme north of the Northern Territory, rainfall variability throughout Northern Australia is quite markedly higher than most comparable climates in other continents. For example, at Charters Towers, the rainfall over the wet season can vary from less than in 1901/1902 to over in 1973/1974. The chief cause of this very high variability is erratic tropical cyclones, which occur from December to April and in many places can deliver as much as of rain over a day or two, causing extremely large floods in the region's rivers. For example, in April 1898, a tropical cyclone gave in one day at Whim Creek in the Pilbara, but for the whole of 1924 that same station recorded only for the whole year. Tropical cyclones may cross the coast anywhere in Northern Australia but are most frequent between Derby and Onslow on the west side and between Cooktown and Rockhampton on the east. Inland, variability of rainfall is related to the penetration of the summer monsoon, with high rainfall in seasons like 1973/1974, 1975/1976 and from 1998 to 2001 when the monsoon is most powerful.\n\nClimate change has seen increases of up to fifty percent in annual rainfall since 1967 over the western half of Australia's tropics, but has not seen any increase over the east. The increase over the west is sometimes attributed to aerosol pollution over industrialising areas of China and India, but may be related to global warming.\n\nFrosts are common in the southern inland during the winter, but in some years, such as 1998, they are much less frequent due to the recent incidence of warm pools in the Indian Ocean.\n\nExcept in the Lake Eyre Basin and adjacent areas to the east, the soils of Northern Australia are quite remarkable in global terms for their low fertility and difficulty of working. Most of them consist chiefly of hard laterite developed during period of climate much more humid than even that of Darwin today. Since there has been no mountain building in the region since the Precambrian and no glaciation since the Carboniferous, the region's soils have generally been under continuous weathering without renewal for over \"250 million years\", as against less than ten thousand for most soils in Europe, Asia, North America and New Zealand which have been formed from recent mountain building or glacial scouring of the land.\n\nThis immensely long weathering time means that nutrient levels in Northern Australian soils are exceptionally low because practically all soluble minerals have long been weathered out. The major constituents of most soils in Northern Australia are iron and aluminium oxides, both of which are not only very insoluble but also serve to reduce the soil pH and remove phosphorus from the soil as insoluble iron and aluminium phosphates. The insolubility of these metal oxides also serves, under the extremely harsh conditions during the dry season in the north and generally in the south, to create massive sheets which are impossible to plough.\n\nIn the Lake Eyre Basin, deposition from volcanic regions to the east has produce cracking clay soils of quite high fertility which are still often fairly low in phosphorus but have very good levels of potassium, calcium and sulfur. These soils provide the best grassland for grazing in the region. The youthful, volcanic Wet Tropics has a number of areas of fertile alluvial soils that support intensive horticulture.\n\nThe extreme soil poverty of most of Northern Australia has the effect of confining large herbivores such as the kangaroo to the better soil in the dry grasslands since they cannot digest the extreme poor fodder from the northern monsoonal regions. However, the frequency of fires during the desiccating dry season from May to September means that forests cannot establish themselves except in sheltered places. This has created a unique type of tropical savanna environment in which fires play a crucial role in elevating the extremely low nutrient levels and aiding growth during the wet season.\n\nThe many large rivers of the region such as the Mitchell, Gilbert-Einasleigh, South and East Alligator, Daly, Ord and Fitzroy support populations of the saltwater and freshwater crocodiles, which are by far the best-known animals of the region. There are also a number of species of python. Further south, where rivers are not adequate to support crocodiles, there exist a number of quite unique lizard species.\n\nThe Wet Tropics, like all tropical rainforests, is very rich in unique species, and importantly contains some of the most primitive flowering plants in the world.\n\nNorthern Australia is considered to be the poorest part of the country. The erratic climate and extreme soil poverty have defied all attempts to develop large-scale agriculture in any part of Northern Australia apart from the Wet Tropics, where sugar cane and banana growing is a major industry, and the Lake Eyre Basin and surrounding areas where the dominant activity is rearing of sheep and beef cattle on extremely large properties. Despite the relatively fertile soils, land values owing to the extremely variable climate are very low. Beef cattle are raised elsewhere in the Northern Territory and Kimberley, but the quality of meat is very low because animals are slaughtered at quite an old age compared to cattle elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe geological factors that make Northern Australia's soils so unsuited to traditional agriculture, however, make it extremely rich in ores of abundant, insoluble lithophile metals such as aluminium, iron and uranium. It has the world's largest deposits of all these metals, and as less reactive chalcophile metals have been depleted Northern Australia has become very important to the economies of mineral-poor Asian nations. It was Northern Australian iron ore that fed the Japanese post-war economic miracle and the Four Tigers of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, the government of Robert Menzies attempted to develop farming in Northern Australia, but pests made this impossible even when varieties of rice suited to the soils were developed. Today, however, sugar cane growing has expanded into the Ord River basin without surpassing cattle and tourism as the main industries of the region.\n\nProponents for the development of Northern Australia have been found since before Federation and include:\n\n\nThe latest iteration of these proposals is found in the \"Our North Our Future: White Paper On Developing Northern Australia\" published by the Abbott Government on 18 June 2015.\n\n"}

The scale height remains constant for a particular temperature. It can be calculated by\n\nor equivalently\n\nwhere:\n\n\nThe pressure (force per unit area) at a given altitude is a result of the weight of the overlying atmosphere. If at a height of \"z\" the atmosphere has density \"ρ\" and pressure \"P\", then moving upwards at an infinitesimally small height \"dz\" will decrease the pressure by amount \"dP\", equal to the weight of a layer of atmosphere of thickness \"dz\".\n\nThus:\n\nwhere \"g\" is the acceleration due to gravity. For small \"dz\" it is possible to assume \"g\" to be constant; the minus sign indicates that as the height increases the pressure decreases.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nCulion consists primarily of Culion Island as well as 41 minor surrounding islands, as part of the Calamian group of islands.\n\nIt was a former leprosarium, starting in 1906 under the American colonial regime until the American commonwealth of the Philippines era. Although leprosy on the island-town was abolished in the 1980s, it was only in 2006 when it was declared a leprosy-free area by the World Health Organization. The municipality was created by virtue of \"Republic Act No. 7193\" on February 19, 1992. In May 2017, the Philippine National Commission for UNESCO began its initiative to prepare the dossier of Culion's leprosy documentary heritage, which will be nominated in the future in the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme. In May 2018, the \"Culion Museum and Archives\" was officially nominated by the Philippines in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register – Asia and the Pacific.. In June 18, 2018, \"Culion Leprosy Archives\" was officially inscribed to the Memory of the World Register – Asia and the Pacific. The government and the Asia-Pacific bloc aims to nominate the archives further to the International Memory of the World Register. If approved by UNESCO, it will be the fifth internationally recognized documentary heritage of the Philippines, increasing Culion town's feasibility to become a world heritage site in the future.\n\nCulion is an island situated at the northernmost part of Palawan. It is part of the Calamian Archipelago in northern Palawan that also includes the municipalities of Busuanga, Coron, and Linapacan. During the Spanish Period, these were known as \"Las Islas de Calamianes, Provincia de España\".\n\nThe municipality has a land area of which includes the 41 surrounding islands and measures a total of including its territorial water. Its largest island, Culion Island, has an area of . It is bounded on the north by Busuanga Island, on the east by the Coron Reef, on the south by Linapacan Island, and on the west by the South China Sea.\n\nThe Culion sea is teeming with a total of 201 fish species including commercially important fish like Lapu-lapu (Groupers), Kanuping (Sweetlip Emperor), Maya-Maya (Snapper), Tanguige (Spanish Mackerel), Dalagang Bukid (Blue and Gold Fusiliers) and Bisugo (Breams). Squid, cuttlefish, shrimps, crabs, shellfish and sea cucumber or trepang are plentiful.\n\nThree ecosystems sustain the rich marine life of Culion: mangroves, seagrass, and corals. 17 mangrove species cover the coastline of Culion. 9 seagrass species and 47 coral genera representing 60% of the total genera found in the Philippines are found in Culion.\n\nCulion is politically subdivided into 14 barangays:\n\nAside from churches, the Spaniards built defensive fortifications in strategic places in Taytay, Cuyo, Agutaya, Linapacan, including a watch tower and fort in the locality of Libis in Culion.\n\nIn 1858, Calamianes was divided into 2 provinces, “Castilla” and “Asturias”. Castilla, which included northern Palawan, retained its capital of Taytay. Asturias extended south to Balabac. In 1873, the capital of Palawan was changed from Taytay to Cuyo. The French anthropologist Alfred Marche traveled the Philippines and documented his research of many places. French Ambassador Pirre Revol in particular translated Marche’s account of the Calamianes, and Culion.\n\nMarche refers to Culion as the principal village of the Calamianes. The fact that a boat from Manila “touches Culion once a month” attests to the growing economy of the place at that time. Marche’s description of the place and people he met in the 1880s are important indicators of the ethnography of Calamianes since more than a hundred years ago.\n\nThe primacy of Culion as a leading settlement community of the Calamianes is further supported by the fact that a Justice of the peace resided and held office in Culion. Claudio Sandoval y Rodriguez a Spanish mestizo from Jaro, Iloilo married Evarista Manlavi daughter of a rich landowner from Cuyo. Claudio Sandoval became Jezgado de Paz de Culion, Calamianes and held office sometime in the late 1880s. The seal of Claudio’s office was found stamped on handwritten circular dated December 11, 1889 that he sent to all within Culion’s “roriedad y sus visitas” warning residents of the penalties that will be imposed on them should they be caught gambling. Culion’s “visitas” included the island of Busuanga and other areas in Calamianes.\n\nA remnant of the fort in San Pedro located somewhere in Burabud is a testimony of a rich history of Culion. In the early 1990s, it was thought that this fort was already invaded by the roots of balete trees. This was built by the Spanish friars (Agustinian Recollects)and is older than the one we now see in Culion proper, the Immaculate Conception Church built by the Jesuits. This fort in San Pedro was more or less built on the same span of date as that in Agutaya, Taytay and Cuyo which forts found in these towns still stand today preserved by the Palawan government.\n\nWhen the treaty of Paris was signed on December 10, 1898, wherein Spain sold the Philippines to the United States for 20 million dollars, the funding of Culion as a reservation is closely related to the early efforts of the Americans to establish some form of public health policy in the Philippines as part of their long-term intentions to occupy the archipelago.\n\nOne of the motivating factors for the creation of the Manila Board of Health was traditional belief that the maintenance of public health required the isolation of cases of leprosy from the rest of the public. After an investigation of a number of sites, the island of Culion was selected as a segregation colony in 1901. On October 27, 1902 the Second Philippine Commission appropriated an initial $50,000 for the establishment of Culion under the Secretary of Interior Dean C. Worcester and Director of Health Victor G. Heiser. On August 22, 1904, Luke E. Wright, the American Civil Governor of the Government of the Philippine Islands, Executive Order No. 35 signed the transfer of jurisdiction and control of Culion from the Municipality of Coron, reserving the same as a leper colony and a government stock farm.\n\n\n\nIn the , the population of Culion was people, with a density of .\n\nThe original people of Culion are the Tagbanuas, a cultural minority group that lives by fishing and food gathering. While preserving their native customs and traditions, the Tagbanuas are greatly influenced by Muslim culture and social organization.\n\nEarly trading activities attracted people from other parts of Palawan, like Calamianen and Cuyonon, who came and stayed in Culion as their new home.\n\nToday, however, the Tagbanuas no longer practice many of their cultural traditions and many of them have been converted to Christianity.

Coleman was named the rookie of the year in 1949 by Associated Press, and was an All-Star in 1950 and later that year was named the World Series Most Valuable Player. Yankees teams on which he was a player appeared in six World Series during his career, winning four times. Coleman served as a Marine Corps pilot in World War II and the Korean War, flying combat missions with the VMSB-341 Torrid Turtles (WWII) and VMA-323 Death Rattlers (Korea) in both wars. He later became a broadcaster, and he was honored in 2005 by the National Baseball Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick Award for his broadcasting contributions.\n\nBorn in San Jose, California, Coleman graduated from Lowell High School, then spent his entire playing career with the New York Yankees. He played six years in the Yankees' minor league system before reaching the big club in 1949. Coleman hit .275 in his first year and led all second basemen in fielding percentage. He was the Associated Press' rookie of the year in 1949, and finishing third in balloting by Baseball Writers Association of America.\n\nColeman avoided a sophomore slump by earning a selection to the All-Star team in 1950. He then shone in the World Series with brilliant defense, earning him the BBWAA's Babe Ruth Award as the series's most valuable player.\n\nNicknamed \"The Colonel\" because he was a U.S. Marine Corps lieutenant colonel, Coleman was a Marine aviator who postponed his entry into professional baseball in World War II and later left baseball to serve in the Korean War. While a Marine Corps aviator he flew 120 combat missions (57 during World War II and 63 in Korea). and received numerous honors and medals including two Distinguished Flying Crosses. In recent years, Coleman has received numerous honors, including induction into the USMC Sports Hall of Fame, for his call to duty. Coleman was the only Major League Baseball player to see combat in two wars. (While Ted Williams served during both World War II and Korea, he flew combat missions only in the Korean War.) \n\nColeman's career declined after he was injured the following season, relegating him to a bench role. He was forced to retire after the 1957 season, but he left on a good note, hitting .364 in a World Series loss against the Milwaukee Braves. He appeared in the World Series six times in his career, winning four of them.\n\nColeman appeared on the February 5, 1957 of the CBS game show \"To Tell the Truth\" as an imposter for singer Don Rondo. He received two votes.\n\nIn 1958, New York Yankees general manager George Weiss named Coleman personnel director, which involved Coleman scouting minor league players. Roy Hamey terminated Coleman from that position, upon becoming the Yankees' general manager. It was only after Coleman met with Howard Cosell that Coleman considered becoming a broadcaster.\n\nIn 1960, Coleman began a broadcasting career with CBS television, conducting pregame interviews on the network's \"Game of the Week\" broadcasts. His broadcasting career nearly ended that year; he was in the midst of an interview with Cookie Lavagetto when the national anthem began playing. Coleman kept the interview going through the anthem, prompting an avalanche of angry letters to CBS.\n\nIn 1963, he began a seven-year run calling Yankees' games on WCBS radio and WPIX television. Coleman's WPIX call of ex-teammate Mickey Mantle's 500th career home run in 1967 was brief and from the heart:\n\nHere's the payoff pitch ... This is it! There it goes! It's outta here!\n\nDuring his time broadcasting with the Yankees he lived in Ridgewood, New Jersey, which he described as being \"19.9 miles from Yankee Stadium, but a million miles from New York\".\n\nAfter broadcasting for the California Angels for two years, in 1972 Coleman became the lead radio announcer for the San Diego Padres, a position he held every year until his death in 2014 except for 1980, when the Padres hired him to manage (predating a trend of broadcasters-turned-managers that started in the late 1990s). He was known in San Diego for his signature catchphrase, \"You can hang a star on that one, baby!\", which he would deliver after a spectacular play. During home games, the phrase would be accompanied by a tinsel star swinging from a fishing pole that emanated from his broadcast booth. Coleman's other catchphrases included \"Oh Doctor!\", \"And the beat goes on,\" and \"The natives are getting restless.\"\n\nColeman lent this catchphrases to great use when the Padres defeated the Chicago Cubs in Game 5 of the 1984 National League Championship Series to clinch the pennant and their first ever trip to the World Series.\n\nHere's the Goose...the 1-1 pitch. A one hopper to Nettles, to Wiggins...and the Padres have the National League pennant!!! Oh doctor, you can hang a star on that baby!!!\n\nHe also called national regular-season and postseason broadcasts for CBS Radio from the mid-1970s to 1997.\n\nDuring an interview in the height of the steroids scandal in 2005, Coleman stated, \"If I'm emperor, the first time 50 games, the second time 100 games and the third strike you're out\", referring to how baseball should suspend players for being caught taking steroids. After the 2005 World Series, Major League Baseball put a similar policy in effect.\n\nColeman was known as the \"Master of the Malaprop\" for making sometimes embarrassing mistakes on the microphone, but he was nonetheless popular. In 2005, he was given the Ford C. Frick Award of the National Baseball Hall of Fame for broadcasting excellence, and is one of five Frick award winners who also played in the Major Leagues (the others are Joe Garagiola, Tony Kubek, Tim McCarver and Bob Uecker).\n\nHe was inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame in 2001. In fall 2007, Coleman was inducted to the National Radio Hall of Fame as a sports broadcaster for his years as the play-by-play voice of the San Diego Padres.\n\nTed Leitner and Andy Masur replaced Coleman for most of the radio broadcasting efforts for each Padres game. He did, however, still work middle innings as a color analyst. As of the 2010 season, he reduced his broadcast schedule down to 20–30 home day games. , Coleman was the third-oldest active play-by-play announcer, behind only fellow Hall of Famers Felo Ramirez and Ralph Kiner.\n\nColeman collaborated on his autobiography with longtime \"New York Times\" writer Richard Goldstein; their book \"\" was published in 2008. On September 15, 2012, the Padres unveiled a Jerry Coleman statue at Petco Park. Coleman's statue is the second statue at Petco Park, the other being of Hall of Fame outfielder Tony Gwynn.\n\nColeman was the recipient of the following medals:\n\nIn 2011, Coleman was inducted into the International Aerospace Hall of Fame in a ceremony at the San Diego Air & Space Museum for his service as a combat pilot in World War II and the Korean War. Although several Major League ballplayers flew during WWII, he was the only active member of MLB to do the deed twice, forgoing his career to fly in combat in both wars. The SDASM restored a vintage F4U \"Corsair\" fighter-bomber in the markings of Coleman's aircraft during the Korean War and it is displayed under their SBD \"Dauntless\" dive bomber (which Coleman flew in combat during WW2).\n\nColeman's death was reported by the San Diego Padres on January 5, 2014. He died after being hospitalized after a fall in his home. He was 89. Coleman was interred at Miramar National Cemetery after a private funeral.\n\nIn 2015, a sports facility at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego was named in honor of Coleman.\n\n"}

{"id": "1994810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994810", "title": "Teräsbetoni", "text": "Teräsbetoni\n\nTeräsbetoni is a Finnish power metal band. Their first album, \"Metallitotuus\" was released in 2005 and has so far sold more than 32,000 copies. Teräsbetoni has been strongly influenced by bands such as Manowar. The direct translation of the band's name is \"steel concrete\", Finnish for reinforced concrete.\n\nThe music of Teräsbetoni has a martial air to it, with lyrics glorifying a pagan warrior lifestyle and a \"brotherhood of metal\". The style has received mixed reception. Band members themselves have said that they are not dead serious about the band's mentality and are having fun with it. The most famous songs of the band include \"Taivas lyö tulta\", \"Vaadimme metallia\", \"Voittamaton\" and their Eurovision entry \"Missä miehet ratsastaa\".\n\nThe group announced the interruption of activities in August 2011, and it has remained in hiatus until 2015.\n\nJarkko Ahola, Arto Järvinen, and Viljo Rantanen met each other in 2002 and decided to form a band. Jari Kuokkanen joined as a part-time drummer, and later became an official member. Rantanen was the one to come up with the name Teräsbetoni. Teräsbetoni made its first songs in 2003. They were published on the band's homepage in the summer of 2003 and were called \"Teräsbetoni\", \"Teräksen varjo\" (trans. The Shadow of Steel), and \"Maljanne nostakaa\" (trans. Raise Your Toast).\n\nThe band started to get popular in underground circles and soon the knowledge of the band's existence spread wider. Excited fans circulated a petition, demanding a recording contract for Teräsbetoni, and sent it to several record companies. In 2004, Teräsbetoni performed their first concert and a live version of \"Taivas lyö tulta\" (trans. The sky strikes down fire) was added to the band's homepage. In their first concerts they used to play a cover versions of Ronnie James Dio's \"Rainbow in the Dark\" and Manowar's \"Metal Warriors\". In late 2004 the band signed a recording contract with Warner Music Finland and the recording for the \"Taivas lyö tulta\" single started in December 2004. The single was released on 2 February 2005. During its first week on the Finnish single list it rose to the top, followed by plentiful radio time and the band becoming more widely known.\n\nThe recordings for the \"Metallitotuus\" album started in January 2005 and the album was released on 6 April 2005. During its first week on the Finnish list, it placed 2nd and stood on the list for 29 weeks. Another single from the album was \"Orjatar\" (trans. Slave Woman). A music video was also made of this song and it was shown for the first time on the TOP40 show, on 16 April 2005. Taivas lyö tulta was later chosen to be the goal song for the Finnish ice hockey national team A in the Karjala Cup tournament.\n\n\"Metallitotuus\" went platinum (in Finland, that means over 30,000 copies have been sold) in the year it was published, with almost 33,000 copies sold, becoming the third most popular heavy rock album in Finland that year. In June 2006 the band's second album, \"Vaadimme metallia\" (trans. We Demand Metal), was released. On the day of its release, it nearly broke the gold album line (which in Finland is 15,000 albums sold).\n\nThere has been a lot of interest of Teräsbetoni in countries outside Finland, and the band is also very interested in playing outside Finland; so far they have done so only once, at Wacken Open Air 2005. Teräsbetoni competed in the Finnish national preselection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. On 1 March they won the nomination with a total of 38.9% of the final votes cast. They represented Finland with their song \"Missä miehet ratsastaa\". The band was voted as one of the finalists on 20 May. In the finals on 24 May the entry placed 22nd with 35 points. In the semi-final band placed 8th with 79 points.\n\nOn 19 March 2008 Teräsbetoni released their third album, Myrskyntuoja, which entered the Finnish album chart at position 1. In 2010 a fourth studio album was released, \"Maailma Tarvitsee Sankareita\".\n\nIn the year following the release of their fourth studio album, the group announced that they would cease band activity. They made it clear that they were not breaking up, but rather taking a break. They did play a show to celebrate their 10-year anniversary on 7 July 2013. They played in Turku, honoring the city that hosted many of their earliest shows. They announced the continuation of the break following the event.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1994813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994813", "title": "Kiss (Prince song)", "text": "Kiss (Prince song)\n\n\"Kiss\" is a song composed, written, and produced by American musician Prince. Released by the Paisley Park label as the lead single from Prince and The Revolution's eighth studio album \"Parade\" (1986) on February 5, 1986, it was a No. 1 hit worldwide, holding the top spot of the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart for two weeks. The single was certified Gold in 1986 for sales of 1 million copies by the RIAA.\n\nThe song was ranked at No. 464 on the \"Rolling Stone\" list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. \"NME\" ranked the song at No. 4 in their list of The 150 Greatest Singles of All Time, and voted \"Kiss\" the best single of 1986.\n\nFollowing Prince's death in April 2016, the song re-charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at No. 28 and jumped to No. 23 a week later. The song also reached No. 2 on the French Singles Chart. As of April 30, 2016, it has sold 1.33 million copies in the U.S.\n\nAge of Chance and Art of Noise also released versions of the song that were critical and chart successes.\n\n\"Kiss\" started as an acoustic demo, with melody, lyrics, and basic song structure written by Prince. He gave his demo to the funk band Mazarati for their debut album, and they worked on it with producer David Z. In the end, Prince decided to finish the song, retaining David Z's unique, funky rhythm and background vocal arrangement, along with Mazarati's background vocals; he removed the bass line, and added signature guitar and falsetto vocal elements. The final, minimalist song was a hard sell to Warner Bros., but upon Prince's insistence the song was released and added to \"Parade\".\n\nDespite Warner Bros. not wanting to release it as a single, \"Kiss\" became Prince's third number-one US hit following 1984's highly successful \"When Doves Cry\" and \"Let's Go Crazy\". It was also a big hit across the Atlantic, reaching number 6 on the UK Singles Chart. The song won Prince another 29th Annual Grammy Awards for Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, and was nominated for Grammy Award for Best R&B Song. The song became a staple at Prince's concerts and was usually sung partially by the audience.\n\nThe 12\" single of the song is an extension of the album track. The extended section is based on the funky guitar line and contains much fuller instrumentation than the main track, including bass guitar, organ and horns. New lyrics are present from Prince, along with Jill Jones, that end with a humorous dialogue between a wife and her husband watching Prince on television. The B-side of \"Kiss\" was \"♥ or $\" (\"Love or Money\"), sung in a processed, higher-pitched vocal, which Prince would later use for his \"Camille\" material. The song relates to the theme in \"Under the Cherry Moon\", and a bit of the song was heard in the film, as was a bit of the extended version of \"Kiss\". The extended \"Kiss\" was included on 2006's \"Ultimate\"; \"♥ or $\" was recently re-released as a digital B-side on iTunes.\n\nThe song is written in the key of A major and has a tempo of 112 beats per minute in common time.\n\nThe music video was directed by Rebecca Blake. In the plot of the video, Prince appears in a half shirt and leather jacket and then all shirtless and performs dance choreography in a hall. The trousers he wears are strip-off pants. He is accompanied by the veiled dancer Monique Mannen wearing black lingerie and sunglasses while Revolution member Wendy Melvoin sits playing guitar.\n\n7\" single\n\n12\" single\n\nCD single\n\nDigital Download\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1994814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994814", "title": "Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Episode Zero", "text": "Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Episode Zero\n\n, released in the United States as Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Episode Zero, is a manga miniseries based on the anime series \"Mobile Suit Gundam Wing\", featuring stories set mostly before the events of that tale. Unlike other \"Gundam Wing\" manga, which are not necessarily considered as being in continuity, \"Episode Zero\" has the distinction of being written by Katsuyuki Sumizawa, who was also the writer of the anime series, and thus carries a higher level of credibility. Akira Kanbe handled the art duties for this project.\n\n\"Episode Zero\" can technically be considered canon, since it was originally going to be included in the \"Gundam Wing\" television series. Director Masashi Ikeda specifically asked Sumizawa to pen the main characters' backstories, and they were to be included in the series following episode 27 (\"The Locus Of Victory And Defeat\"). However, due to production scheduling being the \"worst ever\" (in Sumizawa's own words) and his withdrawing as a scenery director, \"Episode Zero\"'s tale kept being delayed and pushed back. Though it was later intended to play some role in episode 31 (\"The Glass Kingdom\"), the problems persisted, and the \"Episode Zero\" story ended up being left out of the anime series entirely.\n\n\"Episode Zero\" reveals a generous amount of information regarding what led the five protagonists of the series to become Gundam pilots, and what occurrences shaped some of the traits they are best known for. It also features notable information on certain other key characters and events that composed the \"Gundam Wing\" story.\n\nOne of the most prominent tales is told within Issues 2 and 3, in which it's discovered that a younger Heero once fought alongside Odin Lowe—the man who, years earlier, was responsible for the assassination of the colonial leader Heero Yuy.\n\nA battlefield assault by Heero later on in the tale puts Treize in the hospital, where he would be tended to by Leia Barton—the future mother of his child (who would become the main antagonist of the \"\" story that takes place years later).\n\nThe stories involving Trowa and Wufei are, unexpectedly enough, romantic tragedies, as each meet young women who will have significant impacts on their lives. Trowa's story also implies that Catherine Bloom, the circus performer he meets during the series, is in fact his long-lost older sister, who he was separated from as an infant during an attack by the Alliance which presumably killed their parents, and that Trowa's real name is actually Triton Bloom.\n\nThe focus is more on origin in the cases of Duo and Quatre. \"Duo Maxwell\" is revealed to not be Duo's given name; instead, \"Duo\" was taken by the young orphan in memory of a childhood friend named Solo, who died from a severe illness, and \"Maxwell\" was taken afterwards from a kind priest named Father Maxwell, who, along with a nun named Sister Helen, ran an orphanage out of the Maxwell Church. Sister Helen and Father Maxwell played a large role in the childhood of Duo, acting in parental roles until they (and the entire orphanage) were made casualties of an Alliance attack on rebels within the church (which was later known as the Maxwell Church Massacre), despite young Duo's best efforts to keep his new family alive.\n\nQuatre, in contrast, has possibly the least tragic past out of all the pilots. Contrary to what he believes, he is not, in fact, the product of test-tube reproduction (his 29 elder sisters, however, are). His mother, Katherine, died in childbirth due to complications from living in space affecting the body's ability to give birth safely. As he refers to himself as a test-tube child in the series, it can be assumed his father and sisters never told him about his mother.\n\nThe histories of the two surviving Peacecraft family members, Relena and Zechs Merquise, are unveiled as well. As the Sanq Kingdom fell, only two members of the royal family survived: the children, Zechs and Relena. Relena was adopted by the Darlian family and raised as their own. The story implies that Relena and Zechs met prior to the series, which is how Zechs knew that his little sister was still alive (although she did not know him, having not been told about her true identity until the series). Also appearing in the story is a young boy who briefly attends Relena's school (apparently on an undercover mission) and greatly resembles Heero.\n\nThe manga also features undetailed cameos from notable characters in the series, such as Lucrezia Noin (in Heero's story) and Sally Po (in Wufei's story).\n\nToward the end, the five heroes gather for a brief new mission that is set after \"Endless Waltz\", an event which ends in a cliffhanger but with a promising connotation. The work concludes with an affectionate parting message from writer Sumizawa himself to the fans of \"Gundam Wing\".\n"}

Plans for a third film were abandoned following the poor box office reception of the second film.\n\nCushing made no mention of the films in his autobiography, although he kept a collection of newspaper clippings about them in a scrapbook.\n\nWhereas the contemporary television incarnation of the character was depicted as an abrasive, patronising and cantankerous extraterrestrial, as portrayed by Cushing Dr. Who is an eccentric inventor who claims to have created a time machine, named Tardis, in his back garden. He is a gentle, grandfatherly figure, naturally curious, sometimes absent-minded but not afraid to fight for justice. He is shown to have a keen and somewhat juvenile sense of humour, a strong sense of adventure, a will of iron and very strong morals.\n\nUnlike his TV counterpart, for whom the character's name is ambiguous, his surname is clearly stated to be \"Who\" in both films.\n\nIn the first film, Dr. Who travels with his two granddaughters: Susan (Roberta Tovey), who is portrayed as a younger character than the Susan depicted in the TV series, and Barbara (Jennie Linden). They are joined by Ian Chesterton (Roy Castle), Barbara's \"new boyfriend\", who is depicted as a generally clumsy and comical figure (whereas the TV version of the character is more heroic, and his relationship with Barbara is amicable and professional rather than romantic).\n\nIn the , Susan is joined by Dr. Who's niece Louise (Jill Curzon) and police constable Tom Campbell (Bernard Cribbins).\n\nThe exterior of Dr. Who's \"Tardis\" (not \"\"the\" TARDIS\", as referred to in the television series) resembles a British police box, although the films, unlike the TV series, offer no explanation as to why the machine has this appearance. Other than using the contrivance of the craft's interior being larger than its exterior, the interior set bears no relation to the clean, high-tech TV version of the time. In the first film it is filled with a chaotic jumble of wiring and electronic equipment, replaced in the second film by a number of simple consoles adorned with buttons, gauges and lights.\n\nIn addition to the two films, Dr. Who has appeared in a Dell comic strip adaptation of the film, the comic strip \"Daleks versus the Martians\" in the 1996 \"Spring Special\" of \"Doctor Who Magazine\", and the short story \"The House on Oldark Moor\" by Justin Richards, published in the BBC Books collection \"Short Trips and Sidesteps\".\n\nHe is referenced in Steven Moffat’s novelisation of The Day of the Doctor. In this story, the tenth and eleventh Doctors are stated to be fans of the Dalek movies and friends of Cushing. This was brought to the attention of UNIT when he started to show up in films made after his death.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, there were plans for a radio series starring Peter Cushing as the voice of Dr. Who. Under a collaboration between Stanmark Productions and Watermill Productions, a pilot was recorded and a further 52 episodes were to be produced. The pilot story (entitled \"Journey into Time\") featured Dr. Who and his granddaughter travelling to the time of the American Revolution. The script was written by future \"Doctor Who\" TV series writer Malcolm Hulke. The recording was subsequently lost.\n"}

{"id": "1994831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994831", "title": "Primark", "text": "Primark\n\nPrimark () is an Irish fast fashion retailer with headquarters in Dublin, Ireland, which is a subsidiary of food processing and retail company ABF. The company is named Penneys in Republic of Ireland, where it started; this name is not used internationally, as it is owned elsewhere by American retailer J. C. Penney. The company has operations in Europe and the United States.\n\nThe company's first store, still in operation, was founded by Arthur Ryan on behalf of the Weston family (who had founded Associated British Foods in 1935) in June 1969 on 47 Mary Street, Dublin.\n\nSuccess in Ireland led to expansion to the United Kingdom, and Penneys opened a large store in Belfast City Centre in 1971 and a Primark store in Derby, England, in 1973. The company could not use the name \"Penneys\" in Europe outside Ireland as it was registered by J. C. Penney. The name \"Primark\" was then invented to use outside Ireland.\n\nPrimark opened its current headquarters in 2015 in a redeveloped Dublin building, Arthur Ryan House, formerly Chapel House.\n\nOn 28 August 2018, a fire started on the roof of a Primark store in Belfast as it came towards the end of a major redevelopment, destroying the building and emitting plumes of thick, black smoke over the city. The building was a former bank with historical value that had been renovated previously. A new Primark store was built on the same site, and opened on 8 December 2018.\n\nPrimark offers a diverse range of products, including baby and children's clothing, womenswear, menswear, homeware, accessories, footwear, beauty products and confectionery.\n\nFrom 2014, Primark sells makeup products at prices starting at £1. Primark starting selling vegan snacks as of January 2018. The company sells clothes at prices below those typically charged.\n\nAlong with retailers such as Zara and H&M, Primark contributes to the contemporary fast fashion trend. According to an article about Primark in \"The Economist\", \"For many shoppers, Primark has an irresistible offer: trendy clothes at astonishingly low prices. The result is a new and even faster kind of fast fashion, which encourages consumers to buy heaps of items, discard them after a few wears and then come back for another batch of new outfits.\"\n\nPrimark owns over 370 stores across 12 countries. The largest Primark store opened in Birmingham on 11 April 2019, occupying the former Pavilions Shopping Centre of 161,000 sqft. The company expanded rapidly in the UK in the mid-2000s. In 2005, it bought the Littlewoods retail stores for £409m, retaining 40 of the 119 stores and selling the rest. In May 2006, the first Primark store outside Ireland and the United Kingdom opened in Madrid, Spain. After 10 years of constructing a chain of around 40 stores in Spain, Primark opened another store in Madrid in October 2015, the second biggest in the chain. In December 2008, Primark opened in the Netherlands, followed by Portugal, Germany and Belgium in 2009. Primark opened its first store in Austria on 27 September 2012, in Innsbruck. It expanded to France in 2013, in Marseille. The first Italian store opened in 2014. In 2015, Primark opened its first United States store in Downtown Crossing, Boston, in the location that was once the flagship store of Filene's, later New York City, Philadelphia, and Danbury. In July 2018, it was revealed that Primark was entering Poland. On 13 June 2019 Primark expanded to Slovenia with a store in Ljubljana. It has signed a lease for its first stores in Warsaw, Poland, Prague, Czech Republic and Bratislava, Slovakia.\n\nIn July 2019, Primark announced its U.S. market expansion to Chicago with a three-level 45,000 square foot flagship location on State Street. The location is scheduled to open in 2020 and will be its first store in the Midwest.\n\nOn 23 March 2020, the company announced that they would be closing their 189 UK stores until further notice, as demand dropped as a result of social distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nIn 2006, Primark joined the Ethical Trading Initiative, a collaborative organisation bringing together businesses, trades unions and NGOs to work on labour rights issues in their supply chains. ETI members commit to working towards the implementation of a code of conduct based on the International Labour Organization's core conventions.\n\nIn December 2008, the UK charity War on Want launched a new report, Fashion Victims II, that showed conditions had not improved in Bangladeshi factories supplying Primark, two years after the charity first visited them.\n\nOn 9 January 2009, a supplier was forced by ETI to remove its branding from Primark stores and websites following a BBC/\"The Observer\" investigation into the employment practices. The investigation alleged use of illegal immigrant labour and argued that the workers were paid less than the UK legal minimum wage.\n\nOn 16 June 2011, the BBC Trust's Editorial Standards Committee (ESC) published its findings into a \"Panorama\" programme 'Primark: On the Rack', broadcast in June 2008. The programme was an undercover investigative documentary examining poor working conditions in Indian factories supplying Primark. Although Primark subsequently stopped doing business with the Indian supplier, the ESC concluded that footage in the programme was 'more likely than not' to have been fabricated. The ESC directed the BBC to make an on-air apology and to ensure that the programme was not repeated or sold to other broadcasters. Primark created a specific website to deal with the issues around the programme.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, Primark achieved ‘Leader’ status in the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI).\n\nOn 24 April 2013, the eight-story \"Rana Plaza\" commercial building collapsed in Savar, a sub-district near Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. At least 1,127 people died and over 2,438 were injured. The factory housed a number of separate garment factories employing around 5,000 people, several shops, and a bank. The day before the building collapsed, other businesses had closed but garment factory owners pressurized employees to report for work. Clothing labels from Mango and Primark were found amongst the dead, . Apparel for other brands were also manufactured at the site including the Benetton Group, Joe Fresh, The Children's Place, Primark, Monsoon, and DressBarn Primark paid compensation and emergency aid to the victims of the collapse, a move which was welcomed by Oxfam, and committed to review the structural integrity of buildings making its clothes.\n\nOf the 29 brands identified as having sourced products from the Rana Plaza factories, only nine attended meetings held in November 2013 to agree a proposal on compensation to the victims. Several companies refused to sign, including Walmart, Carrefour, Mango, Auchan and Kik. The agreement was signed by Primark, Loblaw, Bonmarché and El Corte Inglés.\n\nIn June 2013, two labels both stitched with SOS messages were separately found in garments purchased from a store in Swansea, Wales. Primark argued the supply chain showed these label messages were a hoax.\n\nAlso in June 2014, a customer from Ireland found an SOS note wrapped in a prison ID card in the pocket of trousers purchased from a Primark store several years earlier. The letter was written in Chinese and alleged that prisoners were forced to work \"like oxen\" making fashion clothes for export for 15 hours per day, and the food they were given wouldn't be fit for dogs or pigs.\n\nA year and a half later an SOS note from an alleged Chinese torture victim was found in socks purchased from Primark.\n\nIn December 2018, a human bone was found by a customer in a sock purchased in the shop’s Colchester branch. \n"}

It is used by Ryanair. The airport is situated southwest of the municipality of Weeze () and northwest of Kevelaer, about southeast of the Dutch city of Nijmegen, and northwest of the German city of Duisburg. During the 2000-15 period this was one of several German airports expanding rapidly, however the airport handled only 1,23 Mio. passengers in 2019, reflecting a decline in throughput triggered by Ryanair reducing its route network.\n\nThe airport uses the facilities of the former military airbase RAF Laarbruch, and began operating as a civil airport in 2003. There is also a large fire department training facility on the airport grounds. Its IATA code is \"NRN\" because of its official name \"Flughafen Niederrhein\". The airport has had several different names in its history as a civil airport. The operators originally wanted to name it after the city of Düsseldorf, but the significant distance of to that city, which already had two closer international airports (Düsseldorf Airport as well as Cologne Bonn Airport), resulted in the name being blocked by a court ruling that such a description would be likely to mislead passengers. However, Ryanair still refers to it as \"\"Düsseldorf-Weeze\"\". The airport is actually closer to the Dutch cities of Venlo, Nijmegen and Arnhem, the German city of Duisburg, and the immediate Weeze area than Düsseldorf.\n\nWeeze was served by the short-lived, Dutch low-cost carrier V Bird, which opened a base here and operated flights to Berlin, Munich and several international destinations, from its inception in 2003 until bankruptcy in 2004. During this time, passenger numbers doubled from 200,000 to 400,000 within a year. In February 2014, Ryanair announced the cancellation of 18 routes from Weeze for the 2014 summer season citing a lack of aircraft.\n\nIn 2019, the airport faced severe financial difficulties due to a fall in passenger numbers by 30 percent over the previous year as a result of the cancellation of several Ryanair routes.\n\nWeeze Airport has one passenger terminal building with restaurants, shops, and check-in facilities. The apron, which is to the west of the terminal building, features nine aircraft stands for mid-sized aircraft such as the Boeing 737-800. As there are no jet bridges due to the location of the apron to the west side of the terminal building instead in front of it – bus-boarding is used for six stands. Only three stands are close enough to the terminal to be accessed on foot.\n\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Weeze Airport:\n\nDirect buses serve Düsseldorf Main Station up to 7 times a day; the journey taking 1h 15min. \"Airexpressbus\" offered from June 2007 until spring 2017 a service between Weeze Airport and Amsterdam with stops at Eindhoven Airport, 's-Hertogenbosch, and Utrecht.\n\nBus shuttles serve the railway stations of Weeze, Kevelaer and Goch on a frequent basis. Travellers for Düsseldorf Main Station will need to catch a bus or taxi to either Weeze or Kevelaer railway stations.\n\n\n"}

Extremes (; ; ; \"Utsukushī Yoru, Zankokuna Asa\") is a 2004 international East Asian horror film collaboration consisting of three segments by three directors from three countries. It is a sequel to, and follows the concept of \"Three\" (2002), this time with more established directors.\n\nIts first film, \"Dumplings\", was expanded into a theatrical feature film.\n\nAging actress Mrs. Li wants to rejuvenate her youth and beauty to attract the attention of her husband, Li, who has secretly taken a mistress behind her back. She buys dumplings from Aunt Mei, a mysterious seller who claims to be much older than she appears. However, to her disgust, she learns that the dumplings are in fact made from aborted fetuses, which Mei takes from a nearby hospital that has a secret abortion facility, as well as working as an abortion midwife herself.\n\nNevertheless, Mrs. Li decides to continue eating the fetus dumplings. One of them, made from a five month old fetus (the 'oldest' of the aborted fetuses thus far), seems to have a positive effect on Mrs. Li's libido, yet it also causes her skin to exhibit a fishy smell. Eventually, Mei has to move out when the authorities are about to capture her. Mrs. Li, now two months pregnant despite being declared infertile earlier, is still desperate for a rejuvenation and chooses to abort her own fetus, presumably to make it into dumplings.\n\nA successful film director has to face a night of misery when a man who appeared in five of his films as an extra, captures both him and his wife to play a deadly game. The wife, a pianist, is gagged and trapped in a system of sharp wires at her piano. The director is instructed to strangle a young girl the extra met while on the way, or else the extra will chop off the wife's fingers one by one every five minutes. The extra reveals that he kidnapped the couple because he is jealous that the director is able to be a rich and good man, while he is poor and abusive to his wife and son, the former of whom he murdered before the incident.\n\nThe director tries to buy time by telling stories of his infidelity, though the extra continues to chop the wife's fingers until only one remains on her left hand. The director ultimately decides to kill the young girl by strangling her. He tries, but does not quite succeed in killing her. The young girl's wig comes off and she is revealed to be boy - the extra's son. The extra is only stopped when he slips on a ring the wife was wearing before he chopped off her ring finger, and on the blood pouring from the wife's fingers. The wife then bites the extra's neck, pushing him into the wires that imprison her, leaving him bleeding to death. Traumatized and delusional, the director, now believing his wife to be the extra's son and vice versa, strangles her to death.\n\nKyoko, a 25 year-old novelist, frequently experiences nightmares of her past as a circus performer. Back when she was 10 years old, Kyoko worked in a circus with her twin sister, Shoko, and their benefactor, Higata. Kyoko felt that Higata was favoring Shoko over her when he praised her after a performance. When Shoko was training, Kyoko forced and locked her into a box. However, Higata watched the incident and tried to rescue her, only for Kyoko to scar him in the face and then accidentally set the box in flames. Since then, Kyoko is haunted with guilt and wants to apologize to her sister. She is also struck uncannily by her literature publisher, Yoshii, who is a doppelganger of Higata, except that he is more caring to her.\n\nOne day, Kyoko follows an invitation to her old circus, only to discover the box containing Shoko's burned remains. She is confronted by Higata, who is distraught after the incident and tells her that both Kyoko and Shoko are important to him, but only as one entity. After luring her into kissing him, he forces her into a plastic sack, fits it into a box, then buries it in the nearby snowy ground. However, it is revealed that the entire event of the film is just another dream of Kyoko, who in reality has been conjoined with Shoko since birth. The sisters exit the house to meet with Higata/Yoshii, both indeed the same person.\n\n\n\n\n\"Three...

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an 84% approval rating based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8 out of 10; its consensus reads: \"This anthology contains brutal, powerful horror stories by three of Asia's top directors.\" Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gave the film an average score of 66 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\"Chicago Sun-Times\" critic Roger Ebert praised the film by giving it 3½ stars out of 4, describing the films as \"deeply, profoundly creepy\", and he attributed their qualities to the works of famous horror writers Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King. \"The New York Times\" Dana Stevens gave a positive review, writing: \"Though \"Three Extremes\" may seem tame to jaded fans of what has been termed New Asian Horror, it serves as a fine introduction to the genre for those who are curious but squeamish.\" \"The Boston Globe's\" Ty Burr gave a favorable review, advising viewers to \"fasten your seat belts for a bumpy ride -- narratively and artistically -- and don't go in on a full stomach.\"\n\n"}

Over the course of the summer, they played one Twenty20 International, a triangular ODI tournament with both Bangladesh and England, a one-day tournament with England, and five Test matches, the outcome of which would decide The Ashes. With Australia the top-ranked team in the World Test table, and England the second-ranked, this was the most eagerly anticipated Ashes series since the 1980s.\n\nAustralia won their first two warm-up games, a Twenty20 game against the PCA Masters XI at Arundel and a 50-over game against Leicestershire emphatically. However, the tide turned as they lost their next matches, firstly by 100 runs against England in a Twenty20 game, followed by a remarkable defeat to Somerset in a very high scoring match at Taunton.\n\nThe first international matches scheduled were as part of the Natwest Series against England and Bangladesh. In their first match, Australia lost to Bangladesh by five wickets in the last over, perhaps the biggest upset in recent memory. Just before that game Andrew Symonds was dropped for disciplinary reasons. The following day, Australia lost their second match in a row to England, due mainly to Kevin Pietersen's late batting onslaught. However, Australia remained undefeated throughout the rest of the series to tie a thrilling final against England at Lord's.\n\nAustralia's next tournament was a three match Natwest Challenge One-day International tournament against England. Despite losing the first match, they bounced back to take the series 2–1. After a drawn three-day match against Leicestershire, the main part of the tour – the Tests against England for The Ashes – were about to start.\n\nWith all the hype preceding Australia's arrival in England, especially Glenn McGrath's assertion that Australia would win 5–0, many people expected a good, tight contest, although Australia's fans predicted a clear overall victory. English fans were quietly confident that their strong run – winning 15 and drawing two of their last 18 Test matches – would continue and they could at least stand up to Australia, having lost the last eight Ashes series.\n\nWhat followed surprised everyone – England's hostile pace bowling ripped through Australia in the first Test, reducing them to 190 all out. However, Australia replied in style by skittling England for 155, with only Pietersen – playing in his Test debut – able to resist. During this innings, McGrath took his 500th Test wicket. Australia then fared considerably better in their second innings to win the first Test by 239 runs.\n\nAfter another drawn three-day match, this time against Worcestershire, came a pivotal moment of the series. While warming up for the second Test at Edgbaston, McGrath injured his ankle stepping on a cricket ball and was unable to play in the Test. At the last moment, Michael Kasprowicz was included in the team, but Australia had lost their bowling spearhead.\n\nHaving won the toss, the Australian captain, Ricky Ponting, decided to bowl first on a pitch suited for batting. England batted quickly and aggressively, scoring over 400 runs on the first day. England finished with a 99 run lead after the first innings, and although the Australians put up a fighting tail-end batting display on the fourth day (they needed 107 runs with only two wickets in hand at the end of the third day), England held on to win by two runs – the closest runs victory in Ashes history.\n\nThe third Test match was held at Old Trafford, and again England took a large first innings lead, the England innings notable for Shane Warne taking his 600th Test wicket and Michael Vaughan scoring the first century of the series. Glenn McGrath had also returned from injury, returning the Australian side to full strength. Due to rain delays, the Australian first innings did not finish until the fourth day.\n\nEngland then set about scoring quickly in their second innings (with the aim of declaring and bowling Australia out to win), setting Australia 423 to win with only a day and 10 overs remaining. Ricky Ponting batted for seven hours on the final day to score the first Australian century of the series, but was dismissed with only four overs left and Australia's last two batsmen facing them. Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath managed to hang on for those four overs to salvage a draw for Australia, with England unable to take the last wicket.\n\nAustralia then played a two-day match against Northants, a drawn match in which Australia opted for batting practice instead of trying to force the win.\n\nFor the second time in less than a month, Glenn McGrath was ruled out of a test due to injury – this time with elbow problems. Australia also dropped Jason Gillespie from their side after taking just three wickets so far in the series. In contrast, England remained with their original starting XI from the first Test. They carried on their first innings form with their best of the series (477 all out), before England's bowlers managed to swing the ball prodigiously to leave Australia at 99/5 and 175/9. Despite the best efforts of Brett Lee, Australia finished 259 runs behind England and were asked to follow-on – for the first time in 17 years. However, with the need to bowl for two innings in a row, Simon Jones, England's best swing bowler, started showing signs of injury and was taken to hospital for a scan on his ankle. Australia were then able to post a target for England to chase, but on a wearing pitch with Shane Warne getting large amounts of turn, England struggled in their pursuit of 129, winning by three wickets in the end.\n\nAustralia then played a two-day match against Essex, in which Essex reached 500 in the first day before declaring, while Australia reached 500 on the second day. The match finished in a high-scoring draw, as no team was able to dismiss the other twice.\n\nFor the first time in the series, England made a change to their side – Simon Jones' ankle injury meant that England needed to replace him. With England 2–1 up with one to play, Australia needed a victory to level the series (and thus retain the Ashes). With this in mind, England decided to call up Paul Collingwood, an all-rounder and England's best fielder, rather than a like-for-like bowler.\n\nEngland won the toss and elected to bat, reaching 373 in their first innings. Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer then batted through to the end of the second day, coming off for bad light before the scheduled close of play. With Australia needing to force the victory, many were surprised at this move.\n\nThe third day was also affected by rain and bad light, with only half of the scheduled overs being bowled. Australia again came off early for bad light, but as they were only 96 runs behind England and still had eight wickets in hand, they were possibly hoping to establish a significant lead and bowl England out cheaply.\n\nAn Australian collapse after lunch on the fourth day meant England were actually leading by six runs after the first innings. With Australia needing to dismiss England and score more runs than them, England merely had to bat for as long as possible, denying Australia the time needed to force victory. Thanks to Kevin Pietersen's maiden Test century on the fifth day, and Paul Collingwood batting patiently for 10 runs in 51 minutes in the second innings, Australia were left with a target of 342 runs with only 19 overs remaining in the day. With Steve Harmison opening the bowling for England, Australia were offered the light in the first over of their second innings and accepted, leaving Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden to remove the bails at 18:17 BST to signal a drawn match and the series victory for England.\n\nDuring the presentations, Pietersen was voted man of the match for his innings of 158, while Andrew Flintoff and Shane Warne received the \"Man of the Series\" awards, nominated by the opposing team coaches (Duncan Fletcher for England and John Buchanan for Australia). In addition, Flintoff was awarded the inaugural Compton–Miller Medal for the overall \"Man of the Series\", nominated by the two chairmen of selectors, David Graveney and Trevor Hohns.\n\nThe Australians beat the PCA Masters XI by 8 wickets\n\nThe 2005 Ashes tour started with the Australians taking on a Professional Cricketers' Association XI at the picturesque ground at Arundel in a Twenty20 game. A crowd of 11,000 turned up to see the tourists win with one ball to spare, although in practice the result was always clear after an opening partnership of 131 between Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden. The Aussies got an ideal start as Stephen Fleming edged Brett Lee's first delivery to the slips and the Masters XI were 0 for 1, having been put in to bat by Australia. Darren Maddy made 70 in 57 balls and Paul Collingwood (38) and Mark Ealham (39) also scored runs, but the rest of the team made little impression as the PCA Masters XI made 167 for 6. The Aussies lost only two wickets in making their target. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nThe Australians beat Leicestershire by 95 runs\n\nThe Australians put in a strong performance at Grace Road, with Matthew Hayden making 107 off 96 balls, Damien Martyn 85 off 103 and Andrew Symonds 92 off 59 as they made a huge 321 for 4 off their 50 overs. 72 of their runs came off the final 5 overs. Leicestershire never threatened in reply, with Ottis Gibson, who came in at 8, the only man to make 50. Gibson had earlier taken two wickets for Leicestershire, who finished well short of the target on 226 for 8. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nEngland started cautiously in the only Twenty20 International against Australia at the Rose Bowl, only hitting six runs off the first two overs as they saw off the bowlers, but Geraint Jones then decided to have fun with Brett Lee. Hitting two boundaries off the next over, Lee was hit for 14, and England moved rapidly to 28 for no loss before Jones cut McGrath to deep third man, where Kasprowicz took a catch on the boundary – out for 19 with four fours. Marcus Trescothick hit a single to end the over, but England were happy enough with 29 for 1 after four overs. Lee's next over was, again, hit for 14, as Lee served up one wide and a no-ball to end with three overs for 31 as singles were taken off every ball. That prompted a bowling change, with Michael Kasprowicz coming on for Australia, and with good reward, as the penultimate ball of his over was caught by Symonds at midwicket – Andrew Flintoff out for 6. Kevin Pietersen managed to scamper a single, and after six overs, England were 50 for 2.\n\nWith Jason Gillespie coming on, England continued to take the singles, although the fielding restrictions were off and Australia could stop more of those. However, Michael Clarke at deep backward point handed England three runs in the seventh over with a misfield. Pietersen continued to dominate the Australian bowling, smashing a four and a two off Gillespie, as England took ten runs off the eighth over. Australia looked clueless – a rare sight – as they continued to give runs away through misfields, and Kevin Pietersen smashed his way to 33 not out off 16 balls – after 10 overs, England were 93 for 2, and looking to set a massive target.\n\nThe Australian captain Ricky Ponting brought on part-time spinner Michael Clarke to bowl the 11th over, and got immediate success, when Pietersen launched him to Matthew Hayden on the fifth ball, but England were still 101 for 3 after 11 overs. In the next over, the new batsman Michael Vaughan edged Andrew Symonds' ball to midwicket, and the pressure was suddenly on the English. With Trescothick out for 41 a bit later to an attempted sweep off Symonds, England were suddenly looking down a hole after a fine start, and Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood slowed the scoring, to see England 111 for 5 with six overs to play. However, a slog sweep from Collingwood to end the 15th over turned the match again, as it went away for six and England moved to 124 for 5. With Jason Gillespie being brought back, Collingwood led the charge, as England stole 17 runs off the 17th over and wrought control of the game again. Despite Andrew Strauss being bowled by Gillespie for 18, Collingwood hit another two boundaries towards the end of the over, to move onto 42 not out and the team score to 167 for 6. Vikram Solanki was out in the next over for 9, caught by Hussey off McGrath, and on the last ball, Collingwood was caught by for 46. Still, England would be pleased with 179 for 8, the highest score on the Rose Bowl in Twenty20 matches.\n\nAustralia started shakily, with Adam Gilchrist playing-and-missing and edging one shot over Andrew Strauss at third man, who miscued the path of the ball, as the Australians got eight off the first over bowled by Darren Gough. With Gilchrist finally taking one liberty too many, an easy catch was given, and Kevin Pietersen took it to remove arguably the most dangerous batsman in this format. On the next ball, Hayden was out, caught by Pietersen for 6. Symonds survived the next ball, but odds had improved for England, as the visitors were now 23 for 2. What followed was an Australian collapse – Michael Clarke went for a golden duck to Lewis, a slightly dubious decision, but that gave the English the needed momentum. Within the next four overs, Australia had lost four more wickets for eight runs, Symonds for 0, Hussey for 1, Ponting for 0, Martyn for 4, and despite a recovery from Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee, the required run rate ran away to 12 an over from the last 11 overs. Jon Lewis finished his spell with four wickets for 24 – a special international debut, even though it was only in a Twenty20 game. Despite a good recovery and a partnership of 36, Gillespie eventually holed out a catch to Marcus Trescothick off the hero of the match, Paul Collingwood, and England headed even further towards a victory. Eventually, McGrath was bowled by Harmison, ending the innings for 79 all out – exactly the same score that England succumbed to in the fourth innings chase against the Australians in the first Test of the last Ashes.\n\nSomerset won by four wickets\n\nSomerset shocked everyone with a nail-biting win over Australia at Taunton, their first win over the Australians since 1977. Somerset were placed mid-table in the second division of the National League, and no one believed they should have any chance against an Australian team only missing Adam Gilchrist. And Australia backed that up with the bat – Matthew Hayden retired after a fun hit-out for 76, captain Ricky Ponting the same for 80, and Australia tonked 342 for 5.\n\nGraeme Smith and Sanath Jayasuriya, however, fought back for Somerset. The pair opened, and put on 197 for the first wicket in little over 20 overs – Smith smashing his way to a massive 68-ball hundred, ending with 108 with 17 fours and a six. Jayasuriya, not wishing to be worse, made a 77-ball ton – before getting out for 101 a bit later. The platform was set, however, and 24-year-old James Hildreth could steady the ship after Somerset had lost some wickets to part-time bowler Michael Hussey. Hildreth made 38 not out off 24 balls and saw them to a victory with 19 balls and four wickets to spare – more comfortable than the match looked for the most part. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nPerhaps, the biggest upset in the history of One Day Internationals, Mashrafe Mortaza shocked the Sophia Gardens crowd when he had Adam Gilchrist plumb on the second ball of the second ODI, taking the first Australian wicket without a run yet on the scoreboard – and it was to set the tone of the match. Most people would have expected Australia to swamp Bangladesh, especially after the 10-wicket defeat the Bangladeshi Tigers endured in the opening match with England, but a maiden from Mortaza gave them some hope, at least. Things looked to be going the right way for Australia when Matthew Hayden took a boundary off Tapash Baisya, but another maiden followed, and in the sixth over Ricky Ponting padded up to Tapash Baisya – resulting in an lbw decision given, and Australia were 9 for 2. Cautious batting from Hayden and Damien Martyn followed, but some expensive bowling from Baisya relinquished the initiative, as Australia recovered. They survived through 15 overs, Hayden being caught off a no-ball from Tapash, but in the 16th, he was bowled by Nazmul Hossain for 37 off an inside edge, just as Hayden were looking to get himself in. Some economical bowling from Mohammad Rafique who bowled ten overs for 31 runs, along with excellent bowling from Mortaza at the death, resulted in Australia finishing on 249 for 5, losing Martyn to Baisya for 77 and Clarke to the same man for 54. In fact, Michael Hussey with 31 not out off 21 balls and Simon Katich with 36 not out off 23 ensured that they got a competitive target.\n\nThat was not all, however. The chase began very sedately, only Tushar Imran looking to take runs as he smashed Brad Hogg about, but Hogg got his revenge when Tushar was out for 24, lofting to Katich. Earlier, Nafees Iqbal had gone for 8, and with Javed Omar out as the third man to fall, for 19 off 51 balls, it looked to be business as usual for Bangladesh. But this match had more tricks up its sleeve. Hogg and Clarke leaked runs like a drain, six wides were bowled, and Mohammad Ashraful showed another glimpse of why he's been called Bangladesh's finest batsman. As he made the second ODI hundred in the Bangladesh team's history, he forged a massive 130-run partnership with Habibul Bashar, and had a great two hours at the crease (although dropped on 54) – before picking out Jason Gillespie at long on to be out for exactly 100. Bangladesh still needed 23 runs off 17 balls, but Aftab Ahmed continued his fine form from the Oval match with England, as he first took a leg bye off Ashraful, then gave the strike to Rafique, who smashed a cover driven four before taking another leg bye. A four and a dot-ball finished a 10-run over, meaning that Bangladesh now needed only 13 off 12 balls. A good over from McGrath followed, as he conceded only six runs – including an edged four from Rafique. With the last over, Bangladesh needed seven runs, and Ahmed swung the first ball of the over to midwicket for six. Thus, it became a formality – Bangladesh won with four balls and five wickets to spare, almost convincing in today's cricket, and the result meant that the Aussies needed a victory over England at Bristol the following day to have any chance of winning the group stage.\n\nRicky Ponting chose to bat when he won the toss for the visiting Australian cricket team in an extremely tense and see-sawing match at The County Ground, Bristol. It looked like a great decision when Jon Lewis and Darren Gough were smashed about early on, as Australia made their way to 57 for 0 after 11 overs with Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden taking sixes off Lewis over midwicket. However, with the entrance of Steve Harmison, everything changed. In his third over – the 12th of the game, he removed Gilchrist with a bouncy ball that the batsman edged behind, then Ponting with a yorker that he didn't play at – resulting in lbw – then a dot ball, and then Martyn with a slog shot to Pietersen at third man. Australia tried to consolidate, but when Hayden tried to hit out off Harmison four overs later, Paul Collingwood jumped up to pick the ball out of the air with his right hand – a magnificent catch, and Australia had lost four wickets for six runs, reminiscent of their collapse in the Twenty20 match earlier on in the week.\n\nAustralia dug themselves out of the hole, however, Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey slowly accumulating to increase the rate. England clearly lacked a fifth bowler, opting instead for Vikram Solanki to bat down the order, so they used a combination of Michael Vaughan, Solanki and Collingwood to get through their ten required overs. That let Australia off the hook, with Clarke and Hussey adding 105, before Jon Lewis – who had been taken to the cleaners earlier on – dug out Michael Clarke with an inside edge onto the stumps, taking the fifth wicket of the game at just the right time. Shane Watson accumulated well with Hussey, however, hitting six an over as Lewis was smashed about again, but Harmison got his revenge by completing his first five-wicket haul in ODIs as Hussey was beaten by a slower ball – the first time Hussey had been dismissed in One Day Internationals, for a batting average of 229. Then, Andrew Flintoff was brought back, getting a splendid yorker in for Watson, who was out for 25 just as the Aussies were preparing to hit out – the score 220 for 7 after 44.1 overs. Jason Gillespie and Brad Hogg survived a couple of overs from Flintoff and Harmison – meaning that Harmison finished with five for 33 off ten overs. Towards the end, Australia built up again, before losing Gillespie to a top edge, but 244 for 8 with seven balls remaining still looked difficult for England to chase. Gough dug out Michael Kasprowicz with a yorker with two balls to spare, and four legbyes ended the innings to take Australia to 252 for 9.\n\nEngland started positively in reply, taking 39 off the first 34 legal deliveries (while Gillespie served up four wides and a no-ball in his first over), but Glenn McGrath took revenge by serving up a good yorker to have Marcus Trescothick bowled for 16. Two overs later, Andrew Strauss went in identical fashion, and Vaughan and Collingwood were forced to consolidate. They did, although in jerky fashion, Collingwood eventually falling to Kasprowicz and Flintoff mistiming a hit off Hogg to see England into a spot of bother at 119 for 4 after 27.2 overs, with Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen at the crease. Edges and runs followed, but when England lost Vaughan and Geraint Jones in quick succession, and were 93 short with only 74 deliveries left, it looked dark for England. Pietersen then upped the ante. Smashing runs to all corners, especially off Gillespie, he reached his fifty off 46 balls, and then took 19 more deliveries to bring up an additional 41 runs – although surviving an extremely close run-out decision near the 40th over. A level headed 7 not out from Lewis – making up somewhat for his bowling – ensured the English were home by three wickets and 15 deliveries – and the Australians had only managed two points from their first two matches, while England had gained 11.\n\nAustralia squared the ODI series by winning a game where England missed their captain Michael Vaughan due to injury. Marcus Trescothick, the stand-in captain, won the toss and decided to chase at the Riverside Ground, thus giving his own side the task of batting under floodlights. Chris Tremlett who had made an impressive debut against Bangladesh, struggled early on with his line and length, and the Australian openers Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist punished him for runs. In his fifth over, however, Tremlett got a breakthrough, Gilchrist mistiming a cut and Geraint Jones taking the catch behind. However, Ricky Ponting did not toss his wicket away early, leaving it to Hayden to hit the runs, and at the end of 15 overs the Australians were 73 for 1. Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison, the change bowlers, kept the pressure up on the batsmen, however, not letting too many runs away even though they bowled the occasional wide, and they could reap the rewards with two quick wickets, Ponting for 27 and Hayden for 39, and people began to remember the last ODI between the sides.\n\nHowever, this time there was no collapse. Two no-balls from Harmison followed, Andrew Symonds and Damien Martyn defended well, waiting for Harmison and Flintoff to be taken off and saved for the last overs. They were – and Australia were let off the hook. Symonds and Martyn paired up for 142 runs, taking runs off every bowler – even Flintoff and Harmison – and batted together for nearly 25 overs, with a partnership run-rate of nearly 6. The first four overs only yielded 13 runs, but when Harmison was taken off England lost the sting. Symonds was finally run out by the skipper Trescothick for 73, a hopeless attempt at taking a single, and Flintoff dug out Michael Hussey for 5 two overs later. Australia, however, made a highly competitive 266 for 5, and in the seaming conditions one would expect it to be enough.\n\nAs it turned out, it was. Brett Lee, opening the bowling for Australia, started off with a maiden over to Trescothick, and England struggled to get off the mark, being four for no wicket after three overs. Another maiden from Glenn McGrath followed, and then Andrew Strauss departed with an inside edge off Lee. In the next over, Trescothick was gone for a 15-ball duck, to an away-swinger from McGrath, and two balls later Paul Collingwood gave a massive inside-edge onto his stumps – England were six for three, and staring down the barrel.\n\nA rescue operation from Andrew Flintoff and Vikram Solanki followed, pairing up for 79 before Solanki was caught at midwicket off Brad Hogg. Then, Flintoff was nearly stumped off Hogg's bowling, only to give a catch at long on later on in the over for 44. With England at 94 for 5, they needed seven and a half runs an over, with Kevin Pietersen and Geraint Jones at the crease. However, even Pietersen could not save them this time, as he was caught in the deep off Symonds for 19, and the rest of the match just became a task to bat out 50 overs. Thanks to Darren Gough, who made 46 not out (ironically, the top score of the innings), and a level-headed 11 not out from Steve Harmison, England made that, but lost by 57 runs – thus also losing the bonus point.\n\nAustralia recorded a thumping 10-wicket win over Bangladesh to level their head-to-head record in the NatWest Series to 1–1. Under leaden skies at Old Trafford, Ricky Ponting made the wise decision and chose to bowl, and short-balls from Brett Lee immediately had the Bangladeshis worried. They survived six overs without loss before Javed Omar was trapped by an in-swinger for a 20-ball 3. Tushar Imran was next to fall to Lee, and many expected a procession to begin, but Shahriar Nafees and Mohammad Ashraful gave the crowd a treat with some special strokes. Ashraful had two top-edged sixes, as Lee was dispatched for 20 runs in the 11th over. By the drinks break after 15 overs, Bangladesh were 76 for 2, having added 53 from the last 39 balls. Ponting, however, brought on the spinners Brad Hogg and Andrew Symonds, who both got a fair amount of turn out of the Old Trafford pitch, and Symonds had Shahriar bowled for 47 with a yorker that he played late to. The next ball, he got the out-of-form captain Habibul Bashar, and the wickets began to tumble quickly. Symonds got five wickets for 18 runs, Hogg three for 29, Bangladesh collapsed from 137 for 6 (when Khaled Mashud was bowled by Hogg) to 139 all out in three overs, as Ashraful went for 58 and no one else really offering any resistance to the slow Australian bowlers.\n\nBangladesh had Adam Gilchrist in some trouble early on, especially through fast bowler Mashrafe Mortaza, who had him beaten several times in the opening overs, but Matthew Hayden was imposing at the crease, punishing the inevitable bad balls from Nazmul Hossain who was taken off after three overs, having conceded 29 runs. However, no one could stop the rot, Hayden and Gilchrist taking runs at will after a while to see Australia to the target inside 20 overs. Australia thus closed the gap to England to three points, as the situation indicated by the ICC rankings before the series became more and more possible – that Bangladesh were to be whipping boys and England and Australia would go through.\n\nThe eighth match of the NatWest Series eventually became an anti-climax, but for large parts of the match it wasn't – despite the fact that both teams had qualified for the final before the last game. Ricky Ponting won the toss and chose to send his openers in – and they took advantage. Darren Gough was innocuous, conceding 23 runs in his first two overs, prompting a bowling change in the fifth over, sending Steve Harmison on. Meanwhile, Simon Jones got some swing with the new ball – and, yet again in this series, Adam Gilchrist was caught behind off a swing bowler, out for 19. Shortly afterwards, Jones tried to throw the ball back at the wicketkeeper as Matthew Hayden pushed it back to him, but Jones hit Hayden with the balls, and a few words were exchanged – Paul Collingwood joining in the fray as well.\n\nHowever, the match got on, Jones and Harmison putting on the pressure and eventually having Hayden lbw on 14 – after he had failed to score from the last 11 deliveries. Damien Martyn then faced five dot-balls, and Jones served up a wicket maiden, and Australia were at 46 for 2 at the end of the tenth over. However, that was as good as it got for England. Andrew Flintoff dug out skipper Ricky Ponting for 34, but it mattered little, as Martyn and Andrew Symonds took advantage of the bowling. Michael Vaughan tried to put himself on, but Symonds smashed him over midwicket for six – the first of the match, displaying the despair. With some no-balls from Gough, and Simon Jones getting smashed early on, Australia were 220 for 4 after 42 overs, and looked on course for 300. However, the run-out of Symonds for 74 changed the course of the innings. Michael Clarke departed for three, a good catch by Geraint Jones behind the stumps, and Harmison then served up a wicket-maiden in the 46th over, of all things. With Brad Hogg and Jason Gillespie giving soft catches to Gough, that redeemed his figures somewhat, but he still conceded 70 runs. The last over from Flintoff was very good, however, conceding only three runs with yorkers directed at the feet of the batsmen, and Australia had to be content with 261 for 9.\n\nEngland's chase was interrupted once by rain, after three overs, when they were eight for 0, but coming back they were set 200 to win in 33 overs. That was never possible – rain started again after three more overs – and when Andrew Strauss fell the umpires decided that play was no longer possible, and a no-result was declared.\n\nThe last game of the round robin of the NatWest Series was, as expected, won by the Australians. However, it summed up the improvement Bangladesh had made over the tour of England. In the first international, they were rolled over meekly by a no-balling, rusty English side – twice. In the last, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie put the pressure on early, and with the aid of Shane Watson had them on the reels with 75 for 5. Yet, Bangladesh recovered to post 250 for 8, and were theoretically in with a chance for most of the game. Yet, they started very, very shakily. Javed Omar was dropped by Matthew Hayden in the third over, only to be out to Jason Gillespie in the next for an eight-ball duck – a disappointing end to a fine series for the Bangladeshi. Brett Lee had both Tushar Imran and Mohammad Ashraful beaten with full deliveries, Bangladesh were 19 for three wickets down – an all too familiar position.\n\nA quickfire 30 from captain Habibul Bashar helped to take away some of the jitters, as Bashar took 16 runs off a Brett Lee over, but a bouncer from Shane Watson wasn't successfully evaded, and Adam Gilchrist could take the catch. Aftab Ahmed had to settle for 7, and it was down to the last two recognised batsmen – Shahriar Nafees, who had quietly moved his way to 25 not out, and wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud. However, the two put on an almost faultless partnership of 94, taking their time to consolidate. Shahriar eventually departed for 75, edging a short ball from Shane Watson to the wicket-keeper – the usual method of dismissal. However, their partnership had given Bangladesh hope, and Mohammad Rafique took advantage with a six off Watson. Despite two more wickets falling – Rafique and Khaled Mahmud (caught at mid-on on the last ball) – Bangladesh had recovered to 250 for 8, which could potentially be tricky to chase.\n\nMashrafe Mortaza was hit around for 12 in the first over, however, and the momentum swung towards Australia. Mortaza hit back by inducing an outside edge from Matthew Hayden to wicketkeeper Mashud for 1, and four balls later a ball from Mortaza hit captain Ricky Ponting on the pads – but too high to be given out. Gilchrist and Ponting paired up well, however, even though Gilchrist rode his luck with a few drives in the air, but in the tenth over he gave a somewhat dubious catch to slip Khaled Mahmud, and was gone for 45 – all while rain threatened to damage the match. However, the weather gradually improved, along with Australia's chances – after 15 overs, they were 83 for three, having lost Damien Martyn for 9, but only needed slightly less than five an over. However, economical bowling and riskless batting from Australia saw Bangladesh in with a chance again. Ponting and Michael Clarke let the run rate go to more than six an over, but Khaled Mahmud's bowling at the death to Andrew Symonds left a bit to be desired, as Australia could take the necessary runs and win by 11 balls and six wickets to spare. A Bangladeshi – Shahriar Nafees – got the Man of the Match award, possibly for his effort to keep the match exciting after Bangladesh had crumbled to 75 for 5.\n\nThe final of the NatWest Series ended in an anticlimax for the visitors, but throughout it gave entertainment to the crowd – despite being a relatively low-scoring game. It didn't look to be low-scoring early on, though, as Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden punished the England opening bowlers Darren Gough and Simon Jones to be 50 for 0 after 6.3 overs. Two balls later, Hayden went for one expansive stroke too many – driving to Ashley Giles at mid-off for 17. England captain Michael Vaughan brought his change bowlers on, first Andrew Flintoff for Jones (who had been taken for 29 runs in his first three overs) and then Steve Harmison.\n\nThose changes turned the match on its head. Instead of the Australian batsmen taking easy runs off the English bowlers, the English bowlers now tied down the batting, getting rewards in the form of wickets. Gilchrist gave a catch to Kevin Pietersen at short leg for 27, and when Harmison was brought on a couple of overs later, he immediately got a wicket – of Ricky Ponting for 7, and Australia were 71 for 3 after 12.1 overs. Damien Martyn and Andrew Symonds decided to retreat into their shell, as the English bowling turned from difficult to almost unhittable, Flintoff getting a touch on the off-stump of Symonds, but the bail didn't fall off, so he survived. However, the pair could only add 19 from 35 deliveries, before Harmison had Martyn caught behind with a ball that moved away from the batsman, off the waiting edge and into Geraint Jones' gloves.\n\nFollowing the dismissal of Martyn, Vaughan brought back Jones – realising that Australia were reluctant to hit runs and thus allowing Jones to get through his overs without causing as much damage as he did early on. In fact, he and Harmison were part of a remarkable streak – they served up 28 successive dot-balls to Symonds and Michael Clarke (who bowed under to the pressure and was hit on the pad, out lbw for a 19-ball two). However, Michael Hussey – facing his first ball at 93 for 5 after 25 overs – took control of Jones, and when Harmison was taken off, Australia were let off the hook.\n\nSymonds and Hussey batted out 15 overs, but Symonds struggled to hit runs and eventually smashed a drive to Andrew Strauss, who took a grateful catch, thus ending Symonds' innings for 29 – off 71 balls, a good innings in Test cricket but in ODI cricket virtually useless. Michael Vaughan then used a strange bowling change, keeping spinner Ashley Giles on for an over more than required and thus borrowing one from Andrew Flintoff who wasn't allowed to bowl a full ten. In the event, it mattered little. Flintoff had ample time to rip out Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, and, with Harmison taking care of Brad Hogg and Glenn McGrath committing batting suicide with a shot not exactly out of the textbook, Australia were all out for 196 – and England were comfortably in the drivers' seat.\n\nThat was before they got in to bat, however. England survived the first three overs, bowled by McGrath and Lee, without loss. From then on, however, the English lost wickets by the bucketful. England went from 11 for 0 to 19 for 4 in the space of four overs, as the bowlers put the pressure on immediately, and their entire top-order came and went for single-figure scores. Paul Collingwood and Andrew Flintoff survived for a couple more overs, before Flintoff edged McGrath to slip – the score 33 for 5, and England should see themselves lucky to bat out 50 overs – or even score 100 runs. Collingwood and Geraint Jones decided to wait, giving McGrath maiden overs (as he finished his first bowling spell with figures of 7–4–9–3), and despite the batsmen being rapped on the pads, they survived, even taking the occasional six off Jason Gillespie.\n\nAfter 25 overs, England were 65 for 5, but the Australian spinners didn't get too much out of the track. Dot-balls flourished, but the partnership kept in there, and a second six – from Jones off Hogg – showed their intent. After 35 overs, England were 113 for 5, and required a run a ball, with four overs of Lee and three of McGrath still to negotiate. However, England kept pushing, never letting the run-rate get above 7. Skipper Ponting showed some desperation when he brought Michael Hussey on with nine overs to spare, knowing that the spinners couldn't keep it tight, but got his reward in Hussey's second over when Collingwood was run out for 53 – off 116 balls.\n\nThen Geraint Jones smacked two fours off Hussey to end the over, meaning that England needed 39 off 36 balls. Five balls later, a miscued sweep off Hogg hit Geraint Jones on the pads – gone for 71 – and England only had three wickets to spare. Two more balls were delivered before that tally was cut down to two – Hussey bowled Simon Jones for a two-ball one, so with Gough and Giles in, England needed 35 off 29 balls. Despite taking the runs off Hussey, Brett Lee's 47th over only yielded a single, as his variations of length turned out to be just the thing. However, Ponting now needed another over from either Hussey, Hogg or Symonds – deciding to use Hussey, he was punished, as Giles hit twos to both the off and leg side, and a wide from Hussey resulting in a nine-run over. Lee then came back on, and with his short ball had Giles playing a definitely unorthodox stroke – a sliced edge over Gilchrist's head for four.\n\nSingles were taken to end the over, but McGrath was to bowl the last over of the game, with England still needing ten to win. Things got easier for England when McGrath overstepped with the first ball of the over, Gough making contact and running the single to cut the target by two – the no-ball for overstepping and the run single – and the no-ball meant McGrath still had to bowl six balls in the over. Giles then played and missed, before hitting a single, and then Gough drove the two next balls to cover for two. Suddenly, England only needed three off two – and were, incredibly, in a winning position again. But Gough's next shot was right back to McGrath, who took it up well and tossed it at the stumps, running out Gough and meaning that McGrath would bowl to Ashley Giles – and England still required three to win. The ball hit Giles' pads, ran away down the off side, and Giles and Harmison ran all they could to scamper two leg byes – and tie the game.\n\nEngland were lucky to win the toss and get a chance to bowl under cloudy skies at Headingley, as they beat Australia by nine wickets to take their second victory in five ODIs so far. Putting Australia in to bat, they didn't get immediate reward – as especially Darren Gough was smashed about by Adam Gilchrist, but the run rate at least stayed around four an over. And with Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff removing the openers in successive overs, things looked brighter for the English. Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn added 39 for the next wicket, but in 11 overs, all while the English captain Michael Vaughan set attacking fields according to the new power play rules.\n\nEngland all-rounder Paul Collingwood came on as third-change bowler, and used the helpful conditions to incite Ponting's demise, as Kevin Pietersen held a catch to dismiss the Australian captain for 14, and Collingwood continued to end with four wickets for 34 runs, as Australia slumped from 107 for 2 to 159 for 6 – all wickets courtesy of Collingwood. However, Michael Hussey showed his skills from number seven yet again, as he made a 52-ball 46 – while the ball was still moving around due to the cloud cover – and lifted Australia to 219 for 7.\n\nThe English reply was initially jittery. The pace of Brett Lee and accuracy of Glenn McGrath shook the English opening batsmen Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss. Trescothick, for example, was caught off a no-ball from Lee, but survived, as the openers lasted nearly 25 overs – before Strauss was caught behind off Brad Hogg for 41. By that time, however, the sun had come out, the ball didn't swing much in the air, and as Lee kept on bowling no-balls – seven in total – things simply wouldn't work out for Australia. Trescothick used 132 balls to bring up his century, skipper Michael Vaughan made a healthy contribution with 59 not out, and England brought up the winning total with four overs to spare.\n\nRicky Ponting, Australia's captain, had so far had a difficult series against the English. In five innings this summer, his highest score was 34, in the no-result at Edgbaston, and his batting average was a meagre 16.40. However, on a Lord's track that suited the batsmen, he was back into his old magnificent form, guiding Australia back on track to victory, and levelling the NatWest Challenge.\n\nIt started well for Australia, too. Including Michael Kasprowicz in the squad and gambling on winning the toss and subbing one of their bowlers off, they won it – and Kasprowicz got immediate reward. After the English openers had survived the opening overs of McGrath and Lee to be 25 for 0 after eight overs, Kasprowicz was brought on, and Strauss chopped an inside edge onto his own stumps. Nine balls and three runs later, captain Michael Vaughan was hit on the pads by an inswinging delivery from Glenn McGrath and was out for 1. Marcus Trescothick and Kevin Pietersen soon followed to the pavilion, and England were – yet again – staring down the barrel at 45 for 4.\n\nHowever, England weren't undone that easily. Waiting for Jason Gillespie, who had been conceding many runs all series, Andrew Flintoff and Paul Collingwood paired up for a calm 103 in a little over 20 overs, before Collingwood became Brett Lee's second victim of the day, luring Collingwood to attempt a cut shot off a fast, short ball and edging to keeper Adam Gilchrist. England's resistance didn't end, however, and despite Lee ripping out wickets – ending with five for 41 – the lower-order combined, eking out 30 from the last 21 balls to lift England to a somewhat defensible total of 223 for 8.\n\nAnd, when Andrew Flintoff was brought on as the fourth bowler to be used in six overs, and removed Gilchrist with his second ball of the day, things looked hopeful for England, but that was as good as it ever got. Ricky Ponting smashed 14 fours and a six on his way to 111, making a century off 105 balls, Michael Vaughan was forced to wait with the power play overs, Simon Katich, Damien Martyn and Andrew Symonds played well-paced innings, and England found themselves unable to contain the Australians. The end was always in sight, eventually coming with 34 balls remaining, Darren Gough bowling a no-ball – his third of the day – to gift the game to Australia. It was symptomatic of Gough's poor series, and indeed, he had Gilchrist bowled off a no-ball in the very first over. His bowling analysis for the game read 6.2–0–43–1.\n\nThis match was eerily similar to the one two days earlier – except that Jason Gillespie actually got rewards with the ball, and the batsman to play himself into form was Adam Gilchrist – however, both England and Australia picked batsmen as their supersubs, just like on 10 July. Australia won the toss, chose to field to gain an extra batsman, and had England on the rack.\n\nThe game was won in the first few overs. The pitch, as Surrey and Hampshire showed in a game played three days later, had a par score well in excess of 300. However, Glenn McGrath's first four overs were maidens, and his fifth over only failed to be because Jason Gillespie dropped a skier, much to the amusement of the crowd. With Brett Lee bowling well and picking up the early wicket of Marcus Trescothick for a duck, England were well behind on the run rate from the start.\n\nThey never recovered. Despite another skier being dropped, this time by Adam Gilchrist, and the crowd enjoying Gillespie dropping more catches whilst practising in the field, Australia's dominance and fine fielding on the ground saw more England wickets fall. In 27.5 overs, they only mustered 93 runs – for the loss of six wickets, with Michael Vaughan, Andrew Strauss, Andrew Flintoff, Paul Collingwood and Geraint Jones all out. A desperate situation meant England had to use their substitute, putting on Vikram Solanki for bowler Simon Jones – and Solanki helped save England to some respectability, along with Kevin Pietersen. Solanki made an unbeaten 53 and Pietersen 74 as England posted 228 for 7.\n\nOn a flat, unresponsive pitch, England's bowlers (now without the subbed-off Jones) were helpless. Gilchrist smashed an 81-ball ton, with an array of shots all around the ground, and eventually ended on 121 not out. Three of the English bowlers conceded more than six an over – Steve Harmison, with 81 runs off 9.5 overs, Darren Gough, with 37 off four, and Ashley Giles with 64 off 10. The two wickets the English got – Matthew Hayden caught behind for 31 and Ricky Ponting stumped for 44 – were largely pointless.\n\nIn all, it was a comprehensive victory for Australia, probably one of their easiest on the entire tour – possibly excluding the 19-over demolition of Bangladesh in game six of the group stage, with the biggest excitement being when the officials and players were presented to His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh in the break. The Duke was at the ground to officially open the new OCS stand at the Oval. He took the opportunity to lead the tributes to umpire David Shepherd, on his retirement from international umpiring. Former British Prime Minister Sir John Major and current Australian Prime Minister John Howard also sent tributes to Shepherd.\n\nMatch abandoned without a ball bowled\n\nA capacity crowd of 4,500 was at The Grange in Edinburgh to watch the local heroes of the Scottish cricket team face off with the world's highest-ranked team, Australia. The game was to be a highlight of the Scottish season, with the ground authorities reporting that they could have sold the tickets three times over. The BBC had won the rights to broadcast the match in Scotland, making it the first cricket match to be broadcast on the BBC since 1999.\n\nHowever, rain poured down steadily, although a buoyant crowd still queued to enter the ground. This weather first cut the match down to 20 overs and later started again to prevent any play whatsoever. Although Cricket Scotland had insured against rain to alleviate pecuniary disadvantage, the lack of a match represented a lost opportunity to help develop the game north of the English border. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nMatch drawn\n\nAustralia were having difficulty choosing between an out-of-form Jason Gillespie (8 wickets at a bowling average of 50.37 in the ODIs) and an almost equally out-of-form Michael Kasprowicz (7 wickets at 34.29), and thus this match with Leicestershire was a fight between the two to keep the place in the Test team. But the two almost exclusively failed to take wickets, with only Brett Lee and Stuart MacGill taking more than two for the match. Lee opened the game by removing Darren Robinson lbw for a golden duck, and Leicestershire eventually subsided for 217 – Australian Chris Rogers top-scoring with 56, Lee taking four for 53. Australia then amassed 582 for 7 over the next day and a half, Justin Langer (115), Ricky Ponting (119) and Damien Martyn with an unbeaten 154 all making centuries. However, it was Rogers who was to make the highest score of the match, as he added with Robinson for 247 for the first wicket – and went on to make a career highest score of 209, right in front of the Australian selectors. When the fifth Leicestershire wicket fell with the Leicestershire score on 363, both teams agreed to a draw.\n\nA low-scoring first day of cricket at Lord's included two batting collapses, first from Australia and then from England who got their go at batting just before tea. Ricky Ponting won the toss and chose to bat, and after Steve Harmison had shaken up the opening batsmen early on, hitting Australia's batsmen with bouncers, in particular one that had Justin Langer on the elbow, a procession of wickets began. Matthew Hoggard was inaccurate, but the early swing under the cloud suited him, and the ball that he did get on line swung between bat and pad to smash into Matthew Hayden's off stump. Australia still scored quickly, helped by aggressive field placings from England, but Harmison got the reward for short and pacy bowling when Ricky Ponting edged him to Andrew Strauss at third slip for 9. Langer, who had looked immaculate all morning and taken on the bowlers, was next to depart, Michael Vaughan getting reward with his bowling changes as Andrew Flintoff lured Langer into an expansive pull to Harmison at square leg. And when Simon Jones was brought on in the 16th over, he got an immediate reward, with Damien Martyn gone for 2. Another man came and went before lunch, Michael Clarke, and Australia were five down after the first session of play.\n\nAdam Gilchrist, Simon Katich and Shane Warne all played a part in getting Australia past 100, with their scores in the 20s, but Harmison – coming back for a second spell – wrapped them up with variations in length along with his ever-reliant pace. He finished with five for 43, allowing Glenn McGrath to be stranded on 10 not out, and McGrath was to take centre stage when England batted. They survived six overs until tea, scoring ten runs, but McGrath, who bowled his usual accurate line and length and got the odd ball to move, reaped massive rewards. Marcus Trescothick fell first ball after tea, edging to slip, and Strauss fell in similar fashion three balls later. Michael Vaughan and Ian Bell were shaken up, but survived six overs – before McGrath started the torture again. They were both bowled, as was Andrew Flintoff, and England had lost five wickets for 21 runs, with five of their front line batsmen out in single figures. However, Kevin Pietersen and Geraint Jones gave England a glimmer of hope, pairing up for 58 before Brett Lee's reverse-swing with the old ball induced a backward edge off Jones' bat to Adam Gilchrist. Ashley Giles hit two quick boundaries, but a short pacy ball from Lee undid him, and England were 92 for 7 overnight – needing 98 for the last three wickets to get level with Australia.\n\nEngland's difficulties continued in the morning. Despite McGrath not getting nearly as much swing, Hoggard departed for an eight-ball duck, cutting a delivery from Shane Warne to Hayden in the slips. Throwing caution to the wind, Pietersen launched himself into his natural game, taking 21 runs off seven deliveries before finally being out caught by Damien Martyn, a splendid catch just metres off the ropes, as England looked to subside for 130. However, in yet another twist, Simon Jones and Harmison fought back with some streaky accumulation, pairing up for 33 to reduce Australia's lead to 35 runs. England also got a good start fielding, Pietersen having a flat throw at the stumps to run out Langer for 6, but Hayden and Ricky Ponting rebuilt well.\n\nIn fact, the entire top order apart from Langer batted to high scores, but Clarke needed an extra life to do it. Pietersen dropped him on 21, with the Australian score 139 for 3, and instead of England getting the vital breakthrough Clarke and Martyn ran away with it, hitting 155 in 34.3 overs. Flintoff was smashed to all corners, and his figures read for 84 runs in 19 overs, but England fought back late in the day – in the frantic last ten overs, started by an inside-edge from Clarke off Hoggard, Australia lost four wickets for 24 runs. However, Australia had gained a lead of 314 runs by the end of the second day, and still had Katich there on 10.\n\nFour overs into the morning, Ashley Giles returned what could arguably be said to be his most useful contribution of the match, having Brett Lee run out for 8. However, the always defensive Jason Gillespie proved too difficult to get out for England, Harmison menacing him with bouncers and yorkers but not managing it, and it was the quietly toiling Jones who finally got his reward with an away-swinger that crashed into Gillespie's off stump – after having a number of catches dropped, one especially simple one by namesake Geraint. Glenn McGrath and Katich continued with a partnership of 43, as England was set what would be a world record 420 to win.\n\nThey started positively, riding their luck and good favour with the umpires – a number of lbw appeals were turned down both before and after tea – as Strauss and Trescothick paired up for 80 for the first wicket before Strauss edged a classic paceman's short ball from Lee back into the bowler's waiting hands. Michael Vaughan got nicely off the mark with a four with his second ball, however, suggesting that England would be playing positively to get the target – but Lee and Warne kept pounding. Trescothick departed for 44, edging a straight ball from Warne to first slip – having taken him for ten in the previous over – and Bell was left hopelessly plumb to a ball that didn't turn. When Vaughan – who had failed to buy a run off the last 23 deliveries – was bowled comprehensively by Lee, there was nowhere to hide for England, and not even an unbeaten 42 from Pietersen to see England to stumps could hide the inevitable – that England needed 301 for the last five wickets, with a world-class bowling attack at the other end.\n\nRain frustrated both Australia and neutral fans on the morning of the fourth day, but after four hours the sun finally broke through and the covers were taken off. It only took ten overs for Australia to wrap up England's innings, McGrath taking four of the five wickets required and Warne the last – Giles, Hoggard, Harmison and Simon Jones all gone for ducks – as England could only add 24 runs, 22 of them from Pietersen who was left stranded on an unbeaten 64 to have a Test batting average of 121 after the first match.\n\nMatch drawn\n\nThe first day only allowed one over of play, after Vikram Solanki sent Australia in to bat and Justin Langer hit a four off Kabir Ali. On the second day, Langer and Matthew Hayden accumulated 110 for the first wicket, and runs just kept flowing as the Australians made 402 in a day – Brad Haddin top-scoring with 94, Jason Gillespie making an unbeaten 53 including two sixes, while Nadeem Malik got the best bowling figures three wickets for 78. Ali, meanwhile, was punished, to end with 124 conceded runs in 20 overs.\n\nWorcestershire got off to a good start on the final day, Stephen Moore and Solanki making 85 for the fourth wicket after Jason Gillespie shook the top order early on. However, Michael Kasprowicz took four quick wickets as Worcestershire imploded from 133 for 3 to 151 for 9, while a bit of late order slogging from James Pipe and Malik sent the score to 187. Malik was last out, caught and bowled by Kasprowicz to complete the Australian's five-wicket haul and mark the end of the Worcestershire innings. Australian captain Ricky Ponting opted for batting practice, and the Australians made 168 for 2 before stumps, Ponting scoring an unbeaten 59 while Michael Clarke, who was promoted to opener, also repaired a first-innings failure, making 59 off 55 balls before being run out.\n\nThe psychological battles before the match saw Australia planting many stories in the press about England already being in trouble. England kept quieter, until just before the game stories appeared about how the Edgbaston game would be decided at the toss: whichever side won it would choose to bowl first and would win. England's mind games paid dividends when Ricky Ponting did just that, as Michael Vaughan admitted that if he had won the toss, he would have batted, and as the match progressed, it became clearer and clearer that the pitch would take plenty of turn near the end.\n\nEngland took advantage of being inserted and came back strongly, especially considering the 239-run drubbing they had received at Lord's a couple of weeks earlier. The Australian bowlers were smashed to all corners on the first day as, for the first time in their 493-Test history, Australia conceded more than 400 runs in a first day of Test cricket. The English mentality seemed to be to attack from the outset, and it was helped by the freak injury that Glenn McGrath sustained before the match. During a warm-up (playing rugby), the paceman accidentally stood on a cricket ball, tearing ankle ligaments. Australia had to field Michael Kasprowicz as replacement, and on a pitch where inaccurate bowling was immediately punished, McGrath's line and length would surely have been useful.\n\nInstead, Marcus Trescothick made innumerable smashes off Brett Lee to the cover boundary. Andrew Strauss preferred Jason Gillespie for his runs, and their 112-run opening partnership was the highest by England in the Ashes series so far this year – indeed, the second-highest of the series thus far, only beaten by Damien Martyn and Michael Clarke's 155 at Lord's. They continued on their fine form from Lord's, where they had made 80 in the second innings, and the jitters from the one-day series seemed to have vanished with McGrath. Admittedly, Trescothick was caught off a no-ball on 32, but few remembered that as he crafted his way to 90 – being second out shortly after lunch, with the score 164 for 2, after only 32.3 overs.\n\nEngland lost both Ian Bell, who continued his relatively poor Ashes series with his third successive single-figure score, and Michael Vaughan, who pulled a short Gillespie delivery to the hands of Lee, in the space of the next five overs, but still pounded on. Kevin Pietersen, in his second Test match, hit 10 fours and one six, and forged a 103-run partnership in 105 balls with Andrew Flintoff, which turned the match back to England's favour. Flintoff's 68 was scored quickly, including five sixes, and again Lee got the most stick – he was taken for 26 in the 18 balls he faced.\n\nLee did get one wicket, though, and Australia could have been forgiven for thinking it was the most important. Pietersen pulled to Simon Katich for 71, off just 76 balls, and with the score on 342 for 7, England would have to get something extraordinary out of the tail to get past 400. But they did – Steve Harmison smacked two fours and a six in an entertaining, if brief, 17, and Simon Jones stuck around with Matthew Hoggard for a vital last-wicket partnership of 32, Jones making 19 not out. Shane Warne finally got the better of Hoggard, but England had made 407, in just under 80 overs. The Australian openers took to the field for the last half-hour of the day. However, heavy rain prevented another ball being bowled on the first day.\n\nHowever, the quick scoring and the first Test result led many people to believe that Australia would come back with a vengeance on the second day of the match. Instead, Steve Harmison bowled a maiden over first up to Justin Langer, and Matthew Hayden holed out to Harmison's new-ball partner Matthew Hoggard for a golden duck – the first of Hayden's career. The dismissal was to set the tone of the innings. Although Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, the umpire's finger went up twice more before lunch – Ponting swept to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Damien Martyn was run out taking a risky single for 20. Once again, Vaughan was in the action, hitting the stumps with a throw from mid off. Langer and Michael Clarke continued after lunch in the same vein, but again, a couple of quick wickets – Clarke edging a quicker ball from Ashley Giles behind and Simon Katich falling in the same way to Andrew Flintoff swung it England's way. At 208 for 5, the Australians were struggling, but another good partnership between Langer and Gilchrist saw them to tea with no further loss.\n\nThe pair looked to close England's lead, but again the England bowlers intervened – this time in the shape of the invisible man in England's attack, Simon Jones, who got plenty of reverse swing and used that to trap Langer with a yorker – gone for 82, which was to be Australia's highest score in the innings. Australia's tail – thought to be strengthened by the absence of McGrath, were all dismissed for single-figure scores, Andrew Flintoff taking the two last men lbw with the two last balls, although there was some argument about the first dismissal.\n\nHowever, England got their 99-run lead and continued to hack away at the Australian bowlers before stumps. After Trescothick and Strauss had smashed boundaries at will against the seamers, Ponting brought on Warne in the seventh over, and Warne broke through with his second ball of the match – a leg break that came into the left-hander's stumps and broke them completely, and Strauss was bowled for 6. Nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard survived four balls to end the day – England still leading by 124, with nine wickets in hand.\n\nThe third day was just as exhilarating to spectators as the first two; a total of 17 wickets fell as Shane Warne and Andrew Flintoff took centre stage in an enthralling contest. First up, however, it was Brett Lee, who shattered England with three quick wickets – Trescothick slashed at a wide delivery, skipper Vaughan disappointed yet again with the bat as he failed to cover his stumps to a straight one, and Hoggard naturally had to go eventually – edging to Hayden in the slips for 1.\n\nEngland were shaken, with the score at 31 for 4, and with Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen at the crease. Pietersen could consider himself lucky to survive, after a suggestion he had been caught first ball. He survived, and went on to make 20, only to be given out off a similar situation from Shane Warne. His 41-run partnership with Bell steadied things somewhat, and there were hopes among England fans that Bell would make his first significant score against the tourists. Instead, he fell two overs after Pietersen, having given the tiniest of edges to Gilchrist for 21.\n\nSo, with the score at 75 for 6, England once again needed a big partnership, this time from Flintoff and wicket-keeper Geraint Jones. The pair saw England to lunch, but Flintoff had suffered a shoulder injury and looked in obvious pain. In the first over after lunch, Jones gave an edge to Ponting – seven down for 101. Giles batted responsibly, padding up to Warne, but eventually felt the need to play at one, which Hayden held with relative ease. Harmison came and went, facing one delivery, and it was all up to Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff to see England to a challenging target.\n\nThat they did. Jones kept his head, managing 12 runs in his 42-minute stay at the crease with some streaky fours, while Flintoff smacked Lee everywhere. Flintoff also took runs off Kasprowicz, with one over yielding 20 runs for England, including a couple of no-balls. At one point during Flintoff's innings, Ponting had nine men on the boundary, something rarely seen in cricket. One six hit by Flintoff landed on top of the stands. Flintoff ended with 73 – the only man to pass 25 for England – before being bowled by Warne. Warne finished with stunning figures of six for 46 from 23.1 overs, having bowled unchanged from the seventh over till the end – but, as luck and Australia's batsmen would have it, his failure to get Flintoff out earlier would be crucial.\n\nMatthew Hayden and Justin Langer started positively, taking runs off the occasional bad balls that were served up by Harmison, Hoggard and Giles, and before anyone noticed, they had racked up 47 for no loss, and were well on the way to chasing the target of 282. Then, Flintoff came in to bowl his first over. The ball was hurled down the pitch, and swung enough to deceive the Australian batsmen – Flintoff got Langer and Ponting out in the same over, and Australia were struggling again, the score on 48 for 2.\n\nA few overs of relative calm followed, Hayden forging runs with Martyn but never looking too assured, and his dismissal, came in an over where Australia had actually looked on top. However, Simon Jones got the last laugh over Hayden – only to later be reprimanded by the ICC for his celebrations. England kept muscling on, and despite never playing on top of their game they got four more wickets before the scheduled close of play. Giles got two of those, dismissing Katich and Gilchrist, and then an inswinging ball from Flintoff took care of Gillespie, who was trapped lbw.\n\nAn extra half-hour of play was allowed, as a result was nearing, but Warne and Clarke defied the English. Warne was lucky on more than one occasion, playing streaky shots that could easily have got him out, but he did smash Giles for 12 in one over. He was not out overnight – however, Steve Harmison, bowling his third spell of the day, brought the third day's proceedings to an end with a slow delivery that was not read correctly by Michael Clarke, who missed the ball completely to be bowled. England now only needed two wickets on the fourth day – Australia, however, needed 107 runs for the victory.\n\nOn the fourth day, Australia defied all predictions with a 45-run partnership between Warne and Lee, before Warne was forced back onto his stumps by Flintoff to get dismissed hit wicket. Kasprowicz came in and supported Lee well, fending off aggressive bowling from Flintoff and Harmison. The pair had England on the back foot as their victory target neared closer and closer, edging virtually everything. With three to win, and three results possible, Harmison had Kasprowicz caught behind, with replays showing that the ball hit the batsman's hand when it was off the bat. If the hand had been on the bat, it would have been a correct decision – as it stood, it was incorrect to give him out. This would prove to be a crucial error in the context of the series. England were thus victors – if in almost the most narrow way possible – and the series very much alive.\n\nRather than engaging in the victory celebrations, the immediate reaction of Flintoff to the winning dismissal was to console the despondent batsmen – a gesture which was widely commented upon as indicative of the good sportsmanship and mutual respect between the teams which characterised the series.\n\nEngland's two run victory is the narrowest result in Ashes cricket history (there have been two Tests won by a margin of only three runs). It is also the second-narrowest-run victory in all Test cricket history. (other narrow victories given here)\n\nWith the series square after England's close win in the second match at Edgbaston in Birmingham, the stakes of the third Test at Old Trafford in Manchester had risen significantly. The day began with England winning the toss, and choosing to bat first, thus giving Shane Warne a chance to become the first man to take 600 Test wickets in England's first innings, and he did so against Marcus Trescothick who mistimed a sweep shot and was caught behind by Australian wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist, earning Warne a standing ovation from the Old Trafford crowd.\n\nAfter naming an unchanged line-up, England were immediately faced by the pairing of Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee. There were doubts about whether these could play before the match started, due to injuries sustained earlier, but they both passed fitness tests. England's wickets fell slowly, with many a missed opportunity for Australia helping the hosts to run up a big first innings total. This was also helped by a fruitful partnership between Trescothick and Michael Vaughan, who added 137 before Trescothick was dismissed after lunch. Vaughan became the first man in the series to get a century.\n\nThe frustrated Australia team faced a fearless England side who challenged them at every turn, and recovered nicely even after the dismissals of Trescothick and Vaughan, who couldn't resist smacking a full toss from Katich straight to McGrath at the boundary. Vaughan was dismissed after 166 runs, which was destined to be the highest individual score in the series. Australia were also faced with a more defiant Ian Bell, who had struggled in the first two Tests. Picking up where Vaughan left off after tea, Bell, Kevin Pietersen and nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard closed out the day for England with the score 341 for 5.\n\nBell did not add to his overnight score, being given out caught behind in controversial circumstances, as replays indicated he did not make contact with the ball. Following a brief rain interval England then lost two more wickets just before lunch, Andrew Flintoff after scoring a quick-fire 46 and Geraint Jones for 42. After lunch Australia quickly dispatched the remaining two wickets for just a further 10 runs, bowling England out for a score of 444, with Glenn McGrath finishing on his worst ever Test figures of nought for 86.\n\nAustralia started their innings tentatively with Matthew Hoggard dropping a low catch Matthew Hayden off his own bowling. Just before tea Australia lost their first wicket with Hayden out caught at short leg from Ashley Giles' first over. After tea Australia lost another couple of wickets, Ricky Ponting caught for seven and Hayden given out lbw for 34. Gilchrist put on 30 before edging the first ball of Simon Jones' spell to Geraint Jones.\n\nThis brought in Michael Clarke who had been recuperating at the team hotel after damaging his back on the first day. Due to this injury, Clarke needed Hayden to act as a runner. Warne made inroads with the bat, just like at Edgbaston four days previously, but Clarke only managed to add seven runs before being deceived by a slower ball from Simon Jones. Warne and Jason Gillespie saw the day out with Warne finishing on 45 not out.\n\nThe day finished with Australia on 214 for 7, 230 behind and needing another 31 runs to avoid a follow-on. The score was adjusted from 210 overnight due to an umpire failing to signal a four byes.\n\nRain delayed the start of play until 16:00 BST, and even then only 8 overs were possible before play was again suspended, although a further 6 overs were bowled later on before yet more rain meant that play was abandoned for the day. Australia had the better of the short day's play, adding 50 runs without loss to pass the follow-on target, although Warne was lucky to survive on two occasions thanks to errors by Geraint Jones: when Warne had 55 he missed a relatively straightforward stumping opportunity, and on 68 he was dropped after edging a ball from Flintoff. Australia closed on 264 for 7, still 180 in arrears, but England probably felt that they missed several opportunities to put the game beyond their opponents.\n\nHaving been hampered by a rain-shortened day three, the Australians were ready to put more wood to the ball on day four, and they did not disappoint. Warne continued his march towards his maiden Test century before holing out with a hook shot to a well placed Giles at 90. Simon Jones mopped up the other two wickets to bowl Australia out for 302, Jones finishing the innings with a career best figures of six for 53.\n\nThe English opening batsmen of Andrew Strauss and Marcus Trescothick began England's response, scoring 26 before lunch. After lunch, Trescothick played on to be bowled after scoring 41 giving McGrath his first wicket of the match. Strauss put together a fine century, his sixth from just 17 matches, scoring 106 before getting out caught. Gilchrist demonstrated how difficult wicket-keeping was by missing two stumping opportunities to remove Bell and failing to hold a catch to remove Flintoff. Bell capitalised on Gilchrist's errors, partnering Strauss for 28 overs and recording a well-deserved 65. Geraint Jones also added a swift 27 with England more concerned about scoring quickly than staying at the crease, and England declared on 280 to give them a spell at Australia in the evening and a chance of winning the match the next day. McGrath recorded another five-wicket haul in an innings, but was expensive, giving away 115 runs. Warne, despite bowling 25 overs, failed to take a wicket, recording figures of nought for 74.\n\nAustralia needed 423 to win, which would be a record fourth innings total to win a match. Australia saw out the last 10 overs without losing a wicket and put 24 runs, leaving 399.\n\nEnglish hopes of a win were high, and 20,000 people were locked out of the stadium in addition to the 23,000 capacity crowd. Australia started the day needing 399 runs from 98 overs if they were to claim an unlikely victory. The day started poorly for them with Langer falling for 14 on the seventh ball of the day, nicking a ball delivered by Matthew Hoggard behind to Geraint Jones. Ponting narrowly survived being run out early on and this proved crucial in the context of the match as the momentum gradually swung in Australia's direction. At one point Australia racked up runs at such a rate that a win became a real possibility. Despite losing Clarke and Jason Gillespie in quick succession to send the team to 264 for 7, Ponting battled on before eventually succumbing to Harmison after seven hours on the crease to record the first Australian century of the series with a score of 156. This was good enough to earn Man of the Match honours.\n\nAfter the dismissal of Ponting, Australia were 354 for 9 with only four overs remaining, and another thrilling climax occurred with England having a real chance of snatching victory in similar fashion to the second Test. However, the unfancied pairing of Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath handled the remaining 24 deliveries to finish on 371 for 9, fifty-two short of victory but sufficient to draw the game and leave the series tied at 1–1. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nMatch drawn\n\nAustralia scored more than four times as many runs for each wicket as their hosts Northamptonshire at Northampton, yet the two-day time limit and Australia's hunger for batting practice ensured a draw. Northamptonshire won the toss, and put their guests in to bat, and Steffan Jones got two early breakthroughs as Australia were set back to 69 for 3 – Damien Martyn having spent only 14 minutes at the crease for his 26 – but Matthew Hayden and Michael Clarke spent good time in the middle making their centuries. The Australians declared on 374 for 6, and immediately dug into the Northamptonshire batsmen, who were effectively reduced to 48 for 5 when Tim Roberts retired hurt for 18. Glenn McGrath only bowled 11 overs, but used his time well, taking three for 24, while Shaun Tait and Brett Lee also got among the wickets with two each. Northamptonshire were bowled out for 169, and Australia opted to bat again, Simon Katich and Justin Langer both making half-centuries before the final day's play ended and the game was drawn. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nGlenn McGrath was once again ruled out due to injury, this time to his elbow, and Australia also dropped the out-of-form Jason Gillespie, leaving them with a seam attack of Brett Lee, debutant Shaun Tait and Michael Kasprowicz. England, having been on top in the last two Tests, were unchanged.\n\nEngland won the toss and chose to bat, and they got off to a flyer. Boosted by no-balls from the seamers – a total of 18 before lunch – Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss made hay quickly, and enjoyed batting on a pitch which gave the bowlers no aid. They recorded their second 100-run opening partnership of the series, before Strauss was freakishly dismissed for 35, sweeping Shane Warne onto his boot and into Matthew Hayden's waiting hands at slip – a wicket confirmed by the third umpire. Michael Vaughan continued on his fine form from Old Trafford, though, punishing bad balls from Brett Lee to go into lunch with his score on 14. Trescothick, meanwhile, rode his luck, as he was bowled off a no-ball on 55, much to Lee's displeasure. At lunch, England were 129 for 1.\n\nOnly 3.1 overs were possible in the afternoon session due to rain. Coming back after tea, England immediately lost two wickets to Shaun Tait, who used the cloud cover to good effect and swung the ball well. However, Michael Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen batted well together for a 67-run partnership, although they were each dropped once. Towards the end of the day, Ricky Ponting brought himself on, and his medium pace yielded a wicket – that of Vaughan for 58. Overnight, the match was evenly poised with England 229 for 4.\n\nAustralia dismissed Pietersen at the beginning of the morning's play, edging a full outswinger from Lee through to wicket-keeper Gilchrist. But an unbeaten century partnership from Andrew Flintoff and Geraint Jones took England's score to 344 for 5 at lunch.\n\nAfter lunch, the pair continued to score quickly for another hour, and extended their partnership to 177 before Flintoff was lbw to Tait for 102, his first Test century against Australia. The loss of Flintoff did not deter the English, as Jones continued to hit runs through the off side on the way to his highest score against the Australians, making 85 before he was caught and bowled by Kasprowicz. The next two wickets fell quickly, but a stubborn last-wicket partnership of 23 between Matthew Hoggard and Simon Jones – including an incident where the ball hit the stumps but the bails failed to fall off – saw England to 477 all out at tea.\n\nIn the evening session, England's bowlers, especially Matthew Hoggard, managed to find much more swing than the Australian bowlers had done, and ripped through the Australian top order. The first three wickets fell in a crucial period of 11 balls (although the third, which dismissed Damien Martyn lbw, was a debatable decision – television replays indicated that the ball might have hit the bat before the body). By stumps Australia had been reduced to 99 for 5 to complete an excellent day for England.\n\nSimon Katich and Adam Gilchrist decided that attack was the best form of defence, adding 58 in only 8.5 overs in the morning, before England came back to take the next four wickets for the addition of only 18 runs, leaving Australia perilously placed at 175 for 9. Simon Jones was the main culprit, using swing to good effect as he removed Katich and Warne in successive balls, and then had Kasprowicz clean bowled. Brett Lee added 47 in 44 balls, including three huge sixes, to take Australia's score to 218, before he was caught off Simon Jones's bowling to give Jones his fifth wicket of the innings. Despite their aggressive batting, Australia therefore finished the first innings 259 runs behind.\n\nMichael Vaughan then gambled, by enforcing the follow-on on the visitors (the first time Australia had followed on in 17 years). By lunch, Australia had reached 14 without loss in their second innings, and they powered on in the afternoon session, only losing Matthew Hayden and adding 100 more runs before tea. For England, the afternoon session was their worst of the match – to compound their misery, Simon Jones showed signs of injury, and Andrew Strauss dropped Justin Langer on 38.\n\nIn the evening session, England managed to take three wickets, but also dropped a catch and missed a stumping. Australia thus finished the day still 37 runs in arrears but with six wickets still in hand. Simon Jones also went off the field during the evening session with an ankle injury, and was taken to hospital for an ankle scan. While Jones was off the field receiving attention, substitute fielder Gary Pratt ran out Australian captain Ricky Ponting, who verbally expressed his displeasure at England's use of subs to the players, umpires and administrators as he left the field.\n\nDay Four began in earnest with Michael Clarke and Simon Katich continuing their partnership from the previous day. However, Katich had already twice flirted with dismissal, saved only by chance both times. In the words of BBC cricket commentator Henry Blofeld, \"It's very much a game of chess – white-flannelled figures on green grass.\" The English and the Australians proceeded into a cold war for a good part of the morning, with England attempting to frustrate the Australian batting, but with the latter refusing to take the bait. England's lead slowly evaporated without a wicket falling, but Matthew Hoggard's taking of Clarke's and then Adam Gilchrist's scalps on either side of the lunch break swung the initiative back into England's hands.\n\nThe injury to Simon Jones became somewhat obvious as the pacers struggled to capture the magic that Jones had created the previous day that had forced Australia to follow on. Despite this, the Australian run rate remained low as both sides stared each other down. Mistakes by Geraint Jones and Kevin Pietersen were quickly nullified by the dismissal of Warne for 45 and Kasprowicz for 19, and after a few overs' resistance Tait was bowled middle stump for 4, leaving 129 for the English to chase after tea.\nEngland then proceeded to send the game into a nailbiter – English wickets fell quickly as Shane Warne took four wickets (including those of Marcus Trescothick (27), Michael Vaughan (0) and Andrew Strauss (23)). Brett Lee dismissed Ian Bell (3) and at 57 for 4 England were in trouble. Andrew Flintoff (26) and Kevin Pietersen (23) then steadied the ship with an invaluable partnership of 46 before both fell in quick succession to Lee. Despite Geraint Jones (3) being dismissed cheaply, the partnership of Ashley Giles (7) and Matthew Hoggard (8) guided the English home. Man of the match honours went to Andrew Flintoff, but more importantly this gave the English a crucial 2–1 lead heading back to London for the fifth and final Test, ensuring that they could not lose the series. However, with the Ashes going to Australia in the event of a drawn series, there was still all to play for at The Oval.\n\nMatch drawn\n\nBoth sides surpassed 500 in their innings in this two-day match, which included four centuries and expensive bowling figures on either side – as Jason Gillespie was the most economical, with an analysis reading 22–3–80–0. Essex batted first at Chelmsford after winning the toss, and Will Jefferson added 140 for the first wicket with Alastair Cook before being bowled by Michael Kasprowicz. However, the second-wicket partnership was worth even more than the first. Cook slashed 33 fours and one six on his way to 214 – which would have been his highest first-class score if the match had had first class status – and added 270 with Ravi Bopara.\n\nAfter 105 overs, Essex declared with the score 502 for 4, giving Australia the turn to exploit bad bowling and a flat pitch. Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden added 213 for the first wicket, Hayden went on to make a 118-ball 150 before retiring, while Brad Hodge was allowed to top score with 166 from number 4, including a 161-run fifth-wicket partnership with Brad Haddin. For Essex, James Middlebrook got the best bowling figures with two for 110, including Adam Gilchrist for 8, as Australia finished the day's batting practice with the score 561 for 6.\n\nAustralia named Glenn McGrath, recovered from an elbow injury, to replace Michael Kasprowicz. England's Simon Jones did not recover from his ankle injury from the previous Test in time to be included in the England team, and was replaced after much speculation by all-rounder Paul Collingwood, in preference to specialist fast bowler James Anderson.\n\nThe final match to decide the fate of the legendary Ashes urn finally began, and the proverbial first blood was drawn by England as Michael Vaughan won his third toss of the series (much to the delight of the Brit Oval crowd). Vaughan elected to have his English side to bat first, and the English first innings got underway. Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss added 82 for the first wicket, as England's batsmen looked to take on the Australians, but subtle spin variations bowled from Shane Warne yielded three wickets as England went to lunch on 115 for 3.\n\nShane Warne continued after lunch by taking the wicket of Kevin Pietersen for 14. Andrew Flintoff emerged to form a vital partnership of 143 with Andrew Strauss, before to falling to Glenn McGrath for 72 an hour after tea. Strauss made his second century of the series, before being dismissed by Shane Warne off an acrobatic catch by Simon Katich. The day ended with Geraint Jones and Ashley Giles at the crease, with England 319 for 7. Certain forecasts for London called for showers sometime during the weekend, which, it was thought, might wipe up to a day of action or more from the ledger.\n\nDay two began positively for the Australians, with Jones being bowled for 25 off Brett Lee, and Matthew Hoggard managing a meagre 2 before being dismissed by McGrath. However, Ashley Giles and Steve Harmison frustrated the Australians by taking the score past 370, before Warne trapped Giles lbw shortly before midday, leaving England all out for 373.\n\nThe Australian first innings got off to a solid start, with Justin Langer forging a 100 partnership with fellow opener Matthew Hayden – the first opening-partnership century of the series by the Australian cricket team. Langer played some blistering strokes off Giles' bowling in particular, but survived a sharp chance to Marcus Trescothick at first slip. The Australians were offered the light immediately after tea, despite the English protesting and wanting to bowl Giles. The Australians accepted it, and the light never improved, with light rain coming down later. Thus, the day concluded with Australia 112/0, 261 runs behind England.\n\nAfter a delay for wet field conditions, the third day began with a flurry of action, as both Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden had close calls with lbw appeals, which replays suggested should have been out, and shies at the stumps that just missed. However, no batsman was given out in the morning session, where only 14 overs of play was possible due to rain. Australia added 45 runs in that time.\n\nAfter lunch Hayden and Langer continued their solid batting, frustrating the England bowlers, with Langer reaching his 22nd Test century. Shortly afterwards, England gained a minor victory as Harmison dismissed Justin Langer, who departed to a rapturous ovation. Ricky Ponting should then have been dismissed for a bat-pad catch off Giles, but Bowden turned down the appeal. Hayden also achieved three-figure success later in the day, while Flintoff's hostile and accurate bowling was rewarded with the wicket of Ricky Ponting, caught at slip by Strauss. With this wicket, Flintoff equalled Ian Botham's hitherto unique achievement of 300 runs and 20 wickets in an Ashes series. Flintoff had a later appeal for a catch behind turned down by Rudi Koertzen, despite it hitting the bat.\n\nThe Australian batsmen once again ended the day early by accepting an offer of bad light, bringing a much-interrupted day to a close after only 45.4 overs. Thanks to dogged batting and at least four umpiring decisions in their favour on the third day, they finished 96 runs behind with eight wickets of their first innings intact.\n\nThe fourth day started brightly for England, Damien Martyn hooking a short ball from Flintoff straight into the hands of Collingwood, in the third over of the day, having added only one to his overnight score of nine. Further wickets fell, with an excellent knock by Matthew Hayden been brought to an end by Andrew Flintoff. Flintoff continued with impetus and trapped Simon Katich lbw for 1, before Hoggard had Adam Gilchrist lbw with an inswinger at the stroke of lunch. Gilchrist, however, had added a quick 23 that could be vital, as Australia went into the pavilion 17 runs behind with four wickets in hand.\n\nHowever, it only took six overs after lunch for England to end the Australian effort. Geraint Jones dropped a catch off Michael Clarke's bat, but it did not prove to be crucial, as Clarke was lbw to Hoggard in the next over. Warne and McGrath both went for ducks, caught off a mistimed hook and in the slips respectively. Finally Hoggard had Brett Lee (6) caught in the deep and Australia were bowled out for 367. Flintoff finished with five wickets, the second five-for of his career, while Hoggard's four for 97 was his best return of the series.\n\nThus England, who had expected to begin their second innings chasing a hundred runs or more, were actually leading by six as they took up their bats in mid-afternoon. Australia took a very quick wicket, that of Andrew Strauss, who was dismissed again by Shane Warne, caught bat-pad by Katich for a solitary run. The wicket was Warne's 167th against England, equalling Dennis Lillee's Ashes bowling record. 11 balls after this dismissal, umpires Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden judged it unfair to continue play due to inadequate light. One additional session of play was, however, subsequently possible, taking England to a 40-run lead without further loss, before poor light ended the day.\n\nBBC day four synopsis\n\nThe fifth day began with the game still finely balanced. Ponting put his trust in his two proven wicket takers – McGrath and Warne. England batted well for 40 minutes, with Vaughan taking the game to the Australian bowlers, but McGrath produced two beautiful outswingers to dismiss him and Ian Bell with consecutive deliveries. The Australian charge was diminished by a couple of uncharacteristic dropped catches, but Warne and McGrath combined to take 4 wickets before lunch, leaving England 133 runs ahead with five wickets remaining.\n\nThe afternoon session was anchored by Pietersen, the beneficiary of three dropped catches, who scored his maiden Test century, with obdurate support from Collingwood and Giles. The session saw only two wickets fall, Collingwood was caught acrobatically by Ponting at silly mid off for 10, and Geraint Jones (1) decisively bowled when he was deceived by a rapid Tait delivery. Pietersen was finally dismissed for 158, a superlative innings including 15 fours and seven sixes, while Ashley Giles added 59 and Steve Harmison was dismissed for a duck to bring Australia into bat with less than 19 overs remaining.\n\nAs the Australians began their innings, it was clear that not enough time remained for them to make up the 341 runs by which they trailed. Almost immediately they were offered the light; and having accepted it, both teams had to return to the dressing rooms to wait for a formal finish. The situation became somewhat farcical. With the match effectively over, the crowd were eager for the Ashes to be presented to England, and the celebrations to begin. After a period of some uncertainty and confusion, at 18:17 BST umpires Koertzen and Bowden removed the bails and pulled up the stumps to signal the end of the match. With no result in this fifth and final Test, England took the series 2–1, regaining the Ashes for the first time since 1987.\n\nKevin Pietersen, having scored his maiden Test century at a crucial point, was voted Man of the Match by Channel 4 viewers. Andrew Flintoff was chosen by Australian coach John Buchanan as English Man of the Series while English coach Duncan Fletcher selected Shane Warne as the Australian Man of the Series. The new Compton–Miller Medal for the overall man of the series (as selected by each side's chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns and David Graveney) was also presented to Andrew Flintoff. Finally, the replica urn was presented to jubilant English skipper Michael Vaughan, thus ending the series in favour of the home side.\n\n"}

{"id": "1994894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994894", "title": "Ike Clanton", "text": "Ike Clanton\n\nJoseph Isaac Clanton (1847 – June 1, 1887) was a member of a loose association of outlaws known as The Cowboys who clashed with lawmen Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan Earp as well as Doc Holliday. On October 26, 1881, Clanton was present at the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in the boomtown of Tombstone, Arizona Territory but was unarmed and ran from the gunfight, in which his 19-year-old brother, Billy, was killed.\n\nClanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Holliday but after a 30-day preliminary hearing, Justice Wells Spicer ruled that the lawmen had acted within their lawful duty. Clanton was implicated in the attempted assassination of Virgil Earp on December 30, 1881 but other Cowboys provided an alibi and he was released. Six years later Clanton was killed attempting to flee when he was shot by a lawman seeking to arrest him for cattle-rustling.\n\nBorn in Callaway County, Missouri, Joseph Isaac \"Ike\" Clanton was one of seven children of Newman Haynes Clanton, (1816–1881) and his wife Mariah Sexton (Kelso) Clanton. His father worked at times as a day laborer, a gold miner, a farmer, and by the late 1870s, a cattleman in Arizona Territory.\n\nClanton's mother died in 1866. Ike stayed with the family when they moved to Tombstone, Arizona Territory, around 1877 (before Tombstone became a town or even a mining center). At that time, Newman Clanton was living with his sons Phin (or \"Fin\"), Ike, and Billy. By 1878 Ike was running a small \"lunch counter\" at the Tombstone Mill site (now Millville on the San Pedro River—not in modern Tombstone). By 1881, however, he was working on his father's ranch at Lewis Springs, about west of Tombstone and from Charleston.\n\nThe Clantons and their ranch hands and associates were known as the \"Cowboys\", and they had a reputation for reckless behavior. They were accused of cattle rustling from across the U.S.–Mexican border, as well as other acts of banditry and murder.\n\nClanton's notoriety is based largely on his conflict with Wyatt Earp and Wyatt's friend Doc Holliday. The Earps and the Clantons had political, personal, and legal differences and the animosity between them grew throughout 1881. The Cowboys supported incumbent Sheriff Charles Shibell while the Earps supported his opponent Bob Paul in the November 1880 election. Clanton repeatedly boasted in public, drank heavily, and had a quick temper. He was well known for talking too much.\n\nIn November 1879, shortly after arriving in Tombstone, Earp had a horse stolen. More than a year later, probably sometime in December 1880, Earp was told the horse was being used near Charleston, and Wyatt and Holliday were forced to ride to the Clanton's ranch near Charleston to await ownership papers in order to legally recover it. According to Wyatt's testimony later, 18-year-old Billy Clanton asked him insolently if he had any more horses to \"lose,\" but he gave the horse up without first being shown the ownership papers, demonstrating to Wyatt that Billy Clanton knew to whom the horse belonged. Sheriff Johnny Behan later testified that the incident had angered Ike Clanton. It also angered Earp.\n\nAfter he was passed over by Johnny Behan for the position of undersheriff, Earp thought he might beat him in the next Cochise County election. He thought catching the March 15, 1881 robbers of the Benson Stage (in which the driver and a passenger were killed) would help him win the sheriff's office. Earp later said that on June 2, 1881 he offered the Wells, Fargo & Co. reward money and more to Clanton if he would provide information leading to the capture or death of the stage robbers. According to Earp, the plan was foiled when the three suspects, Leonard, Head and Crane, were killed in unrelated incidents.\n\nIn the summer of 1881, Clanton got into an argument with gambler \"Denny\" McCann. On the morning of June 9, 1881, they were drinking in an Allen Street saloon when Clanton insulted McCann. McCann slapped Clanton, who left and fetched his pistol. McCann did the same and the two met on the street in front of the Wells Fargo office. They had already drawn their weapons when Tombstone Marshal Virgil Earp stepped between them, preventing a shooting.\n\nThe Clanton Ranch grew into a successful enterprise. During his testimony after the shootout at the O.K. Corral, Clanton claimed to have raised and purchased about 700 head of cattle during the past year, and the Clanton ranch was one of the most profitable cattle ranches in that part of the country. However, the Clantons never registered a brand in either Cochise County or Pima County which was required to legally raise cattle. The Clantons were reputed to be among a group of outlaw Cowboys who crossed the border into Mexico where they stole cattle and re-sold them to the hungry miners in Cochise County. Curly Bill Brocius, Tom and Frank McLaury bought and sold stolen cattle to Old Man Clanton, among others. The Mexican government at the time placed high tariffs on goods transported across the border, making smuggling a profitable enterprise.\n\nThe outlaw Cowboys in Cochise County were not organized, and their acts of violence, rustling or robbery were usually committed by independent groups of Cowboys. Newman Haynes Clanton, also known as \"Old Man Clanton\", Ike's father, ran a ranch near the Mexican border that served as a waystation for much of the smuggling carried out by the outlaws.\n\nOn August 12, 1881, Old Man Clanton and six other men were herding stolen cattle sold to him by William Brocius through Guadalupe Canyon near the Mexican border. Around dawn, they were ambushed by Mexicans dispatched by Commandant Felipe Neri in what became known as the Guadalupe Canyon Massacre. Old Man Clanton and five other men were killed in the ambush.\n\nClanton had told others that Doc Holliday, Virgil Earp, Wyatt Earp, and Morgan Earp had all confided in him that they had actually been involved in the Benson stage robbery. On October 25, 1881, while Clanton was in Tombstone, drunk and very loud, Holliday accused him of lying about the Benson stagecoach robbery. Tombstone City Marshal Virgil Earp intervened and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop arguing, and Holliday went home.\n\nAfter the confrontation with Clanton, Wyatt Earp took Holliday back to his boarding house at Camillus Sidney \"Buck\" Fly's Lodging House to sleep off his drinking, then went home and to bed. Tombstone Marshal Virgil Earp played cards with Clanton, Tom McLaury, Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan and a fifth man (unknown to Clanton and to history), until morning.\n\nAt about dawn on October 26, the card game broke up and Behan and Virgil Earp went home to bed. Clanton testified later that he saw Virgil take his six-shooter out of his lap and stick it in his pants when the game ended. Not having rented a room, McLaury and Clanton had no place to go. Shortly after 8:00 am barkeeper E. F. Boyle spoke to Clanton, who had been drinking all night, in front of the telegraph office. Boyle encouraged him to get some sleep, but Clanton insisted he would not go to bed. Boyle later testified he noticed Clanton was armed and covered his gun for him, recalling that Clanton told him \"'As soon as the Earps and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street, the ball would open—that they would have to fight' ... I went down to Wyatt Earp's house and told him that Ike Clanton had threatened that when him and his brothers and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street that the ball would open.\" Clanton said in his testimony afterwards that he remembered neither meeting Boyle nor making any such statements that day.\n\nLater in the morning, Clanton picked up his rifle and single-action revolver from the West End Corral, where he had stabled his wagon and team and deposited his weapons after entering town. By noon that day, Clanton, drinking again and armed, told others he was looking for Holliday or an Earp. At about 1:00 pm, Virgil and Morgan Earp surprised Clanton on 4th Street where Virgil pistol whipped him from behind. Disarming him, the Earps took Clanton to appear before Judge Wallace for violating the city's ordinance #9 against carrying firearms in the city. Virgil Earp went to find Judge Wallace so the court hearing could be held..\"\n\nClanton reported in his testimony afterward that Wyatt Earp cursed him. He said Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan Earp offered him his rifle and to fight him right there in the courthouse, which Clanton declined. Clanton also denied ever threatening the Earps. Clanton was fined $25 plus court costs and after paying the fine left unarmed. Virgil Earp told Clanton he would leave Clanton's confiscated rifle and revolver at the Grand Hotel which was favored by Cowboys when in town. Clanton testified that he picked up the weapons from William Soule, the jailer, a couple of days later.\n\nAt around 1:30–2:00 pm, after Tom McLaury had been pistol-whipped by Wyatt, Clanton's 19-year-old younger brother Billy Clanton and Tom's older brother Frank McLaury arrived in town. They had heard from their neighbor, Ed Frink, that Clanton had been stirring up trouble in town overnight, and they had ridden into town on horseback to back up their brothers. They arrived from Antelope Springs, east of Tombstone, where they had been rounding up livestock with their brothers and had breakfasted with Clanton and Tom McLaury the day before. Both Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton were armed with a revolver and a rifle, as was the custom for riders in the country outside Tombstone. Apache warriors had engaged the U.S. Army near Tombstone just three weeks before the O.K. Corral gunfight, so the need for weapons outside of town was well established and accepted.\n\nBilly and Frank stopped first at the Grand Hotel on Allen Street, and were greeted by Doc Holliday. They learned immediately after of their brothers' beatings by the Earps within the previous two hours. The incidents had generated a lot of talk in town. Angrily, Frank said he would not drink, and he and Billy left the saloon immediately to seek Tom. By law, both Frank and Billy should have left their firearms at the Grand Hotel. Instead, they remained fully armed. The city statute was not specific about how far a recently arrived visitor might \"with good faith, and within reasonable time\" travel into town while carrying a firearm. This permitted a traveler to keep his firearms if he was proceeding directly to a livery, hotel or saloon.\n\nA man named Coleman told Virgil that the Cowboys had left the Dunbar and Dexter Stable for the O.K. Corral and were still armed, and Virgil decided they had to disarm them. The three main Tombstone corrals were all west of 4th street, a block or two from where Wyatt saw the Cowboys buying cartridges.\nCochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, a friend to the Cowboys, later testified that he first learned of the trouble while he was getting a shave at the barbershop after 1:30 pm, which is when he had risen after the late-night game. Behan stated he immediately went to locate the Cowboys. At about 2:30 pm he saw both Clantons and both McLaurys gathered off Fremont street in a narrow wide empty lot or alley immediately west of 312 Fremont Street, which contained Fly's 12-room boarding house and photography studio. The lot was six lots removed from the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral.\n\nWhen Virgil Earp learned that Wyatt was talking to the Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun from the Wells Fargo office around the corner on Allen Street. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil returned to Hafford's Saloon carrying the shotgun under his long overcoat. He gave the shotgun to Doc Holliday who hid it under his overcoat. He took Holliday's walking-stick in return. From Spangenberg's, the Cowboys moved to the O.K. Corral where witnesses overheard them threatening to kill the Earps. They then walked a block north to an empty lot next to C. S. Fly's boarding house where Doc Holliday lived.\n\nVirgil Earp was told by several citizens that the McLaurys and the Clantons had gathered on Fremont Street and were armed. He decided he had to act. Several members of the citizen's vigilance committee offered to support him with arms, but Virgil said no. He had previously deputized Morgan and Wyatt and also deputized Doc Holliday that morning. Wyatt spoke of his brothers Virgil and Morgan as the \"marshals\" while he acted as \"deputy.\"\n\nWitnesses later testified that Ike Clanton had spent all day, even after his arrest and disarming, threatening to gun down the Earps. However, when the gunfight broke out, Clanton ran forward and grabbed Wyatt, exclaiming that he was unarmed and did not want a fight. To this protest Wyatt said he responded, \"Go to fighting or get away!\".\" Clanton ran through the front door of Fly's boarding house and escaped, unwounded.\n\nIn the days before the gunfight, Clanton had enlisted the help of fellow Cowboy Billy Claiborne, who was reputed to be good with a gun. Claiborne, who was also unarmed, fled the gunfight. Tom and Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton were killed.\n\nAfter the gunfight in Tombstone, during which the McLaury brothers and Billy Clanton were killed, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday. They were arrested and released on bail. During a month-long preliminary hearing before Judge Wells Spicer, Clanton told a story of abuse that he had suffered at the hands of the Earps and Holliday the night before the gunfight. He denied having threatened the Earps. He testified that the Clantons and Frank McLaury raised their hands after Virgil's command, and Tom thrust open his vest to show he was unarmed. Clanton said Wyatt shoved his revolver in his belly, telling him, \"You son-of-a-bitch, you can have a fight!\".\n\nClanton backed up Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan's testimony that Holliday and Morgan Earp had fired the first two shots and that the next several shots also came from the Earp party. Under cross-examination, Clanton told a story of the lead-up to the gunfight that did not make sense. He said the Benson stage robbery was concocted by the Earps and Holliday to cover up money they had \"piped off\" to pay bribes. Clanton also claimed that Doc Holliday and Morgan, Wyatt, and Virgil Earp had separately confessed to him their role in the Benson stage holdup, or else the cover-up of the robbery by allowing the robbers' escape.\n\nClanton proved a better witness for the defense than the prosecution. He said that Doc Holliday, Virgil Earp, Wyatt Earp, and Morgan Earp had all confided in him that they had actually been involved in the stage robbery. He further claimed that Holliday had told him that Holliday had \"piped off\" money from the stage before it left (although no money was missing, and the stage had not been successfully robbed). Clanton also said Holliday had confessed to him about killing the stage driver. Murder was a capital offense, and given their relationship, it was unlikely Holliday would confide in Clanton. Clanton testified that Earp had threatened to kill his confederates because he feared they would reveal his part in the robbery. Clanton said he feared that Wyatt wanted to kill him because he knew of Wyatt's role. These and other inconsistencies in Clanton's testimony lacked credibility. By the time Clanton finished his testimony, the entire prosecution case had become suspect.\n\nJudge Spicer exonerated the lawmen. In his ruling, he noted that Clanton had the night before, while unarmed, publicly declared that the Earp brothers and Holliday had insulted him, and that when he was armed he intended to shoot them or fight them on sight. On the morning of the shooting Virgil Earp had arrested him for carrying a revolver. At the gunfight, he was unarmed. Spicer noted that Clanton had claimed the Earps were out to murder him, yet on both occasions that day the Earps had not killed him, and allowed him to escape unchallenged during the fight. Spicer wrote, \"the great fact, most prominent in the matter, to wit, that Isaac Clanton was not injured at all, and could have been killed first and easiest.\"\n\nClanton was later accused, along with his brother, Phin Clanton, and friend Pony Diehl, of attempting to kill Virgil Earp on December 30, 1881, a shooting which left Virgil with a crippled left arm. Though Ike Clanton's hat was found at the scene where the ambushers waited, a number of associates stood up for him, saying that he had been in Contention that night, and the case was dismissed for lack of evidence.\n\nOn Saturday, March 18, 1882, Morgan Earp was killed by a shot through a door window facing a dark alley while playing billiards at Hatch's Saloon in Tombstone. Wyatt was shot at and missed. Wyatt Earp concluded that he could not rely on civil justice and decided to take matters into his own hands. He concluded that only way to deal with Morgan's murderers was to kill them.\n\nDeputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp led a federal posse that escorted Virgil Earp to the railroad, bound for his parents’ home in Colton, California. Wyatt shot and killed Frank Stilwell, who was lying in wait at the Tucson, Arizona rail yard. A few days later Wyatt gathered a larger posse and set out on a vendetta, determined to mete out justice that had evaded him. Wyatt never located Clanton, although they killed three other outlaw Cowboys, and the Earps and Holliday left the Arizona Territory in late April, 1882.\n\nBy 1885, the Clanton gang included Lee Renfro, G.W. “Kid” Swingle, Longhair Sprague, Billy Evans, and the Clanton’s brother-in-law, Ebin Stanley. They moved their operations to a ranch they named the Cienega Amarilla, near Springerville, Arizona. On November 6, 1885, local rancher Isaac Ellinger and Pratt Plummer had dinner with the Clanton brothers and Lee Renfro. After the meal, Ike, Renfro, and Ellinger went into a cabin on the Clanton ranch when for unknown reasons Renfro shot and killed Ellinger.\n\nEllinger's older brother William Ellinger was one of the biggest cattlemen in the West with ranches in several states and territories. William learned that his brother had lived four days, long enough to call the shooting “coldblooded murder.” William and Isaac were members of the Apache County Stock Association and William had a lot of political clout. \n\nOn December 25, 1886 -- Christmas Day -- Evans, wanting to see “if a bullet would go through a Mormon,” shot and killed Jim Hale in cold blood.\n\nIn April 1887, the Apache County Stock Association met and hired a Pinkerton detective to track down the outlaws. They also hired Jonas \"Jake\" V. Brighton as a “secret service” officer. Brighton was a constable in Springerville and a range detective. \n\nIn April, 1887, Phin Clanton was arrested for rustling and jailed in St. Johns. During May and June 1887, several grand jury indictments were brought against the Clanton’s and their friends. The indictments included charges of cattle-rustling and murder for the death of Isaac Ellinger. \n\nBrighton pursued Clanton. After three days, he spent the night of May 31, 1887 at Jim \"Peg Leg\" Wilson's Ranch on Eagle Creek, south of Springerville. The next morning Clanton rode up and Brighton recognized him. Clanton turned his horse to run and drew his rifle from his scabbard. Brighton fired his rifle first, shooting Clanton through the left side, the bullet exiting out the right. Clanton died before he hit the dirt.\n\nA reporter who corresponded with Brighton in late June 1887 relayed Brighton's story about the arrest and shooting:\n\nA conflicting source stated that his body was left where it fell for several days until nearby Mormon ranchers buried him in an unmarked grave in the Mormon cemetery southeast of Eagar, Arizona on what is today called \"The 26 Bar Ranch\". Some modern writers wonder if Brighton simply used resisting arrest as an excuse to explain his assassination of Clanton.\n\nIn late June 1996 a Clanton family descendant, Terry \"Ike\" Clanton, along with former Citadel professor and grave expert James A. Browning, searched the area near Eagle Creek in what is now Greenlee County, Arizona, where Ike was reportedly buried. They quickly discovered a shallow grave under a large tree that they believe contains the remains of Ike Clanton. Since their discovery, Terry has unsuccessfully tried to interest Tombstone city officials in exhuming the remains and re-interring them in Tombstone's famous Boot Hill graveyard.\n\nClanton was played by Victor Jory in \"Tombstone, the Town Too Tough to Die\" (1942).\n\nClanton was portrayed by Grant Withers in the John Ford classic \"My Darling Clementine\" (1946). Lyle Bettger portrayed Clanton as a brutal thug in John Sturges' film \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\" (1957). In Sturges' sequel, \"Hour of the Gun\" (1967), he is portrayed very differently as a highly sophisticated figure by Robert Ryan. Although the film is a generally accurate depiction of the events surrounding the gunfight at OK Corral and the subsequent Earp Vendetta, it errs in showing Clanton as having been tracked down in Mexico and shot by Wyatt. Later films correctly show Wyatt allowing Clanton to live. Clanton appears in the \"Doctor Who\" story \"The Gunfighters\" (1966), played by William Hurndell, which is largely based on the Sturges film. It differs from history by showing Clanton participate and die in the OK Corral gunfight.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1960, the actor John Milford portrayed Clanton in eight episodes of the ABC/Desilu television series, \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\", starring Hugh O'Brian in the title role. Also Rayford Barnes played Ike Clanton in the episodes of the shoot out at the OK Coral. Trevor Bardette played Ike's father, Newman Haynes Clanton, known as Old Man Clanton. The role of Clanton was played by William Tannen in the episode \"After the OK Corral\" of the syndicated western anthology series, \"Death Valley Days\". Jim Davis played Wyatt Earp in this same episode of \"Death Valley Days\". Tannen had earlier played the role of Deputy Hal Norton on \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\".\n\nIn 1957, Kelo Henderson played Clanton in an episode of Dale Robertson's NBC series, \"Tales of Wells Fargo\".\n\nMichael Witney played Clanton in \"Doc\" (1971).\n\nStephen Lang played Clanton in the movie \"Tombstone\" (1993) starring Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp. This film draws heavily on the book by former Tombstone Assistant Marshal Billy Breakenridge, \"Helldorado: Bringing the Law to the Mesquite\". In the film, Clanton is portrayed as being second-in-command of the Clanton Gang and the plot's comic relief. Although he is sadistic and talks tough, he is cowardly, as he begs for his life whenever someone is trying to kill him. The film shows him firing at the Earps during the gunfight after running away, though is not clear if this happened. \n\nJeff Fahey played Clanton in the movie \"Wyatt Earp\" (1994), starring Kevin Costner as Wyatt Earp. Christopher Fulford played him in 2007 in the BBC drama-documentary \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\".\n\nIn the original \"\" series episode titled \"Spectre of the Gun\" (1969), Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) plays the part of Clanton throughout the episode as part of an alien illusion test. DeForest Kelley (Dr. Leonard McCoy) also played this character in an episode of the CBS television series \"You Are There\" prior to \"Star Trek\". Coincidentally, Kelley also portrayed Morgan Earp in the 1957 John Sturges film, \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1994895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1994895", "title": "Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania", "text": "Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania\n\nChronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) is a severe debilitating unilateral headache usually affecting the area around the eye. It normally consists of multiple severe, yet short, headache attacks affecting only one side of the cranium. It is more commonly diagnosed in women than in men, but, unlike a migraine, has no neurological symptoms associated with it. CPH headaches are treated through the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with indomethacin found to be usually effective in eliminating symptoms.\n\nParoxysmal hemicrania is classified by the frequency and duration of attacks experienced by patients. Episodic paroxysmal hemicrania attacks occur at least twice a year and last anywhere from seven days to a year with pain free periods of a month or longer separating them. Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania attacks occur over the course of more than a year without remission or with remissions lasting less than a month.\n\nIndividuals with CPH suffer multiple short, severe headaches a day, often more than five, with most lasting between 5 and 30 minutes each. When compared to cluster headaches, CPH attacks are typically shorter. Each headache is centered around the eye, temple and forehead and is localized to one side of the head. While redness and watering of the eye are associated with CPH, patients typically do not experience nausea or vomiting.\n\nMany secondary conditions have been reported to be possible causes of CPH, according to Mehta et al., most of which are arterial abrasions or tumors. These include aneurysms in the circle of Willis, middle cerebral artery infarction, parietal arteriovenous malformation, cavernous sinus and petrous ridge meningiomas, pituitary adenoma, Pancoast tumor, gangliocytoma of the sella turcica, and malignant frontal tumors. This accentuates the urgency for those diagnosed with CPH to receive an MRI head scan.\n\nCPH is a long-term disease with symptoms lasting for longer than a year, either without remission or with remissions that last less than a month. In order to be diagnosed with CPH, a patient needs to have had at least 20 attacks filling the following criteria: \n\n\nIn addition, diagnosis of CPH requires that neuropathy of the supraorbital area in the temporal branch of the facial nerve be ruled out.\n\nThough outwardly similar to cluster headaches, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania is rather different, and the two headaches are not a subset of one or the other. Key differences include:\n\n\nA ten-patient study conducted by Pareja et al. found that all patients diagnosed with CPH were responsive to indomethacin and were able to completely control their symptoms. Doses of the drug ranged from 25 mg per day to 150 mg per day with a median dose of 75 mg per 24-hour period.\nAlmost all cases of CPH respond positively and effectively to indometacin, but as much as 25 percent of patients discontinued use of the drug due to adverse side effects, namely complications in the gastrointestinal tract.\nAccording to a case study by Milanlioglu et al., 100mg of lamotrigine, an antiepileptic drug, administered twice daily alleviated all painful symptoms. No side effects were noted after two months of treatment. Dosage of lamotrigine was decreased to 50mg a day after the first two months, and no symptoms or side-effects were recorded after a three-month followup.\nUse of topiramate has also been found to be an effective treatment for CPH, but cluster headache medications have been found to have little effect.\n\nAlthough CPH is often compared to cluster headaches, it is much less prevalent, occurring in only 1–3% of those who experience cluster headaches. CPH occurs roughly in 1 in 50,000 people, while cluster headaches are comparatively more common and are found in 1 in 1000 people.\nCluster headaches occur primarily in men, while CPH is more commonly diagnosed in women. The female to male ratio of diagnosed patients can range anywhere from 1.6:1 to 2.36:1. Symptoms may begin to appear at any age, but onset usually occurs in adulthood with a mean starting age within the thirties.\n\nCPH was discovered by Norwegians Ottar Sjaastad and Inge Dale in 1974. The term 'chronic paroxysmal hemicrania' was first used in 1976 by Sjaastad to describe a condition seen in two of their patients who were experiencing repeated solitary and limited daily headache attacks on only one side of the cranium.\n\nIt is possible that chronic paroxysmal hemicrania was first described by Johann Oppermann in 1747 under the term \"hemicranias horologica\". Oppermann's report included a 35-year-old woman who had hemicranial pain that lasted for 15 minutes and recurred regularly every hour.\n\nCPH has been included in the International Headache Society's classification system since 1988.\n\n"}

Electrons do not penetrate as deeply into matter as X-rays, hence electron diffraction reveals structure near the surface; neutrons do penetrate easily and have an advantage that they possess an intrinsic magnetic moment that causes them to interact differently with atoms having different alignments of their magnetic moments.\n\nA typical diffractometer consists of a source of radiation, a monochromator to choose the wavelength, slits to adjust the shape of the beam, a sample and a detector. In a more complicated apparatus, a goniometer can also be used for fine adjustment of the sample and the detector positions. When an area detector is used to monitor the diffracted radiation, a beamstop is usually needed to stop the intense primary beam that has not been diffracted by the sample, otherwise the detector might be damaged. Usually the beamstop can be completely impenetrable to the X-rays or it may be semitransparent. The use of a semitransparent beamstop allows the possibility to determine how much the sample absorbs the radiation using the intensity observed through the beamstop.\n\nThere are several types of X-ray diffractometer, depending of the research field (material sciences, powder diffraction, life sciences, structural biology, etc.) and the experimental environment, if it is a laboratory with its home X-ray source or a Synchrotron.\nIn laboratory, diffractometers are usually a \"all in one\" equipment, including the diffractometer, the video microscope and the X-ray source. Plenty of companies manufacture \"all in one\" equipment for X-ray home laboratory, such as Rigaku, PANalytical, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bruker, and many others.\n\nThere are fewer diffractometer manufacturers for synchrotron, owing to few numbers of x-ray beamlines to equip and the need of solid expertise of the manufacturer.\nFor material sciences, Huber diffractometers are widely known and, for structural biology, Arinax diffractometers are the reference.\n\nNonetheless, due to few numbers of manufacturers, a large amount of synchrotron diffractometers are \"Homemade\" diffractometers, realized by synchrotron engineers team.\n\n"}

The club's first team play in the National League South, the sixth tier of English football.\n\nWelling United Football Club was founded in 1963. It began as a youth team, playing in the Eltham & District Sunday League on a park pitch from 1963–64 to 1970–71. From 1971–72 to 1974–75, they played in the Metropolitan-London League Intermediate/Reserves Division. In 1975–76, they played in the London Spartan League Reserve Division One. They gained senior status in the London Spartan League in 1976, at Butterfly Lane, Eltham. Welling finished sixth in Division 2 in 1976–77 and was promoted to the Premier Division. In 1977, Welling moved to the Park View Road ground, which had previously belonged to the then defunct Bexley United. They joined the Athenian League in 1978. In 1981, they progressed to the Southern Football League Southern Division.\n\nAfter just one season at this level the club found itself in the Southern League Premier Division after the league was re-organised. In 1985–86, they won the league title by 23 points and were promoted to the Football Conference.\n\nAlthough they struggled in the Conference, only twice finishing above 11th place in 14 seasons, they did enjoy cup success during this period, reaching the first round proper of the FA Cup in six successive seasons, on one occasion knocking out Kent's only Football League side, Gillingham. They also made one third round appearance, losing 1–0 at Park View Road to Blackburn Rovers.\n\nThe club was relegated in 1999–2000 and returned to the Southern League.\n\nIn the 2003–04 season, under the management of former England World Cup player Paul Parker, the Wings finished in the top half of the Southern League Premier Division and was therefore able to claim a place in the newly formed Conference South. In that season, Parker left the club by mutual consent.\n\nFormer Coventry City and Republic of Ireland player Liam Daish took charge of the team on a caretaker basis before the permanent position was handed to former Norwich City and Gillingham defender Adrian Pennock, who narrowly missed out on taking the club into the promotion play-offs. Pennock left the club at the end of the 2006–07 season. His last game managing the Wings finished in a 1–1 draw at home to Hayes. Pennock joined Stoke City in a coaching position under his former Gillingham manager, Tony Pulis.\n\nOn 16 May 2007, Welling United appointed Neil Smith as the new first team manager. However, after only seven months in charge Smith parted company with the club on 7 January 2008. It was mutually agreed between the club and Smith that his reign as Wings boss would end.\n\nAndy Ford was appointed the new manager of the Wings on 31 January 2008. Despite losing 6–2 to Cambridge City in his first game in charge, Ford guided the Wings to safety and they eventually finished 16th. Welling finished 7th in the Conference South in 2008/09 under the guidance of Ford. After a poor start to the 2009–10 season Ford resigned, stating he didn't think he could achieve what he wanted on the current budget. Jamie Day was announced as the new player/manager in November 2009.\n\nOn 12 August 2010, the club was served with a winding-up petition by HMRC, due for a hearing later that month. The Wings were given 14 weeks to pay the outstanding debt to the HMRC, and thanks almost entirely to the supporters were able to raise £60,000 to clear all monies owed. During this period, in a Football Conference Hearing on 16 September 2010, Welling United admitted to a misconduct charge in connection with the outstanding HMRC debt. Resultantly an immediate deduction of 5 points was enforced on the club together with a suspended £5,000 fine.\n\nDespite the Wings having a transfer embargo enforced upon them and also being deducted 5 points by the Football Conference, all within four weeks of the start of 2010–11 season, Jamie Day's side were competitively competing for the Conference South title. However, even though Welling United were in the top 5 for almost half of the season, a string of poor results in the final month of the campaign saw the Wings miss out on a play-off place by one point, with a final position of 6th.\n\nThe 2011–12 season ended with Welling in 3rd place and after defeating Sutton United 2–1 on aggregate in the play-off semi-finals they narrowly missed promotion in the final, going down 0–1 to Dartford at Princes Park.\n\nWelling made a return to the top level of non-league football the following season after clinching the Conference South title, 13 years after they last played at the fifth tier of English football. Between 3 November and 5 February, Welling also broke the league's record for consecutive wins with 12 in a row.\n\nIn December 2014 Jamie Day left Welling by mutual consent. He was replaced by Jake Gallagher and Jamie Turner as caretakers, but on 21 December it was announced that Jody Brown of Grays Athletic would become manager. On 3 March 2015, Jody Brown was relieved of his duties after just one point in his first nine games. Right back Loui Fazakerley was put in charge for \"the foreseeable future\".\n\nWelling's first televised home match was played on 8 March 2015 in front of the BT Sport cameras losing 1–0 to Altrincham.\n\nFollowing an impressive run of results, Fazakerley steered The Wings out of the relegation zone and to Conference Premier safety on goal difference above Alfreton Town. Fazakerley was appointed on a full-time basis the same week.\n\nOn 25 January 2016 Loui Fazakerley was sacked after 10 months in charge, with the club in the National League relegation zone and was replaced with former first team coach under Jamie Day, Dean Frost and Barry Ashby as assistant manager. Jamie Turner also came back as goalkeeping coach. Frost's first match in charge was away against FC Halifax Town and finished 1–1, Welling's first goal and point at The Shay. Frost left the post with 6 matches remaining in the 2015–16 season with the club bottom of the league.\n\nMark Goldberg was appointed manager for the coming season along with Damian Mathew as his assistant. After a poor start to the season Golberg gave more control to Mathew but that proved short lived as Mathew left the club in the wake of a capitulation from 2–0 at home to Hemel Hempstead Town, losing the match 3–2. Former manager Jamie Day returned to the club as assistant to Goldberg but results still did not improve. Day was appointed manager, which culminated in a run that saw Day awarded National League South Manager of the Month, December 2016, and talisman Adam Coombes named player for the month. Day was being assisted by Adrian Pennock, acting as football consultant. In January 2017, more upheaval was to follow when Pennock left for Gillingham, as manager, taking Day with him as assistant. Coach, Harry Wheeler and Tristan Lewis were drafted in to cover in the short term. With the 2016/17 season nearing close, former Charlton Athletic assistant manager Alex Dyer was appointed manager in March 2017. Assisted by Tristan Lewis, Dyer guided Welling for the remainder of the season, and finished the 2016–17 campaign with a 2–0 loss to Dover Athletic in the Kent Senior Cup final. In May 2017, Jamie Coyle became Welling United manager, with Tristan Lewis appointed to Director of Football. In February 2018 it was announced that Coyle had signed a contract extension to manage the Wings for the 2018–19 season. With the season ended three days earlier, and the club missing out on a play-off berth, it was announced on 1 May 2018 that Coyle had stepped down from his role as first-team manager. On 3 May 2018, Director of Football, Tristan Lewis also left for pastures new, with the club singling out his work; in establishing their academy, and co-managing the team alongside Mark Goldberg, Harry Wheeler, Alex Dyer and Jamie Coyle, for praise.\n\nSteve King was next to be appointed manager, after he joined from recently relegated Whitehawk at the end of May. A successful season was to follow with the Wings finishing in 3rd place and top of the home form table; meaning that the club had qualified for the playoffs for only the second time in its history. In the semi-final at Park View Road, Welling defeated Chelmsford City 3-2 courtesy of a 96th minute Brendan Kiernan penalty, thus setting up a draw in the final away at Woking. The hosts won the game 1-0 after Armani Little scored a free-kick just before half-time. This proved to be King's final game in charge as manager as he was replaced in June 2019 by Goldberg, who returned for his second spell in the dugout. Bradley Quinton became the club’s new manager in January 2020.\n\nWelling United play their home matches at Park View Road, Welling. This ground has been their home since 1977 when they took over the ground which had been vacated by the defunct Bexley United. Prior to that date the club had played at a community sports ground in Butterfly Lane, Eltham. Having been unoccupied for some time, the new ground was almost derelict.\n\nErith & Belvedere have been ground sharing since the 1999 season. Improvements were made to the Park View Road ground in 2004, which included a new covered stand.\n\nAs a result of severe storms and gale-force winds in December 2006, the floodlights at Park View Road were damaged. Due to safety reasons all the floodlight pylons on the Welling side of the ground were removed. The floodlights were put in place during the month of June 2007 and are fully functional, one pylon positioned in each corner.\n\nDuring the 2013–14 season, Park View Road had to be changed to keep Welling United in the Conference Premier in the 2014–15 season. These all happened between the months of February and March.\n\nIn the close season of 2015–16 both Welling United bars, the boardroom and parking area at Park View Road underwent renovations. In particular the hospitality areas at the ground were fully refitted to cater for match-days, and non-football related events and private bookings.\n\nThe club has a number of sponsors, and the first team wear shirts sponsored by local construction firm SECO Construction, and local IT company D&M Systems. Both firms are in their third year of shirt sponsorship with the club.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his long tenure in the Cecil Taylor Unit. Lyons was the only constant member of the band from the mid-1960s until his death in 1986. Taylor never worked with another musician as frequently as he did with Lyons. Lyons' playing, influenced by Charlie Parker, kept Taylor's avant-garde music tethered to the jazz tradition.\n\nLyons was born in Jersey City, New Jersey and raised there until the age of 9, when his mother moved the family to Harlem and then the Bronx. He obtained his first saxophone in the mid-1940s and took lessons from Buster Bailey.\n\nAfter high school, Lyons was drafted into the United States Army and spent 21 months on infantry duty in Korea. He then spent a year playing in army bands. Once discharged he attended New York University. By the end of the 1950s, Lyons was supporting his interest in music by working for the United States Postal Service.\n\nIn 1961, Lyons followed Archie Shepp into the saxophone role in the Cecil Taylor Unit. His post-Parker sound and strong melodic sense became a defining part of the sound of that group, from the 1962 Cafe Montmartre sessions onwards.\n\nDuring the 1970s Lyons also ran his own ensemble, with bassoonist Karen Borca and percussionist Paul Murphy. They often performed in the loft jazz movement around Studio Rivbea. Lyons' group and Cecil Taylor Unit continued a parallel development throughout the 1970s and 1980s, often involving the same musicians, including trumpeter Raphe Malik, bassist William Parker and percussionist Murphy.\n\nIn 1976, Lyons performed in a production of Adrienne Kennedy's \"A Rat's Mass\" directed by Cecil Taylor at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in the East Village of Manhattan. Musicians Rashid Bakr, Andy Bey, Karen Borca, David S. Ware, and Raphe Malik also performed in the production. Taylor's production combined the original script with a chorus of orchestrated voices used as instruments.\n\nLyons died from lung cancer in 1986 at the age of 54.

The Lake Geneva area was conquered by the Romans in the 2nd century. They built a road from Corsier through the Cologny area to Frontenex during their 2 centuries of residency.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, it was part of the lands of the Counts of Geneva, before it was acquired by the Bishopric of Geneva. The village church of Saint Peter was placed under the parish of Vandœuvres in 1406, indicating that it was probably built before the 15th century. In 1536, Cologny joined the new faith of the Protestant Reformation as nearby Geneva became a center of reform. Two years later, in May 1538 a treaty between Bern and Geneva placed Cologny in the city of Geneva.\n\nIn the late 16th century and into the 17th century a number of Geneva publishers moved to or set up offices in Cologny. By claiming Cologny or Colonia Allobrogum as the publication location, they were able to circumvent French laws which banned books from Geneva. Beginning in the 18th century elegant chalets sprung up along the shores of Lake Geneva in Cologny. One of the most famous in Villa Diodati in which Lord Byron, John Polidori, Mary Shelley and Percy Bysshe Shelley spent part of the Year Without a Summer in 1816. Due to the poor weather, the guests spent days indoors telling each other horror stories. Mary Shelley’s \"Frankenstein\" and John Polidori’s \"The Vampyre\", the first modern vampire story, both resulted. \nThe town council of Cologny met for the first time on 9 December 1800, after Geneva had been annexed into France following the 1798 French invasion of Switzerland. The mathematician Louis Necker (1730–1804), elder brother of the Statesman Jacques Necker, died in Cologny.\n\nIn the 20th century, many wealthy individuals and organizations have moved to Cologny. Traditionally the municipality consisted of small villages with many farms. However, by 1965 there were only eight working farms and by 1975 that number had decreased to two. Today it is one of the richest municipalities in the Canton of Geneva.\n\nCologny has an area, , of . Of this area, or 17.7% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 4.1% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 78.5% is settled (buildings or roads), or 0.3% is either rivers or lakes.\n\nOf the built up area, housing and buildings made up 60.5% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.3%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.1% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 4.4%. Out of the forested land, 2.2% of the total land area is heavily forested and 1.9% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 8.7% is used for growing crops and 5.4% is pastures, while 3.5% is used for orchards or vine crops.

May 5, 1852) was an important Avar leader during the resistance of the peoples of Dagestan and Chechnya in 1811–1864 against the incorporation of the region into the Russian Empire.\n\nHadji Murad was an Avar commander who lived in the Caucasus. He was foster-brother to Omar, Pakkou-Bekkhe, the Khanum of Khunzak's son. Hadji Murad was involved in the murder of Gamzat-bek during a Friday prayer in 1834, in revenge for Gamzat's murdering of the Khanum and her sons. Murad's brother, Osman, was slain in the fight with Gamzat-bek's Murids.\n\nHadji Murad supported the Russians for a while, to counter what he saw as the threat of Muridism. His rival, Akhmet Khan, set about undermining Russian confidence in Murad, until they ordered his arrest, which was carried out by Akhmet Khan. General Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov demanded that he be brought into general headquarters. Hadji Murad contrived to escape, by flinging himself over the ledge of a narrow mountain-pass. The Russians gave him up for dead. The snow, however, had broken his fall and he lay in hiding for the winter. Because of the Russian's bad faith, he decided to throw his lot in with Imam Shamil, who bestowed upon him the rank of naib. Many tribes followed Hadji Murad, defecting from the Russians.\n\nHis exploits and red dress earned him the nickname of the 'red devil' from the Russians. After an ineffectual raid on Russian headquarters at Temir-Khan-Shura, a rumour spread that he had slaughtered all the Russians in the hospital and cut them up into shashliks, which he left behind for the Russian troops to eat unawares. Though false, this rumour gained much credence among the Russians and vilified Hadji Murad's reputation.\n\nIn 1851, a feud broke out between him and Shamil, when Shamil proclaimed his son, Khazi Mohammed, as the successor. In a secret meeting, Shamil and his naibs decided that Hadji Murad should be killed. An unknown naib warned him and he managed to escape in time, but his family were held captive. Hadji Murad surrendered to the Russians, who lionised but mistrusted him. He repeatedly asked to be given men and guns to attack Shamil and rescue his family, but received no firm reply. He was allowed to move from Tbilisi to the small Muslim town of Noukkha (now Shaki, Azerbaijan) accompanied by a Cossack escort. Hadji Murad planned an escape, which he carried out on April 24 (Old style calendar), 1852, during one of his morning rides. The Cossack guards were ambushed and killed but the town's garrison, led by Colonel Karganov, tracked Hadji Murad down. The Russians were joined by many tribesmen, including Akhmet Khan's son and Hadji Murad was killed in the ensuing fight. The young Akhmet Khan cut off the head and sent it to Tbilisi, where it was embalmed and then sent to the Emperor. Tolstoy places Murad's death near the minaret of Belarjik (probably referring to the latterday town of Biləcik on the Shaki to Qax road) but a commemorative grave marker is further south near km76 on the Shaki-Zaqatala road. \n\nHadji Murad's severed head was finally sent to be kept at the Kunstkamera in St. Petersburg. In 2017, his descendants and activists in Dagestan petitioned to retrieve his skull from St. Petersburg and reunite it with the rest of his remains believed to be buried in modern Azerbaijan's Qakh District. The Russian government set up an interagency commission to consider the request.\n\nLeo Tolstoy's posthumously published novel \"Hadji Murad\" (1912) is a fictionalized account of Murad's struggle with the Russian Empire. His image also appears in \"My Dagestan\", a novel of the Avars writer Rasul Gamzatov.\n\n\"Agi Murad il diavolo bianco\" (1959) – in English, \"The White Warrior\" – is an Italian movie account of Murad's struggle with the Russian Empire. Murad is played by Steve Reeves.\n\n\n"}

He was a traditional Tongan Prince and a Fijian chief nominated and installed by the Tovata chiefs of Lakeba and Vanua Balavu as 'Tui Lau' in 1869. This title was ratified by a wider council of Fijian chiefs and subsequently formalised under British colonial administration. \nIn 1874, Maʻafu went to Fiji in an expedition to Vanua Balavu to investigate the killing of a preacher.\n\nHe was born in Tongatapu, Tonga, in 1816, as the son of Aleamotu'a, Tu'i Kanokupulu. In 1840 he married ʻElenoa Ngataialupe Lutui, with whom he had one child, Siale 'Ataongo, in Nukualofa. Also a Christian, 'Enele (Henry) Ma'afu introduced Methodist Christianity to eastern Fiji. Ma'afu died 6 February 1881 in Lomaloma, Vanua Balavu, and was buried on the island of Lakeba in the chiefly village of Tubou.\n\nThe brother and official representative of King George Tupou I, who wished to keep him away from Tonga as a potential rival for the throne. In 1847, King Taufa'ahau of Tonga included his cousin Ma'afu in an expedition sent to Vanua Balavu to investigate the killing of a preacher. Ma'afu established himself at Lakeba as leader of the Tongan community in the Lau Islands in 1848. Aligning himself with the Tui Nayau, the Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands, he went on to conquer the Moala Islands and placed them under the Tui Nayau's authority. In 1850, Enele Ma'afu gave the Tui Cakau a canoe and in return the Tui Cakau gave the island of Vanua Balavu to Ma'afu. He went on to Vanua Balavu and took up residence in Lomaloma, after suppressing a religious war on the island. Using his alliance with the Tui Cakau and Tui Bua, or Paramount Chief of Bua, Ma'afu defeated Ritova, the Tui Macuata or Paramount Chief of Macuata, Ma'afu extended his influence through the northern island of Vanua Levu.\n\nWhen Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau, the Vunivalu, by then the Paramount Chief of Bau, made his first offer to cede Fiji to the United Kingdom in 1858, William Thomas Pritchard, the British Consul, warned Ma'afu - by now the most powerful chief in northern Fiji - that under British rule, further attempts to expand his power base would not be tolerated. Ma'afu shrewdly signed an agreement denying sovereignty over Fijians and claiming to be in the islands only to oversee the Tongan population. Following Britain's decision in 1862 not to annex Fiji, however, Ma'afu resumed his attempts to extend his rule. In 1867, he created the Tovata Confederacy, covering most of northern and eastern Fiji. This arrangement was not a success, however, and Ma'afu retired to the island of Vanuabalavu. He maintained his claim, however, to be the overseer of the Tongan population, and when the Tui Nayau raised the Tongan flag over Lakeba, Ma'afu took control of the Lau archipelago on the pretext that its Paramount Chief had declared it be Tongan territory, rather than Fijian.\nMa'afu was faced with a crisis in June 1868, when the Tongan government disclaimed all sovereignty over Fijian territory, including the Lau Islands. Ma'afu could no longer exercise authority over Lau as a Tongan Prince. Lauan chiefs met in Lakeba and February 1869, and granted Ma'afu the title of Tui Lau, or King of Lau, Levuka, and Ovalau. He was subsequently recognized as such by the chiefs of Cakaudrove and Bua in May 1869. Ma'afu played a leading role in the cession of Fiji to the United Kingdom in 1874. Ma'afu has descendants living today in Tubou, Lakeba, in the Lau Islands known as the Onewai clan in Tubou, Lakeba. The large Onewai Clan live all over Fiji and around the world. He also had descendants in the Kingdom of Tonga, as Halaevalu Mataʻaho ʻAhomeʻe, the late Queen Mother.\n\n\n"}

For example, if the ascending musical partial octave \"do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-...\" is heard, listeners familiar with Western music will have a strong expectation to hear or provide one more note, \"do\", to complete the octave.\n\nMelodic expectation can be considered at the esthesic level, in which case the focus lies on the listener and its response to music. It can be considered at the neutral level, in which case the focus switches to the actual musical content, such as the \"printed notes themselves\". At the neutral level, the observer may consider logical implications projected onto future elements by past elements or derive statistical observations from information theory.\n\nThe notion of melodic expectation has prompted the existence of a corpus of studies in which authors often choose to provide their own terminology in place of using the literature's. This results in an important number of different terms that all point towards the phenomenon of musical expectation:\n\n\nExpectation can also be found mentioned in relation to concepts originating from the field of information theory such as entropy.\nHybridization of information theory and humanities results in the birth of yet other notions, particularly variations upon the notion of entropy modified for the need of description of musical content.\n\nConsideration of musical expectation can be sorted into four trends.\n\n\nLeonard Meyer's \"Emotion and Meaning in Music\" is the classic text in music expectation. Meyer's starting point is the belief that the experience of music (as a listener) is derived from one's emotions and feelings about the music, which themselves are a function of relationships within the music itself. Meyer writes that listeners bring with them a vast body of musical experiences that, as one listens to a piece, conditions one's response to that piece as it unfolds. Meyer argued that music's evocative power derives from its capacity to generate, suspend, prolongate, or violate these expectations.\n\nMeyer models listener expectation in two levels. On a perceptual level, Meyer draws on Gestalt psychology to explain how listeners build mental representations of auditory phenomena. Above this raw perceptual level, Meyer argues that learning shapes (and re-shapes) one's expectations over time.\n\nNarmour's (1992) Implication-Realization (I-R) Model is a detailed formalization based on Meyer's work on expectation. A fundamental difference between Narmour's models and most theories of expectation lies in the author's conviction according to which a genuine theory should be formulated in falsifiable terms. According to Narmour, prior knowledge of musical expectation is based too heavily upon percepts, introspection and internalization, which bring insoluble epistemological problems. The theory focuses on how \"implicative intervals\" set up expectations for certain \"realizations\" to follow. The I-R model includes two primary factors: proximity and direction. Lerdahl extended the system by developing a tonal pitch space and adding a stability factor (based on Lerdahl's prior work) and a mobility factor.\n\nMainly developed at IRISA since 2011 by Frédéric Bimbot and Emmanuel Deruty, the system & contrast or S&C model of implication derives from the two fundamental hypotheses underlying the I-R model. It is rooted in Narmour's conviction according to which any model of expectation should be expressed in logical, falsifiable terms. It operates at the neutral level and differs from the I-R model in several regards:\n\n\nMargulis's 2005 model further extends the I-R model. First, Margulis added a melodic attraction factor, from some of Lerdahl's work. Second, while the I-R model relies on a single (local) interval to establish an implication (an expectation), Margulis attempts to model intervalic (local) expectation as well as more deeply schematic (global) expectation. For this, Margulis relies on Lerdahl's and Jackendoff's Generative Theory of Tonal Music to provide a time-span reduction. At each hierarchical level (a different time scale) in the reduction, Margulis applies her model. These separate levels of analysis are combined through averaging, with each level weighted according to values derived from the time-span reduction. Finally, Margulis's model is explicit and realizable, and yields quantitative output. The output – melodic expectation at each time instant – is a single function of time.\n\nMargulis's model describes three distinct types of listener reactions, each derived from listener-experienced \"tension\":\n"}

For instance, the Romm publishing house edition of the Mikraot Gedolot contains the following additional commentaries:\n\n\nNewer editions often include Baruch Halevi Epstein's Torah Temimah.\n\nFirst published in 1516–17 by Daniel Bomberg in Venice, the Mikraot Gedolot was edited by the masoretic scholar Yaakov ben Hayyim.

Objections were also raised by the Jewish readership, based on the fact that the very first printing of the Mikra'ot Gedolot was edited by Felix Pratensis, a Jew converted to Christianity. Furthermore, Bomberg, a Christian, had requested an \"imprimatur\" from the Pope. Such facts were not compatible with the supposed Jewish nature of the work; Bomberg had to produce a fresh edition under the direction of acceptable Jewish editors. Nevertheless, this first edition served as the textual model for nearly all later editions until modern times. With regard to the Biblical text, many of Ben Hayyim's errors were later corrected by Menahem Lonzano and Shlomo Yedidiah Norzi.\n\nThe Mikraot Gedolot of Ben Hayyim served as the source for the Hebrew Bible translation in the King James Version of the Bible in 1611 and the Spanish Reina-Valera translation.\n\nMost editions until the last few decades, and many editions even today, are reprints of or based on late nineteenth century Eastern European editions, which are in turn based more or less on the Ben Hayyim edition described above.\n\nIn the last generation fresh editions of the Mikraot Gedolot have been published, based directly on manuscript evidence, principally the \"Keter Aram Tzova\", the manuscript of the Tanakh kept by the Jews of Aleppo.

There are two versions of the sport: grass and Hardcourt Bike Polo. The hardcourt game saw a sharp spike in interest in the first decade of the 21st century and new teams are sprouting up across the world in China, Canada, Ireland, Switzerland, France, India, Germany, Pakistan, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Hungary, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, England, Scotland, Argentina, Italy, Spain, USA, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Nepal, Brazil and Cuba.\n\nThere are two versions of the grass games: the four-player game and the five-player game.\n\nIn the four-player game, cycle polo is played in a rectangular grass field, officially, unofficially whatever field is big enough. Moreover, official dimensions can vary between in length on in width. The ball used approximately in diameter and the mallet is of maximum length .\n\nGoals are four metres wide and made with two goal posts without any crossbar.\n\nThere are six members in a team, of which four are on field at any one time. The other two are used as substitutes. International matches are played for a duration of 30 minutes, divided into periods of 7.5 minutes known as \"chukkars\". Extra time can be used to determine the winner in the event of the scores being tied at normal time.\n\nA player following the ball on its exact line and taking it on his off side will be entitled to the right of way over all other players.\n\nIf a deliberate severe foul is committed at the vicinity of the goal, the team that is fouled is automatically given a goal. Less severe fouls are awarded 15-metre and 25-metre free hits. In the event of deliberate fouls or dangerous fouls, the umpire can issue a yellow card (warning) and in case of repeated or severe fouls a red card (ejection). The ejected player can be replaced by a substitute after the end of the current \"chukkar\" if the umpire allows it.\n\nIn the 5 player game (mostly used in Europe), bicycle polo is played in a rectangular grass field, officially, such as a football or a rugby field. Moreover, official dimensions can vary between in length and in width. The ball shall be round and may not be less than 32 cm (12.6 inches) or greater than 38 cm (15.0 inches) in circumference when inflated and the mallet is of maximum length .\n\nGoals are 4 meters wide (5 meters in the national French rules) and made with 2 goal posts and a 2.75 meter (3 yards) high crossbar.\n\nThere are eight members in a team of which five are on the field at any one time, including a goalkeeper. The other three are used as substitutes. Matches are played for a duration of 60 minutes divided into 4 periods of 15 minutes each. Extra time can be used to determine the winner in case the scores are tied at normal time.\n\nIn order for a player to touch the ball or attack an opponent, the player must be holding the mallet in his right hand, the handlebar in his left hand, and must not be touching the ground with any part of his body.\n\nIn order to attack an opponent who is playing the ball on their right side, a player shall attack the opponent on the right side of the opponent with the ball in the middle of both players (i.e. the ball shall be on the left side of the attacking player).\n\nIn order to attack an opponent who is playing the ball on their left side, a player shall attack the opponent on the left side of the opponent with the ball in the middle of both players (i.e. the ball shall be on the right side of the attacking player).\n\nThe right of way is given to the player who follows or possesses the ball. In the penalty area, the right of way is lost in favour of the goalkeeper.\n\nIn recent years, an alternate form of the game known as \"Hardcourt Bike Polo\" has grown in popularity. In this variation, teams composed of three players compete on tennis courts, street hockey rinks, or whatever other surfaces are available. The rules vary slightly by city.\n\nGenerally this is a faster game with three members on a team and no substitutions, and with all members on the court at all times. A street hockey ball is used and matches are played until one team scores five points or time has expired, without playing chukkars. During tournament play, a time limit, such as 10 minutes, may be used to maximise the number of tournament rounds possible during the day.\n\nThere are three core rules of play:\n\nIn the case of a 'foot down' or 'dab' (touching the ground with one's foot) the player must \"tap out\" by riding to mid-court and hitting a designated area with their mallet. There is usually a tap-out located on either side of the court.\n\nIn order to score, the offensive player must hit the ball across the goal line using the narrow end of the mallet, called a \"shot\" or \"hit.\" Hitting the ball across the goal line with the wide end of the mallet is called a \"shuffle\".\n\nWhen a team scores a goal, the opposing team must retreat to their half and wait for the other team (player or ball, whichever comes first) to cross the halfway line before engaging in play again.\n\nThe North American Hardcourt Bike Polo Association has created an official ruleset, which has helped standardise rules across the globe.\n\nThe game was invented in County Wicklow, Ireland, in 1891 by retired champion cyclist Richard J. Mecredy, editor of \"The Irish Cyclist\" magazine. In October of that year the first cycle polo match was played at the Scalp (County Wicklow) between \"Rathclaren Rovers\" and the \"Ohne Hast Cycling Club\".\nTowards the end of the 19th century the game reached Great Britain, France, and the United States where the American Star Bicycle was a popular mount. The first international match was played between Ireland and England in 1901. Cycle polo was a demonstration sport at the 1908 London Olympics with Ireland winning, beating Germany.\n\nThe sport reached its peak of popularity in Great Britain during the 1930s with the introduction of the regional leagues. Cycle polo also flourished in France during this period with the establishment of the French league. Internationals between France and Great Britain were held regularly. However the Second World War marked the beginning of the demise of cycle polo in Britain. The sport remained in France though, with league championships held regularly until today.\n\nThe 1980s saw the rise of two new powers in cycle polo, India and the United States. The Bicycle Polo Association of America was created in 1994. International cycle polo matches staged a comeback in the 1990s with the first world championship organized in 1996 in the USA. Today there is organized cycle polo being played in Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, India, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland and USA. Cycle polo was officially recognized by the Union Cycliste Internationale in 2001.\n\nThe Cycle Polo Association of India was officially created in 1966 it has its office in Jaipur, Rajasthan. The first men's nationals were played in 1970 in New Delhi, with the team from Rajasthan emerging victorious.\n\nIn the 2016–17 season, the men's nationals were held in Jodhpur, Rajasthan from 13–16 January 2017. Indian Air Force was the champion and the Indian Army the runners-up. The 2016-17 women's nationals were held at Dundlod, Rajasthan from 21–24 February 2017. Chhattisgarh defeated Karnataka in the finals.\n\nThe Calcutta Cricket & Football Club hosted the first Merchant’s Cup Cycle Polo tournament in 1973. In 2012, the CC&FC had organised a Cycle Polo Legend's Tournament where great players of yesteryear such as Vijai Singh, Lakshman Singh and Bikram Das participated. Currently, the CC&FC plays host to the March Mug, the Swaroop Bhanjdeo Memorial Tournament and the CC&FC Trophy. Since 2015 onwards, CC&FC has been hosting the CC&FC All India Invitation Cycle Polo Cup which is organised jointly by the CC&FC along with the Cycle Polo Association of Bengal.\n\nIn 2017, the CC&FC All India Invitation Cycle Polo Cup had seven teams in the men's section and five in the women's section. Territorial Army were the eventual champions in the men's section. They defeated Indian Air Force 14:6 in the final. In the women section Chhattisgarh defeating in Bengal in the final. 15:3 was the score line. \n\nIn 2018, in the men's section, the defending champions Territorial Army successfully defended their title by defeating Bengal 12:10 in the final. In the women's section, Bengal easily overcame their opponents Uttar Pradesh 15:0 in the final.\n\nThe UK based Pukka Chukkas won the 2012 Acumen Energy Bicycle Polo Cup held at Tiger Tops Karnali on the fringes of the Bardia National Park in Nepal, beating EFG Switzerland in a thrilling final in front of a crowd of over 5,000. The bicycles used in the tournament were donated to local schools and social clubs, and money was raised for the prevention and cure of elephant tuberculosis.\n\nThe European Championships is an annual Bicycle Polo competition for European club teams. It is held over three legs each year in France, Germany, Ireland or United Kingdom of Great Britain. The competition began in 2007 following the compromise between French and British/Irish traditional rules.\n\n\n"}

She was also among the first women in New South Wales to become Justices of the Peace and served as president of the Women Justices Association from 1923 to 1926. Throughout her life she advocated for women's rights, health reform, and temperance.\n\nIn 1925 Preston-Stanley became the first female member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, representing the Eastern Suburbs as a member of the Nationalist Party, one of the historic predecessor parties to today's Liberal Party. After a failed bid in the 1921 election she persevered and picked the seat up in May 1925, and held the seat until September 1927.\n\nMillicent Fanny Stanley was born in Sydney in 1883. She was the daughter of Augustine Stanley, a greengrocer, and his wife Frances (née Preston). After her father deserted the family, her mother obtained a divorce and reverted to her birth name, which Millicent Fanny also adopted. She was actively involved in women's groups such as the Women's Liberal League and served as the president of the Feminist Club from 1919 to 1934 and from 1952 until her death in 1955.\n\nPreston-Stanley married Crawford Vaughan, former Premier of South Australia, in 1934. She died on 23 June 1955 in the Sydney suburb of Randwick from cerebro-vascular disease.\n\nMillicent Preston-Stanley served as the member for the Eastern Suburbs from 1925 to 1927, campaigning for maternal mortality, reform in child welfare, amendments to the Health Act and better housing. Millicent Preston-Stanley delivered her inaugural address to the Legislative Assembly of the New South Wales Parliament on 26 August 1925. Millicent Preston-Stanley used the opportunity to address her colleagues who did not believe that women had a role in politics. Some notable quotes include:\nIn addition, Millicent Preston-Stanley's inaugural address argued against reducing the forty-eight hour work week to forty-four hours, and pointed to the fact that the average woman works 112 hours per week.\n\nMillicent Preston-Stanley was the president of the Feminist Club of New South Wales from 1919 through to 1934, and again from 1936 to 1938. The club was amongst the organisations that successfully lobbied for the introduction of the Women's Legal Status Act 1918 which entitled women to stand for election in the Lower House and local government, and to become Justices of the Peace. Millicent was one of the first women in New South Wales to be appointed a Justice of the Peace. She was commissioned as a Justice of the Peace in 1921 and was President of the Women's Justices' Association from 1923 to 1926.\n\nA fervent supporter of the United Australia Party (UAP) — a precursor to the Liberal Party — Millicent Preston-Stanley brought the club to prominence in the 1930s. Under her leadership the club stood apart from many other women's organisations that existed in the period in that the latter — like the Australian Women's Guild of Empire — concerned themselves with matters revolving around home keeping, family, and religiosity. Their purpose was primarily evangelical, and social, helping to cultivate resources and gatherings for women to attend and exchange information and skills in craftwork like sewing, knitting and so forth. It was precisely the entrenched notion that politics did not form part of \"women's concerns\" that the feminist movement of the 1930s was sought to dislodge, and it was this apolitical focus that distinguished the women's organisations of the period from the Feminist Club of New South Wales. The Feminist Club's objective was \"to secure equality of liberty, status and opportunity in all spheres between men and women.’\n\nIn parliament she campaigned on the issues of women's mortality in childbirth, child welfare, institutional care for the mentally ill, and custody rights in divorce. She also lobbied for the rights of mothers to custody of their children, family planning and sex education, a focus on maternal and child health, and for a chair of obstetrics at the medical school, sarcastically calling for \"'Horses' rights for women\" after the University of Sydney instead established a course in veterinary obstetrics.\n\nShe personally took up the cause of actress Emélie Polini, who failed to regain custody of her daughter Patricia when she returned to her native England. Though her private member's bill on equal custody rights failed she continued the campaign. She wrote a play \"Whose Child?\" based on this case.\n\nShe left parliament in 1927 after an electoral redistribution of the newly created seat of Bondi saw her defeated at the polls.\n"}

It lies at the foot of the Dafnias mountains and the Chouni Pass.\n\nArchaeological excavations prove that the area around Ayios Vasilios has been settled since pre-historical times. Zygouries, west of Ayios Vasilios, was excavated by the American archaeologist Carl William Blegen in the 1920s. He found a Bronze Age settlement dating from approximately 1300 BC to 1320 BC. Sadly, agricultural work and forestry on Zygouries hill has destroyed one of the most important pre-historical settlements of the Balkans.\n\nObsidian, sherds of which can be found over the whole area (particularly south of Ayios Sostis (the cave of Antonis in the area of Boubakia), in the Chouni Pass southwest of the village, or near the caves on Dafnias mountain) are further proof of prehistoric settlement.\n\nRoman emperor Hadrian’s aqueduct from Lake Stymfalia passed through the village of Ayios Vasilios. Traces of it are still visible west of the village at the entrance to the Chouni Pass as well as in the village on the properties of Kafandaris and Vardakas. The settlement on the hill of present-day Archaies Kleones (\"Ancient Cleonae\"), northwest of Ayios Vasilios, was an important Roman settlement. Homer described the town as well built. Today, remains of the walls of an acropolis have been preserved on the northern part of the hill of Archaies Kleones. Recent archaeological excavations have uncovered a farmstead of a wealthy farmer with very beautiful mosaics in the area of Varella, northeast of Kleones.\n\nThe Frankish fortress, the ruins of which lie north of the village on Dafnias mountain overlooking the Chouni Pass, was built sometime between 1204 and 1250. It was built on the site of an earlier Mycenean fort. The archaeologist A. Bon, who excavated the fortress, was of the opinion that the fortress measured 225 m by 130 m in size.\n\nIn 1365, the fortress was listed in a tax document as belonging to the Florentine banker Niccolò Acciaioli. The same document also suggests that with the development of the fortress, the village had become a centre for the surrounding area. This is the earliest reference to the actual name Ayios Vasilios in any historical document.\n\nIn 1377, Ayios Vasilios (as Castello de Sancto Basile) is listed as one of the nine fortresses which existed in the Principality of Achaea. The town was described as having 85 houses. It was also claimed that it was the second largest settlement after Corinth in the principality.\n\nIn 1463, the village fell to the Venetians during the first Venetian-Ottoman war. In 1467, 1469, and 1471 the fortress was destroyed by various rulers. The Venetian census of 1700, shows Ayios Vasilios as having 27 families and 97 dwellers. The villagers were on average less than fifty years old.\n\nOn 26 July 1822 the Battle of Dervenakia (or Ayios Sostis) took place, which saw the defeat and elimination of the Ottoman forces under Dramali. After this battle, Kolokotronis placed guards in the fortress of Ayios Vasilios in order to prevent Ottoman supplies passing through the Chouni Pass.ff\n\nIn 1836 the village was declared a municipality (\"dimos\") and included the villages of Stefani, Archaies Kleones and Vousbardi. In 1845, the municipalities of Ayios Vasilios and Archaies Kleones were united. In 1885, Ayios Vasilios had 700 inhabitants. In 1912 the village was reduced to the status of \"kinotita\" or commune, consisting of one parish. In 1972 an additional parish, Ayios Dimitrios, was created in the village.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, Ayios Vasilios was famed for its honey melons. Today, the farms of the village produce olives, apricots, wheat, wine, tobacco and vegetables.\n\n\n"}

The division is located in the north-east of the state, adjoining the border with New South Wales. The largest settlements in the division are the regional cities of Wodonga, Wangaratta, and Benalla. Other towns in the electorate include Rutherglen, Mansfield, Beechworth, Myrtleford, Bright, Alexandra, Tallangatta, Corryong and a number of other small villages (notably including the ski resort of Falls Creek). While Indi is one of the largest electorates in Victoria, much of it is located within the largely uninhabited Australian Alps. While Wodonga serves as a regional hub for much of the more heavily populated northern part of the electorate, the southern part is closer to Melbourne than Wodonga.\n\nThe current member for Indi, since the 2019 federal election, is independent Helen Haines.\n\nIndi has existed continuously since Federation. The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. The most nationally prominent person to represent Indi to date was the first, Sir Isaac Isaacs, who rose to become Attorney-General of Australia, Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, and the first Australian-born Governor-General of Australia. Another member for Indi, John \"Black Jack\" McEwen, was a long-serving Minister and was briefly Prime Minister of Australia after the death of Harold Holt in 1967, but he was member for Murray by then. Indi has been held by a member of a conservative party (either the Liberal Party and its predecessors or the National Party) or a conservative independent for all but four terms since Federation, and without interruption since 1931. Labor last won the seat in 1928 when the Country incumbent forgot to renominate, and retained it in 1929. Since 2004, the Liberal primary vote has been in decline, falling from 63% in 2004, to 54% in 2007, 53% in 2010, 44% in 2013 and 27% in 2016.\n\nAt the 2013 election, independent Cathy McGowan unseated Liberal Party incumbent Sophie Mirabella, the only incumbent Liberal MP to lose his or her seat at the 2013 election. This was considered a major upset; Mirabella had gone into the election sitting on a margin of 59 percent, on the stronger side of fairly safe. Indeed, in a \"traditional\" two-party matchup, Mirabella would have retained the seat with a small swing in her favour against Labor.\n\nMcGowan retained Indi against Mirabella at the 2016 election with an increased 54.8% (+4.6) two-candidate-preferred vote. The Liberal \"traditional\" two-party-preferred vote was reduced to 54.4% (–4.7) against Labor's 45.6% (+4.7), a marginal two-party result not seen since the 1929 election.\n\nMcGowan retired in 2019 and was succeeded by fellow independent Haines, who suffered a swing of four percent against the Liberals from McGowan's 2016 vote and was elected on Labor preferences.\n\n"}

The gold trade, which began to flourish in the Bono state as early the 12th century, led to Akan power and wealth in the region during the medieval period.\n\nAccording to oral history, later supported by geneological evidence, the Akan people of the Bono state are said to have come from further north in the then-Ghana Empire, in what is now called the Sahel. Upon the introduction of Islam, Akan people who wished to preserve their traditional Akan religion migrated south.\n\nBono Manso (literally \"on the state of Bono\") was a trading area in the Bono state, and a major trading centre in what is now predominantly the Bono East region. Located just south of the Black Volta river, the town was frequented by caravans from Djenné and Timbuktu as part of the Trans-Saharan trade. Goods traded included kola nuts, salt, leather, and gold; gold was the most important trading good of the area starting in the mid-14th century.\n\nBegho (also \"Bighu\" or \"Bitu\"; called \"Bew\" and \"Nsokɔ\" by the Akan) was a trading town located south of the Black Volta in north-western Brong-Ahafo, near Bono Manso. The town, like Bono Manso, was of considerable importance as an entrepôt frequented by northern caravans from Mali from . Goods traded included gold, ivory, salt, leather, kola nuts, cloth, and copper alloys.\n\nExcavations in the area have revealed bare-walled structures dated between 1350 and 1750, as well as several types of pottery, smoking pipes, and evidence of iron smelting. With a probable population of over 10 000, Begho was one of the largest towns in the southern part of West Africa at the time of the arrival of the Portuguese in 1471.\n\nThe Malian king occupied Begho in the mid-16th century as a result of a \"perceived failure of the Begho Dyula to maintain supplies of gold,\" according to historian Peter Bakewell: \"As a result of the occupation of Bighu it seems clear that the Malian king gained access for a time to that part of the Akan gold trade which the Wangara were able to control.\"\n\nBonduku was another trading center within the Bono state, a predecessor to the state of Gyaman, notable for its production of cotton.\n\nBased on excavations, carbon dating, and local oral traditions, archaeologist Kwaku Effah-Gyamfi postulated three distinct urban phases. According to him, in the early phase during the 13th to 15th centuries, the urban center was relatively small, and the towns were populated by thousands of people, not all living in the urban center. Buildings were made of daubed wattle. Painted pottery of this period was found distributed within a radius of 3.3 km.\n\nIn the second phase, during the 16th to 17th centuries, the urban centers were larger, consisting mainly of evenly distributed houses and a nuclear market center. Many indications of participation in long-distance trade, such as imported glass beads and mica coated pottery, stem from this period.\n\nThe fall of Bono state occurred during the rise of more Akan nations, especially the exodus of various subgroups of Akans from the Bono state. Several factors weakened this state, including conflicts among the leadership, conflicts due to taxation, and no direct access to the coast of Gold Coast, where trade was helping many Akan states have more influence.\n\nVarious aspects of Akan culture stem from the Bono state, including the umbrella used for the kings, the swords of the nation, the stools, goldsmithing, blacksmithing, Kente Cloth weaving, and goldweighing.\n"}

It is a joyful, spiritual song with few lyrics, which runs 2:43. The 12\" single is a substantially extended three-part suite which runs over ten minutes. This song was a replacement for \"The Line\", an upbeat jam featuring Boni Boyer and Sheila E. on backing vocals.\n\nPart One of the mix starts with a stripped-down version of the \"Lovesexy\" album song, remixed with a dance beat. The original drum programming and rhythmic electric guitar riffs are deleted for much of the song.\n\nPart Two is a gospel rendition with new lyrics, continuing the spiritual theme. This part of the song was often sung in concert during the Lovesexy World Tour. The beginning of this section paraphrases lyrics from \"Housequake\", from the previous album \"Sign \"☮\" the Times\". Prince also quotes the film \"Scarface\" with the lines \"Say hello to my little friend...\" and then introduces the \"Blue Angel\", a new blue version of his custom \"White Cloud\" guitar featured in the film \"Purple Rain\". Sheila E. is also given a call out, and her voice can be heard responding in this section.\n\nPart Three is based on an outtake called \"Take This Beat\" and deviates quite a bit from the original theme. This segment has Prince using his \"Jamie Starr\" persona to humorously tout the fact that he's funky, musically talented, and has plenty of beats (songs) that are \"so fine\". The song ends with a looped repeat of the title. This version of the song became one of the highlights during the supporting tour in which Prince would usually order the house lights to be turned up, and instruct the crowd during a call and response segment.\n\nThe B-side, \"Scarlet Pussy\", is credited to Prince's alter ego, Camille. The song is very sexual, using metaphors of cats and dogs for sexual organs, a theme Prince previously used for the B-side \"La, La, La, He, He, Hee\". Prince uses his sped-up Camille vocals, as well as a slowed-down vocal, similar to \"Bob George\" from \"The Black Album\". The song features a saxophone solo from Eric Leeds. The decision to include such a raunchy song with the spiritual A-side was noteworthy. The edit of \"Scarlet Pussy\" was included on 1993's \"The Hits/The B-Sides\".\n\n\n\n"}

A fist bump can also be a symbol of giving respect or approval, as well as companionship between two people. It can be followed by various other hand and body gestures (such as immediately opening the palm and spreading the fingers for “knucks with explosions”) and may be part of a dap greeting. It is commonly used in baseball and hockey as a form of celebration with teammates, and with opposition players at the end of a game. In cricket it is a common celebratory gesture between batting partners. Fist bumps are often given as a form of friendly congratulation.\n\nA fist bump, according to Merriam-Webster, is a gesture in which two people bump their fists together (as in greeting or celebration).\n\nThe gesture is performed when two participants each form a closed fist with one hand and then lightly tap the front of their fists together. A participant's fists may be either vertically oriented (perpendicular to the ground) or horizontally oriented. Unlike the standard handshake, which is typically performed only with each participant’s right hand, a fist bump may be performed with participants using either hand.\n\nThe \"fist bump\" or \"pound\" can be traced to boxers instructed to touch gloves at the start of a contest. Likewise, dart players bump fists that are clutching pointed mini-arrows. The modern gesture may have arisen spontaneously on city basketball courts, and was popularized by basketball player Fred Carter in the 1970s.\n\nOthers trace the gesture to the Wonder Twins, minor characters in the 1970s Hanna-Barbera superhero cartoon \"Super Friends\", who touched knuckles and cried \"Wonder Twin powers, activate!\"\n\nBaseball Hall of Famer Stan Musial used the fist bump during the 1950–60s as an alternative to shaking hands. Musial was convinced that he was catching too many colds by picking up germs while shaking thousands of hands each year, so he adopted the fist bump as a friendly alternative.\n\nSmithsonian researcher LaMont Hamilton suggests that the dap originated during the Vietnam War as a modified form of the Black Power salute, which was prohibited by the US military.\n\nPat Benatar is seen giving another dancer a fist bump at the end of her 1983 video for the song \"Love Is a Battlefield.\"\n\nThe fist bump was first seen in Australia in September 1990 at the Wetherill Park Indoor Cricket Centre between two opening batsmen, Mick Tyler and Bob Minney. At the completion of the first successful batting over for the pair, they met mid-pitch and fist bumped with their batting gloves. They continued to fist bump for the remainder of the game and it continued into the future. Now this act can be seen on various sporting fields/arenas around Australia, and it is now commonly practiced at an international level; many international cricketers fist bump in between overs or as congratulations after a six has been hit.\n\nIn light of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the Dean of Medicine at the University of Calgary, Tom Feasby, suggested that the fist bump may be a \"nice replacement of the handshake\" in an effort to prevent transmission of the virus. Similarly, a medical study has found that fist bumps and high fives spread fewer germs than handshakes.\n\nFist bumping behavior has also been observed in chimpanzees, according to a book written by Margaret Power in 1991.\n\nIn early June 2008, the Fox News Channel ran a news piece about a fist bump of Barack Obama and his wife at the end of one of Obama's meetings in his presidential running. In it, anchor E. D. Hill said the gesture may be a \"terrorist fist jab\". Fox later apologized for the term.\n\nBecause of the reduced skin contact and resulting bacterial transfer, one study has recommended that the fist bump and high five be adopted as a more hygienic alternative to the handshake.\n\n"}

He wrote the latter's sequels \"\", \"\" (which he also directed) and \"\".\n\nNeumeier studied journalism at the University of California at Santa Cruz then attended the School of Motion Picture and Television at University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). After completing his bachelor's degree at UCLA, Neumeier started work in the Hollywood film business, as a production assistant on the TV series \"Taxi.\" He went on to become a script reader in the Story Analyst's Union, working at Paramount Pictures and Columbia Pictures. During his time at Columbia, he advocated for putting \"Risky Business\" into production; after the film became an unexpected success, he moved on to a job as a junior executive at the Universal Pictures company.\n\nNeumeier wrote his first outlines and film treatments for his first movie, \"RoboCop\", as well as other spec scripts. He declined an offer of a vice-presidency at Universal Pictures, to develop the screenplay for \"RoboCop\", with Michael Miner.\n\nThe rights to the screenplay were bought up by the Orion Pictures company, and was granted a budget of just under $15 million. Paul Verhoeven was assigned to make the movie.\n\nNeumeier also co-produced \"RoboCop\", which was released in movie theaters in 1987 in North America and some other locations. This movie was a success, and it drew just over 50 million dollars' worth of ticket sales in the United States alone. The success of \"RoboCop\" also motivated the production of two sequels, \"RoboCop 2\" and \"RoboCop 3\", and also two TV series, one live-action and one animated. Most of the creators of \"RoboCop\" had left before the production of these sequels.\n\nIn January 2018, it was announced that Neumeier was writing a direct sequel to the 1987 film that would ignore the two previous sequels and the 2014 remake. “We’re not supposed to say too much. There’s been a bunch of other RoboCop movies and there was recently a remake and I would say this would be kind of going back to the old RoboCop we all love and starting there and going forward. So it’s a continuation really of the first movie. In my mind. So it’s a little bit more of the old school thing” Neumeier said.\n\nThe first sequel to \"RoboCop\", \"RoboCop 2\", was planned to have its screenplay written by Neumeier and Miner. He and Miner had written a dated rough first draft of a screenplay for \"RoboCop 2\" in 1988 called The Corporate Wars. However, due to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, Neumeier was unable to write any more of the screenplay. The Orion Pictures company next decided to hire the comic book artist Frank Miller to work on his own screenplay for \"RoboCop 2\".\n\nA decade after the first \"RoboCop\" movie was produced, Neumeier rejoined Paul Verhoeven to work on \"Starship Troopers\", which was adapted from the novel with the same name by Robert A. Heinlein in 1959. With violence and satire thrown into a story of efforts by the human race to ensure its survival (in ways similar to \"RoboCop\" at times), \"Starship Troopers\" was more successful in Europe, Asia, etc., than in North America where it drew gross ticket sales of about $54 million at theaters, although Artforum magazine selected this film as one of the \"10 most artistic [film] achievements of 1997\". Neumeier also appeared in this film in the brief role of a man convicted of murder and sentenced to immediate execution.\n\nIn January 2018 it was announced that Neumeier was writing a direct sequel to the 1987 classic film that would ignore both sequels and the 2014 remake. \"We're not supposed to say too much. There's been a bunch of other RoboCop movies and there was recently a remake and I would say this would be kind of going back to the old RoboCop we all love and starting there and going forward. So it's a continuation really of the first movie. In my mind. So it's a little bit more of the old school thing,\" Neumeier said.” In July 2018, it was confirmed a new film, titled \"RoboCop Returns\", was in development, with Neill Blomkamp directing and Justin Rhodes rewriting an original script by Neumeier and Michael Miner. In 2019, Neumeier said that Blomkemp wanted \"RoboCop Returns\" to be as close to the 1987 film as possible saying that Blomkemp feels that \"it should be the proper Verhoeven if Verhoeven had directed a movie right after \"RoboCop\". On June 29, 2019, Blomkamp confirmed that the original RoboCop suit would be used in this film saying \"1 million% original\" when answering a fan's question on Twitter. Blomkamp also gave an update on the script saying \"“Script is being written. Going well! Imagine watching Verhoeven do a follow up film.”\n\nNeumeier is father to two adult children, Casey Neumeier and autistic activist Shain Mahaffey Neumeier.\n\n"}

However, Miike's portrayal of the character (or rather his spirit) transcends reality (and time and space) and is more of a surrealist exposé of Izo's exceedingly bloody yet philosophical encounters in an afterlife heavy on symbolism, occasionally interrupted by stock footage of World War II accompanied by acid-folk singer Kazuki Tomokawa on guitar. Kazuya Nakayama plays Izo and the many characters he encounters on his journey include figures played by Takeshi Kitano and Bob Sapp.\n\n\n\"Izo\" was awarded the best Special Effects prize at the Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival.\n\nReviews\nSee also\n"}

An electronic song, \"Jóga\" fuses these elements with baroque and classical styles. The track's sound was partially inspired by Icelandic music, containing what have been described as \"volcanic beats\". Lyrically, the piece is an ode to Björk's native land and her best friend, while containing subtexts relating to emergency. \n\n\"Jóga\" has been critically acclaimed ever since its release, with reviewers praising her powerful vocal performance, as well as the track's composition and overall production. Commercially, the song was a moderate success, charting in several international markets. In Iceland the song was very popular and peaked at number 1.\n\n\"Jóga\" is dedicated to —and named after— Björk's best friend, Jóhanna \"Jóga\" Johannsdóttir (the wife of former Mayor of Reykjavík City Jón Gnarr), who is usually thanked in her album credits. Like the rest of the album, it was produced at El Cortijo in Málaga, Spain. She wrote the song while walking and admiring the landscape, a common way for her to write songs since childhood. \n\nBjörk explained \"an overall picture\" of it to engineer Markus Dravs, who then came out with a rhythm that she felt was \"too abstract\". Mark Bell, the producer of the track, then came and \"took 99 percent of what [he] did and came up with some noises\", giving Dravs new ideas. The singer wrote the string arrangements, which were provided late in the production process by the Icelandic String Octet.\n\nThe song is also a dedication to her native Iceland, an example of Björk's desire to have a conceptual focus on the country for \"Homogenic\". Referring to this concept, she told \"OOR\": \"The electronic beats are the rhythm, the heartbeat. The violins create the old fashioned atmosphere, the colouring.\" \n\n\"Jóga\" has been described as \"the real conceptual heart of the record\" and \"a sonic picture of the geographical beauty of her homeland\". The track showcases these hybrid elements of strings and electronic backing beats through the album, thus being described as \"baroque electronica\" by \"Slant Magazine\"'s Sal Cinquemani. \n\nThe strong beats —referred to as \"volcanic\"— reflect Iceland's primal and chaotic nature. Due to its harsh beats and halfway drop, some modern critics have described the track as \"proto dubstep\".\n\n\"Jóga\" is a love song; its lyrics were written by poet Sjón, a friend and frequent collaborator of the singer. Björk explained her inability to write the song's lyrics in an interview with MuchMusic: \"I tried to write that tune but, I mean, I just wanted mainly to write lyrics. It was just pathetic. I was like \"her... her...\" it was like \"love... love...\" I couldn't even put it into words. So, you know, it's -- yeah, it's probably the—I think it's the fiercest love song I have written, I think.\" She sings about the beauty of being in a \"state of emergency\", and thanks someone for pushing her into it.\n\n\"Jóga\" has received acclaim from music critics ever since its release. Heather Phares of Allmusic wrote that \"Björk lets a little light shine through \"Jóga\"\" and described it as a \"moving song\", listing it as one of the album highlights. Furthermore, Sal Cinquemani of \"Slant Magazine\" labelled the track \"adrenaline\". \n\nDavid Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" also commented on \"Jóga\", writing that it was more \"somber\" than another single from \"Homogenic\", \"Bachelorette\", and Björk sings the lyrics with \"the strings swelling luxuriantly\". Robert Christgau, in his review for the album, placed it as one of the recommended tracks alongside \"Bachelorette\". \n\nIn \"Slant Magazine\"s list of the Best Singles of the 1990s, \"Jóga\" was placed 35th; alongside the ranking, the track was praised, said to contain \"one of the Icelandic singer-songwriter's fiercest vocal performances to date\", as well as that the \"sweeping string arrangement is its true star\".\n\nThe music video was directed by Michel Gondry and filmed in Iceland.\n\nThe video for \"Jóga\" is a departure from her other videos as it focuses primarily on different Icelandic terrains and landscapes with Björk's presence only in the beginning and towards the end. With the aid of computer animation, earthquakes begin to separate and shift the chunks of land along fault lines. The video ends with a computerized image of an island floating inside Björk's chest.\n\nThe song \"No Bystanders\", from American rapper Travis Scott's third album \"Astroworld\", samples Jóga.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The CFSP was to include ‘all questions related to the security of the Union, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence’.\n\nIn December 1998 the Franco-British Saint-Malo declaration stated that the EU ‘must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed up by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises’.

{"id": "1995253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995253", "title": "René Leibowitz", "text": "René Leibowitz\n\nRené Leibowitz (; 17 February 1913 – 29 August 1972) was a Polish, later naturalised French, composer, conductor, music theorist and teacher. He was historically significant in promoting the music of the Second Viennese School in Paris after the Second World War, and teaching a new generation of serialist composers.\n\nLeibowitz remained firmly committed to the musical aesthetic of Arnold Schoenberg, and was to some extent sidelined among the French avant-garde in the 1950s, when, under the influence of Leibowitz's former student, Pierre Boulez and others, the music of Schoenberg's pupil Anton Webern was adopted as the orthodox model by younger composers.\n\nAlthough his compositional ideas remained strictly serialist, as a conductor Leibowitz had broad sympathies, performing works by composers as diverse as Gluck, Beethoven, Brahms, Offenbach and Ravel, and his repertory extended to include pieces by Gershwin, Puccini, Sullivan and Johann Strauss.\n\nThe facts about Leibowitz's early years are problematical, complicated by his practice of reinventing his history, but it is known that he was born in Warsaw, Poland. According to his pupil and translator, Jan Maguire, who wrote two studies of him for \"Tempo\" magazine in the late 1970s, Leibowitz was of Russian Jewish parentage; his father was an art historian. During the First World War the family was obliged to move from Warsaw to Berlin, where, Maguire writes, Leibowitz began a career as a concert violinist at the age of ten. That career was interrupted when the family moved to Paris three years later. By Maguire's account Leibowitz taught himself \"the fundamentals of harmony, counterpoint and score-reading\" while in high school, and took his Baccalauréat when he was seventeen. At this point, his history becomes unclear. By his own account, credited by Maguire and others, he then went to Vienna to study with Anton Webern. By other accounts he studied with Arnold Schoenberg. Neither is now believed to be correct: Sabine Meine wrote in the \"Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" in 2001, \"Leibowitz’s claims of having met Schoenberg and studied with Webern in the early 1930s remain unsubstantiated\", and in 2012 Nicole Gagné wrote in the \"Historical Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Classical Music\", \"despite his claims to the contrary, he never studied with Arnold Schoenberg or Anton Webern\". Other claims about Leibowitz's teachers – that he studied composition with Maurice Ravel and conducting with Pierre Monteux – have been discounted by some writers in the present century, although as recently as 2010 in a study mainly focused on American composers Deborah Fillerup Weagel repeated the statement that Leibowitz was a pupil of Webern and Ravel. There is no mention of Leibowitz in the biographies of Ravel by Arbie Orenstein (1991) and Roger Nichols (2011) or of Monteux by John Canarina (2003).\n\nIn Paris, according to Maguire, Leibowitz earned his living as a jazz pianist and composed constantly. In his early twenties he married an artist from an illustrious French family and settled down in Paris, eventually taking French nationality. During the early 1930s he was introduced to Schoenberg's twelve-note technique by the German pianist and composer Erich Itor Kahn. Maguire writes that Leibowitz easily fitted into \"the ebullient intellectual and artistic climate of Paris in the pre-war years\". His aesthetic interests were not confined to music, and he became friendly with leading figures from the world of modern art, notably André Masson and Pablo Picasso, and with literary figures including Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Albert Camus. For Leibowitz, according to Maguire, composing was his most regular activity, and the one he thought most important, although he was known more for his commentaries, his critical and analytical writings, his conducting, and his teaching, all of which he considered secondary.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded France in the Second World War, Leibowitz was interned as an alien for a time. He did not succeed in emigrating, but, as the musicologist Reinhardt Kapp puts it, \"managed to survive somehow, partly hidden by [Georges] Bataille in Paris, at other times with his family in the Unoccupied Zone\". While in wartime Paris he clandestinely taught students from the Paris Conservatoire. In 1944, just before the liberation of Paris, there was a party at the Left Bank apartment of the Swiss artist Balthus attended by artistic opponents of the Nazis, such as Picasso and others; Leibowitz provided the music.\n\nAfter the liberation Leibowitz resumed his interrupted career, teaching, conducting and writing, drawing on the extensive material he had produced during his enforced wartime seclusion. In 1947–48 and again in 1950 he visited Los Angeles to meet Schoenberg, whose cantata \"A Survivor from Warsaw\" he transcribed into full score. Many of the works of the Second Viennese School were first heard in France at the International Festival of Chamber Music established by Leibowitz in Paris in 1947. Leibowitz was highly influential in promoting the reputation of the School, both through teaching in Paris after the war and through his book \"Schoenberg et son école\", published in 1947 and translated by Dika Newlin as \"Schoenberg and his School\" (US and UK editions 1949). The book was among the earliest theoretical treatises on Schoenberg's twelve-tone method of composition; Leibowitz (like Humphrey Searle) was among the first theorists to promulgate the term \"serialism\". The book attracted hostile criticism from composers on various points of the modernist continuum. Aaron Copland condemned its \"dogmatic and fanatical\" tone, and Milton Babbitt felt that its musical discussions were superficial, with misleading analogies between tonal and dodecaphonic music, but it was well received by the musical public.\n\nLeibowitz's advocacy of the Schoenberg school was taken further by two of his pupils, Pierre Boulez and Jacques-Louis Monod, each taking different paths in promoting the music of Schoenberg, Webern and the development of serialism. Meine writes in \"Grove\" that during the 1950s Leibowitz's writings came under attack from some of the younger generation: Boulez and others accused him of \"dogmatic orthodoxy and academicism\". In the view of another pupil, Maguire, Boulez, having learned the twelve-tone technique from Leibowitz, \"proceeded to apply it indiscriminately to every musical element, disregarding the most fundamental qualities, the essence of music\". Leibowitz warned his former student, \"But the public has not yet assimilated Schoenberg\", and tried, unsuccessfully, to avoid a rancorous falling out.\n\nAlthough Leibowitz composed continually, he seldom pressed to have his works performed. When he died, leaving an oeuvre of nearly a hundred pieces, the magazine \"Esprit\" commented, \"Modest, perhaps too modest, he never spoke of his works, unless obliged to do so, doing nothing to get them played. It is certainly no exaggeration to say that at least three quarters of his scores have never been heard.\" Since his death a representative sample of his works have been recorded. A 2013 CD set from the Divox label contains recordings of 22 of Leibowitz's works: 6 Mélodies, Op. 6; Flute Sonata, Op. 12b; \"Explanation of Metaphors\", Op. 15; Duo for Cello and Piano, Op. 23; 5 Pieces for clarinet and piano, Op. 29; Sérénade, Op. 38; 3 Poèmes, Op. 46; Violin Concerto, Op. 50; \"Marijuana variations non sérieuses\", Op. 54; Toccata, Op. 62; 3 Caprices, Op. 70; 2 Settings, Op. 71; 3 Poèmes, Op. 73; \"Motifs\", Op. 74; Petite suite, Op. 75; 2 poèmes, Op. 76a; \"Chanson dada\", Op. 76b; Suite, Op. 81; 4 Lieder, Op. 86; 3 Intermezzi, Op. 87; \"Laboratoire central\", Op. 88; and 3 Poèmes, Op. 92.\n\nAlthough Leibowitz was receptive to a wide range of musical styles, he could not bear the music of Sibelius, and published a pamphlet about him under the title of \"Sibelius: the Worst Composer in the World\"; he also severely criticised Bartók for writing music that was too accessible: Leibowitz felt that by failing to adopt dodecaphony in his later works Bartók was pandering to popular taste rather than helping to move music away from tonality in accordance with Leibowitz's notions of historical inevitability and composers' duty. For Leibowitz, to write a popular work like Bartók's Concerto for Orchestra was a betrayal of modernism.\n\n\"Grove\" has articles on thirty-two composers who studied with Leibowitz in Paris or attended his sessions at Darmstadt or elsewhere: as well as Boulez and Monod, they include Vinko Globokar; Hans Werner Henze; Diego Masson; Serge Nigg; and Bernd Alois Zimmermann.\n\nThe writer Joan Peyser summed up Leibowitz's career:\n\nLeibowitz's obituarist in \"Esprit\" dismissed this as simplistic:\nLeibowitz died suddenly in Paris on 29 August 1972, at the age of 59.\n\nIn the early LP era, in the 1950s, Leibowitz conducted complete recordings of seven operas, which were generally well received, and have mostly been reissued on CD. They were Bizet's \"Les Pêcheurs de perles\"; Gluck's \"Alceste\" and \"L'ivrogne corrigé\"; Mozart's \"Zaïde\"; Offenbach's \"La Belle Hélène\" and \"Orphée aux enfers\"; and Ravel's \"L'Heure espagnole\". A set of Ravel's orchestral works was less well reviewed, but Leibowitz received qualified praise for his set of Schoenberg's \"Gurre-Lieder\" (\"Leibowitz makes a serious attempt to produce a convincing performance; his slow tempi find justification in Schoenberg's markings, but his artists cannot persuade us that \"Gurre-Lieder\" is other than an historical curiosity\").\n\nIn 1961 Leibowitz conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in a set of Beethoven's symphonies made by Decca for \"Reader's Digest\"; it was among the first to attempt to follow Beethoven's metronome markings, following the pioneering set made in Vienna three years earlier, conducted by Hermann Scherchen. Reviewers observed that although Scherchen had achieved tempos more closely approaching the composer's markings, Leibowitz, at speeds not much slower, had secured better ensemble than the earlier set achieved. Initially the set was poorly received. \"The Stereo Record Guide\" called the performances \"slack\", \"perfunctory\" and \"insensitive\"; on its reissue in the 1980s a \"Gramphone\" reviewer thought much of the set \"light-weight\" and \"lacking in \"gravitas\"\", although he found the performance of the Seventh Symphony \"magnificent\". In 1995 Richard Taruskin, analysing a selection of Beethoven recordings, concluded that Leibowitz, like Scherchen, delivered performances that were musically and musicologically superior to more recent attempts by \"authentic\" conductors such as Christopher Hogwood. By the 21st century the performances had come to seem old-fashioned, in the view of a critic in \"Fanfare\", who found them more akin to those by Herbert von Karajan than to those by specialist authenticists such as Roger Norrington and John Eliot Gardiner.\n\nWith the Decca team, Leibowitz recorded eleven more albums between 1959 and 1962. They included large-scale works such as \"The Rite of Spring\", symphonies by Mozart, Schubert, Schumann, and concertos by Grieg, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Prokofiev, as well as short pieces by more than thirty composers ranging from Bach to Gershwin, from Wagner to Sullivan, Puccini and Johann Strauss.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Rudra play a uniquely composed avant garde blend of styles, including, among others, black metal-influenced death metal with interpolations and extended passages of traditional Carnatic music. \nThe lyrical content is derived from Sanskrit Vedic literature and philosophy with, ancient mantras (shlokas) incorporated into the song structures. The band describes the style as Vedic metal.\n\nRudra was formed in mid-1992 as a trio, then made up of Kathir (bass, vocals), Shiva(drums) and Bala (guitar). It was then known as Rudhra. A fourth member, Selvam, was recruited to supplement Bala on guitar. With this line-up they released a 4-track demo, \"The Past\", in 1994. Prior to this release, Rudhra was also featured in a few underground death metal compilation albums with Singaporean underground metal bands.\n\nIn early 1996, the band had a hiatus and the members were involved in separate bands. Towards the end of 1996, Kathir decided to resurrect Rudhra with a slight alteration to its name; thus Rudra (the most common English transliteration for the Sanskrit word) was born. Kathir teamed up with Shiva and started work in the studio, soon to be joined by Bala and Alvin Chua to complete the line up before recording the self-titled debut album in late 1997, which was released in June 1998. The band played a couple of gigs and also starting work on new material. The band replaced its two guitarists with Selvam (ex-member) and Kannan in January 2000.\n\nWith that line-up Rudra released its second album, \"The Aryan Crusade\", in September 2001. In January 2002, \"Big O\" magazine named this album as one of the top 40 albums of the year. In July 2003, Rudra released a third album Kurukshetra, named after the battlefield featured in the Indian epic the Mahabharata, Kurukshetra.\n\nAfter touring in Singapore, India, Indonesia and Thailand, Rudra released \"\", in April 2005. \"Brahmavidya: Primordial I\" represents a slight shift in the band's sound as it exhibits more black metal influences than the previous albums and presents a denser recording that showcases the band's progressive move into more dynamic leads, complex bass-lines, and tighter, faster drumming with a bigger emphasis on blast beats. With this release, Rudra toured the USA in January 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Kannan was replaced by Devan. In 2009, Rudra released \"Brahmavidya: Transcendental I\" as the second chapter in the Brahmavidya trilogy. They have collaborated with Singapore director Jacen Tan on the music video for Hymns from the Blazing Chariot. In 2009, the band went through another line up change with Vinod replacing longtime member Selvam.\n\nIn August 2010, Rudra headlined the first day of Baybeats, an annual 3-day alternative music festival, held in Singapore. This was probably one of the rarest moments in history where an Extreme Metal band headlines a non-metal music festival. The band has also invited the interest of musicologists and research papers have been published about both Vedic Metal and the band.\n\nIn November 2011, Rudra announced that they will be closing the 2011 Brahmavidya Tour by headlining the \"Strawberry Fields Rock Fest\" @ Bangalore, India. It has been more than 7 years since the band last played Bangalore.\n\nIn July 2011, Devan left the band to focus on his personal life. Subash joined the band officially in January 2012 to replace Devan.\n\nIn 2013 Simon joined the band to replace Subash. Simon makes his debut in RTA.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1995262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995262", "title": "Zorba the Greek", "text": "Zorba the Greek\n\nZorba the Greek (, , Life and Times of Alexis Zorbas) is a novel written by the Cretan author Nikos Kazantzakis, first published in 1946. It is the tale of a young Greek intellectual who ventures to escape his bookish life with the aid of the boisterous and mysterious Alexis Zorba. The novel was adapted into a successful 1964 film of the same name by Michael Cacoyannis as well as a 1968 musical, \"Zorba\" and a two-part BBC \"Classic Serial\" in 1993 starring Robert Stephens as Zorba and Michael Maloney.\n\nThe book opens in a café in Piraeus, just before dawn on a gusty autumn morning. The year is most likely 1916. The narrator, a young Greek intellectual, resolves to set aside his books for a few months after being stung by the parting words of a friend, Stavridakis, who has left for the Russian Caucasus to help some Pontic Greeks (in that region often referred to as Caucasus Greeks) who are being persecuted. He sets off for Crete to re-open a disused lignite mine and immerse himself in the world of peasants and working-class people.\n\nHe is about to begin reading his copy of Dante's \"Divine Comedy\" when he feels he is being watched; he turns around and sees a man of around sixty peering at him through the glass door. The man enters and immediately approaches him to ask for work. He claims expertise as a chef, a miner, and player of the \"santuri\", or cimbalom, and introduces himself as Alexis Zorba, a Greek born in Romania. The narrator is fascinated by Zorba's lascivious opinions and expressive manner and decides to employ him as a foreman. On their way to Crete, they talk on a great number of subjects, and Zorba's soliloquies set the tone for a large part of the book.\n\nOn arrival, they reject the hospitality of Anagnostis and Kondomanolious the café-owner, and on Zorba's suggestion make their way to Madame Hortense's hotel, which is nothing more than a row of old bathing-huts. They are forced by circumstances to share a bathing-hut. The narrator spends Sunday roaming the island, the landscape of which reminds him of \"good prose, carefully ordered, sober… powerful and restrained\" and reads Dante. On returning to the hotel for dinner, the pair invite Madame Hortense to their table and get her to talk about her past as a courtesan. Zorba gives her the pet-name \"Bouboulina\" (likely inspired by the Greek heroine) while he takes the pet-name \"Canavaro\" (after real-life Admiral Canevaro, a past lover claimed by Hortense).\n\nThe next day, the mine opens and work begins. The narrator, who has socialist ideals, attempts to get to know the workers, but Zorba warns him to keep his distance: \"Man is a brute... If you're cruel to him, he respects and fears you. If you're kind to him, he plucks your eyes out.\" Zorba himself plunges into the work, which is characteristic of his overall attitude, which is one of being absorbed in whatever one is doing or whomever one is with at that moment. Quite frequently Zorba works long hours and requests not to be interrupted while working. The narrator and Zorba have a great many lengthy conversations, about a variety of things, from life to religion, each other's past and how they came to be where they are now, and the narrator learns a great deal about humanity from Zorba that he otherwise had not gleaned from his life of books and paper.\n\nThe narrator absorbs a new zest for life from his experiences with Zorba and the other people around him, but reversal and tragedy mark his stay on Crete. His one-night stand with a beautiful passionate widow is followed by her public decapitation. Alienated by the villagers' harshness and amorality, he eventually returns to the mainland once his and Zorba's ventures are completely financially spent. Having overcome one of his own demons (such as his internal \"no,\" which the narrator equates with the Buddha, whose teachings he has been studying and about whom he has been writing for much of the narrative, and who he also equates with \"the void\") and having a sense that he is needed elsewhere (near the end of the novel, the narrator has a premonition of the death of his old friend Stavridakis, which plays a role in the timing of his departure to the mainland), the narrator takes his leave of Zorba for the mainland, which, despite the lack of any major outward burst of emotionality, is significantly emotionally wrenching for both Zorba and the narrator. It almost goes without saying that the two (the narrator and Zorba) will remember each other for the duration of their natural lives.\n\nThe narrator and Zorba never see each other again, although Zorba sends the narrator letters over the years, informing him of his travels and work, and his marriage to a 25-year-old woman. The narrator does not accept Zorba's invitation to visit. Eventually the narrator receives a letter from Zorba's wife, informing him of Zorba's death (which the narrator had a premonition of). Zorba's widow tells the narrator that Zorba's last words were of him, and in accordance with her dead husband's wishes, she wants the narrator to visit her home and take Zorba's \"santuri.\"\n\n\n"}

It is just west of the Western By-Pass Road, part of the Oxford Ring Road (A34). The nearest village is Godstow.\n\nWytham was the northernmost part of Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred it to Oxfordshire. The toponym is first recorded as \"Wihtham\" around AD 957, and comes from the Old English for a homestead or village in a river-bend.\n\nThe manor of Wytham, along with Wytham Abbey (not a religious foundation but the manor house) and much of the village, was formerly owned by the Earls of Abingdon. The Church of England parish church of All Saints was originally a medieval building but it was extensively rebuilt between 1811 and 1812 by Montagu Bertie, 5th Earl of Abingdon.\n\nThe ruins of the former Godstow Nunnery lie just east of the village.\n\nDuring World War II, in about 1941, the owners of Wytham Abbey agreed to take in six East End children, as part of the evacuee programme. This was in preference to a number of Canadian infantry, whom they were also asked to accommodate. As the war progressed they got the Canadian infantry anyway. The evacuees were educated by a governess, and returned to the East End with impeccable accents. Outings were in a big car to the local chip shop. When the infantry arrived, the young soldiers took the evacuees on their tanks as they trained in the woods, crashing into trees.\n\nThe owners of the Abbey were Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (cousin of the Queen Mother) and her husband, a diamond millionaire. When he died suddenly, the evacuees were moved to less comfortable accommodation. The Infantry went off to war. A photo of the evacuees standing on the grand staircase of the Abbey, below a bronze statue of a horse, appeared in a national newspaper, the \"News Chronicle\". The Abbey was sold by the University of Oxford in 1992 and is now in private hands. The secret room in which the diamond millionaire was said to keep his diamonds is still there, but with no diamonds.\n\nWytham Woods is an area of long-established mixed woodland noted for its high population of badgers and long-term monitoring of great tits. It is on rising ground to the west of the village and covers 1000 acres. The woods are a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The University of Oxford has owned the woods since 1942 and uses them for research in zoology and climate change. The University has a field station north of the village. It is claimed to be one of the most researched pieces of woodland in the world. The woods are open to the public by permit which are available on application, for walking but are closed to dogs, horses and bicycles.\n\nA named path within the wood is called the Singing Way. It is aligned with Oxford and got its name because monks on pilgrimage from Cirencester to Canterbury would break into song here as they sighted the town and the end of their day's journey.\n\nOn 7 October 2017 an Oxfordshire Blue Plaque was unveiled at the Keeper's Hill car park in Wytham Woods, commemorating the bequest of the woods to the University of Oxford in 1942 by Raymond and Hope ffennell.\n\nWytham village and Wytham Woods have frequently featured in the \"Inspector Morse\" detective novels by Colin Dexter, most notably in \"The Way Through the Woods\".\n"}

They are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions across the world. \n\nThe emballonurids include some of the smallest of all bats, and range from 3.5 to 10 cm in body length. They are generally brown or grey, although the species of genus \"Diclidurus\" are white. The faces are said to be handsome, the heads being comparable to those of domestic dogs, and their wings are long and narrow. As with other microchiropteran families, they use ultrasonic echolocation to sense the surrounding environment and their prey; the signals of some species are unusual in being audible to humans.\n\nThe wing surface extends between the legs, a membrane known as a uropatagium, and the structure of these is a characteristic in many of the genera. They have tails which are partially enclosed, a short part of which projects through the uropatagium to form a sheath. The usual arrangement of the uropatagium is as to be fixed to the tail, but the sheathtail feature is joined by an elastic component which allows greater flexibility; they are able to use the hind legs for locomotion and to adjust the membrane's surface while in flight. As a common name indicates, many species also possess sac-shaped glands in their wings, which are open to the air and may release pheromones to attract mates. Other species have throat glands which produce strong-smelling secretions. They have the dental formula \n\nThese bats generally prefer to roost in better-illuminated areas than other species of bats. Their dwellings can often be found in hollow trees and entryways to caves or other structures. Some species, such as the genus \"Taphozous\", live in large colonies, but others are solitary. Species living away from the tropics may enter periods of torpor or extended hibernation during colder months.\n\nEmballonurids feed mainly on insects and occasionally on fruit. Most of these bats catch their meals while flying.\n\nThe common name for some groups, 'sheath-tailed bats', is sometimes noted as sheathtails.\n\nFamily Emballonuridae\n"}

In 1980 Durie suffered a major back injury which kept her out of the game for eight months. However, she made a successful return to the woman's tennis circuit in 1981, reaching the fourth round of the singles at Wimbledon and the US Open and climbing to her highest singles ranking so far of 31.\n\nHer most successful year as a singles player was 1983, ending the season at No. 6 in the world rankings and on the prize money leader board. As an unseeded player Durie reached the semifinals of the French Open, beating both Pam Shriver and Tracy Austin along the way. Later that year she made another Grand Slam singles semifinal appearance at the US Open, where she eventually lost to Chris Evert in straight sets. Her dramatic rise up the singles rankings that year ended with a quarterfinal at the Australian Open in December. Durie's success as a singles player during 1983 gained her a coveted place at the 1984 WTA Tour Championship as the fifth seed.\n\nHer most successful year at Wimbledon as a singles player came in 1984 when she reached the quarterfinals, beating a 15-year-old Steffi Graf in a memorable fourth-round match. It was just after Wimbledon that she reached a career-high singles ranking of world No. 5.\n\nShe won two top-level WTA singles titles (both in 1983) at Mahwah, New Jersey and Sydney, and had career wins over Steffi Graf, Zina Garrison, Pam Shriver, Hana Mandlíková, and Tracy Austin. Further back injuries in 1989 led to a remodeling of her service action. Durie made her last appearance in a WTA tour singles final at the Virginia Slims of Newport tournament in 1990.

In 1991 they became the first British doubles team ever to win the Australian Open mixed doubles title. As of 2013 both of these records still stand. As a team Bates and Durie reached an additional three mixed doubles quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 1986, 1990 and 1993. They also reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in 1992 as defending champions.\n\nDurie would go on to win five woman's doubles titles from eighteen finals during her career. Her most successful year as a doubles player, aside from the Grand Slams in 1987 and 1991 was in 1983, when she reached six finals, winning three titles. Durie also reached the semifinals of the women's doubles at the French Open and Wimbledon. By virtue of this success she gained a place at the 1984 WTA Tour Championship in doubles, and reached the final partnering Ann Kiyomura.\n\nDurie won the British National Doubles title a record nine times.\n\nDurie was a stalwart member of the British Wightman Cup (1979, 1981–89), British Federation Cup (1981–95) and British European Cup teams (1989–92).

Durie led the British team to victory in the European Championship in Prague in 1992.\n\nDurie retired from competitive tennis at the Wimbledon Championships in 1995, (her 18th appearance at the Championships), and marked it with a memorable performance. After three successive operations on her left knee, Durie went into the Championships ranked No. 326 in the world, yet reached the second round of the ladies' singles. She beat France's Alexia Dechaume-Balleret, ranked No. 85 in the world, in straight sets in the first round. Her second round, and last singles match at Wimbledon, was against Jana Novotná. After losing the match 2–6, 2–6, Jo Durie was given a full standing ovation by the crowd on the 'old' No. 1 Court. Her last match at Wimbledon was appropriately a mixed doubles match on Centre Court, where she played alongside her long-standing partner Jeremy Bates.\n\nShe is one of very few players to have a winning record against Steffi Graf and leads 4–3 in head-to-heads. Note, however, that all of her wins against Graf were before or during 1985, when Graf was typically a much lower-ranked player during the initial stages of her career.\n\nAfter retiring from the professional tour, Durie had heart surgery to rectify a problem for which she had originally been prescribed Beta blockers early in her career. She did not take the prescribed medication, as she didn't feel well after taking them. She revealed this fact in March 2016 in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, after the revelation that Maria Sharapova had been found taking a similar heart-issue drug, which later had been banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\nSince retirement, Durie has worked as a TV tennis commentator for both the BBC and British Eurosport. She used to coach British number one Elena Baltacha alongside her own former coach Alan Jones. She won back-to-back Wimbledon Ladies' Senior Invitation doubles titles in 1996 and 1997.\n\nDurie currently works as an academy coach at the FC** Academy in Middlesex.\n\n\n\n"}

She served only a single term, retiring at the 1935 state election.\n\nMillie Gertrude Holden was born in East Framlingham, Victoria, to Marianne (née Arnold) and John Bryson Holden, the second of two daughters born from the marriage.\n\nHer parents were both born in Ireland. Her father, originally from County Antrim, had arrived in Victoria in 1855, and became a successful land agent and auctioneer in Port Fairy. Her mother died when she was a few months old, and her father remarried Millie's maternal aunt Jane Ellen Arnold. Millie was given eight half-brothers and half-sisters from this union, and Jane was referred to as her mother throughout her life.\n\nHolden attended Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne. She was first introduced to politician Alexander Peacock in 1899, when her family hosted members of the Australian Natives' Association during a conference. They married on 1 January 1901, when she was 30 and he was 38.

{"id": "1995299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995299", "title": "Carrickmines Castle", "text": "Carrickmines Castle\n\nCarrickmines Castle is an archaeological site in Carrickmines, County Dublin, in eastern Ireland. The castle was built in the Middle Ages to protect the English-ruled Pale around Dublin. The mostly subsurface ruins lay in the path of the M50 Motorway, completed in 2005. Sections of the medieval walls and some sections of the castle's defensive structures were preserved within or under M50 roundabouts.\n\nCarrickmines Castle was the site of a Hiberno-Norse settlement which during the 12th century became a fortified Norman castle and village, on the frontier between Dublin and Wicklow, Ireland. Guarding the southern plains, this fortress was once a central medallion in the necklace of the Norman castles and outposts dotted along the outskirts of The Pale – the area around Dublin under English rule during the medieval period.\n\nIn 1402 the O'Byrne clan of County Wicklow, who periodically raided Dublin, moved a large mercenary force to the banks of the River Dargle at Bray, but, as the direct route to the city would bring them close to the stronghold of Carrickmines, they apparently hesitated before attacking. The delay allowed the Walsh family, who owned Carrickmines, to send an urgent warning to Dublin. The Dubliners responded decisively: the Mayor of Dublin with a large force fell on the O'Byrnes and defeated them, in an encounter popularly known as the Battle of Bloody Bank, due to the number of casualties.\n\nAs a major fortress, it had an extensive curtain wall flanked by towers protecting an area of some acres. Within this was settlement with a variety of wooden and stone buildings, mills, and a keep or hall house in the centre. The site still contains impressive defences, hewn into bedrock, and human remains from when the castle was overwhelmed in 1642.\n\nIn the Irish Rebellion of 1641, the Catholic Walshs who owned the Castle sided with the native Irish and the Confederate attempt to create the first independent Irish parliament. They paid dearly – as a focus of the Irish Confederate Wars, the Castle was besieged by English forces, and when it was retaken over 300 of the Walsh, O'Byrne, and O'Tooles were massacred..\n\nThe ruins of the castle were the subject of a long running dispute before the M50 motorway was built through the site of the castle. It began in 2002 when activists, including Vincent Salafia and Gordon Lucas, who called themselves the \"Carrickminders\" camped out on the castle's ruins to prevent them being removed to make way for the motorway. They were joined by preservationists, including Professor Sean Duffy, Head of the Department of History at Trinity College Dublin and Dr. Mark Clinton, who was the archaeologist employed by the National Roads Authority as Site Director. They argued that the site's potential for historical study had not been fully realised. They questioned why the line of the M50 rerouted through the castle in 1998 when the proposed new road was originally routed around it in 1983 on the advice of a state agency.\n\nIn 2005 both the M50 motorway and the junction were completed.\n\nThe Supreme Court, according to a report in \"The Irish Times\" on 26 July 2006, unanimously upheld the constitutionality of new laws affecting the preservation of the Carrickmines Castle site.\nWhile noting that the new legislation — Section 8 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 2004 — \"removes a bundle of protections\" from national monuments, the five-judge court found the Oireachtas is not prohibited under the Constitution of Ireland from enacting such laws.\n\nThe Court found that in issuing directions, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was entitled to balance the benefits of archaeological preservation against the wider public interest that would accrue as a result of the road development.\n\nSection 8 effectively provided that the works affecting the Carrickmines Castle site were to be carried out on the Minister's directions. Provided the Minister exercised his discretion under section 8 in a constitutional manner, he could give such directions as he thought fit, the Court found. This effectively meant that the road works at Carrickmines Castle were no longer to be regulated under the National Monuments Acts, the court said, although the castle was accepted as being a national monument and the works would mean a large part of a moat discovered at the site would cease to exist.\n\nUnder section 8, Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council, as landowner, did not need consent from any statutory body for undertaking the works and Oireachtas approval was not necessary. There was also no requirement to obtain a licence under the 1930 National Monuments Act and An Bord Pleanála was precluded from considering whether proposed works were likely to have a significant effect on the environment and from directing an environmental impact statement. There was \"only the requirement that the works be carried out on the directions of the minister\", the court said. It rejected claims that those directions – issued by the Minister, Dick Roche, in August 2004 – breached provisions of European Commission environmental directives and were therefore null and void.\n\nThe Supreme Court was delivering its judgement on an appeal against the High Court's rejection in September 2004 of a challenge by Dominic Dunne, both to section 8 and to the ministerial directions. Dunne indicated that he intended to take his case to the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe NRA proposed a solution which they said would preserve extensive areas of the unique historical remains while ensuring that the South Eastern Motorway proceeded on schedule.\n\nUnder the plan, additional sections of medieval walls and some sections of the castle's defensive structures were to be preserved within or under M50 roundabouts. However, An Taisce's demands to decrease the size of one of the roundabouts and adjust the approach roads were not addressed in the plan.\n\nMembers of the NRA and Dun Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council claimed that they had done as much as possible to preserve the castle. €6m was spent on excavations over two years and Archaeologists had retrieved more than 40,000 artefacts (including weapons, coins, human remains and pottery) when work resumed on the motorway.\n\nOn 26 July 2006, the Criminal Assets Bureau successfully obtained a High Court order freezing land assets of at Carrickmines, County Dublin, owned by Jackson Way Properties Ltd and preventing their sale. The CAB contended that these lands had been rezoned on 16 December 1997 by Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council from agricultural to industrial after Frank Dunlop bribed and made corrupt payments to councillors to secure their support in the rezoning vote. That vote increased the value of just of the property from €8 million to €61 million. The CAB interviewed and took statements from Frank Dunlop for use as a witness against a number of property developers.\n\nThe lands in question have been the subject of investigation by The Mahon Tribunal in 2003 and 2004.\n\n"}

The principal islands in this region are Sumbawa, Sumba, Flores, Timor, Buru, and Seram. The numerically most important languages are Nggahi Mbojo (Bimanese), Manggarai of western Flores, Uab Meto of West Timor, and Tetum, the national language of East Timor.\n\nIn the original proposal, CEMP is divided into \"Central Malayo-Polynesian\" (CMP) and \"Eastern Malayo-Polynesian\" (EMP). However, CMP is generally understood to be a cover term for the non-EMP languages within CEMP, which form a linkage at best rather than a valid clade.\n\nThe Central Malayo-Polynesian languages may form a linkage. They are for the most part poorly attested, but they do not appear to constitute a coherent group. Many of the proposed defining features of CMP are not found in the geographic extremes of the area. Therefore some linguists consider it a linkage; a conservative classification might consider CMP to be a convenient term for those Central–Eastern languages which are not Eastern Malayo-Polynesian (Grimes 1991).\n\nThe Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages extend from the coasts of Halmahera across the Pacific. This subgroup is still controversial as it is solely based on lexical evidence, with no shared phonological innovations. In contrast, the two individual branches, South Halmahera–West New Guinea and Oceanic, each are well-defined by phonological and lexical innovations, and universally accepted as valid subgroups.\n\nCEMP is rejected as a valid clade by Donohue & Grimes (2008), who do not consider CEMP to even be a linkage. Donohue & Grimes (2008) argue that many features found in CMP or CEMP languages are also found in more conservative Western Malayo-Polynesian languages and even Formosan languages.\n\nGiven the poor support for larger groupings, some of the groups listed here are provisional. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1995307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995307", "title": "Jazz chord", "text": "Jazz chord\n\nJazz chords refer to chords, chord voicings and chord symbols that jazz musicians commonly use in composition, improvisation, and harmony. In jazz chords and theory, most triads that appear in lead sheets or fake books can have sevenths added to them, using the performer's discretion and ear. For example, if a tune is in the key of C, if there is a G chord, the chord-playing performer usually voices this chord as G. While the notes of a G chord are G–B–D–F, jazz often omits the fifth of the chord—and even the root if playing in a group. However, not all jazz pianists leave out the root when they play voicings: Bud Powell, one of the best-known of the bebop pianists, and Horace Silver, whose quintet included many of jazz's biggest names from the 1950s to the 1970s, included the root note in their voicings.\n\nImprovising chord-playing musicians who omit the root and fifth are given the option to play other notes. For example, if a seventh chord, such as G, appears in a lead sheet or fake book, many chord-playing performers add the ninth, thirteenth or other notes to the chord, even though the lead sheet does not specify these additional notes. Jazz players can add these additional, upper notes because they can create an important part of the jazz sound. Lead sheets and fake books often do not detail how to voice the chord because a lead sheet or fake book is only intended to provide basic guide to the harmony. An experienced \"comping\" performer playing electric guitar or piano may add or remove notes as chosen according to the style and desired sound of that musician, but must do so in a way that still emphasizes the correct musical context for other musicians and listeners.\n\nIn voicing jazz chords while in a group setting, performers focus first on the seventh and the major or minor third of the chord, with the latter indicating the chord quality, along with added chord extensions (e.g., ninths, elevenths, or thirteenths, even if not indicated in the lead sheet or fake book) to add tone \"colour\" to the chord. As such, a jazz guitarist or jazz piano player might \"voice\" a printed G chord with the notes B–E–F–A, which would be the third, sixth (thirteenth), flat seventh, and ninth of the chord. Jazz chord-playing musicians may also add altered chord tones (e.g., 9, 9, 11, 13) and added tones. An example of an altered dominant chord in the key of C, built on a G would be to voice the chord as \"B–C–E–F–A\"; this would be G.\n\nEach chord is described as a series of intervallic relationships to the root of the chord. This provides an accurate and easily understandable basis for working out these chords in each key.\n\nThe terms used to describe intervals are as follows:\n\nAll root chords are described starting with the lowest note, and ascending in pitch. For instance, a chord described as\n\ncontains the root, a major third above the root, and a perfect fifth above the root. It is a major triad. If this chord were built on C (with C as the root), it would contain the notes\n\nCompound intervals are intervals larger than an octave. They can also be described as an octave plus a simple interval. Note that this is not a complete list of compound intervals, only those that are commonly used in jazz chords.\n\n\nOptional extensions to the chords are written in parentheses, e.g. (11). These notes are not necessary to define the function of the chord, but are included to add colour or fill out the sound according to the tastes of the performer. Extensions may be written into the chords when a specific colour or texture is warranted, or the chords in a lead sheet or fake book may simply state \"\". This does not mean that the chord-playing performer can only perform four-note dominant seventh chords. Chord-playing performers can use their ear, their sense of good taste acquired from listening to jazz, and their knowledge of the style of the tune being played (e.g., is it a bebop tune or a jazz fusion tune) to help guide her use of extension notes, altered extensions, and added tones. In a band, the bandleader might request that certain voicings be used (e.g., 9/11) or request that certain other voicings be avoided (e.g., 13), due to the bandleader's taste.\n\nChords are described here in terms of intervals relative to the root of the chord, arranged from smaller intervals to larger. This is a standard method used when describing jazz chords as it shows them hierarchically: Lower intervals (third, fifth and seventh) are more important in defining the function of the chord than the upper intervals or extensions (9th, 11th, 13th), which add color. Although it is possible to play the chords as described here literally, it is possible to use different orderings of the same notes, known as a voicings, or even by omitting certain notes.For instance, the dominant seventh 11 or Lydian dominant, C, comprises the notes:\n\nBasing this chord on the pitch, C, results in the pitches:\n\nThe same chord type may also be voiced:\n\nThis voicing omits both the root and the perfect fifth (G) and raises the major ninth (D) by an octave. The augmented eleventh (F) is also played twice in two different registers. This is known as \"doubling\".\n\nJazz improvisation is partly about selecting intervals within the chord or melody being played at a particular place in a song. While there are no right or wrong choices if notes are played in correct context, the graphic suggests how choices can be anything from boring through interesting to 'wrong' sounding, but judgments are strongly a matter of taste and experience and vary depending on the musician. Notes farther from the chord can often be inserted between other notes that are on the chord, such as E-Eb-Db-C over a C7 chord.\n\nThe above chords, despite their differences, share the same harmonic function and can be used interchangeably.\n\nA major seventh chord contains the notes:\n\nThe symbols and have the same meaning as maj or just . Often melody notes or other pitches influence an improviser's choice of chord types. For example, if the melody note is the root of the chord, including a major seventh can cause dissonance.\nA major sixth chord contains the notes:\n\nA 6/9 chord (C or C) contains the notes:\n\nA Lydian chord (C) contains the notes:\nThe Lydian chord has a strange quirk, where if you put the root both above and below the augmented eleventh it creates an unpleasant dissonance of a tritone. This is not usually a problem in a jazz context, as chord-playing musicians often omit the root.\n\nThe interval of the sixth is used, even though it is described after other compound intervals and perhaps should also be a compound interval (i.e., 13th). However, a convention in jazz dictates that when describing the major sixth, generally use the simple interval, i.e., 6 is often used instead of the compound interval, i.e., 13. This helps avoid confusion with the dominant thirteenth chord.\n\nThe term \"basic\" can be used to describe dominant chords based on the major scale. In many instances, dominant chords written as a basic chord (e.g., C) can substitute for a more complex chord, as long as it remains part of the same group (i.e., dominant chords) and does not clash with the melody note.\n\nDominant chords are considered to sound unstable in a classical music harmony context, and so in a classical piece, these chords often resolve down a perfect fifth or up a perfect fourth (e.g. C tends to resolve onto chords based on F, such as F major or F minor). However, in a jazz context, particularly in music from the 1940s bebop era and later decades, dominant chords were no longer treated as \"unstable\" chords. Some bebop tunes use a dominant chord as the tonic chord and also use dominant chords for the chords that would typically be minor chords in a Classical piece or a swing arrangement. For example, while a Classical piece and a swing arrangement might use the following chord sequence in the key of C major: \"\", a bebop bandleader might reharmonize the same progression as \"\", making a sequence of dominant seventh chords, so long as the new dominant chord harmonies were compatible with the tune's melody. For more details, see chord progression.\n\nMany of the chordal alterations used in jazz are derived from minor scale modes, as opposed to the major scale modes. (See musical mode). If the performer retains the 13th in the chord and/or avoids playing a 13th, it can be substituted for a C. Likewise a C can often be substituted for a Cmaj, as long as the 9th is retained or the 9th and 9th is avoided.\n\nA dominant seventh chord contains the notes:\n\nA dominant ninth chord (C) contains the notes:\n\nA dominant thirteenth chord (C) contains the notes:\n\nThis symbol is often used if the 13th is found in the melody.\n\nA sus, or suspended, chord (C) contains the notes:\n\nA minor seventh chord (C−, Cmin, Cmi, or Cm) contains the notes:\n\nA minor ninth chord (C−, Cmin, Cmi, or Cm) contains the notes:\n\nA minor eleventh chord (C−, Cmin, Cmi, or Cm) contains the notes:\n\nA minor thirteenth chord (C−, Cmin, Cmi, or Cm) contains the notes:\n\nThese chords can be voiced in a great variety of ways, including building the chord on the 7 (minor seventh). They usually, but not always, lead to a minor chord built on an interval a fourth up from the root. It is also not unusual to express either the 9 or 9 or the 5 in the melody. For expediency, musicians may use the abbreviation \"alt\"—as in C—to describe the family of dominant chords with altered tones (including the 5, 5, 9, 9, or 13). Coincidentally, all altered tones mentioned above are present in the melodic minor scale whose root is a half-step above the root of the alt chord (i.e., E melodic minor for D) In the previous dominant chords, it was noted that the perfect fifth is often omitted. When the fifth is augmented, the fifth is played by chord-playing musicians.\n\nA dominant 9/5 chord (C) contains the notes:\nA dominant 9/5 chord (C) contains the notes:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1995311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995311", "title": "Roebuck Bay", "text": "Roebuck Bay\n\nRoebuck Bay is a bay on the coast of the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Its entrance is bounded in the north by the town of Broome, and in the south by Bush Point and Sandy Point. It is named after , the ship captained by William Dampier when he explored the coast of north-western Australia in 1699. The Broome Bird Observatory lies on the northern coast of the bay.\n\nRoebuck Bay is a 550 km (210 mi) tropical, marine embayment. It has red sandy beaches and areas of mangroves, with the eastern edge of the bay being made up of linear tidal creeks. It is surrounded by grasslands and pindan woodland.\n\nThe northern shore of the bay is dominated by a long and low red cliff, 2–6 m in height, of pindan soil which gives the beaches there their distinctive red colouration. It overlies yellowish-red Broome Sandstone of Cretaceous age which, when exposed at the base of the cliff, shows occasional fossil footprints of dinosaurs.\n\nLandward of the mangrove-lined creeks along the eastern shore are bare flats that are only flooded on high spring tides, with the hypersaline soil inhibiting the establishment of vegetation, except for some areas of samphire.\n\nThe landward side is also known as Roebuck Plain with a pastoral lease of the name Roebuck Plains Station situated on the land.\n\nRoebuck Bay experiences a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen, \"Bsh\"). The wet season spans the austral summer, with most of the year's annual precipitation falling during this period, primarily in the form of severe tropical thunderstorms. The lengthier dry season occupies the remainder of the year, typically from May to November, when the temperatures are slightly cooler yet still very warm, and rainfall is extremely light and rare to nearly non-existent. Annual precipitation totals vary locally across the bay; they range from 300 to 550 mm a year. High temperatures during the oppressive austral summer months that frequently exceed 38 °C (100 °F), coupled with uncomfortably high humidity, contribute to often sweltering conditions from November to March, with the highest temperatures and most oppressive humidity typically experienced in February in and around the bay.\n\nThe bay has a very large tidal range which exposes around 160 km of mudflats, 45% of the total bay area, with the tide edge travelling at up to 20 cm per second. Most of the mudflats are inundated each high tide; spring tides or cyclones may also flood adjoining coastal flats. The tidal system is semi-diurnal with an average amplitude of 5.7 m, varying from 1 m on neap tides to 10.5 m on the highest spring tides. These tidal conditions dominate the intertidal ecology.\n\nRoebuck Bay lies in the traditional country of the Jukun and Yawuru Aboriginal peoples. The bay was important for seasonal meetings, exchanging gifts, arranging marriages and settling disputes. Many shellfish middens, marking former camping sites, are visible along the coastal cliffs and dunes. Indigenous people continue to make extensive use of the bay's natural resources by gathering shellfish, fishing and hunting.\n\nIn 1942 several Dutch flying boats arrived with refugees from the Dutch East Indies. While\nlaying at anchor in this bay they were attacked by Japanese Zero-fighter planes on 3 March 1942. The flying boats were\ndefenceless and they were repeatedly attacked and sprayed with bullets from machine-guns. A hundred\nmen, women and children were killed, many of them drowned; others were incinerated by the burning\nfuel on the surface of the water. The wrecks are still in situ, and several of them are visible a few days each year at extreme low tide.\n\nOn 7 June 1990 some 34,219 ha of the bay and its immediate surrounds were designated as a wetland of international importance, Ramsar Site 479, under the Ramsar Convention.\n\nEleven mangrove species are found in Roebuck Bay. The mangrove swamps that line the eastern and southern edges of the bay and extend into the tidal creeks are important nursery areas for marine fish and crustaceans, particularly prawns. Extensive seagrass beds across the bay are feeding grounds for Dugongs and Green Turtles. Other marine turtles and dolphins also regularly use the bay.\n\nThe intertidal mud and sand flats support high densities of benthic invertebrates, providing a key food source for waders or shorebirds. The site is one of the most important migration staging, and non-breeding, areas for waders in Australia and within the East Asian – Australasian Flyway. It is a principal spring arrival site in August–October for large proportions of the Australian populations of many species, and especially for the larger ones that travel non-stop from China to Australia. There is high turnover due to the birds moving onwards to south-western and south-eastern Australia, though large numbers remain through summer, and smaller numbers of non-breeding birds stay through winter. The area is also important for the northward movement of waders in autumn, with massed daytime departures taking place in March–April. The total number of waders using the bay each year is estimated to be over 300,000. The northern beaches of the bay, as well as Bush Point, provide important high tide roost sites.\n\nThe bay's wader feeding habitats and roosting sites have been identified by BirdLife International as a 928 km Important Bird Area (IBA). The IBA also encompasses the low-lying, occasionally inundated, coastal grasslands to the east of the bay on Roebuck Plains Station, including Lake Eda, where many waders roost during very high tides.\n\nThe bay regularly supports more than 1% of the population of at least 22 wader species: Greater sand plover, Lesser sand plover, Oriental plover, Red-capped plover, Grey plover, Bar-tailed godwit, Black-tailed godwit, Red knot, Great knot, Red-necked stint, Curlew sandpiper, Sanderling, Eastern curlew, Little curlew, Eurasian whimbrel, Common greenshank, Common redshank, Grey-tailed tattler, Terek sandpiper, Ruddy turnstone, Asian dowitcher, and Pied oystercatcher.\n\nBroome is a major tourist destination, and Roebuck Bay is used for recreational and tourism activities such as fishing, sightseeing and birdwatching. Broome Bird Observatory conducts shorebird research and public education.\n\nRoebuck bay can be accessed by boat from Broome Wharf, approximately 9 kilometres south of Broome Post Office and Broome International Airport.\n\nIn the 1890s, Roebuck Bay was the terminus of a proposed but stillborn land grant railway from Angle Pole across the border in the Northern Territory. This railway would have been about 1000 miles (1600 km) long.\n\nRoebuck Bay, with its sheltered waters, was the site chosen for the undersea telegraph cable from Asia to come ashore in 1871, to continue overland to Perth. This line is not to be confused with the Australian Overland Telegraph Line.\n\n\n"}

The son of Thomas and Edith Laprade, he was born in the New Ontario community of Mine Centre. By age 4, he and his family moved to Port Arthur, Ontario. He also spent time with the Port Arthur Bearcats of the Thunder Bay Senior Hockey League.\n\nLaprade started his hockey career with the local Port Arthur Bruins in the Thunder Bay Junior A Hockey League. He was a prolific scorer with the team and he was frequently their best player. In 1938-39, Laprade joined the Port Arthur Bearcats in the Thunder Bay Senior Hockey League (TBSHL). Again, Laprade scored many times, and he was selected as the MVP of the TBSHL in 1938-39 and 1940-41. He also helped the team win the Allan Cup in 1939-40.\n\nAfter the 1942-43 season, Laprade joined the army. While in the army, he still played hockey regularly with the Winnipeg Army. In 1944-45, he played one season with the Barriefield Bears before moving on to the National Hockey League with the New York Rangers. In his first season of NHL hockey, Laprade recorded 34 points in 49 games. His effort impressed the league and he was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy. Laprade finished the 1946-47 NHL season with 40 points, and earned a spot in the first NHL All-Star Game. He also played in the 1948, 1949, and 1950 NHL All-Star Games.\n\nDuring his career, Laprade played three full seasons without recording a penalty, and was awarded the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy in 1949-50. In the same season, the Rangers made it all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings, the closest Laprade ever came to winning a Stanley Cup. The series went all the way to a Game 7 before Pete Babando of the Detroit Red Wings scored the game-winning goal in overtime. After that, Laprade played five more seasons with the Rangers before retiring. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\nIn 1939, he married Arline Whear, his coach's niece. The couple had three daughters.\n\nAfter retiring from hockey, Laprade went into a partnership with Guy Perciante in operating a sporting goods store, Perciante & Laprade Sporting Goods Limited, in Thunder Bay, Ontario for 30 years. Perciante and Laprade also owned and managed an arena in Port Arthur.\n\nHe served as a member of Port Arthur and then Thunder Bay city council from 1959 to 1970 and again from 1972 to 1973. He also served on the board of governors for Confederation College and Lakehead University.\n\nLaprade died at home in Thunder Bay at the age of 94 on April 28, 2014.\n\n"}

Payne Whitney operated a horse farm and stable at Saratoga Springs, New York with his brother Harry Payne Whitney, who also had a large stable of horses. Greentree Stable had a training base at Aiken, South Carolina, while Greentree Farm in Lexington, Kentucky was established in 1925 as its breeding arm.\n\nAfter Whitney's steeplechase horse won the 1911 Greentree Cup race at Great Neck, New York, it was decided to use the Greentree name for several of their properties. Following Payne Whitney's death in 1927, his widow Helen Hay Whitney took over the operation. Her son, John Hay Whitney would also be involved in Thoroughbred racing especially so with his wife Liz Whitney. Daughter Joan Whitney Payson, raced horses under the \"Nom de course\" Manhasset Stable. On their mothers death, they continued to build on Greentree Stable's success.\n\nGreentree Stable horses won many important steeplechase and flat races throughout the United States. As part of a program honoring important Thoroughbred tracks and racing stables, the Pennsylvania Railroad named its baggage car #5859 the \"Greentree Stable\". In January 1928 Thomas W. Murphy, a renowned harness racing trainer, became head trainer for Greentree Stable. Murphy stayed until the end of the 1930 Pimlico fall meeting, and was replaced by James G. Rowe, Jr..\n\nTrained by Rowe, the Whitney stable's colt Twenty Grand earned the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year in 1931 and would be inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York in 1957. Hall of Fame trainer John M. Gaver, Sr., who won the Belmont Stakes for the stable three times, trained Devil Diver, Champion Handicap Horse in 1943–1944 and the 1953 Horse of the Year Tom Fool. Both horses were also voted into the Hall of Fame: Devil Diver in 1980 and Tom Fool in 1960. Helen Whitney's steeplechasers won the American Grand National four times (1926–1928 and 1937). Her horse Jolly Roger (who won the Grand National twice) was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1965. Greentree Stable also had polo ponies and steeplechasers, one of which won the 1946 American Grand National. Other steeplechasers raced in England and Ireland.\n\nWith the passing of John and Joan Whitney, in 1989 their heirs sold the Kentucky property to its current owners, Gainesway Farm. The equestrian estate in Saratoga Springs was offered for sale in 2005.\n\n"}

He started his ice hockey career playing for the Pembroke Lumber Kings and the Berlin Dutchmen. In 1911, Lehman joined the New Westminster Royals, playing for the Royals for three seasons, before joining the Vancouver Millionaires in 1914. Lehman played half of his 22-year professional career with Vancouver, winning his only Stanley Cup; he would be unsuccessful in seven other attempts. In 1926, he joined the Chicago Black Hawks of the National Hockey League (NHL), playing a full season and splitting the second one as player and head coach. Although some ice hockey historians credit Jacques Plante for originating the practice, Lehman was the first goaltender to regularly pass the puck to his fellow forwards and defensemen; he even scored a goal by shooting the puck in the opponent's net while playing for the Professionals. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958.\n\nLehman began his playing career in 1903–04, playing for the Pembroke Lumber Kings of the Ottawa Valley Hockey League (OVHL) for the first three seasons of his career. In the 1906–07 season, Lehman was signed as a free agent by the Canadian Soo of the International Professional Hockey League (IPHL); the IPHL was the first fully professional ice hockey league. Lehman returned to Pembroke for the 1907–08 season, appearing in four games. For the 1908–09 season, Lehman joined the Berlin Dutchmen of the Ontario Professional Hockey League (OPHL). In the 1909–10 season, Lehman was in two different Stanley Cup playoff series, with two different teams, the Berlin Dutchmen and the Galt Professionals, but he lost both times. During those playoff series, he appeared in three games, giving up 22 goals. Lehman played with the Berlin Dutchmen until 1911.\n\nIn 1911–12, Lehman played for the New Westminster Royals of the newly founded Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). He played three seasons for New Westminster, winning the league championship in his first season. In 1914–15, Lehman joined the Vancouver Millionaires of the PCHA. In his first season with the Millionaires, Lehman posted a 14–3 record, with a 4.08 goals-against average, which was a very good average in an era when goaltenders were not allowed to drop on their knees to make a save. In the Stanley Cup playoffs, Lehman helped the Millionaires become the first PCHA team to win the Stanley Cup, with a 3–0 record and 2.67 goals against average. This would be the only Stanley Cup victory of Lehman's career, as he was on the losing side in seven other attempts. The Millionaires squad consisted of seven future members of the Hockey Hall of Fame when they won the Cup: Lehman, Frank Nighbor, Cyclone Taylor, Si Griffis, Barney Stanley, Frank Patrick, and Mickey MacKay.\n\nLehman played with the Millionaires until the 1925–26 season. During that time, Lehman and some of his teammates were involved in a humorous incident when going back to Canada after an exhibition game against the Montreal Wanderers in New York City. In New York, Lehman's wife bought numerous women's designer outfits, after being treated to a shopping spree by him. When going back to Canada, Lehman, on the advice of Cyclone Taylor, who was both a professional ice hockey player and a Canadian immigration officer, split up all outfits among his teammates to avoid paying additional taxes he would have had to pay if he had brought all the clothing by himself at once; this puzzled the Customs officers. In 1922–23, the Millionaires were renamed the Maroons, and joined the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). The WCHL was renamed to the Western Hockey League in 1925–26; however, the league disbanded at the conclusion of that season. While playing for the Millionaires, Lehman appeared in six Stanley Cup finals, losing every time, except in his first season, in 1914–15.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the WHL, Lehman joined the Chicago Black Hawks for the 1926–27 season. While in Chicago, Lehman mentored future Chicago goaltender and captain Charlie Gardiner. Lehman played one full season, and another four games the next one. During the 1926 season, Lehman became the oldest goaltender to win his first NHL game at 41 years 21 days. This record was broken on February 22 2020 by David Ayres who at 42 years, 194 days came into a game as an emergency backup goaltender for the Carolina Hurricanes against the Toronto Maple Leafs at Scotiabank Arena in the 2nd period and won the game 6-3.\n\nDuring the 1927–28 season, Black Hawks owner and manager Frederic McLaughlin was sketching some plays for his team; after Lehman was shown the plays by McLaughlin, Lehman responded by calling it \"the craziest bunch of junk [he's] ever seen\". Expecting to be fired after that outburst, Lehman was later told to go to McLaughlin's office. It was how Lehman's playing career ended: McLaughlin appointed Lehman to be Chicago's new head coach. Lehman coached Chicago for part of one season, finishing with a 3–17–1 record over 21 games. He was replaced by Herb Gardiner the following season.\n\nAs a goaltender, Lehman was a strong skater and good puckhandler. He chased down loose pucks, and was able to pass the puck to his forwards, surprising the other team's defenders. Playing in the OPHL, Lehman scored a goal by shooting the puck in the opponent's net. The first NHL goaltender to duplicate such a feat was Ron Hextall, who did it in 1987.\n\nAfter retiring from ice hockey, Lehman worked in the road construction business, eventually becoming the president of a paving company. Lehman was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958.\n"}

About 2,000 species have been described worldwide, including Ochthera.\n\nThe petroleum fly, \"Helaeomyia petrolei\", is the only known insect whose larvae live in naturally occurring crude petroleum. Another notable species is \"Ephydra hians\" which lives in vast number at Mono Lake.\n\nFor terms, see Morphology of Diptera.\n\nThe flies are minute to small (0.9 to 7.0 mm), with black or gray colorations. Wings are sometimes patterned. Costa with two interruptions are present in first section, near the humeral cross-vein and again near the end of vein 1. The second basal cell is not separated from the discal cell. Arista are bare or with hairs on the upper side (plumose on the upper side). The mouth opening is very large in some species. The ratio of vertical diameter of eye and height of gena (face index) is widely used in identification of individual species.\nSee also family description and images.\n\nIn the tribe Notiphilini the head is reduced to a cephalic skeleton, there are no anterior spiracles and the posterior spiracles are extended as spines. \nThe other taxa have larvae similar to the Sciomyzidae, with the posterior spiracles at the apices of divergent branches from a common base. They may be differentiated by short thoracic segments (like the abdominal ones) and by the absence of a ventral arch linking the mouth hooks.\n\n\nEphydridae occupy a diverse array of seashore and wetland habitats including hot springs, petroleum pools, salt pools, alkaline lakes, marshes. Imago are phytophagous, sometimes feeding on microscopic algae and bacteria (\"Paracoenia\", \"Ephydra\"), or predatory (\"Ochthera\", Ephydrinae). As larvae, many are phytophagous, grazing on aquatic plants (including cultivated rice), others are algal grazers or saprophagous. Larvae of \"Trimerina\" are predatory. Some species are an important food source for other animals. Others cause damage to agricultural crops.\n\nLarvae of some Ephydridae live in very unusual habitats. For example, \"Ephydra brucei\" lives in hot springs and geysers where the water temperature exceeds 45 degrees Celsius; some \"Scatella\" live in hot sulphur springs; \"Helaeomyia petrolei\" develops in pools of crude oil; and \"Ephydra cinerea\", the brine fly proper, in pools with very high concentrations of salt. Some have public health significance being associated with sewage filter beds and septic tanks. Flies develop in moist soils or mine leaves of aquatic, subaquatic, and rarely dry soil (\"Hydrellia\") plants. Flies are found near water along coasts, among aquatic vegetation and sometimes on water surfaces (\"Ephydra\").\n\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Smiths Falls Seniors for three years, with whom his performance in a 1906 Stanley Cup challenge series attracted the attention of his opponents, the Ottawa Silver Seven. Although his team lost the series, LeSueur excelled in goal, keeping the games close. Nine days after the defeat, he joined the Silver Seven and played in a challenge match against the Montreal Wanderers. He remained with Ottawa through the 1913–14 season where he served as team captain for three seasons, and assumed coaching duties in his final season with the team.\n\nLeSueur was traded to the Toronto Ontarios (who later changed their name to the Toronto Shamrocks mid-season) for the 1914–15 season. After playing the following season for the Toronto Blueshirts, he enlisted in the army and fought for Canada during the First World War. He returned to hockey following the conclusion of the war, serving in various roles including referee, coach, manager, arena manager, and hockey journalist. He coached ten games in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Hamilton Tigers. As a journalist, he was the first reporter to include shots on goal statistics in game summaries.\n\nDuring his playing career, LeSueur improved upon existing ice hockey equipment: he invented the gauntlet-style goaltender glove which protected the forearms, and created and patented the LeSueur net which was designed to catch high-rising shots. LeSueur was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961, and died a few months later following a lengthy illness.\n\nBorn in Quebec City, Quebec, LeSueur played amateur hockey in his hometown with several teams on the right wing. He scored a regular season goal with the Quebec Hockey Club (AKA Bulldogs) in 1901. For the 1903–04 season, he moved to Smiths Falls, Ontario, to play for the Seniors. When the team's usual goaltender fell ill, LeSueur agreed to play goal.\n\nIn March 1906, the Seniors issued a challenge for the Stanley Cup to the Ottawa Silver Seven. (During that era, teams were allowed to challenge the present Cup holder once a year for possession, provided they were part of a senior hockey association and had won their league championship.) In the two-game, total goals series, Smiths Falls lost the first game 6–5, and the second game 8–2. Both games were played at Dey's Arena in Ottawa, on March 6 and 8. Despite giving up 14 goals during the series, LeSueur's work in net was impressive: the \"Montreal Star\" remarked that his performance in the first game had kept the Seniors in contention, noting that the \"most spectacular saves of the match were made by [him]\".\n\nFollowing his team's loss in the challenge match, LeSueur, a bank clerk, moved 60 kilometres northeast along the rail line to Ottawa. (During his playing years, it was customary for players to have an occupation outside of hockey.) Impressed by his performance, the Silver Seven asked him to join their team. Ottawa had lost confidence in its previous goalkeeper, Billy Hague, following a 9–1 defeat at the hands of the Montreal Wanderers in the first game of their two-game, total-goals Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) playoff series for control of the Stanley Cup. The Silver Seven called the timing of LeSueur's arrival a coincidence, but with an eight-goal lead in the series, the Wanderers did not protest LeSueur's eligibility.\n\nIn the second game, played on March 17, LeSueur surrendered an early goal to Moose Johnson but subsequently held the Wanderers scoreless while the Silver Seven scored nine straight goals to bring the two teams even. Harry Smith appeared to put Ottawa ahead 11–10, but what would have been his seventh goal of the game was disallowed by an offside call. The Wanderers responded with a \"furious attack\", resulting in Lester Patrick scoring two late goals, leading Montreal to a 12–10 series victory and the Stanley Cup. LeSueur was the first goaltender, and one of only two (with Hugh Lehman, 1909–10) to play for two different teams in Stanley Cup challenges in the same season.\n\nLeSueur played for Ottawa through the 1913–14 season. In 1908, he was the team's sole representative at the Hod Stuart Benefit All-Star Game, played on January 2. Stuart, a member of the Wanderers squad who won the Stanley Cup in 1907, had drowned in the previous off-season and the ECAHA responded by organizing an All-Star game, the first of its kind in any sport, with its proceeds going to Stuart's widow and their two children. The Wanderers defeated a team of All-Stars, made up of the top players of the league's other teams, 10–7. LeSueur remarked in the \"Ottawa Free Press\" that while joining the Silver Seven was his \"biggest thrill\", his participation in the All-Star Game came a \"close second\".\n\nIn the 1909 ECHA season, LeSueur won the Stanley Cup with the Ottawa, now nicknamed the Senators, after the team led the league with 10 wins. During the same season, he wrote a 48-page booklet entitled \"How to Play Hockey\", a work similar to Arthur Farrell's handbook \"\", the first book published on ice hockey, 10 years earlier. LeSueur's book was particularly popular among youngsters.\n\nLeSueur was named captain of the Senators for the 1910–11 season. The team led the regular season standings in the National Hockey Association (NHA) with 13 wins, regaining possession of the Stanley Cup. LeSueur was the league leader in goaltender wins in both the 1909 and 1910–11 seasons, having appeared in every game Ottawa played. During 1913–14, his last season with the Senators, LeSueur served as both the coach and captain of the team.\n\nLeSueur was traded to the Toronto Shamrocks for Fred Lake and $300, as the Ottawa club engaged Clint Benedict for its goaltender's job. At the time of the deal, LeSueur had been the last member of either the 1909 or 1911 Stanley Cup winning teams still in Ottawa. Coincidentally, LeSueur's last season with Ottawa also marked the end of the Stanley Cup challenge era. In Stanley Cup play, LeSueur had a 7–2 overall record and was undefeated in seven games with Ottawa.\n\nAfter one season with the Shamrocks in 1914–15, LeSueur finished his playing career with the cross-town rival Toronto Blueshirts in 1915–16. He had a losing record with both Toronto clubs. LeSueur initially became a full-time practicing accountant after retiring as a player, but enlisted with the 48th Highlanders, who served as the 134th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force in the First World War.\n\nFollowing the war, LeSueur returned to hockey in a variety of roles. Over time, he appeared as a referee, coach, manager, arena manager, and journalist. His first job was as a referee in the National Hockey League (NHL). Afterwards, he coached in the minor leagues and the NHL. In 1921, he was behind the bench when the Galt, Ontario intermediate team won the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) championship. He was appointed the Hamilton Tigers' head coach for the 1923–24 NHL season, but coached only the first 10 games of the 24-game schedule. When LeSueur was fired, the team had a 3–7 record, and finished the season last in the standings with an overall record of 9–15.\n\nLeSueur went on to manage several arenas and guided the creation of new teams. As manager of the Windsor Arena and the Detroit Olympia, he helped assemble an ownership group that acquired the Victoria Cougars from the Western Hockey League (WHL) prior to the 1926–27 season. The team joined the NHL as the Detroit Cougars, now known as the Red Wings. In the 1928–29, he managed the Peace Bridge Arena in Fort Erie, Ontario. He guided the Buffalo Bisons' entry as an inaugural member of the International Hockey League (IHL) when it split from the Canadian Professional Hockey League (CPHL), and served as the team's coach. LeSueur joined the Syracuse Stars of the IHL as head coach for the 1930–31 season, but was replaced mid-season by Frank Foyston. LeSueur also managed the Syracuse Arena. While he was an IHL coach, he used his spare players during game intermissions to explain the rules of hockey to new spectators.\n\nFollowing his coaching and managing career, LeSueur turned to journalism. He was a columnist for \"The Hamilton Spectator\", and was the first reporter to list shots on goal in game summaries. In addition to writing, he was a radio broadcaster. He used this role to help sell the game in regions without an ice hockey tradition. LeSueur was an original member of \"Hockey Night in Canada\"'s \"Hot Stove League\", a panel of hockey writers which discussed issues within hockey.\n\nHe was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961 as a player. In 1968, he was posthumously inducted as one of the 55 original members of the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nDuring LeSueur's career, ice hockey rules forbade goalkeepers from lying, sitting, kneeling, or otherwise falling onto the ice to make a save. Forced to play a stand-up style, LeSueur was aggressive in goal and was sufficiently athletic to be able to stop two or three shots in quick succession. Hockey historian Bill Fitsell noted that he had an \"intense roving style\", playing the puck outside of his crease in a style popularized forty years later by Jacques Plante. His playing style was exemplified in a game against the Quebec Bulldogs, where LeSueur was reported to have sprinted towards and \"floored\" an opposing forward who was on a breakaway.\n\nDescribed as a \"thinking man's custodian\", LeSueur is credited with two major innovations to ice hockey equipment. Around 1909, he experimented with using a baseball catcher's glove with extra padding to catch the puck. LeSueur later developed gauntlet-style gloves to protect the goaltender's forearms. He also designed the patented LeSueur net which was used from 1911 to 1925, first by the NHA and then its successor, the NHL. The net was designed to trap rising shots, with the rear frame 22 inches behind the goal mouth at the bottom of the net but only 17 inches at the top. Art Ross later improved on LeSueur's design, and his eponymous net was used by the NHL from 1927 to 1984.\n\nLeSueur died on January 27, 1962, following a lengthy illness, a few months after his induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame. In a Canadian Press obituary, fellow Hall of Famer Newsy Lalonde described him as \"one the best goalies he ever faced\", and Cyclone Taylor, a teammate on the 1909 Stanley Cup-winning Senators team, stated that LeSueur would always be in goal whenever \"he was asked to pick an All-Star team\".\n\nPercy, a Presbyterian, was married to Georgia LeSueur. One of his children, Steve Douglas, followed his father into radio broadcasting: at the time of his father's death, Douglas was a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) sports commentator.\n\n\n"}

He was first president of the Croatian Party of Rights, after party was reestablished in 1991. In 1993 he founded the Croatian Party of Rights 1861 following a political split from Anto Đapić.\n\nIn his early days Paraga advocated the secession of Croatia from Yugoslavia which led to persecution by the Communist authorities. \n\nWhen a multi-party system was established in Croatia, he initially joined the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) of Franjo Tuđman. However, involvement with the party clearly indicated that there was variation in sentiment among its members. \nParaga came to feel the HDZ was not the radical party which he had expected, and so the party split. He and a delegation of like-minded radicals formed the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP). His party formed its own militia, the Croatian Defence Forces (; \"HOS\"). In an interview in 2000,\n\nParaga stated his party was “for a Croatia to the Drina, and for a Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Adriatic”. Paraga and the HSP had had hopes of becoming the major political factor before the 1992 presidential and parliamentary elections, but those hopes did not materialise. The HSP did enter the Croatian Parliament and Paraga came fourth among presidential candidates, but it was clear that the party was far from its target. Another blow came in the form of high treason charges against Paraga and his associate Anto Đapić, who were stripped of their parliamentary immunity. Those charges were ultimately dropped, but the most serious blow for Paraga came when Đapić turned against him and took over the leadership of the HSP at the 1993 party convention in Kutina. \nParaga accused Đapić of being in cahoots with Tuđman and tried to retrieve party leadership in court.\n\nFollowing the failure of the effort and second split with fellow party members, in 1995 Paraga founded a party called Croatian Party of Rights 1861, claiming to be the true descendant of the 19th century party in Austria-Hungary.\n\n"}

It was fought in 317 BC.\n\nAfter the death of Alexander the Great, his generals immediately began squabbling over his huge empire. Soon it degenerated into open warfare, with each general attempting to claim a portion of Alexander's vast kingdom. One of the most talented successor generals (Diadochi) was Antigonus Monophthalmus, so called because of an eye he lost in a siege. During the early years of warfare between the Diadochi, he faced Eumenes, a capable general who had already crushed the popular general Craterus. The two Diadochi fought a series of battles across Asia Minor in which Antigonos completely outgeneraled Eumenes. Eumenes retreated to, and was besieged in, the fortress of Nora. Eventually, after swearing an oath, Eumenes was released. Unfortunately for Antigonos Eumenes had revised the original oath in a way he was still able to continue the war without being labeled an oathbreaker. Eumenes recruited a small army and marched south into Cilicia where he made an alliance with Antigenes and Teutamos (commanders of the Silver Shields and the Hypaspists, Alexander's veterans). In Cilicia, Syria and Phoenicia Eumenes recruited additional troops for his army and ships for his fleet and renewed the war against Antigonos. Antigonos, having taken care of his enemies in the West, now marched East after Eumenes. When he arrived in Cilicia he found out Eumenes had marched to Mesopotamia trying to get the eastern Satraps to join his cause. After securing Cilicia and Syria he marched to Mesopotamia intent upon bringing Eumenes to battle. Eumenes avoided battle and the armies marched and countermarched through Babylonia, Susiana and Media until finally, in the summer of 316 BC, they faced off across a plain in the lands of the Paraitakenoi, to the northeast of Susa.\n\nIn the summer of 316 BC, Antigonus moved southward from Media towards Persia in the hope of forcing Eumenes to battle. Eumenes was moving north from Persia. The two armies met in the region called Paraitakene, between Media and Persia. Antigonus drew up his army in a strong defensive position. The two armies surveyed each other for a while, and for four days they lived off the land. On the fifth day, supplies were running low so Antigonus decided to march away to Gabiene, where the countryside was rich and unplundered. Unfortunately his plans were betrayed by some deserters, and Eumenes was able to march off first. When Antigonus found out his opponent had left he gave chase with his cavalry while the rest of his army followed at moderate speed. In this way he caught up with Eumenes's rearguard and forced him to halt his army. When the rest of Antigonus's army came up both sides prepared for battle.\n\nAntigonus deployed his army obliquely, the right wing leading, in the same fashion used by Alexander and Philip. Antigonus deployed his light horse (c. 7,000 horsemen) on the left under Peithon, his heavy cavalry (3,700 horsemen) and light infantry were placed on the right flank resting on the hills under his own command and his phalanx held the center, with the Macedonians on the right, the Asians in the center and the mercenaries (probably Greeks) on the left, while the war elephants were spread across the line. Eumenes, also placed his phalanx in the center, with the elite Argyraspides and Hypaspists on the right of the phalanx. His left flank, resting near the hill, was made up of cavalry, elephants, and auxiliaries. The right flank was led by Eumenes himself with his heavy cavalry (2,900 horsemen). Antigonus's oldest son Demetrius, aged about twenty, was with his father on the right for his first major battle.\n\nThe battle began with Pheiton, ignoring his orders to hang back, charging Eumenes's heavy cavalry with his more numerous light cavalry. Eumenes held his own against Pheiton with his heavy cavalry and elephants and then attacked him in the flank with a couple of his own light cavalry squadrons brought over from his left flank. Peithon was driven back to the foothills in rout.\n\nIn the center, the two phalanxes engaged, again to Eumenes’ advantage due to the incredible skill of the Argyraspides who, despite their age (50 to 70 years old), seemed invincible. Antigonus's phalanx was also driven back to the foothills. \n\nDespite these reverses, Antigonos kept his head and when he observed that the very success of the enemy phalanx had led them forward opening up a gap between their center and their left flank he charged his heavy cavalry into this gap, wheeling right and left to the rear of Eumenes's cavalry and his phalanx. The attack proved successful – ending what seemed to be the start of a Eumenes victory over another opponent. The battle slowed as both sides tried to rally broken units. Eumenes tried to claim victory by occupying the battlefield but his troops insisted on returning to their baggage and making camp there. Antigonos, who had his troops better in hand, marched forward and claimed the battlefield.\n\nAntigonus claimed victory, even though he lost some 3,700 men, and a further 4,000 were wounded. Eumenes came off with a loss of only 540 men and some 1,000 injured. Antigonos used trickery (force marching his army away by night) to get away from Eumenes, but he would be back the following year. Their next major confrontation would be the Battle of Gabiene.\n\n"}
{"id": "1995393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995393", "title": "Imus in the Morning", "text": "Imus in the Morning\n\nImus in the Morning was a long-running radio show hosted by Don Imus. The show originated on June 2, 1968, on various stations in the Western United States before settling on WNBC radio in New York City in 1971. In October 1988, the show moved to WFAN when that station took over WNBC's dial position following an ownership change. It was later syndicated to 60 other stations across the country by Westwood One, a division of CBS Radio, airing weekdays from 5:30 to 10 am Eastern time. Beginning September 3, 1996, the 6 to 9 am portion was simulcast on the cable television network MSNBC.\n\nThe show had been broadcast almost every weekday morning for 36 years on radio and 11 years on MSNBC until it was canceled on April 12, 2007, due to controversial comments made on the April 4, 2007 broadcast. \"Imus in the Morning\" program returned to the morning drive on New York radio station WABC on December 3, 2007. WABC is the flagship station of ABC Radio Networks (which itself was eventually subsumed into Westwood One in 2012), which syndicates the show nationally. From 2007 to August 2009, the show was simulcast on television nationwide on RFD-TV and rebroadcast each evening on RFD HD in high-definition. After Imus and RFD reached a mutual agreement to prematurely terminate the five-year deal, Fox Business Network began simulcasting the program on October 5, 2009, an arrangement which ended on May 29, 2015.\n\nIn March 2018, Cumulus Media, in the middle of a bankruptcy process, told Imus they were going to stop paying him, and as a result, Imus ended the show. The final broadcast of \"Imus in the Morning\" was March 29, 2018.\n\nFollowing a successful run as an on-air personality in Cleveland, Don Imus was hired by WNBC to host \"Imus in the Morning\" in late 1971. Imus is credited with introducing New York, and the larger Top 40 radio community, to the shock jock style of hosting. His initial run in New York ended in August 1977, when NBC management ordered a purge of WNBC's on-air staff in order to revive sagging ratings. Imus returned to Cleveland, but NBC brought him back to New York only two years later. On September 3, 1979, Imus started off his first program back on WNBC with his old character/voice/bit, \"The Reverend Billy Sol Hargis\". The show regularly parodied songs and voices, satirizing national and local events and persons.\n\nAfter WNBC was sold to Emmis Communications in 1988, a frequency shift on New York's AM radio dial saw WFAN, Emmis's sports-talk station, move to WNBC's 660 AM dial position. WNBC signed off in October 1988, and WFAN decided to retain Imus, replacing its original morning drive-time show hosted by Greg Gumbel. Initially limited to the broadcast range of WFAN in the New York metropolitan area, the show's radio audience and influence expanded considerably once Westwood One began syndicating it in 1993. \n\nDuring the WNBC years, \"Imus in the Morning\" was conducted out of NBC's radio studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The program then moved to the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens, WFAN's longtime studio home. In 2005, the program moved to a dedicated \"Imus in the Morning\" set at MSNBC's studios in Secaucus, New Jersey, although certain cast members remained at the WFAN studios using a split-screen format. When at the Imus Ranch, Don Imus would broadcast the show from Ribera, New Mexico, while the rest of the cast remained in New York and New Jersey. \n\nFor the first 15 months of Imus' simulcast on RFD, the show originated from a custom set created for RFD located in the Cablevision Rainbow studios in midtown Manhattan's Penn Plaza. In April 2009, the show moved to the multipurpose WABC radio studios; Imus cited the high cost of the Cablevision studios as being the reason for the move. In September 2009, the show moved to Fox Business Network's television studios in Rockefeller Center, where Fox Business began simulcasting the program on October 5, 2009. The Fox Business simulcast ended May 29, 2015. On June 15, 2015, the show started broadcasting solely on the radio from the WABC radio studios.\n\nOriginally considered a shock jock, Imus turned his show more towards politics and news and gained public influence as a result. During the 1990s, \"Imus in the Morning\" became increasingly important as a useful, non-traditional platform for politicians to express their views and gain exposure. Former U.S. Sen. Al D'Amato (R-N.Y.) was one of the first officeholders to ingratiate himself with \"The I-man\", as Imus was frequently called by cast and guests. The show's many guests included prominent politicians such as Bill Clinton (during his 1992 presidential campaign), Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mitt Romney, John McCain, John Kerry, Vice President Dick Cheney, J.D. Hayworth and Harold Ford, Jr., as well as reporters and columnists from \"Newsweek\", NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, CNN, Fox News and other media outlets. Among the cream of the press who regularly appeared on the show were Tom Brokaw, Tim Russert, Dan Rather, Brian Williams, Andrea Mitchell, Cokie Roberts, Sam Donaldson, Howard Fineman, Mike Barnicle, Frank Rich, Jonathan Alter and Jeff Greenfield.\n\nIn 1996 as MSNBC was being launched, the original plan for weekday morning programming was to rerun the previous night's prime-time shows. However, NBC Executive Producer of Special Events and Breaking News David Bohrman suggested to NBC president Andy Lack that putting the newsmaking Imus program on the new cable channel was the right thing to do. Bohrman contacted Imus, and over the course of several visits and business conversations a deal was struck so that the radio program would be simulcast on MSNBC. Cameras were installed in the WFAN radio studio, and remotely controlled from MSNBC headquarters in New Jersey. One of the unique features of the first few years of the program was that the television version's commercials and the radio commercials happened at different times, which allowed TV viewers a voyeuristic view of Imus and his team getting ready for the next segments. The program was a huge success on cable news for quite a while. Bohrman (who Imus referred to as \"Moosebutt\") produced the first few dozen programs, then hired Terry Irving to become the day-to-day Executive Producer of the television version of the program.\nIn 1997, Imus was named as one of \"Time\" magazine's \"25 most influential people in America\"; he was also on the cover of \"Newsweek\" in 1999.\n\nIn 2005, \"Imus in the Morning\" was carried by about 90 radio stations across the United States, although at the time of its 2007 CBS Radio/MSNBC cancellation it was carried by 61 stations. Arbitron analysis put the program among the most listened to radio talk shows in the United States, with about 1.6 million radio listeners per week.\n\nIn an April 26, 2005 article, David Kiley wrote in \"Business Week\" magazine that \"Imus in the Morning\" commanded higher advertising rates compared to competing talk shows with larger audiences, because the Imus show was less politically partisan and its demographics were \"affluent, educated and influential men\". Kiley also quoted former \"CBS News\" anchor and \"Face the Nation\" moderator Bob Schieffer as saying, \"I don’t know anyone in Washington who doesn’t listen to Imus or watch him on TV. I get more feedback off my spots on Imus than from my own shows.\" (This included the former Howard Stern terrestrial radio broadcast. In comparison, Stern attracted more than 8.25 million listeners on half as many stations and Rush Limbaugh attracts 13.5 million listeners).\n\nAt the time of its 2007 MSNBC cancellation, \"Imus in the Morning\" averaged 361,000 viewers in the first quarter of 2007 and was up 39 percent over the previous year, ranking third among cable morning news programs in the Nielsen ratings, compared to 769,000 viewers of \"Fox and Friends\" on Fox News Channel and 372,000 viewers of CNN's \"American Morning\". The program was reported to generate $20 million in annual revenue for WFAN, representing approximately 25 percent of the New York anchor station's revenue. Total revenue, including affiliate advertising and MSNBC, was said to be $50 million. MSNBC is said to have paid CBS $4 million annually in simulcast fees and to have averaged $500,000 per year in production expenses.\n\nImus generally selects country and western songs as bumper music and he often promotes artists he likes such as Delbert McClinton, Lucinda Williams, Levon Helm, Little Sammy Davis, The Flatlanders as well as his de facto theme song from Kinky Friedman, \"They Ain't Making Jews Like Jesus Anymore\". Rock music, blues, oldies, and the occasional jazz piece is also used as bumper music. Imus is known for playing bumper music at a length that is unusual for talk radio.\n\n\"Imus in the Morning\" had a regular cast of members who supplied news and comedy, and acted as foils to Imus. Part of the appeal of his show was the overt display of office politics: cast members were frequently the object of Imus' sarcasm, largely because of their outspoken points of view. The idea of including production staff as an on-air cast of characters was the idea of Fred Imus, Don's younger brother, who briefly served as the show's producer and was a regular guest on the show until his death in August 2011.\n\nFrom the 1970s until his retirement on May 6, 2011, Charles McCord served as the program's newsman and head writer. In character, he usually acted as either the straight man or, occasionally, as an Imus sycophant or antagonist. McCord affected a neutral, reasoned tone and thus usually stayed out of Imus' line of fire, compared to the antics of the other cast members. He was responsible for developing the lines of questioning Imus would ask his guests, in addition to his anchor duties. Connell McShane took over the newsman position on May 9 and continued in the role until December 14, 2017.\n\nBernard McGuirk, his producer, was the show's antagonist, whom Imus had sometimes referred to as a \"bald-headed stooge\"; he also performed character voices (such as New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, former New York Catholic Archbishops Cardinals Edward Egan and John Joseph O'Connor, and poet Maya Angelou). McGuirk was the only other member of the cast to lose his job in the Rutgers controversy and was initially off air for the first few weeks of the revival before returning.\n\nAt the time of the show's ending, Sid Rosenberg was the program's sports reporter. He engaged in disputes with his fellow cast members, including a boxing bout with McGuirk. He also co-hosted Middays on WFAN with Jody McDonald and Joe Beningo. Rosenberg resigned from WFAN in 2005 and was fired later that year from the Imus show for comments about Kylie Minogue's Breast Cancer Diagnosis. He worked at various sports stations in South Florida for 10 years, and remained a substitute and guest contributor on the Imus program, before returning to his post on the program when Warner Wolf, who had two prolonged runs as the program's sportscaster, was ousted in November 2016. Other sports reporters included Chris Carlin (best known for \"the fat boy lock of the week!,\") Patrick McEnroe (who auditioned to replace Imus on WFAN), Don Criqui, Mike Breen (valued for his deadpan delivery of false sports news, and ridiculed after his head injuries during the 2008 NBA Finals), and Christopher \"Mad Dog\" Russo. For years, Larry \"Ratso\" Sloman contributed humorous New York Rangers reports but after he collaborated with Howard Stern on \"Private Parts\" he was persona non grata on the show and became a whipping boy for Imus especially when Imus' guest was Kinky Friedman, who is a close friend of Ratso.\n\nRob Bartlett impersonated a cast of celebrities (Bill Clinton, The Godfather, Dr. Phil, Brian Wilson, Hulk Hogan, Rush Limbaugh, Scott Muni, Omar Minaya, Alberto Gonzales, Vicente Fox, Al Gore, Blind Mississippi White Boy Pig Feets Dupris, Liza Minnelli, Yoko Ono, Carl Paladino, Mick Jagger and many others).\n\nTony Powell, an African-American comedian, originally gave sports reports before shifting into a general contributor and celebrity impersonator, usually impersonating black celebrities such as Little Richard, Jesse Jackson, Eddie Murphy, and Charles Rangel. He was one of two African-Americans added to the staff when the show returned on WABC and RFD; Texas native Karith Foster was the other, though Foster left when her contract was not renewed in 2009, just prior to the move to Fox Business Network. Powell filled a role previously held by Larry Kenney, an impersonator who (along with Bartlett) served as a celebrity impersonator (some of the voices Kenney impersonated Richard Nixon, George Patton, Ted Kennedy, Andy Rooney, Jack Nicholson, and Jerry Falwell), but was bumped from the program when it returned on WABC and RFD in favor of Foster and Powell.\n\nLou Rufino served as the program engineer; he had a considerable on-air role, but did not appear on-air as often as the other cast members.\n\nOther previous reporters included Janice Dean, Christy Musumeci, and Tracy Burgess, who departed for Fox News Channel, MSNBC, and WFAN respectively. Karith Foster, a Texas-raised black woman hired in the wake of the Rutgers controversy, was a comedian and general contributor, but left the show in August 2009 after her contract was not renewed. Alexis Glick briefly served as a business reporter for the show shortly after it debuted on Fox Business, but left the show and the network after two months; Diane Macedo and Dagen McDowell filled the positions for the remainder of the show's run on Fox Business.\n\nImus had regular guests on the program to discuss upcoming sporting events. Typically, these guests appeared only during the season of their respective sport. Such guests include Jim Nantz and Phil Simms (of CBS) and Terry Bradshaw (of Fox) for football, and Darrell Waltrip (of Fox) for NASCAR. During an interview with Boomer Esiason, after ridiculing him, Imus chided Esiason with a trademark phrase \"get off my phone,\" insisting he hang up. Esiason shot back with \"no, you get off \"my\" phone.\" Other frequent guests included Bo Dietl, a private investigator; and Imus's wife.\n\nImus offended President Bill Clinton with remarks in front of the Clintons during a 1996 Radio and Television Correspondents Association dinner speech.\n\nOn October 19, 1998, \"Newsday\" reported that Imus called Washington \"Post\" media writer Howard Kurtz \"that boner-nosed ... beanie-wearing little Jew boy\".\n\nImus has had a long-standing rivalry with Howard Stern, dating back to their days at WNBC. It most recently boiled to the surface in 2003, when Stern called Imus while both were on the air to demand an apology for a comedy skit that Imus had aired. After exchanging insults, Imus cut Stern off. In late 2005, Imus commented that he wished Stern would do well at Sirius satellite radio, as Imus held Sirius stock. In a CBS News interview he conducted before his retirement, Imus stated that he considered Stern one of the best radio performers in history, along with himself, Arthur Godfrey, Jack Benny and Wolfman Jack.\n\nWhen the program was simulcast on MSNBC, Imus frequently ridiculed NBC/MSNBC personalities, staff, programs, and policies. During election coverage in 2004, NBC set up an outdoor interactive visitors attraction, \"Democracy Plaza\" at Rockefeller Center. Imus referred to it as \"Hypocrisy Plaza.\"\n\nOn the December 15, 2004, \"Imus in the Morning\" show, Don Imus referred to the publishers Simon & Schuster as \"thieving Jews\" and later in the same show gave a mock apology, calling the phrase \"thieving Jews\", \"redundant\".\n\nBeginning in February 2005, MSNBC featured Amy Robach, and then-afternoon regular Contessa Brewer as news readers on \"Imus in the Morning\". Brewer held the position for over two months and was the target of Imus's constant ridicule, which was initially dismissed as typical show fodder. On April 29, 2005, the \"New York Post\" published a statement attributed to Brewer calling Imus a \"cantankerous old fool.\" He responded on-air by calling her \"fat\" and \"painfully stupid,\" and hurled countless personal insults. Brewer left \"Imus in the Morning\" immediately.\n\nOn November 30, 2006, on \"Imus in the Morning\", Imus referred to the Jewish management at CBS as \"money-grubbing bastards\".\n\nSid Rosenberg, who provided sports updates on the Imus show, got into trouble when he suggested on air that tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams were animals better suited to pose for \"National Geographic\" than \"Playboy\". Rosenberg also stated that Palestinians mourning the death of Yasser Arafat were \"stinking animals\" upon whom the Israelis \"ought to drop the bomb right there, kill 'em all right now...\" He was fired from the Don Imus show after making crude remarks about Australian singer Kylie Minogue's breast cancer diagnosis. Chris Carlin replaced Rosenberg, although Rosenberg continued to call into the Imus program up until its cancellation on WFAN/MSNBC. He has appeared on the WABC/RFD incarnation on different occasions, notably providing reports from Super Bowl XLIII.\n\nOn the \"Imus in the Morning\" broadcast of April 4, 2007, substitute sportscaster Sid Rosenberg of WAXY reported on Rutgers University's 59-46 loss the previous evening to the University of Tennessee, in the final game of the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship. As MSNBC rolled tape of the game footage, Imus said in a voiceover, \"They're some rough girls from Rutgers. They got tattoos.\" Bernard McGuirk then interjected, \"yeah, hardcore hos.\" Imus then added, \"That's some nappy-headed hos right there.\"\nMcGuirk then compared the game to \"the jigaboos versus the wannabes,\" in apparent allusion to the Spike Lee film \"School Daze\".\n\nThe following day, Bryan Monroe, the president of the National Association of Black Journalists, described Imus's comments as \"beyond offensive\" and called for his immediate firing. MSNBC responded later that day with a statement disassociating itself from Imus's remarks. On the April 6 \"Imus in the Morning\" show, Imus expressed regret over his remarks, contending that it was said in jest by \"a good man who did a bad thing\".\n\nOn Saturday, April 7, the Rev. Al Sharpton, described by \"The New York Times\" as \"among the leaders of the movement to force Don Imus off the air\", told an angry audience in Harlem, New York that Imus should be \"taken off the airwaves\" for the racially disparaging remark.\n\nProtest demonstrations by \"Rainbow/PUSH\" in Chicago, Illinois, in front of NBC's owned-and-operated Chicago station were led by Rev. Jesse Jackson on April 9 as 50 demonstrators held signs reading \"No apologies, no forgiveness\" and chanting \"Imus must go\".\n\nAlso on April 9, presidential candidate Barack Obama termed Imus's comments, \"Divisive, hurtful, and offensive to Americans of all backgrounds\", saying \"With a public platform comes a trust. As far as I'm concerned, he violated that trust\".\n\nClarence Page, who had occasionally been a guest on \"Imus in the Morning\", wrote that Imus broke a promise made to him six years previously to eschew racially offensive remarks.\n\nAmidst the gathering protests, Imus delivered a second, lengthier apology at the beginning of the \"Imus in the Morning\" program on Monday, April 9 and offered to meet with the Rutgers team to apologize personally. Imus again stated that he \"is a good person who made a very bad mistake\", citing his charitable works. Later that day, CBS Radio and NBC (which owns MSNBC through its NBC News division) announced a two-week suspension of Don Imus' program on radio and television starting Monday, April 16. The initial delay in the start of the suspension was to allow the WFAN Radiothon, which was to begin on April 12, to still be broadcast on MSNBC. NBC News President Steve Capus released a prepared statement explaining the network's action:\n\n\"Beginning Monday, April 16, MSNBC will suspend simulcasting the syndicated \"Imus in the Morning\" radio program for two weeks. This comes after careful consideration in the days since his racist, abhorrent comments were made. Don Imus has expressed profound regret and embarrassment and has made a commitment to listen to all of those who have raised legitimate expressions of outrage. In addition, his dedication – in his words – to change the discourse on his program moving forward, has confirmed for us that this action is appropriate. Our future relationship with Imus is contingent on his ability to live up to his word.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, April 11, 2007, NBC News announced that MSNBC would no longer simulcast \"Imus in the Morning\", effective immediately.\n\nSeveral advertisers of \"Imus in the Morning\" announced their withdrawal from sponsorship, including General Motors (Imus' biggest advertiser) Staples Inc., Sprint Nextel, American Express, and Procter & Gamble.\n\nCapus also revealed that in staff meetings, NBC's African-American news staff and on-air personalities opposed Imus' return to MSNBC, with Al Roker of the \"Today\" show expressing particularly strong opposition both internally and on the \"Today\" show's website. Capus denied, however, that the loss of ad revenue was a determining factor in his network's decision to drop Imus. He was quoted by \"The New York Times\" as saying that \"The reputation of the news division means more to me than advertising dollars. Because if you lose your reputation, you lose everything.\" The absence and silence from Imus' frequent NBC guests Brian Williams, Andrea Mitchell, David Gregory, Chris Matthews and close 'friend' Tim Russert was obvious and an indication of NBC's future action.\n\nMSNBC's timing of Imus' cancellation was criticized on WFAN, as \"Imus in the Morning\" had been scheduled to kick off the 18th Annual WFAN Radiothon, a large annual fundraising event, the next morning. The Radiothon aired April 12 on radio only.\n\nAsked for his reaction, Sharpton told \"The New York Times\" that \"we have been halfway successful so far\" and that he was planning to organize a demonstration in front of CBS’s Manhattan corporate headquarters. He said, \"This has never been about Don Imus. I have no idea whether he is a good man or not. This is about the use of public airwaves for bigoted, racist speech.\"\n\nOn Thursday morning, April 12, 2007, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton met with CBS President and CEO Les Moonves to demand that Imus be fired. That afternoon, Moonves issued a statement announcing that CBS Radio had cancelled \"Imus in the Morning,\" effective immediately:.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Jackson called the removal \"a victory for public decency. No one should use the public airwaves to transmit racial or sexual degradation.\"\n\nSharpton said of Imus, \"He says he wants to be forgiven. I hope he continues in that process. But we cannot afford a precedent established that the airways can commercialize and mainstream sexism and racism.\"\n\nThe final day of the WFAN Radiothon, April 13, was co-hosted by Deirdre Imus and Charles McCord during the hours when \"Imus in the Morning\" formerly aired.\n\nDon and Deirdre Imus met with the Rutgers team on the evening of April 12 at the New Jersey Governor's Mansion, according to a report broadcast by CNN, which characterized the meeting as \"emotional\". C. Vivian Stringer, coach of the Rutgers team, said the next day that she and her team \"still find his statements to be unacceptable,\" but that they accepted Imus's apology.\n\nCivil rights and women's groups such as the National Organization for Women praised CBS and MSNBC for their action, saying that there is no place on the public airwaves for racial and anti-female slurs. \"Newsweek\" magazine in its April 23, 2007 cover story said that for too long its own reporters coveted an invitation to appear on \"Imus in the Morning\": \"The Power That Was\", \"Newsweek\"\n\nOthers, however, criticized the cancellation of \"Imus in the Morning\" as a \"double standard\", arguing that Imus was merely echoing the truth common to rap music lyrics heard on recordings, MTV, and BET. This idea itself, however, has been countered, as some think it laughable that \"pundits and politicians have apparently decided on a consensus culprit to cleanse the national soul: hip-hop\".\n\nIn reaction to the Imus show and its cancellation, there were calls for an end to offensive language in the rap music genre. [[Richard Dietl|\"Bo\" Dietl]], a regular guest on \"Imus in the Morning\" denounced Moonves on [[Fox News Channel]] for CBS' cancellation of Imus while producing rap music with anti-female lyrics, saying, \"Mr. Les Moonves, you care about the quality, why don't you care about your CBS records with all the garbage my 17-year-old daughter listens to and they use this word 'ho' back and forth and they degrade women all the time. If I thought that Don Imus was a racist in any part, shape or form, I wouldn't be here today.\"\n\nBefore his show was canceled, Imus and CBS had signed a contract extension for about $10 million per year. Before Imus could explore another broadcasting job it was necessary for Imus and CBS to reach a settlement on the contract.\n\nOn May 4, 2007, [[Martin Garbus]], a lawyer for Imus, claimed that the broadcasters of the program could have edited Imus's comments, given that the program was subject to [[Tape delay (broadcasting)|tape delay]]. The lawyer also indicated that Imus would sue CBS Radio for $120 million in unpaid salary and damages. CBS Radio replied that it would vigorously defend against the suit.\n\nDuring a June 29, 2007 broadcast, comments were made by WFAN host [[Mike Francesa]] and McCord which seemed to indicate that Imus would be returning to the air in the near future, possibly rejoining WFAN. The comments were made during a 20th anniversary celebration of WFAN, as part of a broadcast meant to honor Imus's contribution to the station. McCord noted that the broadcast seemed to reflect on Imus through a [[rear-view mirror]]. Then he quipped, \"Be warned: Objects in the mirror may be closer than they appear.\" Francesa then cryptically added that by, \"this September, I hope the team will once again be complete.\" Technically, both comments were accurate: McCord's \"warning\" could be seen as a prediction that he and Imus would reunite, which would indeed happen on a rival station, and Francesa's comment was true on the basis that [[Boomer Esiason]] and [[Craig Carton]] took over the morning position permanently in September 2007.\n\nOn August 14, 2007, it became clear that Imus would not return to WFAN when it was announced that Imus and CBS agreed to a settlement.\n\nAlthough speculated since his dismissal, the return to morning radio for Imus was officially announced by New York talk-radio station [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] on November 1, 2007. The show's first broadcast aired on December 3. The financial package between Imus and WABC is a 5-year deal worth up to $40 million.\n\nNewsman Charles McCord, producer Bernard McGuirk, and engineer Lou Rufino are part of the revived show, along with most of television production crew that worked the MSNBC broadcast; the first guests were historian [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]], Senator [[John McCain]], Senator [[Christopher Dodd]], Democratic Party strategist [[James Carville]], and Imus regular [[Bo Dietl]].\n\nA significant rollout of \"Imus in the Morning\" took place in March 2008 following mass layoffs at [[Citadel Broadcasting]]. Imus was packaged with [[The True Oldies Channel]] to replace select underperforming Citadel stations. In August, Imus claimed his show was heard on more stations than it was at the time of his 2007 firing.\n\nAs of late 2009 the show remains one of the ten most listened to morning shows in New York City. Imus signed three-year extensions with [[Cumulus Media Networks]] (the company that bought Citadel in late 2011) and television partner Fox Business Network (see below) in December 2012. The arrangement with Cumulus was again renewed in 2016.\n\nImus was originally in talks with \"big-market\" TV suitors [[Fox Business|Fox Business Network]], [[Fox News Channel]], and others to simulcast the show on national television. On November 13, it was announced that a 5-year deal was reached to simulcast \"Imus in the Morning\" on [[RFD-TV]], which is available on both [[DISH Network]] and [[DirecTV]] but only (as of November 2007) on a limited number of cable providers. The number of systems carrying RFD was anticipated to increase because of the Imus deal. The show was broadcast from 6-9am eastern time on RFD-TV and from 6-9pm in [[High-definition television|high-definition]] on RFD HD. In addition, the RFD press release announcing the deal stated: \"[RFD] is developing plans to offer the Imus video programming through new technologies including VOD, streaming, and podcasts, as well as, seek worldwide distribution of the RFD-TV production to obtain the highest possible audience.\". However, during the program's tenure on RFD, none of the above \"new technologies\" (VOD, streaming, nor a podcast) ever materialized. (These would eventually arrive in 2011, long after Imus left the network.)\n\nThe final show on RFD TV aired August 28, 2009. Although the contract between Imus and RFD was originally for five years, both parties decided to mutually end the simulcast prematurely, amid reports of the program's inevitable move to Fox Business. Shortly thereafter, Imus inked a new television deal with [[Fox Business|Fox Business Network]] (FBN), a channel that was already a significant sponsor of the show.\n\nThe show debuted on FBN on October 5, 2009. The \"Imus in the Morning\" program physically moved from ABC Radio studios to Fox Business studios as part of the deal, and simulcasted live on FBN from 6am to 9am ET. On January 18, 2010, \"Imus in the Morning\" was extended by 20 minutes on Fox Business Network, from 6am to 9:20am ET, after the abrupt cancellation of \"[[The Opening Bell on Fox Business]]\". Thus, virtually the entire show was simulcast on television, until February 24, 2014, when \"Imus in the Morning\" was truncated by 20 minutes. Therefore, the show reverted to the original 3-hour format, from 6am to 9am ET, due to the debut of \"[[Opening Bell with Maria Bartiromo]]\" on that same day.\n\nImus ended the television simulcast on May 29, 2015, when he relocated to Texas full-time; continuing the simulcast would have required the show to remain based in New York. Everyone from the radio side remained, as well as Connell McShane (who continued to work for both Imus and Fox Business simultaneously until a change in management forced McShane to focus on his Fox Business work full-time beginning at the end of 2017); the remainder of the television cast members did not follow Imus to the radio side.\n\nImus was off the air for much of 2017 because of health problems, some of which stem from a 2014 rib injury that has made it difficult for him to breathe; he has also suffered from [[emphysema]] for an unknown length of time. The health problems also forced Imus to shorten his program from four hours to three and eventually led to his 2019 death.\n\nOn January 22, 2018, Imus announced that he would be retiring and that the show would not continue under his name without him; he stated his last show would be March 29. The decision was not entirely of Imus's choosing; as he stated on-air, Cumulus Media intends to void his contract in the company's [[chapter 11 bankruptcy]] proceedings. Even if Cumulus had not gone bankrupt, Imus was planning on retiring at the end of his contract in December. In his closing remarks, Imus tearfully expressed remorse for his 2007 statements, thanked a select few members of the family and close radio associates, and stated that, while he would not miss the grind of a daily radio show, he would miss the listeners, thanking them for listening and for their contributions to the numerous charitable causes Imus promoted throughout his career.\n\nMcGuirk and Rosenberg continue in the time slot as co-hosts of \"The Bernie & Sid Show\" (later renamed \"Bernie and Sid in the Morning\").\n\n\n[[Category:Fox Business Network programs]]\n[[Category:MSNBC original programming]]\n[[Category:American talk radio programs]]\n[[Category:1996 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1990s American television news programs]]\n[[Category:2000s American television news programs]]\n[[Category:2010s American television news programs]]\n[[Category:Simulcasts]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series based on radio programs]]\n[[Category:Westwood One]]\n[[Category:1971 radio programme debuts]]"}

He moved to the National Hockey League (NHL) after the collapse of professional hockey in the west, and finished his career playing with the Chicago Black Hawks, Pittsburgh Pirates and Boston Bruins.\n\nA gifted scorer, MacKay led the PCHA in goals three times, assists twice, and was the league's all-time leading scorer upon its demise. Lester Patrick called him the greatest centre to ever play in the coast league; he was named to the PCHA or WCHL first team all-star on seven occasions, and to the second team three times. MacKay won the Stanley Cup twice during his career: first with the Millionaires in 1915 and later with the Bruins in 1929. In 1952, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nDuncan \"Mickey\" MacKay was born in Chesley, Ontario on May 21, 1894. He grew up on the family farm in Bruce County, near Chesley. He joined the Canadian Army at the age of 14 and briefly trained at the Valcartier training camp in Quebec until recruiting officers realized he was underage and discharged him from the service.\n\nMacKay learned to skate at the age of 15 and spent two seasons playing senior hockey in Chesley. He moved west in 1912 to join the Edmonton Dominions of the Alberta Senior Hockey League where he led the league with eight playoff goals. He left the Dominions following the season for a senior team in Grand Forks, British Columbia, where he was the provincial league's leading goalscorer with 15 goals in 1913–14.\n\nHoping to advance his career, MacKay wrote to Frank Patrick, operator of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), expressing his desire to turn professional. Patrick initially replied by suggesting the young player try out for a team closer to his hometown in Ontario. However, making what he described as a \"sixth sense hunch\", Patrick wrote a second letter inviting MacKay to try out for his team in Vancouver. Patrick doubted MacKay's ability the first time he saw him practice, but was convinced the second time around. He signed MacKay to a contract for the 1914–15 PCHA season on November 3, 1914. MacKay made his professional debut on December 8, playing on a line with Frank Nighbor and Ken Mallen and scored a hat trick in his first game. He finished the season as the league leader with 33 goals in just 17 games, and was named a first team all-star. Vancouver won the PCHA title, then defeated the Ottawa Senators to win the Stanley Cup. MacKay had four goals in the series in which Vancouver won all three games.\n\nMacKay was a consistent PCHA all-star in the seasons that followed, earning berths on the second team in 1916, 1918 and 1921, and on the first team in 1917, 1919, 1922 and 1923. He posted a 22-goal season in 23 games in 1916–17, He played in his second Stanley Cup championship with the Millionaires in 1918, leading all skaters with five goals and five assists in five games. Though MacKay was held out as a star of the series, the Millionaires were defeated by the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Toronto Arenas in the fifth and deciding game of the series.\n\nA late-season battle between the Millionaires and the Seattle Metropolitans in 1919 turned violent when Seattle's Cully Wilson slashed MacKay across the mouth late in the game. MacKay suffered a broken jaw and lost five teeth as a result, while Wilson was later banned from the PCHA for life. MacKay left the PCHA following the season, moving to Alberta where he bought a farm near the village of Elnora. He was one of several players who successfully petitioned the Alberta Amateur Athletic Union to regain his amateur status, and signed on to play with the Calgary Columbus Club of the newly formed Big-4 League.\n\nMacKay returned to Vancouver and the professional ranks in 1920 amidst charges by Millionaires' owner Frank Patrick that the Big-4 was secretly paying players in violation of amateur standards. Calgary media suggested that MacKay was one of the players who had informed Patrick of the situation in Alberta, a charge that he denied. On the ice, he helped lead the Millionaires to the 1921 Stanley Cup Finals, which they lost to the Ottawa Senators in five games.\n\nRemaining a top scorer in the PCHA, MacKay led the league in assists with 12 in 1921–22 and in goals with 21 in 1923–24. The PCHA merged with the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) prior to the 1924–25 season, and MacKay led the WCHL in scoring with 27 goals that season. MacKay was named a WCHL first team all-star in 1925 and 1926. The Western League collapsed following the 1925–26 season, and MacKay's contract was sold to the newly formed Chicago Black Hawks in the National Hockey League. He was the all-time leading scorer amongst PCHA and WCHL players at the league's demise with 290 points.\n\nIn two years with the Black Hawks, MacKay scored 31 goals before his playing rights were sold to the Pittsburgh Pirates prior to the 1928–29 NHL season. He appeared in only ten games with the Pirates before he was traded to the Boston Bruins on December 20, 1928 in exchange for Frank Fredrickson. With the Bruins, MacKay also served as an assistant coach and manager. He won the second Stanley Cup championship of his career that season as Boston defeated the New York Rangers to win the title.\n\nMacKay began the 1929–30 season with the Bruins, but chose to retire mid-season, although he continued as the team's business manager until the end of the year. He was regarded by his contemporaries as one of the top players of his time. Lester Patrick praised his abilities: \"He was perhaps the greatest centre we ever had on the coast. MacKay was a great crowd pleaser. He was clean, splendidly courageous, a happy player with a stylish way of going. He was one of those who helped make pro hockey a great game.\" His greatest limitation was his size, standing five foot nine and around 162 pounds; he frequently battled through injuries and missed many games throughout his career as a result. His nickname, \"the wee Scot\", was in reference to his diminutive size.\n\nLeaving the Bruins, MacKay settled near his wife's hometown of Grand Forks. He remained active in hockey, serving as a referee and coach in the area. He contemplated purchasing the Spokane Clippers of the minor professional Pacific Coast Hockey League in 1938 but decided against taking over the team. MacKay became involved in mining in the eastern Kootenays upon his return to British Columbia. He died on May 30, 1940, when traveling as part of his mining job after his vehicle left the road and hit a telephone pole near the village of Ymir. The medical examiner determined that he had suffered a heart attack, causing the crash.\n\nMacKay was posthumously honoured by several organizations for his hockey career, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1952. He was inducted into the British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame in 1989, and is an honoured member of the British Columbia Hockey Hall of Fame.\n"}

{"id": "1995426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995426", "title": "Hethersett", "text": "Hethersett\n\nHethersett is a large village and electoral ward in the county of Norfolk, England, about south-west of Norwich. It covers an area of and had a population of 5,441 in 2,321 households at the 2001 census, increasing to 5,691 at the 2011 census. In 2013 Hethersett became the first village or town in the United Kingdom to receive a Prime Minister's Big Society Award for its outstanding contribution to the Olympic legacy and sport and fitness in general.\n\nThe Parish of Hethersett is, by Norfolk standards, a large one, covering 2,695 acres; it was the main settlement in the ancient Hundred of Humbleyard; it lies in the Deanery of Humbleyard and in the South Norfolk District.\n\nHethersett stretched three miles from east to west along the line of the B1172 (the old Norwich to London road) and two miles from northwest to southeast. The road cuts it into slightly larger northern and smaller southern divisions; the Norwich to Cambridge railway follows its southern boundary but otherwise the parish has no obvious physical limits and presumably represents the land needed to feed the Saxon settlements that grew up in the area.\n\nFrom the west, moving in a clockwise direction, the parishes contiguous with this are those of Wymondham, Great Melton, Little Melton, Colney, Cringleford, Intwood (now part of Keswick) and Ketteringham.\n\nThe meaning of the name of Hethersett is not clear; the guide to the church suggests the enclosure for the deer: 'heedra' is an Old English word for heather or heath, and 'set' is Old English for a dwelling place, camp, stable or fold. This would give the meaning as being that of a camp or enclosure on the heath.\n\nAlthough the name is Saxon, we have evidence of earlier settlers; a New Stone Age long barrow (burial mound) lies in Cantley and two areas of Roman pottery have been found in the northern part of the parish; in view of the existence of a great Roman centre at Caistor St Edmund, the latter finds are nor surprising.\n\nThe earliest description of Hethersett comes to us in the Domesday Book account of 1086; it would seem that there were perhaps 400 people in the parish by that time. The Lord of the Manor had 87 sheep and seven hives of bees, perhaps gathering nectar from the heather, among his possessions.\n\nThe Domesday Book also mentions the church with its 60 acres of land, a handsome endowment: no Saxon or Norman work remains to be seen because of later rebuilding. There is also mention of a second church and this presumably applies to the church of Cantley, then a separate parish, of which nothing now remains except some mounds in a pasture to the north of Cantley Farm. This small parish was amalgamated with its larger neighbour in 1397 although the church was used as a chapel until the 16th century.\n\nDuring medieval times, the parish seems to have had an uneventful history. The present parish church was begun in 1320 and the tower and nave arcades and windows are in the decorated style (1290–1330). It is dedicated to St Remigius (438–533), the great Bishop of Rheims. Remigius de Hethersete, a priest who also participated in the building of Hingham Church, may have suggested the dedication in honour of his name-saint. The clerestory of the nave and the lovely north porch were added in the 15th century.\n\nThe Domesday village had become three manors or at least was part of three manors by the 13th century. These became known as Hethersett Cromwells, Hethersett Hacons and Hethersett Woodhall. Cromwells was the chief manor and its manor house was probably in the meadows immediately to the south of Church Farm. Hacons and Woodhall sites are less certain and the lands of these manors lay in the neighbouring parishes as well as Hethersett. Thickthorn seems to have had a separate hamlet with its own moated house near to the present Hall.\n\nAs the community grew during the 16th century, the commons became especially important to those who had little other land. Hethersett with its open green, Lynch Green, would have had cottages and farm buildings around the edge. Lynch Green opened out westwards to the great common where Wymondham, Great Melton and Hethersett parishes met. The most famous event in Hethersett's history took place in 1549 when Robert Kett and his men tore down John Flowerdew's hedges on Hethersett common. Kett's Oak is said to commemorate the spot where rebels gathered before marching to Mousehold Heath in Norwich.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, several fine houses were built or added to in the village. Access was improved by the turnpiking of the main road in the middle of the 17th century. Farmhouses of some style were built at Hill Farm, Whitehouse Farm, Cedar Grange and Beech Grove as yeomen bought up land and some of the common fields disappeared.\n\nWoodhall, the Priory and the Old Hall were modernised and extended by Norwich merchants such as John Buckle, Mayor of Norwich in 1793, who lived in the Priory.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Hethersett Hall was built and its attractive park and ornamental lake laid out by the Back family. The Hill House estate was laid out in the 1780s by a Mr Brown. Perhaps the greatest change of all came as a result of the enclosure award of 1799 when Lynch Green was divided up and disappeared as an open space, although the tithe map shows that there were still only a few houses along Mill Road and Great Melton Road in 1844.\n\nIn \"Victorian Miniature\", Owen Chadwick gives us a detailed account of life in the area in the middle of the 19th century. The Rev William Waite Andrew, the Vicar of Ketteringham and one of the two central characters in the book, lived at Woodhall which he bought for £3,600 in 1841, and to which he added a new western extension.\n\nIn the 19th century, village crafts and small industries employed a number of men locally; two windmills existed, one giving the name to Mill Road. Three smithies existed in the village in the 1880s and carriages were built at Harveys. There was a brickyard in Queen's Road. The railway lasted 120 years; it arrived as the Norwich & Brandon Railway in 1846, but was closed to passengers in 1966.\n\nHethersett lies so close to Norwich that many think of it as just another of its suburbs. It is, however, a separate community with its own vitality and quite a marked community spirit. This shows itself not only in the wide range of activities in the village but also in more permanent ways in items provided for the village through the efforts of villagers. These include a learner swimming pool in the Middle School, a bench in the memory of Zita James sited at the church, a cassette library, the conversion of School House in the Middle School to provide a Music Room, the erection of a village sign, village street plans, the Jubilee Youth Club and the Scout and Guide Hut. Trees have been planted in various parts of the village and a memorial plaque has been erected on the site of the old School (No 3 Queen's Road). The Parish Council have provided litter bins, salt and grit bins for use in icy weather and \"Fido\" bins.\n\nIn September 1994 the new village hall was opened in Back Lane, funded mostly by Wilcon Homes under a Section 106 Planning Gain agreement. The hall has a purpose built stage with seating for 250 and also provides a committee room for 50 people.\n\nIn 1801 Hethersett had a population of 696 (in 90 houses), by 1851 this number had nearly doubled, but it never reached this total again until 1931; since then and especially in the last 20 years or so, Hethersett's population has risen to over 5,000. It is now as large as some of Norfolk's market towns. During the past seven years the Steepletower site near the parish church has expanded rapidly; by 1995 about 360 dwellings had been completed out of a projected figure of 520.\n\nWater supply, mains drains, a new surface water drainage system, street lights, branch library, new first school and high school, reflect the demands of a rapidly growing population for improved services. The village has its own post office, bank, surgery, pharmacy and dentist and the recent development of the square in Great Melton Road (known to locals as Oak Square) has brought new shopping facilities to the centre of the village.\n\nThe construction of the A11 dual carriageway from Cringleford to Wymondham has reduced the traffic using the old A11 (now B1172). Concern continues to be expressed about the dangerous staggered crossing at the A11/Station Lane junction. Following the death of a local schoolboy, lighting has been installed, but many residents prefer to travel to Ketteringham and beyond via the Ketteringham Lane bridge over the A11 to avoid this blackspot.\n\nThe effects of the opening of the Norwich Southern Bypass are less direct, but already land nearby has come under pressure for development. Hethersett's situation so close to Norwich with its excellent facilities and transport links means pressures for growth and development (both desirable and undesirable) will continue in the foreseeable future.\n\nDespite the substantial growth of housing over the last 40 years, the Parish of Hethersett still has much wildlife interest. The built up area covers less than 25% of this large parish, leaving a considerable acreage of arable land and open spaces.\n\nTwo areas of much interest are the Kissing and Suckling Lanes, both public footpaths. From the former the walker has excellent views of the park with its remaining large trees and lake. Members of the thrush family regularly feed here; sometimes in early spring these include large gatherings of fieldfares and redwings before they depart for their eastern breeding grounds. Both Canada and Barnacle geese breed in the vicinity of the lake where mallards, moorhens and coots are regularly seen. Commorants also visit these waters with a variety of other ducks dropping in from time to time. The careful observer can often see a patient heron or even a kingfisher waiting for a catch.\n\nThere are many interesting walks in the parish including footpaths to the Village Pit and from New Road to Great Melton church. They contain old hedges and mature trees providing suitable homes for various birds. Hethersett continues to grow but it remains a village with much natural beauty for those with the eyes and ears willing to seek it.\n\nHethersett had a church at the time of the Domesday Book of 1086. How long before is unknown. There is nothing visible of the early building. Today's church dates from the 14th century with 15th-century additions. It is built of flints and local field stones with Caen stone dressings and the roof is of lead and slate.\n\nThe tower, built in four stages, supports a lead-dressed steeple which is topped by a weathervane depicting a dove perched upon a coiled serpent and holding in its beak, love-lies-bleeding. Chequered flushwork of dressed stone and flints around the plinth and buttress facings contrast with the field stones and small patches of brickwork of the tower walls. There are niches at the lower levels and a 14th-century west window with decorated tracery.\n\nA clock faces the road, and below the battlements, on each face, are 14th-century two-light openings. Small quatrefoil openings provide daylight to the tower stairs ascending in the southwest corner. A medieval door to the stairs gives access to eight bells cast between 1607 and 1904.\n\nAn attractive 15th-century porch on the north side is built with broken flints embellished with flushwork. It is entered through a perpendicular arch flanked by side shafts with salamander capitals and angels carved within spandrels.\n\nInside, the ribs of a fine vaulted ceiling supporting the priest room above spring from carved corbels. The nave, enhanced in the 15th century and restored in 1858 has two roof lines and a shallow clerestory. Both aisles have matching windows.\n\nThe north side is buttressed with dressed stone and flint while at the south, red brick replaces earlier work.\n\nAround 1535, following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the chancel fell into disrepair. Rebuilding took place in 1897 and at the same time transepts were formed by extending the aisles eastwards. Field stones and flint facings salvaged from the foundations of the nearby ruined hall were used in the rebuild. Diagonal buttresses support the corners. The east window dates from the 14th century. Gable crosses adorn the chancel and nave.\n\nInside, floral decoration and texts are painted above the arches of the arcades, tower and chancel. An early 13th-century styled piscina with a marble colonette is in the chancel and another, with a trefoil head of 14th-century origins, in the Lady Chapel.\n\nThe octagonal font with traceried bowl now stands at the west end of the north aisle. The beautifully painted panels of the reredos depicting saints was the work of Sister Myra of All Hallows' Convent, Ditchingham.\n\nIn 1858, the stonework was restored and the church refitted with open benches, oak pulpit, etc., at a cost of £1,200, raised by subscription. Henry Back, J. H. Gurney and the rector were the largest contributors, the former also restoring the belfry, recasting one bell, and the latter, restoring the south porch and the two altar tombs.\n\nMr Back gave the organ in 1874. There are several memorials inside the church, one of the most striking being that of John Luke Iselin in the form of a black ledger stone of marble in the central aisle of the nave. He was a native of Basel in Switzerland, who came to this country in the 1770s and applied for naturalisation in 1772 after making a success as partner of a wool stapling business.\n\nThe earliest headstones are to be found at the west end of the churchyard. There is one to Mary, daughter of John and Mary Bowles, 1708, to Abigail Howes, 1779, and to Sarah, the wife of Robert Harpley, 1791.\n\nThe churchyard today is a tranquil place but in the early years of the 19th century, when body snatchers were active in acquiring bodies for anatomical dissection, there is a report that on 2 February 1825, \"A body of an old man, buried in Hethersett churchyard was stolen by resurrection men. A similar outrage took place in Thorpe churchyard on the same date.\" An interesting connection to this incident was the fact that on 21 January 1829, there was a doctors' meeting at the Guildhall about difficulties in pursuing anatomical studies, and that the legislature was to be petitioned.\n\nThe weathervane is quite unusual, and an explanation was given in the Sunday Companion of July 1922. The living was in the gift of Caius College, Cambridge, and the design embodies the crest worn by Dr Caius, who founded Gonville College, later, Gonville and Caius, in the late 16th century.\n\nThe dove is represented holding in its beak what was the styled flower gentle, otherwise Amaranthus, love-lies-bleeding, a symbol of immortality. It was early in the 18th century that Dr John Gostlin, the patron of the living, gave the patronage to the Master and Fellows of the College.\n\nJohn Berney was rector of Hethersett, 1736–82, and also rector of Saxlingham Nethergate and Saxlingham, and Archdeacon of Norwich. In the tithe book for 1737–69, it is recorded that Dr Berney \"the liberal benefactor to this living has forborn to add the expenses of the new stable\", presumably at the rectory, \"the spire of the church, and many expenses in the gardens and yards\".\n\nThere were three 19th-century rectors, Bartholomew Edwards, Jeremy Day, to whom the oak pulpit was dedicated, and William Reynolds Collett. Collett (1855–1903), was very interested in the history of St Remigius and Hethersett parish, and there are many entries in the parish magazines written by him.\n\nIn August 1874, the rector stated that the earliest parish register was from 1616. He estimated the population of Hethersett, then, as about 500. In 1875, he gave his view on the changes in Hethersett church in the turbulent years resulting from Queen Mary Tudor's accession in 1553.\n\nAt that time, the rector of the previous five years, Christopher Wilson, was obliged to resign and his place was taken by Edward Jackson, a more compliant man who adopted the usages of the Church of Rome and who then, on Elizabeth I's accession, adopted the requirements of the law. He remained rector until 1573.\n\nIn September 1880, Collett's notes give some idea of the situation in Hethersett in the late 17th century.\n\n\nAnd in October 1899, \"An effort is being made to obtain lectures by various speakers on subjects of general interest on some of the coming moonlit evenings.\" This is a reminder that winter events had to be planned around the phases of the moon.\n\nCanon John Still followed the Rev. Collett as rector, 1903–14. During the late 19th century he had been a missionary at the time when cannibals were still active in Melanesia, now the Solomon Islands. He became rector in 1903 and died on 19 August 1914 during the 8.30am service whilst preaching in front of the pulpit. The place of his collapse is marked with a marble inlay.\n\nThe Back family were generous benefactors of the church. In 1860, two pieces of land were sold to the church. Later, three pieces of land to extend the churchyard, were given, the first on 2 March 1888 on the south side, reserving part as a family burial site, on 29 October 1920, a strip on the east side, and in 1943, land between the present B1172 and the sunken roadway.\n\nA vestry meeting held in June 1897 resolved to form a committee to plan the rebuilding of the chancel of St. Remigius. However, it appears that this was a continuation of proposals formulated about 1877 as the new committee had already had sums of £1,753.10s.0d paid or promised, and architects' plans of 1877 and 1881 were available. The 1881 plan furnished by the late A. E. Browne, provided for the addition of an organ chamber at the end of the south aisle and a vestry on the north side.\n\nThe parish magazine of July 1897 goes on to state that \"the east window will be restored to its original position, and beneath it, as now, will fit into the present reredos erected in 1866.\" There was an estimate of £2,000, which, the writer says, will be forthcoming freely. (The final account was to be £2,600.)\n\nThe rebuilding of the chancel began on 12 July 1897, the first step being the removal of the east window and much of the east wall. The foundations of the old chancel were apparently firm and good and the new walls were raised on them. In clearing these foundations at the east end, workmen found and replaced in situ the sills of two small windows which gave light to a chamber below the high altar. The then rector said that the new walls were to be two feet three inches in thickness, about eighteen inches of which being nine inches Peterborough brick, with a nine-inch outer facing of flintwork.\n\nHe also reported that about 35 years previously, when windows were removed, signs of a Norman chisel were revealed, and that a few years previously, (presumably previous to the date at which he was writing, November 1897), traces of a Norman doorway were discovered in the north porch. This would have been some 300 years before the present building was erected by Sir William Bernack and confirms the documentary evidence found in the Domesday Book.\n\nThe parish magazine of November 1897 states that the best of the flints used to rebuild the chancel were taken from the foundations of an old hall which many years previously became deserted and allowed to fall into decay. It was known as \"Mockbeggar Hall\" because its ancient reputation of helping the poor had been lost.\n\nApparently, the hall had once been owned by a wealthy man but eventually was occupied by the squatters of the time and thus needy travellers were disappointed at finding no succour, hence the unusual name. The site of this important building seems to have been on the left side of a footpath leading from the southeast corner of the churchyard over a bridge to the lane from the high road to the railway station.\n\nThe rebuilt chancel was opened and dedicated on St Peter's Day, 29 June 1898 to the memory of Mrs Mary Collett, the rector's wife who had died in December 1896. The sermon was preached by the Bishop of Travencore, an Indian diocese.\n\nThe service commenced with the singing of Psalm 24 and after prayers, a Te Deum was sung. The alms collected were not for the chancel just rebuilt, but for a fund for the restoration of the roof of the original nave, which, as the rector states, \"was altered by the greedy man, (Flowerdew), who threw down the chancel just rebuilt, and who did even worse by destroying the beautiful choir at the east end of Wymondham Church. The monks were not faultless, but they were not so base as that selfish destroyer of Churches.\"\n\nThe final ceremony took place on Sunday 3 July, when the chancel was decorated by flowers which were then distributed to many mission rooms in London.\n\nIn 1937, the clock on the north side of the tower was placed to commemorate the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Recently, since 1990, kitchen and toilet facilities have been installed. Other work under consideration includes a glazed screen behind the pews which will support a balcony and floor giving access to other rooms above.\n\nAs early as 1792, there were Wesleyan Methodists in Hethersett. The Society was one of 17 which formed the Diss Circuit. At first there was no chapel and, complying with the conditions of the 1689 Toleration Act, the house of Robert Baley (probably in Mill Road) was licensed as a preaching place.\n\nOn 1 October 1817, a Wesleyan chapel was licensed, erected it is said by a Methodist builder who rented it to the Society for £8 a year. It was what is now called the Schoolroom but without the extensions.\n\nThe Tithe Map of 1846 describes it as a Meeting House. The Hethersett Society had now been transferred to the Norwich Circuit.\n\nIn the years following the death of John Wesley there were various secessions from the Wesleyan Methodist Church; the most notable were the Methodist New Connexion (1797), the Primitive Methodists (1810) and the Bible Christians (1815). Others made attempts for reform from within, particularly the Wesleyan Methodist Association (1835) and the Wesleyan Reformers (1849). These two came together in 1857 to form the United Methodist Free Churches. In 1858 the Calvert Street Circuit, including Hethersett, separated from the Wesleyans and joined this body. Some objected to too much power being in the hands of the ministers and the denying of responsibility to lay people. Others sought to combine the independence of the congregational system with the supportive role of connexionalism.\n\nThere are notes about village Societies that had failed to pay their dues; on one occasion representatives were appointed to visit Hethersett and Weston to \"improve the organisation.\"\n\nSince services had to be sustained in the villages by an itinerant ministry and local preachers, the local Society Steward was a person of some influence and importance. In Hethersett he paid the rent, kept the key and was said to have power to admit and exclude from the building whom he would.\n\nRobert Richardson was Steward from 1872 to 1909. In 1880 he allowed a temperance lecturer to use the building. To the objectors he said: \"I pay the rent and I hold the key, and the teetotaller can have his meeting. Them that don't like it will have to lump it.\"\n\nGeorge Bunn, a Methodist ploughman who came to live in the village, preached twice a quarter and conducted a weekly class meeting. In 1910 William Wade a local coach builder became Society Steward. He helped to form the first Chapel Trust. It owned the organ, the pulpit Bible and the lamps. It also purchased some land in the corner of Queen's Road and Lynch Green, for it was feared that the rented site on which the chapel stood might be lost when the land was auctioned on the death of its owner. In fact, it proved to be an unnecessary precaution.\n\nOn 7 July 1920, the site including chapel with pitch-pine pews, gallery, platform and pulpit together with four cottages was purchased by the Methodists for £250. The notice of sale described it as a Wesleyan chapel. In fact, there had been no return to the Mother Church. In 1907 three break away connections had come together as the United Methodist Church. Together with the Primitives and the Wesleyans they were to amalgamate in 1932 to form the Methodist Church of Great Britain.\n\nThe previous chapel, which now forms the basis of the extended building of the 1980s, was built in 1922 at a cost of £1,814. The pulpit was made of native oak by C. W. Wiles and John Harvey and the wrought iron gates by C. L. Smith. The 50th anniversary services were held on 28 and 29 October 1972 and in February the following year there were other events to mark the completion and rededication of the Schoolroom rebuilding. This included storage facilities and a kitchen with classrooms above.\n\nIn 1981 numbers of worshippers were increasing and it was felt that the church needed some sort of extension. \"Operation New Look\" - the fund-raising venture - with grants from bodies in Methodism, and other gifts, raised £123,000 to finance the project.\nThe church as it is at present (1989) has been turned from north/south to east/west by removing the east wall and building on an extension to the worship area, a General Purposes Room (which can be added into the worship area), toilets, two entrance areas and a vestry. The old vestry and toilet area at the north end was included in the worship area.\n\nA balcony was created and the organ from the Chapel at Keswick Hall was brought in. The old pulpit was used to create a smaller pulpit and the lectern. The new apse on the west side forms the back of the sanctuary area and the communion rail and the communion table of oak were crafted by Edmund (Teddy) Forster of G. W. Gooch and Sons of Norwich who were the contractors for the alterations.\n\nThe pitch-pine pews were removed and chairs are now used in varying formations. The re-opening of the extended and modernised premises took place in October 1983. The premises provide not only for the Methodists of the village but for other groups too.\nGradually as the population of the village grew there was disquiet regarding the space available. The space had seemed so adequate in 1922 but its shoe box shape with narrow central aisle from narrow door to pulpit and organ, prohibited expansion at the entrance and circulation and cloakroom space were quite inadequate.\n\nMatters came to a head in 1970. Even before that date a detailed survey of the premises had made it clear that about £800 a year for the next five years would have to be spent to avoid deterioration. The result of further discussions showed that a radical solution was necessary.\nOn 1 April 1980 Kenneth James, a local architect, presented a report to a special meeting of the church council. Even minor modifications and improvements would cost £6,000. A more revolutionary scheme, involving enlargement to a capacity of 175, meant adding length and breadth to the existing church. This, it was said, would cost about £45,000. The meeting gave general approval, but referred the matter to the property committee for further discussion.\nOn 4 November the council approved a more detailed scheme. One side of the church would be extended into the car park, giving more circulation and cloakroom space and an extra meeting room. On the wall opposite would be the communion table, flanked by a pulpit and reading desk made from the existing large pulpit. The congregation would be seated in a semi-circle facing the table.\n\nA small gallery was to be provided for the organ. Later an anonymous donor was to present a fine instrument, made available on the closure of Keswick College of Education. Additional gifts of a wooden cross behind the table and an enlargement of the window looking out to the road added to the beauty of the building. As the work began, the amount of the appeal had to be raised to £70,000.\n\nWork started towards the end of 1982. On Saturday 19 March 1983 the stone laying took place. Stones were laid by Mr David Richardson in memory of his parents, who, over the years, had done so much for the church and by Mr Herbert Thrower and Miss Sian Evans to represent the older and younger members of the congregation.\n\nThe formal re-opening and dedication took place on Saturday 22 October 1983. This was performed by Mr Paul Bartlett Lang, Vice-President of the Methodist Conference. Others taking part were the Chairman of the East Anglian District, the Superintendent of the Norwich Circuit, two members of the congregation and of the minister, the Rev Brian Dann.\n\nBy this time the cost had risen to £126,000. It took four years to reach that target. Grants were obtained from charitable trusts such as the Joseph Rank Benevolent Trust. There were donations from the circuit and some of its churches. There was a loan from the Chapel Aid Department and also interest free loans from members and friends. Events were organised by the \"New Look\" Committee and individual and group efforts such as dinners, coffee mornings, sales of work (under various names) were just some of the ingenious means of raising money.\n\nHethersett has several schools. Hethersett Academy (formerly Hethersett High School) and Hethersett Junior School (formerly Hethersett Middle School) are located on Queens Road, with Hethersett First and Nursery (Woodside School) being located on Firs Road.\n\nThe village is also home to Hethersett Old Hall School, an independent school located on Norwich Road. It is a day school for girls aged 4–18 and for boys aged 4–11 and boarding school for girls aged 9–18.\n\nHethersett was named Active Norfolk Sports Village of the Year and Sports Champion of Champions in 2011. The village was also awarded a London 2012 Olympics Inspire Award for outstanding contribution in support of the games.\n\nA Hethersett and the Meltons Sports Association was set up in 2011 to oversee sport, fitness and well being in the villages of Hethersett, Little Melton and Great Melton. It meets quarterly.\n\nThere are sports clubs in the villages of Hethersett and the Meltons including:\n\n\nEach year the village organises an open come and try sports evening in conjunction with Active Norfolk. This is usually held in May. In addition Hethersett organises a Sport in the Park Event which gives local people the chance to try up to 20 different sports free of charge.\n\nHethersett was noted as having held more Olympic-themed events per capita than any other village, town or city in the United Kingdom. As a result of this, despite being bypassed by the torch route, the Olympic flame paid a special off-route visit to the village on Thursday 5 July before the Olympic Torch left Norwich. The Flame arrived at Hethersett High School at about 6.21am.\n\nHethersett was named Eastern Daily Press Pride in Norfolk Community of the Year for 2012 for villages and towns with populations over 5,000. The judges praised the village for its outstanding community spirit and \"can do\" attitude. The village won the same award in 2006. There was also praise at an award ceremony at Norfolk County Council for the village web site. In 2013 Hethersett became the first village or town in the United Kingdom to receive a Prime Minister's Big Society award.\n\nHethersett has also won a number of prestigious awards in the past 10 years. These include:\n\nA number of local residents have also won individual awards including: Mel Perkins (MBE for services to sport) and Peter Steward (South Norfolk Diamond Jubilee award for Inspiring Achievement). In 2012 Parish Councillor and Chairman of Hethersett Olympic Committee Shane Hull and organiser of the Hethersett Ducklings Playgroup Nicky Wardale were selected to run with the Olympic Torch in the lead up to the 2012 London Games. Village stalwart Duncan Pigg was awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) in the 2013 New Year's Honours to mark over 60 years of service to Hethersett.\n\nThe main road through the village was turnpiked in the middle of the 17th century. Three blacksmiths existed in the village in the 1880s and carriages were built at Harveys.\n\nThe village was formerly served by Hethersett railway station, but this was closed in 1966. Regular bus services operate between the village, Wymondham and Norwich. The village is also close to the Thickthorn Park and Ride.\n\nHethersett is home to several small to medium-size businesses that benefit from easy access to Norwich city centre. Two of the largest businesses in Hethersett are the Park Farm Hotel and television advertising production company the JMS Group.\n\nHethersett has many shops ranging from Tesco to Premier and from Boots to a post office.\n\nA Petroleum Storage Depot was built at Hethersett during World War Two for receiving fuel by rail and supplying RAF bases by road. It was connected to the Government Pipeline and Storage System in 1943/4. In 1980 a diesel pump-house was constructed and a pipeline built connecting it to RAF Coltishall. The depot had four 500-ton tanks, two 1,000-ton tanks and two 2,000-ton tanks. It was mothballed and emptied of fuel in the 2000s following the closure of RAF Coltishall, and later sold.\n\n"}

This order comprises 463 genera and about 3,000 species; its members are benthic copepods found throughout the world in the marine environment (most families) and in fresh water (essentially the Ameiridae, Parastenocarididae and the Canthocamptidae). A few of them are planktonic or live in association with other organisms. Harpacticoida represents the second-largest meiofaunal group in marine sediment milieu, after nematodes. In Arctic and Antarctic seas, Harpacticoida are common inhabitants of sea ice. The name Harpacticoida comes from the Greek noun \"harpacticon\" (rapacious predator) and the suffix \"-oid\" (akin to) and means \"reminiscent of a predator\" .\n\nHarpacticoids are distinguished from other copepods by the presence of only a very short pair of first antennae. The second pair of antennae are biramous, and the major joint within the body is located between the fourth and fifth body segments. They typically have a wide abdomen, and often have a somewhat worm-like body.\n\n65 families are currently recognised in the Harpacticoida:\n\n"}
{"id": "1995447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995447", "title": "Jimmy Sirrel", "text": "Jimmy Sirrel\n\nJames Sirrel (2 February 1922 – 25 September 2008) was a Scottish football player and manager; he gained his highest profile in the latter role.\n\nBorn in Glasgow, Sirrel began his career with Celtic before moving to England, spending most of his playing career with Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nStarting his management career in the Fourth Division with Brentford, Sirrel moved to Notts County where he achieved promotion to the Second Division, and then after a spell at Sheffield United returned to Notts County to achieve promotion to the First Division for the first time since 1926. He is regarded as a legend of the club, with the County Road Stand at Notts County's Meadow Lane named after him.\n\nBorn in Glasgow, Sirrel started his professional career at Celtic in 1946, but made just 13 appearances in three years before signing for Bradford Park Avenue in 1949, but again failed to get regular first team football, playing only 12 matches. In 1951 he joined Brighton & Hove Albion, where he made 55 appearances before signing for Aldershot in 1954. He retired from playing in 1957.\n\nSirrel moved to Brentford as trainer in February 1965, before accepting the job of caretaker manager in February 1967. After being appointed to the role full-time, he spent two full seasons at the helm of Brentford where the club finished in 14th and 11th-placed positions in the Fourth Division. The 1969-70 season started well for Brentford and by November they were mounting a decent challenge for automatic promotion to Division Three. However, at the beginning of that month it was announced that Sirrel would be leaving Griffin Park to join Notts County as their new manager.\n\nUpon taking his new position Sirrel said \"Ask any kid what he knows about Notts County and he'll tell you they're the oldest football team in the world. By the time I've finished he'll know a lot more,\" immediately endearing himself amongst Notts County supporters.\n\nFrom previous managers Jack Wheeler and Billy Gray, Sirrel had inherited a team including Don Masson, David Needham, Bob Worthington and Les Bradd, and his team would become increasingly difficult to beat. His first season in charge of the Magpies ended with a respectable seventh-place finish after several seasons of struggle on the pitch and financial woes off it.\n\nThe following season the Magpies stormed their way to the Fourth Division Championship. It would be the end of September before the Magpies would be beaten and the season would be completed without a single defeat at Meadow Lane. Sirrel built a solid defence, difficult to break down which would concede just 36 goals, while in front of goal, Sirrel built an equally impressive goalscoring side which would score an average of 2.47 goals per game.\n\nThe following season Notts excelled again, missing out on a second successive promotion by three points. Sirrel's status as a Notts County legend was fast becoming confirmed.\n\nThe 1972-73 season started off slowly for the Magpies and by the end of the year they were languishing in 16th place. However, Notts would lose just twice more all season and secure second place and promotion into the Second Division following a final day 4-1 victory over Tranmere Rovers.\n\nSirrel had overseen a transformation of Notts which had seen them go from Division Four strugglers to a Division Two side in little under four years. For the next two seasons, the Magpies would finish with respectable midtable positions and looked to be heading that way again during 1975-76. Sirrel however announced that he would leave Notts County for Sheffield United and was appointed their new manager on 21 October 1975, replacing Ken Furphy.\n\nThe Blades had suffered an awful start to their First Division season and were bottom having recorded just one win in 13 games up to Sirrel's appointment. Despite his best efforts, he was unable to motivate his players and the Blades would record just five more wins and finish the season relegated in bottom place.\n\nWith little money to spend, Sirrel was unable to stop the slide at Bramall Lane and the following season United finished 11th in the Second Division. The 1977-78 season started in similar fashion and on 27 September 1977, Sirrel left Bramall Lane with United struggling at the foot of the table. He returned to Notts County, who were also going through a hard time.\n\nSirrel is the designer of the present Sheffield United club badge. Up until Sirrel's tenure in charge at Bramall Lane, the Blades used Sheffield's coat of arms. This was until Sheffield City Council copyrighted it, forcing the Blades to look elsewhere for a badge. Sirrel sat down and designed the badge that is still used today.\n\nSirrel returned on 5 October 1977 and found a Magpies side struggling to avoid relegation back into Division Three. Sirrel was able to save Notts from the drop with the club eventually finishing in a respectable 15th place. The following season saw Notts record a 6th-placed finish but the season after that the Magpies struggled again, finishing in 17th place.\n\nThe 1980-81 season would go down as perhaps Sirrel's finest achievement as manager of Notts County. Including a new generation of players bought in by Sirrel and the returning Don Masson, the Magpies would finish the season in second place, and a 2-0 win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge confirmed that the Magpies would be playing First Division football for the first time since 1926.\n\nDespite being favourites to make an immediate return to the Second Division, some memorable wins ensured that the Magpies would finish comfortably in midtable in their first season back in the top flight.\n\nSirrel brought in Howard Wilkinson to be a head coach for Notts County's second season in the Division One. Sirrel continued on as General Manager and the club subsequently managed a comfortable 15th-placed finish.\n\nStaying on as General Manager, a new coach came in for the Magpies' third season of top flight football. Larry Lloyd had previously won silverware with Nottingham Forest. However, the Magpies' were relegated into Division Two at the end of the season. Lloyd was dismissed the following season with the Magpies staring a second consecutive relegation in the face and Sirrel was again appointed manager in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the drop.\n\nThe 1985-86 season began in the Third Division and with financial difficulty brewing, Sirrel would oversee two midtable finishes over the next seasons. His retirement as Notts County manager came at the end of the 1986-87 season, eighteen years after he arrived at the club. He then became chief scout for Derby County.\n\nIn 1993, the newly redeveloped County Road Stand at Notts County's Meadow Lane was renamed the Jimmy Sirrel Stand in his honour:\n\nApart from football, Sirrel was a keen gardener and enjoyed bowls.\n\nSirrel died aged 86 on 25 September 2008.\n\nSirrel was buried on 7 October 2008 as fans and great figures from the world of football alike turned out to pay their respects to the Magpies legend.\n\n"}

{"id": "1995452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995452", "title": "Cooum River", "text": "Cooum River\n\nThe Cooum river (also known as Thiruvallikenni river) is one of the shortest classified rivers draining into the Bay of Bengal. This river is about 72 km in length, flowing 32 km in the Urban part and the rest in rural part. The river is highly polluted in the urban area (Chennai). Along with the Adyar River running parallel to the south, the river trifurcates the city and separates Northern Chennai from Central Chennai.\n\nIts source is in a place by the 'kesavaram anaicut built across Kallar river in Vellore district adjoining Chennai district. From its origin in the kesavaram Village to Thandurai(Pattabiram) Anaikat, the river remains unpolluted. Beyond this, the river is highly polluted till its mouth in the Bay of Bengal. In Chennai district, the river flows through three corporation zones—Kilpauk, Nungambakkam and Triplicane—for a total length of .\n\nOwing to intensive use of surface water upstream for agriculture, indiscriminate pumping of groundwater leading to reduced base flow in the river, formation of sand bar at the mouth of the river, discharge of untreated sewage and industrial effluents and encroachment along the banks, the river, especially the downstream, has been highly polluted. In 2018 alone, about 21,665 tonnes of waste was removed from the river.\n\nThe Cooum was earlier known as the Triplicane river. The name of \"Cooum\" appears to be derived from Tamil literature. The name may have been derived from the Tamil term \"coopam\" meaning 'well' or 'deep pit'. The word \"coovalan\" denotes a person who is well versed in the science of ground water, well water and stagnant water.\n\nOnce this river was said to have its origin in Dharmapuri district, but now due to some earth table changes, it has shortened its course to Thiruvallur district. Ancient documents from the nearby temples states about one 'reaching salvation' on having a dip in the Cooum. The Cooum river was then clean and unpolluted.\n\nFor centuries, Cooum has been an integral part of the socio-economic and cultural life of the city. Till the early twentieth century, it was a clean river, most suitable for navigation. In ancient times, it played a pivotal part in the far-flung maritime trade between the Roman empire, South India and Sri Lanka. Cooum's proximity to the ancient port of Manarpha or Mylapore added to the river's strategic importance. Manarpha was frequented by Roman merchants who came here to buy Indian textiles, gemstones and spices. In return, India procured gold, silver, copper and high-quality wine from the Romans. Archaeologists have discovered ancient wine jars, Roman and Chinese coins on the banks of the river. In the late eighteenth century, Pachaiyappa Mudaliar, the renowned philanthropist, bathed in this river before offering prayers at the Komaleeswarar Temple in Komaleeswaranpet.\n\nCooum River and the nearby Elambore River (or North River), which flows into the Cooum at its mouth, were running very close to each other near the former Central Jail area opposite Chennai Central. During floods, both the watercourses inundated the whole area. In the 1700s, the two rivers were linked by a cut to equalise the floods in both the rivers and a bridge was constructed between these rivers in 1710 across the cut.\n\nPolluted part of the Cooum is presently spoiled by filth and pollution, and the water quality has considered to be highly toxic and completely non-potable. The 2004 tsunami cleaned the mouth of the river; however, the river returned to its usual polluted self within a short period. Anyhow, the Unpolluted Part is still being used for drinking water needs of many villages in the banks of the unpolluted part of the cooum river.\n\nThe Cooum River originates in a village of the same name in Tiruvallur district, about from Chennai, although starting its main course at Sattarai village, around from Chennai. Flowing through Poonamallee, it enters the Chennai District at Arumbakkam after meandering for about . It then passes through some of the oldest residential areas for another such as Choolaimedu, Chetpet, Egmore and Chintadripet, where the river channel is about wide. Close to Egmore, the river forks into two—the northern and the southern arms—both of which join again near the Napier bridge, thus forming an island, known as the Island Grounds. The northern part of the Buckingham Canal joins the Cooum near the old Central Jail while the southern part of the same canal emerges from the river, just behind the University of Madras campus. The river finally joins the Bay of Bengal south of the Fort St George, just below the Napier Bridge. Once a fresh water source, it is today a drainage course inside the city of Chennai, collecting surpluses of 75 small tanks of a minor basin. The total length of the river is about . The river flows to a length of in the Chennai Metropolitan Area, of which fall within the Chennai district limits. The total catchment area of the river is about , and the bed width ranges from . The capacity of the river is , and the anticipated flood discharge is around . Once a fishing river, it has borne the brunt of the city's unplanned explosion. The Kesavaram dam diverts the river into the Chembarambakkam Lake from which water is used for the supply of drinking water to the city of Chennai. Thereafter, the flow of water in the river is much reduced.\n\nThree ancient Shiva temples are located at the source of the river. The first is Tiruvirkolam, in Cooum village, and the other is at Ilambaiyankottur. The third is Thiruverkadu Shiva temple. Koyambedu temple is also in its banks. These temples have been featured in the Thevaram sung by the Saivite saint Thirugnana Sambandar. There is one more temple called the Veerebathrasami temple. The god in the temple is otherwise known as \"Akoramoorthy\". This temple is at Pillayarkuppam, from Cooum village. In ancient Tamil Nadu, under the Chola Empire, the river Cooum was referred to as \"Kashtabudhyotpathihi\". They all form a group of villages called \"padhinaru nattham\". The river drains into the Bay of Bengal at Chepauk in Chennai marking the northernmost boundary of the Marina Beach. The delta also marks the southern boundary of the Port of Chennai.\nThe width of the river course varies all along from , which includes the area occupied by the slums.\n\nThe major islet in the course of the river is the Island Grounds in Chennai less than a kilometre from the mouth. The river splits into two near Chinthadripet and encircles a piece of land isolating it from the surrounding land before draining into the eastern sea. However, the mouth of the river is not too wide and does not have any islet. The river mouth has groynes running to a total length of nearly . The opening between the groynes is about to facilitate tidal action. The impact of high tide bringing in sea water is felt for nearly in the river. At present, the river has to be periodically cleaned to prevent sand deposits near the river mouth, close to the Napier bridge, which are removed at frequent intervals using at least two machines to facilitate tidal action and avoid flooding. About of sand were removed in 2010–11.\n\nThe river basin spans an area of 505.88 square kilometers.\n\nThere are nine major bridges built over the river. These are the Napier Bridge, the Wallajah Bridge, the Periamet Bridge, the Chintradripet Bridge or the St Andrew's Bridge, Harris Bridge, Commander-in-Chief Road Bridge, College Road Bridge, Spur Tank Bridge and the Aminjikarai Bridge. Apart from these there are several smaller bridges built across the river. The Corporation of Chennai maintains about 13 of these bridges.\n\nA new bridge across the river connecting Golden George Nagar in Mogappair with Nerkundram is being constructed by the state highways department at a cost of 113 million. Work started in August 2010 and is expected to be completed by March 2013. The bridge with 10 spans measures about long and nearly wide, accommodating six-lane traffic, with space provisions for bicycles and pedestrians.\n\nAccording to scientists, around 1950, Cooum had 49 species of fish, and by the late 1970s, this was reduced to 21 species. However, on date, there are no fish in the river, owing to highly toxic pollutants found in the river water.\n\nThe river is narrow, placid, slow and meandering. The river is primarily fed by discharge from tank and water bodies and has seen a steady drop in freshwater over the years, a primary reason for its present-day condition. However, the core problem of the Cooum has been that due to the sand bar, the river mouth near the Napier Bridge gets blocked for most of the time, preventing the river water from draining into the sea. This has, eventually, made the river, in its 18-km-long stretch in the central district, a stinking cesspool.\n\nTests of water samples reveals almost zero dissolved oxygen and substantial presence of faecal coliform bacteria, besides heavy metals such as lead, zinc and cadmium.\n\nThe study of the river was undertaken as part of a World Bank-funded project and shows that it is 80 percent more polluted than treated sewer. Fish were able to survive in the water for only 3 to 5 hours even after samples were diluted. There are traces of heavy metals like copper and pesticides like endosulphan and lindane in it. Public Works Department sources said government agencies like Chennai Corporation and business units and retail outlets on the banks of the river were responsible for the pollution. The water has almost no dissolved oxygen, and instead there are traces of heavy metals like copper, besides sewage and sludge. Due to its narrowness and about 3,500 illegal hutments along its banks, it has not been recently desilted, which has closed it to river traffic. Per 2003 enumeration, about 9,000 families live along the river, in addition to 450 shops and commercial buildings. There are 700-odd points in the river bank where sewage flows straight into the river. There are 127 identified sewage outfalls into the river, out of which 85 are in use.\n\nNearly 30 per cent of the estimated of untreated sewage being let into the waterways of Chennai daily, including by Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, gets into the Cooum river. About 60 per cent of the untreated sewage gets into the Buckingham Canal and the Adyar River takes the rest. In 2010, about 340 sewage outfalls into the waterways were identified. Of them, more than 130 sewage outfalls were in the Cooum River and a majority of them were between Aminjikarai and Nungambakkam. In some of the spots in areas such as Maduravoyal, more than 7 tonnes of municipal solid waste is being dumped in the river every day.\n\nFortunately, there is another 42 km of this river which is still not polluted (as of the year 2015), which can be used to transport the water into Chennai and to store drinking water for Chennai's needs. There is huge amount of sand deposits in the banks of the unpolluted part of the cooum river that could rejuvenate the ground water level of numerous villages in the banks of this river.\n\nAccording to the records available with the state public department, efforts to restore the waterway first began back in 1872 under the British. The earliest recorded proposal was mooted in 1890. After Independence, the then chief minister C. N. Annadurai launched a Cooum Improvement Scheme at a cost of 19 million in September 1967, six months after the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party came to power for the first time in the state, when M. Karunanidhi was PWD minister. The project comprised installation of a regulator and a sand pump at the river mouth, protecting the sides of the river with cement concrete slabs from the Chetput bridge to the Napier Bridge, provision of a walkway on either side of the river, removal of encroachments on the banks of the river and, more importantly, the diversion of sewage. In addition, seven boat jetties were built. In February 1973, when Karunanidhi was chief minister, he launched a pleasure boat service at a cost of 22 million, and roving boats, powered boats and paddle boats were made available at a nominal charge. However, the efforts went futile when the sand pump developed snags. Incidentally, the jetties built for the purpose still dot the riverfront.\n\nIn 1996, when the DMK returned to power, the government made another bid—this time covering all important watercourses, including the Buckingham Canal and the Adyar. This resulted in the implementation of the 12,000-million Chennai City River Conservation Project (CCRCP) in January 2001, which was substantially supported by the Union Environment and Forests Ministry. This time, the new project aimed at arresting the sewage outfalls and strengthening the sewer network. However, this too did not yield the desired results since the project did not cover Tiruvallur district, which accounts for of the river stretch.\n\nAfter the DMK took charge again in May 2006, the eco-restoration of the Cooum again came to the fore. To facilitate the implementation of the project, the Chennai River Authority, headed by the Deputy Chief Minister, was formed in December 2009 to clean up the entire stretch of the river within 10 years. This aimed at coordinating the implementation of various projects.\n\nIn 2010, the Tamil Nadu government signed an MoU with Singapore Cooperation Enterprise (SEC), a Singapore agency for the restoration project. The agency prepared a preliminary report after discussions with various stake holders of the project including Chennai Corporation, municipal administrations, Metrowater, Pollution Control Board, Slum Clearance Board and the public works department.\n\nThere is currently the World Bank–funded Irrigated Agriculture Modernisation and Water Bodies Restoration and Management Project to clean up the river, under which the upper reaches of the river are proposed to be covered. The World Bank has approved 224.1 million for the Cooum restoration project towards development of its irrigation potential. Improving the irrigation efficiency of Cooum upstream is one of the main objectives of the project. The upper region of the river, mainly Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur districts, will be benefiting from this special fund.\n\nA team from Chennai has visited San Antonio in Texas to see how they successfully did the clean-up of a polluted river. The team comprised former Deputy Chief Minister M. K. Stalin, former Chennai Mayor M. Subramaniam and other senior officers. One of the city's dream projects is to clean up this river on or before 2020. The initiative has been taken up by the Central and State governments to clean up the river and rediscover the pleasures of traditional boat racing. The Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust (CRRT) has asked the Chennai Corporation to chalk out an action plan to remove construction debris dumped on the banks of the river.\n\nThe Water Resources Department (WRD) started flushing a stretch of the Cooum in December 2010, initially discharging about of surplus water from the Poondi reservoir into the river.\n\nIn September 2011, the WRD began cleaning the river at a cost of 10.2 million and the work is expected to be completed within a fortnight.\n\nIn 2012, the government allotted 3,000 million towards construction of 337 sewage cleaning systems in the waterways in the city, including 105 locations in the Cooum river. Others include 49 points in Adyar river and 183 locations in the Buckingham Canal.\n\nA visitor centre near the mouth of the river on the Marina Beach, similar to the Marina Barrage Visitor Centre in Singapore and San Antonio Visitor Center in the United States, has been planned as part of an initiative to create awareness of the need for clean waterways.\n\nIn 2011, the Tamil Nadu Sailing Association planned to build a marina at the mouth of the Cooum river along the southern bank, where yachts and pleasure boats could dock. The 300-million project involves first building a breakwater in the sea so that the waters at the marina are placid and the boats do not keep bobbing up and down with the incursion of waves. However, the by-catch is a more important function—the breakwater will prevent silting and clogging of the mouthect, such as a boat repair facility, a base for the Tamil Nadu Coastal Police, and sailing academy, will be put up on the bank. By 2013, the estimate for the setting up of a sailing centre and marina to accommodate 24 yachts has increased to 450 million.\n\nA nature trail along the river has been proposed for which a draft ecological plan has been prepared by the Tamil Nadu Urban Infrastructure and Financial Services Limited (TNUIFSL). The project is planned from College Road bridge to Chetpet bridge by the Chennai River Restoration Trust in view of the biological diversity of the area which was undisturbed for decades. According to the draft ecological plan, floral species such as Indian almond, black wattle, sacred fig, madras thorn, Indian mulberry, neem, banyan, \"magizham\", Indian cork tree, \"punnai\", \"sirukkambil\", \"karumugai\", \"shenbagam\", bayur tree, \"kadamba\", \"pavazha malli\", vetiver grass, palmorasa, agave, lemon grass and subabul would be part of species along the nature trail which would play a role in erosion management. The nature trail would be based on an \"elevated boardwalk\" model with \"uncompressed natural wood\" and \"fibre reinforced plastic\". The entry and exit would be on College Road near the DPI complex. Apart from the parking facilities on the DPI premises, a stretch along the road between the entry point and the College Road Bridge would be demarcated for additional parking. Five points located at intervals along the trail have been selected for erecting break-out areas including one for a canopy walk. The facility has been planned without electrical fittings and has been designed as a \"day trail\".\n\nIt is proposed that Chennai Metro rails are to be built about under the bed of the river. The line that comes from the Madras High Court area reaches the metro's Central station in front of Ripon Building, crosses the river and passes underneath the neighbourhoods of Chintadripet to reach the underground station at the new secretariat on Anna Salai. The tunnels for the metro rail are to be made without cutting open the ground, with giant machines boring the tunnels as the river flows above. Custom-made tunnel boring machines costing 600 million each have been imported from Germany for the purpose.\n\nKey aspects of the Cooum river eco-restoration plan includes 11 maintenance ways of 9.6 km, 22 walkways of 24 km, and 17 cycle tracks of 19 km, in addition to 24 parks and riverfront vegetation. The total budget for the eco-restoration is 19,340 million.\n\nAs part of the eco-restoration, in July 2018, the Corporation began work on the 1.5-km nature trail between the College Road bridge in Nungambakkam and the Munroe bridge in Chetput. Modelled on the San Antonio River Walk in the United States, the trail is being built in two phases at a cost of 98.2 million and includes a butterfly park in a 5000 square meter area.

She was, for more than a decade, engaged with Berlin's Volksbühne. When she accepted the starring role in the highly popular film \"Love, Death and the Devil\" (1934), a new star was born with the \"Leitmotif\" song \"So oder so ist das Leben\".\n\nHorney was a good friend of the actor Joachim Gottschalk and appeared in four films with him.

{"id": "1995457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995457", "title": "Sixty Watt Shaman", "text": "Sixty Watt Shaman\n\nSixty Watt Shaman is an American rock band known for incorporating hard rock with blues, southern rock, doom rock, punk rock and metal influences, originally based out of Eldersburg, Baltimore County, Montgomery County, and Montgomery Village, Maryland. The band play a diverse repertoire of hard hitting groove rock and ethereal psychedelic jams, with classic tube tones, echoing heavy blues, southern groove, doom, and even the ghostly spirit of historic Americana and Appalachian bluegrass. They formed in 1996 and recorded and released their first studio album in 1998. The band last recorded in 2002. The last official band tour was in late 2002 through January 2003; but, have made several reunion appearances since, including Desertfest Berlin and Desertfest London in 2014. The band continues efforts focused on festival events in the US and Europe, and in 2017 are writing and recording new music for release. They are widely regarded as innovators in their musical genre with the \"Sixty Watt\" sound, and have been both imitated and replicated by peers and bands who followed in their footsteps.\n\nSixty Watt Shaman was formed in 1996 by lead singer/rhythm guitarist, Daniel Soren, lead guitarist, Joe Selby, and drummer, Chuck Dukehart, bringing in bass player, Jim Forrester, when Joe Selby moved from bass to guitar to form the new project. The band name derives from a split reference to Jim Morrison and an infamous amplifier once played by Jimi Hendrix. The band name was dubbed by vocalist, Dan Soren (known earlier by middle name, Kerzwick), in early September 1996, upon his return from European travel where he had visited the grave of Jim Morrison who is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France. Jim Morrison was called the \"electric shaman\" by press and popular culture during his Doors years. The reference to \"Sixty Watt\" refers to an amplifier that was built specifically for Jimi Hendrix by the pioneering amplifier manufacturer Jim Marshall; it was a special sixty watt amplifier which was used during live performances and on the \"Electric Ladyland\" album, but was alleged to have been stolen and never recovered after Hendrix's Isle of Wight Festival performance.\n\nThe band's debut album, \"Ultra Electric\", was recorded in two 24-hour sessions at Hound Studio in Baltimore, MD. The session were produced by Sixty Watt Shaman and engineered by Frank Marchand in 1998 and released on the independent label Game Two Records. Also recorded, studio outtake track \"Red Colony\", was released on the \"Welcome to MeteorCity\" (MeteorCity) Compilation, marked as a ground breaking release for its showcase of up and coming heavy rock bands. Soon after, the band also recorded two tracks with Baltimore Producer/Engineer Jon Smulyan with a mobile unit at The Regal Beagle rehearsal studio the band had built in the loft of an early 20th century barn, at an artists colony in Reisterstown, MD. One track, \"Whiskey Neck\", was released on another seminal compilation, \"In the Groove\" by NY's Musical Cartel Records. \n\nAfter these releases, Sixty Watt embarked on a US tour, from Maine to Texas, with California band Nebula, while Nebula supported their recently released Let It Burn EP as their first release following their departure from Fu Manchu in 1997. In 1999 NY's TEE PEE records released a now very rare split 7\" with Maryland's Spirit Caravan featuring the track \"Stone's Throw Away\" from the Regal Beagle sessions. During this time period (1998/1999), the band had developed a friendship with members of fellow Maryland-based rock band Clutch, after playing shows with their side-project The Bakerton Group, whose drummer, Jean-Paul Gaster, would later be recruited to produce their next album \"Seed of Decades\".\n\nIn the late 1990s the band worked tirelessly to play shows all along the East Coast with bands in and outside of their scene, including Solace, Atomic Bitchwax, Nothingface, Alabama Thunderpussy, Spirit Caravan, Unorthodox, Internal Void, Karma to Burn, Clutch and many others. They toured nationwide with Nebula and Spirit Caravan during that time period. After playing several shows in New York City and developing buzz about the band, Sixty Watt landed a showcase for Spitfire Records President, Paul Bibeau, at the Continental in the late summer of 1999. Bibeau offered Sixty Watt Shaman a recording contract in the downstairs backstage room immediately after their performance. Two weeks earlier, Sixty Watt had played a show at the same venue where Frank Kozik (of Man's Ruin Records fame, as well as fame for his album-cover art, concert flyer art, and directing music videos for Soundgarden and Mint Condition) had been in the audience; Kozik approached the band about an album deal following that show. Sixty Watt was extremely excited to have the honor to work with Kozik; but, with the approach by Bibeau only 14 days later, with a more extensive offer (a multi-album deal, including tour support, wide US and European distribution, PR and album support), Sixty Watt Shaman opted to go with Spitfire Records.\n\nWith one release behind them, in 1999 the band were signed by Spitfire Records and released Seed of Decades in 2000. \"Seed of Decades\" has been compared to the 1970s hard rock sound of Aerosmith and Grand Funk Railroad \"with a more modern harder edge\". The band toured with label-mates Black Label Society and Crowbar in support of the album in the summer of 2000, and then later with Clutch and Corrosion of Conformity.\n\nFor their 2002 release, Reason to Live, Dukehart was let go from the band and was replaced by drummer, \"Minnesota\" Pete Campbell, who went on later to play with other acts, such as Pentagram. Former Kyuss bassist, Scott Reeder, was recruited to work on production for this album. It was recorded at Phase Studios in College Park, MD in 28 days. The album reveals the strong influence of the heavy music and the musicians that Sixty Watt had been on tours with over the previous two years. Reason to Live features many standout tracks including \"All Things Come to Pass\" which features Sixty Watt Shaman and guest performers Scott Reeder (Kyuss, The Obsessed) and Scott \"Wino\" Weinrich (The Obsessed, Saint Vitus) who were brought together again after having played together years earlier in The Obsessed for this live jam performance.\n\nBefore the release of \"Reason to Live\", Sixty Watt Shaman toured Europe with Karma to Burn, playing with many of their European contemporaries such as Dozer. After the release, they embarked on a full US tour with Alabama Thunderpussy and dates with Clutch that culminated in a final tour date at their hometown venue, 9:30 Club, Washington D.C. on January 4, 2003. After the end of that US tour, lead singer, Daniel Soren, moved to the mid-west and worked on other projects including The Mighty Nimbus with Pete Campbell; and, also, a project out of Norman, Oklahoma with Chris \"Paco\" Johnson and Forrest Smith, playing shows in Norman and Oklahoma City. Jim Forrester worked on other projects including The Devil You Know, Angels of Meth, Soaphammer and others. Upon his return to Maryland from Oklahoma, Dan Soren rejoined Joe Selby in another rock project, Stillhouse. Dukehart went on to form Baltimore-based The Expotentials and later Foghound. Over the years, band members have continued to work both separately and together on various projects reunions, since the inception of Sixty Watt Shaman. They have made reunion appearances including one-off shows with Angels of Meth and Stillhouse in Cincinnati, OH, a festival event April 28, 2007 at The Ottobar in Baltimore, MD, Desertfest dates in 2014 (Desertfest Berlin, Desertfest London), The Eye of the Stoned Goat IV Festival, shows in Boston, MA, Baltimore, MD, and The Feast of Krampus Festivals in Philadelphia, PA and Brooklyn (NYC). \n\nFollowing these handful of dates in 2014 and early 2015, lead singer, Daniel Soren, reformed the line-up to include Johnny Wretched (John Koutsioukis), on bass guitar, and longstanding hometown heavy rock drummer, Sandy Hinden. With the new line-up, Sixty Watt Shaman continued to write and record new material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was one of the most influential Croatian female politicians during the communist period, especially during the Croatian Spring when she was deposed. She returned to politics during the early days of Croatian independence as the leader of the Coalition of People's Accord and the Croatian People's Party. From 1967 to 1969 she served as the Chairman of the 5th Executive Council (Prime Minister) of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, one of eight constituent republics and autonomous provinces of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia. She was the first woman in Europe to be appointed head of government of a political entity and the first female in the post-World War II Croatia to hold an office equivalent to a head of government.\n\nSavka Dabčević was born in Korčula, then in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, today in Croatia, to the notable Croatian family of Dabčević, originally from Boka Kotorska. During World War II, she was a partisan, until 1943 when she went to El Shatt as refugee. After the war she studied economics at Zagreb university. She married Ante Kučar in 1951.\n\nDabčević-Kučar came into the public spotlight in the late 1960s as a member of a younger and more reformist generation of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia leaders. With the tacit blessing of Josip Broz Tito, she and Miko Tripalo became the leaders of the League of Communists of Croatia. In 1967 she became the President of the Executive Council (Prime Minister) of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, a constituent republic of SFR Yugoslavia, giving her the distinction of being the first female head of government of a political entity in Europe.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the party adopted a new course demanding greater autonomy for Croatia within Yugoslavia and freedoms for the people. Her policy, propagated through mass rallies, became a movement later called the Croatian Spring, being one of the '68 student revolutions. Consequently, Dabčević-Kučar became one of the most popular political leaders at the time, being affectionately called \"Savka, queen of Croatians\".\n\nNot everyone was happy with the new course. Open manifestations of Croatian nationalism created tensions in ethnically mixed areas, which served as an argument for the Yugoslav People's Army and more conservative elements of the party who wanted the movement suppressed. At the same time, the Croatian leadership was also challenged by a student movement with even more radical demands.\n\nIn December 1971 Tito held a party leadership conference in Karađorđevo, Serbia, and publicly turned against the Croatian Spring in the form of \"comradely critic\", (an internal communist way to openly criticize its party members when they, according to majority opinion, do not follow \"the party line\"). This led to Dabčević-Kučar's response to the critic, (published in newspapers during December) in which she accepted all criticism except those intended to show her as nationalist, and enemy of the socialist self-governing system, to which she publicly expressed loyalty. She resigned from the Central Committee of the Croatian Communist Party and, ultimately, from public life. She was replaced by Milka Planinc.\n\nWhen multi-party democracy finally arrived in Croatia, Dabčević-Kučar and Tripalo returned to the public stage, using their long-accumulated reputation. They refused to endorse a single party, and instead initiated the formation of a broad coalition of the moderate middle, called the Coalition of People's Accord. The coalition failed to make a major impact at the 1990 elections, with most opting for Franjo Tuđman and his Croatian Democratic Union party.\n\nWith the coalition falling apart, Dabčević-Kučar and Tripalo formed their own party, the Croatian People's Party (HNS), in late 1990. This new party was intended to attract moderates and had high hopes for the 1992 presidential and parliamentary elections, being perceived as the strongest opposition party in Croatia.\n\nAs a presidential candidate Savka Dabčević trailed third behind Dražen Budiša. The HNS refused to form coalitions with other opposition parties, allowing the ruling Croatian Democratic Union to win some constituencies with less than fifth of all votes. With the party humiliated, and nearly bankrupt after a lavish but ineffective campaign, the aging Dabčević-Kučar left the party leadership to the younger Radimir Čačić.\n\nShe died in Zagreb at the age of 85. She was an agnostic.\n"}

This followed the resignation of Maurice Saatchi from the advertising agency group Saatchi & Saatchi which he had founded with his brother Charles in 1970. The Group is listed on the AIM Board of the London Stock Exchange.\n\nIn December 1994 the board of Saatchi & Saatchi succumbed to sustained pressure from shareholder representative David Herro of Harris Associates L.P. and moved to remove its chairman, Maurice Saatchi. Maurice subsequently resigned. \nWithin a month, senior executives Jeremy Sinclair, Bill Muirhead, David Kershaw also resigned and decided to open their own agency. They were subsequently joined by Maurice and Charles Saatchi to create new business which would become known as M&C Saatchi. A number of Saatchi and Saatchi's London management and creative staff also joined and then some consequential clients soon followed including Gallaher Group, Mirror Newspapers, the retailer Dixons and after a competitive pitch, British Airways and its part subsidiary Qantas as well as the Conservative Party, for whom they made the infamous New Labour, New Danger adverts. In 2015, the agency was behind the Tory election campaign posters, picturing Ed Miliband in Alex Salmond's pocket.\n\nA network was initially established in-line with the office locations required by British Airways and Qantas. By early 1996 the network consisted of offices in London, Singapore, Hong Kong, Sydney, New York and Auckland.\n\nIn 2012 the network opened its 27th office in Stockholm, having previously opened offices in Abu Dhabi (2012), Cape Town and Johannesburg (2010), Milan (2010), Beirut (2010), Beijing (2010), Tokyo (2009), São Paulo (2008), Geneva (2008), Mumbai (2007), New Delhi (2006), Paris (2005), Bahrain (2005), Madrid (2005), Berlin (2005), Kuala Lumpur (2003), Shanghai (2000), Wellington (1999), Los Angeles (1999), Melbourne (1997).\n\nBy 2012 the Group also owned the UK based businesses Walker Media (a media buying agency) and Clear Ideas (a strategic brand consultancy). Operations in Riyadh, Dubai, Suva, Taipei, Bangkok and earlier attempts in Tokyo and Johannesburg had also started and failed during the fifteen-year period between 1995 and 2010.\n\nThe initial principal shareholders in M&C Saatchi were Maurice and Charles Saatchi and their founding partners Muirhead, Sinclair, and Kershaw – collectively known as \"the Partners\". They generally held 80% of each office while local management held the remaining 20%. M&C Saatchi remained an independent business until 2004, when all of its worldwide shareholders agreed to float 49% of the agency on the Alternative Investment Market, a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange. In October 2006, \"Marketing Week\" announced that Charles Saatchi had divested his 7% stake in M&C Saatchi PLC. Charles had had little active involvement in the running of the agency for a number of years.\n\nLimited acquired 49% of their fashion business from the group in 2010 and M&C Saatchi Agency Pty Ltd in Australia bought back 20% of theirs. The following subsidiaries were acquired throughout the 2010 year: M&C Saatchi Mobile Ltd, M&C Saatchi One SAS, The Source Ltd, M&C Saatchi Abel Ltd in South Africa, and M&C Saatchi SPA.\n\nThe group bought a 25% stake in the online media intelligence agency Human Digital in March 2011 and in January 2013, the firm took a 60% stake in Merlin Elite, a talent management agency, which was renamed as M&C Saatchi Merlin. In April 2017, the firm acquired a 51% stake in M&C Saatchi Sponsorship, based in Madrid. Then in June 2018, M&C Saatchi partnered with gambling charity, GambleAware, to create a safer gambling campaign. In July 2018, the group acquired Red Hare Digital & Grey Whippet to form M&C Saatchi Social leading to the creation of the M&C Saatchi Talent Group.\n\nFollowing the March 2019 departure of long-standing PLC CFO Jamie Hewitt, the team reporting to Hewitt's replacement Mickey Kalifa discovered some accounting irregularities. Problems included the timing of revenue recognition (early recognition of revenue for projects not fully completed) and incorrect accounting of some assets (capitalising items which ought to have been expensed/written off). The issues were brought to the attention of PLC CEO David Kershaw and on 12 August 2019 there was a market announcement to the City that charges of £6.4M in total quantum would be booked in the 2019 year and which related to either 2018 or 2019. PricewaterhouseCoopers were appointed as independent advisors to undertake a review and confirm the findings. On 4 December 2019 the Board announced the total charges would in fact be £11.6M. In PWC's review they found that similar practices had potentially been taking place since 2014. The company's original auditor KPMG resigned from its role earlier in 2019 after raising concerns about the 2018 annual report.\n\nWhen advising the City in December 2019 of the reality of the accounting transgressions, the company also advised the market of a weakening in its fourth quarter 2019 trading results which would be down 22% to 27% on expectations. M&C Saatchi PLC shares had hit a high of £4 in late 2018, were trading at 339p prior to the August 2019 announcement which caused them to drop to 256p. The loss of the company's longstanding client NatWest Bank in November 2019 had seen the shares drop to 148p. The December 2019 advices sent the share prices crashing to 79p and below the listing price of the company's 2004 float.\n\nIn a shock announcement to the City on 10 December Lord Saatchi resigned as an executive director along with all three of the independent non-executive directors Sir Michael Peat, Michael Dobbs, and Lorna Tilbian. It was reported that the departing directors disagreed over whether Kershaw should stay as CEO following the accounting scandal. Sinclair, Muirhead, and Kershaw supported the view of the company's advisers Numis who persuaded Kershaw to stay to avoid further instability.\n\nIn a subsequent blow it was reported that the agency's client, the Financial Conduct Authority – Britain's financial watchdog, issued a formal request for information from the company in an examination of how M&C Saatchi had disclosed the accounting problems which prompted the share price to tumble.\n\n"}

It is one of the largest lowland raised bogs in Northern Ireland. \n\nThe raised bog which covers most of the site contains characteristic vegetation and structural features associated with this type of habitat such as bog pools and hummocks. The raised bog dome is surrounded by cut-over bog with poor fen and birch woodland.\n\nPeat found here was made by decayed branches and leaves of trees and plants. The extraction of this peat was first made by the UPW. Locals who were against the extraction set up the FFB in 1990. In the end the area was declared an Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI) after successful petitioning by the FFB and Friends of the Earth.\n\nThe bog vegetation features a high percentage cover of sphagnum mosses, ericoid dwarf-shrubs such as cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix and heather Calluna vulgaris, and other associated species such as hare's-tail cottongrass\nEriophorum vaginatum, common cottongrass Eriophorum angustifolium, deergrass \"Trichophorum cespitosum\" and sundew species \"Drosera\". Additional species, also well represented within the bog include Bog Asphodel Narthecium ossifragum and White Beak-sedge Rhynchospora alba, with occasional patches of Bog-myrtle Myrica gale also occurring.\n\nThe Ballynahone Bog Ramsar site (wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention), is 243.24 hectares in area, at Latitude 54 49 25 N and Longitude 06 39 40 W. It was designated a Ramsar site on 31 December 1998. The site qualifies under criterion 1a of the Ramsar Convention by being a particularly good representative example of lowland raised bog. It is one of the two largest intact active bogs in Northern Ireland with hummock and hollow pool complexes and represents one of the best examples of this habitat type in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1979 a producer of peat for horticulture opened a factory (with government aid) and leased two bogs in the townland of Ballynahone More. In 1987 there was an application for planning permission to extract peat by milling from Ballynahone, Mullagh and Knocnakielt. In 1988, despite objections raised against the scheme, the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland granted Planning Permission to the company. \n\nIn 1990 the Ulster Wildlife Trust sent out a Press release inviting members to \"... take their last walk on an Ulster Bog - now that the fight to retain its ancient flora and fauna has been lost\". This walk drew in people from the surrounding area, a public meeting was held and the Friends of the Ballynahone Bog (FBB) were launched. In 1991 the peat development company dug 13 miles of drains on the southern half of Ballynahone Bog threatening the plants of the raised bog. In 1993 FBB started the process of declaring Ballynahone Bog a National Nature Reserve. After pressure from Professor David Bellamy and Friends of the Earth, planning permission was revoked and the government announced their intention of declaring the bog an Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI). \n\nIn December 1993, the peat company dammed the drains it had cut in the bog with about 1700 dams helping to maintain the height of the water table. In January 1995 Ballynahone Bog was declared an ASSI by the Environment and Heritage Service. FBB are now in partnership with the Ulster Wildlife Trust to try to reverse the damage done to the bog in order to encourage the revival of the specialized bog plants, such as the sundew, and the wildlife such as insects and birds which depend upon them. \n\n\nCrory, Andrew. 2016.

They released two full-length albums and an EP, as well as appearing on a number of compilations. The band also made two European tours in support of each album, playing in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Switzerland and Belgium.\n\nThe Mushroom River Band was formed by guitarist Anders Linusson, bass player Alexander \"Saso\" Sekulovski and drummer Andreas Grafenauer in 1996. This line-up recorded one demo tape with Christian \"Spice\" Sjöstrand from Spiritual Beggars as a guest vocalist. This demo was produced in small numbers and the band broke up as members went in different directions. In 1997, Linusson and Sekulovski decided to reform the band and recruited 16-year-old Chris Rockström on drums. Also, Spice now joined as a full-time singer. In January 1998 the band entered Soundscape Studio in Halmstad to record what would later become the \"Rocketcrash\" EP. This EP was released in 1999 on 10\" vinyl on the band's own Tea Pot label. Later in 1999 the band recorded a second demo entitled the \"No Quarter Recordings\". These recordings led to the band landing gigs outside their local region, but performing became increasingly difficult as Spice attempted to juggle duties in both The Mushroom River Band and Spiritual Beggars. In 2000 the band signed to MeteorCity and released their first full-length album, \"Music for the World Beyond\", the same year. Following this album the band performed only a few shows, again due to Spice's engagement in Spiritual Beggars. However, in 2001 the band went out on their first European tour in support of the album. Later in the year Spice left Spiritual Beggars to concentrate solely on The Mushroom River Band. The band's second and final album, \"Simsalabim\", was released in 2002. Following the recording of this album Rockström left the band. Robert Hansson was recruited to fill in on drums for the ensuing European tour. After the tour The Mushroom River Band was put on hiatus and the following year Spice left the band. The band decided to break up in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\"Sincerely Yours\" on \"Tungt Svenskt\", 2 x 7\" vinyl (2004 Game Two Records) - with Generous Maria, Rise and Shine & Space Probe Taurus\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1995486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995486", "title": "Birth weight", "text": "Birth weight\n\nBirth weight is the body weight of a baby at its birth. The average birth weight in babies of European heritage is , though the range of normal is between . Babies of south Asian and Chinese heritage weigh about \"less\". The birth weight of a baby is notable because very low birth weight babies are 100 times more likely to die compared to normal birth weight babies. As far as low birth weights prevalence rates changing over time, there has been a slight decrease from 7.9% (1970) to 6.8% (1980), then a slight increase to 8.3% (2006), to current levels of 8.2% (2016). The prevalence of low birth weight has trended slightly upward from 2012 to present day.\n\nThere have been numerous studies that have attempted, with varying degrees of success, to show links between birth weight and later-life conditions, including diabetes, obesity, tobacco smoking, and intelligence. Low birth weight is associated with neonatal infection and infant mortality.\n\n\nThere are two genetic loci that have been strongly linked to birth weight, ADCY5 and CCNL1, as well four that show some evidence (CDKAL1, HHEX-IDE, GCK, and TCF7L2). The heritability of birth weight ranges from 25-40 %. There is a complex relationship between a baby's genes and the maternal environment that the child is developing in. Foetal genes influence how the fetus grows in utero, and the maternal genes influence how the environment affects the growing fetus.\n\nThe health of the mother during the pregnancy can affect birth weight. Intercurrent diseases in pregnancy are sometimes associated with decreased birth weight. For example, celiac disease confers an odds ratio of low birth weight of approximately 1.8. Certain medications (e.g. for high blood pressure or epilepsy) can put a mother at a higher risk for delivering a low birth weight baby. Women younger than 15 or older than 35 are at a higher risk to have a low-birth weight baby. Multiple births, where a mother has more than one child at one time, can also be a determinant in birth weight as each baby is likely to be outside the AGA (appropriate for gestational age). Multiple births put children at a higher rate to have low birth weight (56.6%) compared to children born in a single birth ( 6.2%). Low birth weight can also vary by maternal age. In 2008 the rate of low birth weight was the highest in babies born to women younger than 15 years old (12.4%). Women aged 40–54 had a rate of low birth weight at 11.8 percent. The lowest rates of low birth weight happened among babies whose mothers were between the ages of 25–29 years (4.4%) and 30–34 years (7.6%).\n\nStressful events have been demonstrated to produce significant effects on birth weight. Those mothers who have stressful events during pregnancy, especially during the first and second trimester, are at higher risk to deliver low-birth weight babies. Researchers furthered this study and found that maternal stressful events that occur prior to conception have a negative impact on birth weight as well, and can result in a higher risk for preterm and lower birth weight babies. Women who experienced abuse (physical, sexual, or emotional) during pregnancy are also at increased risk of delivering a low-birth weight baby. For example, in a study completed by Witt et. al, those women who experienced a stressful event (ie. death of close family member, infertility issues, separation from partner) prior to conception had 38% more of a chance to have a very low birth weight baby compared to those who had not experienced a stressful life event. The theory is that stress can impact a baby based on two different mechanisms: neuroendocrine pathway or immune/inflammatory pathway. Stress causes the body to produce stress hormones called glucocorticoids that can suppress the immune system., as well as raises levels of placental corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) which can lead to preterm labor. These findings can pose evidence for future prevention efforts for low birth weight babies. One way to decrease rates of low birth weight and premature delivery is to focus on the health of women prior to conception through reproductive education, screening and counseling regarding mental health issues and stress, and access to primary care.\n\nNon-Hispanic Blacks have the highest infant mortality rate in the United States (11.4 deaths per 1,000 live births compared to the national average of 5.9 deaths per 1,000 live births). Subsequently, there has been growing research supporting the idea of racial discrimination as a risk factor for low birth weight. In one study by Collins et. al, evidence suggested that African American mothers who experienced high levels of racial discrimination were at significantly higher risk of delivering a very low-birth weight baby compared to African American mothers who had not experienced racial discrimination. Black infants (13.2%) are more likely to have low birth weight compared to Asian and Pacific Islander (8.1%), American Indian and Alaska Native (7.6%), Non-Hispanic White (7.0%), and Hispanic Infants (7.1%).\n\nEnvironmental factors, including exposure of the mother to secondhand smoke can be a factor in determining the birth weight of child. In 2014, 13% of children exposed to smoke were born with low birth weight compared with 7.5% of those children born to nonsmokers. Children born to mothers who smoked or were exposed to secondhand smoke are more likely to develop health problems earlier in life such as neurodevelopmental delays. When mothers actively smoke during pregnancy, their child is at a higher risk of being born with a low birth weight. Smoking can also be a stress management tool used by expecting mothers. There is some support for lower socioeconomic status of the parents being a determinant of low birth weight, but there is conflicting evidence, as socioeconomic status is tied to many other factors.\n\nMost babies admitted to the NICU are born before 37 weeks of pregnancy or have low birth weight which is less than 5.5 pounds. They could also have a medical condition that requires special care. In the United States nearly half a million babies are born preterm. Because of this, many of these babies also have low birth weights. There are four levels of care in the neonatal care units. Intensive Care, High Dependency Care, Low Dependency, and Transitional Care are the four levels:\n\n\nChildren born with an abnormally low birth weight can have significant problems within the first few years of life. They may have trouble gaining weight, obtaining adequate nutrition, and supporting a strong immune system. They also have higher risks for mortality, behavior problems, and mental deficiencies. Low birth weight babies are more likely to develop the following conditions after birth compared to normal birth weight babies:\n\n\nThat said, the effects of low birth weight on a child's first few years of life are often intertwined with other maternal, environmental, and genetic factors and most effects of low birth weight are only slightly negatively significant on a child's life when these factors are controlled for. When these factors are controlled, the only significant effect low birth weight has on a child's development is physical growth in the early years and the likelihood of being underweight compared to normal birth weight babies.\nStudies have been conducted to investigate how a person's birth weight can influence aspects of their future life. This includes theorised links with obesity, diabetes and intelligence.\n\nA baby born small or large for gestational age (either of the two extremes) is thought to have an increased risk of obesity in later life, but it was also shown that this relationship is fully explained by maternal weight. Middle aged adults with low birth weight present with a higher chance of obesity and diabetes. Children that are born under six pounds were 1.27 times more likely to develop diabetes compared to babies born at a healthy weight over six pounds.\n\nGrowth hormone (GH) therapy at a certain dose induced catch-up of lean body mass (LBM). However percentage body fat decreased in the GH-treated subjects. Bone mineral density SDS measured by DEXA increased significantly in the GH-treated group compared to the untreated subjects, though there is much debate over whether or not SGA (small for gestational age) is significantly adverse to children to warrant inducing catch-up.\nBabies that have a low birth weight are thought to have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in later life. Low birth weight is linked with increase rates of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes and it is shown that children with the low birth weights have increased leptin levels after they catch up growth during childhood. Adiponectin levels are positively related with birth weight and BMI in babies with an increase of risk of type 2 diabetes. The leptin and adiponection mechanisms are still being studied when involving low birth weight.\n\nSome studies have shown a direct link between an increased birth weight and an increased intelligence quotient. Increased birth weight is also linked to greater risk of developing autism.\n\nThere is much variation regarding birth weight within continents, countries, and cities. Even though over 20 million babies are born each year with low birth weight, it is hard to know the exact number as more than half of babies born in the world are not weighed at birth. The baby’s weight is an indicator of the mother and baby's health. In 2013 22 million newborns had low birth weight, around 16 percent of all babies globally. Data on low birth weight is adjusted to account for under reporting. South Asia has the highest rate of babies not weighed at birth with 66 percent, but also have the highest low birth weight at 28 percent worldwide. West and Central Africa and least developed countries are next with 14 percent low birth weight worldwide.\n\nMore than 96.5% of low birth weight babies are born in developing countries around the world. Because low birth weight babies can require more extensive care, it places a financial burden on communities.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recently announced an initiative to have a thirty percent reduction in low birth weight worldwide. This is public health priority, as birth weight can have short and long term effects. WHO estimates that worldwide, 15-20 % of all births each year are considered low birth weight, which is about 20 million births.\n\nThe start of prenatal care is very important to help prevent low birth weight and early medical problems. Going to regular doctor’s visits is very important for the health of the mother and the baby. At the visits the OB/GYN will be checking maternal nutrition and weight gain because that is linked with the baby’s weight gain. The mother having a healthy diet is essential for the baby. Maintaining good nutrition by taking folic acid, which can be found in fruits and vegetables, is linked to the prevention of premature births and low birth weight. Alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs should also be avoided during pregnancy because they can also lead to poor growth and other complications. By seeing the doctor they are also able to monitor pre-existing medical illnesses to make sure they are under control during pregnancy. Mothers with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes are more likely to have infants with low birth weights. One essential action to increase normal birth weights is to have affordable, accessible, and culturally sensitive prenatal care worldwide. This is essential not just for treating low birth weight, but also preventing it. Other prevention efforts include: smoking cessation programs, food-distribution systems, stress reduction and social service supports.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1995490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995490", "title": "Jacques Labillardière", "text": "Jacques Labillardière\n\nJacques-Julien Houtou de Labillardière (28 October 1755 – 8 January 1834) was a French biologist noted for his descriptions of the flora of Australia. Labillardière was a member of a voyage in search of the La Pérouse expedition. He published a popular account of his journey and produced the first Flora on the region.\n\nJacques Labillardière was born in Alençon, Normandy, France on 28 October 1755. The 9th of 14 children of a lace merchant, he was born into a devoutly Roman Catholic family of modest means.\n\nThe surname \"Labillardière\" originated with Labillardière's grandfather, Jacques Houtou, who, in an affectation of nobility, appended the name of the family's estate, \"La Billardière\", after his surname. Labillardière was thus baptised under the surname \"Houtou de Labillardière\", but he later dropped the patronymic, retaining only \"Labillardière\" in both his publications and his signature.\n\nAs a child, he attended the Collège royal d'Alençon, where he excelled in his studies. Around 1772, he matriculated to the University of Montpellier, studying medicine under Antoine Gouan. He did not graduate from Montpellier, instead transferring to the Reims University around 1774. After graduating in 1779, he moved to Paris, where he spent much his time at the Jardin du Roi. Having decided to pursue his interest in natural history, rather than a medical career, he took up an opportunity to collect specimens for Louis-Guillaume Le Monnier.\n\nLabillardière undertook his first voyage as a naturalist in 1783. Sent to Britain by Le Monnier to study the exotic plants in cultivation there, he ended up staying almost two years, during which time he established enduring friendships with Sir Joseph Banks, James Edward Smith, Aylmer Bourke Lambert and George Williams. On returning from Britain, Lab. immediately set out on a voyage through the French Alps.\n\nLabillardière's early voyages seem to have fired in him a passion for exploring foreign lands, for on his return to Paris he immediately began making plans for a voyage to the Near East, in order to study the plants described by physicians of the Islamic Golden Age. He again secured Le Monnier's sponsorship, and Le Monnier in turn secured the support of France's foreign minister Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes, rendering Labillardière's voyage virtually an official mission. Labillardière left paris in November 1786, and departed France via Marseilles in February 1787. He travelled first to Cyprus, then on to Latakia, Syria. From there he moved south along the coast as far as Acre before turning inland to Nazareth, via the Mount Carmel Range. From Nazareth he headed north to Damascus, visiting Mount Hermon en route. He then crossed the Mount Lebanon Range. arriving in Tripoli in late June. After a detour to Bsharri to see the Cedars of Lebanon, he returned north along the coast, departing from Latakia in November.\n\nThe following year, Labillardière made another voyage to the eastern Mediterranean. Little is known of this voyage, except that he made landfall at Crete, Corsica, Sardinia and Lampedusa.\n\nThe result of these two voyages was a collection of around 1000 specimens. As sponsor of the expedition, these were due to Le Monnier, but Labillardière retained a great many duplicate specimens. The voyage also resulting in Labillardière's botanical account of the region, later published as \"Icones plantarum Syriae rariorum\". Only 55 taxa were published in it, but according to Duyker \"this was sufficient to secure for him a place among the founders of modern botany in the Near and Middle East.\"\n\nIn 1791 Labillardière was appointed as a naturalist to Bruni d'Entrecasteaux's expedition to Oceania in search of the lost ships of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse. D'Entrecasteaux failed to find any trace of the missing expedition, but his ships visited southwest Australia, Tasmania, the North Island of New Zealand, and the East Indies, where Labillardière, Claude Riche, Étienne Pierre Ventenat assisted by gardener Félix Delahaye collected zoological, botanical and geological specimens, and described the customs and languages of the local Indigenous Australians.\n\nWhile the expedition was exploring Oceania, the French Revolutionary Wars had broken out in Europe, and when the ships reached Java Labillardière's scientific collections were seized by the British as spoils of war. Labillardière despaired at the loss of three years' painstaking work, but he had an ally in Joseph Banks, who campaigned for the return of the collections. In 1796 his lobbying succeeded, and he was able to write to William Price at the British Museum:\n\n... his Majesty's Ministers have thought it necessary for the honour of the British nation and for the advancement of Science that the right of the Captors to the Collection should be on this occasion wav'd and that the whole should be returned to M. de Billardiere, in order that he may be able to publish his Observations on Natural History in a complete manner ... By this her Majesty will lose an acquisition to her herbarium, which I very much wish'd to see deposited there, but the national character of Great Britain will certainly gain much credit for holding a conduct towards Science and Scientific men liberal in the highest degree.\n\nLabillardière returned to France with his collections in 1796. In 1799 he published a popular account of his voyage, Relation du Voyage à la Recherche de la Pérouse, and was elected to the \"Académie des sciences\". Between 1804 and 1807 he published \"Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen\", the first general description of the flora of Australia. In 1816, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nLabillardière had an abrasive, critical personality: even his eulogist described him as \"sharp and austere\", and a man who tended to \"hide everything that was good in his soul behind a caustic and bitter intellect.\" He was also extremely stubborn: Denis and Maisie Carr describe him as having \"the stubborn, almost pigheaded, independent mentality of the peasants near Alençon.\" On the other hand, he was highly regarded for his sincerity and generosity. Augustin Saint-Hilaire, for example, writes that Labillardière \"could perceive someone's slightest defect; yet he would have been ready to open his purse for the same man whose ridiculousness had not escaped him, and would have done all in his power to help him.\"\n\nIt has been said that Labillardière was scrupulously honest, especially with money, yet he has also been criticised for failing to acknowledge the work of others, such as his unattributed use of specimens collected by L'Héritier.\n\nNothing is known of his physique, but his travels as a naturalist reveal him to be a man of good physical fitness, with a strong constitution and immense stamina. Intellectually, he is shown to be not just an outstanding botanist and naturalist with excellent observational skills, but also to be possessed of considerable linguistic abilities, including an impeccable grasp of Latin.\n\nPolitically he was a staunch republican.\n\nLabillardière is commemorated in over a hundred published plant names, the most prestigious of which is the Australian endemic genus \"Billardiera\", named in Labillardière honour by James Edward Smith in 1793. In 1978 the Irish botanist Ernest Charles Nelson published \"Adenanthos labillardierei\" with the specific epithet \"in recognition of Labillardière's contribution to the knowledge of this genus, and Australian botany.\" A small number of animal species have been named in his honour also, namely the Tasmanian Pademelon (\"Thylogale billardierii\" ) and the red-legged skink (\"Ctenotus labillardieri\" ). His name is further honoured in Labillardiere Peninsula and Point Labillardiere on Bruny Island, and by Cape Labillardiere on Fergusson Island, Papua New Guinea.\n\nHis herbarium is now part of the Museo di Botanica at the Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze, University of Florence. About fifty of the plant genera established by Labillardière survive as current genera today.\n\nAmongst the notable plants detailed in the author's two works on Australia are the first descriptions of \"Cephalotus follicularis\" and \"Eucalyptus cornuta\".\n\nThe standard author abbreviation Labill. is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name.\n\nOnly two portraits of Labillardière survived: an 1821 lithograph of a sketch by Julien-Léopold Boilly, and a lithograph by Langlumè based on a portrait by Alexis Nicolas Noël.\n\nThe first biography of Labillardière was written by Jean Pierre Flourens, whose graveside eulogy of Labillardière was published in the \"Annales du Museum d'histoire\" in 1837. This first biography was very highly regarded, and seems to have formed the basis of most of the entries in French biographical dictionaries published over the next century; and also of the anonymous biography in Volume 2 of the \"Australian Dictionary of Biography\".\n\nNew insights into Labillardière's life and work did not begin to appear until the 1953 publication, by Auguste Chevalier, of new information on Labillardière's early life, together with a number of his letters. More letters were published in Gavin de Beer's 1960 \"The sciences were never at war\", and further biographical material was published by Frans Stafleu in 1967, and by Denis and Maisie Carr in 1976 and 1981. The first book-length treatment of Labillardière's life appeared in 2003 with the publication of Edward Duyker's award-winning \"Citizen Labillardière: A naturalist's life in revolution and exploration (1755–1834)\".\n\nA major thread in the historiography of Labillardière is questions surrounding the reliability of his work. There are anomalies and contradictions in both Labillardière's account of his voyage and in his botanical data. The former appear to be at least partly attributable to mistakes made in converting the measurements and dates in his journal into the metric system and Republican Calendar respectively. In the latter case, the anomalies mostly concern the collection locations of his specimens, about which he was apparently quite careless. Ernest Charles Nelson in particular did much to shed doubt upon Labillardière's reliability, and over time a tradition arose amongst botanists that Labillardière's data was not to be trusted. Labillardière's reputation has since been somewhat restored by the Carrs, who in 1976 published a detailed validation of Labillardière's account of his visit to Observatory Island, where \"Eucalyptus cornuta\" (Yate) was first collected.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges for biographers of Labillardière has been the gaining of insight into his character and personality. This is largely due to the paucity of documents and testimonies: fewer than sixty of his letters survive, and many of these are purely related to business matters. Since he clearly had an austere personality, Duyker speculates that \"the lack of surviving personal detail may in itself be a reflection of a strongly defensive character.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1995506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995506", "title": "WCW Light Heavyweight Championship", "text": "WCW Light Heavyweight Championship\n\nThe WCW Light Heavyweight Championship is a defunct professional wrestling championship that was contested in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) between 1991 and 1992. Conceived in 1991, the championship was first awarded as the result of a single-elimination tournament; its subsequent lineage would end when the final champion Brad Armstrong was stripped of the title due to injury. A second tournament to decide Armstrong's successor was announced, but never took place. During this time, the title was held by four different champions, with the inaugural champion Brian Pillman being the only wrestler to win it on more than one occasion.\n\nThe light heavyweight division which contested the championship had proved popular with fans, but its viability suffered as a result of WCW's creative decisions; in 1992, Bill Watts became the head booker, and implemented storyline changes in WCW's product which stymied the division's style. WCW would later introduce another, similar title in the WCW Cruiserweight Championship; the two titles are now considered one and the same by the wrestling promotion WWE, which purchased WCW's assets in 2001.\n\nThe WCW Light Heavyweight Championship was created in 1991, with the inaugural champion decided though a single-elimination tournament held over several weeks. Seven wrestlers were used for the tournament—three quarter final matches, with the seventh competitor entering at the semi final stages. The first two quarter finals were broadcast on \"WorldWide\" in August 1991, and saw The York Foundation's Richard Morton defeat Johnny Rich, and Badstreet defeat Joey Maggs. The next month, WCW's \"Main Event\" featured the last quarter final, in which Mike Graham triumphed over another York Foundation member in Terrance Taylor.\n\nBoth of the semi final matches were held at September's \"Clash of the Champions XVI\" event in Augusta, Georgia; Morton defeated Graham in a heel finish which depicted him using several illegal advantages to win. In the other leg of the tournament, Badstreet was defeated by the newly-entering Brian Pillman with a body press from the top rope. Morton and Pillman contested the final round at the 1991 Halloween Havoc event, held in Chattanooga, Tennessee; Pillman won the match and championship with another top rope body press.\n\nPillman's reign as champion continued until December 1991, when he began to feud with masked Japanese wrestler Jushin Thunder Liger. Liger defeated Pillman for the championship at a house show held in Atlanta, Georgia on December 25, 1991. Pillman reclaimed the title in a rematch at the SuperBrawl II pay-per-view event on February 29 the following year in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, becoming the only wrestler to hold the championship more than once.\n\nPillman successfully defended the championship against Tom Zenk at the May 17 WrestleWar event in Jacksonville, Florida, before being defeated by Scotty Flamingo in Mobile, Alabama, during the June 20 Beach Blast pay-per-view. Flamingo's brief reign was ended by Brad Armstrong during a house show; the match was filmed out-of-sequence with several other televised championship matches, which meant Flamingo would tape a defense against Scott Sandlin despite having already lost the championship, while Armstrong recorded a match against Tracy Smothers that would air as a title defense despite being shot before his win was officially acknowledged. Armstrong's reign saw the return of Liger as a challenger; they fought on several occasions, either with Armstrong winning or the match ending in a draw. Armstrong's last successful defense of the Light Heavyweight Championship was against Flamingo on August 14 in Fort Myers, Florida.\n\nAs the September 1992 \"Clash of the Champions XX\" approached, Armstrong suffered a knee injury and was unable to participate in a planned title match against Pillman at the event. Armstrong was formally stripped of the belt at Clash of the Champions, depicted as the result of him not defending it for thirty days, and another tournament to appoint a new champion was announced. However, Bill Watts had taken over the role of head booker for WCW and began to implement several changes in the work being produced. Among Watts' edicts was a new rule that would depict any maneuver performed from the top rope of the ring as illegal and resulting in disqualification; this effectively ended the viability of the light heavyweight style, even though the matches involved in the championship picture had been considered \"outstanding\" by the fans. As a result, the planned tournament was never held and the light heavyweight division was ignored for the remainder of Watts' tenure.\n\nIn 1996, WCW once again held a tournament to crown a champion for the weight class, this time under the title WCW Cruiserweight Championship. The first champion under this new lineage was Shinjiro Otani, who defeated Chris Benoit in the tournament final. After the acquisition of WCW's assets by rival company WWE, both title lineages were considered to be related, and WWE refers to the holders of the Light Heavyweight Championship as former Cruiserweight Champions.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1995527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995527", "title": "Safe as Milk", "text": "Safe as Milk\n\nSafe as Milk is the debut studio album by American rock group Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band, released in June 1967 by Buddah Records. A heavily blues-influenced work, the album featured a 20-year-old Ry Cooder, who played guitar and wrote some of the arrangements.\n\nBefore recording \"Safe as Milk\", the band had released a couple of singles through A&M Records, and it was to this company that the group first proposed their début album in 1966. They presented the label with a set of R&B-influenced demos, which the label felt were too unconventional and decided to drop the band. Beefheart later said the label dropped them after hearing the song \"Electricity\" and declaring it \"too negative\". A&M's Jerry Moss thought the content too risqué for his daughter's ears. This, plus Leonard Grant's severance as manager, added to the discontent. The band instead turned to Bob Krasnow, who was then working for Kama Sutra Records; he recruited them to record for the company's new subsidiary label, Buddah.\n\nMeanwhile, Beefheart had been secretly planning changes to the Magic Band's line-up—a practice common throughout the group's existence. The group that recorded the two A&M singles had consisted of Doug Moon and Richard Hepner on guitars, Jerry Handley on bass, and Alex St. Clair on drums. Hepner had already left, and Beefheart was keen to replace Moon with Ry Cooder, who was then playing with Gary Marker and Taj Mahal in the Rising Sons. These and other changes resulted in a Magic Band with Handley on bass, St. Clair on guitar, and John French on drums, with Cooder providing additional guitar parts. Cooder's arrival had been swayed by Marker, who had spent time with Beefheart and had been given to believe he would produce the album; in fact, Marker was only engaged in demo recording.\n\nThe album is heavily influenced by the Delta blues, and this is apparent from the opening bars of the first track, \"Sure 'Nuff 'n Yes I Do\", based on Muddy Waters' \"Rollin' and Tumblin. The opening lyric, \"Well I was born in the desert ...\", quotes \"New Minglewood Blues\" by Cannon's Jug Stompers, an early version of \"Rollin' and Tumblin\". Elsewhere, the album features a version of Robert Pete Williams' \"Grown So Ugly\" arranged by Cooder.\n\nAnother of the more distinctive songs on the album is \"Abba Zaba\", one of three compositions credited solely to Beefheart using his real name. An AllMusic review of the track states, \"Although not directly blues influenced 'Abba Zaba' contains peripheral elements of the wiry delta sound that informed much of the album\", noting that Cooder's influence is heard here in the \"chiming, intricate guitar lines\" and \"up front and biting bass work\". The track is named after the Abba-Zaba candy bar, which was supposedly a favorite of the young Beefheart. The band had, at one point, planned to name the album after the confection, but the bar's manufacturer, the Cardinet Candy Co., refused permission for use of the name, and the album was retitled. The black and yellow checkerboard pattern on the album's back sleeve, designed by Tom Wilkes, is a relic of this idea—echoing the black and yellow colors of the candy bar wrapper. Writing an obituary for Beefheart in 2010, for \"The Washington Post\", Matt Schudel said:\n\n\"Mr. Van Vliet's lyrics and song titles owed a great deal to surreal poetry. Try as they might, his fans had a difficult time analyzing such lines as these from \"Abba Zabba\" on the 1966 album \"Safe as Milk\":\nFor some time, the involvement of a Herb Bermann as co-writer on eight of the tracks was a point of confusion, as Vliet did not employ him, or indeed any regular co-writer at any other time in his career, and never discussed or clarified his role in the album. There was little record of his existence, though his name incidentally also appeared in a reference to an unproduced screenplay for \"After the Gold Rush\" on the 1971 Neil Young album of the same name. Various Magic Band members had in fact indicated that the name may have been nothing other than a publishing-related pseudonym. It was only in 2003 that Bermann himself was finally located and interviewed, and his involvement as co-writer confirmed.\n\n\"Safe As Milk\" was prominently advertised in \"Billboard\", \"World Countdown\" and elsewhere in June 1967. However, the band's planned appearance at the Monterey Festival that month fell through, and the record did not achieve popular success, failing to chart in either the United States, where none of Beefheart's albums would ever enter the top 100, or in the United Kingdom, where the band would enjoy modest success with later works such as \"Trout Mask Replica\" (1969). John Lennon had two Safe As Milk promotional stickers on cupboard doors at his home. \n\nThe album made a greater impact in Europe than in the U.S., with the British underground DJ John Peel being a noted admirer from the start, though the original British release was in mono only.\n\nThe album was included in Robert Dimery's \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".\n\nIt was voted number 172 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).\n\nThe album was released in the UK on Pye International, and subsequently reissued in Pye's budget Marble Arch series (albeit bearing Pye International labels on the disc itself) as a 10-track, omitting \"I'm Glad\" and \"Grown So Ugly\". When Buddah's UK distribution passed to Polydor in 1970 it was again reissued, this time on Buddah in Polydor's budget 99 series and retitled \"Dropout Boogie\". Initially the track listing of this release matched the Marble Arch version, but the missing tracks were quickly restored. This 99 series release was also the first appearance in the UK of a stereo mix of the album.\n\nIn 1999, the now-correctly spelled Buddha Records, owned by Sony BMG who had acquired Buddah's back catalogue, remastered the album onto CD. They added seven bonus tracks, taken from the sessions for the unreleased \"Brown Wrapper\" follow-up album. These tracks had been recorded around November 1967 (two months after \"Safe as Milk\"'s release), and were from the same sessions that yielded the songs on \"Mirror Man\" (1971). BMG's Buddha also released \"The Mirror Man Sessions\" on CD in 1999, effectively an official issue of the unphased versions of \"Mirror Man\", with five further bonus tracks taken from the same sessions.\n\nIn 2013, Sundazed Records released the mono mix of \"Safe As Milk\" on LP and CD.\n\nIn 2019, the track \"Zig Zag Wanderer\" was used as the soundtrack for a Hyundai advertisement.\n\nAll songs written by Herb Bermann and Don Van Vliet except where noted. All CD bonus tracks written Don Van Vliet.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It lasted from 1996 until 1997, when it was abandoned. It is not to be confused with prior women's titles recognized by the promotion.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Jim Crockett Promotions (which eventually became World Championship Wrestling) was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance and recognized the NWA World Women's Championship, which was held by Debbie Combs. The Kansas City promotion that recognized Combs as the champion withdrew from NWA in 1987 and closed in 1988. During this time, the NWA vacated Combs' title and awarded Misty Blue Simmes the reactivated NWA United States Women's Championship (a replacement of the prior NWA World Women's Championship held by Combs). Simmes defended the title from 1987–1989, when the title was no longer recognized by Jim Crockett Promotions.\n\nIn 1990, the organization recognized Ladies Professional Wrestling Association Champion Susan Sexton as the World Women's Champion. Sexton defended the title against Bambi at Clash of the Champions XII.\n\nWCW attempted to create a new women's division in 1991. At WrestleWar, a women's match was featured pitting Itsuki Yamazaki and Mami Kitimura against Miki Handa and Miss A. Later in the year, former United States Women's Champion Misty Blue Simmes returned to the organization and competed in matches against Linda Dallas and Kat LeRoux. During this time, the organization also featured televised matches involving Madusa, Bambi, Leilani Kai, and Judy Martin. By the end of the year, all of the female wrestlers departed from the organization except Madusa (who was retained as a valet).\n\nThe women's division in WCW was slowly revived in 1996 following the return of Madusa, who spent the first half of the year feuding with Sherri Martel and Bull Nakano. This led to the creation of the WCW Women's Championship. The first official WCW Women's Champion was crowned in an 8-woman tournament that began on an episode of \"WCW Monday Nitro\" on November 4, 1996 and concluded at Starrcade on December 29, 1996. The tournament used only seven wrestlers; five of these wrestlers were Japanese talents from the GAEA Japan promotion (Akira Hokuto, Chigusa Nagayo, KAORU, Meiko Satomura, and Sonoko Kato). The other competitors were Madusa and Malia Hosaka. Akira Hokuto actually competed twice in the first round of the tournament, losing to Madusa wrestling under her masked Reina Jabuki gimmick and defeating Satomura competing as Hokuto.\n\nThe two primary competitors over the history of this title were Akira Hokuto and Madusa, as they met in the tournament finals and at subsequent PPV events. Other women that competed in the division included Malia Hosaka, Leilani Kai, Peggy Lee Leather, Debbie Combs, and Luna Vachon. The last defense of the title occurred at The Great American Bash on June 15, 1997 when Hokuto defeated Madusa in a title vs. career match. Madusa retired and Hokuto went back to Japan and the title was apparently vacated. On September 20, 1997 in Japan, Devil Masami won the vacated title; however, it was abandoned shortly thereafter. In the United States, WCW continued to feature women's wrestling occasionally on its minor TV shows during 1998. During the match between Malia Hosaka and Starla Saxton that aired on December 26, 1998, Mike Tenay acknowledged Akira Hokuto as the reigning WCW Women's Champion, even though she had not appeared in WCW since June 1997 and the title had been won by Devil Masami in Japan.\n\nIn late 1999 and early 2000, WCW rebuilt the women's division by hiring several female wrestlers, as well as training the Nitro Girls to wrestle. An onscreen angle featured Madusa attempting to revive the WCW Women's Championship, but she was consistently halted in her efforts by the chauvinistic Oklahoma (who had been feuding with her over the WCW Cruiserweight Championship). During this time, the women's division included Madusa, Mona, Sherri Martel, Rhonda Sing, Patty Stonegrinder, Brandi Alexander, Little Jeanne, Dee Dee Venturi, Fantasy, Lexie Fyfe, Asya, Midnight, Daffney, Major Gunns, Miss Hancock, Torrie Wilson, Kimberly Page, Spice, Paisley, and Tygress. Although women's matches were featured regularly, the WCW Women's Championship was not reinstated.\n\nIn addition to the WCW Women's Championship, the organization also recognized the WCW Women's Cruiserweight Championship in 1997.\n\n"}

At the same time they learn about hunger in the real world and the WFP's work to prevent it.\n\nIn 2011, a new, socially interactive game was launched in November by the World Food Programme in partnership with Konami. The game, which is takes place entirely on Facebook, is amongst the first games ever to feature a real world impact through virtual goods.\n\nThe game takes place on the fictional island of Sheylan in the Indian Ocean, which is suffering from both drought and civil war. The player's character is a rookie who has joined a team of UN experts, including a nutritionist, a logistics officer, a pilot, an appeals officer, and the director of food purchasing.\n\nThe game contains six missions:\n\nMost of the gameplay is arcade oriented, with time-limited sequences. All six missions could be played through in under an hour, though players might replay the individual missions, as their high scores could be uploaded online for worldwide comparison with other players, until another game, under the same name, was made by the WFP and Konami.\n\nThe game was freely downloadable, but with the release of a game under the same name by WFP, the game's website has been shut down along with all of the official download links. The game is still mirrored on various websites, but there is no official download link. It had versions for the Windows and Macintosh. Linux users could use Wine to install the Windows version of the game and the QuickTime bundled with the package.

It was the pack-in game for the console in North America.\n\nThe video game was originally released in Japan by Hudson Soft on August 30, 1988 for the PC Engine (The TG-16's Japanese counterpart), under the title Mashin Eiyūden Wataru (魔神英雄伝ワタル) which is adapted from the anime television series of the same name (\"Spirit Hero Wataru\"). Hudson later released in 1990 another game for the Famicom based on the franchise titled \"Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru Gaiden Famicom\", which is a role-playing video game.\n\nThe player controls Keith Courage. In this game, Earth has been struck by a giant meteor, carrying an invasion force from another planet. Burrowing deep within the planet's surface, the planet of B.A.D. (Beastly Alien Dudes) seeks to take over the Earth. As a member of N.I.C.E. (Nations of International Citizens for Earth), Keith's mission is to defeat B.A.D. and bring peace to the world. Armed with a sword, Keith must first defeat the outpost guards. Then, enter the Underworld. Here Keith activates the awesome Nova Suit. A secret force left to him by his fallen father, he is half man, half mechanical monster. Nearly invincible, his sword cracks with the power of lightning, as you wreak havoc on the fearsome Dudes. His goal is to reach the Robo Zone (the \nseventh Alpha Zone), headquarters of B.A.D. Succeed here and the player will win the game, recapturing the Earth and restoring humanity's place in the universe. Four friends offer Keith advice, swords, bombs, and extra lives. The player's goal is to collect the stolen riches left behind by the invaders and buy your way out of trouble with money.\n\nThe game is a platformer action-adventure game, but it sports two different styles of play depending on whether the player is above (overworld) or below ground (underworld). There are a total of seven levels in the game, each of which is broken into two areas, the overworld and underworld. Overworld areas consist of simple rightward travel and platform hopping. In the overworld, one controls Keith Courage in his human form, using a dagger to fend off enemies which take the form of birds, moles, and even cats that drop from the sky. Upon reaching the end of the overworld level, Keith is transported via rainbow to the underworld, whereupon he adopts the Nova Suit. The underworld levels are more complex and menacing than the colorful overworld, with aggressive nightmare creatures and a larger landscape to travel with more of a focus on navigating not only horizontally but also vertically. At the end of each underworld level is a boss. In the overworld, you can go into buildings at times and buy power ups.\n\nIn the overworld, Keith is a simple adventurous human with a short sword and three heart containers. The overworld, while simple, is where Keith will collect coins and spend those coins to obtain \"bolt bombs,\" health regeneration, and better equipment for the underworld by going to houses that have NPC's to talk to.\n\nTransporting to the underworld places Keith in the Nova Suit, a suit of armor that grants him extra hearts on his health bar and a better sword depending on what was purchased in the overworld. Additionally, Keith is now able to use the \"bolt bombs.\" When used, bolt bombs are similar to bullets that are fired in the eight cardinal directions depending on how many are left.\n\n"}

They were discovered in 1955 by Howard L. Sanders, and are commonly referred to as horseshoe shrimps. They have been grouped together with the Remipedia in the Xenocarida. Although a second family, Lightiellidae, is sometimes used, all cephalocaridans are generally considered to belong in just one family: Hutchinsoniellidae. Though no fossil record of cephalocaridans has been found, most specialists believe them to be primitive among crustaceans.\n\n\nThese crustaceans are from in length, with an elongated body. They have a large head, the hind edge of which covers the first thoracic segment. They have no eyes, presumably because of their muddy natural habitat. The second pair of antennae is located behind the mouth; in all other crustaceans the antennae are in front of the mouth at the adult stage, and only their larvae have antennae that have the same location as adult cephalocaridans.\n\nThe mouth is located behind the large upper lip, flanked by mandibles. The first pair of maxillae is very small, and the second pair has the same structure as the following thoracic legs: a large basal part, equipped with outgrowths on the inner side, used in locomotion, a forked inner branch and two outer lobes - referred to as the \"pseudoepipod\" and the \"exopod\". The structural and functional similarity between the maxillae and the legs may be a sign of primitive organization; the maxillae are not specialized, as they are in other crustaceans.\n\nThe thorax consists of 10 segments, and the abdomen bears a telson but no other appendages.\n\nCephalocaridans are found from the intertidal zone down to a depth of , in all kinds of sediments. Cephalocaridans feed on marine detritus. To bring in food particles, they generate currents with the thoracic appendages like the branchiopods and the malacostracans. Food particles are then passed anteriorly along a ventral groove, leading to the mouthparts.\n\n"}

She sang Rosina in Rossini's \"The Barber of Seville\" at Braunschweig in 1956, following this with Micaëla in \"Carmen\" and Zerbinetta in \"Ariadne auf Naxos\".\n\nThe important part of her career began in 1959, when she sang the Queen of Night in Mozart's \"Die Zauberflöte\" at the Vienna State Opera (under Karl Böhm) and at the Aix-en-Provence Festival. \"France-Soir\" dubbed her \"a second Callas.\" Other early roles included Leonora in \"Il trovatore\", Santuzza in \"Cavalleria rusticana\", the four heroines of \"Les contes d'Hoffmann\", Konstanze in \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\", and Fiordiligi in \"Così fan tutte\".\n\nShe made her debut in 1960 at the Bayreuth Festival, as Senta in \"Der fliegende Holländer\". At Bayreuth (until 1967), she also sang Elsa von Brabant in \"Lohengrin\" (opposite Astrid Varnay), Elisabeth in \"Tannhäuser\", Eva in \"Die Meistersinger\", Venus in \"Tannhäuser\", Freia in \"Das Rheingold\", the Waldvogel in \"Siegfried\", etc. Outside Bayreuth, the soprano appeared in Wieland Wagner's productions of \"Salome\", \"Tristan und Isolde\", \"Die Walküre\" and \"Siegfried\" (as Brünnhilde), \"Elektra\", \"Fidelio\", \"Otello\", \"Lulu\", \"Wozzeck\" (conducted by Pierre Boulez), and other operas. Of her Salome, Harold Rosenthal wrote in \"Opera\", in 1968:\n\nAnja Silja's performance was a tour-de-force. Her voice is not beautiful by any stretch of the imagination, but it is clearly projected, and every phrase carries its overtones—psychological not musical—which suggest the child-like degenerate, over-sexed princess in all too clear a manner. Her nervous, almost thin body is never still; she rolls on her stomach and on her back; she crawls, she slithers, she leaps, she kneels….

She was seen in Frankfurt, Toulouse, Paris, Turin, Naples, Stuttgart, Zurich, Barcelona, Geneva, the Netherlands, Budapest, London (Royal Festival Hall, then Covent Garden), San Francisco (her American debut, in 1968, as Salome), and Chicago. That first Lady Macbeth, in 1967, was conducted by Christoph von Dohnányi, with whom she had a long relationship, including a marriage that produced three children. They divorced in the 1990s, during Dohnányi's tenure with the Cleveland Orchestra.\n\nSilja continued her career with appearances at Trieste, the Edinburgh Festival, the Salzburg Festival, Barcelona, Metropolitan Opera (\"Fidelio\" and \"Salome\", 1972), Paris (\"Erwartung\", under Sir Georg Solti), Berlin, Cologne (\"La fanciulla del West\"), Vienna (world premiere of Einem's \"Kabale und Liebe\") and Brussels.

The Library also occupied space in the Green Academy from 1821 until Union soldiers burned the school during the Civil War, and moved to borrowed spaces several times until the Carnegie Library was opened in 1916. A new building was constructed to accommodate city and county growth, and opened in 1966. The area enjoyed rapid growth with the influx of government employees involved in the development of the space program, including the United States Army and NASA, and the library eventually needed more space as early as 1969. Library officials began planning for a new building in 1983.\n\nThe current facility's main branch, sometimes referred to as \"Fort Book\" for its fortress-like appearance, opened on Monroe Street in April 1987 and serves as the headquarters for the Huntsville Madison County Public Library System. The building contains , has a seating capacity of 930 and contains over 530,000 volumes, with administrative offices located on the third floor. The library had a circulation of 1,915,548 in 2007, making it the highest-circulating library in Alabama.\n\nThe Huntsville-Madison County Public Library received a federal grant from the Library Services and Technology Act in 2004 specifically to digitize photographs from the Library's Archives for inclusion in the Alabama Mosaic Project.\n\nHMCPL systems owns and operates the Main Library building in Downtown Huntsville, and 12 branch libraries throughout Madison County:\n\nThe Triana branch has a new building after the original was destroyed by fire in late 2009. The new building opened in the spring of 2014, adjacent to the old location. The Bailey Cove branch will be combined with other branches in the south Huntsville area to create a new South Huntsville Branch.\n\n"}

He was a founder of the science of plant cytology.\n\nA native Parisian, at the age of twenty, he became an assistant-naturalist with the French National Museum of Natural History. While there he began to examine plant tissue under a microscope.\n\nIn 1802, Mirbel published his treatise \"Traité d'anatomie et de physiologie végétale\" which established his position as a founder of cytology, plant histology and plant physiology in France. He proposed that all plant tissue is modified from parenchyma (supporting tissue). His observation, in 1809, that each plant cell is contained in a continuous membrane, remains a central contribution to cytology.\n\nIn 1803, Mirbel obtained the post of superintendent of the gardens of Napoleon's Château de Malmaison. There he studied and published on structure of plant tissue and the development of plant organs. He also studied and described the genus \"Marchantia\" of liverworts. His 1802 treatise and these publications enabled him, in 1808, to join the French Academy of Sciences and to become the chair of the botany department of the Sorbonne. His combined tissue studies were published in 1815 as \"Eléments de physiologie végétale et de botanique\".\n\nWith the Bourbon Restoration, Mirbel's friend Élie, duc Decazes, then Minister of Interior, offered him the post of Secretary General. But the fall of the government in 1829, marked the end of Mirbel's political career, and he returned to a position with the National Museum of Natural History as head of the \"Jardin des Plantes\" in Paris, and eventually became the Director of Culture (chaire de culture) for the museum. Mirbel was elected a foreign member of the British Royal Society of London in 1837.\n\nIn 1823 Mirbel married Lizinska Aimée Zoé Rue, a French painter of miniatures. He died in Champerret, France in 1854. The plant genus \"Mirbelia\" and the orchid \"Dendrobium mirbelianum\" are named in his honor.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1995610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1995610", "title": "540 kick", "text": "540 kick\n\nIn martial arts and tricking, the 540 kick (Chinese:旋風腳 (\"Xuanfengjiao\")) (also known as inside turning kick, jump inside kick, and \"hyper\" tornado kick) is a jump kick move. It involves a rotation of approximately 540 degrees (although when performed correctly the performer has only done a spin of 360 degrees – not including whatever takeoff used).\n\nIt is practiced various disciplines including Taekwondo, Tang Soo Do, Wushu, Shaolin Quan, Capoeira and some Karate styles but traditionally most associated with the Korean martial arts. However, the most prominent defining feature is that the same leg is used for taking off, kicking, and landing. The other leg is used to propel the performer into the air, and is then retracted before landing. Many martial arts tricksters choose this move as their first move to attempt.\n\nThis move has a history in ballet as well, where it is performed as an advanced variation of a 'barrel roll'. Principal male ballet dancers include the move in their variation (solo) as a crowd-pleasing feat of excellence. The move and a variation of it, the reverse 540, has been present in ballet for quite some time now, and is used commonly by dancers such as Daniil Simkin, Tetsuya Kumakawa and Joseph Phillips. This move has been recently introduced into the world of professional wrestling, where it is commonly referred to as a \"jumping corkscrew roundhouse kick\" (and WWE superstar Kofi Kingston's variation is called \"Trouble in Paradise\").\n\nLike most variations of martial arts kicks, the name of the kick is normally determined by the position of the foot, degree of rotation and positioning of the hips, and any additional kicks that may be added during the execution:\n\nA jump turning kick that mimics the 540. The practitioner, already facing he target, jumps up to perform an inside crescent or roundhouse kick, and tucks the other to then land on the kicking foot. This motion does not share the full take off pattern of a true 540.\n\nThis variation of the kick is typically found in wushu. The kick is executed as a crescent kick, meaning that the toes are pointed forwards with the hips facing the target. If aiming for a target, the target would be hit with the inside of the foot (from the heel to the big toe).\n\nThis version rotates the hips about 90° more than a crescent before executing the kick. The kick is executed as a roundhouse kick meaning that a target would be hit with the top of the foot or ankle to avoid breaking the toes. It is also called a Bolley Kick by some in TaeKwonDo, and was popularized in the mid-eighties by George Chung and Steven Ho in open martial art competitions. In TaeKwonDo, a tricking \"540\" kick refers to this 540 roundhouse, rather than the TaeKwonDo 540 hook kick.\n\nThe take off of this is like a 1-over 360 kick. If back on your right foot, throw it forward counterclockwise, tuck it and push off with your right. Jump up and complete 360 with an outside, counterclockwise crescent kick and land on the same foot. Look at the reverse image of a 540 and you can see it.\n\nAlso referred to as simply a \"Lazyboy\", this version is identical to a typical 540 from a technical standpoint. The defining characteristic is that the hands are placed on the back or top of the head. This pose is to simulate the image of a person relaxing or lying down. While struck in the air, this variation is performed to show the ease in which they can perform the trick, demonstrating that they don't need the momentum of the arms to complete the trick, and/or to add style to the trick. This trick is also known as the \"Playboy 540\" for its extravagance and confident posture such of a playboy.\n\nThis is performed with a take off from both legs and executed with an inside crescent kick.\n\nThough, the body mechanics/technique is different, the Sideswipe and 540 are categorized together because they both use the same leg to take off, kick, and land. This version is similar to a standard 540 kick, but the body is spinning parallel to the ground and can be performed almost inverted. After the non-kicking leg is thrown up in the take-off, the body is leaned back so it is spinning at least horizontally. This kick has less practical use due to the higher levels of agility required.\n\nAlso called a \"Cheat 720\" or a \"540 Wheel,\" the 540 hook uses the same takeoff as mentioned previously. However, instead of using the jumping leg to kick, the performer spins around another 180 degrees and performs a hook kick or outside crescent kick with the other leg, depending on the position of the foot. This kick is one of the variations that actually spins a full 540°. A TaeKwonDo \"540\" refers to this kick.\n\nIn this move, the user will execute a 540 crescent/roundhouse kick but instead of landing immediately on the kicking leg, the kicker will rotate an additional 360 degrees mid-air before landing. It is rather uncommon in the tricking community due to its difficulty, but is present in martial arts disciplines. It is most prevalent in Wushu.\n\nThe traditional 540 can be landed into the splits by sending the kicking leg backwards after the kick has been executed and extending the other leg forward during the landing. Theoretically, almost every trick can be landed in the splits, however, landing some of the more advanced versions of tricks like this would require extra height in the jump, extra rotation of the body, and a very keen sense of timing and spatial awareness.\n\nSome variants of the 540 include multiple kicks being executed while in the air. Some of those variations are:\n\nNot to be confused with the 540 crescent, a crescent 540 is where a crescent kick is thrown out with the first leg before the regular 540 kick is thrown with the other. Both of these kicks are executed mid-air. A variation of this is where the first crescent kick is thrown as a twisted front kick, followed by a round house kick. For this the hips must be rotated more before the kicks are thrown, allowing the feet to be turned towards the targets.\n\nThis is similar to a crescent 540 in that there are two kicks executed in sequence, however the 540 kick (either crescent or roundhouse) is thrown out first. Immediately following the first kick, the other leg comes around to execute a heel kick after rotating an additional 180 degrees. The mechanics to this variant are almost identical to a 540-wheel or cheat 720. Proper execution of this involves performing a roundhouse kick instead of an inside crescent kick, with the hips turned over and toes pointed. In doing so, after the first kick is completed, the kicker's hips and body are in a better position to spin around and snap out the hook.\n\nThis is the combination of a crescent 540 and a jacknife, essentially executing three separate kicks during the same motion. One with the landing leg and two with the other. The kicks and their execution are similar to those of a 720 triple. This move is commonly performed in TaeKwonDo demonstrations.\n\n\n"}

Marshall played for the Winnipeg Victorias, Montreal HC, Montreal Shamrocks, Montreal Wanderers, Toronto Pros and Toronto Blueshirts. Marshall was a member of six Stanley Cup championship teams for four clubs. He won his first Stanley Cup in 1901 with Winnipeg Victorias. He then joined the Montreal HC and won two more Cups in 1902 and 1903. He also won the Stanley Cup with Montreal Wanderers in 1907 and 1910. Marshall won his sixth and final Cup as a player-manager with the Toronto Blueshirts in 1914.\n\nMarshall was the first player to win six Stanley Cup titles. He was also the first player to win the Stanley Cup while playing for four clubs. His teammate on the 1914 Stanley Cup winning Toronto Blueshirts, goalie Hap Holmes, tied the record in 1925 while backstopping the Victoria Cougars to a Stanley Cup victory. Marshall was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1965.\n\nBorn in Saint-Vallier, Quebec, south-east of Quebec City, Marshall moved to Montreal and played high school hockey for Pointe-Saint-Charles, starting in 1894. In 1898, he made the jump to senior level play when he moved out west and started play with the Winnipeg Victorias. He played with the Victorias until 1901, winning the Stanley Cup in a challenge with the Montreal Shamrocks.\n\nAfter the season, he moved back home and joined the Montreal Hockey Club. As one of the \"Little Men of Iron\", the club won the Stanley Cup in 1902 and 1903. Along with several other players of the club, he left in 1903 to form the new Montreal Wanderers. He played two seasons with the Wanderers before he moved to Toronto. In 1905-06, he played with the new Toronto Professionals in exhibition play. In 1906, he returned to Montreal, and he played for the Montreal Montagnards in 1907, joining the Wanderers after the Montagnards disbanded. The Wanderers won the ECAHA title that season and successfully defended their Stanley Cup championship of 1906 in challenges.\n\nHowever, Marshall did not stay with the club beyond that season. He moved to the Montreal Shamrocks and played two seasons for the Shamrocks before returning to the Wanderers for the 1910 NHA season. He helped the Wanderers to another Stanley Cup win that season, the club's last in its history. He stayed with the organization until 1912, when he returned to Toronto to join the new Toronto Hockey Club team. After Bruce Ridpath retired as manager in 1913, Marshall took on the responsibility while continuing to play for the team. He would win another Stanley Cup with the Torontos in 1914. The following season was cut short due to appendicitis and he only played four games. In all, he played three seasons for the Torontos before he returned to the Wanderers in 1915 for two seasons, before retiring from hockey in 1917.\n\n\n"}
