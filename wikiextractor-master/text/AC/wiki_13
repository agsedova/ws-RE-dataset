It involves the laying on of hands and is performed after baptism. Through confirmation, the initiate becomes an official member of the church and receives the gift of the Holy Ghost. Baptism and confirmation are administered to persons at least eight years old (the age of accountability). The ordinance corresponds to the confirmation rite in many other Christian faiths. Confirmations were first performed on April 6, 1830 at the organizational meeting of the Church of Christ.\n\nThe gift of the Holy Ghost is considered the fourth of the \"first principles and ordinances of the Gospel\": First being \"Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost\". The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that these two ordinances are necessary for all mankind, so they perform both baptisms and confirmations by proxy on behalf of the dead in their temples.\n\nJoseph Smith taught the need for both water baptism and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost: \"The baptism of water, without the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost attending it, is of no use,\" he declared. \"They are necessarily and inseparably connected. An individual must be born of water and the spirit in order to get into the kingdom of God\". According to standard Latter Day Saint theology, the gift of the Holy Ghost is the privilege of receiving inspiration, divine manifestations, direction, and other blessings from the Holy Spirit which are not available to those who have not received the ordinance. These include cautions, warnings, and discernment of right and wrong. The gift of the Holy Ghost is the key to all of the spiritual gifts operating in the church, including prophecy and revelation.\n\nLatter Day Saints believe that people who have not received the gift of the Holy Ghost are able to feel the influence of the Holy Ghost from time to time and the inspiration of the light of Christ (conscience) as they listen to spiritual promptings, but those who have been baptized and confirmed to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost will always feel his companionship, as long as they remain worthy of it. Latter Day Saints believe that the state of worthiness is maintained through ongoing repentance and discipleship. Latter Day Saints believe that a person who has received the gift of the Holy Ghost will lose the benefit of its promptings if they commit a major sin (until they repent) or if they exercise \"compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness\".\n\nLatter Day Saints believe that the Holy Spirit is the sanctifier, and his sanctifying influence is called the \"baptism of fire\". Latter Day Saints believe that through the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost, the heart and desires are cleansed and purified. However, confirmation is not the end but the beginning of the lifetime process of sanctification. Receiving the Holy Ghost includes inviting him into one's daily life as a \"constant companion\", which is believed to give strength, guidance, and enlightenment. Latter Day Saints believe that the performance of the ordinance alone is not enough to insure actual reception of the Spirit but depends on the humility, faith, and worthiness of the individual.\n\nWhereas Priests are able to baptize, only those who have the Melchizedek Priesthood are able to confirm newly baptized members such that they can receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. The ordinance is usually performed during a baptismal service or a fast and testimony meeting in the following manner:\n\n\n"}

It is the best known of Chandler's songs, and he subsequently dubbed himself \"The Duke of Earl\". The song was penned by Chandler, Bernice Williams, and Earl Edwards. This song was a 2002 inductee into the Grammy Hall of Fame. It has also been selected by The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\n\nThe song originated from warm-up exercises by the Dukays, a vocal group that included Chandler (under his original name, Eugene Dixon) and Earl Edwards and that had already had some success on the R&B chart. The group would regularly warm up by singing \"Do do do do...\" in different keys. On one occasion, Dixon changed the syllables he was singing to include Earl's name, and the chant gradually became the nonsense words \"Du..du..du..Duke of Earl\". The pair worked on the song with regular songwriter and mentor Bernice Williams, and then recorded it with the other members of the Dukays. However, the group's record company preferred to release another song, \"Nite Owl\", leaving Dixon with the offer of releasing it as a solo artist. Dixon changed his name to Gene Chandler (a surname taken from that of the actor Jeff Chandler), and the song was released at the end of 1961, quickly rising to become number one on both the pop and R&B charts. \"Duke of Earl\" debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart on January 13, 1962, and held the number-one spot for three weeks. It was on the Hot 100 for a total of 15 weeks. Musicians on the record included Floyd Morris on piano, Lefty Bates, Phil Upchurch and Kermit Chandler on guitar, Al Duncan on drums, and Cliff Davis and John Board on sax.\n\nThe Pearlettes, a girl group, released a cover version of the song (as \"Duchess of Earl\") in 1962, reaching number 96 on the \"Billboard\" chart. Bobbie Smith and the Dream Girls also released an \"answer song\" titled \"Duchess of Earl\" in early 1962; however, the two songs are different in music and lyrics.\n\nAnother cover was recorded by the UK-based doo-wop outfit Darts in 1979. It reached number 6 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn 1988, Australian harmony group \"Dukes of Earlwood featuring Armondo Hurley\" reached number 12 on the Australian charts with a cover of \"Duke of Earl\". The success of the song came after the popularity of a TV commercial for Decoré Shampoo which used an adaptation of \"Duke of Earl\" as its jingle.\n\n"}

She recorded three singles for the label, an unsuccessful first release of \"Forget About Me\" (Motown 1050) being followed by \"My Smile Is Just a Frown (Turned Upside Down)\" (Motown 1064), written by Smokey Robinson. The record reached # 39 on the \"Billboard\" rhythm and blues chart. She also sang backup vocals for some of the Motown artists. Her final record for Motown, \"When Someone's Good To You\" (Motown 1070), released in December 1964, failed to chart and her contract was not renewed, although the record later became a favorite among British soul fans.\n\nA few years later, she joined a girl group, Hodges, James, Smith and Crawford, put together in 1972 by William \"Mickey\" Stevenson. She released two singles with them, \"Nobody\" and \"Let's Pick Up The Pieces\", before leaving the group (which went on to achieve some success as Hodges, James and Smith). She then joined the group Chapter 8, but left them in 1976 to start a solo career; she was replaced in the group by Anita Baker.\n\nIn the late 1970s, and through the early 1980s, she was featured vocalist on several of Hamilton Bohannon's singles and six of his albums, including his biggest US single hit \"Let's Start the Dance\". She also signed a solo contract with Mercury Records (using the spelling Caroline), and released a single \"Coming On Strong\" which reached # 66 on the R&B chart at the start of 1979.

He was the grandson of U.S. Senator John Rutherfurd from 1791 to 1798, and great-grandson of Lewis Morris, the Signer of the Declaration of Independence. Major General William Alexander, the Earl of Stirling, was the uncle of his grandfather.\n\nHe graduated from Williams College, Massachusetts in 1834.\n\nSoon after graduating from Williams, he began practicing law after being admitted to the bar in 1837 with William H. Seward, who eventually served as the United States Secretary of State, in Auburn, New York. In practicing, he associated with Peter A. Jay, the eldest son of the first United States Chief Justice, John Jay, until his death in 1843. At that point, he began working with Hamilton Fish, who also became a U.S. Senator and the U.S. Secretary of State.\n\nIn 1849, Rutherfurd abandoned his study of law to dedicate his leisure to science, particularly astronomy. He performed pioneering work in spectral analysis, and experimented with celestial photography. He invented instruments for his studies, including the micrometer for measuring photographs, a machine for producing improved ruled diffraction gratings, and the first telescope designed specifically for astrophotography.\n\nUsing his instrumentation, Rutherfurd produced a quality collection of photographs of the Sun, Moon, and planets, as well as star clusters and stars down to the fifth magnitude. In 1862, he began making spectroscopic studies using his new diffraction grating. He noticed distinct categories of spectral classes of stars, which Angelo Secchi expanded upon in 1867 to list a set of four stellar classes.\n\nRutherfurd served as a trustee of the Columbia University from 1858 until 1884, and donated his photographs to that institution.\n\nIn 1873, then President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Rutherfurd one of the scientific commission to attend the Vienna Exposition, however, he declined the honor due to previous business engagements in the United States. In 1884, he was named by President Chester A. Arthur as one of the delegates to the International Meridian Conference which met in Washington in October, 1885.\n\nHe was one of the original members of the National Academy of Sciences created in 1863, and was an associate of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nOn July 22, 1841, he married Margaret Stuyvesant Chanler (1820–1890), the daughter of the Rev. Dr. John White Chanler, an Episcopalian clergyman, and Elizabeth Shirreff Winthrop. Margaret's mother was the sister of John Winthrop Chanler (1826–1877), a U.S. Representative, and a 2x great-granddaughter of Wait Winthrop and Joseph Dudley, both prominent colonial American figures. She was also the niece, and adopted daughter, of Helena (nee Rutherfurd) Stuyvesant and Peter Gerard Stuyvesant (1778–1847), the 2x great-grandson of Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch Director-General of New Netherland before it became New York, Together, they were the parents of:\n\n\nIn 1887, his health began to fail.

He also co-founded Science for Peace.\n\nFawcett began his prestigious career in physics with a full scholarship to the University of Cambridge. After graduation, he crossed the Atlantic to take up a post-doctoral fellowship at the National Research Council in Ottawa in 1954. Two years later Fawcett returned to England, where he worked at the Royal Radar Establishment in Malvern. In 1961 he moved to the United States and worked as a research physicist at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey. In 1970, he accepted a Professorship in the Department of Physics at the University of Toronto, where he remained until his retirement in 1993.\n\nBesides first observing cyclotron resonance in metals, Fawcett is credited with discovering the Hall effect in type-II superconductors. While he used many different experimental techniques over his career, including neutron scattering, magnetostriction was a technique that Fawcett especially developed as an effective probe of magnetism in metals and alloys.\n\nIn the 1980s, Eric showed leadership in the international effort to assist physicists (mainly Jewish) in the Soviet Union who had been fired from their positions in leading research institutes and universities and denied access to research facilities. Notable among these was the eminent physicist, Andrei Sakharov. He and other physicists from the West helped these \"refuseniks\" to keep up in current research by organizing seminars in the living rooms and kitchens of cramped apartments in Moscow. KGB agents were all around and Eric later admitted he was often fearful for his own safety.\n\nEric strongly disagreed with Canada's position in NATO. He felt that NATO's militaristic foreign policy was contrary to its ostensibly peaceful objective.\n\nEric also publicly expressed shame over Canada's role in the massacres of East Timor.\n\nFawcett was the co-founder of Science for Peace, a group dedicated towards the goal of universal peace. His dedication to the University of Toronto-based program demonstrated his belief that science should be used to further the cause of worldwide peace.\n\nFawcett's work with the Hall effect in type-II superconductors is still studied today. His name is also carried on by the biannual Eric Fawcett Memorial Forum hosted by Science for Peace.\n\nFawcett was the second son to Harold and Florrie Fawcett, the younger brother of Roy. Eric and Roy attended Queen Elizabeths Grammar School, Blackburn. At various times the family lived in Mellor, in Longridge and on East Park Road and then finally at 2 Tarbert Crescent, Shadsworth, Blackburn. Blackburn was a textile town, and Fawcett's mother, Florrie, had worked in the Sunnyside Mill in Blackburn as a child. This experience led her to drive Eric in his studies. His hard work paid off, as he won a full scholarship to study physics at University of Cambridge. While studying at Cambridge, he met Cambridge native Patricia Egan, his wife-to-be. The two married on 9 October 1954. Together, they moved to Ottawa, where they lived for two years. In 1956 they returned to England, this time moving to Malvern, where their children Clare (1956), Andrew (1958) and Ruth (1961) were born.\n\nIn September 1961 the family relocated to New Jersey, where they lived for ten years before moving north to Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1971, where Eric would spend the rest of his life.\n\nA year after the birth of his first grandchild, Michael, in late 1991, Fawcett chose to retire, doing so in 1993. Fawcett's retirement was a busy one. Three more grandchildren were born, Marc and Peter in 1994, and Robert in 1997. Eric also spent much time practicing yoga and the piano. In the academic world, Fawcett's greatest contribution during his retirement was his work for Science for Peace. A co-founder, he threw himself into the pursuit of world peace through science. In September 2000 he died from liver cancer.\n\n"}

Usually, there is a requirement for someone choosing a career in law to first obtain a law degree or some other form of legal education.\n\nIt is difficult to generalize about the structure of the profession, because\nWhile in civil law countries there are usually distinct clearly defined career paths in law, such as judge, in common law jurisdictions there tends to be one legal profession, and it is not uncommon, for instance, that a requirement for a judge is several years of practising law privately.\n\nHistorically, this has been the first legal specialization. In civil law countries, this is often a lifelong career. In common law legal system, on the other hand, judges are recruited from practising lawyers.\n\nPractising law means advising and representing clients as a private practitioner or in a law firm. In most countries, law graduates need to undergo some sort of apprenticeship, membership in a professional organization and a licence.\n\nThe name for this profession is \"lawyer \"or \"attorney \"in most of the English-speaking world, and \"advocate \"in many other countries. The name for this profession in canon law is \"canonist\" or \"canon lawyer\".\n\nIn civil law countries, but also some common law jurisdictions there is one Law society for all lawyers who want to provide services to the public. But in the United Kingdom and some of its former colonies, there are two quite separate kinds of lawyers providing legal services to the public.\n\nSolicitors advise clients, draft contracts for them and represent them in lower courts of law.\n\nBarristers, also called \"counsels\", are court specialists, who traditionally do not come into contact with their lay clients, but are instructed by solicitors. There is only about a 10% of barristers in most common law jurisdictions.\n\nPeople, who study, organize, teach, and through that also create law, often working at universities, are called jurists. In civil law countries, their role is greater, because they draft codes, which are major laws that govern whole areas of law. In common law countries, the creation and interpretation of law has traditionally been the domain of judges.\n\nA paralegal or legal assistant, according to one definition, is \"a person, qualified by education, training or work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity and who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible.”\n\n"}

Often classified as psychedelic rock, Dungen is also influenced by Swedish (and other) folk music, classic rock, progressive rock, garage rock and alternative rock.\n\nThe band is fronted by singer/composer Gustav Ejstes, who writes all music and plays the majority of instruments on the band's records. Despite this, Dungen plays live as a four-piece. Ejstes, who in his teens started his songwriting with hip hop, is backed live by Swedish progressive rock veteran Reine Fiske (Landberk, Morte Macabre, Paatos, The Amazing) on guitar, bassist Mattias Gustavsson (Life On Earth!), and drummer Johan Holmegard (previously on drums was Fredrik Björling), all of whom have played parts on Dungen's studio albums.\n\nFollowing two vinyl album releases on Swedish record label Subliminal Sounds, Dungen briefly signed to Dolores Recordings (a subset of Virgin Records) in 2002, on which they released the CD \"Stadsvandringar\" and three singles, including one for \"Djungelboken 2\" (the Swedish version of \"The Jungle Book 2\"). Ejstes soon returned to his friend's independent record label Subliminal Sounds, stating that a major label did not feel right because Dungen is not a pop act.\n\nAlthough Dungen's songs are sung entirely in Swedish, 2004's \"Ta det lugnt\" received great acclaim within indie rock circles and established the band's international reputation. This resulted in the band headlining two US tours and landing distribution deals in the US and UK. Dungen also performed their song \"Panda\" on the popular NBC television talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien. In 2006, Dungen played at the famous Bonnaroo Music Festival and has also toured with Wolfmother and the Tucker B's around Australia.\n\nDungen released their fourth studio album, \"Tio bitar\" on 25 April 2007 but did not tour in support of it.\n\nThe group's sixth studio album, entitled \"Skit i allt\", was released in 2010.

Entitled \"Allas Sak\"., the album title translates loosely into \"everyone's thing\" or \"anyone's thing\". Once again, the songs are sung largely in Swedish by Gustav Ejstes. “These songs are my everyday experiences, my thoughts and stories from the life I live,\" he said in a statement. \"I hope people can create their own stories around the music and maybe we can make music together, the listener and I.” The album was an international success, placing at no.14 on Australian publication \"Happy Mag\"'s list of \"The 25 best psychedelic rock albums of the 2010s\" in October 2019.\n\nAround 2014, the group undertook a project to create an instrumental score for the 1926 animated film \"The Adventures of Prince Achmed\" to be performed live with the film. They did so on several occasions in Sweden in 2014 and at the first Marfa Myths Festival in Marfa, Texas, United States.

It is the oldest private military college in the United States. The university was founded in 1819 at Norwich, Vermont, as the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy. It is the oldest of six senior military colleges and is recognized by the United States Department of Defense as the \"Birthplace of ROTC\" (Reserve Officers' Training Corps).\n\nThe university was founded in 1819 at Norwich, Vermont by Captain Alden Partridge, military educator and former superintendent of West Point. Partridge believed in the \"American System of Education,\" a traditional liberal arts curriculum with instruction in civil engineering and military science. After leaving West Point because of congressional disapproval of his system, he returned to his native state of Vermont to create the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy. Partridge, in founding the academy, rebelled against the reforms of Sylvanus Thayer to prevent the rise of what he saw as the greatest threat to the security of the young republic: an aristocratic and careerist officer class. He believed that a well-trained militia was an urgent necessity and developed the American system around that idea. His academy became the inspiration for a number of military colleges throughout the nation, including The Citadel, and later the land grant colleges created through the Morrill Act of 1862. Today, Norwich offers substantial online distance graduate programs and is similar in many regards to The Citadel in mission, online offerings, student body composition, and size.\nAll entering freshman entering the Corps of Cadets are called \"Rooks\" and their first year at Norwich is called \"Rookdom\". The institution of \"Rookdom\" consists of two three-month processes that mold civilians into Norwich Cadets: Rook Basic Training and Basic Leadership Training. Culmination of Rook Basic Training marks the halfway point toward Recognition and occurs before Thanksgiving break, after which Rooks are awarded privileges. Recognition into the Corps of Cadets typically occurs around the eighteenth week.\n\nPartridge's educational beliefs were considered radical at the time, and this led to his conflicting views with the federal government while he was the superintendent of West Point. Upon creation of his own school, he immediately incorporated classes of agriculture and modern languages in addition to the sciences, liberal arts, and various military subjects. Field exercises, for which Partridge borrowed cannon and muskets from the federal and state governments, supplemented classroom instruction and added an element of realism to the college’s program of well-rounded military education.\n\nPartridge founded seven other military institutions during his quest to reform the fledgling United States military. They were the Virginia Literary, Scientific and Military Academy at Portsmouth, Virginia (1839–1846), Pennsylvania Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy at Bristol, Pennsylvania (1842–1845), Pennsylvania Military Institute at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (1845–1848), Wilmington Literary, Scientific and Military Academy at Wilmington, Delaware (1846–1848), the Scientific and Military Collegiate Institute at Reading, Pennsylvania (1850–1854), Gymnasium and Military Institute at Pembroke, New Hampshire (1850–1853) and the National Scientific and Military Academy at Brandywine Springs, Delaware (1853).\n\nIn 1825 the academy moved to Middletown, Connecticut, to provide better naval training to the school's growing Corps of Cadets. Beginning in 1826, the academy offered the first program of courses in civil engineering in the US. In 1829, the state of Connecticut declined to grant Captain Partridge a charter and he moved the school back to Norwich (the Middletown campus became Wesleyan University in 1831). In 1834, Vermont granted a charter and recognized the institution as Norwich University. During the 1856 academic year, the first chapter of the Theta Chi Fraternity was founded by cadets Frederick Norton Freeman and Arthur Chase. With the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, Norwich cadets served as instructors of the state militias throughout the Northeast and the entire class of 1862 enlisted upon its graduation. Norwich turned out hundreds of officers and soldiers who served with the federal armies in the American Civil War, including four recipients of the Medal of Honor. One graduate led a corps, seven more headed divisions, 21 commanded brigades, 38 led regiments, and various alumni served in 131 different regimental organizations. In addition, these men were eyewitnesses to some of the war's most dramatic events, including the bloodiest day of the conflict at Antietam, the attack up Marye's Heights at Fredericksburg, and the repulse of Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg. Seven hundred and fifty Norwich men served in the Civil War, of whom an estimated fifty-six fought for the Confederacy. Because of the university's participation in the struggle, the number of students dwindled to seven in the class of 1864 alone.\n\nThe Confederate raid on St. Albans, Vermont precipitated fear that Newport, Vermont was an imminent target. The Corps of Cadets quickly boarded an express train for Newport, the same day, October 19, 1864, to the great relief of the inhabitants.\n\nAfter a catastrophic fire in 1866 which devastated the Old South Barracks and the entire Military Academy, the town of Northfield welcomed the struggling school. The Civil War, the fire, and the uncertainty regarding the continuation of the university seriously lowered the attendance, and the school opened in the fall of 1866 with only 19 students. The 1870s and 1880s saw many financially turbulent times for the institution and the renaming of the school to Lewis College in 1880. In 1881, the student body was reduced to only a dozen men. By 1884, the Vermont Legislature had the name of the school changed back to Norwich. In the 1890s, the United States Army and Norwich expanded their collaboration, including the two-year appointment of career officer Jesse McI. Carter as an instructor and Commandant of Cadets. In 1898 the university was designated as the Military College of the State of Vermont.\n\nAs part of the Vermont National Guard, the school's Corps of Cadets was mobilized as a squadron of cavalry in the First Vermont Regiment to assist in General John J. Pershing's Mexican Expedition. This greatly disrupted the academic year and in 1916 the War Department designated Norwich as the first site for a Senior ROTC cavalry unit; also in 1916, the first African-American to attend the university, Harold \"Doc\" Martin (NU 1920), matriculated. Classes graduated early for both the First and Second World Wars and many Norwich-made officers saw service in all theaters of both conflicts. Professional education offered at Norwich also changed and adapted with the advance of technology. Military flight training began in 1939 and from 1946 to 1947, horse cavalry was completely phased out in favor of armored cavalry.\n\nGraduates returning from European and Pacific fields of battle found a university very different from the one they had left behind. From the late 1940s to the 1960s, Norwich was greatly expanded and added a number of new opportunities. In 1947, the Army Department created a new program uniquely suited to Vermont's harsh climate: a mountain and cold weather warfare unit. Air Force and Navy ROTC programs were established in 1972 and 1984 respectively. During the 1974 school year, the university admitted women into the Corps of Cadets, two years before the federal service academies. The 1972 merger and 1993 integration with Vermont College added two groups to \"the Hill,\" women and civilian students. In 2001, Norwich sold its Vermont College campus and non-traditional degree programs to the Union Institute and University. Vermont College's arts programs were spun off as the once again independent Vermont College of Fine Arts in 2008.\n\nPrior to the 2009–2010 school year companies consisted of one upperclassmen platoon and one freshmen platoon, with each platoon consisting of three squads. The companies in the original system were Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel, India, Kilo, Lima, Mike, Band, Drill Team, Military Police and Artillery. The companies Alpha through Mike were known as \"line companies\", and were part of Battalions 1, 2, 3 and 4. Band, Drill Team, Military Police and Artillery were placed in Provisional Battalion. Under this traditional system a cadet could spend his entire time at the school in one company. While this had the benefit of creating unique cultures and traditions in each company, and strengthened the bond each cadet had with his/her fellow \"Rook Buddies\" and the Corps and school at large, sometimes long-standing company traditions would lead to fraternity-like hazing and eventually challenge the authority of the Corps chain of command.\n\nIn 2009, the Provisional Artillery Company was deactivated.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, hazing of undergraduates by upperclassmen was normal in all military schools and many non-military ones as well. Hazing diminished in the early 20th century. By the late 20th century, it became not only counter to university rules but illegal as well. Nevertheless, there were several reported instances of hazing in 1990 and 1995.\n\nIn 1910 Ainsworth Hall was constructed for the United States Weather Bureau as its central Vermont station. Returned to the university in 1948, it served as the administrative headquarters of the campus. By 1955, growth of the university forced the relocation of the administration back up the hill to Dewey Hall. When also in 1955 construction began on Webb Hall to the immediate west of the building, the infirmary moved into the now empty structure. Due to an expansion of the university in the 1960s and 1970s the building was converted into the home of the Division of Social Sciences. The building is named for Mrs. Laura Ainsworth, widow of Captain James E. Ainsworth (NU 1853), who in 1915 worked to bring an infirmary to campus.\n\nChaplin Hall, originally Carnegie Hall, was built in 1907. The School of Architecture + Art is located there. Paid for by Andrew Carnegie, the building served as the university's library until 1993 with the construction of Kreitzberg Library. When the library was renovated in 1952, from the contributions of trustee Henry P. Chaplin, it was rededicated as the Henry Prescott Chaplin Memorial Library. Until 1941 and the addition of Partridge Hall to the growing campus, Chaplin Hall also provided the classrooms and offices for the Department of Electrical Engineering.\n\nThis building, on the site of the first building in Northfield Center, contains the offices and classrooms of the Communications Department. The offices for the school newspaper \"The Guidon\" and the studios for the university's radio station WNUB-FM are also located in this building. The building was purchased by the university in 1973 and restored in 1988.\n\nNamed for Admiral of the Navy George Dewey (NU 1852–1854), and completed in 1902, Dewey Hall is one of the oldest buildings in the Northfield campus. It was originally two stories high with the lower floor occupied by offices of the university's administration, the library and museum. Office space for trustees and faculty, a chapel with a seating of five hundred and the United States Weather Bureau were located on the second floor. With the departure of the Weather Bureau in 1909 and the completion of the then new Carnegie Library in 1907, the Hall was primarily used by the Military Department. In October 1925 a fire gutted the building which led to its reconstruction as a three-story structure.\n\nHollis House is today the location of a number of classrooms and offices of the College of Liberal Arts. Built in 1852, the building was until 1909 the house of a number of prominent residents of Northfield. When sold that year to the university, it became part of the US Weather Bureau's station collocated on campus. The building was later named for David B. \"Dixie\" Hollis (NU 1922) who upon his death in 1993 gave what was then the largest donation in the university's history: $7 million.\n\nThe Engineering, Math and Science Complex houses the David Crawford School of Engineering as well as the departments of Geology, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Mathematics and Sports Medicine. An addition of Nursing was completed in 2011. The complex (known as the \"U\" building) is composed of six sections: Juckett, Partridge and Tompkins Halls, the Science Building, Bartolleto Hall and the Cabot Annex. The complex was completed in 1997 and replaced a previous set of 1940s- and 1950s-era facilities. The Engineering, Math and Science Complex also contains the university's Information Technology Services office.\n\nKreitzberg Library is named in recognition of Barbara and Chairman of the Board of Trustees Fred Kreitzberg (NU 1957). The library has a catalog of more than 240,000 books, about 45,000 electronic journals, and a collection of federal government publications. The Norwich University Archives and Special Collections has rare books and unique source materials relating to military history, the history of Vermont, and the history of the university. The library was designed by Perry Dean Rogers Architects. It was completed in 1993 at a cost of $8.1 million. In 2015, a renovation project brought the library into the twenty-first century with enhancements including new workstations, group-study and collaborative-learning areas, new technology-enabled classrooms, and a café. Additional improvements include two new conference rooms, a 77 percent increase in the number of seats, and an increase in data speeds.\n\nWebb Hall was completed in 1960 and originally housed the English, Modern Languages, Social Sciences, Business Administration and the Psychology and Education departments. Dole Auditorium, which seated over four hundred people, was located in Webb Hall. The building is named after J. Watson Webb, a Norwich trustee. The auditorium honored Charles Dole (NU 1869), who served in his career at the university as an instructor in mathematics and Latin, a professor of history and rhetoric, the commandant of cadets and acting president of the university from 1895 to 1896. In 2017, Webb Hall underwent a major renovation that included the dismantling of Dole Auditorium. Following the commencement of the spring semester in 2019, Norwich University completed renovations on Webb Hall, now known as North Hall.\n\n\n\n\nAndrews Hall, built in 1980, houses the Department of Athletics. In addition, it has basketball and racquetball courts and the equipment and athletic training rooms for the university's varsity and intramural teams. The Athletic Hall of Fame is also located in Andrews Hall. The facility honors trustee Paul R. Andrews (NU 1930).\n\nKreitzberg Arena is home to the men’s and women’s varsity ice hockey teams, as well as the school’s club team.\n\nThe armory, built in 1928, is named to honor a notable 1896 graduate of the university, Charles A. Plumley. Plumley served as the president of the university from 1930 to 1934 when he was elected to Congress as Vermont's sole representative from 1934 to 1951. The main floor of the building provides seating space for 4,000 in an area as large as three basketball courts. There is an elevated running track as well as locker rooms, training rooms, and Navy ROTC offices in the basement. Connected to the armory is Goodyear Pool. Built in 1962, the pool is a 25 x 14 yard 6 lane facility that is open to all university members.\n\n\nDedicated in 1921, Sabine Field was originally a venue for football, baseball, track, and outdoor ice hockey. Over time, as hockey moved indoors and baseball found its own home at Garrity Field, Sabine continued to serve the university football and cross country teams. Then in 2013, a renovation transformed Sabine Field into a multi-sport, multi-activity, lit stadium that can be used in most weather conditions. The improvements included synthetic turf field that meets NCAA regulations for football, soccer, and lacrosse, a 400-meter resilient urethane running track with 42-inch lanes, energy-efficient stadium lights, a new sound system, bleachers, and press box, and other upgrades. On October 4, 2013, Sabine Field was officially renamed to Sabine Field at Haynes Family Stadium. Sabine Field was dedicated in 1921 in honor of the memory of 1868 graduate Dr. George K. Sabine’s son, George K. Sabine Jr., who died shortly after returning from overseas.\n\nShapiro Field House, built in 1987 and named for trustee Jacob Shapiro (NU 1936), houses a multipurpose arena that has a 200-meter indoor running track, four tennis courts, and a climbing wall. It is also used for morning PT (Physical Training), athletic practices, Commencement, concerts and other university functions.\n\nThe Harmon Memorial is a tribute to Major General Ernest Harmon, who attended Norwich University from 1912 to 1913 and was later president from 1950 to 1968. Recorded on the memorial, by year of death, are the names of alumni, faculty, staff, and friends of Norwich University that have made a \"significant contribution\" to the university.\n\nHarmon Hall opened in 1955 and later enlarged in 1958. Since then, it has served as the focal point for student life and activities. The campus mess hall, bookstore, post office, and The Mill (a snack bar open to Corps upperclassmen and civilians) are located on the lower two floors. The Foreign Student Office, Student Activities, Yearbook Office, Music Program offices, a game room, and a lounge were located on the top floor. This floor originally housed the departments of English, History, and Modern Languages until they were moved to Webb Hall in 1960. Harmon Hall was renovated in 2007. The addition onto Harmon Hall is named the Wise Campus Center.\n\nNorwich University moved to Northfield from Norwich, Vermont, in 1866 when the South Barracks at the older location were destroyed by fire. Old Jackman Hall was the first building to be constructed at the new central Vermont site. The building was erected in 1868, and named Jackman Hall in 1907 to honor Brigadier General Alonzo Jackman (NU 1836) a faculty member, proponent of the Transatlantic telegraph cable and militia Brigadier General during the American Civil War. From its construction till 1905 the building served as housing for cadets. In the mid-1950s Jackman Hall was extensively remodeled and modernized, however, it became apparent that the almost century-old barracks were too costly to maintain. It was decided that rather than pay for near continual upkeep to build a new hall on the same site. As many newer barracks had been built since its original construction it was decided that the new Jackman Hall would serve as the primary administration building. Currently the Army and Air Force ROTC departments are also housed in Jackman Hall.\n\n\nConstructed by a gift from Eugene L. White (NU 1914), a trustee, the chapel was completed in 1941. Originally designed as a multi-purpose building, then White Hall has served as a mess hall with a dining room, lunch room, kitchen, a college store and a recreational room. White Hall was converted to the university's first single-purpose chapel after Harmon Hall was opened in 1955. There are two bronze plaques on the walls that honor the Norwich war dead. Weekly services include Catholic Mass on Wednesday and Sunday, non-denominational service on Sunday, and Islamic prayer on Friday.\n\nOne of the newer buildings on the campus, the Sullivan Museum was opened January 22, 2007. The building is named after General Gordon R. Sullivan (ret.), Norwich class of 1959 and former U.S. Army Chief of Staff. The Sullivan Museum houses state-of-the-art conservation, storage, and display facilities for the wide variety of Norwich University artifacts and memorabilia. Items currently displayed cover a wide spectrum of Norwich history, including uniforms worn by Alden Partridge and Alonzo Jackman to pieces from more recent history.\n\nNorwich university has more than 4,000 students, including over 2,500 traditional undergraduate students and more than 1,500 in the university’s online programs, which includes nearly 800 graduate students and over 700 in undergraduate degree-completion programs. As of 2018, Norwich University has 162 full-time faculty and more than 200 part-time faculty. In attendance in 2018 are 81 international students and scholars and exchange students, representing 30 countries.\n\nConcurrent service for cadets in the Vermont State Guard is permitted. Students normally serve with the 3rd Battalion based out of the Vermont National Guard Armoury in nearby Berlin, VT.\n\nThe Norwich Cadet’s Creed\n\nI believe that the cardinal virtues of the individual are courage, honesty, temperance and wisdom; and that the true measure of success is service rendered—to God, to Country, and to Mankind.\n\nI believe that the fundamental problem of society is to maintain a free government wherein liberty may be secured through obedience to law, and that a citizen soldiery is the cornerstone upon which such a government must rest.\n\nI believe that real education presupposes a sense of proportion in physical, mental, and moral development; and that he alone is educated who has learned the lessons of self-control and open-mindedness.\n\nI believe in Norwich, my Alma Mater, because within her halls throughout the years these tenets have found expression while men have been taught to be loyal to duly constituted authority in thought and word and deed; to view suffrage as a sacred privilege to be exercised only in accordance with the dictates of conscience; to regard public office as a public trust; and finally to fight, and if need be to die, in defense of the cherished institutions of America.\n\nOrganization\n\nCadet officers and non-commissioned officers command the Corps of Cadets. As leaders, they are responsible for the day-to-day administration, operation, training and discipline of the Corps. Norwich is one of six senior military colleges in the country recognized by Title 10 of the U.S. Code, Section 2111a(f). This entitles eligible ROTC graduates to active duty service if they so choose. Until 2018, the Corps was structured as a regiment commanded by a cadet colonel (C/COL) with five battalions each commanded by a cadet lieutenant colonel (C/LTC) and a Headquarters company commanded by a cadet major. 1st, 2nd, and provisional battalions were composed of companies of upperclassmen commanded by a cadet captain with two or three platoons per company. 3rd and 4th Battalion were freshman training battalions and were composed of three companies of three platoons each. This structure was put in place for the 2009–2010 school year, replacing the more traditional \"Original Company\" system.\n\nStarting in fall of 2018, the Corps of Cadets will be reorganized as a regiment, still commanded by a cadet colonel, having only three battalions (1st, 2nd, and Provisional), commanded each by a C/LTC (Headquarters Company now falls under the command of Provisional Battalion). In addition to having two upperclassmen companies (of three platoons each), both line battalions will also contain freshman training companies (consisting of four platoons each). Provisional Battalion will now house Headquarters Company and one freshman training company (containing two platoons) in addition to its original three specialty units.\n\nThis change creates a “sister company” partnership with upper-class companies and the Rook training companies (CTC 1 partnered with A Co etc.). This “sister company” construct creates a partnership between a Rook Training Company and an upper-class company. For instance, if a Rook is in CTC 1 his first year, he will matriculate to A Co. his second and subsequent years. A Co.supports CTC 1 in training and has a vested interest in CTC 1’s success because the Rooks in that Company will be members of A Co. the following year.\n\nNew Corps structure (Fall 2018 onwards):\nNorwich University Corps of Cadets rank insignia follows West Point with the use of chevrons to show all cadet ranks in lieu of chevrons, disks & lozenges. Any recognized cadet defaults to the rank of private if they hold no job responsibilities in the Corps of Cadets.\n\nRanks are as follows:\n\nThe college has several special units that are supervised by federal ROTC units. The Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (AROTC) detachment contains the Norwich Artillery Battery, the Norwich Ranger Company, the Ranger Challenge team, and the Mountain Cold Weather Company. The NROTC detachment sponsors a chapter of the Semper Fidelis Society and Golden Anchor Society.\n\nNorwich has 29 majors across six academic divisions with the most popular major being criminal justice.\n\nThe College of Graduate and Continuing Studies oversees the university's online graduate programs as well as six online bachelor's degree completion programs. The majority of the graduate programs are conducted on a distance learning platform. The university offers accredited and highly recognized programs in a range of fields including diplomacy, international relations, military history, history, business administration, civil engineering, criminal justice, public administration, information security and assurance, leadership, nursing and strategic studies.\n\nNorwich offers 12 online graduate programs, including a combined 5-year Master of Architecture program, and, since 2001, a National Security Agency-sponsored Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education.\n\nNorwich was ranked by \"U.S. News & World Report\" in 2014 at 74th in the Regional Universities (North) category.\n\nNorwich offers 20 varsity sports, including baseball, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, football, men's and women's ice hockey, men's and women's lacrosse, men's and women's rugby, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's swimming and diving, softball, men's tennis, wrestling, and women's volleyball. The Cadets compete at the NCAA Division III level and are affiliated in four conferences, mainly the Great Northeast Athletic Conference (GNAC) and the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference. The football team joined the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference in 2017. The college also has a number of student clubs for sports such as golf, paintball, fencing, horseback riding etc.\n\nThe Cadets first fielded a football team in 1893. Among early notable moments is a 28–6 loss to Boston College at Fenway Park in 1914, the first college football game ever played at that venue. Overall, the program has appeared in seven ECAC bowl games (1984, 2003, 2004, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014) and two NCAA tournaments (2011, 2015). Norwich has produced 16 All-Americans, and has won or shared four Eastern Collegiate Football Conference (ECFC) Championships (2009, 2011, 2013–shared with Gallaudet University, 2015). Six former Cadets have reached an NFL camp.\n\nNorwich was a member of the ECFC from 2009 to 2016, and departed the league with a 46–10 record in conference games. In 2017, Norwich joined the NEWMAC as an affiliate member for football.\n\nThe Cadets' home field is Sabine Field at Haynes Family Stadium. The field underwent a massive renovation for the 2013 season, transitioning from grass to turf, and adding lights for night contests. Campus folklore includes a tale of a ghost of an old cavalry cadet who guards the gate to the stadium.\n\nNorwich's most prominent football rivals include Middlebury College, Castleton University, and the United States Coast Guard Academy.Norwich also plays long-time opponent St. Lawrence University for an annual trophy. The series with Middlebury concluded after the 1991 season, after 99 contests, with the NESCAC's decision to eliminate non-conference football competition. Castleton founded their football program in 2009, and the Norwich game quickly became an intense rivalry. The Norwich/Coast Guard series (the Little Army/Navy Game) had been dormant after the 2005 game, but resumed again in 2017.\n\nAll these rivalry games involve a traveling trophy awarded to the winner:\n\nWomen's rugby has existed at Norwich since 1985 and gained a varsity status in 2008. They won the inaugural USA Rugby Collegiate Division II National Championship in the spring of 2012 and a USA Rugby Collegiate Division 1 National Sevens Title in the fall of 2011.\n\nMen's ice hockey began play in 1909 and has become a national powerhouse. The program has won regular season conference championships in 20 of the last 22 seasons. The Cadets have won four NCAA Division III Men's Ice Hockey Championship titles (2000, 2003, 2010, and 2017). The program has reached the NCAA Division III Frozen Four 13 times. Dozens of players have gone on to professional careers, and three alumni have reached the NHL (Frank Simonetti, Keith Aucoin, Kurtis McLean).\n\nIn 2007–08 Norwich women's ice hockey was elevated to varsity status. A year later, the Cadets won their first-ever ECAC East conference championship and advanced to the NCAA Division III Women's Ice Hockey tournament. They have won 8 conference championships, and have reached 7 final fours. Norwich won the program's first NCAA Division III title in 2011, and won again in 2018.\n\nWomen's lacrosse program gained varsity status in 2008. They won 3 consecutive Great Northeast Athletic Conference Titles (2010, 2011, 2012), advancing to the NCAA Division III Tournament each time.\n\nRifle team won the national intercollegiate rifle championship in 1916 and 1920. It is no longer a sport at the school.\n\nRifle (2):\n1916, 1920\n\nWomen's Rugby (6):\n2011 Division I Sevens (USA Rugby), 2012 Division II 15s (USA Rugby), 2012 Division I Sevens (USA Rugby), 2013 Division I Sevens (USA Rugby), 2013 Division I 15s (ACRA), 2014 Division I Sevens (ACRA)\n\nMen's Hockey (4):\n2000, 2003, 2010, 2017\n\nWomen's Hockey (2):\n2011, 2018\n\nDrill Team: 2009\n\n138 graduates of Norwich University have served as general officers in the U.S. armed forces: 102 Army generals, 12 Air Force generals, 9 Marine Corps generals, and 16 Navy admirals. 26 graduates served as generals in foreign armies: 9 Royal Thai Army generals, 1 Royal Thai Air Force general, and 16 Republic of China Army generals.\n\nAmong the notable military graduates and former students of Norwich are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe presidents of Norwich University include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2063668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2063668", "title": "Dos (band)", "text": "Dos (band)\n\ndos (from the Spanish word for \"two\") is an American rock group composed of Mike Watt and Kira Roessler, who both sing and play bass guitar. Critic Greg Prato describes their unusual instrumentation as \"a haunting yet intriguing and original sound.\"\n\nBoth performers have substantial experience in pioneering punk groups: Watt has been a member of The Reactionaries, Minutemen, Firehose, Banyan and the reunited lineup of The Stooges, while Roessler was in Black Flag for about two years.\n\nWatt and Roessler met not long after Roessler replaced Chuck Dukowski as the bassist of Black Flag in 1983.\n\nThe actual origin of dos came about in the fall of 1985 when Watt and Kira, who were already dating, began improvising two-bass jams in their free time, sometimes recording these results into Watt's four-track recording machine.\n\nThe sudden death of Minutemen guitarist and lead singer D. Boon in a van accident on December 22, 1985, led to the end of the Minutemen and left Watt deeply depressed. Kira had parted company with Black Flag not long beforehand and moved to New Haven, Connecticut to attend Yale University. Watt considered abandoning music altogether. But intending to keep him playing after Boon's death, Kira and Watt began collaborating via four-track cassettes sent back and forth in the mail. The activity led to Kira flying back to California to formally work on dos in September 1986.\n\nThey recorded their first album, an all-instrumental affair save for Kira's closing track, \"Taking Away The Fire\", almost immediately, and made their performing debut as dos opening for ex-Black Flag guitarist Greg Ginn's instrumental group Gone that same week. Watt released dos' eponymous first album, \"dos\" on New Alliance Records, the label he had formed with D. Boon in 1981. Around the same time, Watt formed Firehose; many of the songs on Firehose's first album \"Ragin', Full On\", are actually dos songs with lyrics added (by either Watt or Kira) and rearranged for a power trio format.\n\nIn 1987, Watt and Roessler married, but they divorced seven years later around the time that Firehose broke up.\n\nIn 1989 dos recorded a six-song EP, \"Numero Dos\". This release, which featured three vocals by Kira and one by Watt, would be combined with the 1986 LP to become the \"uno con dos\" CD almost immediately afterward. Around this same time, Kira moved back to California and married Watt.\n\nDos rarely tour extensively, owing to both Watt's other commitments, and to Kira's decision to work full-time, first as a computer programmer and then, currently as a movie sound designer and foley artist. Most dos \"tours\" have been short, three-to-five-day affairs that would either see Kira flying to meet Watt on the road where they would sometimes open for Firehose, or, less frequently, on their own.\n\nDos' recorded and live repertoire consists of both original instrumentals (some of which would later have lyrics added to them to become Firehose or Watt solo songs), some original vocal pieces, and cover versions sung primarily by Kira and rearranged for their two basses. Songs by Billie Holiday (\"Don't Explain\", \"Down In The Dumps\"), Patsy Cline (\"Imagine That\", \"I Fall to Pieces\"), Sonic Youth (\"Pacific Coast Highway\"), Selena (\"No Me Quedo Mas\"), and even The Minutemen (a rearranged \"Do You Want New Wave Or Do You Want The Truth?\" from their classic \"Double Nickels On The Dime\" album) have found their way into dos' back catalog and live set list.\n\nWatt and Kira's marriage ended amicably in 1994, around the same time Firehose disbanded. The two remained friends and subsequently, chose to continue with dos. They began writing and recording their third album, \"Justamente Tres\", not long afterward; it would be released in 1996 in between Watt's first two solo albums.\n\nIn 2003, Watt set up a Pro Tools recording setup in his apartment that he nicknamed Studio Thunderpants, primarily for the purpose of recording his own song demos. Watt and Kira began recording the fourth dos album there at this time, in between Watt's professional commitments as a solo artist and member of Iggy Pop & The Stooges and Banyan, and Kira's day job.\n\nIn June 2004 dos did their first mini-tour in several years, doing three gigs at jazz festivals in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Canada, right before Watt had to fly to Europe for a tour with the reunited Stooges.\n\nThe fourth Dos album, \"dos y dos\" was recorded at different sessions between 2002 and 2005 at Watt's own home studio, Studio Thunderpants, and later mixed by Yuka Honda. It became the second release on Watt's clenchedwrench label in 2011.\n\nEvery December, dos play a benefit show at the Sacred Grounds Coffee House in Watt's hometown of San Pedro, California for Toberman House.\n\n\n"}

The newspaper was founded in 2003 by Jed Morey after then parent company, Morey Publishing, bought \"The Island Ear\", which was a free bi-monthly entertainment-oriented newspaper. Morey Publishing renamed the paper, using the same name of a daily newspaper that was forced out of business in 1977, and launched it as a free alternative newsweekly. The staff of the \"Press\" included former \"Newsday\" columnist Ed Lowe, television columnist Todd Hyman, and technology columnist Lazlow Jones.\n\nOn March 24, 2011, New York City's \"Daily News\" and \"Long Island Press\" announced that the News would print the Press on its state-of-the-art, high-volume, full-color press equipment. In 2014 the \"Long Island Press\" ceased printing of its paper to focus solely on their website. \n\nIn April 2017, the publication was acquired by Schneps Communications. In July 2017, it was announced that the publication would return to print in September 2017 as a free news and lifestyle monthly.\n\nThe alternative weekly print version of the \"Long Island Press\" won more than 300 awards throughout its 10 years in existence, including accolades from the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies (AAN), Fair Media Council, Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ), Press Club of Long Island (PCLI), Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, Journalism Center on Children & Families, Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, and Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation. The paper was awarded the New York Press Association's top prize, the prestigious Stuart C. Dorman Award for Editorial Excellence, in 2010 and 2012, making it the association's \"Newspaper of the Year\" two out of three years.\n\nThe \"Long Island Press\" was also the name of a daily newspaper that lasted for 156 years. It was originally known as the \"Long Island Farmer\" which was founded in 1821. The paper changed its name to \"The Long Island Daily Press\" in 1921, then shortened it to \"Long Island Press\" in 1967. The Sunday edition bore the name \"Long Island Sunday Press\". Both editions used a broadsheet format. It became known as the only New York paper to report on local government scandals until an extended strike by the Printing Pressmen's union forced the paper to go out of business on March 25, 1977. Regular columnists included Walter Kaner.\n\nThe Archives (formerly the Long Island Division) at the Queens Library has microfilm of the \"Long Island Daily Press\" from 1921 to 1977, and of the \"Long Island Farmer\" from 1821 to 1920. The Queens Library Archives also has a collection of approximately 3,000 photographs from the \"Long Island Daily Press\" photo morgue.

It was originally introduced in 1971 (as \"coldness function\") by , one of the proponents of the rational thermodynamics school of thought, based on earlier proposals for a \"reciprocal temperature\" function.\n\nThermodynamic beta has units reciprocal to that of energy (in SI units, formula_2). In non-thermal units, it can also be measured in byte per joule, or more conveniently, gigabyte per nanojoule; 1 K is equivalent to about 13,062 gigabytes per nanojoule; at room temperature: = 300K, β ≈ ≈ ≈ .\n\nThermodynamic beta is essentially the connection between the information theory and statistical mechanics interpretation of a physical system through its entropy and the thermodynamics associated with its energy. It expresses the response of entropy to an increase in energy. If a system is challenged with a small amount of energy, then \"β\" describes the amount the system will randomize.\n\nVia the statistical definition of temperature as a function of entropy, the coldness function can be calculated in the microcanonical ensemble from the formula\n(i.e., the partial derivative of the entropy with respect to the energy at constant volume and particle number ).\n\nThough completely equivalent in conceptual content to temperature, is generally considered a more fundamental quantity than temperature owing to the phenomenon of negative temperature, in which is continuous as it crosses zero whereas has a singularity.\n\nFrom the statistical point of view, \"β\" is a numerical quantity relating two macroscopic systems in equilibrium. The exact formulation is as follows. Consider two systems, 1 and 2, in thermal contact, with respective energies \"E\" and \"E\". We assume \"E\" + \"E\" = some constant \"E\". The number of microstates of each system will be denoted by Ω and Ω. Under our assumptions Ω depends only on \"E\". Thus the number of microstates for the combined system is\n\nWe will derive \"β\" from the fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics:\n\n(In other words, the system naturally seeks the maximum number of microstates.) Therefore, at equilibrium,\n\nBut \"E\" + \"E\" = \"E\" implies\n\nSo\n\ni.e.\n\nThe above relation motivates a definition of \"β\":\n\nWhen two systems are in equilibrium, they have the same thermodynamic temperature \"T\". Thus intuitively, one would expect \"β\" (as defined via microstates) to be related to \"T\" in some way. This link is provided by Boltzmann's fundamental assumption written as\n\nwhere \"k\" is the Boltzmann constant, \"S\" is the classical thermodynamic entropy, and Ω is the number of microstates. So\n\nSubstituting into the definition of \"β\" from the statistical definition above gives\n\nComparing with thermodynamic formula\n\nwe have\n\nwhere formula_15 is called the \"fundamental temperature\" of the system, and has units of energy.\n\n"}

His nomen \"k3š-t3\" (transcribed as Kashta, possibly pronounced /kuʔʃi-taʔ/) \"of the land of Kush\" is often translated directly as \"The Kushite\". He was succeeded by Piye, who would go on to conquer ancient Egypt and establish the Twenty-Fifth dynasty there.\n\nKashta is thought to be a brother of his predecessor Alara. Both Alara and Kashta were thought to have married their sisters. These theories date back to the work of Dunham and Macadam, but Morkot points out that there is no clear evidence to support these assumptions.\n\nKashta's only known wife was Pebatjma. Several children and possible children are recorded:\n\nWhile Kashta ruled Nubia from Napata, which is 400 km north of Khartoum, the modern capital of Sudan, he also exercised a strong degree of control over Upper Egypt by managing to install his daughter, Amenirdis I, as the presumptive God's Wife of Amun in Thebes in line to succeed the serving Divine Adoratrice of Amun, Shepenupet I, Osorkon III's daughter. This development was \"the key moment in the process of the extension of Kushite power over Egyptian territories\" under Kashta's rule since it officially legitimized the Kushite takeover of the Thebaid region. The Hungarian Kushite scholar, László Török, notes that there were probably already Kushite garrisons stationed in Thebes itself during Kashta's reign both to protect this king's authority over Upper Egypt and to thwart a possible future invasion of this region from Lower Egypt.\n\nTörök observes that Kashta's appearance as King of Upper and Lower Egypt and peaceful takeover of Upper Egypt is suggested both \"by the fact that the descendants of Osorkon III, Takelot III and Rudamun continued to enjoy a high social status in Thebes in the second half of the 8th and in the first half of the 7th century\" [BCE] as is shown by their burials in this city as well as the joint activity between the Divine Adoratrice Shepenupet I and the god's Wife of Amun Elect Amenirdis I, Kashta's daughter. A stela from Kashta's reign has been found in Elephantine (modern day Aswan)--at the local temple dedicated to the god Khnum—which attests to his control of this region. It bears his royal name or prenomen: Nimaatre. Egyptologists today believe that either he or more likely Piye was the Year 12 Nubian king mentioned in a well-known inscription at Wadi Gasus which associates the Adopted god's Adoratice of Amun, Amenirdis, Kashta's daughter together with Year 19 of the serving God's Wife of Amun, Shepenupet. Kashta's reign length is unknown. Some sources credit Kashta as the founder of the 25th dynasty since he was the first Kushite king known to have expanded his kingdom's influence into Upper Egypt. Under Kashta's reign, the native Kushite population of his kingdom, situated between the third and fourth Cataracts of the Nile, became rapidly 'Egyptianized' and adopted Egyptian traditions, religion and culture. Kashta's successor was Piye.\n\nThe pyramids of el-Kurru contain the tombs of Kashta and several of his successors. The highest part of the cemetery contains 4 tumulus tombs (Tum.1,2,4 and 5). To the east of the tumulus tombs we find a row of at least eight pyramids. One of them partially intrudes on a tumulus tomb (Tum.19). The southernmost of this row of pyramids belong to Kashta (presumably to) his wife Pebatjma. Before this row is another row of pyramids which includes those of Piye, Shabaka and Tanutamani.<br>\nTo the south of the (presumed) pyramid of Pebatjma one has to cross the southern wadi to reach the southern pyramids. These are the pyramids of the Queens: Naparaye (K.3), Khensa (K.4), Qalhata (K.5), and Arty (K.6).\n"}

The band dissolved when members Rick Rozz, Bill Andrews and Terry Butler left to join a later inception of Chuck Schuldiner's Death; however, the subsequent citing of Massacre as influences by bands such as Napalm Death signified a great interest in the defunct act within the death metal community. This led to a reformation and the recording of the album \"From Beyond\" on Earache Records, made up mainly of reworking of the songs featured on the original 1985 & 1986 demo tapes.\n\nLee also played drums in both Mantas and Death as well as vocals. He has also been a member of many other short-lived bands. In 2006 he joined a band with Terry Butler (Death/Massacre/Six Feet Under), Sam Williams and Curtis Beeson called Denial Fiend of whom released their debut \"They Rise\" on October 16, 2007. In that same month, Massacre played their final gig in the United States on October 6, 2007. October 26, Massacre began their final tour dubbed \"Re-Animated\" in Berlin, Germany.\n\nIn 2009, Lee started the death metal band Bone Gnawer, with Rogga Johansson, Morgan Lie, and Ronnie Bjornstrom. Later that year, Lee and Johansson would form another death metal band called The Grotesquery, along with members Johan Berglund and Brynjar Helgetun. He is also a member of the bands Grave Wax, The Skeletal, and Broken Gravestones.\n\nLee was cast as a serial killer in the 2011 independent horror film \"Deep Seeded\". In 2012, he performed guest vocals on and contributed lyrics to Sigh's \"Far Beneath the In-Between\" on their album \"In Somniphobia\".\n\nIn 2015, he formed the funeral doom band Akatharta, who released their first album \"Spiritus Immundus\" on June 23, 2017. In January 2016, he also announced a solo album for release later in the year, an EP entitled \"Reclamation of the Fallen\" which released on October 30 of that same year, the day before Lee's 50th birthday, which was Halloween. He also revealed a new death/thrash project named Gigantesque and an Alien-themed deathgrind project entitled Alienanalprobe that year, both of which have demo recordings. His latest band is a blackened death metal project called Nattravnen, in collaboration with underground Swedish musician Jonny Pettersson, who premiered a demo track in September 2016, and released their first complete track \"Suicidium, the Seductress of Death\" in January 2018, with their first album \"Kult of the Raven\" to release on December 7, 2018.

It was written by veteran British comic writer Pat Mills.\n\nSet on the Hive World of Necromunda, The Redeemer chronicles the battles of a small band of Redemptionists, fanatical and homicidal cultists of the Emperor, led by their supreme leader and arch-maniac, Klovis the Redeemer, as they fight to stop the Caller, a deadly and extremely powerful Ratskin Shaman, who is leading a horde of Ratskins, Scalies, Plague Zombies and other Underhive Scum in a revolution against the nobles of the Spire.\n\nThe first issue (Epistle) opens with the Redeemer and his maniacs purging a group of Ratskins for a crime Malakev (the narrator) cannot even say (they tried to run away). As Klovis tells one Ratskin that he should be thanking him for rewarding him with a martyr's crown, the Ratskin tells Klovis that he is sick in the head and calls to the Hive Spirits asking for vengeance for the deaths of his people. At this the Caller, the self-proclaimed Shaman of Shamans, bursts from the ground riding a giant Millasaur. He attacks the Redemptionists, proclaiming his intention to lead a revolution of Ratskins to vengeance against the Hivers. Klovis drives him off with a blast of fire from his crown, but the Caller later attacks the Redeemer at his own camp. After fighting him off, and discovering that the Bloodmare Stone (An eye from one of the- if not the- last of the Giant Necromunda Spiders) is the source of his great power, Klovis and his band set out deeper into the Underhive to purge the Caller. The remainder of this issue deals with the Redeemer slaying a mutant gang boss in a duel so that he and his men can head further down.\n\nIn the second issue, the Caller gathers his armies and the Redeemer is captured by a psyker called Ferron Voor, the Emissary of Karloth Valois; Master of Plague Zombies, who drains the life from several of his men to reanimate a monstrous mutant rat, with which he tries to kill Klovis (only to die in the process).\n\nIn the third issue, Klovis and the Caller's armies finally battle with each other, the Slaught-drugged Redemptionists wreaking great havoc whilst Klovis manages, in a superhuman effort, to destroy the Rat God (from the last issue), the Bloodmare Spider Queen and the Caller, despite being badly wounded in the process. The power leaking from the crumbling Bloodmare Stone turns his zealots against him, leading to Klovis scourging his own men. In the end, only one survives: Malakev, who is shown on the second last page of the issue to have been converted into a Scribe-Servitor, a mindless cyborg slave who will spend the rest of his existence writing down Klovis' deeds.\n\nThe series has been collected as a trade paperback:\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of the oldest Sephardic Haggadahs in the world, originating in Barcelona around 1350. The Haggadah is owned by the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo. Its monetary value is undetermined, but a museum in Spain required that it be insured for $7 million before it could be transported to an exhibition there in 1992.\n\nThe Sarajevo Haggadah is handwritten on bleached calfskin and illuminated in copper and gold. It opens with 34 pages of illustrations of key scenes in the Bible from creation through the death of Moses. Its pages are stained with wine, evidence that it was used at many Passover Seders.\n\nThe Sarajevo Haggadah was submitted by Bosnia and Herzegovina for inclusion in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register and was included in 2017.\n\nThe Sarajevo Haggadah has survived many close calls with destruction. Historians believe that it was taken out of Spain by Spanish Jews who were expelled by the Alhambra Decree in 1492. Notes in the margins of the Haggadah indicate that it surfaced in Italy in the 16th century. It was sold to the National Museum in Sarajevo in 1894 by a man named Joseph Kohen.\n\nDuring World War II, the manuscript was hidden from the Nazis and Ustashe by the Museum's chief librarian, Derviš Korkut, who at risk to his own life, smuggled the Haggadah out of Sarajevo. Korkut gave it to a Muslim cleric in Zenica, where it was hidden under the floorboards of either a mosque or a Muslim home. In 1957, a facsimile of the Haggadah was published by Sándor Scheiber, director of the Rabbinical Seminary in Budapest. In 1992 during the Bosnian War, the Haggadah manuscript survived a museum break-in and it was discovered on the floor during the police investigation by a local Inspector, Fahrudin Čebo, with many other items thieves believed were not valuable. It survived in an underground bank vault during the Siege of Sarajevo by Serb forces. To quell rumors that the government had sold the Haggadah in order to buy weapons, the president of Bosnia presented the manuscript at a community Seder in 1995.\n\nAfterwards, the manuscript was restored through a special campaign financed by the United Nations and the Bosnian Jewish community in 2001, and went on permanent display at the museum in December 2002.\n\nIn 1985 a reproduction was printed in Ljubljana, with 5,000 copies made. The National Museum subsequently authorized the publication of a limited number of reproductions of the Haggadah, each of which has become a collector's item. In May 2006, the Sarajevo publishing house Rabic Ltd., announced the forthcoming publication of 613 copies of the Haggadah on handmade parchment that attempts to recreate the original appearance of the 14th century original, alluding to the 613 Mitzvot.\n\nThere is a brief mention of the manuscript in the motion picture \"Welcome to Sarajevo\". The novel \"People of the Book\", by Geraldine Brooks (2008), crafts a fictionalised history of the Haggadah from its origins in Spain to the museum in Sarajevo. The Winter, 2002, issue of the literary journal Brick published Ramona Koval's account of the disputes surrounding the proposed UNESCO-funded display of the original codex in the context of the post-Dayton Agreement UN-supervised 1995 peace settlement.\n\nThe history of Derviš Korkut, who saved the book from the Nazis, was told in an article by Geraldine Brooks in \"The New Yorker\" magazine. The article also sets out the story of the young Jewish girl, Mira Papo, whom Korkut and his wife hid from the Nazis as they were acting to save the Haggadah. In a twist of fate, as an elderly woman in Israel, Mira Papo secured the safety of Korkut's daughter during the Bosnian war in the 1990s.\n\nA copy of the Sarajevo Haggadah was given to former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair by the Grand Mufti of Bosnia and Herzegovina Mustafa Ceric during the awards ceremony for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's Faith Shorts competition in December 2011. The Grand Mufti presented it as a symbol of interfaith cooperation and respect, while recounting the protection of the Jewish book by Muslims on two occasions in history. Another copy was given by the Grand Mufti Ceric to a representative of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel during the interreligious meeting \"\"Living Together is the Future\"\" organised in Sarajevo by the Community of Sant'Egidio.\n\nIn October 2012, the Haggadah's future exhibition was left in limbo following a drought in funding for the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which shuttered its doors after going bankrupt and not paying its employees for almost a year. In 2013 the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art attempted to arrange for a loan of the Haggadah, but due to internal political battles within Bosnia and Herzegovina, the loan was eventually refused by Bosnia’s National Monuments Preservation Commission.\n\nHowever, the Haggadah was again on display as of September 2015, following the National Museum's re-opening. \n\n"}

In a still ongoing excavation campaign, rich fossil deposits and stone tool assemblages were discovered which are attributed to the earliest known hominin residents in Western Europe. This \"exceptional reserve of data\" has been deposited during extensive Lower Paleolithic presence, as the Atapuerca Mountains served as the preferred occupation site of \"Homo erectus\", \"Homo antecessor\" (or \"Homo erectus antecessor\"), \"Homo heidelbergensis\" and \"Homo neanderthalensis\" communities. The earliest specimen so far unearthed and reliably dated confirm an age between 1.2 million and 630,000 years. Some finds are exhibited in the nearby Museum of Human Evolution, in Burgos.\n\nEncompassing , the Atapuerca Mountains are a mid-altitude karstic range of small foothills around above sea level. They are located at the north-east corner of the Douro basin, to the south of the Cantabrian Mountains that run across northern Spain, and stretch alongside the \"Bureba corridor\", a mountain pass that connects the Ebro river valley with the Mediterranean Sea and the Duero basin. This conjunction constitutes an ecotone, which is rich in species of both ecosystems. The mountain pass was part of a causeway built by the Romans, as well as part of the pilgrimage route of Saint James; it is now traversed by the N-I and AP-1 highways. The mountains are strategically located between two major drainage divides and near the mountain pass; this location is assumed to have been a factor in the area's successful and prolonged hominid habitation.\n\nIn 2008 scholars identified a new \"genus\" and species of red-toothed shrew from the Pleistocene layers of the Gran Dolina cave. Until this discovery, researchers had believed that the fossils found in this area were of the \"Beremendia fissidens\" type, but recent research has been published to support an Asiatic type called \"Dolinasorex glyphodon\" that might be endemic and is the earliest known type of soricid in the Iberian peninsula.\n\nThe archaeological site was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, under the name, \"Archaeological Site of Atapuerca\".\n\nPiedrahita (\"standing stone\") in the Atapuerca valley is according to records site of the Battle of Atapuerca, which took place in 1054 between the forces of Ferdinand I of Castile and his brother García V of Navarre.\n\nApart from the typical dryland farming of the region, the municipality has grown significantly in economic, demographic and social level with the impact generated by the presence of the archaeological site and its associated services. 15% of the active population owns a job related to tourism. This \"tertiarization\" of their economy has reversed depopulation by growing and rejuvenating it (with the average age at 42 years).\n\n"}

An unsafe abortion is a life-threatening procedure. It includes self-induced abortions, abortions in unhygienic conditions, and abortions performed by a medical practitioner who does not provide appropriate post-abortion attention. About 25 million unsafe abortions occur a year, of which most occur in the developing world.\n\nUnsafe abortions results in complications for about 7 million women a year. Unsafe abortions are also one of the leading causes of deaths during pregnancy and childbirth (about 5-13% of all deaths during this period). Most unsafe abortions occur where abortion is illegal, or in developing countries where affordable and well-trained medical practitioners are not readily available, or where modern birth control is unavailable. \n\nUnsafe abortion was and is a public health crisis. More specifically, lack of access to safe abortion was and is a public health risk. The more restrictive the law, the higher the rates of death and other complications.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that for the time period of 2010-14 there were 55.7 million abortions worldwide each year. Out of these abortions, approximately 54% were safe, 31% were less safe, and 14% were least safe. That means that 25 million (45%) abortions each year between 2010 and 2014 were unsafe, with 24 million (97%) of these in developing countries. In 2003 approximately 42 million pregnancies were voluntarily terminated, of which 20 million were unsafe. According to WHO and Guttmacher, at least 22,800 women die annually as a result of complications of unsafe abortion; and between two million and seven million women each year survive unsafe abortion but sustain long-term damage or disease (incomplete abortion, infection (sepsis), bleeding, and injury to the internal organs, such as puncturing or tearing of the uterus). They also concluded abortion is safer in countries where it's legal, but dangerous in countries where it's outlawed and performed clandestinely. The WHO reports that in developed regions, nearly all abortions (92%) are safe, whereas in developing countries, more than half (55%) are unsafe. According to WHO statistics, the risk rate for unsafe abortion is 1/270; according to other sources, unsafe abortion is responsible for at least 8% of maternal deaths. Worldwide, 48% of all induced abortions are unsafe. The British Medical Bulletin reported in 2003 that 70,000 women a year die from unsafe abortion. Incidence of such abortions may be difficult to measure because they can be reported variously as miscarriage, \"induced miscarriage\", \"menstrual regulation\", \"mini-abortion\", and \"regulation of a delayed/suspended menstruation\".\n\nAn article pre-printed by the World Health Organization called safe, legal abortion a \"fundamental right of women, irrespective of where they live\" and unsafe abortion a \"silent pandemic\". The article states \"ending the silent pandemic of unsafe abortion is an urgent public-health and human-rights imperative.\" It also states \"access to safe abortion improves women’s health, and vice versa, as documented in Romania during the regime of President Nicolae Ceaușescu\" and \"legalisation of abortion on request is a necessary but insufficient step toward improving women’s health\" citing that in some countries, such as India where abortion has been legal for decades, access to competent care remains restricted because of other barriers. WHO’s Global Strategy on Reproductive Health, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2004, noted: \"As a preventable cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, unsafe abortion must be dealt with as part of the MDG on improving maternal health and other international development goals and targets.\" The WHO's Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), whose research concerns people's sexual and reproductive health and lives, has an overall strategy to combat unsafe abortion that comprises four interrelated activities:\n\nA 2007 study published in \"The Lancet\" found that, although the global rate of abortion declined from 45.6 million in 1995 to 41.6 million in 2003, unsafe procedures still accounted for 48% of all abortions performed in 2003. It also concluded that, while the overall incidence of abortion in both developed and developing countries is approximately equal, unsafe abortion occurs more often in less-developed nations.\n\nAccording to a new study in \"The Lancet\" that focused on data from 2010 to 2014, nearly 55 million pregnancies are terminated early and of that 55 million, nearly half, 25.5 million are deemed as unsafe. The World Health Organization and the Guttmacher Institute in New York, stresses the need for access to a safe abortion for all women and that unsafe methods must be replaced. Africa, Asia and Latin America account for almost 97 percent of them of unsafe abortions. These regions are often poorer and underdeveloped and lack the access to safe abortion methods. Out of all abortions in these regions only 25% are considered safe. In developed countries these numbers improve drastically. Nearly all abortions in North America (99%) are considered safe. Overall nearly 88% of abortions in developed countries were actually considered safe, with the number of safe abortions in Europe slightly lower.\n\nUnsafe abortions often occur where abortion is illegal. However, the prevalence of unsafe abortion may also be determined by other factors, such as whether it occurs in a developing country that has a low level of competent medical care.\n\nUnsafe abortions sometimes occur where abortion is legal, and safe abortions sometimes occur where abortion is illegal. Legalization is not always followed by elimination of unsafe abortion. Affordable safe services may be unavailable despite legality, and conversely, women may be able to afford medically competent services despite illegality.\n\nWhen abortion is illegal, that generally contributes to the prevalence of unsafe abortion, but it is not the only contributor. In addition, a lack of access to safe and effective contraception contributes to unsafe abortion. It has been estimated that the incidence of unsafe abortion could be reduced by as much as 73% without any change in abortion laws if modern family planning and maternal health services were readily available globally.\n\nIllegality of abortion contributes to maternal mortality, but that contribution is not as great as it once was, due to medical advances including penicillin and the birth control pill.\n\nSource: WHO 2006\n\nIn 1973, the Supreme Court ruled 7–2 that laws prohibiting an abortion violated a woman’s right to privacy. The landmark case, \"Roe v. Wade\", changed abortion in the United States. \n\nEarly abortion laws really only prohibited the use of toxic chemicals that were used to cause a miscarriage. The first such law was passed in Connecticut in 1821.\n\nPrior to 1973, the authority to legalize abortion rested with the state governments. Up through the 1960s 44 states had laws that outlawed abortions unless the health of the pregnant patient was at stake.\n\nIn the 1940s, records show that more than 1,000 women died each year from abortions that were labeled as unsafe. Many of these abortions were self-induced. Unsafe abortion practices were such a concern in the United States that nearly every large hospital had some type of “septic abortion ward” that was responsible for dealing with the complications that accompanied an incomplete abortion. Incomplete abortions were the leading cause for OB-GYN services across the United States. In the 1960s, the National Opinion Research Center found that hundreds of women were attempting to self-abort with coat hangers, knitting needles and ballpoint pens, and by swallowing toxic chemicals like bleach and laundry detergent. However, the number of deaths declined significantly into the 1960s and 1970s. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in 1972, 130,000 women attempted self-induced abortions or obtained illegal abortions, resulting in 39 deaths.\n\nIn 2005, the \"Detroit News\" reported that a 16-year-old boy beat his pregnant, under-age girlfriend with a bat at her request to abort a fetus. The young couple lived in Michigan, where parental consent is required to receive an abortion. In Indiana, where there are also parental consent laws, a girl by the name of Becky Bell died from an unsafe abortion rather than discuss her pregnancy and wish for an abortion with her parents.\n\nIn 2011, Kermit Gosnell, a licensed doctor who provided abortion services in the American state of Pennsylvania, was indicted by a grand jury on murder charges after a woman died in his clinic. The grand jury found that the conditions in Gosnell's clinic were not only unsanitary and that Gosnell staffed his clinic with unlicensed individuals, he had also commonly conducted the lesser known practice of severing the spinal cords of newly born babies.\n\nMethods of unsafe abortion include:\n\nUnsafe abortion is a major cause of injury and death among women worldwide. It is estimated that nearly 25 million unsafe abortions take place annually. WHO estimates that at least 7.9% of maternal deaths are due to unsafe abortion, with a greater proportion occurring in Latin America, the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa and a lesser proportion in East Asia were access to abortion is generally legal. 97% of these abortions take place in developing countries. Unsafe abortion is believed to result in at least 22,800 deaths and millions of injuries annually. The legal status of abortion is believed to play a major role in the frequency of unsafe abortion. For example, the 1996 legalization of abortion in South Africa had an immediate positive impact on the frequency of abortion-related complications, with abortion-related deaths dropping by more than 90%. Groups such as the World Health Organization have advocated a public-health approach to addressing unsafe abortion, emphasizing the legalization of abortion, the training of medical personnel, and ensuring access to reproductive-health services.\n\nAn unsafe abortion can lead to wide range of health risks that can affect the well-being of women. The major and most life-threatening complications that stem from unsafe abortions are infection, hemorrhaging and injury to internal organs.\n\nAbortion symptoms that can lead to additional health risks:\n\nComplications and their treatments include:\nDamage to the genital tract or internal organs: Admission to a health care facility is imperative, any delay can be fatal.\n\nRegardless if an abortion was legal or illegal, health care providers are required by law to provide medical care to patients, as it may be life-saving. In some cases, treatment for abortion complications may be administered only when the woman provides information about the abortion and provides information about any and all persons that were involved.\n\nIt is difficult to get a confession from women seeking emergency medical care as a result of an illegal abortion because it puts women's lives at risk. However, it is a legal requirement for doctors to report cases of women who have undergone any type of abortion. Any delay in care increases the risks to women’s health and lives. \n\n\n"}

It formed part of a system of colonial flags that was used throughout the British Empire.\n\nIn a series of decisions made in 1864, 1865, and 1869, the UK's government decided that every colony should have a distinctive badge, to be displayed on flags at sea. The governor was to display the badge in the center of the Union Jack when travelling by sea; vessels owned by the colony's government were to display it in the fly of the Blue Ensign; and, with Admiralty permission, privately owned ships registered in the colony could display the badge in the fly of the Red Ensign. This system is still in operation in the remaining British overseas territories.\n\nThe Cape government was initially not in favor of the system but eventually complied with British government requests to adopt a flag badge. The Molteno ministry decided to introduce a coat of arms, which would also serve as the flag badge. The coat of arms was first displayed on a flag at the laying of the foundation stone of the Houses of Parliament on 12 May 1875. It was formally granted by Queen Victoria on 29 May 1876, and made its official appearance as a flag badge shortly afterwards. It was used until the colony was incorporated into the Union of South Africa on 31 May 1910.\n\nThe flag badge consisted of the Cape Colony coat of arms on a white disc. The coat of arms consisted of a red shield displaying a golden lion between three golden rings, below a silver horizontal strip ('chief') containing three golden fleurs de lis on blue discs. The figure of Hope formed the crest, and the shield was supported by a wildebeest and a gemsbok. The motto 'Spes Bona' ('Good Hope') was displayed below the shield.\n\n\n"}

The College is the official channel of liaison between the University of Glasgow, the Church of Scotland, and the United Free Church of Scotland\n\nThe current Principal is Rev Dr. Doug Gay.\n\nThe Disruption of 1843 marked a schism in the Church of Scotland, resulting in the creation of the Free Church of Scotland. The Free Church established three colleges or seminaries of its own, detached from the universities, for the education of its ministers. As well as its Glasgow college, the other two colleges were New College, Edinburgh and Christ's College, Aberdeen.\n\nThe Glasgow College, funded by local subscription, was established in 1856. It was a multi-disciplinary institution of considerable reputation, existing outside the University of Glasgow's Faculty of Divinity. In 1872 Thomas Martin Lindsay was appointed Professor of church history, and he became principal of the college in 1902.\n\nLater, in 1930, following the reunion of the churches and theological teaching facilities, the Glasgow Church college was renamed \"Trinity College\". After the reunion of the main Scottish Presbyterian churches in 1929–30, the two teaching facilities in the University and the Church College were reintegrated. After 1976, when the Church-owned Trinity College buildings at Park Circus were finally vacated, all teaching of theology took place in the university Divinity Faculty. Accordingly, while Trinity College still exists, it is a body without walls.\n\nOn 2 November 2006, Trinity College celebrated its 150th Anniversary with a gathering of some 250 alumni and friends. Its 155th anniversary celebrations took place on 4 November 2011.\n\nTeachers in the pre-1930 College included Alexander Balmain Bruce, James Denney, George A. Smith, James Moffatt, Henry Drummond, and James Orr. In the modern era, in the reunited faculty, notable teachers have included John MacQuarrie, William H.C. Frend, William Barclay, John Zizioulas, Robert Davidson George Newlands, and John Riches. The former Clerk was Rev. Dr. A. K. M.

It was started on 25 November 1952. Contrary to popular belief there is no town at the bottom of Pactola Lake. The Bureau of Reclamation clear cut and cleaned the lake bottom before it filled. The few buildings still there by the time the dam was finished on August 15, 1956 were moved or auctioned off. The only structure under the water is the old Civilian Conservation Corp camp dynamite bunker.\n\nThe lake is located on Rapid Creek in Pennington County, South Dakota. The lake provides the water supply for the Rapid City Metro Area. It is owned and operated by the US Bureau of Reclamation, with the various recreational facilities operated by the US Forest Service, and is one of the recreational areas of Black Hills National Forest. Boating and fishing are very popular, with a walk-in fly fishing area located on Rapid Creek below the dam.\n\nFacilities include a marina, improved swimming beach, campgrounds and group campground on the south shore, campgrounds and a handicapped fishing path on the north shore, and various picnic and overlook areas. In the summer, the USFS operates a visitor center on the dam, immediately off US Highway 385. The dam across Rapid Creek is very large, and was enlarged following the Black Hills Flood of 1972; lake water levels vary enormously, as the lake is used for flood control, domestic water, streamflow maintenance, and irrigation.\n\nPactola Lake is accessible via US Highway 385 north from Hill City, South Dakota and Sheridan Lake Forks or south from Lead and Deadwood; or via the Rimrock Highway (also known as SD Highway 44), from Rapid City, South Dakota.

{"id": "2063776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2063776", "title": "Intaglio (printmaking)", "text": "Intaglio (printmaking)\n\nIntaglio ( , ) is the family of printing and printmaking techniques in which the image is incised into a surface and the incised line or sunken area holds the ink. It is the direct opposite of a relief print.\n\nNormally, copper or zinc plates are used as a surface or matrix, and the incisions are created by etching, engraving, drypoint, aquatint or mezzotint. Collagraphs may also be printed as intaglio plates.\n\nIn intaglio printing, the lines to be printed are cut into a metal (e.g. copper) plate by means either of a cutting tool called a burin, held in the hand – in which case the process is called \"engraving\"; or through the corrosive action of acid – in which case the process is known as \"etching\". In etching, for example, the plate is pre-covered in a thin, acid-resistant resin or wax \"ground\". Using etching needles or burins, the artist or writer (etcher) engraves their image (therefore to be only where the plate beneath is exposed). The plate's ground side is then dipped into acid, or the acid poured onto it. The acid bites into the surface of the plate where it was exposed. Biting is a printmaking term to describe the acid's etching, or incising, of the image; its duration depends on the acid strength, metal's reactivity, temperature, air pressure and the depth desired. After the plate is sufficiently bitten it is removed from the acid bath, the ground is removed gently and the plate is usually dried or cleaned.\n\nTo print an intaglio plate, ink or inks are painted, wiped and/or dabbed into the recessed lines (such as with brushes/rubber gloves/rollers). The plate is then rubbed with tarlatan cloth to remove most of its waste (surface ink) and a final smooth wipe is often done with newspaper or old public phone book pages, leaving it in the incisions. Dampened imprint (product) paper will usually be fed against the plate, covered by a blanket, so when pressed by rolling press it is squeezed into the plate's ink-filled grooves with uniform very high pressure. The blanket is then lifted, revealing the paper and printed image. The final stages repeat for each copy needed.\n\nIntaglio printmaking emerged in Europe well after the woodcut print, with the earliest known surviving examples being undated designs for playing cards made in Germany, using drypoint technique, probably in the late 1430s. Engraving had been used by goldsmiths to decorate metalwork, including armor, musical instruments and religious objects since ancient times, and the niello technique, which involved rubbing an alloy into the lines to give a contrasting color, also goes back to late antiquity. Scholars and practitioners of printmaking have suggested that the idea of making prints from engraved plates may well have originated with goldsmiths' practices of taking an impression on paper of a design engraved on an object, in order to keep a record of their work, or to check the quality.\n\nMartin Schongauer was one of the earliest known artists to exploit the copper-engraving technique, and Albrecht Dürer is one of the most famous intaglio artists. Italian and Dutch engraving began slightly after the Germans, but were well developed by 1500. Drypoint and etching were also German inventions of the fifteenth century, probably by the Housebook Master and Daniel Hopfer respectively.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, Viennese printer Karel Klíč introduced a combined intaglio and photographic process. Photogravure retained the smooth continuous tones of photography but was printed using a chemically-etched copper plate. This permitted a photographic image to be printed on regular paper, for inclusion in books or albums.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s the Italian security printer Gualtiero Giori brought intaglio printing into the era of high-technology by developing the first ever six-colour intaglio printing press, designed to print banknotes which combined more artistic possibilities with greater security.\n\nAt one time intaglio printing was used for all mass-printed materials including banknotes, stock certificates, newspapers, books, maps and magazines, fabrics, wallpapers and sheet music. Today intaglio engraving is largely used for paper or plastic currency, banknotes, passports and occasionally for high-value postage stamps. The appearance of engraving is sometimes mimicked for items such as wedding invitations by producing an embossment around lettering printed by another process (such as lithography or offset) to suggest the edges of an engraving plate. \n\n"}

The Toyman made frequent appearances in the Golden Age comics, but has appeared infrequently in \"Superman\" stories since then.\n\nToyman appeared in live-action by Chris Gauthier in the television series \"Smallville\". Henry Czerny appeared in the television series \"Supergirl\" who had a son named Winslow Schott Jr. or Winn played by Jeremy Jordan. He eventually used the Toyman name as part of the Legion of Superheroes.\n\nThe Winslow Schott version of Toyman first appeared in \"Action Comics\" #64 (September 1943) and was created by Don Cameron and Ed Dobrotka.\n\nThe Jack Nimball version of Toyman first appeared in \"Action Comics\" #432 and was created by Cary Bates and Curt Swan.\n\nThe Hiro Okamura version of Toyman first appeared in \"Superman\" Vol. 2 #127 and was created by Jeph Loeb and Ed McGuinness.\n\nThe Toyman first appeared in 1943 and appeared in several Golden Age \"Superman\" stories. Schott appeared less frequently in comics published after the early 1950s, but remained a semi-regular foe during the '60s, '70s, and '80s.\n\nWhile at first more of a nuisance, Toyman gradually grew more emotionally unstable and paranoid over time, his toys following suit by becoming a lot more dangerous. Although Winslow Schott in his civilian persona was a rather sweet, humble, quirky (if socially withdrawn) person, as Toyman he turned into a childish, destructive megalomaniac. During the '70s Winslow was effectively retired from crime, but he kept contact with Superman and even helped out to take down Jack Nimball, who he felt sullied the Toyman legacy.\n\nThis retirement proved to be tragically short, as not long after Winslow put some of his toys on display (a suggestion by Superman), the entire museum exhibition was completely wrecked. Sightings reported this to be the work of a man in blue tights flying at great speeds. Thinking he's been played for a fool by Superman, Schott swore to destroy everything Superman cared about to avenge his life's work. Eventually it is revealed that the real culprit was Bizarro, in search for the duplicator ray, but by then it was already too late: Schott had already returned to his Toyman ways, murdered Jack Nimball and a hotel door guard in cold blood, and built a giant robot to terrorize the city. Shortly after his defeat, he regained his sanity and remembered what he had done. He shed tears of regret as he was escorted to the police car.\nAfter that incident Winslow's mental state grew even worse, and while he often made several legitimate attempts to atone for his sins, he would often relapse back into madness.\n\nAfter 1985's miniseries \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" and John Byrne's \"Man of Steel\" miniseries, the Toyman's history was revised, and the post-\"Crisis\" version of the character first appeared in \"Superman\" (vol. 2) #13 (January 1988). In this version, Winslow Schott is an unemployed British toymaker who blames Lex Luthor and his company, LexCorp, for being fired from the toy company he is working for. He uses his toymaking talents to seek revenge, which eventually causes him to cross paths with the British hero Godiva, and subsequently, Superman himself. The Toyman continues to commit various crimes in Metropolis, including engaging in child abduction.\n\nThe Toyman later became a much more sinister figure, shaving his head, wearing black and getting advice in his head from \"Mother\". This was prompted by him being told that a range of Superman action figures would not include him as he is not \"edgy\" enough. While this seems to begin as a pose of what he thought people expect of a villain, it rapidly became a genuine psychotic break. While in this state he abducted and later murdered Adam Morgan, the son of \"Daily Planet\" reporter Cat Grant. Adam and several other children captured by Toyman tried to escape, but Schott found out and stabbed Adam to death for being the leader of the group. This caused Schott to develop a hatred of children, as he blamed them for not appreciating his toys. At the time, Schott showed no remorse for what he had done. When Cat Grant later confronted him in prison he cruelly told her \"You were a bad mommy. I'm glad I killed your son.\"\n\nThe Toyman later seemingly recovered, and Superman showed him that children did appreciate old-fashioned toys, arranging parole in an orphanage; it was later revealed, however, that this was all a hallucination caused when Zatanna attempts to cure him and he had, in fact, returned to child abduction. He appeared after JLA: Crisis of Conscience where Zatanna reveals she mind-wiped him. She and Superman go after him. Zatanna is bound and gagged by him, but freed by Superman; however, Toyman escaped.\n\nWinslow was seen in \"\" as a criminal released by Lex Luthor's aide Mr. Orr to deploy his genetically engineered hero Hope , but she almost kills the villain, until Superman saved him. Toyman was as well as in the \"Infinite Crisis: Villains United\" special, preparing for the Blackgate Prison break by lacing the dinner stew with Venom and Velocity 9 to increase the prisoners' strength, speed, and aggression. Unfortunately, some guards also ate the drugged stew and fought the superheroes who showed up to stop the criminals.\n\nHe was later seen as a member of the Injustice League in the \"Justice League of America Wedding Special\".\n\nToyman's history was later revised in \"Action Comics\" #865, by Geoff Johns and Jesus Merino. Winslow Schott tells Jimmy Olsen that he was a toymaker who lived with his wife Mary. When a businessman offered to buy his shop to expand the number of children his toys can reach, he refused. When Mary was killed in a car accident a few weeks later, Schott agreed to the purchase. However, the businessman lied and gave his technologically advanced toy plans to arms manufacturers. Schott proceeded to bomb the business with an explosive teddy bear. A twist at the end of the story reveals that Mary was just one of his first robotic creations.\n\nFollowing his first confrontation with Superman, Schott met the Prankster for the first time. The Prankster is a cruel, callous man who commits crimes \"because it's fun\". He repeatedly asked Schott to \"team up\", but Schott refused.\n\nSchott reveals to Jimmy that the Toyman who killed Adam Grant was a robot created by Schott to replace him in the event that he was ever incarcerated and that a glitch in the robot's programming resulted in it developing a personality, (and later a hatred of children), and that Schott's repeated attempts to contact the robot resulted in it suffering from delusions of \"Mother\". This was confirmed in \"Superman Secret Files 2009\", although Jimmy initially expressed doubt that Schott was telling the truth.\n\nIn the 1997 \"Speed Force Special\", the Max Mercury story \"Child's Play\", set in 19th century New York City, featured the Schott Toy Company run by Archimedes Schott, a crooked businessman who resembles Winslow. Any relationship between them is unknown.\n\nIn the \"Supergirl\" series, while in Arkham Asylum, Toyman is visited by Cat Grant (whose son Adam was murdered) and Supergirl. Cat interrogates him about children who have been kidnapped with dolls left behind. Toyman claims he is innocent and the robotic dolls attack him. Supergirl saves him and gets him to medical care. When Cat return home, she is confronted by a villain called the Dollmaker. He identifies himself as Anton Schott implying that he is somehow related to Toyman. Dollmaker eventually reveals himself to be the abandoned son of Winslow, who has been kidnapping children and using macabre experiments in order to turn them into slaves. He tells Cat that he wants her to become his new mother, and that he wishes to serve as a replacement for her murdered son, but Cat violently rejects him. With her gag temporarily removed, Cat is able to call Supergirl for help, and the two are able to defeat Dollmaker and free the children he had enslaved.\n\nIn the 1970s, a man named Jack Nimball assumes the identity of the second Toyman during a period in which Schott retires from his criminal career and first appeared in \"Action Comics\" #432 (February 1974). Nimball wore a jester costume and used a similar modus operandi to the original Toyman. However, this version of Toyman proved short-lived. Schott killed Nimball with a mechanical toy bird and resumed his criminal career in \"Superman\" #305 (November 1976). This Toyman's only other appearances were in \"Action\" #454 and \"Superman\" #299.\n\nNimball appears as one of Schott's androids in \"Action Comics\" #865.\n\nThe version of the Toyman who appears in \"Challenge of the Super Friends\" was based on Nimball.\n\nIn 2011 Mattel released a DC Universe Classics 6\" Toyman figure based on the Jack Nimball version of the character. On the back, though, the character is labeled as Winslow Percival Schott.\n\nHiro Okamura is a teenage mechanical genius from Japan first appearing as Toyman in \"Superman\" vol. 2, #177 (February 2002) by Jeph Loeb and Ed McGuinness. He shows up in Metropolis in a giant Super Robot fighting Metallo, claiming the cyborg's equally-giant body was based on material stolen from his grandfather.\n\nHe later becomes an ally to Superman and Batman. In the \"Superman/Batman\" series, he aids the two in destroying a kryptonite meteor that threatens the Earth. He strikes a deal with Batman to provide him with various technological implements (\"Superman/Batman\" #7). Okamura uses more technologically advanced devices than the traditionally-constructed contrivances Schott uses and his work is largely whimsical in nature. Many of his inventions are inspired by anime and manga, including giant mecha (notably his giant Composite Batman-Superman robot).\n\nOkamura appears only a few times in the \"Superman/Batman\" comic book, and his activities are limited to Japan. Winslow Schott remains active as the Toyman in the United States. In the Sam Loeb-penned memorial issue \"Superman/Batman\" #26, Okamura fakes his own kidnapping at the hands of Schott, forcing Superboy and Robin to search through his complex to save his life. Realizing his loneliness, Superboy and Robin extend their friendship to the boy. Okamura joins Robin and the other Teen Titans at Titans Tower for Superboy's funeral, clutching a Superboy action figure.\n\nIn \"Superman/Batman\" #45, he offers to assist the duo in their quest to rid the world of Kryptonite, using spider-like nanobots to collect Kryptonite molecules in the air. His offer becomes a necessity as Lana Lang, in a last-ditch effort to get rid of Kryptonians and keep LexCorp afloat, turns a set of Kryptonite caches into \"dirty bombs\", which irradiate the entire planet. Hiro comes to the rescue, settling for a Power Girl-bot to \"date\". Instead, he gets his dream date, a dinner in Paris with the real Karen, and the status of honorary member of the Justice League.\n\nA future version of Hiro, allied with a power-hungry group of Titans, travels back in time to modern day to cement their power-base in \"Teen Titans\" #52 (Jan. 2008).\n\nHiro appears as one of Winslow Schott's androids in \"Action Comics\" #865; given the unreliable nature of Schott's narration, Hiro's status as his android creation is suspect.\n\nIn \"The New 52\" (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Hiro Okamura operates as the Toymaster. He and his friend Agnes have reverse-engineered the works of Silas Stone and Professor Emil Hamilton to create a massive multiplayer online game that puts the players with Batman and Superman in real life. When it comes to Toymaster's latest game, Jimmy Olsen is one of the players that will partake in the game that will involve the killing of Batman. When Batman and Superman track down Toymaster, he warns Batman of their weakness of being beaten down in real life while also stating that his game has somehow began to manifest in real life. Before Batman can destroy the console in order to end the game, Toymaster's building is then attacked by Mongul who plans to make Toymaster's game real for him. Hiro later appears as a confident at his Toymaster Gameshop for a witness named Condesa to Clark Kent and Lois Lane's story on HODOR_Root, in which he agrees to help them.\n\nThe Toyman doesn't have any real powers, but he possessed incredible technological expertise and inventiveness, and specialized in robotics, though he had also shown expertise in biological weaponry. Despite the childish motif which he usually insists on incorporating, Toyman's creations were incredibly sophisticated and deadly. In addition, most of his inventions had an innocuous, or even comical appearance that causes his opponents hesitation or confusion, often to their regret.\n\nToyman surfaces in Metropolis and allies with Lex Luthor in \"Action Comics\" #837 (May 2006) as part of the One Year Later story arc. His first appearance was written by Geoff Johns and Kurt Busiek with art by Pete Woods.\n\nHis appearance, inspired by the character's \"\" incarnation, is that of a child-sized doll. This Toyman mentions meeting Hiro Okamura in Japan and stealing one of his Superman robots. As part of his bargain with Luthor, he is given the information needed to find his creator Winslow Schott in exchange for assistance in a plot against Superman.\n\nThis Toyman, renamed Toyboy, is shown amongst Schott's other robots in \"Action Comics\" #865, and appears as Toyboy alongside Schott in the 2009-2010 World's Finest limited series.\n\nOn the cover of \"Justice League of America\" (vol. 2) #13, it shows this android Toyman as a member of the Injustice League.\n\nA female version of Toyman named Toywoman appears in Superman #349 (July, 1980). Toywoman is the gender-inverted version of Winslow Schott, the criminal known as Toyman, created by Mister Mxyzptlk to serve as an enemy to Superwoman. \n\nThe Bizarro Toyman appears in Action Comics #856 (November, 2007). When Bizarro III found himself infused with radiation from a blue sun, he developed the ability to replicate himself as well as create other \"Bizarro\" lifeforms based upon likenesses of people from Earth. He used this power to populate a cube-shaped planetoid dubbed Bizarro World within the blue sun star system. One of the many duplicates that he created was a Bizarro version of Superman's adversary the Toyman. Bizarro imprisoned Toyman inside of his Fourtriss uv Bizarro along with several other known foes.\n\nA version of Toyman appears in World's Finest Comics #167 (June, 1967). Toyman notorious criminal, enemy of Superman. He tried to start a crime spree in Gotham City, but was promptly stopped by Superman, Supergirl and Batman. In his defeat, Toyman used a prototype molecular-dissolver ray on Batman, which affected him in the same way as Gold Kryptonite affects Kryptonians.\n\nAn older Hiro appears in the \"Titans Tomorrow\" reality, where he dons a Manga orange and blue battle armor as part of the Titans Army.\n\nIn the story, \"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\" by Alan Moore, Toyman and Prankster, are unwittingly manipulated by Mister Mxyzptlk to discover Superman's secret identity. They succeed after kidnapping Pete Ross and torturing the information out of him, then killing him. After managing to unmask Clark Kent in front of Lana Lang and others by machine-gunning him and revealing his costume beneath his clothes, the Prankster and Toyman are captured by Superman.\n\nThroughout the Multiverse. On Earth-12, a robotic Toyman lives. For more information, see the other media section below.\n\nWinslow Schott and Hiro Okamura are featured in the \"Smallville Season 11\" digital comic based on the TV series, Toyman appears in a 2013 \"Smallville Season Eleven\" comic. At LexCorp R&D, Superman and Lex are all forced friendly-like as Lex analyzes the teleportation vest used by a some criminals in a hostage situation and admits the technology is his, but that it was stolen during a series of robberies made on Lexcorp and other companies, one of which was foiled way back by the Green Arrow and Superman. Lex surmises that whoever created these teleportation vests using all that stolen technology would have to be very familiar with Lexcorp's patents and proprietary coding. This leads Superman to Stryker's Island prison and Winslow who is still incarcerated and seemingly not a suspect, according to Warden Draper, since he has been under constant supervision in \"hyper-solitary\". Lois Lane arrives at Stryker's Island to question Toyman about Prankster. Toyman reveals that Prankster is just a pathetic imitation of him; they worked together in the Queen Industries Research and Development Department before Toyman started working for Lex. Winslow then asks Lois if Lex asked about him since his return, which leads Lois to retort that Toyman must rank pretty low since his memory has been removed. Toyman reveals that Oswald has no sense of gamesmanship and would cheat whenever he can and had stolen his idea for kryptonite bullets. It is later revealed Schott modified Corben's kryptonite heart, giving Corben the power to absorb the kryptonite radiation once Schott has reinstall it.\n\nToyman/Schott appears in \"DC Super Friends\" comics.\n\nOn Earth-31, an elderly version of the Toyman- never referred to as such, merely as Winslow- is contacted by the Joker to provide him with dangerous toys, such as exploding dolls.\n\nThe Toyman appears as part of the new Legion of Doom in Alex Ross' miniseries \"Justice\". Toyman is only seen in person in the first and last issues of the series, he communicates through a human-sized marionette resembling the Jack Nimball version of Toyman. The Marionette uses a black-and-yellow color scheme and has several strings connected to its joints that give it the appearance of being operated from above. He attacks Hawkman and Hawkgirl in their museum using toy fighter planes and a gigantic Nimball Marionette, blowing up their museum and leaving the duo for dead, though they survive the attack. Toyman's city is shown to resemble a fun house and is mainly populated by children and families. When the Justice League storm the Hall of Doom, the Marionette attacks the League as a whole instead of any particular target, but is nonetheless destroyed in the attack. After the attack the toys in his city come to life and attack the Justice League. Superman eventually finds Schott, now morbidly obese and infected with Brainiac's cybernetics. Superman realizes that Toyman had taken all the children in his city hostage and, with a band of Justice Leaguers, managed to save all of the children before any harm could come to them. Schott was seen recovering in a hospital bed on a screen in the Batcave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Cabell\n\nCharles Pearre Cabell (October 11, 1903 – May 25, 1971) was a United States Air Force General and Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (1953–1962).\n\nHe was the son of Ben E. (son of Confederate general William L. Cabell) and Sadie E. (Pearre) Cabell and attended Oak Cliff High School in Dallas, Texas. He graduated from West Point in 1925. He was initially commissioned as an artillery lieutenant and served in the field artillery until 1931, when he went to flying school, and was transferred to the Air Corps. \n\nHe served in a variety of aviation roles as a staff officer and squadron commander throughout the pre-war years, primarily in observation and pursuit squadrons. He was transferred to the Panama Canal Zone in late 1931 as adjutant of the 7th Observation Squadron, and subsequently commanded 44th Observation, 24th Pursuit, and 74th Pursuit Squadrons in this area. He was promoted to Captain sometime during this period. \n\nHe was transferred to Randolph Field, Texas, as flight instructor in 1934 and subsequently served as post adjutant, beginning in 1937. He was detailed to Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama in 1938, graduating in 1939, then detailed to Command and General Staff College at Leavenworth, Kansas in 1939, graduating in 1940. He was promoted to Major sometime during this period. He was assigned to the Photographic unit at Wright Field, Ohio during 1940, and as an observer with the Royal Air Force; in April 1941, he was assigned to the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps as Chief of the Photographic Unit. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel sometime during this period.\n\nIn February 1942, Cabell was assigned as assistant executive for technical planning and coordination in the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps, and promoted to Colonel. During the summer of 1943, he attended the first course of the Army and Navy Staff College. In late 1943, he was transferred to the Eighth Air Force and assumed command of the 45th Combat Bombardment Wing. In April 1944, he became director of plans for the U.S. Strategic Air Force in Europe, and later that year, having achieved the rank of brigadier general, became director of operations and intelligence for the Mediterranean Air Forces. During the war he served both at air force headquarters at the Pentagon and in the European Theater. \n\nIn May 1945, he was assigned to Air Force headquarters as chief of the Strategy and Policy Division. In December 1945, he was detailed to the United Nations Military Staff Committee where he held roles as deputy and chief U.S. Air Force delegate to the committee. In August 1947, he was promoted major general and returned to Air Force headquarters serving in planning and intelligence roles and became director of Air Force Intelligence in May 1948. In 1949, Cabell set up Project Grudge to \"make a study reviewing the UFO situation for AF HQ.\" However, Grudge quickly became all but moribund, while simultaneously reporting that all UFO cases were being closely investigated. When Cabell learned of this, he ordered Grudge dissolved and ordered that the \"open minded\" Project Blue Book be created.\n\nHe held this director of Air Force Intelligence post until 1951, before being made director of the staff for the Joint Chiefs of Staff from November 1951–1953. During this time, he was promoted to lieutenant general. In 1952, he was an enthusiastic promoter of the U-2 spy plane, along with Allen Welsh Dulles and John Foster Dulles.\n\nOn April 23, 1953, while still an active air force officer, he was appointed Deputy Director of the CIA under Allen Dulles. In 1956, along with the CIA's Richard Bissell, he flew to Bonn, to brief the West German Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, on the ultra-secret U-2 spy plane. Cabell personally negotiated with Chancellor Adenauer for permission to station the U-2 in Wiesbaden and from there to fly over the Soviet Union illegally. It was the U-2 program that allowed CIA chief Allen Dulles to sabotage the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower.\n\nCabell was promoted to full general in 1958.\n\nCabell was forced to resign as Deputy Director by President Kennedy on January 31, 1962, following the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Cabell's brother, Earle Cabell, was Mayor of Dallas when Kennedy visited that city and was assassinated, on November 22, 1963.\n\nCabell died in 1971.\n\nOne hypothesis regarding the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, has to do with the so-called Renegade CIA Clique, where one attempts to implicate Cabell and several other CIA officials, including James Jesus Angleton and William King Harvey, as well as the \"three tramps\", and Cabell's brother Earle Cabell.\n\nDuring Jim Garrison's 1973 bribery trial, tape recordings from March 1971 revealed that Garrison considered publicly implicating Cabell of conspiracy in the assassination after learning he was the brother of the Dallas mayor. Theorizing that a plot to kill the President was masterminded out of New Orleans in conjunction with the CIA with cooperation from the Dallas police department and city government, Garrison tasked his chief investigator, Pershing Gervais, of looking into the possibility that Cabell had stayed in the city's Fontainebleau Motel at the time of the assassination. \"The Washington Post\" reported that there was no evidence that Gervais ever followed through with the request and that there was no further mention of Cabell in Garrison's investigation.\n\nCabell was married to Jacklyn DeHymel in 1934; they had two sons, Charles P. Cabell, Jr. and Benjamin Cabell IV, and one daughter, Catharine C. Bennett. He left an autobiography, \"A Man of Intelligence: Memoirs of War, Peace and the CIA\", published in 1997. His oldest son Charles was also an Air Force officer and West Point graduate (Class of 1958), achieving the rank of brigadier general.\n\nHe was a tenth-generation descendant of Pocahontas and a third cousin of Navy four-star admiral Richard H. Jackson.\n\n\n\n"}

Between 1988 and 1995, Dibble played for the Cincinnati Reds, Chicago White Sox and Milwaukee Brewers. He was a two-time All-Star who recorded 89 saves during his career. Since retiring as a player, Dibble has held several roles in sports television broadcasting.\n\nDibble was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He attended St. Thomas School, a parochial school, and is a graduate of Southington High School in Southington, Connecticut. Dibble's father, Walt Dibble, was a longtime radio news director at WDRC and later WTIC in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nDibble was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the first round of the 1983 amateur draft, and he made his debut with the Reds on June 29, 1988.\n\nOn June 4, 1989, Dibble struck out three batters on nine pitches in the eighth inning of a 5–3 win over the San Diego Padres. Dibble is one of 90 pitchers in Major League history to accomplish the nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning, a feat known as an immaculate inning.\n\nHe was an MLB All-Star in 1990 and 1991, and was the 1990 NLCS Most Valuable Player (along with fellow \"Nasty Boy\" Randy Myers). In 1990, Dibble and the Reds won the World Series by beating the Oakland Athletics in four consecutive games.\n\nDibble recorded his 500th career strikeout in fewer innings—368—than any other pitcher in modern baseball history up to that point (a record that is currently held by Craig Kimbrel).\n\nDuring his career Dibble was known for his temper. During a game in July 1989, he hit Mets second basemen Tim Teufel in the back with a pitch; Teufel then charged Dibble, causing a benches clearing brawl. After saving a game in April 1991 despite giving up two runs in relief, Dibble threw a baseball 400 feet into the center-field seats at Cincinnati, inadvertently striking a woman. He was also involved in a brawl in 1991 with Astros shortstop Eric Yelding. Later in the 1991 season, he threw a baseball into the back of Cubs outfielder Doug Dascenzo as he ran down the first base line and was subsequently ejected from the game. Dibble also was involved in a brawl with manager Lou Piniella in the Reds clubhouse after a game in 1992.\n\nDibble required surgery to his pitching arm in 1994, and missed the entire season as a result. Dibble signed with the Milwaukee Brewers and also played with the Chicago White Sox. He signed with the Chicago Cubs at the end of the 1995 season, but voluntarily retired from the team the following March after a rough spring. Weeks later, he opted to make a comeback, signing a minor league contract on April 14, 1996 with the Florida Marlins, but Dibble would ultimately see no game action with the Marlins or their minor league affiliates.\n\nIn 1998, Dibble joined ESPN as a baseball analyst, working mostly on Dan Patrick's radio show. He worked on \"The Best Damn Sports Show Period\" as a co-host until 2008, when he left to join FOX on their Saturday baseball program as an analyst. Dibble also spends time as a co-host/analyst of First Pitch on XM Channel 175/Sirius channel 210. He formerly hosted \"The Show\" (on the same channel) with Jody McDonald. Dibble served as co-analyst (with Kevin Kennedy) for FOXSports.com on a weekly video segment entitled \"Around the Bases.\" Dibble also is a co-host with former Major League player Denny Hocking on Fox Sports Radio Sunday night programming. In 2009, Dibble signed a three-year contract to replace Don Sutton as the color voice of the Washington Nationals on MASN.\n\nWhile broadcasting a game in August 2010, Dibble drew negative attention for focusing on a group of female spectators in the Nationals crowd, and questioning their focus on the game. He later apologized for the comments. Later in the month, Dibble criticized Nationals rookie pitcher Stephen Strasburg for missing a start due to an injury: \"Suck it up, kid. This is your profession. You chose to be a baseball player. You can't have the cavalry come in and save your butt every time you feel a little stiff shoulder, sore elbow.\" It was revealed shortly afterward that Strasburg had torn an elbow ligament and required Tommy John surgery. Dibble took a few days off from MASN after making the comments, and on September 1, 2010, MASN announced that Dibble would no longer be calling Nationals games. After losing his job with the Nationals, Dibble apologized for the Strasburg comments on his radio show.\n\nIn April 2011, Dibble said in an interview on FoxSports.com that the reason for his dismissal was because of an email Strasburg's father sent to the Lerner Family, the owners of the Nationals. Dibble also continued to express his belief that Strasburg should have pitched through his pain. Strasburg denied the claim about his father's e-mail, and Stan Kasten, the president of the Nationals, called Dibble's account \"fictional\" and \"sad\". As of October 31, 2011, Dibble became a member of Mike North's talk radio show.\n\nDibble had a brief stint as the varsity baseball head coach at Calabasas High School in Calabasas, California. He was fired from his head coaching job on March 27, 2013, only ten games into the season. As of December 18, 2013, he, along with Amy Van Dyken, were replaced on Fox Sports Radio's \"Fox Sports Tonight\".\n\nDibble also called games for the Los Angeles Angels for Compass Media.\n\nOn March 27, 2014, Dibble became the host of the 3–7 pm (Eastern) sports talk show on WUCS 97.9 FM and WAVZ 1300 AM in the ESPN stations in Hartford and New Haven, CT respectively. He joined interim host Paul Nanos who filled in when Mike Bower's contract was not renewed. Up until the end of October the show was billed as \"The Rob Dibble Show with Paul Nanos\".

He was the second son of Hugh IV of Cyprus, the first by his second wife Alice of Ibelin. He was also invested as titular Count of Tripoli when young, in 1346. He was the greatest King of Cyprus on a military basis, where he had great success. He was unable to complete many plans, due to internal disputes that culminated in his assassination at the hands of three of his own knights.\n\nPeter was born in Nicosia in 1328. Hugh's heir apparent was his first born son, Guy, who had married Marie of Bourbon. Guy died before his father, however; and though his son, also named Hugh, demanded the throne, Peter was crowned King of Cyprus by Guy of Ibelin, bishop of Limassol in the Cathedral of Santa Sophia, Nicosia on 24 November 1359.\n\nIn 1349 he traveled secretly to Europe with his brother John. This upset their father who sent ships to find his sons and bring them back. When they were brought back, he imprisoned them for leaving without his permission.\n\nUpon the expulsion of the Holy Roman Empire from Palestine a hundred years before, Cyprus became the stronghold of Christianity in the Middle East. Peter understood the importance of his kingdom, and believed that his mission was to fight Islam. He had ambitions to retake the Kingdom of Jerusalem to which the house of Lusignan yet pretended. Peter was crowned as titular King of Jerusalem in Saint Nicholas Cathedral in Famagusta on 5 April 1360, succeeding his father.\nSoon after 28 June 1342 he married Eschiva de Montfort (d. before 1350), only daughter and heiress of Humphrey de Montfort (1305 – 24 June 1326), Constable of Cyprus and titular Lord of Toron, and Eschive d'Ibelin. Eschiva died before 1350 while Peter was still a teenager and the marriage was childless.\n\nIn 1353 he married Eleanor of Aragon-Gandia (1333 – 26 December 1416 in Barcelona and buried there), daughter of Pedro, Infante of Aragon, Conde de Ribagorza, Ampurias y Prades, Seneschal of Catalonia, and Jeanne de Foix (died before November 1358).<br> Eleanor was crowned Queen of Cyprus on 24 November 1358 and Queen of Jerusalem on 5 April 1360.\n\nHis passion for his second wife was much remarked upon by chroniclers; the chronicle of Machairas tells us how Peter always slept with Eleanora's night-dress in his arms:\n\nHe had three children from his second marriage to Eleanor:\nAs Peter II of Cyprus remained heirless, the crown of Cyprus was passed to his uncle James I of Cyprus, son of Hugh IV of Cyprus and Alix of Ibelin.\n\nNeighboring Muslim powers were potentially a great threat to Cyprus, the last Christian Crusader stronghold on the mainland of the Near East having been wiped out with the Fall of Acre in 1291. At the moment a new Islamic power had recently come to the fore, but the expanding Ottomans had their eye fixed on what remained of the Byzantine Empire. In addition, they were primarily a land power, and for the moment the remaining Latin Christian entities in the region could hold their own on the seas. Along with the Knights of Saint John (the Hospitallers) the kings of Cyprus were the main inheritors of the Crusading tradition. Peter founded the chivalric Order of the Sword in 1347, which was dedicated to the recovery of Jerusalem.\n\nThe royal family were in fact the titular kings of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, who had fled to the island just off the coast of the Levant. Reduced as they were, this Crusader heritage continued in the form of sea-borne raids, and were remarkably successful given their limited resources.\n\nUnlike his father, Peter decided to embrace this tradition and began with in a raid on Korikos, a fortified harbour in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. His primary focus of activity was along the coast of Asia Minor, since the Christian Armenians in Cilicia had strong relations with the Kingdom of Cyprus via marriage ties. In January 1360, the residents of Korikos sent their representatives to Cyprus to ask for protection, since their city was threatened by the Turks. Peter sent some of his men led by the knight Roberto de Luisignan. The Turks were unable to break the Cypriot siege of Korikos.\n\nThe siege of Korikos was seen as a threat by Muslim leaders of Asia Minor and they allied against Peter, planning to attack him on his home island. They attacked Cyprus with many ships but Peter obtained aid from the Knights of Saint John from Rhodes. Other help came from the Pope and even from pirates. In July 1361, Peter mustered a fleet of 120 ships. With his force, Peter attacked Asia Minor, continuing his policy of preemptive attacks. On 23 August 1361, Cypriot forces landed in Antalya and Peter conquered the city after a siege on 24 August 1361. After this victory, the remaining emirs of the region offered Peter an annual tribute. Peter accepted the offer and sent his flags, coats of arms and symbols to be raised in many cities of Asia Minor. He stayed in Antalya until 8 September 1361. Then he went to other cities, some of whose emirs knelt to him, gave him presents, keys to castles and many other gifts. He returned with his trophies to Cyprus on 22 September 1361.\n\nThe emir of Antalya, Teke, after he lost his city, took a large army and after many attacks tried to occupy his city. After hard fighting, Cypriots managed to keep the city and also to siege the guard in the region of Myrres.\n\nMeanwhile, King Peter still faced a serious problem of his recognition as holder of the throne of Cyprus, since his nephew Hugh, went to the Pope to ask for the throne with the support of the King of France. Since Peter had sent nobles as his representatives to the Pope to support him without result, he resolved to visit the Pope himself. At the end of October 1362, he left from Paphos to Rhodes and then to Venice and he was accepted there with honour. He went to Avignon and visited the Pope together with the claimant of the throne of Cyprus. Peter was recognised as King and Hugh agreed a high annual benefit, solving the problem.\n\nTaking advantage of his trip in Europe, he tried to convince powerful rulers to strengthen him by organizing a great crusade to liberate the Holy Land and the Kingdom of Jerusalem which belonged to him. That issue was discussed with the newly elected Pope, after the death of the previous incumbent. For the same reason he travelled to the England, Germany and France. During his visit in England the historical Banquet of the Five Kings took place.\n\nHe also visited some powerful cities like Genoa, Venice, Prague and Cracow, where he participated in a gathering of monarchs where guests of the Polish king were Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, King Louis I of Hungary, King Valdemar IV of Denmark, Siemowit III of Masovia, Bolko II of Świdnica, Władysław Opolczyk, Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, Bogislaw V, Duke of Pomerania, Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania, Otto V, Duke of Bavaria and Louis VI the Roman . During the festivities in Kraków King Peter achieved a feat of chivalry - he won the royal Tournament (medieval). Also travelled on, meeting several monarchs in London, at the meeting of kings of England, Scotland, France and Denmark. Everywhere he went he was accepted with honours and expensive presents, however he did not manage to persuade those monarchs to compete in a new Pan-European and Pan-Christian crusade in the Middle East.\n\nMeanwhile, Cyprus was governed by Prince John, brother of Peter who remained as vice-King, and faced many problems, such as the epidemics of 1363, which killed many residents of Cyprus (one of them was Eschiva, Peter's sister). The Turks who heard that the Cypriot people were dying, began new raids and pillages on the island. At the same time an episode between Cypriots and Genoese navies in Famagusta became a political issue and resulted in many fights and killings. Peter who happened to be in Genoa, negotiated and signed a treaty with the Genoese declaring what rights the Genoese colonists of Cyprus could have.\n\nHis father Hugh attempted to stop his desire to lead a new crusade and retake Jerusalem, but upon his death Peter began his plans in earnest. He travelled through Europe attempting to garner support for his expeditions and on 11 October 1365 he led a mixed Cypriot and Western force of Crusaders (on 70 ships) to sack Alexandria (see Alexandrian Crusade). However, the European knights refused to follow him to attack Cairo, and he was obliged to return to Cyprus, the only permanent result of his expedition being the enmity of the Sultan of Egypt. Reprisals followed against Christian merchants in Syria and Egypt, and Pope Urban V advised Peter to make peace with the Sultan after unsuccessfully attempting to raise support among the European monarchs.\n\nPeter continued his crusade, this time aiming to attack Beirut. However his military operations ended after intervention of the Venetians willing to offer Peter high compensations for his military preparations, in order to not attack Damascus. He crusaded and raided Tripoli in January 1366, before the terms of service of his European reinforcements could expire. He attempted to again raise a force in Europe in 1368, but was unsuccessful. Urban V again counseled peace, and Peter was compelled to join the Pope and the Venetians in making a peace treaty with Egypt.\n\nThe commerce with Middle East, benefited Cyprus a lot, and because of Peter, Famagusta was one of the richest cities in the Mediterranean during his time. Also some financier friends of Peter were rich tradesmen from Famagusta, who could influence him. But the Sultan could no longer tolerate the insult of the capture of Alexandria and could not accept a friendly arrangement with Peter. So the attack against Tripoli was a clear message to the Sultan; either he agreed a peace and could begin to trade, or he would suffer continued attacks. The sultan wanted to create a movement of distraction, so he strengthened the emirs of Asia Minor and assembled an army to attack Korikos. Peter reinforced the garrison in Korikos with fresh troops and they repulsed the Turkish attack. In May 1367, the garrison in Antalya revolted because of the delayed payment of their wages. Peter immediately sailed there and imposed order, decapitating the ring leaders of the revolt.\n\nAfter all of this it was finally agreed to make peace with the Sultan of Cairo, although it proved impossible to be signed. So in 1367 there were other attacks on the Syrian coast, recapture and pillaging of Tripoli and other cities across the Syrian coast. As Leontios Makhairas writes, the reason that Peter could not keep Tripoli was because the city did not have walls. Among the other cities pillaged by Cypriots was Latakia. So the peace with the sultan was difficult.\n\nFor all of his trips around Europe and of the wars, he needed a lot of money. Despite the high state income he needed to gain even more money, thus he gave to Cypriot serfs the right to buy their freedoms. By this rule, many Cypriots were benefited. Another source of income were his raids on the Islamic Levant.\n\nWhile in Rome, he received an appeal from the barons of Armenia, nominating him as King and imploring him to deliver their country. He returned to Cyprus, but was rapidly plunged into domestic troubles. Queen Eleanor had been unfaithful during his long absences in Europe, and he retaliated by tyrannizing her favorite nobles, alienating even his brothers. On 17 January 1369 he was assassinated by three of his own knights, in his own bed at the Palace of La Cava, Nicosia.\n\nDespite the harshness that brought a premature end to his life, his knight-errantry and crusading zeal led him to be regarded as the epitome of chivalry. He was buried in the church of St. Dominic's of Nicosia, the traditional burial place of the Kings of Cyprus. He was succeeded by his son Peter II.\n\n"}

{"id": "2063855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2063855", "title": "British Rail Class 319", "text": "British Rail Class 319\n\nThe British Rail Class 319 is a dual-voltage electric multiple unit train capable of operating on 25 kV 50 Hz AC from overhead wires or 750 V DC from a third rail. They were built by British Rail Engineering Limited's Holgate Road carriage works for use on north-south cross-London services.\n\nBuilt in two batches in 1987–88 and 1990, the units were primarily used on the then-new Thameslink service operating from Bedford to Brighton and various other destinations south of London. The majority of the fleet remained in use on the Thameslink route after its reshaping and privatisation in 1997. Some of the fleet was also used by Connex South Central and latterly Southern on various other services operating out of London Victoria, including flagship expresses to Brighton.\n\nSince delivery of new rolling stock for Thameslink services commenced in 2015, the Class 319 units have been redeployed for use in North West England on newly electrified lines but will be replaced in 2022 by surplus units.\n\nOf the 86 Class 319s built, 34 remain in active service, nineteen with Northern Trains and fifteen with West Midlands Trains. As of November 2019, eleven units have been converted to dual mode s, with another 27 due for conversion. One has been converted to a tri-mode Class 799 which runs on hydrogen.\n\nPlans for north-south railways across central London go back to the 1940s at least, when there were several proposals in the 1943 County of London Plan which were developed further in a following report in 1946.\n\nThe Victoria line, which opened in stages from 1968, was one of the routes suggested in these plans, but reviving the Farringdon to Blackfriars route for passenger trains began to be considered seriously in the 1970s. The British Railways Board then developed plans for what would become Thameslink, and the newly-created business sector of Network SouthEast inherited responsibility for the project in 1986. Services between Bedford, Farringdon, Blackfriars and Brighton began under the Thameslink brand in 1988.\n\nAs the Thameslink service was to use a route with 25 kV AC OHLE north of Farringdon and along the branch to Moorgate, and 750 V DC third-rail electrification south of Farringdon, the Class 319 trains were equipped for dual-voltage operation, making them very versatile. They were also the first British Rail units to use modern thyristor control in place of a camshaft and resistor bank.\n\nThe body shape of the Class 319 is slightly different from contemporary electric units due to restrictions in the loading gauge in Kings Cross Tunnel, which meant that other dual-voltage units were not suitable. They were also required to have emergency end doors in the cabs, due to the twin single-bore layout of Smithfield tunnel preventing normal train evacuation.\n\nTwo sub-classes of Class 319 units, 60 Class 319/0s and 26 Class 319/1s, were originally built. Over the years, units have been refurbished, creating five sub-classes, of which four still exist.\n\nThe first batch of 60 units, built in 1987–88, was classified as Class 319/0. Units were numbered in the range 319001–060 and had a maximum speed of . Each unit consisted of four steel carriages: two outer driving trailers, an intermediate motor with a roof-mounted Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph and four DC GEC G315BZ traction motors (two per bogie), and an intermediate trailer housing a compressor, motor alternator and two toilets. Seating was standard-class only, in 2+3 layout.\n\nThe technical description of the unit formation is DTSO(A)+MSO+TSO+DTSO(B). Individual vehicles were numbered as follows:\nVehicles were numbered in two ranges, corresponding to units 319001–046 and 319047–060. The gaps in the number series (\"e.g.\" 77382–77429) were filled by the units, built around the same period.\n\nDTSO(B) originally featured a lockable sliding door between the driving cab and the first set of power doors and tip-up longitudinal seating to enable parcels to be carried securely. This facility was rarely used and the sliding door has since been removed.\n\nUnits 319001–013 are the remaining members of the 319/0 subclass; all others were converted to Class 319/2 or Class 319/4 in the late 1990s. One (319004) was scrapped in January 2020.\n\nBuilt in 1990, this second batch of 26 units was numbered in the range 319161–186. The formation of the second batch of sets was similar to that of the earlier units, with the addition of first-class seating at one end of the train for use on longer-distance Bedford to Brighton services. Like the first batch, standard-class seating was of a 2+3 layout in standard class. First-class seating was in 2+2 layout.\n\nUnits were formed in the arrangement DTCO+MSO+TSO+DTSO. Individual vehicles were numbered as follows:\nVehicles were numbered in two ranges, corresponding to units 319161–180 and 319181–186. A more modern Brecknell Willis high speed pantograph was also fitted.\n\nAll 319/1 units were converted to Class 319/3 in the late 1990s.\n\nIn the late 1990s, seven of the Class 319/0 sets were converted especially for use on Connex South Central express services between London Victoria and Brighton. Work carried out at Railcare Wolverton included new, lower-density seating, a disabled toilet, and a special 'lounge' seating area in the saloon space below the pantograph in the MSO, where stowage for a refreshment trolley and a small serving counter were also fitted.\n\nUnits involved were renumbered from the series 319014–020 to 319214–220. They retain their low-density layout, but the lounge area has been replaced by standard seating since their return to use on Thameslink services.\n\nIn the period 1997-99, Thameslink arranged for all of its 319/1 units to be converted at Eastleigh Works for use on the shorter-distance Luton to Sutton/Wimbledon services, then known as 'Thameslink CityMetro'. These units lost their first-class seating and were renumbered into the 319/3 series. They were painted in a navy-blue and yellow livery at this time.\n\nVarious refurbishments have taken place since 1999, including:\n\nUnits 319021-060 were refurbished for Thameslink at Railcare Wolverton in 1997/98. Work included the installation of a first-class compartment at one end, in the DTSO(A) vehicle and the removal of some seating in the centre of each vehicle to give 2+2 layout. Cosmetic improvements included new carpets and seat coverings, as well as application of the navy-blue Thameslink livery.\n\nUpon completion, these units were renumbered as 319421-460 and moved on to the Bedford to Brighton service, branded as 'Thameslink Cityflier'.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005, during the Thameslink blockade, some minor interior updating took place such as recovering seats with an updated Thameslink moquette. First-class compartments were refurbished with new carpet, retrimmed seats and chrome-plated heater panels, apart from unit 319444, which retained its 1997-designed interior.\n\nA later refresh was unveiled by the then new operator First Capital Connect on 26 October 2006. Unit 319425 was renamed \"Transforming Travel\" for the occasion and showcased the following improvements:\n\n\nThe refresh took place at Railcare Wolverton works and also featured both a mechanical overhaul (under the solebar) and a full exterior relivery, again in vinyl. Some Class 319/4 units have had their Stone Faiveley AMBR air and spring pantograph replaced by the more modern Brecknell Willis High Speed air-only pantograph design.\n\nAfter the withdrawal of the final six Class 319 units from the Thameslink network on 27 August 2017, just over half of the original Class 319 fleet is currently in service, with many currently in storage at Long Marston. 35 units (26 319/3s and nine 319/4s) are currently allocated to Northern Trains, with all but one of their 319/4 units due to be converted to \"Flex\" bi-mode units. West Midlands Trains is the only other operator of the Class 319, with three 319/0, all seven 319/2 and five 319/4 units currently on fleet. Great Western Railway have four Class 319s which are 319423, 319439, 319440 and 319449 and are currently based at Reading TMD for the use of crew training for readiness for the Class 769s.\n\nTo operate on newly electrified routes in the North West of England, Northern Rail received twenty Class 319/3 units after they were replaced by brand new units. The first Northern Rail service to be operated by Class 319s was the Liverpool Lime Street to Manchester Airport via Chat Moss service on 5 March 2015. From 17 May 2015, the Liverpool Lime Street to Wigan North Western via Huyton route followed suit.\n\nThe first batch of units which transferred to Northern Rail underwent a light refurbishment at Wolverton Works and were repainted into a dedicated Northern Electrics livery, although all of these units had been repainted into Northern's livery by mid 2018. The 750 V direct current (DC) third rail equipment was also removed.\n\nOther services now operated by Class 319s include Crewe to Liverpool via Earlestown, Liverpool to Warrington Bank Quay and Liverpool to Wigan North Western and Blackpool North. In April 2016, these units transferred to the then-new franchise operator Arriva Rail North, who have since leased an additional fifteen Class 319s to operate on newly electrified services from , with these commencing in May 2018.\n\nIn December 2016, it was announced that Northern's allocation of 319/4s were to be converted to \"Flex\" bi-mode multiple units by Brush Traction at Loughborough, with the remaining 319/3s due to operate on existing and future electrified services.\n\nIn August 2019, it was confirmed that all 319s would leave Northern to be replaced by the 26 Class 323 units operated by West Midlands Trains. This is expected to occur once new rolling stock is in operation with West Midlands Trains in 2021. \n\nOn 1 March 2020, following the collapse of previous operator Arriva Rail North, the Northern 319s transferred to new government-owned operator Northern Trains.\n\nSeven units were transferred to London Midland in 2015 to operate the Watford Junction to St Albans service and some peak West Coast Main Line services out of London Euston. These replaced the seven units that transferred to Abellio ScotRail. In April 2017, one of the five Class 319/4 units, 319455, was swapped for 319433, with the latter receiving a light refresh and a repaint before entering service.\n\nIn December 2017, West Midlands Trains (a consortium of Abellio, JR East and Mitsui) took over the operation of the West Midlands rail franchise, with the seven Class 319 units initially leased by London Midland transferring to the new operator under the London Northwestern Railway brand.\n\nA week after the start of the new franchise, London Northwestern Railway leased additional Class 319 units, enabling the company to take their Class 350/1 and 350/3 \"Desiro\" units out of service for their planned refurbishment.\n\nLondon Northwestern Railway's allocation of Class 319s will be replaced during the current franchise by Class 730s.\n\nWith the first units entering service for Thameslink in 1987, Class 319s were a mainstay on the Thameslink network for almost three decades. In early 2015, the first batch of units were withdrawn from the network after being displaced by units.\n\nTwenty Class 319/3s transferred to Northern Rail for newly electrified lines in the North West, with the first units entering service in March 2015 after a light refurbishment. A further seven units left the network in 2015, transferring to London Midland to replace their units, which had transferred to Abellio ScotRail.\n\nSince the introduction of the new units in June 2016, Class 319s departed the network as new trains have entered service. A further batch of twelve units transferred to the North West of England for service with Arriva Rail North, with the remainder being placed into storage at Long Marston. The six remaining Class 319 units were withdrawn from Thameslink service on 27 August 2017, around 30 years after their initial introduction to service.\n\nSince their withdrawal, a number of additional units have been allocated to Northern and West Midlands Trains to boost capacity.\n\nWhen British Rail was privatised in the mid-1990s, the first 13 units (319001–013) were used for outer-suburban services by Connex South Central, with some temporarily losing their 25 kV AC overhead equipment.\n\nSeven more of the Class 319/0 sets (319014–020) were refurbished and dedicated to express services between London Victoria and Brighton, before later finding work on peak-only London Victoria to Guildford via West Croydon and London Victoria to Horsham via Three Bridges services. The dual-voltage capability was also used to introduce new services linking Rugby and Gatwick Airport via the West Coast and West London Lines in the 1990s.\n\nSuccessor company Southern continued to operate the fleet and reliveried it into its own colour scheme. It later went on to sublease Class 319/0 units to First Capital Connect for use on the Thameslink route, before eventually releasing the entire fleet.\n\nUnits 319008 \"Cheriton\" and 319009 \"Coquelles\" are notable for two reasons:\n\n\nNamed units are as follows:\n\n\nIn December 2016, Arriva UK Trains subsidiary Northern and Porterbrook announced a plan to convert eight Class 319/4 electric multiple units to bi-mode units, to allow through working between electrified and non-electrified routes. These units, which were initially marketed as \"Class 319 Flex\" before being designated as Class 769 under TOPS, will use two diesel powered alternators fitted under each of the driving trailer vehicles, to power the traction motors through the train's existing DC bus.\n\nThe modifications, which will be carried out by Brush, will enable units to operate on electrified and non-electrified routes, using both 25 kV AC overhead wires and 750 V DC third rail. Each generator set will consist of a MAN D2876 diesel engine driving an ABB alternator. The first units were expected to enter service with Northern by spring 2018, but were delayed until 2019, and now 2020 with new operator Northern Trains.\n\nOther planned operators of the Class 769 include Transport for Wales and Great Western Railway, with the allocation for the latter retaining their third rail pick up shoes.\n\nOne Class 319, 319001, has been converted to a Class 799. It will run on hydrogen.\n\nIn 2020 GB Railfreight used a Class 319 in a trial of a parcel delivery service.\n\n\n"}

It was the first steam railway in the capital, the first to be built specifically for passengers, and the first entirely elevated railway.\nThe idea for the line came from Colonel George Thomas Landmann, until 1824 a Royal Engineer, and George Walter, and the company was floated at a meeting on 25 November 1831. It would run from close to London Bridge, convenient for journeys to the City. It would be some long, on a viaduct of 878 brick arches, some of them skew (see London Bridge-Greenwich Railway Viaduct), to avoid level crossings over the many streets which were already appearing in the south of London. Landmann planned to rent the arches out as workshops. The intention had been to descend to ground level after the Grand Surrey Canal but this was opposed by Parliament.\n\nThe first Act of Parliament was obtained in 1833 for a line from Tooley Street (now London Bridge) to London Street, Greenwich.\n\nThe ultimate intention was to reach Dover and there was much talk of a London to Gravesend extension from Greenwich. A scheme was presented to Parliament in 1836 but five others were competing and the bill failed on its second reading.\n\nThe line ran parallel with Tooley Street, crossing Blue Anchor Road, Corbetts Lane and the Grand Surrey Canal. From there it curved towards the first station, at Deptford High Street, and thence to Greenwich. The contractor was Hugh McIntosh. \n\nThe subsoil was a blackish peat, which gave considerable problems, and Landmann pioneered the use of concrete to reinforce the foundations. Even so, several of the piers near to Corbetts Lane moved four or five inches (100 - 125mm) out of the perpendicular and on 18 January 1836 two arches close to Tooley Street collapsed. Elsewhere, iron ties were used to prevent lateral spread in the brickwork. In 1840 many of the arches were improved by laying of concrete above them, with a layer of asphalt.\n\nBetween Deptford and Greenwich the River Ravensbourne was crossed at Deptford Creek by a balanced bridge to allow masted vessels to pass. Eight men operated it, but possibly because of trouble with the foundations it was unreliable. It was replaced in 1884 and again in 1963. \n\nOriginally the line had single parallel tracks of Stephenson gauge , fixed to stone blocks or sleepers. By 1840 there was a mixture of bridge rails, single parallel and double parallel rails (see Rail profile). The original rails caused excessive noise, and damage to structure and rolling stock. Bridge rails were used on the viaduct between Deptford and Greenwich initially, laid on longitudinal timbers with cross sleepers at four-foot intervals. At this time, new double parallel rails of 78 lb. to the yard were laid for a quarter of mile (400m) at Deptford on timber sleepers, presumably as an experiment. The concrete underlay was replaced with gravel ballast of thickness.\n\nThe first section, between Spa Road and Deptford, opened on 8 February 1836: demonstration trains had been running from mid-1835 including Corbett's Lane Temp Station. These were suspended for a while after a derailment in November, but resumed the following year, with rumours circulating that trains had reached . On the Whit Monday following the official opening, the line carried around 13,000 passengers. There was a fatal accident on 7 March, when Daniel Holmes was run over and a train collided with some carriages.\n\nIn 1837, \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" celebrated the railway project saying:\n\nThe line reached Bermondsey Street in October, and London Bridge on 14 December 1836 (Spa Road was no longer used as a stop at this time). At the other end, the line reached a temporary station at Church Row in Greenwich on 24 December 1838, having been delayed by problems with the Deptford Creek lift bridge. The present Greenwich station opened on 12 April 1840.\n\nThe first locomotives were one 2-2-0 built by Charles Tayleur and Company and three by William Marshall of Gravesend, of which one was 2-2-2. All would appear to be of the Stephenson \"Planet\" type. These were supplemented by two from Bury, subcontracted to George Forrester and Company. For the first time horizontal cylinders were mounted at the front of the locomotive outside the frame. While extremely successful for their time, they swayed so much they were referred to as \"Boxers\" and a trailing axle was added. In the next four years three more locos followed, one each by R and W Hawthorn and Robert Stephenson and Company, with three axles, and one by Day, Summers and Company. This latter one was modified with a trailing axle soon after delivery.\n\nOf the four locomotives built by Marshall, the first was named \"Royal William\". One of the other three was numbered 4 and carried the name \"Twells\", after John Twells, a director of the London and Greenwich Railway. Built in 1836, it was rated at . In 1845, it was sold to the Admiralty and was installed in , which was lost in 1848 during the search for the Northwest Passage.\n\nFirst and second class coaches were unusual in that the sole bars and headstocks were below the axles. The line being for much of its length on a viaduct, this was a safety measure, since in a derailment the coaches would drop only a few inches onto the rails.\n\nBetween 1836 and 1840, the line carried over 1.25 million passengers a year, benefitting it is thought from a developing tourist trade.\n\nOn 5 June 1839, the London and Croydon Railway (L&CR) opened. It shared the line between Tooley Street and Corbetts Lane (close to what is now Rotherhithe Road). It built its station between the L&GR station and Tooley Street. It is not clear when the station became known as London Bridge. \n\nIt is believed that at Corbetts Lane there was installed the first fixed signal used to control a junction, a white disc operated by the pointsman. This, or at night, a red light, showed that the route was set for Croydon. If the disc was edge on or a white light showed, the junction was set for Greenwich. \n\nIn 1840, two further acts were obtained, for laying additional lines as far as the junction at Corbetts Lane and for improvements and extensions to the stations at London Bridge. These were watched closely by a committee formed by the L&CR, the London and Brighton Railway (L&BR) and the proposed South Eastern Railway. At this time the L&GR and the L&CR exchanged stations to avoid crossing each other at Corbetts Lane. A resited station at Spa Road opened in 1842.\n\nThe increasing congestion of the lines approaching London Bridge and dissatisfaction with the high tolls charged by the L&GR caused the SER and the L&CR to build a new terminus at Bricklayers Arms. This opened in 1844, transferring most of their services, and reducing their fares accordingly. This reduction in toll revenues brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy. Prior to the opening of Bricklayers Arms it had approached the SER with a suggestion that they should either buy or lease the L&GR. The SER took some time to respond, and in the meanwhile the company received a similar offer from the L&BR and also negotiated reduced tolls with the L&CR. Eventually the SER agreed to lease the L&GR from 1 January 1845.\n\nThe L&GR continued in existence until January 1923 but its activities were restricted to receiving the annual rent from the SER and distributing it to shareholders.\n\nGreenwich was the terminus until 1878, when the cut-and-cover tunnel to Maze Hill was opened by the SER, linking it to the North Kent Line just west of Charlton. This ran beneath the grounds of the Queen's House and Greenwich Hospital, where the graveyard was excavated, remains being reinterred in East Greenwich Pleasaunce approximately to the east. The section between Charlton and Maze Hill opened in 1873, with Maze Hill the terminus until 1878. Westcombe Park railway station opened in 1879.\n\nThe layout of Greenwich station still partly shows that fact. The line from London, on a continuous viaduct, was almost straight, but after Greenwich it makes a sharp turn and dips into a tunnel. A space between the two tracks, for the locomotive 'escape route' to reverse the trains, disappeared in the 1990s when the station was altered to accommodate an extension to the Docklands Light Railway.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2063880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2063880", "title": "The Legend of Dragoon", "text": "The Legend of Dragoon\n\nThe Legend of Dragoon is a role-playing video game developed by SCE Japan Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation in 1999 in Japan, 2000 in North America, and 2001 in Europe. Set in the high fantasy land of Endiness, the game follows a group of warriors led by Dart Feld as they are caught in a war between Endiness' nations. The player guides Dart's party as 3D character models through pre-rendered environments, fighting battles using a combination of turn-based mechanics and real-time commands.\n\nThe game took three years to develop, with over one hundred staff members and development costs of $16 million. Yasuyuki Hasebe was the director, game designer and story writer. Shuhei Yoshida acted as producer, while the music was composed by Dennis Martin and Takeo Miratsu. The game was designed to promote player immersion, realism and cinematic style. Reception was generally positive, although several critics found it lacking compared to other PlayStation RPGs at the time. A commercial success, \"The Legend of Dragoon\" sold over one million copies worldwide, with most of those sales coming from North America.\n\n\"The Legend of Dragoon\" uses a turn-based style of gameplay with a quick time event-like mechanic called \"additions\". When the \"attack\" option is selected from the battle menu, two blue squares will appear on the screen and start to converge. If the player times the button press at the right time, they can continue the addition and do more damage. Characters will receive multiple additions over the course of the game, which have a longer chain and deal more damage. The longer additions, however, allow enemies the opportunity to counter. When they do, the player needs to time a different button press to continue their attack. All the party members eventually gain access to their titular \"Dragoon\" forms. While in Dragoon form, the characters materialize armor and wings and gain a boost in attack power as well as access to alternate attacks. Dragoon form is only usable for a limited number of turns and must recharge to be used again.\n\nThe story begins when Dart, the protagonist, is heading home from a five year long journey to pursue the Black Monster, a being that killed his parents and destroyed his birth city, Neet. On the way, he is attacked by a mantis-like dragon controlled by the Sandora, a rebel faction in the Serdian civil war. Dart is saved by a mysterious woman named Rose, though they soon part ways. As he arrives at his hometown, Seles, he discovers that it has been destroyed by Sandora, and that Shana, Dart's childhood friend, has been taken away. Dart sets out to rescue her. Throughout the game, he is periodically joined by people that he helps along the way.\n\nAfter rescuing Shana and going to Serdian castle, King Albert sends the party to defend the fort-city of Hoax against attacks from Sandora. During the Sandora's surprise attack on Hoax, Dart gains the ability to transform into a Dragoon by using the Dragoon Spirit of the Red-Eyed Dragon he carried around as his father's memento. With the fort safe, they travel to the city of Lohan where they meet a man named Lloyd, supposedly the greatest swordsman in the world. Later they discover that he kidnapped King Albert and took the Moon Gem from him, an ancient artifact held by the Royal Family. The king is rescued, but Lloyd escapes with the Moon Gem.\n\nThe party soon discovers that Lloyd is gathering similar artifacts held by human kings since the days of the Winglies' empire, a race of humanoids that could fly and use magic. While the party tries to reverse Lloyd's work, Lloyd manages to obtain all three of the artifacts, and also manages to obtain the Dragoon Spirit of the Divine Dragon, the most powerful dragon in the world. Dart and the party finally manage to defeat Lloyd, who then agrees to take them to Emperor Diaz, the ancient Emperor of Gloriano during the Dragon Campaign. Emperor Diaz reveals several things to the party.\n\nDuring the height of the Wingly reign over 11,000 years ago a creature called the Virage Embryo, also known as the God of Destruction, came to the world to end all other life. Before it could be born, the Winglies used their magic to separate its body from its soul, making it unable to destroy them. They then cast the body into the sky, where it became the Moon That Never Sets, and sealed it using several magical Signets, one in each of the ancient Wingly cities, to prevent the soul and body from reuniting. The soul of the God of Destruction was originally placed inside the Crystal Sphere, which was worn by the ancient Wingly ruler Melbu Frahma to increase his power. However, when Dragoons attacked the Wingly capital of Kadessa, the Crystal Sphere was shattered during the fight between Melbu Frahma and Zieg Feld, leader of the Dragoons.\n\nEver since, the soul of the God of Destruction has wandered the Earth and, every one hundred and eight years, possesses the body of a human child in an attempt to return to its body. The body can be summoned if the Signets are destroyed, which can be done using the immense magical power contained within the artifacts that Lloyd gathered. In present day, the human that is the soul of the God of Destruction is Shana. Emperor Diaz then reveals himself to be Zieg Feld, Dart's father and leader of the Dragoons that fought alongside Rose in the Dragon Campaign. After Zieg defeated Melbu Frahma 11,000 years ago, Melbu cast a spell that both petrified him and kept his own spirit alive within Zieg's body. Finally, it is revealed that Rose is the Black Monster that destroyed Dart's birth city, in an attempt to kill the person carrying the soul of the God of Destruction.\n\nAfter all this is revealed, Zieg – who is being possessed by Melbu Frahma – takes Shana away and proceeds to destroy the remaining three Signet Spheres that seal the Moon That Never Sets, which is the flesh of the God of Destruction, causing it to fall from the sky. He then carries Shana to the body of the God of Destruction, so that the body will sense the presence of its soul and prepare to restore itself. Instead, Melbu Frahma unites with the body himself, taking the form and power of the God of Destruction. Zieg is released from Melbu Frahma's possession, and aids the party in their attempt to defeat Melbu. The party defeats him, but at the cost of Rose and Zieg who sacrifice themselves to destroy Melbu Frahma. The surviving party members manage to return home to live their own lives.\n\n\"The Legend of Dragoon\" was developed by SCE Japan Studio, a first-party studio for Sony Computer Entertainment. As the studio were also creating teams for the production of \"Ape Escape\" and \"Ico\", development on \"The Legend of Dragoon\" began in 1996 with a very small team. The game was directed and designed by Yasuyuki Hasebe, who also created the basic story. The producer was Shuhei Yoshida, and was the both one of the last and one of the largest project he worked on prior to leaving SCE Japan Studio. Kenichi Iwata was the game's art director and designer of the Dragoon armor, working on character designs alongside Tatsuya Nakamura. The game's monsters were designed by Itsuo Itoh, and the dragons were created by Hirohiko Iyoku. The script was written and supervised by Takehiro Kaminagayoshi. The team were assisted in producing the game's CGI cutscenes by Sony's internal studio Polyphony Digital.\n\nProduction of \"The Legend of Dragoon\" lasted three years. While the team started small, it eventually grew to 100 staff members and had a budget of $16 million, both considered very large for a PlayStation game. The \"Addition\" battle system was designed to make players feel like they were actively participating in a battle rather than selecting commands and waiting for actions to finish. The team's wish for realism also resulted in magic—a common character ability in RPGs—only being incorporated into the Dragoon state or through items with equivalent effects.\n\nThere were originally no plans for CGI movies as the character models were polygon-based and there would be a disconnect between real-time and CGI graphics. Eventually it was decided to include CGI movies for key events because they looked \"cool\", with their main theme being watching characters flying through the air, but ground and environmental effects were added; a noted effect was smoke, which was challenging for the developers due to it being their first time handling it. When designing the game's real-time lighting, which was designed to emulate the lighting used in CGI cutscenes, the team focused on what parts the player would be drawn to, allowing economical use of lighting. The amount of CGI movies and pre-rendered backgrounds meant that the game had to be spread across four CDs, which was the maximum number of discs possible for a single PlayStation case.\n\nAccording to Yoshida, a dedicated team of ten artists worked on the game's concept art. When creating character names, the team created 100 names from the letters A to N, then picked out the best-liked and attached them to characters who best fitted them. Iwata originally had no hand in designing the characters, but after noting the anime aesthetic of his designs, the team decided to have main characters designed by Iwata. Iwata originally only designed Dart and Rose, with Rose's hair being a bright green. As the setting shifted towards a more realistic tone, elements such as Rose's green hair were removed. The characters were given key colors so players could easily distinguish them from each other, with each color matching a character's personality.\n\nThe music of \"The Legend of Dragoon\" was co-composed by Dennis Martin and Takeo Miratsu. Martin was an American-born composer with a resume including Japanese television series \"Rasen\" for TV Asahi, while Miratsu had worked on the music of \"Jumping Flash!\" and its sequel in addition to forming one half of the duo Twin Amadeus. Martin was both the soundtrack programmer and pianist. The soundtrack also featured contributions from guitarist Chuei Yoshikawa, bass work by Jonathan Maron, percussion from Ray Grappone, and saxophone by Jay Rodriguez. The synthesizer operator was Tetsuo Yamazaki. Recording was split between the Tokyo-based SEDIC and the Sound On Sound studio in New York. Mixing was also done at Sound On Sound. \"The Legend of Dragoon\" was Martin's first work for a video game, having been brought on board due to Sony wanting a different style to other RPGs at the time. Martin was originally intended to compose all the game's music himself, but the game's 4 CD length made this impractical, so Miratsu was brought on board by the Japanese staff. During their time on the project, Martin and Miratsu never met, although Martin stated that having a native Japanese composer with a different style to his broadened the soundtrack's variety.\n\nDuring the early parts of development, Martin had trouble getting going on the project, citing the patience and help of the main production team in finding a suitable style and pace for the music. When creating the game's soundtrack, Martin was mostly given a free hand, although he did need to fulfill requests from the production team on both the soundtrack's overall style and individual pieces. During his early work, Martin focused on percussion and ethnic instruments, but the team wanted \"strong melodies\" for the game. As he was afraid such melodies would get tiresome due to the requirement to loop several times during gameplay, he added groove elements to negate the issue as he felt groove \"[could] loop forever\". Martin used the game's artwork and storyboards for inspiration when creating the tracks. One of the two demo discs Martin submitted became the music for the opening CGI cutscene. Martin found the limited PlayStation hardware frustrating for compositions. The game's main theme, \"If You Still Believe\", was performed by Elsa Raven. The song was composed, written and produced and Martin. Recording for different parts of the theme song was split between Tokyo and New York.\n\nAn original soundtrack album for the game was released in Japan on January 21, 2000 by SPE Visual Works. The main theme \"If You Still Believe\" was included in the compilation album \"Game Music Collection ～Sony Computer Entertainment Japan Best～\", published by King Records on January 23, 2005. RPGFan's Lucy Rzeminski called the album \"a passable CD if you give it a chance to sink in\", praising some tracks but finding most of the album lacking in both quality and variety. Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online gave the album a score of 6/10, saying that while innovative at the time, had been superseded in quality by later soundtracks and called it a buy for established fans of the game despite the album missing several tracks from the game. Both critics praised \"If You Still Believe\" as a high-quality theme song.\n\n\"The Legend of Dragoon\" was first announced in September 1999. Cutscenes from the game were earlier shown off at that year's SIGGRAPH event. It was among the games displayed at the 1999 Tokyo Game Show. The game released in Japan on December 2, 1999. The series was twice adapted following its Japanese release; a novelization written by Hiranari Izuno and published by Famitsu Bunko in March 2000, and a short-lived manga created by Ataru Cagiva published in a tankōbon by Enterbrain in June the same year.\n\nA North American release was confirmed by Sony in January 2000. Yoshida was able to personally supervise the North American release following his move from Japan to Sony's North American branch. The gameplay was adjusted based on feedback from Japanese players that it was too difficult, with Yoshida calling it the \"complete\" version. The game was released in North America on June 13, 2000. In Europe, the game was released on January 19, 2001. The game was re-released as a PlayStation Classic through PlayStation Network on December 22, 2010 in Japan and May 1, 2012 in North America. In a retrospective article about the series, Yoshida stated that a sequel was in pre-production after Yoshida left Japan, but it was cancelled for unknown reasons. Main protagonist Dart was also intended to be a downloadable content character for \"PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale\".\n\n\"The Legend of Dragoon\" was given a score of 74 out of 100 by review aggregate site Metacritic based on 12 reviews, indicating a \"mixed to average\" reception. The game was nominated at the 2001 D.I.C.E. Awards in the \"Console Role-Playing Game\" category.\n\nEric Bratcher reviewed the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"A vast, majestic game that emulates the weaknesses of \"FFVIII\" as well as the strengths. Still, it's a fantastic title with an incredibly compelling concept.\"\n\n\"The Legend of Dragoon\" received mixed to positive reviews. The game was praised by IGN for its graphics and cinematics. However, the combo system was criticized for requiring too much precision, while the titular element of Dragoon transformation was deemed inconsequential to gameplay. The game's battles were considered repetitious due to an excessive frequency of random encounters. GameSpot's Peter Bartholow was more critical of the game. Bartholow called it a \"highly generic RPG\" and stated that the game \"borrows too heavily from other games and lacks that 'hook' to make it worth dealing with excessive defending.\"\n\nUpon its debut in Japan, \"The Legend of Dragoon\" reached second place in charts behind \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\" with sales of over 160,000 units, being the best-selling new release that week. By 2007, the game had sold over 280,000 copies in Japan. According to Yoshida, sales in the United States were stronger than those in Japan, allowing the game to recoup its large budget. By 2007, \"The Legend of Dragoon\" had sold over 823,000 copies in North America. The game's PSN release topped the PlayStation Classics charts, and remained in the top five for the next three months.\n\n"}

In fact, few Europeans outside Russia actually saw issues of the magazine itself.\n\nFrom 1909, several of the \"miriskusniki\" (i.e., members of the movement) also participated in productions of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company based in Paris.\n\nThe artistic group was founded in November 1898 by a group of students that included Alexandre Benois, Konstantin Somov, Dmitry Filosofov, Léon Bakst, and Eugene Lansere. The starting moments for the new artistic group was organization of the \"Exhibition of Russian and Finnish Artists\" in the Stieglitz Museum of Applied Arts in Saint-Petersburg.\n\nThe magazine was co-founded in 1899 in St. Petersburg by Alexandre Benois, Léon Bakst, and Sergei Diaghilev (the Chief Editor). They aimed at assailing artistic standards of the obsolescent Peredvizhniki school and promoting artistic individualism and other principles of Art Nouveau. The theoretical declarations of the art movements were stated in Diaghilev's articles \"Difficult Questions\", \"Our Imaginary Degradation\", \"Permanent Struggle\", \"In Search of Beauty\", and \"The Fundamentals of Artistic Appreciation\" published in the N1/2 and N3/4 of the new journal.\n\nIn its \"classical period\" (1898-1904) the art group organized six exhibitions: 1899 (International), 1900, 1901 (At the Imperial Academy of Arts, Saint Petersburg), 1902 (Moscow and Saint Petersburg), 1903, 1906 (Saint Petersburg). The sixth exhibition was seen as a Diaghilev's attempt to prevent the separation from the Moscow members of the group who organized a separate \"Exhibition of 36 artists\" (1901) and later \"The Union of Russian Artists\" group (from 1903). The magazine ended in 1904.\n\nIn 1904-1910, \"Mir iskusstva\" did not exist as a separate artistic group. Its place was inherited by the Union of Russian Artists which continued officially until 1910 and unofficially until 1924. The Union included painters (Valentin Serov, Konstantin Korovin, Boris Kustodiev, Zinaida Serebriakova, Sergei Lednev-Schukin), illustrators (Ivan Bilibin, Konstantin Somov, Dmitry Mitrohin), restorators (Igor Grabar), and scenic designers (Nicholas Roerich, Serge Sudeikin).\n\nIn 1910 Benois published a critical article in the magazine \"Rech\"' about the Union of Russian Artists. \"Mir iskusstva\" was recreated. Nicholas Roerich became the new chairman. The group admitted new members including Nathan Altman, Vladimir Tatlin, and Martiros Saryan. Some said that the inclusion of Russian avant-garde painters demonstrated that the group had become an exhibition organization rather than an art movement. In 1917 the chairman of the group became Ivan Bilibin. The same year most members of the Jack of Diamonds entered the group.\n\nThe group organized numerous exhibitions: 1911, 1912, 1913, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918, 1921, 1922 Saint-Petersburg, Moscow). The last exhibition of \"Mir iskusstva\" was organized in Paris in 1927. Some members of the group entered the \"Zhar-Tsvet\" (Moscow, organized in 1924) and \"Four Arts\" (Moscow-Leningrad, organized in 1925) artistic movements.\n\nLike the English Pre-Raphaelites before them, Benois and his friends were disgusted with anti-aesthetic nature of modern industrial society and sought to consolidate all Neo-Romantic Russian artists under the banner of fighting Positivism in art.\n\nLike the Romantics before them, the \"miriskusniki\" promoted understanding and conservation of the art of previous epochs, particularly traditional folk art and the 18th-century rococo. Antoine Watteau was probably the single artist whom they admired the most.\n\nSuch Revivalist projects were treated by the \"miriskusniki\" humorously, in a spirit of self-parody. They were fascinated with masks and marionettes, with carnaval and puppet theater, with dreams and fairy-tales. Everything grotesque and playful appealed to them more than the serious and emotional. Their favorite city was Venice, so much so that Diaghilev and Stravinsky selected it as the place of their burial.\n\nAs for media, the \"miriskusniki\" preferred the light, airy effects of watercolor and gouache to full-scale oil paintings. Seeking to bring art into every house, they often designed interiors and books. Bakst and Benois revolutionized theatrical design with their ground-breaking decor for \"Cléopâtre\" (1909), \"Carnaval\" (1910), \"Petrushka\" (1911), and \"L'après-midi d'un faune\" (1912).\nApart from three founding fathers, active members of the \"World of Art\" included Mstislav Dobuzhinsky, Eugene Lansere, and Konstantin Somov. Exhibitions organized by the \"World of Art\" attracted many illustrious painters from Russia and abroad, notably Mikhail Vrubel, Mikhail Nesterov, and Isaac Levitan.\n\nHanna Chuchvaha, \"Art Periodical Culture in Late Imperial Russia (1898-1917).

The program commonly chronicles their wealthy lifestyles and action-packed, sometimes paranormal experiences.

Production continued on \"Catscratch\" until the final episode, \"Spindango Fundulation/Duck and Cover\" aired on February 10, 2007. After the initial run concluded, Nicktoons continued to show re-runs of the cartoon until January 2, 2009. It was briefly shown again on December 19, 2015.\n\nNote: All episodes were directed by Michael Girard, with only two episodes being co-directed by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Wenk of Common Sense Media gave the series 3 out of 5 stars; saying that, “\"Catscratch\" is a generic cartoon show that involves oddly drawn characters who don't really look like anything, very loud voices, very bright colors, and many instances of people and creatures and things being bashed, broken, and bonked. The show is a by-the-book program, but that doesn't mean it's not sometimes funny or even touching. Many kids will get a kick out of it, although you may not be as tolerant. There's nothing terribly wrong with it, but nothing terribly right, either.”\n\nConfirmed by an e-mail from Doug TenNapel, there were a few 2-page \"Catscratch\" comics in the works for Nickelodeon Magazine. The first one came out in the December/January 2005 issue. The second one came out in the March 2006 issue. The third and last one was in the February 2007 issue.\n\n\n"}

The dragon's color substitutes for race and class, with the addition of proficiencies (such as Chanting, Looting, Religion) and a character kit (including Dragon-Mage, Dragon-Priest, Dragon-Psionicist). Players also may experiment with half-dragon PCs, spawned from the union of polymorphed dragons and their demihuman vassals. The adventures of this setting occur in the Io's Blood Isles, a string of islands in a self-contained world.\n\nThe \"Council of Wyrms\" boxed set includes rules for playing dragon, half dragon, and dragon servant characters. It includes three rule books: one for the base rules, one for dragon family and clan histories, and one for adventure modules. \nThe setting of the campaign is a chain of islands called \"Io's Blood Isles\". These islands represent all major climates. It is separated from the rest of its fictional world by very large oceans.\n\nThe dragons on the islands are described as having a loose democratic government with a caretaker. Each dragon clan with a wyrm level dragon gets a vote on issues before the Council of Wyrms. The caretaker only gets a vote on tied issues. Thus dragonkind cooperates and makes decisions on issues affecting dragon welfare.\n\nHumans are not native to the islands, and those humans who come to the islands are mostly adventurous dragon slayers.\n\nAccording to the draconic myth described in the setting, the islands were created by the dragon god Io. Seeing his children, the dragons, engulfed in dragon war, Io cried out: \"If dragon blood must be spilled, then let it be mine!\" He then slashed open his belly with his own claws and spilled his blood into the oceans. The divine blood solidified and became a chain of islands. These islands Io gave to the dragons, hoping that they would be able to live there in peace.\n\nThe \"Council of Wyrms\" boxed set was designed by Bill Slavicsek, and published by TSR, Inc.\n\nIn 1999 the setting was slightly revised and reprinted as a hardcover book.\n\nRick Swan reviewed \"Council of Wyrms\" for \"Dragon\" magazine #213 (January 1995). He recommended this set for anyone who was \"an \"AD&D\" game player who's had your fill of wizards, who's fed up with fighters, who doesn't care if he ever lays eyes on another thief\". Swan did conclude that the set \"doesn't lend itself to long campaigns, since dragon PCs are too disruptive to function in traditional \"AD&D\" settings [...] But as a change of pace, the \"Council of Wyrms\" set is a roaring success.\"\n\n\"Council of Wyrms\" won the Origins Award for \"Best Roleplaying Adventure of 1994\".\n"}
{"id": "2063895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2063895", "title": "Education in Portugal", "text": "Education in Portugal\n\nEducation in Portugal is free and compulsory until the age of 18, when students complete their year 12. The education is regulated by the State through the Ministry of Education. There is a system of public education and also many private schools at all levels of education. The first Portuguese medieval universities, such as the University of Coimbra, were created in the 13th century, and the national higher education system is fully integrated into the European Higher Education Area.\n\nThe basic literacy rate of the Portuguese population is 99.44 (99.48 % male, 99.38 % female, aged 15-24). According to INE (Portuguese Institute for National Statistics), only 3.7 million Portuguese workers (67% of the working active population) completed basic education (81% of the working population attained the lower basic level of education and 12% attained the intermediate level of education).\n\nAccording to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015, the average Portuguese 15-year-old student, when rated in terms of reading literacy, mathematics and science knowledge, is placed significantly above the OECD's average, at a similar level as those students from Norway, Poland, Denmark and Belgium, with 501 points (493 is the average). The PISA results of the Portuguese students have been continuously improving, surpassing those of a number of other highly developed western countries like the US, Austria, France and Sweden.\n\nIn the beginnings of the Portuguese nationality, the Christian clergy was the main player in the educational endeavour. Portuguese universities have existed since 1290. Within the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded in 1792 the oldest engineering school of Latin America (the Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortificação e Desenho), as well as the oldest medical college of Asia (the Goa Medical College) in 1842.\n\nHowever, by the end of the 19th century the illiteracy rate was over 80 percent and higher education was reserved for a small percentage of the population. 68.1 percent of Portugal's population was still classified as illiterate by the 1930 census.<br> \n\nAlthough the militants of the First Republic had chosen education as one of their banner causes, the evidence shows that the more democratic First Republic was less successful than the authoritarian \"Estado Novo\" in expanding elementary education. Under the First Republic, literacy levels in children aged 7 to 14 registered a modest increase from 26 per cent in 1911 to 33 per cent in 1930. Under the \"Estado Novo\", literacy levels in children aged 7 to 14 increased to 56 per cent in 1940, 77 per cent in 1950 and 97 per cent in 1960.\n\nUnder Salazar the number of elementary schools grew from 7,000 in 1927 to 10,000 in 1940. While the illiteracy rate under the twenty years of the First Republic had only dropped a modest 9%, under Salazar in twenty years, the illiteracy rate dropped 21%, from 61,8% in 1930 to 40,4% in 1950. In 1940, the regime celebrated the fact that for the first time in Portuguese History, the majority of the population could read and write. Nevertheless Portugal's literacy rate by the 1940s and early 1950s was still low for North American and Western European standards at the time.\n\nIn 1952 a vast multi-pronged Plan for Popular Education was launched with the intent of finally extirpate illiteracy and put into school every child of school age. This plan included fines for parents who did not comply, and these were strictly enforced. By the late 1950s Portugal had succeed in pulling itself out of the educational abyss in which it had long found itself: illiteracy among children of school age virtually disappeared.\nFrom the 1960s, the country made public education available for all children between the ages of six and twelve, expanded a robust network of industrial and commercial technical schools aimed at intermediate education of future skilled workers (\"ensino médio\"), recognized the Portuguese Catholic University in 1971, and by 1973 a wave of new state-run universities were founded across mainland Portugal (the Minho University, the New University of Lisbon, the University of Évora, and the University of Aveiro - Veiga Simão was the Minister in charge for education by then).\n\nFrom the 1960s to the 1974 Carnation Revolution, secondary and university education experienced the fastest growth of Portuguese education's history. After 1974 the number of basic and secondary schools as well as of higher education institutions, increased until the end of the century, sometimes without the necessary allocation of quality material and qualified human resources.\n\nEducation more than basic (4th or 6th grade) wasn't affordable for most Portuguese families, the real democratization of education, specially secondary and higher education, only happened in the 1980s. After mid-2000s programs of modernization of schools (basic and secondary) and the construction of new elementary schools called \"educational centres\" (mostly to reduce the number of overloaded elementary schools, to widespread the 9 AM to 5h30 PM schedule system, because in most overloaded schools there are classes with 8 AM-1 PM schedule and other with 1 PM-6 PM) are being held.\n\nThe Bologna process for higher education has been adopted since 2006. However the higher-education rate in the country still remains the lowest in the European Union, this rate was around 7% in 2003 (Source: OECD (2003) Education at a Glance and OECD Statistical Compendium), and improved to 11% in 2007 - as compared to Slovakia's and Slovenia's around 16%; Germany's, Estonia, Spain's and Ireland's 28%; or Belgium's, Netherlands', Denmark's, Finland's, Cyprus's and UK's, over 30% (Source: EuroStat, March 2007).\n\nAccording to the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the average Portuguese 15-years old student was for many years underrated and underachieving in terms of reading literacy, mathematics and science knowledge in the OECD, nearly tied with the Italian and just above countries like Greece, Turkey and Mexico. However, since 2010, PISA results for Portuguese students improved dramatically.\n\nThe Portuguese Ministry of Education announced a 2010 report published by its office for educational evaluation GAVE (Gabinete de Avaliação do Ministério da Educação) which criticized the results of PISA 2009 report and claimed that the average Portuguese teenage student had profound handicaps in terms of expression, communication and logic, as well as a low performance when asked to solve problems. They also claimed that those fallacies are not exclusive of Portugal but indeed occur in other countries due to the way PISA was designed.\n\nDue to the Portuguese sovereign debt crisis in the late 2000s, and the subsequent IMF-EU financial assistance to the Portuguese Republic from 2011 onward, many universities and other higher education institutions suffered financially. Many were on verge of bankruptcy and were forced to increase its admissions and tuition fees as the budget dwindled and the staff members and bonuses were being reduced.\n\nStudents must turn 6 years old until the end of the civil year of entry in 1st year of school.\n\nEach school year starts in mid September and ends in mid June. There are three holiday breaks during the year: Christmas break (2 weeks), Carnival break (3 days) and Easter break (2 weeks). The school year is divided in three terms, usually limited by the following dates:\n\nAfter the end of the 3rd term, there are national exams during June and July for students in 9th, 11th and 12th years, and measurement exams in 2nd, 5th and 8th years.\n\nChildren from four months (the usual maternity leave) until they are three years old may frequent a nursery (\"Infantário\" or \"Creche\"). The large majority of nurseries are private. Other nurseries are run by the Portuguese Social Security and are partly financed by the state. In these nurseries parents pay according to their income.\n\nPre-primary education is optional from the ages of three to five, and is provided in both state-run and private kindergartens schools. State-run kindergartens provision is free of charge. The schools are known as \"Jardins de Infância\" (Kindergartens). Most international schools offer an international approach to pre-primary learning and follow a curriculum such as the International Baccalaureate.\n\nBasic Education \"(Ensino Básico)\" lasts for nine years divided into three stages of four, two and three years respectively. The stages are respectively \"1º Ciclo\" (1st Cycle), \"2º Ciclo\" (2nd Cycle) and \"3º Ciclo\" (3rd Cycle). You're required to do two exams at the end of the third stage: Portuguese and Maths. Secondary Education \"(Ensino Secundário)\"- public, private or cooperative - is compulsory since the school year of 2012/2013 and consists of a three-year cycle after basic education.\n\nAccess to Secondary Education is made through the Certificate of Basic Education. There are three types of programmes: general programmes, technical/vocational programmes, and artistic programmes, providing instruction in technical, technological, professional fields and in the Portuguese language and culture. Permeability between the programmes is guaranteed. The teaching and practice of technical, technological or artistic programmes are provided by vocational schools and special schools for education in Arts.\n\nProgrammes are sanctioned by the \"Certificado de Habilitações do Ensino Secundário/Diploma de Ensino Secundário\" (Secondary School Credential/Diploma), which is the prerequisite for access to higher education through national access examination.\n\nIn Portugal, Basic Education consists of nine years of schooling divided into three sequential cycles of education of four, two and three years.\n\nChildren aged six by 15 September must be enrolled in their first school year in that calendar year. In addition, children who reach the age of six between 16 September and 31 December may be authorized to attend the first stage of education, provided a request is submitted by their parents or guardians to the school nearest to their residence (or place of work) during the annual enrollment period. State-run schools are free of charge; private school tuition is refunded by the State in part or fully, when state-run schools in the area are filled to capacity. The first cycle of basic mandatory education covers years 1st-4th, the second cycle years 5th-6th and the third cycle years 7th-9th. The curriculum contains only general education until the 9th year at which point vocational subjects are introduced.\n\nAt the end of each cycle, students take national evaluation exams for the subjects of Portuguese Language and Mathematics.\nSchools do not give (or sell) any books or materials; financial assistance is available for poorer families. The school books are chosen at school's level every four years.\n\n1st Cycle State-run schools are owned by the municipalities; all other State-run schools are owned by the State.\n\nAt State-run schools, 1st Cycle students and kindergarten students get free mid-morning or mid-afternoon snacks, generally consisting of a 20 cl milk carton.\n\n1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th years\n\nGeneral subjects:\n\n\nEnrichment Activities:\n\n\nFacultative:\n\n5th and 6th years\n\n\n7th, 8th and 9th years\n\n\n(*) In the 9th year the student has to choose between Visual Education, Technological Education, Music and Drama, according to the school's availability.\n\nIt is only after the 9th year of basic schooling that the Portuguese General\nEducation system branches out into different secondary programmes, a higher education-oriented (general secondary programmes), a work-oriented (technological secondary programmes) and an artistic-oriented programme. The conclusion of secondary education (general, technological or artistic programmes) with passing grades confers a diploma, which will certificate the qualification thus obtained and, in the case of work-oriented programmes the qualification for specific jobs.\nAll General and Technological programmes share the following subjects known as General Formation:\n\n\nSciences and Technologies\n\n\nSocial and Human Sciences\n\n\nSocio-Economic Sciences\n\n\nVisual Arts\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of 11th grade, students have national exams in the two specific subjects of their course. At the end of the 12th grade, the exams are in Portuguese language and the main subject of the course.\nThe access to higher education is made through a national online process, where the students enter the college by priority based on their grades.\n\nThe average of grades obtained in all subjects (now including Physical Education) represents a part of the application grade to enter college. The other part is based on the grade of the specific exams that the college requests, which are related with the course the student is applying for. The average of both averages is the application grade to college. That number is between zero and 20; the higher it is, the better the chance to enter the college.\n\nThere are also special modalities of school education. The programmes offered by vocational schools, those of the apprenticeship system and those of recurrent studies are considered as a special modality of school education. These programmes are not regular, because they are not included in the mainstream regular progression of the education system to which they are an alternative given that they were designed to respond to specific educational needs of different target-groups of the population.\n\nAll of these programmes offer initial vocational and education training, although the recurrent studies also offer general education. Recurrent education consists of non-regular programmes of study or modular or single units because they are not complete training cycles and they are not included in the regular progression of the education system. The recurrent education provides a second opportunity of training for those who did not undertake training at the normal age or who left school early. Recurrent education covers the three cycles of basic education and the secondary education.\n\nThe recurrent education is characterized by the flexibility and adaptability to the students’ learning cycle, availability, knowledge and experiences. The recurrent secondary education branches into two types of courses: the general course for those who want to continue their studies and the technical courses that are work-oriented and confer a level III vocational certificate, although they also permit the access to higher education. Any of the secondary courses, vocational courses, apprenticeship courses (level III), recurrent courses and others (artistic and those of technological schools) share a three-dimensional structure (although the importance of each dimension could vary according to the specific course):\n\na) general / socio-cultural\n\nb) specific / scientific\n\nc) technical / technological / practical / vocational\n\nThe Portuguese educational/vocational system is open. This means that once any student finishes his/her basic studies successfully he/she can choose, freely, any kind of course in any training domain/area. Any secondary course completed successfully allows the student apply to any course of higher education, independently of the training domain the student chose in the secondary level of education. However, to ingress college each superior course requires specific exams correspondent to subjects of a knowledge domain.\n\nIn Portugal, initial vocational education and training can be divided into two main modalities according to the Ministry responsible for the training:\n\na) Initial vocational education and training in the education system (under the regulation of the Ministry of Education):\n- The technological secondary courses are work-oriented and confer qualification for specific jobs, which correspond to the E.U. level III of vocational qualifications. There are eleven technological courses in the domain of natural sciences, arts, social-economic sciences and humanities;\n\n- The vocational schools courses are a special modality of education that has a primary goal: the development of youngsters’ vocational training. In this type of course the students spend most of their time in practical, technological, technical and artistic training, which allows the development of specific skills indispensable to an occupation. The vocational courses are drawn to give answers to both local and regional labour market needs. These courses function under the regulation of the Ministry of Education, although under the direct initiative and responsibility of civil society institutions, such as municipalities, enterprises, trade unions, etc. The vocational courses are available in the third cycle of basic education (level II) – only a few - and in the secondary education (level III).\n\n- The technical recurrent courses. In the secondary education, the recurrent studies branches into two different types of courses: the general courses and the technical courses. The latter are work-oriented, vocationally oriented to confer a level III vocational certificate;\n\n- The courses of initial qualification can be promoted by schools lecturing the third cycle of mandatory education. If it is necessary, schools can establish protocols with other institutions such as municipalities, enterprises or vocational training centres. These courses are open to a) youngsters who have a 9th grade diploma, without any vocational qualification, and who do not intend to continue their studies; and b) youngsters who, having reached fifteen years of age and attended the 9th grade, did not achieve the basic education certificate.\n\nb) Initial vocational education and training in the labour market (under the regulation of the Ministry of Labour and Social Solidarity through the Institute of Employment and Vocational Training):\n- Apprenticeship system. The apprenticeship courses are part of an initial vocational training system alternating between the school and the workplace, addressing mainly youngsters aged between fifteen and twenty five years who are not included in the mandatory school system. The training process alternates between the professional/vocational (where the socio-cultural, scientific-technological and the practice training in training context takes place) and the workplace (where the practice training in work context takes place).\n\nIn the mid-2000s, education policy was reorganised aiming more choice and better quality in vocational technical education. Enhanced and improved technical education programs where implemented in 2007 in an effort to revitalize this sector which had been almost discontinued after the Carnation Revolution of 1974, when many vocational technical schools were administratively upgraded to higher education technical colleges and other were simply closed. This happened despite those vocational technical schools have been generally regarded as reputed institutions with a record of very high standards in vocational technical education across the decades they were supplying the technical labor needs of the country.\n\nHigher education in Portugal is divided into two main subsystems: university and polytechnic. It is provided in autonomous universities, in university institutes, in polytechnic institutes and in separate university or polytechnic schools. The previous institutions can be either public, concordat or private. The university subsystem is intended to have a strong theoretical basis and to be highly research-oriented. The polytechnic subsystem is intended to provides a more practical training and is profession-oriented.\n\nDegrees in some fields such as medicine, law, natural sciences, economics, psychology or veterinary are only offered in the university system. Nursing, preschool education, accounting technician or health care technician degrees are only offered in the polytechnic system. The other fields, including engineering, technology, management, education, agriculture, sports, or humanities are found both in university and polytechnic systems.\n\nThe oldest university is the University of Coimbra founded in 1290, and the biggest by number of enrolled students is the University of Porto with about 28,000 students. The Catholic University of Portugal, the oldest \"non-state-run\" university (concordat status), was instituted by decree of the Holy See and is recognized by the Portuguese State since 1971. The current public polytechnic subsystem was founded in the 1980s, but is an evolution of previous systems of higher vocational education that existed before. So, although only integrated in the system in the 1980s, several polytechnic institutions are much older, some having their origins back to the 19th century (examples are the \"Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa\", the \" Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto\" and the \"Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra\").\n\nPrivate higher education institutions cannot operate if they are not recognized by the Ministry of Education. Access is regulated by the same procedures as those for state higher education institutions. The two systems of higher education (university and polytechnic) are linked and it is possible to transfer from one to the other by extraordinary competition. It is also possible to transfer from a public institution to a private one and vice versa. Admission to public university programmes are often more demanding and selective than to their equivalent in public polytechnic and private institutions. Many specific university institutions and degrees are also regarded as more prestigious and reputed than their peers from the polytechnic system or from certain less notable university institutions.\n\nTraditionally, the Portuguese universities were organized in autonomous schools, each designated \"faculdade\" (faculty). In the early 20th century, some higher education schools not integrated in universities were designated \"instituto superior\" (higher institute). When the present polytechnic system was created in the early 1980s, the standard designation adopted for the divisions of the polytechnic institutes was that of \"escola superior\" (higher school). The change of status and the integration of some institutions in universities or in polytechnics, keeping the original names, meant that presently universities can include divisions named faculties, higher institutes or schools and polytechnic institutes can include either higher schools or higher institutes.\n\nAfter the mid-2000s, with the approval of new legislation and the Bologna Process any polytechnic or university institution of Portugal, is able to award a first cycle of study, known as \"licenciatura\" plus a second cycle which confer the master's degree. Before that, this was the rule only for university institutions. Virtually all university institutions award master's degrees as a second cycle of study, but some university departments are offering integrated master's degrees (joint degrees) through a longer single cycle of study. Some polytechnic institutions offer the second study cycle in cooperation with a partner university. Doctorates are only awarded by the universities.\n\nThere are also special higher education institutions linked with the military and the police. These specific institutions have generally a good reputation and are popular among the youngsters because its courses are a passport to the military/police career. These state-run institutions are the Air Force Academy, the Military Academy, the Naval School and the \"Instituto Superior de Ciências Policiais e Segurança Interna\".\n\nOver 35% of college-age citizens (20 years old) attend one of the country's higher education institutions (compared with 50% in the United States and 35% in the OECD countries).\n\nMost student costs are supported with public money. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend a Portuguese state-run higher education institution and the attraction of new types of students (many as part-time students or in evening classes) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the college or university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).\n\nPortugal has two main systems of higher education:\n\n\nThe Bologna Process was a European reform process aimed at establishing a European Higher Education Area by 2010. It was an unusual process in that it was loosely structured and driven by the 45 countries participating in it in cooperation with a number of international organisations, including the Council of Europe.\n\nThe reform aim was to create by 2010 a higher education system in Europe, organised in such a way that:\n\n\nPortugal, like other European States, has conducted educational policies and reforms to accomplish these objectives. This include the reorganization of both university and polytechnic subsystems and the implementation of extensive legal and curricular changes. Since its field application in 2006 it has been widely contested by students (many lost an academic year with the change), and several universities had disrepute the concept by introducing integrated master's degrees in several courses.\n\nWhen Portugal adhered to the Bologna process (implemented in 2006 - 2007), a political decision was taken to maintain the names of some older degrees, but with new significances. This still causes some confusion, especially in fields like engineering, medicine or law, in which the access to the respective professions was made through a pre-Bologna \"licenciatura\" but are not accessible by a post-Bologna degree of the same name. In ascending order of importance, the academic degrees and other qualifications are:\n\n1 - \"Bacharelato\" (Bachelor's degree) - Academic title: \"Bacharel\" (Bachelour), abbreviation: \"Bach.\". The holders of a \"bacharelato\" in some fields could also have specific profissional titles like \"enfermeiro\" (nurse) or \"engenheiro técnico\" (engineering technologist).\n\n2 - \"Licenciatura\" (Licenciate degree) - Academic title: \"Licenciado\" (Licensee), abbreviation: \"Lic.\". The holders of a \"licenciatura\" in some fields could also have specific professional titles like \"engenheiro\" (engineer) or \"arquiteto\" (architect). Popularly but incorrectly, holders of a \"licenciatura\" were generically treated as \"doutor\" (doctor), abbreviated: \"Dr.\".\n\n3 - \"Mestrado\" (Master's degree) - Academic title: \"Mestre\" (Master). The \"Mestrado\" was not traditional in Portugal, only being introduced in the 1980s, as an intermediate degree between the \"licenciatura\" and the \"doutoramento\". \n\n4 - \"Pós-Graduação\" (Postgraduation) or \"Especialização \" (Specialization) - Academic title: No specific academic title. The \"Pós-Graduação\" and the \"Especialização\" are qualifications but not academic degrees, so their holders keep their previous degrees.\n\n5 - \"Doutoramento\" (Doctorate) - Academic title: \"Doutor\" (Doctor). \n\n6 - \"Agregação\" (Agregation) - Academic title: \"Professor Doutor\" (Professor Doctor). The \"Agregação\" is a qualification but not an academic degree, so their holders keep the \"Doutor\" degree.\n\nAdmission to state-run higher education level studies requires either a secondary school credential, \"Diploma de Ensino Secundário\", given after passing twelve study years, and the required ENES exams. An extraordinary exam process is available to anyone aged 23 or older. Admission to private institutions is at the total discretion of each school.\n\nEvery higher education institution has also a number of other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, international students, foreign students from the Lusosphere, degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions (academic transfer), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department.\n\nStudents must have studied the subjects for which they are entering to be prepared for the entrance exams, but they are not required to have previously specialised in any specific area at the secondary school. Students sit for one or more entrance exams, \"Concurso nacional\" for public institutions or \"Concurso local\" for private institutions. In addition to passing entrance exams, students must fulfil particular prerequisites for the chosen course.\n\nEnrollment is limited; each year the institution establishes the number of places available. This is called the \"numerus clausus\". For the public institutions the exam scores count for the final evaluation, which includes the secondary school average marks. Then the students have to choose six institutions/courses they prefer to attend, in preferential order. The ones, who reach the marks needed to attend the desired institution/course, given the attributed vacant, will be admitted. This means that the students could not be admitted at its first or second choice, but be admitted at the third or even sixth choice.\n\nIn some cases, those entering polytechnics or nursing and health technologies schools, should have some previous vocational training and preference will be given to applicants from the catchment area of the institution concerned. From the academic year 2005/2006 onwards, access rules have enforced minimum grades of 95 (out of 200) in the national access examinations for all candidates in every sector of public higher education. In practical terms, and unlike what happened in the past, the new rule meant the exclusion of a large number of applicants who otherwise would have been admitted with negative grades to the less selective courses of some public institutions, and consequently lead to a number of available places for students left vacant every year in many courses.\n\nEven without a complete secondary school education, anyone 23 or above can apply to state-run higher learning institution through the \"Exame Extraordinário de Avaliação de Capacidade para Acesso ao Ensino Superior\" (extraordinary exam to assess the capacity to enter higher-level studies), also called the \"Ad-Hoc\" exam.\nThe process consists of the general Portuguese exam, an interview to evaluate motivation and CV, and additional exams specific to each school and course, obligatorily written and oral.\nCandidates approved go through a separate \"numerus clausus\" or enroll directly at the discretion of the school's board.\n\nAs what happens with the \"Concurso Nacional\" through the Exames Nacionais do Ensino Secundário (ENES), the Extraordinary Exam Process for over-23-year-old candidates is more demanding and has a much higher selectiveness in public universities than in the public polytechnics. Humanities and other non-mathematical-intensive fields have also much higher admission rates than classical university engineering, economics or medicine. This implies that almost all new students admitted by this extraordinary process enter a polytechnic institution, private institution, or humanities programmes.\n\nTraining of pre-primary and primary/basic school teachers\n\nTeachers of basic education attend 4-year courses in \"Escolas Superiores de Educação\" or at the universities to obtain a \"Licenciado\" degree.\n\nThe government as passed a law (February/2007) that makes a teacher to have also a \" mestre \" degree in Basic and Secondary Education.\n\nTraining of secondary school teachers\n\nTeachers of secondary education must hold a \"Licenciado\" degree and follow courses that last for between four and six years. Studies are sanctioned by a \"Licenciado em Ensino\" or a \"Licenciatura - Ramo de Formação Educacional\", according to the issuing institution. Educators and basic and secondary education teachers, with practice in regular or special education, may obtain a qualification to teach in specialized education. Continuous training for teachers is offered in \"Centros de Formação Continua\".\n\nThe government as passed a law (February/2007) that makes a teacher to have also a \" mestre \" degree in Basic and Secondary Education.\n\nTraining of higher education teachers\nTeachers at this level receive no formal professional training, but minimum qualifications are laid down for each category.\n\nUniversity: estagiário (Licenciado); (Mestre); professor auxiliar (Doutor); professor associado (Doutor and five years' service); professor catedrático (Agregação and three years' service).\n\nPolytechnics: (Licenciado); professor adjunto (Mestre or DESE); professor coordenador (Doutor and 3-years' service).\n\nAt present, distance higher education is provided by the Universidade Aberta (\"Open University\").\n\nPrivate Basic and Secondary schools and also private higher education institutions do exist in Portugal and are sometimes elite institutions (like the Universidade Católica Portuguesa in Lisbon and Porto, or some private primary, basic and secondary schools, mainly located in the biggest cities), existing among them many religious or speciality institutions. Many of the best ranked secondary schools in the country are private schools, as well as some of the worst ranked secondary schools. This secondary schools ranking has been released every year in Portugal, and is based on the student's average grades in the National Examinations which are used for higher education admission.\n\nAmong the best ranked public and private secondary schools are those of Lisbon, Porto and Coimbra. Schools from littoral areas are better ranked than schools from interior and less populated regions. The worst gap between internal school marks by course and the national examination marks is seen among private schools, with higher grades attributed by the school to students who perform poorly in the national examinations.\n\nSome Portuguese employers and families are of the opinion that the existence of private education institutions, where accessibility is based primarily on ability to pay, is not as fair as the public system and could gloom the meritocracy concept, leading to easier entrance criteria and lower teaching standards. Some private institutions are known for making it easy for students to enter and also to get higher grades - as long as they pay. Others claim that the private systems could prevent a significant portion of Portugal's population from being able to attend these schools that is also unfair. The quotas imposed on public education institutions to create room for students from former Portuguese colonies, who get automatically a place in those institutions also creates a big problem in terms of fairness, as some of these students can enter with very low grades excluding a portion of the Portuguese born students from studying in the public institutions and first choice courses they want.\n\nOn the other side there are some people who prefer to attend private institutions because they don't trust in the public educational infrastructure they have near their residential area. This could be related with overcrowded classes, bad reputation, criminality levels, incidence of ethnic minorities generally considered problematic, lack of quality teaching staff or bad infrastructures in that specific institution.\n\nWithout large endowments like those received, for example, by many of the US private universities and colleges, and with little tradition of excellence in the sector, the private higher education institutions of Portugal, with a few exceptions, do not have either the financial support or the academic profile to reach the highest teaching and research standards of the major Portuguese public universities. In addition, a lack of collaboration between the most prominent private sector enterprises and the private universities is also restrictive, and represents another comparative disadvantage between public and private higher education institutions.\n\nTraditionally, public system's institutions are regarded in general as having higher quality and accountability, but private institutions have developed quickly after the \"25 de Abril\" revolution of 1974, and some have today a great reputation. There are both public and private institutions considered of the highest standard and quality. However, a large majority of Portuguese students attend public schools, universities and colleges because it is considerably less expensive than the private ones, the public system has a much older implantation, and for the other side it covers well the entire territory. There are also some students who simply desire and can afford to attend an elite private institution, even if they have availability to attend one of the largest or most renowned public institutions.\n\nA number of scandals and affairs involving private higher education institutions (\"Universidade Moderna\" (1998), \"Universidade Independente\" (2007) and \"Universidade Internacional\" (2009), among others), and a general perception of many of those institutions as having a tendentially relaxed teaching style with less rigorous criteria, have contributed to their poor reputation which originated a state-run inspection of private higher education institutions in 2007.\n\nThe teaching quality of Portuguese learning institutions depends on the population that is receiving the training, their family background support, the teaching staff quality and motivation, the sociocultural environment and the economical development of that population. In some ghettos, specially in Greater Lisbon's suburbs where many immigrants, immigrant descendants from PALOP countries, among some other ethnic minorities, are concentrated, and also areas with higher unemployment rates and other severe social problems, exist schools with generalized high dropout and juvenile delinquency rates. In Greater Porto, there are no African or other significant immigrant ghettos like in Lisbon, but there is a high dropout and juvenile delinquency rates among nationals from former rural areas, of humble origins or from ethnic minorities from specific districts or quarters.\n\nSchool violence in Portugal is not unique to public schools or the major urban centers. Public and private Portuguese schools have all experienced an increase in school violence. However, due to the general wealth and educational background of private school student's families, and the increased private security measures adopted, private schools have generally a lower level of violence.\n\nViolence in Portuguese schools became an educational issue for the first time during the 1990s, mainly through the persistence of parental associations and teacher claims. However, it must be said that this was not the first time that violence appeared in Portuguese schools as a significant situation. After the 25 de Abril revolution of 1974 the occurrence of violent situations reached the highest point. This was a politically socialized and framed violence, quite different from the kind of violence we can find today. That one had political programs, this one is quite anomic. Its origin is very diverse, from poverty to psychological problems. Theft, random or systematic physical aggression, bullying, destruction of school or teachers properties are realities which become current in many schools.\n\nIn May 2006, a television program was broadcast in RTP 1, titled \"Quando a violência vai à escola\" (When violence goes to the school) by journalist Mafalda Gameiro. Using hidden cameras in the classrooms, the program shows the violent behavior of many young students (with ages between 10 and 13 years old) inside the classroom of a very problematic unidentified school, and the chaos and fear often generated. Students and teachers privacy was also protected during image recording for TV. In 2004 and 2005, the Portuguese Ministry of Education reported over 1,200 aggressions inside Portuguese schools.\n\n\"Escola Segura\" provides a safety program to 11 thousand schools, it involves 600 police officers a day, 300 cars and 160 motorbikes.\n\nThere are some foreign international schools in Portugal, specially in Lisbon and Porto areas, and also in the Algarve region. These places have a large number of settled foreign families from high income countries. In general, they have good reputation.\n\nAljezur International School is a progressive English speaking international secondary school, with an excellent exam result history, and VVIS International School Algarve reports that it has obtained a 100% academic success rate for the last four years for first attempmt IGCSE examinations. Other private schools have obtained world-renowned status, including schools such as the Carlucci American International School of Lisbon (CAISL), VVIS International School Algarve, St Julian's School, Oeiras International School, St Dominic's International School, Prime School Trilingual International School and Vilamoura International School.\nThe latest addition to this set, is the Greenes Tutorial College, opening in September 2017, offering a tutorial method of learning. Greene's accepts students from all over the world to study a wide range of A level subjects and for the Greene's Geoscience Diploma.\n\nThere is one international school in Madeira Island Portugal.\n\nEscola da APEL is a non profit private Catholic School, founded 40 years ago in Funchal, with an excellent reputation. It offers the International Bacallaureate Diploma Programme and the Portuguese regular curriculum.\n\nEducation has been a subject of controversy in Portugal due to a number of erratic policies and the state of flux it has experienced by several long periods, particularly between the carnation revolution coup of 1974 to the Bologna process of 2007.\n\nThere has been also concerns related to the large dropout rates (mostly in the secondary and higher education systems), and the high multi generational functional illiteracy (48% functional illiterates in Portugal, among the adult population; all over U.S.A. 30 million (14% of adults) are functionally illiterate) and illiteracy rates (7.5% = ~ 800,000 illiterates) - a quite mediocre statistical record when compared with other developed countries of Europe, North America and Eastern Asia.\n\nThe failure of many private universities and other higher education institutions in providing higher education to students due to generalized lack of quality and rigour has also been a major problem - for several years those institutions were awarding degrees to thousands of people who were spread into the economically active population. Some higher education institutions, in particular from the private and polytechnic sector, have been regarded as true diploma mills. In the following decades after their creation in the 1970s and 1980s, the polytechnic institutions didn't assume their specific role as tertiary education vocational schools, which were created to award practical diplomas in more technical or basic fields.\n\nNon-university intermediate professionals and skilled workers for the industry, agriculture, commerce and other services where needed. As more new public university institutions were founded or expanded, polytechnics didn't feel comfortable with their subaltern status in the Portuguese higher education system and a desire to be upgraded into university-like institutions grew among the polytechnic institutions' administrations. This desire of emancipation and evolution from polytechnic status to university status, was not followed by better qualified teaching staff, better facilities for teaching or researching, or by a stronger curricula with a more selective admission criteria, comparable with those enforced by almost all public university institutions. Criteria ambiguity and the general lower standards in polytechnic higher education and admission, were fiercely criticised by education personalities like university rectors, regarding issues like the lack of admission exams in mathematics for polytechnic engineering applicants, and the proliferation of administration and management courses everywhere, many without a proper curriculum in mathematics, statistics and economics-related disciplines.\n\nAccording to studies and reports, in the 1990s and 2000s, a fast growth and proliferation of private higher education and state-run polytechnical institutions with lower educational standards and ambiguous academic integrity, was responsible for unnecessary and uneconomic allocation of resources with no adequate quality output in terms of both new highly qualified graduates and research.\n\nIn March 2008, a mega-protest hit many Portuguese cities along the country, joining over 85,000 basic and secondary school teachers from all the country in the capital city of Lisbon (March 8), criticizing the Portuguese Minister of Education Maria de Lurdes Rodrigues (\"XVII Governo Constitucional\" headed by PM José Sócrates) and her new policies, including a new system of teacher's evaluation.\n\nIn addition, the \"XVII Governo Constitucional\" (the government headed by PM José Sócrates), created a policy of certification and equivalence of qualifications for adult people with low levels of formal education who want a 4th, 6th, 9th or 12th grade equivalence without returning to school (for example, through this process, called \"Novas Oportunidades\", adults (18 years old and older) with the 9th grade might be granted an equivalence to the 12th grade after a process ranging from a part-time 3-month programme or a 1-day per week 8-month programme; those who have less than 9th grade have a similar programme to get the 9th grade certification and can then apply to the 12th grade programme). The curricula do not include any classical high school discipline or a traditional examination process. These diplomas are awarded based on vaguely construed life experience. Some critics alleged this policy was an effort to make up the poor national statistical indicators on education, with little impact on the quality of the work force's qualification of Portugal in the European Union context.\n\n\n\n"}

According to Jordanes, Berig led his people on three ships from Scandza (Scandinavia) to Gothiscandza (the Vistula Basin). They settled and then attacked the Rugians who lived on the shore and drove them away from their homes, subsequently winning a battle against the Vandals.\n\nArne Søby, a Danish historian, has nonetheless proposed that Cassiodorus, who wrote the original text on which Jordanes's work is based, invented him, with inspiration from the name of Βέρικος (Berikos or Verica). Some archaeological research indicates, however, that the transition of Oksywie culture into Wielbark culture was peaceful and its timing coincides with the appearance of new population of Scandinavian origins in previously uninhabited area (\"no man's land\") between the Oksywie and Przeworsk culture areas. \n\nThe 16th-century Swedish archbishop of Uppsala, Johannes Magnus in his history of the Swedes and Goths, was the first to publish a song known as the \"Ballad of Eric,\" about an early Gothic king called Eric, who bears some similarities to Berig. It was once thought to contain authentic folk tradition about the king, but it is now regarded as inaccurate. However, Magnus discusses king Berig separately as having united the Swedes and Goths some 400 years after Eric's death. \n\nIn popular culture, Berig is referenced (as Berik) in the song \"Three Ships of Berik, Pts. 1 and 2\" by Swedish symphonic metal band Therion.\n\n"}

This is also known as the prophet's dilemma.\n\nA self-defeating prophecy can be the result of rebellion to the prediction. If the audience of a prediction has an interest in seeing it falsified, and its fulfillment depends on their actions or inaction, their actions upon hearing it will make the prediction less plausible. If a prediction is made with this outcome specifically in mind, it is commonly referred to as reverse psychology or warning. Also, when working to make a premonition come true, one can inadvertently change the circumstances so much that the prophecy cannot come true.\n\nIt is important to distinguish a self-defeating prophecy from a self-fulfilling prophecy that predicts a negative outcome. If a prophecy of a negative outcome is made, and that negative outcome is achieved as a result of positive feedback, then it is a self-\"fulfilling\" prophecy. For example, if a group of people decide they will not be able to achieve a goal and stop working towards the goal as a result, their prophecy was self-fulfilling. Likewise, if a prediction of a negative outcome is made, but the outcome is positive because of negative feedback resulting from the rebellion, then that is a self-\"defeating\" prophecy.\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Gadareiks and the fifth generation since Berig settled with his people in Gothiscandza.

This migration would have allegedly taken place about 2030 years before Jordanes wrote his \"\"Origin of the Goths\"\".\n\nThe archaeological record shows that the population of the Gothic Wielbark culture (Poland) had indeed moved and settled in Ukraine and mixed with the previous populations of the Zarubintsy culture, where they formed the Chernyakhiv culture. This cultural movement is identified as the migration of the Goths from Gothiscandza to Oium, but not all scholars find the evidence compelling. \nJordanes (XXIV:121) also relates that Filimer expelled the witches, who were called \"haliurunnas\". These witches were condemned to seek refuge far away and were said to have given birth to the first Huns.\n\nThe Danish scholar Arne Søby Christensen has suggested that the name Filimer was made up by Cassiodorus, a suggestion that was favourably received among historians.\n"}

Despite its English name, it is usually depicted as a turtle entwined together with a snake. Furthermore, in East Asian mythology it is not called after either animal, but is instead known as the \"Black Warrior\" under various local pronunciations. It is known as Xuanwu in Chinese, Genbu in Japanese, Huyền Vũ in Vietnamese and Hyeonmu in Korean. It represents the north and the winter season, thus it is sometimes called Black Tortoise of the North ().\n\nIn Japan, it is one of the four guardian spirits that protect Kyoto and it is said that it protects the city on the north. Represented by the Kenkun Shrine, which is located on top of Mt Funaoka in Kyoto.\n\nThe creature's name is identical to that of the important Taoist god Xuanwu, who is sometimes (as in \"Journey to the West\") portrayed in the company of a turtle and a snake.\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, people often wore jade pendants that were in the shape of turtles. Because of the ancient Chinese influence on Japan, honorific titles and badges in Japan also often referred to the turtle or tortoise.\n\nThe northern gates of Chinese palaces were often named after the Xuanwu. Most famously, the Incident at Xuanwu Gate, where Li Shimin killed his brothers Jiancheng and Yuanji and seized power in a coup, took place at the north gate of the Taiji Palace, in the north of Chang'an.\n\nIn ancient China, the tortoise and the serpent were thought to be spiritual creatures symbolizing longevity. The Fujianese custom of building turtle-shaped tombs may have had to do with the desire to place the grave under the influence of the Black Tortoise.\n\nIn the classic novel \"Journey to the West\", Xuanwu was a king of the north who had two generals serving under him, a \"Tortoise General\" and a \"Snake General\". This god had a temple in the Wudang Mountains of Hubei and there are now a \"Tortoise Mountain\" and a \"Snake Mountain\" on opposite sides of a river near Wuhan, Hubei's capital. Taoist legend has it that Xuanwu was the prince of a Chinese ruler but was not interested in taking the throne, opting instead to leave his parents at age 16 and study Taoism. According to the legend, he eventually achieved divine status and was worshiped as a deity of the northern sky.\n\nOther Chinese legends also speak of how the \"Tortoise General\" and a \"Snake General\" came to be. During Xuanwu's study to achieve enlightenment and divine status, he was told that, in order to fully achieve divinity, he must purge all human flesh from his body. Since he had always eaten the food of the world, despite all his efforts, his stomach and intestines were still human. A god then came and changed his organs with divine ones. Once removed, the original stomach and intestines were said to have become a tortoise and a snake, respectively. The tortoise and snake became demons and terrorized people. Now divine, Xuanwu heard of this and returned to slay the monsters he had unleashed on the countryside. However, as the snake and tortoise showed remorse, he did not kill them but instead let them train under him to atone for their wrongdoings. They then became the Tortoise and Snake generals and assisted Xuanwu with his quests (another legend held that the mortal organs were tossed out to become Wuhan's Tortoise and Snake mountains).\n\nAccording to another source, once Xuanwu had begun his study of the Way, he discovered that he must purge himself of all of his past sins to become a god. He learned to achieve this by washing his stomach and intestines in the river. Washing his internal organs, his sins dissolved into the water in a dark, black form. These then formed into a black tortoise and a snake who terrorized the country. Once Xuanwu learned of this, he returned to subdue them as in the other story.\n\nAs with the other three Symbols, there are seven astrological \"Mansions\" (positions of the Moon) within the Black Tortoise. The names and determinative stars are:\n\n\n"}

The August 1941 edition of the paper featured the statement \"\"Smrt fašizmu, sloboda narodu\"\" (\"transl\". \"Death to fascism, freedom to the people\") on the cover, which was afterwards accepted as the official slogan of the entire resistance movement and was often quoted in post-war Yugoslavia.\n\nIts heyday was between 1952 and 1977 when its Wednesday edition (\"Vjesnik u srijedu\" or VUS) regularly achieved circulations of 100,000 and was widely read across Yugoslavia.\n\nFollowing Croatia's independence after its secession and the political turmoil in the early 1990s its once large circulation steadily began to dwindle. In 1990, after Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia, \"Vjesnik\" came under the control of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), at the time the ruling conservative party.

{"id": "2063951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2063951", "title": "Dunlop cheese", "text": "Dunlop cheese\n\nDunlop is a mild cheese or 'sweet-milk cheese' from Dunlop in East Ayrshire, Scotland. It resembles a soft Cheddar cheese in texture. Though it fell out of popularity some time after the end of the Second World War, it is now appreciated for its value in various recipes and for eating on its own or with a dram of whisky.\n\nIn the early 18th century Barbara Gilmour successfully manufactured a type of cheese till then unknown in Scotland, being made from unskimmed milk from Ayrshire cows. Her process was copied by her neighbours and 'Dunlop cheese' came into such demand, that whether made by Barbara, her neighbours, or by the housewives of adjoining parishes, it found a ready market. It is suggested that the spread of the cheese to other districts was largely through farmers who had settled there from Dunlop parish. Even William Cobbett himself pronounced it 'equal in quality to any cheese from Cheshire, Gloucestershire, or Wiltshire.\n\nGilmour was something of an evangelist in the matter of making sweet milk (unskimmed milk) cheese, and being a forthright and energetic character she traveled widely to teach the making of her Dunlop cheese, and so stimulated a nationwide demand. This demand stimulated merchants to visit Cunninghame, buy Dunlop cheese and sell it throughout the central lowlands of Scotland. Local cheese merchants from Kirktoun also bought up the cheese and took them to Glasgow for sale in the markets.\n\nThe new system for making cheese was widely copied and extended rapidly to many parts of Scotland by the end of the 18th century, even where traditionally sheep's milk cheese had been made. Nothing but skimmed milk having been used in the process of cheese making in this district, previously, all the cheese similarly made in the western counties received the appellation of \"Dunlop\" and in 1837 the \"Ayrshire Statistical Account\" records that 25,000 stones imperial were made in this parish annually. \n\nThe characteristics of Dunlop cheese are that it is a mild, sweet, buttery-tasting cheese with a semi-soft texture when young but maturing to a fudgey or hard texture after a few months. Dunlop cheese is soft and tasteless when turned out of the chesset or mould. It requires from six to twelve months to mature, and to acquire the light, elegant, charming flavour and fragrance peculiar to the Dunlop, it must be kept in a thoroughly dry place and be frequently turned upside-down, as it undergoes a slight fermentation which heaves it a little on the top. One drawback of Dunlop cheese is that its nearest direct competitor, New Cheddar cheese, being dry and hard, retains its weight while kept in stock, and it is also in the condition at an earlier date to be exhibited in cuts.\n\nSalt from the saltpans at Saltcoats was often used in the manufacture of Dunlop cheese. The salt contained magnesia and Epsom Salts (magnesium sulphate) which gave the cheese a pleasant and distinctive taste; indeed it was debated whether cheese made using cheaper imported mined salt could be called 'Dunlop' cheese.\n\nHistorically, poor transport had encouraged the making of butter and cheese from fresh milk due to its highly perishable nature; when the railways came in the 19th century, however, farmers were able to transport and sell their milk further afield, and much less was available for making cheese. Paterson records in 1866 that Dunlop cheese has to some extent been superseded by the Cheddar system of cheese-making.\n\nThe high value which was set on the Barbara Gilmour cheese for the purpose of roasting was very much confined to Ayrshire, where a farl of oat cake or supple scone spread with roasted cheese, and a bowl of milk, or whey, or tea, or cold water, made a highly relished and substantial meal, precluding in many families the use of bacon for breakfast. With the vast population of England cheese was only eaten 'raw' with loaf bread, usually spread with mustard, and accompanied with the inevitable pot of beer. For this purpose the dry Cheddar and dry and salt American cheese were the favourites. The very dryness and saltness heighten thirst, and therefore the relish of the beer.\n\nThe local production of Dunlop cheese ceased in around 1940, and has only been sporadic since the Second World War, however Dunlop and other cheeses are as of 2007 made at West Clerkland Farm just outside Stewarton on the Dunlop Road, and are also produced on Arran, Islay and elsewhere.\n\nThe Dunlop Cheese factory was sited near Dunlop railway station in what is now a housing estate, the memory of Dunlop cheese production being kept alive by the name 'Creamery Row'.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The population at the time of the 2016 census was 869.\n\nEast Preston is within the Halifax Regional Municipality. It was located East of another rural area, Preston. East Preston is accessible off of Trunk 7 or No 207 on Marine Drive through the Ross Road or the Mineville Road.\n\nEast Preston was founded in the 19th century. It is believed to have been named after Preston, Lancashire, England or Thomas Preston, a British army officer involved in the Boston Massacre the American Revolution. While it is often thought that the community is named after Rev. Richard Preston, the famous African Nova Scotia leader and minister, the community was established long before he arrived. Preston arrived after escaping American slavery, in search of his mother. She had escaped earlier and was settled in Preston, living free. He was so impressed that he took the name of her community as his surname. Rev. Preston started the two churches which are still located in this region. At first the two communities of East and North Preston were a whole. Known simply as Preston, soon the two would identify themselves differently by adding the North and East in front of it. East and North Preston are well known across the Maritimes; together they comprise the largest indigenous black community in Canada founded before the 20th century.\n\nAt one time when Preston was important as the source of market garden produce, East Preston also played an important role in supplying produce from small farm holdings. The area contains a large number of very popular lakes used for recreation. The boundaries of the Prestons have shrunken continually over the years. It once stretched from Porters Lake to the East, to well into the current confines of Dartmouth. Its current boundaries have been established since the mid-1970s.\n\nEast Preston was predominantly a Black Canadian community in its early days, descended from Black Loyalists who were relocated here by the Crown following the American Revolutionary War. To a degree the community has retained this traditional culture. But, with the demand for land and the growth of the city of Halifax, many people from other areas have joined the community. The local Recreation Centre and Black Baptist Church provide a focus for the many Black families. Currently, North Preston, has a nearly 100% Black population and East Preston currently has a Black population of about 80%. A road exists that directly connects the two villages of North Preston and East Preston.\n\nJust east of East Preston, the area around Porters Lake has had an in-migration of new residents and business. This community serves as a shopping district for East Preston and other surrounding communities.\n\n"}
{"id": "2063982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2063982", "title": "Carnival of Light", "text": "Carnival of Light\n\n\"Carnival of Light\" is an unreleased avant-garde recording by the English rock band the Beatles. It was commissioned for the Million Volt Light and Sound Rave, an event held at the Roundhouse in London on 28 January and 4 February 1967. Recorded during a session for \"Penny Lane\", \"Carnival of Light\" is nearly 14 minutes long and contains distorted, echo-laden sounds of percussion, keyboards, guitar and vocals. Its creation was initiated by Paul McCartney's interest in the London avant-garde scene and through his connection with the designers Binder, Edwards & Vaughan.\n\nSince the event, \"Carnival of Light\" has rarely been heard, and does not circulate on bootlegs. For McCartney, the piece came to hold significance in his efforts to be recognised as the first Beatle to fully engage with the avant-garde, over a year before John Lennon recorded \"Revolution 9\". In 1996, McCartney tried to release the track on the Beatles' \"Anthology 2\" compilation, but its inclusion was vetoed by his former bandmates. The tape was confirmed by McCartney to be in his possession in 2008. As of 2016, he was still considering the track's release.\n\nWith their August 1966 album \"Revolver\", the Beatles broke new ground in pop by departing from the genre's conventional notions of compositional form, instrumentation and engineering; in musicologist Walter Everett's description, it was also \"an innovative example of electronic music\". Around December, designer David Vaughan – part of the design collective Binder, Edwards & Vaughan (BEV) – painted a psychedelic design on a piano owned by Paul McCartney. When delivering the piano to McCartney's home in St John's Wood, he asked McCartney to contribute a musical piece for The Million Volt Light and Sound Rave. To Vaughan's surprise, McCartney agreed. This is the story offered in Barry Miles' 1997 biography \"\". Alternatively, McCartney later told music journalist Mark Ellen that it was Miles who asked him to contribute to the event, while author Howard Sounes said that Dudley Edwards of BEV asked McCartney for a musical contribution from the Beatles and received a tape of \"Carnival of Light\" soon afterwards.\n\nThe Million Volt Light and Sound Rave (sometimes referred to as \"The Carnival of Light Rave\") was an art festival organised by BEV as a showcase for electronic music and light shows. It was held at the Roundhouse Theatre in Chalk Farm, north London. Posters for the event promised \"music composed by Paul McCartney and Unit Delta Plus\". The latter was an electronic music group whose members included composers Delia Derbyshire and Brian Hodgson from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and synthesizer pioneer Peter Zinovieff. In preparation for the event, Edwards took McCartney to meet Zinovieff at the latter's house in Putney in south-west London. There, Zinovieff played them an experimental composition \"at such intense decibel frequencies\", according to Edwards, \"that many parts of my anatomy (including internal organs) began to perform an involuntary dance. I can only describe it as 'ecstatic twitching'.\"\n\nThe Beatles recorded the new piece for BEV on 5 January 1967, early in the sessions for the album that became \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". They started the work after completing overdubs on the song \"Penny Lane\". All four Beatles were present, as was George Martin, their producer. McCartney remembered initiating the recording by saying to his bandmates: \"this is a bit indulgent but would you mind giving me 10 minutes? I've been asked to do this thing. All I want you to do is just wander round all of the stuff and bang it, shout, play it.\" He said that the work was uncategorisable as a piece of music, but identified it as avant-garde and within the \"Stockhausen/John Cage bracket\". According to Beatles biographer Ian MacDonald, McCartney also intended to capture the spirit of AMM, a London-based experimental jazz group whose work he knew through Miles, and their aesthetic similarly informed the Beatles' recording of \"A Day in the Life\" later in January.\n\n\"Carnival of Light\" has no lyrics, although McCartney and John Lennon's voices are heard on the track. The band first created a basic track of drums and organ recorded at a fast speed, which made them sound deeper in pitch and slower in tempo. A large amount of reverb was applied to the instruments and to Lennon and McCartney's vocals. The two also recorded Native American war cries, whistling, close-miked gasping, genuine coughing and fragments of studio conversation. Other overdubs to the song include bursts of guitar feedback, organ, piano and electronic feedback with Lennon shouting \"Electricity!\" At one point, McCartney plays a version of \"Fixing a Hole\" on piano.\n\nWith reference to McCartney's credit on the poster for the rave, author Steve Turner says that as a \"musical freak-out\" by the four Beatles, \"Carnival of Light\" \"wasn't so much 'composed' by Paul as initiated by him\". Miles suggests that the piece \"most resembles 'The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet'\" from the Mothers of Invention's \"Freak Out!\", an album that he had given to McCartney in 1966 and which resounded with the latter's initial ideas for \"Sgt. Pepper\". Miles continues: \"except there is no rhythm and the music here is more fragmented, abstract and serious ... [A] beat is sometimes established for a few bars by the percussion or a rhythmic pounding on the piano. There is no melody, though snatches of a tune sometimes threaten to break through.\" Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn was granted access to the completed recording of \"Carnival of Light\" while compiling his 1988 book \"The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions\". He outlined the contents of the four-track tape:\n\nThe piece concludes with McCartney asking the studio engineer in an echo-soaked voice, \"Can we hear it back now?\" Lewisohn wrote that a rough mono mix was given to Vaughan, while Miles stated that the mixdown had \"full stereo separation\". After completing the session, according to engineer Geoff Emerick, Martin said: \"This is ridiculous. We've got to get our teeth into something constructive.\" Emerick wrote that Lennon's \"Barcelona\" yell and other \"bits and pieces\" from the \"Carnival of Light\" session were later recycled for \"Revolution 9\", the sound collage Lennon recorded with Yoko Ono in June 1968.\n\n\"Carnival of Light\" received its only public airing at the Million Volt Light and Sound Rave. None of the Beatles were at the rave. Instead, on 28 January, McCartney and George Harrison attended a Four Tops concert at the Royal Albert Hall. McCartney was angry with the organisers when he learned that the tape had been allowed to play on past the agreed point, thereby giving the crowd a preview of \"Fixing a Hole\". Edwards said this was not intentional, but that he and Doug Binder had been busy with the rave's light show. The piece was played several times during the two evenings.\n\nIn Hodgson's recollection, \"Carnival of Light\" was \"all rather a mess ... There seemed to be no coherence to what was on the tape.\" According to McCartney biographer Ian Peel, others who heard the recording were \"comprehensively underwhelmed\". Vaughan recalled: \"So all the music was live, apart from the f***ing tapes that Paul McCartney did. You know, where he thought he'd do something without words, that was very mysterious ... I don't think it was up to much.\" Daevid Allen of Soft Machine told Peel: \"I dimly remember the sound collage because it was not particularly memorable. He had obviously improved a bit by the time \"Sgt. Pepper\" was made.\"\n\nSince 1967, \"Carnival of Light\" has only been heard by \"Abbey Road insiders\", according to author Mark Brend, and has not circulated on bootlegs. Notwithstanding the Beatles' McCartney-led experimentation during the \"Sgt. Pepper\" period, it was Lennon who came to be identified as the band's revolutionary avant-gardist, through \"Revolution 9\" and other collaborations with Ono, including their 1968 album \"Two Virgins\". Harrison also became publicly associated with avant-garde experimentalism, with his late-1960s solo albums \"Wonderwall Music\" and \"Electronic Sound\", as did Ringo Starr, through his championing of Apple artist John Tavener; by comparison, according to music critic Richie Unterberger, McCartney retained \"the straightest public image of the four\". When asked about \"Carnival of Light\" in his interview for Lewisohn's 1988 book, McCartney likened the track to Harrison's forays into Indian music with the Beatles, and said he had recently renewed his interest in such experimental work.\n\nIn 1996, McCartney attempted to include \"Carnival of Light\" on the Beatles' compilation album \"Anthology 2\", but was vetoed by Harrison, Starr and Ono (as Lennon's widow) on the grounds that the track was never intended for a Beatles release. Later, McCartney recalled that \"The guys didn't like the idea, like 'this is rubbish'\".<ref name=\"Thorpe/Guardian\"></ref> He said that Harrison did not enjoy the avant-garde (\"as George would say, 'avant-garde a clue'\"). George Martin, who helped evaluate all the Beatles' recordings for inclusion on the \"Anthology\" CDs, also considered \"Carnival of Light\" unworthy of release. McCartney was motivated to include the track out of a wish to be recognised as the first Beatle to embrace avant-garde music, almost eighteen months before Lennon – who used to deride avant-garde as \"French for bullshit\" – recorded \"Revolution 9\".\n\nLewisohn assisted the Beatles in compiling the \"Anthology\" project. He said he advocated for the track to be included on \"Anthology 2\", but: \"It certainly didn't get beyond George, I'm not sure it got beyond Ringo or Yoko either. It was something that was going to, potentially, spotlight only Paul in a good way and I don't know that was something they collectively wanted.\" One of the few others to have heard \"Carnival of Light\", Barry Miles dismissed it as \"really dreadful\". He also said: \"It doesn't bear being released. It's just masses of echo. It sounds like they put it through twice. It was the same thing that everybody was doing at home.\" In Ian MacDonald's opinion, unlike the sensitivity AMM brought to their work, \"the Beatles merely bashed about at the same time, overdubbing without much thought, and relying on the Instant Art effects of tape-echo to produce something suitably 'far out'.\"\n\nIn a 2001 interview with Ellen, reproduced on the Rocking Vicar website the following April, McCartney said he was working on a photo collage film of the Beatles that was similar to another film he had created, \"Grateful Dead – A Photo Film\" (1995). He said he was planning to use \"Carnival of Light\" in the soundtrack. As of 2006, this project had yet to be seen and no part of the track had surfaced. During a 2004 interview, McCartney confirmed he still owned the master tapes and that \"the time has come for it to get its moment. I like it because it's the Beatles free, going off-piste.\" He would require the consent of Starr, Ono, and Harrison's widow Olivia Harrison to release the track.\n\nMusic journalist Michael Gallucci has described \"Carnival of Light\" as \"the holy grail of lost Beatles recordings\".<ref name=\"Gallucci/UCR\"></ref> Ian Peel devotes a full chapter to the track in his 2002 book \"The Unknown Paul McCartney: McCartney and the Avant-Garde\". In his comments to Peel, David Vaughan said of the importance of this avant-garde piece to McCartney: \"the idea of course was that he did it before John [Lennon]. They were a pain in the arse, the pair of them ... In fact they all were. They were always trying to upstage each other. I mean, who gives a f*** who was first for that one, do you know what I mean?\"\n\nIn a 2016 interview, McCartney stated that he was considering issuing unused Beatles recording takes and was still toying with the idea of releasing \"Carnival of Light\". Contrary to fans' expectations, it did not appear as a bonus track on the 50th anniversary editions of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\".<ref name=\"Marinucci/BB\"></ref> Giles Martin, who oversaw the new \"Sgt. Pepper\" stereo remix for this release, commented that the track was considered for inclusion, but \"it wasn't really part of \"Pepper\" ... It's a very different thing\", and that \"'Carnival of Light' was never meant to be a record, in fact. It's one of those things that fans talk about ... But it was meant for the Roundhouse.\" Martin expressed hope in \"do[ing] something interesting\" with the track in the future.<ref name=\"Sinclair/SDE\"></ref>\n\nAccording to Kenneth Womack:\n\n\nNotes\nReferences\n\n"}

In his early career, he was associated with the Kraków avant-garde led by Tadeusz Peiper who published \"Zwrotnica\" monthly. Ważyk wrote several collections of poetry in the interwar years. His work during this period focused largely on the losses of World War I.\n\nAs a member of the Communist Party of Poland, Ważyk belonged to a group of left-wing writers active in Warsaw in the 1930s. At the onset of World War II he escaped to the Soviet Union where he published articles for the \"Red Banner\" (Czerwony Sztandar). Later, he joined the Berling Army as political officer. After the war he was a very influential person. Initially a strong supporter of communism he became very critical later on. His \"Poem for Adults\" marks the end of the social realism era in Polish literature.\n\nDuring the War, Ważyk fought alongside Soviet troops on the Eastern Front, ending his military service with the victorious Lublin contingent. While still in the Polish Army, he founded \"Kuźnica\", a Marxist literary weekly, which eventually merged with \"Nowa Kultura\". Ważyk served as the editor of \"Kuźnica\" from 1946 to 1950, and from 1950 to 1954, he was editor of the literary journal \"Twórczość\". Although Ważyk was initially a strong supporter of Stalinism, he eventually rejected it, and criticised the results of Stalinism in Poland, at the time of its impending disintegration.\n\nWażyk is best remembered for \"A Poem for Adults\" (\"Poemat dla dorosłych\"), which he wrote in the summer of 1955, at the onset of Polish October revolution. The poem was published in the August 21st edition of \"Nowa Kultura\", a Polish literary weekly based in Warsaw – an official publication of the Association of Polish Writers controlled by the Communists. The fifteen-part poem paints a picture of grim reality of life in the stalinist Poland and the falsehood of dogmatic propaganda.\n\nIn part four, Ważyk speaks with open and deliberate contempt about the construction workers: \"a motley crew of outcasts crowding in shacks, barracks and hotels\" (\"zbieraną hałastrą tłoczą się w szopach, barakach, hotelach\") driven by their \"mongrel ambitions\" (\"wielka migracja, skudlona ambicja\") and dehumanizing the new Poland (\"masa wędrowna, Polska nieczłowiecza\"). The poem includes a memorable line in reference to French utopian socialist Fourier (part 12): \"They drink sea-water crying: lemonade! Return home secretly to vomit.\" It ends with a repeat call (part 15) for \"a just and congenial society built by the Communist Party\" (\"Upominamy się na ziemi o ludzi spracowanych [...] upominamy się codziennie, upominamy się Partią\").\n\nThe poem was an immediate success due to its strong critique of the stalinist Poland. After publication, it was recognized as the strongest political criticism run by the communist controlled press thus far. As a result, the government fired the head of \"Nowa Kultura\", Paweł Hoffmann, and made other changes to its staff. Ważyk was temporarily forced to remain silent. Newspapers and other official party organs were also instructed to denounce Ważyk and the poem. The association of Polish writers called a special session in order to condemn and expel Ważyk, however many writers supported Ważyk and he was not expelled.\n\nDespite government efforts to censor the poem after its publication, it was widely read throughout Poland. The issue quickly sold out, and it began selling for high prices on the black market. Hand written copies of the poem were also widely circulated. The poem's publication gave Ważyk a tremendous amount of notoriety as a voice of dissent. He was praised not only for his eloquent critiques of the stalinist regime, but also for his courage to make his views public. Ultimately disillusioned with Gomułka and Polish communism, Ważyk (along with many others) left the communist party in 1957. He worked as translator in the following years.\n"}
{"id": "2063996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2063996", "title": "Apology of Aristides", "text": "Apology of Aristides\n\nThe Apology of Aristides was written by the early Christian writer Aristides (fl. 2nd century). Until 1878, our knowledge of Aristides was confined to some references in works by Eusebius of Caesarea and Saint Jerome. Eusebius said that he was an Athenian philosopher and that Aristides and another apologist, Quadratus, delivered their Apologies directly to the Emperor Hadrian. Aristides is also credited with a sermon on Luke 23:43. Aristides remained a philosopher after his conversion to Christianity, and he continued to work as a philosopher in Athens.\n\nIn 1878, the Armenian monks of the Mechitarite convent in Venice published the first two chapters, which they had found in a manuscript in their collection in Armenian translation. This they accompanied with a Latin translation. Opinion as to the authenticity of the fragment was disputed, with Ernest Renan particularly vocal in opposition. Later, in 1889, J. Rendel Harris found the whole of it in a Syriac version at the Eastern Orthodox monastery of Saint Catherine's Monastery in Egypt. While his edition was passing through the press, it was observed that the work had been extant in Greek the whole time, though in a slightly abbreviated form, since it had been embedded as a speech in a religious novel written about the 6th century entitled \"The Life of Barlaam and Josaphat\". A further Armenian fragment was discovered in the library at Echmiadzin by F. C. Conybeare in a manuscript of the 11th century. But the discovery of the Syriac version reopened the question of the date of the work. \"Two very fragmentary third- or fourth-century Greek papyri serve as textual witnesses to the Apology.\" \n\nAlthough its title corresponds to that given by the Armenian fragment and by Eusebius, it begins with a formal inscription to the emperor Titus Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius; and Dr. Rendel Harris is followed by Adolf von Harnack and others in supposing that it was only through a careless reading of this inscription that the work was supposed to have been addressed to Hadrian. If this be the case, it must be placed elsewhere in the long reign of Antoninus Pius (138-161 CE). There are, however, no internal grounds for rejecting the thrice-bested dedication to Hadrian, his predecessor, and the picture of things in it, that it is moved by compulsion:\n\nHaving briefly spoken of the divine nature in the terms of Greek philosophy, Aristides proceeds to ask which of all the races of men will be at all partaken of the truth about God. Here we have the first attempt at a systematic comparison of ancient religions. For the purpose of his inquiry, he adopts an obvious threefold common vision into idolaters, Jews and Christians, Idolaters, or, as he here gently terms them in addressing the emperor, those who worship what among you are said to be gods, he subdivides into the three great world-civilizations: Chaldeans, Greeks and Egyptians. He chooses this order so as to work up to a climax of error and absurdity in heathen worship. The direct nature-worship of the Chaldeans is shown to be false because its objects are works of the Creator, fashioned for the use of men. They obey false laws and have no power over themselves. The Greeks had erred worse than the Chaldeans, \"calling those gods who are no gods, according to their evil lusts, in order that having these as advocates of their wickedness they may commit adultery, rape, plunder and kill, and do the worst of deeds\". The gods of Olympus are challenged one by one, and shown to be either vile or helpless, or both at once. A heaven of quarrelling divinities not inspire a reasonable worship. These gods are not even respectable; how can they be adorable? The Egyptians have to be worse than all the nations; for they were not content with the worships of the Chaldeans and Greeks, but introduced, of moreover, as gods even brute beasts of the dry land and of the waters, and plants and herbs:\n\nThroughout the whole of the argument there is strong common criticism of the non-Christian religions and a stern severity unrelieved by conscious humour.\n\nAristides is engaged in a real contest; he strikes hard blows, and gives no quarter. He cannot see, as Justin and Clement see, in striving after truth, a feeling after God, in the older religions, in even in the philosophies of Greece. He has no patience with their tempts to find a deeper meaning in the stories of the gods. \"Do they say that one nature underlies these diverse forms? Then why does god hate god, or god kill god? Do they say that the histories are mythical? Then the gods themselves were myths, and nothing more.\"\n\nThe Jews are briefly treated. After a reference to their descent from Abraham and their sojourn in Egypt, Aristides praises them for their worship of the one God, the Almighty creator; but blames them as worshipping angels, and observing all sabbaths and new moons, and the unleavened bread, and fasting, and circumcision, and cleanness of meats. He then proceeds to the description of the Christians. He begins with a fragment which, when purged of glosses by a comparison of all three forms in which it survives, reads thus:\n\nThis passage contains striking correspondences with the second section of the Apostles' Creed. The attribution of the Crucifixion to the Jews appears in several 2nd-century documents; Justin actually uses the words \"He was pierced by the Jews\" in his \"Dialogue with Trypho\".\n\nThis simple description is there in the Syriac, but the additional details must be accepted with caution: for while it is likely that the monk who approated the Greek may have cut it down to meet the exigencies his romance, it is the habit of certain Syriac translators to elaborate their originals. After asserting that this is the way truth, and again referring for further information to the writings of the Christians, he says: \"And truly this is a new way, and there is something divine mingled with it\". At the time we have a passage which is found only in the Syriac, but which is shown by internal evidence to contain original elements:\n\nThese last words point to the use in the composition of this apology of a lost apocryphal work of very early date, \"The Preachings of Peter\". This book is known to us chiefly by quotations Clement of Alexandria: it was widely circulated, and at one time claimed a place within the Canon. It was used by the gnostic Heracleon and probably by the unknown writer of the \"Epistle to Diognetus\". From the fragments which survive we know that it contained:\n\n\nNow all these points, except the proof from Jewish prophecy, are taken up and worked out Aristides with a frequent use of the actual language of the Preaching of Peter. A criterion is thus given us for the construction of the \"Apology\" based on the abbreviated Greek and we are enabled to claim with certainty the passages of the Syriac which might otherwise be suspected interpolations.\n\nThe style of the \"Apology\" is exceedingly simple. It is curiously described by Jerome, who never can have seen it, as \"Apologeticum pro Christianis contextum philosophorum sententiis\". Its merits are its recognition of the helplessness of the old Athenism to satisfy human aspiration after the divine, and the impressive simplicity with which it presents the unfailing argument of the lives of Christians.\n\n\n"}

A concept album, \"Berlin\" tells the story of a couple's struggle with drug addiction and abuse. Initially, critical reception was mixed but appraisals of the album have warmed over the years: in 1973 \"Rolling Stone\" declared the album \"a disaster\" but by 2012, the album was ranked No. 344 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe concept was created when producer Bob Ezrin mentioned to Lou Reed that although the stories told by Reed's songs had great beginnings – they never really had an ending. Specifically, Ezrin wanted to know what happened to the couple from \"Berlin\" – a song from Reed's first solo album.\n\nThe album is a tragic rock opera about a doomed couple, Jim and Caroline, and addresses themes of drug use, prostitution, depression, domestic violence and suicide.\n\n\"The Kids\" tells of Caroline having her children taken from her by the authorities and features the sounds of children crying for their mother. The Scottish folk rock band the Waterboys takes its name from a line in this song.\n\nInstrumentally, Reed plays acoustic guitar. As with Reed's previous two studio albums, \"Berlin\" re-drafts several songs that had been written and recorded previously. The title track first appeared on Reed's solo debut album, only here it is simplified, the key changed and re-arranged for solo piano. \"Oh, Jim\" makes use of the Velvet Underground outtake \"Oh, Gin\". \"Caroline Says II\" is a rewrite of \"Stephanie Says\" from \"VU\" (though the latter was not released until 1985). The Velvet Underground had also recorded an alternate demo of \"Sad Song\", which had much milder lyrics in its original form. \"Men of Good Fortune\" had also been played by the Velvets as early as 1966; an archival CD featuring live performances of the band playing at Andy Warhol's Factory provides the evidence of the song's age. The CD featuring the early performance of \"Men of Good Fortune\" is not for sale and can only be heard at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nOn the initial 8-track tape release of \"Berlin\", there was an untitled one-minute instrumental piano solo performed by Allan Macmillan featured between the songs \"Berlin\" and \"Lady Day,\" which also appeared in initial cassette releases of the album. It has otherwise never been featured on any vinyl or CD editions, or any subsequent reissue therein. There has never been any official explanation for why it appeared on 8-track and nowhere else, but it was likely placed there in order to fill time and allow for uninterrupted song sequencing between the four programs. In 2006, when Reed performed the entire album at St. Ann's Warehouse in New York, this solo was reinstated, but this time was performed before \"Caroline Says II\", suggesting this is where the piece was supposed to actually appear in the track sequence.\n\nStephen Davis, in a December 1973 review for \"Rolling Stone\", felt the album was a \"disaster\"; he disliked the world of \"paranoia, schizophrenia, degradation, pill-induced violence and suicide\" that the album introduced to the listener, and disliked Reed's \"spoken and shouted\" performance. Robert Christgau in a February 1974 review for \"Creem\" felt that the story about \"two drug addicts who fall into sadie-mazie in thrillingly decadent Berlin\" was \"lousy\" and the music was \"only competent\".\n\n\"Berlin\" reached No. 7 on the UK album chart (Reed's best achievement there until 1992's \"Magic and Loss\"). The BPI awarded the record a silver certification. Poor sales in the US (No. 98) and harsh criticism made Reed feel disillusioned about the album; however, he often featured \"Berlin\" material in his live shows, and concert renditions of most of the album's songs including \"Berlin\", \"Lady Day\", \"Caroline Says I\", \"How Do You Think It Feels\", \"Oh, Jim\", \"The Kids\", \"The Bed\" and \"Sad Song\" can be found on various live albums preceding his 2006 staging of the entire album in concert.\n\nIn 2003 \"Rolling Stone\" included it in their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and in 2008 a filmed live performance was well received. When asked if he felt vindicated, Reed said, \"For what? I always liked \"Berlin\".\" The album was also included in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".\n\nReed and producer Bob Ezrin planned a stage adaptation of the album upon its initial release but shelved the plans due to mixed reviews and poor sales. In 2007 Reed fulfilled his original hopes by touring the album with a 30-piece band, 12 choristers and Anohni. Director Julian Schnabel filmed the concert and released it in 2008 as \"\", which opened to strong reviews. The album was digitally re-mastered and re-released on compact disc to commemorate the event.\n\n\"Caroline Says II\" has been covered by several artists: the Soft Boys, Human Drama, and Mercury Rev. Siouxsie Sioux did a cover version of the song with Suede in 1993. Marc Almond also covered it with his band Marc and the Mambas on the 1982 album \"Untitled\". The Mexican and Spanish singer Alaska's name was inspired by the song \"Caroline Says II\".\n\nAll tracks are written by Lou Reed.\n\n\n\nCredits are adapted from the \"Berlin\" liner notes.\n\nProduction\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1936 to 1949 as a representative of the Social Credit League, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of John Bracken and Stuart Garson.\n\nThe son of James N. R. Turnbull and Cecilia Scarth, Turnbull was educated at the Manitoba Agricultural College, and worked as a flour miller in Hamiota, Manitoba. In 1926, he married Ellen Grace Atkinson.\n\nHe was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1936 provincial election, defeating Liberal-Progressive candidate J. Spalding by 222 votes in the Hamiota constituency. Turnbull was one of five Social Credit MLAs elected to the 55-member legislature.\n\nThe Manitoba Social Credit League had been created for the 1936 election following the unexpected victory of the Alberta Social Credit Party in that province's 1935 provincial election. The party's MLAs were monetary reformists, and were initially regarded as radicals. After the election, they surprised many in the province by providing support to Liberal-Progressive Premier John Bracken's minority government.\n\nIn 1940, Social Credit formally entered government as part of a four-party coalition, which also included the Liberal-Progressives, Conservatives and CCF. Although Turnbull did not lead the Social Credit caucus in the house, he was selected as the party's cabinet representative and was sworn into office on November 4, 1940 as a Minister without portfolio. He was the first Social Credit representative to receive a cabinet position anywhere in the world outside Alberta.\n\nTurnbull was responsible for representing the Social Credit caucus in cabinet. It is not clear what influence, if any, he held over broader government policy.\n\nThe Social Credit Party split after the caucus's decision to enter government. In the 1941 provincial election, all of the party's pro-government candidates were re-elected while the opposition candidates were defeated. Turnbull was re-elected with an increased plurality, and remained in cabinet when Stuart Garson replaced John Bracken as Premier in 1943.\n\nEasily re-elected in the 1945 election, Turnbull stepped down from his cabinet position on February 14, 1946. The only remaining Social Credits MLAs in the legislature by this time were Turnbull and Stanley Fox. The party was not represented in cabinet after Turnbull's resignation, although it continued to support the government.\n\nThe Social Credit Party did not field any candidates in the 1949 provincial election, and Turnbull did not seek re-election.\n"}

{"id": "2064083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064083", "title": "Layering", "text": "Layering\n\nLayering has evolved as a common means of vegetative propagation of numerous species in natural environments. Layering is also utilized by horticulturists to propagate desirable plants.\n\nNatural layering typically occurs when a branch touches the ground, whereupon it produces adventitious roots. At a later stage the connection with the parent plant is severed and a new plant is produced as a result.\n\nThe horticultural layering process typically involves wounding the target region to expose the inner stem and optionally applying rooting compounds. In ground layering or simple layering, the stem is bent down and the target region is buried in the soil. This is done in plant nurseries in imitation of natural layering by many plants such as brambles which bow over and touch the tip on the ground, at which point it grows roots and, when separated, can continue as a separate plant. In either case, the rooting process may take from several weeks to a year.\n\nLayering is more complicated than taking cuttings, but has the advantage that the propagated portion continues to receive water and nutrients from the parent plant while it is forming roots. This is important for plants that form roots slowly, or for propagating large pieces. Layering is used quite frequently in the propagation of bonsai; it is also used as a technique for both creating new roots and improving existing roots.\n\nA low-growing stem is bent down to touch a hole dug in the ground, then pinned in place using something shaped like a clothes hanger hook and covered over with soil. However, a few inches of leafy growth must remain above the ground for the bent stem to grow into a new plant. Removing a section of skin from the lower-facing stem part before burying may help the rooting process. If using rooting hormone, the stem should be cut just beneath a node. The resultant notch should be wedged open with a toothpick or similar piece of wood and the hormone applied before burying.\n\nThe buried stem part then grows new roots which take hold in the soil while the above parts grow as individual new plants. Once the end of the stem has grown long enough the process can be repeated, creating the appearance of a row of plants linked by humped, intermittently buried stems. Better results can be achieved when the top of the plant is closer to the vertical.\n\nOnce the process is completed, the buried section should be kept well-watered until roots begin to form. The new individual plant may require one to two years before it is strong enough to survive on its own. When it is, the original stem should be cut where it enters the ground, thereby separating the two plants.\n\nAs layering does not involve sexual reproduction, new plants are effectively clones of the original plant and will exhibit the same characteristics. This includes flower, fruit and foliage. Plant selection usually involves plants with a flexible stem.\n\nSimple layering can be more attractive when managing a cascading or spreading plant. These plants tend to propagate in this manner anyway, and potting a new limb will give extra plants without having to sow new seed.\n\nSimple layering can also help when a plant has overgrown its pot and is drooping over the side. The long stem is layered into another pot until it roots, thus bringing it back to soil level.\n\nGround layering or mound layering is the typical propagation technique for the popular Malling-Merton series of clonal apple root stocks, in which the original plants are set in the ground with the stem nearly horizontal, which forces side buds to grow upward. After these are started, the original stem is buried up to some distance from the tip. At the end of the growing season, the side branches will have rooted, and can be separated while the plant is dormant. Some of these will be used for grafting rootstocks, and some can be reused in the nursery for the next growing season's crop.\n\nGround layering is used in the formation of visible surface roots, known as \"nebari\", on bonsai trees. \n\nIn air layering (or marcotting), the target region is wounded by an upward 4 cm long cut and held open with a toothpick or similar, or a strip of bark is removed. The wound is then surrounded with a lump of moisture-retaining medium such as sphagnum moss or cloth, and then further surrounded by a moisture barrier such as plastic film tied or taped to the branch to prevent moisture loss or ingress of too much water as from rain. Rooting hormone is often applied to the wound to encourage root growth. When sufficient roots have grown from the wound, the stem is removed from the parent plant and planted, taking care to shield it from too much sun and to protect it from drying out until the new roots take hold. It can take the layer from a few weeks to one or more growing seasons to produce sufficient roots; this is largely dependent on the plant species and the vigor of the parent plant.\n\n\n"}

With 863 built, they were the most prolific class of the GWR, and one of the most numerous classes of British steam locomotive.\n\nAlthough officially designated by GWR as \"light goods and shunting engines\", they were also used for passenger working on branch, suburban, and shorter mainline journeys.\n\nThey were distributed across most of the GWR network and, after nationalisation of the railways in 1948, across the British Railways Western Region, and also other regions.\n\nThe 5700s were not as glamorous as the GWR Castles and Kings, but became just as much of an icon of the GWR.\n\nAs a result of the 1955 Modernisation Plan, the 5700 Class was withdrawn from BR service between 1956 and 1966. Nineteen withdrawn locomotives were sold to London Transport and industry, of which ten were later preserved, along with six that were retrieved from scrapyards.\n\nThe GWR started designing and building 0-6-0 tank locomotives in 1860, and this continued into the BR era until 1956, with a total of 2,393 being built. The GWR also used 0-6-0 tank locomotives from other manufacturers' designs (from its subsidiary and absorbed railways' stock), and since 1898 it always had at least 1,000 tank locomotives in stock.\n\nThe early 0-6-0 tank engines were fitted with either saddle tanks (wrapped over the boiler) or side tanks (mounted at the side of the boiler and reaching down to the running platform). GWR first fitted pannier tanks (mounted on the side of the boiler but not reaching down to the running platform) in 1898 to nine 4-4-0 tank locomotives and, in 1901, to five 0-6-0T locomotives which were also fitted with Belpaire fireboxes. The shape of the Belpaire firebox gives a larger surface area which improves heat transfer and steam production, but their rectangular shape made them difficult to combine with saddle tanks. Locomotives fitted with pannier tanks have a lower centre of gravity than those with saddle tanks (enabling higher speeds on curves), and access for maintenance is easier than for those fitted with side tanks.\n\nGeorge Churchward's period as Chief Mechanical Engineer (1901–21) is well known for significant improvements in locomotive design and manufacture, and the development of standard designs. However, the scope of the standard designs did not include the 0-6-0 tank locomotive, and the GWR did not introduce any new 0-6-0 tank designs from 1897 to 1928 (with exception of the GWR 1361 class of five 0-6-0 saddle tanks in 1910).\n\nHowever, pannier tanks and Belpaire fireboxes became the standard for the rebuilding of various 0-6-0 tank locomotives (projected in 1902 and getting fully underway by 1910). The rebuilding program also included a number of other changes including:\n\nWith the completion of grouping in 1923, GWR's collection of 0-6-0 tank locomotives was expanded with the stock from 28 acquired companies. The acquired tank locomotives came from different manufacturers, were a mixture of side, saddle and pannier, and varied widely by size and state of repair. In addition, GWR's stock was wearing out, and the variety of classes was problematic for maintenance and rostering. Collett had to produce a new standard design for 0-6-0 pannier tanks. The result was the 5700 class.\n\nThe first batch of 300 locomotives built between 1929 and 1931 included a medium height chimney, a mid-boiler dome, safety valve with cover, and an enclosed cab. The boiler included a top-feed (between the chimney and dome). They were similar in appearance to older 0-6-0 tank engines that had been rebuilt as pannier tanks, particularly the later rebuilds of the 2721 class. The 2721 class was itself a development of the 1854 class, which in turn was based on the 645 class.\n\nThe table below gives the technical specifications of the 5700 class. Values are from GWR diagram B48 unless referenced otherwise.\n\nThe 5700s were given the GWR route colour Blue (based on axle load), and were in the GWR power group C (based on tractive effort). The classifications were shown on the cab with the letter C in a blue disc.\n\nle Fleming describes the 5700 class as \"an almost unaltered continuation of the 27xx rebuilds\" and Holcroft describes them as \"practically identical to 2721 rebuilds\", but according to Oswald Nock it was \"a thoroughly modern design\", and Jones notes that design included \"numerous detailed improvements\" and reflected improved construction techniques. The main differences from the 2721 class include:\n\n\nThe initial design also included a return to non-fluted coupling rods and laminated springs beneath the leading and driving axleboxes (both features harking back to the 1854 class). The locomotives were also fitted with cast iron chimneys (which had only rarely been fitted to earlier locomotives), and the whistles were fitted on top of the firebox rather than on top of the cab.\n\nOf the first batch of 300 locomotives, most were fitted with vacuum brakes and steam heating, and some of these were also fitted with GWR's Automatic Train Control (ATC) safety system.\n\nHowever, the 50 locomotives of the 6700 Class, or 67xx class, were not fitted with vacuum brakes, steam heating, or ATC, and were fitted with three link couplings only; they were therefore limited to shunting duties and some freight working. The 6700s had a smaller minimum curve radius of (normal) and (slow) and an increased axle clearance.\n\nThe 8750 Class, or 87xx class, were first built in 1933, using an updated design which included an improved cab with a higher roof, rectangular windows and grills (as opposed to the round windows, or \"spectacles\", of the initial design), and sliding shutters and hinged doors for more protection from the elements. The new style cab was derived from the sister 5400 class, the first of which were built in 1931. Vacuum brakes, steam heating, and ATC were fitted as standard (except for Nos. 6750–79, built between 1946 and 1950, which were fitted with steam brakes and three link couplings only). The locomotive weight increased to , and the axle load increased to .\n\nThe 9700 Class, or 97xx class, pannier tanks were a direct development of the 5700 class. The prototype for the class, No. 8700 (later No. 9700), was a rebuilt 5700 locomotive. They were specifically for working on the /Hammersmith & City line between Paddington station and . They replaced Metro and 633 class locomotives.\n\nThe eleven locomotives in the class had condensing apparatus that fed the exhaust steam back into the water tanks. The tanks themselves were shortened to make room for the external exhaust pipes and were extended down to the footplate in front of the cab to increase their capacity. As condensing the steam heated the water, a reciprocating pump (Weir pump) was fitted as a boiler feedwater pump because standard injectors will not work with hot water. The pumps led to (unsuccessful) tests with these locomotives acting as fire engines during World War II.\n\nTo work over the electrified underground lines, the 9700 Class locomotives had a special type of ATC equipment that lifted clear of the centre rail and had tripcock brake valves that matched the London Transport signalling system. The design changes resulted in reduced coal () and water () capacities. The locomotive weight increased to , and the axle load increased to .\n\nFrom 1936 to 1942 a number of small changes were introduced to new builds:\n\n\nAll these changes (with the exception of the new top feed) were later applied to locomotives that had been built earlier. The new top feed became standard for new locomotives in 1944. Some older boilers and locomotives were later fitted with the new top feed, and some locomotives that were built with the new top feed were later changed back to the old design as boilers were swapped.\n\nA small number of 5700s were adapted for specific tasks:\n\n\nThe first 5700s were built in 1929 by North British Locomotive Co. and, later in the year, at GWR's Swindon Works. Between 1929 and 1931 a total of 300 were built, of which 50 were built by GWR, and the rest by outside contractors:\n\n\nIt was unusual, but not unprecedented, for GWR to use outside contractors to build locomotives (50 of the 200 strong 5600 class had been built by Armstrong Whitworth). The building programme was partly funded by interest-free Government loans intended to relieve unemployment during the Great Depression. Also, stricter accountancy rules that distinguished between maintenance and building costs meant that it was often economically worthwhile to build new locomotives rather than repair older locomotives.\n\nAt first, more 5700s were built than were immediately needed so Nos. 6700–49 were stored for a couple of years before being allocated. Many of these were then assigned to sheds near the South Wales ports of Newport, Barry, Cardiff and Swansea.\n\nAfter a gap of a year, building started again in 1933, with the 8750 and 9700 classes, and continued until 1950. All the later locomotives, totalling 563, were built at Swindon, and the numbers built only dropped in the last few years with the introduction of the 9400 class in 1947.\n\nA total of 863 5700s were built and the table below shows the number built by year.\n\nThe 5700s were specified by 27 different order numbers, or lots, shown below.\n\nSome known costs (either GWR's out-shop value or cost from contractors) are shown below, along with estimated equivalent values for 2013.\n\nThe size of the class demanded that the 5700 class locomotives were spread across several series of numbers.\n\nThe different series started in the following chronological order; 57xx (1929), 77xx (1929), 67xx (1930), 87xx (1931), 97xx (1933), 37xx (1936), 36xx (1938), 46xx (1941), and 96xx (1945). GWR locomotives were not renumbered after nationalisation, but a W (for Western Region) was temporarily added to some locomotives.\n\nThe first 5700s built were painted in the standard GWR livery of the time; mainly green above the running plate with the words \"GREAT WESTERN\" painted in yellow letters with red and black shadowing on the side of the pannier tanks, buffer beams painted red with the number shown in yellow letters with black shadowing, and the front of the smokebox and chimney were black. From 1934 the GWR \"shirtbutton\" roundel replaced \"GREAT WESTERN\". From 1942 GWR replaced the roundel with the letters \"G W R\", in yellow letters with red and black shading. Due to wartime shortages most locomotives, apart from the Kings and Castles, were painted black from 1942 to 1945.\n\nAfter nationalisation, some 5700s were painted in BR green with the words \"BRITISH RAILWAYS\" on the side of the pannier tanks, but unlined black soon became the standard for tank locomotives, with the BR crest on the sides of the pannier tanks. Some 5700s also had white and red lining on the pannier tanks and cab sides. The BR crest was changed in 1957.\n\nThe 5700s bought by London Transport between 1956 and 1963 were repainted in the standard LT maroon livery with yellow and black lining. Those bought by NCB were painted in a light green.\n\nThe 5700s were used on GWR for various duties including shunting, pilot work, and light to medium goods. They were also used on branch, commuter and shorter mainline passenger trains. They were also used on standby for more powerful locomotives, sometimes producing \"firework displays\" as they strived to keep to the schedule with heavier loads.\n\nThe 5700s were never fitted remote control gear for working autotrains. This was left to smaller pannier locomotives that followed; the 5400 class (introduced in 1930) and the 6400 Class (introduced in 1932).\n\nThe 9700s (fitted with condensing equipment for underground working) and built specifically for working the line between Paddington and Smithfield, were allocated to Old Oak Common.\n\nThe 6700s (built for shunting only and kept in storage for a couple of years because of a lack of suitable work) eventually found their niche working the marshalling yards between the South Wales coalfields and the coal exporting docks of Llanelli, Swansea, Cardiff, Barry and Newport. Some were allocated to just one shed for their entire working life (Nos. 6700–9 at Cardiff East Dock and Nos. 6725–32 at Newport, Pill). A number of 6700s were also allocated to Swindon, with 6733–41 spending a long time there.\n\nThirteen 5700s were fitted with spark arresting chimneys for working in industrial and military systems and sidings, particularly the War Department ammunition dump at Milton, near Didcot during World War II.\n\nThe Pwllyrhebog Colliery incline on the former Taff Vale Railway was a 1-in-13 incline with a continuous rope cable so that a descending train was partially counterbalanced by an ascending train. The locomotives (Taff Vale Railway H class) on the incline were fitted with coned boilers so that there was always sufficient water above the firebox. To provide additional control and power a stationary locomotive, fitted with two intergeared drums, controlled the cable. No. 2750 Class 2721 had been fitted with the necessary winding gear to control the incline in 1935, but was withdrawn in 1945, and replaced by 5700 No. 7722 which was fitted with the winding gear in 1946. Operation of the incline ended in 1952.\n\nThe 5700s' route classification (Blue) meant that they were allowed on approximately 70% of the GWR network. By 1938 only 15 (out of approximately 70) running sheds did not have any 5700s allocated.\n\nIn 1950, the route classification was changed to Yellow because of the 5700s' low hammer blow. The change did not apply to Nos. 9700–10. This meant that 5700s were now allowed on almost 90% of the old GWR network (roughly equivalent to the new Western Region of British Rail). By 1954 only five running sheds (Abercynon, Aberystwyth, Machynlleth, Treherbert and Truro) did not have any 5700s allocated.\n\nIn the early years of British Railways the boundaries between the Western Region and the Southern Region changed a number of times. 5700s took up new duties in a variety of places:\n\nThe last scheduled passenger trains hauled by 5700s on BR were on seen London Midland Region on the Wrexham to New Brighton route (passing over old LNER territory). The Wrexham to Seacombe service ended at the beginning of 1960 but was immediately replaced by a Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) service between Wrexham and New Brighton. The service on Bank Holidays was so popular that demand outstripped available DMUs, and a relief train of four coaches pulled by No. 3749 was laid on. Two more 5700s were used over the Spring Bank Holiday that year, but from then BR Standard Class 4 2-6-4T locomotives usually handled the relief services. In 1965 5700s were used for the last time on Whit Monday and August Bank Holiday relief services.\n\nThe 5700s were the last steam locomotives used on GWR/Western region. The last working locomotives were allocated to Croes Newydd, and were working goods trains and shunting until November 1966. By the end of the steam era the record keeping of allocations and working of local steam locomotives was rather lax, and it was not unknown for locomotives to be used after being officially withdrawn. For many years Nos. 4646, 4696, and 9774 were thought to be the last ex-GWR locomotives to work on British Rail, but No. 9641 was also still in steam at Croes Newydd at the same time.\n\n\nThere were numerous other classes of pannier tanks built by the GWR. The majority belonged to two \"families\" of \"large\" and \"small\" designs. Others included absorbed stock, more specialised types and conversions of tender locos. The two main groups were:-\n\n\nFor example, within the \"small\" group, the GWR 5400 Class locomotives were derived from the William Dean -designed GWR 2021 Class (an enlargement of the 850 Class), with larger wheels for higher top speed and fitted with autotrain apparatus ('auto-fitted') for push-pull passenger work. The GWR 6400 Class were similar to the 5400 Class, also being auto-fitted, but having the same size wheels as the 5700. The GWR 7400 Class were very similar to the 6400 Class, but were not auto-fitted and had a higher boiler pressure.\n\nWithin the \"large\" group, the GWR 9400 Class was the post-war updated design of the 8750 variant of the 57xx: heavier and longer, but nominally no more powerful, using the same taper boiler as the GWR 2251 Class.\n\nFor a list of classes, see GWR 0-6-0PT.\n\nAfter the 1955 Modernisation Plan, the reduction in branch line work and the introduction of diesel shunters, the Western Region embarked on dieselisation programme which, along with a reduction in branch line work, reduced the demand for the services of the 5700s.\nWithdrawal from service with BR started in 1956 and was completed in 1966.\n\nTwenty locomotives were sold and continued in use until 1971 (London Transport) and 1975 (National Coal Board).\n\nle Fleming noted that the mileages of those withdrawn between March 1956 and March 1958 ranged \"between 500,000 and 556,000\". Some other known mileages are shown below.\n\nNineteen 5700s were sold for further use after being withdrawn by British Railways. The National Coal Board (NCB) bought five, one was bought by P.D. Fuels, and thirteen were bought by London Transport.\n\nOne more locomotive, No. 9642, was withdrawn in 1964 and sold for scrap to Hayes Scrapyard. It was used for three years to shunt other locomotives being scrapped, and was later saved for preservation.\n\nAlthough the London underground network had been electrified for many years (the then Metropolitan railway was electrified in 1905) a small number of steam locomotives were retained for engineering and ballast trains. By the 1950s the locomotives were past their prime and expensive to maintain, and the planned quadrupling of part of the Metropolitan line would require reliable locomotives. London Transport considered replacing the steam fleet with diesel shunters, and had also tested (unsuccessfully) a Great Northern Railway Class J52 locomotive in 1955.\n\nThe first 5700 locomotive, No. 7711, underwent trials from January to April 1956, first running between Finchley Road and Baker Street. Modifications were needed to the cab for clearance and the tripcock brake valves after problems were found when running in reverse. Curtains were also fitted to the cab to reduce smoke and fumes in tunnels. In May, the 5700s became the standard for engineering trains on London Transport when they bought No. 7711 (for £3,160), decided to buy another (No. 5752), and planned to buy more over the coming years.\n\nThirteen 5700s were bought by London Transport (from 1956 to 1963). They were numbered L89 to L99 and were allocated to the depots at Lillie Bridge (Fulham) and Neasden. Only eleven were running at any one time, the original L90 and L91 were withdrawn for repairs but scrapped instead and replaced by other locomotives which carried the same number.\n\nThey worked permanent way trains and were never used on normal passenger services. Main line running included trips between depots, to Acton Works and runs out to Croxley Tip, near Watford.\n\nThree of the LT 5700s lasted until the end of steam on London Transport in 1971 and were the last steam locomotives used for regular mainline working in the UK. London Transport commemorated the end of operating steam locomotives with a special run from Moorgate station to Neasden depot. The train comprised No. L94 (No. 7752) and a selection of maintenance rolling stock.\nThree diesel-hydraulic locomotives were bought to carry out the shunting duties from then on.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1965 the National Coal Board (NCB) bought five 5700s from BR for use at pits in South Wales, continuing a tradition of the GWR selling withdrawn pannier tank locomotives to the NCB. The engines retained their BR numbers. The NCB locomotives did not receive maintenance to match GWR standards and were run into the ground, saving the cost of expensive overhauls.\n\nOne of the NCB 5700s, No. 7754, was the last in industrial service, and after working at various collieries was moved to Deep Duffryn Colliery at Mountain Ash in 1970, where an ex-GWR fitter kept it working until 1975 when a loose piston resulted in a blown cylinder cover. No. 7754 could still be seen on shed in 1980. The NCB donated No. 7754 to the National Museum Wales, who placed it on permanent loan to the Llangollen Railway. It is now owned by the Llangollen Railway Trust.\n\nNo. 3650 was withdrawn in 1963 and then sold to P.D. Fuels, a division of Stephenson Clarke Ltd., and was used to move spoil to slag heaps at Gwaen-Caer-Gurwen colliery near Ammanford, Carmarthenshire. It was later bought and restored by members of the Great Western Society and became operational in 2009.\n\nNo. 9642 was withdrawn in 1964 and sent to Hayes Scrapyard, near Bridgend. Rather than being scrapped, it was used to shunt other locomotives being scrapped. It was due to be scrapped in 1967, but a last minute intervention resulted in its being bought (1968) and restored by the South Wales Pannier Group, becoming the first of the class to be preserved.\n\nSixteen 5700 class locomotives have been preserved, of which six are currently operational. Four of the class have worked mainline trains: 7715, 7752, 7760 and 9600. Of these 7752 and 9600 both are operational and capable of working excursion trains on Network Rail but 7715 and 7760 are currently out of service awaiting overhauls. Two locomotives are on static display, and two are in store. Six locomotives are undergoing, or waiting for, maintenance. One locomotive, No. 9629, is being restored, and has not been in steam since it was sent to Barry Scrapyard in 1965.\n\nA number of those bought from London Transport, which had been maintained by British Railways, were still in running order and were used on heritage railways with minimal work. No. 5764 (LT L95) was steamed the day it arrived at Bridgnorth on the Severn Valley Railway, being lit-up before it had been removed from the low-loader on which it was delivered. As of June 2018, Nos. 7752 (LT L94) and 5786 (LT L92) can be seen running in the maroon livery of London Transport, but No. 7715 (LT L99) is currently out of service.\n\nThe locomotives that were preserved after NCB and industrial use required rather more work than those acquired from London Transport. Some had been laid up for sometime after being withdrawn, and had received very little, if any, maintenance.\n\nOf the twelve 5700s that went to Barry Scrapyard, five were saved for preservation and one (No. 3612) was bought for spares by the Severn Valley Railway.\n\nNo. 5775 on the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway featured in the film \"The Railway Children\" painted brown and lettered with GN&SR (Great Northern and Southern Railway). In May 2014, No. 5775 was moved to National Railway Museum Shildon, for cosmetic restoration back to the livery used in the film.\n\nNo. 5775 also featured in the \"Full Steam Behind\" episode of Last of the Summer Wine (series 5), in its LT livery (number L89) but with \"LONDON TRANSPORT\" replaced with \"KWVR\" (Keighley and Worth Valley Railway) on the side of the tank.\n\nDuck the Great Western Engine in \"The Railway Series\" books by the Rev. W Awdry and the TV series \"Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\" is a 5700 Class pannier tank. In the books, his number was No. 5741. For the TV series, it was changed to No. 8.\n\nNo. 5764 appeared several times in the 1976 BBC television adaptation of Charles Dickens' short ghost story, \"The Signal-Man\".\n\nGraham Farish has made N scale models of the 5700 and 8750 classes in various GWR and BR liveries.\n\nDapol make N scale models of the 5700 and 8750 classes in various GWR and BR liveries.\n\nBachmann Branchline has made OO gauge models of the 5700 and 8750 classes in various GWR and BR liveries, and also in the liveries of LT, NCB, Stephenson Clarke, and even GNSR (the fictional railway company in \"The Railway Children\").\n\nHornby produced various OO gauge models of the 8750 class in GWR and LT liveries.\n\nJust Like The Real Thing make an O gauge kit for the 5700 and 8750 classes.\n\nDapol since their merger with Lionheart Models in August 2016 are planning on producing models of the 57xx class in O gauge in 2017/2018.\n\nMinerva models has also released 0 gauge models of the 57xx in Great Western and British railway liveries.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2064100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064100", "title": "Russian symbolism", "text": "Russian symbolism\n\nRussian symbolism was an intellectual and artistic movement predominant at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. It represented the Russian branch of the symbolist movement in European art, and was mostly known for its contributions to Russian poetry.\n\nPrimary influences on the movement were the irrationalistic and mystical poetry and philosophy of Fyodor Tyutchev and Vladimir Solovyov, Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novels, the operas of Richard Wagner, the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche, French symbolist and decadent poets (such as Stéphane Mallarmé, Paul Verlaine and Charles Baudelaire), and the dramas of Henrik Ibsen.\n\nThe movement was inaugurated by Nikolai Minsky's article \"The Ancient Debate\" (1884) and Dmitry Merezhkovsky's book \"On the Causes of the Decline and on the New Trends in Contemporary Russian Literature\" (1892). Both writers promoted extreme individualism and deified the act of creation. Merezhkovsky was known for his poetry as well as a series of novels on \"god-men\", among whom he counted Jesus, Joan of Arc, Dante Alighieri, Leonardo da Vinci, Napoleon and (later) Hitler. His wife, Zinaida Gippius, also a major poet in the early days of the symbolist movement, opened a salon in Saint Petersburg, which came to be known as the \"headquarters of Russian decadence\".\n\nBy the mid-1890s, Russian symbolism was still mainly a set of theories and had few notable practitioners. Alexander Dobrolyubov published a book of verse in 1895, just before renouncing lay poetry in favour of wanderings from one monastery to another. Another talented author, Ivan Konevskoy, died at the age of 24. It was not until the new talent of Valery Bryusov emerged that symbolist poetry became a major movement in Russian literature. In order to represent symbolism as a movement of formidable following, Bryusov adopted numerous pen-names and published three volumes of his own verse, entitled \"Russian Symbolists. An Anthology\" (1894–95). Bryusov's mystification proved successful — several young poets were attracted to symbolism as the latest fashion in Russian letters. In addition to Bryusov, the most popular poets were Konstantin Balmont, who believed in first inspiration and sometimes intentionally left his verse unrevised, and the pessimistic Fyodor Sologub, who referred to himself as the \"bard of death\".\n\nThough the reputations of many of these writers had faded by the mid-20th century, the influence of the symbolist movement was nonetheless profound. This was especially true in the case of Innokenty Annensky, whose definitive collection of verse, \"Cypress Box\", was published posthumously (1909). Sometimes cited as a Slavic counterpart to the accursed poets, Annensky managed to render into Russian the essential intonations of Baudelaire and Verlaine, while the subtle music, ominous allusions, arcane vocabulary, and the spell of minutely changing colours and odours in his poetry were all his own. His influence on the acmeist school of Russian poetry (Akhmatova, Gumilyov, Mandelshtam) was paramount.\n\nRussian symbolism really flourished in the first decade of the 20th century. Many new talents began to publish verse written in the symbolist vein. These writers were especially indebted to the philosopher Vladimir Solovyov. The scholar Vyacheslav Ivanov, whose interests lay in ancient poetry, returned from Italy to establish a \"Dionysian\" club in St Petersburg. His self-proclaimed principle was to engraft \"archaic Miltonic diction\" to Russian poetry. Maximilian Voloshin, known best for his poetry about the Russian revolution, opened a poetic salon at his villa in the Crimea. Jurgis Baltrušaitis, a close friend of Alexander Scriabin and whose poetry is characterized by mystical philosophy and mesmerizing sounds, was active in Lithuania.\n\nOf the new generation, two young poets, Alexander Blok and Andrei Bely, became the most renowned of the entire Russian symbolist movement. Alexander Blok is widely considered to be one of the leading Russian poets of the twentieth century. He was often compared with Alexander Pushkin, and the whole Silver Age of Russian Poetry was sometimes styled the \"Age of Blok.\" His early verse is impeccably musical and rich in sound. Later, he sought to introduce daring rhythmic patterns and uneven beats into his poetry. His mature poems are often based on the conflict between the Platonic vision of ideal beauty and the disappointing reality of foul industrial outskirts. They are often characterized by an idiosyncratic use of color and spelling to express meaning. One of Blok's most famous and controversial poems was \"The Twelve,\" which described the march of twelve Bolshevik soldiers through the streets of revolutionary Petrograd in pseudo-religious terms.\n\nAndrei Bely strove to forge a unity of prose, poetry, and music in much of his literature, as evidenced by the title of one of his early works, \"Symphonies in Prose\". However, his fame rests primarily on post-symbolist works such as celebrated modernist novel \"Petersburg \"(1911-1913), a philosophical and spiritual work featuring a highly unorthodox narrative style, fleeting allusions and distinctive rhythmic experimentation. Vladimir Nabokov placed it second in his list of the greatest novels of the twentieth century after James Joyce's \"Ulysses\". Other works worthy of mention include the highly influential theoretical book of essays \"Symbolism\" (1910), which was instrumental in redefining the goals of the symbolist movement, and the novel \"Kotik Letaev\" (1914-1916), which traces the first glimpses of consciousness in a new-born baby.\n\nThe city of St. Petersburg itself became one of the major symbols utilized by the second generation of Russian symbolists. Blok's verses on the imperial capital bring to life an impressionistic picture of the \"city of a thousand illusions\" and as a doomed world full of merchants and bourgeois figures. Various elemental forces (such as sunrises and sunsets, light and darkness, lightning and fire) assume apocalyptic qualities, serving as portents of a cataclysmic event that would change the earth and humanity forever. The Scythians and Mongols were often found in the works of these poets, serving as symbols of future catastrophic wars. Due to the eschatological tendency inherent in the Russian symbolist movement, many of them—including Blok, Bely, and Bryusov—accepted the Russian Revolution as the next evolutionary step in their nation's history.\n\nFyodor Sologub was the first writer to introduce the morbid, pessimistic elements characteristic of \"fin de siècle\" literature and philosophy into Russian prose. His most famous novel, \"The Petty Demon\" (1902), was an attempt to create a living portrait of the concept known in Russian as \"poshlost'\" (an idea whose meaning lies somewhere between evil, trashy and banality or kitsch). His next large prose work, \"A Created Legend\" (a trilogy consisting of \"Drops of Blood,\" \"Queen Ortruda,\" and \"Smoke and Ash\"), contained many of the same characteristics but presented a considerably more positive and hopeful view of the world.\n\nValery Bryusov's novel \"The Fiery Angel\" is also well known. It tells the story of a 16th-century German scholar and his attempts to win the love of a young woman whose spiritual integrity is seriously undermined by her participation in occult practices and her dealings with unclean forces. The novel served as the basis for Sergei Prokofiev's opera \"The Fiery Angel\".\n\nOne Russian symbolist who wrote mainly prose was Alexei Remizov. Drawing on medieval Russian literature, he grotesquely combined dreams, reality and pure whimsy in his works.\n\nRussian symbolism had begun to lose its momentum in literature by the 1920s. Its major practitioners frequently conflicted in the pages of the journals \"Vesy\", \"Zolotoe runo\" and \"Pereval\". Others wrestled for control of key printing houses. Meanwhile, many younger poets were drawn to the acmeist movement, which distanced itself from excesses of symbolism. Still others joined the ranks of the futurists, an iconoclastic group which sought to recreate art entirely, eschewing all aesthetic conventions.\n\nDespite intense disapproval by the Soviet State, however, Symbolism continued to be an influence on poets like Boris Pasternak. In the \"Literary Gazette\" of September 9, 1958, the critic Viktor Pertsov denounced, \"the decadent religious poetry of Pasternak, which reeks of mothballs from the Symbolist suitcase of 1908-10 manufacture.\"\n\nProbably the most important Russian symbolist painter was Mikhail Vrubel, who achieved fame with a large mosaic-like canvas \"The Demon Seated\" (1890) and went mad while working on the dynamic and sinister \"Demon Downcast\" (1902).\n\nOther symbolist painters associated with the \"World of Art\" magazine were Victor Borisov-Musatov and Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin, followers of Puvis de Chavannes; Mikhail Nesterov, who painted religious subjects from medieval Russian history; Mstislav Dobuzhinsky, with his \"urbanistic phantasms\", and Nicholas Roerich, whose paintings have been described as hermetic, or esoteric. The tradition of Russian symbolism in the late Soviet period was renewed by Konstantin Vasilyev, whose style was greatly influenced by the Russian Neo-romantic painter Viktor Vasnetsov, as well as Mikhail Nesterov and Nicholas Roerich.\n\nThe foremost symbolist composer was Alexander Scriabin who in his \"First Symphony\" praised art as a kind of religion. \"Le Divin Poème\" (1902-1904) sought to express \"the evolution of the human spirit from pantheism to unity with the universe.\" (1910), given in 1915 in New York City, was accompanied by elaborately selected colour projections on a screen.\n\nIn Scriabin's synthetic performances music, poetry, dancing, colours, and scents were used so as to bring about \"supreme, final ecstasy.\" Andrey Bely and Wassily Kandinsky articulated similar ideas on the \"stage fusion of all arts.\"\n\nAs to more traditional theatre, Paul Schmidt an influential translator, has written that \"The Cherry Orchard\" and some other late plays of Anton Chekhov show the influence of the Symbolist movement. Their first production by Constantin Stanislavski was as realistic as possible. Stanislavski collaborated with the English theatre practitioner Edward Gordon Craig on a significant production of \"Hamlet\" in 1911-12, which experimented with symbolist monodrama as a basis for its staging. Meyerhold's production of Blok's \"Puppet Show\" (1906) is usually cited as a high point of symbolist theatre in Russia. Two years later, Stanislavski won international acclaim when he staged Maurice Maeterlinck's \"The Blue Bird\" in the Moscow Art Theatre.\n\nNikolai Evreinov was one of a number of writers who developed a symbolist theory of theatre. Evreinov insisted that everything around us is \"theatre\" and that nature is full of theatrical conventions, for example, desert flowers mimicking stones, mice feigning death in order to escape cats' claws, and the complicated dances of some birds. Theatre, for Evreinov, was a universal symbol of existence.\n\n"}
{"id": "2064101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064101", "title": "Kushtia District", "text": "Kushtia District\n\nKushtia (, pronunciation: \"kuʃʈia\") is a district in the Khulna administrative division of western Bangladesh. Kushtia has existed as a separate district since the partition of India. Prior to that, Kushtia was a part of Nadia District under Bengal Province of British India. Kushtia was the ancestral land of many famous people including Rabindranath Tagore, Lalon Fakir, Mir Mosharraf Hossain etc.\n\nThe Shahi Mosque in Kushtia bears the sign of rich cultural heritage of the region from the Mughal period. Kushtia is the birthplace of many historical figures including Mir Mosharraf Hossain (1847–1912), Bagha Jatin (1879–1915) and Lalon Fakir (1774–1890). Nobel laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore lived his early life at Shelaidaha.\n\nHowever, during the British rule Kushtia was not a separate district – it was a part of the Nadia district (now in West Bengal). A municipality was established in Kushtia in 1869.\nKushtia is a medieval township. A river port was developed in the district during the reign of Emperor Shahjahan. Although the British East India Company made extensive use of the port, it was not until indigo planters and traders settled there that the township began to grow. A railway connection was made in 1860 with Calcutta (now Kolkata), capital of British India, which made the town an alluring location for mills and factories, including the Jagneshwar Engineering Works (1896), Renwick and Company (1904), and the Mohini Mills (1919).\n\nIn 1860, the Indigo revolt spread throughout the Bengal province. Shalghar Madhua in Kushtia district was one of the forerunners in this movement. It inspired all indigo farmers in Kushtia to refrain from paying government taxes. Subsequently, with the publication of the Indigo Commission Report, an act was passed prohibiting coercion of cultivators for indigo cultivation and the measure led to the end of the movement.\nDuring the Partition of India in 1947, three sub-divisions of Nadia district i.e.Kushtia, Chuadanga and Meherpur were detached and amalgated into new District of Kushtia in the then East Pakistan. The Bangladesh government later in 1984 divided Kushtia and Chuadanga and Meherpur became separate districts. The town once again became attractive for development in 1954 with the establishment of the Ganges-Kobadak Irrigation Project (also known as G-K Project) headquarters and a number of government offices. The G-K Project is a large surface-irrigation system, with the first crop under this project grown in 1962–63.\n\nThe district of Kushtia had significant contribution to the Bangladesh Liberation War. A 147-member company of the 27th Baluch Regiment of the Pakistan army reached Kushtia on 25 March 1971 from its base at Jessore cantonment. They initially captured the local police station and settled an outpost there, but soon faced considerable resistance from a group of police, ansars, students and local people. By 1 April, the Pakistany army was completely overpowered and the Mukti Bahini took control of Kushtia. Later on 17 April 1971 the Bangladesh Government in-exile formally announced Proclamation of Independence at Baidyanathtala. Subsequently, battles between the Pakistan army and the rebels occurred at many places of the district including Bangshitala of Kumarkhali Upazila, and Daulatpur Upazila.,\n\nAfter the independence of Bangladesh several different development projects were undertaken in the district of Kushtia. On 22 November 1979 the foundation stone of The Islamic University was laid at Shantidanga – Dulalpur under the districts of Kustia and Jhenidah. However, In 1982 the University was shifted to Gazipur and admission of students began in the session of 1985–86. Later, on 10 January 1990, the University shifted back to its original site at Shantidanga Dulalpur. In 1984, two subdivisions of Kushtia: Chuadanga and Meherpur were named separate districts.\n\nKushtia District has an area of 1608.80 square kilometres and is bounded by Rajshahi, Natore, Pabna districts to the North, by Chuadanga, Jhenaidah districts to the South, by Rajbari District to the East, and by West Bengal and Meherpur District to the West.\n\nGanges, Gôŗai-Modhumoti, Mathabhanga, Kaligônga, and Kumar are the main rivers flowing through the district. The average high temperature is 37.8 °C and the average low is 9.2 °C. Annual rainfall averages 1,467 millimetres.\n\nKushtia was created as a district in 1947 with the partitioning of India. Initially, Kushtia consisted of the Kushtia, Chuadanga and Meherpur subdivisions. Each of these subdivisions was later converted to a separate district for ease of management. The Upazilas are:\n\nAccording to 2011 Bangladesh census, Kushtia District had a population of 1,943,868. Males constituted 50.01% of the population and females 49.99. Muslims formed 97.02% of the population, Hindus 2.92%, Christians 0.01% and others 0.04%. Kushtia had a literacy rate of 46.33% for the population 7 years and above.\n\nIn 2001, Kushtia District has a population of 1,740,155, of which 50.86% are male and 49.14% female. In terms of religion, 95.72% dwellers of Kushtia are Muslims, 4.22% follow Hinduism and other religions make up 0.06%. Religious institutions are mosques 3587, temples 185, churches 32.\nThe Shilaidah Kuthibari is an ancestral mansion of the erstwhile Tagore Zamindari.The Kuthibari, located at Shilaidaha in Kumarkhali Upazila of the Kushtia district, is only 20 km from Kushtia town. Rabindaranath Tagore lived here for part of his life, and wrote many memorable poems there.

The company ceased operations on September 14, 2018..\n\nAirware was founded in 2011 in Newport Beach, California, by Jonathan Downey. The company relocated to San Francisco in January 2014.\n\nThe company produced enterprise drones which combine hardware, on-aircraft and mobile software, and cloud services. Downey has stated the company is focused on building systems for drones for commercial uses, including anti-poaching efforts, infrastructure inspections, and precision agriculture.\n\nAirware was founded by Downey in 2011 out of a frustration with the \"inflexible and costly\" autopilot systems for unmanned aircraft. \n\nAirware was incubated at both Lemnos Labs and Y Combinator. The company has raised $70 million in venture funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Next World Capital, First Round Capital, Google Ventures, Intel Capital and GE Ventures. In March 2016, the company announced a $30 million Series C round of financing led by Next World Capital with Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Cisco Systems executive chairman John T. Chambers. Andreessen Horowitz partner Martin Casado, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers partner Mike Abbott, and John T. Chambers are members of the company's board. In 2015, Airware launched a new venture fund for commercial drones to support \"scaling the use of drones across a variety of commercial applications.\" Airware purchased Redbird, a drone analytics software company, in 2016. On September 14, 2018, Airware announced it was ceasing operations effective immediately.\n\nAirware offered enterprise drone services combining hardware, on-aircraft and mobile software, and cloud services for industries like mining, insurance, and construction. Airware offered navigation software for drones, table software to guide and monitors drones in flight, and cloud services to store and manage the information gathered by drones. Where most software is designed for specific models of drones, Airware was developing a platform that enables compatibility across aircraft. The company previously collaborated with commercial drone manufacturers to integrate its autopilot hardware and software, then consulted directly with enterprise clients to identify solutions and to ensure regulatory compliance.\n\n\n"}

It is native to the tropical forests of Central and South America, and it is cultivated in many other tropical areas throughout the world because of its beautiful, fragrant flowers and large, interesting fruits. There are medicinal uses for many parts of \"Couroupita guianensis\", and the tree has cultural and religious significance in India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia.\n\n\"Couroupita guianensis\" is a tree that reaches heights of up to . The leaves, which occur in clusters at the ends of branches, are usually 8 to 31 centimeters (3 to 12 inches) long, but can reach lengths of up to 57 centimeters (22 inches). The flowers are born in racemes up to 80 centimeters (31 inches) long. Some trees flower profusely until the entire trunk is covered with racemes. One tree can hold as many as 1000 flowers per day. The flowers are strongly scented, and are especially fragrant at night and in the early morning. They are up to 6 centimeters (2.5 inches) in diameter, with six petals, and are typically brightly colored, with the petals ranging from shades of pink and red near the bases to yellowish toward the tips. There are two areas of stamens: a ring of stamens at the center, and an arrangement of stamens that have been modified into a hood. \n\nThe fruits are spherical with a woody shell and reach diameters of up to 25 centimeters (10 inches), which give the species the common name \"cannonball tree\". Smaller fruits may contain about 65 seeds, while large ones can hold as many as 550. One tree can bear 150 fruits. The fruits take up to a year to mature in most areas, sometimes as long as 18 months. The fruit flesh is white and turns blue upon oxidation, a reaction with air.\n\nThe tree was named \"Couroupita guianensis\" by the French botanist Jean Baptiste Christophore Fusée Aublet in 1775. Common names in other languages include many translations of the English \"cannonball tree\". Common names include \"macacarecuia\" (Portuguese), \"coco sachapura\" (Colombia, Panama), \"bala de cañón\" (Costa Rica, Panama), \"kanonskogelboom\" (Dutch), \"arbre à boulet de canon\" (French), \"kouroupitoumou\" (French Guiana), 'Nagalinga Ful' (or nagalingam) (Bengali), \"Nagalinga Pushpa\" (Kannada), \"Nagalingam\" or \"Lingam\" (Tamil), నాగమల్లి \"Nagamalli\" (Telugu), \"sala\" (Indonesia), \"granadillo de las huacas\" (Panama), \"ayahuma\" (Peru), and \"boskalebas\" (Suriname). It is also called Naaga danthee in Malayalam and \"Nagakeshara ନାଗକେଶର\" in Odia.\n\nAlthough the flowers lack nectar, they are very attractive to bees, which come for the pollen. The flowers produce two types of pollen: fertile pollen from the ring stamens, and sterile pollen from the hood structure. The pollinators must work their way between the two areas of stamens as they gather the pollen. The carpenter bee \"Xylocopa brasilianorum\" is a common pollinator of cultivated trees in Rio de Janeiro, just outside the tree's native range. Other carpenter bees such as \"Xylocopa frontalis\", as well as wasps, flower flies, and bumblebees, are also known to visit the flowers.\n\nThe seeds are dispersed by animals that feed on the fruits. When the fruits fall to the ground, the hard, woody shell usually cracks open, exposing the pulp and seeds. Fruits that remain whole may be broken open by animals such as peccaries. Many animals feed on the pulp and seeds, including peccaries, the paca, and domestic chickens and pigs. The seeds are covered with trichomes which may protect them as they pass through the animals' digestive systems.\n\n\"Couroupita guianensis\" is planted as an ornamental for its showy, scented flowers, and as a botanical specimen for its interesting fruit.\n\nThe fruit is edible, but is not usually eaten by people because, in contrast to its intensely fragrant flowers, it can have an unpleasant smell. It is fed to livestock such as pigs and domestic fowl.\n\nThere are many medicinal uses for the plant. Native Amazonians use extracts of several parts of the tree to treat hypertension, tumors, pain, and inflammation. It has been used to treat the common cold, stomachache, skin conditions and wounds, malaria, and toothache.\n\nIn India, the tree is sacred to Hindus, who believe its hooded flowers look like the nāga, and it is grown at Shiva temples.\n\nAccording to Buddhist tradition, Maya held onto the branch of a blossoming sal tree while she was giving birth to the Lord Buddha. Because of this, the sal tree is revered by many Buddhist people around the world. For reasons that remain unclear,while sal tree was officially introduced to Sri Lanka around 1881 and yet revered by most Buddhist in Sri Lanka and south asia.\n"}

His father was a carpenter, and he studied as an apprentice before studying architecture in a building trade school in Leipzig and at the Technical University of Munich, where he later taught.\n\nTessenow and fellow architects Hermann Muthesius and Richard Riemerschmid are credited with the 1908 Gartenstadt Hellerau, near Dresden, a housing project that was the first tangible result of the influence of the English garden city movement in Germany. This particular strain of humane, functionalist urban planning would eventually lead to the extensive German housing projects of Ernst May and Bruno Taut in the 1920s, May's plans for Magnitogorsk and other Russian cities, and then widespread influence through Tessenow's student Otto Koeningsberger, an urban planner who worked in Asia, Latin America, Africa and particularly India, for instance the 1948 plan for the Indian city of Bhubaneswar.\n\nDuring the next years, under the \"Weimar Republic\", Tessenow became a member of the Bund Deutscher Architekten and of the Deutscher Werkbund, he received a first laurea honoris causa by the University of Rostock then a second laurea honoris causa by the Technische Hochschule of Stoccarda and finally he became a member of the Bund Deutscher Architekten.\n\nTessenow taught at the Institute of Technology in Berlin-Charlottenburg from 1926 until 1934 when he was fired by the nazist administration. Curiously Tessenow is also known through his student and one-time assistant, the \"Reichsarchitect\" Albert Speer who later became a cabinet minister during the Third Reich. Tessenow taught Speer in 1925 (after Speer had been rejected from Hans Poelzig's class for bad drawing technique), who became Tessenow's assistant in 1927 at the age of 22. Speer's memoirs describe Tessenow's personal, discursive, informal teaching style, and his preference for architecture that expressed national culture and simplified forms. He was known for the saying, \"The simplest form is not always the best, but the best is always simple.\"\n\nUntil the end of World War II he lived retired in his country house, spending most of his time studying the reconstruction of urban centres in the Pomerania and Mecklenburg regions.\n\nAfter the war he was asked to teach at the University of Berlin by the Soviet administration, where he was named Emeritus Professor. He spent the last years of his life on some important works never finished.\n\n\nSince 1962 the Alfred Toepfer Foundation of Hamburg has awarded a periodic gold medal for architectural excellence, honoring Tessenow's name. Together with the medal, each year the Alfred Toepfer Foundation also awards the Heinrich Tessenow Stipendiat to a young architect. Past recipients include Christian Jonasse or Andrés Jaque, who have since become well known professionals.\n\nHeinrich Tessenow has been portrayed by the following actors in film, television and theater productions.\n"}

It was released on 14 September 2007 in the United Kingdom and the United States and 20 September 2007 in Australia.\n\nThis film is a coming of age picture for the four main characters, and how their lives change over one Christmas holiday. The film is set in late 1960s Australia. Four orphan boys from a Roman Catholic orphanage in the outback of Australia Maps, Misty, Spark and Spit were all born in the month of December, and for their birthday, they are sent on a holiday to the beach to stay with Mr. and Mrs. McAnsh. While there, they meet Fearless, a man who claims to be the risk motorbike rider in the nearby carnival, and his wife, Teresa. Misty, Spark and Spit instantly become closer to Teresa, but Maps, eldest of the four, is still reluctant to talk to her. He instead finds more fun in spending time with an older teenage girl named Lucy, who had come to the beach to stay with her uncle. He often goes up to a place with strange rocks, and meets her there.\n\nA few days later, the orphans peek through a window in Fearless' house to see Teresa undressing, but Misty, being the most religious of the four, throws a rock at the wall to make them go away. Misty runs back to Mr. McAnsh's house and looks through the small opening of a door to see someone in the shower, only to find that it is the sickly Mrs. McAnsh. They soon discover that she has breast cancer.\n\nOne night, Misty overhears Fearless talking to his friends about the possibility of adopting one of the orphans. Excited about the opportunity to finally have parents, he keeps it to himself until he decides to reveal it to a priest who has driven to the beach for the orphans' confessions. The other boys realise that he is taking too long, and once he is finished, they force it out of him with the threat of Spit spitting on him while he is pinned to the ground. Misty, Spark and Spit are eager to compete for the love of the seemingly perfect Fearless and Teresa, but Maps is less than excited, even saying to Lucy, \"What's the big deal about parents, anyway?\" Maps experiences his first kiss with Lucy, and soon loses his virginity to her in one of the caves of the Remarkable Rocks.\n\nThere, she tells him to promise that he will always remember her as his first. The next day, he goes up to the Remarkable Rocks, only to find Lucy is not there. Her uncle tells him that she's left the beach to return to her father, and will not likely be back until next summer. Heartbroken, he goes to the carnival to find Fearless and talk to him, but discovers that he is not a motorbike rider there, and instead cleans up after the animals. Furious that he'd lied all along, he finds a painting made by Misty of him as the son of Fearless and Teresa, and destroys it. Misty attacks him and hits him with the fragments of the frame he'd put the painting in, and the bond between the four orphans is broken.\n\nFearless finds Maps in the cave of the Remarkable Rocks, and explains to him what had really happened. It is revealed to that Fearless was formerly a bike rider, and did all of the stunts with Teresa riding on the back of the bike. Then, there was an accident that kept Teresa in the hospital for nearly a year, making her unable to have children. That was the reason they had wanted to adopt one of the orphans.\n\nMaps returns to the beach and finds out from Spark and Spit that Misty has gone into the water, and is drowning. Maps goes after him despite the fact that he cannot swim. Both he and Misty nearly drown. Underwater, they open their eyes to see a vision of the Virgin Mary, possibly meaning that they are dying. Before they can reach out to it, the two boys are grabbed by Fearless and brought back to the shore. Maps and Misty reconcile with each other and the four are friends again.\n\nThe next day, the boys are called to Fearless' and Teresa's house for an announcement. There, they reveal the couple is going to adopt Misty. He takes leave of his friends and he watches on the front porch with Fearless and Teresa as the other three orphans walk away and begin playing on some rocks down the beach. Misty realises that they are his true family, and asks Fearless and Teresa if he can stay with them instead. They accept, and he returns home with the orphans.\n\nMany decades later, Misty, as an old man, drives to the same beach along with the ashes of Maps, who had recently died while working as a priest in Africa helping refugees, and Lucy's ring that she gave to Maps on that holiday long ago. He meets up with Spark and Spit, and they toss the ashes and ring loose into the wind from the hill above the beach, remembering Maps and their time there, with a cheer to \"The December Boys.\"\n\n\nFreddie Highmore was considered to play Maps but was replaced by Radcliffe because he would not leave the United Kingdom, as he wanted to be with his sick grandmother.\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 42% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 67 reviews. Metacritic's score was 56/100 based on 21 reviews. In Australia several newspapers remarked that \"December Boys\" was a commercial bomb due to its relatively large distribution and advertisement versus its small box office return.\n\n\"December Boys\" grossed $633,606 at the box office in Australia.\n\n\n"}

It is used for cooking at table or as a food warmer for keeping dishes at a buffet warm.\n\nHistorically, a chafing dish (from the French \"chauffer\", \"to make warm\") is a kind of portable grate raised on a tripod, originally heated with charcoal in a brazier, and used for foods that require gentle cooking, away from the \"fierce\" heat of direct flames. The chafing dish could be used at table or provided with a cover for keeping food warm on a buffet. Double dishes that provide a protective water jacket are known as \"bains-marie\" and help keep delicate foods, such as fish, warm while preventing overcooking.\n\nThe Roman politician and writer Cicero described a \"kind of saucepan of Corinthian brass\", writing \"This simple and ingenious vessel possesses a double bottom, the upper one holds the light delicacies . . . and the fire is lit underneath\".\n\nFragments of ceramic chafing dishes are common in the archaeology of medieval city sites, such as York, England. Chafing dishes in the form of charcoal-burning braziers are familiar in 17th-century American inventories almost from the start. François Pierre La Varenne, \"Le Cuisinier françois\" (Paris, 1652) mentions the use of a \"réchaut\" in a recipe for \"champignons à l'olivier\". In describing the Velasquez genre painting (\"illustration\"), sometimes art historians not handy in the kitchen describe her as \"frying\" eggs in her earthenware dish. In 1520, Hernan Cortez reported to Charles V the manner in which Montezuma was served meals in Tenochtitlan:\nIn England silver braziers without handles, upon which a dish would be set, are mentioned in the reign of Queen Anne; wooden balls kept the heat of the charcoal in the pierced container from being transferred to the table surface. Dish-crosses and the chafing dish with a handle were introductions of the reign of George II. In the American colonies, \"One chafing dish\" was inventoried among the silver at Abraham de Peyster's death in New York, 1728, though only two colonial New York examples are known to survive.\n\nIn a light form and heated over a spirit lamp, a chafing dish could also be used for cooking various dainty dishes at table— of fish, cream, eggs or cheese— for which silver chafing dishes with fine heat-insulating wooden handles were made in the late 19th century, when \"chafing-dish suppers\" became fashionable, even in households where a kitchen maid prepared all the ingredients beforehand. Specialized chafing-dish cookbooks appeared from the 1880s. A book of chafing-dish recipes printed for the silversmiths, Gorham Manufacturing Co. in New York, (2nd edition, 1894), featured a brief history of chafing dishes, followed by proper instruction for use, suggesting its novelty. Fannie Farmer's \"Chafing Dish Possibilities\" was published in Boston in 1898.\n\nModern chafing dishes are made of light metal or ceramic casseroles with handles. Standard uses of a chafing-dish in restaurants are finishing the sauces of dishes such as pressed duck and fettuccine Alfredo or in presenting flambé dishes such as crêpes Suzette and Steak Diane. In homes, it can be used to prepare and present dishes at table which must be kept hot, notably Welsh rarebit and cheese fondue. The home version sometimes includes a cover.\n\nHome and restaurant chafing dishes have gone in and out of fashion, notably in the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s.\n\nIn institutional and catering use, chafing dishes often consist of large, covered rectangular pans, sometimes disposable, held in a rack or frame over water heated by an alcohol burner as a kind of steam table for keeping food at a buffet warm. They are not used for cooking or reheating food.\n\n\n"}

For over 30 years, he was involved in implementing PDP, VAX, and Alpha computers with their respective operating systems RSX, VAX/VMS; and OpenVMS and Windows NT. He was a respected journalist and analyst, paying particular attention to HP/Compaq and the high-performance computing space, writing a series of newsletters.\n\nHe has been credited with assigning Intel Corporation the nickname \"Chipzilla\".\n\nTerry Shannon participated and spoke at meetings of DECUS (the Digital Equipment Corporation Users Society), the international users group of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), currently known as Connect. He also spoke as an authority at other IT and HPC conferences, and was quoted by other authors as an authority on the subject.\n\nTerry Craig Shannon was born in Syracuse, New York, United States. At the age of 17 he dropped out of high school and enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1969.\n\nHe served as a spook in Vietnam at a Radio Reconnaissance Field Station (i.e., the 330th RRFS) with the 509th Radio Research Group of the Army Security Agency (ASA), a branch of the National Security Agency (see NSA and/or SIGINT for explanation). During his two years (1970–1972) of Vietnam War service, Shannon was a computer communications and traffic analysis specialist. Using his training in cryptology and signal-intelligence, his job was to triangulate North Vietnamese radio signals, request an airstrike, and then return to the original frequency and listen for the enemy channel to \"go off the air.\"\n\nHe was separated from the Army with an honorable discharge in 1972. After earning his GED, Shannon received his bachelor's degree from SUNY Empire State College. He was awarded the Bronze Star, about thirty years after separation, for his service in the Vietnam War.\n\nIn May 1983, Shannon became self-employed as a writer. He published his first brief article in the May 1983 issue of \"DEC Professional\". About two years later, in September 1985, Shannon began working as a contributor for \"Digital Review\". During his tenure with \"Digital Review\", Shannon began using the pseudonym \"Charlie Matco\".\n\nWhile Shannon also frequently wrote under the pseudonyms \"Digital Dog\" and \"the notorious Belgian hacker Cedric Zool.\" Charlie Matco was by far his best known \"nom de plume\". Under the \"Charlie Matco\" byline, Terry Shannon combined a humorous writing style with erudite and timely prognostications about IT industry trends, product releases, and major business transactions, often well in advance of the public release of such information, in the \"Rumor Roundup\" feature at the end of each issue of \"Digital Review\" magazine. This information was obtained as a result of Shannon's well-polished skills at schmoozing his vast network of friends and colleagues in the IT industry, and of astutely combining information they provided.\n\n\"Charlie Matco\" was usually depicted as a cartoonish, \"private eye\" sort of figure, after the fashion of Nick Danger, but without any facial features (i.e., just a fedora, a trenchcoat, and a cigarette in one hand). That logo, which appeared next to the \"Charlie Matco\" byline on every \"Rumor Roundup\" article, was also depicted on the coffee mug, which Shannon would send to anyone who (intentionally or otherwise) provided useful information. According to Jeffrey Steinberg, former Technical Editor of \"Digital Review\", the signature on the mug was in the handwriting of Deborah McDonald, the publication's managing editor at the time. In fact, a \"Charlie Matco\" mug now lives in the Computer History Museum.\n\nOver the next two decades, Shannon wrote about trends in the IT industry. An advocate of the VMS operating system, he wrote the first version of the VMS user guide, \"Introduction to VAX/VMS\" through Professional Press in May 1985 (). This ran for five editions. According to those associated with its original publisher, Professional Press, the first edition of the book sold more than 100,000 copies. The latest (5th) edition was called \"Introduction to OpenVMS\" (). It is required reading for some Computer Science college courses.\n\nShannon began to publish a newsletter in 1994, \"Shannon Knows DEC\", which eventually became \"Shannon Knows Compaq\", after the firm's acquisition, and then \"Shannon Knows HPC\". His insider knowledge constantly frustrated those he wrote about, and HP pursued a love/hate relationship, occasionally citing him in press releases. The newsletter ran until his death in 2005.\n\nAs a well-known expert in the field, Shannon was also widely quoted in the independent trade press, such as in \"The Register\" as well as in \"Computerworld\", TechWeb, ITNews, and Cnet.\n\nShannon played an important role in the publishing industry competition between Ziff-Davis and International Data Group, the two largest technology publishing firms of the 1980s. During his tenure at Ziff's \"Digital Review\" semi-monthly, Shannon reported on unannounced products from DEC and other companies; this provided important content for \"Digital Review\" in its competitive battle with \"Digital News,\" a competition that reflected the larger rivalry between the publications' parent companies.\n\nShannon's reporting on the minicomputer industry included extensive analysis of the inroads made by IBM's AS/400 line of minicomputers against Digital's VAX line. The competition among minicomputer vendors would prove to be a turning point in Shannon's career, as eventual mergers led to his DEC newsletter shifting its focus to Compaq (later, HP-Compaq).\n\nDuring the early 1990s, much of Shannon's focus was on DEC's development of the Alpha chip, a processor intended to replace its aging VAX CPU line. As DEC prepared the Alpha chip for release, Shannon was widely used as a source of advance information on the new processor.\n\nShannon also reported extensively on Digital executives and their comings and goings within the company. Shannon analyzed the controversial departure of Robert Glorioso from DEC in terms of the struggle for control of the company as it began to founder in the 1990s.\n\nShannon was active in HPC user groups and the DEC community, including DECUS and Encompass. He served on the Encompass Board of Directors. He gave frequent lectures and seminars, including the 2005 Keynote address.\n\n"}

The performance had a very positive effect on the popularity of the bandura and ensemble bandura playing. Attempts were made by Hnat Khotkevych to repeat the performance and take the ensemble on tour throughout Ukraine, but permission was not obtained from the Russian authorities.\n\nIn 1905 there is evidence of the first performance of a bandura quartet of non-blind bandurists performing in Moscow. From 1906 small bandura ensembles began to form not just from kobzars who had participated in the Kharkiv performance of 1902 but also from non-blind bandurists and had become interested in the instrument. Groups were established by M. Domontovych in Kiev and V. Shevchenko in Moscow and the Kuban.\n\nWhat is considered to be the first professional (in the sense that this was their main livelihood) bandurist ensemble was established by Vasyl Yemetz in 1918 and became known as the Kiev Bandurist Capella. Despite periods in which the ensemble did not function due to the political turmoil within the country, the ensemble re-established and re-defined itself on numerous occasions and through its concerts stimulated the establishment of many other similar bandura groups. By 1928 there were over 900 bandura ensembles in Ukraine.\n\nActive persecution of bandurists in the 1930s resulted in many players being murdered or persecuted in the 1930s. Many of those that continued playing took the opportunity of seeking freedom emigrating to the West. The Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus which was originally established in 1941 during the Nazi occupation emigrated as a group. It settled in Detroit in the USA where it continued to actively propagated the art form in the West.\n\nThe Kiev State Bandurist Capella was re-established in Kiev in 1948 under the direction of Oleksander Minkivsky. Many members after being mobilized to the front in 1941 had died. Others had emigrated. It currently has over 70 members. Numerous other bandurist Capellas exist in Ukraine throughout the country having all male membership, mixed membership, or just female membership. A capella made up of blind bandurists also exists in Lviv.\n\nBandurist choruses, ensembles and capellas were also established in Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Paraguay, Poland, The United States, and Venezuela.\n\nMany bandurists and kobzars were persecuted by authorities that controlled Ukraine at various times because of the association of the bandura with growing Ukrainian national self-awareness. This has continued into contemporary times with the recent arrest and torture of bandurist Vasyl Liuty.\n"}

The beliefs are thought to have influenced the Brethren of the Free Spirit.\n\nThe beginnings of medieval pantheistic Christian theology lie in the early 13th century, with theologians at Paris, such as David of Dinant, Amalric of Bena, and Ortlieb of Strasbourg, and was later mixed with the millenarist theories of Gioacchino da Fiore.\n\nFourteen followers of Amalric began to preach that \"all things are One, because whatever is, is God.\" They believed that after the age of the Father (the Patriarchal Age) and the age of the Son (Christianity), a new age of the Holy Spirit was at hand. The Amalricians, who included many priests and clerics, succeeded for some time in propagating their beliefs without being detected by the ecclesiastical authorities.\nIn 1210, Peter of Nemours, Bishop of Paris, and the Chevalier Guérin, an adviser to the French King Philip II Augustus, obtained secret information from an undercover agent called Master Ralph. The intelligence gathered laid bare the inner workings of the sect, enabling authorities to arrest its principals and proselytes. That same year, a council of bishops and doctors from the University of Paris assembled to take measures for the punishment of the offenders. The ignorant converts, including many women, were pardoned. Of the principals, four were condemned to imprisonment for life. Ten members were burned at the stake.\nAlmaric was posthumously subjected to the persecution. Besides being included in the condemnation of his disciples, a special sentence of excommunication was pronounced against him in the council of 1210, and his bones were exhumed from their resting-place and cast into unconsecrated ground. The doctrine was condemned again by Pope Innocent III in the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) \"as insanity rather than heresy\", and in 1225 Pope Honorius III condemned the work of Johannes Scotus Eriugena, \"De Divisione Naturæ\", from which Amalric was supposed to have derived the beginnings of his heresy.\n\nThe movement survived, however, and later followers went even further, arguably evolving into the Brethren of the Free Spirit.\n"}

For part of its route, it traverses the median strip of the Kwinana Freeway.\n\nLegislation for the construction of the Mandurah line passed in November 1999. The original proposed route branched from the Armadale line at Kenwick, and then ran alongside the Kwinana freight line until Jandakot where it would run in the median strip of the Kwinana Freeway.\n\nHowever following a change in State Government, a bill passed that saw the route altered to start at Perth station, travel through a tunnel, traverse the Kwinana Freeway, and then continue along its initial route after Jandakot. This second route was much more direct, and allowed through services with the Joondalup line; however it was more costly.\n\nThis decision also led to the relocation of the Rockingham station from the city centre to the outer edge in order to offset the additional costs of the Perth section. The original route included tunnels to bring the railway into the Rockingham CBD. As a trade-off for relocating Rockingham station to the outer edge, the State Government promised a light rail link to the Rockingham CBD. This was later revised to a Central Area Transit style bus service partly within a dedicated busway. As part of the work the and Mount Henry Bridges were rebuilt.\n\nConstruction of the line started in February 2004. The contract for the line was awarded to a joint venture of John Holland, Macmahon Contractors and Multiplex. The contract for the city centre works, including the tunnels, was awarded to a joint venture of Leighton Contractors and Kumagai Gumi. The contractors used a tunnel boring machine manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The first tunnel was completed on 3 June 2006, and the second on 27 October 2006.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2006, the Leighton Kumagai Joint Venture was affected by a series of industrial disputes involving the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union. This culminated in the prosecution of 107 workers for taking illegal industrial action, by the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Prosecution of \"the Perth 107\" became a national and international cause célèbre, in part because it occurred as the Federal Government's industrial relations policy WorkChoices was taking place.\n\nFrom 7 to 14 October 2007, a planned shutdown of the whole Fremantle line and partial closure of the Joondalup line between Perth and Leederville stations was undertaken to allow workers to connect the Mandurah line to the Joondalup line. On 15 October 2007, Perth Underground and Esplanade stations opened. On this day, the railway also carried its first passengers with the extension of Joondalup line services to Esplanade station.\n\nOn 9 November 2007, the first train crossed to Rockingham station, testing the new railway line at around 07:30 with a driver and a group of engineers. After the line testing completed, driver training was undertaken.\n\nThe line was officially opened on 23 December 2007, with the first train carrying 1,500 passengers, including 1,000 members of the public selected by ballot.\n\nThe line replaced bus services that previously travelled along the freeway to the city, which now terminate at Mandurah line stations. The exception is Canning Highway services, which stop at Canning Bridge station before continuing to the city.\n\nOn 23 April 2017 Aubin Grove station opened between Cockburn Central and Kwinana.\n\nBelow is the annual patronage of Mandurah railway line from 2010–2011 financial year. Figures are provided as total boardings, which includes all fare-paying boardings and free travel on stations within the free transit zones as well as transfers between stations. The figures for rail replacement and special events services are not included in the total.\n\nThe section between the Perth Underground and Elizabeth Quay stations is considered to be part of both the Joondalup and Mandurah lines.

These services skip Esplanade/Elizabeth Quay and Perth on the Mandurah line as well as City West on the Fremantle line.\n\n\nAs part of Metronet, an extension of the Thornlie line with stops at Nicholson Road and Ranford Road, will meet the Mandurah line at Cockburn Central.

Barnes led The Council into an international drug trafficking ring, in partnership with the Italian-American Mafia, until his arrest in 1977. Barnes was sentenced to life imprisonment, eventually becoming a federal informant that led to the collapse of The Council in 1977.\n\nIn 2007, Barnes released a book, \"Mr. Untouchable\", written with Tom Folsom, and a documentary DVD of the same title about his life.\n\nLeroy Nicholas Barnes was born on October 15, 1933, in Harlem, New York City, into an African-American family. A good student in his youth, Barnes left home early to escape his abusive alcoholic father, turning to drug dealing for income. Barnes himself became addicted to heroin for several years in his 20s until spending time in jail, when he ended his addiction. Barnes was sent to prison in 1965 for low-level drug dealing, and while in prison he met \"Crazy\" Joe Gallo, a member of the Colombo crime family, and Matthew Madonna, a heroin dealer for the Lucchese crime family. Gallo wanted to have a greater presence in the Harlem heroin market, but did not have any personnel to deal in the predominantly African-American areas. It is believed Gallo passed on his knowledge of how to run a drug trafficking organization to Barnes, and asked him to assemble the necessary personnel. When Gallo was released from jail, he provided a lawyer for Barnes, who subsequently had his conviction overturned on a technicality. On his return to New York City, Barnes began to assemble his personnel, and began cutting and packaging heroin.\n\nIn 1972, to deal more efficiently with other black gangsters in Harlem, Barnes founded The Council, a seven-man organization consisting of Barnes, Joseph \"Jazz\" Hayden, Wallace Rice, Thomas \"Gaps\" Foreman, Ishmael Muhammed, Frank James, and Guy Fisher. The Council was modelled after the Italian-American Mafia families, where it settled disputes among the criminals, and handled distribution problems and other drug trade related issues.\n\nBy 1976, Barnes' operation spread throughout all of New York State and into Pennsylvania and Canada. According to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) records, Barnes' operation in 1976 consisted of seven lieutenants, who each controlled a dozen mid-level distributors, who in turn supplied upwards of 40 street level dealers each.\n\nBarnes set up front companies to protect some of his assets, such as numerous car dealerships, which appeared to be rented through those companies. The DEA eventually discovered the true ownership of the companies and seized the cars, including a Bentley, a Citroën SM, a Maserati, a Mercedes-Benz, a yellow Volvo, and several Cadillacs, Lincoln Continentals, and Ford Thunderbirds. Barnes' net worth had reached over $50 million at the height of his career. A \"New York Times\" article estimated Barnes purchased hundreds of tailor-made suits, Italian shoes, coats, and jewelry, which alone was valued at over $7 million. During this time, Barnes had become the dominant drug lord in Harlem, and was given the name \"Mr. Untouchable\" after successfully beating numerous charges and arrests. It is believed while under surveillance, Barnes would often make pointless stops and go on high-speed chases with little purpose other than to aggravate those following him. The Council also employed contract killers, such as Robert Young aka Willie Sanchez.\n\nOn June 5, 1977, \"The New York Times Magazine\" released an article titled \"Mr. Untouchable\", featuring Barnes posing on the front cover. The magazine told Barnes that they were going to use a mug shot of Barnes unless he posed for the cameras. Barnes, who hated mug shots, agreed and took the shot. Barnes' posture of smug invulnerability so affronted President Jimmy Carter that the President ordered the United States Attorney General, Griffin Bell, to prosecute Barnes to the fullest extent of the law. The Justice Department prosecuted Barnes for his drug-related crimes and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole on January 19, 1978. The chief prosecutor in the case was Robert B. Fiske, then the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nAccording to Barnes, while in prison he discovered that his assets were not being maintained, and The Council had stopped paying his attorneys' fees. Barnes discovered that one of his fellow Council members, Guy Fisher, was having an affair with Barnes' mistress. The Council had a rule that no council member would sleep with another Council member's wife or mistress, so in response Barnes became a federal informant. He forwarded a list of 109 names, five of them Council members', along with his wife's name, implicating them all in illegal activities related to the heroin trade. Barnes helped to indict 44 other traffickers, 16 of whom were ultimately convicted. In this testimony, he implicated himself in eight murders. While in prison, he also won a national poetry contest for federal inmates, earned a college diploma with honors, and taught fellow inmates English.\n\nAfter Barnes cooperated with the government by working as an informant, Rudolph Giuliani sought a reversal of Barnes' life sentence. Eventually, Barnes was resentenced to 35 years. By working in jail, he earned two months off his sentence and was released in August 1998.\n\nIn 2007, Barnes and his former competitor, Frank Lucas, sat down with \"New York\" magazine's for a conversation between men who had not spoken to each other in three decades.\n\nBarnes became part of the United States Federal Witness Protection Program. His memoir, \"Mr. Untouchable: My Crimes and Punishments\", was published in 2007, and he appeared in a documentary about his gang life, also titled \"Mr. Untouchable\" (2007). On January 31, 2008, Howard Stern interviewed Barnes on Stern's Sirius Satellite Radio show.\n\nBarnes died from cancer on June 18, 2012; however, because he was under witness protection, his death was not contemporaneously reported under his birth name, and news of his death only became known in June 2019.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2064194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064194", "title": "Jim Branning", "text": "Jim Branning\n\nJim Branning is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\", played by John Bardon, first appearing on 29 April 1996 and becoming a regular character in 1999. He remained in the series until 2011.\n\nJim was temporarily written out of the show in August 2007 due to Bardon suffering a stroke, and a storyline was created in which his character also suffered a stroke. Bardon returned to film four episodes in the latter half of 2008, and returned permanently from the episode broadcast on 20 August 2009. On 1 April 2011 it was reported by the \"Daily Mirror\" that Bardon had filmed his final scenes and had left. He departed on 26 May 2011, and, although it was said the character may re-appear in the future if Bardon's health improved, this did not happen and the actor died on 12 September 2014, more than three years after leaving the series. Following Bardon's death, it was announced in March 2015 that \"EastEnders\" would pay tribute to him and the character by staging a funeral for Jim.\n\nJim dated his first wife Reenie (Joy Graham), with her giving birth to their oldest child Derek (Terence Beesley; later Jamie Foreman) out of wedlock. When Reenie became pregnant again with eldest daughter April (Debbie Arnold), Jim settled in a loveless marriage to Reenie, having four more children with her. A heavy drinker, Jim treated his children unfairly, favouring some and neglecting others. When his son Max (Jake Wood) was blamed for stealing and losing a medal that Jim's mother was given during the World War II in honour of his late father for bravery, Jim severed all ties with him and lost all contact with Max. It was generally believed that Jim locked Max in a coffin on the latter’s 13th birthday in retaliation for Max being friends with a non-white classmate. (It was later claimed by Derek that he did this, not their father.)\n\nJim was an amateur boxer using the nickname \"Basher\" Branning, but according to Kate Lock's book \"Who's Who\", he had been a \"semi-invalid\" for much of his working life following a drunken fall from a bedroom window, though he managed to maintain a job collecting supermarket trolleys until he was forced to retire.\n\nJim first appears when his daughter April is supposed to marry her fiancé Nikos. When Nikos jilts April at the altar, Jim's second daughter Carol (Lindsey Coulson) marries her boyfriend Alan Jackson (Howard Antony) instead. Jim is racist and therefore is against Carol marrying a black man. He storms out, refusing to give her away. Three years later, Carol visits him in Southend, and later that year Jim moves to Walford following Reenie's death and it does not take him long to chase after an eligible widow on Albert Square, Dot Cotton (June Brown). She becomes his second wife, marrying him in 2002 after a proposal in the London Eye. After a mishap with viagra, Dot decides that their marriage should remain purely platonic. Jim also has to fight off attention from several spinsters, including Maureen Carter (Diana Coupland) and Doris Moisey (Marcia Ashton), the latter nearly causing the Brannings' separation.\n\nDespite being overtly racist initially, these hostile feelings mellow, as shown through his close friendship with the Trinidadian shopkeeper, Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker). Jim works as a potman, collecting glasses in The Queen Victoria public house, and likes to drink and gamble, to Dot's dismay. He is initially opposed to his granddaughter Sonia's (Natalie Cassidy) lesbian relationship with Naomi Julien (Petra Letang) but later gives his blessing. He clashes with Dot after she takes in an illegal immigrant, Anya (Olga Fedori), whose baby, Tomas, they find at a church. He reports Anya to immigration and she is taken into custody, but Dot keeps Anya's baby and makes Jim promise to look after him with her. In their old age, the Brannings struggle to look after the child, and Dot eventually listens to Jim's pleas and hands the baby over to social services.\n\nJim goes to stay with Carol after she is taken ill, but he suffers a stroke while he is there. Unable to take care of him, Dot has Jim admitted to a nursing home. He visits his family and friends in Walford several times, the first occasion being on his 75th birthday in August 2008 when his daughter Suzy (Maggie O'Neill) has come to stay. He later visits at Christmas, but continues to reject his son Max and animosity between them resurfaces. Following rehabilitation, Jim is permitted to return to live at home in 2009, now in better health. He can speak no more than a few words, but communicates through gestures and facial expressions, and uses a walking stick and wheelchair to get around. In February 2010, Dot's granddaughter Dotty (Molly Conlin) attempts to get Jim sent back to the care home by pouring water on his lap to make it look like he has wet himself. However, Dotty is immediately caught out. As Dot and Jim celebrate their eighth wedding anniversary in The Queen Victoria, the police arrest Dot, ruining the party and distressing Jim. He draws a picture of him and Dot as an anniversary present for her. Jim and Max bond over the death of his grandson, Max's son Bradley (Charlie Clements) and he comforts Max on the day of the funeral, kissing his hand. When Jim's youngest son Jack (Scott Maslen) is in a coma after being shot, Jim is present when he is woken up by medical staff. Jim then cries when he finds out Jack is paralysed, knowing the pain of living with a disability. Jim and Dot are later befriended by teenager Fatboy (Ricky Norwood). A few weeks later, when his grandson Billie Jackson (Devon Anderson) dies (October 2010), Carol goes to visit Jim, who starts crying, and she breaks down in his arms.\n\nWhen Carol sees Dot and Jim have no photos of Billie, she accuses them of racism. Dot says she asked Billie for photos but was not given any, and tells Carol to leave, which she does after she sees Jim nod in agreement to Dot. When Carol later arranges a family meal, she invites Jim and Dot to attend. Dot initially refuses, but later forgives her and states that Jim is still upset about Carol's accusations, so she attends alone. However, Carol shouts at Dot after a family argument, saying that she meant what she said to Jim. Carol then spends Jack's wedding day with Jim after they have reconciled. Jim later spends time in respite care after Dot fractures her wrist. In May 2011, she hires a carer, Marta Demboski (Magdalena Kurek), and asks her to help look after Jim when he returns, but sacks her when she think she has stolen money. Dot subsequently struggles to cope with Jim and is distressed by the constant noise of his buzzer. She tells Jim that she cannot cope and later asks Carol why she had to meet Jim \"so near the end\". Carol, Max and Jack help Dot to make the decision to put Jim into permanent care, and he is taken away in an ambulance. Carol visited Jim in January 2014 (however, only the hand of a stand-in was seen on screen).\n\nIn April 2015, Carol receives the news that Jim has died after suffering a heart attack. Sonia informs Dot, who is in prison awaiting trial for the murder of her son, Nick (John Altman). Carol also tells Patrick that Jim is dead, while Sonia tells Max. Max and Carol struggle with the fact they disliked their father for a large amount of his life and thus having to mourn for him. Dot initially refuses to attend the funeral, believing she was negligent of him in his last days and this is what led to his death. She eventually changes her mind and the Brannings hold Jim's funeral.\n\nOn the behest of producer John Yorke in 2000, Jim was paired romantically with pensioner Dot Cotton, played by June Brown; a slow courtship was featured, with Dot often shown to be outraged by Jim's advances, resulting in numerous rejections. Dot finally succumbed and accepted his marriage proposal in an episode that aired in November 2001; the scenes were filmed inside one of the carriages of the London Eye on the South Bank of the River Thames. Their wedding aired on 14 February 2002, Valentine's Day. \"The Guardian\" critic, Nancy Banks-Smith, described the wedding as \"uniquely uneventful [...] For Dot and Jim 'In sickness and health... till death do us part' seemed to carry more resonance than for most.\"\n\nBardon has revealed that both he and Brown were sceptical about their characters marrying. In an interview with American fan-based newspaper, \"Walford Gazette\", he commented, \"No way did the pair of us want to get married because we thought if we got married, we'd sit indoors and watch the telly every night. As it happened, we've had some nice things to do. And we are married, and it's worked out all right.\" Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim, but that producers persuaded her that the marriage might be a good thing. On-screen, Dot had suffered the death of her grandson Ashley, and Brown felt that a traumatic event like that would have changed her character. In her opinion, the only way Dot would have got over Ashley's death \"would be to have someone else to care for and when it happened there was nobody [but] with marrying Jim she gets a family - that's what persuaded me. That house will become a house again - it will have a central point, they will be able to use the house as a central point, as Dot will be there.\"\n\nCritic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to \"Coronation Street\"'s Hilda and Stan Ogden, comparing a scene in \"EastEnders\" where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from \"Coronation Street\", that aired decades before. June Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: \"Initially, Jim wasn't the sort of person that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied - he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot - heaven knows why! I think that you always have to work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around.\" Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying \"We work very well together - he's got great timing and he can be very tender too.\"\n\nThe on-screen relationship between Dot and Jim was halted in 2007 when Jim was written out of the soap due to Bardon's health problems. In the script Jim suffered a stroke and was placed in the care of off-screen relatives. Dot and Jim remained together, with Jim making sporadic appearances between 2008 and 2009 to visit Dot. A more permanent return for the character was hinted at in 2009. However, it was reported in April 2011 that Bardon had filmed his exit from the series, and that the show's staff believed it marked the end of the character. A source told the \"Daily Mirror\": \"Dot's been struggling for a while and realises that she can no longer give Jim the care and attention he deserves and is forced to make the heartbreaking decision that he should move into a home. [...] It was very emotional on the set for the scenes where Dot discusses her decision and talks to Jim about him going into care for good. There were a lot of tears. [...] The feeling is that this is the end of Jim as a character because he won't leave the home and won't ever be a regular in Albert Square again.\" It was reported that Jim could still appear on screen in the care home if Bardon's health permitted it; however, this did not happen. Jim's final appearance was aired 26 May 2011.\n\nIn 2002, Bardon was nominated in the Best Comedy Performance category at The British Soap Awards, and along with Brown, won Best On-Screen Partnership in 2002 and again in 2005. They also won Best Couple at the Inside Soap Awards in 2005 and Bardon was nominated for Funniest Star for his portrayal of Jim. In November 2010, \"EastEnders\" won the Sainsbury's Award for Mainstreaming Disability at the 2010 Cultural Diversity Network Awards, where the judges praised the character.\n"}

He was provost of the collegiate church of Corstorphine, and one of the chaplains to James V of Scotland. On 5 September 1528 he was nominated Lord High Treasurer on the downfall of the Earl of Angus, replacing Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie. James V also gave Robert a tenement in Edinburgh close to a house of Andrew Moubray that had been given to Kilspindie.\n\nKnowing that the Abbot of Holyrood was on the point of death, Robert, according to George Buchanan, wagered a large sum with James V that he would not present him to the first vacant benefice, while the King, quite well aware of what he referred to, accepted and won the wager. Suspected of favouring the cause of the Douglases, he lost the treasurership almost as soon as he obtained it, although he again held it from 1537 to 1539. On 23 June 1539 he was admitted to the see of Ross, and shortly afterwards received \"in commendam\" the abbacy of Fern, the dilapidated state of which his wealth was expected to repair.

In China, the Guyaju Caves located near Dongmenying, Yanqing District, Beijing are a cave complex of many rock hewn dwellings that form a community. In the United States and Mexico, among the canyons of the southwest, in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado and Chihuahua, some cliff dwellings are still used by Native Americans. There has been considerable discussion as to their antiquity, but modern research finds no definite justification for assigning them to a distinct primitive race, or farther back than the ancestors of the modern Pueblo people. The area in which they occur coincides with that in which other traces of the Pueblo tribes have been found. The niches that were used are often of considerable size, occurring in cliffs up to a thousand feet in height, and approached by rock steps or log ladders.\n\n\n"}

Evans and Sassi used the gimmick of a pair of boisterous, prank playing fraternity members.

{"id": "2064212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064212", "title": "Lawspeaker", "text": "Lawspeaker\n\nA lawspeaker or lawman (Swedish: \"lagman\", Old Swedish: \"laghmaþer\" or \"laghman\", Danish: \"lovsigemand\", Norwegian: \"lagmann\", Icelandic: \"lög(sögu)maður\", Faroese: \"løgmaður\", Finnish: \"laamanni\", ) is a unique Scandinavian legal office. It has its basis in a common Germanic oral tradition, where wise people were asked to recite the law, but it was only in Scandinavia that the function evolved into an office. Two of the most famous lawspeakers are Snorri Sturluson and Torgny the Lawspeaker.\n\nIn Sweden, this office was the most important one of regional governments, where each \"lagsaga\" (usually the same as the traditional province) was the jurisdiction of a lawspeaker who was subordinate to the lawspeaker of Tiundaland. The lawspeaker presided over the things, worked as a judge and formulated the laws that had been decided by the people. The lawspeaker was obliged to memorize the law and to recite it at the thing. He was also responsible for the administration at the thing and for the execution of the decisions, and it was his duty to safeguard the rights and liberties of the people and to speak in their behalf to the king or his representative. It was the lawspeaker who, on the behalf of the people, recognized the elected king when he passed on the Eriksgata. However, after the establishment of the province laws, ca 1350, he would participate at the Stone of Mora with twelve companions from his jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to the Westrogothic law, the lawspeaker was appointed for life by the yeomen (\"bönder\") of the province from among their number; it was also stipulated that his father should also have been a landowner. The office was not hereditary, but he was usually selected from the more powerful families.\n\nThe first named Swedish lawspeaker, if the text is correct, is the Lum recorded in a register of Västergötland lawmen copied by Laurentius Dyakn, a priest in Vidhem, in the 1320s; he must have lived around 1000. The first Swedish lawspeaker for whom we have substantial biographical information is Eskil (c. 1175-1227), the seventeenth in Laurentius's list. From the mid-13th century and onwards, the lawspeakers became more attached to the king, and it was common that lawspeakers were members of the king's council. King Magnus Eriksson decided that the king would influence the appointment of the lawspeakers. Six nobles and six yeomen would in consultation with two clergymen appoint three men from the jurisdiction among whom the king would select the one he deemed to be most fit. This procedure would be in effect until the 16th century when the whole process of selection was transferred to the king.\n\nFrom then on, the lawspeakers only came from the nobility, and it had turned into a pension, in which a member of the Privy Council of Sweden was selected and received a salary, but had other people taking care of the work. This privilege was abolished during the Reduction of 1680, after which the lawspeakers were obliged to take care of the work themselves, and there were checks on the appointment of members of the privy council. Still, the appointment remained restricted to noblemen until 1723.\n\nBy then, the functions of the office had become restricted to that of a judge, a function which also became less important by time. In 1849, the office was abolished, but the title remained occasionally in use as a title of honour for governors.\n\nIn 1947, the title of \"lagman\" (pl. \"lagmän\") was reintroduced for senior judges, namely the presidents of divisions of the courts of appeal. Since reform in 1969, presidents of the district courts (\"tingsrätter\") are \"lagmän\", while presidents of divisions of the courts of appeal are \"hovrättslagmän\" (\"court of appeal lawspeakers\"). Correspondingly, presidents of the district administrative courts (\"förvaltningsrätter\") also carry the title of \"lagman\" and presidents of divisions of the administrative courts of appeal are \"kammarrättslagmän\" (\"administrative court of appeal lawspeakers\"). \n\nFinland being governed by Swedish law wholly until 1809, the events were the same as in Sweden. However, the \"lagman\" offices were terminated and \"lagman\" became an honorific title only in 1868 (at that time laws were published also in Finnish and thus also the term \"laamanni\" official). In the 1993 reform, \"laamanni\" and \"lagman\" were reintroduced as the title of the chief judge of a district court or a senior judge in a court of appeal.\n\nIn Norway, the lawspeakers remained counselors versed in the law until king Sverre I of Norway (1184–1202) made them into his officials. In the laws of Magnus VI of Norway (1263–80), they were given the right to function as judges and to preside at the lagtings (the Norwegian superior courts). Modern historians regard the lawspeakers in ancient times (especially before around 1600), of which there were 10–12 in the entire kingdom, as part of the nobility. In the 14th and 15th centuries they were usually recruited from the existing higher nobility, with some holding the rank of knight, the highest rank of nobility in the kingdom. In the 16th century they were still usually recruited from the existing nobility, albeit more often from the lower nobility. Lawspeakers received fiefs. For example, Marker fief was by tradition held by the lawspeaker of Oslo. They were also treated as equal to the nobility on formal occasions.\n\nThe historical lagtings and the office of lawspeaker were abolished in 1797, but the title was reinstituted in 1887 together with the introduction of the jury system.\n\nIn Iceland, the office was introduced in 930, when the Althing was established. He was elected for three years. Besides his function as the president of the thing, his duties were restricted to counselling and to reciting the law. It was the sole government office of the mediaeval Icelandic Commonwealth. The lawspeaker was elected for a term of three years and was supposed to declaim the law at the Althing, a third of it each summer. In fact, Grímr Svertingsson's term was cut short, not because of incompetence or illness, but because his voice was too weak for the job. Apart from his function as a lawsayer and chairman of the court, the \"lǫgsǫgumaðr\" had no formal power, but he would often be appointed as an arbitrator in the frequently arising disputes. The office lingered on for a few years in the transitional period after 1262, after which it was replaced with a \"lǫgmaðr\". The traditional date for the founding of the Althing is 930 with Úlfljótr appearing as a founding figure and the original author of the laws. After the union with Norway in 1264, two royal lawspeakers were appointed who had an important influence on the legal processes at the thing. The office was abolished together with the Althing in 1800.\n\nScholars are suspicious of the fact that Úlfljótur's first two successors have been assigned a period in office of exactly 20 summers each, but from \"Þorkell máni\" on, the chronology is probably correct; names are given in their modern Icelandic form.\n\n\n"}

Several entrances found by local explorers were rough and difficult. They were closed when the property was bought in 1896 by the Louisville & Nashville railway and a new approach made. From the surface to the floor is under Chester Sandstone and in the St. Louis Limestone.\n\nFossil corals fix the geological age of the rock. The temperature is uniformly , and the atmosphere is optically and chemically pure. There are gypsum rosettes and helictites.\nTremendous forces have been at work in the caves, suggesting earthquakes and eruptions, but they are a result of the chemical and mechanical action of water.\n\nEdgar Vaughan and W. L. Marshall, civil engineers, surveyed every part of the cave. Vaughan's Dome is wide, long, and high. Numerous other domes exist, and many deep pits. The so-called \"Ruins of Carthage\" fill a hall and high, whose flat roof is a vast homogeneous limestone block. Isolated detached blocks measure from in length. The grandest place of all is the Colossal Dome, which used to be entered only from the apex by windlass and a rope reaching to the floor. This is now used only for illumination by raising and lowering a fire-basket.\n\nThe present entrance is by a gateway buttressed by alabaster shafts, one of which, high, is named Henry Clay's Monument. The dome walls rise in a series of richly tinted rings, each thick and fringed by stalactites. The symmetry is remarkable, and the reverberations are strangely musical. The Pearly Pool, in a chamber near a pit 86 ft. deep, glistens with numerous cave pearls. The route beyond is between rows of stately shafts, and ends in a copious chalybeate spring. Blind flies, spiders, beetles and crickets abound; and now and then a blind crawfish darts through the waters; but as compared with many caverns the fauna and flora are not abundant.\n\nIt is conjectured, not without some reason, that there is a connexion, as yet undiscovered, between the Colossal and the Mammoth caves. It seems certain that Eden Valley, which now lies between them, is a vast \"tumble-down\" of an immense cavern that formerly united them into one.\n\nThe Bedquilt section of the caves was the inspiration and setting for the first text adventure computer game. Created by Will Crowther, a caver who spent many hours helping to survey the cave, and appropriately called \"Colossal Cave\" or \"ADVENT\", the computer game was expanded by Don Woods into the game now known as \"Adventure\".\n\n"}

They were formed in 1984 by Allen West, Bill Andrews, Rick Rozz, and Terry Butler, and soon after vocalist Kam Lee joined. The band has reunited several times with varying line-ups, most recently in late 2016.\n\nMassacre were formed in 1984 by Allen West (guitar), Bill Andrews (drums), Mike Borders (bass) and soon joined by Kam Lee. They disbanded and re-united again several times. In 1987, Rozz, Andrews and Butler joined Death, but by 1991 the three later rejoined with Rick Rozz (guitar) and Massacre released their debut album \"From Beyond\" on Earache Records, followed by an EP a year later (featuring Cronos of Venom). After the release of the EP the band split up again. Rozz reformed the band in 1993 and released a new album \"Promise\" in 1996. That same year, Kam Lee left the band during post-production of \"Promise\" due to being dissatisfied with the songs and his performance. Kam Lee, Terry Butler and Steve Swanson along with Sam Williams and Curtis Beeson temporarily reunited as Massacre in 2006. Butler, Lee, Beeson & Williams then founded Denial Fiend with Blaine Cook replacing Lee and Rob Rampy replacing Beeson in 2008. In 2011, Butler and Rozz reunited for an anniversary tour of \"From Beyond\" beginning January 14 in Tampa, Florida.\n\nButler and Rozz reformed Massacre in late 2011, with Mike Mazzonetto on drums and Ed Webb on vocals, and subsequently played the \"70,000 Tons of Metal\" cruise from Miami, Florida to Grand Cayman in January 2012. In March 2012, under the wing of lawyer Eric Greif - coincidentally Butler and Rozz's manager in Death - the band signed an international recording deal with Century Media Records, announcing a 7\" release prior to their August 2012 appearance at the Wacken Festival in Germany and the release of their full-length album in early 2014.\n\nOn December 11, 2014 it was announced that bassist Terry Butler and vocalist Ed Webb left the band. As the result, Massacre disbanded.\n\nMassacre reformed once more in December 2016 under the name Massacre X, in reference to it being the band's tenth lineup. However, original drummer Bill Andrews threatened to sue the band over the use of the name, leading to them rebranding themselves as Gods of Death, in reference to their significance in the development of death metal. The band eventually returned to using the original Massacre moniker in July 2019, with former bassist Michael Borders returning to the band.\n\nOn September 9, 2019, it was announced that Rick Rozz and Mike Mazzonetto have both quit the band according to founding member Kam Lee. The band announced a new lineup three months later and plans to release a new studio album in 2020.\n\nMembers and ex-members of Massacre have played in many notable bands, most notably Death, Obituary, Six Feet Under, Metalucifer, Hate Plow, Kreator, Nasty Savage, Zero Hour and Whiplash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Jake appears in the show in episodes originally broadcast in the United Kingdom between 30 December 2004 and 20 October 2006. His casting was announced by executive producer Kathleen Hutchison on 20 October 2004. Jake is introduced alongside his younger brother Danny Moon (Jake Maskall) and upon his arrival was described as \"the sensitive brother who had an eye for the ladies\", while Beckett expressed his happiness at joining the show . In March 2005, Beckett and Maskall were axed but Jake was reintroduced to the show later in the year.\n\nJake and Danny are cousins of established character Alfie Moon (Shane Richie). During his time on the show, Jake represents several plotlines that each contribute to his strained interactions with both Danny and their crime boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) - most notably in the Get Johnny Week scenario where Jake accidentally kills Danny shortly after learning that Danny had killed local hardman Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) on Johnny's orders. This involves the character developing a feud with Johnny's gangland rival Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), up to the point where Jake witnesses Johnny killing Andy on the show's 20th anniversary episode; sparking a romance with local barlady Chrissie Watts (Tracy Ann Oberman) that leads to the pair attempting to flee the county after Jake discovered that Chrissie murdered her estranged husband Den (Leslie Grantham) and framed her nemesis Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) for the crime; becoming embroiled in Chrissie and Johnny's respective feuds against the Mitchell family; having a brief conflict with Sam's brothers Phil (Steve McFadden) and Grant (Ross Kemp) in light of both Danny's death and Johnny's arrest; forming a brief relationship with fellow neighbour Carly Wicks (Kellie Shirley); and clashing with his business partner Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) upon learning of his scheme to exploit Johnny's adolescent daughter Ruby (Louisa Lytton).\n\nOn 7 May 2006, Beckett announced that he was quitting the show and departed on 20 October 2006. His last scene saw him being confronted by mobsters shortly after Johnny died of a heart attack in prison, and his fate has never been revealed although he is presumed dead.\n\nJake Moon makes his first appearance on 30 December 2004, arriving in Walford along with his brother Danny (Jake Maskall); the pair soon turn out to be second cousins of Alfie (Shane Richie) and his brother Spencer (Christopher Parker) respectively. Alfie reluctantly allows them to stay with at his house up until the start of 2005, but decides not to chuck them out when Spencer leaves Walford. It quickly becomes clear that Jake and Danny are hiding something from Alfie when the latter takes notices of his cousins' odd behavior, particularly when their crime boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) arrives in Walford to confront them; Jake and Danny were supposed to be doing a package deal on Johnny's behalf, but they messed up because of Danny's incompetence - as well as Johnny discovering drugs within the stash bash filled with cash. Wanting Jake to remain in Walford and keep Danny \"in check\", Johnny arranges for them to work for fellow mob boss Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) - whom Jake and Danny have already made an enemy off after stealing his car, before Jake punches Andy for badmouthing Danny. A partnership is soon established between Andy and Johnny, which quickly gets out of hand as Danny continues to cause trouble - forcing Jake to fix up the damage his brother is causing. When Johnny plans on retiring from his life of crime, he authorizes Jake to act out as Andy's representative for an upcoming trade exchange; however, he later puts Jake out of the exchange, upon deducing Andy's plan to con him out of £750,000 - which prompts Andy to employ Danny as his representative, instead; Danny agrees to help Andy, so that he could relish in watching Johnny getting outdone, but Andy betrays him shortly after the deal is secured. However, Johnny has arranged for Andy's bodyguard Eddie to bring Andy before him and prepares for Jake to intercept Andy. When Andy awaits for Eddie's return from the toilets in his car, Jake turns up to reclaim the £750,000 from Andy before Johnny appears - requesting he and Andy have a \"conversation\". Jake then witnesses the two mobsters seemingly parting ways, but is shocked to end up seeing Johnny thrust Andy off the flyover - killing him; Jake then drives Johnny back to Walford as the police arrive at the scene of where Andy was murdered.\n\nJake struggles to cope with observing Andy's murder and ends up sharing the information to Danny as the latter, who had recently learned of Andy's death, grows paranoid in fear that Johnny will come after them next. In July 2005, Jake and Danny plan to leave Walford after Danny sets fire to Johnny's house. Whilst Jake is saying goodbye to Chrissie Watts (Tracy Ann Oberman), Johnny forces Danny into his car. He gives Jake a chance to leave, but Jake gets into the car to stay with Danny. Johnny drives them to a forest and locks Jake in the car as he prepares to shoot Danny; however, Jake kicks the car window out and escapes into the woods to find them. He tries to persuade Johnny not to kill Danny. The episode ends with Johnny raising the gun at both of them; however, their fate is not revealed until a few months later when Jake turns up, where it turns out that Johnny let them go - under the agreement that they were not seen again.\n\nJake returns to Walford and informs Johnny that he will not be starting trouble, as he is there for personal reasons; Johnny allows him to stay. Jake soon repairs his relationship with Chrissie - whom he recently had a fling with - and is later shocked when she admits to have killed her husband and Johnny's close friend, Den (Leslie Grantham) - whose body had been uncovered from the cellar of The Queen Victoria pub, several weeks before; Jake is further surprised to learn that Chrissie killed Den on the same night that Johnny murdered Andy - as well as framing her nemesis Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) for the crime. By the time Johnny and several other residents are doubting Chrissie's innocence, Jake joins her quest to leave Walford and quickly creates a partnership between Chrissie and Johnny with the intent of helping her sell The Queen Vic to tie up her loose ends - as well as his own in the terms of making amends with his ex-crime boss; however, they are both unaware that the confession was caught on CCTV at Johnny's club Scarlet. Chrissie ends up getting arrested as she and Jake are at the airport, ready to flee abroad. Chrissie is remanded in prison pending her trial, but Jake promises never to ditch Chrissie and he proposes marriage to her. Chrissie tells Jake that she does not want Jake to put his life on hold for all the years that she will be in prison. She tells him she is going to plead guilty to the murder and let Jake go. She makes him promise that he will never visit her again.\n\nSometime later, Jake discovers Danny has been living in Johnny's mansion in Essex. He manages to locate Danny and tries to persuade him to return to Walford together, but Danny says Johnny's home is also his home now. Jake realizes Danny has become mentally unstable since his time away from Walford, and that Johnny is just using him to do his dirty work. Danny then reveals that he owes Johnny a favor, and in order to gain his approval, he had to do something. Danny then shows Jake a mobile phone recording of Andy's best-friend, Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), being stabbed to death on New Year's Eve 2005. Jake is shocked when he realizes Danny had killed Dennis on Johnny's orders. Jake confronts Danny for his recklessness, prompting the latter to threaten him with a pistol; the pair end up having a fight when Jack punches Danny, only for his younger brother to then knock him unconscious. Jake regains consciousness just as Sam's brothers Phil (Steve McFadden) and Grant (Ross Kemp) arrive to confront Johnny - seeking to bring him to justice for Dennis' murder as they had promised to their ex-lover Sharon (Letitia Dean), who recently married Dennis months before his death. However, Johnny ends up capturing the brothers and orders Danny to kill them. Danny prepares to kill Grant with a shotgun, but just as he is about to pull the trigger, Jake intervenes with Danny's pistol - which he dropped during the earlier struggle between them - and shoots his younger brother in a desperate attempt to stop him. Though he intended to wound Danny by shooting him in the arm or the leg, Jake had killed his brother when Grant confirms that Danny is dead. As Phil and Grant leave to confront Johnny again, Jake mourns the loss of his brother and proceeds to bury Danny in the woods with a spade - which he then uses to mark his grave. Jake then notices Johnny calling Danny on his phone, and answers the call - indirectly telling Johnny about Danny's death whilst also stating that Phil and Grant are still alive; Johnny would later get arrested for the murders of Andy and Dennis. Following Johnny's arrest, Jake takes his daughter Ruby (Louisa Lytton) back with him to Walford and looks after her.\n\nAs Jake copes with the events of Danny's death and Johnny's arrest, he forms a relationship with Carly Wicks (Kellie Shirley); however, he ends it in August 2006. Jake soon becomes concerned for Ruby when she begins dating Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky), the brother of Ruby's best-friend Stacey (Lacey Turner). He rightly guesses that Sean is using Ruby, and is only interested in her money. Jake and Sean become bitter enemies, but Sean convinces Ruby that he loves her and that Jake is trying to cause trouble between them. Ruby even tells Sean that it was Jake who had murdered Danny - giving Sean a hold over Jake. In October 2006, Jake turns to Johnny - who has been paying Jake to look after Ruby, since he has been in prison - and tells him what Sean is doing. When Johnny arranges for Sean to visit him in prison, Sean ignores his threats to stay away from Ruby and tells Johnny that there is nothing that he or Jake can do to stop him. Johnny attempts to phone Jake to order him to kill Sean, but he has a heart attack before he can dial and only manages to whisper \"Jake...kill him for me\" - mistakenly thinking he is speaking to Jake. Johnny's cellmate assumes that Johnny wants Jake killed, and Johnny dies soon after in hospital. Jake later decides to leave Walford, but as he walks out of Albert Square, he is confronted by a stranger - who asks if he is Jake Moon. What happens next is not revealed.\n\nThe character's arrival was announced on 20 October 2004, and Beckett was quoted as saying \"I've watched the programme since the beginning and I'm very excited to be joining such a successful television institution\". Three months after their on-screen arrival, Jake and his brother Danny were axed from the show. However, producer Kate Harwood gave Jake a reprieve, and the character subsequently took a short break from the show which coincided with Danny's exit and then returned.\n\nJake and Danny always tried to imitate the Mitchell brothers, but second-rate gangsters is all they were. Jake is described, the sensitive brother who had an eye for the ladies.\n\nIt was announced on 7 May 2006 that Beckett had quit the role to move on and further his career, and the character made his final appearance on 20 October 2006. Jake ended up with a contract out on his life, after Johnny Allen's dying words were misconstrued. He was last seen leaving Albert Square being confronted by a sinister looking stranger.\n"}

He was a member of the group nicknamed the \"Rolex 12\", a group of 12 men who were closest to Marcos and allegedly were his enforcers of Martial Law. He is also an honorary member of PMA Class 1951. Cojuangco also was accused by the military men at the scene of Benigno Aquino Jr.'s assassination, as the leader who orchestrated the crime.\n\nHe is currently the chairman emeritus of the Nationalist People's Coalition, the party he founded in 1992 which served as his vehicle to further his aspirations in the 1992 presidential elections. He was a candidate for the Philippine presidency in 1992, ultimately losing in a tight election to Fidel V. Ramos. Ramos received 23.6% of the vote.

The goal is to provide an alternative to DOM interfaces that uses a simpler syntax for accessing XML documents. It also offers a new way of making XML visible. Before the release of E4X, XML was always accessed at an object level. E4X instead treats XML as a primitive (like characters, integers, and booleans). This implies faster access, better support, and acceptance as a building block (data structure) of a program.\n\nE4X is standardized by Ecma International in the ECMA-357 standard. The first edition was published in June 2004, the second edition in December 2005.\n\nThe E4X standard was deprecated by the Mozilla Foundation in 2014.\n\nE4X is supported by Mozilla's Rhino, used in OpenOffice.org and several other projects. It is also supported by Tamarin, the JavaScript engine used in the Flash virtual machine. It is not supported by other common engines like Nitro (Safari), V8 (Google Chrome), Carakan (Opera), Chakra (Internet Explorer) and Chakra (Edge).\n\nE4X was also supported by SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox and Thunderbird), but has been removed. In Firefox 10, E4X syntax was no longer accepted in SpiderMonkey when ECMAScript 5 \"strict mode\" is enabled.

The service pattern used to comprise a mixture of shuttle services along the branch and through trains along the Rhymney Line to Caerphilly, or the Coryton Line to Coryton, but since December 2005 is a shuttle service from Queen Street station.\n\nOriginally a portion of the Taff Vale Railway's main line to Cardiff's Bute Docks, in 1922, it was absorbed, along with the neighbouring Rhymney Railway, into the enlarged Great Western Railway. With the decline of coal traffic and the closure of the Bute Docks, it now sees only passenger services, and is regarded as a branch from the line through to .\n\nAt privatisation in 1995, services were operated by the Cardiff Railway Company, which traded as Valley Lines. This was subsumed by the new Wales & Borders franchise in 2001, which was subsequently awarded to Arriva UK Trains in December 2003 and operated as Arriva Trains Wales. In October 2018, Transport for Wales took over the franchise from Arriva Trains Wales.\n\nThe December 2005 timetable introduced a further increase in services to 4 trains per hour 18 hours a day, and even a Sunday service for the first time (further improved in June 2006 to offer the same 4 trains per hour service from 11am to 4pm). In December 2005, Arriva employed a single car Class 153 to \"shuttle\" along the Butetown Line, upgrading from the 2 car Class 143 'Pacers' used for the service. Since then, the service frequency has been increased even more – there are now 5 trains per hour on the line every day of the week, which equates to one train every 12 minutes.\n\nIn July 2006 the service was due to be provided by a 1950s \"Bubble car\" DMU. The unit finally entered service on 17 August 2006, only to be withdrawn for repairs two days later.

It was proposed to start between 2014 and 2019.\n\nIn June 2018 it was announced by the new operator Transport for Wales Rail that the line was to be re-integrated into Valley Lines services, with 6 trains per hour to operate from Merthyr Tydfil, Aberdare and Treherbert. New stations will be constructed at Loudoun Square and on a short extension from the current station closer to Cardiff Bay, opening in December 2023. The current Cardiff Bay station will close at the same time. Stadler Citylink tram-trains will replace the Class 153s.

The term was coined by Martin Fowler, Rebecca Parsons and Josh MacKenzie in September 2000:\n\n\"We wondered why people were so against using regular objects in their systems and concluded that it was because simple objects lacked a fancy name. So we gave them one, and it's caught on very nicely.\"\nThe term \"POJO\" initially denoted a Java object which does not follow any of the major Java object models, conventions, or frameworks; nowadays \"POJO\" may be used as an acronym for plain old JavaScript object as well, in which case the term denotes a JavaScript object of similar pedigree.\n\nThe term continues the pattern of older terms for technologies that do not use fancy new features, such as plain old Ruby object (PORO) in Ruby, plain old telephone service (POTS) in telephony and Plain Old Documentation (pod) in Perl. The equivalent to POJO on the .NET framework is plain Old CLR object (POCO). For PHP, it is plain old PHP object (POPO).\n\nThe POJO phenomenon has most likely gained widespread acceptance because of the need for a common and easily understood term that contrasts with complicated object frameworks.\n\nIdeally speaking, a POJO is a Java object not bound by any restriction other than those forced by the Java Language Specification; i.e. a POJO should not have to\nHowever, due to technical difficulties and other reasons, many software products or frameworks described as POJO-compliant actually still require the use of prespecified annotations for features such as persistence to work properly.\nThe idea is that if the object (actually class) were a POJO before any annotations were added, and would return to POJO status if the annotations are removed then it can still be considered a POJO. Then the basic object remains a POJO in that it has no special characteristics (such as an implemented interface) that makes it a \"Specialized Java Object\" (SJO or (sic) SoJO).\n\nA JavaBean is a POJO that is serializable, has a no-argument constructor, and allows access to properties using getter and setter methods that follow a simple naming convention. Because of this convention, simple declarative references can be made to the properties of arbitrary JavaBeans. Code using such a declarative reference does not have to know anything about the type of the bean, and the bean can be used with many frameworks without these frameworks having to know the exact type of the bean.\nThe JavaBeans specification, if fully implemented, slightly breaks the POJO model as the class must implement the Serializable interface to be a true JavaBean. Many POJO classes still called JavaBeans do not meet this requirement. Since Serializable is a marker (method-less) interface, this is not much of a burden.\n\nThe following shows an example of a JavaServer Faces (JSF) component having a bidirectional binding to a POJO's property:\n<h:inputText value=\"#{MyBean.someProperty}\"/>\nThe definition of the POJO can be as follows:\npublic class MyBean {\n\nBecause of the JavaBean naming conventions the single \"someProperty\" reference can be automatically translated to the \"getSomeProperty()\" (or \"isSomeProperty()\" if the property is of Boolean type) method for getting a value, and to the \"setSomeProperty(String)\" method for setting a value.\n\nAs designs using POJOs have become more commonly used, systems have arisen that give POJOs the full functionality used in frameworks and more choice about which areas of functionality are actually needed. In this model, the programmer creates nothing more than a POJO. This POJO purely focuses on business logic and has no dependencies on (enterprise) frameworks. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) frameworks then transparently add cross-cutting concerns like persistence, transactions, security, and so on.\n\nSpring was an early implementation of this idea and one of the driving forces behind popularizing this model.\n\nAn example of an EJB bean being a POJO:\n\n\nThe following shows a fully functional EJB bean, demonstrating how EJB3 leverages the POJO model:\npublic class HelloWorldService {\n\nAs given, the bean does not need to extend any EJB class or implement any EJB interface and also does not need to contain any EJB annotations. Instead, the programmer declares in an external XML file which EJB services should be added to the bean:\n<enterprise-beans>\n</enterprise-beans>\nIn practice, some people find annotations elegant, while they see XML as verbose, ugly and hard to maintain, yet others find annotations pollute the POJO model.\n\nThus, as an alternative to XML, many frameworks (e.g. Spring, EJB and JPA) allow annotations to be used instead of or in addition to XML. The following shows the same EJB bean as showed above but with an annotation added. In this case the XML file is no longer needed:\n@Stateless\npublic class HelloWorldService {\n\nWith the annotation as given above the bean isn't a truly pure POJO anymore, but since annotations are merely passive metadata this has far fewer harmful drawbacks compared to the invasiveness of having to extend classes and/or implement interfaces. Accordingly, the programming model is still very much like the pure POJO model.\n\nA Plain old Java Interface (POJI) is a basic form of Java interface and acceptable at points where more complex Java interfaces are not permitted.\n\n"}
{"id": "2064239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064239", "title": "Battle of Maiwand", "text": "Battle of Maiwand\n\nThe Battle of Maiwand on 27 July 1880 was one of the principal battles of the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Under the leadership of Ayub Khan, the Afghans defeated a much smaller force consisting of two brigades of British and Indian troops under Brigadier-General George Burrows; albeit at a high price: between 2,050 and 2,750 Afghan Pashtun warriors were killed, and probably about 1,500 wounded. British and Indian forces suffered 969 soldiers killed and 177 wounded.\n\nBefore the battle, the campaign had gone well for the British. They had defeated Afghan tribesmen at Ali Masjid, Peiwar Kotal, Kabul, and the Battle of Ahmed Khel, and they had occupied numerous towns and villages, including Kandahar, Dakka, and Jalalabad.\n\nAyub Khan, Sher Ali Khan's younger son, who had been holding Herat during the British operations at Kabul and Kandahar, set out towards Kandahar with a small army in June 1880, and a brigade under Brigadier-General Burrows was detached from Kandahar to oppose him. Burrows' brigade, some 2,500 strong with about 500 British troops including a battery of 9-pounder cannons (), advanced to Helmand, opposite Gereshk, to oppose Ayub Khan, but was there deserted by the levies of Shere Ali, the British-appointed wali of Kandahar. Burrows's troops engaged and defeated the rebellious levies and captured 4 smoothbore 6-pounder guns and 2 smoothbore 12-pounders howitzers (). Burrows then fell back to a position at Kushk-i-Nakhud, halfway to Kandahar where he could intercept Ayub Khan if he headed for either Ghazni or Kandahar. He remained there a week, during which time the captured guns were added to his force with additional gunners drawn from the British infantry.\nOn the afternoon of 26 July information was received that the Afghan force was making for the Maiwand Pass a few miles away (half-dozen km). Burrows decided to move early the following day to break-up the Afghan advance guard. At about 10 am horsemen were seen and engaged, and the brigade started to deploy for battle. Burrows was not aware that it was Ayub's main force. The Afghans numbered 25,000 including Afghan regular troops and five batteries of artillery, including some very modern Armstrong guns. The Afghan guns gradually came into action and a three-hour artillery duel ensued at an opening range of about , during which the British captured smoothbore guns on the left expended their ammunition and withdrew to replenish it. This enabled the Afghans to force the left battalion back. The left flank comprising Indian infantry regiments gave way and rolled in a great wave to the right, the 66th Regiment, as a result of this pressure was swept away by the pressure of the Ghazi attack.\n\nE Battery / B Brigade Royal Horse Artillery (Captain Slade commanding) and a half-company of Bombay Sappers and Miners under Lieutenant Henn (Royal Engineers) stood fast, covering the retreat of the entire British Brigade. E/B RHA kept firing until the last moment, two sections (four guns) limbering up when the Afghans were away, but the third section (Lt Maclaine) was overrun. Maclaine was captured and held as a prisoner in Kandahar, where his body was found at Ayub Khan's tent during the British attack on 1 September, apparently murdered to prevent his liberation. The British guns captured during the action were also recovered at Kandahar.\n\nE/B RHA came into action again some . The Sappers and Miners retreated as the guns withdrew. Henn and 14 of his men afterwards joined some remnants of the 66th Foot and Bombay Grenadiers in a small enclosure at a garden in a place called Khig where a determined last stand was made. Though the Afghans shot them down one by one, they fired steadily until only eleven of their number (two officers and nine other ranks) were left, and the survivors then charged out into the masses of the enemy and perished. Henn is the only officer who has been positively identified in that band and he led the final charge. No Englishman lived to tell the story of the Last Eleven at Maiwand. It was reported to the British later that year by a former officer of Ayub Khan's army, who said that the Afghans had been truly impressed by the bravery of those men. \n\nWord of the disaster reached Kandahar the following day and a relief force was dispatched. This met the retreating force at Kokeran.\n\nThe British were routed, but managed a withdrawal due to their own efforts and the apathy of the Afghans. Of the 2,476 British troops engaged, the British and Indian force lost 21 officers and 948 soldiers killed, and eight officers and 169 men were wounded: the Grenadiers lost 64% of their strength and the 66th lost 62%, including twelve officers, of those present (two companies being detached); the cavalry losses were much smaller. British and Indian regimental casualties (listed by brigade) were:\n\nOne estimate of Afghan casualties is 3,000, reflecting the desperate nature of much of the fighting, although other sources give 1,500 Afghan \"regulars\" and up to 4,000 Ghazis killed, and 1500 seriously wounded.\n\nTwo Victoria Crosses were awarded for acts of valour performed during the battle and during the retreat to Kandahar. Both medals went to members of E/B Battery, RHA. One was awarded to Sergeant Patrick Mullane, for attempting to save the life of a wounded colleague during the withdrawal of their battery from the field; the other went to Gunner James Collis, who during the retreat to Kandahar drew the attention of enemy fire upon himself instead of upon wounded colleagues.\n\nThe battle dampened morale for the British side, but was also partly a disappointment for Ayub Khan, Governor of Herat and commander of the Afghans in this battle, because he had lost so many men to gain a small advantage. Ayub Khan did manage to shut the British up in Kandahar, resulting in General Frederick Roberts's famous relief march from Kabul to Kandahar in August 1880. The resulting Battle of Kandahar on 1 September was a decisive victory for the British.\n\nThe loss of the Queen's Colour and Regimental Colour of the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot at the Battle of Maiwand, following so soon upon the loss of the Colours of the 1st/24th (2nd Warwickshire) Regiment at the Battle of Isandlwana (22 January 1879) during the Anglo-Zulu War, resulted in colours no longer being taken on active service.\n\nRudyard Kipling, who had researched this battle in 1892, included this small yet dramatic poem about the action at Maiwand in his Barrack-Room Ballads collection. \"That Day\" extract:-\n\nThe events of the battle were also commemorated in a poem by Scottish poet William McGonagall: \"The Last Berkshire Eleven.\"\n\nPoems of the victory at Maiwand have passed into Pashtun and Afghan folklore. As Afghan legend would have it, the battle created an unlikely hero in the shape of an Afghan woman called Malalai, who on seeing the Afghan forces falter, used her veil as a standard and encouraged the men by shouting out\n\nShe also spoke the following landay (Pashto Poetry):\n\nThe battle was the subject of several paintings and was covered extensively in the illustrated press. Frank Feller, a Swiss artist domiciled in England painted \"The Last Eleven at Maiwand\" in 1882 depicting a small group of men from the 66th Regiment making a last stand. The events surrounding E/B Battery Royal Horse Artillery were portrayed by Godfrey Douglas Giles, Richard Caton Woodville and Stanley Wood.\n\nA cast iron statue of a lion (the Maiwand Lion) was built by George Blackall Simonds in Reading and unveiled in 1886 to commemorate those who died in battle. A monument was built in the 1950s on the Maiwand Square in Kabul in commemoration of the battle by an Afghan architect Is-matulla Saraj.\n\nA memorial was erected in central London to a remarkable canine survivor of the engagement: Bobbie, the Berkshires' regimental mascot. Bobbie was wounded during the fighting, but was spotted the following day by survivors, making his way back to the fort.\n\nThe fictional Doctor Watson, companion of Sherlock Holmes, was wounded in the Battle of Maiwand (as described in the opening chapter of \"A Study in Scarlet\"). He may have been based upon the 66th regiment's Medical Officer, Surgeon Major Alexander Francis Preston.\n\nThe Battle of Maiwand is also mentioned in Jeffery Deaver's short story \"The Westphalian Ring\". The main character, Peter Goodcastle, had served in the Royal Horse Artillery there and had turned to burglary to avenge the shoddy treatment he had suffered on his return to Britain. In the short story, he was arrested by none other than Dr. Watson, but later managed to escape suspicion by outsmarting Sherlock Holmes, so the two men may have already met earlier.\n\nThe battle has also been documented in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story \"The Summer\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2064249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064249", "title": "Tabula Rasa (video game)", "text": "Tabula Rasa (video game)\n\nRichard Garriott's Tabula Rasa was an MMORPG developed by Destination Games and published by NCsoft, designed in part by some of the creators of \"Ultima Online\" including Richard Garriott. The game was a role-playing video game that blended certain shooter aspects into the combat system. It was officially released to retail on November 2, 2007, with customers that pre-ordered the game allowed access to the live servers from October 30, 2007. The development team released updates, called \"Deployments,\" nearly every month following launch. The game required a monthly subscription.\n\n\"Tabula Rasa\" was about humanity's last stand against a group of aliens called the Bane. The story took place in the near future on two planets, Arieki and Foreas, which were in a state of constant conflict between the AFS (Allied Free Sentients) and the Bane. The term \"tabula rasa\" means \"clean slate\" in Latin, which refers to a fresh start, or starting over.\n\nAccording to the developers, the game included the ability for players to influence the outcome of a war between the player characters and the NPCs.\n\n\"Tabula Rasa\" became free to play on January 10, 2009, and closed on February 28, 2009.\n\n\"Tabula Rasa\" was set in a fictional universe where the humanity has its last stand against a group of aliens called the Bane. The story took place in the near future on two planets, Arieki and Foreas, which were in a state of constant conflict between the AFS (Allied Free Sentients) and the Bane. The term \"tabula rasa\" means \"clean slate\" in Latin, which refers to a fresh start, or starting over.\n\nAccording to the fictional background story in \"Tabula Rasa\", there once was an advanced alien species known as the Eloh. They freely shared their knowledge of how to convert between matter and energy with just the mind, called \"Logos\", to other less advanced races. One of these less advanced races, the Thrax, used this power to wage war against the Eloh, a war which the Eloh won but at a great cost. This led to a great divide in the Eloh. One faction wanted to keep on spreading the knowledge as they had before. The other, called the Neph, sought to control the development of \"lesser races\" to ensure they, the Neph, would always be the superior species. This inner conflict led the Neph faction to leave the Eloh and seek other allies, among them the defeated Thrax; this species along with others joined to form the Bane, which is controlled by the Neph.\n\nAs one of their first acts, they attacked the Eloh world; the surviving Eloh fled and were scattered among the worlds they had previously visited. The Bane attacked Earth sometime in our near future. Humanity was hopelessly outmatched and the majority was completely wiped out. Luckily, the Eloh had left behind some of their technology that had the ability to make wormholes to other worlds. There, humans found other species doing the same thing they had, fighting against the Bane to survive. They banded together to form the Army of the Allied Free Sentients to fight against the Bane.\n\nAccording to information from the game's manual, it's been roughly 5 years since Earth was attacked. It was eventually discovered that Earth had not been destroyed as once thought, but had instead become a massive staging ground for the Bane. From there they strengthened their forces and increased attacks upon the AFS.\n\nThe combat mixed in some aspects from shooters to add some real time action elements to the game. It still was not an outright shooter and featured sticky targeting and dice rolling based on character stats underneath. Stickiness could be adjusted to fit the preference of the player. Some weapons like the shotgun did not use the sticky targeting. In addition to a hit-miss system, Tabula Rasa adjusted the damage based on the situation. Real-time factors like weapon type, ammo type, stance, cover, and movement were taken into account. The enemies were reported to have AI that would try to take advantage of the terrain, their numbers, and would try to flank the players. The mix of system based combat and real-time movement and physics systems created a gameplay meant to encourage the player to think tactically}; e.g. to take cover behind a pillar to get some time to reload the weapon while the enemies were getting into position again.\n\nMissions will be given out by NPCs but will not be static. What missions are available and even the access to the NPCs themselves are subject to how the battlefield is going. Some may be specific to control points that the player will need to reclaim from the Bane to gain access again. \nMissions are also to have multiple options to take. One example is destroying a dam to stop Bane forces that will also demolish a local village. A player can choose to just destroy or try to warn the village beforehand risking further advances by the Bane. Referred to as \"ethical parables\" they are to make up about 20% of all missions. The missions the player chooses to do and the choices made during them will change the way certain NPCs treat the player's character.\nSome missions will deliver the player's character to private instanced spaces. One design goal of the game is to use instanced spaces to create in-depth storytelling, with puzzles, traps, and NPCs, that would be more difficult in shared spaces.\nSome missions will be ethically challenging. The players will have to choose from different points of view and it can alter their future progress. \"\"Ethical and moral dilemmas are something we definitely wanted to incorporate into the design of Tabula Rasa from the very start. The entire goal is to give you pause and allow you to think about the choices that they make in order to accomplish a mission.\"\"\nLogos is a pictographic language left behind by the Eloh to be understood by other races. As players go through the game, they will gain Logos symbols to add to their Logos tablet, a blank slate, and begin to learn the language found throughout the game and gain special powers. Logos can be considered the equivalent of magic for Tabula Rasa, inasmuch as magic allows for incredible, otherwise unexplained acts; however, the logos are shown to be an extension of a scientific process developed by the Eloh. Players can improve these abilities and the upgraded versions can add new tactical uses. Some are universal while others are class specific. Some examples range from lightning bolt attacks, sprinting, reinforcements, and poison type powers. These are very hard to find, being hidden throughout Tabula Rasa.\n\nTabula Rasa had a tree character class system. Everyone started out as first \"tier\" (branch) Recruit and as they progress they were able to branch out. The second \"tier\" included the Soldier and Specialist, which in turn had two subclasses of their own each. There were a total of 4 tiers.\n\nTabula Rasa also had a cloning function at each tier. It worked like a save function for characters at the branching point and allowed the player to try out the other branch without having to repeat the first several levels.\n\nIntroduced in patch 1.4.6 were the hybrid characters. These were humans who have had their DNA blended with either Thrax, Forean or Brann DNA to produce different stats and bonuses to the character. Only full humans were available at the beginning, with the hybrid DNA becoming available via quest chains during play which in turn unlocked the ability to create hybrids on that server at the creation screen, or via cloning.\n\nAFS and Bane forces are in constant battle with NPC forces warring over control points and bases. Which side controls these areas greatly impacts the players. Losing one of these to the Bane means that the respawn hospital, waypoints, shops, NPCs access, and base defenses are lost and turned to the Bane's advantage. Players were able to help NPC assaults to take over bases or defend ones under attack. Control of these points was meant to change back and forth commonly even without player involvement, although the current implementation rarely let the Bane muster enough forces to invade a control point during peak player times. The Control Point System was one of the main gameplay features. Players that are fighting to defend or capture a CP (control point) got Prestige points which they could trade in for item-upgrades, experience boosters, a reset of either their attributes or their learned abilities or the purchase of superior or rare equipment at grey market vendors. Prestige could also be earned by defeating bosses, looting rare items, getting the max XP multiplier and by completing special missions. Later in the game, Control points became more and more important to the players, as they were necessary to be either in Bane or AFS hands to accept or complete certain missions and they become the centerpoint of most of the later maps.\n\nPvP (Player versus player) in Tabula Rasa was voluntary. As it stands, there were two main modes of PvP combat.\n\nIn the works since May 2001, the game underwent a major revamp two years into the project. Conflicts between developers and the vague direction of the game were said to be the causes of this dramatic change. Twenty percent of the original team was replaced, and 75% of the code had to be redone. Some staff working on other NCsoft projects were transferred to the \"Tabula Rasa\" development team, including \"City of Heroes\"' Community Coordinator April \"CuppaJo\" Burba. First re-shown at E3 2005, the game then transformed into the current science fiction setting and look.\n\nNCsoft began offering invitations to sign up for a limited beta test of \"Tabula Rasa\" on January 5, 2007 which began running on May 2, 2007. Invitations were initially given out only as contest prizes, but beginning on August 8 several thousand additional invitations were distributed via the websites FilePlanet and Eurogamer. The non-disclosure agreement for the beta test was lifted on September 5, 2007 and the test ended on October 26, 2007 with a themed event in which players were invited to attempt to kill the character General British, played by game creator Richard Garriott.\n\nTwo pre-order bonus packs were available on NCsoft's PlayNC website, one for Europe and one for the United States. The European pack is sold for EUR4.99, the US pack for USD4.99 in addition to buying the full retail version of the game for $49.99. Other than currency and which pack goes with which retail version (the European preorder will only be valid with the European release of the game, similarly for the US version), the packs are functionally identical, containing:\n\n\nFor the retail release, a standard version and a collector's edition were released. Both contain the client and an account key with 30 days of included playtime, however the Collector's edition shipped with a number of bonus items including:\n\n\nTabula Rasa was officially released to retail on November 2, 2007, with customers that pre-ordered the game allowed access to the live servers from October 30, 2007. The development team released updates, called \"Deployments,\" nearly every month following launch.\n\nOn Nov 11th 2008, an open letter to the players of Tabula Rasa stated that Richard Garriott had left NCsoft to pursue other ventures.\nThe announcement that he was leaving NCAustin and Tabula Rasa was done in an open letter to the community, though he later claimed this letter was in fact written by NCsoft as a means of forcing him out. The announcement was made while Garriott was in quarantine after returning from his spaceflight in October, and the announcement claimed he was inspired by the space travel experience to pursue other interests.\n\nOn 21 November 2008, weeks after Richard's announcement, \"Tabula Rasa\"'s development team also released an open letter indicating that the game would end public service on 28 February 2009, citing a lower than expected in-game population as the major factor for the decision. Developers also announced that any active paying player as of 10:00 AM Pacific Time on November 21, 2008 will be eligible for some rewards, including paid time on other NCsoft titles (any paying subscribers joining after that point are ineligible). On Dec 9th 2008, a letter was sent by NCsoft stating that all Tabula Rasa servers would be shut down on February 28, 2009, and that Tabula Rasa would be discontinued. The servers became free to play on January 10, 2009. On February 27, 2009, a message posted on the official website requested that players participate in a final assault, culminating with mutual destruction of AFS and Bane forces.\n\nRichard Garriott sued NCsoft for $24 million for damages relative to his termination from the parent company NCsoft. Garriott's allegation states that NC Soft terminated his employment, then fraudulently reported his termination as willful resignation in order to preserve the right to terminate Garriot's stock options unless he exercised them himself within 90 days of termination, forcing Garriott into a decision to purchase stock with which a loss was incurred worth dozens of millions in profit for Garriott. Additionally, the news of the termination was issued while Garriott was confined to quarantine from the space flight, which was originally intended to be a publicity move to further promote the game and increase revenue. In July 2010, an Austin District Court awarded Garriott US$28 million in his lawsuit against NCsoft, finding that the company did not appropriately handle his departure in 2008. NCsoft stated that it intended to appeal the decision. In October 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment.\n\nPublications started to release reviews mainly after 15 November 2007, 2 weeks after the game's launch, although over a dozen wrote previews based on betas and the 3-day head start for those who pre-ordered.\n\nGameSpy gave the game 4 stars out of 5, outlining that the game's innovative combat system succeeded in redefining MMO combat, and regarded it as one of the most appealing features. Negatives were the obscure and often counterproductive crafting system, a lack of a central trading hub at the initial release and bugs involving general gameplay and reports of memory leaks.\n\nEurogamer gave the game 8 out of 10, praising the daring-to-be-different approach to combat and to the class/cloning system, allowing players the opportunity for experimenting easily with which career path they choose. On the negative side, the crafting system and lack of an auction house were singled out. Though technical problems were also mentioned, the review notes that a recent patch corrected many of the problems they experienced with the game in that regards.\n"}

The Fu-Schnickens' popularity was brief but significant in hip hop history. Their best-known track is 1993's \"What's up, Doc? (Can We Rock)\", which featured basketball star Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nFu-Schnickens was composed of Chip Fu (Roderick Roachford), Moc Fu (Joe Jones), and Poc Fu (Lennox Maturine). \"Fu\" stood for unity and \"schnicken\" was a made-up word that meant coalition. The three friends from East Flatbush, Brooklyn, first gained attention after performing at a hip hop event at Howard University, after which the group was signed by Jive Records. The group's debut single, \"Ring the Alarm,\" hit the top ten on the \"Billboard\" Hot Rap Tracks chart in 1992, which sparked anticipation for the group's debut album, \"F.U. Don't Take It Personal\", and also inadvertently immortalized and ignited a new-found popularity for the original \"Ring the Alarm,\" the signature tune of dancehall reggae singjay Tenor Saw from 1985, which the group sampled to create its track of the same name. Furthermore, with the hit singles \"La Schmoove\" (featuring Phife Dawg of A Tribe Called Quest) and \"True Fu-Schnick,\" the album reached the top 20 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and was certified for gold-level sales by the RIAA.\n\nIn 1993, Fu-Schnickens began work on its second album. The group recorded a fast-paced song called \"What's Up, Doc?\" which featured a sample of Bugs Bunny saying his famous catchphrase. But the group could not get sample clearance from Warner Bros. so the song was shelved. Meanwhile, the then-rookie NBA star Shaquille O'Neal was a media sensation. In many interviews, he talked about his love of hip hop music and stated that the Fu-Schnickens were his favorite hip hop group. This prompted the group to contact O'Neal for a collaboration. O'Neal recorded a verse that was added on to the already-recorded \"What's Up, Doc?\" with the group and O'Neal saying \"What's up, doc?\" to replace the Bugs Bunny sample. Although the group had not yet completed work on its album, the song was quickly released as a single to capitalize on O'Neal's popularity. The single was a top-40 hit in the summer of 1993, which briefly propelled the group into the mainstream. The group's second album, \"Nervous Breakdown\", did not arrive until 1994.\n\nThe group took part in a huge performance on the finale of \"The Arsenio Hall Show\", alongside the likes of KRS-One, Wu-Tang Clan, Naughty by Nature, MC Lyte, Guru, Mad Lion, Yo-Yo, Das EFX, CL Smooth, and A Tribe Called Quest.\n\nFu-Schnickens is also notable for its many references to martial arts films and Asian culture before Wu-Tang Clan, which eventually helped make such references popular in hip hop music.\n\n(Note: \"Greatest Hits\" included four previously unreleased songs: \"Cray-Z,\" \"Original Rude Boy,\" \"Voice of the Ghetto,\" and \"Bring It Back\")\"\n\n"}

It is situated in the northern part of Bangladesh and under Rangpur Division. At first it was a mahakuma and then established as a district in 1984.\n\nThe name \"Kurigram\" is derived from two words \"Kuri\" and \"Gram\". \"Gram\" means village. The word \"Kuri\" is non-aryan language. It is a counting terminology which means twenty. Scholar Ja Paliluski has proved that the word has come from Kole language. Kole is a language of Austric language group. In Arab-Austric language \"kur\" or \"kor\" means people. The counting system as Kuri has come from this Arab-Austric language.\n\nCivilization of this area was built by the combination of the Nigro-Austric and Dravid-Mongolian people which is unanimously recognised as the old Aryan civilization. Sometimes this area was included in Gaurabardhan, sometimes in Pragjotishpur. Gaurabardhan is today's Mahasthangarh, Pragjotishpur is the old name of Kamrup which is today's Assam. This two kingdom was inhabited by non-aryans. No Aryan was able to enter this area due to the defence of non-aryans. As a result, there is no sign of Aryan civilization here. The Kamrup kingdom was divided into many small kingdoms creating Cooch Behar, Uari, Ahom, Kooki, Tripura and Arakan kingdom. The northern side of this town (Nageshwari. Phulbari, Lalmonirhat and Bhurungamari) was included in Cooch Behar and the southern part (Ulipur, Chilmari and Raomari) was in Uari kingdom.\n\nIn the beginning of twelfth century, Khen dynasty was emerged in this area. Nildhwaj, Chakradhwaj and Nilambor were the kings of this dynasty. The capital of their kingdom was in Chatra which is situated in today's Bidyananda union of Ulipur upazila. In 1418, Sultan of Gouro, Hosen Shah attacked Nilambar. Nilambar was lost in the battle and then the area was controlled by the Muslims which was later controlled by the Mughal Empire.\n\nDuring the British regime, broker of East India Company, Debi Singh and Hare Ram came to the area as dewan (controller). The torture and mistreatment of the East India Company caused the Great Bengal famine of 1770. As a result, many rebellion were created which were led by Majnu Shah, Nuruddin Karek Jong, Bhabani Pathak, Debi Choudhurani, Musa Shah, Cherag Ali Shah and many more. In the regime of East India Company, Kurigram was divided into four divisions which were Borobari, Ulipur, Chimari and Nageshwari. At that time \"Kuriganj\" was a place of Borobari division, Balabari was the central point of Kuriganj. The British government first established Kurigram mahakuma in 22 April 1875. Sir william Hunter described Kurigram as \"Kuriganj\" in his \"Gazetteer of Rangpur District\". The Kurigram mahakuma was consisted of 8 thanas named Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Ulipur, Chilmari, Roumari, Nageshwar, Bhurungamari and Phulbari. It was established as a district on 1 February 1984 consisting of 9 current upazilas.\n\nKurigram District is located in the northern region of Bangladesh along the border of India. The population is 2,069,273 (2011 national population census). This district is surrounded by Cooch Behar district of India in the north, Gaibandha district of Bangladesh in the south, Assam state of India in the east and, Lalmonirhat and Rangpur districts of Bangladesh in the west. There are 9 upazilas and 72 unions and 1872 villages in Kurigram. Weather of the Kurigram district is bit different from the middle or southern part of Bangladesh. During summer, temperature is higher and during winter is lower than middle or southern part of Bangladesh. The average maximum temperature is about 32-33 degree Celsius when average minimum temperature is about 10-11 degrees. Heavy rainfall is usually observed during the rainy season like other parts of Bangladesh and the average annual rainfall is about 3000 mm. Several rivers are flowing through the heart of this district. The major rivers are Brahmaputra, Dharla, and Tista with minors are Dudhkumar, Phulkumar, Gangadhar, Jinjiram etc. Three northern subdistricts (namely thana or upazila) of this district (Nageshwari, Bhurungamari, and Phulbari) are recently connected by a beautiful bridge over the Dharla river with the main land of the district. postal code is 5600. It has 278.28 km of international border line.There are 16 rivers in this district. Bramhaputra, Dharla, Tista, Dudhkumar, Fulkumar, Sonabhari, Gingira, Gangadhar, Halhalia are some of its main rivers. In addition to this, there are many minor rivers such as Nilkamal, Shialdaha, Kaljani, Jalchira, Shangkosh, Boalmari, Dharani etc.\n\nKurigram District consists of nine upazilas:\n\"Sadar\" (HQ) is a Bengali word and its meaning is, a main part of a certain area. Kurigram Sadar (HQ) is the main part of Kurigram district and it is located almost in the center of the district, on the bank of Dharala river. The total area of this main sub-district is 276.45 km and the total population is 217,311 (1991 national population census).\n\nOther sub-districts are also conveniently connected with Kurigram Sadar (HQ) by bus and train service. The only sub-district Char Rajibpur is still isolated from the main land of this district by Brahmaputra river. Kurigram Sadar (HQ) is connected with capital city (Dhaka) and other major districts of Bangladesh by highways.\n\nNageshwari subdistrict is one of three northern sub-districts of Kurigram district. It is the located about 22 km far away from the main city of Kurigram and conveniently connected by buses over the recently constructed Dharla bridge. The total area of this sub-district is 415.80 km and total population is 279,775 (1991 national population census). It is the biggest sub-district among the three northern sub-districts of Kurigram and nicely located with the status of city corporation namely \"Pourosova\".\n\nNageshwari Upazila (Kurigram district) with an area of 415.80 km, is bounded by Bhurungamari upazila and West Bengal of India on the north, Kurigram sadar upazila on the south, Assam State of India on the east and Phulbari upazila (Kurigram) on the west. Main rivers are Brahmaputra, Dudhkumar, Nilkamal, Shankos and Phulkumar; depressions: 54, most noted of which are Payradanga, Teparkuthi, Naodanga and Madaikhal.\n\nNageshwari is located at 25.9792°N 89.7083°E. It has 51,889 units of house hold. Nageshwari (Town) consists of 8 mouzas. It has an area of 35.2 km. The town has a population of 39731; male 52.02% and female 47.98%; population density per km 1129. Literacy rate among the town people is 28.1%. The town has two dak bungalows.\n\nNageshwari Thana was established in 1793 and was turned into an upazila in 1983. The upazila consists of 15 union parishads, 79 mouzas and 367 villages.\n\nAs of the 1991 Bangladesh census, Population 279,775; male 50.72%, female 49.28%; Muslim 93.53%, Hindu 6.19% and others 0.28%; ethnic nationals: Buno, a tribe of Santal live on the bank of the river Naodanga.\n\nIt is most northern sub-district of Kurigram district. The total area of this district is about 236 km and the total population is 176,822 (1991 national population census). This subdistrict is easily connected with another 2 northern sub-districts and the main part of Kurigram through Nageshwari subdistrict. If you visit the India-Bangladesh border closely located with these sub-districts, you will see the inter country security iron-wire-fences (namely Katatar) between the border of Bangladesh and India. You will also find the \"Border Security Force (BSF)\" in the part of India and \"Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB)\" in the part of Bangladesh, who are working as a security forces in their respective sites. Kuchbihar is the nearest Indian district from Bhurungamari.\n\nPhulbari is one of the three northern sub-districts of Kurigram district. The total area of this subdistrict is 163.63 km and the total number of populations is 129,668 (1991 national population census). It is also closely located in the Indian border of Kuchbihar district and separated by fence from India. Because of it geographical location, it is very close to Kurigram main city but isolated by Dharla river. As Dharla bridge is closely located with the Nageswari district so if some would like to visit Phulbari by using Dharla bridge it will be far away from Kurigram. The most convenient to visit Phulbari by crossing the Dharla river by using very convenient boat or ferry from Kathalbari ferry port, a part of Kurigram main land. Therefore, most of the peoples use this port, rather than Dharla bridge, to visit Phulbari for business and tourism. In addition to these, Phulbari is also closely located with the Lalmonirhat, another northern district of Bangladesh. Therefore, peoples from Phulbari can easily go to the main city of both districts for business purpose and can keep their communication with big cities. Although the most of the peoples are dependent on agriculture for their living but many of them are dependent on business. There are most of the main bazaars: Kharibary, Balarhat, Pakir Hat, Newashi Bazar, Khochabari Bazar, Kholar Hat, Boroloi Bazar, Baravita, Gongarhat, and Phulbari.\n\nIt is the closest and only western subdistrict of Kurigram. The bus and train are conveniently connected with the main town of Rajarhat from the main city of Kurigram. The total area of this subdistrict is 166.23 km and the total population is 158,648 (1991 national population census). Because of its closest location and dual transportation systems from the main city of Kurigram, this town has been developed as a business center and many peoples of this subdistrict are depending on business for their living. However, most of the peoples of this subdistrict are dependent on agriculture for their living.\n\nUlipur is one of the four southern sub-districts of Kurigram and is also conveniently connected with the main city of Kurigram by road and rail transport systems. This is the most closest south subdistrict of Kurigram with Kurigram main city. The total area of this subdistrict is 504.19 km and the total population is 345,205 (1991 national population census). Ulipur town is also conveniently connected with Rajarhar subdistrict by road transport system. The road and rail transport systems from Kurigram main city to Ulipur have further extended to Chilmari, another southern subdistrict of Kurigram. It is the biggest sub-district among all sub-districts of Kurigram and nicely located with the status of city corporation namely \"Pourosova\".there is a health complex, a govt girls high school, a govt college in Ulipur.Ulipur Government and also public college are very beautiful.\n\nChilmari is geographically located in a beautiful scenic bank of the Tista and Jamuna rivers. Jamuna is one of the widest and famous of the first three rivers of Bangladesh. Because of this, such geographical location and convenient and dual transport systems from the main city of Kurigram, Chilmari has been developed and most important commercial and river port town of Kurigram district. The total area of this subdistrict is 224.97 km and the total population count is 100,516 (1991 national population census). As it is adjacently located in the banks of two important rivers of Bangladesh so many peoples of this district are dependent on fishing, agriculture and business for their living. However, the main profession of most of the peoples are agriculture like most other districts of Bangladesh.\n\nRowmari is the first independent sub-district of Bangladesh. It has a great contribution in Bangladesh's Independence War, 1971. The Pakistani invading force could never capture Rowmari and there was an independent local government since the first day of independence under the leadership of the then Major Ziaur Rahman and Squadron Leader M. Hamidullah Khan who were based in this regional headquarters of Bangladesh Forces during June to December, 1971.\n\nIt is geographically located in the eastern side of Chilmari and south-eastern part of Kurigram Sadar and on the bank of local Jinjiram river. However, this subdistrict is isolated from the main land of Kurigram by Jamuna river. The total area of this subdistrict is 197.80 km and the total number of population is 137,040 (1991 national population census). Only water-based transport system is connected this island subdistrict with the main land of Kurigram. However, this subdistrict is very close to Dhaka division of Bangladesh. Now only for Government purposes people go to Kurigram and Good Communication establist from Dhaka to Rajibpur, Rowmari (only 4/5 hours).\n\nChar is a Bengali word and it means \"island\". So, Char Rajibpur is an island subdistrict of Kurigram and located in the most southern part and on the bank of Jamuna river. The total area of this subdistrict is 111.03 km and the total number of population is 58,049 (1991 national population census). Because of its geographical location and smallest size, very few people live here. Only water-based transport system are connected to this island subdistrict with the main land of Kurigram. However, this subdistrict is very close to Jamalpur, another district under Dhaka division of Bangladesh. Now only for Government purposes people go to Kurigram and Good Communication establist from Dhaka to Rajibpur, Rowmari (only 4 hours)\n\nTherefore, Char Rajibpur is the most closest subdistrict of Kurigram with Dhaka, so people are wanted to go Jamalpur under Dhaka division. Now BDR communication existing with Jamalpur and Settlement Office of GOB (Rajibpur) serve to north side of Jamalpur(Shandabari, CharAmkhowa, Dhangdhara).\n\nChar Rajibpur and Rowmari subdistrict of Kurigram should be include into Jamalpur District or can be a new district include Rajibpur, Rowmari and North side of Jamalpur and Division under Dhaka.\n\nThis Subdistricts of Kurigram are important communication place of Dhaka to north Bangle without Jamuna Bridge. This way consume time 2 hours.\n\nMost people speak Bengali in Rangpurian tone but understand the formal Bengali. People from town can speak in proper Bengali when many people can speak in English as well. English is known better in the city than in the village areas.\n\nFrom the ancient time, Kurigram has been a land of agriculture. The major economic products are Rice, jute (called the golden fiber of Bangladesh), wheat, tobacco, potato etc. During winter season, when ground water level is usually lower than rainy season, peoples use irrigation system to cultivate several high yielding varieties of rice. Several cold storage are also adding value to the economy of this district by preserving agricultural products especially potato during the hot summer season.\n\nRice and vegetable, meat and fish curries are the common foods of this district like other parts of Bangladesh. Various kinds of fresh water fish are widely available in the district. These fishes are usually collected from the several rivers flowing through the heart of the district. \"Korti\", a white-wide-thin small fish with multiple number of bones are vary popular in this district, like \"Ilish\" (\"Hilsha ilisha\") in the every parts of Bangladesh. In addition to this, peoples usually celebrate the various seasons with various kinds of foods. In winter for example, you can enjoy the sweet juice of a date tree.\n\nThere are four levels education system in this district like other parts of Bangladesh. These levels are: (1) Primary – 5 years [Grade 1–5] (2) Secondary – 5 years [Grade 6–10] (3) Higher Secondary – 2 years [Grade 11–12] and (4) Tertiary or University Education – 5 years [Undergraduate 4 years and Masters 1 year]. There are 43 colleges, 257 high schools, 563 registered government and 552 non-registered primary schools, 224 madrasa, 1 polytechnical institute and 1 technical school and college in this district. Besides Bengali, the native language, English is compulsory at all levels of education. There are lot of primary and secondary schools, and higher secondary college are available in the every part of the district. In addition to this, some kindergarten school and elementary level English schools are mainly available in the main district city and sub-districts towns.\n\nThere are 1 government and two non government hospital and an eye hospital in Kurigram. The district has 100% EPI coverage, 96% sanitation coverage and 96% pure drinking water coverage. There are also 8 upazila health complex, a maternity clinic and a tuberculosis clinic in this district.\n\nBus is the cheapest and major transport system of this district for long distance travel. Rail is also conveniently connected with one western (Rajarhat) and two southern sub-districts (Ulipur and Chilmari) of Kurigram. In addition to these, peoples of some other sub-districts e.g. Rowmari, Char Rajibpur, and Phulbari usually use boat and ferries to come into the main land of the district by crossing their nearest rivers. Rickshaw is the most convenient and cheaper, but slower, transport system will be seen all over the district. It is one kind of tricycle, driven by one human being, and can easily carry two persons at a time. Inter district and inter subdistrict buses are frequently depart from the Kurigram bus terminal located in the western part of the city. Train is also well connected with nearest districts e.g. Lalmonirhat, Rangpur but the frequency is quite lower than buses.\n\nPleasant climate exist year long except some heavy rain during the rainy season (June–September). Although there are some heavy rainfalls during the rainy season, water often drain quickly due to its slightly higher elevation(33m above sea level). Summer and rainy(monsoon) season are quite hot (mostly 30–35 °C). Winter often gets pretty cold compared to other parts of Bangladesh due to geographical and climatic factors of the Varendra tract. In winter (October–February) minimum temperature is not less than 2 °C and some days are foggy and sun cannot be seen until mid-day during that days.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2064265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064265", "title": "Descriptive poetry", "text": "Descriptive poetry\n\nDescriptive poetry is the name given to a class of literature that belongs mainly to the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries in Europe. From the earliest times, all poetry not subjectively lyrical was apt to indulge in ornament which might be named descriptive. But the critics of the 17th century formed a distinction between the representations of the ancients and those of the moderns. Boileau stated that, while Virgil \"paints\", Tasso \"describes\". This may be a useful indication in defining not what should, but what in practice has been called descriptive poetry.\n\nIt will be obvious this definition that the danger ahead of all purely descriptive poetry is that it will lack intensity, that it will be frigid if not dead. Description for description's sake, especially in studied verse, is rarely a vitalized form of literature. It is threatened, from its very conception, with languor and coldness. Therefore, it must exercise an extreme art or be condemned to immediate sterility. Boileau, with his customary intelligence, was the first to see this, and he thought that the danger might be avoided by care in technical execution. His advice to the poets of his time was:\n\nand:\n\nIn England the famous translation (1592–1611) by Joshua Sylvester of the Divine Weeks and Works of Du Bartas, containing such lines as those that the juvenile Dryden admired so much:\n\nThere was also the curious physiological epic of Phineas Fletcher, \"The Purple Island\" (1633). But on the whole, it was not until French influences had made themselves felt on English poetry that description, as Boileau conceived it, was cultivated as a distinct art. The \"Coopers Hill\" (1642) by Sir John Denham may be contrasted with the less ambitious \"To Penshurst\" of Ben Jonson and this one represents the new no less completely than the other does the old generation. If, however, \"Coopers Hill\" is examined carefully, it is perceived that its aim is after all rather philosophical than topographical. The Thames is described indeed, but not very minutely and the poet is mainly absorbed in moral reflections.\n\nMarvell's long poem on the beauties of Nunappleton, Upon Appleton House, comes nearer to the type. But it is hardly until the 18th century that in English literature appears what is properly known as descriptive poetry. This was the age in which poets, often of no mean capacity, began to take such definite themes as a small country estate (\"Pomfrets Choice\", 1700), the cultivation of the grape (\"Gays Wine\", 1708), a landscape (\"Popes Windsor Forest\", 1713), a military manoeuvre (\"Addisons Campaign\", 1704), the industry of an apple orchard (\"Philips Cyder\", 1708) or a piece of topography (\"Tickells Kensington Gardens\", 1722) as the sole subject of a lengthy poem, generally written in heroic or blank verse. These tours de force were supported by minute efforts in miniature-painting, by touch applied to touch and were often monuments of industry, but they were apt to lack personal interest and suffered from a general and deplorable frigidity. They were infected with the faults that accompany an artificial style. They were monotonous, rhetorical, and symmetrical, while the uniformity of treatment inevitable to their plan rendered them hopelessly tedious if prolonged to any great extent.\n\nThis species of writing had been cultivated to a considerable degree through the preceding century, in Italy and (as the remarks of Boileau testify) in France, but it was in England that it reached its highest importance. The classic of descriptive poetry, in fact, the specimen that the literature of the world presents that must be considered as the most important and the most successful, is \"The Seasons\" (1726–1730) of James Thomson.\n\nFor the first time, a poet of considerable eminence appeared, to whom external nature was all sufficient and who succeeded in conducting a long poem to its close by a single appeal to landscape and to the emotions it directly evokes. Coleridge, somewhat severely, described The Seasons as the work of a good rather than of a great poet and it is an indisputable fact that, at its very best, descriptive poetry fails to awaken the highest powers of the imagination. A great part of Thomson's poem is nothing more nor less than a skillfully varied catalogue of natural phenomena. The famous description of twilight in the fading many-colored woods of autumn may be taken as an example of the highest art to which purely descriptive poetry has ever attained. It is obvious even here that the effect of these rich and sonorous lines, in spite of the splendid effort of the artist, is monotonous and leads up to no final crisis of passion or rapture. Yet Thomson succeeds, as few other poets of his class have succeeded, in producing nobly-massed effects and comprehensive beauties such as were utterly unknown to his predecessors.\n\nHe was widely imitated in England, especially by Armstrong, Akenside, Shenstone (in \"The Schoolmistress\", 1742), by the anonymous author of Albania, 1737 and by Oliver Goldsmith (in \"The Deserted Village\", 1770). No better example of the more pedestrian class of descriptive poetry could be found than the last-mentioned poem with its minute and Dutch-like painting.\n\nOn the continent of Europe the example of Thomson was almost immediately fruitful. Four several translations of \"The Seasons\" into French contended for the suffrages of the public. Jean François de Saint-Lambert (1716–1803) imitated Thomson in \"Les Saisons\" (1769), a poem that enjoyed popularity for half a century, and of which Voltaire said that it was the only one of its generation that would reach posterity. Nevertheless, as Madame du Deffand told Walpole, Saint-Lambert is \"froid, fade et faux\" and the same may be said of Jean-Antoine Roucher (1745–1794) who wrote \"Les Mois\" in 1779, a descriptive poem famous in its day.\n\nThe Abbé Jacques Delille (1738–1813), perhaps the most ambitious descriptive poet who has ever lived, was treated as a Virgil by his contemporaries. He published \"Les Géorgiques\" in 1769, \"Les Jardins\" in 1782 and \"L' Homme des champs\" in 1803, but he went furthest in his brilliant, though artificial \"Trois règnes de la nature\" (1809), which French critics have called the masterpiece of this whole school of descriptive poetry. Delille, however, like Thomson before him, was unable to avoid monotony and want of coherency. Picture follows picture and no progress is made. The satire of Marie Joseph Chénier in his famous and witty \"Discours sur les poèmes descriptifs\", brought the vogue of this species of poetry to an end.\n\nIn England, again, Wordsworth, who treated the genius of Thomson with unmerited severity, revived descriptive poetry in a form that owed more than Wordsworth realized to the model of \"The Seasons\". In \"The Excursion\" and \"The Prelude\", as well as in many of his minor pieces, Wordsworth's philosophical and moral intentions cannot prevent the reader from perceiving the large part that pure description takes. The same may be said of much of the early blank verse of Coleridge.\n\nSince their day, however, purely descriptive poetry has gone more and more completely out of fashion and its place has been taken by the richer and more direct effects of such prose as that of John Ruskin in English or of Fromentin and Pierre Loti in French. It is almost impossible in descriptive verse to obtain those vivid and impassioned appeals to the imagination that form the essence of genuine poetry, and it is unlikely that descriptive poetry, as such, will retake a prominent place in living literature.\n"}

It was the site of one of the most important battles of the ancient world, the battle of Qarqar, fought in 853 BC when the army of Assyria, led by king Shalmaneser III, encountered an allied force comprising military units from 11 local kingdoms. The leaders of this ad hoc alliance were Hadadezer (Ben Hadad) of Damascus and King Ahab of Israel. Shalmaneser's Assyrian forces had been victorious over Iruleni, the King of Hamath. However, a coalition of Phoenicians and Syrians with Israel and the Kedarite Arabs was waiting for Shalmaneser when he advanced south, leading to a second battle at Qarqar itself.\n\nThe best historical source regarding the battle and the town of Qarqar is The Kurkh Monolith, erected by Shalmaneser. The text lists the kings he fought, the number of soldiers and chariots each of these kings supplied, and describes the battle itself. The monolith states that Shalmaneser fought an alliance of 12 kings, but lists only 11. Numerous other scribal errors have been noted on the monolith.\n\nThe ancient town of Qarqar has generally been associated with the archaeological site of Tell Qarqur, located in the Orontes River Valley of western Syria, on the west bank of the Orontes River, one kilometer west of the modern village of Qarqur on the east bank. This has been the site of an ongoing, American Schools of Oriental Research sponsored excavation since 1993. To date, the excavations have unearthed materials dating to many periods of the site's long occupational history, including structures dating to the general period of the Battle of Qarqar, including impressive defences in the Iron Age city.\n\nFrom 2014 until September 2017, the terrorist Turkistan Islamic Party, an Alqaeda offshoot, destroyed the site. Reports emerged that the destruction, which can be viewed through satellite imagery, was done under the supervision of unidentified civilians who were not Syrian nor members of the Turkistan Islamic Party militants. \n\n"}

He was the son of Peter I of Cyprus and Eleanor of Aragon. He succeeded to the throne while he was still underage, following the assassination of his father in 1369. He was also titular Count of Tripoli and King of Jerusalem.\n\nHe was married by proxy in Milan on 2 April 1376, and in person at Santa Sophia, Nicosia, in July or August 1378. His wife was Valenza or Valentina Visconti (Milan, 1360/1362 – in Italy, ca. 1393 before September, 1393), a daughter of Bernabò Visconti, co-lord of Milan, and his wife Beatrice della Scala. Peter II had one daughter by Valentina in 1379 or 1380, but the child died as an infant in Nicosia sometime not long before 3 October 1382 and was buried at St. Dominic's, Nicosia. After Peter's death, Valentina remarried in 1383; her new husband was Galeazzo, Conte di Virtú.\n\nBefore Peter's marriage had been arranged, it had been suggested that he marry a daughter of the Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos. The suggestion was rejected for political and perhaps religious reasons; Roman Catholics did not approve of the idea of Peter marrying a Greek princess. The explanation given the Palaiologos messengers was that the king was too busy with the dangers that threatened Cyprus because of the Genoese invasion of the island to consider remarriage at the time.\n\nPeter II, who had no surviving children, was succeeded not by his surviving sister Marie, called Mariette, nor by their oldest uncle John of Lusignan, who had been murdered in 1375, but by his younger uncle, who became James I of Cyprus.\n\nThe period of his reign was characterised by decline in the condition of the kingdom of Cyprus, in marked contrast to his father's relatively successful reign. He lost his father's Cypriot possessions in Asia Minor. Even worse, Cyprus was invaded, disastrously, by the Genoese in 1373–4. This led to the capture of Famagusta, the most important harbour town, which thereafter began to decline. There were also major changes in the condition of other major towns of Cyprus as a result of the war with the Genoese.\n\nPeter II was declared King of Cyprus after his father's murder in January 1369; however, at fifteen, he was still a minor, so his uncle John of Lusignan, Prince of Antioch ruled the Kingdom as regent until Peter came of age. John's appointment as regent provoked strong opposition, especially from queen Eleanor, who believed that he had been involved in her husband's murder. Vowing revenge, Eleanor secretly sent messages to European powers asking for military aid to punish those whom she believed to be Peter I's murderers. The Genoese responded positively, seeing it as a chance to gain power in the politics of Cyprus and possibly even seize control of the island kingdom. Eleanor invited them to invade the island in exchange for her vengeance.\n\nOn 6 January, 1372, Peter II was crowned in Nicosia at the Cathedral of St. Sophia as King of Cyprus, and on 10 October at the Cathedral of St. Nicholas in Famagusta as king of Jerusalem. It was here that the Genoese found their opportunity for intervention in Cyprus. During the crowning ceremony at Famagusta, according to custom, the leaders of the Genoese and Venetian communities at Famagusta had the honour of holding the two reins of the royal horse. There was a conflict over who would hold the right rein and who would hold the left which grew and continued into the celebration dinner and afterward, and expanded into the streets of Famagusta, where the Venetians and the Genoese fought each other, resulting in a great deal of damage and many victims (innocent and otherwise). Genoese traders were considered responsible for the fighting and were arrested. The other Genoese organised an expedition, financed by the wealthy people of Genoa, headed by Peter di Campofregoso, brother of the Doge.\n\nKing Peter and his councillors in Cyprus believed that all available military forces should be brought together to face the Genoese threat. Peter therefore made a treaty with Emir Teke forfeiting Antalya (which had been captured by his father, Peter I) to him. The Cypriots withdrew their forces in 1373. Peter did not lead the resistance against the Genoese, but left it to his uncles, John and James. The young king, who was with his mother Eleanor on Famagusta, only managed to lose a very important city-harbour and get himself taken captive. Famagusta, which was excellently fortified, was captured by the Genoese when the city allowed them to enter, supposedly for negotiations. The Genoese proved themselves somewhat less than trustworthy in this regard.\n\nPeter and Eleanor the Dowager Queen were held captive by the Genoese, who also attacked Limassol and Paphos, and entered the kingdom's capital, Nicosia. Peter's uncles John and James resisted successfully against the Genoese from the St. Hilarion Castle and from the town of Kyrenia. The following year (1374), Peter was forced to come to a humiliating agreement with the Genoese declaring that Kyrenia and what remained of Famagusta would fall under Genoese sovereignty, that he would pay huge compensations to the Genoese, and that James would leave Cyprus. James obeyed and departed from Kyrenia Europe, but on the way he was arrested by the Genoese, despite the fact that they had told him they would give him time to leave. He returned only years later, when he became King of Cyprus, following his nephew's death.\n\nIt was at this time, in 1374, that Cyprus ceased to hold the residence of the exiled Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. The Patriarch had fled to Cyprus following the Fall of Acre in 1291 and his heirs remained there for the next eighty years, but after the events of 1374 the Catholic Church shifted to appointing titular Patriarchs of Jerusalem who were based at the Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura in Rome.\n\nThe operation in Cyprus brought the Genoese many benefits. Before they left, they executed those who were allegedly involved in Peter I's murder, as they had promised Eleanor, who, after the end of the war with the Genoese, in 1375, had Prince John killed.\n\nThe powerful Eleanor had already come into conflict with Valentina Visconti not long after she was wedded to Peter II. Eleanor was involved in numerous court scandals and other issues, so Peter decided to send his mother away. Despite her protests, Eleanor returned to Castile in September 1378.\n\nPeter successfully negotiated a peace treaty with the Sultan of Egypt. He also built and improved the fortifications of Nicosia, as well as building a royal villa in the village of Potamia and other building projects. Like his father, he created his own similar currencies. He died on 13 October 1382 at the Palace of La Cava, Nicosia, and was buried at St. Dominic's, Nicosia.\n"}

TfW replaced the previous franchise, Arriva Trains Wales in October 2018.\n\nIn March 2007 the latest in a series of infrastructure improvements on the Valley Lines was announced, which included lengthening of platforms between Rhymney and Penarth to allow Class 150 units to operate in multiples of 3 (6 cars). However, this is postponed indefinitely due to the sub-lease by the Department for Transport, to Great Western Railway, of the units that would have allowed this extra capacity.\n\nThe line currently has a 15-minute daytime headway between Bargoed and Cardiff, with most journeys terminating at Penarth. Prior to re-signalling early in 2006, a 20-minute headway was operated. North of Bargoed, one train per hour runs over the single track to Rhymney. The Sunday service operates over the entire length of the line every 2 hours, though this now runs all the day since Dec 2005.\n\nCurrent stock comprises DMU classes 142, 143 and 150. The Rhymney line was one of the final two routes worked by Class 37/4 diesel locomotives on passenger trains (the other being the West Highland Line).\n\nSome peak hour and Saturday services were formed of one Class 37/4 locomotive and four Mk. 2F carriages. Two locomotives received special heritage repaints into 1960s BR Green livery (no. 37411) or 1980s BR Blue Large Logo livery (no. 37425) to mark the end of locomotive-hauled trains. Two Class 37s (nos. 37425 and 37408) were involved in a runaway situation and collided at Rhymney Sidings on 30 July 2005. Number 37408 was withdrawn, and replaced by previously stored no. 37419. Number 37425 was repaired, but whilst it was out of traffic, Class 47 locomotives were hired from Riviera Trains as cover. Class 37-hauled trains finished on 10 December 2005, however in the new year Arriva received complaints from commuters about comfort and over-crowding, so reinstated a Monday to Friday diagram, operating a morning train into Cardiff, and an evening train back to Rhymney, usually using 37410. With the December 2006 timetable change this service reverted to DMU, and with Arriva Trains Wales said to be disposing of its loco hauled stock, it would appear as though the end of loco haulage on the line has finally come. Class 37 services operated between June 2019 and March 2020 after being withdrawn due to reliability issues. For these service 37421 in Colas Rail livery was used and 37418 and 37025 (as a thunderbird loco) both in BR Large Logo liveries these were leased from Colas Rail.\n\nOn 16 July 2012 plans to electrify the line were announced by the UK Government. The announcement was made as an extension of the electrification of the South Wales Main Line from Cardiff to Swansea and the electrification of the south Wales Valley Lines at a total cost of £350 million. The investment will require new trains and should result in reduced journeys times and a cheaper to maintain network. It is thought to start between 2014 and 2019. Preliminary re-signalling work on the route, which will see the remaining manual signal boxes at Heath, Ystrad Mynach and Bargoed abolished in favour of remote control from the new Cardiff Rail Operating Centre, was completed in early September 2013\n\nIn addition, a new station at in Caerphilly was opened on 16 December 2013, with trains running from there since 8 December.\n\n"}

Prior to the restoration of the wetlands, the land had been used for cattle grazing. Before this North Creek was straightened and confined to transport timber from upper areas of the watershed to sawmills located around Lake Washington. The complex ecological restoration project for the wetlands began in 1997 along with the construction of University of Washington Bothell and Cascadia College campus. The goal of this project was to restore the area within the surrounding urban watershed into a sustainable and fully functional floodplain ecosystem. To manage and ensure forthcoming sustainability, great detail was given to essential theories of ecosystem science and ecological restoration in the design and implementation of the site. The hydrology was restored; drainage ditches and dikes were filled or removed. Small topographic variations were added to encourage environmental diversity and multiple plant communities. Between 1998 and 2002, over 100,000 plants were planted. Seven years after initial planting, the Wetland restoration project met its 10-year objectives.\n\nThe wetland is also an area for education. Over 30 courses have visited the restored wetland from the CUSP (Center for University Studies and Programs), Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) Programs.\n"}

He was released after four months and received three years' probation. After violating his probation by failing to attend a sex offender treatment program, he was arrested. His mother then informed his probation officer that she had found questionable material in his apartment—a journal. Dalton's journal was retrieved; it contained graphic depictions of the torture and rape of children. Police determined the depictions were fictional.\n\nDalton was charged with production and possession of child pornography. As part of a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to one of the charges in July 2001. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, in addition to the remaining time from the first case. Dalton then attempted to change his guilty plea, to pursue an appeal. The trial court denied his request.\n\nDalton, supported by the American Civil Liberties Union, charged that the Ohio child pornography statute was unconstitutional. Ohio law forbids the possession of all child pornographic materials, including writings, while the U.S. Supreme Court has generally held that only the possession of obscene photographic depictions of actual children may be outlawed.\n\nThe case received wide publicity because of the private nature of a diary and a novel application of state child pornography laws.\n\nIn July 2003, the Court of Appeals of Ohio vacated the conviction and allowed Dalton to retract his guilty plea, accepting his argument that he would not have pleaded guilty had he received effective assistance from his court-appointed lawyer. The court did not speak to the constitutional issues.\n\nIn November 2003, the Ohio Supreme Court declined, by a 5–2 vote, to take the case on further appeal.

{"id": "2064329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064329", "title": "Harold Davidson", "text": "Harold Davidson\n\nHarold Francis Davidson (14 July 1875 – 30 July 1937), generally known as the Rector of Stiffkey, was a Church of England priest who in 1932, after a public scandal, was convicted of immorality by a church court and defrocked. Davidson strongly protested his innocence and to raise funds for his reinstatement campaign he exhibited himself in a barrel on the Blackpool seafront. He performed in other sideshows of a similar nature, and died after being attacked by a lion in whose cage he was appearing in a seaside spectacular.\n\nBefore his ordination in 1903, Davidson had a brief career on the London stage as an entertainer. As a young curate he became actively involved with charitable activity among London's poor, an interest he maintained following his appointment in 1906 as rector of the rural Norfolk parish of Stiffkey. After the First World War, in which he served as a naval chaplain, he devoted himself primarily to his London work. Styling himself the \"Prostitutes' Padre\", his declared mission was the rescue of young girls he considered in danger of falling into vice. In this role he approached and befriended hundreds of girls and, although there was little direct evidence of improper behaviour, Davidson was frequently found in compromising situations. His neglect of his local duties over many years strained relations with his parishioners in Stiffkey; after a formal complaint, the Bishop of Norwich instituted disciplinary proceedings through a consistory court. Davidson's defence was severely compromised by his eccentric conduct, and was damaged beyond repair when the prosecution produced a photograph of him with a near-naked teenage girl.\n\nDavidson's later career as a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His attempts at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles that he had not been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine and he did not deserve the humiliations he endured.\n\nHarold Davidson was born on 14 July 1875 in Sholing, near the south coast port of Southampton, to the Reverend Francis Davidson and his wife Alice. Francis Davidson was the vicar of St Mary's, Sholing, a post he had held since 1866; as many as 27 members of the Davidson family were or had been Anglican clergy. Alice Davidson, née Hodgskin, was a great-niece of the educator and Rugby School headmaster Thomas Arnold. Sholing was a poor parish, with a mixed population of dock labourers and itinerant workers, many of whom had little interest in churchgoing. Francis Davidson, described by Harold Davidson's earliest biographer, Tom Cullen, as \"a tiny man ... with a luxuriant beard that gave him the appearance of a gnome\", served the parish for 48 years. Although he could be pugnacious when necessary, according to a former parishioner he was a true pastor, willing to offer help whatever the circumstances.\n\nDavidson's family assumed that he would follow his father in becoming a priest and he was brought up strictly. When he was six he began attending Banister Court School in Southampton, an establishment founded initially for the sons of Merchant Navy officers. In 1890 Harold was sent to live with two maiden aunts in Croydon while he attended the Whitgift School. Here he became an enthusiastic amateur actor, encouraged by his friendship with a fellow-pupil, Leon Quartermaine, who later won recognition on the stage and in films. In February 1894 the pair appeared together in a school production of the farce \"Sent to the Tower\". Under his aunts' influence, Davidson became a part-time worker at Toynbee Hall, an East End charity founded by Samuel and Henrietta Barnett which attracted many volunteers from schools and universities. Because of these distractions he neglected his school work and failed to win a scholarship that would enable him to attend Oxford University and study for holy orders. In the face of his father's disapproval, he decided to pursue a career as a stage comedian.\n\nDavidson's principal theatrical genre was that of the \"drawing-room entertainer\"; Cullen describes this kind of performance as \"An answer to the demand of a rising middle class which was neither cultured nor resourceful, but which wanted desperately to be diverted\". Within a few months of leaving Whitgift in 1894, Davidson appeared on the London stage, at Steinway Hall in Lower Seymour Street, performing a comic routine. He was reasonably successful and in the next few years found provincial engagements with Masonic lodges, literary societies and similar social organisations. Cullen suggests that his greatest triumph was as a comic actor in a touring production of Brandon Thomas's popular farce \"Charley's Aunt\". Davidson played the part of Lord Fancourt Babberley, who masquerades as the rich aunt of a fellow-Oxford undergraduate—a frenetic role for which Cullen believes Davidson was eminently suitable.\nDuring his theatrical days, Davidson maintained high standards of personal morality, observed strict teetotalism and gave regular Bible readings to the elderly in the towns in which he performed on tour. He later gave an account of an incident from November 1894 when he was performing in London. While walking along the Thames Embankment in a thick fog, he said, he encountered a 16-year-old girl who was about to throw herself into the Thames. After preventing her suicide attempt, Davidson learned that she had run away from home near Cambridge, was penniless and without shelter. He paid her fare home: \"Her pitiful story made a tremendous impression on me ... I have ever since ... kept my eyes open for opportunities to help that kind of girl.\"\n\nIn 1898 Davidson finally bowed to his father's wish that he should study for holy orders, after the intervention of the Reverend Basil Wilberforce, grandson of the abolitionist William Wilberforce and a friend of the Davidson family. Wilberforce was an alumnus of Exeter College, Oxford, and used his influence to secure Davidson a place there despite the latter's lack of qualifications. At Oxford, Davidson's behaviour was notably eccentric; he displayed considerable energy but disregarded rules, was persistently unpunctual and regularly failed his examinations. He continued to appear on the stage when he could, and decorated the walls of his rooms with autographed pictures of actresses. By 1901 his academic inadequacies were such that he was required to leave Exeter College, although he was allowed to continue studying for his degree at Grindle's Hall, a cramming establishment. He finally passed his examinations in 1903, at the age of 28, and that year was ordained by the Bishop of Oxford—after some reluctance on the part of the bishop to accept so unpromising a candidate.\n\nIn 1901, when Annie Horniman's travelling theatrical company visited Oxford, Davidson fell in love with one of the company's leading actresses, Moyra (\"Molly\") Cassandra Saurin, an attractive blonde and blue-eyed woman from County Meath in Ireland. The couple were quickly engaged, but the relationship was stormy and was several times broken off. There was no question of marriage until Davidson was fully established in his new profession. His first church appointment was a curacy at Holy Trinity Church, Windsor, Berkshire, with an additional role as assistant chaplain to the Household Cavalry at Combermere Barracks. In 1905 he was transferred to London as curate at St Martin-in-the-Fields, where his enthusiasm and industry drew approving comments.\n\nDavidson's appointment in 1906 as rector of the Norfolk parish of Stiffkey with Morston came through the patronage of the 6th Marquess Townshend, whose family had a long history of public and political service in the county. The appointment was probably given in recognition of Davidson's role in reconciling the fierce opposition of the Townshend family to the marquess's proposed marriage to Gwladys Sutherst, the daughter of a bankrupt Yorkshire businessman; as curate of St Martin's, Davidson had officiated at the wedding on 8 August 1905. The Stiffkey living was highly desirable, with of glebe land, a large Georgian rectory, and an income in 1906 of £503 per annum, rising during Davidson's incumbency to £800.\n\nStiffkey, close to the northern Norfolk coast, lies on both sides of the River Stiffkey, with extensive salt marshes on its seaward side. At the time of Davidson's arrival in 1906 the village, with a population of around 350, was generally impoverished although, according to Davidson's 2007 biographer Jonathan Tucker, it was well supplied with shops and public houses. Davidson was quickly on good terms with most of the villagers, who referred to him with affection as \"Little Jimmy\"—he was only tall. He was less well regarded by the local gentry, including the main landowner, Colonel Groom, who fell out with Davidson after the priest rebuked him for keeping a mistress.\n\nOn 9 October 1906, now settled into a prosperous living, Davidson married Molly Saurin. The Stiffkey rectory became a family home, as children were born at regular intervals. Notwithstanding his parochial and domestic responsibilities, Davidson quickly adopted the habit of spending much of the week in London, engaged in various kinds of social work. Through his friendship with Reginald Kennedy-Cox, whom he had met at Oxford, Davidson became involved with the Malvern Mission, forerunner of the Dockland Settlements, of which he later became a trustee. He also became chaplain to the Actors' Church Union, based at St Paul's, Covent Garden, and was frequently to be found backstage in London's theatres, ministering to the needs of showgirls—sometimes with an unwelcomed degree of persistence. Between 1910 and 1913 he expanded this work to Paris, to which he made regular visits, sometimes acting as a chaperone for dancers recruited by the Folies Bergère. Many out-of-work and would-be actresses were invited to stay at the Stiffkey rectory, sometimes as many as 20 at a time, to the consternation of Molly Davidson and of some of the local establishment who feared for the morals of local farmhands. Among those most disapproving of Davidson's conduct was Major Philip Hamond, a churchwarden at Morston, who later became Davidson's principal adversary.\n\nDavidson was 39 years old at the outbreak of war in 1914. In October 1915, possibly to escape the increasingly turbulent atmosphere in the Stiffkey rectory, he joined the Royal Navy as a chaplain. He began his service on HMS \"Gibraltar\", a depot ship based in the Shetland Islands, where he irritated his shipmates by calling church parades every time another ship visited the anchorage; he had the full approval of the base commander, Vice Admiral Sir Reginald Tupper, who was known as \"Holy Reggie\". Davidson's service report from \"Gibraltar\"s captain records that \"he performs his duties in a perfunctory manner. Not on good terms with messmates, disregards mess rules and regulations\". In October 1916 Davidson joined HMS \"Fox\" in the Middle East, and shortly afterwards was arrested by the naval police during a raid on a Cairo brothel. He explained that he was looking for a diseased prostitute who had been infecting his men. Again his commanding officer's reports were negative; however, Davidson remained with the \"Fox\" until August 1918 when he was posted to HMS \"Leviathan\" in the northern Atlantic. Here, his commander was slightly more complimentary; he found Davidson \"a clever writer and entertainer [who] pays attention to duty\". Davidson left the Navy in March 1919.\n\nWhen Davidson returned home he found that Molly was six months pregnant. The dates of his service leave during 1918 made it apparent that he was not the father. A daughter was born on 21 June 1919; the likely father was a Canadian army colonel, Ernest Doudemain, a friend from Davidson's schooldays who had lodged at the rectory in the latter part of 1918. Although deeply upset by his wife's infidelity, Davidson accepted the child—who bore some resemblance to him—as his own. To escape the poisoned atmosphere in Stiffkey he applied for a year's posting as chaplain to a hill station at Simla in India, but the opportunity fell through. Instead, Davidson resumed his pre-war routine of spending his weeks in London, departing early on Monday morning and returning late on Saturday. Sometimes, through a missed rail connection or other mishap, he was barely in time for the Sunday morning service at Stiffkey, and sometimes he would fail to arrive at all.\n\nDavidson, perhaps on the basis of his youthful Thames-side rescue, had convinced himself that nearly all young girls alone in London were in need of rescue from a life of vice. Typical of these was Rose Ellis, whom he met in Leicester Square in September 1920. Twenty years old and living precariously from part-time prostitution, she was homeless and had no money. Davidson gave her cash for a room, and arranged to meet her the following week. Thus began a friendship that endured for more than a decade. Davidson brought her to the rectory, where she worked for a time in the gardens. He also tried to get her a job with a touring theatre company, took her to Paris to find employment as an au pair, kept her supplied with small sums of money, and paid her medical bills when she was suffering from venereal disease.\n\nAccording to his own estimate, Davidson approached around 150 to 200 girls a year over a period of 12 years (he later modified these figures to an overall total of between 500 and 1000). His activities usually centred on the innumerable Lyons, ABC and Express Dairies teashops and their staffs of waitresses. Davidson was mesmerised, says Blythe, by \"the ineffable harmonies created by starched linen crackling over young breasts and black-stockinged calves in chubby conference just below the hem of the parlourmaid's frock\". Many rejected his advances; a number of teashops considered him a pest and barred him. Landladies took exception to his habit of visiting their female tenants at all hours of the night. Commentators have found little evidence that he behaved indecently, or molested the girls; he bought them tea, found them rooms, listened to their problems and sometimes found them work on the stage or in domestic service. He styled himself the \"Prostitutes' Padre\", and asserted to his bishop that this was \"the proudest title that a true priest of Christ can hold\".\n\nTo meet the costs of his lifestyle, Davidson needed more money than his Stiffkey living could provide. He sought to improve his financial position when, in about 1920, he met Arthur John Gordon, supposedly a wealthy American company promoter but in reality an undischarged bankrupt and confidence trickster. Gordon not only persuaded Davidson to invest his savings in a range of dubious schemes, but also got him to solicit funds from other investors. Davidson borrowed heavily to increase his investment and by 1925 was in serious financial difficulties. In February that year he failed to pay his local rates and was threatened with imprisonment. He avoided this by borrowing from moneylenders at exorbitant interest rates, but in October was forced to file a petition of bankruptcy with debts totalling £2,924. Eventually a settlement was reached, whereby around half of his Stiffkey stipend was applied to the reduction of his debts. Somehow, however, Davidson managed to continue his London life. He never stopped believing in Gordon's essential honesty, and was certain that one day his investments would pay off. Much of his time in London was spent, not in pursuit of girls, but looking for Gordon.\n\nAlthough many of Davidson's parishioners accepted that his London rescue mission was entirely honourable, some, including Major Hamond, were less convinced. Hamond was suspicious of the stream of visitors that Davidson brought to the Stiffkey rectory and thought he was neglecting his parochial duties. In 1927 relations between the two men worsened when Davidson, in a letter which Tucker describes as \"breathless in its rudeness and insensitivity\", upbraided the major for clearing the ground in the Morston churchyard alongside his recently deceased wife's grave: \"Morston Churchyard is the private freehold property of the Rector of Morston ... you have no possible right to interfere with it in any way without my permission any more than I have the right to come and annex a part of your garden.\" On one occasion, Davidson arrived late at Morston to officiate at a communion service, having forgotten the bread and wine; enraged, Hamond ordered him back to the rectory to collect it. An even greater lapse, in Hamond's eyes, was Davidson's failure to return to Stiffkey in time to officiate at the 1930 Armistice Day ceremony at the local war memorial.\n\nEarly in 1931, advised by a cousin who was a priest, Hamond made a formal complaint against Davidson to the Bishop of Norwich, the Right Reverend Bertram Pollock, citing the rector's supposed behaviour with women in London. Under the provisions of the Clergy Discipline Act of 1892, members of the clergy could be prosecuted in a consistory court for \"immoral acts\" and, if convicted, face punishments ranging from temporary suspension to full deposition—\"defrocking\"—from holy orders. Pollock was initially reluctant to prosecute Davidson, but was advised by his legal counsel Henry Dashwood that the case should proceed. In search of evidence, Dashwood hired a private enquiry agent, who soon found Rose Ellis and persuaded her to sign a statement detailing her ten-year association with Davidson. The statement—which was immediately retracted by Ellis and never presented in court—contained little indication of any intimate relationship other than that she had once lanced a boil on Davidson's bottom.\n\nEnquiries continued for many months. The bishop was initially reluctant to pursue the case—Davidson thought he might be prepared to replace the charges with a lesser one of indiscipline. In February 1932 Dashwood advised Pollock that the matter could not be suppressed in this way; allegations had been printed in the \"Evening News\" on 1 February, and the story had been picked up by other papers whose lurid headlines had created much public interest. On 7 February the bishop received a letter from a 17-year-old girl, Barbara Harris, which contained specific allegations of immoral conduct against Davidson and promised more: \"I know lots of things against him that might help you ... He has the keys of a lot of girls' flats and front doors.\" This letter is described by Matthew Parris in his account of the case as \"a masterpiece of vituperation\"; Davidson's lawyers failed to identify some obvious differences between the handwriting in the letter and other examples of Harris's writing, a factor which might have affected the impact of her subsequent testimony to the court.\n\nA consistory court was convened for 29 March 1932, under the presidency of the Norwich diocesan chancellor, F. Keppel North. Davidson was accused of associating with \"women of loose character\", and \"accosting, molesting, and importuning young females for immoral purposes\". The prosecution's case was in the hands of a high-profile legal team, headed by Roland Oliver KC and including the future cabinet minister Walter Monckton. Davidson, meanwhile, engaged experienced lawyers to defend him, funding this partly through the sale of newspaper stories. Because of the level of press interest, and the number of London-based witnesses involved, the court sat in Church House, Westminster, rather than in Norwich.\n\nAfter Oliver provided a summary account of Davidson's life in London, Barbara Harris gave evidence. Cullen likens her evidence to \"a whip of scorpions\" that Davidson took full in the face. Davidson had first met Harris in September 1930, when she was 16. He had used a favoured ploy—affecting to confuse her with a well-known film actress—to persuade her to take a meal with him. He then began regular visits to her lodgings, gave her small sums of money and promised to find her work. From time to time he shared rooms with her: \"At first he kept to the chair\", Harris wrote, \"but after the first few nights he did not\". In her evidence to the court she said she had not had intercourse with Davidson, though he had attempted this on several occasions; when she had repulsed his advances, she claimed that he had \"relieved himself\".\n\nOther aspects of the odd relationship were revealed during Harris' lengthy examination and cross-examination: her visit to the Stiffkey rectory where she had been made to work as an unpaid kitchenmaid and given only a chair to sleep in; Davidson's repeated promises to divorce his wife and marry Harris; an incident when she and another girl, the latter in a nightgown, had danced in front of Davidson, supposedly so that he could judge their dancing abilities. The picture that Harris' letter and evidence presented, if true, Tucker says, was that of \"a man who is out of control ... running around London entertaining teenage girls ... adopting the guise of a kindly priest to ingratiate himself\".\n\nHarris was followed into the witness-box by a succession of landladies, waitresses and other women, all of whom confirmed Davidson's habitual pestering without making any serious accusation of misconduct. When Davidson himself took to the stand, on 25 May, his light-hearted, even flippant, manner created, says Tucker, \"the flavour of a comedy routine with the rector's counsel as straight man\". Davidson's disastrous finances were aired—he took great offence when his association with Gordon was presented as a \"partnership in crime\". He caused disbelief and amusement in the court when, questioned about the boil-lancing incident with Rose Ellis, he professed not to know what a \"buttock\" was, claiming: \"It is a phrase I have honestly never heard. So far as I remember it is a little below the waist.\" At this stage, only Harris's largely uncorroborated testimony had provided specific allegations of immorality; the rest of the evidence was inconclusive and it seemed that the prosecution might fail. Davidson's cause was severely damaged, however, when Oliver produced a photograph of him, taken on 28 March 1932, with a nearly naked girl. She was Estelle Douglas, the 15-year-old daughter of one of Davidson's oldest friends. Davidson explained that the picture had been intended as a publicity shot to help the girl find work as an actress. He protested that he had been set up, and did not know she was naked under her shawl; he thought she was wearing a bathing suit, as she had been in an earlier photograph. On 6 June, after closing speeches from both sides, the court adjourned until 8 July to allow the chancellor, who alone would determine the outcome, to consider the evidence.\n\nDuring the court proceedings Davidson continued to officiate at Stiffkey and Morston, although his erratic attendance meant that substitutes often had to be arranged. On 12 June 1932 the Reverend Richard Cattell arrived to officiate at the evening service in Stiffkey. He had just begun when Davidson entered the church and attempted to seize the Bible. The two priests wrestled with the book for some seconds before Cattell yielded, telling the congregation: \"As nothing short of force will prevent Mr Davidson from taking part, I can see nothing left to do but to withdraw.\" The crowds of reporters and sightseers at weekends led the Archdeacon of Lynn to issue a statement deploring the \"media circus\" and asking that \"the full spirit of worship\" be restored to Sunday services.\nOn 8 July 1932 Keppel North announced his verdict; Davidson was guilty on five counts of immorality. The sentence would be determined by the bishop; in the meantime, Davidson was entitled to seek leave to appeal to the Privy Council. Sorely in need of funds to meet his continuing legal expenses, Davidson reverted to his early career as a stage entertainer. On 18 July he made his debut with a variety act at the Prince's Cinema in Wimbledon and later toured in the provinces until, possibly dissuaded by pressure from church authorities, theatres declined to book him. He then continued his public performances by appearing in a barrel on the Blackpool sea front, or \"Golden Mile\", where thousands paid to observe him through a small window. Not everyone was impressed; one customer, recalling the event years later, said: \"He was very tatty and the place stank.\" He shared his seafront billing with, among other attractions, \"Mariana the Gorilla Girl\", the \"Bearded Lady from Russia\" and Dick Harrow, \"the world's fattest man\".\n\nTo the consternation of Hamond and some other parishioners, the bishop delayed issuing an instruction forbidding Davidson to preach. When Hamond locked Morston church against him, the rector preached to a large congregation on the grass outside the church. In August, Davidson's licence to minister as a priest was revoked; his last service was morning worship at Stiffkey on 21 August 1932, when around 1,000 people congregated outside the church. That afternoon he demanded the Morston church keys from Hamond, who sent him away by turning him round and administering a substantial kick. Hamond was later fined for this assault.\n\nIn July and again in October, Davidson was refused leave to appeal to the Privy Council on grounds of either fact or law. The consistory court reconvened for sentencing in Norwich Cathedral on 21 October. Davidson was allowed briefly to address the court; he admitted that his behaviour had been indiscreet, but regretted none of his actions and proclaimed his innocence \"of any of the graver charges that have been made against me\". Then, in what Blythe describes as a \"horrible little ceremony\", Bishop Pollock delivered the most severe sentence available—that of deposition: \"Now therefore we, Bertram ... do thereby pronounce decree and declare that the said Reverend Harold Francis Davidson being a priest and deacon ought to be entirely removed, deposed and degraded from the said offices.\" Davidson was thus defrocked. As the ceremony ended he made a furious impromptu speech, denouncing the sentence and declaring his intention to appeal to the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nThe consistory court had awarded the prosecution's costs against Davidson, who now faced enormous legal bills and had no regular source of income. His only recourse was to return to Blackpool and resume his career as a showman; this became his milieu for the next four years, interrupted by occasional prosecutions for obstruction and a nine-day spell in prison in 1933, for non-payment of rent owing to one of his former London landladies. He informed the press: \"While I am in the barrel I shall be occupied in preparing my case\". Although the barrel act remained his staple performance, he introduced variations over the years: freezing in a refrigerated chamber, or being roasted in a glass-fronted oven while a mechanised devil prodded him with a pitchfork. In August 1935 the freezing routine led to Davidson's arrest and prosecution for attempted suicide; he won the case and was awarded £382 damages for false imprisonment. How much money Davidson made from his various acts is uncertain; Tucker believes that the main financial beneficiary was his agent, Luke Gannon.\n\nMolly Davidson had managed to acquire a small house in South Harrow, where Davidson spent his winters. Off-season he worked sporadically, at one time as a door-to-door book salesman and on other as a porter at St Pancras railway station. He could not avoid press attention; in November 1936 he was arrested and fined for pestering two 16-year-old girls at Victoria station—he had approached them offering auditions for a leading role in a West End show. That same month he interrupted a Church Assembly at Central Hall, Westminster, at which the Archbishop of Canterbury was present. Davidson was prevented from addressing the meeting, at which he dropped numerous copies of a mimeographed pamphlet titled \"I Accuse\", in which he listed his grievances and castigated the Church's hierarchy.\n\nBy 1937 interest in Davidson's Blackpool sideshows was waning and, for that summer, he accepted an invitation to join the self-styled \"Captain\" Fred Rye's animal-themed show in the east coast resort of Skegness. He considered this a step upwards from what he termed \"the blatant vulgarities of Blackpool\". Davidson's act consisted of a 10-minute address delivered outside a cage containing two lions, after which he would enter the cage and spend a few minutes with the lions. This required courage on Davidson's part, because he was fearful of animals. A 16-year-old tamer, Irene Somner, supervised proceedings. The act was billed as \"Daniel in a modern lion's den\", and attracted large audiences, including a significant number of clergy.\n\nOn 28 July 1937, at the evening performance, Davidson gave his usual speech before entering the cage in which two lions, Freddie and Toto, were sitting quietly. Then, according to Blythe: \"in scarcely credible terms, the little clergyman from Norfolk and the lion acted out the classical Christian martyrdom to the full\". Eyewitnesses later reported that after Davidson had cracked his whip and shouted, Freddie became agitated and knocked Davidson over, before seizing him by the neck and running with him around the cage. Somner struggled to pacify the snarling Freddie, who eventually dropped the unconscious Davidson, enabling her to drag him to safety; he was badly gashed, and had suffered a broken bone in his neck. An uncorroborated story circulated that while waiting for the ambulance, Davidson asked that the London newspapers be alerted in time for next day's first editions. According to some press reports he sat up in hospital and asked visitors for their impressions of his ordeal in the cage. Most historians of the affair, however, believe that Davidson never recovered consciousness. He died on 30 July, his death possibly hastened by an insulin injection administered by a doctor who believed that Davidson was a diabetic. The coroner's verdict was death by misadventure.\n\nFriends and well-wishers covered the expenses of the funeral, which took place on 3 August in Stiffkey churchyard. A large crowd—around 3,000 according to Tucker—was in attendance including, from Davidson's distant past, the Marchioness Townshend. Onlookers unable to get into the churchyard found vantage points on nearby walls, roofs and in trees. When the headstone was put in place it contained a line from Robert Louis Stevenson: \"For on faith in man and genuine love of man all searching after truth must be founded.\"\n\nIn Skegness, Rye saw Davidson's death as a business opportunity; crowds flocked to see \"The Actual Lion that Mauled and Caused the Death of the Ex-Rector of Stiffkey\". By contrast, Molly Davidson's financial situation was desperate. When her family applied to the church authorities for help, Archbishop Lang acted on her behalf behind the scenes and eventually she received grants from two church charities. She died in a Dulwich nursing home in 1955. Of the other major participants in the legal case, Pollock remained as Bishop of Norwich until his resignation in 1942, a year before his death. Davidson's girls—Rose Ellis, Barbara Harris, Estelle Douglas and the rest—disappeared from public view after the 1932 trial, although a 1934 letter from Davidson indicates that Harris was then working at the London store Selfridges, under the name \"Babs Simpson\". When announcing a 2010 book about the war artist Leslie Cole, The Fleece Press revealed that Harris had married Cole after changing her name and had thereafter successfully concealed her true identity from all enquirers. Even her husband may not have known of her past.\n\nAfter Davidson's death and burial, press attention withered as newspapers concentrated on more significant events in the years before the Second World War. In the decades after the war interest in the affair was periodically revived. In 1963 Blythe, deemed by Parris to be the affair's \"best historian\", published his account. Later in the 1960s, two stage musical versions were produced: \"The Stiffkey Scandals of 1932\", which appeared in Edinburgh in 1967 and London in 1968, and \"God Made the Little Red Apple\", staged in Manchester in 1969. Neither of these productions was commercially successful; when the former was adapted for television, \"The Daily Telegraph\"s critic questioned the artistic justification for a musical about \"so sad and peculiar a person\". In the 1970s Davidson's case was the subject of a radio documentary, \"A Proper Little Gent\", and in 1994 an episode of BBC Television's \"Matter of Fact\" series examined the affair. Cullen's full-length biography of Davidson in 1975 posits a theory that multiple personalities led him to behave in different ways in differing circumstances. Robert Brown, in a biographical sketch for the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", suggests that what really motivated Davidson will never be known. In 2001 Ken Russell made a short film inspired by his life \"The Lion's Mouth\".\n\nIn 2007 John Walsh published a fictionalised account of Davidson's life, \"Sunday at the Cross Bones\" (Fourth Estate), in which, according to a review in \"The Guardian\", Davidson is depicted as \"well-meaning but ineffectual, bewildered by the world's wickedness and his own barely acknowledged desires\".\n\nThe question of Davidson's treatment by the consistory court was first raised by the \"Church Times\" immediately after the trial. A leading article argued that, although Davidson's conduct had been \"foolish and eccentric\", his intentions at least at the start of his ministry had been guided by idealism. Chancellor North was criticised both for lacking compassion and for the general conduct of the proceedings: \"No experienced criminal solicitor could conceivably have blundered so badly and consistently.\" In 2006 Davidson's granddaughter, Karylin Collier, privately published a brief biography, \"The Rector of Stiffkey: His Life and Trial\", in which she maintains the innocence of all the charges against him. Tucker argues that \"Harold Davidson probably deserved to be quietly defrocked for his shortcomings as a priest\", but nevertheless believes that he was not an immoral man. He also highlights the incompetent presentation of Davidson's case by his legal team, particularly their failure to question the provenance of the Barbara Harris letter. Tucker concludes that since the proceedings were flawed and the evidence of immorality flimsy, the Church of England owes it to the Davidson family to re-examine the original findings.\n\nThe writer-historian A. N. Wilson summarises Davidson as a \"Tragic buffoon cum Christian Martyr\". In his history of Britain in the inter-war years, A. J. P. Taylor writes that \"Davidson offered a parable of the age. He attracted more attention than, say, Cosmo Gordon Lang, archbishop of Canterbury. Which man deserves a greater place in the history books?\"\n\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

In June 1964, the Vale of Glamorgan line between Barry and Bridgend was closed to passengers by the Beeching Axe, as set out in the report 'The Reshaping of Britain's Railways', but after 41 years, in June 2005, it was reopened to passengers with two new stations at Llantwit Major and Rhoose, and the disused bay platform (now '1A') at Bridgend was reinstated to act as a terminus for the Vale Line. The line itself had been retained for freight traffic to/from the Ford Factory in Bridgend, and to Aberthaw Power Station, as well as to provide a detour for main line trains when the direct Bridgend to Cardiff line was closed. \n\nNetwork Rail's mileage from Barry Junction zero to Bridgend is 19. Geographically, the Vale of Glamorgan Branch starts at Barry Junction and terminates at Bridgend station. The Barry branch (sic) runs into Vale of Glamorgan territory at the River Ely viaduct 1½ rail miles from the Cardiff West zero. The Penarth branch runs from Cogan Junction to Penarth town, the branch having been closed beyond Penarth to Cadoxton via Biglis Junction in 1968. Following the dramatic rationalisation that was to come about on South Wales railways after the 1960s, a large station board at Barry had announced \"Change here for the Vale of Glamorgan Line.\" No such sign now exists but passengers must be made aware that if they board a Bridgend train at Cardiff, if wishing to get to Barry Island they must change trains at Barry station. Thus if boarding a Barry Island train at Cardiff and wishing to travel to Rhoose (for Cardiff International Airport), Llantwit Major or Bridgend, they must change at Barry station.\n\nOriginally owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Railway Company and running between Coity Junction, north of Bridgend in the Llynfi valley and to the west of Barry, all traffic over it was operated by the Barry Railway Company, and the line opened from 1885. The whole of the Barry Railway, including Barry Docks, the Vale of Glamorgan branch, the Cadoxton-Trehafod branch and the Cardiff-Barry Island branch (Currently the Barry branch) became a constituent part of the Great Western Railway in 1923, after the railway grouping.\nLocal traffic on the Vale of Glamorgan branch included that from the limestone quarries and the cement works at Aberthaw and Rhoose at the eastern end of the line. Wartime traffic was created from Tremains and Brackla Hill at Bridgend and the RAF base at St. Athan. More recent developments were the opening of the Aberthaw power stations (Aberthaw \"A\" in October 1963 (official opening date) and Aberthaw \"B\" station in 1971) and the Ford engine plant at Bridgend in January 1980. Aberthaw \"B\" power station was closed in 1995 and demolished by 1998. \nThe Vale of Glamorgan Barry-Bridgend passenger service finished on Saturday 15 June 1964 as part of the Beeching cuts, but passenger trains on the eastern part of the Barry Branch from Cardiff-Barry-Barry Island continued, and the western section continued to be used by through passenger trains between Cardiff and Bridgend when the main line via Pontyclun is closed. This still frequently happens at night or on Sundays and train operators can run freight traffic via this route to retain train crew route knowledge or to avoid delays on the main South Wales line.\nDue to public demand, the line was successfully reopened to passengers as from 10th June 2005.\n\nFrom the late 1990s, some trains run between Ford’s plants at Dagenham and Bridgend and merry-go-round coal trains run between Onllwyn and Cwmgwrach (to the west), Tower Colliery (Finished February 2017), Ffos-y-Frân (Merthyr Tydfil), Newport Docks and Avonmouth (to the east), to Aberthaw \"B\" power station, averaging some 10 trains a day.(These workings were considerably modified by 2016 and the Vale of Neath line to Cwmgwrach was in mothball from N&B Junction, Neath). However, in August 2019, the last merry-go-round coal delivery had been run to Aberthaw \"B\" power station and the station is to be closed in the spring of 2020. It had also been announced that Ford's Waterton plant is to close in 2020. Rhoose cement works closed by 1987 and has been demolished but a connection is retained to CRH Tarmac's (LaFarge) Aberthaw cement works where wagons had been stored occasionally but after sporadic use, three cement trains per week were started to Westbury and Moorswater from December 2016. Cement tank rail traffic continues in November 2019.\nThere remains a mainline station connection with the heritage operation of the Barry Tourist Railway at Barry Island railway station.\n\nA pressure group called Railfuture produced a booklet \"Rails to the Vale\" in 1997 in which it was stated that they believe: \"that a new daily passenger service through the vale could cover its costs – and even generate profits given time\"\n\nWith traffic increasing to Cardiff International Airport, the Local Government transport consortium SWIFT also identified the potential for reopening the Vale of Glamorgan line. The scheme was promoted by the Vale of Glamorgan and Bridgend Borough Councils to the Welsh Assembly Government in August 1999. After agreeing funding, track upgrading and signalling works commenced in June 2004 with: of new track laid; of track upgraded; 15000 tonnes of ballast used; three new section signals (2 on the up and 1 on the down) were installed together with three distant signals and one repeater signal required by the curved approach to Llantwit Major Station. Final planning permission for the new stations and interchanges at Rhoose, Cardiff International Airport and Llantwit Major was granted in 2004 and from October 2004 the line was closed daily between Bridgend and Aberthaw or Barry for the station construction, with goods traffic passing at night. At Bridgend, the Barry bay was relaid and a new platform face built. Network Rail used three contractors: Mowlem for the permanent way; Carillion for signals and telephones; and Galliford Try for civil engineering, including the platforms. The Vale of Glamorgan Council was responsible for the construction of the interchanges at Rhoose, Cardiff International Airport and Llantwit Major. Network Rail spent £15m and the Vale of Glamorgan Council £2m making a grand total of £17m for the whole project. The daytime closures were shortened from April to enable crew training to commence.\n\nThe official opening was performed by Andrew Davies AM, Welsh Assembly Government Minister for Economic Development and Transport, on 10 June 2005. The section of line between Barry and Bridgend reopened for passenger services on 12 June, the first day of that year's Summer timetable, with a pair of Class 143s (143606 and 143624) working 0841 Cardiff-Bridgend via Llantwit Major and 0942 return Bridgend-Cardiff via Llantwit Major. Arriva Trains Wales then ran a number of loco-hauled special services in conjunction with the Barry (waterfront) transport festival.\n\nThe Barry (BRY), Penarth (PTH) and Vale of Glamorgan (VOG) branches are currently operated by Transport for Wales (TfW) as part of the Valley Lines network. TfW replaced the previous franchise, Arriva Trains Wales, in October 2018.\n\nThe city, towns and villages served by the stations on the line are listed below.\n\nOn 16 July 2012 plans to electrify the line were announced by the Government as part of a £9.4bn package of investment of the railways in England and Wales.\n\nThe announcement was made as an extension of the electrification of the South Wales Main Line from Cardiff to Swansea and the electrification of the south Wales Valley Lines at a total cost of £350 million. The investment will require new trains and should result in reduced journeys times and a cheaper to maintain network. It is thought to start between 2014 and 2019.\nThese plans have been eradicated and electrification will no longer occur.\n\n"}

The previous collapse after only three months of a coalition government formed by George-Étienne Cartier and Conservative John A. Macdonald and liberal George Brown, (the sixth government in six years) had demonstrated that continued governance of Canada East and Canada West under the 1840 Act of Union had become untenable. In order to reform the political system, a coalition was formed between the Clear Grits under George Brown, the Parti bleu under George-Étienne Cartier, and the Liberal-Conservatives under John A. Macdonald. The formation of this coalition took place between June 14 and June 30, 1864 and was officially completed on June 22, 1864 under George-Étienne Cartier and John A. Macdonald, as the colonies of the Canadas, and was significant to Canadian Confederation in 1867. The coalition persisted by the government of the Province of Canada until the moment of Confederation.\n\nThe Great Coalition was created to eradicate the political deadlock between Canada West and Canada East. The government at that time was unable to pass any legislation because of the need for a double majority. In order for a bill to pass in the Legislative Assembly, there had to be a vote in both Canada East and Canada West sections of the assembly. As the French and the English could never agree on anything, this caused political deadlock. This coalition was intended to create resolution with long-term impacts in solving some of these problems and unify Canada.\n\nThe deadlock led to three conferences that preceded confederation. The first was the Charlottetown Conference, which was convened for the purpose of negotiating a Maritime union. However, the politicians began to discuss the possibility of a larger union that would include all of British North America. This continued at the Quebec Conference where they further discussed the union of British North America and defined the details of the government's shape. They also settled on the division of provincial and federal responsibilities. The London Conference revised the Quebec Resolutions.\n"}

Their origin is uncertain, but they may have evolved out of the pharmaceutical use of sugar, as they were a miniature version of comfits. The French name has been interpreted to mean they were \"without equal\" for intricate decoration of cakes, desserts, and other sweets, and the elaborate pièces montées constructed as table ornaments.\n\nThe term \"nonpareil\" can also refer to a specific confection made using nonpareils, namely, flat discs of chocolate coated with nonpareils, which are also known as chocolate nonpareils and freckles in Australia.\n\nAn 18th-century American recipe for a frosted wedding cake calls for nonpareils as decoration. By the early 19th century, colored nonpareils seem to have been available in the U.S. The popular cookbook author Eliza Leslie suggests the use of red and green nonpareils for decorating a Queen cake, but strongly suggests \"white\" nonpareils are most suitable for pink icing on a pound cake in her 1828 \"Seventy-five Recepts for Pastries, Cakes and Sweetmeats\".\n\nIn 1844, Eleanor Parkinson, of a well-known Philadelphia family of professional confectioners, first published her book \"The Complete Confectioner\", in which she described how to make nonpareils following her comfit-making procedure, which involved multiple hot pots and hot syrup.\n\nGörlitz, Germany was the birthplace of the German version of nonpareils, popularly known in Germany as \"Liebesperlen\" (German: \"love pearls\"). Invented by confectioner Rudolf Hoinkis (1876–1944), the name derives from a conversation Hoinkis had with his wife, proclaiming he loved her like these \"pearls\", the nonpareil. Unsure of what to call the treat he invented, his wife suggested calling them \"love pearls\", and the name stuck. The factory where he first manufactured the treat, founded in 1896, is now run by his great-grandson, Mathias.\n\nIn the United States, traditional nonpareils gave way for most purposes by the mid 20th century to \"sprinkles\" (known in some parts as \"jimmies\"), confections nearly as small but usually oblong rather than round and soft rather than brittle. Like nonpareils, their function is more decorative than gustatory as their actual taste is indistinct, and the products they are applied to are usually themselves very high in sugar. Candy-covered anise seeds called muisjes, sometimes mistaken for traditional nonpareils, are sometimes offered at breakfast in the Netherlands to be served on bread and butter. They are, however, usually served on rusk to celebrate the birth of a child. This is known as \"beschuit met muisjes\".\n\nIn the UK, Australia and New Zealand, nonpareils are known as \"hundreds-and-thousands\". In Australia and New Zealand, they are often eaten on top of patty cakes or on buttered bread as fairy bread, as festive items at children's birthday parties.\n\nThe term \"nonpareils\" can also refer to a specific confection: a round flat chocolate drop with the upper surface coated with nonpareils. This confection is also referred to as \"chocolate nonpareils\". Nestlé makes a variety marketed as Sno-Caps. In Australia, these confections are commonly known as \"chocolate freckles\", or simply \"freckles\". Nonpareils are also sold in the United Kingdom as \"Jazzles\", \"Jazzies\", \"jazz drops\" and \"Snowies\" (the latter being of the white chocolate variety).\n\n"}

It was credited to his stage name at the time, an unpronounceable symbol (shown on the album cover), also known as the \"Love Symbol\".\n\nThe album was produced entirely by Prince and released on September 26, 1995, by NPG Records and Warner Bros. Records. The album charted at number 6 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number 2 on the Top R&B Albums. The singles \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\", \"I Hate U\", and \"Gold\" charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at numbers 3, 12, and 88 respectively.\n\n\"The Gold Experience\" sold 500,000 copies in the United States and peaked at number six on the \"Billboard\" 200, failing to meet the record label's commercial expectations. According to biographer Jason Draper, it may have undersold because Prince was losing touch with younger listeners and also because his contractual dispute with Warner Bros. Records overshadowed the album's promotion, which he had done well before it was released.\n\nNonetheless, \"The Gold Experience\" was a success with critics. \"Melody Maker\" called it Prince's best record in years, while \"Vibe\" said it was his best since \"Sign o' the Times\" in 1987. In \"The Village Voice\", Robert Christgau wrote that it showcased not only the unbridled artistry displayed on his other records but also \"a renewal. It's as sex-obsessed as ever, only with more juice—'Shhh' and '319' especially pack the kind of porno jolt sexy music rarely gets near and hard music never does.\" He believed its best songs, specifically \"Endorphinmachine\" and \"P Control\", \"funk and rock as outrageously and originally as anything he's ever recorded\". Jon Pareles was less enthusiastic in \"The New York Times\", finding most of the songs to be minor successes and calling it \"a proficient album, not a startling one; most of its songs are variations and retreads of previous Prince efforts.\"\n\n\"The Gold Experience\" was voted the 30th best album of 1995 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by \"The Village Voice\". Christgau, the poll's supervisor, ranked it 10th best in his own year-end list. In a retrospective review, Keith Harris from \"Blender\" cited \"The Gold Experience\" as the best album Prince recorded in the 1990s, \"a mix of newly stripped-down funk and delicate balladry that reasserts his dynamic range\".\n\nSeveral people speculated that the song \"Billy Jack Bitch\" was written about a \"Minneapolis Star Tribune\" gossip columnist known as \"CJ\". Prince denied the song was about the columnist when CJ herself interviewed him.\n\nAll songs written by Prince, except where noted.\n\n\n\nProduced by Prince, except:\n7, 12, 16, 18, co-produced by Ricky Peterson, and 5, co-produced with Ricky Peterson and Kirk Johnson.\n\n\nAnother track, \"Shhh\", charted from \"The Gold Experience\" in July 1994; it was not the album version, but rather a live version performed on \"The Beautiful Experience\" TV special, which aired in 1994. It received some R&B airplay, causing it to chart and peak at #62 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart.\n"}

It accounts for 85% of the land area of Jordan and 55% of Syria. To the south it borders and merges into the Arabian Desert. The land is open, rocky or gravelly desert pavement, cut with occasional wadis.\n\nThe desert is bounded by the Orontes Valley and volcanic field of Harrat al-Shamah to the west, and by the Euphrates to the east. In the north, the desert gives way to the more fertile areas of grass, and the south it runs into the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nSome sources equate the Syrian Desert with the \"\"Hamad Desert\"\", while others limit the name \"Hamad\" to the southern central plateau, and a few consider the Hamad to be the whole region and the \"Syrian Desert\" just the northern part.\n\nSeveral parts of the Syrian Desert have been referred to separately such as the \"Palmyrene desert\" around Palmyra, and the \"Homs desert\". The eastern section of the Syrian Desert, that within borders of Iraq, can be referred to (within Iraqi context) as the Western Desert.\n\nThe name \"Shamiyah\" has also been used for the Syrian Desert.\nThe name has been translated in the past as Badiyat al-Sham (or \"Badiyat ash-Sham\")\n\nThe 700-900m high region in the middle of the desert is the Hamad Plateau, a rather flat, stony semi-desert consisting of limestone bedrock covered with chert gravel. What little rain arrives on the plateau flows into local salt flats. The highest peaks of the Plateau are those of the 1000m+ Khawr um Wual in Saudi Arabia, and the 960m high Jebel Aneiza, at the border tripoint between Jordan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.\n\nTogether with the other deserts of the Arabian Peninsula, the Hamad Desert has been described as one of the most arid deserts of the world.\n\nSome of the climax plants in the Syrian Badia are \"Salsola vermiculata\", \"Stipa barbata\", \"Artemisia herba-alba\" and \"Atriplex leucoclada\". This desert ecosystem is under threat from drought, over-grazing, hunting and other human activities. Some native animals no longer inhabit this area, and many plant species have died out, with the grasses that have replaced them being of lower nutritional value to livestock.\n\nThe Syrian Desert is the origin of the golden hamster.\n\nStorks, herons, cranes, small waders, waterfowl, and also raptors visit the seasonal lakes. Small rodents are common, as are their predators such as snakes, scorpions and camel spiders; previously common were gazelle, wolf, jackal, fox, cat and caracal, also ostrich, cheetah, hartebeest and onager. The large mammals are now no longer to be found, thought to be due to hunting by man.\n\nThe desert was historically inhabited by Bedouin tribes, and many tribes still remain in the region, their members living mainly in towns and settlements built near oases. Some Bedouin still maintain their traditional way of life in the desert. Safaitic inscriptions, proto-Arabic texts written by literate Bedouin, are found throughout the Syrian Desert. These date approximately from the first century BC to the fourth century AD.\n\nOne of the most important ancient settlements in the Syrian desert is Palmyra; first mentioned in the second millennium BC, the city was an important trading center in Roman times, and its people were renowned merchants who took advantage of its strategic position on the silk road linking the far east to the mediterranean, by taxing passing by caravans, establishing colonies on the silk road, and trading in the rare commodities from the far east, thus bringing enormous wealth to their city. The city's people were a combination of Arameans, Amorites and Arabs.\n\nAnother important ancient settlement is the city of Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. Originally a fortress, it was founded by the Seleucid Empire by the name of \"Dura\", which means \"Fortress\", but was called \"Europos\" by the Greeks, as the combination \"Dura-Europos\" is a modern invention. The city prospered, mainly for its location on the Euphrates, importantly linking Mesopotamia to the Mediterranean, thus playing a huge part in both the commercial and military connections between the two regions. It was, however, raided by the Sasanian emperor Shapur I in the 250s, most of its citizens fled, and under Sasanian rule, the city was subsequently abandoned.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire authorities set up concentration camps in the Syrian desert as part of the Armenian genocide.\n\nThe desert was first traversed by motor vehicle in 1919.\nDuring the Iraq War, the desert served as a major supply line for the Iraqi resistance, with the Iraq portion of the desert becoming a primary stronghold of the Sunni resistance operating in the Al Anbar Governorate, particularly after the Coalition capture of Fallujah during the Second Battle of Fallujah. A series of Coalition military operations were relatively ineffective at removing the resistance presence in the Desert. As the resistance began to gain control of the surrounding areas, coalition spokesmen began to downplay the importance of the Syrian Desert as a center of operations; nevertheless the Syrian Desert remains one of the primary routes for smuggling equipment due to its location near the Syrian border. By September 2006 the resistance had gained control of virtually all of the Anbar Governorate and had moved most of their forces, equipment and leaders further east to resistance-controlled cities near the Euphrates river.\n\nWith low rainfall and poor quality soils, today the region is principally used as rangeland for livestock. Bedouin herdsmen, many of whom are still nomadic, graze about twelve million sheep and goats here, as well as a smaller number of camels.\n\nThe International Fund for Agricultural Development aims to alleviate rural poverty, and in 1995, in cooperation with the Syrian government, it started a project to rehabilitate over a million hectares of degraded land in the Syrian Badia. In some areas, when grazing was restricted, there was a spontaneous return of many of the native plants. In other areas which were more heavily degraded, grazing restrictions were supplemented by reseeding and the planting of fodder species. By the time the project ended in 2010, nearly a quarter of a million hectares had been reseeded, and nearly a hundred thousand hectares had been planted with native fodder shrubs. The result has been a great success, with some herdsmen reporting tenfold increases in the productivity of their livestock.\n\n"}

There are three major operational centers – Nampa, Idaho, United States, Ashford, United Kingdom, and Cairns, Australia. These centres provide operational support to programs in the Americas, Africa and Asia Pacific regions. In 2010, MAF served in more than 55 countries, flying 201,710 passengers with a fleet of some 130 aircraft.\n\nMAF began with several World War II pilots who had a vision for how aviation could be used to spread the Christian faith. After the War, Jim Truxton of the U.S., Murray Kendon in the United Kingdom, and Edwin Hartwig of Australia, with the support of like-minded Christians, founded missionary aviation agencies in their respective countries.\n\nThe U.S. organization was the first to take to the air, under the name Christian Airmen's Missionary Fellowship (CAMF), later known as Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF). In 1946, pilot Betty Greene flew the first MAF aircraft on its inaugural flight, transporting two missionaries of Wycliffe Bible Translators to a remote jungle location in Mexico. In addition to Truxton and Greene, other early members of CAMF include Charlie Mellis, Nate Saint, Larry Montgomery, Grady Parrott, George Fisk, Clarence Soderberg, and Jim Buyers. The earliest MAF fields of service were Mexico, Peru, and Ecuador. Over the years, the organization expanded to serve many countries of Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Eurasia.\n\nIn the U.K., Missionary Aviation Fellowship was initially organized as a wing of the Mildmay Movement (a Christian outreach organization), though it later became an independent organization. Murray Kendon was instrumental in the agency's founding, as were Jack Hemmings, Stuart King, and Tom Banham. MAF-UK conducted a survey of Central Africa in 1948, followed by service in Sudan in 1950. In subsequent years, the U.K. organization expanded service to other African countries.\n\nThe organizational meeting for an Australian MAF (AMAF) organization was held on June 30, 1947. Early members included Edwin “Harry” Hartwig, Leonard Buck, John Nimmo, Bruce Morton and Ken Cooper. After the purchase of a de Havilland Tiger Moth aircraft in 1949, Hartwig and Alex Friend undertook a survey of northern Australia. Hartwig then completed a needs assessment survey in New Guinea. In 1951 Hartwig, along with Bob and Betty Hutchins of MAF-US, established service in New Guinea, based at Madang. On August 6, 1951, Hartwig was killed when his aircraft crashed in the Asaroka Pass in the Central New Guinea Highlands. In the years following, work in Papua New Guinea and Dutch New Guinea (later called Irian Jaya, now Papua, Indonesia) continued through the joint efforts of the Australian and U.S. MAF organizations. Later, AMAF established service in central and north Australia (Arnhem Land), Borneo, and Bougainville.\n\nMAF came to worldwide attention when, in 1956, MAF-US pilot Nate Saint and four other missionaries were killed on a beach in Ecuador by Huaorani. Family members of those killed returned to Ecuador and ministered to the tribe, and some of the men who killed the missionaries eventually converted to Christianity. The story was featured in \"Life\" magazine, and several feature films have been made about the life and death of these missionaries, including \"End of the Spear\" in 2005.\n\nIn later years, MAF agencies were established in other countries, including New Zealand, South Africa, Suriname, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Canada.\n\nMAF Learning Technologies (MAF LT) developed in a similar way to the aviation support. MAF staff saw the needs of isolated church leaders which could be met with the use of various educational technologies including the internet, computers, MP3 players and other communication devices. MAF Learning Technologies is providing support to many other ministries seeking to provide leadership training, education and community development training to people in isolated areas.\n\nMAF missionaries perform tasks as diverse as digging wells in Mali, providing disaster relief services in Sumatra, installing jungle communications and internet wifi networks in Papua New Guinea and Ecuador, operating computer centers in rural African villages, providing air ambulance services in East Timor and Haiti, and showing the movie \"Jesus\" in remote villages. Its learning technologies division provides training and biblical resources for thousands of isolated pastors and church leaders. The organization focuses its mission work in the areas of evangelism and church nurture; medical assistance; disaster response; community development; and training and development of indigenous peoples.\n\nMAF has become well known as a provider of disaster response and relief services. Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, MAF provided air and communications support in Sumatra to humanitarian agencies responding to the crisis. In 2007, MAF provided aid following Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh and Hurricane Felix in Nicaragua, and worked with the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to halt an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2008, MAF aircraft evacuated missionaries and foreign aid workers from Chad following violence there. That same year, MAF airdropped food and medical supplies to villagers stranded by flooding in the wake of four deadly storms in Haiti, and served refugee camps in the Democratic Republic of Congo following clashes between government and rebel forces. MAF also provided relief services in response to the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti.\n\nMAF also provides internet, I.T. and RF communications to its various projects around the globe. In disasters, MAF uses a mobile VSAT terminal which can be 'checked' onto most commercial airlines as baggage. This terminal can provide emergency communications anywhere in the world and can be quickly deployed.\n\n\n\n\nMission Aviation Fellowship provides transport services to missionaries, translators, support personnel, consultants, trainers and linguists; provides medical evacuations; and assists in disaster relief work. In some areas, support is also provided to many Christian mission organizations, hospitals, local people and governments. Since these services involve flying into steep, short, or otherwise difficult runways, Mission Aviation Fellowship provides its personnel with training in STOL and other specialised techniques.\n\nAircraft currently used include:\n\nFormer Aircraft\n\nInformation from: Mission Aviation Fellowship Arnhem Land, Australian, Bangladesh, Canada, East Timor, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, UK & US websites and Airliners.net\n\n\n"}

Constance's younger sister, Infanta Isabella, married Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, the fourth son of King Edward III and Queen Philippa.\n\nOn 9 February 1372 Constance made a ceremonial entry into London as Queen of Castile, accompanied by Edward, the Black Prince, and an escort of English and Castilian retainers and London dignitaries.

It is usually made from \"dunwors\" (Afrikaans for \"thin sausage\") rather than \"dikwors\" (\"thick sausage\"), as the thinner sausage dries more quickly and is thus less likely to spoil before it can be preserved. If \"dikwors\" is to be used, it is usually flattened to provide a larger surface area for drying.\n\nThe recipe used for these dried sausages is similar to that for boerewors, though pork and veal are usually replaced by beef, as the former can go rancid when dried, mutton fat replaces the pork fat used in boerewors. Drying makes the sausage ideal for unrefrigerated storage.\n\nDroëwors is unusual among dried meats in being dried quickly in warm, dry conditions, unlike traditional droge worst\nItalian cured salumi, which are dried slowly in relatively cold and humid conditions. A further difference is that droëwors does not contain curing agent as found in a traditional cured sausage.

The Dawson Technical Institute was under the auspices of HWC from 1993 to 1995, at which point it became part of Kennedy-King College, another of the City Colleges of Chicago.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1993, one of its buildings by the El train(albeit with its sign still reading Loop College) was visible in the opening credits of the ABC sitcom \"Perfect Strangers\".\n\nHarold Washington College is a learning-centered, urban institution of higher education offering accessible and affordable opportunities for academic advancement, career development and personal enrichment. The College is committed to upholding high institutional and academic standards and to understanding and improving student learning.\n\nHWC as a community college offers two year \"Associates\" degrees in a wide variety of majors and provides transfer assistance to local four-year upper division colleges and universities. In 2005, it finished a series of substantial renovations with the help of a City bond initiative to be approved by the voters that was the first of its kind in support of a City Colleges institution.\n\nHarold Washington College was the only site in the City of Chicago for taxicab driver certification but now functions as the center of business, entrepreneurship and professional services for all of the City Colleges of Chicago. Harold Washington College is also the Chicago site for the investment/financial firm Goldman Sachs \"10,000 Small Businesses\" program, which provides Chicago area small business owners with greater access to business education, financial capital and business support services.\n\nIn 2004, Harold Washington College established a 'Great Books\" program. The school also has an agreement with private institution, Shimer College, another \"Great Books\" curriculum college in Chicago, to allow Harold Washington students to take classes at Shimer while paying City Colleges level of tuition.\n\nAccredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, Harold Washington College is also approved by the Illinois Community College Board, the Illinois Board of Higher Education and the Illinois State Board of Education. In 2013, the Council for Higher Education Accreditation recognized Harold Washington College's assessments of student learning outcomes, which have influenced course sequencing, pre-requisites, teaching strategies, faculty development and institutional policies, with the 2013 CHEA Award for Outstanding Institutional Practice in Student Learning Outcomes.\n\n\n"}

The first phase of construction of the base, code-named \"Project Seabird\", was completed in 2005 and the base was commissioned on 31 May 2005. Development of Phase II commenced in 2011. INS Kadamba is currently the third largest Indian naval base, and is expected to become the largest naval base in the eastern hemisphere after completion of expansion Phase IIB.\n\nDuring the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, the Indian Navy faced security challenges for its Western Fleet in Mumbai Harbour due to congestion in the shipping lanes from commercial shipping traffic, fishing boats and tourists. At the end of the war, various options were considered on addressing these concerns. Alternative locations for a base on the west coast were evaluated, including Thiruvananthapuram, Kannur and Thoothukudi.\n\nIn the early 1980s, then Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Oscar Stanley Dawson conceived of a dedicated naval base sandwiched between the craggy hills of the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea near Karwar in Karnataka state. Located south of the naval bases in Mumbai and Goa and north of Kochi, the location had significant advantages as being very close to the world's busiest shipping route between the Persian Gulf and east Asia and out of range of most strike aircraft from neighbouring countries. It also offered a natural deep-water harbour and significant land area for expansion, allowing larger aircraft carriers to berth. However, due to a variety of reasons, including the 1991 economic crisis, development was delayed.\n\nIn 1999, following Pokhran-II, then Defence Minister George Fernandes approved \"Project Seabird\" to pursue the construction of the new naval base at Karwar. Larsen & Toubro was the lead contractor for the marine works on the harbour, in partnership with Hochtief, Ballast Nadem Dredging of the Netherlands, Radisson of Australia and Nedeco of The Netherland. Over of breakwater were constructed using over 4.4 million cubic metres of rock to protect the harbour. The Binaga Bay was dredged and its rock outcrops blasted to allow even large aircraft carriers to turn inside the bay. Anjadip Island is one of the two islands to which the breakwaters are linked for reinforcement. A second channel will be added to the base to allow warships to enter and exit the port simultaneously.\n\nSpread over an area of and of coastline on the Arabian Sea, Phase I of INS \"Kadamba\" was commissioned on 31 May 2005. The expanded base opened in 2007, with space for up to 11 front-line warships and 10 smaller FIC-type boats. Key facilities include the 10,000 tonne, ship lift, a ship transfer system for dry docking at the Naval Ship Repair Yard, and a 141-bed naval hospital INHS \"Patanjali\". Naval Ship Repair Yard commenced functioning in July 2006 and the ship-lift was commissioned on 8 November 2006. Commodore K P Ramachandran was the first Commanding Officer of \"Kadamba\".\n\nPhase-I was completed at a total cost of .\n\nDevelopment of Phase II of INS Kadamba was supposed to commence in 2011 but got delayed due to lack of environmental clearance. The Phase-IIA expansion approval was obtained from the Cabinet Committee on Security in 2012, after getting approval from then Defence Minister A K Antony, and were granted. The environment clearance for Phase II was granted in June 2014 on a priority basis for strategic reasons by the environment minister Prakash Javadekar of Narendra Modi government. The work will now commenced in 2016 and is expected to be completed by 2022.\n\nUnder the proposed expansion plans, a 3,000 feet long runway will be built. If the Centre and the State send request to the Indian Navy seeking to utilize the runway for civil aviation aircraft, the runway length will be increased to 6,000 feet. Post completion as many as 30 warships can be anchored at the base and it would have a hangar to hold as many military aircraft. The Indian Navy, through the State government, has acquired 11,334 acres of land which includes 8,661 acres of forest land.\n\nPhase II-A is expected to commence in 2017 and end in 2021–2022 with an expected cost of Rs 19,600 crore. The project is expected to generate large scale employment and infuse money into the local economy. In this phase, the base will undergo the following upgrades:\nAfter completion of this phase, the base will have over one hundred thousand personnel working there, apart from their families living in an upcoming residential township. Apart from berthing INS \"Vikramaditya\", two more aircraft carriers will be homeported here. For this, two more jetties will be used. A few of the submarines will also be based here.\n\nAfter the completion of this phase of the project, INS \"Kadamba\" will be able to base 50 front-line warships, and will be the biggest naval base east of the Suez canal.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2064449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064449", "title": "Glenwood Cemetery (Houston, Texas)", "text": "Glenwood Cemetery (Houston, Texas)\n\nGlenwood Cemetery is located in Houston, Texas, United States. Developed in 1871, the first professionally designed cemetery in the city accepted its first burial in 1872. Its location at Washington Avenue overlooking Buffalo Bayou served as an entertainment attraction in the 1880s. The design was based on principles for garden cemeteries, breaking the pattern of the typical gridiron layouts of most Houston cemeteries. Many influential people lay to rest at Glenwood, making it the \"River Oaks of the dead.\" As of 2018, Glenwood includes the annexed property of the adjacent Washington Cemetery, creating a total area of 84 acres with 18 acres still undeveloped.\n\nNotable burials at Glenwood include former residents of the Republic of Texas, some who were re-interred from condemned cemeteries from downtown Houston. Charlotte Allen and William Robinson Baker were early arrivals to Houston, and also long time residents. Baker was one of several interments of former mayors of Houston. The last president of the Republic of Texas, Anson Jones, has a family plot. Former governors of Texas and a former governor of Mississippi lie at rest at the cemetery, as do some high-ranking federal officials. Scions of the oil business include two co-founders of Sharp-Hughes Tools, as well as founders and early investors of Texaco and Humble Oil. The founding president of Rice University, the school's chief architect, and the institute's first trustee are found at Glenwood.\n\nGlenwood Cemetery developed on two tracts of land on the north side of Buffalo Bayou, and west of Downtown Houston. Part of this land conveyed from the country estate of Archibald Wynns, a Houston lawyer and Congressman for the Republic of Texas. This tract was later the location of a brickyard, then the property of William Harrison King, who served as mayor of Houston. Glenwood Cemetery purchased the property and some adjacent land in the Hollingsworth Survey in 1870. Alfred Whitaker gained a charter to incorporate the Houston Cemetery Company. He owned his own landscaping company and used his expertise to clear out lots, lay out and grade right of ways, and otherwise beautify the landscape. Glenwood hosted its first burial on June 19, 1872. Many remains were reinterred at Glenwood after the condemnations of St. Vincent's and the Episcopal cemeteries. Glenwood obtained its state charter as the Houston Cemetery Company, starting as for-profit institution, the first state charter for a cemetery. About 25 years later, the Houston Cemetery Company changed its status to non-profit.\n\nBy 1874, Glenwood was a recreational destination. A mule-drawn street railway operated on Washington Road, conveying people to Glenwood for weekend and holiday visits. Upgrades and expansions to the street railways were both a response to demand for travel to the cemetery and a cause of it. Glenwood remained popular for about twenty years. A group led by W. D. Cleveland criticized the conditions of lots and roads in 1896 and asked for a receivership to manage Glenwood. Two court decisions resulted in a transfer of management to William Christian. Glenwood underwent reorganization in 1904, and more recently was reorganized as the non-profit Glenwood Cemetery, Incorporated in 1969. A separate organization, the Glenwood Cemetery Historic Preservation Foundation, started overseeing historic preservation of the property in 1999. The same year Glenwood acquired the adjacent Washington Cemetery, expanding its land area by 118 acres.\n\nKeith Rosen, a Houston area history professor quoted in the \"San Antonio Express-News\", said that the cemetery is the \"River Oaks of the dead.\" In 2003 the \"Houston Press\" ranked it as the \"Best Cemetery\".\n\nGlenwood Cemetery is located on the northern bank of Buffalo Bayou, and bounded by Washington Avenue to the north. Parts of the property afford views of the downtown Houston skyline, of Memorial Drive, and of Allen Parkway. The grounds are shaded by numerous hardwoods, and the bluffs are cut by deep ravines leading to the bayou. The grounds have formal landscaping, and a diversity of statues and monuments. The property covers 84 acres, with 18 acres still undeveloped as of 2018.\n\nAccording to architectural historian, Stephen Fox, many of Houston's earlier cemeteries featured a gridiron arrangement of grave sites, following a pattern of urban cemeteries. Glenwood did not employ a gridiron arrangement, and even many of Glenwood's successors retained the old manner of urban cemetery design.\n\nThis historic cemetery is the final resting place of a number of individuals who were citizens of the short-lived Republic of Texas. The grave sites of those individuals have been designated with metal markers and are frequently decorated with the flag of the Republic and State of Texas. Charlotte Baldwin Allen, wife of Augustus Chapman Allen, founder City of Houston, has her grave marked by a large monument. Charlotte's brother, Horace Baldwin, was a mayor during the Republic; and her daughter, Eliza Allen Converse, was touted as \"the first child born in Houston.\" Another early arrival to Houston was William Robinson Baker, who worked for the Houston Town Company starting in 1837. He was later a Houston mayor. He is buried next to his wife, Hestor Eleanor Runnels. Other citizens of the Texas Republic were Hiram Runnels, a former Governor of Mississippi (18331835), and James Wilson Henderson, who served as Governor of Texas in 1853. Anson Jones, the last president of the Republic of Texas, committed suicide at the Capitol Hotel and is buried here. His wife, Mary Smith Jones, the first lady of the Republic of Texas, died on December 31, 1907, and is buried at Glenwood Cemetery.\n\nTwo reconstruction mayors are interred at Glenwood: Joseph Robert Morris and Thomas Howe Scanlan.\nJohn T. Browne was mayor of Houston from 1897 to 1899 and member of Texas House of Representatives. Another mayor buried at Glenwood is Joseph Chappell Hutcheson, Jr., who also served as a federal judge. His father, Joseph Chappell Hutcheson, was a member of the Texas House of Representatives and United States House of Representatives from Texas' 1st congressional district. Houston lawyer and politician Thad Hutcheson represents a third generation of his family at Glenwood. Roy Hofheinz, Harris County Judge, Mayor of Houston, and developer of the Astrodome, is interred at Glenwood.\n\nAlbert Bel Fay, U.S. Ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago is interred at Glenwood. Edward M. House, was an adviser to Woodrow Wilson. He is the son of Thomas William House Sr. Buried in the cemetery is William P. Hobby, former Texas Governor, after whom Hobby Airport in Houston, Texas, is named. Oveta Culp Hobby served as the Secretary of Department of Health, Education and Welfare (19531955).\n\nAnother Texas governor at Glenwood, Ross S. Sterling (19311933), was co-founder of Humble Oil Company, along with William Stamps Farish II and \nHarry C. Wiess. A Texaco founder Joseph S. Cullinan resides there, as with independent oil producer and philanthropist, George H. Hermann, Houston business leader, and \"King of the Wildcatters,\" Glenn McCarthy. With McCarthy, Harry H. Lee, William Howard Lee, and film star Gene Tierney Lee are all buried in a family plot. An early developer of the Indonesian gas, Roy M. Huffington, also served as US Ambassador to Austria.\n\nWalter Benona Sharp, whose innovations in mud drilling led to development of the Spindletop field, has a family plot at Glenwood. He co-founded Sharp-Hughes Tool Company aka Hughes Tool Company, with Howard R. Hughes, Sr., who is also interred at Glenwood. The younger Howard R. Hughes, Jr, the aviator and industrialist, is also buried at the family plot and memorial. Another associate of Humble Oil, Florence M. Sterling, is buried at Glenwood. She was also an advocate for women's rights. Annette Finnigan was a suffragette, philanthropist, and arts patron. Buried here too is Edward F. Simms, a native of Kentucky who was an American lawyer, oil industrialist, and owner and breeder of Thoroughbred racehorses about whom a \"Houston Post\" obituary said that his career was \"a saga of American accomplishment.\"\nEdgar Odell Lovett was the first president Rice University (19121946) and is at rest at Glenwood. William Ward Watkin was the project manager for the construction of the original buildings on the Rice Campus. Captain James A. Baker was the personal attorney of William Marsh Rice. He protected the interests of the Rice Endowment and was a trustee of the university for fifty years. He was also a trustee of Glenwood Cemetery. Alice Graham Baker was the founder of the Houston Settlement Association. Adele Briscoe Looscan was a president of the Texas State Historical Association and the grand daughter of the namesake of Harris County, Texas. Margaret Kinkaid was the founder of The Kinkaid School, which she opened on Elgin Street in 1899.\n\nThis is also the location of pioneering heart surgeon Denton Cooley's family gravesite. Cooley's grandfather, Daniel Denton Cooley, developed the Houston Heights subdivision. Denton Cooley died November 18, 2016 and is buried at Glenwood.\n\nAnne McCormick Sullivan was a firefighter who died in the 2013 Southwest Inn fire. Stacy Barnett and John Goosey were murder victims (murder of John Goosey and Stacy Barnett).\n\n"}

The program was begun in 1977 by the late Halbert Robinson, who recognized the need for extremely gifted students to have an accelerated academic program. The Transition School, founded in 1980, gives a small group (usually 16-18) of talented middle school age students the chance to enter the University of Washington while also developing the skills, knowledge, and support needed to succeed in college. The Center is now under the direction of Dr. Nancy B. Hertzog, and the associate director of TS/EEP and Transition School Principal is Dr. Maren Halvorsen. The physicist Ernest M. Henley is a former physics instructor.\n\nThe Early Entrance program starts with a one-year Transition School. Enrolled students are generally called TSers. Between 15 and 18 students (no older than 15, usually 14, but there have been students as young as 12) are enrolled each year. They are initially provided with a curriculum comprising five courses, English, History, Pre-Calculus, and Biology during fall and winter quarters. In the spring quarter, the Biology class ends, and the students each enroll in an entry-level University class of their choice. The curriculum changed Fall 2015, replacing Physics with Biology. This provides a taste of what actual University work is like before making a full transition to university classes in the following fall. During Winter Quarter they take a course called U-Ready where they learn about registration and other things necessary before they take their Science course in Spring. In Spring Quarter, students all take part in service learning through their history class.\n\nFollowing the Transition School, the students become full-time freshmen at the University, and many also enter the University's Honors Program. Students usually stay at University of Washington for four years, culminating their Early Entrance Program years with a bachelor's degree.\n\nIn 2001, another option was added alongside the Early Transition Program and the Transition School: The UW Academy for Young Scholars, or \"The Academy\". This provides a more fast-paced and quicker transition into university classes and university life than the Early Entrance Program, with a two-day, one night orientation that provides students with necessary university survival skills known as Academy Camp, and two Academy courses on composition and honors seminar.\n\nThe Transition School and Early Entrance Program, as well as the UW Academy for Young Scholars is a non-residential program open only to residents of Seattle, Washington and the surrounding area. Prospective students from other areas are welcome to apply if they are willing to move to the Seattle area upon acceptance.\n\nThe Transition School curriculum is designed to prepare students for entrance into University. One of the major skills that it focuses on teaching is argumentation, and the interpretation, development, and writing of specific, complex, and academic arguments. Both the History and English classes make this a focus throughout the year. \nTS English starts the year by focusing on the development of said arguments, as Fall Quarter is devoted to teaching students \"how to write\". In Winter Quarter, the focus shifts as students start implementing different methodologies for their reading, including formalism and ideology critique.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was formerly the book critic and lead technology writer at \"Time\" magazine (2002–16).\n\nGrossman was born on June 26, 1969 in Concord, Massachusetts. He is the twin brother of video game designer and novelist Austin Grossman, brother of sculptor Bathsheba Grossman, and son of the poet Allen Grossman and the novelist Judith Grossman. Grossman's father was born Jewish and his mother was raised Anglican, but Grossman has said, \"I grew up in a very unreligious household. Very. I have no religion at all. So I come at religion as about as much of an outsider as you can be in Western civilization.\" On the assumption that he was raised Jewish, he has said, \"I have this extremely old-world name, and people can invite me to as many Jewish book festivals as they want to--but I wasn't raised Jewish.\"\nHe is an alumnus of Lexington High School and Harvard College. He graduated from Harvard in 1991 with a degree in literature. Grossman then attended a Ph.D. program in comparative literature for three years at Yale University, but dropped out before completing his dissertation.\n\nGrossman has written for \"The New York Times\", \"Wired\", \"Salon.com\", \"Lingua Franca\", \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"Time Out New York\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", and \"The Village Voice\". He has served as a member of the board of directors of the National Book Critics Circle and as the chair of the Fiction Awards Panel. In May 2015, Grossman gave the third annual Tolkien Lecture at Pembroke College, Oxford.\n\nIn writing for \"Time\", he has also covered the consumer electronics industry, reporting on video games, blogs, viral videos and Web comics like Penny Arcade and Achewood. In 2006, he traveled to Japan to cover the unveiling of the Wii console. He has interviewed Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Salman Rushdie, Neil Gaiman, Joan Didion, Jonathan Franzen, J.K. Rowling, and Johnny Cash. He wrote one of the earliest pieces on Stephenie Meyer's \"Twilight\" series. A piece written by Grossman on the game \"Halo 3\" was criticized for casting gamers in an \"unfavorable light.\" Grossman was also the author of the Time Person of the Year 2010 feature article on Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nGrossman did some freelancing and wrote for other magazines. Some of the works he wrote at this time include \"The Death of a Civil Servant,\" \"Good Novels Don't Have to be Hard,\" \"Catalog This,\" \"The Gay Nabokov,\" \"When Words Fail,\" and \"Get Smart.\" He freelanced at \"The Believer\", \"the Wall Street Journal\", \"New York Times\", \"Salon\", \"Lingua Franca\", and \"Time Digital\".

He then recounted these actions in an essay titled \"Terrors of the Amazon\". His second novel, \"Codex\", was published in 2004 and became an international bestseller. After \"Codex\", Grossman published the book that he is most well known for, \"The Magicians\".\n\nIn an article for \"The New York Times\" Grossman wrote: \"I wrote fiction for 17 years before I found out I was a fantasy novelist. Up till then I always thought I was going to write literary fiction, like Jonathan Franzen or Zadie Smith or Jhumpa Lahiri. But I thought wrong. ... Fantasy is sometimes dismissed as childish, or escapist, but I take what I am doing very, very seriously.\n\nGrossman's \"New York Times\" bestseller \"The Magicians\" was published in hardcover in August 2009. The trade paperback edition was made available on May 25, 2010. \"The Washington Post\" called it \"Exuberant and inventive...Fresh and compelling...a great fairy tale.\" The book is a dark contemporary fantasy about Quentin Coldwater, an unusually gifted young man who obsesses over Fillory, the magical land of his favorite childhood books. Unexpectedly admitted to Brakebills, a secret, exclusive college of magic in upstate New York (an amalgam of Bannerman's Castle and Olana), Quentin receives an education in the craft of modern sorcery. After graduation, he and his friends discover that Fillory is real.\n\nMichael Agger of \"The New York Times\" said the book \"could crudely be labeled a Harry Potter for adults,\" injecting mature themes into fantasy literature. \"The Magicians\" won the 2010 Alex Award, given to ten adult books that are appealing to young adults, and the 2011 John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer.\n\nIn August 2011, \"The Magician King\", the sequel to \"The Magicians\", was published, which returns readers to the magical land of Fillory, where Quentin and his friends are now kings and queens. \"The Chicago Tribune\" said \"The Magician King\" was \"\"The Catcher in the Rye\" for devotees of alternative universes\" and that \"Grossman has created a rare, strange and scintillating novel.\" It was an Editor's Choice pick of \"The New York Times\", who called it \"[A] serious, heartfelt novel [that] turns the machinery of fantasy inside out.\" \"The Boston Globe\" said \"\"The Magician King\" is a rare achievement, a book that simultaneously criticizes and celebrates our deep desire for fantasy.\"\n\nThe third book in the series is titled \"The Magician's Land \" and was published on 5 August 2014.\n\nA television adaptation of the \"Magicians\" trilogy premiered on December 16, 2015, although Grossman said in 2011 that he did not believe the source material would be conducive to a film adaptation.\n\nIn September 2016, Grossman announced that he was working on a King Arthur novel called \"The Bright Sword.\"\n\nIn July 2019, Grossman, with co-writer Lilah Sturges and illustrator Pius Bak, released \"The Magicians: Alice's Story\", a graphic novel told from the perspective of Alice, a secondary character from the book series.\n\nGrossman lives in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn with his second wife, Sophie Gee, whom he married in early 2010, and his daughter Lily from a previous marriage.

{"id": "2064462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064462", "title": "Penarth railway station", "text": "Penarth railway station\n\nPenarth railway station is the railway station serving the town of Penarth in the Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales. It is the terminus of Network Rail's Penarth branch running from Cogan Junction to Penarth station, from the junction and south of station. The Penarth branch ran from Cogan Junction to Biglis Junction, a rail mileage of and was officially closed beyond Penarth after the last passenger train ran on Saturday 4 May 1968.\n\nPenarth Station (or Penarth Town as it was originally known) was built for the Cardiff, Penarth and Barry Junction Railway, and opened in 1878 as part of that company's new line to Lavernock. This was a continuation of the Taff Vale Railway's \"Penarth Extension Railway\", which had been completed in February 1878 and gave the town its first rail link to Cardiff.\n\nThe Taff Vale took over the CP&BJR in 1889 and had the line completed from Lavernock to Biglis Junction (east of ) on the Barry Railway in 1890. The extension attracted holiday and weekend traffic from Penarth to the beach at Lavernock or Barry Island Pleasure Park for the day, with steam trains running every 30 minutes from 7.15 am until 11.45 pm in both directions. There was also a sizeable amount of commuter traffic from the station eastwards into Cardiff. As first constructed the station had two side platforms & tracks (plus a non-platform line for goods traffic), a signal box and a goods yard at the Lavernock end of the station.\n\nAfter \"The Reshaping of British Railways\" report, British Rail withdrew the passenger service west of Penarth on 6 May 1968. General goods traffic over the route had previously ended on 7 October 1963 (the date the goods yard here also closed), leaving only the cement trains from the factory at Cosmeston and so the line beyond there closed to all traffic. The remaining section to Penarth followed suit in November 1969 when the Snowcem works closed, leaving the station as a dead-end terminus. The line has been single track between Cogan Junction and Penarth since February 1967.\n\nParts of the disused trackbed through Lower Penarth and towards Sully have been blocked and built on. Other parts have been turned into a rural railway walk and cycle path from north of Alberta Place (south of Penarth station) to Brockhill Rise road overbridge, approximately one half-mile north-east of the former Lavernock station.\n\nUntil 1968 Penarth station had two platforms, one on each side of the tracks for down and up traffic, with a gated foot crossing. After the branch was singled and the line on towards Sully and Biglis Junction closed, the platform buildings on the Plymouth Road side were sold and used as a garden centre until they were demolished in the 1980s and a new Government Jobcentre plus and private offices were built in their place. The loss of the down platform and its station building also effectively closed the station's main car parking area in the specially widened eastern end of Plymouth Road.\n\nClosure of the coastal rail line removed the direct link between Penarth and Barry, Barry Island, Rhoose or Llantwit Major. Completion of the journey from Penarth by rail today entails first travelling north as far as Grangetown, before catching a connecting train in the reverse direction to Barry or any of the stations mentioned above, thus doubling the journey time and distance travelled.\n\nBR had most of the original 19th-century station buildings demolished and replaced with modern ones in a major remodelling in 1984. Since 1971 the station's original ticket office building, built in 1887, has been let as a fast food outlet.\n\nThe original Railway Hotel no longer provides accommodation but is still a public house.\n\nThe station has a small \"drop off and pick up only\" car park in Station Approach.

{"id": "2064466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064466", "title": "Roseanne Conner", "text": "Roseanne Conner\n\nRoseanne Conner (née Harris) is the title character of the TV series \"Roseanne\", played by Roseanne Barr. Roseanne, in a takeoff of her stand-up comedic and presumed real-life persona, is bossy, loud, caustic, overweight, and dominant. She constantly tries to control the lives of her sister, husband, children, co-workers, and friends. Despite her dominating nature, Roseanne is a loving wife and mother and loyal friend who works hard and makes as much time for her family as possible.\n\nIn 1987, coming up with ideas for new shows, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner of Carsey-Werner Productions decided to look into the concept of the working mother as a central voice. Up until that point, there had been shows with working mothers, but only as an adjunct to the father in the family. Werner had suggested that they take a chance on Barr whom they had seen on \"The Tonight Show\". This was because he saw the unique \"in your face\" voice that they were looking for, and he contacted her agent and offered her the role. Barr's act at the time was the persona of the \"domestic goddess\", but as Carsey and Werner explains, she had the distinctive voice and attitude for the character and she was able to transform her into the working class heroine they envisioned. Barr immediately took the role.\nBarr has stated she had crafted the \"fierce working-class domestic goddess\" persona in the eight years preceding the sitcom and wanted to do a realistic show about a strong mother who was not a victim of patriarchal consumerism.\n\nBarr became outraged when she watched the first episode of \"Roseanne\" and noticed that Matt Williams was listed as the creator in the credits. She told Tanner Stransky of \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"We built the show around my actual life and my kids. The 'domestic goddess', the whole thing\". In the same interview, Werner said, \"I don't think Roseanne, to this day, understands that this is something legislated by the Writers Guild, and it's part of what every show has to deal with. They're the final arbiters.\" During the first season, Barr sought more creative control over her character, opposing Williams' authority. Barr refused to say certain lines and eventually walked off set. She threatened to quit the show if Williams did not leave. ABC let Williams go after the thirteenth episode.\n\nRoseanne Conner is a lifelong resident of Lanford, a fictional medium-sized city in Illinois. She and her younger sister Jackie (Laurie Metcalf) are the daughters of Beverly (Estelle Parsons) and Al Harris (John Randolph). Roseanne married her high school sweetheart Dan Conner (John Goodman) and, when the series begins, they have three children: Becky (Alicia Goranson, later Sarah Chalke), Darlene (Sara Gilbert) and D.J. (Michael Fishman); a fourth child, Jerry Garcia, is born late in the series. She and her family deal with the many hardships of poverty, obesity, and domestic troubles with humor.\n\nRoseanne is a line worker at Wellman Plastics, along with Jackie and their friend Crystal (Natalie West). Roseanne's parents consider moving to Lanford, but eventually decide against it. She also deals with tomboy Darlene struggling with her femininity as she enters puberty and gets her first period, and Becky's dating problems with her first boyfriend, Chip (Jared Rushton). Season one also finds the Conners experiencing, and surviving, a tornado. In the episode \"Death and Stuff\", a door-to-door salesman dies in the Conners' kitchen, and in the season finale, Roseanne stands up to a new foreman, when she leads Jackie, Crystal, and other coworkers as they quit Wellman Plastics.\n\nNow that they've quit Wellman Plastics, Roseanne and Jackie must find new jobs. Jackie decides to become a police officer. Roseanne cycles through a variety of menial jobs including telemarketer, secretary for Dan's boss, bartender, cashier at a fast-food restaurant, and, finally, sweeping floors at a beauty parlor. At home, Dan's poker buddy Arnie Thomas (Tom Arnold) plants a passionate kiss on Roseanne. The Conners celebrate an outrageous Halloween that becomes an annual feature of the series. Roseanne wants 10 minutes to herself in the bathroom; this turns into a bizarre dream sequence which has the entire cast singing parodies of songs from musical comedies. Later, Becky repeatedly rebels against Roseanne and Dan's parental authority. The reappearance of old biker buddy Ziggy (Jay O. Sanders) reminds Roseanne and Dan of their own rebellious past. Darlene first proves her talent for writing when she wins recognition for her poetry. Roseanne's own writing talents are given a boost when her family fixes up a basement room to serve as a writer's den. This is the first season where we hear Roseanne thinking out loud.\n\nThe season opens with Roseanne confronting the issue of pregnancy: She takes a pregnancy test that turns up negative. Roseanne takes on a job as waitress in the restaurant at Rodbell's Department Store, where she meets Leon and Bonnie. Later she locks horns with snooty new neighbor Kathy. In the season finale, Ziggy reappears, proposing to open a motorcycle repair shop with Dan and Roseanne. While they are in the process of getting the business off the ground, Ziggy decides to leave because he doesn't want to feel responsible if the business fails. However, he leaves enough money for Dan to open it by himself.\n\nThe season starts with Becky surprising Roseanne by asking for birth control pills. Roseanne and Dan begin their new motorcycle repair shop business, Lanford Custom Cycle, while Roseanne continues to work at Rodbell's Department Store. Roseanne must deal with Darlene, who has gone through a personality shift into a sullen goth teen. Later Roseanne gets breast reduction surgery due to back problems. At the end of the season, Roseanne and the Conners face problems as Lanford Custom Cycle fails, and Rodbell's Luncheonette closes.\n\nAfter the bike shop closes, Roseanne and Jackie each get a check for $10,000 from their mother after she and their father divorce. They, along with their friend Nancy (Sandra Bernhardt), decide to open a diner but can only get the money they need after Beverly agrees to become a partner as well. \n\nRoseanne discovers Becky has eloped with her boyfriend Mark (Glenn Quinn), whom she and Dan dislike. Jackie gets involved with a man who Roseanne and Dan learn is physically abusive and breaks it off with their help. Her and Roseanne's father dies, and Roseanne confronts his longtime secret mistress, as well as the abuse she suffered as a child at his hands. Roseanne's rich, estranged cousin Ronnie (Joan Collins) visits and persuades Darlene to get her GED and apply to art school. Darlene asks her parents if her boyfriend David (Johnny Galecki) can move in, because his mother is moving away and they want to stay together. Roseanne and Dan initially refuse, but when Roseanne sees David's mother being verbally and emotionally abusive, she decides to let him stay because it reminded her of her own troubled childhood. Roseanne learns Darlene got an acceptance letter from the art school while David got rejected. At the end of the season, Roseanne fears Darlene will run away to school, although Darlene has already decided not to go. Realizing she was wrong, Roseanne persuades Darlene to not give up on her goals just to stay with David.\n\nUnder pressure from Roseanne to leave the Lanford Lunch Box, Bev sells her share in the restaurant to their hated boss Leon (Martin Mull) to get back at them. Dan and Roseanne discover an old stash of marijuana and smoke it in their bathroom. Roseanne's past as an abuse victim arises when she reacts violently to DJ after he joyrides and wrecks her car. Becky and Mark return home and move into the Conners' house. Roseanne, and Dan discover David has secretly moved in with Darlene at school. Roseanne visits a gay bar with Nancy, where she receives a surprise kiss from Nancy's girlfriend. \nAt the end of the season Roseanne attends Jackie's wedding.\n\nSeason seven begins with Roseanne's unexpected pregnancy. \nShe battles much drama this season as she tries to get Darlene and David back together.\n\nSeason eight addresses Roseanne's baby shower and the subsequent arrival of her son, Jerry Garcia Conner. (In a continuity error, the baby had been revealed to be a girl in season seven. Barr explained: although originally the show baby was going to be a girl, she subsequently got pregnant in real life and, when they discovered it was going to be a boy, they changed the show baby to a boy.) The season starts when Dan decides to leave the security of his city job to help build the new prison being constructed outside of Lanford. With the pension, final check, and retirement money he receives for leaving his job he decides to give his family the vacation they never had and takes everyone to Walt Disney World. Beverly comes out to the family as a lesbian. The season climaxes with a very rushed wedding for Darlene. Immediately after the ceremony, realizing how much has been changing, Dan suffers a heart attack. In the next episode it is revealed that DJ saved his life. The season concludes with Dan and Roseanne having a bitter fight after Dan refuses to stick to his diet and exercise plan. They end up wrecking their living room in the process. The credits fade as Roseanne walks out on Dan. Other subjects are DJ's Thanksgiving pageant, Darlene's wedding, and Dan's heart attack.\n\nRoseanne wins the state lottery jackpot of $108 million; This allows her and her family to live the high life. In the season's final episode, Roseanne reveals that season nine is actually a story written by Roseanne Conner about her life. To cope, Roseanne twisted major elements of her life for the story, which the audience does not discover until the final moments of the series. In reality, Dan's heart attack near the end of Season 8 was fatal and the Conner family did not win the lottery. Also, Jackie is a lesbian and Beverly is straight. The series' original run ends with Roseanne writing her life story.\n\nThe television program was revived in 2018 on ABC, where it had originally aired, with all main cast including Roseanne Barr returning.\n\nThe events that Roseanne claimed were true in the final episode of season nine were retconned as being fictional elements of Roseanne's story: in the revival, Dan is still alive, the girls did not end up with the opposite romantic partners, the family did not win the lottery, and neither Jackie nor Beverly is a lesbian.\n\nRoseanne and Dan have lost weight, and Roseanne has been having knee pain for some time. Roseanne has stopped running her diner \"The Lunch Box\" and it does not appear to be in business at all; it is later revealed on an episode of \"The Conners\" to have been turned into a Chinese restaurant sometime after 1996. She is retired from any salaried job but, despite her bad knee which causes her great physical pain, works as an Uber driver.\n\nRoseanne's knee is such a focal point this season that there are entire episodes devoted to it: \"Roseanne Gets the Chair\", \"Netflix & Pill\", and \"Knee Deep\". There is also a storyline involving Roseanne taking opiate medication to ease the pain, and becoming addicted to the drug.\n\nRoseanne has three grandchildren; Darlene's children with David, daughter Harris and son Mark, and D.J.'s daughter Mary. D.J. is married to an active-duty military operative named Geena who is still serving; D.J. has also served in the military but he has been presumably honorably discharged. Becky has no children and her husband Mark died. Roseanne's younger son Jerry is explained away as living on a fishing boat.\n\nAmid other important plot points, near the end of the season Roseanne's knee becomes especially degenerated and she requires surgery. She and Dan are able to afford this after some lucky happenings.\n\nThe program was renewed for an eleventh season but the show was cancelled on May 29, 2018 after Barr made a remark that was viewed as racist on Twitter.\n\nThe following month, the other cast members and ABC came to a deal to create an entirely new program entitled \"The Conners\". In the series premiere in October 2018, it was revealed Roseanne Conner died from an accidental opiate overdose.\n\nHaving been killed off, Roseanne is not featured but is occasionally mentioned where she is revered for her leadership, or mourned in her absence.\n\nCritical reception of the character has been positive. In 2009, she was listed in the Top 5 Classic TV Moms by Film.com. In June 2010, \"Entertainment Weekly\" named Roseanne one of the \"100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years\". In May 2012, she was one of the 12 moms chosen by users of iVillage on their list of \"Mommy Dearest: The TV Moms You Love\". AOL named her the 11th Most Memorable Female TV Character. In May 2015, BuzzFeed posted the article \"26 Times Roseanne Was The Funniest TV Mom\". The relationship between Roseanne and Dan Conner has received praise. An article in the \"Sarasota Herald-Tribune\" called their relationship realistic, commenting that while they mock each other, viewers can feel their love while they deal with the kinds of problems real families face.\nFor her role as Roseanne, Barr won an Emmy, a Golden Globe, a Kids Choice Award, and three American Comedy Awards.\n"}
{"id": "2064472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064472", "title": "Moro Rock", "text": "Moro Rock\n\nMoro Rock is a granite dome rock formation in Sequoia National Park, California, United States. It is located in the center of the park, at the head of Moro Creek, between Giant Forest and Crescent Meadow. A stairway, designed by the National Park Service and built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps, is cut into and poured onto the rock, so that visitors can hike to the top. The view from the rock encompasses much of the Park, including the Great Western Divide. Use of this trail is discouraged during thunderstorms and when it is snowing.\n\nThe road to Moro Rock is closed in winter, so visitors need to hike 2 miles to reach the viewpoint. The road is open in summer so the hike is shortened. The 1996 general plan for the park calls for the road to Moro to be closed, and replaced by a shuttle. As of June 2012, the road is open to general traffic only during weekdays; on weekends, the shuttle is running and the road is closed to general traffic. The west face of Moro Rock offers 1,000 vertical feet of cracks and knobs for rock climbing. However, climbing is prohibited during peregrine falcon nesting season on the South and East faces(up to Full Metal Jacket).\n\nMoro Rock is a dome-shaped granite monolith. Common in the Sierra Nevada, these domes form by exfoliation, the spalling or casting off in scales, plates, or sheets of rock layers on otherwise unjointed granite. Outward expansion of the granite results in exfoliations. Expansion results from load relief; when the overburden that once capped the granite has eroded away, the source of compression is removed and the granite slowly expands. Fractures that form during exfoliation tend to cut corners. This ultimately results in rounded dome-like forms.\n\nThe first stairway leading to the summit of Moro Rock was constructed of wood and installed in 1917. This stairway deteriorated significantly by the late 1920s, and was replaced in 1931 by the present Moro Rock Stairway, built by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Unlike the earlier stairway, the new stairway adopted a design policy of blending with the natural surfaces to the greatest extent possible. The 797-foot-long stairway was designed by National Park Service landscape architect Merel S. Sager and engineer Frank Diehl, following natural ledges and crevices. It has 400 steps that lead to the summit of Moro Rock. Changes since the original construction have impaired the integrity of the design.\n\n"}

{"id": "2064488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064488", "title": "Social Democratic Party of Hungary", "text": "Social Democratic Party of Hungary\n\nThe Social Democratic Party of Hungary (, MSZDP) is a social democratic political party in Hungary. Historically, the party was dissolved during the occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany (1944-1945) and the communist period of Hungary from 1948 to 1989, after being forced into a merger with the Communist Party. It worked legally for a short time during the Revolution of 1956.\n\nIt was a government party as a part of the Károlyi Government (1918-1919), Berinkey Government, Peidl Government (1919), Interim National Assembly (1944-1945) and Dinnyés Government (1947-1948). It was reorganized after Hungary's transition from communism in 1989.\n\nMSZDP used to be a member of the Socialist International and the Party of European Socialists until 2020, when it was delisted from both due to inactivity.\n\nHungary as part of Austria-Hungary:\nHungary as an independent country:\n\nThe party grew in power and influence until the First World War, which resulted in the party fracturing into pro-war and anti-war factions. The chaos which followed the war resulted in the collapse of the Dual Monarchy. The MSZDP leadership entered into government as part of an unsuccessful post-war socialist administration and subsequently Béla Kun's Communist dictatorship, which carried out a Red Terror against the Hungarian people. When the Communist regime collapsed MSZDP supporters were killed in the subsequent anti-Communist backlash. The entire left-wing boycotted the elections of 1920, which resulted in a right-wing victory and continued right-wing government for the inter-war period.\n\nThe MSZDP made their peace with Miklós Horthy's government in 1921 with the Bethlen-Peyer pact. More radical elements were suppressed, and trade union activity was increasingly driven underground during the 1930s. After 1939, the party became known as the SZDP, dropping the \"Magyarországi\" moniker. The environment became increasingly hostile during the Second World War and activity virtually drained to a halt. With the Nazi takeover of Hungary in 1944, the party was declared illegal. Many of the leadership were executed, with the remainder imprisoned or driven underground.\n\nThe party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1940.\n\nThe MSZDP fought the election of November 1945, finishing in a strong second place. From 1945-1948, the MSZDP governed in association with the Smallholders' Party. They were placed under increasing pressure to merge with the Hungarian Communist Party. Eventually, the right-wing were forcibly excluded from the MSZDP - and this allowed the party to officially join the Soviet-sponsored Hungarian Working People's Party. With the establishment of the police state, members were increasingly pressured to co-operate with the Communists. The grouping became the largest party in 1947, but by the end of 1948 the MSZDP had ceased to function independently.\n\nThe MSZDP re-emerged defiantly in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Under the leadership of Anna Kéthly, Gyula Kelemen and József Fischer the MSZDP took a prominent role in Imre Nagy's Provisional Government. For the first time in many years the party newspaper \"Népszava\" was published independently. Following the suppression of the Revolution in 1956 and 1957, the MSZDP disappeared again under state repression, and much of the leadership escaped into exile.\n\nThe gradual softening of the official government policies in Hungary in the 1970s and 1980s led to many in the governing Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (MSZMP) being associated with Reform Communism. This was sometimes not easily distinguishable from social democracy.\n\nIn 1989 the MSZDP was re-founded, and took a prominent role in the transitional arrangements before the first elections. The MSZMP, now calling itself the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), started with a large base of members, plenty of financial resources and a core electorate. The MSZP and MSZDP were in competition for the same left-wing support.\n\nThe transition period was marked by chaos in the newly reformed MSZDP. There were many disagreements throughout 1989 regarding the direction of the MSZDP, and a breakaway was established in November 1989 as the \"Historical\" Social Democratic Party (SZDP or tSZDP). The SZDP claimed to be the ideological successor to the \"anti-communist\" MSZDP of 1945-1948 and 1956. Another breakaway party also emerged in 1989 - the Independent Social Democratic Party (FSZDP). The results of the 1990 elections under the leadership of Anna Petrasovits was a huge disappointment to the MSZDP, as the reconstituted party failed to reach the 5% parliamentary threshold. Following the replacement of Petrasovits, Endre Borbély and Zoltán Király held the position for a year respectively.\n\nFollowing the defeats in 1990 and 1994, the MSZDP has failed to cross the threshold into Parliament at every subsequent election. Whilst retaining its separate status, it has become even further linked to the MSZP. Its leader (since 1994), László Kapolyi, was elected to Parliament in 2002 as part of a joint MSZP–MSZDP ticket. Between 2002 and 2010, he sat with the MSZP in Parliament, as a normal MSZP MP, and after 2007 he was joined by Gábor Hárs, a 'defector' from the MSZP.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, further defections from the MSZP to the MSZDP in Óbuda and Zugló resulted in some pressure to more clearly define an independent social democratic perspective to differentiate the party from the MSZP. In response to this, László Kapolyi tried to prevent further defections from joining, under pressure from the MSZP's leadership. However, pressure from the remaining membership of the MSZDP has created tensions. In November 2009, a number of local MSZDP associations made autonomous decisions to form electoral alliances with the Green Left, regardless of the MSZDP's national leadership. Due to the leadership's close ties to the MSZP, the MSZDP was unable to capitalise upon the MSZP's growing unpopularity in the run-up to the 2010 Hungarian parliamentary election, and it was doubtful that it had a membership of more than 100 active subscribers.\n\nOn its 45th Congress on 8 October 2011, Kapolyi was re-elected as chairman, and Andor Schmuck was elected as general secretary. At the 46th Congress on 24 November 2012, long serving chairman Kapolyi was not running again for re-election, Schmuck was elected as his successor. On 26 May 2013, an attempt was made to officially dissolve the MSZDP, with a small successor party established as the Hungarian Social Democrats' Party (Szocdemek) under the leadership of Andor Schmuck whilst excluding former leader László Kapolyi. The decision of the Congress has since been challenged. Political opponents of Schmuck elected Kapolyi chairman again. The Social Democratic Party under Kapolyi participated in the 2014 general election, as well as Schmuck's new party, which took most of the members and large part of the infrastructure of the MSZDP. László Kapolyi died on 29 November 2014 after a long illness. Since 2014 there have been ongoing challenges to the legal status of the MSZDP, and its current legal status is unclear. The MSZDP did not participate in the 2018 general election. In 2020 MSZDP was delisted from the Party of European Socialists and the Socialist International due to inactivity.\n\n\"Party merged to Socialist Party of Hungary (1919)\"\n\"Party merged to Hungarian Working People's Party (1948–1956)\"\n\"Party disbanded (1956–1989)\"\n\n\n\n"}

She represented Minnesota's 6th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 2007 to 2015. The district includes St. Cloud and several of the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities.\n\nBachmann was a candidate for the Republican nomination in the 2012 U.S. presidential election, winning the Ames Straw Poll in August 2011 but dropping out in January 2012 after finishing in sixth place in the Iowa caucuses. She previously served in the Minnesota Senate and is the first Republican woman to represent Minnesota in Congress. She is a supporter of the Tea Party movement and a founder of the House Tea Party Caucus.\nBachmann was born Michele Marie Amble in Waterloo, Iowa, to Norwegian-American parents David John Amble (1929–2003) and Arlene Jean Amble (née Johnson) (born c. 1932). Two of her great-great-great-grandparents, Melchior and Martha Munson, emigrated from Sogndal, Norway, to Wisconsin in 1857. David was an engineer. Her family moved from Iowa to Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, when she was 13 years old. After her parents divorced when she was 14, David moved to California and remarried. Bachmann was raised by her mother, who worked at the First National Bank in Anoka, Minnesota, where they moved again. Three years later her mother married widower Raymond J. LaFave; the new marriage resulted in a family with nine children.\n\nBachmann graduated from Anoka High School in 1974 and, after graduation, spent one summer working at kibbutz Be'eri in Israel. In 1978 she graduated from Winona State University with a B.A.\n\nIn 1979 Bachmann was a member of the first class of the O. W. Coburn School of Law, then a part of Oral Roberts University (ORU). There she studied with John Eidsmoe, whom she described in 2011 as \"one of the professors who had a great influence on me\". Bachmann worked as a research assistant on Eidsmoe's 1987 book \"Christianity and the Constitution\", which argues that the United States was founded as a Christian theocracy and should become one again. In 1986 Bachmann received a J.D. degree from Oral Roberts University. She was a member of the ORU law school's final graduating class, and was part of a group of faculty, staff, and students who moved the ORU law school library to what is now Regent University.\n\nIn 1988 Bachmann received an LL.M. degree in tax law from William & Mary Law School. From 1988 to 1993 she worked as an attorney for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). She left the IRS to become a full-time mother when her fourth child was born.\n\nBachmann grew up in a Democratic family and has said she became a Republican during her senior year at Winona State. She told the \"Star Tribune\" that she was reading Gore Vidal's 1973 novel \"Burr\": \"He was kind of mocking the Founding Fathers and I just thought—I just remember reading the book, putting it in my lap, looking out the window and thinking, 'You know what? I don't think I am a Democrat. I must be a Republican.\n\nWhile still a Democrat, she and her then fiancé Marcus were inspired to join the pro-life movement by Francis Schaeffer's 1976 Christian documentary film \"How Should We Then Live?\" They prayed outside of clinics and engaged in sidewalk counseling, a pro-life protest activity in which activists approach women entering abortion clinics in an attempt to dissuade them from obtaining abortions. Since then Bachmann has made statements supportive of sidewalk counseling. Bachmann supported Jimmy Carter for president in 1976, and she and her husband worked on his campaign. During Carter's presidency, Bachmann became disappointed with his liberal approach to public policy, support for legalized abortion and economic decisions she held responsible for increased gas prices. In the 1980 presidential election she voted for Ronald Reagan and worked for his campaign.\n\nBachmann's political activism gained media attention at a pro-life protest in 1991. She and approximately 30 other pro-life citizens went to a Ramsey County Board meeting where $3 million was to be appropriated to build a morgue for the county at St. Paul-Ramsey Medical Center (now Regions Hospital). The Medical Center performed abortions and employed pro-choice activist Jane Hodgson. Bachmann attended the meeting to protest public tax dollars going to the hospital; speaking to the \"Star Tribune\", she said that \"in effect, since 1973, I have been a landlord of an abortion clinic, and I don't like that distinction\".\n\nIn 1993 Bachmann and other parents started the K-12 New Heights Charter School in Stillwater. The publicly funded school's charter mandated that it be non-sectarian in all programs and practices, but the school soon developed a strong Christian orientation. Parents of students at the school complained and the superintendent of schools warned Bachmann that the school was in violation of state law. Six months after the school's founding Bachmann resigned and the Christian orientation was removed from the curriculum, allowing the school to keep its charter. Bachmann began speaking against a state-mandated set of educational standards, which propelled her into the world of politics.\n\nBachmann became a critic and opponent of Minnesota's School-to-Work policies. In a 1999 column she wrote, \"School-to-Work alters the basic mission and purpose of K-12 academic education away from traditional broad-based academic studies geared toward maximizing intellectual achievement of the individual. Instead, School-to-Work utilizes the school day to promote children's acquisition of workplace skills, viewing children as trainees for increased economic productivity.\"\n\nIn November 1999 Bachmann and four other Republicans were candidates, as the \"Slate of Five\", in an election for the school board of Stillwater. All five lost.\n\nIn 2000 Bachmann defeated 18-year incumbent Gary Laidig for the Republican nomination for state senator in Minnesota District 56. In the general election she defeated Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) nominee Ted Thompson and Minnesota Independence Party Lyno Sullivan. In 2002, after redistricting due to the 2000 Census, Bachmann defeated another incumbent, DFL State Senator Jane Krentz, in the newly drawn State Senate District 52. Bachmann's agenda as a state senator focused on opposition to abortion and gay marriage.\n\nOn November 20, 2003, Bachmann and Representative Mary Liz Holberg proposed a constitutional amendment that would bar the state from legally recognizing same-sex marriage. In 2004 Bachmann and a coalition of religious leaders announced plans for a \"Minnesota for Marriage\" rally. Her effort to place a marriage amendment on a referendum ballot in 2004 failed. She resurrected the proposal in March 2005, but it stalled indefinitely in a senate committee that April.\n\nIn November 2004 Republican Senate Minority Leader Dick Day appointed Bachmann Assistant Minority Leader in charge of policy of the Senate Republican Caucus. In July 2005 the Republican Caucus removed her from her leadership position. Bachmann said that disagreements with Day over her anti-tax stance were the reason for her ouster.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2015 Bachmann represented , which includes the northernmost and eastern suburbs of the Twin Cities and St. Cloud. She is the first Republican woman to be elected to the U.S. House from Minnesota.\n\nIn January 2007 a resolution was approved in the House of Representatives opposing President George W. Bush's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq. Bachmann voted \"No\". But before supporting the proposed surge, Bachmann called for a full hearing, saying, \"The American people deserve to hear and understand the merits of increasing U.S. troop presence in Iraq. Increased troop presence is justifiable if that measure would bring a swift conclusion to a difficult conflict.\" She hesitated to give a firm endorsement, calling the hearings \"a good first step in explaining to the American people the course toward victory in Iraq\". When pressed, she said she had not come to any conclusion on the matter, saying, \"I don't believe we have all of the information in front of us. As a member of Congress that's why I want to go to Iraq as quickly as I can. I want to get the best information in front of me.\"\n\nIn July 2007 Bachmann joined a Congressional delegation visiting Ireland, Germany, Pakistan, Kuwait, and Iraq. She met briefly (due to security concerns) with U.S. personnel in the Green Zone and upon her return said she \"was encouraged by reports of progress from Crocker, General David Petraeus and other personnel in Iraq linked to the surge\". She said the surge \"hasn't had a chance to be in place long enough to offer a critique of how it's working. [Petraeus] said al-Qaida in Iraq is off its plan and we want to keep it that way. The surge has only been fully in place for a week or so.\"\n\nBachmann also spoke of the delegation's visit to Islamabad to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Aziz at the same time as the siege of Islamic fundamentalists at the Lal Masjid mosque elsewhere in the city. She reported, \"The group [of U.S. Legislators] had to travel in armored vehicles and was constantly accompanied by Pakistani military ... We were all able to see extremely up close and personal what it's like to be in a region where fighting is occurring. We constantly felt like we were in need of security.\" Bachmann told reporters upon her return that \"the dangers posed by Islamic terrorism in Iraq, Britain and Pakistan justified the continued American military presence in Iraq.\" She said, \"We don't want to see al-Qaida get a presence in the United States. Al-Qaida doesn't seem to show any signs of letting up. We have to keep that in mind.\"\n\nOn July 11, 2007, Bachmann voted against the College Cost Reduction and Access Act that raised the maximum Pell grant from $4,310 to $5,200, lower interest rates on subsidized student loans to 3.4 percent from 6.8 percent, raise loan limits to $30,500 from $7,500, disfavor married students who file joint tax returns, provide more favorable repayment terms to students who fail to use their education to prosper financially and favor public sector over private sector workers with much more favorable loan forgiveness benefits. Supporters of the bill said \"it would allow more students to attend college\". Bachmann said her opposition was because \"it fails students and taxpayers with gimmicks, hidden costs and poorly targeted aid. It contains no serious reform of existing programs, and it favors the costly, government-run direct lending program over nonprofit and commercial lenders.\" The bill passed the House and was signed by President Bush.\n\nDuring the summer of 2008, as national gasoline prices rose to over $4 a gallon, Bachmann became a leading Congressional advocate for increased domestic oil and natural gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and the Outer Continental Shelf. She joined ten other House Republicans and members of the media on a Congressional Energy Tour to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, and to Alaska. The trip was set up by Arctic Power, an Alaskan lobbying group that advocates for ANWR development. Its purpose was to receive a firsthand account of emerging renewable energy technologies and the prospects of increased domestic oil and natural gas production in Alaska, including ANWR.\n\nBachmann has said that global warming is \"all voodoo, nonsense, hokum, a hoax\" and has been called \"one of the GOP's loudest global warming skeptics\". She has said that because life requires carbon dioxide and it is part of the planet's life cycle, it cannot be harmful. On the House floor on Earth Day, April 22, 2009, Bachmann said she opposed cap and trade climate legislation: \"Carbon dioxide is not a harmful gas, it is a harmless gas. Carbon dioxide is natural; it is not harmful ... We're being told we have to reduce this natural substance to create an arbitrary reduction in something that is naturally occurring in the earth.\"\n\nIn March 2008 Bachmann introduced H.R. 849, the Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act. The bill would have repealed two sections of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 signed into law by George W. Bush. The 2007 Energy Act mandates energy efficiency and labeling standards for incandescent and fluorescent bulbs. Bachmann's bill would have required the Government Accountability Office to show that a change to fluorescent bulbs would have \"clear economic, health and environmental benefits\" before enforcing lighting efficiency regulations. The bill would have allowed these standards to remain in place if the comptroller general found they would lead to consumer savings, reduce carbon-dioxide emissions and pose no health risks to consumers (such as risks posed by the presence of mercury in fluorescent bulbs). The bill languished in the House and became inactive at the end of the 110th Congress. Bachmann reintroduced the bill in March 2011.\n\nOn June 3, 2008, President Bush signed the Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification Act (H.R. 4008) into law. The bipartisan bill, which Bachmann cosponsored with Congressman Tim Mahoney (D-Fla.), removes statutory damages for violations of a 2003 federal law prohibiting merchants from printing consumers' credit card numbers and expiration dates on sales receipts, in order to end class-action lawsuits aimed at businesses that violated the law.\n\nBachmann opposed both versions of the Wall Street bailout bill for America's financial sector. She voted against the first proposed $700 billion bailout of financial institutions, which failed to pass, 205–228. She also advocated breaking up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and barring executives from excessive compensation or golden parachutes, and advocated a plan that would suspend mark-to-market accounting rules and suspend the capital gains tax.\n\nThe American auto companies approached Congress to ask for roughly $15 billion in loans to keep them operational into 2009. Bachmann criticized that bill, fearing that the initial sum of money would be followed by subsequent ones without the companies making changes to revive their business. Bachmann supported an alternative plan for American auto companies and the rest of the auto industry that would have set benchmarks for reducing their debt and renegotiating labor deals and have set up the financial assistance as interim insurance instead of a taxpayer-financed bailout.\n\nOn October 17, 2008, Bachmann gave an interview on MSNBC's \"Hardball with Chris Matthews\" in support of the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain that brought the Minnesota 6th Congressional District race national attention. During the interview she criticized Barack Obama for his association with Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers, saying, \"usually we associate with people who have similar ideas to us, and it seems that it calls into question what Barack Obama's true beliefs, and values, and thoughts are ... I am very concerned that he [Obama] may have anti-American views.\" She noted the bombing campaign orchestrated by Bill Ayers before discussing his association with Obama, arguing that \"Bill Ayers is not someone the average American wants to see their president have an association with.\" Matthews followed up by asking \"But he <nowiki>[Obama]</nowiki> is a Senator from the state of Illinois; he's one of the members of Congress you suspect of being anti-American. How many people in the Congress of the United States do you think are anti-American? You've already suspected Barack Obama; is he alone or are there others?\" Bachmann answered, \"What I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating exposé and take a look ... I wish they would ... I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out are they pro-America, or anti-America. I think people would love to see an exposé like that.\"\n\nIn response, the five Democratic members of Minnesota's congressional delegation—Tim Walz, Betty McCollum, Keith Ellison, Collin Peterson and Jim Oberstar—issued a joint statement questioning Bachmann's ability to \"work in a bipartisan way to put the interests of our country first in this time of crisis\". Former Secretary of State Colin Powell and former Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson said her comments had influenced their decisions to endorse Obama for president.\n\nBachmann brought up the interview before business leaders and Republicans during a campaign stop in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on October 21, 2008. She said she never intended to question Obama's patriotism. \"I made a misstatement. I said a comment that I would take back. I did not, nor do I, question Barack Obama's patriotism ... I did not say that Barack Obama is anti-American nor do I believe that Barack Obama is anti-American ... [But] I'm very concerned about Barack Obama's views. I don't believe that socialism is a good thing for America.\" At a March 2010 fund-raiser for the Susan B. Anthony List, Bachmann said, \"I said I had very serious concerns that Barack Obama had anti-American views—and now I look like Nostradamus\". In March 2011 she was asked on \"Meet the Press\" whether she still believed that Obama held un-American views. She responded, \"I believe that the actions of this government have—have been emblematic of ones that have not been based on true American values.\" Pressed for clarification, she said, \"I've already answered that question before. I said I had very serious concerns about the president's views.\"\n\nOn March 26, 2009, following comments by China proposing adoption of a global reserve currency, Bachmann introduced a resolution calling for a Constitutional amendment to bar the dollar from being replaced by a foreign currency. Current law prohibits foreign currency from being recognized in the U.S., but Bachmann expressed concerns relating to the president's power to make and interpret treaties. Earlier that month, at a Financial Services Committee hearing, Bachmann asked both Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke whether they would reject calls for the U.S. to move away from the U.S. dollar and they replied that they would.\n\nIn a June 17, 2009, interview with \"The Washington Times\", Bachmann expressed concern that the questions on the 2010 United States Census had become \"very intricate, very personal\" and that ACORN, a community organizing group that had come under fire the previous year, might be part of the Census Bureau's door-to-door information collection efforts. She said, \"I know, for my family, the only question we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that.\" According to Politifact, her statement was incorrect, as the Constitution does require citizens to complete the census. Fellow Republican Representatives Patrick McHenry (N.C.), Lynn Westmoreland (Ga.) and John Mica (Fla.), members of the Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census and National Archives, which oversees the census, subsequently asked Bachmann not to boycott the population count.\n\nAlong with Congressman Ted Poe (Tex.-02), Bachmann introduced the American Community Survey Act to limit the amount of personal information the U.S. Census Bureau solicits. She reiterated her belief that the census asked too many personal questions.\n\nIn March 2009 Bachmann was interviewed by the Northern Alliance Radio Network and promoted two forums she was hosting the next month in St. Cloud and Woodbury about Obama's proposed cap-and-trade tax policy to limit greenhouse gas emissions. She said she wanted Minnesotans \"armed and dangerous on this issue of the energy tax because we need to fight back.\" Bachmann's office quickly clarified that she was speaking metaphorically, meaning \"armed with knowledge\". According to the \"Star Tribune\", her quote went viral across the Internet.\n\nIn 2009 Bachmann became a critic of what she characterized as proposals for mandatory public service. Of the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, an expansion to AmeriCorps (a federal community service organization), she said in April:\nThe original bill called for an exploration of whether a mandatory public service program could be established, but the section on creating a \"Congressional Commission on Civic Service\" was stripped from the bill.\n\nIn August 2009 Bachmann's political opponents publicized in the local media and the blogosphere what they described as the \"ironic\" fact that her son, Harrison, joined Teach for America, part of the AmeriCorps program.\n\nBachmann contributed to the \"death panel\" controversy when she read from a July 24 article by Betsy McCaughey on the House floor. Sarah Palin said that her \"death panel\" remark was inspired by what she called the \"Orwellian\" opinions of Ezekiel Emanuel as described by Bachmann, who accused him of advocating health care rationing by age and disability. According to \"PolitiFact\" and \"Time\", Bachmann's euthanasia remarks distorted Emanuel's position on health care for the elderly and disabled. FactCheck.org stated, \"We agree that Emanuel's meaning is being twisted.\" When many doctors wanted to legalize euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, Emanuel opposed it.\n\nOn August 31, 2009, Bachmann spoke at an event in Colorado, saying of Democratic health care overhaul proposals that: She outlined ideas for changing the health care system, including: \"Erase the boundaries around every single state when it comes to health care\", enabling consumers to purchase insurance across state lines; increase the use of health savings accounts and allow everyone to \"take full deductibility of all medical expenses\", including insurance premiums; and tort reform.\n\nBachmann denounced the government-run health insurance public option, calling it a \"government takeover of health care\" that would \"squeeze out private health insurance\".\n\nIn a November 3, 2010, interview with Anderson Cooper, while discussing spending cuts for Medicare and Social Security suggested by Representative Paul Ryan, Bachmann was asked what spending cuts she would make to reduce the deficit. She cited President Obama's then-upcoming visit to Asia as an example, saying it \"is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day. He's taking two thousand people with him. He'll be renting out over 870 rooms in India. And these are 5-star hotel rooms at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel. This is the kind of over-the-top spending—it's a very small example, Anderson.\" Bachmann was apparently referring to information in a story from the Press Trust of India, attributed to \"a top official of the Maharashtra Government privy to the arrangements for the high-profile visit\", information that was also published in U.S.-based media such as The Drudge Report. A Pentagon spokesman, Geoff Morrell, dismissed the report's claim that 34 warships were accompanying the President as \"comical\". The White House said that the press report figures were \"wildly inflated\" and had \"no basis in reality\". While stating that they could not give the actual projected figures for security reasons, staffers maintained costs were in line with the official travel costs of previous presidents Bush and Clinton.\n\nAfter the 2010 elections and Representative Mike Pence's announcement that he was stepping away from his leadership position in the House, Bachmann announced her intention to seek the position of House Republican Conference Chair. As Bachmann was the founder of the House's Tea Party Caucus, her announcement caused some to see the leadership election as \"an early test of how GOP leaders will treat the antiestablishment movement's winners\". Many among the House's Republican leadership, including Eric Cantor and the retiring Pence, were quick to endorse Representative Jeb Hensarling for the position; Speaker-to-be John Boehner remained neutral on the issue. Supporters of Bachmann's run included Representatives Steve King, John Kline, Louie Gohmert, Chip Cravaack, and Erik Paulsen, as well as media personality and political commentator Glenn Beck. Listing her qualifications for the position, Bachmann noted, \"I've done an effective job speaking out at a national and local level, motivating people with our message, calling attention to deficits in Obama's policy. I was instrumental in bringing tens of thousands of people to the U.S. capitol to rally against Obama care and to attend our press conference.\" She noted her work to keep the Tea Party within the GOP rather than having it become a third party, thereby helping the party capture the House, saying, \"I have been able to bring a voice and motivate people to, in effect, put that gavel in John Boehner's hands, so that Republicans can lead going forward. …It's important that leadership represents the choice of the people coming into our caucus….I think I have motivated a high number of people to get involved in this cycle who may have sat it out and that have made a difference on a number of these races. I gave a large amount of money to NRCC and individual candidates and started Michele PAC, which raised $650,000 for members since July, so I was able to financially help about 50 people out.\"\n\nBachmann's bid suffered a setback when she was passed over for the GOP's transition team on which Hensarling was placed. Despite Bachmann's leading all other Representatives in fundraising, a Republican aide said some \"members are getting resentful of Bachmann, who they say is making the argument that you're not really a Tea Party supporter unless you support her. That's gone through the formation of the Tea Party Caucus and the formation of this candidacy of hers. It's just not so.\" Sarah Palin, with whom Bachmann had campaigned earlier in the year, declined to endorse her leadership bid, while other Tea Party favorites, Representatives Adam Kinzinger and Tim Scott, were placed on the transition team. According to some senior House staff members, the party leadership was concerned about some of Bachmann's high-profile faux pas, the high rate of turnover among her staff, and how willing she would be to advance the party's messaging rather than her own.\n\nOn November 10 Bachmann released a statement ending her campaign for Conference Chair and giving Hensarling her \"enthusiastic\" support.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner selected Bachmann for a position \"on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, giving her a new role as overseer of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the rest of the U.S. intelligence community.\" Bachmann, who had \"not served on any committee that deals with foreign policy issues\" requested the position, \"a move that has fueled speculation that she may be planning to carry the Tea Party banner into the GOP presidential primaries.\"\n\nSoon after beginning her third term, Bachmann introduced legislation to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. She said, \"I'm pleased to offer a full repeal of the job-killing Dodd-Frank financial regulatory bill. Dodd-Frank grossly expanded the federal government beyond its jurisdictional boundaries. It gave Washington bureaucrats the power to interpret and enforce the legislation with little oversight. Real financial regulatory reform must deal with these lenders who were a leading cause of our economic recession. True reform must also end the bailout mind-set that was perpetuated by the last Congress.\" She also took issue with the law for not addressing the liabilities of the tax-payer funded Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Bachmann's bill was endorsed by conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and Americans for Prosperity. It gained four other Republican co-sponsors, including Representative Darrell Issa, who became the new chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee at the start of the 112th Congress. Bachmann's call for total repeal was seen as more drastic than the approach advocated by her fellow Republican Spencer Bachus, who became the House Financial Services Committee Chairman when Republicans gained the House majority. Bachus planned \"to provide 'vigorous' oversight of regulators efforts to reform banking and housing ... reform Fannie and Freddie\", and \"dismantle pieces of [the] Dodd-Frank Act that he believes 'unnecessarily punish small businesses and community banks.'\" In response to Bachmann's legislation Representative Barney Frank said, \"Michele Bachmann, the Club for Growth, and others in the right-wing coalition have now made their agenda for the financial sector very clear: they yearn to return to the thrilling days of yesteryear, so the loan arrangers can ride again—untrammeled by any rules restraining irresponsibility, excess, deception, and most of all, infinite leverage.\" It was seen as unlikely that Bachmann's legislation would pass, with the \"Financial Times\" writing, \"Like the Republican move to repeal healthcare reform, Ms. Bachmann's bill could be passed by the House of Representatives but be blocked by the Senate or White House.\"\n\nBachmann responded to Obama's 2011 State of the Union speech on the Tea Party Express website; her speech was broadcast live by CNN. She insisted that her response was not intended to counter Paul Ryan's official Republican party response. When asked whether the speech was an indication of competition with Ryan and Boehner's leadership team, Bachmann dismissed such a view as \"a fiction of the media\", saying she had alerted Ryan and the leadership team that her response might go national and that no objections were raised.\n\nBachmann continually called for repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). She recalled to reporters that she called for debate to repeal the act \"the morning after Obamacare passed\". With Steve King she introduced \"the Bachmann-King repeal of health care bill\", saying that it \"is our intent in our heart to make sure that Obamacare is completely repealed.\" In light of the Democratic-majority Senate's and Obama's opposition to repeal, Bachmann called on the Republican held House of Representatives not to provide any funds for implementation of the act. \"But until we can see that [repeal] happen, we want to fully defund this bill so that, like, it would be akin to a helium balloon that gets no helium inside so that it can't take off the ground, and that's what we're planning to do. I'm very, very grateful for nothing else; having a majority in the House of Representatives so that we have the ability of the power of the purse to not fund Obamacare, and this is exactly the right way to go\", she said.\n\nOn March 4, 2011, Bachmann, one of the six House Republicans to vote against the continuing resolution that gave a two-week extension until a possible government shutdown, expressed her unhappiness with its passage.\n\nIn an appearance on \"Meet the Press\" on March 6 and during a March 7 interview with Sean Hannity, Bachmann declared that the Obama administration and Congressional Democrats had hidden $105 billion in spending in the overhaul of the American Health Care System. She portrayed the Democratic leadership as timing the release of the bill's text to avoid detection of the spending. \"We didn't get the bill until a literally couple of hours before we were supposed to vote on it\", she said. She also said the spending was split up within different portions of the bill to mask its total cost. Bachmann was alerted of the situation by the conservative Heritage Foundation which read the tallies of the Congressional Research Service and Congressional Budget Office.\n\nAccording to some reports of the costs, \"about $40 billion would go to the Children's Health Insurance Program, $15 billion would go to Medicare and Medicaid innovation programs, and $9.5 billion would go to the Community Health Centers Fund.\" As the funds are designated mandatory spending (not controlled by the annual appropriations acts), the funds would have remained even if the move to defund the reform law had succeeded.\n\nBachmann stated that $16 billion of the money gives Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius a \"slush fund ... [to do] whatever she wants with this money.\" She called on the bills supporters to return the money, \"I think this deception that the president and [former House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi and [Senate Majority Leader Harry] Reid put forward with appropriating over $105 billion needs to be given back to the people.\"\n\nWhen asked during the Meet the Press interview if she would take back her previous comments that Obama \"may have anti-American views\" and that his administration had \"embraced something called gangster government\", Bachmann backed her statements, saying \"I do believe that actions that have been taken by this White House—I don't take back my statements on gangster government. I think that there have been actions taken by the government that are corrupt ... I said I have very serious concerns about the president's views, and I think the president's actions in the last two years speak for themselves.\"\n\nIn response to Bachmann's charges Chief Deputy Democratic Whip Rep. Jan Schakowsky, who served on the House health subcommittee, pointed out that the report Bachmann refers to is an update of a report that came out in October 2010 and that the costs were spelled out in both the bill and the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of its cost, \"Michele Bachmann obviously didn't read the bill, because there was absolutely nothing hidden in that legislation.\" Schakowsky held that the costs were not kept secret, citing the $40 billion for the Children's Health Insurance Program as an example \"There was a robust debate about whether or not that should be included, etc. So this idea of somehow, now at the last minute, there was a secret addition to some kind of funding ... is absolute nonsense.\"\n\nIn a September 2011 Republican presidential debate in Tampa, FL, Bachmann criticized Rick Perry for his support for the humanpapilloma virus (HPV) vaccine and his support for mandating the HPV vaccine for all sixth-grade Texas girls. The American Academy of Pediatrics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and other medical organizations worldwide are in favor of immunizing girls and boys against HPV. HPV can cause lesions and genital warts, and has been linked to cervical cancer as well as genital and oral cancers in people of any gender. Because the vaccine is effective only if given before the onset of sexual activity and subsequent exposure to the virus, medical groups recommend the three dose vaccine be given to 11- and 12-year-olds. Bachmann, during the debate and in interviews following the event, accused Perry of \"crony capitalism\" (because Perry's former chief of staff was chief lobbyist for a drug company manufacturing the vaccine), and claimed that the HPV vaccine was dangerous and caused mental retardation. She repeatedly referred to an anecdotal account from a mother of a girl who been immunized for HPV. \"She told me that her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered mental retardation thereafter,\" Bachmann said. \"There is no second chance for these little girls if there is any dangerous consequences to their bodies.\" Shortly after Bachmann's statements at the debate, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement: \"The American Academy of Pediatrics would like to correct false statements made in the Republican presidential campaign that HPV vaccine is dangerous and can cause mental retardation. There is absolutely no scientific validity to this statement. Since the vaccine has been introduced, more than 35 million doses have been administered, and it has an excellent safety record.\" Fewer than one percent of those receiving the vaccine reported neurological side effects or, in rare cases, severe allergic reactions, none linked to changes in cognitive ability. Bachmann later acknowledged that she was not a doctor or a scientist.\n\nIn June–July 2012, Bachmann and several other Republican legislators sent a series of letters to oversight agencies at five federal departments citing \"serious security concerns\" about what Bachmann has called a \"deep penetration in the halls of our United States government\" by the Muslim Brotherhood. They requested formal investigations into what Bachmann called \"influence operations\" by the Brotherhood.\n\nBachmann also accused Huma Abedin, an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Rep. Anthony Weiner's wife, of having family connections to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nBachmann's comments have drawn what the \"Washington Post\" calls \"fierce criticism from fellow lawmakers and religious groups.\" In a speech on the Senate floor, 2008 Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain denounced Bachmann's charges as \"specious and degrading\". He defended Abedin as a \"hard-working and loyal servant of our country and our government\" and stated \"these attacks on Huma have no logic, no basis and no merit. They need to stop now.\" House Speaker John Boehner termed Bachmann's allegations \"dangerous\", and other Republicans have also criticized the remarks.\n\nIn a letter to Bachmann, her colleague Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., a Muslim, asked for evidence backing her claims and stated, \"Your response simply rehashes claims that have existed for years on anti-Muslim websites and contains no reliable information that the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated the U.S. government\".\n\nBachmann replied that \"the intention of the letters was to outline the serious national security concerns I had and ask for answers to questions regarding the Muslim Brotherhood and other radical group's access to top Obama administration officials\". In a July 19 interview with radio and TV show host Glenn Beck, Bachmann repeated and expanded her allegations, accusing Ellison of having \"a long record of being associated with the Council on American–Islamic Relations and with the Muslim Brotherhood\". Ellison replied that \"I am not now, nor have I ever been, associated with the Muslim Brotherhood.\"\n\nIn 2013, Bachmann was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee, the Federal Election Commission, the Iowa Senate Ethics Committee, the Urbandale Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation because of alleged campaign finance violations in her 2012 campaign for president.\n\nIt is alleged that members of her staff made under-the-table payments, that funds were illegally transferred from her leadership PAC to pay consultants for her presidential campaign and that hidden payments were made to Iowa State Senator Kent Sorenson.\n\nAdditionally, a lawsuit was filed alleging that Bachmann and several former staffers stole and misused an Iowa homeschool group's e-mail distribution list. The trial, \"Heki v. Bachmann\", had been set for May 14, 2014, but the case was settled out of court on June 28, 2013.\n\nOn July 26, 2013, the House Ethics Committee announced they were conducting a full investigation of Bachmann, saying that they had received a referral from the Office of Congressional Ethics.\n\nOn May 29, 2013, Bachmann announced that she would not seek re-election to her Congressional seat in 2014. Bachmann stated in an interview with Fox News in June 2013 that she was \"not going silent,\" and would remain involved in politics. She did not rule out a future run for office, or even for the White House. With her retirement from Congress, the ethics investigations against her were dropped.\nBachmann indicated, during a December 2017 New Year's weekend interview with televangelist Jim Bakker, that she had considered running for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Al Franken, but that she was awaiting God's counsel before making up her mind.\n\n\nAccording to an article in the \"Stillwater Gazette\", a local newspaper in Minnesota, Bachmann supports the teaching of creationism alongside evolution in public school science classes. During a 2003 interview on the KKMS Christian radio program \"Talk The Walk\", Bachmann said that evolution is a theory that has never been proven one way or the other. She co-authored a bill (that received no additional endorsement among her fellow legislators) that would require public schools to include alternative explanations for the origin of life as part of the state's public school science curricula.\nIn October 2006, Bachmann told a debate audience in St. Cloud, Minnesota \"there is a controversy among scientists about whether evolution is a fact or not ... There are hundreds and hundreds of scientists, many of them holding Nobel Prizes, who believe in intelligent design.\" However, at least one news report, presenting a \"sampling of Bachmann's ... ludicrous or plain old false claims\", stated that this was untrue, and that \"when the science isn't on [Bachmann's] side, she simply improvises.\"\n\nBachmann has praised the Christian youth ministry You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International (YCRBYCH), hailing \"the group's work of sharing the gospel in public schools\". She appeared as a keynote speaker at their fundraisers in 2006 and 2009. Following a 2011 controversial invocation for the Minnesota House, Bradlee Dean (the founder of YCRBYCH), declared that criticisms of him and his ministry were also \"intended to harm and destroy the presidential campaign of Congresswoman Michele Bachmann ... [who] previously praised and prayed for the work of my ministry\".\n\nBachmann has had a history of opposing anti-bullying legislation. In 2006, she told the Minnesota Legislature that passing an anti-bullying bill would be a waste of time. \"I think for all of us, our experience in public schools is there have always been bullies,\" Bachmann said. \"Always have been, always will be. I just don't know how we're ever going to get to the point of zero tolerance ... What does it mean? ... Will we be expecting boys to be girls?\"\n\nIn the Minnesota Senate, Bachmann opposed minimum wage increases. In an interview in late June 2011, Bachmann did not back away from her earlier proposal to eliminate the federal minimum wage, a change she said would \"virtually wipe out unemployment.\"\n\nIn a 2001 flyer, Bachmann and Michael J. Chapman wrote that federal policies manage a centralized, state-controlled economy in the United States. She wrote that education laws passed by Congress in 2001, including \"School To Work\" and \"Goals 2000\", created a new national school curriculum that embraced \"a socialist, globalist worldview; loyalty to all government and not America.\" In 2003, Bachmann said that the \"Tax Free Zones\" economic initiatives of Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty were based on the Marxist principle of \"from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.\" She also said that the administration was attempting to govern and run centrally planned economies through an organization called the Minnesota Economic Leadership Team (MELT), an advisory board on economic and workforce policy chaired by Pawlenty.\nPrior to her election to the state senate, and again in 2005, Bachmann signed a \"no new taxes\" pledge sponsored by the Taxpayers League of Minnesota. As a state senator, Bachmann introduced two bills that would have severely limited state taxation. In 2003, she proposed amending the Minnesota state constitution to adopt the \"Taxpayers' Bill of Rights\" (TABOR).\n\nIn 2005, Bachmann opposed Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty's proposal for a state surcharge of 75 cents per pack on the wholesale cost of cigarettes. Bachmann said that she opposed the state surcharge \"100 percent—it's a tax increase.\" She later was criticized by the Taxpayers' League for reversing her position and voting in favor of the cigarette surcharge.\n\nShe promised to bring the price of gasoline down to $2 per gallon, without specifying a plan for how to accomplish this.\n\nBachmann supports increased domestic drilling of oil and natural gas, as well as pursuing renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar. She is a strong proponent of nuclear power.\n\nBachmann has stated a strong opposition toward the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), pledging at an August 2011 campaign rally, \"... I guarantee you the EPA will have doors locked and lights turned off and they will only be about conservation.\" In 2007 and 2010, Bachmann was actively soliciting for funds from the EPA on behalf of constituents in her congressional district.\n\nBachmann has called for phasing out Social Security and Medicare:\n\nBachmann has said that in dealing with Iran, diplomacy \"is our option\", but that other options, including a nuclear strike, should not be ruled out.\n\nShe has also said that she is \"a longtime supporter of Israel\".\n\nIn a discussion about the G-20 summit in Toronto, during an interview with conservative radio host Scott Hennen, Bachmann stated that she did not want America to be part of the international global economy.\n\nOn economists who have influenced her views, Bachmann told \"The Wall Street Journal\",\n\nBachmann believes that strengthened enforcement of immigration laws is required for the growth of the American job market. She supports amending the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow only the immediate family of legal immigrants (not extended family members) priority consideration in the immigration process. She voted against the DREAM Act. She has also stated that the current law does not need modification but proper enforcement.\n\nBachmann said: \"... the immigration system in the United States worked very, very well up until the mid-1960s when liberal members of Congress changed the immigration laws.\"\n\nBachmann has expressed support for immigration of highly skilled professionals such as chemists and engineers.\n\nShe was against the 2013 immigration reform bill, indicating that passing it would mean the end of the Republican Party. On WorldNetDaily she stated \"This is President Obama's number one political agenda because he knows we will never again have a Republican president ever if amnesty goes into effect.\"\n\nBachmann supports both a federal and state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage and any legal equivalents.\n\nIn August 2006 the Minneapolis \"Star Tribune\" reported that in March 2006 Bachmann was on a Minneapolis radio show advocating a state constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. A caller asked her to explain how he, a heterosexual, would be harmed if his gay neighbors were allowed to marry. Bachmann replied by saying: \"Public schools would have to teach that homosexuality and same-sex marriage are normal, natural and that maybe children should try them.\" The \"Star Tribune\" also reported that Bachmann had publicly called homosexuality \"sexual dysfunction\", \"sexual identity disorders\", and \"personal enslavement\" that leads to \"sexual anarchy\".\n\nIn a July 2014 radio interview Bachmann claimed that gay rights activists want to abolish age of consent laws in the United States so that adults can \"prey on little children sexually.\"\n\nBachmann has identified herself as pro-life and has been endorsed in her runs for Congress by the Susan B. Anthony List and Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life. At a debate among presidential candidates in New Hampshire, when asked if abortion should be allowed in cases of rape or incest, Bachmann responded that she is \"100 percent pro-life\". In the state senate Bachmann introduced a bill proposing a constitutional amendment restricting state funds for abortion. The bill died in committee.\n\nAccording to an article in the \"Washington Post\", in 2008 Bachmann may have taken advantage of a federal program for a home loan, then called for dismantling the program, though the article noted that the public and other members of Congress have taken advantage of such loans despite seeing reasons to criticize them. When asked about it, she said: \"This is the problem. It is almost impossible to buy a home in this country today without the federal government being involved\".\n\nBachmann was never a part of the birther movement but said that President Obama could resolve the dispute by producing his long-form birth certificate. In April 2011, after Obama released the certificate, Bachmann was asked about the issue on \"Good Morning America\" by George Stephanopoulos. She said that its release \"should settle the matter\", that \"I take the President at his word\", and that \"We have bigger fish to fry\".\n\nBachmann won her Congressional seat in the 2006 election with 50 percent of the vote, as she defeated Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) candidate Patty Wetterling and the Independence Party's John Binkowski.\n\nThe U.S. 6th District's congressman since 2001, Mark Kennedy, announced in late 2005 that he would be running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Mark Dayton of the DFL. Bachmann stated that \"God then called me to run\" for the U.S. House seat, and that she and her husband fasted for three days to be more sure.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg.com news, evangelical conservative leader James Dobson put the resources of his organization behind her 2006 campaign. Dobson's Focus on the Family planned to distribute 250,000 voter guides in Minnesota churches to reach social conservatives, according to Tom Prichard, president of the Minnesota Family Council, a local affiliate of Dobson's group. In addition to Minnesota, Dobson's group also organized turnout drives in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, New Jersey and Montana.\n\nDuring a debate televised by WCCO-TV on October 28, 2006, news reporter Pat Kessler quoted a story that appeared in the Minneapolis \"Star Tribune\" and asked Bachmann whether it was true that the church she belonged to taught that the Pope is the Anti-Christ. Bachmann stated that her church \"does not believe that the Pope is the Anti-Christ, that's absolutely false ... I'm very grateful that my pastor has come out and been very clear on this matter, and I think it's patently absurd and it's a false statement.\"\n\nBachmann received support from a fundraising visit in early July 2006 from Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert. On July 21, 2006, Karl Rove visited Minnesota to raise funds for her election. In August President George W. Bush was the keynote speaker at her congressional fundraiser, which raised about $500,000. Bachmann also received fundraising support from Vice President Dick Cheney. The National Republican Congressional Committee put nearly $3 million into the race, for electronic and direct-mail ads against DFLer Wetterling. The amount was significantly more than the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent on behalf of Wetterling. On November 7, 2006, Bachmann defeated opponents Patty Wetterling and John Binkowski with 50% of the vote to Wetterling's 42% and Binkowski's 8%.\n\nIn 2008 Bachmann won reelection over her DFL and Independence Party-endorsed opponent Elwyn Tinklenberg. With all precincts reported, Bachmann won, 46.41% to 43.43%. Because Tinklenberg was running as a DFLer in the Democratic primary, Bob Anderson was able to run in the Independence Party primary unopposed despite not having the Independence endorsement. Anderson received 10% of the vote.\n\nIn 2010 Bachmann was challenged by DFL nominee Tarryl Clark and Independence Party candidate Bob Anderson. With more than $8.5 million, Bachmann spent more than any other House of Representative candidate, although Clark was able to raise $4 million, one of the largest fundraising efforts in the nation for a U.S. House challenger. On November 2, 2010, Bachmann defeated Clark, 52% to 40%.\n\nIn early 2011 there was much speculation that Bachmann would run for president in 2012. She participated in the second Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire on June 13, 2011; during the debate she announced she had filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) earlier that day to become a candidate for the GOP nomination. Bachmann formally announced her candidacy for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination on June 27, 2011, during an appearance in Waterloo, Iowa.\n\nAlthough Bachmann won the Ames Straw Poll hosted by the Iowa GOP on August 13, 2011, becoming the first woman ever to win the poll, she finished sixth in the January 3, 2012, caucuses, with 4.98% of the vote. On January 4 she announced that she was cancelling her scheduled campaign trips to South Carolina and suspending her presidential campaign.\n\nOn January 25, 2012, Bachmann announced that she would run for reelection for her seat in Congress.\n\nAccording to Politico.com, as of July 2012 Bachmann had \"raised close to $15 million\" for the 2012 election, a figure it called \"astounding ... more than some Senate candidates will collect this year.\" From July to the end of September, Bachmann raised $4.5 million. This amount put her ahead of all other members of Congress (including Allen West who was in second place with $4 million) for the third quarter. Bachmann said she was \"humbled by the enormous outpouring of grassroots support for my campaign focused on keeping America the most secure and prosperous nation in the world.\"\n\nDespite a more favorable district Bachmann won reelection only narrowly, receiving just 4,298 more votes than her DFL challenger, Jim Graves.\n\nIn November 2011 Bachmann published her autobiography, \"Core of Conviction\", in which she outlined the events and people who have shaped her values and beliefs including her parents' divorce when she was in the ninth grade. She described the financial struggles her mother suffered as a single parent in trying to provide for her family and the work ethic she developed as a result of it. She wrote of that time, \"I took every baby sitting job I could get, because by ninth grade, I was growing conscious of my appearance. In those days, girls had to wear dresses to public school, and if I wanted pretty dresses, I had to buy them, because mom couldn't afford them for me; she couldn't afford lunch money.\"\n\nBachmann also wrote about her political conversion as a young adult when Jimmy Carter, whom she voted for, let her down. \"It was in the perilous fires of the Carter administration that my ideology was forged,\" she wrote. \"In the seventies, Carter taught me what I was against, and then in the eighties, Reagan taught me what I was for.\" She detailed why she went to work for the Internal Revenue Service—because she wanted to change the tax code \"from the inside out\"—and comments on her role as a Tea Party leader: \"I once said that the Tea Party represents 90 percent of Americans. I now realize that I misspoke. I should have said 100 percent, because I believe that nearly all Americans retain faith in the ordered liberty that the Constitution offers.\"\n\nIn 1978 Amble married Marcus Bachmann, now a clinical therapist with a master's degree from Regent University and a Ph.D. from Union Graduate School, whom she met while they were undergraduates. After she received an LL.M. in taxation from William & Mary School of Law in 1988, the couple moved to Stillwater, Minnesota, a town of 18,000 near Saint Paul, where they run a Christian counseling center that provided gay conversion therapy. Bachmann and her husband have five children: Lucas, Harrison, Elisa, Caroline, and Sophia. In a 2011 town hall meeting she said that she suffered a miscarriage after the birth of their second child, Harrison, an event she said shaped her anti-abortion views.\n\nBachmann and her husband have also provided foster care to 23 other children, all teenage girls. The Bachmanns were licensed from 1992 to 2000 to handle up to three foster children at a time; the last child arrived in 1998. The Bachmanns began by providing short-term care for girls with eating disorders who were patients in a University of Minnesota program. The Bachmann home was legally defined as a treatment home, with a daily reimbursement rate per child from the state. Some girls stayed a few months, others more than a year.\n\nBachmann is a former beauty pageant queen.\n\nIn May 2012 it was reported that Marcus Bachmann had registered for Swiss citizenship and after it was finalized, Michele Bachmann automatically became a citizen as well. The Bachmanns and their three youngest children were granted citizenship on March 19, 2012. They had been eligible for this under Swiss nationality law because Marcus Bachmann's parents were Swiss. Bachmann denied that she or her husband had applied for Swiss citizenship, saying that her husband had already been a dual citizen as the son of Swiss immigrants, and that she had automatically acquired Swiss citizenship under then-current Swiss law when she married him in 1978. But in May 2012, when a Swiss Television reporter said to her \"I understand you just got Swiss citizenship\", Bachmann's reply was: \"Yes, we did.\" Marcus Bachmann did not register the marriage with the Swiss authorities until 2012. Within two days of the first reports of Bachmann's dual citizenship, she announced that she had written to the Swiss consulate to withdraw her Swiss citizenship.\n\nBachmann was raised \"into a family of Norwegian Lutheran Democrats\"; she was a longtime member of Salem Lutheran Church (Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod) in Stillwater. She and her husband withdrew their membership on June 21, 2011, just before she officially began her presidential campaign. They had not attended the church for over two years. More recently, according to friends, the Bachmanns began attending Eagle Brook Church, an Evangelical Protestant Baptist church closer to their home.\n\nBachmann has cited theologian Francis Schaeffer as a \"profound influence\" on her life and her husband's, especially his film series \"How Should We Then Live?\". She has also described \"Total Truth: Liberating Christianity from Its Cultural Captivity\" by Nancy Pearcey as a \"wonderful\" book. Journalist Ryan Lizza has argued that Bachmann's worldview is deeply influenced by the Christian movement known as Dominionism, citing the influence of Schaeffer and Pearcey as evidence. Others have criticized Lizza's article, especially its connection of Schaeffer with Dominionism. Religion writer Sarah Posner broadly concurs with Lizza, pointing to the influence of Christian Reconstructionists Herb Titus and R. J. Rushdoony on Bachmann via the curriculum at O. W. Coburn School of Law.\n\nBachmann and her husband own a Christian counseling practice, Bachmann & Associates. The clinic is run by her husband, who has a Ph.D. with \"a concentration in clinical psychology\" from Union Graduate School. Marcus Bachmann is not a licensed clinical psychologist in Minnesota. The clinic received nearly $30,000 from Minnesota government agencies between 2006 and 2010 in addition to at least $137,000 in federal payments and $24,000 in government grants for counselor training. In an interview Michele Bachmann said that she and her husband had not benefited at taxpayer expense, saying, \"the money that went to the clinic was actually training money for employees\". Marcus Bachmann has denied allegations that Bachmann & Associates provides conversion therapy, a controversial psychological treatment repudiated by the American Psychological Association that attempts to transform homosexuals into heterosexuals. A former client of Bachmann's clinic and a hidden camera investigator with the activist group Truth Wins Out have said that therapists at the clinic do engage in such practices, but columnist Mariah Blake of \"The Nation\" has suggested the hidden camera investigator might have been baiting the therapist to say something controversial. In a subsequent interview with the \"Star Tribune\", Marcus Bachmann did not deny that he or other counselors at his clinic used the technique but said they did so only at a client's request.\n\nIn personal financial disclosure reports for 2006 through 2009, Bachmann reported earning $32,500 to $105,000 from a farm that was owned at the time by her ailing father-in-law, Paul Bachmann. The farm received $260,000 in federal crop and disaster subsidies between 1995 and 2008. Bachmann said that in 2006–2009, her husband acted as a trustee of the farm for his dying father and so, out of \"an abundance of caution\", she claimed the farm as income in financial disclosures, though it was her in-laws who profited from the farm during that period.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2064493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064493", "title": "Rodenstock GmbH", "text": "Rodenstock GmbH\n\nRodenstock GmbH () is a German manufacturer of ophthalmic lenses and spectacle frames. The company, which was founded in 1877, is headquartered in Munich. It has a worldwide workforce of approximately 4,200 and is represented in more than 80 countries with sales subsidiaries and distribution partners. Rodenstock maintains production sites for ophthalmic lenses at a total of 14 locations in 12 countries.\n\nThe foundation for Rodenstock's development was laid in 1877 by Josef Rodenstock with his workshop and shop for lenses, frames, barometers, and measurement instruments in Würzburg. In 1880, he developed his first patented products – diaphragm lenses. Two years later, he started exporting internationally and founded his own production sites. Since 1883 the company’s headquarters is located in Munich.\n\nIn the new millennium, the ophthalmic optics company quickly developed from a small tradesman shop into a modern industrial enterprise. For example, the first bifocal lenses came from Rodenstock as did UV-absorbing lenses.\n\nIn addition to the production of lenses, the third generation put special focus on the manufacture of frames. In 1955, Rodenstock sold more than one million of them. Other innovations followed like, for example, self-tinting (phototropic) lenses and the first progressive lenses developed by the company, the Progressiv R, which was an immediate success in the 1980s.\n\nIn the 1990s, the unique selling point as a manufacturer of lenses and frames from a single source was consistently developed. Through continuous innovations, Rodenstock further expanded its market share during that time. In 2000, the company landed a real coup in the field of individual progressive lenses with the product ImpressionILT. Rodenstock invented the modern progressive lens.\n\nIn 2000, the precision-optics division, Rodenstock Precision Optics, was sold to LINOS AG, which itself was subsumed by Qioptiq group in 2010 making Rodenstock Precision Optics a brand of Qioptiq. The eyeglasses division is now owned by the European holding company Bridgepoint. These independent entities still operate with the same stylized \"R\" logo.\n\nJosef Rodenstock (1878–1905)\nOn 1 January 1878, Josef Rodenstock (32), a peddler of self-designed measuring instruments and spectacle frames from Thuringia, began business operations together with his brother Michael of the company \"G. Rodenstock\" which had been founded in Würzburg in 1877.\n\nAlexander Rodenstock joined the company at the age of 22 in 1905. He had given up his studies of physics and economics at the urging of his father and started to prepare to take over the management of the family company; he did so in 1919.\n\nRolf Rodenstock (1953–1990)\nRolf Rodenstock had a diploma in general business, a doctorate and a professorship. He took over the helm of the family company from his father in 1953. He supervised the reconstruction of the company and Rodenstock’s own \"economic miracle\" and was considered one of the most respected corporate personalities of the still young Federal Republic.\n\nRandolf Rodenstock joined the company in 1976 and initially managed the company together with his father following his study of physics at Munich University and a subsequent MBA at the INSEAD management school in Fontainebleau, France. He took over general responsibility for the company in 1990 and focused the company on the demands of increasing industrial globalization.\n\nMore than 135 years of tradition, experience and the associated know-how have made Rodenstock into one of the most important manufacturers of lenses and frames. Rodenstock is the only brand that delivers “spectacles from a single source” with frames and lenses as a complete provider and is the inventor of the first individual progressive lens Impression®\nas well as the technology EyeLT®. The frames collection of Rodenstock has been allocated with more than 50 awards.\n\nThe competence for both ophthalmic lenses as well as for frames makes Rodenstock into a unique brand in ophthalmic optics because it can offer spectacles wearers the complete ”spectacles” system from a single source. Besides frames and lenses Rodenstock develops and sells video-centration systems under the brand name ImpressionIST as well as consulting software.\n\n\n\nRodenstock abandoned the branch of production of 'camera lenses'.\n\nA 3-element, 3-group design, used for 8 mm motion picture cameras.\n\n\nA 7-element design.\n\nFor 35 mm format:\n\nA 6-element design.\n\n\nFor 35 mm format:\n\nA 6-element design, used for 16 mm motion picture cameras.\n\n\nUsed for 8 mm motion picture cameras.\n\n\nA 5-element design.\n\n\nFor 35 mm format:\n\nA 4-element, 4-group design.\n\n\nLenses for Graflex XL Camera system/Polaroid Land Camera. Single coated lanthanum glass\n\n\nFor 35 mm format:\n\nFor Dacora CC 35mm format:\n\n\nRodenstock has a long history of manufacturing lenses for large format cameras, and has several lines of lenses.\n\nThe least expensive of the Rodenstock lenses, these 3-element, 3-group designs have a 60° angle of view, and perform best when stopped down.\n\n\nAs a major product pre-war anastigmat, 4-element, 4-group lens, it was replacing the Imagonal in ~1909.\nTheir formula was changed from double-gauss to dialyt somewhere between number 116.000 and 239.000, but there were still some double-gauss-Eurynar's, where a greater angle was necessary.\nThe Lens Collector's Vade Mecum (M. Wilkinson and C. Glanfield) is giving 1924 as the date for this change.\n\nAt 1930 there was also a double anastigmat Eustigmat 1:6.8/135mm, which looks like a double-gauss Eurynar.\n\nKadlubek's Lens Catalogue is showing up 13 sizes from 90mm to 600mm, with f4.5, f5.4, f5.6, or f6.8;\nthe Vade Mecum is listing sizes from 50mm to 600mm and additional openings f3.5, f3.8, f4.0, and f6.5.\n\nTypically 135mm is used for 9x12cm, 21 cm for 13x18 / 7x5in, 42 cm for 10x8in, 48 cm for 12x10in and\n60 cm for 15x12in.\n\nThe Grandagon lines are Rodenstock's wide-angle lenses. With an angle of view of 105°, these 8-element, 4-group lenses are the standard wide angles of the Rodenstock line. In their respective focal lengths, they are among the fastest wide angles available from any manufacturer. The 90;mm f/6.8, by contrast to the rest of the line, is a 6 element design.\n\n\nThe APO-Grandagon line is apochromatic, incorporating ED-glass elements. This series has a 120° angle of view, but the extremely short focal lengths only cover mostly medium format image sizes. Designs are 8 elements in 4 groups.\n\n\nAccording to the Rodenstock factoy, the 150/5.6 Sironar N and the 150/5.6 Apo-Sironr N lenses are optically identical, the only difference being the change of designation. It is likely reasonable to surmise that this similarity applies across the two lines.\n\nThe APO-Sironar-N line is a 6-element, 4-group apochromatic design for general photography. Angle of view is 72°.\n\n\nThese 6-element, 4-group lenses are an update to the APO-Sironar-N line, incorporating a larger angle of view (75°) and extra-low dispersion (ED) glass elements to further reduce chromatic aberrations. Light fall-off at the edges of the field has also been reduced from the Sironar-N lenses.\n\n\n\n\nThis line of 6-element, 4-group macro lenses is optimized for reproduction ratios from 1:5 to 2:1.\n\n\nThese are apochromatic dialyts with 4 elements in 4 groups and an angle of view of 48° in lengths shorter than 480mm, narrowing to 40° above 760mm. They are optimized for 1:1 reproduction ratios, but also give excellent results in general photography, with extremely low distortion and superior sharpness. These lenses can be found mounted in shutter and as barrel lenses.\nOnly some barrel Apo-Ronars can be remounted into a shutter, for details see http://www.skgrimes.com/lens-mounting/table-of-lenses-fitted-to-shutters .\nMost barrel APO-Ronars have a slot that allows to insert gel filters and waterhouse stops of any shape (for special effects) between the two optical groups, but there are also APO-Ronars with a fixed f-stop, i.e. a circular plate instead of an iris, and no filter slot.\nLengths above 240mm also have a millimeters iris scale that indicates the real iris diameter, in order to calculate with high precision the effective f/stop when you work in close up and repro photography. This scale is typically starting at 2mm corresponding to a f-stop of 120 for a 240mm lens. Such and even higher values are useful for and only for prepress use.\nThe CL-Versions (upcharge, more seldom) have a linear f-stop scale. This is useful for setting precise f-stops, specially when often different values are used.\n\nFormat coverage given for Focus at infinity at f/22\n\n\nIntroduced in 1931, the Tiefenbildner-Imagon is an achromat doublet uncorrected for spherical aberration used together with diffusion discs or sieve apertures. The lens is one of the classic soft-focus \"portrait lenses\".\n\nThe Rodenstock digital lenses are optimized for the small pixel grids common to most digital cameras' sensors, from 12 μm to 5 μm, to reduce the effects that diffraction and color noise have on sharpness.\n\nThese are the standard lenses in Rodenstock's digital lineup. They are optimized for working apertures of f/8 to f/11, and for extremely flat field and uniform illumination.\n\n\nThe APO-Macro is optimized for reproduction ratios of 1:5 to 2:1.\n\n\nThe HR series of lenses is optimized for extreme resolving power, for use with extremely high-resolution (thus the name) CCD sensors, with pixel sizes smaller than 10 μm. Recommended working apertures are f/8 to f/11.\n\n\nThe current line of Rodenstock enlarging lenses have removable click-stops for setting aperture in the dark, an illuminated f-stop display, and an aperture pre-set feature, which allows setting of the working aperture, and quick changing from full aperture to the working aperture, for easy focusing and framing.\n\nOptical system: 4-element, 3-group Tessar Type lenses.\nLow-priced version enlargement lens. The description is a sharp.\nAn individual serial number is not marked to the lens.\nAs for this, OEM was supplied to the other companies or in the guess such as Aperture Type, the possibility of received the supply oppositely is high. It is a brand that the so many chances to see and is unusual now.\n\n\nThis is the budget line of enlarging lenses, which have 3-element, 3-group designs.\nThey are optimized for 2x-8x reproduction ratios. This lens is the triplet type lens.\n\n\nThe 4-element, 3-group Rogonar-S is Tessar Type lenses.\nline is optimized for between 2x-8x and 2x-10x reproduction, depending on the model.\n\n\nRodenstock's 6-element, 4-group range of enlarger lenses carry very even field illumination, and can be used as on-camera macro lenses in addition to normal enlarging lenses. Optimum working apertures are 2 stops below maximum aperture. The image quality is very good.\n\n\nThis line of 6-element, 4-group lenses is optimized for reproduction ratios of 20x and above.\n\n\nThis is a wide-angle series of lenses, which allow greater enlargements and use of shorter focal-length lenses than would otherwise be possible. The WA lenses are 6 elements in 4 groups, and are optimized for 4x-15x reproduction.\n\n\nThe apochromatically-corrected Rodagon-N line generally features 6-element, 4-group designs, for the 50mm, and 7 elements 5 groups for 80mm, 105mm, 150mm, and eight elements in six groups for the 45mm, (2x-30x), and optimum reproduction ratios of 2x-15x depending on the focal length. The chromatic aberrations are corrected almost perfectly resulting in very high image contrast and resolution.\n\n\nNot necessarily enlarging lenses, these models are optimized for near 1:1 reproduction ratios, for purposes such as duplication of transparencies, or preparation of internegatives. They are 6-element, 4-group designs, and optimum f-stop is 2 stops below maximum aperture.\n\n\nOptimized for 1:1 reproduction ratio.\n\n\n\n\nThese are Barrel lens for Enlarging & for a photoengraving, and perfect apochromatic lenses. Razor-sharp depiction is also recommended for close-up photography.\n\n\nfor a photoengraving lens.\n\n\nfor Klimsch & co., Frankfurt am Main.\nFor a photoengraving and copy used.

Especially, it was used to photoengrave a huge map. Use the room size very big camera.\n\n\nIn the late 1990s, Rodenstock was contracted by Vantage Film, Inc., with backing from Lucasfilm, to manufacture a new line of high-speed, high-resolution anamorphic lenses to be used for the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Only the first film ended up being shot with the lenses, the other two were shot on CineAlta HDTV.

{"id": "2064501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064501", "title": "Spadroon", "text": "Spadroon\n\nA spadroon is a light sword with a straight-edged blade, enabling both cut and thrust attacks. This English term first came into use in the early 18 century, though the type of sword it referred to was in common usage during the late 17 century. They were primarily used as a military (army & navy) sidearm in the late 17 and early 18 centuries, and for officers and NCOs in the latter part of the 18 and early 19 centuries. The type of sword also saw widespread use across Europe and America, though the term ‘spadroon’ is unique to the Anglophone world. \n\nSpadroon is a term used to categorize a type of sword that is in between a small sword (which thrusts only), and the heavier-bladed broadsword. They may have single- or double-edged blades, and hilt types ranging from a simple stirrup guard, to double shells, and even further protection to the sides of the hand. The distinction between a spadroon and broadsword can sometimes be a difficult one, as it depends upon to what period and weapons they are being compared. The important thing is that the spadroon is fast and agile, due to having little mass at the tip of the blade, and a hilt that does not restrict wrist mobility in any way. \n\nCastle (1892) wrote of it: \"A cutting sword of still narrower dimensions, and with a much simpler guard, approximating to that of the small sword, was called \"Spadroon\" in England; it was, in fact, similar to the German cut-and-thrust rapier of the eighteenth century, which had been called Spadane or Spadrone since the disuse of the regular two-handed swords... The German spadroon was a regular double-edged sword, but any very light back or shearing sword was so called in England.\"\n\nThis description is not especially helpful, as spadroons can be found with a number of different hilt types, and there is little evidence of the Germans using such a term. They typically used much more generic terms for a spadroon, such as Degen and Hieber.\n\nIn its double shell form, the spadroon can be traced to the Mortuary and Walloon hilted broadswords of the mid to late 17 century. These were commonly military weapons fitted with broadsword blades, though many of the lighter examples could well be considered spadroons. However, the deletion of side bars on these hilts is what gives the agility in grip that defines a spadroon. \n\nThe French adopted an infantry sword in the late 17 century which they called an \"épée du soldat\" (soldier’s sword): a broadsword blade fitted to a small sword hilt. They are functionally very much like many spadroons, and this was a style that also gained some popularity in Britain in the same period.\n\nAround 1680-1720 a great many British military swords took on a form that finally was called a spadroon. These swords featured light cut and thrust blades, usually double edged. Their hilts looked like a reduced version of the Walloon or Mortuary form. These were highly regarded weapons, as fencing masters Donald McBane and Sir William Hope attested. McBane wrote in his work on swordsmanship, \"The Expert Sword-Man's Companion\" (1728), that the spadroon was an “extraordinary weapon that none can compare with it.” Sir William Hope called it \"The master of all weapons.\" These masters also referred to the spadroon as the 'sheering' or 'shearing' sword. Many of these swords share a lot in common with the double 1796 regulation spadroon, but are typically a little heavier and more robust. \n\n1786 was a hugely significant year for the sword and specifically the spadroon, in army service, as it saw the end of pole arms for officers, and the introduction of the first standard for a sword, the 1786 pattern. Though it may be called that today, it was not in fact a pattern at all. 'Pattern' refers to a piece of example equipment that has been accepted for army service. Since the start of the eighteenth century a band of officers (or other responsible persons) has approved the quality and finish of all items of military clothing, it was then sealed with the wax of the Board of Ordnance or other Government (wax) seal to be recognised as the standard to be kept by manufacturers. This allowed manufacturers, tailors, and swordsmiths to have an example to use as a reference for both design and quality. The 1786 sword was not a pattern, but a rather vague description. Nonetheless it was the first standard outlined for army wide service, and so is commonly referred to as the 1786 pattern today but might be better described as the 1786 regulation. The only requirements for the 1786 regulation was that the blade was straight, 32” long and 1” wide at the guard, that the guard matched the colour of the buttons of your uniform, and that all officers of a regiment had the same type.\n\nDue to very loose requirements for this regulation, there was much variety found, and few swords were of a new design. Most had been in service for many years before, such as during the American Revolution. \n\nMany spadroons in the late 18 century featured what has become known as a ‘five ball’ guard. A five-ball design found on the knucklebow and/or side ring of the guard. These are commonly associated with naval swords, as many are found with fouled anchor, though the style was fashionable amongst the army too. Though it was a fashionable style, five ball spadroons only account for a small amount of spadroons found in the period they were used. They are one of many designs that fit the 1786 regulation, as well as being used before it. There is some evidence to suggest the five ball spadroon is what the French referred to as the épée anglaise.\n\nThe 1796 pattern sword (spadroon) was the first British infantry sword to truly follow a pattern and be controlled by strict parameters. It followed the same regulation blade outlined in 1786, but now also featured a regulation hilt. A brass gilded double shell guard with knucklebow and urn shaped pommel. A guard that was in fact very similar to many small swords of the day, a fact that leads to them often being mistaken for one another. The 1796 spadroon was not a copy of the small sword, but in fact one in a long lineage of double shell military swords that had been in use in Britain from the late 17th century, as well as in widespread use across Europe. The exact ornamentation of the 1796 was indeed a copy of those carried by the Prussian Frederick the Great and his officers. One shell was often hinged so that the sword sat flush when wearing against the uniform, but this was not part of the regulation, and at the discretion of the purchaser. \n\nThe 1796 infantry sword was for use by Infantry officers and NCO's, Royal Artillery officers and NCOs, Royal Engineer officers and other corps (Such as surgeons for example). \n\nIt was widely disliked, as is noted in many sources at the time. Though it is important to note that officers had to purchase their own swords, and so whilst many 1796 pattern spadroons are poor weapons, it is entirely possible to specify and make a successful and effective sword within the parameters of the regulation. Therefore, decent fighting weapons do exist among surviving examples of this pattern type, as well as many that range from adequate to poor fighting weapons. Attempts to replace this spadroon with a robust sabre were only partially successful. With an infantry pattern introduced in 1803, and many non-regulation sabres carried both within and against the regulations of the day. Despite this, the 1796 spadroon lived on until it was replaced in army service in 1822 by a new model of sabre, and ended the use of the Spadroon in British army service, and in Naval use in 1827 (also by a new sabre pattern).\n\nMany straight, light cut and thrust swords continued in use throughout the 19 century, such as the French 1882 Infantry officer’s sword, and the British 1892/1895/1897 pattern infantry officers’ swords. These were not called spadroons but are certainly the same type of weapon in functional terms. \n\nIn America, the spadroon lived on in the form of the 1840 model, which closely resembled British 1796 pattern.  \n\nThe earliest known use of the word Spadroon is in Donald McBane's 1728 work 'The Expert Sword-Man's Companion'. It likely derives from the French and Spanish espadon or Italian spadone, which had in previous years referred to much larger swords to be used in two hands.\n\nThe Spadroon is a key weapon in the study of British military swordsmanship of the Napoleonic period, as well as those practising from earlier 18th century British sources. It was one of three main weapons outlined in the key works of swordsmanship in that period, such as Charles Roworth's 1798 manual, 'The Art of Defence on Foot, with Broadsword and Sabre...to which are added Remarks on the Spadroon'. A number of Historical Fencing, or HEMA clubs around the world are now pursuing modern day practice of the spadroon. \n\nA group dedicated to spadroons, their history and use, is now active on Facebook, called Spadrooners.\n"}

Examples include the kinetic typography and graphics used in film and television opening sequences, and the spinning, three-dimensional station identification logos of some television channels. The art form has been around for decades, and has advanced in technical sophistication over time.\n\nA motion graphic designer may be a person trained in traditional graphic design who has learned to integrate additional elements into their existing skill set of design knowledge, though motion designers can also come from filmmaking or animation backgrounds, and may use tools or training from those fields as well. \n\nMotion graphic design is often used in the film industry. Openings to movies, television shows, and news programs can use photography, typography, and motion graphics to make the introduction \nMotion graphic design has also achieved widespread use in content marketing and advertising. With global technology firm Cisco projecting that 82 percent of all web traffic will be video by 2022, marketers and advertisers have focused much of their efforts on the production of high-quality branded video and motion graphic content. \n\nTechnological advancements during the 20th and 21st centuries have greatly impacted the field; chief among these are improvements in modern computing technology, as computer programs for the film and video industries became more powerful and more widely available during this period. Modern motion graphic design typically involves any of several computerized tools and processes.\n\nOne of the leading computer programs used by modern motion graphic designers has been Adobe After Effects, which allows the user to create and modify graphics over time. Another relatively recent product used in the market is Apple Inc. Motion, now a part of Final Cut Studio. Software such as Maxon Cinema4D has integrated tools to create motion graphics, such as the native MoGraph plugin, or ICE of Softimage, which can also be used for similar purposes.\n\nAdobe Flash has also been widely used to create motion graphic design, particularly for the web, where it is sometimes used in web design, but also in some animation products, such as animated web television productions like Homestar Runner.\n\nMotion graphics take a variety of forms. While some are entirely animated, others incorporate live-action video and/or photography. The latter may include animation overlay, such as data visualizations, icons, illustrations, and explanatory text used to complement and enhance audiences' understanding of the content. \n\nPopular graphic designer like Anthony Kupin.. are the leading people in design right now. In content marketing contexts, there are three primary types of motion graphics, which marketers choose to use depending on the goals they wish to achieve with the motion graphic. Explainer motion graphics seek to elucidate a product, process, or concept. Emotive motion graphics, meanwhile, aim to inspire a particular emotional response in audiences. And finally, promotional motion graphics are used to raise awareness about a service, product, or initiative. Because so many motion graphics are designed with particular goals in mind, it is often essential to partner with a designer or organization specializing in visual communication design to achieve a final product that conveys information in both an accurate and compelling way. \n\n\n"}

He was a Continental Congressman from Delaware, and a member of the Democratic-Republican Party who served in the Delaware General Assembly, as Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court, and as federal judge for the Mississippi Territory. He was the younger brother of Caesar Rodney, Revolutionary President of Delaware.\n\nRodney was born June 4, 1744 at \"Byfield,\" his family's farm at Jones Neck, in Dover Hundred, Kent County, Delaware. It is just north of John Dickinson's mansion, \"Poplar Hall\". He was the son of Caesar and Mary Crawford Rodney, and grandson of William Rodney, who came to America in the 1680s and had been Speaker of the Colonial Assembly of the Lower Counties in 1704. His mother was the daughter of the Rev. Thomas Crawford, Anglican priest at Dover. \"Byfield\" was an farm, worked by a small number of slaves, and with the addition of other adjacent properties, the Rodneys were, by the standards of the day, wealthy members of the local gentry. Sufficient income was earned from the sale of wheat and barley to the Philadelphia and West Indies market to provide enough cash and leisure to allow members of the family to participate in the social and political life of Kent County. Rodney's father died in 1745, when he was an infant and his much older brother, Caesar Rodney became much involved in his rearing and education.\n\nRodney was very active in local politics, as well as the broader range of those elements affecting Delaware as whole. As early as 1740 he was a Justice of the Peace for Kent County and through the years he held many other local offices. He was a Colonel in the county's militia, and was involved in a number of actions during the American Revolutionary War.\n\nIn 1774 Thomas was a delegate to the state convention that elected his brother Caesar to be their delegate to the Continental Congress. Caesar went on to sign the Declaration of Independence. Meanwhile, Thomas was named to the state's \"Committee of Safety\". Thomas in turn was sent as a delegate to the Congress in 1781 and 1782. He was elected to the Congress annually from 1785 to 1787, but attended sessions only in 1786. Through these same years Thomas was also a member in Delaware's state Assembly, and served as its Speaker of the House in 1787.\n\nOn December 17, 1802 Rodney became an associate justice of Delaware's Supreme Court. He would serve only until August 1803. He resigned since President Jefferson appointed him as the chief justice for the Mississippi Territory. He bought land in what was then Jefferson County, Mississippi and moved to Natchez to assume his new duties as the senior federal judge for the Mississippi Territory from 1803 to 1811.\n\nThomas Rodney died January 2, 1811, at Natchez, Mississippi. The community of Rodney, in Jefferson County, Mississippi is named in his honor. His son, Caesar A. Rodney, served as the U.S. Representative from Delaware, U.S. Senator from Delaware, U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Minister to Argentina.\n\nAt this time Delaware elections were held the first of October. Members of the House of Assembly took office on the twentieth day of October for a term of one year. Seven Assemblymen were elected, at large, from each county. The General Assembly chose the Continental Congressmen for a term of one year.\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

Over its 266-year existence it occupied various buildings on Bow Street in Central London, immediately north-west of Covent Garden. It closed in 2006 and its work moved to a set of four magistrates' courts: Westminster, Camberwell Green, Highbury Corner and the City of London Magistrates' Court.\n\nThe first court at Bow Street was established in 1740, when Colonel Sir Thomas de Veil, a Westminster justice, sat as a magistrate in his home at number 4. De Veil was succeeded by novelist and playwright Henry Fielding in 1747. He was appointed a magistrate for the City of Westminster in 1748, at a time when the problem of gin consumption and resultant crime was at its height. There were eight licensed premises in the street and Fielding reported that every fourth house in Covent Garden was a gin shop. In 1749, in response to calls to find an effective means to tackle increasing crime and disorder, Fielding brought together eight reliable constables, known as \"Mr Fielding's People\", who soon gained a reputation for honesty and efficiency in their pursuit of criminals. The constables came to be known as the Bow Street Runners. Fielding's blind half-brother, Sir John Fielding (known as the \"Blind Beak of Bow Street\"), succeeded his brother as magistrate in 1754 and refined the patrol into the first truly effective police force for the capital. The early 19th century saw a dramatic increase in number and scope of the police based at Bow Street with the 1805 formation of the Bow Street Horse Patrole, which covered to the edge of London and was the first uniformed police unit in Britain, and in 1821 the Dismounted Horse Patrole which covered suburban areas.\n\nWhen the Metropolitan Police Service was established in 1829, a station house was sited at numbers 25 and 27. \n\nIn 1876 the Duke of Bedford let a new site on the eastern side of Bow Street to the Commissioners of HM Works and Public Buildings for an annual rent of £100. Work on the current building to a design by the Office of Works's surveyor Sir John Taylor began in 1878 and was completed in 1881—the date of 1879 in the stonework above the door of the present building is the date on which it had been hoped that work would finish. Historic England's listing entry describes the architectural style as \"dignified, eclectic Graeco-Roman with some slightly Vanbrughian details, rather in the Pennethorne manner.\"\n\nIn 1878 gazetteer Walter Thornbury published that the establishment, still called generally a Magistrates' House, consisted of \"three magistrates, each attending two days in a week\". He added:\n\nIn its later years, the court housed the office of the Senior District Judge (Magistrates' Courts), who heard high-profile matters, such as extradition cases or those involving eminent public figures.\n\nThe immediate location of the court was in Georgian London, near the scene of crimes and where defendants lived. The spread of London's population and a marked improvement in cheap public transport since the 18th century enabled other magistrates' courts to open across London, on both sides of the river. In recent years the Covent Garden district has seen commercialisation and a resultant loss in population, enabling better use to be put to a site which faces the front entrance to the Royal Opera House.\n\nIn 2004, the court was put up for sale by its joint owners, the Greater London Magistrates' Courts Authority and the Metropolitan Police Authority. In July 2005 the site was bought by property developer Gerry Barrett for the stated purpose to convert it to a boutique hotel and the court closed on 14 July 2006. The final case was that of Jason John Handy, a 33-year-old alcoholic-vagrant who was accused of breaching his anti-social behaviour order. Other cases on the last day included beggars, shoplifters, illegal minicab drivers and a terrorist hearing—the first of its kind—in which a terror suspect was accused of breaching his control order. The final day was heavily attended by members of the press. The court's remaining cases moved to Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court which itself closed in 2011, when its work moved to the old Marylebone Court House and renamed Westminster Magistrates' Court. \n\nIn 2008 the Bow Street site was sold to Austrian developers who obtained planning permission for a 100-room hotel and a world police museum, while maintaining the facade of the old court building. In October 2016 the site was sold on again, to the UK arm of Qatari investment firm BTC, who plan to use the existing planning permission for the hotel and police museum, due to open in 2020.\n\nMany famous accused people have passed through Bow Street, often before committal for trial at the Central Criminal Court, Old Bailey or at other Crown Court centres, or when being held on extradition or terrorism charges.

He was the only child from that marriage that reached adulthood. His paternal grandfather was Ludwig III of Bavaria, the last king of Bavaria, who was deposed in 1918.\n\nFollowing the First World War, Albrecht's grandfather King Ludwig was deposed. Albrecht and the family moved from Bavaria to the Austrian Tyrol.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, his family, the House of Wittelsbach, were opposed to the regime of Nazi Germany and refused to join the Nazi Party. The decision meant that Prince Albrecht, who had been studying forestry, was unable to complete his studies. In 1940 Albrecht took his family to his estate at Sárvár, Vas, Hungary. In October 1944, after Germany had occupied Hungary in March, the Wittelsbachs were arrested and imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp at Oranienburg, Brandenburg. In April 1945 they were moved to the Dachau concentration camp, where they were liberated by the United States Army.\n\nAlbrecht became head of the deposed royal family of Bavaria with the death of his father on 2 August 1955. As the eldest son of the eldest son of Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este (1849–1919), recognized by Jacobites as \"Queen Mary IV (of England) and III (of Scotland)\", he was also the dynastic representative and heir-general of England, Scotland and Ireland's last Stuart king, James II and VII, deposed in 1688.\n\nIn 1959 Albrecht, in an official ceremony, returned the Greek crown jewels (originally made for a Bavarian prince who reigned as Greece's first modern monarch, King Otto) to the Greek nation, accepted by King Paul of Greece.\n\nIn 1980 Albrecht presided over sumptuous ceremonies in Bavaria celebrating the 800th anniversary of the founding of the House of Wittelsbach.\n\nAlbrecht was a prolific hunter and deer researcher, collecting 3,425 sets of antlers, now partially shown in a permanent exhibition on his research activities in the former royal castle at Berchtesgaden. He also wrote two books on \"the habits of deer\" for which he (and his second wife) received honorary doctorates by the biological faculty of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. While visiting Brazil in 1953 he encountered Brazilian Mastiffs and took some to Germany, introducing the dog breed to Europe.\n\nAlbrecht died on 8 July 1996, aged 91, at Berg Castle, southwest of Munich, where he had lived reclusively for decades. His funeral at Theatine Church, Munich was conducted by Friedrich Wetter, the Archbishop of Munich. He was buried on a family graveyard he himself had installed in 1977 at Andechs Abbey.\n\nAlbrecht married Countess Maria Draskovich of Trakostjan (8 March 1904 in Vienna – 10 June 1969 in Wildbad Kreuth) on 3 September 1930 in Berchtesgaden. Daughter of Count Dionys Maria Draskovich von Trakostjan and Princess Juliana Rose von Montenuovo (a great-granddaughter of Marie-Louise of Austria, sometime Empress of the French), she belonged to a family of the Croatian nobility known since 1230 and made Imperial counts in 1631. Although Albrecht's father allowed the wedding, a Wittelsbach family council concluded that the marriage was non-compliant with the dynasty's marital tradition as set out in its historical house laws, and the names of the couple's four children were excluded from the \"Almanach de Gotha\". In 1948, however, a juridical consultation advised that the head of the house has sole authority to determine the validity of marriages within the House of Wittelsbach, prompting Crown Prince Rupprecht to recognize Albrecht's marriage as dynastic on 18 May 1949.\n\nOn 21 April 1971 in Weichselboden, Albrecht married Countess Marie-Jenke Keglevich of Buzin (23 April 1921 in Budapest – 5 October 1983 in Weichselboden), daughter of Count Stephan Keglevich de Buzin and Countess Klára Zichy of Zich and Vásonkeö.

He was said to have reigned for \"420 years\"; some copies read \"900 years\".\n\nThe king list adds that Enmerkar became king after his father Mesh-ki-ang-gasher, son of Utu, had \"entered the sea and disappeared.\" \n\nEnmerkar is also known from a few other Sumerian legends, most notably \"Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta\", where a previous confusion of the languages of mankind is mentioned. In this account, it is Enmerkar himself who is called 'the son of Utu' (the Sumerian sun god). Aside from founding Uruk, Enmerkar is said here to have had a temple built at Eridu, and is even credited with the invention of writing on clay tablets, for the purpose of threatening Aratta into submission. Enmerkar furthermore seeks to restore the disrupted linguistic unity of the inhabited regions around Uruk, listed as Shubur, Hamazi, Sumer, Uri-ki (the region around Akkad), and the Martu land. \n\nThree other texts in the same series describe Enmerkar's reign. In \"Enmerkar and En-suhgir-ana\", while describing Enmerkar's continued diplomatic rivalries with Aratta, there is an allusion to Hamazi having been vanquished. In \"Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave\", Enmerkar is seen leading a campaign against Aratta. The fourth and last tablet, \"Lugalbanda and the Anzu Bird\", describes Enmerkar's year-long siege of Aratta. It also mentions that fifty years into Enmerkar's reign, the Martu people had arisen in all of Sumer and Akkad, necessitating the building of a wall in the desert to protect Uruk.\n\nIn these last two tablets, the character of Lugalbanda is introduced as one of Enmerkar's war chiefs. According to the Sumerian king list, it was this Lugalbanda \"the shepherd\" who eventually succeeded Enmerkar to the throne of Uruk. Lugalbanda is also named as the father of Gilgamesh, a later king of Uruk, in both Sumerian and Akkadian versions of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\".\nIn a legend related by Aelian (ca. AD 200), the king of Babylon, \"Euechoros\" or \"Seuechoros\" (also appearing in many variants as \"Sevekhoros\", earlier \"Sacchoras\", etc.), is said to be the grandfather of Gilgamos, who later becomes king of Babylon (i.e., Gilgamesh of Uruk). Several recent scholars have suggested that this \"Seuechoros\" or \"Euechoros\" is moreover to be identified with Enmerkar of Uruk, as well as the \"Euechous\" named by Berossus as being the first king of Chaldea and Assyria. This last name \"Euechous\" (also appearing as \"Evechius\", and in many other variants) has long been identified with Nimrod.\n\nThe controversial historian David Rohl has claimed parallels between Enmerkar, builder of Uruk, and Nimrod, ruler of biblical Erech (Uruk), who, according to some extra-biblical legends, was supposedly the architect of the Tower of Babel. One parallel Rohl has noted is between the epithet \"the Hunter\", applied to Nimrod, and the suffix \"-kar\" at the end of Enmerkar's name, which means \"hunter\". Rohl has also argued that Eridu near Ur is the original site of the city of Babel and that the incomplete ziggurat found there is none other than the Biblical tower itself.\n\n"}

They are sometimes used as symbols in Freemasonry and Tarot. They were probably not support structures, but were free standing, based on similar pillars found in other nearby temples.\n\nThe pillars had a size nearly six feet (1.8 metres) thick and 27 feet (8.2 metres) tall. The eight-foot (2.4 metres) high brass chapiters, or capitals, on top of the columns bore decorations, in brass, of lilies. The original measurement as taken from the Torah was in cubits, which records that the pillars were 18 cubits high and 12 cubits around, and hollow—four fingers thick. (). Nets of checkerwork covered the bowl of each chapiter, decorated with rows of 200 pomegranates, wreathed with seven chains for each chapiter, and topped with lilies (, ).\n\nThe pillars did not survive the destruction of the First Temple; Jeremiah reports: \"The Chaldeans broke up the bronze columns of the House of the Lord\". II Kings has a similar account. The pillars were carried away in pieces for ease of transportation. When the Second Temple was built, they were not returned and there exists no record of new pillars being constructed to replace them.\n\nAccording to the first-century Romano-Jewish scholar Josephus' book \"Antiquities of the Jews\", Boaz (Hebrew בֹּעַז \"boʿaz\" \"In him/it [is] strength\") stood on the left on the portico of Solomon's Temple, while Jachin (Hebrew יָכִין \"yakin\" \"He/it will establish\") stood on the right, and the two were made by an Israelite craftsman named Hiram.\n\nThe Romanesque Church of Santa Maria Maggiore at Tuscania, Italy, has a recessed entrance flanked by a pair of free-standing stone columns intended to evoke Boaz and Jachin.\n\nColumns representing Boaz and Jachin can be found in most Masonic Lodges, and are emblematic of their use in Masonic ritual. The pillars are part of a symbolic use of Solomon's Temple itself.\n\nJakin, an incorporated town in the southwest of the U.S. state of Georgia, takes its name from the pillar.\n\nSome variants of the Tarot card The High Priestess depict Boaz and Jachin.\n\n\n\nadd 2 Chronicles 3:17\n\n"}
{"id": "2064583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064583", "title": "Seax", "text": "Seax\n\nSeax (; also \"sax, sæx, sex\"; invariant in plural, latinized \"sachsum\") is an Old English word for \"knife\". In modern archaeology, the term \"seax\" is used specifically for a type of small sword, knife or dagger typical of the Germanic peoples of the Migration period and the Early Middle Ages, especially the Saxons, whose name derives from the weapon. These vary considerably in size, but are mostly all-purpose tools and weapons, often carried by women as well as men. \n\nIn heraldry, the \"seax\" is a charge consisting of a curved sword with a notched blade, appearing, for example, in the coats of arms of Essex and the former Middlesex.\n\nOld English \"seax, sax\" and Old Frisian \"sax\" are identical with Old Saxon and Old High German \"saks\", all from a Common Germanic \"*sahsą\" from a root \"*sah, *sag-\" \"to cut\" (also in saw, from a PIE root *sek-). In Scandinavia, the words \"sax\", \"saks\" or \"sakset\" all refer to scissors, which are used for cutting various materials.\n\nThe term \"scramaseax\" or \"scramsax\" (lit. \"wounding-knife\") is sometimes used for disambiguation, even though it is not attested in Old English, but taken from an occurrence of \"scramasaxi\" in Gregory of Tours' \"History of the Franks\".\n\nThe name of the roofer's tool, the \"zax\", is a development from this word.\n\nAmongst the shape and construction of seaxes there is a great deal of variation. The most frequent characteristics are:\n\n\nIn the continental Germanic area, the following types are defined for seaxes between roughly 450 and 800 AD, in chronological order:\n\nThe general trend, as one moves from the short to the broad seax, is that the blade becomes heavier, longer, broader and thicker. Long seaxes, which arrived at the end of the 7th century, were the longest of the seax. These were narrower and lighter than their predecessors. Initially, these weapons were found in combination with double-edged swords and were probably intended as side arm. From the 7th century onwards, seaxes became the main edged weapon (next to a francisca), sometimes in combination with small side-knives.\n\nThe rest of Europe (except for parts of Scandinavia) followed a similar development, although some types may not be very common depending on location. In England long seaxes appear later than on the continent and finds of long seaxes (as opposed to knives) remain very rare in comparison to finds of swords throughout the period.\n\nAnother typical form of the seax is the so-called broken-back style seax. These seaxes have a sharp angled transition between the back section of the blade and the point, the latter generally forming 1/3 to 3/5 of the blade length, exactly like a large version of a modern clip-point blade. These seaxes exist both in long seax variety (edge and back parallel) and in smaller blades of various lengths (blade expanding first, then narrowing towards the tip after the kink). They occurred mostly in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with some examples in Germany around 8th-11th century. Some examples have pattern welded blades, while others have inlays of silver, copper, brass, etc.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2064584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064584", "title": "Click-through rate", "text": "Click-through rate\n\nClick-through rate (CTR) is the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement. It is commonly used to measure the success of an online advertising campaign for a particular website as well as the effectiveness of email campaigns.\n\nClick-through rates for ad campaigns vary tremendously. The very first online display ad shown for AT&T on the website HotWired in 1994, had a 44% click-through rate. With time, the overall rate of user's clicks on webpage banner ads has decreased.\n\nThe purpose of click-through rates is to measure the ratio of clicks to impressions of an online ad or email marketing campaign. Generally the higher the CTR the more effective the marketing campaign has been at bringing people to a website. Most commercial websites are designed to elicit some sort of action, whether it be to buy a book, read a news article, watch a music video, or search for a flight. People rarely visit websites with the intention of viewing advertisements, in the same way that few people watch television to view the commercials.\n\nWhile marketers want to know the reaction of the web visitor, with current technology it is nearly impossible to quantify the emotional reaction to the site and the effect of that site on the firm's brand. However, click-through rate is an easy piece of data to acquire. The click-through rate measures the proportion of visitors who initiated an advertisement that redirected them to another page where they might purchase an item or learn more about a product or service. Forms of interaction with advertisements other than clicking is possible, but rare; \"click-through rate\" is the most commonly used term to describe the efficacy of an advert.\n\nThe click-through rate of an advertisement is the number of times a click is made on the ad, divided by the number of times the ad is \"served\", that is, shown (also called impressions), expressed as a percentage:\n\n\nClick-through rates for banner ads have decreased over time. When banner ads first started to appear, it was not uncommon to have rates above five percent. They have fallen since then, currently averaging closer to 0.2 or 0.3 percent. In most cases, a 2% click-through rate would be considered very successful, though the exact number is hotly debated and would vary depending on the situation. The average click-through rate of 3% in the 1990s declined to 2.4%–0.4% by 2002. Since advertisers typically pay more for a high click-through rate, getting many click-throughs with few purchases is undesirable to advertisers. Similarly, by selecting an appropriate advertising site with high affinity (e.g., a movie magazine for a movie advertisement), the same banner can achieve a substantially higher CTR. Though personalized ads, unusual formats, and more obtrusive ads typically result in higher click-through rates than standard banner ads, overly intrusive ads are often avoided by viewers.\n\nModern online advertising has moved beyond just using banner ads. Popular search engines allow advertisers to display ads in with the search results triggered by a search user. These ads are usually in text format and may include additional links and information like phone numbers, addresses and specific product pages. This additional information moves away from the poor user experience that can be created from intrusive banner ads and provides useful information to the search user, resulting in higher click-through rates for this format of pay-per-click Advertising. Having high click-through rate isn't the only goal for an online advertiser, who may develop campaigns to raise awareness for the overall gain of valuable traffic, sacrificing some click-through rate for that purpose.\n\nSearch engine advertising has become a significant element of the Web browsing experience. Choosing the right ads for the query and the order in which they are displayed greatly affects the probability that a user will see and click on each ad. This ranking has a strong impact on the revenue the search engine receives from the ads. Further, showing the user an ad that they prefer to click on improves user satisfaction. For these reasons, there is an increasing interest in accurately estimating the click-through rate of ads in a recommender system.\n\nAn email click-through rate is defined as the number of recipients who click one or more links in an email and landed on the sender's website, blog, or other desired destination. More simply, email click-through rates represent the number of clicks that your email generated.\n\nEmail click-through rate is expressed as a percentage, and calculated by dividing the number of click throughs by the number of tracked message deliveries.\n\nMost email marketers use this metrics along with open rate, bounce rate and other metrics, to understand the effectiveness and success of their email campaign. In general there is no ideal click-through rate. This metric can vary based on the type of email sent, how frequently emails are sent, how the list of recipients is segmented, how relevant the content of the email is to the audience, and many other factors. Even time of day can affect click-through rate. Sunday appears to generate considerably higher click-through rates on average when compared to the rest of the week.\n\nEvery year various types of research studies are conducted to track the overall effectiveness of click-through rates in email marketing.\n\nExperts on Search engine optimization (SEO) have claimed since the mid-2010s that click-through rate has an impact on organic rankings. Numerous case studies have been published to support this theory. Proponents supporting this theory often claim that click-through rate is a ranking signal for Google's RankBrain algorithm. In a video interview with Dan Petrovic, he states, \"There is absolutely no shadow of a doubt that CTR is a ranking signal. CTR is not only a ranking signal, CTR is essential to Google’s self-analytics.\" In an article by Neil Patel, Patel quotes Matt Cutts saying, \"It doesn’t really matter how often you show up. It matters how often you get clicked on...\" He also cites a study where a 20% increase in click-through rates resulted in 30% more organic clicks.\n\nOpponents of this theory claim click-through rate has little or no impact on organic rankings. Bartosz Góralewicz published the results of an experiment on Search Engine Land where he claims, \"Despite popular belief, click-through rate is not a ranking factor. Even massive organic traffic won’t affect your website’s organic positions.\" More recently, Barry Schwartz wrote on Search Engine Land, \"...Google has said countless times, in writing, at conferences, that CTR is not used in their ranking algorithm.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2064622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064622", "title": "History of Brazil since 1985", "text": "History of Brazil since 1985\n\nBrazilian history since 1985, also known as the Sixth Brazilian Republic or New Republic, is the contemporary epoch in the history of Brazil, beginning when civilian government was restored after a 21-year-long military regime established after the 1964 coup d'état. The negotiated transition to democracy reached its climax with the indirect election of Tancredo Neves PMDB by Congress. Neves belonged to Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, an opposition party that had always opposed the military regime. He was the first civilian president to be elected since 1964.\n\nNeves was set to take over from General João Figueiredo, the last of the military junta presidents appointed by their predecessor. The transition was hailed as the dawn of a New Republic (\"Nova República\") in contrast with \"República Velha\" (Old Republic), the first epoch of the Brazilian Republic, from 1889 until 1930. It became synonymous with the contemporary phase of the Brazilian Republic and the political institutions established in the wake of the country's re-democratization.\n\nPresident-elect Tancredo Neves fell ill on the eve of his inauguration and could not attend it. His running mate, José Sarney, was inaugurated as vice president and served in Neves' stead as acting president. As Neves died without having ever taken the oath of office, Sarney then succeeded to the presidency. The first phase of the Brazilian \"New Republic\", ranging from the inauguration of José Sarney in 1985 until the inauguration of Fernando Collor in 1990, is often considered a transitional period as the 1967–1969 constitution remained in effect, the executive still had veto powers, and the president was able to rule by decree. The transition was considered definitive after Brazil's current constitution, drawn up in 1988, entered full effect in 1990.\n\nIn 1986, elections were called for a National Constituent Assembly that would draft and adopt a new Constitution for the country. The Constituent Assembly began deliberations in February 1987 and concluded its work on October 5, 1988. Brazil's current Constitution was promulgated in 1988 and completed the democratic institutions. The new Constitution replaced the authoritarian legislation that still remained from the military regime.\n\nIn 1989 Brazil held its first elections for president by direct popular ballot since the 1964 coup. Fernando Collor won the election and was inaugurated on March 15, 1990 as the first president elected under the 1988 Constitution.\n\nSince then, seven presidential terms have elapsed, without rupture to the constitutional order: \n\nThe last military president, João Figueiredo signed a general amnesty into law and turned Geisel's \"distensão\" into a gradual \"abertura\" (the \"opening\" of the political system), saying he wanted \"to make this country a democracy\".\n\nThe transition towards democracy that ended the military regime in 1985 and spurred the adoption of a new, democratic, Constitution in 1988, was, however, troubled.\n\nHard-liners reacted to the \"abertura\" with a series of terrorist bombings. In April 1981 after a long string of bombings and other violence a bomb went off prematurely and killed one of the men in the car with it and badly injured the other. They were shown to be working with the DOI-CODI \"under the direct orders of the \"Command of the First Army\" in terrorism, but nobody was punished. The incident and the regime's inaction strengthened the public's resolve to end military rule. Moreover, Figueiredo faced other significant problems, such as soaring inflation, declining productivity, and mounting foreign debt.\n\nPolitical liberalization and the declining world economy contributed to Brazil's economic and social problems. In 1978 and 1980, huge strikes took place in the industrial ring around São Paulo. Protesters asserted that wage increases indexed to the inflation rate were far below an acceptable standard of living. Union leaders, including the future three-time presidential candidate and president Luís Inácio da Silva, were arrested for violating national security laws. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) imposed a painful austerity program on Brazil. Under that program, Brazil was required to hold down wages to fight inflation. In the north, northeast, and even in the relatively prosperous Rio Grande do Sul, impoverished rural people occupied unused private land, forcing the government to create a new land reform ministry. Tension with the Roman Catholic Church, the major voice for societal change, peaked in the early 1980s with the expulsion of foreign priests involved in political and land reform issues.\n\nTo attack the soaring debt, Figueiredo's administration stressed exports — food, natural resources, automobiles, arms, clothing, shoes, even electricity — and expanded petroleum exploration by foreign companies. In foreign relations, the objective was to establish ties with any country that would contribute to Brazilian economic development. Washington was kept at a certain distance, and the North-South dialogue was emphasized.\n\nIn 1983, the economy floundered as the gross domestic product declined by 5.0%, the impact of which was accelerated by rising inflation and the failure of political leadership. Figueiredo's heart condition led to bypass surgery in the United States, removing him from control of the situation. In an impressive display, millions of Brazilians took to the streets in all the major cities demanding a direct vote (Diretas Já!) in the choice of the next president. In April 1984, Congress failed to achieve the necessary numbers to give the people their wish, and the choice was left to an electoral college. Figueiredo did not act forcefully to back a preference, so it became a scramble as candidates pursued the collegial votes.\n\nIn 1984, many public demonstrations were held in major Brazilian cities which made it clear that military rule could not continue. Brazilians started to demand change in the electoral system, aiming to directly elect the President (Diretas Já). As public pressure built up, the opposition Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (\"Partido do Movimento Democrático Brasileiro\", PMDB) proposed a legislation to implement this change (). As Congress was controlled by the pro-government Democratic Social Party (PDS, formerly ARENA), the law failed to pass.\n\nTancredo Neves of Minas Gerais, Getúlio Vargas' minister of justice in the 1950s, and former federal deputy, senator, and prime minister, seized the momentum. Neves had a reputation for honesty and was able to build up an alliance between the PMDB and defectors from the PDS who founded the Liberal Front Party (PFL). The Democratic Alliance (Aliança Democrática) presented itself as supporting 1984 demands for political change and the end of military rule.\n\nThe party presented Neves as an opposition candidate against Paulo Maluf. Neves was elected by a majority vote of the Parliament on January 15, 1985. However, Neves collapsed the night before his inauguration in March, and died on April 21, so the presidency passed to Vice President José Sarney (president, 1985–90), long-time supporter of the military regime. The hope that 1985 would provide a quick transition to a new regime faded as Brazilians watched the turn of events in a state of shock. Like the regime changes of 1822, 1889, 1930, 1946, and 1964, the 1985 change also proved to be long and difficult.\n\nSarney's government fulfilled Tancredo's promises of amending the Constitution inherited from the military regime and calling elections for a National Constituent Assembly with full powers to draft and enact a new democratic constitution for the country. Ulysses Guimarães, who led the civilian resistance to the military rule, was chosen by his fellow Assembly members to preside over the Constituent Assembly, which sat in session from February 1987 to October 1988.\n\nThe Constituent Assembly proclaimed a new constitution in October 1988 and restored civil and public rights such as freedom of speech, independent public prosecutors (Ministério Público), economic freedom, direct and free elections and universal healthcare. It also de-centralized government, empowering local and state governments.\n\nAs the political transition developed, the economy suffered high inflation and stagnation. Sarney tried to control inflation with many economic plans: Plano Cruzado 1, Plano Cruzado 2, Plano Verão. All of them included government price controls, price freezes and ultimately a change in the national currency. During Sarney's presidency, Brazil had three currency units: the cruzeiro, the cruzado and the cruzado novo. Economic domestic troubles led to default on Brazil's international debt in 1988. This closed international financial markets for Brazil and its economic situation worsened.\n\nDespite the initial decrease, inflation returned higher than before the economic plans, reaching 84% a month in 1990. The government's inability to deal with inflation ultimately led parties that had led the political transition to lose the 1989 elections, the first elections under the new Constitution and the first presidential elections to take place by direct popular ballot since the 1964 military coup.\n\nThe first direct presidential election after 29 years was held on October 15, 1989 (first round) and November 15, 1989 (second round). Fernando Collor de Mello won the run-off election with 53% of the vote for a five-year term.\n\nCollor's agenda focused on fighting corruption from Sarney's administration and completing the transition from the 21 years of military rule to civilian government. Economic changes aimed to control soaring inflation and modernization.\n\nAlthough he had massive support amongst the voters, the administration had a small parliamentary base as Collor's recently founded party had few deputies and no senators and faced fierce opposition from parties that had splintered from the Democratic Alliance: the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), Liberals (PFL), and Social Democrats (Brazilian Social Democracy Party, PSDB).\n\nHis first act was known as Plano Collor: all savings accounts and financial investment were frozen, and the national currency was changed from the cruzado novo to the cruzeiro (NCz$1,000 = Cr$1). Plano Collor initially succeeded, but after six months failed in its primary goal, as inflation accelerated again. This started to erode Collor's prestige. Economic changes included lifting import barriers, exposing local companies to international competition. Many companies went bankrupt or were sold, unemployment grew and support for the government deteriorated.\n\nParliamentary elections were held on October 15, 1990 and the government failed to win a reliable base in Congress and the president began to lose political support.\n\nIn May 1991, Collor's brother Pedro Collor accused him of corruption, specifically of condoning an influence peddling scheme run by his campaign treasurer, Paulo César Farias. Congress and the Federal Police of Brazil began an investigation. Some months later, with the investigation progressing and under fire, Collor went on national television to ask for the people's support, by going out on the street and protesting against coup forces. On August 11, 1992, students organized by the União Nacional dos Estudantes (UNE), thousands of students protested on the streets against Collor. They often painted their faces, frequently in a mixture of the colors of the flag and protest-black, which led to calling them \"\"Cara-pintada\"\" (Painted Faces).\n\nOn August 26, 1992, the final congressional inquiry report was released, where it was proven that Fernando Collor had personal expenses paid for by money raised by Paulo César Farias through his influence peddling scheme. Impeachment proceedings began in the lower house of congress on September 29, 1992. Collor was impeached, and subsequently removed from office by a vote of 441 for and 38 votes against. Fernando Collor resigned his term in office just before the Brazilian Senate was to vote for his impeachment. The senate voted to impeach him anyway, suspending his political rights for eight years.\n\nHis vice-president, Itamar Franco, assumed the presidency for the remainder of Collor's term.\n\nFranco distanced himself from Collor and made arrangements for a coalition government that included the main leaders from the PMDB, PFL, and PSDB. Franco appointed Fernando Henrique Cardoso as Minister of Treasury and gave him the responsibility of controlling inflation – the average annual inflation rate from 1990 to 1995 was 764%. Cardoso put together a successful stabilization program, Plano Real, that brought inflation to 6% annually. Franco's approval ratings rose and he supported Cardoso to succeed him.\n\nIn the October 3, 1994 presidential elections, Fernando Henrique Cardoso was elected with 54% of the votes.\n\nFernando Henrique Cardoso started his first term on January 1, 1995 and was reelected in 1998. President Cardoso sought to establish the basis for long-term stability and growth and to reduce Brazil's extreme socioeconomic imbalances. His proposals to Congress included constitutional amendments to open the Brazilian economy to greater foreign investment and to implement sweeping reforms – including social security, government administration, and taxation – to reduce excessive public sector spending and improve government efficiency.\n\nHis government is credited with providing economic stability to a country marred by years of hyperinflation. At the same time the Mexican, 1997 East Asian, 1998 Russian and 1999–2002 Argentinian economic crises diminished the prospects for economic growth during his presidency.\n\nDuring his administration many state-owned companies were privatized, and agencies created for the first time to regulate many sectors of industry such as energy, oil, and aviation. Cardoso's administration also put a strong focus on external affairs. In addition to acceding to the WTO and participating in the Uruguay Round, Brazil participated in the INTERFET peacekeeping mission to East Timor.\n\n In 2002, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the Workers' Party (PT) won the presidency with more than 60% of the national vote. In the first months of his term, inflation rose perilously, reflecting the markets' uncertainty about the government's monetary policy. However, the markets' confidence in the government was regained as Lula chose to maintain his predecessor's policies, meaning the continuation of Central Bank's task of keeping inflation down. Since then, the country has undergone considerable economic growth and employment expansion. On the other hand, Lula's mainstream economic policies disappointed his most radical leftist allies, which led to a schism in the PT (Workers' Party) that resulted in the creation of PSOL.\n\nIn 2005, Roberto Jefferson, chairman of the Brazilian Labour Party (PTB), was implicated in a bribery case. As a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry was set up, Jefferson testified that the MPs were being paid monthly stipends to vote for government-backed legislation. In August of the same year, after further investigation, campaign manager Duda Mendonça admitted that he had used illegal undeclared money to finance the PT electoral victory of 2002. The money in both cases was found to have originated from private sources as well as from the advertising budget of state-owned enterprises headed by political appointees, both laundered through Duda's Mendonça advertising agency. These incidents were dubbed the Mensalão scandal. On August 24, 2007, the Brazilian Supreme Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal) accepted the indictments of 40 individuals relating to the Mensalão scandal, most of whom were former or current federal deputies, and all of whom were still allies of the Brazilian president.\n\nThe loss of support resulting from these scandals was outweighed by the president's popularity among voters of the lower classes, whose income per capita was increased as a consequence of higher employment, the expansion of domestic credit to consumers and government social welfare programs. The stable and solid economic situation of the country, which Brazil had not experienced in the previous 20 years, with fast growth in production both for internal consumers and exports as well as a soft but noticeable decrease in social inequality, may also partially explain the popularity of Lula's administration even after several corruption scandals involving important politicians connected to Lula and to PT. Hence Lula's re-election in 2006: After almost winning in the first round, Lula won the run-off against Geraldo Alckmin of the PSDB (Brazilian Social Democracy Party), by 20 million votes.\n\nFollowing Lula's second victory, his approval ratings rose again, fueled by continued of the economical and social achievements, to a record 80%, the highest for a Brazilian president since the end of the military regime. The focus of Lula's second term was further stimulation of the economy by investments in infrastructure and measures to keep expanding domestic credit to producers, industry, commerce and consumers alike. In 2009, Brazil's economic rise was temporarily halted by the worldwide financial crisis, forcing the government to implement a temporary tax relief policy in strategic segments of the economy like automobiles and construction. These measures helped the country prevent a long-term recession and ensured a quick recovery to Brazil's economic ascension.\n\nAnother mark of Lula's second term was his effort to expand Brazil's political influence worldwide, especially after G20 (in which Brazil and other emerging economies participate) replaced the G8 as the main world forum of discussions. Just like his predecessor, he was an active defender of reform of the United Nations Security Council. Brazil is one of four nations (the others being Germany, India and Japan) officially coveting a permanent seat on the council. Lula saw himself as a friendly, peacemaker and conciliator head of state. Managing to befriend leaders of rival countries from the likes of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama from the United States to Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez, Cuban former president Fidel Castro, President of Bolivia Evo Morales, and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, fueling protests inside and outside the country due to Ahmadinejad's polemical anti-Semitic statements. Lula took part in a deal with the governments of Turkey and Iran regarding Iran's nuclear program despite the United States' (among other nuclear powers) desire to strengthen the sanctions against the country, fearing the possibility of Iran develop nuclear weapons.\n\nDuring the Lula administration the Brazilian Army's most important assignment was being the main force of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, established to bring aid to the Haitian population, and it suffered many casualties during the 2010 Haiti earthquake which claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\nOn October 31, 2010, Dilma Rousseff, also from the Worker's Party, was the first woman elected President of Brazil, with her term beginning in the January 1, 2011. In her victory speech, Rousseff, who had also been a key member of Lula's administration, made clear that her mission during her term would be to continue her predecessor's policies to mitigate poverty and ensure continued economic growth.\n\nChallenges faced by Rousseff in her first term included managing infrastructure projects to increase economic activity, with special attention to the twelve cities that would host the upcoming 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, especially Rio de Janeiro, a special case as it would also hold the 2016 Summer Olympics, as well as measures to protect the Brazilian economy from the ongoing economic crises in Europe and the United States. These contributed to reducing the growth of national GDP during the first half of her term, compared to her predecessor's tenure.\n\nOn June 2011, Rouseff announced a program called \"Brasil Sem Miséria\" (Brazil Without Poverty), with the ambitious goal of drastically reducing absolute poverty in Brazil by the end of her term. Poverty afflicted 16 million people, a little less than a tenth of the population. The program involved broadening the Bolsa Família social welfare program and creating new job opportunities and establishing professional certification programs. In 2012, another program labeled \"Brasil Carinhoso\" (Tenderful Brazil) was launched with the objective of providing extra care to all children in Brazil who lived below the poverty threshold.\n\nDespite criticism from the domestic and international press regarding lower-than-expected economic results achieved during her first term as head of the government and of the measures taken to solve it, Rouseff's approval rates reached levels higher than any other president since the end of the military regime until a wave of protests struck the country in mid 2013 reflecting dissatisfaction from the people with current transport, healthcare and education policies, among other issues affecting the popularity not only of the president, but of several other governors and mayors from key areas in the country as well.\n\nIn 2014, Rousseff won a second term by a narrow margin, but failed to prevent her popularity from falling. In June 2015, her approval dropped to less than 10%, after another wave of protests, this time organized by opponents who wanted her out of power, amid revelations that numerous politicians, including some from her party, were being investigated for accepting bribes from the state-owned energy company Petrobras from 2003 to 2010, while she was on the company's board of directors.\n\nAfter a process of impeachment opened against Rousseff in late 2015 culminated with her temporarily removed from power in 12 May 2016, vice-president Michel Temer took office temporarily until the final trial was concluded in 31 August 2016, when Rousseff was officially impeached and Temer was sworn president until the end of the term.

{"id": "2064628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064628", "title": "Georges Hébert", "text": "Georges Hébert\n\nGeorges Hébert (27 April 1875 – 2 August 1957) was a pioneering physical educator in the French military who developed a system of physical education and training known as \"la méthode naturelle\" (\"Natural Method\") or hebertism (built on his name), which combined the training of a wide variety of physical capacities with the training of courage and ethics.\n\nHébert was born in Paris. While an officer in the French Navy prior to the First World War, Hébert was stationed in the town of St. Pierre, on the island of Martinique in the Caribbean Sea. In 1902 the town fell victim to a catastrophic volcanic eruption.\n\nHébert was the first officier to land in the city. He coordinated the escape and rescue of some seven hundred people from this disaster. This experience had a profound effect on him, and reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism. He eventually developed this ethos into his personal motto, \"Être fort pour être utile\" (\"Be strong to be helpful\").\n\nHébert had travelled extensively throughout the world and was impressed by the physical development and movement skills of indigenous peoples in Africa and elsewhere:\n\nTheir bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, resistant and yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature.\n\nHebertism as we know it today is the fruit of a life time work. There are significant differences between Hébert's early books and the last edition.\n\nWe present here the latest version of his ideas.\nBeyond his observations of the natural movements of indigenous people, Hébert's method is a synthesis of various influences, including but not limited to:\n\n\nMost of its philosophy can be found in the 7 first chapters of the 'tome 1' book. It can be summarized in \n\nphysical training: heart, lungs, muscles but also speed, skills, endurance, resistance, balance\n\nmental training: energy, willpower, courage, coolness, firmness\n\nethical behavior: friendship, collective work, altruism\nwalking, running, quadrudepy, climbing, jumping, balance, lifting and carrying, throwing, defence, swimming\n\n\nA physical training but also...\n\nHebert wrote:\n\nGeorges Hébert's teaching continued to expand between and during the two wars, becoming the standard system of French military physical education.\n\nHe was also an early advocate of the benefits of exercise for women. In his work \"Muscle and Plastic Beauty\", which appeared in 1921, Hébert criticized not only the fashion of corsetry but also the physical inactivity imposed upon women by contemporary European society. By following the natural method of synthesized physical, energetic and moral development, he wrote, women could develop self-confidence, will-power and athletic ability just as well as their male counterparts.\n\nHébert wrote:\n\n<poem>A (Natural Method) session is composed of exercises belonging to the ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement, climbing, equilibrium (balancing), throwing, lifting, defending and swimming.\n\nA training session consists, then, of exercises in an outdoor environment, perhaps a few hundred meters to several kilometers, during which, one walks, one runs, one jumps, one progresses quadrupedally, one climbs, one walks in unstable balance, one raises and one carries, one throws, one fights and one swims.\n\nThis course can be carried out in two ways:\n\n\nAll of the exercises can be carried out while progressing through this environment. A session can last from 20 to 60 minutes.</poem>\n\nThus, Hébert was among the earliest proponents of \"le parcours\", or obstacle course, form of physical training, which is now standard in the military and has led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses. In fact, woodland challenge courses comprising balance beams, ladders, rope swings and so-on are often still described as \"Hebertism\" or \"Hebertisme\" courses both in Europe and in North America. It may even be possible to trace modern adventure playground equipment back to Hébert's original designs in the early 1900s.\n\nAs a former sailor, Hébert may have patterned some of his \"stations\" on the obstacles that are found on the deck of a ship; he was also a strong proponent of \"natural\" or spontaneous training in non-designed environments.\n\nThe year 1955 marked the 50th birthday of the Natural Method, and Hébert was named Commander of the Legion of Honor by the French government in recognition of his many services to his country. In 1957, George Hébert, by then suffering from general paralysis, cultivated the admiration of his entourage by relearning how to walk, speak and write. He died on August 2 of that year in Tourgéville, Calvados, France.\n\nThere are still schools and gymnasia throughout Europe that are promoting the Natural Method of physical training, some maintaining their own elaborate \"parcours\" in natural surroundings.\n\nMost recently, Hébert's teachings have been an important influence on the emergence of parkour as a training discipline in its own right. Also, in the first decade of the 21st century, the French American physical education instructor Erwan Le Corre took inspiration from Hébert's \"méthode naturelle\" (\"natural method\") and has expanded on the training to form a system of natural movement which he has named \"MovNat\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

A descendant of the Thai royal family, he was the great-grandson of King Rama II. His final two terms as PM sandwiched the only term of his brother, Kukrit Pramoj.\n\nBorn a son of Prince Khamrob and mother Daeng (Bunnag), he was educated at Trent College in Derbyshire before obtaining a BA second class honours degree in jurisprudence from Worcester College, Oxford. He continued his studies at Gray's Inn, London, receiving first honours. After returning to Thailand he studied Thai Law, and following six months as a trainee at the Supreme Court, he started to work at the Justice Civil Court. Later, he was transferred to the Foreign Ministry and in 1940 was sent to the United States as Thai ambassador.\n\nJapanese forces invaded Thailand early on the morning of 8 December 1941, shortly after the attack on the United States at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The Prime Minister, Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, ordered a ceasefire at noon, entering into an armistice that allowed the Japanese to use Thai military installations in their invasion of Malaya and Burma. On 21 December, a formal military alliance with Japan was concluded.\n\nThe Phibun government declared war on Great Britain and the United States on 25 January 1942. Although the Thai ambassador in London delivered Thailand's declaration of war to the British administration, Seni refused to do so. Instead, he considered organising a resistance movement in the United States.\n\nFollowing a late morning interview with Secretary Cordell Hull on 8 December, Seni returned to his legation to confer with his staff. The ambassador and his staff unanimously decided to cast their lot with the Allies. Late the same afternoon, he returned to the State Department to offer their services to the Allied cause. Blaming pro-Japanese elements for the early Thai surrender, he spoke to Hull of unfreezing Thai assets in the United States for further prosecution of the war and suggested that the Thais in the country might \"organise and preserve a government of true patriotic, liberty-loving Thais while his government is in the clutches of Japan.\"\n\nThe State Department decided to act as if Seni continued to represent Thailand. This enabled him to tap into the frozen Thai assets. When asked to draw up a list of \"reliable and influential Thai nationals known to be definitely patriotic and anti-Japanese\" by the State Department (at the suggestion of John P. Davies), Seni named Regent Pridi Phanomyong, politicians Khuang Aphaiwong and Wilat Osathanon, and diplomats Phraya Sisena and Direk Jayanama as \"reliables\".\n\nSeni advanced plans to mobilise Thai volunteers in support of the Allies. Beyond the legation staffers and their families, most other Thai residents were students enrolled at colleges and universities, including institutions such as Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Cornell. Many chose to stay following the Thai declaration of war in January, refusing repatriation. Most, like Seni, saw their nation as a victim of Japanese aggression.\n\nSeni became prime minister on 17 September 1945, the day he returned to Bangkok. However, he found his position as the head of a cabinet packed with Pridi's loyalists quite uncomfortable. Northeastern populist politicians like Tiang Sirikhanth and Bangkok newcomers like Sanguan Tularaksa were not people the aristocratic Seni preferred to associate with. They, in turn, viewed Seni as an elitist who was entirely out of touch with Thailand's political realities. Pridi continued to wield power behind the scenes as he had done during the Khuang government. The regent's looming presence and overarching authority rankled the proud, thin-skinned Seni, fuelling a personal animosity that would poison Thailand’s postwar politics.\n\nThe Pramoj brothers subsequently joined the newly formed Democrat Party in 1946, which was for the most part made up of royalists and conservative reactionaries. Seni would spend the next two years vigorously carrying out a personal campaign against Pridi. Earlier in the year he had called for an investigation of the use of the US$500,000 in Thai assets unfrozen by the US government that he had turned over to the OSS. Insinuating the money had been transferred to the senior statesman, he lamented that \"most of the money had not been spent for what it was intended.\" An independent investigatory panel, however, found no mistake, concluding that the Free Thai had \"performed remarkably well\" and that the Thai people \"owe a great deal to them.\" The outcome left the ex-prime minister looking extremely foolish.\n\nSeni soon got his revenge, however. In the immediate aftermath of King Ananda Mahidol's death, Seni and his party launched relentless attacks against the government and accused Pridi of being responsible for the king's assassination, the implausibility of the charge notwithstanding.\n\nIn November 1947 the Democrat Party cooperated with disgruntled army officers to oust the government of Thawan Thamrongnawasawat. As part of the deal, Seni was awarded a cabinet portfolio in Khuang's coup-installed cabinet.\n\nOn Tuesday, 14 June 1949, in a lecture delivered before the Siam Society, Seni pleaded, \"[I] happen to belong to that peculiar species known as politicians who are in the incorrigible habit of attempting to accomplish the impossible.\" Word had gotten around that his brother and he had been \"getting up a little English translation of some of King Mongkut's public papers and private correspondence...without actually putting it to a final execution.\" He chooses to speak of the king in his capacity as a legislator, \"because legislation is the field I am more closely familiar with than any other.\" Seni provides, \"ample evidence to show that the King was the first and foremost democrat of our country,\" and quotes from an Act declaring an election whereby \"any person, even though he be a slave, who is believed to be so sufficiently possessed of wisdom and restraint as to be able to give clear and satisfactory judgment in accordance with truth, justice and the law may be elected as judge.\" With regard to the 1944 semi-fictionalized biographical novel \"Anna and the King of Siam\" and the 1946 Hollywood film of the same title, Seni quotes from Acts and judicial decisions that give the lie to the fiction.\n\nSeni returned to his job as a lawyer, but remained active in the Democrat Party during the period of military rule. He served again briefly as prime minister from 15 February to 13 March 1975, when he was defeated and replaced by his younger brother, Rajawongse Kukrit Pramoj. However, Kukrit's government only lasted until 20 April 1976, when Seni regained the top political office.\n\nSeni's final term was a time of crisis in the nation. A right-wing backlash against leftist student demonstrators culminated in the Thammasat University massacre on 6 October 1976, the military forced him out of office and installed hard-line royalist Tanin Kraivixien as premier.\n\nSeni decided to resign as the leader of the Democrat Party and left politics permanently. He worked as a lawyer until his retirement.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2064645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064645", "title": "Amerasia", "text": "Amerasia\n\nAmerasia was a journal of Far Eastern affairs best known for the 1940s \"Amerasia Affair\" in which several of its staff and their contacts were suspected of espionage and charged with unauthorized possession of government documents.\n\nThe journal was founded in 1937 by Frederick Vanderbilt Field, who also chaired the editorial board, and Philip Jaffe, a naturalized American born in Russia. It was edited by Jaffe and Kate L. Mitchell. Field was the publication's chief financial backer. Jaffe was a friend of Earl Browder, general secretary of the Communist Party of the United States. The journal's staffers and writers included a number Communists or former Communists, including Chi Ch'ao-ting, and at one time Joseph Milton Bernstein, who has been alleged to be a Soviet agent. The journal had a small circulation and sold for fifteen cents a copy. It ceased publication in 1947.\n\nKenneth Wells, an analyst for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), noticed that an article printed in the January 26, 1945, issue of \"Amerasia\" was almost identical to a 1944 report he had written on Thailand. OSS agents investigated by breaking into the New York offices of \"Amerasia\" on March 11, 1945, where they found hundreds of classified documents from the Department of State, the Navy, and the OSS.\n\nThe OSS notified the State Department, which asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate. The FBI's investigation indicated that Jaffe and Mitchell had probably obtained the documents from Emanuel Larsen, a State Department employee, and Andrew Roth, a lieutenant with the Office of Naval Intelligence. Other suspects include freelance reporter Mark Gayn, whose coverage of the war in Asia appeared regularly in \"Collier's\" and \"Time\" magazine, and State Department \"China Hand\" John S. Service.\n\nFBI surveillance established that Jaffe met with Service several times in Washington and New York and reported that at one meeting \"Service, according to the microphone surveillance, apparently gave Jaffe a document which dealt with matters the Chinese had furnished to the United States government in confidence.\"\n\nAn FBI summary reported that Jaffe visited the Soviet consulate in New York and that two days after a meeting with Service, Jaffe had a four-hour meeting in his home with Communist Party Secretary Earl Browder and Tung Pi-wu, the Chinese Communist representative to the United Nations Charter Conference.\n\nIn carrying out its investigation, the FBI broke into the offices of \"Amerasia\" and the homes of Gayn and Larsen and installed bugs and phone taps.\n\nOn June 6, 1945, the FBI arrested Jaffe, Mitchell, Larsen, Roth, Gayn and Service. Simultaneously, the \"Amerasia\" offices were raided and 1,700 classified State Department, Navy, OSS, and Office of War Information documents were seized.\n\nBecause no evidence was found indicating that any documents had been forwarded directly to a foreign power, the Justice Department decided not to seek an indictment under the Espionage Act. Instead, it sought to indict the six for unauthorized possession and transmittal of government documents. Service, the only State Department officer arrested, had given Jaffe approximately eight documents, copies of his own reports on conditions in China, that represented non-sensitive intelligence that diplomats routinely shared with journalists. The grand jury voted unanimously against indicting him.\n\nThe grand jury indicted Jaffe, Larsen, and Roth. Before the trial began, Larsen's defense attorney learned of the FBI's illegal break-in at Larsen's home. The Justice Department, fearing a loss at trial if evidence were excluded because it was obtained illegally, arranged a deal. Jaffe agreed to plead guilty and pay a fine of $2,500, while Larsen pleaded no contest and was fined $500. The charges against Roth were dropped.\n\nThe \"Amerasia Affair\" became a touchstone for those who wanted to raise alarms about espionage and the possible Communist infiltration of the State Department. Senator Joseph McCarthy often spoke of the case in these terms, maintaining it was a security breach and cover-up of immense proportions.\n\nIn 1946, a House Judiciary subcommittee chaired by Rep. Samuel F. Hobbs and, in 1950, the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Investigation of Loyalty of State Department Employees, commonly known as the Tydings Committee, investigated the \"Amerasia\" case. In 1955, the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee sought the \"Amerasia\" materials from the Justice Department. The records were declassified and the Justice Department delivered 1,260 documents to the Subcommittee in 1956 and 1957.\n\nThe Senate Internal Security Subcommittee published a two-volume report, \"The Amerasia Papers: A Clue to the Catastrophe of China\", in 1970. It ascribed the communist revolution in China in part to the Communist sympathies of the Chinese policy experts in the Foreign Service, known as the \"China Hands\".\n\n\n"}

In Trinity Term 1960, he was president of the Oxford Union. He was commissioned in the Royal Navy, then worked as a civil servant at HM Treasury before becoming a journalist and, for 10 years, economics editor with \"The Times\".\n\nJay married Margaret Callaghan, the daughter of Labour politician James Callaghan, in 1961. In 1977, when his father-in-law had become Prime Minister, Jay was appointed to the post of Ambassador to the United States by the Foreign Secretary, his friend David Owen. As Jay was just 40 years old, was not a diplomat and had never held any public office, this appointment caused some controversy and accusations of nepotism.\n\nHe married secondly, in 1986, Emma Bettina, daughter of the museum curator and writer Peter Thornton. He has seven children.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Jay became the principal presenter of the London Weekend Television Sunday news analysis programme \"Weekend World\".

The current variation gold trigger lever-action .22 Caliber \"Golden\" 39A is produced by the Marlin Firearms Co. of New Haven, Connecticut. The Golden 39A is constructed in Remington’s Marlin factory in Ilion, NY.\n\nThe Golden Model 39A started life as the Marlin Model 1891, the first lever action rifle ever chambered in .22LR and the magazine was loaded through a conventional side gate in the receiver. The tubular magazine was changed to front-loading with the Model 1892, due to the difficulties of receiver feeding the small rimfire round. The 1892 gave way to the takedown Model 1897, which became the Model 39 in 1921 and Model 39-A in 1939. The Golden Mountie Model 39A was introduced in 1954. The 39 was produced until 1983 when the current Golden 39A was introduced. Changes between models were so minimal the rifle is considered to have been continually produced to the same basic specifications for over 100 years. The Model 39-A did not have a cross hammer safety, whereas the current Golden Model 39A has had one since introduction in 1983. The Golden 39A is still considered one of the finest examples of a lever .22 rifle, and one of the most accurate .22 rifles ever produced. It is also the best-selling lever rimfire in U.S. history. Additionally \"mountie\" versions have been produced at various points in the rifle's life which featured a shorter 20\" barrel and a straight stock. These rifles have been alternately called Model 39M or 1897 Mountie. The Mountie has a magazine capacity of 20 Short, 16 Long or 15 Long Rifle .22 cartridges.\n\nSince the early 1950s Marlin has used their proprietary Micro-Groove rifling in the Model 39A. This rifling uses many small lands and grooves rather than 2, 4, or 6 deeper grooves used by the majority of rifle makers. The rifling is also made to a 1 in 16\" right hand twist. The combination of these two factors arguably adds to the accuracy of the rifle and indeed the 39A's reputation would seem to bear this out.\n\nThe Model Golden 39A is built of forged steel parts and American grown black walnut. It is one of the very few remaining .22 rifles with easy takedown ability (it can be taken apart using a coin). The screw that allows the easy takedown, however, is frequently criticized as it disrupts the otherwise clean lines of the rifle. Further, in the event of a malfunction which prevents the breech from closing, takedown becomes impossible until the action can be cleared as the breech must be closed before takedown. The Model Golden 39A has a solid-top receiver and side ejection, which makes mounting a scope easy. One source claims that the signature gold trigger was discontinued in favor of a blued trigger between 1982 and 1985, but at least one \"Original Golden 39A\" from 1982 (SN 18260086) was made with the gold trigger, perhaps as a special order.\n\nThe Marlin Model Golden 39A is still commercially available with a 24\" (61 cm) round barrel, a pistol grip, and a signature golden colored trigger. The Golden 39A has a full length steel tubular magazine under the barrel with a brass inner tube and a hammer block safety. Magazine capacity is as follows: 26 .22 Short, 21 .22 Long, or 19 .22 Long Rifle (total capacity is often cited as 26 Short, 21 Long or 19 Long Rifle counting a round preloaded in the firing chamber). Many previous variations of the model are still available from used gun dealers.\n\nOn March 10, 1893 Annie Oakley used a Model 1891 to put 25 shots through one jagged hole in 27 seconds at a distance of 36 feet (12 yds or 11 m) using 22 short cartridges. On the same day she also produced another jagged one-hole group through the center of an Ace of Hearts playing card, while shooting off-hand. Marlin has since made two \"special runs\" of Annie Oakley commemorative 39A rifles to honor Oakley's achievements and fame while using their brand. The first consisted of 500 39A rifles in 1998 which were offered to the general public with another 100 offered only to their employees. In 2000 another run of the special AO guns was made for Davidson's Gallery of Guns again offered to the general public.\n\n\n"}

He was a pioneer of reusable vertical landing single-stage to orbit launch vehicles. As a visionary designer, he is credited with inventing the first version of a recoverable single-stage spacecraft booster, and his contributions influenced spacecraft design.\n\nBono pursued single-stage space launch as simpler and cheaper. He realized to do this he would need to use high specific impulse liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen rocket engines. Afterwards he proposed to make these vehicles reusable. From his ROOST design onwards Bono advocated space launch vehicles without wings, usually using rocket assisted vertical takeoff and landing (VTVL). According to his estimates, wings consisted mostly of dead weight that decreased launch payload mass. He patented a reusable plug nozzle rocket engine which had dual use as a heat shield for atmospheric reentry. His early 1960s concepts influenced later designs like the 1990s Delta Clipper, also from Douglas.\n\nPhilip Bono was born in Brooklyn, New York on 13 January 1921. He graduated from the University of Southern California in 1947 with a degree in mechanical engineering.  After graduation, Bono worked as a research and systems analyst for North American Aviation. Bono began working for Douglas Aircraft company in 1960.

Sil was portrayed by Nabil Shaban.\n\nSil was the representative of the Galatron Mining Corporation present on the planet Varos to extract concessions from the current Governor. Unbeknownst to the Varosians, the mineral Zeiton-7 which was abundant on their planet was not as they thought nearly valueless, but in fact rare, particularly to time travellers. The Varosians lived barely above the poverty line due to the exploitation of companies like the Galatron Mining Corporation and others.\n\nSil was a particularly vile creature by any standard, more so since a fault in his translation device made his voice sibilant, with a ululating laugh. Devoid of morality and dedicated to getting the cheapest price he could for Zeiton ore by any means, he also enjoyed the various tortures which passed for entertainment on Varos, taking particular delight in making the Sixth Doctor's companion Peri suffer a transformation into an avian creature. The Doctor interfered with Sil's plan and informed the Varosians of the true value of their natural resources, forcing Sil to concede to offer the true value of the Zeiton-7.\n\nThe Sixth Doctor and Peri encountered Sil once again on the planet Thoros Beta, where he was that time involved in arms dealing. At the end of the segment of evidence presented by the Valeyard in the Doctor's trial, it appeared that Sil was killed by a rampaging King Yrcanos. It later transpired that the evidence of the Matrix had been tampered with, so it is not clear whether Sil in fact survived.\n\nSil also features in the Philip Martin's novelisation of the never-made serial \"Mission to Magnus\", in which he was in league with the Ice Warriors. Big Finish Productions released a new audio version of \"Mission to Magnus\" in December 2009, with Nabil Shaban reprising his role as Sil.\nSil made another appearance in the Big Finish Audio story \"Antidote to Oblivion\" in 2014 alongside the Sixth Doctor and Flip. A script was pitched for the never-produced Season 27 where he would return along with the Autons and UNIT.\n\nIn early 2019, Reeltime Pictures announced Nabil Shaban would reprise his role as Sil in a new film, entitled \"Sil and the Devil Seeds of Arodor\". Also starring Sophie Aldred, the production was released as DVD, Download, Stream and Blu-ray.\n\n\n\n"}

He is largely known for a tabloid sex scandal.\n\nAfter graduating from Carthage High School, Nixon attended Panola Junior College and Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, where he graduated \"summa cum laude\" in 1982 with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in accounting. Nixon is a Certified Public Accountant. On November 8, 1994, Nixon was elected to the Senate to represent the Third District. He was the first Republican to have served this district since Reconstruction. In the 74th Legislature, Nixon served on three committees: State Affairs, Health and Human Services, and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Agriculture.\n\nDuring the 75th Legislature he served as the Vice-Chair of State Affairs and on Health and Human Services, Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water, Congressional/Legislative Redistricting, and Nominations Committees. During the 76th Legislature he served on Health Services, Intergovernmental Relations, and State Affairs Subcommittee on Infrastructure. Nixon supported business and economic development legislation and had interests in education and the criminal justice system. Nixon chose not to run for reelection in 2000.\n\nIn 1993 he was arrested for having a concealed, loaded weapon in his car with 3 prostitutes.\n\nNixon was arrested February 18, 1997, after he offered $35 for oral sex and intercourse from an undercover Austin police officer posing as a prostitute. The arrest came during a sting in south Austin. After the senator was handcuffed, police found a loaded revolver under the front seat of his car. He was charged with unlawful carrying of a weapon because he did not have a state permit to carry a concealed handgun.\n\nNixon pleaded guilty to the crimes and, despite former Democratic Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock's testimony during sentencing that Nixon deserved leniency, the senator was sentenced to serve six months in jail. He was sentenced to two concurrent six-month sentences. Nixon remained a senator while he served his sentence on weekends.\n\nIn July 2007, Texas State Attorney General unsealed an indictment against Nixon in which he was charged with two counts of official oppression before the 2006 Panola County Fresh Water Supply District board elections. Nixon, an accountant who served as an informal district election administrator, is accused of trying to keep two prospective candidates off the ballot.\n"}

The stark geometry and compact massing of his cottages in Tuxedo Park, New York, influenced Modernist architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright and Robert Venturi.\n\nHe also designed Richardsonian Romanesque institutional buildings, Beaux-Arts mansions, and Manhattan skyscrapers. In Canada, he designed Châteauesque railroad stations and grand hotels for the Canadian Pacific Railway, including Windsor Station in Montreal and Château Frontenac in Quebec City.\n\nPrice was born in Cumberland, Maryland, the son of William and Marian Bruce Price. He studied for a short time at Princeton University. After four years of internship in the office of the Baltimore architects Niernsee & Neilson (1864–68), he began his professional work in Baltimore with Ephraim Francis Baldwin as a partner. Following a brief study trip to Europe, he opened an office in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where he practiced from 1873 to 1876.\n\nHe settled in New York City in 1877, where he worked on a series of domestic projects. These culminated in the design and layout of the exclusive 7,000-acre planned community of Tuxedo Park (1885–86), created by Pierre Lorillard IV. The striking buildings Price designed there, with their severe geometry, compact massing and axial plans, were highly influential in the architectural profession. Eight of Price's houses – including five from Tuxedo Park – were among the one hundred buildings selected for George William Sheldon's landmark survey of American domestic architecture: \"Artistic Country-Seats\" (1886–87). The most famous of these, the Pierre Lorillard V cottage (\"Cottage G\"), though demolished and now known only through photographs, remains an icon of American architecture. Price's daughter wrote in 1911:\n\n\"In beginning Tuxedo, the architect's idea was to fit buildings with the surrounding woods, and the gate-lodge and keep were built of graystone with as much moss and lichen as possible. The shingled cottages were stained with the color of the woods—russets and grays and dull reds—ugly to the taste of a quarter century later, though this treatment did much to neutralize the newness of the buildings—Old World and tradition-haunted as it looks, it is new, incredibly new.\"\nAmong the Manhattan office buildings he designed were the American Surety Building, the St. James Building, the Bank of the Metropolis and the International Bank. He also collaborated with sculptor Daniel Chester French on the Richard Morris Hunt Memorial (1898) in Central Park. He designed a lecture hall and a dormitory at Yale University. His grandest residential commission was Georgian Court, the neo-Georgian estate of George Jay Gould I in Lakewood, New Jersey.\n\nPrice invented, patented, and built the parlor bay-window cars for the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Boston and Albany Railroad. This work prompted the Canadian Pacific Railways to consider his portfolio. He designed the Château Frontenac in Quebec City for the Canadian Pacific (arguably the structure Price is most identified with), as well as the first Banff Springs Hotel in Alberta, and many other hotels and stations.\n\nHe was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects (1890) and belonged to the Architectural League of New York. In 1900, he entered into a partnership with French architect Jules Henri de Sibour, who had earlier worked in his office. The firm continued to use the name \"Bruce Price & de Sibour\" until 1908, five years after Price's death.\n\nIn 1871, Price married Josephine Lee, the daughter of a Wilkes-Barre coal baron. They had two children: Emily Price Post, who became a novelist and the American authority on etiquette, and William, who died in infancy. Price is buried, along with his wife and son, in Hollenback Cemetery in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2064758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064758", "title": "Totopoly", "text": "Totopoly\n\nTotopoly is a commercial board game, based on the events leading up to, and during, a horse race. Originally made in 1938 by Waddingtons, the game is based on a double-sided board, with each side representing a different half of the game.\n\nIn the first section, each player has a set of horses, which start and end this phase in one of two stables. The horses are moved around a loop, and, depending on which squares they land on, the player may collect \"advantage\" and \"disadvantage\" cards, which become important in the game's second phase. Some horses may be eliminated during this part of the game. An unusual feature is that each player throws the dice only once in each turn, the same throw being used for all his or her horses.\n\nThe game's second phase is the actual race. Before starting, bets may be placed on any horse the player wishes. During the race, \"advantage\" cards may be played to improve a horse's position; also, any \"disadvantage\" cards held must be used, with the effect of holding a horse back or cancelling an \"advantage\" card, before the end of the race. As well as the settling of bets, prize money is awarded for first, second and third place.\n\nThe horses use the names of the winners of the Lincolnshire Handicap between the years 1926–37. The race, which was first run at Lincoln racecourse in 1853, is now (with occasional exceptions) run at Doncaster.\n\nA curious aspect of the game, which some people have regarded as a serious design flaw, is that (in the original version) the winner was the person whose horse came in first, irrespective of how much money they had. This meant that the effect of money accrued in the first phase of this version of the game was fairly minor, and in particular the elaborate rules for betting, together with the final race prize money, were actually quite irrelevant. \n\nMore recent editions of the game have an alteration to the rules, allowing the players to make the winner the one who has most money at the end of the race.\n"}

{"id": "2064769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064769", "title": "False start", "text": "False start\n\nIn sports, a false start is a movement by a participant before (or in some cases after) being signaled or otherwise permitted by the rules to start. Depending on the sport and the event, a false start can result in a penalty against the athlete's or team's field position, a warning that a subsequent false start will result in disqualification, or immediate disqualification of the athlete from further competition.\n\nFalse starts are common in racing sports (such as swimming, track, sprinting, and motor sports), where differences are made by fractions of a second and where anxiety to get the best start plays a role in the athletes' behavior.\n\nA race that is started cleanly, on the contrary, is referred to as a \"fair start\" or \"clean start\".\n\nIn American football and Canadian football, a false start is movement by an offensive player (other than the center) after he has taken a set position. For offensive linemen, this movement might be as minimal as a couple of centimeters, although the rule's intent is to prevent offensive players from unfairly drawing the defense offside. A false start brings a 5 yard penalty. Unlike an offside penalty, where the play is run as usual, the play after a false start penalty immediately becomes dead. This is done to prevent a defensive player reacting to a false start from hitting the quarterback while he is going through the snap count, which would make the quarterback more susceptible to injury.\n\nAt the end of the 2005 NFL season, owners complained regarding false start penalties on players whose flinches have little effect upon the start of the play, such as wide receivers. In response, the NFL competition committee has said that they plan to inflict fewer false start penalties on players who line up behind the line of scrimmage.\n\nIn track and field sprints, the sport's governing body, the IAAF, has a rule that if the athlete moves within 0.1 seconds AFTER the gun has fired the athlete has false-started. This figure is based on tests that show the human brain cannot hear and process the information from the start sound in under 0.10 seconds. This rule is only applied at high-level meets where fully automated force or motion sensor devices are built into the starting blocks that are tied via computer with the starter's gun. In the vast majority of lower-level meets, false starts are determined visually by the officials.\n\nCurrently (2016), if there is a false start, they are signalled by firing the starting gun twice. The race is stopped and the offending athletes are immediately disqualified. Before 2003, an athlete making a false start would be allowed another start and would only be disqualified after a second false start. Between 2003 and 2009 (inclusive), if there was a single false start, then the whole field would be warned, and the original offender would be allowed a second start. If anyone made a false start on the second start, then they would be disqualified (even if they did not false start the first time).\n\nAn analysis of start times by sprinters at the 2008 Beijing Olympics demonstrated that male and female sprinters can achieve reaction times of 109 and 121 ms in one out of 1,000 starts. The same analysis showed fewer false starts among the women and it suggests that the apparent sex difference is caused by the use of the same starting block force threshold for males and females. The authors calculated that were the force threshold to be reduced by 22% for females, to take into account their lower rate of developing muscle strength, then males and females would exhibit similar reaction times and numbers of false starts.\n\nIn thoroughbred horse racing, a false start occurs when a horse breaks through the starting gates before they open. There is usually no penalty; the horse is simply reloaded into the gate. In some events, a horse who breaks through the starting gates is disqualified. A notable example was the 2006 Preakness Stakes when Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro broke through the gate early; he was reloaded and the race was started properly. The 1993 Grand National was void because the recall flag to signal a false start was not unfurled, so that most jockeys continued to race.\n\nIn ice hockey, a false start occurs when a team commits a faceoff violation. When this occurs, the player taking the face-off from the offending team is disqualified from the face-off and replaced by a teammate. A second faceoff violation by the same team results in a minor penalty.\n\nIn motor sports that have a standing start (e.g. Formula One), if there is a false start then the offender is subject to a time penalty and the race is normally not restarted. One notable exception was the 1999 European Grand Prix, where six drivers, including the top five qualifiers, jumped the start due to the starting lights malfunctioning. No driver was penalized and the race was restarted.\n\nIn sailing, the race committee decides at the preparatory signal (usually 4 minutes before the start) what the rules on false starting will be by display the P, I, Z or Black Flags.\n\nA P Flag means any boat on the course side (OCS) of the start line at the starting signal must return, clear the start line and then restart. The I Flag means a boat which is OCS must round either end of the start line by coming back to the pre-start side and then restarting (the 'round the ends' rule). The Z Flag means a boat which is OCS in the minute leading up to the start or at the start itself is given a 20% scoring penalty. The Black Flag means a boat which is OCS in the minute leading up to the start or at the start itself is disqualified.\n\nFailing to return to start correctly under the P or I Flag rules means the boat is scored O.C.S and receives points equivalent to disqualification.\n\nIn swimming, any swimmer who starts before the starting signal is given an automatic disqualification. If a step-down command is given before the race starts, the swimmer is not disqualified.\n\nA notable example during the 2008 Olympics occurred when Pang Jiaying was disqualified due to a false start. This allowed Libby Trickett to advance to the final round, in which she won a silver medal.\n\nAt the 2012 London Olympics, Chinese swimmer Sun Yang jumped into the water too early in the 1500m final, but was not judged to have false started because Sun Yang misunderstood 'stand please' as beeping sound by the article 101.1 0.3 D. A similar incident occurred in the women's 100m breaststroke final.\n\nIn a live musical performance, a false start is an intro to a song that is quickly cut short to begin another song. One famous example is Elvis Costello playing \"Radio Radio\" on a television broadcast of \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\nFalse starts, mistakes, or imitations of such, are occasionally included by musicians on finalised albums. The Beatles' songs \"Dig a Pony\" and the North American version of \"I'm Looking Through You\" include them. Electric Light Orchestra's \"Rockaria!\", Green Day's \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\", \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" by Bob Seger, \"Better Man\" by Pearl Jam, \"Tangerine\" by Led Zeppelin, \"Wrong 'Em Boyo\" by The Clash, Monkees song \"Magnolia Simms\", James Blunt's song \"You're Beautiful,\" and \"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\" by The Smiths are other examples, as well as \"I Need A Lover\" by John Cougar Mellencamp. In a YouTube episode of \"Minutes with Murray\", Murray Cook from The Wiggles played two false starts on the Maton electric guitar while playing \"Eagle Rock\".\n"}

As it used to be the only national stadium with such a large capacity in the country for numerous years, Polish Cup matches have been frequently hosted there too, especially the final matches.\n\nThe football pitch at the Silesia Stadium used to be surrounded by a long Motorcycle speedway track. The first World Final held at the stadium in 1973, was run in front of the largest crowd in world speedway history. English speedway 'golden boy' Peter Collins won the 1976 World Final at Silesian.\n\nIvan Mauger won the 1979 World Final at the stadium. Silesian also hosted the Final of the 1974 Speedway World Team Cup, won by England, as well as the Final of both the 1978 and 1981 World Pairs Championships.\n\nIn 1967, the Silesian Stadium hosted the Polish Athletics Championships. In 1969, during an athletics tournament between Poland, East Germany and Soviet Union, Nadezhda Chizhova became the first woman in history to break the 20 metre barrier in shot put, setting the world record at 20.09m. In 2010, an official bid to organize the World Athletics Championships in Chorzów was submitted, however, the city lost to Beijing in the selection process. Between 9-10 June 2018, the 11th Polish Summer Paralympic Games took place at the Silesian Stadium. On 22 August 2018, the stadium was chosen to host the Kamila Skolimowska Memorial, which attracted 41,200 spectators.\n\nSilesian Stadium has hosted large music concerts in its history by many artists and groups including The Rolling Stones, Metallica, Guns N' Roses, AC/DC, U2, Iron Maiden, Linkin Park, Depeche Mode, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Genesis, The Police, Rammstein, Slipknot, Machine Head.\n\nIn 2009, it was the venue of performances by Monster Jam, and again in 2018.\n\n\n\n"}

They were the lawspeakers of Tiundaland, and all lawspeakers in the Swedish kingdom were their subordinates.\n\nThe one who is the most famous is reported by the \"Heimskringla\" to have lived in the time of Olof Skötkonung and Olaf the Holy, and there is an extensive account on him in this source. This Þorgnýr is held to have historic basis, but Snorri's account is doubted by modern Swedish historians, who lack native Swedish documentation on the Tiundaland lawspeakers of this time.\n\nSnorri relates:\n\nThe two kings were at war, and many wise men in both Sweden and Norway tried to reconcile the kings. In 1018, the earl Ragnvald Ulfsson and the Norwegian king's emissaries Björn Stallare and Halte Skeggesson had arrived at the thing of Uppsala to sway the Swedish king to accept peace and as a warrant marry his daughter Ingegerd Olofsdotter to the king of Norway.\n\nThe Swedish king was greatly angered and threatened to banish Ragnvald from his kingdom, but Ragnvald was supported by his foster-father Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker, who was the wisest and most respected man in Sweden.\n\nThese arguments convinced the king to give in and he promised to have peace with the king of Norway and to give him his daughter. However, he later broke his promise.\n\nIn \"Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa\" about Styrbjörn Starke, appears a Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker who is probably the father of the previously mentioned Þorgnýr. This Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker was very old and almost blind and so he could not take part in the battle between Eric the Victorious and Styrbjörn. Still he influenced the course of battle by having cattle and horses driven against the Danish army. These animals were harnessed with spears and spikes and caused many casualties in Styrbjörn's army. This Þorgnýr is also mentioned in \"Hróa þáttr heimska\" as a wise and just old man.\n\n"}

Sterculiaceae may be separated from Malvaceae \"sensu stricto\" by the smooth surface of the pollen grains and the bilocular anthers.\n\nNumerous phylogenetic studies have revealed that Sterculiaceae, Tiliaceae and Bombacaceae as traditionally defined are cladistically polyphyletic. The APG and APG II systems unite Bombacaceae, Malvaceae \"sensu stricto\", Sterculiaceae and Tiliaceae into a more widely circumscribed Malvaceae, i.e., Malvaceae \"sensu lato\". In that view the taxa formerly classified in Sterculiaceae are treated in the subfamilies Byttnerioideae, Dombeyoideae, Helicteroideae and Sterculioideae of the Malvaceae \"sensu lato\".

He challenged twice for middleweight world championships; the vacant WBA title in 2001; and the undisputed title against Bernard Hopkins in 2005. At regional level, he held the British, Commonwealth and EBU European middleweight titles twice each between 1998 and 2007.\n\nHaving spent some time homeless, Eastman later served in the Gulf War in the Royal Fusiliers. He turned professional in March 1994 with a first-round knockout of John Rice. He garnered a reputation as a heavy puncher in the gyms of the UK, where he regularly sparred with Super Middleweights, such as Chris Eubank. His career progressed slowly and at a low profile for many years as fellow British boxers were reluctant to face him. He accumulated an 18-0 (16 knockouts) record before challenging Steve \"The Viking\" Foster in November 1998 for the British Middleweight title, which he won via 7th-round knockout. In September 2000 he won the Commonwealth Middleweight title by outpointing Australian-based Egyptian (and future #1 contender) Sam Soliman, and finally began receiving wider coverage. \n\nIn April 2001, having put together a 31-0 (28 knockouts) record, he got a high-profile fight defending his British and Commonwealth titles and challenging for the vacant European title against Robert McCracken, who had unsuccessfully challenged Keith Holmes for the WBC world title the previous year.\n\nEastman dominated the fight and dropped McCracken, stopping him in the 10th round.\n\nFollowing this match, U.S. promoter Don King signed him up and in November 2001 he fought two-time champ William Joppy for the vacant WBA world title on a Lennox Lewis undercard in Las Vegas. Eastman narrowly lost a controversial majority decision despite knocking Joppy down in the final seconds of the twelfth round. After this fight Eastman sat out a year in Guyana and let his contract with King expire.\n\nEastman resurfaced in late 2002, under the Hennessy Sports promotional outfit, and trained by former opponent McCracken. Eastman scored two knockouts, over Chardan Ansoula and Hussain Osman, respectively. He regained his European title in January 2003 against the French man Christophe Tendil, whom he stopped in five rounds with a broken jaw, and regained his British and Commonwealth titles by knocking out Scott Dann in three rounds. He defended the European title twice more, stopping ex-world champion Hacine Cherifi in eight rounds in July 2003 and outpointing Sergey Tatevoysan in January 2004.\n\nNow with a 40-1 record and highly ranked by all sanctioning bodies, Eastman finally got the forty-year-old undisputed Middleweight king Bernard Hopkins into the ring to defend his titles, in February 2005 in Los Angeles. Eastman was outsmarted and widely outpointed by Hopkins (110-119, 111-117, 112-116) who was making his historic 20th defence. Post-fight there was initial talk of a rematch, however as the scores suggest the contest for not close enough for this to materialize.\n\nEastman travelled to Germany in July 2005 to fight a WBA eliminator against hard hitting Armenian Arthur Abraham, Eastman lost the fight on points however claimed he had been robbed of the decision. Abraham went on to win the vacant IBF world title after the unified middleweight title was fractured after Hopkins lost to Jermain Taylor.\n\nIn March 2006, Eastman traveled to the U.S. and took on another risky eliminator, this time for the IBF title. He was stopped on his feet by the undefeated Colombian-Puerto Rican Edison Miranda. Eastman protested that he should have been allowed to continue since he had not been down in the fight.\n\nOn 15 December 2006, he regained his British Middleweight title by knocking out Richard Williams in the 12th and final round in London, England. Eastman was well ahead on all scorecards by the time the match ended.\n\nIn April 2007, Eastman added the Commonwealth belt to the British title with a 12-round points decision over the Kenyan Evans Ashira in Dudley. Eastman prevailed 116-113, 116-112, 116-113.\n\nIn September 2007, Eastmans revival was ended. When defending his British title against domestic fighter Wayne Elcock Eastman was surprisingly outworked and outpunched, dropping a shock points defeat by margins of 113-116, 113-115, 114-115. Elcock had previously been knocked out by Eastman-victim Scott Dann. Eastman was offered a final shot at contention, matched with John Duddy in Belfast. After a competitive 10 rounds, Eastman lost a unanimous decision. \n\nEastman has continued his career in his country of birth, Guyana. He beat Denny Dalton to claim the Guyanese middleweight title, before securing victories over former WBA world welterweight champion Andrew Lewis, Leon Gilkes and Kevin Placide. In 2010 he served time in prison for possession of cannabis.\n\nHowever, following the Placide fight, he went on a six-fight losing streak, losing to Kwesi Jones (September 2010, UD4), Kirt Sinnette (July 2011, TKO8, for the vacant WBC CABOFE light-heavyweight title), Edmund DeClou (October 2011, MD12, for the vacant Guyanese middleweight title), two defeats to Simeon Hardy in 2012 (UD10 and MD8) and Sakima Mullings (April 2013, UD12, for the vacant WBC CABOFE welterweight title).\n\nEastman ended this streak in August 2013, when he took a unanimous decision over Mark Austin over 8 rounds. In 2014, he entered the Jamaican version of the Contender series, where he was the second seed behind the aforementioned Mullings, and part of the Caribbean team. In his first fight against the Jamaican team, Eastman stopped Derrick Spencer in two rounds, his quickest win since 2003.\n\n\n!colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#C1D8FF;\"| Regional titles\n"}

There are, however, often several copies of the same texts. Most of the texts are annals from the Assyrian kings Shalmaneser III, Adad-Nirari III, and Tiglath-Pileser III. The texts mention Aram-Damascus (\"Ša-imērišu\", \"Imērišu\", \"Imirishu\") from an Assyrian perspective, but are in many ways informative of the strength of the state, and give us several names of its rulers.\n\nAramaean royal inscriptions are rare, and only one royal stele from Aram-Damascus proper has been identified — the Tel Dan Stele. Other sources in Aramaic that shed light on the history of Aram-Damascus include two \"booty inscriptions\" from Eretria and Samos, and the Zakkur stele of the king Zakkur.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible gives more detailed accounts of Aram-Damascus' history, mainly in its interaction with Israel. For instance, there are texts of the Bible mentioning David's battles against Aramaeans in southern Syria in the 10th century BC. () In contrast, the sources for the early history of Aram-Damascus are almost nonexistent. In an annal dating to Tiglath-Pileser I (1114-1076 BC), we learn that Aramaean people have begun settling in the southern half of Syria.\n\nThe first reliable data can be found in the 9th century BC when Aramaean, Assyrian, and Hebrew texts all mention a state with its capital in Damascus. The state seems to have reached its peak in the late 9th century BC under Hazael, who, according to Assyrian texts, fought against the Assyrians, and according to Aramaean texts, had some influence over the north Syrian state Unqi, and according to Hebrew texts, conquered all of Israel.()\n\nTo the southwest, Aram-Damascus reached over most of Golan to the Sea of Galilee.\n\nIn the 8th century BC, Rezin had been a tributary of Tiglath-Pileser III, the king of Assyria. In c. 732 BC, he allied himself with Pekah, the king of Israel, to attack Ahaz, the king of Judah. However, Ahaz appealed to Tiglath-Pileser III for help. This the Assyrian king obliged, after Judah paid tribute to the Assyrian king. () As a result, Tiglath-Pileser III sacked Damascus and annexed Aram. According to , the population was deported and Rezin executed. Tiglath-Pileser also records this act in one of his inscriptions.\n\nArchaeological evidence of Aram-Damascus is close to nothing. Excavations in Damascus are hard to perform, owing to the continuous settlement of the city. Other cities of Aram-Damascus have not been positively identified from textual sources, and excavations of Iron Age sites around Damascus are almost nonexistent. The material culture at sites farther south (e.g. Tell-Ashtara, Tell er-Rumeith, et-Tell, Tel-Dan, Tell el-Oreme ('Oreimeh), to name but a few) do not show many features distinguishing from the material culture of ancient northern Israel.\n\n\n"}

It was destroyed by a fire on October 2, 1939.\n\nOriginally named the El Patio Ballroom and located on the east side of Vermont Avenue between 2nd and 3rd Street, it boasted being “the largest and most famous dance hall on the West Coast.”\n\nThe building featured a large mezzanine, a balcony, and a seventy-five hundred square foot patio. The dance floor could accommodate four thousand couples. Admission was 40 cents for gentlemen and 25 cents for ladies. Opening night was attended by 20,000 people, including many of Hollywood's silent screen stars. Klieg lights illuminated minaret structures on the roof.\n\nThe dance hall was renamed Rainbow Gardens by real estate developer Raymond Lewis, who purchased the property, added an indoor miniature golf course and changed the name to the Palomar Ballroom. It soon became a prime venue for the well-known bands that were rapidly gaining popularity. On August 21, 1935, Benny Goodman began his first Palomar engagement that marked the start of the swing era.\n\nThe ballroom hosted popular bands including those led by Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, Glen Gray, Jimmy Dorsey, and Kay Kyser, among others. Nightly radio broadcasts on local station KFLJ attracted large crowds to the “Dining, Dancing and Entertainment Center of the West.” An aircheck from a Charlie Barnet broadcast is included in the LP “Radio Rhythm” (IAJRC 14). The famed structure was the backdrop for several major Hollywood films that included \"The Big Broadcast of 1937\", made during Benny Goodman's return engagement, and \"Dancing Coed\", which starred Lana Turner and Artie Shaw's band.\n\nBy 1939, the Palomar had been remodeled. A modern cooling system was installed, cocktail lounges and soda fountains were added and the dance floor was enlarged. The exotic Moorish decor was not changed. An advertisement announcing the gala reopening predicted “A premier audience of more than 20,000 persons – the expected attendance to be on hand for the gayest of all openings!”\n\nAdmission charges were 75 cents for gentlemen and 40 cents for ladies. On Sunday nights, a special dinner-dance ticket cost $1.25. It included a reserved table in the posh palm-lined Palomar Terrace for the entire evening, a seven-course dinner, a floor show and dancing until 2:00 AM. Valet parking was fifteen cents extra.\n\nThe management of the Palomar followed a strict color policy, as well.\n\nThe Palomar burned to the ground on October 2, 1939. The response of LAFD was delayed by an address error. The Charlie Barnet Orchestra lost most of its equipment in the fire. Their tune \"All Burned Up\" was a gallows humor reference to the event.\n"}

Bowden, Baron Bowden\n\nBertram Vivian Bowden, Baron Bowden (; 18 January 1910 – 28 July 1989) was an English scientist and educationist, particularly associated with the development of UMIST as a successful university.\n\nBorn, Chesterfield, Derbyshire, he attended Hasland Junior School as a child and graduated in natural sciences from Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1931), taking his Ph.D. in nuclear physics. From 1934-1935 he was sponsored by ICI to undertake research at the University of Amsterdam.\n\nAfter a period in teaching, in 1940 he was conscripted to the Telecommunications Research Establishment to work on radar, including an improved system to distinguish between friend and foe. From 1943, he continued his work at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, establishing himself as an able and effective administrator. From the end of World War II to 1953 he held a series of jobs, including selling early computers manufactured by Ferranti. His prescient forecasts of the impact that the technology would have on daily life were published in his 1953 book \"Faster than Thought\".\n\nIn 1953, Bowden became principal of the Manchester College of Science and Technology, a vocational education college in Manchester. The post-war expansion in university education in Britain, coupled with Bowden's energy, creativity and lobbying soon entailed the college's transformation into UMIST (University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology.)\n\nOn 18 January 1964, he was created a life peer as Baron Bowden, \"of Chesterfield in the County of Derby\" and later in this year, Harold Wilson appointed him Minister for Education and Science. However, Westminster and the labyrinths of the civil service were ill-matched to Bowden's direct approach and, in 1965 he returned to UMIST. He retired in 1976.\n\nBowden was married four times and had three children. He died in Bowdon, Cheshire.\n\nBowden was interested in Islamic finance and economics, enough to suggest an Institute for the History of Islamic Science and Commerce, though this never materialised. His interest in the subject continued and he once mentioned the subject at length in the House of Lords. His interest in the subject was spurred by his colleague Salim Al-Hassani.\n\n\n"}

After beginning his acting career on the stage in 1937, he played Charles Kingsford Smith in the film \"Smithy\" (1946). He also had roles in \"Bulldog Drummond at Bay\" (1947), \"Kiss Me Kate\" (1953), \"I Am a Camera\" (1955), \"Most Dangerous Man Alive\" (1961) and \"King of Kings\" (1961).\n\nRandell was the son of Ernest Randell (d. 26 May 1946) and Louisa Egan, who had married in 1912. Randell's great-great-grandfather was one of the main developers of the South Australia colony from 1836. His grandfather ran camel trains across the Nullabor Plain to Coolgardie. Randell's father was born in Broken Hill and did a variety of jobs.\n\nRandell was born in Sydney and was the eldest of three sons, the others being Reg and Norm. He attended Marist Brothers in North Sydney. \n\nHe left school at the age of 14, and went to work as an office boy in a Sydney finance office.\n\nAged fourteen, Randell participated in a few sketches at a social acting club and did an unpaid job for radio station 2UE. He made his first professional appearance for the ABC at 14 for the Children's Sessions. He soon started acting regularly on children's serials. After eight months, Randell quit his office job to concentrate on acting.\n\nHe soon established himself as a leading male juvenile for radio, acting for 2KY Players, George Edwards, BAP and on Lux Playhouse. He also worked as a compère for variety shows, in particular with Jack Davey and did a two man revue with Lloyd Lamble. He worked in both Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nRandell made his legitimate stage debut aged 19, in a production of \"Quiet Wedding\" at the Minerva Theatre in Sydney. Randell later said, \"I moved out of radio and back into theatre because I was becoming a left-hand actor. I would hold the script in my right hand and do all my acting with my left hand.\" He said at the time \"He finds the footlights a pleasant change after the mike, but we’re not to lose him in radio.\" \n\nThe majority of his stage work was done at the Minerva Theatre, including performances in \"Of Mice and Men\". Randell says police were ready to arrest the cast of \"Of Mice and Men\" because the play featured the word \"whorehouse\". \"Fortunately we received a standing ovation and the police decided in the circumstances not to make any arrests.\" As late as 1974 Randell would say this was his favourite performance.\n\nIn December 1941, Randell went into the Australian Army. During his service, he was cast in some Australian wartime propaganda short films such as \"100,000 Cobbers\" (1943) and \"South West Pacific\" (1943). \n\nHe was discharged on medical grounds in 1943. \n\n\"They threw me out of the army... because I had tuberculosis, warning me I wouldn't live to be an old man\", said Randell. One report said he was suffering sinus trouble, was having trouble remembering his lines in shows and was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. He decided to seek treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Los Angeles, and travelled to the USA in 1943.\n\nRandell decided to go through Hollywood. He tested for the role of Stanley in \"Lifeboat\" (1944) for Alfred Hitchcock, but was unsuccessful - he did the test with an American accent saying he was unaware they were looking for a cockney. Through Cecil Kellaway he got a screen test at Paramount but this was unsuccessful.\n\nHe went to San Francisco and got a role in a stage play with Nancy Carroll. He appeared on radio with Robert Young in \"Transport for Adams\".\n\nWhen that ended he moved to New York and tried to get stage work there, but had little luck. He did another unsuccessful screen test, for 20th Century Fox. \n\nHe returned to Sydney and resumed his theatre and radio career. Around this time he changed his professional name from \"Ron Randall\" to \"Ron Randell\" to avoid confusion with actor George Randall.\n\nIn October 1944, Randell made his feature film debut in \"A Son Is Born\", opposite Peter Finch and Muriel Steinbeck.\n\nHis big break came in November 1944, when he was spotted by producer Nick Perry at the Minerva Theatre performing in \"While the Sun Shines\" with Finch. This led to Randell being cast as the lead in \"Smithy\", a biographical film about the pioneering Australian aviator Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, who made the first flight across the Pacific (from the United States to Australia) in 1928. His casting was announced in May 1945. Producer Perry sid, \": \"Randell has been selected not only for his achievements as a fine actor, but as the type of virile Australian who embodies the spirit and qualities so typified by 'Smithy.' We have taken a long time over our selection, but we are extremely happy with our choice.\"\n\nThe release of \"A Son is Born\" was held off until after \"Smithy\" had come out, to take advantage of its publicity. \"Smithy\" was a big hit at the Australian box office, and Randall was widely acclaimed as a local star. A Ron Randell Film Club was established and Randell would be mobbed at personal appearances.\n\n\"Smithy\" had been made with funds from Columbia Pictures, who offered Randell a long-term contract and he moved to Hollywood in October 1946.\n\nProducers Lou Appleton and Bud Small had a deal with Columbia to make a new series of pictures about Bulldog Drummond. According to Appleton, \"We wanted a new film face and someone wi'h a British way of speaking.\" They were impressed with his \"Smithy\" footage and put him in \"Bulldog Drummond at Bay\". (It was made for an independent company, Venture, but released through Columbia.)\n\nColumbia were impressed enough by this to cast Randell in a good support role in an expensive \"A\" production, \"It Had to Be You\" (1947). He was called back for another go as Drummond in \"Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back\", which filmed at the same time as \"The Mating of Millie\" (1948).\n\nThis was followed by \"The Sign of the Ram\" (1948) and the $2 million spectacular \"The Loves of Carmen\" (1948), where Randell was billed after Columbia's two biggest stars, Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford. \n\nHe also wrote a short book for publication in Australia, \"Ron Randell in Hollywood\" which he dedicated \"to the many Australian boys and \ngirls who have given me loyalty and support, and to express the hope that they may enjoy , some of my Hollywood experiences with me.” One review said \"as an account of those experiences, ending with some pious aspirations concerning the talkies as an instrument for world peace, it’s not too bad. Over to you, boys and girls. \" \n\nHe was being sought after to appear in a Broadway play \"The Rats of Norway\".\n\n\"I'm grateful for playing opposite people like Ginger Rogers and Cornel Wilde\", said Randell. \"They really know their business. You can't imagine what it means to get away from those 'Bulldog Drummond' detective roles I was afraid I'd be type-cast and never play anything else.\"\n\nRandell had been meant to make four \"Drummond\" films but only appeared in two. In July 1948, Columbia announced Randell would play another detective hero, in \"The Lone Wolf and His Lady\" (1949), hoping it would lead to more but there was no follow-up.\n\nThe studio put him in a support role in a \"Make Believe Ballroom\" (1949). \"This will be the final major assignment I understand\", wrote the \"Los Angeles Times\". \"Filmink\" magazine later noted this was when Columbia seemed to lose interest in Randell.\nThe studio started promoting other young leading men – John Derek, Aldo Ray. Randell was left behind. What the hell happened? What had gone wrong? It seems Columbia fell out of love with Randell. Maybe he was difficult on set. Maybe responses to his performances were not what they hoped – this might have been at an executive level, but it could have been with the public. None of his movies had been big hits. Whatever happened, the tide had turned. Randell was no longer the Next Big Thing.\nIn October, Randell married for the first time.\n\nIn November 1948, he was told he needed to leave the country under the terms of his visa. By January 1949, it was announced his Columbia contract had lapsed. He was mentioned as a possible star for a production of \"Robbery Under Arms\" by Michael Balcon that was not made.\n\nIn April, he appeared in a production of \"Kraft Television Theatre\", \"Wicked Is the Vine\", based on a play by Australian Sumner Locke Elliott. He was in \"The Shark God\" (1949).\n\nIn July 1949 he appeared on stage in Los Angeles in a production of \"Major Barbara\" and said he did not want to make any more \"B\"s. \"I know I've surprised quite a few Hollywood people, because they have never seen me working in something really good\", he said. \"In \"Major Barbara\" I have a chance to be charming and intelligent, a chance I was never given while working in pictures.\"\nRandell admitted that his determination to refuse offers in \"B\" pictures might be \"tough on me financially\", but he would prefer fewer but better film offers to large numbers of grade \"B\" roles. I wasn't happy working in those pictures, anyway.\"\n\nHe looked to Broadway and discussed appearing in \"The Devil's Carnival\". Instead he returned to Columbia to appear in a swashbuckler for Sam Katzman, \"Tyrant of the Sea\" (1950).\n\nHe filmed this at the same time he was cast in a double-bill Terence Rattigan plays, \"The Browning Version\" and \"Harlequinade\", supporting Maurice Evans and directed by Peter Glenville. (Glenville cast Randell on the basis of his performance in \"Major Barbara\".) Brooks Atkinson of the \"New York Times\" said Randell was \"particularly good\" in his \"curious part\". The production did not have a long run and closed in December.\n\nHe was announced for a film \"The Killer that Stalked Broadway\" with Maurice Evans but it was never made.\n\nRandell was meant to follow \"Browning Version\" with \"The Enchanted\" by his employment was over-ruled by Actors Equity who said that as a foreigner he should have to wait six months before appearing in another play.\n\n\"They have made a martyr of me\", said Randell. \"It is a horrible thing and a backward step for the United States, which always has been a forward country as far as Equity is concerned. It is the first time I knew any American organisation did not welcome competition. This new part was going to be the big break for me. It would have meant a very great deal to my career. Now I am forced to go without a job for six months, and I can't afford that.\"\n\nHe spent some time in London and considered moving there. Instead he returned to Hollywood to appear in \"Lorna Doone\" (1951), although it was a support role – the star was Richard Greene.\n\nHe was to have appeared in a stage production of \"The Corn Is Green\" but pulled out when Columbia used him again for \"Counterspy Meets Scotland Yard\".\n\nHe appeared in a play, \"The Amazing Adele\" with Ruth Gordon, which was being tried out in Westport. However, he left the production to appear in another, \"Angel in the Pawnshop\". He was cast in a play by Frederick Lonsdale, \"The Day After Tomorrow\". However, before the play went to New York, a production was seen by Sir Cedric Hardwicke whose wife was in the show; it resulted in Randell being replaced by Jack Watling.\n\nRandell returned to movies with \"China Corsair\" (1951) at Columbia supporting Jon Hall. He followed it with \"Captive Women\" (1952) and \"The Brigand\" (1952). These were all B-pictures.\n\nIn September, he went into rehearsals for a production of \"Candida\" with Olivia de Havilland. This toured America from October for the next few months, and eventually reached New York. \"I don't have any desire to go back to movies\", he said. \"A good, adult picture, yes. But I don't care if I never do another like the kind I worked in for Columbia Pictures.\" \"Candida\" only had a short run on Broadway. This commitment meant he could not be in \"The Golden Carriage\", from Jean Renoir, and \"Invasion U.S.A\". Brooks Atkinson, reviewing Randell's performance in \"Candida\", said he was \"intelligent and manly but... leaves out the pompousness essential to the part and the play\".\n\nIn August 1952, Randell's name was mentioned in connection with two films to be made about Australia with Paulette Goddard, \"The Queen's Mask\" and \"Melba\". He tried to raise funds for a film about Don Bradman. Of these only Melba was made, without Randell.\n\nRandell was in an A picture: \"The Mississippi Gambler\" (1953). He also worked extensively in television.\n\nBy now Randell was frustrated at the progress of his career. According to one report, \"Typed as\"the dull Englishman who invariably lost the heroine to the hero, Randell was in a rut. Feeling he was destined to play an Englishman for ever, Randell decided to go to England, where his chances of getting the girl-and the fans might improve.\"\n\nHe turned down a support part in \"The Red Beret\" and instead supported Michael Denison and Dulcie Grey in a play, \"Sweet Peril\". He took time out from rehearsals to appear in a TV series shot in Germany, \"Orient Express\", starring in the TV special \"The Blue Camelia\". While playing in \"Sweet Peril\" he also made the film \"The Girl on the Pier\" (1953) and appeared in \"American Duel\" on TV for Douglas Fairbanks Jnr. He was interested in producing a play in New York: \"Pommy\" by William Lipscomb.\n\nAfter five months, Randell returned to Hollywood to play Cole Porter in MGM's \"Kiss Me, Kate\" (1953). While there he appeared on TV in \"Where Lovely Women\" with Arlene Dahl.\n\nHe came to London to appear in a West End production, \"The Fifth Season\". It did not have a long run. Randell appeared in \"Theatre Royal\" on the BBC then became an \"overnight success\" when he took over as the summer replacement for the host of the British TV series \"What's My Line?\" in May 1954. He blew a kiss to a viewer on air, causing controversy. It led to a series of offers, including a role in a national tour of \"Sabrina Fair\" and a role in \"I Am a Camera\" (1955). He was to have been in \"The Girl Friends\" directed by Michelangelo Antonioni. but did not appear in the final film.\n\nFrom October 1954 to December 1955, Randell hosted the ABC anthology series \"The Vise\". In the US he made a pilot to a TV show with Pat Crowley, \"My Man, Sing\" and a film \"Desert Sands\" (1956).\n\nIn March 1955, Randell returned to Australia to appear in a stage production of \"The Caine Mutiny Court Martial\". There was an incident when he and fellow members of the play's cast – including Americans Jeffrey Lynn and Lee Tracy – were locked in a hotel room for not paying their bill. The play was not a financial success and only played in Sydney.\nRandell returned to Hollywood to make \"Frontier Scout\" (1956), then went to Bermuda for \"Bermuda Affair\" (1956).\n\nIn October 1955 he got a job in London compering TV show \"On the Town\", replacing Jack Jackson. He had to take a leave of absence to make \"Beyond Mombassa\" (1956) in Africa. He had a support role in \"The Story of Esther Costello\" (1957) shot in London.\n\nIn May 1956 he returned to Hollywood after a six month absence and appeared in \"The She-Creature\" (1956). In September 1956 Randell told the press, \"With this present phase of making films all over the world, an actor has to be ready to pack up and keep moving. In one year I have worked in these places, in this order: Hollywood. London, Hollywood, Bermuda, London, and Kenya. It seems I only get home long enough to let the ice freeze in the refrigerator.\"\n\nIn London he made \"The Hostage\" (1956) for Douglas Fairbanks Jnr and the film \"Davy\" (1958).\n\nHe got a job playing an American in the TV series, \"O.S.S.\" (1957–58). He was going to make \"Lost Mission\" with his wife and James and John Woolfe but it appears to have been never made. Neither was \"The Mystic Confederacy\" which Randell optioned for his own production company.\n\n\"I belong to no one country I guess\" said Randell around this time. \"Australia must have checked me out some time ago. I'm neither an American citizen nor an English one.\"\n\nWhile shooting \"OSS\", Randell heard Joshua Logan was doing a Broadway adaptation of \"The World of Suzie Wong\". Randell's then-wife was Eurasian so they went to Hollywood to meet Logan, hoping she would be cast in the title role. Randell ended up being cast in the third lead, only on stage for ten minutes, with Randell paid $1,000 a week. The play was a big hit.\n\nHe had an excellent part in \"King of Kings\" (1961), shot in Spain. He acquired the rights to a novel, \"Defender's Triumph\", and intended to film it as \"7 Soho Squared\" but the film was never made. Randell did play the lead in \"The Most Dangerous Man Alive\" (1960) and made a film in Germany, \"It's a Great Life\" (1961). He was going to produce and star in a war survival film. \"Chain of Fear\", directed by Leonardo Bercovici but did not appear in it.\n\nRandell returned to Australia briefly to promote \"King of Kings\" in late 1961. He said he wanted to make a film in Woolloomooloo based on the Camden Town Murder with Ralph Richardson, but was not made.\n\nHe was also in \"The Longest Day\" (1962), as an American war correspondent, \"Follow the Boys\" (1963) and \"Gold for the Caesars\" (1963). He and his wife wanted to star in and produce an adaptation of \"Year of the Cricket\" by John Lorring. He did co-produce \"The Gallant One\" (1964), shot in Peru and starring his wife.\n\nHe guest starred on \"The Outer Limits\".\nIn 1964, he appeared as Hubert Ambrose in the \"Perry Mason\" episode \"The Case of the Illicit Illusion\". \n\nHe guest-starred twice in \"Bewitched\" in 1964 and 1967, and played a lead role in the two-part \"The Contenders\" episode in the series \"\" in 1968. During this time, Randell played in several European films such as \"Savage Pampas\" (1966).\n\nHe returned to Australia in 1967 to appear in \"There's a Girl in My Soup\" which was very popular. \"\"As an international actor I have no home\", said Randell. \"My luggage is spread across nine hotels in Europe and America and so are my friends.\n\nRandell remembered doing multiple voices in radio in his old Sydney days, but said \"I just couldn't do that sort of thing today if I tried\", adding that \"I hate radio.\" He also said Australia should make more local shows.\n\nRandell returned to Australia in 1969 to explore the possibilities of producing a play there, \"Houseboat in Kashmir\", by the team of Jerome and Lee. He was also looking into organising luxury golf tours. He was commuting between the US and London and had recently bought in apartment in London. While in Australia he guest-starred in episodes of local TV series like \"The Rovers\", and discussed projects with Reg Goldsworthy.\n\nRandell returned to Australia again in 1971 to direct and star in a stage play, \"Come Live with Me\", at the Phillip Street Theatre in Sydney. He had never directed before. He said he intended to co produce a film in Australia called \"Northward the Coast\" but it was never made.\n\nHe returned to Australia in 1974, to appear in a six-week run of a play, \"Champagne Complex\", at Wrest Point Casino in Hobart. He said he was trying to produce a TV series based on the book \"Colour of the East\" by John Russell. However, it was not made. Randell told the press that he was not getting a lot of television work in the USA. \"My face is like the Gable sort of face and when he was in fashion so was I. That's the way it works in Hollywood; for years your face is in fashion, then suddenly the Robert Redford face is in or the Al Pacino face... If you're not on TV every night, people think you're dead.\" He added later that year, \"for most of my life I've played phonies... There is no place for an Australian... I think I'm a kamikaze actor at the moment - I think I've arrived at that. It is death or glory for me... I range the world but I'm not a superstar. The insecurity of acting never really bothers me that much. I find now that life is so exciting... The glamorous moments have been very rate. I've been working for more than 30 years and survived... and it's survival that counts.\"\n\nIn 1975, Randell appeared on Broadway in a production of \"Sherlock Holmes\". The following year he was in \"Mrs Warren's Profession\"; the \"New York Times\" theatre critic said he \"does very decently\". He also appeared in \"Measure for Measure\".\n\nDuring his later career, Randell worked steadily on Broadway, though rarely in leading roles. His notable appearances included \"Bent\".\n\nRandell was married three times. He married his first wife, stage actress Elaine Diana Maltzman, in New Canaan, Connecticut, in October 1948. They divorced in 1949.\n\nHe was engaged to actress Amanda Blake, and they planned to marry in 1951 but there seems no evidence they went through with their plans.\n\nHe was engaged to Marie Keith in September 1952, and they married in October that year. However, they separated in 1953, at which time he was seen with Amanda Blake, who was described as his \"former fiancee\".\n\nMarie Keith and Randell were divorced in 1955.\n\nHe had a romance with Hildegarde Christian then married Laya Raki in 1956, and they remained together until his death in Los Angeles in 2005 following a stroke. He was 86.\n\n\n\n"}

It was developed and produced by World Leaders Entertainment in New York City, USA, and Granada Kids UK. It was animated by Fatkat Animation, a Canadian animation studio. It made its television début on 1 September 2007 on CITV, but the official premiere was on 8 September of the same year.\n\nIn the ordinary city of Crumptonville can be found a school for superheroes!\nSure, the students wear Spandex and study Death Traps and Doomsday Machines, but they still have all the problems normal kids have at normal schools. There are super-achievers and super-slackers, super-nerds and super-jocks… there's even a teacher's pet - but it lives in the basement, and eats cats!\nSuperNormal follows the adventures of four of the, er, less promising students at the school.\nThere’s Changerella - a peace-loving shape-shifter who thinks the world would be happier with more flowers, love and pink stuff.\nThe Brass Butt (BB to his friends) - he's not too bright, but is super strong and uses his mighty and shiny brass butt to fight the forces of evil!\nBuzz Girl - a sarcastic four-armed girl who possesses a multitude of powers from the insect world... and a weakness for porch lights!\nAnd Eric Normal. An ordinary boy with no superpowers whatsoever. Yet through a combination of sheer good luck and a little dash of common sense, he was able to get through the school’s combination obstacle course/entrance exam.\nIt's here that brave, enthusiastic and earnest Eric Normal and his friends will learn what it really means to be heroes, with or without superpowers!\n\nEric Normal, the world's first superhero without superpowers!\n\nEric Normal may wear a Spandex suit and a home made cape, but the only thing super about him is his total normalcy.\nFiesty and determined, Eric is living every kid's dream: he gets to dress up in a colourful costume and punch things, but he takes his role as a superhero-in-training very seriously. He's filled with enthusiasm, a keen sense of justice and is itching to give evil a swift kick in the butt. Eric knows that he doesn't have any superpowers, but that won't stop him from getting stuck in!\nHe fancies himself as a master planner, but his plans are rarely thought out. But whether it's luck or coincidence, Eric Normal will always stand victorious.\nWhen the fate of the world teeters on the brink of oblivion, a 13-year old kid with the power of being super normal may not be the first person you think of ringing, but Eric always has his hand on the phone, ready to answer the call of justice! He is voiced by Michael Sinterniklaas.\n\nStrong and loyal! The Brass Butt is Eric Normal's best friend and constant companion. BB (as he's known to his friends) comes from a long line of Brass Butts. His father was a Brass Butt. His father's father was a Brass Butt. His father's father's father was a just a tin butt, but that guy's dad was a Brass Butt too! He is voiced by Gary Littman.\n\nChangerella is an incredibly optimistic and peaceful and loving person, with the power of shape-shifting. Similar to BB she has very low intelligence such as being forgetful or not paying any attention. The most empathetic of the group, she is caring and very protective of the rest. She usually claps and cheers at Eric's ideas even when she knows it's obvious they won't work. She wears purple and pink clothes, decorated with flowers. She is voiced by Sarah Hadland. \n\nBuzz Girl has all the powers of an insect, that is, she can climb walls, fly and stretch her tongue. She can also spin webs, a trait that belongs to arachnids, not insects. She speaks with sarcastic comments and snide remarks, but means well. Buzz Girl rarely smiles in most of the episodes and frowns or sulks more often. She has four arms and wings, and wears a black and purple bathing suit. She is voiced by Tara Sands. \n\nOn a poll run by CITV, only 2% of children voted it their favourite television programme on the channel, tied sixth with Pocoyo. First in the poll was Horrid Henry, followed by Bratz, My Parents Are Aliens, Jungle Run and Emu. Tied for last place with 1% were Skyland and Jim Jam and Sunny.\n"}

Braddock, dubbed \"The Cinderella Man,\" who in 1935 upset Max Baer to become the World Heavyweight Champion. He also managed Lightweight contender Ray Miller from 1930–1933.\n\nGould met then 20-year-old amateur boxer James Braddock at Joe Jeanette's gym in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1925. With Gould as his manager, Braddock turned pro in 1926 and went 14-0-2 before losing his first fight. After a completely one-sided loss to defending Light Heavyweight champion Tommy Loughran in July 1929, Braddock's career fell into decline as he lost more than won. By 1933, unable to support his family as a boxer, Braddock worked as a longshoreman and went on public assistance.\n\nGould was instrumental in forging a phenomenal comeback for Braddock in June 1934 when Primo Carnera was scheduled to defend his Heavyweight title against Max Baer. The promoters needed an opponent for up and coming John “Corn” Griffin on the undercard. Gould pleaded for Braddock to be inserted as Griffin's opponent stating that Braddock needed money just to put food on the table for his children. They agreed to pay him $250 for a 6-rounder against Griffin which Braddock won in 3 rounds. Five months later Braddock decisively won a rematch against John Henry Lewis in 10 rounds followed by an easy 15-round decision against Art Lasky.\n\nBraddock was then slated to face Max Baer, the reigning Heavyweight Champion of the world. On June 13, 1935 at Madison Square Garden, the 10-to-1 underdog Braddock won the World Heavyweight Championship in one of the most stunning upsets in boxing history. On June 27, 1937, Braddock lost the title to Heavyweight contender Joe Louis. Seven months later, in the final fight of his career, he defeated Tommy Farr in Madison Square Garden.\n\nGould enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942, and became a First Lieutenant. He was dismissed from the Army and sentenced to three years hard labor after a court-martial in 1944 for conspiracy to accept bribes.\n\nGould died from leukemia on April 21, 1950.\n\nIn the 2005 film \"Cinderella Man\", Gould is portrayed by actor Paul Giamatti. The role earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n"}

{"id": "2064923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064923", "title": "Barry Island railway station", "text": "Barry Island railway station\n\nBarry Island railway station is a railway station, 9¼ miles (15 km) south-west of Cardiff Central, serving Barry Island () in South Wales. The station has been the terminus – and only remaining active station at the end of the Barry branch of the Cardiff Central to Barry Island line since the closure of Barry Pier station in 1976, the last passenger working through Barry Island tunnel to the Pier station, being an enthusiasts' special in 1973. Previous to that year, only a few revenue-earning workings to meet up with the former P&A Campbell's paddle-steamer trips to Weston-super-Mare or other Somerset/Devon havens, were made following May 1964.\n\nPassenger services, operated by Transport for Wales as part of the Valley Lines network, currently use the first half of platform 1.\n\nIn 1896 the railway line was extended along the newly-built raised road causeway from Barry Station onto the island to provide a service to the newly-opened and developing Barry Island Pleasure Park day tripper leisure facilities. The Barry Island station opened in time for the August Bank holiday 1896. The new rail line also crossed to the Island at road level and consequently a level crossing was needed where the line crossed Plymouth Road. When premises on Station Approach Road (formerly Roman Well Road) were being renovated in the late 1990s, traces of the original track were discovered in the basement.\n\nTo give improved passenger access to the P & A Campbell's White Funnel steamers that plied the Bristol Channel in 1899, the line was continued past Barry Island station through a 280-yard double-line tunnel to the new Barry Pier railway station.\n\nThe peak years for passenger numbers at Barry Island were in the 1920s and 1930s. From 1924 on most peak-time August Bank Holiday Mondays between 80,000 and 100,000 visitors arrived at the Island and mostly by train.\n\nAfter the 1926 General Strike, reports in the local and national press described the scenes over the 1927 August Bank Holiday weekend at Barry Island as \" 'organised chaos' \". It was estimated that in excess of 120,000 arrived at the island with packed trains arriving and leaving Barry Island Station at five-minute intervals. In excess of 75 special excursion trains, each carrying an estimated 500-600 passengers arrived from Cardiff's Riverside Station during that morning and early afternoon.\n\nA report in the local press on one Bank Holiday Monday, when an estimated crowd of over 150,000 arrived at the Island, described the scene as follows -\n\"\"When it was time for visitors to leave the Island a queue started to form just before 6 pm and by 9.30 pm was still over a quarter of a mile long, it snaked around the fairground with people waiting to board their trains. Excursionists from the Midlands and places other than Cardiff and the Valleys using one entrance and boarding their non-stop return trains and \"Locals\" having to wait for a space to return to Cardiff.\"\"\n\nIn 1927 the GWR decided to issue special day return tickets from Cardiff General (Riverside) at one shilling each (5 new pence) and sold over 82,000 tickets. Demand during the morning was so great that temporary ticket booths had to be set up at the Riverside concourse to cope with the high level of sales. Additional trains and rolling stock were quickly laid on, over and above the planned timetable, to transport the additional visitors to Barry Island. By 12 noon, the station ticket office totally ran out of tickets and were forced to use hand amended tickets that had been dated for the following day.\n\nTraffic levels started to fall in the 1950s and 1960s with the spread of greater car ownership in the UK, especially after the Severn Bridge opened in 1966. A further sudden drop occurred between 1968 and 1970 with the closure of the former Taff Vale Railway branch line between Penarth and Cadoxton, Biglis Junction in 1968, the former of which had served through traffic to Cadoxton from Cardiff via Penarth. In its final period of passenger use, the line south of Penarth was operated using a single car DMU from Penarth to Cadoxton only. The through route at Penarth station had been permanently blocked by buffer stops between the Cardiff end of the station and Cadoxton end whence the line at Biglis junction merged with the direct Cardiff via Dinas Powys main line to Barry Island. The wholesale closure of rural rail links all over the country accelerated the switch to private car use by holidaymakers.\n\nIn its heyday (prior to the early 1960s), the station had four operational platforms - one long main platform on the 'up' side divided into 2 sections (numbered 1 & 2, with 2 served by a dead end spur off the through line to ) and an island platform on the 'down' side (numbered 3 & 4). There were also several carriage sidings at the east end of the station opposite platform 2, with a signal box at each end of the station to control the layout. The 'East' ’box was closed in 1964 and replaced by two groundframes, \"A\" and \"B\", \"A\" being housed in a ground-level cabin, and bearing single-line token apparatus for any workings over the single tunnel line to Barry Pier but with the former 'West' ’box taking over responsibility for the passenger service to & from the station. The branch from was built as double track, but was singled in 1969. The line between Barry Island station and Barry Pier through the tunnel had been singled to the tunnel's half-way point in 1929 at which point it doubled and then quadrupled into the station platform area at the Pier terminus.\n\nThe remaining signal box at the station was damaged by fire in 1976 and was out of service for repairs for more than a year - this coincided with the final closure of the Pier branch and the abolition of platform 2, leaving only 3 platforms in use. The two faces of the island platform were thereafter (especially from 1982 onward - when the carriage sidings and Pier branch were finally lifted) only used during the summer for excursion traffic, with the ’box normally \"switched out\" and all trains using platform 1. This method of operation continued right up until the ’box was permanently abolished in March 1998, though main line connections to the tracks serving platforms 3 & 4 had been disconnected for some years by this time. Following the closure of the ’box, half of the redundant track through platform 3 was lifted, platform 4 track abandoned and platform 1 track was curtailed at a buffer stop halfway along the platform. Platform 4 track was absorbed into the Barry Tourist Railway's infrastructure and east of the footbridge, all former BR permanent way was eventually removed but with extended track from platform 4 to the BTR Plymouth Rd shed, platform, headshunt and run-around loop for the Tourist Railway's use.\nThe remaining bi-directional single line to and from Barry was henceforth operated using ‘One Train Working’ regulations from Barry Station signal box (since abolished - the branch is now controlled from Wales Railway Operations Centre (WROC) at Canton, Cardiff, whilst the defunct island platform had its footbridge steps to platforms 3 & 4 removed. Platform 4 was subsequently handed over to the Vale of Glamorgan heritage project (see below). In 2012, the station footbridge giving right of way to the public was replaced by a state-of-the-art structure with disabled access facilities but which offers no access to any of the platforms.\n\nThe Heritage Vale of Glamorgan Railway Company moved their operations to Barry Island station in 1997 from Cardiff Butetown railway station when the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation indicated that they had no use for a heritage steam railway in their plans. The heritage railway started operating heritage trains from Barry Island's platform 4, running across the causeway alongside the Network Rail line, before continuing on to a purpose-built single track incline to the new Waterfront terminus at Hood Road at No.1 dock quay level. By 2007, the Company had extended their line from a junction on the Barry end of the Causeway to a new halt at Gladstone Bridge alongside Morrisons supermarket, the final intention being to further extend ½ mile to a new terminus alongside the Network Rail Barry Docks station, making their end-to-end main track length two miles.\n\nFollowing financial cutbacks brought about by the global credit crunch, the Vale of Glamorgan Council withdrew annual grant support for the heritage railway and placed the facilities up for tender. The heritage railway subsequently failed to secure the new lease and were forced to withdraw from Barry Island station in December 2008.\n\nPrivate transport operator Cambrian Transport subsequently took over the lease in December 2009 and they now run the heritage line as the Barry Tourist Railway which as at January 2018, terminates at Gladstone Bridge halt.\n\nOn Mondays to Saturdays, during daytime hours, three trains per hour leave for Cardiff Central; their final destinations being Aberdare and Merthyr Tydfil via . The frequency drops to half-hourly in the evening and some late night trains terminate at Cardiff Central.\n\nOn Sundays, the service to Cardiff runs approximately half-hourly all day and serves in addition to Merthyr and Aberdare. The train journey from Cardiff Queen St to Barry Island Station typically takes 36 minutes.\n\n\n"}
