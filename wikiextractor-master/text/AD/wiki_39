Vedek Bareil is the last to arrive; he invites Kira to visit his monastery on Bajor.

She has a vision that includes her and Bareil as lovers, which she conceals from him.

Bajoran politician Jaro Essa reveals to Kira that he is the true force behind the Circle. He solicits her help, but while she has no love for the provisional government, she tells Jaro that votes, not weapons, are the way to change a government.

He was born in Prague (now capital of the Czech Republic) and was thus a citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He lived in Vienna until the Nazi \"Anschluss\" in 1938, when he emigrated to Palestine.\n\nAccording to the biographical note on the Arcade Publishing editions of the English translations of his novels, Leo was a mathematician who formulated an algebraic equation which is named after him; he worked as a statistician for an insurance company. He was related to the biologist Max Perutz.\n\nDuring the 1950s he returned occasionally to Austria, spending the summer and autumn months in the market town of St. Wolfgang in the Salzkammergut resort region and in Vienna. He died in the Austrian spa town of Bad Ischl in 1957. He wrote his first novel, \"The Third Bullet\", in 1915 while recovering from a wound sustained in the First World War. In all Perutz wrote eleven novels, which gained the admiration of Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, Ian Fleming, Karl Edward Wagner and Graham Greene. Wagner cited Perutz' novel \"The Master of the Day of Judgement\" as one of the thirteen best non-supernatural horror novels.\n\nPerutz was born in Prague to a largely non-religious family of Jewish ancestry. They moved to Vienna, where he attended various schools and colleges before studying probability theory, statistics, actuarial science, and economics.\n\nPerutz' novels are short and are usually historical novels combining fast-paced adventure with a metaphysical twist.\nThey are influenced by the work of E. T. A. Hoffmann, Arthur Schnitzler and Victor Hugo (whose work Perutz\ntranslated into German). Austrian fellow novelist Friedrich Torberg once characterized Perutz' literary style as the possible result of a little infidelity of Franz Kafka and Agatha Christie. \"The Marquis of Bolibar\" features the Wandering Jew appearing\nduring Napoleon's campaign in Spain. \"By Night Under the Stone Bridge\" is an episodic work whose separate stories are bound together by the illicit love shared, in their dreams, by a Jewish woman and the Emperor Rudolf II. In the posthumously-published \"Leonardo's Judas\", da Vinci's quest for an appropriate face to give the betrayer in his \"Last Supper\" is interwoven with the squabble between a usurer and the merchant to whom he owes money. The title of his 1933 novel \"Saint Peter's Snow\" (also known in English as \"The Virgin's Brand\"), which is set in what was then the present day, refers to a drug which induces religious fervour; the Nazis, understandably, did not care for it. Critic Alan Piper considered it \"a psychological detective story\", although it has varyingly been categorised as science fiction or fantasy. Piper believed that the novel was decades ahead of its time due to the description of a hallucinogenic drug derived from an ergot fungus 10 years before the discovery of LSD. He also thought it astonishing that it discussed the experimental use of this hallucinogen on an isolated village 20 years before the 1951 Pont-Saint-Esprit mass poisoning, and proposed that ergot was the psychoactive ingredient used in the ancient mystery cults 40 years before this was put forward as a serious proposal. \"The Master of the Day of Judgement\" is a decidedly different mystery story about the circumstances surrounding an actor's death in the early twentieth century, and \"Little Apple\" concerns a First World War soldier's obsessive quest for revenge.\n\nIn his discussion of German language fantastic literature, critic Franz Rottensteiner describes Perutz as \"undoubtedly the finest fantasy author of his time\". Literary scholar Alan Piper described Perutz's work as typically containing \"an element of the fantastic, with dramatic plots featuring confusing and conflicting interpretations of events\".\n\nIn 1933, Perutz published his novel \"St Petri-Schnee\", which would be published in English in 1935 as \"The Virgin's Brand\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In this episode, Benjamin Sisko and Li Nalas help stop DS9 from being commandeered by the Bajorans, while Kira and Dax try to put an end to the Bajoran nationalist movement known as the Circle.\n\nBajoran assault vessels approach Deep Space Nine as part of a military coup against the Bajoran government led by the xenophobic \"Circle\" movement. Sisko announces that he is evacuating the station's civilian population and anyone who wishes to leave; the entire crew volunteers to stay with him and fight. Li Nalas calms the resulting flood of passengers by inspiring courage in his fellow Bajorans. Quark ends up left on the station when a scheme to make money buying and selling seats on the evacuation ships backfires.\n\nOnce the Bajoran forces arrive, there is no sign of Federation presence; however, General Krim suspects Federation personnel are still aboard. Coup leader Jaro Essa orders Krim to capture Li Nalas alive, convinced that he can bribe Li into joining the Circle. Krim's soldiers begin a search of the station; Odo uses his shape-shifting abilities to help the crew avoid detection.\n\nKira and Dax are sent to bring evidence that the Cardassians are backing the Circle to Bajor. Dropped off on a moon where the Bajorans stored a number of small starfighters during the Cardassian occupation, they manage to get one of the craft working and fly to Bajor. Their ship is shot down by Bajoran fighters and they crash.\n\nSisko and the crew trap a group led by Krim's second-in-command, Colonel Day, in a holosuite. Sisko informs the soldiers about Cardassian involvement with the Circle and releases Day to pass the information to Krim, but the colonel instead tells Krim that the Federation is attempting to wrest control of DS9 from the Bajorans. A scan for Federation communicator signals reveals that they are hiding in the conduits, and Odo informs Sisko that the soldiers intend to flood the conduits with gas. Part of the crew distracts the bulk of the Bajoran forces, after which Li and Sisko capture Krim in an attempt to reason with him.\n\nAlthough Kira was injured in the crash, Dax gets her to Vedek Bareil's monastery. She and Kira disguise themselves as Vedeks to travel to the Chamber of Ministers. Once there, Kira confronts the ministers with proof of Cardassian involvement. Upon learning of the Cardassian involvement, Krim gives control of DS9 back to Sisko. However, Colonel Day attempts to assassinate Sisko in revenge; Li Nalas steps in the way of Day's weapon blast and is killed. Later, Sisko tells Chief O'Brien that Li was a hero of the resistance and that is the way he will remember him.\n\nIn 2015, Geek.com recommended this episode as \"essential watching\" for their abbreviated \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" binge-watching guide, they noted that this episode is part of a trilogy that includes the first three episodes of the second season, (\"The Homecoming\", \"The Circle\", and \"The Siege\").\n\nIn 2018, SyFy recommend this episode for its abbreviated watch guide for the Bajoran character Kira Nerys, as a trilogy with the preceding two episodes.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2235678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2235678", "title": "Tabán", "text": "Tabán\n\nTabán usually refers to an area within the 1st district of Budapest, the capital of Hungary. It lies on the Buda (i.e. Western) side of the Danube, to the south of György Dózsa Square, on the northern side of Elisabeth Bridge and to the east of Naphegy. Outside of Budapest, several other Hungarian cities and towns also have districts called Tabán.\n\nThe Tabán has been inhabited since Neolithic times, due to its location in a protected valley, the thermal waters at the bottom of the Gellért Hill and the ford over the Danube. In the Iron Age, it was inhabited by a tribe of Celts, who were replaced by the Romans in the 1st century BC.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Tabán was a village right under the Buda Castle. Remains of significant medieval structures were discovered by archaeologists in 1936. The Turks developed the thermal medicinal baths in the area and brought immigrants from the Balkans. The population increased after the liberation of Hungary from the Turks as refugees came from Greece, Bosnia and Serbia. The Franciscans from Bosnia established the parish church in the 17th Century which still exists today and the Orthodox inhabitants established their own parish. In the 18th Century, the town was inhabited by Serbs, Greeks, Vlachs, Germans, Croats, Slovaks and Gypsies.\n\nThe history of Tabán is inseparable from that of the neighboring Naphegy and Gellérthegy districts. In the 19th Century, the Tabán became known as a Bohemian quarter of Budapest with many restaurants, bars and bordellos. Its narrow streets on the hillsides echoed a Mediterranean atmosphere.\n\nKereszt Street was the center of old Tabán.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Tabán was demolished in order to facilitate urban planning in Budapest. Today, it is a park very popular with the population of the capital.\n\nAfter the 1930 urban planning in Budapest, only a few old Tabán houses were left in the Naphegy district; one of them was the Tabán school, which was destroyed in January 1945, during the battle of Budapest. Today a sports field can be found where the school once stood. The only original streets remaining are Orom Street in Gellérthegy and Tabán Czakó Street in Naphegy.\n\nTaban's historic and cultural attractions include a Memorial of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution near Naphegy Street and Kereszt Street and the Semmelweiss Orvostörténeti Múzeum near Apród Street.\n\nThe poet Dezső Kosztolányi wrote:\n\n\"\"Köröttem - esős akvarell - Tabán.<br>\n\"Nyugodt lennék itt s boldog is talán...\"\"\n\n\"\"I crossed Tabán - a rainy watercolour.<br>\n\"I would be at peace here and maybe happy too...\"\"\n\nIts major sights include\n\n\nThe following are near Tabán:\n"}

After a season at Wolverhampton Wanderers, he joined Milton Keynes Dons in summer 2007. As well as these three clubs, he has also spent loan periods at Preston North End, Darlington, Leeds United, Stockport County, and Port Vale. He spent the first half of 2011 with Bulgarian side Lokomotiv Sofia, before returning to England in the summer to sign for Southend United; he was released by Southend in December 2011, and two months later signed with Dover Athletic. He joined Tamworth in September 2012. Having made one appearance for the club, he left Tamworth to return to the United States with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers. He went on to play for the New York Cosmos in the 2014 season, for Jacksonville Armada the following three seasons, and then joined Fresno FC in January 2018.\n\nThough born in the United States, Johnson's family moved to Macclesfield when he was five years old.

He scored his first senior goal, in his first start, on 29 January at Ewood Park, in Blackburn's Fourth Round 3–0 victory over Colchester United. He also played in the Fifth Round goalless draw with Burnley at Turf Moor, but played not further part in Rovers' semi-final run. He also made three substitute appearances in the Premier League during the 2004–05 season.\n\nIn October 2005, he joined Championship side Preston North End on loan, he played three games at Deepdale, scoring against Hull City.

Johnson scored three times in nine starts.\n\nHaving failed to establish himself in the Rovers first team, Johnson joined Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers in August 2006 for an undisclosed fee. He scored two match-winning goals in his first two league games for the club – to the delight of manager Mick McCarthy, but by the end of the season he scored just one further goal. He joined Leeds United on a three-month loan in February 2007, but had a frustrating time at Elland Road, making just five appearances. Back at Molineux he was placed on the transfer list.\n\nIn August 2007, Paul Ince's Milton Keynes Dons paid an undisclosed fee for Johnson, and he signed a two-year contract. In his first season at the club, he scored some vital goals, including one against Swansea City to help get the Dons into the League Trophy final. He also played at Wembley in the final itself, as the Dons beat Grimsby Town 2–0 to lift the trophy. He also helped the club top the League Two table.\n\nJohnson struck six times in 2008–09, as the Dons finished two points off an automatic promotion place to the Championship. He did not feature in the play-off encounter with eventual promotion winners Scunthorpe United. His contract ran out in May 2009; however, he re-signed with the club in July 2009, penning a new two-year deal after former Wolves player Paul Ince returned to the management post.\n\nDespite starting the 2009–10 season well, scoring a hat-trick against Northampton Town in a pre-season friendly, he lost his first team place in November.

United and Kansas City Wizards, but neither club offered him a contract. New Zealand club Wellington Phoenix FC did offer him a contract, though nothing came of the offer. Back at Stadium MK he once again found himself on the bench. He joined Port Vale on a one-month loan in September 2010, manager Micky Adams intending to use the player on the wing following Lewis Haldane's injury and Abdulai Bell-Baggie's departure. Vale seemed to have extended Johnson's loan spell by a further month, however his parent club recalled him at the last minute. In January 2011 Johnson left Milton Keynes Dons when his contract was terminated by mutual consent.\n\nIn January 2011, he rejected offers from English league clubs and instead moved to Bulgaria to play for top-flight side Lokomotiv Sofia.

He left the club by mutual consent in the summer, following a fourth-place finish in the league.\n\nIn July 2011, Johnson returned to England to sign a twelve-month contract (with an option to extend) with League Two side Southend United. He made two starts and five substitute appearances for the \"Shrimpers\" before 28 October, when he was placed under police arrest for his alleged role in a fight outside a nightclub in Ilford.

However, he played just 18 minutes as a substitute, before leaving The Lamb Ground.\n\nJohnson joined Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the North American Soccer League for the spring period of the 2013 season. On 23 June, he played in an international friendly against Brazilian side Cruzeiro Esporte Clube in front of a season high crowd at Lockhart Stadium.\n\nIn June 2013, it was confirmed by the New York Cosmos and their head coach Giovanni Savarese that Johnson would be playing for them starting in the fall period of the 2013 season. During the Cosmos' pre-season tour of England Johnson suffered a knee injury against Leyton Orient, ruling him out of action for the beginning of the fall season. He made his Cosmos' debut on 2 November, playing 18 minutes as a substitute in a 1–0 win over the Atlanta Silverbacks. Due to his knee injury this was the only action Johnson saw in the 2013 campaign.\n\nIn 2014, Johnson was a regular contributor to the Cosmos attack. On 26 July, he scored his first goal for the Cosmos in a 1–1 draw with his former club, Fort Lauderdale Strikers. Playing primarily on the left wing, Johnson had one goal and two assists in 19 appearances during the 2014 NASL regular season.\n\nIn December 2014, Johnson made the move to newly-formed NASL club Jacksonville Armada. He scored the first goal of the opening game of the 2015 regular season, which in addition to making him Armada's first competitive goalscorer, his strike at 12 seconds into the game set the modern-era NASL record for fastest goal. He ended the 2015 season with five goals in 29 matches. He scored two goals in 24 appearances across the 2016 season. The 2017 season would be his last at Hodges Stadium, and he played 24 games without scoring a goal for Mark Lowry's \"Boys in Blue\".\n\nOn 18 January 2018, Johnson signed a one-year contract with newly-formed United Soccer League side Fresno FC. He scored nine goals in 30 games during the 2018 season as head coach Adam Smith led the team to a 12th-place finish. He scored seven goals in 33 games in the 2019 season; Fresno reached the Conference Quarterfinals, where they were beaten 3–2 by El Paso Locomotive FC at Chukchansi Park.\n\nJohnson is a pacey player; he also has good shooting ability from long-range, and is also effective in one-on-one situations.\n\n\n"}

It marked Presley's return to live performance after seven years during which his career was centered on the movie business. Presley was unhappy with his distance from musical trends of the time and the low quality movie productions he was involved in.\n\nInitially planned as a Christmas special by the network and Presley's manager Colonel Tom Parker, producer Bob Finkel transformed the idea. He hired director Steve Binder to update Presley's sound, and to create a concert that would be current and appeal to a younger audience. Filming took place in June 1968 at NBC Studios in Burbank, California. The show consisted of a sit-down section, stand-up numbers and two musicals. The sit-down session showcased Presley in an informal setting, surrounded by fans and small band.\n\nThe special garnered positive reviews when it aired, topped the Nielsen television ratings for the week, and was the most watched show of the season. Later known as the \"Comeback Special\", it re-launched Presley's singing career and his return to live performance.\n\nAfter he returned from serving in the United States Army in March 1960, Presley enjoyed success with his album releases. \"G.I. Blues\", the soundtrack album to his movie \"G.I. Blues\" (1960) topped both the \"Billboard\" Pop Albums chart and the UK Albums Chart in October 1960. On March 25, 1961, Presley played a concert in Hawaii to benefit the construction of the USS \"Arizona\" Memorial. It would be his last public performance for seven years. Presley's next number one album on the \"Billboard\" Pop Albums chart was \"Something for Everybody\" released in June 1961.\nHis manager, Colonel Tom Parker, decided to shift the focus of Presley's career to movie-making, and stopped him touring. The films were low-budget, formulaic comedies. Their releases were successful at the box office, while the resulting albums sold well. Presley attempted to move into more dramatic roles, trying to reduce the prominence of musical numbers to center on his acting with \"Flaming Star\" (1960) and \"Wild in the Country\" (1961). Both releases flopped, and by 1964 Parker decided to limit all recordings exclusively to movie soundtracks. Parker then set the Presley formula: the films would promote album releases, while album releases would promote the films.\n\nTo further cheapen the process, producer Hal Wallis decided to shorten filming schedules, almost abandoning rehearsals and retakes. He stopped shooting on location and centered all his activities in the studio. Wallis also resorted to smaller studios, dropping experienced crews. Scenes were limited to long shots, medium shots and close-ups to speed up the process. Meanwhile, studio recordings also declined in quality, with musicians often recording their parts before Presley himself. By 1965, Presley was paid $750,000 and fifty percent of the film profits for his appearance in \"Tickle Me\" (1965). This payment made up most of the film's budget. Since the studio, Allied Artists, had financial problems, Parker decided to put unused songs from other studio sessions on the soundtrack and instructed the studio to work them into the film. The tight production worked, and on its release, it was a box office success.\n\n\"Girl Happy\" (1965) marked the first failure of this approach. The soundtrack was Presley's most unsuccessful release, while the film barely grossed $2 million. Despite the success of Parker's model, Presley soon grew discontented with the quality of his work. With the passage of time, he considered his connection to the music business was being weakened, and he felt depressed and alienated as the quality of his films deteriorated. During a five-year span—1964 through 1968—Presley had only one top-ten hit: \"Crying in the Chapel\" (1965), a gospel number recorded in 1960. While the 1964 release \"Viva Las Vegas\" enjoyed success, the follow-up films saw a progressive decline. By 1967, the difficulty of negotiating with Parker and the poor performance of the films led Wallis to opt out of his contract with Presley.\n\nIn October 1967, Parker approached West Coast vice president of NBC, Tom Sarnoff. Parker proposed a deal for a Christmas television special. The US$1,250,000 package included the financing of a motion picture (for US$850,000), its soundtrack (for US$25,000), the television special (US$250,000) and US$125,000 reserved for the costs related to a re-run. The special was to be included in the feature \"Singer Presents...\", sponsored by the Singer Corporation.\n\nPresley's initial reaction to the special was negative. He felt it was another scheme by Parker and was angered by the idea of singing Christmas carols on national television. His opinion started to change after he began talks with the special's producer, Bob Finkel. Finkel was able to persuade Singer, NBC and Parker to alter the show's original concept. He obtained Parker's approval on agreeing to his terms: the show was to be centered only on Presley, while enough material for a soundtrack album and a Christmas single was to be recorded. Presley's enthusiasm for the project grew, and he assured Finkel he was ready to perform new material, different from anything he had previously done. He had no interest in Parker's opinion of the project.\n\nTo reflect the new direction Presley's career was intended to take, Finkel thought of director Steve Binder. Binder had directed the concert film \"T.A.M.I. Show\" and worked for NBC on \"Hullabaloo\", as well as for the Petula Clark television special aired by the network. Finkel felt the addition of Binder would refresh Presley's image, and the director would be able to re-introduce him to the new audiences. Initially reluctant to direct the special, Binder was convinced by his associate, Bones Howe. Howe met Presley during the 1950s, while he worked at Radio Recorders as an audio engineer. He insisted on working with Presley, since he thought Binder had similar production methods. A meeting was arranged with Parker, during which Presley's manager assured the team they would be given full creative control, while he stressed that the publishing rights to the material had to be under Presley's name. Howe and Binder met with Presley later that week, and told the singer they would prepare all the details of the special, and have them ready by the time he returned from his vacation in Hawaii.\n\nBinder and Howe then hired the production crew, repeating their collaboration with various people they had used for past specials. Billy Goldenberg was assigned as the musical director, while the Presley camp chose Billy Strange as the arranger. Chris Bearde and Allan Blye were hired as the writers, and Bill Belew for the costume design. Bearde and Blye proposed an idea based on Maurice Maeterlinck's \"The Blue Bird\". It was intended to portray Presley's career through his songs, with its climax coming together in the special. Singer's representative, Alfred Discipio, approved the idea, as did Parker. The snippets of the story were connected by a number covering Jerry Reed's \"Guitar Man\".\nAn informal segment was planned featuring Presley talking to members of his entourage in a scripted conversation that was to show him as self-deprecating while discussing his movie performances. A gospel number would be added, as well as a live stand-up performance. Then the Christmas song, requested by Parker, would be played; the special would close with a spoken statement by Presley. Binder wanted him to express his feelings about the current situation in the US. Presley had been moved by the recent assassinations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. King's assassination deeply touched Presley, who felt that his killing, having taken place in Memphis, Tennessee, \"only confirmed everyone's worst feelings about the south\".\n\nBy June 3, Presley returned to Hollywood to start the rehearsals that would last for two weeks. At the time, Howe insisted on the possibility of a soundtrack for the album, with the idea of collecting royalties from it as the producer. NBC saw Howe's attitude as a potential danger to the special and ordered Binder to remove him from the staff. The production was further complicated when Goldenberg complained to Binder about Strange not turning in any musical arrangements for the special with only two weeks before the end of pre-production. Binder talked to Strange, who left the special alleging he was too busy with other projects. A week before the end of rehearsals, the production team allowed Howe to return as producer and engineer.\n\nOn June 17, the team moved to the NBC studios in Burbank, California. Goldenberg asked producer Finkel to remove Presley's large entourage from the production area, complaining that his companions interfered with the creative process. Presley started to work with choreographer Lance LeGault on the planned numbers, and Belew started to work with the costumes.\n\nBinder and Howe developed the concept of the informal section of the show after seeing Presley interacting with his entourage while playing music during breaks. Binder planned to shoot the segment in the locker room to give the public a sense of how Presley's music was developed in an intimate setting. Parker opposed this concept. Binder settled for a sit-down concert, set in a small stage that resembled a boxing ring. He called Presley's first backup musicians, Scotty Moore and DJ Fontana, to accentuate the nature of the singer's musical origins (Presley's original bassist, Bill Black, had passed away in 1965). They were also joined by members of Presley's entourage Charlie Hodge and Alan Fortas. The scripted part was cancelled, but the writers gave Presley a list of topics to discuss between songs. The topics included mentions of his early career, his Hollywood years and the current music business.\n\nOn June 20, Presley started the recording process at United Western Recorders. Howe arranged for rhythm section, session musicians from Los Angeles. The band was composed of drummer Hal Blaine and guitarists Mike Deasy and Tommy Tedesco. Part of the string and brass sections of the NBC orchestra were also enlisted. All the material, except the live sections of the show, was pre-recorded by Presley. It was to be blended with live vocals during the production numbers, which were taped on June 27.\n\nOn the same day, Presley taped the first sit-down show. Colonel Parker had told the NBC team he would take care of the ticket distribution. He assured them he would fly fans from different parts of the country to fill the studio. By the day of the show, however, Parker had not distributed the tickets, and only a few people were in line to see the taping. Binder and Finkel invited people from a restaurant across the street and put an announcement on a local radio station to round up an audience for the taping. Presley was nervous at the beginning of the first hour-long set. Binder had to convince him to take the stage, but once there, Presley was comfortable. He performed his songs and traded jokes with his companions as the session progressed. By the end of the first show, Belew had to carefully remove the sweat-soaked leather suit that was now stuck to Presley's skin. To get it ready for the next show, he had to hand wash it. He was helped by the rest of the costume crew who used hairdryers to hasten the process. Steve Binder claimed that Presley's outfit needed cleaning not just because he perspired, but because he had ejaculated while performing. For the 8:00 pm show, individual rubber mats were placed at the feet of Presley and the band. During the first show, the producers were concerned about the effects of the toe tapping on the recordings. The second show found Presley relaxed and running through the set list with ease.\n\nOn June 29, Presley recorded both stand-up sessions. As with the first two shows, the cameras that shot Presley from different angles did not have individual taping machines. The director chose the camera angle he desired, and the cameras fed either of the two available taping machines. The arrangements of the songs for the stand-up shows were fast-paced — Presley accompanied them with shakes, gyrations and facial expressions that he emphasized with fist gestures and knee-drops.\n\nFor the show's closer, Binder decided to replace the spoken statement with a song. He instructed Goldenberg and lyricist Walter Earl Brown to write a song that reflected Presley and his beliefs. Brown wrote “If I Can Dream” the same night. Binder sent it to Parker, who still thought the show closer was \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\". After Parker's negative response to the song, Binder bypassed him, and played the song for Presley. After hearing it three times, Presley was convinced to record it. Seeing Presley's determination, Parker demanded 100 percent of the publishing rights. Goldenberg removed his name from the publishing sheet, and told Parker that Brown wrote the song. For this number, Presley wore a three-piece white suit designed by Belew. A large sign in red letters that read ELVIS was placed on the black background, while Presley performed the song with a hand-held microphone. After finishing the song, Presley closed the special by saying \"Thank you, Good night.”\n\nThe special's final running time was 50 minutes, edited from four hours of taping. Presley was satisfied with the result. \"Singer Presents...Elvis\" aired on December 3, 1968, at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. It placed first in the Nielsen television ratings for the week ending on December 8, 1968, displacing \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\" which dropped to the second position. 42 percent of the total television audience viewed it, making it the most watched show of the season. The special's soundtrack was released shortly after. It reached number eight on \"Billboard's\" Top LPs chart, and by July 1969, it was certified gold.\n\n\"The New York Times\" opened its review describing Presley's breakthrough, and his influence on the musicians of the time. It observed that on this special, he was \"rather conservative\" compared to his new peers. Critic Robert Shelton called the mixture of Presley's looks and his audience a \"\"reductio ad absurdum\"\". He stressed the singer's impact on music, but felt the program showed the performer less energetic, but still in touch with the musical trends of the time.\n\nThe review by the Newspaper Enterprise Association published in the \"El Paso Herald-Post\" felt that the special showcased a renewed and \"more mature\" Presley. \"The Daily Tar Heel\" published a favorable review of the special, remarking on the change since the singer's heyday, declaring: \"Elvis still has magic.\"\n\nThe Associated Press described Presley's performance as \"caged-animal energy\", that still pleased audiences. The \"Ottawa Journal\" praised the singer, while it noted that he delivered a calmer stage presence compared to his early days. The reviewer lamented the editing of the program, and the selection of the \"cage-like stage\" in which Presley appeared to pace — \"not at ease\".\n\nJon Landau of \"Eye\" magazine found Presley's return \"magical\", and described his performance as powerful and effortless. Dave Marsh declared the performance one of \"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\".\n\nAfter the taping of the first sit-down session, Presley called Parker to his dressing room, and told him he wanted to return to touring. During a press conference, Parker announced that Presley would soon embark on a \"Comeback Tour\". Parker's choice of words angered Presley, who felt he was being labeled a \"has-been\". Presley was also interested in further collaboration with Binder, but Parker avoided it.\n\nBy January 1969, propelled by the success of the special, and his renewed enthusiasm, Presley started his return to recording non-soundtrack albums with producer Chips Moman. Recorded at American Sound Studio with the house band known as \"The Memphis Boys\", the resulting country-soul album was titled \"From Elvis in Memphis\". The non-album cut \"Suspicious Minds\" became the last chart-topper of Presley's career, and one of his signature songs. In July 1969, \"Rolling Stone\" featured a picture of Presley, taken during one of the show's stand-up segments, on its cover.\n\nParker arranged Presley's return to performing live. He made a deal with Kirk Kerkorian, owner of the Las Vegas International Hotel, for Presley to play the newly built, 2,000-seat showroom for four weeks (two shows per night, with Mondays off) for $400,000. For his appearance, he assembled a band later known as the TCB Band: James Burton (guitar), John Wilkinson (rhythm guitar), Jerry Scheff (bass-guitar), Ronnie Tutt (drums), Larry Muhoberac (piano) and Charlie Hodge (rhythm guitar, background vocals). The band was accompanied by the backing vocals of The Sweet inspirations and The Imperials. His initial Las Vegas show attracted an audience of 101,500 — a new Vegas performance record. By 1970, Presley began to tour the United States for the first time in 13 years.\n\nNBC rebroadcast the special in the summer of 1969. The song \"Blue Christmas\" was replaced by the number \"Tiger Man\", at Parker's request. In 1977, the program was aired in a special presented after Presley’s death by Ann-Margret called \"Memories of Elvis\". It included a bordello scene, which was originally approved by the censors, but removed by the Singer Corporation to avoid controversy.\n\nIn 1985, HBO broadcast the first sit-down session of the show under the title \"Elvis: One Night With You\". Elvis Presley Enterprises' business manager Joe Rascoff sold the channel the broadcasting rights for $1,000,000. A home video version was later released. The same year, the original broadcast of the special was released on home video.\n\nIn 2004, \"Elvis: '68 Comeback Special Deluxe Edition\" DVD was released. The three disc set contained all the known available footage of the special, outtakes included. A single-disc edition was released in 2006 with the program expanded to 94 minutes, by adding material from the outtakes to the original broadcast.\n\nIn 2018, 'Elvis '68 Comeback Special: 50th Anniversary Celebration' saw the Television Special remastered and distributed to over 500 theaters across America.\n\nAn edited, undated abridgement of the special, stripped of all its credits and non-musical elements and aired in combination with Presley's later special \"Aloha from Hawaii\", is part of the library of \"Captain Atlantis\" miscellaneous programs that air during weekend overnights on Newfoundland television station CJON-DT. It is typically aired during the weekend nearest the anniversary of Presley's death.\n\nThe first single of the special released was \"If I Can Dream\" by RCA Victor (47–9670) in October 1968. It reached number twelve on the \"Billboard\" Singles chart, while it sold eight hundred thousand copies.\nIn November 1968, the live performance of \"Tiger Man\" appeared on the RCA Camden compilation album \"Elvis Sings Flaming Star\" (PRS-279), which was first released through \"Singer\" Sewing Machine stores and given wide release in April 1969 (CAS 2304).\n\nAn official soundtrack album, simply titled \"Elvis\" but widely known as \"Elvis (NBC TV Special)\", was released in December 1968 on RCA LPM-4088. In March 1969, RCA released \"Memories\" as a single (47–9730). (\"Memories\" would later be reused as the closing credits music for the 1972 concert film \"Elvis on Tour\".)\n\nBootleg albums featuring non-issued material began circulating as early as 1978. Over the following decades, additional performances from the TV Special were released in parts, particularly in RCA's \"A Legendary Performer\" compilation series, as well as in the 1985 box set \"A Golden Celebration\", although in the 1990s and 2000s, RCA issued more-complete soundtrack recordings. In 1998, it issued , a 30th anniversary release that was an expansion of the original \"NBC-TV Special\" album. That same year RCA released \"Tiger Man\" which consisted of the complete sit-down performances. In 2006, RCA released \"Let Yourself Go: The Making of Elvis the Comeback Special\", which consisted of outtakes and rehearsal recordings from the special.\n\nVarious \"'68 Comeback\" recordings were used as the soundtrack to the \"Elvis\" pinball machine, released by Stern in 2004. The version of \"A Little Less Conversation\" originally recorded for (but not used in) the special was later remixed and became a hit single in 2002. In the United States, the song peaked at number 50 on the \"Billboard Hot 100\" pop singles chart, the first hit for Presley since 1981, and extending his list of charted singles into the 21st century. It also spent four consecutive weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe sit-down sections of the special were a forerunner of \"MTV Unplugged\", showing for the first time an artist in a casual setting.\nIn \"The Simpsons\"' 1993 episode \"Krusty Gets Kancelled\", the set of Krusty's television special mimicked Presley's show. Falco's videoclip for his 1986 single \"Emotional\" features the Austrian singer standing in front of a huge logo formed by red lightbulbs, similar to the one used in the opening sequence of Presley's show, spelling out FALCO instead of ELVIS. The same logo is also used on the cover of his same-titled album. In the videoclip of the 2001 single \"Inner Smile\", Texas lead singer Sharleen Spiteri dressed as Presley in his Comeback Special looks. Robbie Williams, in his 2002 DVD \"The Robbie Williams Show\", borrowed from Presley's special the same opening song (\"Trouble\") with the same arrangement and a very similar staging, as well as the giant red logo (spelling out RW) and almost-identical sets for the concert performances. In 2004 Morrissey toured with a stage backdrop that spelled out MORRISSEY in large red marquee Comeback Special-style lights. Also, Danzig loosely based his 2013 \"\"Legacy\" TV Special\" on the program. The special is portrayed in the 2005 biographical television miniseries \"Elvis\" starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Green Day paid homage to the \"Guitar Man\" portion from the opening number in the music video to \"Father of All...\".\n\n"}

Torrey\n\nRaymond Hezekiah Torrey (July 15, 1880 – July 15, 1938) was the author of weekly columns, \"Outings\" and \"The Long Brown Path\" in the \"New York Evening Post\" in the 1920s and 1930s. The column played a major role in the development of the Appalachian Trail, the Long Path and the popularity of hiking generally. He was a founding member of the New York–New Jersey Trail Conference and one of the authors of the first edition of the \"New York Walk Book\". He had extensive scientific knowledge, writing about everything from the short-billed marsh wren to marine fossils and lichens; he could identify over 700 plants. He was secretary of the Association for the Preservation of the Adirondacks, and also secretary of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society.\n\nBorn in Georgetown, Massachusetts, where his father was a sea captain, he began a career in journalism in newspapers in the Berkshires first, but soon moved to New York City. In 1903 he started at the \"New York American\", then moved to the \"Tribune\" and finally the \"Evening Post\" (today the \"New York Post\") in 1918. He became involved in the New York hiking scene at a time when the forests and mountains of the Hudson Highlands were relatively unknown but interest in the outdoors was increasing and city hiking clubs were coming into existence.\n\nIn the early 1920s Torrey developed a weekly outdoor column for the \"Post\", called the \"Long Brown Path\" which was named for a line in Walt Whitman's \"Song of the Open Road\". Major William A. Welch, General Manager of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, was interested in creating hiking trails in Bear Mountain-Harriman State Parks, but was lacking funds. Welch suggested that Torrey use his influential column to help organize New York metropolitan area hiking clubs into a volunteer trail-building confederation; this led to the creation of the Palisades Interstate Park Trail Conference, a precursor of the NY/NJTC.\n\nTorrey not only wrote the columns, he organized and coordinated the resulting volunteers and did plenty of route-scouting and trail building himself.\n\nThe column was very popular: along with news of the clubs and their trails, it included a listing of hikes, as many as 20 or 30 weekly. He also used the column as a \"bully pulpit\", railing against litter, championing environmental causes, giving notice of upcoming conservation bills in New York and New Jersey, and organizing letter-writing campaigns in support of reforestation measures and proposals for the creation of new parks.\n\nIn 1922 Torrey publicized a proposal by forester Benton MacKaye to build a trail from Maine to Georgia (subsequently named the Appalachian Trail or AT) with a story under a full-page banner headline reading \"A Great Trail from Maine to Georgia!\"; the idea was quickly adopted by the new Trail Conference as their main project.\n\nWorking with volunteers organized by J. Ashton Allis of the Trail Conference, Torrey helped blaze the first of the AT running from the Ramapo River to Fingerboard Mountain. By January 4, 1924, the stretch from the Hudson to the Ramapo River was complete. On November 18 of that year, he worked with the Tramp and Trail Club on what he dubbed a \"Speed Special\", clearing and blazing a section through Sterling Forest, New York. \n\nThe effort involved much more than the physical effort of building and blazing trails— complex negotiations with property owners were required as well, particularly east of the Hudson where no established system of hiking trails existed. By 1929, with the help of New Jersey state park officials, a section from the Delaware River to High Point along the Kittatinny Ridge was completed. Two years later, of the AT, from the Delaware River to Kent, Connecticut, was in place.\n\nLater that year, he tangled with Robert Moses, a onetime ally who had named him secretary of the New York State Parks Council, a forerunner to the current New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, in order to help establish Letchworth State Park. Torrey opposed the route Moses wanted for the Northern State Parkway along Long Island's central glacial moraine. He had arranged for the reprinting of an article sharing this view in the ASHPS newsletter, which enraged Moses.\n\nOn September 12, Moses learned that Torrey had been providing information about Parks Council meetings, information that was available to the public in any event, to an attorney for wealthy North Shore landowners similarly opposed to the road project. He called Torrey to his office, where the council's finance committee was meeting, and berated him for this and the newsletter article, which he considered serious breaches of trust. \n\nTorrey stood firm and defended both actions. When Moses responded to Torrey's telling him he had no right to tell him what he could and could not print by saying \"Goddamn you! What do you mean by doing something like that?\", Torrey, who had many Jewish friends, lost his temper and said \"You big noisy kike; you can't talk to me like that.\" Moses attempted to choke him and had to be pulled off Torrey by other members of the committee; he threw a smoking stand at Torrey afterwards.\n\nWhile Torrey apologized for the incident (and Moses did not), he eventually resigned from the Parks Council, a move which ultimately gave Moses control of that body.\n\nTorrey died of a heart attack on his 58th birthday, stunning the hiking community. The NY/NJTC soon found that it took a committee to do the work he alone had carried out. A memorial was placed on Long Mountain in Harriman State Park, which had one of his favorite views, reading \"In Memory of Raymond H. Torrey, A Great Disciple of the \"Long Brown Path\", 1880-1938.\" His ashes were scattered to the winds there in a brief ceremony.\n\n\n"}

DeVos is known for her support for school choice, school voucher programs, and charter schools. She was Republican National Committeewoman for Michigan from 1992 to 1997 and served as chair of the Michigan Republican Party from 1996 to 2000, with reelection to the post in 2003. She has advocated for the Detroit charter school system and she is a former member of the board of the Foundation for Excellence in Education. She has served as chair of the board of the Alliance for School Choice and the Acton Institute and headed the All Children Matter PAC. \n\nDeVos is married to former Amway CEO Dick DeVos. Her brother, Erik Prince, a former U.S. Navy SEAL officer, is the founder of Blackwater USA. Their father is Edgar Prince, founder of the Prince Corporation. In 2016, the family was listed by \"Forbes\" as the 88th-richest in America, with an estimated net worth of $5.4 billion.\n\nOn November 23, 2016, then-President-elect Donald Trump announced that he would nominate DeVos to serve as Secretary of Education in his administration. On January 31, following strong opposition to the nomination from Democrats, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions approved her nomination on a party-line vote, sending her nomination to the Senate floor. On February 7, 2017, she was confirmed by the Senate by a 51–50 margin, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking the tie in favor of her nomination. This was the first time in U.S. history that a Cabinet nominee's confirmation was decided by the Vice President's tiebreaking vote.\n\nDeVos was born Elisabeth Prince on January 8, 1958. She grew up in Holland, Michigan, the eldest of four children born to Elsa (Zwiep) Prince (later, Broekhuizen) and Edgar Prince, a billionaire industrialist of Dutch ancestry. Edgar was the founder of Prince Corporation, an automobile parts supplier based in Holland, Michigan.\n\nDeVos was educated at the Holland Christian High School, a private school located in her home town of Holland, Michigan. She graduated from Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in business economics in 1979. During college, DeVos was involved with campus politics, volunteered for Gerald Ford's presidential campaign, and attended the 1976 Republican National Convention to participate in a program for young Republicans.\n\nDeVos grew up as a member of the Christian Reformed Church in North America. She has been a member and elder of Mars Hill Bible Church in Grand Rapids. Former Fuller Seminary president Richard Mouw, with whom DeVos served on a committee, said she is influenced by Dutch neo-Calvinist theologian Abraham Kuyper, a founding figure in Christian Democracy political ideology.\n\nSince 1982, DeVos has participated in the Michigan Republican Party. She served as a local precinct delegate for the Michigan Republican Party, having been elected for 16 consecutive two-year terms since 1986. She was a Republican National Committeewoman for Michigan between 1992 and 1997, and served as chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party from 1996 to 2000. In 2004, the \"Lansing State Journal\" described DeVos as \"a political pit bull for most of [Gov. Jennifer] Granholm's 16 months in office,\" and said that if DeVos was not Granholm's \"worst nightmare,\" she was \"certainly her most persistent\". Bill Ballenger, editor of the newsletter \"Inside Michigan Politics\" and a former Republican state senator, called DeVos \"a good behind-the-scenes organizer and a good fund raiser\" as well as \"a true believer in core Republican issues that leave nobody in doubt on where she stands\". DeVos resigned the position in 2000. She said in 2000, \"It is clear I have never been a rubber stamp ... I have been a fighter for the grassroots, and following is admittedly not my strong suit.\" In 2003, DeVos ran again for party chairman and was elected to the post without opposition.\n\nDeVos personally raised more than $150,000 for the 2004 Bush re-election campaign, and hosted a Republican fundraiser at her home in October 2008 that was headlined by President George W. Bush. During the Bush Administration she spent two years as the finance chairperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and worked closely with the Administration on \"various projects\". The DeVos family has been active in Republican politics for decades, particularly as donors to candidates and the party, giving more than $17 million to political candidates and committees since 1989.\n\nIn a 1997 op-ed for \"Roll Call\", DeVos wrote that she expects results from her political contributions. \"My family is the largest single contributor of soft money to the national Republican Party. I have decided to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence,\" she wrote. \"Now I simply concede the point. They are right.\" She also stated in the op-ed, \"We expect to foster a conservative governing philosophy consisting of limited government and respect for traditional American virtues … We expect a return on our investment; we expect a good and honest government. Furthermore, we expect the Republican Party to use the money to promote these policies and, yes, to win elections.\"\n\nDuring the Republican Party presidential primaries for the 2016 election, DeVos initially donated to Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina before eventually supporting Marco Rubio. In March 2016, DeVos described Donald Trump as an \"interloper\" and said that he \"does not represent the Republican Party\".\n\nDeVos is chairwoman of the Windquest Group, a privately held operating group that invests in technology, manufacturing, and clean energy. DeVos and her husband founded it in 1989. With a commitment of $100 million, Betsy DeVos was one of the largest investors—and losers—in blood-testing company Theranos.\n\nDeVos and her husband were producers for a Broadway run of the stage play \"\", in 2012, based on the life of the famous evangelist and featuring a book and lyrics written by Kathie Lee Gifford. The show ran for three weeks, closing in December 2012 after receiving negative reviews.\n\nBetsy and her husband Dick are chief investors in and board members of Neurocore, a group of brain performance centers offering biofeedback therapy for disorders such as depression, attention deficit disorder, autism, and anxiety. The therapy consists of showing movies to patients and interrupting them when they become distracted, in an effort to retrain their brains. According to \"The New York Times\", a review of Neurocore's claims and interviews with medical experts suggest that the company's conclusions are unproven and its methods questionable. Democratic senators raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and questioned whether she and her family members would \"benefit financially from actions\" she could take as the U.S. Secretary of Education. DeVos announced that she would step down from the company's board but would retain her investment in the company, valued at $5 million to $25 million. In November 2019, Truth In Advertising filed complaints against Neurocore with the Food and Drug Administration for unapproved medical devices and the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive marketing.\n\nOn November 23, 2016, Trump's transition team announced DeVos as the nominee to be the next Secretary of Education. Upon her nomination, DeVos said \"I am honored to work with the President-elect on his vision to make American education great again. The \"status quo\" in ed is not acceptable.\" DeVos's nomination was generally criticized by teachers unions and praised by supporters of school choice.\n\n\"Detroit Free Press\" editor Stephen Henderson expressed concerns over DeVos's nomination, writing that \"DeVos isn't an educator, or an education leader\". Rebecca Mead of \"The New Yorker\" questioned the efficacy of Michigan's charter school system, which DeVos has supported. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, called DeVos \"the most ideological, anti-public education nominee\" since the position became a cabinet position. The Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Michigan Democratic Party opposed DeVos's nomination.\n\nFormer presidential candidates Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney respectively called DeVos an \"outstanding pick\" and a \"smart choice\". Republican Senator Ben Sasse said DeVos \"has made a career out of standing up to powerful and connected special interests on behalf of poor kids who are too often forgotten by Washington\". In an opinion editorial, the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote that \"DeVos has helped lead the national battle to expand education opportunities for children\".\n\nThe confirmation hearing for DeVos was initially scheduled for January 10, 2017, but was delayed for one week after the Office of Government Ethics requested more time to review her financial disclosures. On January 17, 2017 the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions held the hearing, which lasted three-and-one-half hours and \"quickly became a heated and partisan debate\". Democratic senators directed several questions toward her regarding her wealth, including questions about her family's political donations to the Republican Party and whether or not she had personal experience with financial aid or student loans. Several media outlets reported that DeVos appeared to have plagiarized quotes from an Obama administration official in written answers submitted to the Senate committee. DeVos drew widespread media attention during the confirmation hearings for suggesting that guns might have a place in some schools due to a threat from grizzly bears. DeVos's comment was later lampooned by television personalities Kate McKinnon on \"Saturday Night Live\", Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert and James Corden.\n\nPrior to DeVos's confirmation, numerous U.S. Senators from both parties reported tens of thousands of their constituents having contacted their offices in opposition to the confirmation of DeVos. More than 300 state lawmakers from across the U.S., overwhelmingly Democrats, voiced their opposition to DeVos's appointment in a letter to the U.S. Senate sent the day before a scheduled vote on her nomination. DeVos's nomination was supported by 18 Republican governors, including John Kasich and Rick Snyder, along with the nine Republican members of Congress from Michigan.\n\nOn January 31, DeVos's nomination was approved by the committee on a 12–11 party-line vote and was due to be voted on by the Senate. Later on February 1, 2017, two Republican U.S. Senators, Susan Collins from Maine and Lisa Murkowski from Alaska, came out against the confirmation (despite supporting DeVos in committee when both of them voted to move her nomination to the floor), bringing the predicted confirmation vote on DeVos to 50–50 if all Democrats and independents voted as expected, meaning Vice President Mike Pence would have to break the tie. During an unusually early 6:30 a.m. vote on February 3, 2017, cloture was invoked on DeVos's nomination in the Senate, requiring a final vote on the confirmation to happen after 30 hours of debate.\n\nAhead of the scheduled final vote at noon on February 7, 2017, the Democrats in the Senate continuously spoke on the floor against the confirmation of DeVos the entire night before leading up to the vote, in protest of their strong disapproval of the nominee. As expected, there was a 50–50 tie on the final vote, with all Democrats and independents, along with two Republicans (Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski), voting in opposition to DeVos, while the other fifty Republican senators voted in support of the confirmation, including Senator Jeff Sessions, who himself had been nominated by the Trump administration for the post of United States Attorney General. Republicans scheduled Sessions's confirmation vote after DeVos's so that he would be able to cast his vote in support of DeVos. Had his confirmation vote been earlier than hers, he would have been forced to resign from the Senate, therefore losing a vital vote for the Republicans on the confirmation.\nSince there was a tie, Vice President Mike Pence had to step in to decide the vote as the President of the Senate. He cast his tie-breaking vote in favor of DeVos to officially confirm her as education secretary. This was the first tie decided by a vice president on any vote in the Senate since the George W. Bush administration.\n\nDeVos has been a controversial figure through out her tenure. In her first official appearance as Secretary on February 10, 2017, dozens of protesters showed up to prevent her appearance. The protesters physically blocked her from entering through the back entrance of Jefferson Academy, a D.C. public middle school in Southwest, Washington, D.C. DeVos was eventually able to enter the school through a side entrance. \n\nSubsequent to the incident, the U.S. Marshals Service, rather than Education Department employees, began providing security for her. Education Department officials declined requests for information about the deployment of marshals or the current tasks of the Secretary's displaced security team normally assigned to her. Many of those security personnel are former Secret Service agents who have worked at the department for many years. Regarding the withdrawal of the department's team, former Education Secretary Arne Duncan said, \"That's a waste of taxpayer money,\" Duncan said of the use of U.S. Marshals. \n\nDeVos said that on the basis of her first few days in the job, she had concerns that some Education Department employees were sympathetic to the Obama administration. \"I . . . would not be surprised if there are also those that would try to subvert the mission of this organization and this department,\" she stated. Asked what she could do about that, she said, \"Whatever can be done will be done, and it will be done swiftly and surely.\" \n\nDuring her first visit to a public university on April 6, 2017, DeVos was confronted by around 30 protestors. She was touring an area designed to resemble a hospital ward at Florida International University. The following day, the U.S. Marshals Service said after a threat evaluation was conducted in February that DeVos would be given additional security, projecting a cost of $7.8 million between February and September.\n\nOn March 24, 2017, during a visit to the Osceola County campus of Valencia College, DeVos said she was considering the extension of federal financial aid for students that were year-round and interested in placing more focus on community colleges.\n\nOn April 11, 2017, DeVos undid several Obama administration policy memos issued by John King Jr. and Ted Mitchell which were designed to protect student loan borrowers.\n\nIn April 2017, DeVos praised the President's nomination of Carlos G. Muñiz as the Department's general counsel.\n\nIn April 2017, DeVos named Candice Jackson Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Department's Office for Civil Rights, where she will be acting Assistant Secretary while that higher, Senate-confirmed appointment is vacant. DeVos named Jason Botel Deputy Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education. Botel, a registered Democrat who supported President Obama and the Black Lives Matter movement, founded the KIPP Ujima Village Academy in Baltimore, after working for Teach For America.\n\nOn May 10, 2017, DeVos gave a commencement speech at Bethune–Cookman University, a historically black college, and during her speech a majority of the students booed DeVos, with about half of them standing up and turning their backs to her. She also received an honorary doctorate from Bethune–Cookman University. In February, DeVos had released a statement calling historically black colleges \"real pioneers when it comes to school choice\", causing controversy as some pointed out the schools originated after segregation laws prevented African-Americans from attending others. DeVos later acknowledged racism as an important factor in the history of historically black colleges.\n\nDeVos delivered her first extended policy address on March 29, 2017, at the Brookings Institution which included the topic of school choice which has been her main advocacy issue for more than 30 years. She stated an interest in implementing choice policies directed toward children as individuals and criticizing the Obama administration's additional funding of $7 billion for the U.S.'s worst-performing schools as \"throwing money at the problem\" in an attempt to find a solution. On May 22, 2017, DeVos announced the Trump administration was offering \"the most ambitious expansion\" of school choice within American history. DeVos cited Indiana (which has the U.S.'s largest school voucher program) as a potential model for a nationwide policy, but did not give specific proposals. \n\nIn a May 2017 House of Representatives committee hearing, Rep. Katherine Clark, said an Indiana private school which takes publicly funded vouchers maintains it is entitled to deny admission to LGBTQ students or those coming from families with \"homosexual or bisexual activity.\" Clark asked if she would inform Indiana that it could not discriminate in that way if it accepted federal funding, and asked her how she would respond in the event a voucher school rejected black students but a state \"said it was okay.\" DeVos answered: \"Well again, the Office of Civil Rights and our Title IX protections are broadly applicable across the board, but when it comes to parents making choices on behalf of their students...\" Clark stopped her saying, \"This isn't about parents making choices, this is about the use of federal dollars. Is there any situation? Would you say to Indiana, that school cannot discriminate against LGBT students if you want to receive federal dollars? Or would you say the state has the flexibility?\" DeVos responded: \"I believe states should continue to have flexibility in putting together programs ...\" \n\nCBS reporter Lesley Stahl questioned her, in a March 2018 \"60 Minutes\" interview, about the documented failure of the DeVos programs to demonstrate a positive result, in Michigan, her home state: \"Your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better is not working in Michigan ... where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system.\" Stahl added, \"The public schools here are doing worse than they did.\" DeVos was unable to provide any actual examples of improvement, but stated there were \"pockets\" where schools had done better than public schools.\n\nOn June 2, 2017, DeVos announced her support of President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement the prior day.\n\nOn June 6, 2017, DeVos said states' rights would determine private schools being allocated funds by the federal government during an appearance before members of a House appropriations committee.\n\nOn July 6, 2017, Democratic attorneys-general in 18 states and Washington, D.C., led by Massachusetts' attorney-general Maura Healey, filed a federal lawsuit against DeVos for suspending the implementation of rules that were meant to protect students attending for-profit colleges. The rules, developed during the Obama administration, were meant to take effect on July 1, 2017.\n\nOn July 13, 2017, Candice Jackson, who is a sexual assault survivor, organized a meeting with DeVos, college sexual assault victims, accused assailants, and higher education officials, and said she would look at policies on sexual assault accusations on campuses from the Obama administration to see if accused students were treated within their rights. Asked by CBS \"60 Minutes\" reporter Lesley Stahl about her repeal of Obama administration guidelines for colleges dealing with reports of sexual assaults, she said her concern was for men falsely accused of such assaults. \"Survivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved,\" said DeVos. However, some survivors of sexual assault and harassment and organizations which advocate on their behalf oppose the changes and say they would make schools more dangerous.\n\nIn October 2017, DeVos revoked 72 guidance documents of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services which outlined the rights of disabled students under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the Rehabilitation Act.\n\nIn a January 2018 speech, Devos said that the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) found that \"60 percent of its teachers reported having moderate to no influence over the content and skills taught in their own classrooms.\" In response, AFT noted that in the same survey of around 5,000 educators, 86% felt that Devos had disrespected them.\n\nIn March 2018, DeVos announced a School Safety Commission, to provide meaningful and actionable recommendations. Members were four Cabinet members, including herself. The organization held a meeting on March 28 and a gathering of school shooting survivors and families on April 17.\n\nIn mid-May 2018, \"The New York Times\" reported that under DeVos, the size of the team investigating abuses and fraud by for-profit colleges was reduced from about twelve members under the Obama administration to three, with their task also being scaled back to \"processing student loan forgiveness applications and looking at smaller compliance cases\". DeVos also appointed Julian Schmoke as the team's new supervisor; Schmoke was a former dean of DeVry Education Group, which was one of the institutions the team had been investigating. The investigation into DeVry was not the only one stopped, others include those of Bridgepoint Education and Career Education Corporation. The Education Department has hired more ex-employees and people affiliated with those institutions, such as Robert S. Eitel, senior counselor to DeVos, Diane Auer Jones, an advisor to the Department, and Carlos G. Muñiz, the Department's general counsel. Also reported by several news outlets was a sequence of payments made by DeVry to the DeVos Foundation.\n\nIn late May 2018, Devos said that she believed it was \"a school decision\" on whether to report a student's family to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) if the student or their family are undocumented immigrants. However, under \"Plyler v. Doe\", the American Supreme Court ruled under the American constitution, schools are obligated to provide schooling irrespective of immigration status. The American Civil Liberties Union has said that because of this, it would be unconstitutional for schools to report students or their families to ICE.\n\nWhistleblower and former White House staffer, Omarosa Manigault Newman claimed that President Trump referred to her, after she left meetings, as \"Ditzy\" DeVos.\n\nOn September 12, 2018 DeVos lost the lawsuit brought by 19 states and the District of Columbia, which accused the Department of Education of improperly delaying implementation of regulations protecting student loan borrowers from predatory practices. In 2019, DeVos unsuccessfully attempted to cut federal funding for the Special Olympics from her department's budget, which she had also attempted to cut in her previous two annual budgets.\n\nIn May 2019, the Education Department Inspector General released a report concluding that DeVos had used personal email accounts to conduct government business and that she did not properly preserve these emails.\n\nDeVos was listed for many years on IRS form Form 990s as the foundation's vice president (hitherto called the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation). However, she testified under oath in the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing, in response to Senator Maggie Hassan's questions, that she had nothing to do with the contributions made by her mother's foundation to conservative advocacy groups including Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council.\n\nThe Dick & Betsy DeVos Family Foundation was launched in 1989. The foundation's giving, according to its website, is motivated by faith, and \"is centered in cultivating leadership, accelerating transformation and leveraging support in five areas\", namely education, community, arts, justice, and leadership. In 2015, the DeVos Foundation made $11.6 million in charitable contributions, bringing the couple's lifetime charitable giving to $139 million. \"Forbes\" ranked the DeVos family No. 24 on its 2015 list of America's top givers.\n\nThe DeVos Foundation has donated to hospitals, health research, arts organizations, Christian schools, evangelical missions, and conservative, free-market think tanks. Of the $100 million the foundation donated between 1999 until 2014, half of it went to Christian organizations. Organizations funded by the foundation include: Michigan's Foundation for Traditional Values; Center for Individual Rights; Acton Institute; Institute for Justice; Center for Individual Rights; Michigan's Pregnancy Resource Center; Right to Life Michigan Educational Fund; and Baptists for Life.\n\nWith respect to educational-focused donations, the foundation from 1999 to 2014 supported private Christian schools (at least $8.6 million), charter schools ($5.2 million), and public schools ($59,750). Specific donations included $2.39 million to the Grand Rapids Christian High School Association, $652,000 to the Ada Christian School, and $458,000 to Holland Christian Schools.\n\nIn 2016 the Foundation reported $14.3 million in donations to over 100 organizations including the X Prize Foundation, Mars Hill Bible Church, American Enterprise Institute.\n\nWhen DeVos was appointed US Education Secretary, it was revealed that she was an elder at Mars Hill Bible Church. During her tenure, she reportedly donated $431,000 to the church between 2002 and 2004 and $453,349 to Flannel, producer of the NOOMA video series.\n\nDeVos has served as chairperson, board member, and treasurer of the Acton Institute.\n\nDeVos was appointed by President George W. Bush to the board of directors of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 2004, and served until 2010. While she was on the board, she and her husband funded a center to teach arts managers and boards of directors how to fundraise and manage their cultural institutions. The couple donated $22.5 million in 2010 to continue the endeavor, which was given in the name of the DeVos Institute of Arts Management.\n\nAfter the announcement of the DeVoses' gift to the Kennedy Center, DeVos explained that she had been persuaded by Kennedy Center official Michael Kaiser's observation that millions of dollars are invested \"in the arts, and training artists\", but not in \"training the leaders who hire the artists and run the organizations\". The DeVoses' gift was intended to remedy this oversight. \"We want to help develop human capital and leverage that capital to the greatest extent possible\", she said, describing Kaiser's \"practice and approach\" as \"practical, realistic and creative\". The DeVoses' gift, part of which would be spent on arts groups in Michigan that had been hit hard by the recession, was the largest private donation in the Kennedy Center's history.\n\nIn 2009, Betsy DeVos's son Rick DeVos founded ArtPrize, an international art competition held in Grand Rapids, Michigan. approximately 16 percent of ArtPrize's $3.5 million annual budget was provided by various foundations run by the DeVos family, with the rest provided by other foundations and local and national businesses.\n\nDeVos in 2001 listed education activism and reform efforts as a means to \"advance God's Kingdom\". In an interview that year, she also said that \"changing the way we approach ... the system of education in the country ... really may have greater Kingdom gain in the long run\".\n\nDeVos believes education in the United States should encourage the proliferation of charter schools and open up private schools to more students via financial assistance programs, often called vouchers. She has stated that education is \"a closed system, a closed industry, a closed market. It's a monopoly, a dead end.\" DeVos believes that opening up the education market will offer parents increased choice, a view that critics call a drive to privatize the American public education system.\n\nDeVos is known as a \"a fierce proponent of school vouchers\" that would allow students to attend private schools with public funding. According to \"The New York Times\", it \"is hard to find anyone more passionate about the idea of steering public dollars away from traditional public schools than Betsy DeVos\".\n\nDeVos served as chairwoman of the board of Alliance for School Choice. Until November 2016, she headed the All Children Matter PAC which she and her husband founded in 2003 to promote school vouchers, tax credits to businesses that give private school scholarships, and candidates who support these causes. DeVos and her husband gave millions of dollars to the organization. In 2008, All Children Matter was fined $5.2 million in Ohio for illegally laundering money into political campaign funds. DeVos was not named in the case. The fine remained unpaid , prompting calls by Democratic Party lawmakers for DeVos to settle the debt.\n\nHer other activities on behalf of public-school reform have included membership on the boards of directors of the Advocates for School Choice, the American Education Reform Council, and the Education Freedom Fund. She has chaired the boards of Choices for Children, and Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP).\n\nDeVos was chair of the American Federation for Children (AFC). Affiliated with the Alliance for School Choice, the AFC describes itself as \"a leading national advocacy organization promoting school choice, with a specific focus on advocating for school vouchers and scholarship tax credit programs\".\n\nDuring the 1990s, she served on the boards of Children First America and the American Education Reform Council, which sought to expand school choice through vouchers and tax credits. She and her husband worked for the successful passage of Michigan's first charter-school bill in 1993, and for the unsuccessful effort in 2000 to amend Michigan's constitution to allow tax-credit scholarships or vouchers. In response to that defeat, DeVos started a PAC, the Great Lakes Education Project, which championed charter schools. DeVos's husband and John Walton then founded All Children Matter, a political organization, which she chaired.\n\nDeVos has been an advocate for the Detroit charter school system. Douglas N. Harris, professor of economics at Tulane University, wrote in a 2016 \"The New York Times\" op-ed that DeVos was partly responsible for \"what even charter advocates acknowledge is the biggest school reform disaster in the country\". In the National Assessment of Educational Progress, Detroit had the lowest reading and mathematics scores \"by far\" over any city participating in the evaluation. According to Harris, she designed a system with no oversight in which schools that do poorly can continue to enroll students.\n\nRamesh Ponnuru of \"National Review\" argued that Harris overstates the failure of charter schools in Detroit. According to Ponnuru, the study referenced by Harris, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, did \"not sound nearly as helpful to Harris's case as he suggests\". Ponnuru pointed out that the study says \"some 47 percent of charter schools in Detroit significantly outperform[ed] traditional public schools in reading and 49 percent of charters significantly outperforming traditionals on math. Only one percent of charters were significantly outperformed by traditional public schools in reading and only 7 percent on math.\" Also defending DeVos's record in Michigan, Jay P. Greene, professor of education policy at the University of Arkansas, argued that Harris's \"The New York Times\" article misled readers on the evidence and \"falsely claimed that Detroit has failed to close failing charter schools\", noting that Detroit has closed more charters than Louisiana, a state Harris cites as a model for charter school legislation.\n\nIn a written response to a question about charter school performance posed during DeVos's confirmation hearing by Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), asking \"why do you think their performance is so poor?\", DeVos defended the charter school system using graduation rates that were significantly higher than those used for state and federal accountability purposes. DeVos provided examples of several charter schools that she said had 4-year graduation exceeding 90%. These examples were contested by Columbia University professor Aaron Pallas and \"Education Week\" reporter Ben Herold on the basis that the actual graduation rates were roughly only half as large as DeVos had stated.\n\nDeVos and Joel Klein said in a May 2013 op-ed that residents of Maine \"are now given information on school performance using easy-to-understand report cards with the same A, B, C, D and F designations used in student grades\". This system, they argued, \"truly motivates parents and the community to get involved by simply taking information that education officials have had for years and presenting it in a way that is more easily understood.\"\n\nThe DeVoses have also established an annual scholarship, called the Betsy and Dick DeVos Scholars for Free Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Scholarship, which is awarded to students earning a BBA or combined BBA/MBA at Northwood University.\n\nDeVos is a former member of the board of the Foundation for Excellence in Education (ExcelinEd), a think tank founded by Jeb Bush whose stated goal is to \"build an American education system that equips every child to achieve his or her God-given potential\".\n\nIn February 2017, artist Glenn McCoy created a political cartoon called \"Trying to Trash Betsy DeVos\", based on Norman Rockwell's \"The Problem We All Live With\".\n\nDeVos has been played by Kate McKinnon on \"Saturday Night Live\" multiple times, including satirizing DeVos' \"60 Minutes\" interview in March 2018. That same month, Randy Rainbow created a satirical \"interview\" with DeVos based off the \"60 Minutes\" interview, with \"Out\" stating, \"It goes about as well as you'd expect it to.\"\n\nDeVos was depicted by drag queen Scarlet Envy on the March 21, 2019 episode of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" season 11 titled \".\" Scarlet Envy depicted DeVos as \"silly\" and \"martini-swilling.\"\n\nThe DeVos family is one of Michigan's wealthiest. Betsy DeVos's husband, Richard Marvin \"Dick\" DeVos Jr., is a multi-billionaire heir to the Amway fortune who ran Amway's parent company, Alticor, from 1993 to 2002. Dick DeVos is a major donor to conservative political campaigns and social causes, and was the 2006 Republican nominee for Governor of Michigan. They married in 1979, and have four grown children: Rick, Elissa, Andrea, and Ryan. Rick works for the Windquest Group as a consultant on urban development, and is the founder of Grand Rapids' ArtPrize festival. Dick's father, Richard Marvin DeVos Sr., co-founded Amway and was the owner of the Orlando Magic NBA basketball team. Richard DeVos was listed by \"Forbes\" in 2016 as having a net worth of $5.1 billion, making him America's 88th wealthiest individual.\n\nBetsy DeVos's brother, Erik Prince, a former U.S. Navy SEAL officer, is the founder of Blackwater USA, a private military services contractor.\n\nIn August 2018, a vandal untied DeVos's $40 million yacht that had been moored at a marina on Lake Erie, causing it to sustain $10,000 in damages. The vessel is one of ten yachts owned by her family, which has a net worth of $5.3 billion. The craft is registered in the Cayman Islands, so is not subject to state property tax.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2235737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2235737", "title": "P73", "text": "P73\n\np73 is a protein related to the p53 tumor protein. Because of its structural resemblance to p53, it has also been considered a tumor suppressor. It is involved in cell cycle regulation, and induction of apoptosis. Like p53, p73 is characterized by the presence of different isoforms of the protein. This is explained by splice variants, and an alternative promoter in the DNA sequence.\n\np73, also known as tumor protein 73 (TP73), protein was the first identified homologue of the tumor suppressor gene, p53. Like p53, p73 has several variants. It is expressed as distinct forms differing at either at the C- or the N-terminus. Currently, six different C-terminus splicing variants have been found in normal cells. The p73 gene encodes a protein with a significant sequence homology and a functional similarity with the tumor suppressor p53. The over-expression of p73 in cultured cells promotes a growth arrest and/or apoptosis similarly to p53.\n\nThe p73 gene has been mapped to a chromosome region (1p36. 2-3) a locus commonly deleted in various tumor entities and human cancers. Similar to p53 the protein product of p73 induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, hence its classification as a tumor suppressor. However unlike its counterpart, p73 is infrequently mutated in cancers. Perhaps, even more shocking is the fact that p73 – deficient mice do not show a tumorigenic phenotype. A deficiency of p53 almost certainly leads to unchecked cell proliferation and is noted in 60% of cancers. \n\nAnalyses of many tumors typically found in humans including breast and ovarian cancer show a high expression of p73 when compared to normal tissues in corresponding areas. Adenoviruses that cause cellular transformations have also been found to result in increased p73 expression. Furthermore, recent finding are suggesting that over-expression of transcription factors involved in cell cycle regulation and synthesis of DNA in mammalian cells (e.g.: E2F-1) induces the expression of p73. Many researchers believe that these results imply that p73 may not be a tumor suppressor but rather an oncoprotein. Some suggest that the TP73 locus encodes both a tumor suppressor (TAp73) and a putative oncogene (ΔNp73). This is a strong theory and causes much confusion, as it is unknown which of the two p73 variants is over-expressed and ultimately plays a role in tumorigenesis.\n\nGenes of the p53 family are known to be complex. The viral oncoproteins (e.g. Adenovirus E1B) that efficiently inhibit p53 function are unable to inactivate p73, and those that seem to inhibit p73 have no effect on p53.\n\nDebate persists about the exact function of p73. Recently it has been reported that p73 is enriched in the nervous system and that the p73-deficient mice, which do not exhibit an increased susceptibility to spontaneous tumorigenesis, have neurological and immunological defects. These results have been expanded and it has also been shown that p73 is present in early stages of neurological development and neuronal apoptosis by blocking the proapoptotic function of p53.

{"id": "2235752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2235752", "title": "Die Another Day (song)", "text": "Die Another Day (song)\n\n\"Die Another Day\" is the theme song from the James Bond film of the same name by American singer and songwriter Madonna. The song initially leaked onto the internet in early October 2002 prior to the official release, prompting radio to play the track. It was released commercially as a single on October 22 by Maverick Records. The single also made an appearance on her greatest hits compilation, \"Celebration\" (2009). Following the release of the previous Bond single, \"The World Is Not Enough\", MGM wanted a high-profile artist for the theme of \"Die Another Day\", and Madonna was their choice. She wrote and produced the song with Mirwais Ahmadzaï while French composer Michel Colombier was enlisted as composer.\n\nWhile developing, the track went through numerous changes. After Madonna saw the initial version of the film she adapted the song to its theme, described as a metaphor for destroying one's ego. Ahmadzaï re-arranged \"Die Another Day\" at his home in Paris while Colombier finished the string sections in Los Angeles. An electroclash number, \"Die Another Day\" is a mixture of strings and interpolating electronic swirls, and stuttered editing on Madonna's voice, cutting the main signal on the chorus.\n\n\"Die Another Day\" received mixed responses from music critics; one group of reviewers favored its departure from traditional Bond soundtracks, while others panned its production and called it uninteresting. It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and two Grammy Awards for Best Dance Recording and Best Short Form Music Video. The song was a commercial success, peaking at number eight on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and was the top selling dance song in the US for both 2002 and 2003. \"Die Another Day\" reached the top of the charts in Canada, Italy, Romania and Spain and top-ten in a number of countries worldwide.\n\nThe music video was directed by Traktor, and was developed as an independent video from the film but contained Bond influences. It depicts Madonna as a prisoner in a torture chamber, alternating with scenes of a fencing duel between good (clad in white) and evil (clad in black) personas of the singer. Wounds inflicted on both fencers are mirrored on the imprisoned Madonna, and in the end she escapes being electrocuted in the chamber. The usage of Jewish religious texts and objects in the music video led to controversy, with scholars of Judaism deeming it sacrilegious. Madonna has included the song on two of her world tours; the first being the 2004 Re-Invention World Tour and again as a video interlude on the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour.\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks, Madonna was in an introspective mood and started writing songs for her next studio album, \"American Life\", with producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Recording started in late 2001 but was put on hold as Madonna shot for her film \"Swept Away\" in Malta, and also starred in the West End play \"Up For Grabs\". In the meantime, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) was filming the twentieth James Bond film, \"Die Another Day\", directed by Lee Tamahori. The previous film in the franchise, \"The World Is Not Enough\" (1999) was a box office success earning US$362 million worldwide. However, the eponymous soundtrack single by alternative rock group Garbage failed to gain commercial success in the United States. The music management at MGM went to look for a high-profile artist to write and perform the title song for \"Die Another Day\".\n\nMadonna was their first choice, since she had been successful with soundtrack singles in the US, most recently with \"Beautiful Stranger\" (1999) from \"\" which was a top-twenty hit and earned her a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media. Anita Camrata, executive vice president of MGM Music explained the choice in 2002: \"With every other artist, you're taking a chance. But with Madonna, she has an extraordinary track record. She has written songs for films before and they were always perfect.\" By mid-February 2002 sources from the film set revealed that negotiations were under process for Madonna to sing the title song and make a cameo appearance in \"Die Another Day\". The song deal was confirmed in mid-March with journalists reporting a complex contract which might have cost MGM around one million dollars, including Madonna's fees for music and acting, promotion, the single release and the music video. \"Die Another Day\" was officially released in United States on October 22, 2002. It was supposed to be released on October 10, but got leaked a week prior to that to the radio stations. Website Hollywood.com reported that \"Madonna and members of her camp were beside themselves when the song—which they claim wasn't even finished—aired on a pop station in New York City.\"\n\nAccording to MTV News, work began on the song following the announcement, with French composer Michel Colombier being confirmed as the strings conductor. Colombier had worked with Madonna and Ahmadzaï on her single \"Don't Tell Me\" from \"Music\". Madonna and Ahmadzaï went through their demo tracks for \"American Life\" and zeroed on one of the songs for the film. They sent the demo to MGM describing it as \"this techno thing, an electronica piece rewritten to accommodate the film and the title\". According to Colombier, the studio responded positively to the demo but wanted them to change it so that it blended with traditional James Bond music in some way.\n\nThe track went through various interpolations, according to executive producer of the film, Michael G. Wilson. Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg had initially confirmed that the title of the song might not be same as the film, however Wilson explained that when the singer \"saw the rough [film] we were going to use, she sort of adapted the song and changed the title to 'Die Another Day'.\" Tamahori was concerned with the demo since it did not appear expressive to him and there were abrupt endings. However he was satisfied when Madonna re-wrote the chorus to make it suitable for the film. The writing process was explained by Madonna:\n\nI hemmed and hawed about it for a while because just for that reason though. Everybody wants to do the theme song of a James Bond movie, and I never liked to do what everybody else likes to do. It's just some perverse thing in me, right? So, but then I thought about it and I said, you know what? James Bond needs to get – needs to get techno so...\n\nUsed in the opening sequence, \"Die Another Day\" was played 13 minutes into the film, where Bond is shown imprisoned and being tortured for over a year in a prison camp in Korea. Being a departure from the normal title sequence of the previous Bond films, Madonna faced difficulty in making the song blend with the theme of \"Die Another Day\". Nevertheless, she understood the idea behind the opening scenes and tweaked the song accordingly. Some of the lyrics like \"I'm gonna destroy my ego ... Sigmund Freud ... Analyze this\" were derived from Madonna's interpretation of the film's storyline. She told an interviewer from \"Genre\" magazine that the lyrics were about \"destroying your ego, and it's juxtaposing the metaphor of, you know, the fight against good and bad, and it's set inside the whole universe of Bond\". \"Die Another Day\" was never adapted into the main score of the film. The song was later added to the track list of \"American Life\" and was also featured on her third greatest hits album, \"Celebration\" (2009).\n\nOnce the song structure was finished, MGM sent Colombier in Los Angeles a rough edit of the opening sequence of the film, while Ahmadzaï sent him a longer version of the demo. Colombier had to create something inline the film score with \"Die Another Day\". He added some more lyrics and then went to London to conduct an ensemble of 60 string players at AIR Lyndhurst Studios. Ahmadzaï, who was already mixing and recording the other tracks for \"American Life\", explained that the process \"was often laborious but with a less-is-more philosophy that is reflected in the music's sparse arrangements.\" They wanted minimalist production for the song, but at the same time make them sound \"futuristic\".\nAfter the orchestra sections were done, Ahmadzaï took the track back to his home in Paris and did a complete re-arrangement. String engineer Geoff Foster recalled that Madonna wanted something \"big and brass\" which Ahmadzaï denied, since Madonna had already done that with her 1998 single, \"Frozen\". Colombier explained that the final version was not the way he had structured the song, it was according to Ahmadzaï's mixing and ideas. \"He's a master manipulator. Sixty real strings, played live, became audio files in his computer. They can be chopped like real pieces of fabric. He's amazingly brilliant with that,\" concluded Colombier. Madonna attended the recording sessions at Olympic Studios in London. There was a tango section in the song which Colombier recalled was composed perfectly during rehearsals. But during the actual recording it did not work out as expected, prompting Madonna to grab the talkback mic and telling the crew, \"It's not sexy enough, think about sex!\"\n\n\"Die Another Day\" is an electroclash number, starting with strings which continues for eleven seconds, when Madonna's vocals starts with the lines \"I'm gonna keep this secret / I'm gonna close my body now...\" It follows with the stuttered editing on her voice, which keeps cutting the main signal, especially on the chorus \"I guess.. I would die... another day\". The strings again gain prominence at around the 2:20 mark. During the intermediate verse, a \"raucous\" laugh by Madonna can be heard. The song ends with interpolating electronic swirls and the orchestra fading out. Sterling Clover from \"The Village Voice\" explained that the ending recalled the snare drums and bass usage in songs of the microhouse genre, describing it as \"cacophony of harmonic fragments\". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, the song is set in the time signature of common time with a fast tempo of 130 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major with Madonna's voice spanning from the notes B to D.\n\nThe song received mixed reviews from music critics. Author Lucy O'Brien wrote in her biography, \"\", that the techno composition and the stuttering vocals made it \"an almost anti-Bond theme\". James Hannaham from \"Spin\" was positive in his review, writing that it is a \"brilliant, melodramatic song, that sounds like a stoic response to a world gone mad.\" Writing for Yahoo! Music, Dan Gennoe felt that since the songs in \"American Life\" mostly gave prominence to style over substance, \"Die Another Day\" as a result had become one-dimensional. Stylus Magazine's Ed Howard described the song as \"a great slice-and-dice hit of fucked-up electroclash\", in an otherwise negative review for \"American Life\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine considered it \"forward-thinking\" and believed that the record was added to \"American Life\"s track list to ensure that the album would not be devoid of a hit song. In August 2018, the same author placed it at number 51 on his raking of the singer's singles, calling it \"innovative, frustratingly anticlimactic —the aural equivalent of edging— and, perhaps fittingly, the last in Madonna’s long string of soundtrack hits\". Clover described the track as \"A blistering zeitgeist-negation, hostile and uneasy—as a single, a club track, a Bond theme.\" Chuck Taylor from \"Billboard\" was positive in his response, saying that the electronic effects rendered Madonna's vocals as non-discernible but the composition was forward thinking from \"Music\" (2000), her eighth studio album. Medium's Richard LaBeau panned the track as \"overproduced and lyrically nonsensical [...] it assuredly ranks toward the bottom of any list of Bond themes and Madonna singles\".\n\nIn his book \"Madonna: The Complete Guide to Her Music\", author Rikky Rooksby described it as \"melodically uninteresting and harmonically repetitious\". He felt that the stuttered editing by Ahmadzai did not allow the song to gain its full potential but complimented the strings and the chords. Rooksby concluded by saying that \"Die Another Day\" reveals much about the decline in songwriting quality from the early Bond songs and was not much of an improvement over \"The World Is Not Enough\"; he said that the Sigmund Freud line was the \"wittiest line\" on the whole of \"American Life\" album. Writing for \"The A.V. Club\", Stephen Thompson called the track \"pneumatic\" and \"hook-deficient\". Ken Tucker from \"Entertainment Weekly\" criticized the song as a \"flat James Bond tune\" adding that it failed to become a \"Madonna classic\". Both Manohla Dargis from \"Los Angeles Times\" and Joe Morgenstern from \"The Wall Street Journal\" panned the song calling it \"dumb\". \"Variety\"s Todd McCarthy called the song \"banal\". Also negative was \"The Guardian\"s Jude Rogers, who wrote that \"the 2002 Bond theme aimed for a sound of icy, imperial tyranny. Instead, its cut-up electronics sounded half-dead\". A. O. Scott from \"The New York Times\" described Madonna's vocals as \"electronically enhanced chirps\" while reviewing \"Die Another Day\".\n\nThe song was nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Original Song, but lost to U2's \"The Hands That Built America\" from \"Gangs of New York\". At the 46th Grammy Awards, it was nominated in the categories of Best Dance Recording and Best Short Form Music Video, but lost both awards; the former to Kylie Minogue's \"Come into My World\" and the latter to Johnny Cash's \"Hurt\". \"Die Another Day\" was also nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song of 2002 while Madonna herself won the trophy of Worst Supporting Actress for her cameo in the film. In a 2006 MORI poll for the Channel 4 TV show \"James Bond's Greatest Hits\", the song was voted the ninth best out of 22, but also came in as an \"overwhelming number one\" favorite among those under the age of 24. Rock music critic Neil McCormick from \"The Daily Telegraph\" named it the fifth best James Bond theme song, describing \"Die Another Day\" as an electro R&B workout which was \"expressively weird, brutally modern, satisfyingly original and evocative of the dark heart of Bond. Plus, Madonna actually looks as if she might be a match for Bond in either bed or battlefield. Or both.\" \"Rolling Stone\" listed it as the seventh best Bond song in the magazine's 2012 list of \"The top 10 James Bond Theme Songs\".\n\nAfter its release to radio in United States, \"Die Another Day\" started receiving strong airplay at the major US radio stations, having been spun for more than 100 times. The song garnered 35 million audience impressions in its first week, debuting at number 41 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, the highest debut of the year. It also debuted at number 19 on the Mainstream Top 40, number 40 on the Adult Top 40 and number 42 on the Hot 100 Airplay charts. The next week the song continued its ascent up the airplay charts, while reaching number 28 on the Hot 100 and becoming the \"breakout\" track on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The release of the CD single on October 22, 2002, prompted the song to jump from position 18 to number eight on the Hot 100, thus becoming Madonna's 35th top-ten single on the chart. This feat put her ahead of The Beatles' 34 top-ten hits and one behind tying Elvis Presley's record as the artist with the most top-ten singles on the Hot 100. The move was spurred by sales of 28,500 units of the CD which also put it on the top of Hot 100 Singles, becoming her third number one on the chart.\n\n\"Die Another Day\" was the highest charting James Bond song in the US since Duran Duran's number-one single, \"A View to Kill\" (1985). It was also Madonna's highest charting song since \"Don't Tell Me\" peaked at number four in February 2001, and was her 44th top-forty single—the most for any artist—breaking the tie with Aretha Franklin's 43 entries. The single spent 11 weeks at number one on Hot 100 Singles, becoming her most successful entry on that chart. \"Die Another Day\" became the best selling dance single of both 2002 and 2003 and the fifth best-selling dance single of the 2000s decade in the US. Additionally, \"Billboard\" also declared \"Die Another Day\" as Madonna's 33rd most successful single on the Hot 100. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the song has sold 184,000 digital downloads as of April 2010, making it one of her best selling titles released before 2005, the year when downloads began contributing into calculating the ranks on \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nIn Canada, the song debuted at number 25 on the Canadian Singles Chart, and ultimately reached the top, staying there for four weeks. The song was certified double platinum by the Music Canada (MC) for shipment of 200,000 copies. In Australia, the song debuted and peaked at number five on the Australian Singles Chart, staying for a total of 19 weeks and obtaining a gold from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 35,000 copies of the single. It was less successful in New Zealand, where it debuted and peaked at number 22 on the RIANZ Singles Chart, staying for a total of three weeks.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Die Another Day\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number three on November 3, 2002, being kept from the top spot by DJ Sammy's remix of Bryan Adams' 1985 single, \"Heaven\", and the song \"Dilemma\" by rapper Nelly featuring Kelly Rowland. Next week the song dropped to number 12, and continued its descent ultimately staying for a total of 16 weeks on the chart. In September 2015, the song was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for selling over 200,000 copies. It was listed as the 80th best selling single of 2002 in UK. The single was successful in Europe, reaching the top-ten of the charts in Austria, Belgium (both Flanders and Wallonia), Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, while topping the charts in Italy and Spain. In France the song achieved silver certification from the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP) for shipping 125,000 copies of the single. Across the pan-European Hot 100 Singles, the song debuted and peaked at number three.\n\nThe music video was directed by Traktor, a Swedish directing team known for several TV advertisements. It was filmed from August 22–27, 2002 at Hollywood Center Studios in Hollywood, California. The total production costs for the video was around $6.1 million ($ million in dollars), making it the second most expensive music video ever made, after \"Scream\" by Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson. In an interview with Norwegian newspaper \"Dagbladet\", Ole Sanders from Traktor recalled that in May 2002 Madonna sent them a handwritten letter, along with a demo version of \"Die Another Day\". The team was in Prague, shooting a music video for The Prodigy. \"We thought it was a joke, since the letter was long and handwritten. But the song sounded suspiciously like her,\" Sanders explained. He was then asked to go to Pinewood Studios in London to watch a half-finished version of the Bond film with producer Barbara Broccoli. Later, Sanders and one of his colleagues invited Madonna to their London home to discuss the video. By summer 2002, he had compiled the idea for the video with Madonna's inputs in it:\n\nWe received daily e-mails with feedback that was concise, unambiguous and occasionally entertaining. She works extremely hard with gumption and detail, and it was clear to us how she has remained on top for twenty years. It was no use being unprepared with vague ideas disguised as creativity, and there was no place to hide... First it felt like doing nonsense, then it's fun and it's something that's going to be seen. The project brings us into contact with interesting actors within both film and music.\nThe video was developed as an independent Madonna clip devoid of any footage from the Bond film, but was still Bond-inspired. It portrayed Madonna in a torture chamber as a prisoner and also fight sequences where the singer duels with herself. Post-production and visual effects for the video was done by London's Moving Picture Company (MPC). They created \"invisible\" effects for the fighting sequences, allowing Madonna to shoot two characters. Traktor explained that every shot of the video used some visual effects, co-ordinated by the group's lead artist, Christophe Allender. The directors did not want to use too many shots for the dueling scenes, which they believed would have restricted their creative freedom. Additional post-production effects included composing the fight sequence as a cohesive theme, adding blood to the wounds inflicted on Madonna, and adding digital stills of windows against the greenscreen where the shots were taken. The final shot showed the characteristic gun barrel sequence from the Bond films. MPC artist Ziggy Zigouras used a 2K resolution shot and tailored it according to Traktor's specifications. Finally, instead of grading the film print, MPC used the negatives to achieve crisper and cleaner images.\n\nThe premiere of the video took place on MTV channels worldwide on October 10, 2002, a first occurrence in the music channel's history. The music video was included in the enhanced CD of the single, along with the \"Making of the video\". In 2009, the video was included on Madonna's compilation, \"\".\n\nThe music video begins with a bruised Madonna being dragged by two soldiers through a dark corridor, and thrown against a chair in a torture chamber. She starts singing the first verse of the song as her captors laugh at her. An alternate scene shows two people fencing inside a white lit chamber, one in black cloths and one in white. Madonna continues groping with the different objects in the torture chamber and dancing. As she repeats the words \"Sigmund Freud\", the soldiers catch her again and douse her head in icy-water.\n\nThe two people fencing take off their masks, which reveal them to be Madonna and her doppelgänger surprised to see each other; they resume their violent fighting. The black Madonna slices across the white Madonna's stomach, which is mirrored in the imprisoned Madonna's stomach in the chamber. She rides on a hanging chain from the ceiling and smashes a mirror across the wall. The black Madonna breaks open a dark room by throwing the white Madonna against the wall. Different artifacts from the Bond films are present in the room and the two Madonna's fight through them. Meanwhile, the Madonna in the torture chamber wears phylacteries around her arm while hiding behind an electric chair.\n\nAs the breakdown happens, the soldiers bind her on the chair but she laughs, kicks and spits on them. Midst the aggressive fighting, the white Madonna takes a speargun and shoots the black Madonna squarely on the chest. The black Madonna falls down and concurrently a soldier pulls the switch on the electric chair. They laugh loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears, they see that no remnants are to be found. They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters (לאו) being burnt in the chair. They scratch their head and see a vision of a bearded man laughing at them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.\n\nAccording to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández, the video employed an identity-splitting strategy in which the two Madonnas fight each other. With this she was referencing her previous videos where such tactics have been employed, like the one for \"Music\", \"Papa Don't Preach\" and \"Human Nature\". Joanna Rydzewska, one of the authors of the book \"Representing Gender In Cultures\" analyzed that the violent imagery in the video was Madonna's way of portraying the violence she had faced during her \"tumultuous\" marriage with actor Sean Penn; she added that the video was a contrast to the \"tremendously independent artist she is\". The end of the video sparked discussion about the words imprinted on the electric chair, a phrase that can be interpreted as \"great escape\" or \"freedom\". According to \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", some scholars of Judaism were riled by the Jewish religious texts and objects appearing in the video. One of Madonna's Kabbalah advisors, Michael Berg, explained that \"Hebrew letters Madonna displays, lamed, aleph, vov—roughly equivalent to L, A, V—form one of the 72 names of God and denote a diminishing of the ego to connect with joy and fulfillment.\" According to him, donning tefillin represented \"diminution of the desire to receive and a strengthening of the desire to share. But for a woman to don tefillin is still not a common practice, and for a gentile to wear tefillin might be regarded by some Jews as sacrilege.\"\n\nIn 2004, the singer was to visit Israel regarding her Kabbalah practice. However, ultra-orthodox Jews protested her trip, saying that Madonna disgraced the religion with her portrayal of wearing phylacteries/tefillin over her arm—a Jewish custom usually reserved for men—in the music video. Israeli securities had advised the singer not to make the trip, but the singer continued her visit to the graves of Jewish sages as well as shrines such as Rachel's Tomb on the edge of Bethlehem, traditional burial place of the biblical matriarch Rachel. \"Die Another Day\" was nominated for Best Video from a Film at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost. It won the \"Soundtrack Video of the Year\" trophy at the 2003 MVPA Awards.\n\nInitial reports by \"The Observer\" suggested that Madonna would perform \"Die Another Day\" in front of Queen Elizabeth II at the premiere of the film in London's Royal Albert Hall, but it did not happen. It was not until two years later that she first performed \"Die Another Day\", as part of her 2004 Re-Invention World Tour. The song was to be included as the final performance in the set list, but \"Holiday\" was chosen instead and \"Die Another Day\" was included in the third segment of the show. Wearing a circus-themed corset designed by Chanel, she and her dancers performed a Tango-like choreography to the song, while backdrops displayed an old man in his deathbed. The performance was received favorably by Joan Anderman of \"The Boston Globe\", who explained that \"the abstract ballroom choreography of 'Die Another Day' was an elegant antidote to the rote gyrations favored by the next generation of pop stars.\" Towards the end of the performance, Madonna's dancers tied the singer on an electric chair and as it was raised high above the stage, she started singing \"Lament\" from \"Evita\". The performance of \"Die Another Day\" was included on Madonna's documentary live album \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\" (2006), which chronicled the tour.\n\nFour years later, \"Die Another Day\" was added to the set list of the 2008-09 Sticky & Sweet Tour, where it was used as a video interlude. It featured Madonna as a boxer on screen, while two of her dancers performed a faux boxing match. The video also showed Madonna in a technical knockout match, spraying her blood across the screen. Madonna's DJ Enferno remixed the song and the performance ended with the singer falling down on the ground in the video, as she emerged from beneath the stage while jump-roping. Paul Schrodt from Slant Magazine felt that the video emphasized the singer's \"already-muscular arms\", adding that \"[u]nlike your run-of-the-mill diva, Madonna is willing to get dirty for her art, and she sometimes gets lost in her backup dancers' routine, though she's quick to remind the audience, 'I'm still the one in control'\". Ben Kaplan from Canada.com noted that \"Die Another Day\", along with the performances of \"4 Minutes\" and \"La Isla Bonita\" are re-imagined as \"parts of larger medleys, with Madonna giving shout-outs to techno, flamenco and old-school R&B influences\". This performance was included on the \"Sticky & Sweet Tour\" live CD and DVD release, recorded during Madonna's shows in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in December 2008.\n\nOn July 26, 2012, while on The MDNA Tour, Madonna performed an exclusive club date at L'Olympia in Paris for only 2,700 fans and mixed \"Die Another Day\" with the song \"Beautiful Killer\" from her twelfth studio album \"MDNA\". After finishing the performance of \"Human Nature\", Madonna wears a coat and as the opening music of \"Die Another Day\" starts, she wields a gun and launches into \"Beautiful Killer\". Excerpts of films by French actor Alain Delon—the main inspiration behind \"Beautiful Killer\"—were shown in the back drops.\n\n\n\n\nCredits for \"Die Another Day\" are adapted from \"American Life\" and the single liner notes.\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Digital\n\n"}

She began her writing career as a way to supplement income for several newspapers, creating Memín Penguín in 1943. By 1960, she has successfully published a number of comic books, encouraging her husband, Guillermo de la Parra, to write as well. The two went on to create various successful telenovelas including Rubí, which has been redone for both television and film. In total Varga Dulché published over sixty titles in both Mexico and abroad.\n\nVargas Dulché was born to poor parents Armando Vargas de la Maza and Josefina Dulché in Mexico City along with one sister, Elba. The family's unstable economic situation meant that the family moved frequently, causing the girls to change schools. However, this brought Yolanda into contact with various elements of Mexican society, which would influence the creation of her literary characters later. These frequent moves included a stay in the United States with her sister for a short time before moving back to Mexico City permanently.\n\nTo make ends meet, Vargas Dulché worked at several jobs. She collaborated with Emilio Azcárraga Vidaurreta on radio station XEW-AM singing songs by Agustín Lara, Pedro Vargas and Toña la Negra and then forming a duet with her sister called \"Rubia y Morena\" which sang with Agustín Lara. Her career as a writer began to supplement income from singing.\n\nWhile working as a writer she met her husband Guillermo de la Parra with whom she had five children including actress Emoé de la Parra and Manelick de la Parra. She also has eleven grandchildren which include singers/actor Mané de la Parra and musician Alondra de la Parra.\n\nWith her husband she had success as a writer, comic book illustrator and producer of telenovelas and films. With her own money, she constructed an entire town in the state of Durango, homes, schools, etc., which still exists. She also created a chain of hotels in Mexico.\n\nShe died on August 8, 1999, after finishing a short autobiography called Aroma del tiempo.\n\nDuring her career she was a singer, journalist, mother and businesswoman, but she is best known for her comic book work, especially Memín Penguín, and the writing and producing of telenovelas from the 1940s to the 1990s. She began her writing career as a way to supplement income from singing, beginning with the ESTO newspaper and Editorial Argumentos. She then began writing essays and stories for the El Pepín magazine, where she first created a black character in the 1940s which would develop into Memín Pinguín. The name was derived from her then boyfriends nickname of Pingo. She also wrote for Novedades de México. She then was hired by the Chamaco publication for three times what she was making before. However, because of personal conflict with her boss, she saved her money and when she could, left the publication to create her own company but this failed.\n\nDespite the failure she had published over a dozen profitable comic books by 1960. Her success encouraged her husband to write, creating his first success called Rarotonga. Their combined success provided sufficient income to found Grupo Editorial Vid and begin to produce telenovelas and films with their major productions being \"Cinco rostros de mujer,\" \"María Isabel,\" \"Yesenía,\", \"Rubí,\" \"Ladronzuela\" and Gabriel y Gabriela.\"\n\nHer comic book writing style is considered to be unique and was popular in Mexico for over forty years, especially with the lower classes. At the height of her popularity she was the most read woman in Mexico, after only Corín Tellado in the Spanish language in general, with her comics selling 25 million copies a month. She had over sixty works published in Mexico as well as Indonesia, China, Japan, Italy, Colombia, the United States and the Philippines.\n\nShe is considered to be a pioneer in popular literature in Mexico, called the \"Queen of the comic books\" . Her work received various recognitions including that of the first Convención Nacional de Cómic y Ciencia Ficción of Mexico City. In 2006, the book \"La reina de la historietas de México\" was published by Mexican cinematographer David Ramón and published by the Sociedad General de Escritores de México. In 2012, the Museo de Arte Popular in collaboration with Editorial Vid and Televisa paid homage to Vargas Dulché with an exhibition of her work, especially how it appeared on film and television.\n\nHer major works include comics and screenplays for Mexican telenovelas, with some over her comic work crossing over into film and television. Her most important comic work is based on a character called Memín Pinguín, considered to be an icon of Mexican comic books. Created in 1943 the comic is about a black boy with exaggerated features who is a dreamer and a trickster but always does what is right. His name was inspired by her husband Guillermo de la Parra, who was called \"pingo\" by his colleagues because of his jokes. The character, which appears in film and radio along with comic books is an important part of modern Mexican popular culture still. In 1985, the Mexican ministry of education declared Memín Pinguín required reading in public schools because \"it promotes respect for the family and institutions in students.\" She began publishing other stories and comics in the 1950s. Other comic book characters include a series called El Pecado de Oyuki (Oyuki's Sin) based on a Japanese woman, and María Isabel, about a poor indigenous women who comes to the city with a little girl, who is not her daughter. María Isabel was played by actress Silvia Pinal for the film version.\n\nHer other major works were telenovelas, novels adapted into a series on television with a definite beginning and end. One of the most important of these include Rubí (1969), about a smart and beautiful woman whose main interests are money and power. A Mexican telenovela (2003) version of Rubí stars Bárbara Mori, Eduardo Santamarina, Jacqueline Bracamontes, Sebastián Rulli and Ana Martín, and a teleserye version of the story was created in the Philippines in 2010. Other successful radio novels and telenovelas include Cinco rostros de mujer (1947), Zorina (1949), Ladronzuela (1949) Yesenia (1970), Encrucijada (1970), El amor de María Isabel (1971), Gabriel y Gabriela (1982) and Alondra (1995) .\n"}

{"id": "2235798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2235798", "title": "Silver standard", "text": "Silver standard\n\nThe silver standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver. The silver specie standard was widespread from the fall of the Byzantine Empire until the 19th century. Following the discovery in the 16th century of large deposits of silver at the Cerro Rico in Potosí, Bolivia, an international silver standard came into existence in conjunction with the Spanish pieces of eight. These silver dollar coins played the role of an international trading currency for nearly four hundred years.\n\nIn 1704, following Queen Anne's proclamation, the British West Indies became one of the first regions to adopt a gold standard in conjunction with the Spanish gold doubloon coin. In 1717, the master of the Royal Mint, Sir Isaac Newton, introduced a new mint ratio as between silver and gold, and this had the effect of putting Britain onto a \"de facto\" gold standard. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the United Kingdom introduced the gold sovereign coin and formally adopted a gold standard in 1821. At the same time, revolutions in Latin America interrupted the supply of silver dollars (pieces of eight) that were being produced at the mints in Potosi, Mexico, and Lima, Peru. The British gold standard initially extended to some of the British colonies, including the Australasian and Southern African colonies, but not to its North American colonies, British India, or to Southeast Asia. The Province of Canada adopted a gold standard in 1853, as did Newfoundland in 1865. In 1873, Imperial Germany changed over to the gold standard in conjunction with the new gold mark coin. The United States changed over to gold \"de facto\" in the same year, and over the next 35 years, all other nations changed to gold, leaving only China and the British colonies of Hong Kong and Weihaiwei on the silver standard. The silver standard finally came to an end when it was abandoned by China and Hong Kong in 1935.\n\nSince the time that silver was discovered by the Spanish in the New World in the 16th century, until the latter half of the 19th century, the value of gold in relation to silver maintained a relatively stable ratio of 15½:1. The reason for the subsequent sharp decline in the relative value of silver to gold has been attributed to Germany's decision to cease minting the silver thaler coins in 1871. On 23 November 1871, following the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, Bismarck exacted one billion dollars in gold indemnity, and then proceeded to move Germany towards a new gold standard which came about on 9 July 1873 with the introduction of the gold mark.\n\nIt has also however been suggested by Nevada Senator John Percival Jones in 1876 in a speech to the US Senate, that the downward pressure on the market value of silver began somewhat earlier with the formation of the Latin Monetary Union in 1866. Jones argues that the Latin Monetary Union involved a partial demonetization of silver.\n\nSilver made a partial comeback in the first decade of the 20th century, such that the silver dollar coins of the Straits Settlements and silver peso coins of the Philippines had to be made smaller in size, and with a reduced silver content in order to prevent their silver value exceeding their recently established gold exchange value. An even larger rise in the price of silver after the First World War caused the Royal Mint in London to reduce the silver content of the sterling coinage. But silver never returned to the 15½:1 ratio of the first half of the 19th century, and the predominant long term trend was that silver continued to decline in value against gold. Nowadays the ratio in relation to the value of gold, although variable, is more of the order of 70:1.\n\nBeginning in 1515, silver coins were minted at the silver mines at Joachimsthal - Jáchymov (St. Joachim's Valley) in Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic. Although formally called \"Guldengroschen\", they became known as \"Joachimsthalers\", then shortened to \"thaler\".\nThe coins were widely circulated, and became the model for silver \"thalers\" issued by other European countries. The word thaler became \"dollar\" in the English language.\n\nChina had long used silver ingots as a medium of exchange, along with the cast copper-alloy cash. The use of silver ingots can be traced back as far as the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD). But prior to the Song dynasty (960–1279), those silver ingots were used mainly for hoarding wealth. During the Song dynasty, for the first time in history the government became the sole issuer of paper currency after 1024, but cast coins and silver ingots were still used as a medium of exchange. In the Shanyuan Treaty, signed with the state of Liao in 1004, Song China agreed to pay an annual indemnity or tribute of 100,000 tael of silver and 200,000 bolts of silk. This was the first time bulk silver in tael (Chinese: 銀兩) was used as indemnity in a treaty with a foreign power. Silver ingots had a shape similar to a boat or a Chinese shoe during the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). This became an ordinary shape for silver ingots during the following centuries.\n\nThe use of silver as money was established at the very time of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Paper money was first issued in 1375 by the founder Hongwu Emperor amid the ban of silver as medium of exchange. But due to the increasing depreciation, the paper money became basically worthless and the ban on silver usage was finally lifted in 1436 (1st year of the Zhengtong Emperor). Meanwhile, silver was made much available through foreign trade with the Portuguese and the Spanish, in the beginning of the 16th century. The great tax reform by the statesman Zhang Juzheng in 1581 (9th year of the Wanli Emperor) simplified the taxation and required all the tax and corvee to be paid in silver. This can be seen as an indication of the firm position of silver in the monetary system of the Ming. However the reform would not have been a success or even feasible if the enormous amounts of silver had not been available through trade and imports from the Americas, mainly through the Spanish.\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), silver ingots were still used, but various foreign silver dollars had become popular in the Southern coastal region through foreign trade since the mid-Qing era. It was apparent that the silver ingots became awkward and more complicated to use \"vis à vis\" the foreign silver dollars, which could be counted easily, given their fixed specification and fineness of silver. However, the Qing dynasty very much resisted the idea of minting a silver coin of their own. It was not until late Qing, in 1890, that the first circulating silver coin was introduced by Guangdong province. The coin was at par with the Mexican peso, and soon this issue was emulated by other provinces. For these silver coins, the tael was still seen as the proper monetary unit, as the denomination of the coins were given as 0.72 tael (specifically: 7 mace and 2 candareens). Note for the treaties signed between the Qing dynasty and the foreign powers the indemnities were all in tael of silver, except for the Treaty of Nanking, where the silver dollar was indicated. (See the Treaties of Tientsin, Convention of Beijing, Treaty of Shimonoseki and Boxer Protocol). It was not until 1910 that the \"yuan\" (Chinese: 圓, literally \"roundness\"), was officially announced as the standard monetary unit. The yuan was subdivided into 10 jiao or 100 fen, and specified as 0.72 tael of 900 fineness silver. The next year, 1911, the so-called \"Great Qing Silver Coin\" one yuan (dollar) was issued, but soon after the dynasty was replaced by the Republic.\n\nThe silver standard was again adopted and codified in 1914 by the newly established republic, with one yuan still being equal to 0.72 tael of 900 fineness silver. After the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) unified the country in 1928, the yuan was again announced as the standard unit in 1933, but this time the relationship of the yuan to the tael was abolished, as one yuan was now equal to 26.6971 grams of 880 fineness silver. In the same year, 1933, while most of the Western countries (especially Britain and USA) had left the gold standard because of the Great Depression, it was said that China almost avoided the depression entirely, mainly due to having stuck to the silver standard. However, the US silver purchase act of 1934 created an intolerable demand on China's silver coins, and so in the end the silver standard was officially abandoned in September 1935 in favor of the four Chinese national banks' \"legal note\" issues. China would be the last to abandon the silver standard, along with the British crown colony of Hong Kong.\n\nChina's use of silver as a medium of exchange is reflected in the name for bank \"銀行\" (literally \"silver house\" or \"silver office\") and for the precious metal and jewel dealer \"銀樓\" (literally \"silver building\" or \"silver shop\").\n\nAfter its victory in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), Germany extracted a huge indemnity from France of £200,000,000 in gold, and used it to join Britain on a gold standard. Germany's abandonment of the silver standard put further pressure on other countries to move to the gold standard.\n\nThe first metal used as a currency was silver, more than 4,000 years ago, when silver ingots were used in trade. During the heyday of the Athenian empire, the city's silver tetradrachm was the first coin to achieve \"international standard\" status in Mediterranean trade.\n\nRepublican China, along with the British colony of Hong Kong, would be the last to abandon the silver standard.\n\nIn October 1934, the National Government of Republic of China increased the silver-based export duty and adjusted the duty with an so-called \"equalization charge\", making the duty based on the foreign currencies. The Government later issued a new currency called fa-pi. These changes were responses to the deflation in China caused by the US Silver Purchase Program in 1933. The US purchase of silver in the International market increase the price of silver, causing an outflow of silver in China who based the economy on silver standard currency, which forces China to abandon the silver standard.\n\nHong Kong abandoned the silver standard in September 1935. Hong Kong then adopted the gold exchange standard and the Hong Kong dollar took on the exact value of one shilling and three pence (1s 3d) sterling.\n\nThe Indian rupee is derived from the \"Rūpaya\" (silver is called \"rūpa\" in Sanskrit) a silver coin introduced by Sher Shah Suri during his reign from 1540 to 1545. Since this is around about the same time that the Spanish discovered silver at the Cerro Rico in Potosí, the silver value of the rupee maintained a stable relationship with gold right up until the early 1870s. From 1871, the value of silver depreciated relative to gold, due to the drop in demand for silver in the mints of Europe and North America, as those countries changed over to the gold standard. This had severe consequences for the rupee and it resulted in the fall of the Rupee. Following the Fowler report, India adopted the gold exchange standard in the year 1898, fixing the value of the rupee at exactly one shilling and four pence (1s 4d) sterling.\n\nThe dirham was a silver coin originally minted by the Persians. The Caliphates in the Islamic world adopted these coins, starting with Caliph Abd al-Malik (685–705). Silver remained the most common monetary metal used in ordinary transactions until the 20th century.\n\nSafavid era\n\nGold coins were minted for the king, but these coins were more suitable for use and served as gifts on occasions, especially Nowruz. However, silver was a precious and high-quality currency for tax, cyber and commercial purposes. Silver coins were higher in comparison with many other countries. When the coin-masters of the coin melted the European coins or the crack, they were purified them before they were minted again in the form of Iranian currency.\n\nUsually the weight of the coins was correct, so that businessmen and government agents used both for a major payment of bags containing a certain number of coins. These bags have a guaranteed value of 50 Toman. A special observer, \"Sarrafbashi\", was in charge of the quality of coins inside the bags, which personally sealed them. This monitoring of money certainly survived until the end of the fourteenth century.\n\nFrom the beginning of the Islamic Empire, the dinar was a monetary unit. In the year 1260, the Mughal was presented with the Toman, which in the words meant 10 thousands.\n\nThe word was originally used to refer to 10,000 dinars of gold. However, after the year 1500, during the Safavid dynasty, Toman was a unit for calculation, not a gold coin. In practice, the value of the Toman fluctuated and was not always equal to 10,000 dinars. Also, the Toman of Tabriz or Iraq was often four times the value of the Toman of Khorasan.\n\nExports of metal money from Iran in the seventeenth century were followed by sea and land, and generally more exports included coins to bullion. Given that the tendency toward gold to keep its value historically longer than the West in relation to silver in India, it was often preferable to export to India, since at least until the 1080s of the lunar year in India, and in particular the Cromandal (south-east coast India) had a better rate. However, almost always silver was preferred to trade with the East, although it naturally depended on the prices of silver and commodities in India.\n\nIran's rulers repeatedly issued orders against coin exports, but since the merchants could easily escape the regulations by bribing the officers, their results were temporary. During the Safavid period, the first ban on the coin occurred in 1618 during the reign of Shah Abbas I.\n\nAfsharids\n\nWith the fall of the Safavid in 1723, their monetary policy continued to be maintained by Nader Shah, who maintained the same weight and purity for coinage between 1723 and 1741. In this year, instead of continuing to follow the pattern of the traditional Iranian criterion, he made a coin draw on India based on the pattern of India to simplify trade between the two countries.\n\nZand\n\nAlthough Karim Khan was known as the \"greatest ruler of Iran\" since 1764 with broad, independent or semi-autonomous sectors, there was no monetary unity in the country. The regional monetary system continued to work even when the national mint began to beat coins of equal weight and purity.\n\nQajar\n\nThe advent of the Qajar dynasty began in the late eighteenth century with the same Safavid monetary system. In short, in this system, the common currency was coins that were manually multiplied in the mint of all major cities and managed by privileged holders who paid royalties. The value of money was theoretically based on their precious metal content, which was guaranteed by the government.\n\nThe Qajar period's monetary system was likewise pre-disintegrated and decentralized. There were two types of Iraqi and Tabrizi Tomans (used most of Iran) plus Tuman Khorasani (used in Eastern Iran).\n\nPahlavi\n\nFollowing the fall of the value of silver in the late 1920s and the early 1930s, the Pahlavi government experienced a serious monetary crisis. The Pahlavi government first tried to redirect the gold standard by the March 28, 1930 law. But when faced with difficulties, the Qajars' short-term strategy was chosen; that is, to stay on the silver standard.\n\nThe law of March 13, 1932 stipulated that until the return to normal economic situation and the stability of the possibility of paying with gold or gold-based foreign currency suspended due to the economic crisis, the National Bank (Bank Melli Iran) was allowed to receive no silver coins or paper money in circulation which may be offered with a gold purchase (coin, bullion, or foreign currency). However, Bank Melli should pay Rial cash against paper money and nickel coins if there is a demand without limitation, for each coin in either Tehran or other provinces.\n\nAlthough the paper money was very important in the Reza Shah government, older attitudes were still expected. For example, the idea that the metal is the base of real money is found in this rule of law that the paper money is backed by gold or foreign currency.\n\nHowever, the passage to the new currency system was one of the achievements of Reza Shah's reign.\n\nRich deposits of silver in the Spanish colonies of the New World allowed Spain to mint great quantities of silver coins. The Spanish dollar was a Spanish coin, the \"real de a ocho\" and later peso, worth eight reals (hence the nickname \"pieces of eight\"), which was widely circulated during the 18th century.\n\nBy the American Revolution in 1775, Spanish dollars backed paper money authorized by the individual colonies and the Continental Congress. In addition to the American dollar, the 8-real coin became the basis for the Chinese yuan.\n\nGreat Britain's early use of the silver standard is still reflected in the name of its currency, the pound sterling, which traces its origins to the early Middle Ages (see Anglo-Saxon pound), when King Offa of Mercia introduced the silver penny, which copied the \"denarius\" of Charlemagne's Frankish Empire.\n\nThe early silver pennies were struck from fine silver (as pure as was available). However, in 1158, King Henry II introduced \"Tealby penny\". English currency was almost exclusively silver until 1344, when the gold noble was put into circulation. However, silver remained the legal basis for sterling until 1816.\n\nIn 1663, a new gold coinage was introduced based on the 22 carat fine guinea. Fixed in weight at to the troy pound from 1670, this coin's value varied considerably until 1717, when it was fixed at 21 shillings (21/-, 1.05 pounds). However, this valuation overvalued gold relative to silver compared to other European countries. British merchants sent silver abroad in payments while exports were paid for with gold. As a consequence, silver flowed out of the country and gold flowed in, leading to a situation where Great Britain was effectively on a gold standard. In 1816, the gold standard was adopted officially, with the silver standard reduced to 66 shillings (66/-, 3.3 pounds), rendering silver coins a \"token\" issue (i.e., not containing their value in precious metal).\n\nThe economic power of Great Britain was such that its adoption of a gold standard put pressure on other countries to follow suit.\n\nThe United States adopted a silver standard based on the Spanish milled dollar in 1785. This was codified in the 1792 Mint and Coinage Act, and by the federal government's use of the Bank of the United States to hold its reserves, as well as establishing a fixed ratio of gold to the US dollar. This was, in effect, a derivative silver standard, since the bank was not required to keep silver to back all of its currency. This began a long series of attempts for America to create a bimetallic standard for the US dollar, which would continue until the 1920s. Gold and silver coins were legal tender, including the Spanish real. Because of the huge debt taken on by the US federal government to finance the Revolutionary War, silver coins struck by the government left circulation, and in 1806 President Jefferson suspended the minting of silver coins.\n\nThe US Treasury was put on a strict hard money standard, doing business only in gold or silver coin as part of the Independent Treasury Act of 1846, which legally separated the accounts of the federal government from the banking system. However the fixed rate of gold to silver overvalued silver in relation to the demand for gold to trade or borrow from England. Following Gresham's law, silver poured into the US, which traded with other silver nations, and gold moved out. In 1853 the US reduced the silver weight of coins, to keep them in circulation, and in 1857 removed legal tender status from foreign coinage.\n\nIn 1857, the final crisis of the free banking era of international finance began, as American banks suspended payment in silver, rippling through the very young international financial system of central banks. In 1861 the US government suspended payment in gold and silver, effectively ending the attempts to form a silver standard basis for the dollar. Through the 1860–1871 period, various attempts to resurrect bi-metallic standards were made, including one based on the gold and silver franc; however, with the rapid influx of silver from new deposits, the expectation of scarcity of silver ended.\n\nThe combination that produced economic stability was restriction of supply of new notes, a government monopoly on the issuance of notes directly and indirectly, a central bank, and a single unit of value. As notes devalued, or silver ceased to circulate as a store of value, or there was a depression, governments demanding specie as payment drained the circulating medium out of the economy. At the same time there was a dramatically expanded need for credit, and large banks were being chartered in various states, including those in Japan by 1872. The need for stability in monetary affairs would produce a rapid acceptance of the gold standard in the period that followed.\n\nThe Coinage Act of 1873, enacted by the United States Congress in 1873, embraced the gold standard and de-monetized silver. Western mining interests and others who wanted silver in circulation labeled this measure the \"Crime of '73\". For about five years, gold was the only metallic standard in the United States until passage of the Bland–Allison Act on February 28, 1878, requiring the US Treasury to purchase domestic silver bullion to be minted into legal tender coins co-existent with gold coins. Silver Certificate Series 1878 was issued to join the gold certificates already in circulation.\n\nBy acts of Congress in 1933, including the Gold Reserve Act and the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the domestic economy was taken off the gold standard and placed on the silver standard for the first time. The Treasury Department was re-empowered to issue paper currency redeemable in silver dollars and bullion, thereby divorcing the \"domestic\" economy from bimetallism and leaving it on the silver standard, although \"international\" settlements were still in gold.\n\nThis meant that for every ounce of silver in the U.S. Treasury's vaults, the U.S. government could continue to issue money against it. These silver certificates were shredded upon redemption since the redeemed silver was no longer in the Treasury. With the world market price of silver having been in excess of $1.29 per troy ounce since 1960, silver began to flow out of the Treasury at an increasing rate. To slow the drain, President Kennedy ordered a halt to issuing $5 and $10 silver certificates in 1962. That left the $1 silver certificate as the only denomination being issued.\n\nOn June 4, 1963, Kennedy signed Public Law 88-36, which marked the beginning of the end for even the $1 silver certificate. The law authorized the Federal Reserve to issue $1 and $2 bills, and revoked the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, which authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue silver certificates (by now limited to the $1 denomination). Because it would be several months before the new $1 Federal Reserve Notes could enter circulation in quantity, there was a need to issue silver certificates in the interim. Because the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 granted the right to issue silver certificates to the president, Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110 to delegate that authority to the Treasury Secretary during the transition.\n\nSilver certificates continued to be issued until late 1963, when the $1 Federal Reserve Note was released into circulation. For several years, existing silver certificates could be redeemed for silver, but this practice was halted on June 24, 1968.\n\nFinally, President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would no longer redeem currency for gold or any other precious metal, forming the final step in abandoning the gold and silver standards. This announcement was part of the economic measures now known as the \"Nixon Shock\".\n\nDue to the monetary policy of the U.S. Federal Reserve, calls for a return to the gold standard have returned. Some states have chosen to use a loophole in the Federal Reserve Act that gives individual states the right to issue currencies of gold or silver coins or rounds. This was done because the Federal Reserve Act does not allow them to print their own currency if they wished. As of January 2012, Utah allowed the payment of debt to be settled in silver and gold, and the value of the American silver or gold rounds used was pegged to the price of the given precious metal. Payment in some cases can be requested to be made in silver or gold rounds. As of 2011, eleven other U.S. states were exploring their options to possibly make similar changes like Utah.\n"}

This company also operated the 'town clearing', where cheques cleared the same day between the 'town' bank branches in central London. Town clearing had been the forerunner of the CHAPS system, and was finally closed in 1995.\n\nWith the closure of the town clearing, the operating company was renamed to CHAPS Clearing Company Limited (informally CHAPS Co). Responsibility for the CHAPS system transferred from it to the Bank of England in November 2017. On 20 August 2018, the first non-bank institution, ipagoo LLP, joined the CHAPS scheme.\n\nA CHAPS transfer is initiated by the sender to move money to the recipient's account (at another banking institution), where the funds need to be available (cleared) the same working day. Unlike with a bank giro credit, no pre-printed slip specifying the details of the recipient is required. Unlike cheques, the transfer is performed in real time, removing the issue of float or the potential for payments to be purposely stopped by the sender or returned due to insufficient funds, even after they appear to have arrived in the destination account.\n\nCHAPS is used by twenty direct participants, including the Bank of England, and over 4,500 indirect participants (who process transactions via agency arrangements with direct participants). In its first year of operation, average daily transactions numbered 7,000, with a total annual value of £5 billion. In 2004, twenty years later, average daily transactions numbered 130,000, with an annual value of £300 billion. In 2010 there were 32 million CHAPS transactions, totalling over £61 trillion, down from £73 trillion in 2008.\n\nCHAPS used to offer euro fund transfers as a member of the EU-area settlement system TARGET, but this service closed on 16 May 2008. The total value of these in 2007 was £57 trillion.\n\nAs well as making transfers originated by banks themselves, CHAPS is frequently used by businesses for high-value payments to suppliers, by mortgage lenders issuing advances, and by solicitors and conveyancers on behalf of individuals buying houses.\n\nCHAPS transfers are relatively expensive, with banks typically charging as much as £35 for a transfer. The cost of fast transfers and the low speed of free transfers (such as BACS) was a subject of controversy in the UK, until immediate transactions became available from the Faster Payments service.\n\nProblems can arise from delays, such as when an exceptional workload at a bank results in the money being cleared too late in a working day to complete related transactions, or inadequate instructions, when a bank is not given sufficient information to know where to credit the money, or a human delay in operating the machines.\n\nAs of October 2019 the CHAPS participants are:\n\n\nCHAPS clearing information relating to UK banks may be found in the Industry Sorting Code Directory.\n\n\n"}

She broke into the sport in 1948 originally skating for a league called International Roller Speedway. Skating with the original Roller Derby, beginning in 1948, she would be named women's 'Captain' of her team within six months. Calvello, who often sported dyed hair and color-coordinated uniforms, was known for her temper. She was nicknamed \"Banana-Nose\" by legendary skater, Buddy Atkinson, Sr.. She traveled the world skating in Europe, Guam, Philippines, Cuba, Australia and all over the United States. She broke her nose 12 times during her career. Her most famous rival on the track was Joan Weston.\n\nAnn gave birth to a daughter, Teri Ann Langley-Conte, on August 11, 1953. She was a perennial Roller Derby All-Star and league MVP in 1963 skating with the Mexico City Cardenales. After skating with the rival Roller Games league for two years, she was inducted into the Roller Derby Hall of Fame when she returned to the original Derby in 1968.\n\nIn 2001, \"Demon of The Derby\", a biographical documentary film about Calvello, was completed by Fireproof Productions. It has been released on DVD, and is occasionally screened at fundraisers organized by roller derby leagues.\n\nThe primary investor in 'Demon of the Derby,' Gary Powers, a fan from Brooklyn, NY, would start 'Roller Derby Foundation,' in order to raise money to assist Calvello who was working in a grocery store and as a ticket taker for the SF Forty-Niners. Calling Powers her 'son,' Calvello would donate her vast collection of Roller Derby memorabilia to Powers, who reopened the National Roller Derby Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, Calvello contributed many rare photos and clippings from her personal collection to the book \"Roller Derby Classics…and more!\" by Jim Fitzpatrick, self-published via Trafford Publishing. She also wrote the foreword to the book.\n\nOn February 27, 2006, Calvello was featured in the reality television show \"Rollergirls\" that was broadcast on the A&E Network. In the episode, filmed in 2005, members of the TXRD Lonestar Rollergirls traveled to California in search of Cavello, their hero. TXRD has named their championship the Calvello Cup in her honor. Calvello also appeared in the season finale where the Rhinestone Cowgirls and the Holy Rollers battled for the championship.\n\nCalvello last resided in San Bruno, California with partner, Billy Prieto, and her cats.

While current sources or sinks are abstract elements used for analysis, generally they have physical counterparts in real-world applications; e.g. the anode or cathode in a battery. In all cases, each of the opposing terms (source or sink) may refer to the same object, depending on the perspective of the observer and the sign convention being used; there is no intrinsic difference between a source and a sink.\n\nIn some cases, the term current source refers to a boundary where charge flows from locations where it is not measured to locations where it is measured. In a similar fashion, a current sink may refer to the boundary where charge flows from locations where it is measured to locations where it is not measured. By analogy to the flow of water, a current source would be like a mountain spring - water flows from its source (a hidden location underground) to the surface where it is easily observed. Using the same analogy, a current sink would be like water flowing down a drain - water travels from where it is observed to where it is not observed.\n\nShown at right is a general two-compartment model to help illustrate the definition of current sources or sinks. In this two-compartment model, the compartments are separated by a semi-conductive barrier (gray). An observer, symbolized by the eye, can \"see\" only one compartment at a time. Red arrows indicate the direction of flow of positive charges, while black arrows indicate the direction of flow of negative charges. The pink and green backgrounds are meant to symbolize different configurations, configuration 1 when charges are flowing in one direction and configuration 2 when they are flowing in the opposite direction. The difference between the left and right panels is simply the location of the \"eye\".\n\nA source or a sink is defined by which compartment is viewable by the observer.\n\nIn biology, the schematic barrier in the figure could represent a cell membrane, and as a result, the two compartments could represent the inside and the outside of the cell. Generally speaking the point of observation would be outside the cell. Thus the cell would be termed a sink with respect to any flow of positive charges into it, and the cell would act as a source for any positive charges flowing out of it. Note that when considering the flow of negative charges, the definitions are reversed.\n\nCurrent sources and sinks have proven to be very valuable in the study of brain function. Both have particular relevance in electrophysiology. Two examples of the study of sources and sinks are Electroencephalography (EEG) and Current Source Density Analysis (extracellular field potentials), but have also shown enhancements in spatio-temporal resolution of EEG .\n\nCurrent source density analysis (which could more accurately be called current source and sink density analysis) is the practice of placing a microelectrode in proximity to a nerve or a nerve cell to detect current sourcing from, or sinking into, their plasma membranes. When positive charges, for example, flow quickly across a plasma membrane to the inside of a cell (sink) this creates a transient cloud of negativity in the vicinity of the sink. This is because the flow of positive charges into the interior of the cell leaves behind uncompensated negative charges. A nearby micro-electrode with substantial tip resistance (on the order of 1 MΩ) can detect that negativity because a voltage difference will develop across the tip of the electrode (between the negativity outside the electrode, and the electroneutral environment inside the electrode). Put another way, the electrode internal solution will donate some of the positive charge needed to compensate the negativity caused by the current sink. Thus, the inside of the electrode will become negative relative to ground for as long as the extracellular negativity persists. The extracellular negativity will persist as long as the current sink is present. Thus, by measuring a negativity relative to ground, the electrode indirectly reports the presence of a nearby current sink. The size of the recorded negativity will vary directly with the size of the current sink and inversely with the distance between the electrode and the sink.\n\nThe relationship between the sum of the current sources and sinks and the voltage measured by the microelectrode probe may be calculated analytically if it is assumed that the quasi-static assumption holds, that the medium is spherically symmetric, homogeneous, isotropic, and infinite, and if the current source or sink is modeled as a point source. The relationship is given by:\n\nwhere formula_2 is the potential at radius formula_3 from the source or sink, which passes current formula_4 through a medium with conductivity formula_5.\n\n"}

Many county collectors try to go for \"blackout\", to visit every county unit in the United States. Others try to black out individual states, and others are only interested in keeping track of the counties they have visited without blacking out any states.\n\nCounty collecting is a way for people to relate to geography and their own life histories. One journalist characterized it as \"a very organized form of wanderlust.\" Many county collectors became interested in the pursuit after being given a school assignment to plot their travels on a county-outline map of the United States. Many county collectors document their travels by being photographed with a county sign marker, or by taking a photo of the sign itself. Some document these travels with gas and other receipts. However, the web sites and organized groups that facilitate county collecting do not require a participant to prove his or her entry into a particular county.\n\nThe Extra Miler Club (EMC) was founded in 1973 by three county completionists who came up with the idea because they had been collecting license plates and noticed in their discussion how many rural counties they had all visited in that pursuit. The club is a non-profit organization that meets annually in conjunction with the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association and recognizes completers (of which there are now more than 60, as of 2019) on its web site.\n\nSome avid county collectors visit new counties by taking circuitous routes, for example, driving from Minneapolis to Chicago by way of Green Bay, Wisconsin. The most determined collectors take entire trips which consist of driving around states in cornrow patterns. This is pure county collecting. On the other hand, taking a short detour from a direct route to visit one or more counties is called \"dipping\".\n\nThere are currently 3142 counties and county-equivalents in the United States, including the boroughs and census areas of Alaska, the parishes of Louisiana, the independent cities Baltimore, Maryland, St. Louis, Missouri, Carson City, Nevada, 38 cities in Virginia and Washington, D.C..

He created the route while a member of the federal board appointed to create the Federal Highway System, then pushed for the establishment of the U.S. Highway 66 Association to pave and promote the highway.\n\nHe was born in Stevensville, Pennsylvania on August 31, 1871. He and his parents, Alexander James Avery and Ruie Stevens Avery moved to Missouri in 1881. In 1890, the family moved to Noel, Missouri, where Cyrus received a certificate to teach in public schools. In 1893, he enrolled in William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1897. He married Essie McClelland after graduation, then moved to Oklahoma City to be an insurance agent. In 1904, he moved to Vinita in Indian Territory, where he expanded into real estate loans and invested in the oil industry, establishing the Avery Oil & Gas Company. In 1907, he moved again to Tulsa. He bought a farm near Tulsa in 1908, where he raised Holstein and Ayshire cattle, Druoc hogs, Shopshire sheep, and Percheron horses. In the following year, he established a farm northeast of Tulsa for diversified agriculture. Cyrus had three children with Essie: sons Gordon Avery and Leighton Avery, and daughter Helen Avery Berghell.\n\nAvery realized that an interstate system of highways would help his adopted city and state prosper. He became impressed with the Good Roads Movement going on in Missouri and joined the Oklahoma Good Roads Association. He also served as president of the Albert Pike Highway Association from 1917 to 1927. He was elected chairman of the Tulsa County Commission, serving from 1913 to 1916, and is considered responsible for the construction of the Eleventh Street Bridge, which replaced an older wooden bridge across the Arkansas River. He also began pushing for a statewide improvement of roads. He eventually became involved in the creation of the Ozarks Trails, a system of roads connecting St. Louis and Amarillo, Texas. After working with creating more roads, he was elected president of the Associated Highway Associations of America. In 1923, he was appointed to the Oklahoma State Highway Commission, where he implemented a gasoline tax to fund the highway department.\n\nHe became instrumental in pushing for a federal level of good roads. In 1925, the United States Secretary of Agriculture appointed him to the Joint Board of Interstate Highways, which was to designate the new federal highways and mark them.\n\nOne of the routes requested by Congress was a road running from Virginia Beach, Virginia to Los Angeles, California. This road would follow what is now U.S. Highway 60 from Virginia Beach to Springfield, Missouri, continue west to Joplin, across southern Kansas, Colorado, Utah, turning south to Las Vegas, Nevada, then further south and west to Los Angeles. Avery successfully argued that to avoid the high peaks of the Rocky Mountains, the road should turn south through Tulsa and Oklahoma City, continue west across the Texas Panhandle, New Mexico, Arizona, and southern California. His suggestion that this highway should go east from Springfield to St. Louis and Chicago, Illinois, as commerce naturally continued in that direction, was also adopted.\n\nAfter the highways were routed, the group decided not to name the highways (as had been done by many non-profit groups which were currently connecting various state routes into longer multi-state and transcontinental routes), but instead to follow the pattern of numbering the highways, as established in Wisconsin and Missouri. The current east-west routes would be even numbers, and the north-south would be odd. Major routes would be one- or two-digit numbers ending in either \"1\" or \"0\" depending on the route. To avoid a \"U.S. 0\", U.S. Highway 2 was treated as a \"0\" highway and U.S. Route 101 would be treated as a two-digit highway to expand the number of available routes north-south. Avery, arguing that the Chicago to Los Angeles route would be a major highway, numbered the highway US 60. This received support from Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, and Missouri. It was outright attacked by a delegation from Kentucky.\n\nThe Virginia Beach–Springfield route had been designated as U.S. 62 and actually terminated south of Ozark, Missouri at U.S. Highway 65. Kentucky would be the only state without a \"0\" highway. They countered Avery's US route by pushing for US 60 to run between Virginia Beach and Los Angeles; the Springfield to Chicago section could be \"U.S. 60 North\". Avery returned with \"U.S. 60 South\" for the Springfield–Virginia Beach alignment. Kentucky threatened to walk completely out of the new highway system (individual states could not be forced to participate in it). Finally, Kentucky offered a compromise: connect their highway with Avery's in Springfield and give their highway the number 60. Avery could have his Chicago–Los Angeles highway if he would accept the number 62 which was originally assigned to their road. Avery disliked the number 62, found out 66 was not used, and designated the Chicago–Los Angeles highway as U.S. 66. In 1926, the Federal Highway System was approved by Congress. With this done, Congress also de-certified all the old \"association\" highways.\n\nIn 1927, Avery pushed for the creation of the U.S. Highway 66 Association to promote paving U.S. 66 and promote travel on the highway. He was elected Vice President in 1929. He got a business connection in Springfield, Missouri appointed as president. In the 1930s, Avery would attempt to have himself elected president of the organization, but he never succeeded.\n\nEssie Avery died in October 1962. Cyrus Avery died in Los Angeles, California on July 2, 1963, and was buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in Tulsa. Avery Drive, a street in southwest Tulsa, was named for him.\n\nIn 1997, the National Historic Route 66 Federation established a Cyrus Avery Award, which has been presented variously to individuals for outstanding creativity in depicting Route 66, and to organizations for noteworthy preservation projects.\n\nIn 2004, the City of Tulsa, Oklahoma renamed the Eleventh Street Bridge (which carried US 66 over the Arkansas River), the \"Cyrus Avery Route 66 Memorial Bridge\" in his honor.\n\nIn late 2012, artist Robert Summers unveiled \"East Meets West\", a sculpture in \"Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza\" at Southwest Boulevard at Riverside Drive in Tulsa. The detailed 135%-scale bronze depicts Avery stopping his Ford on the 11th Street Bridge as the vehicle frightened two horses pulling a wagon laden with oil barrels.\n\n"}

Whilst several Brisbane based bands had released their own independent singles, Able Label was the first to cater for a number of acts. The Go-Betweens released their first two singles, \"Lee Remick\" and \"People Say\", on the label in 1978 and 1979. It allowed a number of other Brisbane groups, The Numbers (later to become The Riptides), The Apartments and the Four Gods to press their own records using the Able Label logo. Not all bands were permitted to use the Able Label logo, one such band was Razar who were refused permission to use the logo on their seminal 1978 single \"Task Force\". The band were accused of appropriating the label's name, with the single using the catalogue number AB002. The most likely explanation is that it was a manufacturing error by the pressing plant in Sydney. Able Records were limited pressings ranging from 500 - 700 and are now considered collectors' items.\n\n\n"}

Cryo-EM is gaining popularity in structural biology.\n\nThe utility of transmission electron cryomicroscopy stems from the fact that it allows the observation of specimens that have not been stained or fixed in any way, showing them in their native environment. This is in contrast to X-ray crystallography, which requires crystallizing the specimen, which can be difficult, and placing them in non-physiological environments, which can occasionally lead to functionally irrelevant conformational changes.\n\nRecent advances in detector technology and software algorithms have allowed for the determination of macromolecular structures at near-atomic resolution by cryo-EM. These include viruses, ribosomes, mitochondria, ion channels, and enzyme complexes. As of 2018, cryo-EM can be applied to structures as small as hemoglobin (64 kDa) and with resolutions up to 1.8 Å. Cryo-EM structures currently represent just over 2.5% of structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank, although this number is rapidly increasing as more and more cryo-EM structures are published each year. An application of cryo-EM is cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), where a 3D reconstruction of the sample is created from tilted 2D images.\nThe original rationale for CryoTEM was as a means to fight radiation damage for biological specimens. The amount of radiation required to collect an image of a specimen in the electron microscope is high enough to be a potential source of specimen damage for delicate structures. In addition, the high vacuum required on the column of an electron microscope makes the environment for the sample quite harsh.\n\nThe problem of the vacuum was partially solved by the introduction of negative stains but even with negative stains biological samples are prone to structural collapse upon dehydration of the specimen. Embedding the samples in ice below the sublimation temperature was a possibility that was contemplated early on, but water tends to arrange into a crystalline lattice of lower density upon freezing and this can destroy the structure of anything that is embedded in it.\n\nIn the early 1980s, several groups studying solid state physics were attempting to produce vitreous ice by different means, such as high pressure freezing or flash freezing. In a seminal paper in 1984, the group led by Jacques Dubochet at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory showed images of adenovirus embedded in a vitrified layer of water. This paper is generally considered to mark the origin of Cryo-EM, and the technique has been developed to the point of becoming routine at numerous laboratories throughout the world.\n\nThe energy of the electrons used for imaging (80-300 kV) is high enough that covalent bonds can be broken. When imaging specimens are vulnerable to radiation damage, it is necessary to limit the electron exposure used to acquire the image. These low exposures require that the images of thousands or even millions of identical frozen molecules be selected, aligned, and averaged to obtain high-resolution maps, using specialized software. A significant improvement in structural features was achieved in 2012 by the introduction of direct electron detectors and better computational algorithms.\n\nIn 2015, Bridget Carragher and colleagues at the Scripps National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy used techniques she and Clint Potter developed to determine the first cryo-EM structure with a resolution finer than 3 Å, thereby elevating CryoTEM as a tool comparable to and potentially superior to traditional x-ray crystallography techniques. Since then, higher resolutions have been achieved, including a 2.2 Å structure of bacterial enzyme β-galactosidase in 2015 and a 1.8 Å structure of glutamate dehydrogenase in 2016. Cryo-EM has also been used to determine the structure of various viruses, including the Zika virus, and has been applied to large complexes such as the spliceosome. In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded jointly to Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson, \"for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution\".\n\nThe biological material is spread on an electron microscopy grid and is preserved in a frozen-hydrated state by rapid freezing, usually in liquid ethane near liquid nitrogen temperature. By maintaining specimens at liquid nitrogen temperature or colder, they can be introduced into the high-vacuum of the electron microscope column. Most biological specimens are extremely radiosensitive, so they must be imaged with low-dose techniques (usefully, the low temperature of transmission electron cryomicroscopy provides an additional protective factor against radiation damage).\n\nConsequently, the images are extremely noisy. For some biological systems it is possible to average images to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and retrieve high-resolution information about the specimen using the technique known as single particle analysis. This approach in general requires that the things being averaged are identical, although some limited conformational heterogeneity can now be studied (e.g. ribosome). Three-dimensional reconstructions from CryoTEM images of protein complexes and viruses have been solved to sub-nanometer or near-atomic resolution, allowing new insights into the structure and biology of these large assemblies.\n\nAnalysis of ordered arrays of protein, such as 2-D crystals of transmembrane proteins or helical arrays of proteins, also allows a kind of averaging which can provide high-resolution information about the specimen. This technique is called electron crystallography.\n\nThe thin film method is limited to thin specimens (typically < 500 nm) because the electrons cannot cross thicker samples without multiple scattering events. Thicker specimens can be vitrified by plunge freezing (cryofixation) in ethane (up to tens of μm in thickness) or more commonly by high pressure freezing (up to hundreds of μm). They can then be cut in thin sections (40 to 200 nm thick) with a diamond knife in a cryoultramicrotome at temperatures lower than -135 °C (devitrification temperature). The sections are collected on an electron microscope grid and are imaged in the same manner as specimen vitrified in thin film. This technique is called transmission electron cryomicroscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) or transmission electron cryomicroscopy of frozen-hydrated sections.\n\nIn addition to allowing vitrified biological samples to be imaged, CryoTEM can also be used to image material specimens that are too volatile in vacuum to image using standard, room temperature electron microscopy. For example, vitrified sections of liquid-solid interfaces can be extracted for analysis by CryoTEM, and sulfur, which is prone to sublimation in the vacuum of electron microscopes, can be stabilized and imaged in CryoTEM.\n\nA variety of techniques can be used in CryoTEM. Popular techniques include:\n\n\n\n"}

Average sea surface temperature along the NPC can range in the winter from 45-61°F (7.2-16.1°C) and in the summer months 64°F-74°F (17.8-23.3°C).\n\nAs it flows from west to east, the latitudinal extent of the NPC increases such that it spans some 20 degrees of latitude east of the dateline. This is associated with a decrease in the speed of current; eastward directed speeds at the surface are typically less than 0.05 m/s (5 cm/s) in the central Pacific. As the NPC approaches the west coast of North America, it divides into two broad currents: the northward flowing Alaska Current and the southward flowing California Current. This splitting of flow is referred to as the bifurcation of the NPC.\n\nThe Gulf of Alaska and the California Current receive different volumes and flows of warm water from the North Pacific Current. The Gulf of Alaska receives about 60% of the flow of the NPC while the California Current receives the remaining 40%. These values may fluctuate, resulting in changes in the volume and the speed of the NPC water entering into the Alaska and California Currents.\n\nThe NPC forms the northward portion of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. As the eastward extension of the Kuroshio, the flow of the NPC can lead to the transport of material from the western Pacific to the coast of North America. For example, some of the marine debris from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami of 2011 was transported by the NPC across the Pacific, leading to deposition of tsunami debris along the shores of Alaska, British Columbia, Washington and Oregon.\n\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba on four occasions between 1900 and 1932. Bernier was a member of the Conservative Party, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Rodmond Roblin. His father, Thomas A. Bernier, was a member of the Senate of Canada.\n\nBernier was born in St. Jean d'Iberville, Québec, and educated at St. Boniface College and the Manitoba University. He received a Master of Arts degree. Bernier was called to the Manitoba bar in 1896 and began practising as a barrister-at-law in Winnipeg in 1897. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election held on November 24, 1900, defeating Victor Mager by 154 votes in the St. Boniface constituency. He lost his seat in the 1903 provincial election, losing to Liberal Horace Chevrier by a single vote.\n\nBernier was re-elected to the legislature in the 1907 election, defeating Chevrier by 71 votes. Returned without difficulty in the 1910 campaign, he was appointed to cabinet on May 22, 1913 as Provincial Secretary.\n\nBernier was again re-elected in the 1914 provincial election. Early in 1915, the entire Roblin administration was forced to resign after the Lieutenant Governor issued a report which found the government had been guilty of corrupt practices in the tendering of contracts for new legislative buildings. Bernier did not seek re-election in the 1915 campaign, and the St. Boniface constituency was won by Liberal Joseph Dumas.\n\nBernier returned to the legislature for a third time in the 1920 provincial election, defeating Dumas and three other candidates. He identified himself as an independent during this period, but was still widely regarded as being in sympathy with the Conservative Party. He was again returned in the 1922 campaign, once again identifying himself as an independent.\n\nBernier resigned from the legislature on September 1, 1926 to campaign for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1926 federal election. He ran as a candidate of the Conservative Party of Canada in the federal riding of St. Boniface, and lost to Liberal John Power Howden by 2,668 votes.\n\nBernier ran again for the provincial constituency of St. Boniface in the 1927 provincial election, this time as an official candidate of the Manitoba Conservative Party. This campaign ended in controversy, with a ballot-counting process marred by confusion and error. Liberal candidate L.P. Gagnon was initially declared the winner by one vote, but a recount saw Bernier confirmed as the victor. He returned to the legislature, and rejoined the Conservative caucus on the opposition benches. He was expelled from the legislature for a month in 1928, after being named by the Speaker.\n\nBernier lost his seat for the final time in the 1932 campaign, falling to Labour candidate Harold Lawrence by 504 votes. He actually won a plurality of votes on the first count, but fell behind on transfers (Manitoba used the single transferable ballot for elections during this period).\n\nFrom 1900 to 1917, Bernier was editor for the francophone newspaper \"Le Manitoba\". In 1910, he married Rose Marie Bernier. Bernier was an honorary colonel with the Canadian Expeditionary Force during World War I and helped with recruiting.\n\nAfter leaving politics, he served as a county court judge from 1933 to 1949.\n\nBernier died in hospital in Montreal at the age of 76.\n\n"}

It occurs when the development of the corpus callosum, the band of white matter connecting the two hemispheres in the brain, in the embryo is disrupted. The result of this is that the fibers that would otherwise form the corpus callosum are instead longitudinally oriented along the ipsilateral ventricular wall and form structures called Probst bundles.\n\nIn addition to agenesis, other degrees of callosal defects exist, including hypoplasia (underdevelopment or thinness), hypogenesis (partial agenesis) or dysgenesis (malformation).\n\nACC is found in many syndromes and can often present alongside hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis. When this is the case, there can also be an enlarged fourth ventricle or hydrocephalus; this is called Dandy–Walker malformation.\n\nSigns and symptoms of ACC and other callosal disorders vary greatly among individuals. However, some characteristics common in individuals with callosal disorders include vision impairments, low muscle tone (hypotonia), poor motor coordination, delays in motor milestones such as sitting and walking, delayed toilet training and dysautonomic symptoms such as low perception of pain or chewing and swallowing difficulties.\n\nLaboratory research has demonstrated that individuals with ACC have difficulty transferring more complex information from one hemisphere to the other. They also have been shown to have some cognitive disabilities (difficulty in complex problem solving) and social difficulties (missing subtle social cues), even when their intelligence quotient is normal. Recent research suggests that specific social difficulties may be a result of impaired face processing. The unusual social behavior in childhood often resembles that of an autism spectrum disorder.\n\nOther characteristics sometimes associated with callosal disorders include seizures, spasticity, early feeding difficulties and/or gastric reflux, hearing impairments, abnormal head and facial features, and intellectual disability.\n\nBrain anomalies that can sometimes occur in syndromes that cause callosal disorders include:\n\n\nSome syndromes that frequently include ACC are:\n\n\nSome conditions that can sometimes be associated with ACC or other callosal disorders include:\n\n\nAgenesis of the corpus callosum is caused by disruption to development of the fetal brain between the 3rd and 12th weeks of pregnancy. In most cases, it is not possible to know what caused an individual to have ACC or another callosal disorder. However, research suggests that some possible causes may include chromosome errors, inherited genetic factors, prenatal infections or injuries, prenatal toxic exposures, structural blockage by cysts or other brain abnormalities and metabolic disorders.\n\nUntil recently, the medical literature did not indicate a connection among many genetic disorders, both genetic syndromes and genetic diseases, that are now being found to be related. As a result of new genetic research, some of these are, in fact, highly related in their root cause despite the widely varying symptoms apparent on clinical examination. Agenesis of the corpus callosum is one such disease, part of an emerging class of diseases called ciliopathies. The underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary cilia structures of the cell organelles that are present in many cellular types throughout the human body. The cilia defects adversely affect \"numerous critical developmental signaling pathways\" essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multi-symptom nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases. Known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia, Bardet–Biedl syndrome, polycystic kidney and liver disease, nephronophthisis, Alström syndrome, Meckel–Gruber syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration.\n\nIn utero exposure to cocaine, heroin, amphetamines and phenylpropanolamine can lead to agenesis of corpus callosum.\n\nCallosal disorders can be diagnosed through brain imaging studies or during autopsy. They may be diagnosed through an MRI, CT scan, Sonography, prenatal ultrasound, or prenatal MRI.\n\nThere are currently no specific medical treatments for callosal disorders, but individuals with ACC and other callosal disorders may benefit from a range of developmental therapies, educational support, and services. It is important to consult with a variety of medical, health, educational, and social work professionals. Such professionals include neurologists, neuropsychologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech and language pathologists, pediatricians, recreation therapists, music therapists, geneticists, social workers, special educators, early childhood intervention specialists, and caregivers for adults.\n\nPrognosis varies depending on the type of callosal abnormality and associated conditions or syndromes. It is not possible for the corpus callosum to regenerate. Neuropsychological testing reveals subtle differences in higher cortical function compared to individuals of the same age and education without ACC,\nalthough some individuals with callosal disorders have average intelligence and live normal lives.\n\nKim Peek, inspiration for the film \"Rain Man\" and renowned for his savant abilities, was born with agenesis of the corpus callosum, along with macrocephaly and damage to the cerebellum.\n"}

The album was produced by Laurie Latham who recorded the album in Germany, Belgium, London and Liverpool; this followed an aborted attempt at recording the album without de Freitas and with producer Gil Norton. With Latham being an exacting producer, and singer Ian McCulloch receiving star treatment and drinking heavily, the recording of the album was more difficult than the band had initially hoped. The album made more use of keyboards than their previous albums, which had been string-heavy.\n\nAlthough \"Echo & the Bunnymen\" was successful in the United Kingdom and, to a lesser degree, the United States, it received mixed reviews from the music press following its release in July 1987. The album reached number four on the UK Albums Chart, number 51 on the United States \"Billboard\" 200, number 51 on the Canadian \"RPM\"100 Albums and number 22 on the Swedish Albums Chart. Since its release, the album has been certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry. The album includes the singles \"The Game\", \"Lips Like Sugar\" and \"Bedbugs and Ballyhoo\".\n\nEcho & the Bunnymen took time off from touring, writing and recording after the release of the critically acclaimed \"Ocean Rain\" in 1984, because the band's manager, the fabled prankster Bill Drummond, felt that a year off would help the band write different kinds of songs in preparation for the next album. During the time off, drummer Pete de Freitas travelled through Spain and France on his motorcycle, bass guitarist Les Pattinson worked on his new boat, and singer Ian McCulloch released a solo single \"September Song\", leaving guitarist Will Sergeant as the only band member to spend the time doing nothing. Even though the band enjoyed an excellent and creative working relation with Drummond, by the end of 1984 they had mutually parted company as the band were not making enough money.\n\nUnder the new management of Mick Hancock, Duran Duran's tour manager, the band returned to work in May 1985 with a tour of Scandinavia. They also made a headline appearance at the Glastonbury Festival on 21 June 1985, when they played live for the first time two new songs that would later be included on the album—\"Satellite\" and \"All in Your Mind\". Now ready to start recording, they entered the studio with Clive Langer and their former producer Ian Broudie to record the songs they had played at Glastonbury, as well as \"Like a Rollercoaster\" and \"Jimmy Brown\". Not liking the results of this session, the band considered Eddy Grant and ABBA's production team before settling on Laurie Latham as their producer. McCulloch had been impressed by the sharp quality of Latham's production on The Stranglers' single \"Skin Deep\". The band met with Latham in Brussels and recorded \"All in Your Mind\", \"Like a Rollercoaster\" and \"Jimmy Brown\", which was renamed \"Bring on the Dancing Horses\". \"Bring on the Dancing Horses\" appeared on the WEA compilation album \"Songs to Learn & Sing\" in November 1985, and was released as a single in the same month. An early version of \"Bedbugs and Ballyhoo\", a song that would appear on the album, appeared on the B-side to the 12-inch version.\n\nOn 31 December 1985, de Freitas went to New Orleans with the road crew on a drug binge and there announced his resignation from the band. Hence, the band faced 1986 with a commitment to record an album, but without their drummer—a musician who was considered fundamental to the band's creative success. They hired former Haircut One Hundred drummer Blair Cunningham for the spring 1986 tour of the United States; however, he didn't fit in, and after the tour left to join The Pretenders. The band then hired former ABC drummer David Palmer, and recorded a few sessions with producer Gil Norton for the new album. However, Palmer decided by July 1986 that he did not want to remain with the band. As he left the band, de Freitas returned to the United Kingdom and expressed a wish to rejoin. Uncertain of de Freitas's commitment to the band, and his fragile mental state, they took him back as a hired hand rather than a full member. Now with the line-up that would record \"Echo & the Bunnymen\", the band gave a live television appearance for the BBC in September 1986 when they played two new songs, \"The Game\" and \"Lips Like Sugar\". According to Will Sergeant, the band were under pressure from Warner Music chairman Rob Dickins to produce an album that would replicate the success of Peter Gabriel's recent number one album \"So\": \"I couldn't believe it when Rob Dickins brought us into his office and played us Peter Gabriel's album: 'I want you to sound like this!' I think he escaped with his life that day.\"\n\nRecording of the tracks that were to appear on \"Echo & the Bunnymen\" began at Conny Plank's studio in Cologne. Both Echo & the Bunnymen and their label, WEA Records, were unhappy with the results of the Norton sessions with Palmer playing drums. Keen to record again with de Freitas, the band decided to scrap the Norton sessions and to start recording a new album with Latham who had previously worked with the band on their 1985 single \"Bring on the Dancing Horses\". The sessions moved from Cologne to ICP Studios in Brussels before returning to Cologne and finishing off at The Workhouse in London and Amazon Studios in Liverpool. The band hoped that the album would be a collection of simple songs; however, Latham was very specific and exacting, and he would work on one song for as long as a month. Recording was also complicated by the star treatment received by McCulloch. This, along with his heavy drinking, alienated him from the rest of the band. In a 1995 interview, band guitarist Will Sergeant said of McCulloch's treatment, \"We just found it all ridiculous. He had people running around behind him, basically wiping his arse.\" McCulloch later said in a 1997 interview: \"I knew I was losing it. I was on another planet but then I didn't want to be on the one [the other Bunnymen] were on.\"\nWhile making the album, the band recorded a version of the Doors' 1967 single \"People Are Strange\" for the soundtrack of the 1987 film \"The Lost Boys\". Ray Manzarek, former keyboard player with the Doors, was brought in to provide keyboards on the song. While in the studio, he also contributed keyboards to a re-recording of \"Bedbugs and Ballyhoo\", which had previously been the B-side of the 12-inch version of \"Bring on the Dancing Horses\". Once \"Echo & the Bunnymen\" had been recorded the band's management company, Direct Management, decided to have it mixed by Bruce Lampcov in the United States. While the album was mixed, the band was on tour in Brazil and listened to the finished tracks over the phone.\n\nLatham moved the band away from the use of strings, which featured heavily on \"Ocean Rain\" and to a lesser extent on \"Porcupine\" (1983), and introduced keyboards to the melody of the tracks. De Freitas's drumming was contained and discreet and McCulloch's vocals were more restrained. Although the album contained hook-heavy tracks such as \"Lips Like Sugar\", the guitars on tracks such as \"Lost and Found\" are more representative of the album as a whole.\n\nThe resulting album was disliked by the entire band. Describing in 1987 what he thought of as the over-production of the album, Sergeant described it as \"an overcooked fish\"; bass guitarist Les Pattinson said \"I like the songs, just hated the mixes\"; and in 1995, McCulloch said \"It still sounds crap.\"\n\nAfter previewing the album with a short concert on top of the HMV shop on Oxford Street in London, \"Echo & the Bunnymen\" was first released on 6 July 1987 as an LP and CD, by WEA Records in the United Kingdom and elsewhere and by Sire Records in the United States. The album reached a peak of number four on the UK Albums Chart. The album became the band's most successful in the United States where it reached number fifty-one on the \"Billboard\" 200. The album also reached number fifty-one on the Canadian \"RPM\"100 Albums chart and number twenty-two on the Swedish Albums Chart. The album has also been certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry for having shipped more than copies. Along with the other four of the band's first five albums, \"Echo & the Bunnymen\" was remastered and reissued on CD in 2003 – these were released for the band's twenty-fifth anniversary. Seven bonus tracks were added to the album and included early versions of \"Bring on the Dancing Horses\" (title \"Jimmy Brown\"), \"The Game\" and \"Bedbugs and Ballyhoo\". Also included was a cover version of The Doors' \"Soul Kitchen\", an extended version of \"Bring on the Dancing Horses\" and the previously unreleased track \"Hole in the Holy\". The reissued album was produced by Andy Zax and Bill Inglot and released by Rhino Entertainment.\n\nIn his 1987 review of the album for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, music journalist J. D. Considine described Latham's production of the album as \"ineffectual\" and \"well mannered\". He went on say that there was no \"anxious energy or knife-edged irony that made the group's earlier albums so compelling\". He finishes his review by saying the album is \"as vacant as it is pretty\". Reviewing the 2003 remastered album, Andrew Harrison for \"Blender\" magazine's website said, \"Egomania and off-message electronics experiments sank their eponymous 1987 comedown...\" Taking a more positive stance, David Cleary for AllMusic describes the album as \"the hookiest and most memorable the band would ever write\". Having described de Freitas's drumming as solid and veering toward the danceable, and McCulloch's singing as \"restrained and tasteful\", Cleary added that \"The production values were excellent, with many subtle touches that do not detract from the album's overall directness.\" Although he stated that the production \"watered the band's sound down\", Joe Tangari for Pitchfork Media said, \"The band's attempt to reach a wider audience worked out.\"\n\nThree tracks from the album were released as singles. The first of these was \"The Game\", which was released on 1 June 1987. This was followed by \"Lips Like Sugar\", which was released in August 1987. The final single to be released from the album was \"Bedbugs and Ballyhoo\", which was also released before the year's end in the United States and Germany. \"The Game\" and \"Lips Like Sugar\" reached numbers 28 and 36 respectively on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nAll tracks written and composed by Will Sergeant, Ian McCulloch and Les Pattinson except where noted.\n\nwith:\n\n"}

He was one of three children of Jørgen Fredrik Schweigaard (1771–1818) and Johanne Marie Dahll (1785–1818). Both parents died when he was 10 years old and the children were raised by their grandmother. He studied law at the University of Christiania, where he received his degree in 1832. The following year, the Norwegian Parliament gave him a scholarship to study abroad in Germany and France.\n\nWhen he returned to Norway, he got a position as a lecturer at the University of Christiania. He was a professor of both jurisprudence and economics during the 1830s and 1840s. In economic theory, he was an extremely influential publicist for economic liberalism, although not a supporter of Laissez-faire economic ideology. He advocated that the state had an important and necessary role to play in economic life. He is widely credited in helping bring about Norway's change to a capitalist economy. In legal theory, Schweigaard was opposed to the German jurisprudence and legal philosophy that had dominated Northern Europe since the Age of Enlightenment, including natural law. He believed that the stark dichotomies of conceptualism were misleading. Schweigaard figures prominently the theory of Nordic legal pragmatism advanced by Sverre Blandhol, along with Anders Sandøe Ørsted and Friedrich Karl von Savigny.\n\nFrom 1842 to 1869, he was a member of the Norwegian Parliament. His strong belief in the country's economic capabilities made him the leading spokesman in Parliament for construction of railways and development of mail and telegraph services. In 1865, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\n\nHe was married during 1835 to Caroline Magnine Homann (1814-1870).

{"id": "2236083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236083", "title": "Osteopenia", "text": "Osteopenia\n\nOsteopenia, preferably known as \"low bone mass\" or \"low bone density\", is a condition in which bone mineral density is low. Because their bones are weaker, people with osteopenia may have a higher risk of fractures, and some people may go on to develop osteoporosis. In 2010, 43 million older adults had osteopenia.\n\nThere is no single cause for osteopenia, although there are several risk factors, including modifiable (behavioral, including dietary and use of certain drugs) and non-modifiable (for instance, loss of bone mass with age). For people with risk factors, screening via a DXA scanner may help to detect the development and progression of low bone density. Prevention of low bone density may begin early in life and includes a healthy diet and weight-bearing exercise, as well as avoidance of tobacco and alcohol. The treatment of osteopenia is controversial: non-pharmaceutical treatment involves preserving existing bone mass via healthy behaviors (dietary modification, weight-bearing exercise, avoidance or cessation of smoking or heavy alcohol use). Pharmaceutical treatment for osteopenia, including bisphosphonates and other medications, may be considered in certain cases but is not without risks. Overall, treatment decisions should be guided by considering each patient's constellation of risk factors for fractures.\n\nMany divide risk factors for osteopenia into fixed (non-changeable) and modifiable factors. Osteopenia can also be secondary to other diseases. An incomplete list of risk factors:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ISCD (International Society for Clinical Densitometry) and the National Osteoporosis Foundation recommend that older adults (women over 65 and men over 70) and adults with risk factors for low bone mass, or previous fragility fractures, undergo DXA testing. The DXA (dual X-ray absorptiometry) scan uses a form of X-ray technology, and offers accurate bone mineral density results with low radiation exposure.\n\nThe United States Preventive Task Force recommends osteoporosis screening for women with increased risk over 65 and states there is insufficient evidence to support screening men. The main purpose of screening is to prevent fractures. Of note, USPSTF screening guidelines are for osteoporosis, not specifically osteopenia.The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends use of central (hip and spine) DXA testing for accurate measure of bone density, emphasizing that peripheral or \"screening\" scanners should not be used to make clinically meaningful diagnoses, and that peripheral and central DXA scans cannot be compared to each other.\n\nDXA scanners can be used to diagnose osteopenia or osteoporosis as well as to measure bone density over time as people age or undergo medical treatment or lifestyle changes.\n\nInformation from the DXA scanner creates a bone mineral density T-score by comparing a patient's density to the bone density of a healthy young person. Bone density between 1 and 2.5 standard deviations below the reference, or a T-score between −1.0 and −2.5, indicates osteopenia (a T-score greater than or equal to −2.5 indicates osteoporosis). Calculation of the T-score itself may not be standardized. The ISCD recommends using Caucasian women between 20 and 29 years old as the baseline for bone density for ALL patients, but not all facilities follow this recommendation.\n\nThe ISCD recommends that Z-scores, not T-scores, be used to classify bone density in premenopausal women and men under 50.\n\nPrevention of low bone density can start early in life by maximizing peak bone density. Once a person loses bone density, the loss is usually irreversible, so preventing (greater than normal) bone loss is important.\n\nActions to maximize bone density and stabilize loss include:\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical treatment of osteopenia is controversial and more nuanced than well-supported recommendations for improved nutrition and weight-bearing exercise. The diagnosis of osteopenia in and of itself does not always warrant pharmaceutical treatment. Many people with osteopenia may be advised to follow risk prevention measures (as above).\n\nRisk of fracture guides clinical treatment decisions: the World Health Organization (WHO) Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) estimates the probability of hip fracture and the probability of a major osteoporotic fracture (MOF), which could occur in a bone other than the hip. In addition to bone density (T-score), calculation of the FRAX score involves age, body characteristics, health behaviors, and other medical history. \nAs of 2014, The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) recommends pharmaceutical treatment for osteopenic postmenopausal women and men over 50 with FRAX hip fracture probability of >3% or FRAX MOF probability >20%. As of 2016, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology agree. In 2017, the American College of Physicians recommended that clinicians use individual judgment and knowledge of patients' particular risk factors for fractures, as well as patient preferences, to decide whether to pursue pharmaceutical treatment for women with osteopenia over 65.\n\nPharmaceutical treatment for low bone density includes a range of medications. Commonly used drugs include bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate) - some studies show that decreased fracture risk and increased bone density after bisphosphonate treatment for osteopenia. Other medications include selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (raloxifene; estrogen; calcitonin; and teriparatide).\n\nThese drugs are not without risks. In this complex landscape, many argue that clinicians must consider a patient's individual risk of fracture, not simply treat those with osteopenia as equally at risk. A 2005 editorial in the Annals of Internal Medicine states \"The objective of using osteoporosis drugs is to prevent fractures. This can be accomplished only by treating patients who are likely to have a fracture, not by simply treating T-scores.\"\n\nOsteopenia, from Greek ὀστέον (\"ostéon\"), \"bone\" and πενία (\"penía\"), \"poverty\", is a condition of sub-normally mineralized bone, usually the result of a rate of bone lysis that exceeds the rate of bone matrix synthesis. See also osteoporosis.\n\nIn June 1992, the World Health Organization defined osteopenia.

Ron Hubbard is a posthumous biography of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard by British journalist Russell Miller. First published in the United Kingdom on 26 October 1987, the book takes a critical perspective, challenging the Church of Scientology's account of Hubbard's life and work. It quotes extensively from official documents acquired using the Freedom of Information Act and from Hubbard's personal papers, which were obtained via a defector from Scientology. It was also published in Australia, Canada and the United States.\n\nThe Church of Scientology strongly opposed the book's publication. The organization was accused of organising a smear and harassment campaign against Miller and his publisher, though it strenuously denied this accusation, and a private investigator involved in the campaign denied that the organization was his client. However, a leak of internal Scientology documents to the press in 1990 disclosed many details of the campaign. The organization and related corporate entities attempted to prevent the book's publication in court, resulting in cases that reached the Supreme Court of the United States, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales and the Federal Court of Canada. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to let a lower court's ruling stand, denying fair use protection for the book's use of unpublished sources, set a precedent favouring copyright protection of unpublished material over biographers' freedom of speech. Courts in the UK and Canada took an opposite view, allowing publication of \"Bare-faced Messiah\" in the public interest.\n\nReviews of the book have been broadly positive — one calling it \"the best and most comprehensive biography of L. Ron Hubbard\" — and praise the quality and depth of Miller's research. The Scientology organization has been less complimentary; the executor of Hubbard's estate called it \"a scumbag book  ... full of bullshit\" in a court deposition in the U.S.\n\nRussell Miller had been an investigative journalist for the \"Sunday Times\" and had written well-received biographies of Hugh Hefner (\"Bunny\", published in 1984) and J. Paul Getty (\"The House of Getty\", 1985). These were the first two biographies of a trilogy on sex, money and religion, with the Hubbard book completing the trilogy. He spent two years researching the book, which followed a \"Sunday Times Magazine\" investigation of the Church of Scientology published in October 1984. In 1985, he suggested that the \"Sunday Times\" should try to find Hubbard, who had disappeared from public view several years earlier. If the project succeeded, it would be a worldwide scoop for the newspaper. Even if it did not find the reclusive Scientology leader, the continuing mystery would itself be a good story. Through contacts among ex-Scientologists in the U.S., Miller narrowed down the area where Hubbard was hiding to the vicinity of San Luis Obispo, California. However, Hubbard died in January 1986 before Miller could finish his project. He decided at this point to use his research as the basis of a full-fledged biography of Hubbard, in addition to writing the previously agreed series of articles for the \"Sunday Times\".\n\n\"Bare-faced Messiah\" covers a period from 1911, when Hubbard was born, to his death in 1986, with some additional background on his family history. It describes his early life, his success as a science fiction writer in the 1930s and 1940s, his military career during the Second World War, the rise of Dianetics and Scientology in the 1950s, his journeys at sea with his followers in the 1960s and early 1970s and his legal problems and period as a recluse from the mid-1970s to 1986. The author draws on previously unpublished materials, such as Hubbard's teenage diaries and personal correspondence to colleagues, employers and the FBI, as well as government documents like Hubbard's military service record and FBI file. In an \"author's note\", Miller writes that the book would have been impossible without the Freedom of Information Act. Among the private papers quoted in the book are a letter written by Hubbard to the FBI denouncing his wife as a Soviet spy, another in which he tells his daughter Alexis that he is not really her father and an internal letter in which he suggests that Scientology should pursue religious status for business reasons. Other sources used by Miller include news articles and comments from interviews that he conducted with Hubbard's old acquaintances and family members.\n\nMiller's research was assisted by a set of Hubbard's personal papers obtained by Gerry Armstrong, a disaffected former employee of the Church of Scientology. Armstrong had been preparing material for an official biography of Hubbard, but left the Scientology organization in 1981 after finding that Hubbard's claims about his life conflicted with independent sources. The Church of Scientology obtained an injunction in California to prevent Armstrong from further distributing the documents. However, English courts refused to enforce this order.\n\nIn the book's preface, Miller summarizes his view of Hubbard:\n\nThe book contrasts Hubbard's boasts with Miller's research. For example, Chapter 6, which is entitled \"The Hero Who Never Was\", begins by quoting the official church biography: \"Commissioned before the war in 1941 by the US Navy ... serving in all five theaters of World War II and receiving 21 medals and palms ...\" And it ends by countering: If his own account of his war experiences is to be believed, he certainly deserved the twenty-one medals and palms he was said to have received. Unfortunately, his US Navy record indicates he was awarded just four routine medals — the American Defense Service Medal, awarded to everyone serving at the time of Pearl Harbor, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal and the World War Two Victory Medal, this last received by everyone serving on V-J Day. \n\nFor more detail on the debate surrounding Hubbard's military career, see the main article.\n\nThe Church of Scientology refused all cooperation with Miller and sought to obstruct his research. He wrote in his \"author's note\" at the start of the book:\n\nMiller had been warned before he began his work that he would face difficulties, but was unprepared for the level of harassment that he endured. While researching the book in the U.S., he was spied upon and was constantly followed. His friends and business associates also received hostile visits from Scientologists and private detectives trying to find \"dirt\" on him. In October 1987, Miller commented: \"There are teams of private detectives in the U.S. and this country questioning my friends and trying to discredit me.\" Attempts were made to implicate him in the murder of a private detective in South London, for a fire in a Wiltshire aircraft factory and for the murder of American singer Dean Reed. Reed had died the day before Miller had arrived in East Berlin to interview him. Miller's family was approached by private detectives seeking to implicate him in Reed's death, although they would not say who their client was. Another private investigator interviewed Miller's friends and associates, claiming to be acting for Reed's family, though they denied employing him. A former Scientology insider told the \"Sunday Times\" that Miller \"is kept under constant watch. Every time he goes abroad a two-man mission will be waiting for him at the airport when he arrives. They will monitor where he goes, who he sees, where he stays. This information will be added to his file, which is already more than 100 pages thick.\"\n\nSenior executives at publishers Michael Joseph and at the \"Sunday Times\", which serialised the book, received threatening phone calls and a visit from private investigator Eugene Ingram, who worked for the Church. Another private investigator, Jarl Grieve Einar Cynewulf, told \"Sunday Times\" journalists that he had been offered \"large sums of money\" to find a link between Miller and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as the Church reportedly believed that the CIA was driving investigations into its tax affairs in the U.S. According to Cynewulf, Miller's mail and phones were intercepted and his home was under constant surveillance. The newspaper reported that Cynewulf had chased its reporter and photographer through the streets of Bristol, armed with a pistol which he fired at them, saying, \"You'd better go now unless you want to end up in a wooden box. Do you want to be another Hungerford martyr?\"\n\nIn 1990, nearly three years after the book's first publication, a defector from the Church of Scientology provided the \"Sunday Times\" with internal documents detailing the smear campaign against Miller. These records listed several private investigators who had been hired to keep Miller under surveillance and feed false information about him to neighbours and the police. A Scientology executive had flown from Los Angeles to a flat in London where he and a private detective co-ordinated the campaign. Rubbish from the publisher's offices was regularly emptied into the flat's bathtub to be picked through. According to the informant, the investigators used contacts with the British police to try to implicate him in unsolved crimes: \"People were brought in from abroad posing as journalists to arrange interviews with Scotland Yard where they would drop innuendoes about Miller. Other investigators were used to smear his name with colleagues, friends and neighbours. They worked hard on the line that he was an undercover British intelligence man.\" A Church spokesman dismissed these allegations, saying, \"anyone giving you this sort of information must be crazy or on drugs.\"\n\nThe Church of Scientology and related entities sought injunctions against the book's publication, claiming copyright infringement of Hubbard's private documents. They threatened to sue in as many as fifty countries, adopting a strategy that the University of Pennsylvania's Professor Paul K. Saint-Amour has described as \"an international parade of litigation\" and \"whack-a-mole legal proceedings\". Much of the dispute centred on the plaintiffs' argument that the actions of former Scientology archivist Gerry Armstrong in providing Miller with unpublished materials (whether directly or indirectly) were a breach of his duty of confidence to the Church, and that the use of excerpts from this material violated copyrights owned by Hubbard's estate. Miller later noted that the plaintiffs did not attempt to dispute the facts of the book in court which, he said, was a pity as he had been looking forward to defending his meticulous research.\n\nThe first lawsuit was heard in the UK in October 1987 by Justice Vinelott. The litigants, the Church of Scientology of California, failed to obtain an injunction against the publication of the book. In his decision of 9 October 1987, the judge said that it was \"clear that the public interest far outweighed any duty of confidence that could conceivably be owed to Mr. Hubbard or his church.\" The unpublished materials were held to be \"essential\" if Hubbard's early career was to be \"properly evaluated\", and legal decisions against Armstrong in California could not bind an English court. The judge held that the Church had acted improperly in bringing its suit so late in the day. It had become aware in May of the plans to publish \"Bare-faced Messiah\", but had not brought suit until 29 September, less than a month before publication. The application for an injunction, he said, \"was made at a time, whether calculated or not, when the greatest possible damage and inconvenience would be caused to Penguin Books\". No satisfactory explanation had been made for the delay and, in the judge's view, the application \"was oppressive, and was not brought to protect any legitimate interest.\"\n\nThe judgement was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 22 October. The decision by Lord Justice Fox argued that Hubbard's \"cosmic significance\" in Scientology – a group which itself had been the subject of a Government report in 1972 – implied a strong public interest in the book's content. The delay in applying for an injunction was reason in itself to justify dismissing the appeal, but in addition the court ruled that \"the public had an interest that assertions of fact [by the Church] should be exposed to public criticism. The founder was dead and the material was not alleged to be untrue.\" The court noted that the plaintiffs had not argued that publication of the book would damage Hubbard's or the Church's reputation or that it was in any way defamatory. The Church was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords.\n\nIn advance of the court case, a female Scientologist was found collecting seven copies of the unpublished proofs from a copy shop in East Grinstead, near the Church of Scientology's UK headquarters at Saint Hill Manor. She was arrested but later released as there was no evidence of theft.\n\nIn Canada, New Era Publications International ApS of Denmark — an arm of the Church of Scientology — petitioned the Federal Court of Canada to block the publication of \"Bare-faced Messiah\" in December 1987. New Era submitted its request days before publisher Key Porter Books planned to begin its print run. The company argued that its sales of Hubbard's books would be adversely affected by the damage that Miller's book would cause to Hubbard's reputation. It also claimed that copyright had been violated through the unauthorised excerpting of unpublished materials and books written by Hubbard, and that it would interfere with New Era's own plans to publish an \"authorised\" biography based on the same materials. New Era's bid was rejected by Justice Bud Cullen, who said that the evidence presented in favour of an injunction \"falls far short of the evidence required\" to sustain such a request. He characterised Hubbard as an author of \"outlandish, foolish, vicious, racist writings.\" Similar bids to block the book failed in Australia and South Africa.\n\nA suit was brought in the U.S. by New Era Publications in May 1988 that sought to prevent \"Bare-faced Messiah\" being distributed, after it had already been published and shipped. Prior to publication, New Era offered to buy out the publication rights to \"Bare-faced Messiah\" but was rebuffed. Publisher Henry Holt had distributed 12,500 copies by the time New Era obtained a temporary restraining order to prevent shipment of the remaining copies from the first print run. New Era's request for an injunction against the distribution of the existing copies was refused. Henry Holt's president, Bruno Quinson, declared his company's intention to fight the suit: \"This is a case, to say the least, that has serious First Amendment considerations and we are vigorously opposing the Scientologists' efforts to prevent the publication of this book.\"\n\nThe district court that first heard the case ruled that, although the quotation of private correspondence breached copyright law, an injunction would deny the publisher's First Amendment rights. By coincidence, the judge who heard the case, Pierre N. Leval, was the same person who had recently heard a case involving the private correspondence of the writer J. D. Salinger, which resulted in a higher court's setting a controversial precedent that fair use protection could not be accorded to works that quoted unpublished material. His decision was seen as a repudiation of the higher court's \"Salinger\" precedent: \"The grant of an injunction would ... suppress an interesting, well researched, provocative study of a figure who, claiming both scientific and religious credentials, has wielded enormous influence over millions of people.\"\n\nWhen the case was appealed, the Second Circuit disagreed with Leval's judgement, arguing that copyright outweighed free speech arguments. Again coincidentally, the author of the decision was Judge Roger Miner, who had been among the authors of the \"Salinger\" decision. The court reiterated the \"Salinger\" finding that there was a \"strong presumption against fair use of unpublished work\" and that unpublished primary source materials should \"normally enjoy complete protection\" from fair use claims. This could not be overridden by the First Amendment. Nonetheless, the court still denied an injunction on the grounds of laches, specifically that New Era had waited two years to bring the case after first learning about the book. By \"sleeping on its rights\" — waiting too long — New Era had lost any right to equitable relief and had unfairly caused damage to Miller's publisher by the delay. Judge James L. Oakes agreed with the decision in a concurring opinion but argued that the majority had been wrong to reject the First Amendment as a defence. He argued, \"Responsible biographers and historians constantly use primary sources, letters, diaries, and memoranda. Indeed, it would be \"irresponsible\" to ignore such sources of information.\"\n\nAlthough they had prevailed, Henry Holt and Company asked all of the appeals court's judges for a rehearing \"en banc\" to establish that they had not just won on a technicality. The court denied this request by a 7–5 majority. The denial produced an unusual split between the judges; four who supported a rehearing stated that they believed that \"copying some small amounts of unpublished expression to report facts accurately and fairly\" was covered by fair use, while five who opposed it rejected that proposition, declaring that \"under ordinary circumstances\" the use of \"more than minimal amounts of unpublished expressive material\" should attract an automatic injunction. This argument was widely criticised following the case. David J. Goldberg and Robert J. Bernstein wrote in the \"New York Law Journal\" in May 1989 that the central problem with the majority's view was that:\n\nIn 1990, Henry Holt petitioned the Supreme Court, which let the Second Circuit's judgement stand. The outcome of the case drew a concerned reaction from publishers and journalists, who complained that biographies would become much more legally and financially difficult to publish. A brief for the PEN American Center and the Authors Guild expressed the publishing industry's \"confusion, consternation and concern\" at the outcome. The American historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. called the decision \"a great sadness\", arguing that had it been made earlier, he could not have published all three volumes of his history \"The Age of Roosevelt\".\n\nIn the end, Henry Holt abandoned the litigation, as the ongoing legal costs were becoming unsupportable. The print run of \"Bare-faced Messiah\" in the U.S. was ended after only 14,000 copies were printed. Many went to public libraries, but, according to Miller, numerous library copies of the book went missing or had inserts pasted into them by Scientologists.\n\nReviews of \"Bare-faced Messiah\" were overall very positive, though some reviewers criticised what they regarded as omissions\non Miller's part. The Church of Scientology was highly critical of the book. Its view of Miller's book was summed up by the executor of the Hubbard estate, who called it \"a scumbag book ... full of bullshit\", while a Scientology spokesperson in Canada compared it to \"a life of Christ [written] by Judas Iscariot.\"\nThe American science writer Martin Gardner's review in \"Nature\" called \"Bare-faced Messiah\" an \"admirable, meticulously documented biography\". Gardner had previously written about the start of Scientology in his classic 1952 book \"Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science\", at which time he regarded Hubbard as a harmless crank, but Miller's book persuaded Gardner that Hubbard was \"a pathological liar who steadily deteriorated from a charming rogue into a paranoid egomaniac\".\n\nSociologist J. Gordon Melton wrote that along with Stewart Lamont's \"Religion Inc.,\" Miller's book is \"by far the best\" among the books published by Scientology critics, though he notes that the Church of Scientology has \"prepared statements on each [substantive statement] indicating factual errors and omissions.\" Melton concludes that Miller's book is compromised by its author's lack of access to documents charting Hubbard's life and the early history of the church. Melton disputes Miller's assertion that Hubbard was lying about his military career: \"Hubbard left the service in February 1946 with twenty-one citations, letters of commendation, and medals on his record. The details of Hubbard's naval career have been called into question by the critics of Scientology. Critics rely on an alleged copy of Hubbard's notice of separation deposited in the Veteran's Administration and accessible through the Freedom of Information Act.\" However, the document on which the Church of Scientology bases its claim of twenty-one awards is a forgery, according to US government archivists, and lists ships and medals that did not exist.\n\nWriting for the \"Marburg Journal of Religion\", the German Protestant theologian and history of religion scholar Marco Frenschkowski called \"Bare-Faced Messiah\" the \"most important critical biography of Hubbard. Like [Friedrich-Wilhelm Haack's \"Scientology — Magie des 20. Jahrhunderts\"] and [Bent Corydon's \"\"] it is extremely polemical and very much tries to pull Hubbard to pieces.\" He added that Miller's book had \"definitely exposed some inflated statements about Hubbard's early achievements,\" but the Church of Scientology has been able to counter a number of the points made by Miller: \"Hubbard's assertions about his military career in WWII, e.g., have been much nearer to the truth than Miller is trying to show ... (a complete set of the relevant documents is part of my collection).\" Miller states that he was unable to confirm the existence of Hubbard's mentor, Joseph \"Snake\" Thompson, but Frenschkowski confirms Hubbard's account that Thompson was an actual Commander in the US Navy Medical Corps and a personal friend of Sigmund Freud. Miller states that Hubbard was a disciple of Aleister Crowley, with the implication that Scientology derives from Crowley's teachings, but Frenschkowski concludes, \"Nevertheless it remains quite obvious that Hubbard did not take much inspiration from Crowley and Parsons.\"\n\nWriting in \"Kingdom of the Cults\", an overview of new religious movements written from a Christian perspective, Walter Ralston Martin commented that of the various books on Hubbard's life, \"none are so thoroughly damaging to his credentials\" as \"Bare-faced Messiah\" and Bent Corydon's book. The British science fiction author and critic David Langford rated Miller's book as \"altogether more even-toned and better-written\" and argued that it \"deserves to be a standard reference\" on the life of Hubbard. Sociologist David G. Bromley described the book as \"among the most significant\" accounts of Hubbard's life. Janet Reitman, who documented the history of Scientology in her 2011 book \"\", called \"Bare-faced Messiah\" \"the best and most comprehensive biography of L. Ron Hubbard.\"\nMalise Ruthven observed in the \"Times Literary Supplement\" that Miller \"forces no thesis on his readers, allowing them to draw their own conclusion from the facts he uncovers.\" He took this as both a strength and a weakness of the book, in that it leaves open the question of whether Hubbard was a deliberate con-man or sincerely deluded. He also expressed frustration that Miller had not explained how Hubbard had achieved such a following, but complimented the author's meticulous research in separating fact from fiction. The satirical magazine \"Private Eye\" described the book as \"meticulously documented\" but observed that the author \"does not theorise, nor even very often moralise. The reader must provide his own interjections, laughter and gasps of astonishment.\"\n\nThe \"Sunday Times\" described the book as \"admirably written, well documented and it must have entailed a great deal of painstaking research.\" It praised Miller for standing up to Scientologists' attempts to discredit him. The \"New Statesman\" praised \"Bare-faced Messiah\" as accessibly written and diligently researched but, like \"Private Eye\", criticised it for not illuminating why people find Scientology appealing. Patrick Skene Catling's review in \"The Spectator\" recommended the book \"unreservedly\", calling it \"an unsurpassably scathing study of money-mad, power-mad megalomania.\" Peter Conrad, in \"The Observer\", was generally complimentary about the book, but criticised Miller for omitting \"the recognition of Hubbard's topicality. Miller treats him as a loony and a freak; in fact he was a morbid symptom of America itself\". The psychologist and TV presenter Anthony Clare listed \"Bare-faced Messiah\" in \"The Times\" as one of his books of the year for 1987, commenting that it was \"a testament to the gullibility of man in the face of the charlatanry of Scientology\", while the film and literary critic Tom Hutchinson complimented Miller for \"fascinatingly recount[ing]\" what he described as Hubbard's \"bizarre career.\"\n\nIn Canada, David Todd of news magazine \"Maclean's\" commended the way that Miller had \"arriv[ed] at a portrait of [Scientology's] founder that is by turns hilarious and deeply unsettling\", commenting that \"while scathingly critical of Hubbard and his church, \"Bare-Faced Messiah\" is, in fact, scrupulously fair.\" Michael Harrison of the Toronto \"Financial Post\" criticised the book for \"lack[ing] a critical perspective beyond the requisite snide commentary\" and professed himself disappointed by Miller's avoidance of the question of whether Hubbard was \"genuine or just a fraud\", which Harrison considered an important omission \"since the questions of selfishness, integrity and motivation are key issues in biographies of people who suffer from the messiah-complex.\".\n\nThe \"Sydney Morning Heralds\" Judith White called the book \"absorbing\" and \"well documented and graphically told.\" Alan Roberts wrote in the Adelaide \"Advertiser\" that \"Bare-faced Messiah\" was a \"minutely researched, densely evidenced account\" of the \"endless catalogue of deception, distortion and psychopathological mendacity\" perpetrated by Hubbard and \"almost tediously chronicled\" by Miller. The Brisbane \"Sunday Mails\" reviewer characterised the book as \"entertaining reading that packs a mighty punch\", in which the impact was delivered by \"Miller's careful and professional research which is evident in the manner he builds the man up and then knocks him down, fact by fact.\"\n\nThe \"Oregon Law Review\" described \"Bare-faced Messiah\" as \"a revealing, enthralling biography of a controversial public figure.\" Charles Platt, writing in the \"Washington Post\", called the book \"impressively thorough\" though he chided Miller for \"miss[ing] no opportunity to poke fun at Hubbard. Indeed, he belittles the man so thoroughly, the exercise almost begins to seem pointless.\" He noted that in advance of the publication of his review, the Church of Scientology had sent his newspaper \"a large package of documents intending to refute many of Miller's statements.\" His review was subsequently disputed by the Church of Scientology International's vice president, Brian Anderson, who denounced the book in a letter to the newspaper, claiming that it had been \"obviously calculated to make a quick buck capitalizing on L. Ron Hubbard's name\" and was a \"fast and shoddy\" work. In response, Platt pointed out that \"[Miller] does not dispute the success of L. Ron Hubbard's work; he merely presents evidence that suggests fraud. This is the point of Russell Miller's book, and I find it significant that Brian Anderson makes no attempt to answer it.\"\n\n\nA summary of the book was published in the \"Arts & Leisure\" section of the \"Sunday Times\" over the course of three articles.\n\nExtracts also appeared in \"The Weekend Australian\" and the \"Toronto Star\".\n\n\n\n\nFull text\nReference material\n\nAuthor interview\n"}

The AEA was established in 1885 in Saratoga, New York by younger progressive economists trained in the German historical school, including Richard T. Ely, Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman and Katharine Coman, the only woman co-founder; since 1900 it has been under the control of academics.\n\nThe purposes of the Association are: 1) The encouragement of economic research, especially the historical and statistical study of the actual conditions of industrial life; 2) The issue of publications on economic subjects; 3) The encouragement of perfect freedom of economic discussion. The Association as such will take no partisan attitude, nor will it commit its members to any position on practical economic questions.\n\nOnce composed primarily of college and university teachers of economics, the Association now attracts an increasing number of members from business and professional groups. Today the membership is about 18,000, over half of whom are academics. About 15% are employed in business and industry, and the remainder largely by federal, state, and local government or other not-for-profit organizations.\n\nFor many years, the AEA published three economics journals: the \"American Economic Review\", the \"Journal of Economic Literature\", and the \"Journal of Economic Perspectives\" (which is available online for free). In 2009, it began to publish four new area-specific journals, collectively called the \"American Economic Journal\" (\"AEJ\"). The four areas covered by \"AEJ\" are applied economics, economic policy, macroeconomics, and microeconomics. The AEA recognizes annually a Best Paper Award for papers published in each of the four.\n\nThe AEA also produces \"EconLit\", the AEA's electronic bibliography. It is a comprehensive index to peer-reviewed journal articles, books, book reviews, collective volume articles, working papers, and dissertations. Compiled and abstracted in a searchable format, \"EconLit\" indexes 125 years of economic literature from around the world. It follows the JEL classification codes of the \"Journal of Economic Literature\".\n\nThe AEA sponsors \"RFE: Resources for Economists on the Internet\", an online source available to the general public without subscription.

She served with the Red Cross as a medical auxiliary officer and interpreter during World War II, following British Army forces in 1944-5 across parts of newly liberated Europe. In 1946, she married Jan Szumigalski, (d. 1985) a former officer in the Polish Army, and lived with him in north Wales before immigrating to Canada in 1951. They had four children: Kate (born 1946), Elizabeth (1947), Tony (1961) and Mark (1963). She spent the rest of her life in Saskatchewan, first in the remote Big Muddy valley, then in Saskatoon.\n\nMost of her fifteen books are collections of poetry, but she also wrote a memoir, \"The Voice, the Word, the Text\" (1990) as well as \"Z.\", a play about the Holocaust. Her first book, \"Woman Reading in Bath\" (1974), was published by Doubleday in New York. Thereafter she made the deliberate choice to publish her work with Canadian presses. She helped found the Saskatchewan Writers Guild and the literary journal \"Grain\", and served as a mentor to many younger writers.\n\nSzumigalski combined a love of the Canadian Prairies with a passion for language, a faith in poetry and an intimate knowledge of literary tradition. She was a great admirer of William Blake, some of whose visionary qualities appear in her own work.\n\nHer finest work is collected in a big volume of selected poems, \"On Glassy Wings\" (Coteau, 1997). In 2006 her literary executor Mark Abley edited a volume of her posthumous poems, \"When Earth Leaps Up.\" A final posthumous book is expected in 2010.\n\nThe Manitoba Writers Guild has set up a scholarship in her name. The Saskatchewan Book Award for Poetry is named for her. Her papers are held at the University of Regina, and University of Saskatchewan.\n\nIn 1989, she was awarded the Saskatchewan Order of Merit. Her 1995 collection \"Voice\", featuring paintings by Marie Elyse St. George, won the Governor General's Award for English language poetry. She also received many other honours over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\"Z\" is thus, in my estimation, a major dramatic achievement. Szumigalski’s integration\nof poetry, dance and drama is so effective that she has managed to put an experience on\nstage which not only makes you think about the horrors of the past but also about the\ncallousness and dangers of the present. She sounds a wake-up bell, telling us to stay\nvigilant.\n\nIt's a strange feeling to be giving the Anne Szumigalski Lecture for the League of Canadian Poets.

{"id": "2236132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236132", "title": "Showcase (Canadian TV channel)", "text": "Showcase (Canadian TV channel)\n\nShowcase is a Canadian English-language specialty channel owned by Corus Entertainment. The channel deals primarily in scripted television series and films and was well known in its early years for featuring unconventional and often risqué programming.\n\nLicensed in 1994, Showcase was a venture between Alliance Communications (prior to its merger with Atlantis), the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and a number of smaller independent Canadian producers, and was intended to be a showcase for \"the best of independently-produced movies, drama, comedy and mini-series from Canada and around the world\", with limited content from the United States. It launched at midnight on January 1, 1995, with a short introductory montage and its first program, \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\", shown as part of its program \"The Showcase Revue\".\nWhen the network launched, it garnered some negative publicity due to a disclaimer that it would broadcast prior to reruns of older series. The disclaimer, which advised viewers to remember that \"attitudes were not always the same as they are now\" was applied to relatively recent programs such as \"Seeing Things\". Following media scorn and accusations of political correctness and being condescending to viewers, Showcase abandoned this form of disclaimer.\n\nShowcase later spawned two digital television services, the male-oriented Action (formerly Showcase Action, which was relaunched into the Canadian version of Adult Swim in April 2019 ) and the more female-oriented Showcase Diva (which was relaunched as a Canadian version of Lifetime in 2012). On December 19, 2006 Alliance Atlantis launched a high definition simulcast of Showcase. Only one HD feed, simulcasting the East feed, launched prior to the shutdown of the West feed. It is carried on all major Canadian television service providers.\n\nAfter several acquisitions over the years, Alliance Atlantis gained full control of Showcase. On January 18, 2008, a joint venture between Canwest and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners known as CW Media bought Alliance Atlantis and gained AAC's interest in Showcase. Following its acquisition by Canwest, the channel's new management felt that Showcase's adult programming was alienating viewers and advertisers. In August 2009, Showcase underwent a major rebranding, introducing a new programming lineup with a greater focus on hit dramas and films. Canwest executives hoped that the new lineup would make the channel more attractive to viewers and advertisers.\n\nWhile Showcase continues to air a thematically broad range of drama programming, its most recent successes, especially in original programming, have been with science fiction and fantasy programming. In 2010, a new original series, the supernatural crime drama \"Lost Girl\", brought the channel its highest-rated series premiere ever with around 400,000 viewers. This was bested less than two years later by the debut of another original sci-fi series, \"Continuum\", which had an average audience of 900,000 viewers. On October 27, 2010, ownership changed again as Shaw Communications gained control of Showcase as a result of its acquisition of Canwest and Goldman Sachs' interest in CW Media.\n\nFor the Fall 2013 season, Showcase unveiled a new tagline and branding campaign: \"Character is Everything\". The four-week marketing campaign was highlighted by promos narrated by characters from Showcase's series in first-person. An interactive website was created by Stitch Media. On it, viewers can create their own trailers for Showcase programming based their own character. To coincide with the campaign, Showcase tweaked some of its on-air graphics.\n\nOn March 30, 2015, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the network's launch, Showcase underwent a brand refresh, including a new logo — an updated version of the network's logo from 2000 — and a new slogan: \"Beyond Ordinary\".\n\nFrom the beginning, Showcase has aired reruns of Canadian series, with the lineup changing from year to year, along with foreign series and independent films. It's known for carrying numerous TV series from American cable channels such as TNT and Syfy. In recent years, the channel has also increasingly aired second window repeats of both premium and network television series (the latter primarily sourced from its sister television network, Global).\n\nShowcase has also aired first-run Canadian series, dubbed \"Showcase Originals\". In the past, these have included \"Paradise Falls\", \"KinK\", and \"Naked Josh\". Another of these shows, the low-budget \"Trailer Park Boys\" became a bona fide national phenomenon, spawning DVDs, merchandising tie-ins, and two feature films (\"\" and \"\"). The success of \"Trailer Park Boys\" led to the increasing prominence of edgy and risqué programming on Showcase (which at the time used the tagline \"Television Without Borders\"), including a block consisting entirely of its eroticism-themed shows known as \"Fridays Without Borders\". In recent years, Showcase has partaken in international co-productions.\n\nThe channel was formerly subject to a condition of licence obligating it to air 100% Canadian content between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. in the time zone of the originating feed (currently Eastern Time only). While some foreign programming did air in the late afternoon prior to this window, any foreign programming subject to watershed restrictions was required to air at 10:00 p.m. EST or later. For a few years beginning in fall 2005, when the channel was drawing most of its highest ratings for programming acquired from U.S. cable networks, Showcase promoted 10:00 p.m. as its flagship timeslot, even hiring branded taxis in major markets to drive people home for free by 10:00 p.m. In March 2015, the CRTC announced it would no longer enforce conditions of licence related to nature of service; shortly thereafter, Showcase began airing foreign content in the 7-10 p.m. EST window for the first time.\n\nThe channel previously operated two timeshifted feeds operating on Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The West feed was discontinued on August 24, 2012; since then, much of the channel's primetime programming has been rebroadcast on a three-hour delay to facilitate consistent promotion to both time zones (for example, if a program broadcasts at 9:00 p.m. EST and rebroadcasts at midnight EST, it would be promoted as airing at \"9:00 p.m. E/P\").\n\n\"Includes programs co-commissioned with international broadcasters.\"\n"}

The film is a sequel to \"The Paleface\" (1948). Written by Tashlin, Joseph Quillan, and Robert L. Welch, the film is about a man who returns home to claim his father's gold, which is nowhere to be found. \"Son of Paleface\" was released in the United States by Paramount Pictures on July 14, 1952.\n\nPeter \"Junior\" Potter (Hope) has graduated from Harvard and heads west to the western town of Sawbuck Pass to claim his father's fortune. Driving into town in a jalopy, wearing a comical plaid suit, he splashes mud all over a crowd of townspeople. He discovers to his horror that practically everyone in town claims to be owed money by his father, and that his father's treasure chest is empty.\n\nStrutting around town in his dramatic red and white striped Harvard blazer, Junior stalls the townfolk for as long as he can, continually making allusions to his wealth. An old-timer, Eb, convinces him the gold does exist, but it is hidden.\n\nIn the saloon, he makes the acquaintance of a singing cowboy named Roy (Rogers) and a sexy saloon performer with the masculine name of Mike (Russell), who has to fend off Junior's persistent advances. In the bar Mike and Roy sin Buttons and Bows while Potter raps about Harvard.\n\nJunior tries to romance Mike and she drugs him. While he is asleep she assumes her alter ego of \"The Torch\" and leads her gang in a night time raid. Junior provides a perfect alibi. The townsfolk have sabotaged Junior's car but he improvises and adds cart wheels to escape the town. He drives across the desrt with two vultures hitching a ride. He goes to the ghost town of Sterling City. He finds Eb dead in a barber's chair. Roy arrives and accuses him of murder. Junior disguises himself as Roy to try to escape on Trigger. Roy is a government agent with a Smith & Wesson Model 320 Revolving Rifle hidden in his guitar case, bent on capturing her.\n\nThe town is attacked by indians. Junior is at first too scared to fight and Roy fights alone. Paleface's ghost appears and convinces him that hell is fine. He grabs a gun and starts firing. Firing from the barber's chair it starts to spin with shots going in random directions. One shot hits a moose head where his father's gold begins to pour out. Mike arrives and helps the fight. Mike and Junior escape on his improvised car.\n\nRoy fights the gang in their hideout in an abandoned mine. With a bit of accidental help from Junior they win.\n\nJunior is waiting for Mike when she comes out of prison (with four Junior Juniors). They say goodbye to Roy as Trigger has a triumphant rear silhouetted against the sunset.\n\n\nThe first choice Bob Hope wanted for the female lead was Maureen O'Hara but she turned the film down.\n\nThe film was the third most popular movie at the British box office in 1952.\n"}

{"id": "2236160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236160", "title": "Whangarei Airport", "text": "Whangarei Airport\n\nWhangarei Airport is a small airport to the south east of Whangarei city, in the suburb of Onerahi, on the east coast of Northland in the North Island of New Zealand. The airport has a single terminal with two gates.\n\nThe first aerodrome in Whangarei was located on Pohe Island, in the upper reaches of Whangarei Harbour. Sir Charles Kingsford Smith's aircraft, the \"Southern Cross\", landed on Pohe Island in 1928. This airstrip was not of high quality due to it being built on boggy reclaimed land, so a more suitable site was required. Another site was considered, at Kensington Park, but in May 1939 the current site was opened at Onerahi.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, immediately after the establishment of the airfield, the airport was taken over by the RNZAF to serve as a training base which became RNZAF Station Onerahi. Flight Lieutenant \"Lou\" Gates became one of the station commanders. Pilots practiced bombing raids on the nearby Matakohe Island and Rat Island. The airport was established with three grass runways. No. 20 Squadron RNZAF was formed there in August 1942 with Hawker Hind biplanes, personnel and aircraft provided from No. 6 (AC) Squadron RNZAF at Milson, Palmerston North. The squadron was disbanded in July 1943 (before being reformed elsewhere later in the war). The station was reduced to two runways (06/24 and 32/14) shortly after the war, and being converted for public use. Some of the old airforce barracks are still present today, having been converted into residential properties.\n\nNAC the National Airways Corporation began twice daily commercial flights between Whangarei and Auckland in 1948, using Lockheed Electra 10 seater aircraft. NAC replaced the Electra in March 1950 with small de Havilland Dominie 6 seater aircraft, as the airport was too small to handle the new Lockheed Lodestar aircraft that was now in use. The aircraft's small size meant it serviced Whangarei with six return flights daily from Auckland. 10,148 people flew to and from Whangarei in 1950. The runway, 06/24 was upgraded and sealed in December 1963 to its current length of 1097 m, to allow NAC to commence commercial flights with the much larger DC3s. A new airport terminal was built on the northern side of the main runway to cater for future growth. A new control tower was also built. The larger capacity of the DC3 meant Whangarei was serviced only twice daily to Auckland, with some flights continuing north onwards to Kaikohe or other Northland airports.\n\nIn August 1970 NAC replaced their DC-3 service to Whangarei with larger Fokker Friendships. Northern Districts Aero Club introduced a twice daily return air taxi service to compete and provide additional frequency to Auckland on each Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The service, which operated under the name of Executive Air Taxis, started on 21 August 1970 using a newly imported Piper Cherokee Six. This service proved to be popular, and was expanded by the end of 1974 to offer a twice daily Monday to Friday morning and afternoon return service to Auckland. Northern Districts Aero Club were able to fund new clubrooms and hangar in 1977.\n\nIn 1988 NAC's successor Air New Zealand announced the withdrawal of their twice-daily Friendship service in favour of their newly purchased subsidiary Eagle Airways offering up to five Embraer Bandeirante flights a day. This led to the decline and eventual end of the Northern Districts Aero Club scheduled flights to Auckland. The control tower was closed down in 1988 as the airport was deemed too small to continue the service.\n\nIn 1991 a new airline, Ansett New Zealand, began flying to Whangarei in competition to Air New Zealand. Both airlines flew Bandeirantes, with Ansett also flying Dash 8's, and the terminal was further upgraded due to this growth.\n\nIn September 1998 Ansett New Zealand withdrew its service. To help meet the demand for additional seats Eagle Airways increased its services by 14 per week, bringing the number of Bandeirante flights to Whangarei to 69 flights. This compared with Air New Zealand's previous service of 14 Friendship flights a week.\n\nIn 2001, Eagle Airways purchased 16 new Beechcraft 1900D aircraft and begun using this aircraft on all routes, retiring the Bandeirante aircraft being used. They were able to introduce new services with the improved aircraft and in 2002 begun direct flights linking Whangarei to Wellington. This service operated twice every week day (until 2009 when it was reduced to one) and was Eagle Airways' longest regular flight service at 626 km with 90 min flight.\n\nIn 2007, Sunair begun daily air services between Whangarei, Tauranga, Rotorua and Napier. This service was discontinued in 2009. Sunair returned to Whangarei in 2015, with a Whangarei to Whitianga via Claris service. This service ceased at the end of 2015 after low patronage.\n\nIn 2008, Salt Air begun an \"xpress\" service between Kerikeri, Whangarei and Auckland. These flights landed at North Shore and transferred passengers to Auckland CBD within 60mins of leaving Whangarei. This service was sold in 2012 to Flight Hauraki and ceased shortly after.\n\nA runway upgrade in 2009 allowed Bombardier Q300 and weight restricted ATR 72 aircraft to begin using the airport.\n\nIn 2011 a Mount Cook Airline ATR 72 landed at Whangarei Airport becoming the first of its kind to do so. The aircraft was on charter from Gisborne.\n\nFrom April 2015, Air New Zealand removed all Beech 1900D flights from the Whangarei schedule, as well as dropping the direct to Wellington service. The flights were taken over by larger Q300 aircraft and they became the sole aircraft flying to Whangarei for Air New Zealand.\n\nIn 2009, airport passenger and flight numbers were increasing steadily reaching a peak of ten return flights to Auckland and two return flights to Wellington on weekdays. This resulted in the airport's capacity reaching a peak of around 140,000 passenger movements per year. However this growth stalled due to global economic downturn, and subsequently capacity and frequency was reduced.\n\nA project costing $1.5 million that created a 30 m takeoff starter extension and resealed the runway surface was completed in April 2009. The upgrade allowed larger aircraft to land and allowed Air New Zealand, through its subsidiary airline Air Nelson, to start trialing flights with their Bombardier Q300 aircraft. Daily flights from Auckland commenced in August 2013 growing in time to be the predominant aircraft used on the Auckland route, before becoming the sole aircraft used in 2014. In August 2011, the previously weight restricted ATR 72 aircraft made its first commercial service to Whangarei Airport on charter from Gisborne, however the aircraft type has not returned since.\n\nWDC are currently looking at potentially moving the airport to a new location, as the current site is too small to expand significantly to meet requirements for larger aircraft in the future. A runway length of between 1200m and 1350m is needed to accommodate aircraft that are likely to be in use beyond the next 10–15 years. A site at Mata, south of Whangarei was considered, but was deemed too far from central Whangarei to be viable. Another site at the former location of Port Whangarei is being mooted in 2014, but a move is not considered likely due to operational requirements and cost. If a decision is reached to move the airport it will not be before 2025, and will have to overcome great cost and uncertainty surrounding the demand for such a large airport in relative proximity to Auckland.\n\nOn 30 June 2015 an upgrade to the airport costing $1.02 million was announced. The aircraft taxiway was expanded to accommodate the bigger aircraft that are operating at the airport now, as well as improvements to pathways outside the terminal and the taxi stand. A second airport entry was constructed and the car park was extended with a barrier arm installed. Improvements within the terminal included more seating for passengers, upgraded toilets and the internal baggage claim area was expanded. \nWork began in July 2015 with the last of the upgrades completed by Mid-September 2016. The work enabled the airport to be kept to an acceptable and modern standard for the next 15 years, when possible relocation of the airport may take place. \n\nThe airport has a modern air-conditioned terminal building with free wifi and a cafeteria (called The Apron), which services Air New Zealand's subsidiary, Air Nelson. The terminal was recently upgraded to include a glass walk-through tunnel, to protect passengers from the weather when accessing the tarmac parking gates 1-2. The airport terminal has secure parking, and three rental car companies.\n\nWhangarei District Airport no longer has an Aero Club due to a drop in membership and private flying. Flight training using micro-light aircraft is still available after through the Whangarei Flying Club which merged with the Northern District Aeroclub when it closed down, and Sports Flying Academy located in hangar 8. A tandem and sport skydiving company (Skydive Ballistic Blondes) operates from their base on Domain Road. Helicopter operators Skywork and Twin Coast Helicopters both operate from the airport. One aircraft maintenance facility (Northland Aviation Ltd) is available, which conducts maintenance for airlines and many aircraft across Northland. Private jets are also catered for when they arrive about twice a year, as well as larger group charters which are fairly common. \nBP provide Jet A1 and AVGAS on field for aviators. Since 2006, an AWIB (Aerodrome Weather Information Broadcast) system has been broadcast on 119.8.\n\n\n\n"}

He is regarded as one of Maccabi Tel Aviv's greatest players ever. Until 2006, he served as the captain of the Israeli national football team. His number 8 shirt has become so symbolic (despite him wearing the number sixteen as a youth, because Uri Malmilian wore the number 8) that the club has retired the number at the end of his active football career.\n\nNimni was approximately seven years old when he joined Maccabi Tel Aviv's training facility in Kiryat Shalom. Nimni played for every Maccabi youth team and also featured for the Israeli national youth sides.\n\nAt 17 he played his first game in the Liga Leumit and was a regular for Maccabi's first team at 18. Whilst at Maccabi Nimni experienced much success becoming one of their most important players during this period.\n\nIn 1998, he inherited the Maccabi captaincy when the previous long-serving captain Nir Klinger retired due to injury. Klinger went on to become assistant coach at Maccabi.\n\nBetween the years of 1996–2001, Maccabi suffered dark times on the field winning only the Toto Cup in 1998. This was due partly to the absence of Nimni who was transferred in 1997 to Atlético Madrid. However, Nimni's time at the club was blighted by injury, and he returned to Maccabi after just seven appearances.\n\nA year later Nimni was loaned out to Derby County. Although Nimni set up a goal on his debut and also scored away to Everton, in what subsequently proved to be a handful of appearances, Derby decided not to purchase Nimni outright. They instead signed fellow loanee Giorgi Kinkladze to ensure they had no more than three non-EU first-team players, and Nimni returned to Maccabi.\n\nIn 2000, the former Israel national coach, Shlomo Sharf, became Maccabi's coach. Sharf, well known for his temper, commented after the second game of the season in Maccabi's 2–2 draw with Hapoel Haifa saying \"did you even see Nimni? I'm sure he didn't play! If it wasn't for the fans I would have substituted him at half-time\". The next day Nimni spoke to Channel Five, replying \"there is a normal way of saying things, not in a humiliating barbaric way\". Sharf wanted to sell Nimni, however the chairman Lonny Herzikowicz declined the request, and Sharf then resigned from his post.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2002 season, Nir Klinger was appointed Head Coach of Maccabi. As a former Maccabi player he was well respected by the fans. He was nicknamed \"The Soul\" for playing in any situation despite being injured on many occasions.\n\nFollowing Maccabi's 3–0 loss at home to Hapoel Be'er Sheva they went to play title holders Maccabi Haifa in the 14th fixture of the season. Klinger shocked the nation by naming Nimni on the bench, and replaced him with Baruch Dego. After an incredible game Maccabi emerged as 3–2 victors. Nimni remained on the bench for the remainder of the season only to watch Dego pick up the player of the season accolade.\n\nAfter the 28th fixture, Nimni gave an interview to a radio show claiming, \"players told me that, if I played we would have had 15 points more\". On hearing this Klinger sent him to the stands dropping him from the squad. During the 30th game of the season Dego broke his ankle with the fixture against Beitar Jerusalem looming. At the time Maccabi were in first place. They had exactly the same points as Maccabi Haifa and Hapoel Tel Aviv but had a better goal difference of the three teams. Beitar took the lead after 32 minutes and doubled their score just a minute later. Beitar went into the half-time break 2–1 up after an own goal a minute before. Maccabi were watching the Championship slip from their grasp. However Nimni had other ideas and scored two goals leading Maccabi to a 3–2 win.\n\nIn the 32nd game, Maccabi played Bnei Yehuda and Nimni scored a hat-trick and Maccabi won 5–0. After the match in an interview a reporter asked Klinger about Nimni, Klinger replied \"do you want it in a phrase or a song; Avi Nimni is the king\". In the final game of the season Maccabi faced Hapoel Petah Tikva. 40,000 spectators saw Nimni score leading Maccabi to a 3–0 win. Consequently, they lifted the Championship. Despite being dropped earlier in the season Nimni finished the season as Maccabi's top goalscorer with 14 goals.\n\nHowever, not everything was rosy for Nimni. It was reported that he and teammate Tal Banin (ex-Brescia) had a bust-up. The team was divided between \"Avi Nimni supporters\" and \"Tal Banin supporters\". Nimni, Banin and Klinger all denied the reports that any altercation had occurred.\n\nOn 13 August 2003, Klinger called a press conference to be covered by all the media. He issued a statement along the lines that \"the dispute between Nimni and Banin is destroying every good part in Maccabi, dividing the team, and causing nothing but anger between the players\". He forced both Nimni and Banin out of the club.\n\nThe fans were outraged and for two years they came in black shirts as a sign of grief and holding signs saying: \"8 is in our blood, Avi Nimni will always be in Maccabi\". The fans were not satisfied despite winning the Cup and taking second place in the league resulting in the qualification to the UEFA Champions League for the first time ever.\n\nAfter being kicked out of Maccabi, Nimni joined Beitar Jerusalem. He played at the Teddy Stadium for two years scoring 20 goals.\n\nAfter two years of exile Nimni was brought back to Maccabi in 2005 by Nir Klinger, who resigned later that year.\n\nNimni is considered as Maccabi's talisman and the fan's favourite. He started his comeback season on the right foot, by scoring the winning goal in the opening match of the 2005/06 season. After a bad year when Maccabi only won the State Cup, Nimni moved forward to another year with the yellow side.\n\nThe 2006/07 season was a pretty good year to Avi surely better than the previous. Avi scored in that season 10 goals with his actually last year as a player. Nimni said that he want to retire in the end of the season but a loss to the fierce rivals in the local derby Hapoel Tel Aviv made him consider his retirement and he decided to stay for another year.\n\nNimni's last year started with a loss the Andorra Santa Coloma. On 25 August 2007 Nimni Scored his last goal for the Israeli Premier league on the second fixture versus Maccabi Petah Tikva and became the third all time scorer. After that Avi was injured in the Toto Cup that put him out for the rest of the year.\n\nOn 17 May 2008 Avi Nimni played his last match when he entered on the 90-minute to the crowd's roar; some of the people even cried. After Nimni retired, Maccabi Tel Aviv decided to retire his shirt, too.\n\nNimni is Maccabi's all-time top goalscorer, having scored 174 goals. He has scored 194 goals overall in the league, and he is now the number three all-time top goal scorer in Israeli football.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her family moved to British Columbia when she was nine, settling in the Fraser valley community of Haney. Jacks began her professional career at 15 when she was asked to be a regular performer on the national Canadian television show, \"Music Hop\". She also appeared on several other national television shows and regularly did live performances in the British Columbia and Alberta areas. She recorded her first singles with two other well known Vancouver performers, Howie Vickers and Tom Northcott, under the name of \"The Eternal Triangle\".\n\nIn 1966, 18-year-old Susan Pesklevits asked Terry Jacks to accompany her on guitar for an upcoming appearance. Susan performed a small number of dates with Terry accompanying her on guitar. They decided to add Craig McCaw on lead guitar and, although she continued to make various solo television appearances, Susan made the decision to stop performing live as a solo artist, left the \"Eternal Triangle\" and dedicated her time to the newly formed trio. The trio used the name \"Powerline\" for a number of months before settling on the name \"The Poppy Family\". Susan and Terry married in 1967. Craig McCaw introduced Satwant Singh to the group and he soon joined the trio on tablas.\n\nThe group began recording as \"The Poppy Family featuring Susan Jacks\" and had a number of hits from 1968 through the early 1970s. \"Which Way You Goin' Billy?\", originally called \"Which Way You Goin' Buddy?\", was written from a male perspective but was re-written at Susan's suggestion to be sung by a female. Susan's brother Billy's name was chosen to replace \"Buddy\" and the song went on to sell nearly 4 million copies worldwide, hitting No. 1 in Canada, No. 1 in \"Cashbox\" and No. 2 in \"Billboard\" in the United States. \"That's Where I Went Wrong\" and \"Where Evil Grows\" also charted well on Billboard. They consequently followed up with numerous hits in Canada. Terry released Satwant Singh and Craig McCaw from the group in 1970 and, although the name Poppy Family was still used, Susan essentially became a solo artist, with the exception of one or two duets with Terry. She often performed Poppy Family hits on numerous television shows including \"Rollin' On The River\", \"The Bobby Darin Show\" and \"The George Kirby Special\".\n\nIn 1972, the Poppy Family name was dropped and Susan and Terry worked together in the studio to record their solo albums. Susan's album was titled \"I Thought of You Again\" and Terry's titled \"Seasons in the Sun\". Both albums were released in 1973 after Susan left the marriage. The title song on Susan's album earned her a nomination for Canadian Female Vocalist of the Year.nominated for a Juno Award as Male Vocalist of the Year. Susan continued to have hits and other Juno nominations in Canada with songs including \"I Thought of You Again\", \"Anna Marie\", \"Forever\", \"All The Tea in China\", \"Evergreen\", \"You Don't Know What Love Is\", \"I Want You To Love Me\", \"Build A Tower\", \"Love Has No Pride\", and \"Another Woman's Man\". With the release of her \"Dream\" album in 1975, Susan was nominated for her single \"Anna Marie\". \n\nIn 1976, Jacks signed with Polydor Records. Her 1980 \"Ghosts\" album garnered her a Juno nomination with her single \"All The Tea in China\". In 1982 her \"Forever\" album was released. As a solo artist, she appeared regularly on tour as well as television shows including \"The Bobby Vinton Show\", the Allan Thicke Show and numerous talk shows. She was also featured in a special called \"Caught in the Act\" and in a Christmas special at Whistler Mountain.\n\nIn 1977, Susan met Canadian Football League player Ted Dushinski. They married in 1980 and had a son, Thad. The family moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1983 where she recorded the Juno-nominated song, \"Another Woman's Man\". She was voted the best new country artist in Oklahoma for her song \"Tall Dark Stranger\". She became a staff songwriter for a Nashville publishing company and has had several songs recorded, including a children's song on a Grammy nominated album entitled \"Snuggle Up\". Susan would later co-write and sing \"Looking For Love\" for the movie \"The Last Chance Cafe\".\n\nIn 2004, Jacks returned to Canada when her husband was diagnosed with lung cancer. Ted died on 24 October 2005. Upon returning, she was told she was in kidney failure and performed on a limited basis as her strength deteriorated. In 2010, Susan received a kidney transplant when her brother Billy donated a kidney to her. A few months after the transplant, Jacks was again on stage and on 17 April 2011 performed a benefit concert for the Kidney Foundation of Canada to raise awareness of the need for organ donation.\n\nJacks was inducted into the BC Entertainment Hall of Fame on 27 June 2010. Her album \"Dream\", originally released in 1976, but abruptly removed from the market, was re-released in 2015. In 2016 Susan was hospitalized with life threatening complications from kidney failure. After a miraculous recovery, she is returning to the studio and stage, recording a new album in 2018. \n\n"}

This type of plastic is formed by dissolving gas under high pressure into various polymers, relying on \"thermodynamic instability phenomena\" to cause the uniform arrangement of the gas bubbles, otherwise known as nucleation. Its main purpose was to reduce material usage while maintaining valuable mechanical properties. The main room for variance in these foams is the gas used to create them; the density of the finished product is determined by the gas used. Depending on the gas used, the density of the foam can lie between 5% and 99% that of the pre-processed plastic. Design parameters, focused more on the final form of the foam and the molding process afterward, include the type of die or mold to be used, as well as the dimensions of the bubbles, or cells, that classify this material as a foam. Since the size of cells is close to the wavelength of light, to the casual observer this foam retains the appearance of a solid light colored plastic.\n\nRecent developments at the University of Washington have produced nanocellular foams. These foams are characterized by cell sizes in the 20-100 nanometer range. Also at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, new technologies are being developed to fabricate high quality microcellular foams.\n\nPrior to 1974, traditional foams were created using a method outlined in U.S Patent named \"Mixing of Molten Plastic and Gas\" in 1974. By releasing a gas, otherwise known as a chemical or physical blowing agent, over molten plastic, hard plastic was converted into traditional foam. The results of these methods were highly undesirable. Due to the uncontrolled nature of the process, the product was often non-uniform, housing many large voids. In turn, the outcome was a low strength, low density foam, with large cells in the cellular structure. The pitfalls of this method drove the need for a process that could make a similar material with more advantageous mechanical properties.\n\nThe creation of microcellular foams as we know today was inspired by the production of traditional foams. In 1979, MIT masters students J.E. Martini and F.A Waldman, under the direction of Professor Nam P Suh, are both accredited with the invention of microcellular plastics, or microcellular foams. By doing pressurized extrusion and injection molding, their experimentation led to a method that used significantly less material and a product with 5-30% less voids that were less than 8 microns in size. In terms of mechanical properties, the fracture toughness of the material improved by 400% and the resistance to crack propagation increased by 200%. First, plastic is uniformly saturated with gas at a high pressure. Then, the temperature is increased, causing thermal instability in the plastic. In order to reach a stable state, cell nucleation takes place. During this step, the cells created would be much smaller than that of traditional foams. After this, cell growth, or matrix relaxation would initiate. The novelty of this method was the ability to control the mechanical properties of the product by varying the temperature and pressure inputs. For example, by modifying the pressure, a very thin outside layer could be formed, making the product even stronger. Experimental results found CO2 to be the gas that produced the densest foams. Other gases, such as Argon and Nitrogen produced foams with mechanical properties that were slightly less desirable.\n\nWhen selecting a gas to produce the desired foam, functional requirements and design parameters are considered. The functional requirements are identical to the criteria used when inventing this material type; using less plastic without sacrificing mechanical properties (especially toughness) that are capable of making the same three dimensional products the original plastic was able to do.\n\nThe production of microcellular plastics is dependent on temperature and pressure. Dissolving gas under high temperature and pressure creates a driving force that activates nucleation sites when the pressure drops, which increases exponentially with amount of dissolved gas.\n\nHomogeneous nucleation is the primary mechanism for producing the bubbles in the cellular matrix. The dissolved gas molecules have a preference to diffuse to activation sites that have nucleated first. This is prevented since these sites are activated nearly simultaneously, forcing the dissolved gas molecules to be shared equally and uniform throughout the plastic.\n\nRemoving the plastic from the high pressure environment creates a thermodynamic instability. Heating the polymer above the effective glass transition temperature (of the polymer/gas mixture) then causes the plastic to foam, creating a very uniform structure of small bubbles.\n\nThe density of microcellular plastics has the greatest influence on the behavior and performance. The material tensile strength linearly decreases with the material density as more gas is dissolved into the part. Melting temperature and viscosity also decrease as well.\n\nThe foam injection process itself introduces surface defects such as swirl marks, streaking, and blistering, which also influence how the part reacts to external forces.\n\nDue to the non-hazardous nature of this foam-generating process, these plastics are able to be recycled and put back into the production cycle, reducing their carbon footprint as well as reducing the cost of raw materials.\n\nWith the porous nature of this material, the overall density is much lower than that of any solid plastic, considerably dropping the weight per unit volume of the part. This also entails less consumption of raw plastic with the addition of the tiny gas-filled pockets, allowing for further cost reduction, up to 35%.\n\nWhen observing the mechanical properties of these foams, a loss of tensile strength is correlated with the decrease in density, in a nearly linear fashion.\n\nSince the steps taken by MIT research in the late 70s, microcellular plastics, and their methods of manufacturing, has become more standardized and improved upon. Trexel Inc. is often referred to as the industry standard for microcellular plastics with their use of MuCell® Molding Technology. Trexel, and other manufacturers of microcellular plastics, use both injection molding and blow mold methods to create products for applications such as automotive, medical, packaging, consumer, and industrial.\n\nInjection molding and blow molding differ in regards to the type of product in need of being manufactured. Injection molding, much like casting, is centered around creating a mold for a solid object, which is to later be filled in with the molten plastic. Blow molding on the other hand, is more specialized for hollow objects, although it is less accurate regarding wall thickness with this dimension being an undefined feature (unlike in an injection mold where all dimensions are predetermined). In respect to MuCell® and microcellular plastics, these processes vary from that of traditional plastics due to the additional steps of gas dissolving and cell nucleation before the molding process can begin. This process removed the \"pack and hold phase\" that allowed for imperfections within a mold, creating a finished product with greater dimensional accuracy and sound structure. By removing an entire step of the molding process, time is saved, making MuCell® a more economically option since more parts can be manufactured in the same time compared to standard resins. A few examples of applications include automobile instrument panels, heart pumps, storage bins, and the housing on multiple household power tools.\n\n"}

She was fitted out on November 1, 1967, and delivered in October 1968. The sea trials took place in September 1968. Her designers were the Montreal design firm of German & Milne. Her owner was the Canadian National Railway (CN), operator of the Borden-Tormentine service from 1918–1977.\n\nBeginning in May 1972, \"John Hamilton Gray\" was used during the peak travel season on CN's Cabot Strait services from North Sydney to Channel-Port aux Basques and Argentia. The seasonal service to Newfoundland typically lasted until November, whereby \"John Hamilton Gray\" would return to the Northumberland Strait service for the winter icebreaking season where she served alongside . Her summer participation in the Newfoundland service ended in September 1988 in advance of 's entry into service in 1989.\n\nIn 1977, CN created a subsidiary CN Marine to operate its ferry services. In 1986, CN Marine changed its name to Marine Atlantic, the last operator of the ferry service between Borden and Cape Tormentine.\n\nThroughout the 1970s until the new MV \"Abegweit\" entered service in 1982, \"John Hamilton Gray\" was the largest and most powerful ferry on the Northumberland Strait.\n\n\"John Hamilton Gray\" was designed to be compatible with the A Dock at both Borden and Cape Tormentine which was in use by the original MV \"Abegweit\" (and whose design is traced to the SS \"Prince Edward Island\"). \"John Hamilton Gray\" loaded only from the stern on the lower rail/truck deck, however until a modification in the early 1980s (in advance of the arrival of the new MV \"Abegweit\"), the upper car deck was loaded from a side hatch at the stern. The modification in the early 1980s saw the side hatch sealed and a stern loading hatch added.\n\nOn December 31, 1989, \"John Hamilton Gray\" hauled the last railcars and locomotives off Prince Edward Island as CN Rail abandoned its former Prince Edward Island Railway trackage in the province.\n\n\"John Hamilton Gray\" was chartered for two summers by \"Croisières Carleton-les-Îles\", a private ferry company in Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula during 1995 and 1996, running a passenger-vehicle service between Carleton-sur-Mer and Cap-aux-Meules, Quebec in the Magdalen Islands.\n\n\"John Hamilton Gray\" departed the Northumberland Strait for the final time on April 28, 1997, when she headed to Point Edward, Nova Scotia for disposal. The pending opening of the Confederation Bridge on May 31, 1997, would result in the permanent closure of the ferry service and Marine Atlantic only required three vessels (, , and ) during the last month of operation.\n\n\"John Hamilton Gray\" was sold in July 1997 at Point Edward by the Government of Canada's Crown Assets Division to Contessa International, a casino cruise company in the United States.

After extensive touring, Zaraska decided to leave the band to focus on a smaller, less aggressive project named Sleeping Girl, at which point the rest of the band decided to put up an instrumental song on their MySpace page, encouraging anyone who wanted to take over the spot of vocalist to record their own voice over the instrumental and e-mail it to the band. This was the way they found (then) new vocalist Karl Schubach, with whom they recorded the album, \"Mirrors\".\n\nIn July 2008, Misery Signals released their third full-length entitled \"Controller\". After extensive touring in support of \"Controller\" in early 2009, members of Misery Signals wanted to pursue other musical directions outside of their band.\n\nSchubach is involved in a heavy metal side project called Solace. He is the sole member of the band, recording guitar, bass and vocals in a D.I.Y.-fashioned home studio. The drums are added in digitally, through the use of a program on his Macbook. During the funding stages of this side project he provided incentives to individuals and bands in return for financial support using crowd funding platform Kickstarter. As part of this incentive scheme Karl Schubach provided guest vocals on a song by UK metal/hardcore band The Divided.\n\nHardcore/punk band Burning Empires consists of members from Misery Signals, Fall Out Boy and 7 Angels 7 Plagues, with vocalist Ryan Morgan, bassist Kyle Johnson, guitarists Stu Ross and Matthew Mixon, and drummer Andy Hurley. The quintet also owns a clothing line / record label called Fuck City.\n\nMilwaukee-based punk/post-hardcore band Lowtalker consists of Branden Morgan and Stuart Ross of Misery Signals. They team up with Casey Hjelmberg and Matt Keil of Comeback Kid to complete the four-piece project. Lowtalker released their EP \"People Worry About Everything\" in the spring of 2010 through FC records.\n\nIn 2010, Stuart Ross became the frontman of a Vancouver, B.C. pop-punk band Living with Lions. Ross officially left Misery Signals on September 25, 2010 to put his focus on Living with Lions, and was reportedly tired of performing heavy metal. In October 2010, Kyle Johnson also announced his departure from the band.\n\nAfter an extended period of inactivity with a heavy focus on side projects, Misery Signals made an official statement about the state of the band in November 2010. The press release addressed the loss of Ross and Johnson, and also announced that the band had not, in fact, broken up. Ryan Morgan commented that, \"In the next few months, we'll group back up and return.\" On maintaining the continuity of the band's style and keeping the same name, Morgan said, \"Stu and Kyle made awesome contributions, but the trajectory of the band remains the same in their absence. If the time came that our sound took a drastically different course, then it wouldn't be Misery Signals anymore, and we wouldn't pretend that it was.\"\n\nThe first new release from Misery Signals after going through this major line up change was a cover of Pink Floyd's song \"Us and Them\" from the 1973 album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\". The song was contributed to a soundtrack for the video game \"Homefront\", which was released free of charge for digital download on March 22, 2011.\n\nIn April 2011, Karl Schubach posted a couple tweets mentioning band practice, writing new material in June, and said \"We're focusing on bringing the new guys up to speed at the moment.\" The new lineup was finalized and appeared on the \"Crush Em All\" tour fall 2011. In early 2012 the band stated that they were working on new material for the new album. Lead singer Karl Schubach stated in an interview \"I think every band aims to progress with each album they write. But sometimes progression is learning what worked really well the previous records and incorporating those elements. So far these new songs feel like a purposeful blend of our most recent, more structured \"Controller\" record mixed with the chaos and spontaneity of the earlier \"Of Malice and the Magnum Heart\".\" All of the members reunited in the studio the recording the new album, and started an Indiegogo fundraiser to help pay for the recording, marketing, and pressing of the new album, as the band is currently signed to Basick Records.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Misery Signals released \"Absent Light\", with the first single \"Luminary\" being released twenty days earlier.\n\nOn May 30, 2014, news surfaced that Misery Signals announced plans to commemorate the tenth anniversary of their 'Of Malice and the Magnum Heart' album with the \"Malice X Tour\" later that year. The tour featured the band's original lineup, which consisted of Jesse Zaraska (vocals), Ryan Morgan (guitars), Stu Ross (guitars), Kyle Johnson (bass), and Branden Morgan (drums), and Misery Signals performed the album in its entirety.\n\nOn October 19, 2016, rumours of an original lineup reunion tour and album were confirmed by vocalist Jesse Zaraska. When reached for comment by Nic Huber of www.metalinjection.net, Zaraska had the following to say: \"It is the truth, sir. We are in the midst of writing new material together and will be playing some show over the coming year. It has been very cool thus far. We will definitely be doing a proper US tour in 2017.\"\n\nOn March 24, 2018, at the event Midwest Meltdown in Iowa City, Iowa; Misery Signals frontman Jesse Zaraska, announced the band had been holed up on Boise, Idaho over the previous few weeks. He stated that they are, indeed, working on a new album. Zaraska stated on stage, that he believes their newest album \"will be the BEST Misery Signals album yet.\" When asked about the style of the new album, Zaraska replied \"It will probably be a lot like of Malice.\" The album name and release date have not been made public.\n\nOn the \"Death to False Metalcore Tour 2019\" with Darkest Hour and Unearth, the band played a redone song titled \"Sunlifter\" from their Absent Light B-Side vinyl release. Zaraska also stated November 2019 as the release date for their new album.\n\nOn May 8, 2020, a 26 second fixed-camera video of ocean waves, with only the date \"05.15.2020\" appearing center screen at the end of the video, was posted to Misery Signals’ social media accounts, suggesting that new music, or a new album, is set to be announced, and/or released, on that date. \n\nOn May 14, 2020, Misery Signals announced their upcoming fifth studio album, “Ultraviolet”, to be released on August 7, 2020, along with the release of the single “The Tempest” \n\n\n\n\n"}

Her father and brother were also poets.\n\nOne of her best-known poems is \"Några ord till min kära dotter, ifall jag hade någon\" (\"Advice to my dear daughter, if I had one\"). She also wrote on Sweden's class system in the satirical poems against snobbery \"Hans nåds morgonsömn\" (\"His Grace's morning snooze\") and \"Grevinnans besök\" (\"The Countess's visit\").\n\nAnna Maria Lenngren was born in Uppsala as the daughter of the poet Magnus Brynolf Malmstedt (1724–1798), a professor in Latin at Uppsala University, and Märta Johanna Florin (d. 1788). Her father was a member of the Moravian Church and was known for his social work; from 1772, he hosted a school for poor children in his home. Both her parents published hymns, and her brother Johan Magnus (1749–80) wrote secular poems.\n\nAnna Maria Lenngren became set against religion and in favor of the realism of the age of enlightenment through dislike of her father's passionate religious feelings; but her humanism and passion for social justice have also been attributed to her father's influence. In her social views, she felt sympathy for the working classes, opposed the privileges of the nobility and acted as a spokesperson for the \"third estate\", idealizing a simple and humble life style.\n\nHer father observed her talent early on, and stated that he wished to \"make of her not only a literary, but a learned woman\". He gave her an advanced education, and she was tutored at home in Latin and the Classics of antiquity. Her favorite poet was Horace.\n\nShe began her career in poetry with reviews, epitomes, epigrams and translations in the 1770s. Among her earliest works were interpretations of Horace, published anonymously in the press. In 1772, she published her first poem under her own name, the funeral poem '. In 1774–77, she frequently wrote for Anna Hammar-Rosén's paper '.\n\nIn 1776 she was commissioned by Duke Charles, the King of Sweden's brother, for a translation of the French operetta \"Lucile\", the first French operetta translated into Swedish. In its introduction, she defended women's right to intellectual work. It was a success: Lenngren was awarded a golden clock as a token of appreciation by the royal Duchess Charlotte, and was given several similar translation commissions by the royal house.\n\nLenngren enjoyed great success: already in 1774, she was inducted into a literary society in Uppsala, earned good reviews and poetic tributes in the press, became known as a defender of intellectual women, and referred to herself as a \"litterata\". She became a member of the Royal Society of Sciences and Letters in Gothenburg in 1775, and of the Utile Dulci in 1779. She was one of only three women members of the Utile Dulci, the others being Anna Charlotta von Stapelmohr and Anna Brita Wendelius. In 1777, she repeated her demand in favor of women's right to intellectual pursuits in \"Thé-conseillen\".\n\nIn 1780, she married the official Carl Peter Lenngren (1750–1827). He was the chief editor of ', which the famous poet and critic Johan Henric Kellgren and he published. Kellgren worked with Lenngren on several assignments from 1778 onwards, reportedly providing her with inspiration, and sharing an interest in the ideas of Voltaire. She published poems and prose in ' from 1778 onwards, but after her wedding, she only published anonymously, stopping altogether by the end of the 1780s.\n\nHer marriage caused a great change in her life. After her wedding, she officially stopped being active in the literary world, publishing under pseudonyms, renouncing her previous stand in favor of women's intellectual and literary emancipation, and arguing that women should avoid literary pursuits in favor of developing their character as suitable wives and mothers. Whether she was honest in this change of opinion, or was using irony to make a point, has been the subject of debate. Lenngren came to admire Rousseau, and may have come to support his ideas of the role of women in the 1780s, views further supported by the religious values of simplicity and humility in her childhood home. Ingrid Arvidsson argued that Lenngren had a deeply ambivalent view on the subject, affected by her personality: \"The fact that Mrs L was hurt by criticism is evident in several of her poems, but she did also have the more unusual sensitivity of being hurt by admiration\".\n\nAfter her marriage, she hosted a literary salon, which became a center of cultural debate frequented by Gustaf af Leopold, Nils von Rosenstein, Frans Michael Franzén and Gudmund Jöran Adlerbeth. During these years she is described as witty and intelligent but humble and modest. \n\nHer spouse was described as \"principally known as useful and boring\", but the marriage was a happy one, and she used to take him to the Utile Dulci Academy and sing with him. She had no children, but adopted a daughter. In 1797 the daughter was placed in a mental asylum, but died soon after her admission, an event which affected Lenngren deeply, as did the death of her father, who drowned under suspicious circumstances in 1798.\n\nIn 1790, another great change occurred when Johan Henric Kellgren discontinued his literary production because of an illness. This damaged the paper of her spouse and Anna Maria Lenngren resumed her contributions in \" for financial reasons. However, she insisted on staying anonymous and refused to officially resume her career, although unofficially her pseudonyms were known and she was known as the writer of the work which she published during these years, though she insisted on remaining officially anonymous.\n\nHer salon at Beridarebansgatan was the center of the Royal Swedish Academy, and though she was never a formal member, they called her their \"invisible member\". On December 20, 1797, the Royal Swedish Academy celebrated her with the ' (\"Ode to Mrs Lenngren\"), read by Gustaf Fredrik Gyllenborg. She declined their admiration with the poem ' (\"Dream\"), in which she described how the poet Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht had appeared to her and deemed her unworthy. However, she signed \" with her own name, the first that she had written under her own name since her marriage, and her last.\n\nLenngren died of breast cancer aged 62, and was buried in Stockholm's Klara kyrka cemetery.\n\nAnna Maria Lenngren debuted as a writer of poems for funerals and weddings, and her earliest work has a tone of the ecstatic passion common in the religious circles of her father. This was however quickly replaced by a more sober tone in line with the scientific sense and realism of the age of enlightenment.\n\nAs a writer, Lenngren frequently used satire, sarcasm, and irony, and she often made parodied the genre of pastoral, opera and ballad. Her verse was often short, portraying everyday life, almost always in a city environment, and she criticized artificiality and lack of genuine value behind the facade. Ideologically, she was inspired by her personal friend and colleague Johan Henric Kellgren, with whom she often worked from 1778 onward. Fredrik Böök says that \"there was every word needed and no more, almost no adjectives. She painted with only verbs and substantives\", and Snoilsky writes in his poem \"\" (\"An evening at Mrs Lenngren's\"): \"It's like a burdock, this witty meter\".\n\nHer successful early career during the 1770s was influenced by her feminist ideas, foremost her defense of women's right to participate and engage in intellectual work. This is most evident in the forewords of her translation of \"Lucile\" (1776) and her poem \" (1777).\n\nThe radical change in her views of women's role which took place in her work after her marriage in 1780 has been the subject of much debate. In her poem \" (\"Advice to my dear daughter, if I had one\") and \", she advice women to renounce intellectual aspirations and focus on shaping their character morally to that on an ideal wife and mother. She advice women to concentrate on domestic tasks rather than attempt to meddle in intellectual or political pursuits, because \"Our household is our Republic; our politics is our appearance\". She herself officially discontinued her career after her marriage by only publishing her works under anonymous pseudonyms and refusing to admit to them. However, Anna Maria Lenngren is famed for her great love for irony, which has created uncertainty about whether she meant what she said literary or if she wished to prove her point by irony. Her poem \"Dröm\", which was given as a response to the admiration from the Academy in 1797, and in which she describe herself as unworthy, has also been interpreted as ironic in this regard.\n\nAnna Maria Lenngren was a supporter of the realistic and scientific views of the age on enlightenment and disliked religion, sometimes interpreted as a protest against the religious environment of her childhood home. She had radical views on Sweden's class system, opposed the privileges of the nobility, and defended the rights of the \"third estate\" or working class against oppression. She criticized the snobbery of the nobility, the humble admiration their servants gave them and the anxious bowing of the working class, and portrayed the male members of the upper class as cold and merciless and the female members as snobby and ridiculous. A realist, she idealized \"the third class\", was inspired by the French Revolution. Above all, she fought for the intellectual freedom of women; that also women should be allowed to have opinions, and criticized male double standards.\n\nHer best-known poems on the class system are ' (\"Morning prayer of His Grace\") and ' (\"Visit from the Countess\"), in which she satirizes snobbery, and ' (\"Boys\"), in which she laments the fact that children of all classes can play with each other during their childhood, but that this solidarity and friendship is destroyed when they became adults, along with the popular ' (\"There was no oatmeal but still a happy Christmas\"), in which she describes the effects of poverty.\n\nAnna Maria Lenngren is one of the most famous poets in the history of Sweden. Her production has made her one of the few 18th-century Swedish poets who are still commonly read, and she has been published a number of times after her death during the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nIn accordance with her instructions, her collected poems were published after her death by her widower under the name \" (\"Attempts at Poetry\"). After its publication, the Royal Swedish Academy had a memorial medal made with the inscription: \"The less she sought fame, the more she gained it\".\n\nHer correspondence with her personal friend Gustaf af Leopold from 1795 to 1798 has been published.\n\nAnna Maria Lenngren is portrayed in the novel \" (\"Chamber-pot child\") by Anna Laestadius Larsson from 2014, where she, alongside Ulrika Pasch, Ulrika Widström, Jeanna von Lantingshausen, Marianne Ehrenström and Sophie von Fersen, becomes a member in a Blue Stockings Society organized by the Queen of Sweden and Norway, Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His films include \"Hey, Happy!\", \"Stryker\", \"Guy Maddin: Waiting for Twilight\" and \"To Russia with Love\". His work frequently deals with themes of homosexuality, social exclusion, dystopia and utopia.\n\nGonick was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1970. His father, Cy Gonick, is a reputed Marxist economist and former member of the Manitoba Legislature. As a youth, Noam showed a strong interest in theatre. While in elementary school, he started a small theatre company composed of other children from his neighborhood. At 16, he lived briefly in Berlin, Germany, where he worked as an actor in an experimental theatre troupe. After returning to Canada, he met and began working with filmmaker Guy Maddin, who would have a seminal influence upon his early work.\n\nGonick attended and graduated from Ryerson University in Toronto, earning a BFA with a major in Film. He edited \"Ride, Queer, Ride\" (1997) a collection of writings on and by filmmaker Bruce LaBruce, who would prove to be another important influence on Gonick's filmmaking. In 2007, he was made the youngest inductee to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. He is currently president of the board of directors at the Plug-In Institute of the Contemporary Arts.\n\nGonick has been in a relationship with artist Michael Walker since March 2016.\n\nGonick's first film was the 1997 short \"1919\", a historically revisionist depiction of the Winnipeg General Strike, as seen through the window of a gay oriental barbershop and bathhouse. MoMA selected the film as one of the best gay and lesbian films from the last fifteen years. His next film was the documentary \"Guy Maddin: Waiting for Twilight\", narrated by Tom Waits and featuring Shelley Duvall. The film captures Maddin as he begins production on Twilight of the Ice Nymphs (1997). The documentary received acclaim on the festival circuit and went on to a successful life on television. Gonick would follow up with the experimental short \"Tinkertown\" in 1999, while also writing and developing his first feature, \"Hey, Happy!\" (2001). The cult-styled film, set in the Winnipeg rave scene on the eve of an apocalyptic flood, was distributed in North America and Europe, and was listed in Artforum's selection of best movies of the year.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Gonick directed a number of episodes of Canadian documentary television series \"KinK\", before returning to film with \"Stryker\" (2004), a feature he co-wrote with David McIntosh. \"Stryker\" strikes a comic-tragic tone in its colourful depiction of the bleak realities of Aboriginal youth and working-class transsexuals. The film was photographed by Ed Lachman, and featured a cast of mostly amateur actors. It premiered at the Venice International Film Festival.\n\nIn 2007, Gonick wrote and directed \"Retail\", a comedy TV pilot. Gonick's early interest in theatre was given renewed outlet in his creation of two short documentaries about important Canadian theatre figures: \"Hirsch\" (2010), on Hungarian-Canadian director and co-founder of the Manitoba Theatre Centre John Hirsch, and \"What If?\" (2011), on Leslee Silverman, celebrated artistic director of Manitoba Theatre for Young People. Some of Gonick's recent installation art has included elements of live performance.\n\nGonick directed the documentary To Russia with Love, featuring LGBT athletes competing in and responding to the Sochi Olympics. The film was nominated for a GLAAD Award and was streamed worldwide on Netflix. In 2016 Noam began directing the series Taken for APTN about murdered and missing Indigenous women.\n\nGonick's work in installation art began in 2006 with a collaboration with Rebecca Belmore that was shown at the Venice Biennale. Since that time, he produced several installation works incorporating film and video elements.\n\n\"Wildflowers of Manitoba\" (2007) is a performance piece and film installation created in collaboration with Luis Jacob. Housed in a geodesic dome furnished as a teenaged bedroom, the frame swells with projected images of homoeroticism in the Canadian Shield, evoking a \"romantic vision of bliss, sensuality and sexual return to the land.\" It premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival, and has been exhibited worldwide.\n\n\"Precious Blood\" (2007), commissioned by the Ontario College of Art and Design, consists of a scale model of the Provincial Remand Centre, a Winnipeg detention centre. Video of interviews with girlfriends and friends of inmates is displayed on the façade of the model, as these young men and women harbour outside the centre in hopes of catching glimpses of their incarcerated loved ones inside. The piece's title derives from the name of the modernist church designed by Etienne Gaboury, who was also architect of the Remand Centre.\n\n\"Commerce Court\" (2008) is a satirical commentary on the corruption and greed of the financial industry. Projected originally onto a six-story building in Commerce Court, the world headquarters of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, it features Roman Danylo in the role a banker on the verge of nervous breakdown. The installation premiered at Toronto's Nuit Blanche on October 2, the eve of the passing of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the first bailout of the U.S. financial system.\n\n\"No Safe Words\" (2009) is a multi-channel video installation that uses sports broadcast recaps and scorecards as a point of departure for examining athletic stadiums as sites of violence, from varsity hazing to political torture, while exploring the possible homoerotic undertones of such violence. The piece, broadcast originally on JumboTron screen during Toronto's 2008 Pride March, has also been interpreted as a commentary on the deradicalization of the gay pride movement.\n\n"}

During a series of scandals in the 1980s and 1990s, The Trinity Foundation established itself as a watchdog group which provided information about fraud and abuse by religious groups.\n\nTrinity Foundation's investigative work into the fundraising tactics of big-money televangelists first came to national attention in 1991 following a \"Primetime Live\" hidden-camera look at televangelist Robert Tilton. The foundation was instrumental in providing evidence for the many state and federal investigations of Tilton in the years that followed.\n\nTrinity has primarily investigated televangelists such as Benny Hinn, Kenneth Copeland, Joyce Meyer, Paula White, Peter Popoff, Robert Tilton, W.V. Grant, pastor Edwin Barry Young, and the Trinity Broadcasting Network. Much of its information comes from disgruntled former employees, moles working for ministries who secretly (and under constant threat of termination and lawsuit) provide information to Trinity, and dumpster diving for information.\n\nThe Trinity Foundation has an extensive video library of televangelists. They routinely take notes of the televangelists broadcasts. The notes go back at least ten years for most shows that air on religious networks. This information is used to aid reporters who are investigating televangelists. The head investigator at The Trinity Foundation is Pete Evans, who is a private investigator.\n\nRegarding Hinn, Trinity claims to have evidence showing that Hinn's ministry does not qualify as a church under Internal Revenue Service guidelines, as reported by \"The Dallas Morning News\" in July 2005. Specifically, Trinity claims that Hinn's ministry does not hold regular public worship services at its facility, as access is strictly limited to employees with access badges.\n\nTrinity has also investigated the St. Matthew's Churches/Church By Mail, Inc., a \"seed-faith ministry\" of James Eugene \"Gene\" Ewing which targets the poorest zip codes in America with religious mailings.\n\nThe foundation was directly involved in Sen. Charles Grassley's Senate Finance Committee investigation of abuses by a number of televangelist ministries. Beginning in 2005, after being asked to help by the committee’s general counsel, the foundation submitted over the next six years 38 separate reports on abuses by religious not-for-profit organizations, which were incorporated into the committee’s final report.\n\nThe foundation recently criticized Sen. Grassley for turning to the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA) for suggested solutions instead of acting on tough legislative proposals from his staff for policing abuses by religious organizations. The foundation claimed the ECFA's recommendations were too lax and were compromised by close ties to the very ministries they were proposing to oversee.\n\nThe Christian community of around 50 members that grew from Bible studies formed under the umbrella of the foundation over the years established itself in 2010 as Community on Columbia, an independent church congregation separate from the foundation's oversight, but still in friendly cooperation and agreement with its mission. The church took over the longstanding ministry of helping the homeless that the foundation began.\n\nThe foundation also published \"The Wittenburg Door\", a magazine of Christian satire, from 1996 to 2008.\n\nSome former members of the group have been critical of it and Anthony.

Roughly one quarter of the individuals are pied, with dark and white feathers, and the rest, known as bronze shags, are dark all over. Both morphs breed together. These large, chunky birds are about 70 cm long, weigh about 2–3 kg, and are slightly larger than Foveaux shags.\n\nThey can be distinguished from Foveaux shags by their facial ornamentation in the breeding season: Foveaux shags have dark orange papillae on their face, whereas Otago shags have both papillae and small bright orange facial caruncles above the base of the bill.\n\nUntil 2016, Otago shags and the closely related shags living around Stewart Island and Foveaux Strait were considered to be a single species, called the Stewart Island shag. Mitochondrial DNA suggests Otago shags are actually more closely related to Chatham shags (\"Leucocarbo onslowi\"), and osteological and genetic differences supported separating off Foveaux shags as a distinct species, \"L. stewarti\". Foveaux and Otago shags probably diverged when populations were split up by lower sea levels in the Pleistocene, and the Chatham Islands were subsequently colonised by shags from Otago. Other taxonomists have kept the Otago shag and the Foveaux shag conspecific.\n\nA recent taxonomic revision argues that \"Leucocarbo\" is a distinct genus, which would contain amongst other species the Otago, Foveaux, and Chatham shags. Others place it in the genus Phalacrocorax.\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that Otago shags were formerly found along the entire east coast of the South Island up to Marlborough, but when humans arrived the population was devastated, reduced by 99 percent within 100 years with a corresponding loss of genetic diversity. It became restricted to the rocky offshore islets off the Otago Peninsula, and has scarcely recovered since that time. There are less than 2500 Otago shags remaining, but they can be seen at Otago Harbour, as far north as Oamaru, and as far south as the Catlins. Restricted to a small area, and having little or no genetic variation, they require conservation efforts tailored to these extinction risk factors; this could include reintroduction to part of their former range.\n\nOtago shags breed colonially from May to September, making raised cup nests out of organic material and guano on islands and sea cliffs. Colonies are large enough to be strikingly visible, and are used year after year. One notable colony is on the northern shore of Taiaroa Head, at the mouth of the Otago Harbour. They feed in coastal waters less than 30 m deep and are rarely if ever seen inland or far out to sea.\n\n"}

The current range of headphones/headsets consists of over-ear, in-ear, aviation and military models.\n\nDevelopment of the company's noise-cancelling headphones (and first over-ear headphones) began in 1978 when the chairman, Amar Bose, tried a set of airline-supplied headphones during a flight and found that engine noise from the aircraft prevented the music from being enjoyed.\n\nIn 1986, Bose and Sennheiser both presented active noise-cancelling headsets for aircraft pilots, with the Sennheiser design appearing in a Funkschau (\"see article on the German Wikipedia\") paper and the Bose design appearing in an ASME paper. A prototype Bose product was used to prevent hearing loss in pilots during the first non-stop around-the-world flight in the Rutan Voyager. The company was the first to release active noise cancelling headphones as a consumer product.\n\nThe \"QuietComfort 25\" (QC25) over-ear headphones were released in 2015 as the replacement for the . Unlike its predecessors, the QC25s can be used (without the noise-cancelling function) while the battery is flat. Another change is the elimination of the Hi/Low switch which increased the input gain for low-output sources like MP3 players.\n\nIn 2014, the QC25s won the \"What Hi-Fi?\" Sound and Vision annual award for \"Best Noise Cancelling Headphones\".\n\nThe QuietComfort 35 was released in 2016 as a successor to the 25. It supports Bluetooth wireless operation, the Bose Connect mobile app for advanced audio control, and contain an embedded rechargeable battery. \n\nIn 2017, Bose released an updated model known as the QuietComfort 35 II, which adds a customizable \"action\" button on the left ear cap. By default, it is mapped to activate the Google Assistant, making it the first headphones to integrate with the service.\n\nThe QC35 II was reviewed favourably for their noise cancellation, audio quality and comfort.\n\nIn July 2019, users began to report that a firmware update to the QC35 II had inhibited the performance of the noise cancellation features. Bose stated that it had not made any changes to noise cancellation functions in their firmware. Some users performed firmware downgrades to the to revert back to an earlier version, but Bose later prevented this for security reasons. In October 2019, as part of an investigation, Bose began to allow owners within a \"reasonable\" proximity to the company's headquarters in Framingham, Massachusetts to request a visit by a technician.\n\nIn 2019, Bose released the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, a new high-end product positioned above the QC 35.\n\nIt features a more contemporary design with a stainless steel band, and are controlled using a mix of buttons and touch-sensitive areas on the cups. Unlike the QC 35, they do not fold in half, but their earcups can rotate for storage. The embedded rechargeable battery is not replaceable which limits the lifespan of the headphones to the life of the battery. Bose promoted improvements to sound quality, noise cancellation and voice call quality over the QC 35. The NCH700 can also connect to two devices simultaneously, and integrate with Amazon Alexa and Siri in addition to the Google Assistant.\n\nThe \"QuietComfort 20\" (QC20) and QC20i in-ear headphones were released in 2015 and are the company's first in-ear noise cancelling headphones. The QC20 model is for Android, Windows and Blackberry devices, while the QC20i is designed for Apple devices and includes volume controls on the remote.\n\nThe noise-cancelling hardware and rechargable battery is contained with a box located near the headphone jack, similar to the . The earbuds are similar to the IE2 headphones. A button on the remote labelled \"Aware Mode\" reduces noise-cancellation to let in ambient noise.\n\nThe \"A20 Aviation Headset\" was released in 2010 as the successor to the \"Aviation Headset X\" (aka A10). It has a claimed battery life of 45 hours (using two AA batteries) or can be powered by the airplane's electrical system. There are two versions, one with Bluetooth and one without.\n\nAn updated version of the A20 was released in 2015.\n\nA \"Combat Vehicle Crewman Headset\" was released in 1998, for use in armoured vehicles.\n\nA \"Triport Tactical Headset\" (TTH) was released in 2004. It is designed for use in armoured vehicles and can fit under an infantry ballistic helmet. An updated version was released in 2012.\n\nThe Bluetooth sunglasses were released in 2019 and come in two styles - alto and rondo. The sunglasses have open-ear audio, UVA/UVB protection, an integrated microphone, a Bluetooth range of 9 metres, and are also AR enabled. The battery can sustain up to 3.5 hours of streaming music playback and takes up to 2 hours to charge.\n"}

A two-time NBA All-Star, he won two NBA championships with the Lakers over the Philadelphia 76ers at the onset of their Showtime era in the 1980s.\n\nBorn the third of three boys to Mary Jo and Elmer Nixon, in Macon, Georgia, his mother contracted myasthenia gravis when Norm was a baby, and his parents divorced when he was two years old. The three boys were also raised with the help of his mother's mom and aunt (the boys' grandmother and great aunt). He and his two brothers, Ken and Ron, attended the Methodist church, and Norm became an usher.\n\nHe played basketball and football in high school at Southwest High School in Macon, Georgia, and was named to all-state in both sports. In football, he played defensive back and tailback, and was later offered a free agent tryout by both the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys. He was senior class president and named as the starting guard on the Georgia All-State team for 1973, after leading Southwest to the 1973 state high school basketball championship under coach Donald \"Duck\" Richardson. Nixon also played the trumpet and was on the yearbook staff. He was on the track team, ran the 440 yard dash, and won a regional title in the high jump at 6 feet, 5 inches.\n\nHe played four full seasons at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While there he averaged 17.2 points-per-game (PPG), 5.5 assists-per-game (APG), and 4.0 rebounds-per-game (RPG), scoring 1,805 points and adding 577 assists in 104 games for his career with the Duquesne Dukes. Nixon was named first-team All-Eastern Eight Conference, and left holding the record for career assists.\n\nOn January 27, 2001, during the halftime of a game against Xavier University (Cincinnati), the Duquesne University Department of Athletics retired the jerseys of five of its all-time greatest players, including Nixon's #10 (also retired: Chuck Cooper, Sihugo Green, Dick Ricketts and Willie Somerset). \n\nIn 2019, Nixon gave his blessing for his retired number 10 to be worn by sophomore point guard Sincere Carry. Carry requested to wear it in order to pay tribute to a friend who wore number 10 in high school, and who fell victim to gun violence in the spring of 2019.\n\nNixon was the 22nd overall pick in the 1977 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers. He played for the Lakers for six successful seasons and helped the Showtime Lakers win NBA championships in 1980 (4–2) and 1982 (4–2), both against the Philadelphia 76ers. The same two teams would meet in the 1983 NBA Finals, but Philadelphia won this series four games to none. In the 1978 (Seattle SuperSonics), 1979 (Seattle), and 1981 (Houston Rockets) playoffs, the Lakers were eliminated by the eventual Western Conference champion.\n\nHe led the team in scoring in the 1982 playoffs.\n\nIn game one of the 1983 finals he had a violent collision with Andrew Toney of the 76ers early in the first quarter. As he came off the floor, coach Pat Riley asked Nixon \"You need a blow?\", to which Nixon replied: \"No, a casket\". He would continue to play in game one and game two despite a separated shoulder.\n\nPrior to the start of the 1983–84 season, the popular Nixon was traded to the San Diego Clippers in exchange for the draft rights to guard Byron Scott. Lakers general manager Jerry West made the deal to free Magic Johnson, the team's other point guard, from sharing the ball with Nixon. In his first year with the Clippers, Nixon led the league in total assists and made the All-Star team for the second time in the 1984–85 season. After the 1985–86 season, he spent much of his later career on the injured list, spending more than two full seasons on the injured list before retiring for good at the end of the 1988–89 season. During his time with the Clippers he would never make it to the playoffs again.\n\nFor the 1978–79 season he tied Eddie Jordan of the New Jersey Nets for the NBA lead in steals with 201, and total games (82 regular season + 23 playoffs = 105). The next season (1979–80) he led the league in minutes played (3,226), minutes per game (39.3), and was third in assists with 642. Led the league in assists for the 1983–84 season with 914, and regular season games played (82).\n\nHe missed the 1986–87 season after stepping into a hole during a softball game in New York City's Central Park during the summer of 1986 (July 23, 1986) and suffered severe damage to the tendon just above his left knee. Nixon ruptured his right Achilles tendon during a pre-season practice on November 4, 1987; the injury would cause him to miss the entire 1987–88 season. Before being injured he had played in 715 of 725 games available in his first nine seasons.\n\nDuring his NBA career, Nixon scored 12,065 points (15.7 points per game) and had 6,386 assists (8.3) in 768 games played. Although he had impressive statistics, he may be remembered most for faking a free throw at the end of a Lakers-San Antonio Spurs game on November 30, 1982, which caused a double lane violation. The referees erroneously ordered a jump ball, instead of requiring Nixon to re-shoot the free throw. The Lakers got the ball and Nixon made a field goal to tie the game, where they prevailed in overtime. The last three seconds of the game were later replayed in April 1983.\n\nAfter retiring from the NBA in March 1989, Nixon played for Scavolini Pesaro of the Italian major-league Serie A in April and May. In August 1989 Valerio Bianchini (who had coached Pesaro the previous season) head coach of Messaggero Roma tried to get Nixon to come play for the 1989–90 season. He would participate in some of the NBA's Legends Classic games that took place during All-Star Weekend in the late 80s and early 90s, before a leg injury forced him out of a game. The league would later retire the game due to fear of injuries amongst players.\n\nHe became a sports agent (at Premier Management Group Inc. and then later Norm Nixon & Associates) representing such clients as Doug Edwards, Samaki Walker, Jalen Rose, Maurice Taylor, Teddy Dupay, Gary Grant, Gerald Fitch, the NFL's Peter Warrick, Larry Smith, and Al Wilson, and entertainers such as LL Cool J and TLC.\n\nHe founded the Debbie Allen Dance Academy (DADA) in Culver City, California with his wife.\n\nIn his retirement years, Nixon concentrated on several business ventures, and served one season as radio commentator for the Clippers (2004–05), as well as doing analyst work for KABC-TV's NBA post-game shows during the mid-2000s.\n\nSubsequently, he was hired by Fox Sports West to take over Jack Haley's position as studio color analyst for all Lakers home games, working alongside studio host Bill McDonald during pregame, halftime, and post game coverage.\n\nNixon has been married to actress/producer/director/dancer Debbie Allen since 1984 and they have three children, actor DeVaughn Nixon (Allen is his stepmother), dancer Vivian Nichole Nixon, and basketball player Norman Ellard Nixon Jr. (Wofford College & Southern University). Nixon's sister-in-law is actress/director/singer Phylicia Rashad.\n\nBefore they were married, both Nixon and Allen appeared in the 1979 film \"The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh\" (a film that also featured NBA stars Julius Erving and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar).\n\n\n"}

Each of the nine stories has a short preface of Garfield in his modern incarnation, explaining how these various lives shaped aspects of Garfield's personality, such as the origin of his fear of the veterinarian, his love of destructive behavior, his proclivity for a slothful lifestyle, and his extremely playful side.\n\n\nThe one-hour-long television adaptation produced in 1988 featured ten separate segments, just like the book. Six of these were adapted from the book, and an additional four were newly written for the show. \"Babes and Bullets\" was adapted into a television special of its own, \"Garfield's Babes and Bullets\", the following year, and won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program of 1989. \"The Vikings\", \"The Exterminators\" and \"Primal Self\" have never been adapted for television.

It stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan as a mother and daughter, respectively, whose bodies are switched by a mysterious and magical Chinese fortune cookie.\n\nThe film was released in theaters on August 6, 2003, by Walt Disney Pictures and Buena Vista Pictures. It received largely positive reviews from critics and earned over $160 million worldwide on a $26 million budget. The film also earned Curtis a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. It was Disney's third film adaptation of the novel, after the 1976 film, starring Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster, and the 1995 made-for-TV film, starring Shelley Long and Gaby Hoffmann.\n\nAnna Coleman is an aspiring teenage musician who lives with her widowed therapist mother, Tess, and younger brother, Harry. Tess is about to marry her fiancé, Ryan, whom Anna has not entirely accepted.\n\nAt home, Anna's brother is constantly playing tricks on her, which always ends up with the two chasing and yelling at each other. Tess takes down Anna's bedroom door, because she thinks that privacy means privileges. Anna is furious about this. At school, her English teacher, Mr. Bates, treats her unfairly, and she is feuding with Stacey, her former best friend-turned-nemesis. Anna has a crush on an older student, Jake, of whom her mother disapproves. Anna plays guitar in a band, Pink Slip, which is scheduled to audition for a gig at the House of Blues, the same night as the wedding rehearsal, so Tess says Anna can't go. At a dinner at Pei-Pei's Chinese restaurant, mother and daughter get into another argument, with both accusing the each other of not being able to walk in the other's shoes and not ever seeing eye-to-eye. Pei-Pei's mother interrupts their arguing to give them fortune cookies. After Anna locks herself in the bathroom and Tess pleads with her on the other side of the door, they both snap the fortune cookie in half, and read their fortunes out loud. They both feel an intense earthquake that the rest of the restaurant is oblivious to. The next morning, they wake up in each other's bodies.\n\n\"Anna\" (Tess in her daughter's body) has to go to school and begins to understand her daughter's woes. She recognizes Mr. Bates as a high school classmate, who is picking on Anna because her mother once turned down his prom invitation, and threatens to report him to the school board unless he ceases his unfair treatment. \"Anna\" also discovers that \"Tess\" (Anna in her mother's body) has been hiding a belly button piercing from her. Meanwhile, \"Tess\", after giving her new body a makeover, has difficulty handling the patients. At lunchtime, \"Anna\" and \"Tess\" return to the restaurant but Pei-Pei's mother explains that only by showing selfless love for each other, the switch will be reversed.\n\n\"Tess\" attends Harry's parent-teacher conference, where she reads a composition about how much he actually admires her. \"Anna\" attempts to make amends with Stacey, but Stacey frames her for cheating. Jake helps \"Anna\" finish the test, and she realizes she has misjudged him, but he loses his enamoration towards \"Anna\" after she sabotages Stacey's test. Ryan surprises \"Tess\" with a talk show interview to discuss her latest psychology book. \"Anna\" and Jake watch the interview on television and while she is embarrassed, he is impressed. \"Tess\" bumps into Jake at a coffee shop, and they bond over their favorite music.\n\nAt the rehearsal dinner, Anna's bandmates try to convince \"Anna\" to sneak off to the audition, but they are caught by security. Ryan surprisingly gives \"Anna\" permission to go, explaining that he just wants the kids to accept him, and urges \"Tess\" to go support the band, finally winning her over. Since \"Anna\" cannot play, \"Tess\" plays the ripping guitar solo herself while \"Anna\" only pretends to play. Realizing the fun of her daughter's music, \"Anna\" promises to treat her daughter's band with more respect, and during the show, Jake becomes enamored with \"Anna\" again upon seeing her perform.\n\nBack at the rehearsal dinner, \"Anna\" tells \"Tess\" to ask Ryan to postpone the wedding, so that her daughter will not have to marry him in her mother's body. Instead, \"Tess\" proposes a toast, finally accepting Ryan because of how happy he makes her mom. This act of selfless love switches back Anna and Tess' bodies. Tess and Ryan later marry, she and Anna finally make up, and Anna and Jake start dating with Tess's approval.\n\nJust as the credits hit, PeiPei notices her mother offering Anna’s Grandfather, Alan, and Harry two fortune cookies. She immediately rushes and knocks them both to the ground, and sighs in relief to have the cookies in her hands.\n\n\nInitially, producer Andrew Gunn had hoped that Jodie Foster, who played Annabel in the original 1976 film, would be interested in the role of the mother. However, Foster declined, citing concerns that her stunt casting would draw attention away from other elements of the movie. Jamie Lee Curtis was offered the role of Tess at the last minute, after Annette Bening dropped out for undisclosed reasons four days before filming began. Kelly Osbourne was originally set to play Maddie, but withdrew when her mother was diagnosed with cancer. She was replaced by Christina Vidal.\n\nMarc McClure, who played Annabel's love interest in the 1976 film, makes a brief cameo as Boris the delivery man. The snapshots in the opening credits are photos of Curtis and her daughter, Annie Guest. In the final scene, Dina Lohan, Lindsay Lohan’s mother and manager, makes an appearance as one of the wedding guests. Director Mark Waters also has a cameo holding a baby at the wedding.\n\nLohan's character was originally written as a Goth, but she did not think anyone would relate to that, and decided to dress in a preppy style for her audition. The character ended up being rewritten as such.\n\nRyan Shuck coached Curtis to play the guitar solo for the concert scene. Lohan trained for one year to learn to play the guitar before production. In the final version of the film, however, both Curtis and Lohan's guitar parts were overdubbed by professional studio musicians.\n\nPrincipal photography began on October 5, 2002, and it ended on December 18, 2002.\n\nThe film was released on DVD and VHS on December 16, 2003, by Walt Disney Home Entertainment.

The film is also available on the streaming service Disney+ after its launch on November 12, 2019.\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed $22.2 million in 2,954 theaters, finishing second at the box office, behind \"S.W.A.T.\" ($37.1 million). The film went on to gross $110.2 million in North America and $50.6 million in other territories for a total of $160.8 million. The film was released in the United Kingdom on December 19, 2003, and opened at number four.\n\n\"Freaky Friday\" received largely positive reviews from film critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 88%, based on 153 reviews, with an average rating of 6.99/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan charm in Mark Waters' nicely pitched -- and Disney's second -- remake of the 1976 hit.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 70 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nCurtis's performance was singled out for praise by many critics. David Ansen of \"Newsweek\" noted that, \"the most startling metamorphosis is Curtis' transformation from fading horror flick queen to dazzling comedienne. She goes on a teenage tear—tormenting Anna's younger brother (who wonders why Mom's acting so weird), getting down and dirty on a TV talk show where Tess is supposed to discuss her book on aging—with fiercely funny conviction.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum from \"Entertainment Weekly\" called her performance \"glorious,\" and A. O. Scott from \"The New York Times\" contended that she \"does some of her best work ever [in \"Freaky Friday\"].\" Independent reviewer Nick Davis described her as \"so frisky and pouty and incandescent in \"Freaky Friday\", she made the whole movie feel like something special.\" Her performance was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n\nLohan's performance was also praised. Roger Ebert, who gave the film three out of four stars, described Lohan as possessing \"that Jodie Foster sort of seriousness and intent focus beneath her teenage persona.\" The film earned her the award for Breakthrough Performance at the 2004 MTV Movie Awards.\n\nNick Schager of \"Slant Magazine\", however, objected to the body-switching scene, calling it \"a strange bit of 'Oriental mysticism' stereotyping that seems at odds with the film’s thematic focus on tolerance and understanding.\"\n\nThe orchestral score was written by Rolfe Kent and orchestrated by Tony Blondal.\n\nLohan also recorded a song for the soundtrack, titled \"Ultimate\".\n\nList awards to film and actress/actors.\n\n"}

Organized crime and corruption were persistent concerns in the city.\n\nIn 1855, Chicago Mayor Levi Boone threw Chicago politics into the national spotlight with some dry proposals that would lead to the Lager Beer Riot by the wets.\n\nThe 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago nominated home-state candidate Abraham Lincoln. During the 1880s, 1890s, and early 20th century, Chicago also had an underground radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist, communist, anarchist and labor organizations. The Republicans had their own machine operations, typified by the \"blonde boss\" William Lorimer, who was unseated by the U.S. Senate in 1912 because of his corrupt election methods.\n\nThe political environment in Chicago in the 1910s and 1920s let organized crime flourish to the point that many Chicago policemen earned more money from pay-offs than from the city. Before the 1930s, the Democratic Party in Chicago was divided along ethnic lines - the Irish, Polish, Italian, and other groups each controlled politics in their neighborhoods. Under the leadership of Anton Cermak, the party consolidated its ethnic bases into one large organization. With the organization behind, Cermak was able to win election as mayor of Chicago in 1931, an office he held until his assassination in 1933.\n\nThe modern era of politics was dominated by machine politics in many ways, and the Cook County Democratic Party was honed by Richard J. Daley after his election in 1955. Richard M. Daley, his son, is a former mayor of Chicago and had served for 21 years as mayor and 38 as a public servant. Daley announced on September 7, 2010 that he would not be seeking re-election. Daley was succeeded by former Obama White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel.\n\nThe New Deal of the 1930s and the Great Society of the 1960s gave the Democratic Party access to new funds and programs for housing, slum clearance, urban renewal, and education, through which to dispense patronage and maintain control of the city. Machine politics persisted in Chicago after the decline of similar machines in other large American cities. During much of that time, the city administration found opposition mainly from a liberal \"independent\" faction of the Democratic Party. This included African Americans and Latinos. In the Lakeview/Uptown 46th Ward. The first Latino to announce an aldermanic bid against a Daley loyalist was Jose Cha Cha Jimenez, the Young Lords founder.\n\nA point of interest is the party leanings of the city. For much of the last century, Chicago has been considered one of the largest Democratic strongholds in the United States. For example, the citizens of Chicago have not elected a Republican mayor since 1927, when William Thompson was voted into office. Brian Doherty was the only Republican council member in recent decades.\n\nThe police corruption that came to the light from the Summerdale Scandals of 1960, where police officers kept stolen property or sold it and kept the cash, was another black eye on the local political scene of Chicago. Eight officers from the Summerdale police district on Chicago's Northwest Side were accused of operating a large-scale burglary ring. News of the scandal was splashed across the city's newspapers and was the biggest police-related scandal the city had ever seen at the time. Mayor Daley appointed a committee to make recommendations for improvements to the police system.\n\nThe Daley faction, with financial help from Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., helped elect John F. Kennedy to the office of President of the United States in the 1960 presidential election. The electoral votes from the state of Illinois, with nearly half its population located in Chicago-dominated Cook County, were a factor in the win for Kennedy over Richard Nixon.\n\nChicago politics have also hosted some very publicized campaigns and conventions. The Democratic Party decided on Harry S. Truman as the vice-presidential candidate at the 1944 Democratic National Convention. The 1968 Democratic National Convention was the scene of mass political rallies and discontent, leading to the famous trial of the Chicago Seven. Seven defendants—Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, and Lee Weiner—were charged with conspiracy, inciting to riot, and other charges related to protests.\n\nHome-town columnist Mike Royko wrote satirically that Chicago's motto (\"Urbs in Horto\" or \"City in a Garden\") should instead be \"Ubi est mea\", or \"Where's Mine?\n\nThe shock election of six Democratic Socialists of America to the council in 2019 was regarded as the largest socialist electoral victory in modern American history. Although technically non-partisan along with the rest of the council, the newly elected aldermen formed a Socialist caucus.\n\nChicago has a long history of political corruption, dating to the incorporation of the city in 1833. It has been a de facto monolithic entity of the Democratic Party from the mid 20th century onward. Research released by the University of Illinois at Chicago reports that Chicago and Cook County's judicial district recorded 45 public corruption convictions for 2013, and 1642 convictions since 1976, when the Department of Justice began compiling statistics. This prompted many media outlets to declare Chicago the \"corruption capital of America\". Gradel and Simpson's \"Corrupt Illinois\" (2015) provides the data behind Chicago's corrupt political culture. They found that a tabulation of federal public corruption convictions make Chicago \"undoubtedly the most corrupt city in our nation\", with the cost of corruption \"at least\" $500 million per year.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a remake of the 1961 film of the same name and an adaptation of Erich Kästner's German novel \"Lottie and Lisa\" (\"Das doppelte Lottchen\").\n\nDennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson star as a divorced couple who separated shortly after their identical twin daughters' birth; Lindsay Lohan stars (in her film debut) as both twins, Hallie Parker and Annie James, who are fortuitously reunited at summer camp after being separated at birth. David Swift wrote the screenplay for the original 1961 film based on \"Lottie and Lisa\". The story is comparable to that of the 1936 Deanna Durbin film \"Three Smart Girls\". Swift is credited along with Meyers and Shyer as co-writers of the 1998 version.\n\nIn 1986, American winery owner Nicholas \"Nick\" Parker (Dennis Quaid) and British wedding gown designer Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson) get married over the course of a transatlantic crossing on the \"Queen Elizabeth 2\". However, shortly after the birth of their identical twin daughters, Annie and Hallie (both played by Lindsay Lohan), they get divorced and each has sole custody of one girl; Nick raises Hallie in Napa Valley, California and Elizabeth raises Annie in London, England.\n\nEleven years later in the summer of 1998, Nick and Elizabeth coincidentally send their daughters to the same summer camp, where they meet and take an immediate dislike to one another. They begin to pull a series of pranks on each other and after one prank goes too far, the two girls are isolated together as punishment until camp is over. One night they discover they are twin sisters and hatch a plan: to switch places in order to meet the parent they have never met and eventually reunite them. Hallie imitates Annie's British accent and flies to London to meet their mother, maternal grandfather Charles, and the James' butler Martin. Meanwhile, Annie imitates Hallie's American accent and flies to Napa Valley to meet their father, Hallie's nanny Chessy, and the family dog Sammy.\n\nUpon arriving in Napa Valley, \"Hallie\" learns Nick has a new girlfriend Meredith (Elaine Hendrix), a child-hating gold digger, that he is planning to propose to. \"Annie\" sneaks out to call her sister from a phone booth but is discovered by Charles, who persuades her to reveal her identity to Elizabeth. Meanwhile, Chessy grows suspicious of \"Hallie's\" odd behaviour, and \"Hallie\" confesses she is really Annie, but they do not tell Nick.\n\n\"Annie\" tells Elizabeth that Nick wants to meet her in San Francisco in order to switch the girls back and the two of them, along with Martin, travel to do so. On the same weekend, \"Hallie\", Nick and Meredith travel to the same hotel to discuss wedding plans. Nick sees Elizabeth for the first time in years, and they both learn they have been tricked by their daughters into meeting again, as well as Nick discovering he's had Annie in his care since the end of camp. Meanwhile, Chessy and Martin meet and grow romantically attracted to each other.\nHallie and Annie recreate the night their parents met by renting out a yacht for an evening, but ultimately fail to rekindle Nick and Elizabeth's relationship. The twins resort to a last-ditch effort by demanding a three-day family camping trip, refusing to reveal which twin is which until after they return. Elizabeth tricks Meredith into taking her place on the camping trip at the last minute, much to the girls dismay. Over the course of the trip, Hallie and Annie play a number of harmless tricks on Meredith who becomes enraged and demands Nick chooses between her and them. Nick, finally seeing Meredith for who she truly is, chooses the girls and breaks off the engagement.\n\nBack in Napa Valley, Nick shows Elizabeth his wine collection including the bottle from their wedding; they both realise they still have feelings for one another but decide it is better to go their separate ways. Elizabeth and Annie later board a flight for London, but when they arrive home, they find Nick and Hallie waiting for them (having taken a faster flight on the Concorde). Nick expresses his previous mistake of not going after Elizabeth when she left him the first time. They kiss, being watched by the girls who exclaim, \"We actually did it.\"\n\nPhotos during the credit show Nick and Elizabeth getting remarried aboard the \"Queen Elizabeth 2\", with Annie and Hallie as bridesmaids, and Martin proposing to Chessy.\n\n\nLohan's mother, Dina, and siblings, Michael, Aliana and Cody, all appear in uncredited cameos at the airport.\n\nPrincipal photography started on July 15, 1997, in London, United Kingdom, and continued in Napa Valley AVA, San Francisco, Lake Arrowhead, and Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe song used in the opening sequence in which glimpses of Nick and Elizabeth's first wedding is seen is Nat King Cole's \"L-O-V-E\". The song used in the end credits, in which photos of Nick and Elizabeth's second wedding is seen, is his daughter Natalie Cole's \"This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)\".\n\nThe instrumental music featured prominently in the hotel scene where the girls and their parents cross paths serendipitously is \"In the Mood\", which was previously made famous by the Glenn Miller band. Later in the hotel, Hallie sings a few bars of \"Let's Get Together\", a tune from the first version of the film that was a hit for its star, Hayley Mills. The song is also quoted over the Walt Disney Pictures logo, and at the end of Alan Silvestri's closing credits suite.\n\nWhen Hallie shows up at Annie's poker game at Camp Walden, the music used is \"Bad to the Bone\" by George Thorogood and the Destroyers.\n\nThe background song heard in the campfire scene is \"How Bizarre\" by the music group OMC.\nThe tune playing as Hallie and Annie are making their way up to the Isolation Cabin is the main theme from \"The Great Escape\" by Elmer Bernstein.\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 86% approval rating with an average rating of 6.8/10 based on 50 reviews. The website's consensus states: \"Writer-director Nancy Meyers takes the winning formula of the 1961 original and gives it an amiable modern spin, while young star Lindsay Lohan shines in her breakout role.\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 64/100, based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\n\nGene Siskel and Roger Ebert each gave the film three stars. Critic Kenneth Turan called Lohan \"the soul of this film as much as Hayley Mills was of the original\", going on to say that \"she is more adept than her predecessor at creating two distinct personalities\".\nLohan won a Young Artist Award for best performance in a feature film.\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed $11,148,497 in 2,247 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking #2 at the box office, behind \"Saving Private Ryan\". By the end of its run, \"The Parent Trap\" grossed $66,308,518 domestically and $25,800,000 internationally, totaling $92,108,518 worldwide. The film was released in the United Kingdom on December 11, 1998, and opened on #3, behind \"Rush Hour\" and \"The Mask of Zorro\".\n\nIn February 2018, it was revealed that remakes of several films are in development as exclusive content for Walt Disney Studios' upcoming streaming service Disney+; with one of those named in the announcement being \"The Parent Trap\".\n\n"}

It is the first film Aykroyd made after the death of John Belushi as well as the first one where he is not sharing the top bill with other actors. Aykroyd and his co-star Dixon married soon after the film's release.\n\nIntroverted geek Clifford Skridlow (Dan Aykroyd) is a professor of comparative literature at the financially strapped (fictional) Monroe College in Chicago.\n\nSmooth Walker (Howard Hesseman), a pimp, owes $80,000 to \"Mom\" (Kate Murtagh), a gruff Chicago mob boss. Attempting to weasel out of his debt, Smooth invents a fictitious mobster, the flamboyant \"Doctor Detroit\", a ruthless chiropractor who allegedly is overrunning Smooth's turf. Clifford meets Smooth and his girls Monica (Donna Dixon), Jasmine (Lydia Lei), Karen (Fran Drescher), and Thelma (Lynn Whitfield), and has the best night of his life partying with them. The next morning, during a faculty meeting, Clifford learns about their troubles with Mom, that Smooth has skipped town, and that according to Smooth, they are now Clifford's girls. Clifford agrees to assume the persona of Doctor Detroit in an effort to help them out of their jam.\n\nMeanwhile, Monroe College anticipates a corporate endowment from Rousehorn Consolidated Industries to be presented by its CEO, Harmon Rousehorn (Andrew Duggan). If the contribution is large enough, it will allow the college to remain open.\n\nWhile Clifford is teaching classes, grading papers, catering a faculty party and assisting in hosting the visiting CEO, his Doctor Detroit alter ego has to find a way to get Thelma out of a solicitation charge, hold Mom at bay, and appear at the Players Ball to be proclaimed the new King of the Pimps while simultaneously appearing at Monroe College's annual Alumni Dinner. When Mom shows up at the Players Ball, she figures out that Doctor Detroit and Professor Skridlow are one and the same, and duels him with sword-length kebab skewers in front of the assembled academics. Following the defeat of Mom, the two functions combine into one joyous, spectacular party, as the ultimate fates of the characters are revealed, ending with the reveal that Clifford married Karen.\n\n\nThe film was shot on location in Chicago and Evanston, Illinois, as well as at the University of Southern California and Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, California, during the summer of 1982.\n\nJames Brown makes a cameo appearance in the film, performing \"Get Up Offa That Thing/Dr. Detroit.\" Devo performed the \"Theme from Doctor Detroit,\" which plays over the opening credits, as well as \"Luv-Luv,\" and released an EP including both tracks and a longer dance remix of the theme song. A music video was also produced for the theme song, incorporating footage from the film.\n\nA soundtrack album for the film was released on the labels Backstreet, MCA and WEA.\n\nThe film received generally negative reviews from critics. Writing in the Chicago Tribune, critic Gene Siskel gave the film two and a half stars and called it \"a mess, but a genial mess.\" Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 33% of six critics have given the film a positive review.\n\nIn her autobiography, \"Enter Whining\", Fran Drescher commented that \"Doctor Detroit\" was expected to be a major hit for the summer of 1983 but fell short of expectations, grossing $10.8 million on a budget of $8 million. Despite this, \"Doctor Detroit\" has developed a cult following over the years.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2236341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236341", "title": "Systematic desensitization", "text": "Systematic desensitization\n\nSystematic desensitization, also known as graduated exposure therapy, is a type of behavior therapy developed by South African psychiatrist, Joseph Wolpe. It is used in the field of clinical psychology to help many people effectively overcome phobias and other anxiety disorders that are based on classical conditioning, and shares the same elements of both cognitive-behavioral therapy and applied behavior analysis. When used by the behavior analysts, it is based on radical behaviorism, as it incorporates counterconditioning principles, such as meditation (a private behavior/covert conditioning) and breathing (which is a public behavior/overt conditioning). From the cognitive psychology perspective, however, cognitions and feelings trigger motor actions.\n\nThe process of systematic desensitization occurs in three steps. The first step of systematic desensitization is the identification of an anxiety inducing stimulus hierarchy. The second step is the learning of relaxation or coping techniques. When the individual has been taught these skills, he or she must use them in the third step to react towards and overcome situations in the established hierarchy of fears. The goal of this process is for the individual to learn how to cope with, and overcome the fear in each step of the hierarchy.\n\nThere are three main steps that Wolpe identified to successfully desensitize an individual.\n\nA client may approach a therapist due to their great phobia of snakes. This is how the therapist would help the client using the three steps of systematic desensitization:\n\nSpecific phobias are one class of mental disorder often treated via systematic desensitization. When persons experience such phobias (for example fears of heights, dogs, snakes, closed spaces, etc.), they tend to avoid the feared stimuli; this avoidance, in turn, can temporarily reduce anxiety but is not necessarily an adaptive way of coping with it. In this regard, patients' avoidance behaviors can become reinforced – a concept defined by the tenets of operant conditioning. Thus, the goal of systematic desensitization is to overcome avoidance by gradually exposing patients to the phobic stimulus, until that stimulus can be tolerated. Wolpe found that systematic desensitization was successful 90% of the time when treating phobias.\n\nIn 1947, Wolpe discovered that the cats of Wits University could overcome their fears through gradual and systematic exposure. Wolpe studied Ivan Pavlov's work on artificial neuroses and the research done on elimination of children's fears by Watson and Jones. In 1958, Wolpe did a series of experiments on the artificial induction of neurotic disturbance in cats. He found that gradually deconditioning the neurotic animals was the best way to treat them of their neurotic disturbances. Wolpe deconditioned the neurotic cats through different feeding environments. Wolpe knew that this treatment of feeding would not generalize to humans and he instead substituted relaxation as a treatment to relieve the anxiety symptoms.\n\nWolpe found that if he presented a client with the actual anxiety inducing stimulus, the relaxation techniques did not work. It was difficult to bring all of the objects into his office because not all anxiety inducing stimuli are physical objects, but instead are concepts. Wolpe instead began to have his clients imagine the anxiety inducing stimulus or look at pictures of the anxiety inducing stimulus, much like the process that is done today.\n\nDesensitization is widely known as one of the most effective therapy techniques. In recent decades, systematic desensitization has become less commonly used as a treatment of choice for anxiety disorders. Since 1970 academic research on systematic desensitization has declined, and the current focus has been on other therapies. In addition, the number of clinicians using systematic desensitization has also declined since 1980. Those clinicians that continue to regularly use systematic desensitization were trained before 1986. It is believed that the decrease of systematic desensitization by practicing psychologist is due to the increase in other techniques such as flooding, implosive therapy, and participant modeling.\n\nBetween 25 and 40 percent of students experience test anxiety. Children can suffer from low self-esteem and stress induced symptoms as a result of test anxiety. The principles of systematic desensitization can be used by children to help reduce their test anxiety. Children can practice the muscle relaxation techniques by tensing and relaxing different muscle groups. With older children and college students, an explanation of desensitization can help to increase the effectiveness of the process. After these students learn the relaxation techniques, they can create an anxiety inducing hierarchy. For test anxiety these items could include not understanding directions, finishing on time, marking the answers properly, spending too little time on tasks, or underperforming. Teachers, school counselors or school psychologists could instruct children on the methods of systematic desensitization.\n\n\n"}

It was first predicted in a 1990 paper by Klaus Scharnhorst of the Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany. He showed using quantum electrodynamics that the effective refractive index \"n\", at low frequencies, in the space between the plates was less than 1. Barton and Scharnhorst in 1993 claimed that either signal velocity can exceed \"c\" or that imaginary part of \"n\" is negative.\n\nVacuum fluctuations exist even in a perfect vacuum. The vacuum fluctuations are influenced by conducting plates nearby. As a photon travels through a vacuum its propagation is influenced by these vacuum fluctuations.\n\nA prediction made by this assertion is that the speed of a photon will be increased if it travels between two Casimir plates. The ultimate effect would be to increase the apparent speed of that photon. The closer the plates are, the stronger the change in the vacuum fluctuations, and the higher the speed of light.\n\nThe effect, however, is predicted to be minuscule. A photon traveling between two plates that are 1 micrometer apart would increase the photon's speed by only about one part in 10. This change in light's speed is too small to be detected with current technology, which prevents the Scharnhorst effect from being tested at this time.\n\nThe possibility of superluminal photons has caused concern because it might allow for the violation of causality by sending information faster than \"c\". However, several authors (including Scharnhorst) argue that the Scharnhorst effect cannot be used to create causal paradoxes.\n\nIt has been hypothesized by an American physicist, Timothy Retter, that the Scharnhorst effect may be demonstrated and detected via an amplifiable acoustical phenomenon. Specifically, an analogous effect to the Scharnhorst effect may be detectable between two sonic black holes. In this region, the speed of sound may surpass the maximum speed possible given the refractive index of the fluid.\n"}

{"id": "2236463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236463", "title": "Hans Litten", "text": "Hans Litten\n\nHans Achim Litten (19 June 1903 – 5 February 1938) was a German lawyer who represented opponents of the Nazis at important political trials between 1929 and 1932, defending the rights of workers during the Weimar Republic.\n\nDuring one , Litten subpoenaed Adolf Hitler, to appear as a witness, where Litten then cross-examined Hitler for three hours. Hitler was so rattled by the experience that, years later, he would not allow Litten's name to be mentioned in his presence. In retaliation, Litten was arrested on the night of the Reichstag fire along with other progressive lawyers and leftists. Litten spent the rest of his life in one German concentration camp or another, enduring torture and many interrogations. After five years and a move to Dachau, where his treatment worsened and he was cut off from all outside communication, he committed suicide.\n\nA number of memorials to him exist in Germany, but Litten was largely ignored for decades because his politics did not fit comfortably in either the west or the communist postwar propaganda. Not until 2011 was Litten finally portrayed in the mass media, when the BBC broadcast \"The Man Who Crossed Hitler\", a television film set in Berlin in summer 1931.\n\nLitten was born the eldest of three sons in a wealthy family in Halle. His parents were Irmgard (née Wüst) and Friedrich Litten (Fritz). Fritz was born and raised Jewish, but converted to Lutheranism in order to further his career as a law professor. He was a nationalist conservative, and served in the army in World War I, earning the Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd Class. He opposed the postwar Weimar Republic. A distinguished jurist and professor of Roman and civil law, he was dean of Königsberg's law school, later becoming rector of that institution. He was also privy counsel (\"Geheimer Justizrat\") and adviser to the Prussian government. Irmgard was from an established Lutheran family in Swabia, the daughter of Albert Wüst, a professor at the University of Halle-Wittenberg. The family left Halle in 1906 and moved to Königsberg in Prussia.\n\nLitten himself was baptized a Christian, but as a youngster learned Hebrew, choosing it as one of the subjects for his \"Abitur\" examinations. From his mother, Litten acquired an interest in humanitarian ideas and art, and gained a strong sense of justice for the threatened, persecuted and disenfranchised. While his father was away at war, Litten once took food from the kitchen to give to a beggar, addressing him as \"sir\". Litten's relationship with his father was strained, and his initial interest in Judaism was out of rebellion; he felt his father's conversion was opportunistic. Litten became interested in a German-Jewish youth group with socialist-revolutionary ideas, joining with a school friend, Max Fürst. Nonetheless, at times, he considered himself a Christian. In Dachau he was registered as a Jew, and had to wear the yellow star on his clothing.\n\nLitten sought out political debate in his youth. He was shaped by important political and social events of the era, such as World War I, the anti-war demonstration in Berlin on 1 May 1916, when Litten was not quite 13, the German Revolution of 1918–1919, and the arrest and murder of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg by Freikorps soldiers in January 1919. There is an anecdote from Litten's school years, when he was asked in the classroom if they should hang a picture of Paul von Hindenburg, victor of the 1914 Battle of Tannenberg. Litten stated, \"I've always been in favour of hanging him.\"\n\nLitten was pressed into studying law by his father. He was not interested in it, writing in his journal, \"When the ox in paradise was bored, he invented jurisprudence.\" He wanted to study art history, but nonetheless, he approached his law studies in Berlin and Munich with intensity, inspired by the events of the day. The Kapp Putsch, the 1924 court case against Adolf Hitler and other events convinced Litten that Germany was approaching a very dangerous period. His perception that right-wing radicals were receiving more lenient treatment in court than their opponents led to his decision to become a lawyer.\n\nLitten passed his examinations in 1927 with excellent grades and was offered a lucrative job in the Reich Ministry of Justice, as well as a good position in a flourishing law firm. He declined both choosing instead to open a law office in 1928 with Dr. Ludwig Barbasch, a friend who was close to the Communist Party.\n\nPolitically Litten was on the left, though independent. He valued his independence and once said, \"two people would be one too many for my party.\" Culturally, Litten was conservative, enjoying classical music and poetry such as that of Rainer Maria Rilke, whose work he could recite. He was an internationalist and was able to read English, Italian, and Sanskrit and enjoyed the music of the Middle East. He had a photographic memory and was considered to have a brilliant intellect.\n\nIn May 1931, Litten summoned Adolf Hitler to testify in the , a court case involving two workers stabbed by four SA men. Litten cross examined Hitler for three hours, finding many points of contradiction and proving that Hitler had exhorted the SA to embark on a systematic campaign of violence against the Nazis' enemies. This was crucial because Hitler was meanwhile trying to pose as a conventional politician to middle class voters and maintained that the Nazi Party was \"strictly legal\". Though a judge halted Litten's questioning, thus saving Hitler from further damning exposure, newspapers at the time reported on the trial in detail and Hitler was investigated for perjury that summer. He survived the investigation intact, but was rattled by the experience.\n\nBy 1932, the Nazi party was in ascendancy. Litten's mother and friends were urging him to leave Germany, but he stayed. He said, \"The millions of workers can't leave here, so I must stay too\". Hitler's hatred for Litten was not forgotten and in the early hours of 28 February 1933, the night of the Reichstag fire, he was rousted from his bed, arrested and taken into protective custody. Litten's colleagues Ludwig Barbasch and Professor were also arrested.\n\nLitten was first sent – without trial – to Spandau Prison. From there, he was moved from camp to camp, despite efforts by his mother to free him, along with jurists and prominent people from in and outside Germany, such as Clifford Allen and the \"European Conference for Rights and Freedom\", which had members from several countries. Litten was sent to Sonnenburg concentration camp, Brandenburg-Görden Prison, where he was tortured, along with anarchist Erich Mühsam. In February 1934, he was moved to the \"Moorlager\", Esterwegen concentration camp in Emsland and a few months later, he was sent to Lichtenburg.\n\nThe treatment Litten suffered was later described to his mother by an eyewitness. Very early on, he was beaten so badly that the Nazis refused to let even his fellow prisoners see him. He was tortured and forced into hard labor. He attempted suicide in 1933 in an attempt to avoid endangering his former clients, but he was revived by the Nazis so that they could interrogate him further. Litten's suicide attempt came at Spandau Prison, after he buckled under torture administered to extract information about the Felsenecke trial (see below). After revealing some information, he was immediately accused in the press as an accomplice to the murder of an SA man. Litten then wrote a letter to the Gestapo, saying that evidence gained in such a manner was not true and that he recanted. Knowing what awaited him, he then attempted to take his life.\n\nLitten's mother wrote about his ordeal, recounting how injuries sustained by him early on left his health permanently damaged. One eye and one leg were injured, never recovering; his jawbone fractured; inner ear damaged; and many teeth knocked out. She also related how, despite her access to many important people in Germany at that time, including Reichswehrminister Werner von Blomberg, Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, Reichsbischof Ludwig Müller, Minister of Justice Franz Gürtner and even then-State Secretary Roland Freisler, she was unable to secure her son's release.\n\nDespite his injuries and suffering, Litten strove to maintain his spirits. At one point, in 1934, his situation improved a little bit when he was moved to Lichtenburg. Initially, it was the same, with more beatings, but then he was allowed to work in the book bindery and the library. On occasion, he was able to listen to music on the radio on Sundays. He was well liked and respected by his fellow prisoners for his knowledge, inner strength and courage. One prisoner wrote about a party (allowed by the SS) at which a number of SS men were in attendance. Unafraid of their presence, Litten recited the lyrics of a song that had meant a lot to him in his youth, \"Thoughts are free\" (in German, \"Die Gedanken sind frei\"). The prisoner said that apparently the SS men did not grasp the significance of the words.\n\nIn summer 1937, Litten was sent to Buchenwald concentration camp for a month, before finally being sent to Dachau. He arrived on 16 October 1937 and was put in the Jewish barracks. The Jewish prisoners were isolated from others because Jews in other countries were then spreading the grim news about Dachau. Litten's last letter to his family, written in November 1937, spoke of the situation, adding that the Jewish prisoners were soon to be denied mail privileges until further notice. All letters from Jewish prisoners at Dachau ceased at this time.\n\nIn the face of their depressing situation, the Jews at Dachau made efforts to have culture and discussion in their lives, to keep their spirits up. Litten would recite Rilke for hours and he impressed the other prisoners with his knowledge on many subjects. Underneath, however, Litten was losing hope. On 5 February 1938, after five years of interrogation and torture and a failed escape attempt, Litten was found by several friends from his barracks, hanging in the lavatory, a suicide.\nThe day before his suicide, one of Litten's friends, Alfred Dreifuß, found a noose under Litten's pillow. He showed it to the blockälteste, who said it wasn't the first that had been found in Litten's possession. At the time, Litten was under interrogation in the \"bunker\" (see photo). When he came back, he was clearly in a suicidal frame of mind, repeating several times that he \"must speak with Heinz Eschen\", a prisoner who had just died. He also had recently told his friends that he'd had enough of being imprisoned. Another of Litten's Dachau friends, Alfred Grünebaum, said later that Litten was in constant fear of more brutal interrogations and that Litten had given up on ever being free. On the evening of 4 February 1938, it was clear what Litten had in mind, but no one kept watch. In the middle of the night, his bed was discovered empty and his friends found him hanging in the lavatory. Litten wrote a few parting words and that he had decided to take his life.\n\nRight away, during one of his first trials, Litten caused a sensation, setting the stage for his future as a \"labor lawyer\". He represented workers who were sentenced in March 1921 to a long term at hard labor in a \"Zuchthaus\" for organized resistance against a police raid of a mass uprising in the central German industrial region a year earlier. The police raid was ordered by the Prussian Minister of the Interior, Carl Severing. Litten was able to get some of the workers recognized as political actors, making them eligible under the amnesty law of August 1920.\n\nThrough his law partner, Barbasch, Litten got involved with the \"Rote Hilfe\", a solidarity organization founded by Wilhelm Pieck and Clara Zetkin that supported worker's families in dire need during the turbulent early years of the Weimar Republic. In addition, the \"Rote Hilfe\" arranged legal support and legal defense for workers who were under indictment for their political activities or views. By mid 1929, the \"Rote Hilfe\" had helped nearly 16,000 arrested workers with legal defense and supported the legal rights of another 27,000 cases.\n\nIn 1929, Litten defended participants in the 1929 May Day rally in Berlin, known as Blutmai (\"Bloody May 1929\"). Annual workers' rallies on 1 May had been taking place since 1889. In 1929, however, the rally turned bloody when the police intervened with excessive force. Confrontations between demonstrators and police erupted and the police began firing into crowds and buildings, killing 33 and injuring hundreds, including many bystanders. The workers were charged with severe breach of the peace and with sedition.\n\nIn preparation for a defense, Litten founded a committee with Alfred Döblin, Heinrich Mann and Carl von Ossietzky to investigate the event. Litten himself had been at the demonstration and observed the brutal actions of the police. When he went to one man's aid and began writing down the names of victims and eyewitnesses, he was himself beaten by a policeman, even though he had identified himself as a lawyer. Litten filed an indictment against the Berlin police president, , for 33 counts of incitement to commit murder. In his legal notice, he stated:\n\nLitten's approach was to focus on the legality of the police actions. Rather than pursue individual police officers, he sought to hold the authority, the police chief, to account and he held that Zörgiebel had ordered the police to use truncheons and live ammunition against the demonstrators. If the police action was illegal under the criminal code, the resulting deaths were then murders and anything done by the demonstrators to resist was \"self-defense in the full legal sense\". He argued that Zörgiebel had ordered the police invasion for political, rather than policing considerations. As proof, he produced a 2 May 1929 article from the \"Berliner Tageblatt\", where Zörgiebel had written a defense of his actions that showed its political basis. According to Prussian law, police could use \"necessary measures\" to maintain public peace and security or prevent a public danger; in other words, it was to be police work and not the result of political conditions.\nThe indictment of Zörgiebel was rejected by the state prosecutors and Litten appealed. Zörgiebel turned around and filed charges against a worker who had slapped his ear. Litten then took on this worker's defense, arguing that the worker had acted out of justifiable anger about Zörgiebel's 33 murders. The justice rejected Litten's request to produce evidence on the grounds that the 33-count murder indictment against Zörgiebel could be accepted as fact without dropping the culpability of the worker who had hit Zörgiebel on the ear.\nThe objective in Litten's many lawsuits for the victims of the police attacks and raids was not to litigate individual incidents, but rather to warn about the growing fascism in the country. He worked to put Nazi terror on display, in the hopes it would awaken the public to the threat facing them. He saw the methods of the police as approaching those of civil war and as being illegal and worked to prove that in court and to pursue the responsible parties wherever they were, even in the highest political circles. He wasn't interested in creating socialist martyrs, rather he sought acquittal or an appropriate punishment, which caused him some conflicts with the Rote Hilfe and the KPD.\n\nOn November 22, 1930, an SA Rollkommando attacked a popular dance hall frequented predominantly by left-wing workers. The victims were members of a migrant workers' association that was holding a meeting at the Tanzpalast Eden (\"Eden Dance Palace\") in Berlin. Three people were killed and 20 injured in an attack that was planned in advance. The subsequent police investigation was plodding and slow.\n\nLitten used four of the injured to represent the plaintiff, seeking to prove three cases of attempted manslaughter, breach of the peace and assault. In addition to pursuing criminal convictions of the offenders, Litten wanted to show that the Nazis intentionally used terror as a tactic to destroy the democratic structures of the Weimar Republic. Hitler was summoned to appear as a witness in court to that end.\n\nShortly before, in September 1930, Hitler had appeared in Leipzig as a witness at the \"Ulm Reichswehr Trial\" against two officers charged with conspiracy to commit treason for having had membership in the Nazi Party, at that time, forbidden to Reichswehr personnel. Hitler had insisted that his party operated legally, that the phrase \"National Revolution\" was to be interpreted only \"politically\", and that his Party was a friend, not an enemy of the Reichswehr. Under oath, Hitler had described the SA as an organization of \"intellectual enlightenment\" and explained his statement that \"heads will roll\" as a comment about \"intellectual revolution\".\n\nThe court called Hitler to appear on the witness stand on 8 May 1931. Litten set out to show that the SA \"Sturm 33\" (\"Storm 33\") was a \"rollkommando\" (a small, mobile paramilitary unit, generally murderous) and that its attack of the Eden and the resulting murders were undertaken with the knowledge of the party leadership. This would mean that the Nazi Party was not, in fact, a legal and democratic organization and would undermine Hitler's efforts to be seen as a serious politician and statesman.\n\nHitler never forgot the Eden trial, and held a personal antipathy towards Litten. Years later, Litten's name still could not be mentioned in Hitler's presence. Roland Freisler quoted Franz Gürtner as saying, \"No one will be able to do anything for Litten. Hitler turned red with rage from just hearing Litten's name, once bellowing at Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, 'Anyone who advocates for Litten lands in the concentration camp, even you.'\"\n\nLitten: (…) Did you know that in the circles of the SA there is talk of a special \"rollkommando\"?\nHitler: I haven't heard anything about a \"rollkommando\". (…)\nLitten: You said that there will be no violent acts on the part of the National Socialist Party. Didn't Goebbels create the slogan, \"one must pound the adversary to a pulp?\"\nHitler: This is to be understood as \"one must dispatch and destroy opposing organizations\". (…)\n(The presiding judge read a question formulated by Litten): Did Hitler, as he named Goebbels \"Reichsleiter\" (Leader for the empire) of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, know of the passage from his book, where Goebbels declares that fear of the coup d'état cannot be permitted, that parliament should be blown up and the government hunted to hell and where the call to revolution was made again, letter-spaced?\nHitler: I can no longer testify under oath, if I knew Goebbels' book at the time. The theme (…) is absolutely of no account to the Party, as the booklet doesn't bear the Party emblem and is also not officially sanctioned by the Party. (…)\nLitten: Must it not be measured against Goebbels' example, to awaken the notion in the Party, that the legality scheme is not far away, if you neither reprimanded nor shut out a man like Goebbels, rather straightaway made him head of Reich Propaganda?\nHitler: The entire Party stands on legal ground and Goebbels (…) likewise. (…) He is in Berlin and can be called here any time.\nLitten: Has Herr Goebbels prohibited the further dissemination of his work?\nHitler: I don't know.\n[In the afternoon, Litten returned to this subject.]\nLitten: Is it correct that Goebbels' revolutionary journal, \"The Commitment to Illegality\" \"[Das Bekenntnis zur Illegalität]\", has now been taken over by the Party and has reached a circulation of 120,000? (…) I have concluded that the journal is sanctioned by the Party. (…)\nPresiding judge: Herr Hitler, in point of fact, you testified this morning, that Goebbels' work is not official Party [material].\nHitler: And it isn't, either. A publication is an official Party [organ] when it bears the emblem of the Party.\n\nHitler (shouting, red-faced): How dare you say, Herr Attorney, that is an invitation to illegality? That is a statement without proof!\nLitten: How is it possible that the Party publishing house takes over a journal that stands in stark contrast to the Party line?\nPresiding judge: That doesn't have anything to do with this trial.\n\nThe Felseneck Trial was Litten's last major fight against the Nazi Party. On trial were five Nazis and 19 residents of the Felseneck arbor colony, where many left-wing workers, including Communists and Social Democrats, were living. In January 1932, there was a brawl involving about 150 storm troopers and colony residents. The troopers surrounded the colony and attacked with stones and firearms. Two people were killed, Ernst Schwartz, a member of the Berlin SA and Fritz Klemke, a Communist; several others, including two police officers, were injured. The resulting trial had numerous defendants and hundreds of witnesses.\n\nLitten's meticulousness began to annoy both the presiding judge and the prosecutors, who began to conspire to get Litten removed from the trial. Although there were no legal grounds, the court expelled Hans Litten both as counsel and ancillary counsel for the plaintiff because he had \"unfurled unrestrained partisan propaganda in the trial\" and \"made the courtroom a hotbed of political passions\". This decision was set aside by the court of appeals, whereupon the presiding judge and an official from the criminal division declared the trial to be biased and the trial was unable to proceed.\n\nShortly after that, Litten was again removed from a high court, having been accused of influencing a witness. This time, the action was sustained by the \"Kammergericht\" (Supreme Court) and the court commented further during an investigation of the defense, that the main trial was generally inadmissible. This caused an uproar in the community of Berlin lawyers, including those who were not well-disposed toward Litten. A meeting of Berlin attorneys demanded a change to the law in order to prevent such a curtailment of the fundamental rights of defense attorneys.\n\nLitten was excoriated in the Nazi press as the \"Red Death Defender\" and readers were urged to \"Put a stop to his dirty work\". It was no longer possible for Litten to go out in public without a bodyguard.\n\nAside from several memorials in Germany, after the war Litten remained unknown for decades because neither western nor communist governments found him suitable for their cold war propaganda. For the west, Litten had been too involved with communists and for communists, Litten's rejection of Stalinism made him a pariah.\nWhen East and West Germany were reunited, the lawyers association of Berlin chose to call itself the Hans Litten Bar Association. Every two years, a lawyer is given the \"Hans Litten Prize\" by the German and European Democratic Lawyers Association. The Israeli lawyer, Leah Tsemel, and Michael Ratner, an American lawyer and the president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, have both received the award. There is a memorial plaque for Litten located on the former \"Neue Friedrichstraße\", renamed in Litten's honor in 1951. The federal and Berlin bar associations (\"Bundesrechtsanwaltskammer\" and \"Rechtsanwaltskammer Berlin\") have their headquarters at the Hans Litten Haus, also on Littenstraße (see photo).\n\nIn 2008, the first in-depth biography of Litten in English was written. Author Benjamin Carter Hett, a historian and former lawyer, came across Litten while working on another book. Commenting on the relevance of Litten's life today and the treatment he suffered while imprisoned, Hett said:\n\nIn 2011 Litten's story was filmed by the BBC. \"The Man Who Crossed Hitler\" was written by Mark Hayhurst and directed by Justin Hardy. The role of Hans Litten was played by Ed Stoppard. Hayhurst has also written a play on Litten's life, entitled \"Taken At Midnight\", which premiered at Chichester Festival Theatre in September 2014 and transferred to Theatre Royal, Haymarket, London in January 2015.\n\nHans Litten is played by German actor Trystan Putter in Season 3 of the TV show Babylon Berlin.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a remake of Tony Scott's \"Man on Fire\", a film based on a novel of the same name, which was also adapted into another film in 1987.\n\n\"Ek Ajnabee\" was released theatrically on 9 December 2005.\n\nColonel Suryaveer \"Surya\" Singh (Amitabh Bachchan) is a bitter man and ex-Army officer, hired by his friend and former comrade Captain Shekhar Verma (Arjun Rampal) to protect a little girl, Anamika R. Rathore (Rucha Vaidya), who resides in Bangkok, Thailand with her Non-resident Indian (NRI) family. He drinks alcohol frequently, and is not interested in befriending the girl. Eventually, she wins his heart and he helps her to prepare for a swim meet. One day Anamika gets kidnapped and Surya receives serious injuries in his attempt to prevent the kidnapping. Her father is not able to pay the sum to release his daughter. So Suryaveer uses all his skills to save the life of the child, only to find out about the conspiracy that is behind the little girl's kidnapping. Surya learns that Chang, Shekhar's lawyer, is behind some of this. The real mastermind behind this is Chang's brother. Surya holds Chang hostage, while Chang's brother holds Anamika hostage.

In the end, Anamika gets a new bodyguard and the film shows her during her swimming practice, with Surya and her new bodyguard 15 years later.\n\nApoorva Lakhia said that the script was written with the lead actor, Amitabh Bachchan, in mind. Lakhia explained that \"\"Man on Fire\" has been made into four films in five different languages. So this is the Indian version. It has all the necessarily ingredients required for a movie to come out of India.\" Vikram Chatwal, who plays Ravi Rathore in the film, said \"People talk a lot about cross cultural films. These films don't necessarily have to be like Monsoon Wedding or Bend It Like Beckham. This is not another Hindi film. This is not a remake of \"Man on Fire\". If you see the way it is shot, edited and directed, it is setting new standards. Mr Bachchan is reinventing himself. So please don't turn this film into another Bollywood film.\"\n\nThe film was shot on location in Bangkok, Thailand, for 35 days. Lakhia said that he and Bunty Walia, a producer, chose Bangkok because \"we wanted our characters to stand out. When they are walking on the street they will look different.

{"id": "2236472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236472", "title": "Transformers (film)", "text": "Transformers (film)\n\nTransformers is a 2007 American science fiction action film based on the Transformers toy line. The film, which combines computer animation with live-action filming, was directed by Michael Bay, with Steven Spielberg serving as executive producer. It was produced by Don Murphy and Tom DeSanto, and is the first installment in the live-action \"Transformers\" film series. The film stars Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets caught up in a war between the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into everyday machinery, primarily vehicles. The Autobots intend to retrieve and use the AllSpark, the object that created their robotic race that is on Earth, to rebuild their home planet Cybertron and end the war, while the Decepticons have the intention of using it to build an army by giving life to the machines of Earth. Tyrese Gibson, Josh Duhamel, Anthony Anderson, Megan Fox, Rachael Taylor, John Turturro, and Jon Voight also star, while voice actors Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving voice Optimus Prime and Megatron respectively.\n\nMurphy and DeSanto developed the project in 2003, and DeSanto wrote a treatment. Steven Spielberg came on board the following year, hiring Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman to write the screenplay. The U.S. Armed Forces and General Motors (GM) loaned vehicles and aircraft during filming, which saved money for the production and added realism to the battle scenes. Hasbro's promotional campaign for the film included deals with various companies; advertising included a viral marketing campaign, coordinated releases of , toys, and books, as well as product placement deals with companies such as GM, Burger King, and eBay.\n\n\"Transformers\" received mixed reviews from critics and a positive response from audiences. It became the 28th highest-grossing film of all-time at the time of its release and was the fifth highest-grossing film of 2007, grossing $709 million worldwide, with an estimated 46 million tickets sold in the US. The film won four awards from the Visual Effects Society and was nominated for three Academy Awards, for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects. LaBeouf's performance was praised by \"Empire\", and Cullen's reprisal of Optimus Prime from the 1980s television series was well received by fans. The film was followed by four sequels, \"\" (2009), \"\" (2011), \"\" (2014), and \"\" (2017), as well as a reboot titled \"Bumblebee\" was released in 2018.\n\nSeveral thousand years ago, the planet Cybertron was consumed by a civil war between the two Transformer factions, the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron. Optimus jettisoned the Allspark, a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet, into space, but Megatron pursued it. Megatron crashed onto Earth, landing in the Arctic Circle and froze, and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Captain Archibald Witwicky. Witwicky inadvertently activated Megatron's navigational system, which etched the Allspark's coordinates into his glasses. The glasses eventually end up in the possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky.\n\nIn the present, Blackout attacks and destroys a United States military base in Qatar in a failed attempt to hack the military network to find information on Megatron and the AllSpark. A surviving team of Army Rangers led by Captain William Lennox escape across the desert, pursued by Blackout's drone Scorponok. They fight Scorponok off, aided by aerial reinforcements, and travel home with Scorponok's stinger, discovering sabot rounds damaged its armor. At the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense John Keller leads the investigation into the attack. Data analyst Maggie Madsen catches another Decepticon, Frenzy, hacking into the military network while onboard Air Force One. While the hack is thwarted, Frenzy downloads files on Archibald's glasses, tracking down Sam with Barricade, disguised as a police car. After Maggie proposes the possibility of the hacker not being human and gets told off by Secretary Keller, she makes a copy of the audio signal made during the hacking attempt and goes to her hacker friend Glen Whitmann to decode the signal. They discover fragments of a message mentioning \"Project Iceman\", \"Sector 7\", and Capt. Witwicky, but Maggie and Glen are promptly arrested for possessing classified information.\n\nMeanwhile, Sam buys his first car, a rusting Chevrolet Camaro, but discovers it has a life of its own. Sam and his high school crush Mikaela Banes are rescued from Barricade and Frenzy by the Camaro who turns out to be the Autobot scout Bumblebee, who has to communicate through his car radio due to being mute. Previously sending a beacon to his fellow Autobots, Bumblebee takes Sam and Mikaela to meet Optimus Prime, Jazz, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Optimus explains the details of the situation, revealing if Megatron gained the AllSpark he would transform Earth's machinery into a new army and exterminate mankind. Sam, Mikaela, and the Autobots travel to Sam's house to retrieve the glasses, but they are captured by agents of Sector Seven, a top-secret paramilitary government branch, led by Agent Seymour Simmons. The Autobots stop the agents but they call for backup, who take Sam, Mikaela, and Bumblebee into custody, though Optimus obtains the glasses and uses them to locate the Allspark.\n\nThe humans connected to the Transformers are gathered together at Hoover Dam by Sector Seven's director Tom Banachek, who reveals Megatron, still frozen, and the Allspark. Frenzy, having smuggled away in Mikaela's bag, disables Megatron's cryonics system and contacts Starscream, Megatron's second-in-command and acting leader of the Decepticons, who in turn summons Blackout, Barricade, Brawl, and Bonecrusher, the latter being killed by Optimus on a highway. Bumblebee is released to protect the Allspark, shrinking it to a handheld size so it can be transported to safety. Megatron escapes the dam after thawing out. Frenzy attacks Secretary Keller, Maggie, Glen, and Agent Simmons in the Dam's radio room, trying to prevent them from summoning the Air Force, but is decapitated by his own ricocheting shuriken and the group succeeds in calling for aerial support.\n\nA battle between the Autobots and Decepticons breaks out in Mission City. During the battle, Blackout is killed by an airstrike and Brawl is killed by the autobots and military. However, Megatron arrives, killing Jazz and preventing Sam's attempted escape with the Allspark. Optimus arrives to protect Sam and engages in a battle against Megatron, with the latter getting the upper hand until the military arrives. Optimus tells Sam to push the cube into his chest to ensure their mutual destruction, but instead Sam rams it into Megatron's chest, overloading his spark and killing him.\n\nOptimus salvages a shard of the Allspark from Megatron's mangled corpse. The United States government shuts down Sector Seven and disposes of the dead Decepticons in the Laurentian Abyss. Sam and Mikaela then start a romantic relationship while the Autobots secretly hide out on Earth, and Optimus sends a transmission into space inviting any surviving Autobots to join them.\n\nA brief mid-credits scene shows Starscream escaping into space.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2000, director Joseph Kahn pitched his treatment for a live-action Transformers film to Sony, but they eventually lost interest in a film.\nDon Murphy was planning a , but when the United States launched the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Hasbro suggested adapting the Transformers franchise instead. Tom DeSanto joined Murphy because he was a fan of the series. They met with comic book writer Simon Furman, and cited the cartoon and comics as their main influence. They made the Creation Matrix their plot device, though Murphy had it renamed because of the film series \"The Matrix\", but was later used again in . DeSanto chose to write the treatment from a human point of view to engage the audience, while Murphy wanted it to have a realistic tone, reminiscent of a disaster film. The treatment featured the Autobots Optimus Prime, Ironhide, Jazz, Prowl, Arcee, Ratchet, Wheeljack, and Bumblebee, and the Decepticons Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, Ravage, Laserbeak, Rumble, Skywarp and Shockwave.\n\nSteven Spielberg, a fan of the comics and toys, signed on as executive producer in 2004. John Rogers wrote the first draft, which pitted four Autobots against four Decepticons, and featured the Ark spaceship. Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, fans of the cartoon, were hired to rewrite the script in February 2005. Spielberg suggested that \"a boy and his car\" should be the focus. This appealed to Orci and Kurtzman because it conveyed themes of adulthood and responsibility, \"the things that a car represents in the United States\". The characters of Sam and Mikaela were the sole point of view given in Orci and Kurtzman's first draft. The Transformers had no dialogue, as the producers feared talking robots would look ridiculous. The writers felt that even if it would look silly, not having the robots speak would betray the fanbase. The first draft also had a battle scene in the Grand Canyon. Spielberg read each of Orci and Kurtzman's drafts and gave notes for improvement. The writers remained involved throughout production, adding additional dialogue for the robots during the sound mixing (although none of this was kept in the final film, which ran fifteen minutes shorter than the initial edit). Furman's \"The Ultimate Guide\", published by Dorling Kindersley, remained as a resource to the writers throughout production. \"Prime Directive\" was used as a fake working title. This was also the name of Dreamwave Productions' first .\n\nMichael Bay was asked to direct by Spielberg on July 30, 2005, but he dismissed the film as a \"stupid toy movie\". Nonetheless, he wanted to work with Spielberg, and gained a new respect for the concept upon visiting Hasbro. Bay considered the first draft \"too kiddie\", so he increased the military's role in the story. The writers sought inspiration from G.I. Joe for the soldier characters, being careful not to mix the brands. Bay based Lennox's struggle to get to the Pentagon phoneline while struggling with an unhelpful operator from a real account he was given by a soldier when working on another film.\n\nOrci and Kurtzman experimented with numerous robots from the franchise, ultimately selecting the characters most popular among the filmmakers to form the final cast. Bay acknowledged that most of the Decepticons were selected before their names or roles were developed, as Hasbro had to start designing the toys. Some of their names were changed because Bay was upset that they had been leaked. Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee and Starscream were the only characters present in each version of the script. Arcee was a female Transformer introduced by Orci and Kurtzman, but she was cut because they found it difficult to explain robotic gender; Bay also disliked her motorcycle form, which he found too small. An early idea to have the Decepticons simultaneously strike multiple places around the world was also dropped.\n\nThe filmmakers created the size of each robot with the size of their vehicle mode in mind, supporting the Transformer's rationale for their choice of disguise on Earth. The concept of traveling protoforms was developed by Roberto Orci when he wondered why \"aliens who moonlight as vehicles need other vehicles to travel\". This reflected a desire to move to a more alien look, away from the \"blocky\" Transformers. Another major influence in the designs was samurai armor, returning full-circle to the Japanese origins of the toy line. The robots also had to look alien, or else they would have resembled other cinematic robots made in the image of man.\n\nA product placement deal with General Motors supplied alternate forms for most of the Autobots, which saved $3 million for the production. GM also provided nearly two hundred cars, destined for destruction in the climactic battle scene. The U.S. Armed Forces provided significant support, enhancing the film's realism: the film features F-22s, F-117s, and V-22 Ospreys, the first time these aircraft were used for a film; soldiers served as extras, and authentic uniforms were provided for the actors. A-10 Thunderbolt IIs and Lockheed AC-130s also appear. Captain Christian Hodge joked that he had to explain to his superiors that the filmmakers wanted to portray most of their aircraft as evil Decepticons: however, he remarked \"people love bad guys\".\n\nTo save money for the production, Bay reduced his usual fee by 30%. He planned an 83-day shooting schedule, maintaining the required pace by doing more camera set-ups per day than usual. Bay chose to shoot the film in the United States instead of Australia or Canada, allowing him to work with a crew he was familiar with, and who understood his work ethic. A pre-shoot took place on April 19, 2006 and principal photography began three days later at Holloman Air Force Base, which stood in for Qatar. Due to their destruction later in the film by the Decepticon Blackout, the majority of the military structures shown on-screen were not property of Holloman Air Force Base, but were purchased ahead of filming from a private manufacturer of military shelter systems, AKS Military. To film the Scorponok sequence at White Sands Missile Range, a sweep was performed to remove unexploded ordnance before building of a village set could begin; ironically, the village would be blown up. The scene was broken down for the Air battle managers flying aboard the AWACS aircraft, who improvised dialogue as if it were an actual battle.\n\nThe company also shot at Hoover Dam and at the Pentagon, the first time since the September 11 attacks that film crews had been allowed at these locations. The external Hoover Dam scenes were shot before tourists arrived daily at 10:00 a.m., with shooting moving inside for the remainder of the day. Production in California was based at Hughes Aircraft at Playa Vista, where the hangar in which Megatron is imprisoned was built. Six weekends were spent in Los Angeles, California shooting the climactic battle, with some elements being shot on the Universal Studios backlot and at Detroit's Michigan Central Station. The crew was allowed to shoot at Griffith Observatory, which was still closed for renovations begun in 2002 and would reopen in November 2006. Filming wrapped on October 4, 2006.\n\nThe film has been found to re-use footage from Bay's previous film \"Pearl Harbor\" (2001).\n\nSpielberg encouraged Bay to restrict computer-generated imagery to the robots and background elements in the action sequences. Stunts such as Bonecrusher smashing through a bus were done practically, while cameras were placed into the midst of car crashes and explosions to make it look more exciting. Work on the animatics began in April 2005. Bay indicated that three quarters of the film's effects were made by Industrial Light & Magic, while Digital Domain made the rest, including the Arctic discovery of Megatron; Frenzy's severed head; a vending machine mutated by the Allspark, and the Autobots' protoforms. Many of the animators were big Transformers fans and were given free rein to experiment: a scene where Jazz attacks Brawl is a reference to a scene in \"\" where Kup jumps on Blitzwing.\n\nILM created computer-generated transformations during six months in 2005, looking at every inch of the car models. Initially the transformations were made to follow the laws of physics, but it did not look exciting enough and was changed to be more fluid. Bay rejected a liquid metal surface for the characters' faces, instead going for a \"Rubik's Cube\" style of modeling. He wanted numerous mechanical pieces visible so the robots would look more interesting, realistic, dynamic and quick, rather than like lumbering beasts. One such decision was to have the wheels stay on the ground for as long as possible, allowing the robots to cruise around as they changed. Bay instructed the animators to observe footage of two martial artists and numerous martial arts films to make the fights look graceful.\n\nDue to the intricate designs of the Transformers, even the simplest motion of turning a wrist needs 17 visible parts; each of Ironhide's guns are made of ten thousand parts. Bumblebee uses a piece below his face-plate as an eyebrow, pieces in his cheeks swivel to resemble a smile, and all the characters' eyes are designed to dilate and brighten. According to Bay, \"The visual effects were so complex it took a staggering 38 hours for ILM to render just one frame of movement\"; that meant ILM had to increase their processing facilities. Each rendered piece had to look like real metal, shiny or dull. This was difficult to model because the aged and scarred robots had to transform from clean cars. Close-up shots of the robots were sped up to look \"cool\", but in wide shots the animation was slowed down to convincingly illustrate a sense of weight. Photographs were taken of each set. These were used as a reference for the lighting environment, which was reproduced within a computer, so the robots would look like they were convincingly moving there. Bay, who has directed numerous car commercials, understood ray tracing was the key to making the robots look real; the CG models would look realistic based on how much of the environment was reflecting on their bodies. Numerous simulations were programmed into the robots, so the animators could focus on animating the particular areas needed for a convincing performance.\n\nComposer Steve Jablonsky, who collaborated with Bay on \"The Island\", scored music for the trailers before work began on the film itself. Recording took place in April 2007, at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, California. The score, including the teaser music, uses six major themes across ninety minutes of music. The Autobots have three themes, one named \"Optimus\" to represent the wisdom and compassion of the Autobot leader, and another played during their arrival on Earth. The Decepticons have a chanted theme which relies on electronics, unlike most of the score. The AllSpark also has its own theme. Hans Zimmer, Jablonsky's mentor, also helped to compose the score.\n\n\"Transformers\" had its worldwide premiere at N Seoul Tower on June 10, 2007. The film's June 27 premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival used a live digital satellite feed to project the film on to a screen. A premiere took place at Rhode Island on June 28, which was a freely available event giving attendees the opportunity to buy tickets for $75 to benefit four charities: the Rhode Island Community Food Bank, the Autism Project of Rhode Island, Adoption Rhode Island, and Hasbro Children's Hospital. The film was released in IMAX on September 21, 2007, with additional footage that had not been included in the general theatrical release.\n\nHasbro's toy line for the film was created over two months in late 2005 and early 2006, in heavy collaboration with the filmmakers. Protoform Optimus Prime and Starscream were released in the United States on May 1, 2007, and the first wave of figures was released on June 2. The line featured characters not in the film, including Arcee. A second wave, titled \"AllSpark Power\", was set for release late 2007, which consisted of repaints and robotic versions of ordinary vehicles in the film. The toys feature \"Automorph Technology\", where moving parts of the toy allow other parts to shift automatically. Merchandise for the film earned Hasbro $480 million in 2007.\n\nDeals were made with 200 companies to promote the film in 70 countries. Michael Bay directed tie-in commercials for General Motors, Panasonic, Burger King and PepsiCo, while props – including the Camaro used for Bumblebee and the AllSpark – were put up for charity sale on eBay. A viral marketing alternate reality game was employed through the Sector 7 website, which presented the film and all previous Transformers toys and media as part of a cover-up operation called \"Hungry Dragon\", perpetrated by a \"real life\" Sector 7 to hide the existence of genuine Transformers. The site featured several videos presenting \"evidence\" of Transformers on Earth, including a cameo from the original Bumblebee.\n\n\"Transformers\" was released on DVD and a discontinued HD DVD format on October 16, 2007 in North America. The Wal-Mart edition of the DVD included a shortened animated version of the , titled \"Transformers Beginnings\" and featuring the voices of Ryan, Cullen, and Dunn, as well as Welker as Megatron. The Target copy was packaged with a transforming Optimus Prime DVD case and a prequel comic book about the Decepticons. The DVD sold 8.3 million copies in its first week, making it the fastest-selling DVD of 2007, in North America, and it sold 190,000 copies on HD DVD, which was the biggest debut on the format. The DVDs sold 13.74 million copies, making the film the most popular DVD title of 2007.\n\nIt was released on Blu-ray on September 2, 2008. In the first week, the two-disc edition of the Blu-ray was number one in sales compared to other films on the format. The Blu-ray version accounted for two-thirds of the film's DVD sales that first week, selling the third most in overall DVD sales. On June 16, 2009, Paramount included a sticker on all new Transformers DVDs that contained a code to view exclusive content online from the first film and get a sneak peek at \"\". The content includes three exclusive clips from \"Revenge of the Fallen\", behind-the-scenes footage from both films, and never-before-seen deleted scenes from the first film. As of July 2012, in North America, the DVD of the film has sold 16.23 million copies, earning $292,144,274.\n\nTransformers was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on December 5, 2017.\n\n\"Transformers\" had the highest per-screen and per-theater gross in 2007 in North America. It was released on July 3, 2007 with preview screenings on July 2. The United States previews earned $8.8 million and in its first day of general release, it grossed $27.8 million, a record for Tuesday box-office gross until it was broken by \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" in 2012. It did, however, break \"Spider-Man 2\" record for the biggest July 4 gross, making $29 million. \"Transformers\" opened in over 4,050 theaters in North America and grossed $70.5 million in its first weekend, debuting at #1 and amounting to a $155.4 million opening week, giving it the record for the biggest opening week for a non-sequel. The opening's gross in the United States was 50% more than what Paramount Pictures had expected. One executive attributed it to word of mouth that explained to parents that \"it [was] OK to take the kids\". A CinemaScore poll indicated the film was most popular with children and parents, including older women, and attracted many African American and Latino viewers. \"Transformers\" ended its theatrical run in the United States and Canada with a gross of $319.2 million, making it the third highest-grossing film of 2007 in these regions behind \"Spider-Man 3\" and \"Shrek the Third\". The film sold an estimated 46,402,100 tickets in North America.\n\nThe film was released in 10 international markets on June 28, 2007, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the Philippines. \"Transformers\" made $29.5 million in its first weekend, topping the box office in 10 countries. It grossed $5.2 million in Malaysia, becoming the most successful film in the country's history. \"Transformers\" opened in China on July 11 and became the second highest-grossing foreign film in the country (behind \"Titanic\"), making $37.3 million. Its opening there set a record for a foreign language film, making $3 million. The film was officially released in the United Kingdom on July 27, making £8.7 million, and helped contribute to the biggest attendance record ever for that weekend. It was second at the UK box office, behind \"The Simpsons Movie\". In South Korea, \"Transformers\" recorded the largest audience for a foreign film in 2007 and the highest foreign revenue of the film.\n\nWorldwide, \"Transformers\" was the highest-grossing non-sequel film in 2007 with over $709.7 million, making it Bay's fourth highest-grossing film to date, with three of its sequels surpassing it. It was also the fifth highest-grossing film of 2007 worldwide, behind \"\", \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", \"Spider-Man 3\" and \"Shrek the Third\".\n\nReview aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 58% based on 227 reviews, with an average rating of 5.79/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"While believable characters are hard to come by in \"Transformers\", the effects are staggering and the action is exhilarating.\" On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 61 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\"IGN\" Todd Gilchrist called it Bay's best film, and \"one of the few instances where it's OK to enjoy something for being smart and dumb at the same time, mostly because it's undeniably also a whole lot of fun\". \"The Advertiser\" Sean Fewster found the visual effects so seamless that \"you may come to believe the studio somehow engineered artificial intelligence\". \"The Denver Post\" Lisa Kennedy praised the depiction of the robots as having \"a believably rendered scale and intimacy\", and ABC presenter Margaret Pomeranz was surprised \"that a complete newcomer to the Transformers phenomenon like myself became involved in the fate of these mega-machines\". Ain't It Cool News's Drew McWeeny felt most of the cast grounded the story, and that \"it has a real sense of wonder, one of the things that's missing from so much of the big CGI light shows released these days\". Author Peter David found it ludicrous fun, and said that \"[Bay] manages to hold on to his audience's suspension of disbelief long enough for us to segue into some truly spectacular battle scenes\". Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, giving it 3 stars out of a possible 4, writing: \"It's goofy fun with a lot of stuff that blows up real good, and it has the grace not only to realize how preposterous it is, but to make that into an asset.\"\n\nDespite the praise for the visual effects, there was division over the human storylines. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" Kirk Honeycutt liked \"how a teen plotline gets tied in to the end of the world\", while \"Empire\" Ian Nathan praised Shia LaBeouf as \"a smart, natural comedian, [who] levels the bluntness of this toy story with an ironic bluster\". \"Ain't It Cool News\" founder Harry Knowles felt Bay's style conflicted with Spielberg's, arguing the military story only served as a distraction from Sam. James Berardinelli hated the film as he did not connect with the characters in-between the action, which he found tedious. \"Los Angeles Times\" Kenneth Turan found the humans \"oddly lifeless, doing little besides marking time until those big toys fill the screen\", while ComingSoon.net's Joshua Starnes felt the Transformers were \"completely believable, right up to the moment they open their mouths to talk, when they revert to bad cartoon characters\". \"Daily Herald\" Matt Arado was annoyed that \"the Transformers [are] little more than supporting players\", and felt the middle act was sluggish. CNN's Tom Charity questioned the idea of a film based on a toy, and felt it would \"buzz its youthful demographic [...] but leave the rest of us wondering if Hollywood could possibly aim lower\".\n\n\"Transformers\" fans were initially divided over the film due to the radical redesigns of many characters, although the casting of Peter Cullen was warmly received. \"Transformers\" comic book writer Simon Furman and \"Beast Wars\" script consultant Benson Yee both considered the film to be spectacular fun, although Furman also argued that there were too many human storylines. Yee felt that being the first in a series, the film had to establish much of the fictional universe and therefore did not have time to focus on the Decepticons. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nThe film created a greater awareness of the franchise and drew in many new fans. \"Transformers\" box office success led to the active development of films based on \"Voltron\" and \"Robotech\", as well as a \"Knight Rider\" remake. When filming the sequel, Bay was told by soldiers the film helped their children understand what their work was like, and that many had christened their Buffalos – the vehicle used for Bonecrusher – after various Transformer characters.\n\nAfter the film's 2009 sequel was titled \"\", screenwriter Orci was asked if this film would be retitled, just as \"Star Wars\" was titled \"\" when re-released. He doubted the possibility, but said if it was retitled, he would call it \"Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye\".\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" named Bumblebee as their fourth favorite computer generated character, while \"The Times\" listed Optimus Prime's depiction as the thirtieth best film robot, citing his coolness and dangerousness.\n\nThe second film, \"Revenge of the Fallen\" was released June 24, 2009. The third film, \"Dark of the Moon\" was released June 29, 2011. The fourth film, \"Age of Extinction\" was released June 27, 2014, and the fifth film titled \"The Last Knight\" was released on June 21, 2017. \"Revenge of the Fallen\", \"Dark of the Moon\" and \"Age of Extinction\" were financial successes, while \"The Last Knight\" tanked at the box office. All of the sequels have received mostly negative reviews.\n\nA soft reboot titled \"Bumblebee\" was released on December 21, 2018 to universal critical acclaim. It is currently the highest-rated film in the \"Transformers\" series.\n\n"}

The title is taken from Psalm 137:5—\"If I forget thee, O Jerusalem\"—which consists of the writer lamenting over the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonian army.

Henniker-Heaton wrote: \"I do not know of any short story that has moved me more than Arthur C. Clarke's 'If I Forget Thee, Oh Earth'.\"\n\n\"If I Forget Thee, Oh Earth\" is the story of Marvin, a child who lives in a lunar colony. One day, his father (who is also the head scientist) drives him across the surface to see a glimpse of Earth, glowing with lethal radiation. The father tells Marvin that Earth was destroyed in a nuclear war. The colony is the last vestige of mankind, but without a goal to strive for, the colony (and mankind) will die. The ultimate goal of the colony will be to one day reclaim Earth, for mankind had developed to a point where the best of it could put its seed far enough away from where it had evolved, and away from the reach of development's harm, so that the cradle of humanity could be restored. It took individual effort to attain the colony when it almost failed, and individual effort to maintain the colony when it barely survived, and provided confidence that in the distant future the colony would restore mankind's cradle.\n"}

{"id": "2236487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236487", "title": "Warrior on the Edge of Time", "text": "Warrior on the Edge of Time\n\nWarrior on the Edge of Time is Hawkwind's fifth studio album. It reached number 13 on the U.K. album charts and was their third and last album to make the U.S. \"Billboard\" chart, where it peaked at number 150. Many of the lyrics are by Michael Moorcock, and the album is loosely based on the concept of Moorcock's novel \"The Eternal Champion\". Reviews have been mixed, with \"Melody Maker\" panning the album and particularly criticizing the vocal work while the All Music Guide has praised the album for features such as the songwriting.\n\nThroughout 1974, Hawkwind heavily toured the UK, Europe and North America with their set being composed predominantly from that year's \"Hall of the Mountain Grill\" album. Unusually for them, no new material had been introduced with the exception of some Michael Moorcock poems based on his Elric fictional character, which appeared on the 1974 live album \"The 1999 Party\". In December through to February, the group embarked upon a series of UK dates known as \"A Dead Singer\" tour after the Moorcock story published in the accompanying tour programme, with support from Dr Feelgood (Wilko Johnson: \"Us and Hawkwind were a great bill. We had just been signed by United Artists, Hawkwind's label. UA wanted to give us a little experience in the larger venues. That was where I first met and made friends with Lemmy, who turned out to be a good pal.\").\n\nAs the band owed one final single to United Artists to conclude their recording contract, during a mid-tour break they entered Olympic Studios on 5 and 6 January where they recorded Brock's \"Kings of Speed\" which featured lyrics written by Moorcock originally intended for inclusion on his \"New Worlds Fair\" album, Lemmy's \"Motorhead\" and House's \"Spiral Galaxy\". The first two were selected for the A and B side respectively, and the single was released on 7 March.\n\nOn resuming their UK tour, Brock expressed disillusionment with the band's popularity commenting that \"it's getting to be like a war\", preferring his life with his wife Sylvie and their two children on their ten-acre Devon farm, trading under an alias in a community which knew nothing of his association with rock music. He revealed the growing disharmony within the band, \"you wouldn't believe some of the scenes that go on backstage. All the fucking rows, people losing their temper.\" He was particularly critical of Turner on both a musical level (\"Some nights I've unplugged my guitar and marched across the stage to sort Nik out. He keeps playing the saxophone when I'm singing and I've told him a thousand times not to do that\") and personal level (\"Nik's really gullible, you know. He knows so many people and they always used to take him for a ride. It's so easy because he's not very sussed out\"). He was also critical of Lemmy listing a catalogue of on-stage problems with him, and he \"lives that [Hells Angels] fantasy. It's what he'd like to be, but he can't\", but he's \"quite a good front man, though\". Of the forthcoming Eternal Champion project, Brock revealed that he wanted Arthur Brown for the title role, and it would be \"a complete fantasy trip on every level... and if we did it, that would be the end [of Hawkwind]\".\n\nThe next contract the group signed was a North American deal with Atlantic Records subsidiary Atco Records. With a scheduled North American tour for April and May, \"Atlantic... needed an album to co-incide with our visit\". For the only time in the 1970s, the group were due to record without having prepared new material in a live environment, which led to concern that \"we're going to be really pushed just to get an album together\". The band entered Rockfield studios in March, King explaining \"we laid all the backing tracks down in about three and a half days. Then, after we had a couple of days off, we went down to Olympic and added bits here and there, dubbed over vocals and mixed it all. That took about three days, and it was finished.\"\n\nThe band \"gave [the songs] their debut on two British gigs at Yeovil and Dunstable [12 and 13 April]\", then headed to North America for a tour at the end of April into May, during which Paul Rudolph replaced Lemmy. The album was released by ATCO on 9 May and licensed to United Artists for a UK release. The group promoted the album with tours in Germany and France in June, the UK in July and August including headlining the Reading Festival and appearing at Watchfield Free Festival.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, Turner, House, Powell and King had contributed to Michael Moorcock & The Deep Fix's \"New Worlds Fair\", which also featured a guest appearance from Brock. In April, Moorcock, House and Turner contributed to the recording of Robert Calvert's \"Lucky Leif and the Longships\", produced by Brian Eno and arranged by Rudolph.\n\n\"Assault and Battery\" lyrics quote from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem \"A Psalm of Life\". The song is a popular live number, being performed occasionally over the years, and has appeared on numerous live albums, sometimes under the title \"Lives of Great Men\". It was included as part of the live show for \"The Chronicle of the Black Sword\" concept, appearing on the album \"Live Chronicles\".\n\n\"The Golden Void\" segues from \"Assault and Battery\", and the two songs are often performed live as a pair as on the albums \"Palace Springs\" (1991) and \"Canterbury Fayre 2001\". The song is a popular live number, being performed occasionally over the years, and has appeared on numerous live albums, sometimes under the title \"Void of Golden Light\", as on 1994's \"The Business Trip\".\n\n\"The Wizard Blew His Horn\", \"Standing at the Edge\" and \"Warriors\" are Michael Moorcock poems based on his Eternal Champion literary figure. The poems are recited to atmospheric soundscapes provided by Simon House, and the percussionists Simon King and Alan Powell. The band had been performing them on stage during 1974, versions appearing on \"The 1999 Party\" live album.\n\n\"Opa-Loka\" is an instrumental that features a motorik rhythm and is strongly influenced by the music of Neu!, the title possibly being a reference to Opa-locka, Florida. It was performed live, but when Robert Calvert joined the band at the beginning of 1976, he would recite the poem \"Vikings on Mars\" over the top of it, the song evolving into \"Uncle Sam's on Mars\" on the 1979 album \"PXR5\".\n\n\"The Demented Man\" is a Brock number played on acoustic guitar. (Also listed as \"The Demented King\".)\n\nThe lyrics of \"Magnu\" are based upon Percy Shelley's poem \"Hymn of Apollo\". The song is a popular live number, being performed occasionally over the years, versions on the albums \"\" (1982), \"The Friday Rock Show Sessions\" (1986) and \"Canterbury Fayre 2001\". The first six lines of Magnu are nearly word for word identical to a magical chant that appears in an old Slavic folk-tale, \"The History Of Prince Slugobyl; Or, The Invisible Knight\", used to summon the magical horse, Magu (sic), first published in English translation in 1896 in \"Fairy tales of the Slav peasants and herdsmen.\"\n\n\"Spiral Galaxy 28948\" is a Simon House instrumental, the title being his date of birth (28 September 1948). It was performed live in 1975 after the release of the album, and again during 2001 when House had temporarily rejoined the band, a version appearing on the album \"Canterbury Fayre 2001\".\n\nThe original album sleeve unfolds into a large shield-shape, revealing that the silhouetted Warrior is standing at the edge of an apparently bottomless chasm. The landscape on the other side of the chasm is a mirror image, with \"another\" setting sun, a closer inspection of this entire image reveals a helmeted face. The reverse of the cover depicts a bronze shield bearing the 8-rayed emblem of Chaos, as described in Moorcock's books.\n\nAllan Jones in \"Melody Maker\" (10 May 1975) was critical in his review of the album despite it being \"probably Hawkwind's most professional record\" due to the advance in their \"technical proficiency\", specifically the contributions of Simon House. The compositions are in the \"standard Hawkwind traditions of sweeping synthesiser passages contrasting ethereal space with the violence of monotonous bass and rhythm guitar\", and of the poems he says \"If Moorcock feels qualified to describe any of these pieces as poetry, then that's his problem\" and that they are delivered \"with all the emotion of Davros being exterminated by renegade Daleks\".\n\nGeoff Barton in \"Sounds\" assessed it as \"includ[ing] most of their traditional characteristics (leaden guitar, ritualistic chanting, wailing moogs, SF lyrics) but in a much more mature and varied setting\", and that \"Simon House's influence is strongly felt\" making it \"rather fuller, more interesting than usual\".\n\nMichael Moorcock: \"\"Warrior On The Edge Of Time\" was a concept of mine. What Dave tends to do is he says 'Do us a concept' or 'I've got this rough concept, can you work it out?' I do it, then Dave has a different idea and the whole thing shifts away, so that's the way it works. It's a perfectly good way of working – it tends to give Dave a bit of a start or whatever. I was doing a lot of my 'Eternal Champion' stuff on stage, so it seemed automatic to do that because there were so many numbers I could fit into that. I was only in the studio about an hour to do the stuff I did, and it was one of those weird things I didn't get the session fee either.\"\n\nLemmy: \"The album was a fuck-up from start to finish. That 'Opa-Loka' was a lot of fucking rubbish. I wasn't even on that. That was the drummer's thing, that track... We were kind of complacent anyway. If you have a hit album, you're complacent, and if you have two you really are in trouble. With them, they had four, 'cos they had \"In Search of Space\" before me... There's great stuff on all them albums. 'The Golden Void' was a beautiful track, but by then I was well out of favour.\"\n\nDave Brock: \"There was some good stuff on that album. I think we peaked then, in 1974/75.\"\n\nSimon King: \"I suppose I’m two-thirds happy with this one. For me that’s not bad as I was only half happy with the last one! Warriors is a different musical thing because it’s Simon House’s first real contribution: on Mountain Grill he was too new to be able to have that much influence, and now, of course we’ve got Alan as a second drummer, which has meant a lot of changes.\"\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2011 interview Nigel Reeve, custodian of Hawkwind's United Artists Records archive at EMI, explained that \"Warrior on the Edge of Time\" had originally been released on a separate contract with United Artists, and its rights were no longer held by EMI, hence it was omitted from EMI's remastering and release of Hawkwind's United Artists catalogue in 1996.\n\nThe album was released in the UK on CD for the first time in 1992 on the Dojo label, mastered from vinyl. A second version was released in 1993 on the Canadian label Griffin Music, mastered from a first-generation copy of the original master. This master was the Atco tape used for the 1975 North American vinyl release and included the single mix of \"Kings of Speed\". The Atco master used by Griffin was originally created at Olympic Studios and didn't have any fades on the tracks. A set of accompanying notes written by Dave Brock in 1975 were used to recreate the original fades when Griffin created their digital master. No EQ was used when the Griffin digital master was created. The transfer was done to match the original vinyl as closely as possible.\n\nIn May 2013, Cherry Red reissued the album, along with a new stereo and 5.1 mix by Steven Wilson, on the Atomhenge label managed by Esoteric Recordings. It was also confirmed that the original master tapes were used.\n\n"}

The character, created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, is voiced by Mae Whitman in the original series and Eva Marie Saint in the sequel series. In addition to this, she was played by Nicola Peltz in the 2010 live action film \"The Last Airbender\".\n\nKatara is a fourteen-year-old waterbender (i.e., she has the ability to telekinetically control water and ice); at the beginning of the story, she is the only waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe, one of two known communities in which waterbending is practiced. She and her older brother, Sokka, discover an Airbender named Aang, the long-lost Avatar, frozen in an iceberg, and accompany him on his quest to defeat the imperialistic Fire Nation and bring peace to the war-torn world. She later earns the title of Master Waterbender from Master Pakku of the Northern Water Tribe at the age of fourteen.\n\nKatara has appeared in other media, such as trading cards, T-shirts, video games and web comics.\n\nAccording to the , Katara's name was originally 'Kya', which was later used for her deceased mother. In \"Tales of Ba Sing Se\", Katara's name was written as 卡 塔 拉. Kǎ (卡) means to check, block, or card; Tǎ (塔) means pagoda; and Lā (拉) means to pull. The character 'Lā' appears in the first season's finale as the name of the Ocean Spirit, while the character 'Kǎ' also appears in Sokka's name.\n\nIn the commentary of the unaired pilot episode, co creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino state that Katara's \"hair loopies\" were intended to hang downward, but were thought too hard to animate and looped backward instead.\n\nKatara is described as \"smart, capable, caring; an anime heroine\", and as \"kind, brave, and passionate.\" In many situations, Katara appears as a mother to the other protagonists: a role attributed to her tribe's losses to raids and the departure of many members to war, which required her (as well as her brother Sokka) to assume responsibilities beyond her age. Katara tends to be kind and generous, but is often stubborn or confined by her morals; becomes angry if doubted, insulted, or betrayed; and carries resentment for years on end. She is commonly a mother figure to Sokka, who sometimes resents her for this but also takes her for granted.\n\nWhen Katara was 8 years old, her mother, Kya, sacrificed her life during a Fire Nation raid in order to protect Katara; whereafter her daughter assumed an adult's role in later life. Though her interests lay in developing her Waterbending skills, she resigned herself to cooking and cleaning duties while her brother, Sokka, trained to become a warrior. Later, Katara's father and the other warriors journey to the Earth Kingdom to oppose the Fire Nation; leaving Katara, Sokka, and their grandmother to look after the tribe.\n\nThe events of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" begin six years thereafter, when Katara and Sokka find Aang in suspended animation and identify him as the Avatar, a messianic figure. Bent on mastering Waterbending, Katara joins Aang to reach the to find a Waterbending master, with Sokka alongside them. Upon arrival, Master Pakku refuses her apprenticeship, because the customs of the Northern Water Tribe dictate that females cannot learn Waterbending as a martial art; but upon noticing Katara's necklace, which he himself gave to Katara's grandmother, he agrees to teach her. Katara having achieved her own expertise, Pakku deems her sufficient to teach Aang.\n\nKatara then accompanies Aang to the Earth Kingdom for him to learn earthbending. At an Earth Kingdom stronghold, General Fong places Katara's life in danger to induce Aang's Avatar State; but achieves only destruction. After the earthbender Toph Bei Fong joins the group to teach Aang, Katara and Toph initially quarrel; but thereafter become friends. In the Earth Kingdom's capital, Katara encounters antagonist Prince Zuko and his sister Azula; and during the battle, Aang is injured by Azula's lightning, whereupon Katara takes him to safety and eventually heals him.\n\nIn a village burdened by the Fire Nation's pollution, Katara disguises herself as the river spirit 'Painted Lady' in order to help the village. While staying with the semi-reclusive Hama, the protagonists learn she is a Waterbender of the Southern Tribe that was imprisoned by the Fire Nation. Later, she offers to teach Katara a Waterbending technique called \"Bloodbending\", which enables physical control of animals and humans. When Katara refuses to learn this technique, Hama uses it on Aang and Sokka, forcing Katara to use the technique herself on Hama. When Prince Zuko joins the protagonists after the Invasion fails and gains everyone's trust, he fails to do so with Katara until he assists her in finding the man who was responsible for killing her mother. Though deciding not to take her revenge nor forgive, she does come to terms with Zuko and accepts him as her friend.\n\nDuring the four-part series , Katara assists Zuko in preventing Azula from becoming Fire Lord and battles her; eventually defeating her, and heals Zuko. When the war ends, she is seen in Ba Sing Se with the other protagonists and she finally shares a passionate kiss with Aang, starting a romantic relationship with him.\n\nIn the sequel series \"The Legend of Korra\", Katara, now eighty-five, is one of the three surviving members of the original Team Avatar, along with Zuko and Toph. She is a high-ranking member of the White Lotus and took it upon herself to train Korra in waterbending, becoming the latest in a line of masters to serve as a teacher to multiple Avatars. Katara and Aang are also revealed to have had three children: the non-bender Bumi (who later acquired the ability to airbend), the waterbender Kya, and the airbender Tenzin. She plays a minor role in the first season of the series, only giving Korra her blessing to leave for Republic City to train with Tenzin and attempting to unsuccessfully heal her after she lost her waterbending, firebending and earthbending abilities to Amon.\n\nIn the second-season premiere \"Rebel Spirit\", Katara is seen celebrating with her children at the Southern Water Tribe's Glacier Spirits Festival. While together with them, Katara, holding her new grandson Rohan, watches sadly as she notices Kya and Bumi joking at Tenzin's expense. At the end of the episode, Katara implores that Tenzin take his brother and sister with him to the Southern Air Temple, saying that he will enjoy looking back on the time he had to spend with his siblings and that it might be best for the three to visit their father's home together. In \"Harmonic Convergence,\" Katara is seen in her healing hut tending to injured Southern Water Tribe soldiers, and later used healing to keep her granddaughter Jinora's body alive while her soul was trapped in the spirit world. In \"Light in the Dark\", she is seen listening to Avatar Korra addressing the independent Southern Water Tribe and how she decided to have spirits and human coexist by leaving the spirit portals open.\n\nIn the fourth season episode \"Korra Alone\", Katara aids Korra in healing her body after being poisoned by Zaheer at the end of the third season, enabling her to walk again after being wheelchair bound for over six months.\n\nKatara's abilities develop considerably throughout the series. At the outset, she has little control over her waterbending, and often loses control in moments of frustration or anger. Thanks to diligent practice, an instruction scroll, and tutelage under a Master, her skill improves until she is bestowed with the status and title of \"\"Waterbending Yang-style Master\"\". She was chosen by Korra as her instructor in the \"Southern Tribe Yang-style\" martial arts, bending arts and the healing arts.\n\nKatara is highly skilled in Waterbending which utilizes Chinese martial arts techniques of \"internal style\" T'ai chi ch'uan and Jeet Kune Do; Katara is the only surviving Master of \"Southern Tribe Yang-style\" after the 100 year genocide.<ref name=\"avatar2/index.jhtml\"></ref> The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style. Waterbending represents the element of change - a shapeshifter constantly changing forms - and is categorized as the most adaptive or pliable of the \"four bending arts\". Waterbending emphasizes \"softness and breathing\" over \"hard aggression\"; fluid and graceful, acting in concert with the environment; creating opportunities where none exist; this \"flow of energy\" allows their defensive maneuvers to translate into focus on control and counter-offenses, turning their opponents' momentum against them. Despite these advantages, Waterbending is almost entirely dependent on inertia; it is essential for practitioners to not be rigid, but to be fluid and able to adapt to any situation.\n\nKatara has demonstrated to be a formidable opponent to her enemies, able to fight on equal terms with Azula and Long Feng; she eventually outmatched the Fire Nation princess to demonstrate the extent of her skill. Without the aid of a full moon, Katara can use water to cut through objects; summon lashing waves and whips of varying sizes; cover herself with a sheath of water; surf on a length of ice; run and stand on the surface of water; melt and control existing ice; form ice into various shapes; freeze water and objects surrounded by water with little effort; create walls of mist and steam; transform steam into ice; evaporate large amounts of water; or derive a weapon from any moisture including her own perspiration. She can control huge amounts of water at a time, forming huge waves and bubbles of water. On one instance, Katara knocked down the entire Dai Li, Zuko, and Azula while riding atop a giant wave. As with all Waterbenders, Katara's powers increase under the influence of a full moon.\n\nKatara demonstrates the ability to levitate and control water-based liquids, as well as pure water, in the episode \"The Southern Raiders\", wherein Katara bends ink onto a map. She is also seen bending soup (which allows her to cook meals), and bends perfume while battling a smell-dependent monster. In the episode \"The Painted Lady,\" she uses her bending to create a thick fog. Katara also demonstrates the ability to bend sweat and the ability to manipulate mud with Toph, who manipulates the dirt while Katara controls the water.\n\nKatara is one of the few waterbenders born with the sub-ability of healing injuries or wounds, first demonstrated after she is burned by Aang's first attempt at firebending. She strengthens this ability under the tutelage of the Northern Water Tribe's healer Yagoda. She uses it thereafter to relieve sickness; overcome brainwashing; and heal wounds such as burns and bleeding injuries. Nevertheless, she cannot cure all sicknesses, mend brain damage, or heal internal injuries and birth defects. Using special water she obtained from the Northern Water Tribe's Spirit Shrine, she was able to heal a fatal wound Azula inflicted upon Aang, thus reviving him from death. She speculated that she would be able to use that same water to heal the scar on Zuko's face, but was interrupted before she could do so. By the time of \"The Legend of Korra\", Lin Beifong (Toph's metalbender daughter) claims that she is the strongest healer in the world.\n\nKatara has another waterbending technique known as \"bloodbending\". She first used this technique in the eighth episode of . This ability consists in manipulating the water inside a creature's body, leaving the target unable to move or resist in any way. Once she has taken control, she can make it move in any manner she desires. She is only able to bloodbend during a full moon, when her waterbending power is at its peak. Katara was forced to learn bloodbending by Hama, an elderly Water Tribe woman who originally developed the technique and who wanted Katara to learn it for it to be passed on to others. However, Katara abhors this technique and has only used it twice in times of great stress. In later years, she worked to make the practice a criminal offense.\n\nKatara's character appeared in the \"\" and three THQ video games including and \"\" and \"\".\n\nLike Aang, Katara also appeared in Tokyopop's films comic (sometimes referred to as cine-manga).\n\nIn 2010 film adaptation of the series, \"The Last Airbender\" directed by M. Night Shyamalan, Nicola Peltz portrayed Katara. The film was universally panned by critics and audiences. Many reviewers cited inconsistencies within the plot and between the screenplay and the source material, as well as the acting, writing and casting and has been considered to be one of the worst adaptations ever made.\n\n"}

The formal decision to form the Brigade was made by the Folketing on November 25, 1993 and this date is often regarded as the birth of the Brigade. The Brigade was then formed, as a military unit, on July 1, 1994.\n\nThe background for its existence was changes in NATO's structure, in the European security situation and as a direct response to Denmark’s involvement in UNPROFOR.\n\nThe purpose and design of the Brigade was to, in part or as a whole, to rapidly deploy in peacemaking, peacekeeping, humanity or similar missions under NATO, UN, OSCE or national supervision. In its lifespan the Brigade was never deployed as a whole but all subordinated units was deployed more than once.\n\nOn January 1, 1996 the Brigade was also assigned to the NATO Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps and fell under the organisational control of 1 (UK) Armoured Division when required. The \"DIB\" headquarters was located at Vordingborg barracks and made regularly exercises with \"1 (UK) Armoured Division\".\n\nThe DIB consisted of 4,800 personal, including a combat group of around 2,500 personnel in three battalions; a battalion equipped with Leopard 2A5 DK main battle tanks and an artillery unit with 18 self-propelled 155mm M-109 A3 howitzer, as well as logistics.\n\nIn all the Brigade has 51 Leopard 2A5 DK (Original 50 Leopard 1A5), 180 M113 (\"M113A1 with Add-On-Armour\", \"M113A2 DK I\" (PNMK M/92) and \"M113 G3 DK\") and Mowag Piranha armored personnel carrier in various configurations and another ca. 1200 vehicles.\n\n80% of the brigade consisted of volunteers who agreed to participate in up to two possible six-month international deployments during their four-year reserve commitment (originally this was only three years).\n\nIn the Danish Defence agreement 2005–2009, the brigade was to be dissolved and the Brigade thereby official ceased to exist on February 15, 2005.

The team currently plays in the Serie A, the top-flight football league in the country.\n\nEl Nacional has thirteen national championships (one less than Emelec and two less than Barcelona). The club has participated in more Copa Libertadores than any other club in Ecuador with 22 appearances. Their best performance in the continental tournament was as a semi-finalist in 1985.\n\nEl Nacional was founded on 1 June 1964, and was administered by the Ecuadorian Military since the foundation until 2013, when the club celebrates his first ever democratic elections. The club has maintained a tradition of only playing Ecuadorian footballers, which has given them the nickname of \"Puros Criollos\" (\"Pure Natives\"). Rival clubs included crosstown clubs LDU Quito, Deportivo Quito, Universidad Católica and the Guayaquileans Barcelona and Emelec. Their home stadium is Estadio Olímpico Atahualpa.\n\nOther sports the organization participates in are gymnastics, table tennis, Ecuavolley, chess, and shooting.\n\nIn the 1970s, El Nacional was able to achieve what no Ecuadorian team had done in the history of the league. In 1976, 1977, 1978 they were unbeatable champions. Fabián Paz y Miño stepped up as the leading goal scorer in the league in 1977 to help El Nacional during those three years of glory. In 1982, 1983, 1984 El Nacional repeated this feat to become double three-time championship winners. Their title count became eight. This was gained by help from two legendary players Jose Villafuerte and Ermen Benitez. In 1985 they accomplished their most important feat in international competition reaching semi-finals in the Copa Libertadores. One year later they added to their titles by being crowned for the ninth time in their history.\n\nEl Nacional produced some of the greatest players in Ecuador and won two more championships in 1992 and 1996 with the help of Cléber Chalá, Agustín Delgado, and Oswaldo Ibarra. They also disputed the semi-finals of the Copa Conmebol 1992 and the 1994 edition.\n\nThe current success of the team has added two more championships in 2005 and 2006 bringing their total to 13 titles. They have equaled rivals Barcelona to become one of the best teams in Ecuador. El Nacional has brought up talented players such as Antonio Valencia, Segundo Alejandro Castillo, Christian Benítez and Felix Borja. There have been plans to build a new stadium but no official decision has been taken yet. Former coach Juan Carlos Burbano resigned after an unsuccessful first stage in the league. Julio Asad was appointed head coach on 16 July 2009.\n\nEl Nacional play their home matches in the Estadio Olímpico Atahualpa. Plans have been enabled to build a new stadium, however no official decision has been taken. The management even showed the model of what the 42,000 seat stadium would look like.\n\nOn 13 May 1998, a group of friends met and decided to form a highly dedicated fanbase called La Marea Roja (English: \"The Red Tide\"). Over the years, they aimed to integrate more people, and becoming a better organized to be the largest fan group of El Nacional. It is made up of over 250 members, with members owning proper identification cards. La Marea Roja stands at the south part of the stadium for 90 minutes every game, which attracts adults, women and large numbers of children.\n\n\nThe following managers won at least one trophy while in charge of El Nacional:\n\n"}

Its supposed existence became something of a myth in 19th-century Russia.\nYakov Sannikov and Matvei Gedenschtrom claimed to have seen the land mass during their 1809–1810 cartographic expedition to the New Siberian Islands. Sannikov was the first one to report the sighting of a \"new land\" north of Kotelny Island in 1811 (hence the name \"Sannikov Land\").\n\nIn 1886, a Baltic German explorer in Russian service, Baron Eduard von Toll, reported observing the elusive land during an expedition to the New Siberian Islands. In August 1901, during the Russian Polar Expedition, also led by Toll, the Russian Arctic ship \"Zarya\" headed across the Laptev Sea, searching for the legendary Sannikov Land. It was soon blocked by floating pack ice in the New Siberian Islands. Attempts to reach Sannikov Land, deemed to be beyond the De Long Islands, continued in 1902 while the \"Zarya\" was trapped in fast ice. In November, Toll and three companions left the \"Zarya\" and travelled south on loose ice floes, away from Bennett Island, and vanished forever.\n\nA search by the Soviet icebreaker \"Sadko\" was announced in 1936 and carried out in 1937 but found no trace of the land.\n\nSome historians and geographers, judging from other successes of Sannikov and the presence of shallow sand shoals at Sannikov Land's mapped location, postulate that it indeed once existed, but was destroyed by coastal erosion and became a submerged sand shoal, like many other islands formed either of fossilized ice or of permafrost. This process of Arctic islands disappearing continues within the New Siberian Islands archipelago. Other historians and geographers hypothesize that Sannikov Land might have been a miraged image of Bennett Island. Such mirages occur frequently in the Arctic region.\n\nRussian geologist and science fiction writer Vladimir Obruchev fictionalized this phantom island in his novel \"Sannikov Land\" (1926). In the story, the island provided the last escape for a tribe of Onkilon (this was one of the older names for Yuit), pushed away from the mainland by other Siberian peoples. The (fictional) Onkilon were thought to be extinct, and were discovered by a small expedition looking for the island and eventually stranded at it.\n\nObruchev provided a reasonable justification of the possibility of the described things and events. The island turned out to be a crater of a volcano and a warm place, heated by the volcano. It also hosted a tribe of Neanderthals (called \"Vampoo\") and mammoths. In the end of the story the volcano erupts and destroys the land.\n\nIn 1973, a science fiction film based on the book, and also called \"Sannikov Land\", was released in the Soviet Union.\n\nSannikov Land is used as a location in British horror podcast The Magnus Archives in Episode 101, \"Another Twist\". It is described as a place that does not exist and has never existed, in association with an entity known as \"The Spiral,\" which personifies madness, unreality, and deceit.\n\n\n"}

She also had a 2-episode role as Cassie Newton in the seventh season of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\".\n\nSkye was born in her grandmother's home in Northridge, California. Her parents being amateur gemologists, named her after azurite, a semi-precious mineral. Azure is a color often associated with the sky; thus the middle name \"Dawn\" and the stage name \"Azura Skye\". Being from a show business family, she started her career as a stage actress at the age of three and toured Europe with the Santa Monica Playhouse theatre group at the age of eleven. She received her education at the Brentwood School.\n\nHer grandfather, Brad Johnson, who died before her birth, was an actor known for his role as deputy sheriff Lofty Craig in the Western series, \"Annie Oakley\" (1954–1957), as well as a real estate developer in Los Angeles.\n\nSkye made her first television appearance on the show \"Total Security\" in 1997. Then she played a couple of smaller parts on \"Touched by an Angel\" and \"Chicago Hope\", and made appearances in a number of television movies before she was cast for the role as \"Jane\" in \"Zoe, Duncan, Jack and Jane\" in 1999. \"Zoe...\", as the show was renamed for the second season, was a short-lived (two seasons) sitcom about four teenagers – Skye's character being one of them. In 2000, the same year that \"Zoe...\" ended, Skye's first major movie production premiered. In \"28 Days\", she starred alongside Sandra Bullock and Viggo Mortensen.\n\nTwo years later, in 2002, Skye appeared in two episodes of the television series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". In the episode \"Help\" she plays Cassie Newton, a teen girl at Sunnydale High who possesses the power of precognition and who foresees her own death, and whom Buffy tries to help. In the episode \"Conversations with Dead People\", she plays an incarnation of the First Evil, impersonating a ghost of Cassie, who attempts to persuade Willow to commit suicide by pretending to bring a message from her dead girlfriend Tara.\n\nAlso in 2002, she appeared in \"Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister\" alongside Matthew Goode and Stockard Channing.\n\nDuring this time she also appeared in other projects, doing smaller parts.

{"id": "2236556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236556", "title": "Small form factor", "text": "Small form factor\n\nSmall Form Factor (SFF or SFX) refers to various computer form factors designed to minimize the volume and footprint of a desktop computer compared to the standard ATX form factor. For comparison purposes, the size of an SFF case is usually measured in litres. SFFs are available in a variety of sizes and shapes, including shoeboxes, cubes, and book-sized PCs. Their smaller and often lighter construction has made them popular as home theater PCs and as gaming computers for attending LAN parties. Manufacturers also emphasize the aesthetic and ergonomic design of SFFs since users are more likely to place them on top of a desk or carry them around. Advancements in component technology together with reductions in size means a powerful computer is no longer restricted to the huge towers of old.\n\nSmall form factors do not include computing devices that have traditionally been small, such as embedded or mobile systems. However, \"small form factor\" lacks a normative definition and is consequently open to interpretation and misuse. Manufacturers often provide definitions that serve the interests of their products. According to marketing strategy, one manufacturer may decide to mark their product as \"small form factor\" while other manufacturers are using different marketing name (such as \"Minitower\", \"Microtower\" or \"Desktop\") for personal computers of similar or even smaller footprint.\n\nThe acronym SFF originally stood for \"Shuttle Form Factor,\" describing shoebox-sized personal computers with two expansion slots. The meaning of SFF evolved to include other, similar PC designs from brands such as AOpen and First International Computer, with the word \"Small\" replacing the word \"Shuttle\".\n\nSFF originally referred to systems smaller than the Micro-ATX. The term SFF is used in contrast with terms for larger systems such as \"mini-towers\" and \"desktops.\"\n\nSmall form factor computers are generally designed to support the same features as modern desktop computers, but in a smaller space. Most accept standard x86 microprocessors, standard DIMM memory modules, standard 8.9 cm (3.5\") hard disks, and standard 13.3 cm (5.25\") optical drives.\n\nHowever, the small size of SFF cases may limit expansion options; many commercial offerings provide only one 8.9 cm (3.5\") drive bay and one or two 13.3 cm (5.25\") external bays. Standard CPU heatsinks do not always fit inside an SFF computer, so some manufacturers provide custom cooling systems. Though limited to one or two expansion cards, a few have the space for -length cards such as the GeForce GTX-295. Most SFF computers use highly integrated motherboards containing many on-board peripherals, reducing the need for expansion cards.\n\nEven if labeled \"SFF,\" cube-style cases that support full-sized (PS2 form factor) power supplies actually have a microATX form factor. True SFF systems use SFX, TFX or smaller power supplies, and some require a laptop-style external \"power brick.\"\n\nSome SFF computers even include compact components designed for mobile computers, such as notebook optical drives, notebook memory modules, notebook processors, and external AC adapters, rather than the internal power supply units found in full-size desktop computers.\n\nCrowdfunding and availability of rapid prototyping tools has enabled the production of several mini-ITX cases focusing on efficiently organizing commercial computer components into small volumes including the Ghost S1, DAN A4-SFX, and upcoming Thor Zone MJOLNIR. Communities of enthusiasts and reviewers have developed around SFF assembly, maintenance, and performance. 3D printing and Laser cutting have enabled customization and one off production by both manufacturers like Lazer3D and individual users with access to the relevant equipment.\n\nThe many different types of SFFs are categorized loosely by their shape and size. The types below are available .\n\nMany SFF computers have a cubic shape. Smaller models are typically sold as \"barebones\" units, including a case, motherboard, and power supply designed to fit together. The motherboard lies flat against the base of the case. Upgrade options may be limited by the non-standard motherboards, cramped interior space, and power and airflow concerns. The Power Mac G4 Cube, released in 2000, and the Shuttle XPC are good examples of this design. MSI and Asus produce similar designs.The Xi3 Modular Computer is an example of a cube computer with a little more upgrade possibilities.\n\nShuttle has adapted several of its XPC models to alternately accept mini-ITX motherboards. The base of the XPC is provided with mounting points which accommodate both \"Shuttle form factor\" (ShFF) and mini-ITX motherboards. In order to accommodate mini-ITX motherboards, two of the ShFF mounting points are simply relocated (the other two mini-ITX mounting points are in common with ShFF mounting points). A \"standard\" ShFF motherboard is 20.6 cm (8 1/8″) wide by 27.3 cm (10 3/4″) deep, with the I/O shield and the two PCI slots being located in common with mini-ITX motherboards. Most ShFF systems utilize Shuttle's proprietary heat pipe (liquid) cooling system, \"Integrated Cooling Engine\" (ICE), for the processor, although several also feature heat pipe cooling for the voltage regulator or the chip set (Northbridge). When the ShFF motherboard is replaced with a mini-ITX motherboard, an Intel or compatible fan must replace the ICE unit. The ShFF's ICE computer fan is so designed that it may be repurposed as a case fan when the case has been converted to mini-ITX use: the special fan retaining screws are used in place of the ICE unit's thumb screws.\n\nAOpen Inc. produced a stackable S120 case, allowing the user to stack up to four components vertically or horizontally. These layers can be for add-on cards, optical drives, and hard drives, using either internal power supplies or external AC adapter power sources. After the S120, AOpen made more small form factor cases for systems with Micro ATX and Mini-ITX.\n\nUntil 2005, SFF cases were usually sold as barebones units (case, power supply, and motherboard) to system integraters and home-based builders. In 2005, Apple Inc. introduced its Mac Mini (volume of 1.4 L, excluding external power brick). Later in the same year, the first AOpen mini PC MP915 (renamed to XC mini in 2007 since \"mini PC\" could not be registered as a trademark), was announced. The size of the XC mini series PC—16.5(W) × 5.0(H) × 16.5(D) cm—makes it one of the smallest desktop PC systems (1.3L volume). It was criticized for looking like the Apple Mac Mini but Apple has not taken action on this subject. In February 2007, AOpen redesigned the case of the mini PC MP945 series.\n\nSince 2006, major OEM PC brands such as HP and Dell have begun to sell fully assembled SFF systems. These are often described as \"bookshelf\" units since they resemble a miniature tower case small enough to fit on a bookshelf. The HP Slimline series and Dell C521 (volume 1.65 L) are good examples of this trend. The Maxdata Favorite 300XS is another mini computer. The HP Slimline uses a non-standard motherboard that is very similar in size to Mini-ITX.\n\nIn addition to its industrial use, the extremely small Mini-ITX motherboard form factor has also been incorporated into SFF computers. These are often extremely compact, incorporating low-power components such as the VIA C3 processors. The Travla C134 is an example of this design. At 17.8 x 25.4 x 5.1 cm (7 × 10 × 2\") the Travla C134 is somewhat larger than the Mac mini which is 16.5 x 16.5 x 5.1 cm (6.5 × 6.5 × 2\") and barely bigger than a standard 13.3 cm (5.25\") optical drive.\n\nBeginning in 2007, several other companies have released other very small computers that besides a small size, focus on a low price, and extremely high power efficiency (typically 10 W or below in use). These include the Zonbu, fit-PC, Linutop, and A9home. With the release of Intel ATOM CPU, AOpen also made Nettop systems: the uBox series with model LE200 and LE210. The uBox series equips a dual core Intel Atom 270/330 processor, single channel DDR-II 533/667 memory, Intel 945GC+ICH7 chipset, three SATA connectors and 5.1 channel high definition audio output.\n\nEssentially a bookshelf-style case lying on its side, a miniature HTPC replicates the look of other smaller-than-rack-sized home theatre components such as a DVR or mini audio receiver. The front panel interface is emphasized, with the optical disc drive rotated relative to the case in order to maintain horizontal mounting, and more motherboard port connectors (such as for USB) are routed to the front panel, they normally are as powerful as PC desktops.\n\nA computer-on-module (COM) is a complete computer built on a single circuit board. They are often used as embedded systems due to their small physical size and low power consumption. Gumstix is one manufacturer of COMs.\n\nEach model of Dell's Optiplex line of computers typically includes an Ultra-Small Form Factor (USFF) chassis option. In the Core 2 era, these machines used 8.9 cm (3.5\") desktop hard drives and external power supplies, like the Optiplex 745 and 755. More recent units use 6.4 cm (2.5\") laptop hard drives and have integrated power supplies, like the Optiplex 990 USFF. The compact size comes at the cost of restricted expandability, as USFF models have no PCI or PCIe slots and may have limited CPU and memory options.\n\nStarting from Series 5, USFF was replaced with Micro variants, an even smaller size option that uses external power supplies and does not have optical drives.\n\nUnderstood as comprising nano-ITX (12 × 12 cm) and pico-ITX (10 × 7.2 cm) boards, the format was championed by Via Technologies. Intel now describes its own Next Unit of Computing (NUC) products (10.2 x 10.2 cm or 4 × 4\") as UCFF.\n\n"}

Iroh is a very powerful firebender, and a retired general of the Fire Nation. He is the elder brother of Firelord Ozai, the ruler of the Fire Nation and leader of its campaign to conquer the other three nations. During the narrative of the series, he accompanies his exiled nephew Zuko on his quest to capture the series's protagonist Aang to restore the young prince's honor and birthright; Iroh acts as a mentor who seeks to help his nephew become a better person than his father.\n\nIn the episode \"The Tales of Ba Sing Se\", Iroh's name was written as 艾洛 (aì lùo). The episode was dedicated \"In Honor of Mako\", who had died some months before the episode aired.\n\nPrior to the events in \"The Last Airbender\", Iroh was the firstborn son of , but Azulon was succeeded by his second son, Ozai, following Iroh's retreat from public affairs, after his son Lu Ten died in the siege of the Earth Kingdom's capital Ba Sing Se, which had held against numerous successive Fire Nation efforts at capture during the duration of the Hundred Years War. Iroh had a vision early in life that he would be the one to capture the city, but the death of his only son broke his desire to continue in the effort; having always been driven more by a sense of duty than personal ambition, Iroh abandoned the siege.\n\nOzai, the far more opportunistic and ambitious of the brothers, attempted to convince their father that, owing to Iroh's shameful defeat, decreased standing in the nation, and lack of heirs, Ozai ought to be made heir to the leadership of the Fire Nation. However, Azulon was incensed at this lack of respect for Iroh's position and his loss and ordered Ozai to kill his own son, Prince Zuko, as an act of atonement. Instead, Ozai conspired with his wife, Princess Ursa, to assassinate Azulon and seize the leadership while Iroh was in mourning and disinterested in state affairs; with the life of her son on the line, Ursa did not feel she could refuse and assisted Ozai in a successful poisoning of Azulon. Ozai ascended to the position of Fire Lord: although the events immediately following Azulon's secret murder are never depicted in flashbacks, it seems that his death was explained as the result of natural causes and that the still-mourning Iroh had no interest in challenging his brother for control of the nation, instead acquiescing to Ozai's investiture as Fire Lord and entering a permanent semi-retirement from state affairs.\n\nIroh was believed to have killed off the last of the world's dragons, earning him the title \"Dragon of the West\"; but in actuality he was secretly the pupil of the last two dragons, and thus learned from them to drive his firebending powers from vitality rather than from rage as most of his contemporary firebenders did; Iroh lied about killing the last of the dragons to bring an end to the Fire Nation tradition of dragon hunts. He was a high-ranking member of the international secret society known as the Order of the White Lotus.\n\nWhen the story begins in , Iroh is accompanying the banished Prince Zuko in his quest to capture the Avatar, a superhuman whose task to maintain world order makes him a threat to the Fire Nation's campaign of conquest. Having learnt of the plan of Zhao, a Fire National admiral, to kill the moon spirit to take away the Water Tribes' power of waterbending, disrupting the natural order, Iroh attacks Zhao and is named a traitor.\n\nDuring , he and his nephew are now fugitives from the Fire Nation. After being gravely wounded by his niece Azula and cared for by his nephew, Iroh teaches Zuko a Waterbending-inspired technique of redirecting lightning, which can be generated by an advanced form of firebending which Zuko, with his unfocused mind, has been unable to master, but which his sister and competitor to the throne, easily commands, being a firebending prodigy. Iroh eventually takes refuge in Ba Sing Se, where he and Zuko operate a tea-house. Iroh is dismayed when Azula convinces her brother to betray them and is arrested while covering Aang and his friends' escape from the conquered city.\n\nIn , held in a Fire Nation prison, Iroh fakes despair while preparing himself for the solar eclipse, during which Firebending does not work. Once the eclipse begins, Iroh escapes his cell, being a formidable opponent even without the use of firebending. In the series finale, Iroh has called the White Lotus to free Ba Sing Se from the Fire Nation—fulfilling his childhood vision, but as a liberator, not a conqueror. After the war ends, Iroh is offered the Firelord’s throne, but he asks Zuko to be crowned instead. Soon after Zuko's coronation as Firelord, Iroh returns to Ba Sing Se to operate his tea shop; the final scenes of the series take place in that shop.\n\nIn the comic book sequel \"\", Iroh offers Aang and Zuko advice on dealing with the Harmony Restoration Movement, a movement that aims to expel members of the Fire Nation ethnic group from Earth Kingdom territory; he also invents bubble tea. In the comic book \"\", Iroh becomes acting Firelord while Zuko travels to locate his mother Ursa. Bored with his new title, he uses his authority to declare a National Tea Appreciation Day.\n\nIn the sequel series \"The Legend of Korra\", Iroh is revealed to have used a form of astral projection at the time of his death to become a resident of the Spirit World. In the episode \"A New Spiritual Age\", Iroh comes to the aid of Aang's successor as Avatar, Korra, who is trapped unprepared deep in the Spirit World. In the episode \"Darkness Falls\", having known them in life, Iroh encounters Aang's children Tenzin, Kya, and Bumi when they enter the Spirit World and provides them with hints as to the location of the spirit of Tenzin's daughter Jinora. Korra again encounters Iroh in \"The Ultimatum,\" when she enters the Spirit World in search of the anarchist terrorist Zaheer. Korra explains to Iroh that she is confused and doesn't know how to deal with the threat Zaheer poses to both the newly reformed Air Nation and the world. Iroh suggests that Korra seek Zuko's counsel, as Aang once did.\n\nZuko's grandson is named Iroh in honor of his great-granduncle, and is a general of the United Forces, the armed services of the United Republic of Nations, a multi-ethnic nation founded by Aang and Zuko out of territories that were disputed between the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom after the end of the Hundred Years War.\n\nEasygoing, friendly and dryly good-humored, Iroh treats his self-imposed exile like an extended vacation. Something of a hedonist in his old age, he shows more interest in relaxation and amusement than in his nephew's pursuit of the Avatar. Despite his age, Iroh is seen flirting with various women throughout the series and has been addressed as \"handsome\" on multiple occasions. Nevertheless, he is a seasoned and wily strategist, a powerful Firebending master and a loving and sagely mentor to his nephew. In general, Iroh's inherent nature and the course of his life have brought him to a philosophy that embraces peacefulness, harmony, and mutual understanding rather than conflict. However, when he is personally threatened or observes injustice and violence against the innocent, he is capable of becoming a fierce and intimidating adversary. Contrary to the direction in which his nation has moved in the years since his grandfather Sozin set it on a mission of conquest, Iroh would rather see the four nations live in mutual peace; though he has been unwilling to plunge his nation into civil war by asserting his claim to the position of Firelord (a station he does not want), it becomes increasingly clear that he views his nephew as possessing the potential to lead the nation down a better path, and when the time comes, he encourages Zuko to intercede to prevent the investiture of his sister, the callous and unstable Azula, as the next Firelord. In \"Tales of Ba Sing Se\", it is suggested that some of his perpetual optimism and generosity are a form of post-traumatic growth resulting from the death of his son Lu Ten. This can be seen in his song \"Leaves from the Vine\", which he sings on the anniversary of Lu Ten's birthday.\n\nIroh is particularly fond of food, good tea\nthe strategy game \"Pai Sho\", and pleasant music. He later displays skill at playing the pipa and other musical instruments. Most likely because of his love of tea, he is an amateur botanist, though his misinterpretation of some plant characteristics leads him to accidentally poison himself. His character is best shown in his relationship with his nephew, Zuko, upon whom he imposes introspection.\n\nIroh is a retired general with a lifetime of combat experience and a reputation of honor, loyalty and integrity. Iroh is highly skilled in Firebending—the \"Avatar\" show creators based the forms of this fictional form of combat upon the real-life Chinese martial arts techniques of Changquan, Shaolinquan, Lóng Xíng Mó Qiáo and Xing Yi Quan.<ref name=\"avatar2/index.jhtml\"></ref> Iroh also taught Zuko how to redirect lightning, a technique he discovered by studying waterbending.\n\nIroh was a well-received character in the series. He was seen as Zuko's foil with him being the elderly, mellow and wise individual and Zuko being the young abrasive naïve prince. Iroh and Zuko's relationship was praised for its authenticity and humor. Iroh is described as a \"mystical buddha\" who served as Zuko's moral compass. In some circles, Iroh was viewed as an inspirational character, with his quotes on the series described as encouraging. While many of the series' other major characters were maturing throughout the course of the series, Iroh was already a \"changed man\" who already suffered tremendous loss and \"matured\" through that loss. Iroh's vignette in the episode \"The Tales of Ba Sing Se\", was described as an \"emotional gut-punch\" by reviewer Rebecca Pahle. Reviewer Hayden Childs characterized Iroh's vignette as \"a lovely piece of storytelling\" and praised Mako's \"amazing performance\" in the character's short story. Reviewer Matt London admitted to being \"reduced to tears\" while watching Iroh's vignette. He praised Mako's performance in voicing the character, while characterizing Ozai stealing Iroh's birthright as the next Fire Lord as \"almost Shakespearean\". Reviewer Keval Shah termed the scene where Iroh sacrifices himself to allow Aang and Katara to escape Azula in the season two finale, \"The Crossroads of Destiny\", as \"emotional\". Shah praised the \"superb development\" of the character. Iroh's appearances in the \"Legend of Korra\" series was also well received. Iroh's introduction into the series was observed as a plot device to help Korra, who at that point was a somewhat unpopular character among fans and critics alike, become a more likeable protagonist.\n\nShaun Toub plays Iroh in the feature film \"The Last Airbender\". This version of the character is not as comedic as his cartoon counterpart, but retains his role as mentor to Zuko. Unlike other Firebenders in the movie, who require a source of fire to bend, Iroh can generate fire merely by using his chi.\n\nHe also appears in the video game \"\", as a character in both the main story, and in multiplayer mode.\n\n"}

By the twelfth century it was believed that Eadfrith succeeded Eadberht and nothing in the surviving records contradicts this belief. Lindisfarne was among the main religious sites of the kingdom of Northumbria in the early eighth century, the resting place of Saints Aidan and Cuthbert. He is venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Church, and Anglican Communion.\n\nA colophon added to the Lindisfarne Gospels in the tenth century states that Eadfrith was the scribe and artist responsible for the work. The Lindisfarne Gospels were the product of a single scribe and illustrator, working full-time over a period of about two years. For this reason, many historians who accept that the work was authored by Eadfrith in person date it to the period before he became bishop. Not all historians accept that he was the scribe: some argue that he may have commissioned the work rather than creating it in person; some reject the association as an unreliable tradition.\n\nContemporary witnesses to Eadberht's episcopacy portray him as a supporter of the cult of Saint Cuthbert. He commissioned three lives of the Saint, the first by an anonymous writer, written between 699 and 705. This \"Anonymous Life of Saint Cuthbert\" was revised on Eadfrith's orders by Bede, writing around 720, to produce both prose and verse lives.\n\nEadfrith also oversaw the restoration of the hermitage on Farne where Cuthbert had often lived. He is named in Æthelwulf's ninth century poem \"De abbatibus\" as having advised Eanmund, first abbot of a monastery—its name and location are unknown—founded during the reign of King Osred.\n\nWhen Lindisfarne was abandoned in the late ninth century, Eadfrith's remains were among those taken on the community's long wanderings through Northumbria. The relics of Saint Cuthbert, and those of Eadfrith along with them, eventually found a new home at Chester-le-Street, where they remained for a century. In 995 the relics were translated to Durham Cathedral. At Durham Eadfrith, along with his predecessor Eadberht and successor Æthelwold, was commemorated on 4 June.\n\n"}

She made a historic voyage of discovery to the Cape York and Torres Strait areas of northern Australia.\n\nLaunched at Chatham Dockyard on 26 March 1822, \"Rattlesnake\" was 114 feet (34.7 m) long and 32 feet (9.7 m) abeam. She carried twenty 32-pounder carronades, six 18-pounder carronades and two 9-pounder long guns.\n\nFor most of the years 1827 to 1829 \"Rattlesnake\" was cruising off the coasts of Greece, under the command of Captain the Hon. Charles Orlando Bridgeman. During that period her log was kept by Midshipman Talavera Vernon Anson and survives in a collection at the New York Public Library. Both men went on to become admirals. On 31 January 1828, \"Rattlesnake\" was part of a force of five British and two French ships that attacked the Greek island of Gramvousa, used as a base for piracy. While most of the pirate's ships were destroyed by the Anglo-French force, the British frigate ran aground after a collision with and sunk. \n\nSometime between 14 and 16 May 1830, \"Rattlesnake\" was driven ashore and damaged at Algiers in Ottoman Algeria. She was repaired and returned to service.\n\nWilliam Hobson was appointed captain in December 1834. \"Rattlesnake\" served in the Far East squadron, which was commanded by Admiral Sir Thomas Bladen Capel. In 1836, the \"Rattlesnake\" was ordered to Australia, arriving at Hobart on 5 August 1836 and at Sydney 18 days later. On 26 May 1837, the \"Rattlesnake\" sailed to the Bay of Islands, New Zealand, in response to a request for help from James Busby, the British Resident, who felt threatened by fighting between Māori tribes. In 1838 the \"Rattlesnake\" returned to England.\n\n\"Rattlesnake\" took part in the First Anglo-Chinese War (1839–42), known popularly as the First Opium War, taking part in the Capture of Chusan on 5–6 July 1840. During the period 1841–42 she was involved in actions off Canton in the fleet commanded by Sir William Parker in the First Anglo-Chinese War (1839–42), including the Battle of Chinhai on 10 October 1841 and the Yangtze river campaign in June–August 1842.\n\nShe was converted to a survey ship in 1845.\n\nThe captain on the voyage to northern Australia and New Guinea from 1846-1850 was Owen Stanley.

Like other phosphine oxides (such as triphenylphosphine oxide), the molecule has a tetrahedral core and a P=O bond that is highly polarized, with significant negative charge residing on the oxygen atom.\n\nCompounds containing a nitrogen–phosphorus bond typically are degraded by hydrochloric acid to form a protonated amine and phosphate.\n\nIt dissolves alkali metals forming blue solutions which are stable for a few hours. Solvated electrons are present in these blue solutions.\n\nHMPA is a specialty solvent for polymers, gases, and organometallic compounds. It improves the selectivity of lithiation reactions by breaking up the oligomers of lithium bases such as butyllithium. Because HMPA selectively solvates cations, it accelerates otherwise slow S2 reactions by generating more bare anions. The basic nitrogen centers in HMPA coordinate strongly to Li.\n\nHMPA is a ligand in the useful reagents based on molybdenum peroxide complexes, for example, MoO(O)(HMPA)(HO) is used as an oxidant in organic synthesis.\n\nDimethyl sulfoxide can often be used in place of HMPA as a cosolvent.

She was known for her risky double-twisting double-backflip on floor and was one of a handful of women to have successfully competed one. In 2015, she was inducted in the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame.\n\nZamolodchikova began gymnastics at the age of six. In 1999 she participated in her first major senior competition, the World Gymnastics Championships. She won the gold in vault and the bronze in the all-around.\n\nJust days before the 2000 European Championships in Paris, her father died as a result of radiation exposure from the Chernobyl accident. Zamolodchikova led her team to the gold medal and earned individual silvers in the all-around and vault finals and a bronze on the beam.\n\nZamolodchikova was selected as a member of the Russian gymnastics team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Although initially she did not qualify for the all-around or vault finals, she earned spots in both when Elena Produnova withdrew from the all-around due to injury and Svetlana Khorkina decided to give up her spot to Zamolodchikova due to her better chances of medalling. In the team competition, the Russian team was leading after the preliminary rounds, but four Russian gymnasts made mistakes in the finals, costing them the gold. Zamolodchikova was one of the four, slipping off the beam as she took off for a Rulfova and narrowly missing her head.\n\nAfter two apparatuses in the all-around, Zamolodchikova was in first place with her stronger exercises still to go, events on which she went on to win Olympic gold. However, she lost her chance of an all-around medal after a fall on her simplest tumbling pass during her floor exercise rotation. On a night where many gymnasts made uncharacteristic errors, she eventually finished 6th. Had she scored the same in the all-around as she did for her team finals performance, her total would have been enough to win her the gold.\n\nZamolodchikova won gold on both the vault and floor, and became a two-time Olympic champion. During vault finals, Khorkina sat in the stands, cheering loudly for her teammate, to whom she gave her spot. Khorkina was leading in the floor finals until Zamolodchikova performed as both were vying for a second gold.\n\nZamolodchikova won the 2002 World vault title and a European all-around bronze medal in 2004, in addition to numerous other awards.\n\nZamolodchikova, also a lieutenant in the Russian Army, competed in her second Olympic games in 2004. The Russian team won a bronze medal, and Zamolodchikova just missed out on an individual vault medal, placing fourth behind Monica Roşu of Romania, Annia Hatch of the United States, and a fellow Russian, Anna Pavlova.\n\nAt the 2005 World Championships in Melbourne, she placed fourth in both vault and floor finals. In the floor finals, she performed four extremely difficult tumbling passes, landing each one cleanly, but did not successfully compete all of her dance combinations. Her start value was lowered as a result from 10.0 to 9.7, and she scored a 9.162, placing her behind Americans Alicia Sacramone and Nastia Liukin, and Dutch gymnast Suzanne Harmes. Zamolodchikova's low score was unpopular with the crowd, who appeared to think she should have won bronze. She scored an average of 9.318 on her two vaults, finishing behind Cheng Fei of China, Oksana Chusovitina of Uzbekistan, and Alicia Sacramone of the U.S.\n\nAlthough many gymnasts retired as the new code was introduced, Zamolodchikova decided to continue competing. She struggled at her first competition of 2006, the American Cup, particularly on bars where she had a fall. An injury prevented selection for the 2006 European Championships in Volos, Greece.\n\nZamolodchikova helped the Russian team to a bronze medal in the team event, their first at world level since 2001, and qualified to vault finals where she was fourth. In 2006, she also competed her new vault skill, a Yurchenko laid out half-on, half-off which has an A-score of 5.6P in the new code.\n\nAfter the World Championships, she competed in a few World Cup competitions winning a bronze medal on vault in the DTB-Cup in Stuttgart and two silver medals on vault and on floor in the Glasgow Grand Prix. She crowned her year with a bronze on vault at the World Cup Finals in São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nAt the 2007 World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany, her teammate Ekaterina Kramarenko ran up and touched the vaulting table but stopped and received a 0. Zamolodchikova performed a solid vault, but the Russian team had already ended up eighth (last). In the event finals, she fell on her second vault, and finished again in eighth.\n\nZamolodchikova continued training in 2008 in hopes of making the Russian Olympic team for the third time, but a back injury prevented her from a better showing and she failed to do so. Instead, she competed in various World Cup events, narrowly missing a medal on floor at the 2008 World Cup Final in Madrid, where she finished fourth.\n\nZamolodchikova made her last competitive appearance at the 2009 University Games in Belgrade. She began her judging career at the 2009 DTB Cup in Germany.\n\n1999 Worlds: \"Baby Elephant Walk\" - Henry Mancini\n2000 Olympics: \"Who's That Creepin'?/Daddy-O\" - Big Bad Voodoo Daddy / Hipster Daddy-O and the Handgrenades\n2002 Worlds: \"Crazy Benny/Breathe\" - Safri Duo / Moist\n2004 Olympics: \"Egyptian Symphony\" - Mozart\n2005 Worlds: \"Crazy Benny\" by Safri Duo and \"Breathe\" by Prodigy.\n\n\n"}

In 2005, an extrasolar planet was announced to be orbiting the primary star (designated HD 188753 A) in the system. Follow-up measurements by an independent group in 2007 did not confirm the planet's existence.\n\nThe primary star, HD 188753 A, is similar to the Sun with a mass only 6% larger and a stellar classification of G8V. Orbiting this primary at a distance of 12.3 AU is a pair of smaller stars that orbit each other with a period of , a semi-major axis of 0.67 AU, and eccentricity of . The pair have estimated masses of 0.96 and 0.67 solar masses. They orbit the primary with a period of about 25.7 years and an orbital eccentricity of about 0.50. The periastron distance of this orbit is 6.2 AU.\n\nIn 2005 the discovery of a candidate planet orbiting the primary star of the triple star system was announced. This planet, which received the designation HD 188753 Ab, was announced by a Polish astronomer working in the United States, Dr. Maciej Konacki. This would not be the first known planet in a triple star system – for example, the planet 16 Cygni Bb had been discovered earlier, orbiting one of the components of a wide triple system also in the constellation of Cygnus.\n\nSince HD 188753 Ab was believed to be orbiting in a multi-star system, Konacki referred to planets of this type as \"Tatooine planets\" after Luke Skywalker's home world. The detection of this planet has been challenged by Eggenberger et al.\n\nThe candidate planet, a hot Jupiter gas giant slightly more massive than Jupiter, was thought to orbit the star HD 188753 A once every 80 hours or so (3.3 days), at a distance of about 8 million kilometers, a twentieth of the distance between Earth and the Sun. The existence of HD 188753 Ab in a relatively close triple star system challenged the current models of planet formation. The current idea is that giant planets form in the outer reaches of their system (in orbits similar to those of Jupiter and Saturn). Once formed, some of these planets may migrate close to their stars, becoming hot Jupiters. The theoretical difficulty in understanding HD 188753 Ab is that any protoplanetary disk would have ended around 1 astronomical unit from the primary star (due to the presence of the secondary stars). A Jovian planet should not have been able to form so close to the primary, and with no disk material beyond 1 AU, a planet should not have been able to form beyond that distance to migrate inward. One of the possibilities suggested that the planet formed before the secondary stars had reached their current configuration. This suggests that the two secondary stars were once more distant than they are now.\n\nAn attempt to confirm the discovery failed.

He lives in Sydney, Australia.\n\nBy the age of 18, with no formal training in graphic illustration, Cobb was working as an animation \"inbetweener\" artist for Disney Studios in Burbank, California. He progressed to becoming a breakdown artist on the animation feature \"Sleeping Beauty\" (1959). (This was the last Disney film to have cels inked by hand.)\n\nAfter \"Sleeping Beauty\" was completed in 1957, Disney laid off Cobb and he spent the next three years in various jobs — mail carrier, assembler in a door factory, sign painter's assistant — until he was drafted in 1960 into the US Army. For the next two years he delivered classified documents around San Francisco, then, after signing up for an extra year to avoid assignment to the infantry, was sent to Vietnam in 1963 as a draughtsman for the Signal Corps. On his discharge, Cobb began freelancing as an artist. He began to contribute to the \"Los Angeles Free Press\" in 1965.\n\nEdited and published by Art Kunkin, the Los Angeles Free Press was one of the first of the underground newspapers of the 1960s, noted for its radical politics. Cobb's editorial/political cartoons were a celebrated feature of the \"Freep\", and appeared regularly throughout member newspapers of the Underground Press Syndicate. However, although he was regarded as one of the finest political cartoonists of the mid-1960s to early 1970s, Cobb made very little money from the cartoons and was always looking for work elsewhere. His cartoons were featured in the back to the land magazine \"The Mother Earth News.\"\n\nAmong other projects, Cobb designed the cover for Jefferson Airplane's 1967 album, \"After Bathing at Baxter's.\" He also contributed design work for the cult film, \"Dark Star\" (1973) (he drew the original design for the exterior of the \"Dark Star\" spaceship on a Pancake House napkin).\n\nHis cartoons from the 1960s and 1970s are collected in \"RCD-25\" (1967) and \"Mah Fellow Americans\" (1968) (both Sawyer Press), and \"Raw Sewage\" (1971) and \"My Fellow Americans\" (1971) (both Price Stern and Sloan). None of these volumes remains in print.\nIn 1969 Cobb designed the Ecology symbol, later incorporated into the Ecology Flag.\n\nIn 1972, Cobb moved to Sydney, Australia, where his work appeared in alternative magazines such as \"The Digger\". Independent publishers Wild & Woolley published a \"best of\" collection of the earlier cartoon books, \"The Cobb Book\" in 1975. A follow-up volume, \"Cobb Again\", appeared in 1978.\n\nIn 1981, \"Colorvision\", a large-format, full-colour monograph appeared, including much of his design work for the films \"Star Wars\" (1977), \"Alien\" (1979), and \"Conan the Barbarian\" (1982), the first feature for which he received the credit of Production Designer. Cobb has also contributed production design to the films \"The Last Starfighter\" (1984), \"Leviathan\" (1989), \"Total Recall\" (1990), \"True Lies\" (1994), \"The Sixth Day\" (2000), \"Cats & Dogs\" (2001), \"Southland Tales\" (2006), and the Australian feature \"Garbo,\" which he directed. Cobb contributed the initial story for \"Night Skies\", an earlier, darker version of \"E.T..\" Steven Spielberg offered him the opportunity to direct this scarier sequel to \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" until problems arose over special effects that required a major rewrite. While Cobb was in Spain working on \"Conan the Barbarian\", Spielberg supervised the rewrite into the more personal \"E.T.\" and ended up directing it himself. Cobb later received some net profit participation.\n\nIn 1985 Cobb received credit as DeLorean Time Travel Consultant for the film \"Back to the Future\".\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Cobb worked with Rocket Science Games. His designs can be seen most notably in \"\" (1994) and \"The Space Bar\" (1997), in which he designed all the characters.\n\nCobb also co-wrote with his wife, Robin Love, one of the (1985–1987) \"Twilight Zone\" episodes.\n\nAmong the most famous film props signed by Cobb are two of the swords he designed for the 1982 film \"Conan the Barbarian\" (the \"Father's Sword\" and the \"Atlantean Sword\"). Cobb's original drawings of the swords are nowadays used, in cinema merchandising, to mass-produce and sell replicas.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2236682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236682", "title": "Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company", "text": "Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company\n\nThe Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company was established in Chicago, Illinois in 1886 as Charles H. Kerr & Co. by Charles Hope Kerr, originally to promote his Unitarian views. As Kerr's personal interests moved from religion to populism to Marxism and he became interested in the labor movement, the company's publications took a similar turn. During the 1920s Kerr ceded control of the firm to the Proletarian Party of America, which continued the imprint as its official publishing house throughout its four decades of organized existence.\n\nControl moved again during the decade of the 1960s, this time to a circle of Chicago radicals with close affinity to the ideas of the Industrial Workers of the World, who gave the company its current operating moniker. The Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company remains in operation in the second decade of the 21st century, making it the oldest radical book publisher in America.\n\nThe Charles H Kerr Publishing Company continues to publish books, its most recent is \"\" with essays by Penelope Rosemont, Don LaCoss and Michael Lowy.\n\nIn March 1878 a magazine called \"Unity\" had been launched by liberal supporter of the Western Unitarian Conference. The wing of the Unitarian movement represented by the new semi-monthly magazine argued that personal character rather than literal belief in a body of written dogma marked the true \"test and essence of religion.\" These so-called \"Unity Men\" sought wider acceptance among Unitarians for this fundamental idea of the primacy of ethics over belief — a matter of no little controversy among the more conservative church mainstream of the day. A monthly magazine called \"Unitarian\" was established in January 1886 in an attempt to combat the ideas of the \"Unity men\" — who were seen as undermining Christianity in favor of what was characterized as a new \"Ethical Culture.\"\n\nAs the controversy between the dissident \"ethical\" Unitarians and the more conservative \"doctrinal\" church mainstream heated up, the former felt the need for centralized and expeditious publication of books and other materials reflecting their views. The Georgia-born Charles Hope Kerr, a young man born in 1860 who had joined the staff at \"Unity\" magazine in the middle 1880s, obliged by establishing in Chicago in 1886 a publishing house for the \"Unity men\" called \"Charles H. Kerr & Co.\" The Unity men aspired to promote a sound relationship between the emerging evolutionary science of the day and enlightened religious belief — or, as Kerr himself put it, \"a religion that is rational and a rationalism that is religious.\"\n\nThe flagship of the fledgling Kerr & Co. was production of the magazine \"Unity\" itself although a literary journal called \"The University\" was also briefly issued before being subsumed. In addition to books and magazines, the early Charles H. Kerr & Co. produced an array of pamphlets and hymnals for use of a network of \"Unity Clubs\" established around the country. Topics explored included comparative religion, advanced biblical criticism, evolutionary science, and history. In addition to Unitarian-related material, Kerr also issued a number of volumes of poetry and literature. The company maintained this orientation for approximately 7 years before making a turn to more temporal themes of economics, politics, and sociology.\n\nCharles H. Kerr & Co. was first incorporated in 1893, with 1,000 shares of stock authorized with a par value of $10 per share, representing a total market capitalization of $10,000. That same year marked a change in the firm's direction away from religious themes and towards hard politics. The company began the publication of a new monthly magazine, initially titled \"New Occasions\" before a name change was made in July 1897 to \"The New Time.\" The \"semi-socialist\" publication attained a circulation of over 30,000 before being spun off as an independent commercial entity under the direction of editor Frederick Upham Adams. Adams ran into financial difficulties shortly after taking over the magazine, however, and the publication was soon terminated and its subscription list sold to \"The Arena\", a monthly edited by B. O. Flower.\n\nKerr & Co. were greatly influenced by the growth of the People's Party during the 1890s and issued a wide array of titles on such prominent populist themes as monetary reform, railroad regulation, government control of the banking industry, and related matters. Although some of these titles skirted the edge of socialism, it was not until the spring of 1899 that a decisive turn was made to the international socialism espoused by Karl Marx. A close association was quickly established between the Kerr and Co. and a new Chicago socialist weekly newspaper edited by A. M. Simons, \"The Workers Call.\"\n\nIn January 1900 Simons was brought on board Kerr & Co. as a vice president with a view to launching a new magazine. This would be the \"International Socialist Review\" (ISR), a publication which would emerge as among the most important American socialist periodicals during the first two decades of the 20th Century. The publication launched with approximately 800 subscribers and by the end of its first year had more than quadrupled this total. With additional individual issues sold in bulk an increased press run of 10,000 copies was predicted by Kerr early in 1901.\n\nThe firm was funded as a socialist publisher by the sale of stock, with about $500 worth of stock taken by Kerr personally and a small handful of wealthy benefactors and a somewhat larger amount generated through sale of individual shares at $10 each. Stockholders were not paid dividends and were offered no promise of increased valuation, but rather were allowed to purchase Kerr publications at a deep discount off cover price. The company's pocket-sized \"Pocket Library of Socialism\" series of 5 cent pamphlets — each covered in distinctive red cellophane — were priced as cheaply as $6 per 1,000 copies when purchased by stockholders; Kerr's small cloth-bound \"Standard Socialist Series\" of works by Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, Karl Kautsky, and other leading Marxist theoreticians sold at a 50 percent discount, plus freight.\n\nWhile not a lucrative business model, this promise of cheap socialist literature made the purchase of Kerr stock extremely attractive to locals of the Social Democratic Party of America and its immediate successor, the Socialist Party of America. A very close relationship developed between the company and the organized socialist movement in America, with Kerr handling the bulk of publishing book-length manuscripts and no small number of pamphlets, while the Socialist Party largely limited its publishing efforts to propaganda leaflets and a somewhat tighter array of pamphlets, particularly during the party's earliest years.\n\nKerr was noted for his translation from the French of the radical workers' movement anthem, \"The Internationale;\" his version became the English words sung in the United States (although a different, anonymous English translation is sung in Britain and Ireland). Kerr's version was widely circulated in the IWW's \"Little Red Songbook\". In 1906 Kerr published the first volume of Karl Marx's \"Das Kapital.\" Kerr & Co. followed this effort with the publication of volumes 2 and 3 of \"Capital,\" making use of original translations made by \"ISR\" editorial staff member Ernest Untermann and thus becoming the first publisher of this material in the world in the English language. In addition to the first English edition of Marx's Das Kapital, Kerr also published the first English edition of Friedrich Nietzsche's 'Human All Too Human' in 1908, translated by Alexander Harvey, a Belgian-born American journalist.\n\nin 1908, publisher Charles H. Kerr, unhappy with what he perceived the scholastic and overly theoretical bent of \"International Socialist Review,\" dismissed editor Simons and himself took over the publication's editorial role, assisted by the capable radical Mary Marcy. Reflecting Kerr's own increasingly radical politics, the magazine's political line moved further to the left wing of the socialist movement, with new emphasis given to current events in the strike movement and the activity of the Industrial Workers of the World. The magazine also soon changed in form, making increased use of graphics for the illustration of rather shorter articles printed on glossier paper stock. Although a somewhat polarizing decision, alienating the moderate wing of the Socialist Party, \"ISR's\" circulation and influence grew significantly in the years following these changes.\n\nDuring World War I, the US government denied mailing privileges to all Kerr publications, alleging them to be seditious violations of the Espionage Act of 1917. The ban dealt a fatal blow to the \"ISR,\" never a profitable publication in the best of times.\n\nIn Canada a 1918 Order in Council of the Canadian government made it illegal for any Canadian to possess any literature published by Charles H. Kerr & Co., under penalty of a $5,000 fine or five years' imprisonment.\n\nImmediately after the war, Charles Kerr came into close contact with the Scottish-born Detroit radical John Keracher through the latter's \"Proletarian University\" movement and its need for Marxist literature. In 1920, Keracher took a faction out of the underground Communist Party of America and established a small rival organization, the Proletarian Party of America (PPA). Keracher became a member of the Kerr Board of the Directors in 1924 and in 1928 Charles Kerr sold him the bulk of his controlling shares in the firm.\n\nThereafter, the Proletarian Party controlled the operations of Kerr & Co., publishing a number of Keracher's works, including \"How the Gods Were Made\" (1929), \"Producers and Parasites\" (1935), \"The Head-Fixing Industry\" (1935), \"Crime: Its Causes and Consequences\" (1937), and \"Frederick Engels\" (1946). Owing to poor finances and the small size of the organization, comparatively few additional Kerr titles were ever published by the PPA, although the backlist of the company was no doubt invaluable in maintaining the tiny organization's solvency.\n\nFollowing the departure of the Proletarian Party from the scene in the 1960s, Charles H. Kerr & Co. was kept alive by a hardy band of midwestern radicals close to the IWW orbit under its new moniker, Charles H. Kerr Publishing Co. \nAmong their major publications were the “Haymarket Scrapbook” Edited by David Roediger and Franklin Rosemont” and the “Big Red Songbook” an anthology of essays and songs of the Wobblies edited by folklorist Archie Green, et al.\nToday, the Company advertises \"Subversive literature for the whole family since 1886.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2236690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236690", "title": "Baháʼí teachings", "text": "Baháʼí teachings\n\nThe Baháʼí teachings represent a considerable number of theological, social, and spiritual ideas that were established in the Baháʼí Faith by Baháʼu'lláh, the founder of the religion, and clarified by successive leaders including ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, Baháʼu'lláh's son, and Shoghi Effendi, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's grandson. The teachings were written in various Baháʼí writings. The teachings of the religion, combined with the authentic teachings of several past religions, including Islam and Christianity, are regarded by Baháʼís as teaching revealed by God.\n\nThe Baháʼí teachings include theological statements about God, his messengers, and humans, as well as social teachings including the equality of all humans, regardless of gender, race and class, the harmony of science of religion, compulsory education, and the elimination of extremes of wealth and poverty, among others.\n\nThe most prominent and distinctive principles in the Baháʼí teachings are love and unity, which are exemplified by the Golden rule, and the many social principles.\n\nShoghi Effendi, the appointed head of the religion from 1921–1957, wrote the following summary of what he considered to be the distinguishing principles of Baháʼu'lláh's teachings, which, he said, together with the laws and ordinances of the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\" constitute the bed-rock of the Baháʼí Faith:\nThe independent search after truth, unfettered by superstition or tradition; the oneness of the entire human race, the pivotal principle and fundamental doctrine of the Faith; the basic unity of all religions; the condemnation of all forms of prejudice, whether religious, racial, class or national; the harmony which must exist between religion and science; the equality of men and women, the two wings on which the bird of human kind is able to soar; the introduction of compulsory education; the adoption of a universal auxiliary language; the abolition of the extremes of wealth and poverty; the institution of a world tribunal for the adjudication of disputes between nations; the exaltation of work, performed in the spirit of service, to the rank of worship; the glorification of justice as the ruling principle in human society, and of religion as a bulwark for the protection of all peoples and nations; and the establishment of a permanent and universal peace as the supreme goal of all mankind—these stand out as the essential elements [which Baháʼu'lláh proclaimed].\n\nThree core assertions of the Baháʼí Faith, sometimes termed the \"three onenesses\", are central in the teachings of the religion. They are the \"Oneness of God\", the \"Oneness of Religion\" and the \"Oneness of Humanity\". They are also referred to as the unity of God, unity of religion, and unity of mankind. The Baháʼí writings state that there is a single, all-powerful god, revealing his message through a series of divine messengers or educators, regarding them as one progressively revealed religion, to one single humanity, who all possess a rational soul and only differ according to colour and culture. This idea is fundamental not only to explaining Baháʼí beliefs, but explaining the attitude Baháʼís have towards other religions, which they regard as divinely inspired. The acceptance of every race and culture in the world has brought Baháʼí demographics diversity, becoming the second most widespread faith in the world, and translating its literature into over 800 languages.\n\nThe Baháʼí view of God is essentially monotheistic. God is the imperishable, uncreated being who is the source of all existence. He is described as \"a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty\". Though transcendent and inaccessible directly, his image is reflected in his creation. The purpose of creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and love its creator.\n\nIn Baha'i belief, although human cultures and religions differ on their conceptions of God and his nature, the different references to God nevertheless refer to one and the same Being. The differences, instead of being regarded as irreconcilable constructs of mutually exclusive cultures, are seen as purposefully reflective of the varying needs of the societies in which the divine messages were revealed.\n\nThe Baháʼí teachings state that God is too great for humans to create an accurate conception of. In the Baháʼí understanding, the attributes attributed to God, such as \"All-Powerful\" and \"All-Loving\" are derived from limited human experiences of power and love. Baháʼu'lláh taught that the knowledge of God is limited to those attributes and qualities which are perceptible to us, and thus direct knowledge of God is not possible. Furthermore, Baháʼu'lláh states that knowledge of the attributes of God is revealed to humanity through his messengers.\n\nAs our knowledge of things, even of created and limited things, is knowledge of their qualities and not of their essence, how is it possible to comprehend in its essence the Divine Reality, which is unlimited? ... Knowing God, therefore, means the comprehension and the knowledge of His attributes, and not of His Reality. This knowledge of the attributes is also proportioned to the capacity and power of man; it is not absolute.\n\nWhile the Baháʼí writings teach of a personal god who is a being with a personality (including the capacity to reason and to feel love), they clearly state that this does not imply a human or physical form. The Baháʼí teachings state that one can get closer to God through prayer, meditation, study of the holy writings, and service.\n\nThe Baháʼí writings teach that there is but one humanity and all people are equal in the sight of God. The Baháʼí Faith emphasizes the unity of humanity transcending all divisions of race, nation, gender, caste, and social class, while celebrating its diversity. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá states that the unification of mankind has now become \"the paramount issue and question in the religious and political conditions of the world.\" The Baháʼí writings affirm the biological, political, and spiritual unity of mankind. Baháʼu'lláh wrote:\n\nYe are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch. Deal ye one with another with the utmost love and harmony, with friendliness and fellowship.\n\nRegarding biological unity the Baháʼí writings state that differences between various races, nations, and ethnic groups are either superficial (e.g. skin colour) or the result of differences in background or education. A basic Baháʼí teaching is the elimination of all forms of prejudice, which refers to not only the elimination of racial prejudice but also that of other forms of prejudice such as gender discrimination.\n\nThe Baháʼí teachings state that while ethnic and cultural diversity will continue to exist, humanity's first allegiance will be with the human race rather than any subsidiary group such as race, nation, or ethnic group. There will be an end not only to war, but even to inter-group rivalry.\n\nWhile the Baháʼí writings talk about the unity of the world and its peoples, unity is not equated to uniformity, but instead the Baháʼí writings affirm the value of cultural, national and individual diversity through the principle of \"Unity in diversity,\" which states that while recognizing the unity of mankind, cultural diversity should be celebrated. Unity in diversity is commonly described in the Baháʼí writings through the analogy of flowers of one garden, where the different colours of the flowers add to the beauty of the garden.\n\nIt [the Faith] does not ignore, nor does it attempt to suppress, the diversity of ethnic origins, of climate, of history, of language and tradition, of thought and habit, that differentiate the peoples and nations of the world... Its watchword is unity in diversity...\n\nThe Baháʼí teachings state that there is but one religion which is progressively revealed by God, through prophets/messengers, to mankind as humanity matures and its capacity to understand also grows. The outward differences in the religions, the Baháʼí writings state, are due to the exigencies of the time and place the religion was revealed. Baháʼu'lláh claimed to be the most recent, but not the last, in a series of divine educators which include Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, and others.\n\nThe Baháʼí writings state that the essential nature of the messengers is twofold: they are at once human and divine. They are divine in that they all come from the same god and expound his teachings, and thus they can be seen in the same light, but at the same time they are separate individuals known by different names, who fulfill definite missions and are entrusted with particular revelations. Baháʼu'lláh in many places states that denying any of the messengers of God is equivalent to denying all of them, and God himself. Regarding the relationships of these educators, which Baháʼís refer to as Manifestations of God Baháʼu'lláh writes:\n\nGod hath ordained the knowledge of these sanctified Beings to be identical with the knowledge of His own Self. Whoso recognizeth them hath recognized God. Whoso hearkeneth to their call, hath hearkened to the Voice of God, and whoso testifieth to the truth of their Revelation, hath testified to the truth of God Himself. Whoso turneth away from them, hath turned away from God, and whoso disbelieveth in them, hath disbelieved in God . . . They are the Manifestations of God amidst men, the evidences of His Truth, and the signs of His glory.\n\nBaháʼís believe God to be generally regular and periodic in revealing His will to mankind through messengers/prophets, which are named Manifestations of God. Each messenger in turn establishes a covenant and founds a religion. This process of revelation, according to the Baháʼí writings, is also never ceasing, which is contrary to many other belief systems that believe in a finality of their prophet/messenger. The general theme of the successive and continuous religions founded by Manifestations of God is that there is an evolutionary tendency, and that each Manifestation of God brings a larger measure of revelation (or religion) to humankind than the previous one. The differences in the revelation brought by the Manifestations of God is stated to be not inherent in the characteristics of the Manifestation of God, but instead attributed to the various worldly, societal and human factors; these differences are in accordance with the \"conditions\" and \"varying requirements of the age\" and the \"spiritual capacity\" of humanity. These differences are seen to be needed since human society has slowly and gradually evolved through higher stages of unification from the family to tribes and then nations.\n\nThus religious truth is seen to be relative to its recipients and not absolute; while the messengers proclaimed eternal moral and spiritual truths that are renewed by each messenger, they also changed their message to reflect the particular spiritual and material evolution of humanity at the time of the appearance of the messenger. In the Baháʼí view, since humanity's spiritual capacity and receptivity has increased over time, the extent to which these spiritual truths are expounded changes.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh explained that the appearance of successive messengers was like the annual coming of Spring, which brings new life to the world which has come to neglect the teachings of the previous messenger. He also used an analogy of the world as the human body, and revelation as a robe of \"justice and wisdom\".\n\nBaháʼu'lláh mentioned in the \"Kitáb-i-Íqán\" that God will renew the \"City of God\" about every thousand years, and specifically mentioned that a new Manifestation of God would not appear within 1000 years of Baháʼu'lláh's message.\n\nThe earliest forms of religion are seen, in many of the Baháʼí Writings, to be like early school. In this view humanity, like a child, has been maturing with a greater ability to grasp complex ideas as it grows in years and passes school. Each time a divine messenger appear, the message was given at levels appropriate to humanity's degree of maturation. In this view each different religion may have had truth explained differently according to the needs of the recipients of the teaching.\n\nCovenant in the Baháʼí Faith refers to two separate binding agreements between God and man. There is a distinction between a \"Greater Covenant\" which is made between every messenger from God and his followers concerning the next dispensation, and a \"Lesser Covenant\" that concerns successorship of authority within the religion after the messenger dies.\n\nThe greater covenant refers to the covenant made between each messenger from God, which the literature of the Baháʼí Faith name Manifestations of God, and his followers regarding the coming of the next Manifestation from God. According to Baháʼu'lláh God has promised that he will send a succession of messengers that will instruct humankind. In Baháʼí belief, this covenant is seen to be expressed in prophecy in the religious scripture of each religion, and each Manifestation of God, such as Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, the Báb, and Baháʼu'lláh, prophesied the next Manifestation. In return, the followers of each religion are seen to have a duty to investigate the claims of the following Manifestations.\n\nThe lesser covenant is a covenant that concerns the recognition of the messenger, acceptance and application of his teachings and laws made regarding the successorship of authority within the religion. In Baháʼí belief the manner in which the Covenant of Baháʼu'lláh was clearly put forth is seen as being a fundamental defining feature of the religion and a powerful protector of the unity of the Baháʼí Faith and its adherents.\n\nThe following principles are frequently listed as a quick summary of the Baháʼí teachings. They are derived from transcripts of speeches given by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá during his tour of Europe and North America in 1912. The list is not authoritative and a variety of such lists circulate.\n\nThe Baháʼí Faith affirms gender equality; that men and women are equal. Baháʼu'lláh noted that there was no distinction in the spiritual stations of men and women. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá wrote that both men and women possess the same potential for virtues and intelligence, and compared the two genders and the progress of civilization to the two wings of a bird where each wing is needed to provide flight. In this sense, the equality of the sexes is seen as Baháʼís as a spiritual and moral standard that is essential for the unification of the planet and the unfoldment of world order, and in the importance of implementing the principle in individual, family, and community life.\n\nWhile the Baháʼí teachings assert the full spiritual and social equality of women to men, there are some aspects of gender distinctiveness or gender differentiation in certain areas of life. Men and women are seen as having different strength and abilities that enable them to better fill different roles. Thus there are certain teachings that give preference to men in some limited circumstances and some that give preference to women. One of these aspects relate to biological fact of potential motherhood for women, and thus the Baháʼí teaching that girls should be given priority in education as they potentially would be the children's first educator. In terms of Baháʼí administration, all positions except for membership on the Universal House of Justice are open to men and women. No specific reason has been given for this exception, but ʻAbdu'l-Bahá has stated that there is a wisdom for it, which would eventually become clear. Regardless rates of women serving at national levels of governance in the religion exceed those in general society: in 2010 the world average for female members of parliaments was 19%, while the world average of women serving on national assemblies had reached rates of 39%.\n\nThe harmony of science and religion is a central tenet of the Baháʼí teachings. The principle states that that truth is one, and therefore true science and true religion must be in harmony, thus rejecting the view that science and religion are in conflict. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá asserted that science without religion leads to materialism, and religion without science leads to superstition; he also affirmed that reasoning powers are required to understand the truths of religion. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá condemned civilizations based solely on materialistic beliefs which he said would bring about moral problems.\n\nThe theme of education in the Baháʼí Faith is given quite prominent emphasis. Its literature gives a principle of universal, or compulsory education. The Baháʼí teachings focus on promoting a moral and spiritual education, in addition to the arts, trades, sciences and professions. Baháʼu'lláh wrote that the spiritual capacities of each individual could not be achieved without spiritual education, and thus children needed to have spiritual/religious education from an early stage. He also stressed the importance of secular education in that one's work and vocation is socially important. The Baháʼí teachings state it is the obligation of the parents to provide for the education of their children, and that special importance should be given to the education of girls.\n\nAs part of the focus on the unity of humankind, the Baháʼí teachings see improved communication between peoples throughout the world as a vital part of world unity and peace. The Baháʼí teachings see the current multiplicity of languages as a major impediment to unity, since the existence of so many languages cuts the free flow of information and makes it difficult for the average individual to obtain a universal perspective on world events.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh taught that the lack of a common language is a major barrier to world unity since the lack of communication between peoples of different languages undermines efforts toward world peace due to misunderstandings of language; he urged that humanity should choose an auxiliary language that would be taught in schools in addition to one's own native language, so that people could understand one another. He stated that until an auxiliary language is adopted, complete unity between the various parts of the world would continue to be unrealized.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh stressed, however, that the auxiliary language should not suppress existing natural languages, and that the concept of \"unity in diversity\" must be applied to languages. The Baháʼí teachings state that cultural heterogeneity is compatible with unity, and that at the present time in the history of humankind, the Baháʼí teaching of unity requires the embracing of cultural diversity since humanity is enriched by the various cultures throughout the world. The Baháʼí teachings also state that having an international auxiliary language would remove the pressure from the natural aggrandizement of majority language groups and thus preserve minority languages, since each person would keep their own mother-tongue, and thus minority cultures.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh taught that each human being must acquire knowledge through their processes, and not blindly believe or follow others blindly, and he made it a fundamental obligation. He stated that since Truth is one, that when a person independently investigates they lead to the same truth and help lead to the oneness of humanity. Baha'is are forbidden from communicating with Covenant-breakers or reading their literature. Additionally when Baha'is published material explaining the religion, the Baha'i administration had practiced \"literature review,\" a fact decried by some, wherein Baháʼís submit their material for vetting before it is published to ensure credibility from the administration's understanding.\n\nThe teachings of the Baháʼí Faith state that it is necessary to eliminate the extremes of wealth and poverty. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá noted both poverty and extreme wealth disallowed for a compassionate society, as poverty demoralized people and extreme wealth overburdened people. Baháʼu'lláh wrote that rich should take care of the poor, as the poor are a divine trust. The Baháʼí teachings state of multiple ways of addressing the extremes of wealth and poverty including institutional means, such as Huqúqu'lláh, as well as creating a sense of mutual concern.\n\nWhile the Baháʼí teachings promote the elimination of extremes of wealth and poverty they do not promote communism and instead legitimize individual property. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá further noted that wealth by itself was not evil, and could be used for good.\n\nThe Bahá'í writings contain many references to spiritual qualities and values that individuals should strive to develop. The elements of good character include, among others, trustworthiness, truthfulness, faithfulness, sincerity, purity of motivation, service, justice, moderation, cleanliness, dignity and avoiding backbiting, balanced by reason and knowledge.\n\nGod is described in the Baháʼí writings a single, personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty God who is the creator of all things in the universe. The existence of God and the universe is thought to be eternal, without a beginning or end. The Baháʼí teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a complete and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations. In the Baháʼí religion God is often referred to by titles and attributes (e.g. the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on monotheism. The Baháʼí teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path. According to the Baháʼí teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as prayer, reflection and being of service to humankind.\n\nThe Baháʼí writings state that human beings have a \"rational soul\", and that this provides the species with a unique capacity to recognize God's station and humanity's relationship with its creator. Every human is seen to have a duty to recognize God through His messengers, and to conform to their teachings. Through recognition and obedience, service to humanity and regular prayer and spiritual practice, the Baháʼí writings state that the soul becomes closer to God, the spiritual ideal in Baháʼí belief. When a human dies, the soul passes into the next world, where its spiritual development in the physical world becomes a basis for judgment and advancement in the spiritual world. Baháʼís' believe in the eternal life of the soul rather than reincarnation. Heaven and Hell are taught to be spiritual states of nearness or distance from God that describe relationships in this world and the next, and not physical places of reward and punishment achieved after death. See Baháʼí Faith on life after death.\n\n\"Baháʼí administration\" or \"Baháʼí administrative order\" is the administrative system of the religion which directly rests on the teachings of the religion penned by its central figures - especially Baháʼu'lláh and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. It is split into two parts, the elected and the appointed. The supreme governing institution of the Baháʼí Faith is the Universal House of Justice, situated in Haifa, Israel.\n\nThe Baháʼí administration has four charter scriptural documents,\n\nKey to the function of Baháʼí organization is the principle of consultation. This refers to the method of non-adversarial discussion and decision-making which is described in the Baháʼí writings, and which is used in all levels of Baháʼí administration. Consultation strives to move beyond a decision making process that accepts the majority view, to one that aims to discover truth through universal participation and disciplined cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The school is owned by the City of Fairfax, but is operated by Fairfax County Public Schools as part of a contractual agreement with the adjacent municipality, County of Fairfax.\n\nThe school building, opened in 1972, is located on Old Lee Highway in eastern Fairfax City. In 2007, FHS underwent a $54 million renovation designed by architectural firm BeeryRio7. Renovations began in March 2005 and added . of classroom space. Student size has increased at such a high rate that four trailers have been installed.\n\nThe previous campus (1936–72) on Fairfax Boulevard is now Paul VI Catholic High School.\n\nFor the 2013–2014 school year, Fairfax High School's student body was 41% White, 25% Asian, 0.2% Native American, 5% Other.\n\nFairfax High School is a fully accredited high school based on the Standards of Learning tests in Virginia. The average SAT score in 2009–2010 for FHS The average SAT score in 2018 was 1192 on the 1600 scale. \n\nIn 2010–2011, Fairfax High School was ranked the nation's 201st best high school. In 2019, FHS was ranked as Virginia's 32nd best high school. \n\nFairfax's nickname is the Rebels, and the athletic teams currently compete in the AAA Liberty District and Northern Region. The closest high schools to Fairfax are Oakton ( north) and W.T. Woodson ( south). The Northern Region was realigned for the 1994–95 school year, with Fairfax moved to the Liberty District, and Annandale to the Patriot District. Without district competition, the rivalry with Annandale has lessened, and Fairfax's main rival is now nearby W.T. Woodson.\n\nIn athletics, Fairfax was probably best known for the strong football teams that it fielded under the guidance of three successful head coaches. The first was Dick Claypool (1961–78), with the most wins at Fairfax. He left after the 1978 season and the football program languished until the fall of 1983.\n\nFrancis Dall was hired by Athletic Director Pat Laing as Head Coach in 1983 and led the Rebels from 1983–88. Pat Laing also hired long time Wrestling Coach Mitch Sutterfield in the early 1980s as well as long time Basketball Coach Steve Henry & Field Hockey Coach Starr Karl. Coach Dall's arrival changed the culture at FHS and helped propel Fairfax High School Athletic teams for the next 15 years. Dall turned FHS sports from losing programs into winning programs. Dall hired friend & UVA roommate Tom Verbanic who would succeed Dall as Head Coach & lead the FHS Baseball successfully from 1986-1999. Dall hired two coaches from West Springfield High School former West Springfield Head coach Bill Hanley (FHS Softball Head Coach) & Pete Gallagher. Dall hired assistants Mike Kowalski, Mike Campbell, Clevland Lott, Dan Keating & kept holdovers Mitch Sutterfield & Lyndsey Ott. Fairfax football teams under Dall made the VHSL Northern Region playoffs for the 1st time under Dall with the 1987 was 7-3 reaching the Division 5 Northern Region Final to Marshall High School. In Dall's final season Fairfax went undefeated for the first time going 10-0. The 1988 team defeated 70's & 80's rival and powerhouse Annandale High School for the first time since 1973. The 1988 season ended poorly as the team suffered a shocking first round loss to West Potomac High School 20-13. In early January 1989 Coach Dall stunned everyone and stepped down as Head Coach of Fairfax to take a similar position at Lake Braddock High School.\n\nIn 1989 Tom Verbanic succeeded his friend Francis Dall. Verbanic only elevated the Fairfax High School football program which Dall had transformed starting in 1983. His teams achieved perfect regular seasons in 1991, 1998, and 1999, but the team's greatest success came in 1994. That team was in the regular season, with the only loss being a drubbing to rival Annandale in Week 2. Before losing in the state semifinals, the team captured the school's only Northern Region football title, by way of a closely contested win over West Potomac. Fairfax's record in 1994 was with the only losses being to teams that won state titles in the largest classifications - Patrick Henry-Ashland (AAA Division 5 and Annandale (AAA Division 6)).\n\nFollowing the 1999 season, Coach Verbanic left Fairfax to start the football program at the newly opened Westfield High School. Westfield's Director of Student Activities was Francis Dall, Verbanic's college roommate at the University of Virginia. Prior to his current role, Dall was an extremely successful head football coach in his own right at Lake Braddock, which had the most wins of any high school in the Northern Region in the 1990s.\n\nFollowing Coach Verbanic's departure, Fairfax has returned to the playoffs twice; in 2009 and 2010. To understand how far the program has fallen, one only has to look at the 2007 season, which resulted in a second straight record, including being shut out six times and allowing 322 points. By comparison, the 1994 team only allowed 90 points during the regular season, and 153 points including the three playoff games. The 2016 season was by far one of the worst seasons in recent memory as the team finished \n\nMost recently the Rebel Pride brought home the state title for cheerleading (2009, 2013), the school's second and third state titles (first being in Swim & Dive). The Fairfax HS Cheer Program is under the direction of Head Coach Wes Vaughan.\n\nFairfax athletes who have been first team All-Met selections by the \"Washington Post\", since the 1990–91 school year:\n\n2016-17: Emily Deivert (Field Hockey) \n2014–15:Rachel Barborek (Gymnastics),\n2013–14: Nick Scott (Football), Kiana Sherlund (Softball), Joe Rice (Soccer)\n2010–11: Samantha Cormode (Soccer)\n2009–10: Kevin Dowd (Boys Cross Country), Joey Kelly (Boys Swimming), Kelli Stockton (Girls Swimming) \n2008–09: Sidarth Balaji & Jason Luu (Tennis) \n2007–08: Emily Ferguson (Swimming), Coach Matt Salerno (Girls Swimming), Sidarth Balaji (Tennis), Lauren Palmucci (Tennis)\n2006–07: Gina Winters (Soccer), Sidarth Balaji (Tennis)\n2005–06: Gina Winters (Soccer)\n2001–02: Sean Doolan (Gymnastics, Gymnast of the Year), Ray Hacker (Gymnastics)\n2000–01: Matt Johnson (Golf), Coach Mike Personick, Sean Doolan & Ray Hacker (Gymnastics), Adam Jelinek (Soccer)\n1999–2000: Brandon Royster (Football), Matt Johnson (Golf), Sean Doolan & Ray Hacker (Gymnastics)\n1998–99: Brad Thomas (Football), Coach Milt Papke (Golf), Sean Doolan & Ray Hacker (Gymnastics)\n1997–98: Katie Silverthorne (Field Hockey), John Eastman (Wrestling, Co-Wrestler of the Year)& Justin Potter (Wrestling), Inhar Chong (Outdoor Track)\n1996–97: John Eastman (Wrestling), Melanie Brophy (Softball), Inhar Chong (Outdoor Track)\n1995–96: Chuck Freeman (Baseball), Linda Young (Softball)\n1993–94: Coach Lisa Burner (Field Hockey), Heather Schnelzer (Gymnastics)\n1992–93: Tina Boyce (Field Hockey), Heather Schnelzer (Gymnastics)\n1991–92: Britta Connolly, Amber Moshos (Field Hockey), Heather Schnelzer (Gymnastics), Earl Smith (Indoor & Outdoor Track)\n1990–91: Carrie Hartley (Field Hockey), Katie Gultnieks (Tennis), Mara Cunningham (Basketball), Jamie Dykes (Girls Soccer), Bill Pulsipher (Baseball, Player of the Year), Brian Buchanan (Baseball)\n\nThe previous mascot of Fairfax High School was a caricature of a Confederate soldier known as \"Johnny Reb\" (see picture at left). Due to complaints from students and parents, and at the suggestion of the school's Minority Achievement Task Force, the principal (Harry Holsinger) removed the Johnny Reb symbol in 1985. Student protests, rallies, and a lawsuit followed, which challenged the principal's actions as violating the First Amendment guarantees of free speech. In \"Crosby v. Holsinger\", 852 F.2d 801 (4th Cir. 1988), the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the federal district court decision in favor of the principal. After Johnny Reb was removed, the mascot was a set of crossed swords, and an unusual mascot, that resembled a ball of lint, called the Rebel Rouser. In 2002, the school changed its mascot to a set of 5 stars, and their sports teams were nicknamed \"Fairfax Stars\", a reference to Fairfax High School's Honor Roll, which from 1995 had referred to talented, upcoming students as 'Rising Stars', rather than the atypical 'Honor Roll Student'. In 2004, the nickname was returned to the Rebels, however the mascot for Fairfax High is now a lion.\n\nFairfax High School currently follows the Virginia Department of Education curriculum. The school also hosts Fairfax Academy: School for the Arts, which includes classes such as graphic design and photography. The Academy also features Korean and Chinese. The school has a strong AVID Program, a Reward and Remediation Program, and Honors programs in all areas.\n\nFind out more about clubs: https://web.archive.org/web/20101125014532/http://fcps.edu/FairfaxHS/clubs/newclub.htm\n\nThe Fairfax High School Choral Department is currently under the direction of Juliana Woodill and consists of five ensembles divided by skill level, as well as by the requirement of audition. A beginning group, Women's Concert Choir which is available to freshman women only. Intermediate groups, Men's Ensemble and Select Women's Choir which are made available to men in grades 9-12 and women in grades 10-12. Finally, the two auditioned advanced choral groups, Bel Canto, a group of select women in grades 10-12 and Voce, a selective mixed ensemble for students in 10-12th grades. The choral department also has two extracurricular groups the Show Choir, Fairfax Fame, and Rebel Treble, an auditioned student-led mixed \"a Cappella\" ensemble. Approximately 110 students participate in the Fairfax choirs.\n\nFairfax choral students also participate in District Chorus, Virginia Honors Choir and All-State Chorus, as well as a regional competition trip in the spring. Choral groups perform music of many periods and styles and develop musicianship through vocal technique, sight-reading, and music theory. The choir program holds several concerts over the course of the year, the largest, Spring Show is held in early May and a Cabaret is held in the early winter. In addition to the choral concerts held at FHS, students have performed in the Fairfax musicals, at the Fairfax Festival of Lights, George Mason basketball games, corporate parties, Fairfax Corner, the New York City Festivals of Music, Heritage Festival in Atlanta, Georgia, the Smoky Mountain Music Festival in Gatlinburg, Tennessee and Festival Disney.\n\nFairfax has a strong band program, including a marching band which has won numerous championships. Included in the Rebel Band is the Fairfax High School Drumline, which placed third in the Atlantic Indoor Association (AIA) championships in North Carolina in 2006, third in 2010, and second in 2011. In 2009, they performed in Dayton, Ohio for Winter Guard International and received 4th place in their preliminary group and 18th in semifinals. Overall, they placed 18th out of 60 groups. Other teams that accompany the Band program are the Fall Guard (competes with the marching band) and the Winterguard (competes separately). The Fairfax High School Band was under the direction of Ms. Meghan Benson, and won second place at a band competition at the Smoky Mountain Music Festival, in Gatlinburg, Tennessee in the spring of 2008. The Marching Band won third place in the local Fourth of July Parade independence Day celebration, and was awarded $2000 in 2008. At the end of the 2008 Marching Rebel season the band received a 1- Superior rating at the VBODA Championships. The Fairfax High School Band Program received a superior rating at both Marching and Symphonic Band festivals making it eligible to receive the award of Virginia State Honor Band for the first time in the school's 75-year history. The band has repeated the feat every year since. Because of the work of the Marching Band and Symphonic Band along with the work of the orchestral and choral departments, Fairfax was able to earn the title of Blue Ribbon School for the performing arts, which is achieved by Superior ratings at VBODA state marching festival, and a Superior rating for each of the top performing groups at District Festival. At the competition on their spring trip in the year 2009 to Orlando, Florida, the Rebel band placed second in its class by a margin of less than one point and received the Silver Award Overall in Festival Disney.\n\nIn its 2009 season, the Marching Rebels won all of the competitions they competed in and got awards for quality music and general effect. They performed the show called \"Heroes, Gods and Mythical Creatures\" and performed at the Herndon USSBA Regionals, the Oakton Classic, and the James Madison University Parade of Champions. The Rebels placed first in Class 3A in the Herndon Showcase of Bands without proper uniforms which were destroyed in a flood due to a heating malfunction, also received first at the Oakton Classic. At the final major competition, the band placed 1st in Class 3A with a score of 84.75. At the VBODA state marching festival the rebels received a superior rating and got straight 1s from all of the judges. The symphonic band received straight 1s the following spring to complete the Virginia Honor Band title.\n\nThe 2010 season was also a great success with the show \"Nautilus\", with the Marching Rebels winning 2nd place in class 3A at the Herndon USSBA regionals (short to Thomas Jefferson by a fraction of a point), 1st place at the Oakton Classic, 1st place at the JMU parade of Champions, and straight 1s from all of the judges at the VBODA state marching festival. The symphonic band received straight 1s the following spring to complete the Virginia Honor Band title.\n\nThe band has quickly become one of the best bands in the state and has become widely renowned for its fantastic sound and quick rise to success.\n\nThe new band director was welcomed to Fairfax Band in the year of 2011-2012. The new director, Alan P. Johnson led the Marching Rebels into MANY championships. The Fairfax Marching Rebels got 1st place in all competitions and even won the Esprit de Corps award by the Navy. It is awarded to the band with the most professionalism and patriotism etc. The 2011 season was also a great success with the show \"The Struggle Within\".\n\nIn the 2012 season of the Fairfax Marching Rebels, the band went to numerous competitions and won 1st place in almost all they performed in. The show, \"Metamorphosis\", was performed at James Madison University Parade of Champions and won them 1st place with a score of over 90 points. Also, the Fairfax Marching Band went to two Bands of America competitions and respectively won 4th and 6th place in the finals round of the competitions. Furthermore, they have won the VBODA state marching festival with a superior rating and straight 1s from all the judges.\n\nThe Fairfax High School Orchestra Department is currently directed by Gerald Fowkes. The Orchestra consists of four different levels; Beginning, Intermediate, Concert, and Chamber. The Beginning Orchestra focuses on basic elements of music education and teaches the student fundamentals to prepare them and educate them on music. Intermediate and Concert are 2 different orchestras designed to test and challenge the musicians at a higher level (VBODA pieces grade 4 and 5). And the Advanced Orchestra (playing grade 6 pieces) is the highest level in the Orchestra Department. There are approximately 100 students in the Orchestra program for the enrollment of the 2009-2010 school year. The Orchestra annually participates in District Festival in which the orchestra plays a series of pieces and is graded on them. Often it is believed that the experience is a competition between schools, but it is highly encouraged that the competition be amongst and within the students. The Orchestra also attends a Spring trip annually to various places in America. Some examples include Atlanta, Orlando, New York, and Gatlinburg. The past school year of 2009-2010, the Fairfax High School Orchestra went to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina for the annual Spring Trip. The Orchestra is also known for their pit appearances in school plays such as Beauty & the Beast and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. In the 2017-18 school year, the Fairfax High School Orchestra had the distinct honor of performing in New York's Carnegie Hall.\n\nIn 2008-2009, The Fairfax High School Orchestra, along with the Chorus and Band Department earned the Blue Ribbon Award, which is awarded to a school in which the highest section of each music department receives Superiors at District Festival.\n\nThe FX Players is the Drama Club at Fairfax High School. They are dedicated toward the promotion of theatre in every aspect. The current director is Erich DiCenzo.\n\nFairfax Theatre was honored by the Cappies organization with seven nominations, including Best Musical, for the 2009 performance of \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\", and was invited to perform the opening number at the Cappies Gala at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. In Mr. DiCenzo's first year at the helm, Fairfax theatre achieved major success in 2014 with 13 nominations, including Best Musical, for its production of \"9 to 5: the Musical\". Fairfax continued its success in 2015 with nine nominations, again including Best Musical, for its production of \"\".\n\nFairfax has an orchestra pit that can be covered and uncovered, but it is normally kept in the house floor position due to safety concerns. For the run of \"The King and I\" in 2007, however, the pit was opened. It was then closed again, and the orchestra has played at house level since. The members of the pit orchestra are some of the only musicians in Fairfax County to have ever played a musical in an actual orchestra pit (Hayfield Secondary School also has a working orchestra pit). The pit sinks six feet below the stage.\n\nThe FX Players won the State Title at the VHSL One-Act Competition in 2008. They placed second at Districts in 2009.\n\nThe \"It's Academic\" team participates in quiz bowl tournaments throughout Virginia, Maryland, and DC, most notably NBC 4's \"It's Academic\" game show hosted by Mac McGarry.\n\nThe team competes well in tournaments. In January 2009, Fairfax placed second in the Concorde District at the VHSL AAA District Tournament. The team advanced to the regional tournament for the first time in several years. Overall, Fairfax placed third in the Northern Region tying with Langley High School.\n\nDaniels Run Elementary School, Green Briar East Elementary School, Willow Springs Elementary School, Eagle View Elementary School, Providence Elementary School, and Mosby Woods Elementary School all feed into Lanier Middle School and Rocky Run Middle School, which feed into Fairfax High School.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2236696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236696", "title": "Baháʼí laws", "text": "Baháʼí laws\n\nBaháʼí laws are laws and ordinances used in the Baháʼí Faith and are a fundamental part of Baháʼí practice. The laws are based on authenticated texts from Baháʼu'lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, and also includes subsequent interpretations from ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, and legislation by the Universal House of Justice. Baháʼí law is presented as a set of general principles and guidelines and individuals must apply them as they best seem fit. While some of the social laws are enforced by Baháʼí institutions, the emphasis is placed on individuals following the laws based on their conscience, understanding and reasoning, and Baháʼís are expected to follow the laws for the love of Baháʼu'lláh. The laws are seen as the method of the maintenance of order and security in the world.\n\nThe Baháʼí Faith had its roots in the Bábí Religion which was started by the Báb in the mid-19th century in Persia. Originally Bábís adhered to the Islamic laws, but this changed when the Báb wrote a Bábí code of law in the Bayán, which replaced them. However, the Báb's laws were not widely practiced by the Bábís, and instead many Bábís became antinomian; they also marked their new religious identity by deliberately not abiding by Islamic practice.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh, as both his initial role as Bábí leader, and then as Bábí messianic figure, condemned the antinomian tendencies of the community. At the request of his followers, he eventually wrote a book of laws, the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\", which he completed while he was in Acre, Palestine.\n\nThe main source of Baháʼí law is the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\", but it is supplemented by some supplementary texts written by Baháʼu'lláh, as well as further interpretations by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi, heads of the religion after Baháʼu'lláh's death, as well as legislation by the Universal House of Justice, the international governing body of the Baháʼís. The writings of Baháʼu'lláh, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi are considered fundamental and unchangeable, while the application of some of them depends on decisions by the Universal House of Justice. Legislation by the Universal House of Justice is seen as subsidiary and is subject to alteration and/or repeal by the Universal House of Justice to account for changing circumstances. The laws written by the Báb are not applicable, except when Baháʼu'lláh specifically reiterated them.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh stated that the ordinances of his book of laws was the best method for the maintenance of world order and security, and that Baháʼís should obey the laws with \"joy and gladness\", and that true liberty could be obtained by obedience to the laws.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh stated that the observance of the laws that he prescribed should be subject to \"tact and wisdom\", and that they do not cause \"disturbance and dissension.\" Baháʼu'lláh thus provided for the progressive application of his laws; for example certain Baháʼí laws are only applicable to Middle Eastern Baháʼís such as the limit to the period of engagement, while any Baháʼí may practice the laws if they so decide. Other Baháʼí laws such as the prohibition to drink alcohol have also been applied gradually in countries where it goes against social norms, and for which most Baháʼís are new to the religion. Shoghi Effendi also stated that certain other laws, such as criminal laws, that are dependent upon the existence of a predominantly Baháʼí society would only be applicable in a possible future Baháʼí society. He also stated that if the laws were in conflict with the civil law of the country where a Baháʼí lives the laws could not be practiced. Furthermore, some laws and teachings are, according to Baháʼí teaching, not meant to be applied at the present time and their application depends on decisions by the Universal House of Justice.\n\nIn Baháʼí literature the laws are not seen as a constricting code, or a ritual, but are described as the \"choice wine\", and a means to happiness.\nThe laws are generally presented as a set of general principles and guidelines which each individual Baháʼí must apply to their own lives as they see fit. Baháʼí law and teachings do not include details on many aspects of life, and the successive heads of the religion have been reluctant to prescribe specific and detailed codes of Baháʼí behaviour; for example the heads of the religion have stated that details of Baháʼí behaviour, such as how to dress, are a matter of individual choice and not Baháʼí law. This is in contrast to the provisions of Islamic law.\n\nThe practice of Baháʼí law is firmly placed on individual conscience, understanding and reasoning. The Baháʼí laws are not considered as binding to anyone until they become a Baháʼí, and becoming a Baháʼí is not conditional on a person's level of adherence to the laws; an individual is expected to gradually apply laws on a personal basis. Baháʼís are expected to follow the laws not because they will be punished for breaking them, but instead because they love Baháʼu'lláh and that they fear God. The teachings of the Baháʼí Faith state that individuals are answerable to God. The observance of personal laws, such as prayer or fasting, is the sole responsibility of the individual, but some laws may be enforced to a degree by Baháʼí institutions, by the loss of Baháʼí administrative rights, if they bring the Baháʼí community into public disrepute.\n\nThe \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\" goes over both religious and civil laws such as the recitation of a daily obligatory prayer, the time of fasting, the laws of inheritance, the abolishment of priests, the prohibition of such things as slavery, asceticism, and gambling, the condemnation of such things as idleness and backbiting, the specification of punishments for such things as murder and arson, the stating of the requirement of each person to practice a profession, and the emphasis for the necessity of the education of children, as well as the need to strictly obey the government of one's country. Baháʼu'lláh also writes about general principles including statements telling his followers to work with people of all religions with amity, and warns his followers to guard against such things as fanaticism and pride. He also encourages such things as cleanliness and truthfulness.\n\nThe act of prayer is one of the most important Baháʼí laws for individual discipline and Baháʼí are enjoined to pray daily. Prayer in the Baháʼí Faith consists of two distinct types, obligatory prayer and devotional (general) prayer. The purpose of prayer in the Baháʼí Faith is to get closer to God and to Baháʼu'lláh and to help better one's own conduct and to request divine assistance.\n\nBaháʼís must individually recite an obligatory prayer each day, using fixed words and form prescribed by Baháʼu'lláh. Obligatory prayer is performed individually while facing the Qiblih, preceded by ablutions. Certain exemptions from obligatory prayer are given to those who are ill, in danger, and women in their courses.\n\nIn addition to the daily obligatory prayer, Baháʼí scripture directs believers daily to offer devotional prayer as well as to meditate and study sacred scripture. In contrast with the fixed form prescribed for obligatory prayers, there is no set form for devotions and meditations, though the devotional prayers written by the central figures of the Baháʼí Faith and collected in prayer books are held in high esteem.\n\nThe Baháʼí fast is a nineteen-day period of the year, during which Baháʼí are asked adhere to a sunrise-to-sunset fast. Along with obligatory prayer, it is one of the greatest obligations of a Baháʼí, and its chief purpose is spiritual; to reinvigorate the soul and bring the person closer to God.\n\nDuring the period of fasting, from March 2 through March 20, Baháʼís in good health between the ages of 15 and 70 abstain from eating and drinking. Exemptions are available for people who are travelling, ill, pregnant, nursing, menstruating, or engaged in heavy labour. Fasting is an individual spiritual obligation, and cannot be enforced by Baháʼí institutions.\n\nThe Baháʼí teachings recommend marriage, but it is not obligatory. Marriage is emphasized as an assistance to one's self, as well as for the benefit of society; it is seen as both a physical relationship and a spiritual relationship that would continue in all the worlds of God.\n\nThe requirements of Baháʼí marriage include that the partners be over the age of 15, and is dependent on the consent of the couple and all their living biological parents, so to strengthen the ties between the families. According to the Baháʼí teachings, sexuality is a normal part of married life and is intended to enhance the relationship. However, sexual relationships are permitted only between a man and woman who are married. This precludes marriages that are homosexual or polygamous as well as any sexual relationship outside of marriage. Interreligious marriages are permitted, and interracial marriages are encouraged. Divorce is permitted, although discouraged, and is granted after a year of separation if the couple is unable to reconcile their differences.\n\nThe Baháʼí teachings state that parents need to raise their children to be moral and religious, but not fanatical. Parents are required to provide an education to their children, and children have a duty to obey their parents, which is seen as obeying God. Shoghi Effendi stated that preserving family unity is of utmost importance, and Baháʼís are counselled to balance their desire to serve the religion with their responsibilities as parents, spouses and children.\n\nIn the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\", Baháʼu'lláh wrote that all Baháʼís must write a will where they have complete freedom in determining how to dispose of their property. Baháʼu'lláh, however, did create a schedule of inheritance in case of intestacy, that is, when the individual dies without leaving a will. The system of inheritance in the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\" is based on the provisions written by the Báb and provides for distribution of the deceased's estate among seven categories of heirs.: children, spouse, father, mother, brothers, sisters, and teachers, with higher categories obtaining a larger share. In cases where some of the categories of heirs do not exist, the share falls partly to the children and partly to the Local Spiritual Assembly. The distribution among heirs is uneven: children receive nine parts; the spouse receives eight; the father, seven; the mother, six; the brothers, five; the sisters, four; and the teachers, three.\n\nGossip and backbiting are prohibited and viewed as particularly damaging to the individual and their relationships. Backbiting, speaking of the faults of others in their absence, is described as the greatest sin and the most hated human characteristic. This practice is seen as having a deeply negative effect on the community as well as the individuals involved.\n\nBaháʼís are forbidden to drink alcohol or to take drugs, except by a doctor's order. The reason being that God has given human beings reason and intoxicants take that away and lead the mind astray. The non-medicinal use of opium and other mind-altering drugs are particularly condemned in the Baháʼí scriptures. Baháʼís are also asked to try to avoid working in jobs that involve the manufacturing or large-scale sale of alcohol and avoid any involvement in the drug trade. Smoking tobacco is not forbidden but is discouraged.\n\nHuqúqu'lláh, the \"Right of God\", is a law which requires Baháʼís to pay 19% of their surplus net-worth (i.e. those things that they do not need to live comfortably), after the discharge of all debts. The sum is calculated annually; however, it is paid only if the annual net worth amount increases - if their net worth stays the same or decreases the amount of Huqúqu'lláh is zero.\n\nPayment is an individual spiritual obligation, and is seen as a spiritual bounty to bring the individual closer to God. No Baháʼí can be solicited for it, and the contribution is confidential and a personal matter. The money collected is used by the Universal House of Justice for such things as the promotion of the religion, the upkeep of properties, and general charity.\n\nBaháʼís are also expected to make financial contributions to Baháʼí funds. However, contributions are strictly confidential, including whether or not a believer makes one, and is up to individual discretion. Donations are never solicited, and contributions are not accepted from non-Baháʼí sources.\n\nOther laws that have been prescribed in the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\" include:\n\nProhibitions included in the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\" include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Many products offered under Walmart brands are private label products, but in other cases, the production volume is enough for Walmart to operate an entire factory.\n\nIn March 2018, to better compete with Amazon and Target, Walmart introduced three new clothing lines and revamped an existing clothing line.\n\n\nSam's Choice, originally introduced as Sam's American Choice in 1991, is a retail brand in food and selected hard goods. Named after Sam Walton, founder of Walmart, Sam's Choice forms the premium tier of Walmart's two-tiered core corporate grocery branding strategy that also includes the larger Great Value brand of discount-priced staple items.\n\nCompared to Great Value products and to other national brands, Sam's Choice is positioned as a premium retail brand and is offered at a price competitive with standard national brands. It typically offers either competitive items in a given product category, or items in categories where the market leader is an \"icon\" (for example, Coca-Cola in the soft drink category).\n\nMost Sam's Choice beverage products (excluding Grapette and Orangette) are manufactured for Walmart by Cott Beverages. Other products in the line, including cookies, snack items, frozen meals, and similar grocery items are made by a variety of agricultural and food manufacturers.\n\nCompetitive pricing of the Sam's Choice brand and store-branded and generic goods is possible because of the lower expense required to market a retail chain's house brand, compared to advertising and promotional expenses typically incurred by the national brands.\n\nMost Sam's Choice-branded products have been replaced by either the relaunched Great Value brand, or the new Marketside brand. The brand was reintroduced in 2013 with a new logo and a focus on premium food products with organic ingredients.\n\nAdventure Force\n\nAdventure Force – toys suitable for outdoor use. Products include waterarms (water blaster guns).\n\nGreat Value was launched in 1993 (but products were made as early as 1992) and forms the second tier, or national brand equivalent (\"NBE\"), of Walmart's grocery branding strategy.\n\nProducts offered through the Great Value brand are often claimed to be as good as national brand offerings, but are typically sold at a lower price because of lower marketing and advertising expense. As a house or store brand, the Great Value line does not consist of goods produced by Walmart, but is a labeling system for items manufactured and packaged by a number of agricultural and food corporations, such as ConAgra, and Sara Lee which, in addition to releasing products under its own brands and exclusively for Walmart, also manufactures and brands foods for a variety of other chain stores. Often, this labeling system, to the dismay of consumers, does not list location of manufacture of the product. Walmart contends that all Great Value products are produced in the United States. Otherwise, the country of origin would be listed.\n\nAs Walmart's most extensively developed retail brand, covering hundreds of household consumable items, the Great Value line includes sliced bread, frozen vegetables, frozen dinners, canned foods, light bulbs, trash bags, buttermilk biscuits, cinnamon rolls, pies, and many other traditional grocery store products. The wide range of items marketed under the Great Value banner makes it Walmart's top-selling retail brand.\n\nThe Great Value brand can also be seen in Canada, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Brazil and some Trust Mart stores in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China, through a partnership with Walmart. Bharti EasyDay retail grocery stores sell Great Value brand products in India as well. Great Value brand products as well as Walmart merchandise are also present in Seiyu grocery stores (owned by Walmart) in Tokyo, Japan as of October 2014, despite at least one report of a transition away from the brand.\n\nBy mid-summer 2009, Walmart had redesigned the Great Value labels to be predominantly white. The new redesign also includes over 80 new items, including thin-crust pizza, fat-free caramel swirl ice cream, strawberry yogurt, organic cage-free eggs, double-stuffed sandwich cookies, and teriyaki beef jerky. Walmart changed the formulas for 750 items, including: breakfast cereal, cookies, yogurt, laundry detergent, and paper towels. The new brand was tested by over 2,700 people.\n\nGreat Value went through another redesign in 2013 for most of its food items, replacing predominantly white designs with more colorful packaging. \n\nEquate – consumable pharmacy and health and beauty items, such as shaving cream, skin lotion, over-the-counter medications, and pregnancy tests. Before its takeover by Walmart, the formerly independent Equate brand sold consumer products at both Target and Walmart at lower prices than those of name brands. Equate is an example of the strength of Walmart's private label store brand. In a 2006 study, The Hartman Group marketing research firm issued a report which found that \"Five of the top 10 \"likely to purchase\" private label brands are managed by Walmart including: Great Value, Equate, Sam's Choice, Walmart, and Member's Mark (Sam's Club), per the study.\" The report further noted that \"...we are struck by the magnitude of mind-share Walmart appears to hold in shoppers' minds when it comes to awareness of private label brands and retailers.\"\n\nIn mid-2010, the brand underwent a logo redesign, as well as packaging changes similar to the Great Value brand.\n\nMainstays is a brand marketed by Walmart for its lower-priced lines of bedding, kitchen utensils, ready-to-assemble furniture, and home decor.\n\nOl' Roy is Walmart's store brand of dog food, created in 1983 and named after Sam Walton's bird dog. It has become the number-one selling brand of dog food in the United States. It is comparable to Nestlé's Purina.\n\nIn 1998, samples of Ol' Roy (together with various other brands) were subject to qualitative analyses for pentobarbital residue by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Veterinary Medicine due to suspicion that the anesthetizing drug may have found its way into pet foods through euthanized animals, including cats and dogs. DNA tests for all the samples detected cat and dog DNA and multiple Ol' Roy samples tested positive for the drug, presumably from rendered cattle, as well as cats and dogs. The CVM has said that due to the level of exposure, the risk of adverse effects was substantial.\n\nSpecial Kitty is Walmart's store brand of cat food and other cat care products, such as litter and treats.\n\nParent's Choice is Walmart's store brand; including diapers, formula, and accessories. Like other Walmart store brands, its design and packaging was relaunched in 2010. Parent's Choice is manufactured by Wyeth (a pharmaceutical company). On October 15, 2009, Pfizer signed the final acquisition papers making Wyeth a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer, thus completing the US$68 billion dollar deal.\n\nPlay Day is a wide-ranging brand of budget-priced children's toys. Play Day launched in between mid-2014 and early-2015, as a replacement brand for Kid Connection. .\n\nPen+Gear is Walmart's store brand for school and office supplies. From notebooks, pens, markers, paper, binders, pencils and even paper shredders. Pen+Gear replaced a former brand name Casemate in late 2016. Casemate was the same purpose of school and office supplies, but they found a different name for the brand in late 2016.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2236730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236730", "title": "Kitchen cabinet", "text": "Kitchen cabinet\n\nKitchen cabinets are the built-in furniture installed in many kitchens for storage of food, cooking equipment, and often silverware and dishes for table service. Appliances such as refrigerators, dishwashers, and ovens are often integrated into kitchen cabinetry. There are many options for cabinets available at present.\n\nAs commonly used today, the term \"kitchen cabinet\" denotes a built-in kitchen installation of either a floor or a wall cabinet. Typically, multiple floor cabinets are covered by a single counter and floors and walls are not accessible behind and under the cabinets. Kitchen cabinets \"per se\" were invented in the 20th century. A precursor, not built-in, was the Hoosier cabinet of the 1910s, a single piece of furniture incorporating storage and work surfaces, of which over 2 million were sold by 1920.\n\n\nConsidering that North Americans spend a large proportion of their lives indoors, it’s clear why this is a key issue in designing healthy spaces. Additionally, air quality is not a stand-alone problem; rather, every other component of the home can affect air quality. Air quality can be compromised by off-gassing from cabinetry, countertops, flooring, wall coverings or fabrics; by cooking by-products released into the air, and by mold caused by excess moisture or poor ventilation.\n\n\nCabinets consist of six-sided wooden boxes or \"carcases\" closed on five sides with a door or drawers on the sixth.\n\n\n\nCabinets may be either face-frame or frameless in construction. Each option provides features and drawbacks.\n\n\n\n\nCabinet doors may feature a variety of materials such as wood, metal or glass. Wood may be solid wood (\"breadboard\" construction) or engineered wood or may be mixed (e.g. engineered wood panel in a solid wood frame)\n\nA functional design objective for cabinet interiors involves maximization of useful space and utility in the context of the kitchen workflow. Drawers and trays in lower cabinets permit access from above and avoid uncomfortable or painful crouching.\n\nIn face-frame construction, a drawer or tray must clear the face-frame stile and is narrower than the available cabinet interior space. The loss of 2 inches is particularly noticeable and significant for kitchens including multiple narrow [ or less] cabinets.\n\nIn frameless construction, drawer boxes may be sized nearly to the interior opening of the cabinet providing better use of the available space.\n\nHowever, the same is not true for trays. Even in the case of frameless construction doors and their hinges when open block a portion of the interior cabinet width. Since trays are mounted behind the door, trays are typically significantly narrower than drawers. Special hinges are available that can permit trays of similar width as drawers but they have not come into wide use.\n\nShelves provide in all cases more storage space than drawers or trays, but are less accessible.\n\nStock wall-oven cabinets may be adapted to built-in ovens, coffee-makers, or other appliances by removing portions of the cabinet and adding trim panels to achieve a flush installation.\n\nFrameless cabinets provide for wall oven front panel widths equal to the cabinet width (see above). In such an installation the oven front panel occupies a similar profile as a cabinet door. Accordingly, frameless installations for wall-oven make most efficient use of the available wall space in a kitchen.\n\nThis effect is difficult to achieve in typical face-frame cabinet installations, as it requires modification to the face-frame (essentially eliminating the face-frame at the oven cut-out).\n\nCabinets may be finished with opaque paint, opaque lacquer and transparent finishes such as lacquer or varnish. Decorative finishes include distressing, glazing, and toning. The choice of finish can affect the cabinet's color, sheen (from flat to high gloss), and feel.\n\n\nHardware is the term used for metal fittings incorporated into a cabinet extraneous of the wood or engineered wood substitute and the countertop. The most basic hardware consists of hinges and drawer/door pulls, although only hinges are an absolute necessity for a cabinet since pulls can be fashioned of wood or plastic, and drawer slides were traditionally fashioned of wood. In a modern kitchen it is highly unusual to use wood for a drawer slides owing to the much superior quality of metal drawer slides/sides.\n\nDrawers and trays make it easier to access a cabinet's contents. They are a substantial benefit because they reduce bending and squatting. The only drawback is slightly less usable space which is taken up by the slides as well as door clearances. A typical drawer is narrower than a comparable shelf. A drawer can usually hold about 75 to 100 lbs for ordinary use. Using slides, mounted on the side (reducing width slightly) or bottom (completely out of sight), a drawer or tray can be extended considerably with a smooth, linear motion using minimum effort.\n\nDrawer \"extension\" is the exposed proportion of a fully extended drawer. Traditional drawers with wood-on-wood runners can only be extended about three-quarters; however, modern runners enable full-extension drawers. A slide's design parameters are its height, depth, extension, weight rating, durability, serviceability, and smoothness of operation. \n\nNew varieties of hinges and slides have been developed that enhance the action and usability of doors and drawers. \n\n\nThere is a large variety of specialty hardware for kitchen cabinets. Special hardware for corner and other blind cabinets makes their contents more easily accessible. They may be in the form of lazy susans with or without a wedge cut out or of tray slides which enable the hidden corner space to be occupied with trays that slide both laterally and forwards/backwards. Sponge drawers use special hinges that fit between the cabinet front and the sink.\n\nBefore buying cabinets, precise measurements are essential otherwise there may be un-utilized space, cabinets may not fit, or there may be interference between various elements of the kitchen, such as doors and drawers. Note that European cabinets typically have different sizes than ones in North America, and are typically built in multiples of 100mm, with 600mm wide being a common size.\n\nBuyers can buy pre-built \"stock\" cabinets for fast delivery which usually arrive in a week or less. In contrast, custom-made cabinets can have longer delivery times, such as four weeks.\n\nCabinet dimensions are specified with width first, height second, depth last. The width–height–depth is a generally accepted convention. A 18x36x12 cabinet is therefore wide, tall, and deep. Sometimes upper cabinets are presumed to be deep, so only the width and height are given. For example, a \"W1836\" label means wall-mounted cabinet [ deep] is wide and high.\n\nCustom cabinetry, while expensive, can fit the available space attractively, and can fit into walls which aren't exactly flat or straight. They can combine more than one opening and eliminate unsightly doubled stiles in face-frame installations as well as bring aesthetic appeal using unusual woods or finishes. Custom cabinets sometimes offer inset cabinet doors, and can match existing or period furniture styles. It's sometimes possible to mix custom and stock cabinetry which have identical finishes.\n\nCabinets can be purchased from specialty retailers, kitchen remodelers, home centers, on-line retailers, and ready-to-assemble furniture manufacturers. Some installers offer a package deal from measurement, to construction, to installation.\n\nCabinets are sometimes delivered in fully assembled form. Carcasses should be inspected carefully before installation, since defects are difficult to repair after installation. Ready-to-assemble furniture cabinets are lower-in-cost and are delivered in a flat box. Some courses teach homeowners how to build their own cabinets.\n\nSince kitchens are rooms for food preparation, cabinets which store food should be kept clean with cloth microfiber or feather dusters. Tough grease stains and coarse dirt can be removed with warm water and a grease solvent, then wiped clean with a plain cotton cloth. Window cleaners and clean cloths can be used with a microfiber cloth to clean up.\n\n"}

Dr John Jefferson Bray, (16 September 1912 – 26 June 1995) was an Australian lawyer, judge, academic, university administrator, Crown officer, and published poet, who, from 1967 to 1978, served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of South Australia.\n\nDr Bray was born in Adelaide, South Australia, the elder son of Harry Midwinter Bray (1879–1965), an Adelaide stockbroker, and his wife, Gertrude Eleanore Stow (members of whose family were Congregationalist missionaries in South Australia). His father's family had a history of involvement in South Australian politics and current affairs: Bray's grandfather was the Honourable Sir John Cox Bray, a former Premier of South Australia. On his mother's side, Bray claimed a collateral relationship to the third U.S. president, Thomas Jefferson.\n\nBray was educated at the state school at Sevenhill in the Clare Valley; at St Peter's College, Adelaide; and at the University of Adelaide, where he earned a B.A. in 1932, an LL.B.(Hons.) in 1933 and an LL.D. in 1937. He was granted an Honorary Doctorate in 1983.\n\nBray trained as a lawyer and was admitted to the South Australian Bar in 1933. He was acting lecturer in jurisprudence at the University of Adelaide for the years 1941, 1943, 1945, and 1951. He was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1957. He served as a lecturer in Legal History at the University of Adelaide from 1957–1958, and then as a lecturer in Roman Law from 1959 until 1966. He was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of South Australia on 28 February 1967 and served until his retirement from the judiciary on 28 November 1978. Bray was appointed Chancellor of the University of Adelaide in 1968. He also served as Deputy to the Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia from 1968 until retirement.\n\nBray was an active member of the Libraries Board of South Australia between 1944 and 1989. He was closely involved with the organisation of the early Adelaide Festival of Arts Writers' Weeks. (His first volume of poetry was launched at the second Writers' Week in 1962.)\n\nBray was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1979, and is said, by his younger brother, Dr Robert Stow Bray, to have refused a knighthood. He described his views as \"æsthetic - traditional; social - emancipated; political - fluctuating\" and his philosophies as \"sceptical, some tendencies to Platonism\".\n\nThe John Jefferson Bray Memorial Fountain in Hurtle Square, Adelaide, was commissioned by the Adelaide City Council in 1994.\n\nThe John Bray Poetry Award, awarded biennially as part of the Adelaide Festival, was so named to honour his distinguished services to Australian poetry.\n\nBray's publications reflected his interests which he listed as \"poetry, history, classics\":\n\nHe was also joint-editor for \"No. 7 Friendly Street Poetry Reader\" (Adelaide University Press, 1977, and 1978).\n\nHe also made contributions to:\n\n\n"}

It was also attended by George Michael (formerly of Wham), Steve Nardelli founding member of The Syn who played their first ever show at the school in 1965, 1980's group Osibisa, founding members of the popular music group Sugababes and jazz saxophonist Courtney Pine.\n\nKingsbury County Grammar School was established on 15 September 1925 as Kingsbury County School. Prior to the establishment of the school the area had been served by a number of schools, which, in keeping with the future history of Kingsbury County School, had been subject to the prevailing changes in population and politics of the area.\nAlthough there are reports of a school being kept in the area in c. 1530, by John Bishop the curate of Kingsbury, there is no more evidence until the nineteenth century of schooling in Kingsbury. Schooling is mentioned in 1819, and in 1822 a day school was opened. This school was situated near the junction of Kingsbury Road and Roe Green, which itself is looked at open by the current Kingsbury High School. This school has closed by 1876. Other schools existed in the area as well, with nearly all children in Kingsbury said to attend one school or another by 1847. Kingsbury School Board was set up in 1875 following a damning report as to the cramped premises of the British School at the Hyde end of Kingsbury Road, itself an 1870 replacement of an infants' school that had been built in 1861 to the Congregational chapel in Edgware Road. Kingsbury Board School on Kingsbury Road, opened by the Kingsbury School Board in 1876, was to accommodate 130 pupils. In 1903 this became Kingsbury Council School. In 1922 this became the first senior mixed school in the area after its infants had been transferred to the new Kenton Lane Council School in 1922. This school operated as a junior school after 1928 until it was bombed in the Second World War.\n\nWhen Kingsbury County School was opened in 1925, it was originally housed in a building which once belonged to the Aircraft Manufacturing Company, (or Airco as it was also known) on the Edgware Road opposite Colindale Avenue (now a Jewish school). The building had been adapted to take 380 pupils. The first headmaster was Mr Tracy, who had a staff of eight teachers, five full-time and three part-time. As the population of the surrounding area increased owing to the influx of workers to the aircraft industry, so did the roll of the school, and in 1929 a new school was built in Princes Avenue by John Laing and Co. at a cost of cost £43,638.\n\nWhen the United Kingdom Government passed the Butler Education Act in 1944 a Tripartite System was established dividing secondary schools into three categories, grammar schools, technical schools and secondary modern schools. The grammar school was deemed the place of education for the academically gifted (as determined by the 11-plus) and Kingsbury County School was selected to become the grammar school at which point the school changed its name to Kingsbury County Grammar School. The headmaster, Dr Payling (who had succeeded Mr Tracy after his retirement in 1949), saw the beginning of extensions in 1954.\n\nAt this point in time, Kingsbury was also being served by a second mixed secondary school, which was chosen to become the area's secondary modern school after the 1944 Act was passed. The increase in the population of Kingsbury had continued unabated and building had started on a second mixed secondary school at a site in Bacon Lane in 1939 but this was not finished, mainly to do with constraints placed in the continuation of the building by the Second World War. In the meantime, Kingsbury Secondary Modern School began operating from the converted ex-Airco building, which had been vacated by Kingsbury County School in 1931. In 1952, what were to be Tyler's Croft county secondary schools, were opened as separate boys' and girls' secondary modern schools, and the pupils from the mixed Kingsbury Secondary Modern School were transferred to the new schools on Bacon Lane.\n\nIn 1967 with the local authority Brent Borough Council having adopted the comprehensive system of education, Kingsbury County Grammar and the two Tyler's Croft schools were amalgamated to form the giant Kingsbury High School.\n\nMr Jones, who had succeeded Dr Payling back in 1954, faced the task of managing the school's transition from being a grammar school to a comprehensive school. The Bacon Lane site was designated by the head as the Lower School under the management of a Head of Lower School, with the buildings of the former Kingsbury County Grammar to be used for the upper years. Three years after this huge reorganisation Mr Jones retired and the governors appointed Mr C. Mitchell in 1970. Mr Mitchell served 18 years as Headmaster and was responsible for a series of important developments. In Mr Mitchell's era, the ethnic makeup of Kingsbury began to change with the growth of a large Asian community. In this time the school roll increased to 1750 and the proportion of ethnic minority children in the school increased apace. After Mr Mitchell retired in 1988, the former head of neighbouring Preston Manor High School, Philip Snell, was appointed to succeed as Headmaster.\n\nIn 1993 a majority of parents voted for the school to gain grant maintained status which meant that the school was to benefit financially with an expanding budget and was also able to take control of its own admissions. During the subsequent period the school's reputation from computing also began to grow and flourish. This has been attributed largely to Mr Snell's interest in curricular advances and new information technology and the resultant building of the first computer based Open Learning Centre in Princes Avenue with a special link for weather forecasting. When the Queen, chose the school for her launch of the royal web site this both enhanced and highlighted the school's reputation for computing excellence.\n\nMr Snell retired in 2003 and was succeeded by the previous head, Mr C. Chung, who, in common with a number of his predecessors, is a former teacher of the school. The school currently takes on more than 300 pupils a year culminating in just under 2,000 pupils (including sixth form).\n\nIn 2014, the school was determined Good, by inspecting body Ofsted. In 2018, they were again inspected and this status was reconfirmed. The full report can be found on the ofsted website.\n\nThe school's motto, \"Spectemur agendo\" (meaning Let us be Judged by our actions) has remained consistent from the school's foundation being that of the original Kingsbury County School in 1925. The badge has altered over time although there are still elements of consistency. Both the original and current badges have a crown in the centre of the badge. The original badge had the crown sitting atop three drawn sabres arranged horizontally on top of each other, reducing in size from top to bottom. The current badge has the crown sitting atop a triangle which has replaced the sabres but is representative of the shape the sabres formed. The current badge has also lost the top portion of the original badge which represented two turrets of a battlement.\n\nThis is the current badge, updated in 2018. The colours have been slightly adjusted with a few colour refinements to make it look more modern.\n\n\nThere were also notable alumni from the previous schools, including:\n\n"}
{"id": "2236757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236757", "title": "Dawenkou culture", "text": "Dawenkou culture\n\nThe Dawenkou culture is a name given by archaeologists to a group of Neolithic communities who lived primarily in Shandong, but also appeared in Anhui, Henan and Jiangsu, China. The culture existed from 4100 to 2600 BC, co-existing with the Yangshao culture. Turquoise, jade and ivory artefacts are commonly found at Dawenkou sites. The earliest examples of alligator drums appear at Dawenkou sites. Neolithic signs, perhaps related to subsequent scripts, such as those of the Shang Dynasty, have been found on Dawenkou pottery.\n\nArchaeologists commonly divide the culture into three phases: the early phase (4100–3500 BC), the middle phase (3500–3000 BC) and the late phase (3000–2600 BC). Based on the evidence from grave goods, the early phase was highly egalitarian. The phase is typified by the presence of individually designed, long-stemmed cups (鬹 \"guī\"). Graves built with earthen ledges became increasingly common during the latter parts of the early phase. During the middle phase, grave goods began to emphasize quantity over diversity. During the late phase, wooden coffins began to appear in Dawenkou burials. The culture became increasingly stratified, as some graves contained no grave goods while others contained a large quantity of grave goods.\n\nThe type site at Dawenkou, located in Tai'an, Shandong, was excavated in 1959, 1974 and 1978. Only the middle layer at Dawenkou is associated with the Dawenkou culture, as the earliest layer corresponds to the Beixin culture and the latest layer corresponds to the early Shandong variant of the Longshan culture. The Dawenkou interacted extensively with the Yangshao culture. \"For two and a half millennia of its existence the Dawenkou was, however, in a dynamic interchange with the Yangshao Culture, in which process of interaction it sometimes had the lead role, notably in generating Longshan. Scholars have also noted similarities between the Dawenkou and the Liangzhu culture as well as the related cultures of the Yantze River basin. According to some scholars, the Dawenkou culture may have a link with a pre-Austronesian language.<ref name=\"https://www.academia.edu/3077307/The_expansion_of_Setaria_farmers_in_East_Asia\"></ref> Other researchers also note a similarity between Dawenkou inhabitants and modern Austronesian people in cultural practices such as tooth avulsion and architecture.\n\nThe physical similarity of the Jiahu people to the later Dawenkou (2600 BC±4300 BC) indicates that the Dawenkou might have descended from the Jiahu, following a slow migration along the middle and lower reaches of the Huai river and the Hanshui valley. Other scholars have also speculated that the Dawenkou originate in nearby regions to the south. The Dawenkou culture descends from the Beixin culture, but is deeply influenced by the northward expanding Longqiuzhuang culture located between the Yangtze and Huai rivers.\n\nThe people of Dawenkou exhibited a primarily Sinodont dental pattern. The Dawenkou were also physically dissimilar to the neolithic inhabitants of Hemudu, Southern China and Taiwan.\n\nThe term \"chiefdom\" seems to be appropriate in describe the political organization of the Dawenkou. A dominant kin group likely held sway over Dawenkou village sites, though power was most likely manifested through religious authority rather than coercion. Unlike the Beixin culture from which they descend, the people of the Dawenkou culture were noted for being engaged in violent conflict. Scholars suspect that they may have engaged in raids for land, crops, livestock and prestige goods.\n\nThe warm and wet climate of the Dawenkou area was suitable for a variety of crops, though they primarily farmed millet at most sites. Their production of millet was quite successful and storage containers have been found that could have contained up to 2000 kg of millet, once decomposition is accounted for, have been found. For some of the southern Dawenkou sites, rice was a more important crop however, especially during the late Dawenkou period. Analysis done on human remains at Dawenkou sites in southern Shandong revealed that the diet of upper-class Dawenkou individuals consisted mainly of rice, while ordinary individuals ate primarily millet. The Dawenkou successfully domesticated chicken, dogs, pigs and cattle, but no evidence of horse domestication was found. Pig remains are by far most abundant, accounting for about 85% of the total, and are thought to be the most important domesticated animal. Pig remains were also found in Dawenkou burials also highlighting their importance. Seafood was also an important staple of the Dawenkou diet. Fish and various shellfish mounds have been found in the early periods indicating that they were important food sources. Although these piles became less frequent in the later stages, seafood remained an important part of the diet.\n\nDawenkou's inhabitants were the earliest practitioners of trepanation in prehistoric China. A skull of a Dawenkou man dating to 3000 BC was found with severe head injuries which appeared to have been remedied by this primitive surgery.\n\n\n"}

It merges with the New River to form the Kanawha River, a tributary of the Ohio River. The river features numerous recreational whitewater areas, including those in Gauley River National Recreation Area downstream of the Summersville Dam.\n\nThe Gauley rises in the Monongahela National Forest on Gauley Mountain in Pocahontas County as three streams, the North, Middle, and South Forks, each of which flows across the southern extremity of Randolph County; they converge in Webster County. The river then flows generally west-southwestwardly through Webster, Nicholas and Fayette counties, past the towns of Camden-on-Gauley and Summersville, to the town of Gauley Bridge, where it joins the New River to form the Kanawha River. Via the Kanawha and Ohio rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed.\n\nThe Gauley's largest tributaries all flow into the main river from the east (flowing in a westerly direction) and are described as follows:\n\n\nIn Nicholas County, the Gauley is impounded by the Summersville Dam, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam, to form Summersville Lake. The Gauley River National Recreation Area is downstream of the dam.\n\nThe Gauley is run year-round by recreational boaters and from spring to fall by commercial rafting companies. During the majority of the year, boating is dependent on water level, which fluctuates dramatically depending on rainfall and the level of Summersville Lake. However, starting the Friday after Labor Day, the Army Corps of Engineers provides a series of twenty-two controlled releases for the express purpose of downriver recreation. These releases are collectively known as \"Gauley Season\" and are scheduled on six successive weekends, the first five of which are four-day weekends (Friday through Monday) and the last of which is just Saturday and Sunday. Typical release levels during \"Gauley Season\" range from 2,400 to 2,800 ft³/s (68 to 79 m³/s).\n\nThese releases are the result of an act of the U.S. Congress, the first law passed in the U.S. to specifically mandate recreational whitewater dam releases. The releases bring millions of dollars annually to the local economy, as paddlers travel from all over the United States and overseas for this event.\n\nThe Gauley area was the site of the Battle of Carnifex Ferry on September 10, 1861, a Union victory in the American Civil War.\n\nThe Gauley River's name most likely is derived from Gaul (literally \"river of the \"Gauls\"\"), a historical region of Europe including most of current day France, from the time when West Virginia was part of New France before the French and Indian War.\n\nHistorically, the river has had various Indian names, variant spellings of Gaul/Gauley as well as Falling/Falls Creek.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2236780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236780", "title": "Aedes aegypti", "text": "Aedes aegypti\n\nAedes aegypti, the yellow fever mosquito, is a mosquito that can spread dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika fever, Mayaro and yellow fever viruses, and other disease agents. The mosquito can be recognized by white markings on its legs and a marking in the form of a lyre on the upper surface of its thorax. This mosquito originated in Africa, but is now found in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions throughout the world.\n\n\"Aedes aegypti\" is a vector for transmitting several tropical fevers. Only the female bites for blood, which she needs to mature her eggs. To find a host, these mosquitoes are attracted to chemical compounds emitted by mammals, including ammonia, carbon dioxide, lactic acid, and octenol. Scientists at The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service have studied the specific chemical structure of octenol to better understand why this chemical attracts the mosquito to its host. They found the mosquito has a preference for \"right-handed\" (dextrorotatory) octenol molecules.\n\nThe yellow fever mosquito can also contribute to the spread of reticular cell sarcoma among Syrian hamsters.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traveler's page on preventing dengue fever suggests using mosquito repellents that contain DEET (N, N-diethylmetatoluamide, 20% to 30%). It also suggests:\n\n\nInsect repellents containing DEET (particularly concentrated products) or \"p\"-menthane-3,8-diol (from lemon eucalyptus) were effective in repelling \"Ae. aegypti\" mosquitoes, while others were less effective or ineffective in a scientific study. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention article on \"Protection against Mosquitoes, Ticks, & Other Arthropods\" notes that \"Studies suggest that concentrations of DEET above approximately 50% do not offer a marked increase in protection time against mosquitoes; DEET efficacy tends to plateau at a concentration of approximately 50%\". Other insect repellents recommended by the CDC include Picaridin (KBR 3023/icaridin), IR3535, and 2-undecanone.\n\nMosquito control is currently the best method for disease prevention. This primarily includes source reduction, pesticide spraying for larval control and \"fogging\" for adult control, or the use of mosquito traps like the lethal ovitrap.\n\nAlthough the lifespan of an adult \"Ae. aegypti\" is two to four weeks depending on conditions, the eggs can be viable for over a year in a dry state, which allows the mosquito to re-emerge after a cold winter or dry spell.\n\nThe preference for biting humans is dependent on expression of the odorant receptor \"AeegOr4\".\n\nNew research is looking into the use of a bacterium called \"Wolbachia\" as a method of biocontrol. Studies show that invasion of \"Ae. aegypti\" by the endosymbiotic bacteria allows mosquitos to be resistant to the certain arboviruses such as dengue fever and Zika virus strains currently circulating.\n\nIn March 2019, a novel study finds that the electronic song \"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\" by Skrillex is effective in delaying host attack, blood feeding, and disrupting the mating process of Aedes aegypti. This reseach provides new avenues for the development of music-based personal protective and control measures for mosquitoes.\n\nThe yellow fever mosquito's distribution has increased in the past two to three decades worldwide, and it is considered to be among the most widespread mosquito species. Signs of Zika virus-capable mosquito populations have been found adapting for persistence in warm temperate climates. Such a population has been identified to exist in parts of Washington, DC, and genetic evidence suggests they survived at least the last four winters in the region. One of the study researchers noted, \" ...some mosquito species are finding ways to survive in normally restrictive environments by taking advantage of underground refugia\". As the world's climate becomes predictably warmer, the range of Aedes aegypti and a hardier species originating in Asia, the tiger mosquito \"Aedes albopictus\", which can expand its range to relatively cooler climates, will inexorably spread north and south. Sadie Ryan of the University of Florida was the lead author in a 2019 study published in \"PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases\" that estimated the vulnerability of naïve populations in geographic regions that currently do not harbor vectors i.e., for Zika in the Old World. Ryan's co-author, Georgetown University's Colin Carlson remarked,\"Plain and simple, climate change is going to kill a lot of people.\" A 2019 study published in \"Nature Microbiology\" found that accelerating urbanization and human movement would also contribute to the spread of Aedes mosquitoes.\n\n\"Ae. aegypti\" has been genetically modified to suppress its own species in an approach similar to the sterile insect technique, thereby reducing the risk of disease. The mosquitoes, known as OX513A, were developed by Oxitec, a spinout of Oxford University. Field trials in the Cayman Islands, Jacobina Brazil, and Panama have shown that the OX513A mosquitoes reduced the target mosquito populations by more than 90%. This mosquito suppression effect is achieved by a self-limiting gene that prevents the offspring from surviving. Male modified mosquitoes, which do not bite or spread disease, are released to mate with the pest females. Their offspring inherit the self-limiting gene and die before reaching adulthood—before they can reproduce or spread disease. The OX513A mosquitoes and their offspring also carry a fluorescent marker for simple monitoring. To produce more OX513A mosquitoes for control projects, the self-limiting gene is switched off (using the Tet-Off system) in the mosquito production facility using an antidote (the antibiotic tetracycline), allowing the mosquitoes to reproduce naturally. In the environment, the antidote is unavailable to rescue mosquito reproduction, so the pest population is suppressed.\n\nThe mosquito control effect is nontoxic and species-specific, as the OX513A mosquitoes are \"Ae. aegypti\" and only breed with \"Ae. aegypti\". The result of the self-limiting approach is that the released insects and their offspring die and do not persist in the environment.\n\nIn Brazil, the modified mosquitoes were approved by the National Biosecurity Technical Commission for releases throughout the country. Insects were released into the wild populations of Brazil, Malaysia, and the Cayman Islands in 2012. In July 2015, the city of Piracicaba, São Paulo, started releasing the OX513A mosquitoes. In 2015, the UK House of Lords called on the government to support more work on genetically modified insects in the interest of global health. In 2016, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted preliminary approval for the use of modified mosquitoes to prevent the spread of the Zika virus.\n\nThis approach could also be applied to control \"Aedes albopictus\" and the \"Anopheles\" mosquitoes that spread malaria.\n\nAnother proposed method consists in using radiation to sterilize male larvae so that when they mate, they produce no progeny. Male mosquitoes do not bite or spread disease.\n\nAlphabet, Inc. has started the Debug Project to infect males of this species with Wolbachia bacteria, interrupting the reproductive cycle of these animals.\n\nThe recent invention of CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing tool have significantly expanded the scope of genome editing research in Aedes aegypti mosquito. Several scientists across the globe have already attempted this technique to engineer the genome of vector mosquitoes. The genes like ECFP (enhanced cyan fluorescent protein), Nix (male-determining factor gene), Aaeg-wtrw (Ae. aegypti water witch locus), Kmo (kynurenine 3-monoxygenase), loqs (loquacious), r2d2 (r2d2 protein), ku70 (ku heterodimer protein gene) and lig4 (ligase4) were targeted to modify the genome of Aedes aegypti using CRISPR/Cas9 tool to obtain a new mutant, which will become incapable of pathogen transmission or result in population control.\n\nThe genome of this species of insect was sequenced and analyzed by a consortium including scientists at The Institute for Genomic Research (now part of the J. Craig Venter Institute), the European Bioinformatics Institute, the Broad Institute, and the University of Notre Dame, and published in 2007. The effort in sequencing its DNA was intended to provide new avenues for research into insecticides and possible genetic modification to prevent the spread of virus. This was the second mosquito species to have its genome sequenced in full (the first was \"Anopheles gambiae\"). The published data included the 1.38 billion base pairs containing the insect's estimated 15,419 protein-encoding genes. The sequence indicates the species diverged from \"Drosophila melanogaster\" (the common fruit fly) about , and \"Anopheles gambiae\" and this species diverged about .\n\nThe species was first named (as \"Culex aegypti\") in 1757 by Fredric Hasselquist in his treatise '. Hasselquist was provided with the names and descriptions by his mentor, Carl Linnaeus. This work was later translated into German and published in 1762 as '. Since the latter is an uncritical reproduction of the former, they are both considered to antedate the starting point for zoological nomenclature in 1758. Nonetheless, the name \"Aedes aegypti\" was frequently used, starting with H. G. Dyar in 1920.\nTo stabilise the nomenclature, a petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature was made by P. F. Mattingly, Alan Stone, and Kenneth L. Knight in 1962. It also transpired that, although the name \"Aedes aegypti\" was universally used for the yellow fever mosquito, Linnaeus had actually described a species now known as \"Aedes (Ochlerotatus) caspius\". In 1964, the commission ruled in favour of the proposal, validating Linnaeus' name, and transferring it to the species for which it was in general use.\n\nThe yellow fever mosquito belongs to the tribe Aedini of the dipteran family Culicidae and to the genus \"Aedes\" and subgenus \"Stegomyia\". According to one recent analysis, the subgenus \"Stegomyia\" of the genus \"Aedes\" should be raised to the level of genus. The proposed name change has been ignored by most scientists; at least one scientific journal, the \"Journal of Medical Entomology\", has officially encouraged authors dealing with aedile mosquitoes to continue to use the traditional names, unless they have particular reasons for not doing so. The generic name comes from the Ancient Greek ἀηδής, \"aēdēs\", meaning \"unpleasant\" or \"odious\".\n\n"}

It was established in 1981 by former Mushi Pro staff. Presided by Hideaki Hatta, the company is also affiliated with studio Animation Do. As of 2015, Kyoto Animation has produced 21 anime series and numerous films. Unlike most animation studios, Kyoto Animation's animators are salaried employees rather than freelance workers. Therefore, Kyoto Animation animators are able to focus more on the quality of each frame rather than on meeting frame production quotas.\n\nOne of the founders, Yoko Hatta, was employed by Mushi Production, and she became independent from the studio when she moved to Kyoto after she married Hideaki Hatta. The couple founded Kyoto Animation in 1981, with Hideaki as the president, and Yoko as the vice-president. It became a limited company in 1985 and a corporation in 1999. The logo originates from the \"kyō\" kanji (京), the first character of Kyoto. Early in its history, it was involved in the production of \"Kiddy Grade\", \"InuYasha\", \"Tenchi Universe\", \"Nurse Witch Komugi\", and \"Generator Gawl\". Kyoto Animation also produced the vocal opening and ending sequences for four installments of Konami's long-running baseball game series \"Jikkyō Powerful Pro Yakyū\" (\"Power Pro\").\n\nSince 2009, Kyoto Animation has hosted the annual \"Kyoto Animation Award\" to find new stories, later publishing them in their \"KA Esuma Bunko\" imprint. Winning submissions have a chance of being adapted into an anime. \"Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions\", \"Free!\", \"Beyond the Boundary\" and \"Myriad Colors Phantom World\" were based on novels that received an honorable mention in this competition. In 2014, the novel \"Violet Evergarden\" became the first work and so far the only one to win a grand prize in any of the three categories. According to Dani Cavallaro, Kyoto Animation has become recognized for its high production values and \"sensitivity to the wonders and quandaries of ordinary life\".\n\nIn May 2020, the company announced that they would put their work on hiatus throughout the month due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nShortly after 10:30 AM JST on July 18, 2019, a fire broke out at Kyoto Animation's first studio, reportedly caused by 41-year-old Shinji Aoba pouring gasoline inside the building; he later admitted to committing the arson. Of the approximately 71 people in the building at the time, 36 people have been confirmed deceased, and 34 others (including the suspect) had various degrees of injury, requiring treatment in local hospitals.\n\nAn affiliate company, , was established to assist production at Kyoto Animation. Originally established as Kyoto Animation's Osaka office, it was incorporated as a limited company in 2000, then a corporation in 2010. Both companies are run by Hideaki Hatta and are run jointly as one. They produce up-and-coming works under the Animation Do label with Kyoto Animation as their main contractor and works where they work as one company alongside Kyoto Animation. They work on most Kyoto Animation projects and many of them have joint signatures.\n\nIn the list below, only the productions to which Kyoto Animation was a lead producer are listed.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2236787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236787", "title": "Wesley College (Victoria)", "text": "Wesley College (Victoria)\n\nWesley College is an independent, co-educational, open-entry school in Melbourne, Australia. Established in 1866, the College is the only school in Victoria to offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) from early childhood to Year 12.\n\nThe College consists of three main metropolitan campuses in Melbourne (Elsternwick: 3 years old – Year 9; Glen Waverley: 3 years old – Year 12 and St Kilda Road: 3 years old – Year 12), residential/boarding facilities (Glen Waverley), and four outdoor education campuses (Paynesville, Healesville, Clunes and Portland, Victoria).\n\nWesley is a founding member of the Associated Public Schools of Victoria and is affiliated with the Independent Primary School Heads of Australia, the Association of Independent Schools of Victoria, the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference.\n\nThe school was the first registered school in Australia, and operates in a three mini-school structure (Junior, Middle & Senior Schools), which caters for students from early childhood through to Year 12. In the Junior Schools (3 Year olds to Year 4), students from the Early Childhood Learning Centre to Year 4 are taught within the framework of the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP). In Middle School (Year 5 to Year 9), students continue to learn within the framework of the IB Primary Years Programme before transitioning into the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) in Year 7. In the Senior Schools (Years 10 to 12), Wesley offers the Victorian Certificate of Education, IB Diploma Programme and Vocational Education and Training.\n\nWesley enrolment is not subject to entrance examinations or other requirements although some preference is given to female students in order to achieve gender balance. A report in November 2007 cited Wesley's fees as among the highest of any school in Victoria.\n\nEstablished in 1866, the St Kilda Road campus has approximately 1,500 students from early childhood through to Year 12. The Glen Waverley campus, established in 1966, has over 1,200 students from early childhood through to Year 12. The Elsternwick campus, established in late 1988 (formerly Methodist Ladies' College and Cato College), has over 400 students from early childhood through to Year 9. \n\nThe Clunes residential campus was established in 1999. Year 9 students spend eight weeks living with one another as part of a unique residential program, where they learn with and contribute to the local community.\n\nWesley has three outdoor education camp sites in Victoria. Wesley's 130 hectare outdoor education camp at Chum Creek, near Healesville, commenced in 1952, coinciding with the establishment of Timbertop by Geelong Grammar School. The original 200 acres (81 ha) site was donated in 1952 by Alfred Wall, a parent whose family still owns land adjacent to the camp. One of the buildings was commemorated with a sign dedicated to Alfred Wall which has since fallen off and not been returned to its location.\nThe remaining 100 acres (40 ha) was purchased in late 1999. Camp Mallana is located on 5 hectares (12 acres) on the Banksia Peninsula, between Bairnsdale and Paynesville, with frontage to Lake Victoria and the Duck Arm shoreline. Camp Lochend, purchased in 1988, is located on 80 hectares (198 acres) near Portland.\n\nThe beginnings of Wesley College came from a decision of the colonial government of Victoria in the wake of the Victorian gold rush to grant land and funds to four religious groups, including the Wesleyan Methodist Church, for the purpose of establishing colleges in Melbourne. In 1854, the government offered the Wesleyans facing St Kilda Road. Major benefactor Walter Powell encouraged other Wesleyan Methodists to bridge the gap in funds between the government grant and that required to build the school. Daniel Draper and others subsequently contributed sufficient funds. The foundation stone was laid at the present site of the St Kilda Road campus on 4 January 1865. Draper drowned at sea on the day of the school's official opening on 11 January 1866.\n\nJames Waugh was chairman of the school committee from foundation until 1883. James Corrigan was the first of seven Headmasters in Wesley's first 35 years. The school struggled for numbers over some of this period. The Depression of the 1890s provided a particular challenge when Arthur Way was Headmaster, and came to a head in 1896 under Arthur Stephenson when enrolment dropped to 90 boys and closure was threatened. Thomas Palmer's tenure as headmaster was curtailed early in 1902 after he was found to have embezzled more than £1,000 of the school's funds.\n\nThe colours purple and gold were first chosen when the school was established in 1866. In 1875, they were changed to light blue and white (after Cambridge University and University of Melbourne), but reverted to purple and gold in 1902.\n\nLawrence Adamson is generally regarded as the single most important figure in the school's history. Adamson was Headmaster from 1902 to 1932 after beginning his teaching career there in 1887. His influence on Wesley survived well into the latter part of the 20th century from staff who were either appointed or were students during his tenure. A recent history of the school defined his contribution as giving Wesley \"prosperity, direction and reputation\". He personally contributed thousands of pounds of his personal fortune to the school. Adamson was considered less effective in his last decade as headmaster, with the centenary history published in 1967 providing the first overt criticism of him.\n\nThe St Kilda Road campus was substantially rebuilt and expanded between 1933 and 1939 following a bequest from philanthropists Alfred and George Nicholas. The gift of around £200,000 ($16 million in 2008) funded twin double-storey buildings, science laboratories, a Junior School building, swimming pool, gymnasium, chapel and other facilities. In 1942 the Australian Government requisitioned the school's campus for the Australian Army, resulting in Wesley being accommodated at Scotch College from 1942 to 1943. The college was running out of space at St Kilda Rd and as early as 1937 had secured an option to purchase the land and buildings of Box Hill Grammar School (now Kingswood College). Headmaster Neil MacNeil advanced this option, opening negotiations in 1946. Commercial agreement was reached in 1947 following McNeil's death in office but was never acted on and finally abandoned in 1955.\n\nThomas Coates (1957–1971) and David Prest (1972–1991) were long-serving headmasters during a period of substantial change, particularly during Prest's tenure. The school purchased land at Syndal in 1955, and for the next few years considered selling the St Kilda Rd campus to fund building at its new location. However, by 1959 it had decided to retain its St Kilda Road location, move the Junior School and establish playing fields at Syndal. Following a period of fund-raising, the new campus (renamed Glen Waverley campus in 1978) opened in 1966.\n\nThe school opened enrolment to girls in 1978. Boarding was discontinued in 1980, in order to accommodate more students at St Kilda Road. Wesley first approached Cato College, Elsternwick in the late 1970s regarding amalgamation. Struggling financially, Cato agreed to this in 1986, with integration into Wesley completed by 1989. In November 1989, a fire substantially damaged the St Kilda Road campus. Significant archival material was lost with the virtual destruction of the school library. The damaged areas were rebuilt by 1991.\n\nHistorian Andrew Lemon characterised Glen McArthur's tenure as headmaster (1992–1996) as leaving a sense of \"unease\". With the two larger campuses becoming more autonomous and competitive, McArthur was encouraged by the school council to engender a greater sense of a single school, but in doing so he challenged the positions of both campus heads, who left during his tenure. Ill-health affected McArthur's incumbency, and he died in 1998. David Loader became principal of Wesley in 1997 after 18 years as head of Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne and brought to fruition the country-based year 9 learning campus at Clunes in 2000. Former Glen Waverley campus head Helen Drennen became Wesley College's first female principal in June 2003.\n\nIn April 2016, a fire at the Glen Waverley campus destroyed ten years 5 and 6 classrooms.\n\nThe Wesley College crest appeared in the first edition of the college Chronicle in October 1877. It was designed by Frank Goldstraw, later headmaster from 1893 to 1895. The crest contains a pale blue cross, representing its Wesleyan Methodist Church origins; the Southern Cross; a lion, representing vigilance and constant progress associated with the motto; a book, signifying wisdom to be gained; the bible, recognising the school's Christian association; a lamp, signifying constant light necessary and ready to guide the student in the way of wisdom and a lion's head, asserting that in struggle, royal courage is a ruling element. The motto \"Sapere Aude\" was adopted by the school's founders prior to its opening in 1866 and is translated from a Latin text by Horace as \"Dare To Be Wise\".\n\nWesley was one of six founding members of the Associated Public Schools (APS). Lawrence Adamson's tenure as headmaster sparked Wesley's most successful period in APS competition. Between 1901 and 1915, the College captured multiple premierships (first team titles) – rowing (12), football (9), athletics (4) and one for cricket. Since then, notable achievements have been consecutive football premierships between 1959 and 1962, with similar success in cricket between 1933 and 1936, and five cricket titles in six years between 1949 and 1954. Success has largely eluded Wesley in boys athletics, with only one title since 1911, while the last boys rowing title was in 1984. Though in girls sport Wesley has seen huge success, winning 7 athletics premierships in a row stretching from 2012 to 2018. These multiple premiership wins were great for the success of girls sport at the college. Wesley has enjoyed greater success in girls sport, particularly in netball, softball and cross country, with over 30 premierships since 1981. Since 2000, Wesley girls have competed against schools from the Associated Grammar Schools of Victoria in addition to APS schools. Wesley has over 120 teams competing in 19 sports from Year 5 to Year 12 level. Sport is compulsory at varying levels for student in Years 7 to 12.\n\nThe St Kilda Road, Glen Waverley and Elsternwick campuses have separate student theatre companies. The Adamson Theatre Company, named after its principal performance venue was established by Tony Conabere at St Kilda Rd campus in 1988. Theatrical performances at Glen Waverley and Elsternwick campuses are both performed under the name \"Wesley Student Theatre\". Various facilities across the campuses are used as well as public venues such as BMW Edge at Federation Square and venues within the Melbourne Arts Centre.\n\nThe Glen Waverley campus has performed in New Zealand, Hong Kong, Thailand, Japan, Canada, America, England, Ireland, France, Italy and Germany since 1987.\n\nGlen Waverley & St Kilda Road campuses participate in the Generations In Jazz competition hosted by James Morrison with success achieved by St Kilda Rd (1st in Div 1 1999, 2002, 2004, 2007, 2010 and 2nd in 2008, 2009) and Glen Waverley (2nd in Div 2 2010, 1st in Div 3 2005, 2010).\n\nThe College has a long-standing singing tradition, with the first edition of its Wesley College Song Book published in 1893. The fourteenth edition was published in 2009 and over 140 tunes with lyrics have been included in the song book throughout the school's existence. The Wesley College Song Book is traditionally presented to all new students at the commencement of each school year and in turn the Wesley College Gift Book is presented when students leave the College.\n\nWesley College participates in the Debaters Association of Victoria (DAV) Schools' Competition and other debating & public speaking tournaments organised by Rotary, the RSL and the United Nations Youth Association of Australia. In 2006, Wesley won the DAV's Schools British Parliamentary debating competition, competing against Scotch College, Sydney Grammar School, and Melbourne Grammar School.\n\nThe Public Questions Society (PQS) was established at Wesley College in May 1924 and was instituted to provide a forum in which contemporary and controversial issues could be discussed. In the 1970s, College Headmaster, David Prest convinced the school council to provide funds to increase the supply of controversial figures to address the college on topics of the hour. Subjects in 1972, for example, included 'Black Power', 'Women's Liberation' and 'Legalisation of Marijuana'. More recent topics have included 'Asian Immigration and the Effect on Australia' and 'The Relationship Between Sport and Academia'. Past speakers have included: Bob Hawke, Dick Hamer, Neale Fraser, Al Grassby, Lou Richards, Keith Dunstan, Ivan Southall, Geoffrey Blainey, Andrew Lemon and Wade Davis. \n\nIn 2014, the PQS underwent its most significant change in more than a decade when then PQS Prefect Christopher Reynolds instigated the \"Commencement Lecture\". The first Commencement Lecture featured the philosopher Peter Singer, who spoke to a crowd of over 500 students and teachers.\n\nThe college also offers inter-school activities such as the Tournament of Minds competition, Alliance française competitions, the Duke of Edinburgh Award and other local competitions.\n\nWesley College and the City of Port Phillip are joint owners of the Albert Park Tennis and Hockey Centre, a facility used by a number of schools, community groups and the general public.\n\nThe College's performing arts facilities include keyboard computer music laboratories, music rooms, private music lesson rooms, orchestra rooms, theatres for music, dance and drama, drama and communication studies rooms, performing arts studios, dance studios, recording studios and other recital rooms. Notable halls of Wesley College include Adamson Hall at the St Kilda Road campus (capacity 580), Cato Hall at Glen Waverley campus (600) and Fitchett Hall at Elsternwick (350).\n\nThe Coates Pavilion at Glen Waverley was reopened in 2009 following redevelopment. Stage 2 of the 2016 College Sport Facilities master-plan was completed in 2011 when the construction of a new indoor sport complex with associated amenities (including: a weights and conditioning facilities, health and wellbeing centre and staff offices) at the Glen Waverley campus was completed. At the Clunes campus the internal works of the heritage-listed Wesleyan Church were completed in 2010 with new heritage walls, flooring, ceiling and lighting installed; the historic pipe organ was also refurbished and rebuilt.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2013 the St Kilda Rd campus underwent its largest single redevelopment since the 1930s. The music school was completely rebuilt as a state of the art music and drama facility and the adjacent Adamson Hall, the campus's primary dramatic theatre, was extensively refurbished with an expanded capacity of 580 seated, a fly tower, a hydraulic thrust stage, and a revamped sound and lighting rig.\n\nWesley was one of the first Australian schools to integrate laptop computers into its curriculum and according to its network provider in 2008, it operated Australia’s largest school notebook PC program. Wesley's IT infrastructure includes over 4,000 notebook, 1,000 desktop computers and 850 network printers. In 2005 wireless internet was launched college-wide. In 2007 Wesley introduced tablet styled notebook computers and was the first educational institution in Australia to do so, but by 2010 were no longer being issued. In 2008, Art students were using Wacom pen-tablets for drawing use. Wesley introduced interactive whiteboards across all classrooms and some lecture theatres in 2008, allowing notes to be printed to a nearby printer or emailed to students. The College also began trialling electronic reading devices in 2008.\n\nIn 2016 quite a large section of the Glen Waverly Middle school burnt down in a fire in the early morning. The area that was burnt composed of grade five and six classrooms and the language classrooms. This was a huge setback for the school which was trying to commence the start of building the new learning in residence. The Learning in Residence was going to be the new boarding house for the school. Because of all this the school had to make do with temporary classrooms for quite a few years until the new Drennen center was finished. The Drennen center was named after the former Principal Helen Drennen. The Drennen center now houses the grade 9's and the language classrooms. The grade 5 and 6's were, in the end, moved to where the old library was after the library was also moved to the Drennen center.\n\nIn 2008, \"green\" guidelines were set for staff and students. At Glen Waverley, a desalination plant with four 260,000 litre tanks was installed in 2008 to treat water sourced from a bore originally installed in 1996. It is planned to recycle storm water and run-off irrigation water via storage in 15 additional 110,000 litre tanks to be installed by the end of June 2008. The Glen Waverley campus has 22 worm farms to recycle food scraps. At the St Kilda Road campus, a joint venture with the College's neighbour, Deaf Children Australia, is in place to drill a bore and two 55,000 litre tanks have been installed. At the Elsternwick campus, an artificial turf surface has been installed on the ovals. In maintaining with the College's environmental commitment, the lawn will be a carbon neutral project with additional landscaping to be undertaken around the perimeter to maximize rain catchment. As a result of a successful trial last year using bio-diesel in some of the College's buses, bio-diesel is being implemented for all suitable vehicles across the College. The College's electricity is now supplied from 25% green power sources.\n\nIn 2007 the Glen Waverley Junior School became the first independent school in Australia to receive a five-star energy rating from the Australian Government Sustainable Schools Program and by 2008 all campuses had received five-star energy ratings. Sustainability is now part of the College curriculum. In December 2007, Wesley was recognised by Yarra Valley Water in its advertising material for its sustainable water usage, its major water management policy and for reducing its water consumption by 68%.\n\nThe Wesley College Institute for Innovation in Education was launched in 2005. Since 2007, the Wesley College Institute has been working with the Australian Council for Educational Research and the Australian Government's Education Department to develop the \"Australian Certificate of Education – Vocational\". To this end, a pilot vocational program is being considered within the cattle industry in northern Western Australia, as part of the partnership Wesley has with the community at Fitzroy River. The Institute is currently working on a project to establish studio colleges across remote outback Australia. The first studio college is located on Leopold Downs station about 80 km from Fitzroy Crossing.\n\nIn April 2010, the Wesley College Institute hosted the 2010 Global Language Convention at Glen Waverley, with delegates attending from 17 universities and over 140 schools.\n\nWesley College's alumni include two former prime ministers, twelve Rhodes scholars, five current supreme court judges and 33 Olympic athletes. Among the most notable Old Wesley Collegians are former Australian Prime Ministers Sir Robert Menzies and Harold Holt, cricketers Sam Loxton and Ian Johnson (both members of The Invincibles), AFL player and dual Brownlow Medallist Ivor Warne-Smith and politician, businessman and Olympian Sir Frank Beaurepaire, multiple Olympic and World Championship gold medallist Michael Klim, multiple world champion Emma Carney, tennis player Mark Philippoussis, netballer Sharelle McMahon and multiple knights of the realm.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the fourth episode of the .\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy, near the planet Bajor. In this episode, a bitter unjoined Trill attempts to steal the Dax symbiont from Jadzia.\n\nDuring a plasma storm, Deep Space Nine is evacuated, with only a skeleton crew remaining behind to maintain the station until the event passes. Posing as a cargo transport in distress, an unjoined Trill, a pair of hired Klingon mercenaries and a former prostitute named Mareel, board the station and overpower the crew. Kira tries to take Mareel by surprise, but Mareel beats her in the fight. The Trill, Verad, once applied to be \"joined\" and was rejected; now he wants the Dax symbiont. After restraining the shapeshifting Constable Odo in a container and taking the rest of the crew hostage, he forces Dr. Bashir to transfer the symbiont into his body. Without her symbiont, Jadzia will die within hours.\n\nBashir has one of the Klingons assist him as he tries to save Jadzia's life. Meanwhile, Commander Sisko deals with Verad, who now has the memories of all the Dax hosts, including Curzon Dax, who was a very close friend and mentor to Sisko. He implores the Trill to set things right, but he sees that Verad intends to let Jadzia die. Meanwhile, Mareel, whom Verad had befriended early in life, begins to realize how much the man has changed since he received the symbiont, and begins to think the joining may have been a bad idea. However, she remains loyal to him.\n\nQuark, who helped Verad and his crew board the station by bypassing the security lockdown, pretends to be injured and thereby provides Bashir with the opportunity to sedate one of the Klingons. He then cracks the lock on the container holding Odo. Once Verad realizes what has happened, he heads for his ship, taking Kira as a hostage.\n\nBy the time Verad reaches his ship, Odo has released the docking clamps, leaving him stranded. Major Kira overpowers the Klingon who is holding her, but in the confusion Verad slips away, heading for another runabout pad. In the meantime, Mareel has realized that the man she loves truly is gone and decides to help Sisko. Sisko confronts Verad at the airlock to the runabout. Believing that Sisko will not shoot his old friend and risk damaging the recently joined symbiont, Verad begins to walk away, but Sisko shoots him, declaring, \"Don't call me \"Benjamin\"!\". The Dax symbiont is returned to Jadzia, leaving Verad alone with himself once again.\n\nTim Russ portrays the Klingon T'Kar in this episode; he also appeared in a similarly minor antagonistic role as Devor in the \"\" episode \"Starship Mine\", and would go on to portray one of the main crew members, the Vulcan Tuvok, in \"\".\n\nIn 2018, SyFy included this episode on their Jadzia Dax binge-watching guide.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2236832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236832", "title": "Ithaca Commons", "text": "Ithaca Commons\n\nThe Ithaca Commons is a two-block pedestrian mall in the business improvement district known as Downtown Ithaca that serves as the city's cultural and economic center. The Commons is a popular regional destination, and is filled with upscale restaurants and shops, public art, and frequent community festivals.\n\nThe Commons is shaped like an inverted T. It consists of a two-block segment of State Street between Cayuga and Aurora Streets lined with shops, galleries, restaurants, and bars, and a smaller one-block segment, \"Bank Alley,\" extending north up Tioga Street to Seneca Street, that is home to several banks and financial institutions. Many of the buildings are mixed-use, with apartments or offices on the upper floors. Tompkins Cortland Community College has a small satellite campus on the Commons.\n\nDuring the summer, local musicians and other entertainers put on free concerts and performances, including at the Bernie Milton Pavilion. The Commons is also used for many political protests, rallies, and speeches.\n\nThe Commons hosts several festivals throughout the year, including Ithaca's main annual festival, the Ithaca Festival in early June.\n\nA scale model of the Solar System, the Sagan Planet Walk, begins in the Commons. The Planet Walk is named after famed Cornell University astronomer Carl Sagan, and stretches 3/4 mile from to the Sciencenter. The inner ring planets all fit on a short section of Bank Alley.\n\nThe two main hubs of Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit (TCAT)'s bus network are located adjacent to the Commons.\n\nBy the 1960s, the rise of car culture, suburbs, and urban renewal had severely hurt downtown Ithaca. Many storefronts were empty, and many historic buildings had been torn down and replaced with vacant lots. In 1971, newly elected Mayor Ed Conley, \"pulling on a 1950s-era suggestion from a Cornell city planning student\", proposed converting several blocks of State Street into a pedestrian mall. At the time, many small towns in the United States were experimenting with using pedestrian malls to revive downtowns. Formal design began in 1972, under the direction of local architect Anton J. Egner. Construction began in 1974, and the Commons opened in 1975. It cost $1.13 million The name \"The Commons\" was the winning entry in a community-wide \"name the mall\" contest, and a prize of $1,000 in cash and gift certificates went to Ithaca High School senior Bill Ryan who had entered the name after a visit to the Boston Common.\n\nIt faced immediate competition, with the Ithaca area's first mall opening the next year in Lansing. In 1981, several vacant lots created by urban renewal were filled by the construction of Center Ithaca, a large mixed-use building with first-floor retail, an indoor food court connected to the Commons, and upper-floor offices and apartments.\n\nTogether with the rest of Upstate New York, the Commons suffered through the 1990s with many empty storefronts. Rothschilds, a local department store, closed in the early 1980s, and its successors, Iszards (the only store outside of the Elmira area) and a McCurdy's store, closed in the mid-1990s. A McDonald's and a CVS also closed on the Commons in the mid-90s, and a block away, a Woolworths store closed in 1998. Then-Mayor Alan Cohen (owner of a restaurant located on the Commons) proposed removing the Commons and opening up the two-block portion of State Street to automobile traffic.\n\nAt the turn of the century, the Commons's fortune began to turn around, due to increased investment and the rise of New Urbanism. The Downtown Ithaca Alliance, a business improvement district, was created in 1997 to revitalize the Commons and its surroundings. The vacant former Woolworths was renovated into the new home of the Tompkins County Public Library in 2000. In 2005, Seneca Place, a large mixed-use building incorporating retail, a Hilton Garden Inn, office space for Cornell University and Morgan Stanley, and the Ithaca area's first Starbucks opened adjacent to the Commons. Between 2003 and 2015, the Cayuga Green project replaced several lots of surface parking adjacent to the Commons with a new home for independent movie theatre Cinemapolis, an Urban Outfitters, two buildings of luxury apartments, and a new multi-level parking garage with first-floor retail. Another luxury apartment building, Gateway Commons, was completed nearby in 2007.\n\nBut the Commons' aging infrastructure started to cause problems. In the late 1990s, an ad hoc city committee formed to discuss the future of the Commons. Their report, \"Renewing the Design of the Ithaca Commons: The Report of The Commons Design Review Committee,\" was released in April 1999, and led to a $127,000 capital project. The project consisted largely of maintenance work, although it also paid for the removal of a large, brutalist fountain that had been turned off for years due to leaky plumbing. The fountain was replaced with a large, open paved area with seating. More temporary repairs were made to the Commons in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, the city commissioned landscape architecture firm Sasaki Associates to do a complete redesign, with a more open central lane, \"patterned pavement, varied and movable seating, improved performance spaces, energy-efficient lighting, an outdoor reading area and a small playground.\"\n\nThe old Commons was demolished in April 2013. The reconstruction was originally planned to take 18 months and cost $9.5 million. But a series of problems, including a poorly-documented existing conditions, poorly-drawn plans, poor coordination with NYSEG, and mayhem caused by a runaway truck, caused the project to go long over schedule and budget. Many business owners reported dramatically decreased sales and foot traffic. In August 2015, the Commons re-opened, at a total cost of $15 million.\n\nIn 2012, a stainless steel and bronze sculpture of Martin Luther King, Jr. was unveiled at the western end of the Commons. The sculpture, by Rob Licht, depicts a portrait bust of King with an abstracted image of a waterfall. The base of the statue it etched with a quotation from King.\n\nIn late 2015, construction began on a new, ten-story Marriott hotel on a vacant triangular lot at the eastern end of the Commons. The hotel opened in November 2016.\n\nIn 2013, a local developer proposed replacing three undistinguished buildings on the Commons with modern retail spaces, three stories of office space, and an eleven-story apartment tower. The project, named \"Harold's Square,\" would also result in the historic rehabilitation of the 19th-century Sage Block building. The project is expected to be completed in summer 2019.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2236836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236836", "title": "Restoration spectacular", "text": "Restoration spectacular\n\nThe Restoration spectacular, or elaborately staged machine play, hit the London public stage in the late 17th-century Restoration period, enthralling audiences with action, music, dance, moveable scenery, baroque illusionistic painting, gorgeous costumes, and special effects such as trapdoor tricks, \"flying\" actors, and fireworks. These shows have always had a bad reputation as a vulgar and commercial threat to the witty, \"legitimate\" Restoration drama; however, they drew Londoners in unprecedented numbers and left them dazzled and delighted.\n\nBasically home-grown and with roots in the early 17th-century court masque, though never ashamed of borrowing ideas and stage technology from French opera, the spectaculars are sometimes called \"English opera\". However, the variety of them is so untidy that most theatre historians despair of defining them as a genre at all. Only a handful of works of this period are usually accorded the term \"opera\", as the musical dimension of most of them is subordinate to the visual. It was spectacle and scenery that drew in the crowds, as shown by many comments in the diary of the theatre-lover Samuel Pepys. The expense of mounting ever more elaborate scenic productions drove the two competing theatre companies into a dangerous spiral of huge expenditure and correspondingly huge losses or profits. A fiasco such as John Dryden's \"Albion and Albanius\" would leave a company in serious debt, while blockbusters like Thomas Shadwell's \"Psyche\" or Dryden's \"King Arthur\" would put it comfortably in the black for a long time.\n\nThe distinction between \"legitimate\" Restoration drama and the Restoration spectacular, or \"musical spectacular,\" or \"Dorset Garden spectacular,\" or \"machine play\" is one of degree rather than kind. \"All\" plays of the period featured music and dancing and some scenery, most of them also songs. Restoration heroic drama, for all its literariness, relied on opulent scenery. However, the true spectacular, of which Milhous counts only eight over the entire 1660–1700 Restoration period, was produced on a whole different scale. The spectacular is defined by the large number of sets and performers required, the vast sums of money invested, the potential for great profits, and the long preparation time needed. Milhous calculates a likely requirement of at least four to six months of planning, contracting, building, and rehearsing, to be compared with the four to six \"weeks\" of rehearsal time a new \"legitimate\" play would get.\n\nPrevious generations of theatre historians have despised the operatic spectaculars, perhaps influenced by John Dryden's sour comments about expensive and tasteless \"scenes, machines, and empty operas\". However, audiences loved the scenes and machines and operas, as Samuel Pepys' diary shows. Dryden wrote several baroque machine plays himself. The first, \"The State of Innocence\" (1677), was never staged, as his designated company, the King's, had neither the capital nor the machinery for it: a dramatisation of John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", it called for \"rebellious angels wheeling in the air, and seeming transfixed with thunderbolts\" over \"a lake of brimstone or rolling fire\". The King's Company's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane was not up to lakes of rolling fire; only the \"machine house\" at Dorset Garden was, and that belonged to the competition, the Duke's Company. When the two companies had merged in the 1680s and Dryden had access to Dorset Garden, he wrote one of the most visual and special-effects-ridden machine plays of the entire Restoration period, \"Albion and Albanius\" (1684–85):\nThe Cave of PROTEUS rises out of the Sea; it consists of several arches of Rock-work adorned with mother-of-pearl, coral, and abundance of shells of various kinds. Through the arches is seen the Sea, and parts of Dover-pier; in the middle of the Cave is PROTEUS asleep on a rock adorned with shells, &c. like the Cave. ALBION and ACACIA seize on him; and while a symphony is playing, he sinks as they are bringing him forward, and changes himself into a Lion, a Crocodile, a Dragon, and then to his own shape again; he comes forward to the front of the stage, and sings.\"\nHow were such effects produced, and how did they look? The crocodile etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from the first half of the 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.\n\nWhat the technology and the visual experiences were can only be tenuously inferred from stage directions. Milhous concludes from a review of Dorset Garden performances that \"at a conservative estimate\" the theatre was equipped to fly at least four people independently, and had some very complex floor traps for \"transformations\" such as that of Proteus. The plates printed in the first edition of Elkanah Settle's \"Empress of Morocco\" (1673) (see detail, top right) are the only pictures of actual Restoration stage sets. Pepys' mentions of stage effects in his diary, 1660–68, give the modern reader some help in visualising what audiences saw in the 1660s, and even more in entering into their enthusiasms, but the 1660s were still early days. There are scarcely any descriptions or reactions preserved from the heyday of the machine play in the 1670s–90s, although a general idea of its technology can be gathered from the better-documented French and Italian opera scenery which inspired Thomas Betterton at Dorset Garden Theatre.\n\nIn the early 17th century, moveable \"scenes\"—painted wings and backdrops—and technical \"machines\" or \"devices\" for flying and other special effects were used in the masques produced for and by the court of Charles I. In William Davenant's \"Salmacida Spolia\" (1640), for instance, the last of the court masques before the Civil War, Queen Henrietta Maria (pregnant at the time) makes her entrance \"descending by a theatrical device from a cloud.\" As early as 1639, Davenant had obtained a royal patent authorising construction of a large new public theatre with technology that would allow such effects and accommodate music, scenery, and dancing. Such an invasion of court-drama technique in the public theatre met opposition from \"legitimate\" dramatists, and before the opposition could be overcome, the war had closed down the theatres in 1642.\n\nThe public stage ban 1642–60 imposed by the Puritan regime represents a long and sharp break in dramatic tradition, but was still never completely successful in suppressing the ideologically hateful make-believe of play-acting. Performances in grand private houses were not unusual, and could have quite elaborate sets, as can be seen from the extant drawings for the original performance of Davenant's opera \"The Siege of Rhodes\" (1656) at his home Rutland House. This was public theatre in all but name, as Davenant charged 5 shillings for admission. Some professional actors also managed to scrape a living and evade the authorities in stealth acting companies in London, such as that of Michael Mohun at the Red Bull Theatre. Professional writers from the previous era were growing middle-aged, biding their time, and hoping for the monarchy to be restored. By the later 1650s, it was becoming obvious that that time was at hand, and William Davenant, for example, stepped up his theatrical activities.\n\nWhen the public performance ban was lifted at the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II immediately encouraged the drama and took a personal interest in the scramble for acting licences and performance rights which followed. Two middle-aged pre-Commonwealth playwrights notable for their loyalty during Charles' exile emerged from the struggle with royal Letters Patent for new, or refurbished, patent theatre companies: Thomas Killigrew and William Davenant. Killigrew was able to take over Michael Mohun's skilled veteran troupe for his \"King's Company\" and to start with \"what was essentially a going concern\" (Hume), with the added advantage of the traditional performance rights Mohun brought with him for practically the whole classic repertory of William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and the Beaumont and Fletcher team. The competition, Davenant's \"Duke's Company\", seemed doomed to a secondary position with its young, scratched-together troupe and scarcely any performance rights. They were only allowed to put on abridged and modernized versions of Shakespeare plays, and a few that Davenant had written. However, Davenant, \"a brilliant impresario\" (Hume), was soon able to turn the tables on Killigrew by realising his old pre-Civil War dream of music, dance, and spectacular visual effects on the public stage.\n\nDuring the autumn of 1660, while the Duke's Company was still getting financed (mostly by means of the actors buying company shares) and having temporary quarters set up, the King's Company offered a string of well-received productions. Their new albeit traditional theatre in Vere Street was already fully operational. The devoted playgoer Samuel Pepys called it \"the finest playhouse... that ever was in England\" in his diary, a sentiment he would need to revise many times over the coming decade, and recorded his awe at seeing Michael Mohun, \"who is said to be the best actor in the world\", act on its stage. Davenant was far behind, but daringly put all his capital into the outfitting of a new superior playhouse in Lincoln's Inn Fields (simultaneously, with great foresight, prying loose the rising young star Thomas Betterton from the King's Company), and perfectly hit public taste.\n\nLincoln's Inn Fields opened on 28 June 1661, with the first \"moveable\" or \"changeable\" scenery used on the British public stage, i.e. wings or \"shutters\" that ran in grooves and could be smoothly and mechanically changed between or even within acts. The production was a revamped version of Davenant's own five-year-old opera \"The Siege of Rhodes\". It is not known who painted the scenes or shutters, or whether continental craftsmen were responsible for the technical construction, but the result was such a sensation that it brought Charles II to a public theatre for the first time. The competing King's Company suddenly found itself playing to empty houses, as Pepys notes on 4 July:\nI went to the theatre [in Vere Street] and there I saw \"Claracilla\" (the first time I ever saw it), well acted. But strange to see this house, that use to be so thronged, now empty since the opera begun—and so will continue for a while I believe.\n\"The Siege of Rhodes\" \"continued acting 12 days without interruption with great applause\" according to the prompter John Downes in his \"historical review of the stage\" \"Roscius Anglicanus\" (1708). This was a remarkable run for the limited potential audience of the time. As four more acclaimed Duke's Company productions \"with scenes\" followed at Lincoln's Inn Fields in the course of 1661 (including \"Hamlet\"), all highly admired by Pepys, the King's Company had no other recourse than to hastily commission a changeable-scenery playhouse of their own. Bowing to the inevitable just seven months after the opening of Lincoln's Inn Fields, Killigrew and his actors signed orders for a new, even more magnificent, theatre in Bridges Street. This theatre, the first step in the war of spectacle escalation of the 1660s, was so full when Pepys and his wife went to see an opera there that \"they told us we could have no room\". The large, yet compact, Restoration playhouses, with audience capacities from 700 (Bridges Street) to upwards of 2,000 (the next house on the same site, the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, finished in 1674), were enormous investments, financed through selling shares in the companies, which were thus bound to make more and more money from ticket sales. Not only the theatres and their technical equipment, but the flats painted for a single performance, the special effects, and the elaborate stage clothes, were extremely expensive. Audiences appreciated both luxury and appropriateness of décor and costume: Pepys was quite capable of going several times to see a play that, as such, he disliked, purely for the pleasure of viewing striking and innovative scenery like \"a good scene of a town on fire\". The companies struggled to outdo each other in catering to these expensive tastes, with precarious finances and the ever-present consciousness that the investments could literally burn to the ground in a few hours. When the theatre in Bridges Street did burn down in January 1672, with its entire stock of scenery and costumes, it was an economic blow from which the King's Company's never recovered.\n\nThe Duke's Company, operating smoothly under what soon became Davenant's and Thomas Betterton's joint management, consistently led the way while the King's lagged further and further behind, moving only in forced response and suffering from chronic management conflict between Killigrew and powerful actor shareholders like Michael Mohun and Charles Hart, who insisted on actor-centred \"talk\" drama. The difference can be traced in Pepys' regular preference for performances at the Duke's, and in his ever-renewed admiration for Betterton's acting. In December 1667, the King's Company even ceased acting for some days because of a quarrel between Mohun and Hart. With the escalation of expense, days with zero takings were a very serious matter. The crowning grand investment of the Duke's Company was totally beyond the King's means to respond to: the \"machine house\" at Dorset Garden.\n\nAn era came to an end in 1668 with two events: Davenant died suddenly, leaving a messy ownership situation for the Duke's Company, and Pepys' eyesight forced him to stop keeping a diary. Thomas Betterton, though formally a minority shareholder, continued to run the Duke's Company, and, in the spirit of Davenant, commissioned the most elaborate of the Restoration playhouses, the theatre at Dorset Garden (or Dorset Gardens), with a flat for himself on top. Although the Dorset Garden Theatre quickly became a famous and glamorous venue, very little is concretely known about the building and outfitting of it: a vague and undocumented tradition ascribes its design to Christopher Wren. The absence of Pepys' record means that performance data for the next decades are only patchily known.\n\nThe machines at Dorset Garden and several of the most flamboyant production concepts realised through them were strongly influenced by the French opera and \"tragédie en machines\". Paris was home to the most elaborate visual and musical stage productions in Europe, and Betterton travelled to Paris in the summer of 1671 to learn from the sensation of the season, the \"comédie-ballet\" \"Psyché\" by Molière, Corneille, and Quinault, to music by Lully. \"For several things concerning the decoration of the play, I am obliged to the French\", acknowledged Thomas Shadwell in the introduction to his own \"Psyche\" in 1674. Even more directly influential were the French operatic visits to London, which sparked off a new interest in opera proper in London audiences. In a brilliant move, the King's Company, all but bankrupt after the crushing blow of the fire in Bridges Street, invited the French musician Robert Cambert to perform his opera \"Ariadne\" as one of the first productions at their new playhouse in Drury Lane. The Duke's Company responded to the visual gorgeousness of this guest appearance with a Shakespearean extravaganza at Dorset Garden: Shadwell's adaptation of Davenant's and Dryden's version of Shakespeare's \"Tempest\", a piece designed to show off the new machinery:\nThe Front of the Stage is open'd, and the Band of 24 Violins, with the Harpsicals and Theorbo's which accompany the Voices, are plac'd between the Pit and the Stage. While the Overture is playing, the Curtain rises, and discovers a new Frontispiece, joyn'd to the great Pylasters, on each side of the Stage... Behind this is the Scene, which represents a thick Cloudy Sky, a very Rocky Coast, and a Tempestuous Sea in perpetual Agitation. This Tempest (suppos'd to be rais'd by Magick) has many dreadful Objects in it, as several Spirits in horrid shapes flying down amongst the Sailers, then rising and crossing in the Air. And when the Ship is sinking, the whole House is darken'd, and a shower of Fire falls upon 'em. This is accompanied with Lightning, and several Claps of Thunder, to the end of the Storm.\nThis multiplication of effects at the very outset of the play served as a shock and foretaste of what the audience would find farther along.\n\nThe technical capacities of Dorset Garden were little used for Restoration comedy, and, while most heroic drama included some scenes that showed off the perspective stage or used some of the simpler machines, spectacle on this limited scale could be just as well staged at Drury Lane. The plays for which Dorset Garden was built, the \"machine plays\" of the 1670s and 1680s and the operas of the 1690s, were a category to themselves, different from ordinary serious drama: more static, more mythological, much more gorgeous, infinitely more expensive. So elaborate was the scale of these productions, and so long each preparation time, that only five \"machine plays\" were produced during the 1670s; yet they were hugely important for the finances of the Duke's Company, mostly in a positive sense. They were Davenant's version of \"Macbeth\" (1672–73), Settle's \"Empress of Morocco\" (probably 1673), Shadwell/Dryden/Davenant's \"Tempest\" (1673–74), Thomas Shadwell's long-awaited \"Psyche\" (1674–75), and Charles Davenant's \"Circe\" (1676–77).\n\n\"Psyche\" had not one, but two, extremely elaborate sets for each of five acts. This is the setting for the beginning of Act 3:\nThe Scene is the Palace of Cupid, compos'd of wreath'd Columns of the Corinthian Order; the Wreathing is adorn'd with Roses, and the Columns have several little Cupids flying about 'em, and a single Cupid standing upon every Capital. At a good distance are seen three Arches, which divide the first Court from the other part of the Building: The middle Arch is noble and high, beautified with Cupids and Festoons, and supported with Columns of the foresaid Order. Through these Arches is seen another Court, that leads to the main Building, which is at a mighty distance. All the Cupids, Capitals and Inrichments of the whole Palace are of Gold. Here the Cyclops are at work at a forge, forging great Vases of Silver. The Musick strikes up, they dance, hammering the Vases upon Anvils. After the Dance, Enter \"Vulcan\".\n(The gold cupids on the columns are due to come to life and jump off.) The use of perspective scenery and many arches is evident here, creating an illusion of the first court being \"at a good distance\" and the next \"at a mighty distance\". This creation of fake depth was a favourite device, repeated when the scene changed halfway through the act:\nThe scene changes to the principal street of the city, with vast numbers of people looking down from the tops of houses, and out of the windows and balconies, which are hung with tapestry. In this street is a large triumphal arch, with columns of the Doric order, adorned with the statues of Fame and Honour, &c. beautified with festoons of flowers; all the enrichments of gold. Through this arch, at a vast distance, in the middle of a piazza, is seen a stately obelisk.\nThe numbers of performers used, mainly dancers, is clearly staggering compared to the regular comedy or serious play, where the norm was something like 10–15 actors plus a few extras. Although actual numbers are generally vague in these mass scene stage directions, dance scenes like that of the cyclops, and all the cupids who will join them on the floor minutes later, rely on coordination, choreography, and generous collective effects. Of course the many highly paid dancers would be busy in many roles, returning as townspeople after the scene change of Act 3 with most of the gold paint hastily washed off, and entranced looking upwards to see \"Mars and Venus meet in the air in their chariots, his drawn by horses, and hers by doves\".\n\nEach production was a gamble. The aspect of the machine plays that posterity knows most about is their economics, as this was what the old prompter Downes most vividly recalled when he wrote his \"Roscius Anglicanus\" in 1708. The scenery alone for \"Psyche\" cost more than £800, which can be related to the entire annual box office takings for the company of £10,000. Ticket prices for these performances would be raised to up to four times normal. Both \"Psyche\" and \"The Tempest\" actually complained of the production costs in their epilogues, hinting pointedly that the public ought to reward the \"poor players\" for their risk-taking and for offering splendours that had so far been reserved for royal masques:\n\nThe audience apparently agreed, transfixed by such sights as Venus ascending into the heavens and \"being almost lost in the clouds\", whereupon \"Cupid flies up and gets into her chariot, and brings her back\", followed by Jupiter appearing on a flying eagle. \"Psyche\" turned out highly profitable. It is altogether a pattern that the 1670s productions did make money, while those of the 1680s and 1690s barely broke even or were actual economic disasters.\n\nEven after the King's Company got their new well-appointed playhouse in Drury Lane in 1674, they could not take full advantage of it, as they lacked the capital to mount competitive spectaculars. Instead, they attempted to simultaneously capitalise on and snipe at the Duke's most successful mid-1670s offerings by mounting several burlesques or parodies of them, written by Thomas Duffett. The records for the mid-1670s are particularly incomplete, and neither exact dates nor the public reaction to Duffett's pieces are known, but even the printed versions, pale shadows of Duffett's travesty spectacles, have proved highly amusing to modern critics. The first of them, \"The Empress of Morocco\", caricatured simultaneously Settle's \"Empress of Morocco\" and the sumptuous new Dorset Garden production of Davenant's \"Macbeth\" adaptation, with Duffett's three witches flying in over the pit on brooms at the high point of the action, followed by the descent of Heccate over the Stage \"in a glorious chariot, adorned with pictures of hell and devils, and made of a large wicker basket\". \"The Mock Tempest\" improves on the shower of fire over the audience in the Dorset Garden pseudo-Shakespearean tempest scene with a rain of \"fire, apples, nuts\".\n\nThere was no investment in spectaculars during the political unrest of 1678–84 with the Popish Plot and the Exclusion Crisis, lean years for theatre. In 1682, the companies merged, making Dorset Garden's technical resources available to Dryden, who rapidly got over his principled objection to the superficiality of \"spectacle\" and \"empty operas\". The orgy of machinery and extravagant visuals that he went on to write, \"Albion and Albanius\" (1684–85), is quoted in the \"Introductory\" section, with the cave of Proteus rising out of the sea. Here is Juno in her flying peacock machine:\nThe Clouds divide, and JUNO appears in a Machine drawn by Peacocks; while a Symphony is playing, it moves gently forward, and as it descends, it opens and discovers the Tail of the Peacock, which is so large, that it almost fills the opening of the Stage between Scene and Scene.\nUnusual visual allegory in this Tory panegyric of Charles II and the House of Stuart includes a figure representing the radical Whig leader Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury \"with fiend's wings, and snakes twisted round his body; he is encompassed by several fanatical rebellious heads, who suck poison from him, which runs out of a tap in his side.\" In an investor's nightmare, while Dryden's propaganda piece was in preparation, Charles II died, James II succeeded him, and the Monmouth Rebellion which Shaftesbury had fomented broke out. On the very day of the premiere, June 3, 1685, the Duke of Monmouth landed in the west. \"The nation being in a great consternation\", recollected Downes, \"it was performed but six times, which not answering half the charge they were at, involved the company very much in debt.\" This traumatic fiasco ruled out all further operatic spectacle investment until the calmer times after the Glorious Revolution of 1689.\n\nWhile the monopoly United Company's takings were being bled off by Davenant's shyster sons, one of whom, Alexander, was forced to flee the country in 1693 and other predatory investors, Thomas Betterton continued to act as de facto day-to-day manager and producer, enjoying a budget on the scale of Cecil B. DeMille. In the early 1690s, he staged the three real operas of the Restoration spectacular genre, or the shows usually so designated: \"Dioclesian\" (1689–90) by Massinger/Fletcher/Betterton; \"King Arthur\" (1690–91) by John Dryden; and \"The Fairy-Queen\" (1691–92), adapted from Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" by perhaps Elkanah Settle, all of them graced by music by Henry Purcell, and together perhaps a sign of the coming 18th-century vogue for Italian opera. The lavish variety entertainment \"Dioclesian\", adapted by Betterton, with many monsters, dragons, and machines, from Massinger and Fletcher's \"History of Dioclesian\", was very popular throughout the 1690s and made a lot of money for the United Company. So did Dryden's much more serious \"King Arthur\", the first operatic entertainment that Hume is prepared to consider an artistic success, with Purcell's marvellous music a major part of the entertainment and the songs \"for once well integrated into the play\".\n\nAt the very end of its history, the economics of the Restoration spectacular spiralled out of control with the magnificent production of \"The Fairy Queen\" in the 1691–92 season. It was a great popular success, but so stuffed with special effects and so expensive that it nevertheless proved impossible to make money from it. As Downes recalls: \"Though the court and town were wonderfully satisfied with it ... the expenses in setting it out being so great, the company got little by it.\" Its twelve-foot-high working fountain and six dancing real live monkeys have become notorious in theatre history.\n\nThe spectacular play died out with the Restoration period, but spectacle would continue on the English stage as the splendours of Italian grand opera hit London in the early 18th century. The dangerous Restoration economic spiral of the ever-more-expensive machine plays would teach 18th- and 19th-century theatrical entrepreneurs to dispense with playwrighting altogether and minimise the cast, utilising any number of surprising effects and scenes in the dumbshow of pantomime and Harlequin, without attendant costs in music, dramatists, and cast.\n\nThere have been a small number of attempts to resurrect the Restoration spectacular as a background to modern cinema: Terry Gilliam's \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\" features at its start perhaps the most accurate reconstruction, with painted scenery, mechanisms and lighting effects typical of the period.\n\n\n"}

In the , Herberton had a population of 855 people.\n\nAt its apogee, Herberton was the richest tin mining field in Australia, and was home to 17 public hotels, 2 local newspapers and a brewery.\n\nHerberton is on the Atherton Tableland in Far North Queensland. It is situated high on the Great Dividing Range south-west of Atherton. Vegetation ranges from tropical rainforest to the east, wet sclerophyll forests to the north and east and open sclerophyll forests and woodlands to the north and west.\n\nThe first European exploration of this area, part of the traditional land of the Dyirbal, was undertaken in 1875 by James Venture Mulligan. Mulligan was prospecting for gold, but instead found tin. The town of Herberton was established on 19 April 1880 by John Newell to exploit the tin find, and mining began on 9 May 1880. By September 1880, Herberton had a population of 300 men and 27 women. Herberton Post Office opened on 22 November 1880.\n\nThe town's name is attributed to John Newell. It is believed he named it after the Herbert River whose northern tributary (Wild River) flows through Herberton and/or after Robert George Wyndham Herbert, the first Premier of Queensland (after whom the Herbert River is named).\n\nIn July 1881 the residents of Herberton had raised £115 for the construction of a school. Herberton Provisional School opened on 12 December 1881 with 35 students in the Herberton Hall; the fee was one shilling per week for the first child of a family with an additional sixpence a week for each additional child. In October 1882 the Queensland Government reserved five acres and two roods for a state school and called for tenders to erect a state school and teacher's residence. In November 1882 the contract for the buildings was awarded to James Pasley to construct the buildings using hardwood in nine months for £2,040. In April 1883 the Queensland Government officially announced that there would be a new state school in Herberton. The actual opening date of the new state school is unclear but Thomas Peter Wood was appointed headmaster of Herberton State School from 1 January 1884, so the school was operational at that time. In 1912 the school was one of the first five schools in Queensland to receive a secondary department, commencing operations on 15 February 1912 with the arrival of the teacher Miss Ramsay B.A. who would teach two languages, English history, mathematics, and science. In 1994 a new primary school campus was established with the secondary department remaining on the original school site.\n\nIn January 1882 the Queensland Government called for tenders to construct a telegraph line to Herberton. In March 1882 they called for tenders for a post and telegraph office.\n\nIn the late 19th century the Mulligan Highway was carved through the hills from Herberton and passed through what is now Main Street, Atherton, before continuing down to Port Douglas. This road was used by the coaches of Cobb and Co to access Western Queensland.\n\nThe tin mining in Herberton motivated the Queensland Government to build a railway line to connect Herberton to a coastal port. Three ports were considered: Port Douglas, Cairns and Geraldton (now Innisfail), all involving a crossing of the Great Dividing Range. The route from Innisfail was shortest but would go through the roughest terrain crossing the Great Dividing Range. The route from Port Douglas was the easiest to build but it would be longest. Eventually Cairns was chosen as it had the best port (and the unstable geology of the proposed Barron Gorge route was not known at that time) and the first section of the Tablelands railway from Cairns to Redlynch at the base of the range was opened on 8 October 1887. However, the railway to Herberton was not completed until 20 October 1910 by which time the tin mining boom was over.\n\nSt Mary's Anglican School for girls was opened in 1918 by the Sisters of the Sacred Advent. The school closed in 1965.\n\nMount St Bernard College was established on 1 February 1921 by the Sisters of Mercy.\n\nTin mining ceased in Herberton in 1985.\n\nThe Herberton Public Library opened in 1995 with a major refurbishment in 2016.\n\nAt the 2006 census, Herberton had a population of 974.\n\nIn the 2011 census, Herberton had a population of 934 people.\n\nHerberton has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nHerberton is notably drier than the area around Atherton with average rainfall for Herberton of . Herberton is the most northerly location in Australia to have recorded a temperature at or below , and also the only location in Tropical North Queensland to have done so. The average minimum temperature ranges from in winter to in summer, while maximums range from .\n\nSeveral crops are grown around Herberton, and it is the location of Queensland's only tropical vineyard. Herberton is a mini salad bowl with crops including avocados, lettuce, tomatoes, maize and pumpkins. Poultry and beef industries are also present.\n\nHerberton's public hospital and the private school, Mt Saint Bernard residential college, are other major employers in the town.\n\nThe Herberton Mining Museum and Visitor Information Centre opened in 2005, houses mining and social history of the Herberton Mining field, archives for the local area and maintains a genealogy project recording the families of the district and their histories.\n\nA Heritage Walk for tourists that takes in some of the old buildings and historical features of the town is a popular attraction. Historic Village Herberton is a 16-acre representation of a mining town filled with streets of buildings of the time, each one a museum in its own right with exhibits such as vintage machinery, cars and Australian antiques. It has more than 50 restored period buildings.\n\nThe Herberton Spy & Camera Museum houses antique spy cameras, a photographic gallery and photographic memorabilia with guided tours through the museum and a working photographer and photographic studio.\n\nMost recently, a railway museum has been established by volunteers in the former Herberton railway station building. This is operated by volunteers and only open part-time.\n\nThe Tepon Equestrian Grounds just out of Herberton have recently been upgraded with a large undercover pavilion for equestrian and other sporting events such as cycling and mountain biking. Local markets are held on the 3rd Sunday of every month at the Wondecla Oval.\n\nThere are several caravan parks, hotels, motels and B&Bs located in the town.\n\nThe Tablelands Regional Council operates a Herberton Public Library and Customer Service Centre at 61 Grace Street.\n\nThe Herberton branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at the QCWA Hall at 14 William Street.\n\nHerberton State School is a government primary and secondary (Prep-10) school for boys and girls at Elwyn Phillips Memorial Drive in Moomin (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 176 students with 20 teachers (17 full-time equivalent) and 17 non-teaching staff (12 full-time equivalent). It inclludes a special education program.

{"id": "2236859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236859", "title": "Starweb", "text": "Starweb\n\nStarweb is a play-by-mail game of strategy and diplomacy invented in 1976 by Rick Loomis. It is likely the longest lived play-by-mail game that started life in that medium. It remains a popular game at Flying Buffalo.\n\nPlayed for points, \"Starweb\" is primarily a hidden movement wargame. Six different types of players (Empire Builder, Merchant, Berserker, Apostle, Pirate, and Artifact Collector) gain points in different ways; nevertheless, most victories come from taking something away from somebody else.\n\nPlayers write down their orders using an arcane command language, which is then entered into the \"Starweb\" computer program and the orders calculated simultaneously. The results are then printed and mailed back to the players. In recent years the system has moved to e-mail. Scoring rules differ based on the character class. The game ends when any player reaches a score determined (but not revealed to the players) at the beginning of the game.\n\nOne interesting concept in the game is the idea of \"artifacts\", a number of which are randomly scattered around the game map during setup. The artifacts have certain point values for each class, but the Artifact Collector gains considerably more points for holding collections of them in a single place. One of the artifacts, The Black Box, has a random effect which is not revealed to the players.\n\n\"Starweb\" uses the term \"Berserker\" with permission of Fred Saberhagen; Saberhagen returned the favor by using a fictionalized \"Starweb\" game as a backdrop for his novel \"Octagon\" (1981).\n\nWhen players expressed an interest in PBM in a science-fiction setting, Flying Buffalo released \"Starweb\" as its second PBM game.\n\nJay Reese reviewed \"Starweb\" in \"The Space Gamer\" No. 11. Reese concluded that \"If you can get past the early errors and discouragement, you will find that \"Starweb\" can be a fascinating game.\"\n\nPaul S. Person reviewed \"Starweb\" in \"The Space Gamer\" No. 29. Person commented that \"\"Starweb\" is a smoothly-run game (3-4 weeks for the slow version) which emphasizes diplomacy at the expense of detail. It is recommended for those who like galactic empire themes and who would like a game with lots of hidden intelligence.\"\n\nThe game has won a number of awards over the years (including the 1984 Charles S. Roberts Award for \"Best Play-by-Mail Game\", the 2000 and 2003 Origins Awards for \"Best Play-by-Mail Game\", and the 1997 Origins Award for \"Best Ongoing Play-by-Mail Game\", and the 2006 Origins Award for Play By Mail Game of the Year).\n\nIn 1999 \"Pyramid\" magazine named \"Starweb\" as one of the \"Millennium's Best Games\". Editor Scott Haring said \"\"Starweb\" is the king of [play-by-mail games] -- the industry's most popular and longest running. ... Beautifully balanced, with a design so well-polished it gleams.\"\n\n\n"}

It took over Shokosha Watch Research Institute (founded in 1918) and some facilities of the assembly plant opened in Yokohama in 1912 by the Swiss watchmaker Rodolphe Schmid. \n\nThe brand Citizen was first registered in Switzerland by Schmid in 1918 for watches he sold in Japan. The development of this brand was supported in the 1920s by Count Gotō Shinpei with his hope that watches could become affordable to the general public. The growth of Citizen until World War II relied on technology transfer from Switzerland.\n\nCitizen launched the world's first multi-band atomic timekeeping watch in 1993 and has remained a pioneer of this field. Synchronized to atomic clocks, these watches are accurate to within one second in one hundred thousand years.\n\nThe Skyhawk A-T line features radio-controlled timekeeping. The watches can synchronize with radio clocks in Japan, North America, and Europe, automatically selecting the correct frequency by location. The watch actually tracks two time zones—home and world—but synchronizes to the 'home' zone. When traveling, the user may swap the 'home' and 'world' zones, thereby enabling proper time signal reception on a different continent while retaining the other time. The day, date, and daylight saving time settings are set automatically when the watch is synchronized. These features are comparable to the synchronization with atomic clocks found in Casio Wave Ceptor watches.\n\nThe Perpetual Chrono A-T synchronizes with the atomic clocks in Colorado or Germany, depending on signal strength and location, and incorporates Eco-Drive technology, so it does not require a battery.\n\nIn 2010, Miyota (Citizen Watch) of Japan introduced a newly developed movement (UHF 262 kHz) that uses a three-prong quartz crystal for the Precisionist or Accutron II line, a new type of quartz watch with ultra-high frequency (262.144 kHz) which is claimed to be accurate to +/− 10 seconds a year and has a smooth sweeping second hand rather than one that jumps each second.\n\nAccurate to within five seconds per year, the Chronomaster line is unofficially the most accurate quartz-crystal watch ever made. They are currently sold only in the Japanese domestic market but can be obtained internationally if ordered online.\n\nCitizen also produces the Independent Watches line, featuring a more modern, contemporary design than the traditional Citizen label. Depending on the market, these watches may be labelled \"Secret\", \"Lighthouse\" brands among others.\n\nThe Deployant Clasp with a Push Button (DCP) is a clasp available for many Citizen watch bracelet bands. The clasp, as with the Calibre 8700, is also used with leather bands as if they were metal bracelet-style watchbands; however, when the clasp is fastened, the band appears to be a normal eye-hole and link pin leather watchband.\nEco-Drive watches use a battery recharged by a solar panel hidden under the watch face. In the rare and discontinued Eco-Drive Duo series, the solar power was supplemented by an automatic quartz power source. One early model, called the Citizen Vitality, used the watch hands to drive a small electric generator, but was discontinued following complaints that the device could explode and cause wrist injuries. There was also an Eco-Drive Thermo model that exploited temperature differentials between the wearer's skin temperature and ambient temperature to recharge the battery. However, the only Eco-Drive system described on the Citizen Watch official website is the one depending solely on light to recharge. Features similar to the Eco-Drive have been developed by other manufacturers like Casio and Junghans. All Citizen Eco-Drive movements are made in Japan but the case or the bracelet may also be made in China.\n\nQ&Q SmileSolar are a line of solar powered watches, which do not require a battery change. They are made of recycled materials and have a water resistant rating of 10 Bar. The line of watches also supports people by making a donation for each watch purchased.\n\nCitizen also manufactures calculators and small electronic organizers. Some non-watch devices such as handheld televisions and computer printers, have been marketed under the Citizen brand name.\n\nIn the 1980s, a number of handheld electronic games were sold under the Q&Q brand.\n\nIn the early-mid 1990s, Citizen partnered with Compaq Computer Corporation to build notebook computers in Japan for the Japan and Far Eastern market to be sold under the Compaq name.\n\nOn January 10, 2008, Citizen bought the Bulova Watch Company for $250 million, making The Citizen Group the world's largest watchmaker.\n\nIn 2016, Citizen acquired the Swiss Frédérique Constant Group.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The culture existed from 3300 to 2000 BC. The Majiayao culture represents the first time that the upper Yellow River region was widely occupied by agricultural communities and it is famous for its painted pottery, which is regarded as a peak of pottery manufacturing at that time.\n\nThe archaeological site was first found in 1924 near the village of Majiayao in Lintao County, Gansu by Swedish archaeologist Johan Gunnar Andersson, who considered it part of the Yangshao culture.\nFollowing the work of Xia Nai, the founder of modern archaeology in the People's Republic of China, it has since been considered a distinct culture, named after the original site, whereas previously it had been referred to as the \"Gansu Yangshao\" culture.\nThis culture developed from the middle Yangshao (Miaodigou) phase, through an intermediate Shilingxia phase.\nThe culture is often divided into three phases: Majiayao (3300–2500 BC), Banshan (2500–2300 BC) and Machang (2300–2000 BC).\n\nAt the end of the 3rd millennium BC, the Qijia culture succeeded the Majiayao culture at sites in three main geographic zones: eastern Gansu, central Gansu, and western Gansu/eastern Qinghai.\n\nMajiayao phase (3300–2500 BC) sites are mostly found on terraces along: the upper Wei River valley; upper Bailong River valley; middle and lower Tao River and Daxia River valleys; upper Yellow River valley; the Huangshui River; and lower Datong River.\n\nThe most distinctive artifacts of the Majiayao culture are the painted pottery. During the Majiayao phase, potters decorated their wares with designs in black pigment featuring sweeping parallel lines and dots. Pottery of the Banshan phase is distinguished by curvilinear designs using both black and red paints. Machang-phase pottery is similar, but often not as carefully finished. Its development is associated with interaction between hunter-gatherers in the Qinghai region and the westward expansion of agricultural Yangshao people.\n\nIn contrast to plain pottery, the Majiayao painted pottery was produced at large, centralised workshops. The largest Neolithic workshop found in China is at Baidaogouping, Gansu. The manufacture of large amounts of painted pottery means there were professional craftspeople to produce it, which is taken to indicate increasing social complexity. Control over the production process and quality declined by the Banshan phase, potentially due to greater demand for pottery to use in funeral rituals, similar to what Hung Ling-yu calls the \"modern Wal-Mart syndrome\".\n\nThe oldest bronze object found in China was a knife found at a Majiayao site in Dongxiang, Gansu, and dated to 2900–2740 BC.\nFurther copper and bronze objects have been found at Machang-period sites in Gansu.\nMetallurgy spread to the middle and lower Yellow River region in the late 3rd millennium BC.\n\nScholars have come to the conclusion that the development of the Majiayao culture was highly related to climate changes. A group of scholars from Lanzhou University have researched climate changes during the Majiayao culture and the results indicate that the climate was wet during 5830 to 4900 BP, which promoted the development of early and middle Majiayao culture in eastern Qinghai province. However, from 4900 to 4700 BP, the climate underwent droughts in this area, which may be responsible for the decline and eastward movement of prehistoric cultures during the period of transition from early-mid to late Majiayao culture.\n\nThe transition from Yangshao to Majiayao coincides, climatically, with the Piora Oscillation.\n\n\n"}

In Britain he hosts the talk show \"The Last Leg\". He has been nominated for an Edinburgh Comedy Award and Gold Logie Award.\n\nBorn in Sydney, he began performing as a stand-up comedian in 1989 at the age of 19, and since 1997 has produced ten solo shows which have toured internationally. He has performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and the Montreal Just for Laughs festival, earning three consecutive Edinburgh Award nominations for his Edinburgh shows in 2001, 2002 and 2003.\n\nIn 2002, he scored a minor hit in Australia with his single \"Working Class Anthem\", in which he sang the lyrics of the Australian National Anthem to the tune of \"Working Class Man\", a song by Scottish-born Australian rocker Jimmy Barnes.\n\nHills first appearance in comedy scene was in 1989 at the Sydney Comedy Store. He did breakfast radio on SAFM in Adelaide besides stand-up gigs, and by the mid-1990s he decided to focus on live comedy. In 1997 he premiered \"Stand Up and Deliver\", the first of 10 solo shows, all of which have toured internationally. He has travelled widely, performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and the Montreal Just For Laughs festival. He has been nominated for three consecutive Edinburgh Comedy Awards for his 2001, 2002 and 2003 solo shows at the Edinburgh Fringe.\n\nThe title of his 2001 show, \"Go You Big Red Fire Engine\", was coined during a 1999 performance in Melbourne. Hills asked an audience member to yell his name to the audience and for the audience to yell it back, but instead the man yelled \"Go you big red fire engine!\" The phrase quickly became an audience chant, and Hills promised he would make it the name of his next show because, he says, \"it was such an uplifting and genuinely silly moment.\" \"Go You Big Red Fire Engine\" later became the name of a second stand-up show and a comedy album; it also appeared in a Detroit newspaper, on a Swedish website and was yelled by Senator Natasha Stott Despoja in the Australian Parliament.\n\nHis artificial right foot is commonly used as a source of humour in his shows and the comedian has been known to remove it and pass it around. However, Hills had been performing live comedy for over a decade before he made reference to his prosthesis on stage, and it was only after \"Go You Big Red Fire Engine\" was nominated for a Perrier Award in 2001 that he began incorporating it into his act. Hills says he felt he could too easily have become a novelty act and that he \"didn't want to be known as the one-legged comedian ... I wanted to prove myself as a comic before talking about this.\"\n\nHills regularly performs alongside Leanne Beer, an Auslan sign interpreter at his festival shows, a move sparked by a performance he did in Adelaide at a disability art conference. An interpreter had been provided at the show, and Hills found that it not only allowed the deaf audience members to enjoy his material but was also an entertaining and fascinating experience for the hearing audience members. \"Now I have hearing people who will only book [for sign interpreted shows]\", he says.\n\nHis influences are Chris Addison, Greg Fleet, Rich Hall, Daniel Kitson, Ross Noble and David O'Doherty.\n\nHills hosted the music trivia show \"Spicks and Specks\" from its premiere in 2005.

This was aired on 20 September 2013, as part of the channel's 1980s-themed \"Back to the Future\" weekend of programmes. He was credited under the name \"Adam C. Hills\" in a tribute to the original presenter, William G. Stewart. In 2014, Hills returned to present four more celebrity specials; a full daytime series was hosted by Sandi Toksvig.\n\nIn August 2013, Hills set viewers of \"The Last Leg\" a challenge to see if they could get away with editing his Wikipedia page and filling it with misinformation. This led to some short-lived vandalisation of his page as well as vandalism on the pages of his co-hosts Alex Brooker and Josh Widdicombe, and also several guests who appeared in later shows of that run—most notably that of Boris Johnson, the mayor of London.\n\nIn 2016, Hills voiced Buddy Pendergast in \"Thunderbirds Are Go\".\n\nIn 2002, Hills released a single titled \"Working Class Anthem\", in which he sang the lyrics of the Australian National Anthem, \"Advance Australia Fair\", to the tune of \"Working Class Man\", a famous song by iconic Australian rocker Jimmy Barnes. Around 40 comedians contributed to the song, which made the independent top 10 in Australia. All proceeds went to the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council, an organisation supported by Barnes and Jon Bon Jovi that supports firefighters. Hills has performed the song several times on television, including a performance honouring Barnes' guest appearance on \"Spicks and Specks\".\n\nBetween 2003 and 2005, Hills wrote as a columnist for the BBC's disability website \"Ouch!\".\n\n\nHills was born in the southern Sydney suburb of Loftus. Hills was born without a right foot and wears a prosthesis, which has become a frequent source of comedy in his act. He studied for a Bachelor of Arts (Communications) at Macquarie University, graduating in 1991.\n\nIn December 2009, Hills married opera soprano Ali McGregor. They have two daughters and live in London.\n\nHills participated in the Australian version of the program \"Who Do You Think You Are?\"; his episode debuted on 2 April 2013 and explored Hills's Austrian and Maltese roots, with a Maltese ancestor of his turning out to be a pirate.\n\nHills is a supporter of his hometown rugby league club the South Sydney Rabbitohs.\n\nIn 2017, he set up the Warrington Wolves Physical Disability rugby league team. In August 2018, he played in their World Club Challenge vs South Sydney Rabbitohs winning 34–12.\n\nIn February 2020 Hills became Ambassador for The Children's Trust, a British charity for children with brain injury and neurodisability. He first became involved with The Children's Trust when he visited the charity in 2014 to meet Seb, a nine-year-old boy who had a severe brain injury and leg amputation following a road traffic accident. \nHe has also supported five annual comedy shows at The Comedy Store for the charity.\n\nIn April 2020, Australia Post released a set of stamps recognising Australian Legends of Comedy, with Hills appearing on one of the stamps.\n\n"}
{"id": "2236885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236885", "title": "Industrial Party Trial", "text": "Industrial Party Trial\n\nThe Industrial Party Trial (November 25 – December 7, 1930) (, Trial of the \"Prompartiya\") was a show trial in which several Soviet scientists and economists were accused and convicted of plotting a coup against the government of the Soviet Union.\n\nNikolai Krylenko, deputy People's Commissar (minister) of Justice, assistant Prosecutor General of the RSFSR and a prominent Bolshevik, prosecuted the case. The presiding judge was Andrey Vyshinsky, later Krylenko's opponent who became notorious as the prosecutor at the Moscow Trials in 1936-1938.\n\nThe defendants were a group of notable Soviet economists and engineers, including Leonid Ramzin, Osadchy (Осадчий), Charnovsky (Чарновский), Fedotov (Федотов), Larichev (Ларичев), Ochkin (Очкин), Sitnin, Kalinnikov, and Kupryanov. They stood accused of having formed an anti-Soviet \"Union of Engineers’ Organisations\" or \"Prompartiya\" (\"Industrial Party\") and of having tried to wreck the Soviet industry and transport in 1926-1930.\n\nIn a related development, a number of prominent members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (Yevgeny Tarle, Sergei Platonov, Nikolay Likhachov, Sergei Bakhrushin, etc.) were arrested in 1930. They were mentioned during the \"Industrial Party\" trial as co-conspirators. However, no subsequent trial took place and they were quietly exiled to remote areas of the country for a few years.\n\nThe Industrial Party Trial was the first post-NEP trial in which the defendants were accused of plotting a coup against the Soviet regime. The plot was supposedly hatched by emigre Russian industrialists in Paris, and allegedly involved the governments of France, England and some smaller countries like Latvia and Estonia. For participating in the coup France would supposedly be rewarded with parts of Ukraine while the English would get a share in the Caucasus oil. Upon the arrival of the invasion forces the defendants would sabotage Soviet industry and create chaos in the transportation networks (charges of this kind were to become standard in later show trials of the 1930s). The trial was also notable in that it was the first Soviet show trial at which the defendants \"confessed\" their supposed crimes, including co-operating with the Prime Minister of France Raymond Poincaré. The latter had to issue a public refutation, published in \"Pravda\", which was presented at the trial as an additional \"proof\" by the prosecution.\n\nThe prosecution stated that \"the Industrial Party consisted of the top old engineering-technical intelligentsia, of major specialists and professors, who held privileged positions during the capitalist regime\". According to the prosecution, all of the organization's members had been raised in the bourgeois environment and hence were alien to the Soviet system, which served to reinforce an important point of contemporary Soviet propaganda.\n\nIt was also alleged that \"Indparty\" wreckers had deviously moved beyond direct, crude, easily recognizable sabotage to \"wrecking\" in the areas of planning and resource distribution. Virtually any conceivable course of action could be construed as wrecking: for example the engineers' decision to invest in a particular area could be construed as wrecking by withholding resources from other vital areas, while by the same token their decision to not invest could also be construed as wrecking: the opportunity cost of any decision could be used to indicate guilt. In other words, the engineers were made scapegoats for well known economic problems in various areas of Soviet industry.\n\nThe trial was a refinement of the Shakhty Trial in 1928 and an important precursor to the Moscow Trials of the late 1930s. In one of those minor glitches that would plague later trials, Ramzin was accused of having plotted with Russian emigre industrialist Pavel Ryabushinsky in 1928 even though Ryabushinsky had died in 1924.\n\nOn December 7, five defendants were given the death sentence, which was commuted to long prison terms, while other defendants were sentenced to different terms in prison.\n\nDuring his imprisonment, Ramzin was allowed to continue working. He was amnestied in 1932 and eventually showered with Soviet awards (the 1943 Stalin Prize, the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labour ) for his scientific work, especially the Ramzin straight-flow boiler. In February 1936 some other defendants were also pardoned. Two years later, in January 1938, the prosecutor, Nikolai Krylenko, was arrested and shot during the Great Purge.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was voted out of existence by its village board in order to provide a site for the National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), which was selected by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission on December 16, 1966.\n\nWeston was predated by a 100 home subdivision named West Field, which was on the verge of growing in size due to a proposed development for 50,000 people. However, DuPage County sued developer William Riley in order to prevent the town from incorporating, basing their challenge upon a technicality, and further stated that as it had not properly incorporated that the town had no legal right to annex land for development. In April 1964, four months after the town's initial unveiling, the project had collapsed and the developer had filed for bankruptcy, blaming the county's lawsuit. Had construction proceeded as planned, the town would have contained the largest mall in North America, with some 2,000 stores within it. The town also was to have an airport, more than 11,000 homes, an athletics fields, a town center, and even large man-made lakes.\n\nThe subdivision was taken over by DuPage County, allowing the few existing residents to remain. The residents then worked again to incorporate as a town in an attempt to free themselves from DuPage County control, eventually seeking help from the Federal Government through the US Atomic Energy Commission. The National Academy of Sciences also made a visit to the site of the community, and in 1966, after much controversy from within both the community and the surrounding county, the community was chosen as the site for the new National Accelerator Laboratory. Shortly after, it was revealed that the town would be contained within the laboratory's boundaries, meaning that the community's residents had to sell their homes to the State of Illinois, and the community of Weston ceased to exist.\n\nThe former residences are currently being used as offices and residences for the international collaborators with Fermilab who are based with an academic institution. Most of the houses are still an \"academic village\", and are still in use to this day.\n\n"}

Through the pages of Völkischer Beobachter these architects actively attacked the modern style in openly racist and political tones, placing much of the blame on members of the architectural group The Ring, calling Walter Gropius an \"elegant salon-bolshevist\", and calling the Bauhaus \"the cathedral of Marxism\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2236909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236909", "title": "Blood type personality theory", "text": "Blood type personality theory\n\nA pseudoscientific belief exists in Japan and South Korea, that a person's ABO blood type is predictive of a person's personality, temperament, and compatibility with others. This superstition is similar to how astrological signs are perceived as influencing factors in a person's life in other countries.\n\nOne of the reasons Japan developed the blood type personality indicator theory was in reaction against ethnic stereotypes coming from Europe. The popular belief originates with publications by Masahiko Nomi in the 1970s.\n\nAlthough some medical hypotheses have been proposed in support of blood type personality theory, the scientific community generally dismisses blood type personality theories as a superstition or pseudoscience because of lack of evidence or testable criteria. Although research into the causal link between blood type and personality is limited, research does not demonstrate any statistically significant association between the two. Some studies suggest that there is a statistically significant relationship between blood type and personality, although it is unclear if this is simply due to a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nThe idea that personality traits were inherited through the blood dates as far back as Aristotle. Hippocrates also sought to link personality biologically, linking traits with the four bodily humors — sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric and melancholic.\n\nIn 1926, Rin Hirano and Tomita Yashima published the article \"Blood Type Biological Related\" in the \"Army Medical Journal\". It was seen to be a non-statistical and unscientific report motivated by racism.\n\nIn 1927, Takeji Furukawa, a professor at Tokyo Women's Teacher's School, published his paper \"The Study of Temperament Through Blood Type\" in the scholarly journal \"Psychological Research\". The idea quickly took off with the Japanese public despite Furukawa's lack of credentials, and the militarist government of the time commissioned a study aimed at breeding ideal soldiers. The study used ten to twenty people for the investigation, thereby failing to meet the statistical requirements for generalizing the results to the wider population.\n\nOn the other hand, in 1934, Fisher announced the chi-squared test, which is very popular at present, for the first time. Several scholars said that they found statistically significant differences analyzing Japanese work conducted at that time.\n\nIn another study, Furukawa compared the distribution of blood types among two ethnic groups: the Formosans in Taiwan and the Ainu of Hokkaidō. His motivation for the study appears to have come from a political incident: After the Japanese occupation of Taiwan following Japan's invasion of China in 1895, the inhabitants tenaciously resisted their occupiers. Insurgencies in 1930 and in 1931 resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Japanese settlers.\n\nThe purpose of Furukawa's studies was to \"penetrate the essence of the racial traits of the Taiwanese, who recently revolted and behaved so cruelly.\" Based on a finding that 41.2% of Taiwanese samples had type O blood, Furukawa assumed that the Taiwanese rebelliousness was genetic. His reasoning was supported by the fact that among the Ainu, whose temperament was characterized as submissive, only 23.8% had type O. In conclusion, Furukawa suggested that the Japanese should increase intermarriage with the Taiwanese to reduce the number of Taiwanese with type O blood.\n\nInterest in the theory faded in the 1930s. It was revived in the 1970s with a book by Masahiko Nomi, a journalist with no medical background (he graduated from the engineering department of University of Tokyo). Few Japanese psychologists criticized him at that time, so he continued to demonstrate statistically significant data in various fields and published several books with these results. Quite some time after his death in 1981, Masahiko Nomi's work was said to be largely uncontrolled and anecdotal, and the methodology of his conclusions was unclear. Because of this, he was heavily criticized by the Japanese psychological community, although his books remain popular. His son, Toshitaka Nomi, continued to promote the theory with a series of books and by running the Institute of Blood Type Humanics. He later established the Human Science ABO Center for further research and publication in 2004.\n\nKengo Nawata, a Japanese social psychologist, statistically analyzed three data sets of over 10,000 Japanese and American people in total. However, 65 of the 68 items yielded non-significant differences between blood types and the other three items showed relatively slight relationships. Therefore, the blood type explained only 0.3% of the whole differences of these data sets. This result suggests that blood type explained very little of people's personalities. Nawata came to the conclusion that there is actually no relevance of blood type for personality.\n\nHowever, some academic researchers have shown several statistically significant data in Japan and Korea. Akira Sakamoto and Kenji Yamazaki, Japanese social psychologists, analyzed 32,347 samples of annual opinion polls from 1978 through 1988. These results indicated that Japanese blood-typical stereotypes actually influenced their self-reported personalities—as a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nCosy Muto and Masahiro Nagashima et al. (Nagasaki University) conducted a supplementary survey of Yamazaki and Sakamoto in 2011. They demonstrated that significant and the same difference on personalities between blood-types by using the same database as Samamoto and Yamazaki used. In the 1990s, difference due to blood types was stabilized and variances became smaller. Then in the 2000s, difference was definitely statistically significant, too. However, the effect magnitude was extremely small, despite 'significance' in the statistical sense.\n\nAnother Japanese social psychologist, Shigeyuki Yamaoka (Shotoku University), announced results of his questionnaires, which were conducted in 1999 (1,300 subjects) and 2006 (1,362 subjects), In both cases, the subjects were university students, and only subjects with enough knowledge of and belief in the \"blood-type diagnosis\" showed meaningful differences. He concluded that these differences must be the influence of mass media, especially TV programs. Yamaoka later examined 6,660 samples from 1999 through 2009 in total and found the same result.\n\nOn the other hand, there are opinions that the statistically meaningful differences according to the blood types are not explained only by beliefs, nor are they a self-fulfilling prophecy. In Japan, penetration rate of blood-typical personality traits were investigated. Yoriko Watanabe, a Japanese psychologist (then Hokkaido University), chose \"well-known\" traits and found most traits were known to no more than half of Japanese (subjects were university students). A Japanese writer, Masayuki Kanazawa, analyzed these blood-typical traits in combination with data from Yamaoka (1999) that used the same items of Watanabe's penetration survey. If blood-typical differences are caused by penetration (or their self-recognition), the rate of difference of a trait is proportional to the rate of its penetration. However, Kanazawa was not able to discover any association with blood-type differences and penetration rates. This result raises doubt about the role of beliefs and self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nMost reports that demonstrated statistical correlation attribute differences to a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, there is no study that directly proved the existence of \"self fulfillment\". Therefore, opinions of researchers are varied at present:\n\nThe Five Factor Model tests were carried out in several countries, including Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, after the year 2000. These tests were intended to digitize self-ratings of the \"big five\" personality traits. It was expected that differences in self-reported personalities (a self-fulfilling prophecy) would be detected from the subject who believed blood-typical stereotypes. As a result, researchers found no meaningful statistical difference.\n\nSo Ho Cho, a Korean psychologist (Yonsei University), and the others carried out a questionnaire about blood-typical items to subjects and discovered statistical differences as expected. However, the difference was not found when the Five Factor Model for big five personality traits was administered to the same subjects. Another Korean researcher Sohn (Yonsei University) re-analyzed Cho's data. He found that several independent items of the big five personality test detected differences according to each blood-typical stereotype. However, these differences became extinct in the process of plural items being gathered to five factors (big five).\n\nIf these results are correct, the Five Factor Model test cannot detect differences between the blood types, if such a causal link did indeed exist. The phenomenon is not reported when using the MBTI personality index.\n\nKim and Yi (Seoul University of Venture & Information) measured brain waves of 4,636 adults. They reported that type O people were most stress-resistant. In addition, an experiment using light topography instruments by Munetaka Haida (Tokai University School of Medicine) suggests the possibility that activated parts of human brain are different according to blood types. i.e. type A's left brain is superior to the right, while type B's right brain is superior.\n\nIn Japan, discussion of blood types is widely popular in women's magazines as a way of gauging relationship compatibility with a potential or current partner. Morning television shows feature blood type horoscopes, and similar horoscopes are published daily in newspapers. The blood types of celebrities are listed in their es on Japanese Wikipedia. A series of four books that describe people's character by blood type ranked third, fourth, fifth and ninth on a list of best-selling books in Japan in 2008 compiled by Tohan Corporation.\n\nNo less than two-thirds of people in several East Asian countries and areas, such as Japan, Korea and Taiwan, believe in the association between blood types and personality.\n\nIn addition, according to one Japanese survey, more than half of Japanese people are fond of talking about blood type and personality. The research also says that people in Japan like blood-typical personality diagnosis and 1. talk about it with proper knowledge, 2. believe some relationships exist between blood type and personality, 3. feel its traits are applicable to themselves to a certain degree. Results of two other surveys are the same.\n\nAlthough there is no proven correlation between blood type and personality, it remains popular with the many matchmaking services that cater to blood type. In this way, it is similar to the use of astrological signs, which is also popular in Japan. Asking one's blood type is common in Japan, and people are often surprised when a non-Japanese does not know their own blood type.\n\nIt is common among anime and manga authors to mention their character's blood types and to give their characters blood types to match their personalities. Some video game characters have known blood types. In addition, it is common for video game series to allow for blood type as an option in their creation modes.\n\nFacebook in many Asian countries allows users to include their blood type in their profile.\n\nAfter then-Reconstruction Minister Ryu Matsumoto's abrasive comments towards the governors of Iwate and Miyagi forced him to step down from his post, he partially blamed his behavior on his blood type, saying \"My blood is type B, which means I can be irritable and impetuous, and my intentions don't always come across.\"\n\nBlood types are important in South Korea as well. The Korean webcomic \"A Simple Thinking About Blood Type\" depicts the stereotypes of each blood type, and has been adapted as a short anime series in Japan as \"Ketsuekigata-kun!\" in 2013 and 2015.\n\nBlood type harassment, called \"bura-hara\" (wasei-eigo: a portmanteau of \"blood\" and \"harassment\"), has been blamed for bullying of children in playgrounds, loss of job opportunities, and ending of happy relationships.\n\nMany people in Asia have been discriminated against because of their blood type. Employers ask blood types during interviews despite the warnings they have been given. Children at schools have been split up according to their blood type. The national softball team has customized training to fit each player's blood type. Companies have given work assignments according to their employee's blood type.\n\nHowever, these episodes are thought to be more or less exaggerated—as well as horoscope addiction in Europe or the US, which is sometimes reported in Japan. No blood-type harassment trials have been reported, so far. In reality, most Japanese people don't think blood types \"determine\" their personalities, but affect it in \"some\" degree.\n\n\nDr LAURENT: \"4groupes sanguins, 4 personnalités\" Marco Pietteur ed. 2007/2014.

He was previously the Chairman of the governing People's Action Party (PAP) after Lim Boon Heng stepped down from the position from 2011 to 2018. He was previously the Minister for Health from August 2004 to May 2011 and the Minister for National Development from May 2011 to September 2015. He has been a Member of Parliament (MP) since 2001.\n\nBorn in Federation of Malaya (modern-day Malaysia) to a Malaysian Chinese family, Khaw moved to Singapore in 1977 and began his career in the Singapore Civil Service, working at the Ministry of Health.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1987, Khaw served as the first Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the National University Hospital. He also worked in the Kandang Kerbau Women's and Children's Hospital, and the Singapore General Hospital.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1995, Khaw served as the Principal Private Secretary to Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong (who is currently Emeritus Senior Minister)\n\nFrom 1995 to 2001, he served as the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\nKhaw contested in the Tanjong Pagar GRC during the 2001 general election and was successfully elected to be a Member of Parliament. He was given the role of acting Minister for Health from 1 August 2003 before being promoted to a full Minister in August 2004.\n\nAs Minister for Health, Khaw played a key role in combating the SARS epidemic that happened between February to June 2003, which put a strain on and tested Singapore's public health resources.\n\nKhaw was also noted for his role in handling the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) scandal, and made Gerard Ee the new Chairman of the NKF following the resignation of T. T. Durai. Responding to a report by international auditing firm KPMG in Parliament in December 2005, Khaw vowed to punish all wrongdoers in the saga and heavily criticised NKF's \"bizarre HR policies\".\n\nIn a parliamentary speech on 9 February 2009, in the context of tackling the rising healthcare costs, Khaw suggested that Singaporeans can consider sending their elderly parents to nursing homes in Johor Bahru in Malaysia, which is a developing country located close to Singapore. This was quoted by news reports and a public outcry ensued. Khaw subsequently clarified that his statement was quoted out of context by the media and his suggestion was only one of the many choices available to Singaporeans.\n\nIn 2010, Khaw wrote on his blog explaining that his heart bypass surgery had only cost him a mere $8 (SGD) in cash in a class A ward, as the rest of the cost was offset by payments combined from his universal Medishield account and private insurance. This sparked off a debate in the public sphere, with many questioning if an ordinary Singaporean had the means to pay for such high insurance premiums as he did in the first place. Members of the pro-PAP group, Silent No More, defended Khaw's claim and encouraged one another to rebut Internet users who had made jibes at Khaw.\n\nFollowing the 2011 general election where the ruling PAP garnered its lowest vote share of 60.1% since independence, Khaw was appointed the Minister for National Development. At a press conference, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong revealed that Khaw had volunteered for this new role as the public was extremely unhappy with the Government's housing policy, and Khaw felt that he had the ability to solve the problem. In his new appointment, Khaw assured the public that he will make housing affordable and accessible to all Singaporeans. In his 2013 budget debate, he said:\n\n“We can now pause and see what else we can do to bring Build-to-Order (BTO) prices in non-mature estates to, say, around four years of salary as it was before the current property cycle started.”\n\nThough the relative prices of Build To Order (BTO) flats have fallen since Khaw's speech, most of the flats still cost more than four years of an applicant's salary. The prices of new flats remain high despite six rounds of cooling measures. In January 2013, a seventh round of property cooling measures was introduced to moderate the increase in residential and industrial prices.\nIn July 2012, National Parks Board's (NParks) purchase of 26 Brompton bikes costing $2,200 each sparked a nation wide uproar after it was revealed by a whistleblower on online forum HardwareZone of possible corruption due numerous red flags in the way the procurement was done. Khaw, who initially defended NPark's purchase of the high-end foldable bikes, was criticised for handling the saga poorly. Subsequent investigation by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau resulted in National Parks Board assistant director Bernard Lim Yong Soon being fined $5,000 for lying to auditors about his relationship with the bicycle firm which was awarded the tender.\n\nHe also led the initiative to encourage cycling in the city state, such as through transforming the Park Connector Network for use by people on bikes as well as walking.\n\nDuring a parliamentary session on 12 February 2015, Khaw spoke on the Auditor-General's findings on the opposition-run Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council's alleged financial irregularities.\nIf an auditor makes such a finding on a listed company, it will immediately cause consternation among the shareholders, and a call for the removal of the CEO and the Board of Directors. In Japan, the Chairman and CEO would hold a press conference and take a deep bow. And in the good old days, they may even commit \"harakiri\".\nThe quote on committing seppuku (harakiri) when top leaders make mistakes became part of Singapore’s political lexicon as various irregularities and lapses of other government agencies started surfacing, along with the persistent train breakdowns under Khaw's Transportation portfolio in later years.\n\nKhaw came under fire in 2015 when it was revealed that a site in Sengkang designated for religious use was awarded to a commercial company to develop a columbarium instead. Residents of an upcoming BTO public housing project in the vicinity demanded a refund as they did not know they would have to live next to a columbarium. Responding to opposition MP Lee Li Lian's questions in Parliament, Khaw acknowledged the oversight and used the Butterfly Lovers analogy to explain how \"tender procedures have not caught up with time ... the (HDB) officers assessing the tender just assumed that it must be a company affiliated to some religious organisation\". The columbarium plan was eventually aborted.\n\nOn 28 September 2015, it was announced that Khaw will be the Co-ordinating Minister for Infrastructure as well as the Minister for Transport from 1 October 2015, taking over a portfolio that has been under heavy public scrutiny. Khaw wrote on his blog that he did not volunteer for the \"thankless\" job, but accepted it nevertheless as he put the nation's interest above his own.\n\nA key tenet of Khaw's transport policy is his vision of transforming Singapore into a car-lite city by 2030, which includes building a \"smarter, greener and more inclusive transport system\". He has stated publicly that 75% of trips should be made by public transport by 2030.\n\nKhaw has also advocated for the use of driverless buses to tackle the manpower crunch. Three towns in Singapore will introduce these new vehicles by 2022.\n\nTwo SMRT trainees were killed on 22 March 2016 in the Pasir Ris rail accident, after they were hit on the tracks by an oncoming train near Pasir Ris station. They were investigating a possible signalling fault on the tracks. The driver of the oncoming train was not informed of their presence on the tracks.\n\nKhaw received flak for his insensitive Facebook post on 23 March 2016 for a conflated post celebrating 150 days of no train service disruptions for the new Downtown Line while offering condolences to the two SMRT staff killed.\n\nA coroners’ inquiry was convened to investigate on the causes of the accident and whether it was due to human error. SMRT admitted that safety procedures were not adhered to, which was in breach of the Workplace Safety and Health Act.\n\nOn 5 July 2016, Hong Kong based investigative news agency, FactWire broke news about 35 SMRT trains being secretively shipped back to China for repair by manufacturer CSR Sifang Locomotive & Rolling Stock Company Ltd. It was reported that cracks were found in the structure connecting the car body and the bogie. After remaining silent for a week, Khaw came out to explain that the cracks were not safety issues and that the news could result in “undue panic” during a briefing at the Bishan Depot. He criticised the news agency for mischief and even suggested that Singapore is a victim caught in the rivalry between political factions in Hong Kong and China.\n\nFactWire noted that instead of taking responsibility for an incident which has damaged the Singaporean public’s trust in the authorities, Khaw chose to blame the news agency for exposing the cover up. FactWire defended its reporting and denied allegations of political interference. In an open letter to Khaw on 14 July, the agency maintained that it is funded by the Hong Kong public and that its reporting is independent of commercial or political considerations.\n\nKhaw had indicated in March 2017 that public transportation fares were set to increase and a fare review will be conducted by the Public Transport Council (PTC). Rationalizing the move, Khaw said that operating costs have been increasing, rendering the current fare structure \"unsustainable\" despite subsidies from the government. He further stressed the need to strike a \"fair balance\" in the proportion of transport costs between commuters, the government and the transport operators.\n\nKhaw's comments were met with discontent among the public, with many questioning if transport fare increases have been tied to service improvements, and whether there is a need for a fare hike when the transport operators have been generating profitable growth.\n\nOn 7 March 2018, Khaw pushed for a review of the current fare formula and transfers. However, fares will be reviewed depending on the economic and market conditions. Currently, the \"bus service must not be the same as the preceding bus service\" is abolished and became a transfer.\n\nOn 27 July 2017, at a forum on infrastructure management, Khaw stated that train reliability has improved three times since he took over. He was subsequently criticised online by commuters who had experienced persistent breakdowns in the same period. Khaw had derived his statistics based on preliminary data excluding all delays caused by re-signalling works. Other online sources suggest that Khaw may have used a positive-sounding \"Mean Kilometre Between Failures\" metric to back up his claims, instead of the industry-standard \"Mean Time Between Failures\" metric.\n\nKhaw further berated the Singapore press for reporting extensively on the MRT breakdowns, criticizing them for \"turning tabloid\", \"publishing frightening figures\", and magnifying the problem to which he has no solution. He added that if solving the problem was as simple as \"holding a pen and writing a few articles\",\nmembers of the media should run the transport system instead and Singapore does not need any engineers.\n\nOn 26 September, leaders from Singapore's Inter-Religious Organisation were invited by Khaw to bless Downtown Line (DTL) 3 amidst mounting frustrations against frequent train disruptions. Despite this, DTL 3 suffered its first disruption lasting 40 minutes during a pre-opening launch on 15 October 2017, where commuters were invited for free rides. Responding to media queries the following day on the disruption, Khaw remarked, \"Sometimes things will happen … For it to happen when we are doing an open house, that is bad luck\".\n\nIn response to various problems with the Light Rail Transit (LRT) system, Khaw acknowledged that the Bukit Panjang LRT Line was not well-planned and built \"in such a masochistic manner\" as it was \"an afterthought due to political pressure\". He added that taking the LRT was an \"uncomfortable\" ride and he felt \"dizzy\" on the train, which he said was akin to taking a roller-coaster in Singapore.\n\nThe LRT system has been slated for an overhaul under Khaw's tenure.\n\nOn the evening of 7 October 2017, the tunnels along the North South MRT line (NSL) were flooded as a result of a malfunctioned pump. The flood caused train services on the NSL to be disrupted for 20 hours. Khaw addressed the media 9 days later, holding the SMRT maintenance team responsible for failing Singaporeans. He revealed that the rainwater sump pit at the Bishan station can hold up to 5000 cubic metres of rain, at least seven times more than the amount of rain that had fallen in the catchment on that day, implying that the pit had not been maintained for quite some time. He added that a joint decision by LTA and SMRT had been made to replace the pump just a week prior to the flood, blaming bad fortune, he said, \"but I supposed that is life\".\n\nOn 19 October 2017, the Singapore Democratic Party issued a strongly worded statement calling for Khaw to step down as Minister of Transport. In the letter, the party charged that Khaw has failed to stop the recurring breakdowns and other serious lapses all these years, signalling his incompetence and lack of leadership. It said, rather than shifting the blame to everyone else, as the Minister for Transport, he must take responsibility for the ongoing fiasco and resign.\n\nResponding to mounting public pressure and the intense media scrutiny on the constant train breakdowns and tunnel flooding, Khaw delivered a 47-minute Ministerial Statement in Parliament on 7 November 2017. The parliamentary sitting was attended by SMRT's senior management, which included CEO Desmond Kuek and Chairman Seah Moon Ming. In his speech, Khaw offered no apology, but expressed sadness and embarrassment on the continuous bad publicity received. He revealed that anti-flooding pumps at Lavender and Kembangan stations were also found to be in non-serviceable condition, and maintenance records might have been falsified since 2016. Khaw also disagreed with opposition chief Low Thia Khiang's charge that SMRT's main aim is to \"make money for the government\" at the expense of commuters, saying that \"there are many other simpler ways to make money\".\n\nKhaw also stated in Parliament that the tunnel's pumps are not critical components and insisted that there is no shortcomings or lapses in regulatory oversight by LTA or MOT staff. As such, a public inquiry into the matter in the form of a Committee of Inquiry need not be convened. A poll conducted by market research company Blackbox, however, showed that 69% of Singaporeans felt a public inquiry into the incident should have been held.\n\nIn the same poll, more than half of Singaporeans felt SMRT CEO Desmond Kuek should resign. Defending Kuek's performance in Parliament, Khaw said, \"he wasn’t parachuted in or being asked to go and fix this, he volunteered for this job. As the former Chief of Defence Force, I know his heart is in the right place\". However, members of the public questioned Khaw's choice of the word \"volunteer\" given that Kuek is paid $1.87 million per annum, and whether there is a proper selection process at SMRT given that Kuek, a former Singapore Armed Forces Lieutenant-General and civil servant, had no experience running a company in engineering or rail operations before joining SMRT.\n\nKhaw further suggested that the responsibility of SMRT's failures, including that of poor work culture, vests in the CEO. He also believed that they could have avoided the fiasco if Temasek Holdings had appointed Seah Moon Ming to replace Koh Yong Guan as the SMRT chairman earlier, at his recommendation. Khaw claimed that he had slept for less than 20 hours in total over the past month, which has cost him his personal health and family life.\n\nSpeaking at the inaugural Public Transport Workers Appreciation Day on 14 November 2017, Khaw further criticised SMRT's maintenance team responsible for the tunnel flooding, saying that they had \"tarnished the reputation of Singapore and Singaporeans\", and \"brought disrepute\" to other transport workers. The saga led to the sacking of 8 SMRT employees and legal action is expected to commence.\n\nKhaw added that longer engineering hours were required and therefore train operating hours would have to be shortened. Soon after, it was announced on 21 November 2017 that train services at 17 stations along the EWL would have to be suspended for two Sundays in December 2017.\n\nAn MRT train collided with another at Joo Koon station at approximately 0818 hours (SST) on 15 November 2017. It was initially reported that the accident caused 28 people to sustain injuries and they were taken to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and the National University Hospital. Of the 28 injured, 2 were SMRT staff (including the driver) and 3 had to remain warded in hospital for observation. The collision caused massive delays on the East West MRT Line. More commuters sought treatment thereafter, which saw the number of injured rising to 38.\n\nSpeaking to the media hours after the accident occurred, Khaw said he was \"deeply sorry\" and it was \"an awful day\". It was revealed at a press conference that the collision occurred due to an \"inadvertent removal\" of a signalling software protection feature. Train services between Joo Koon and Tuas Link station had to be suspended for four days to allow signaling contractor Thales to conduct further assurance checks. The last train collision occurred over 2 decades ago in 1993 which resulted in 156 injured.\n\nOn the same morning, commuters experienced long delays on Circle MRT Line due to a door fault, which caused station platforms to be overcrowded and commuters venting their frustration on Twitter. The fault took more than two hours to resolve.\n\nIn the evening of the same day, train services on the North South MRT Line were delayed as well. SMRT's announcement stated that the delays were “due to fewer trains” and commuters need to add 40 minutes of train travel time. The delay is expected to extend till the following morning.\n\nIn support of Khaw following the train collision, Law Minister K Shanmugam wrote on Facebook on 16 November 2017 that he was \"confident\" Khaw had the ability to \"sort things out\". Prime Minister Lee acknowledged that the constant MRT breakdowns \"have hurt public confidence\", but spoke in support of Khaw at the PAP convention on 19 November 2017. Lee added that Khaw had \"our full support and confidence\" and claimed that Singapore's public transport system remained first-class.\n\nAccording to a statement from SMRT and LTA, the protective \"bubble\" around the first train was \"unexpectedly disabled\" when it passed a trackside device, which was not compatible with the new signalling system. The second train failed to keep safe distances from the first train as it moved forward automatically. Speaking to reporters at a press conference on 21 November, Khaw said that Thales, the provider of the new signalling system, \"could have done better\" to avoid the Joo Koon collision. Khaw asserts that if one disregards the collision and the flooding incident, SMRT was \"actually making good progress\" with regards to train operation.\n\nA poll of 1000 Singaporeans conducted by market research company Blackbox from 10 to 16 November 2017 revealed that 65% of the public felt the public transportation system was \"not well run\". 60% of respondents were \"not confident\" that the current situation will improve soon, and 57% felt that they had not been \"kept informed and told the truth\" about these lapses.\n\nKhaw has been a Member of Parliament since 2001 where his first represented Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency (Tanjong Pagar GRC) from 2001, before transferred to Sembawang GRC to succeed outgoing minister and MP Tony Tan in 2006, who later served as Singapore's 7th President from 2011 to 2017.\n\nIn 2011, Khaw took over outgoing minister Lim Boon Heng as the party's chairman, and in 2018 his role was taken over by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.\n\nKhaw attended and graduated from Chung Ling High School.\n\nIn 1973, he was awarded the Colombo Plan scholarship from Singaporean Ministry of Education to study a combined degree program in engineering and commerce at the University of Newcastle in Australia. He graduated in 1977 with a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours Class I) and Bachelor of Commerce.\n\nHe received his Master of Science degree in industrial engineering in 1982 from the National University of Singapore and received his Doctor of Engineering \"honoris causa\" from the University of Newcastle in 2002.\n\nKhaw is of Malaysian Chinese descent. He is a Buddhist and a self-professed \"religious man\". In 2010, Khaw underwent a heart bypass operation and after his recovery, it was reported that he had switched to a vegan diet, avoiding all meat, fish and dairy products. In March 2019, Khaw underwent an arm operation for a fracture that took place a month earlier. During this period, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan took over the role as Acting Transport Minister.\n\nKhaw is also known to the public for his strikingly similar looks to Singaporean actor Henry Thia, a fact Thia often acknowledges by jokingly referring to Khaw as his twin.\n\n"}

The screenplay is by Nick Castle and James V. Hart, with a story by Paul Castro and Castle. It involves an 11-year-old musical prodigy living in an orphanage who runs away to New York City. He begins to unravel the mystery of who he is, all while his mother is searching for him and his father is searching for her. The many different sounds and rhythms he hears throughout his journey culminates in a major instrumental composition which concludes the film (\"\"August's Rhapsody\"\").\n\nIn 1995, Lyla Novacek is a cellist studying at the Juilliard School and living under the strict rule of her father. Louis Connelly is the lead singer of an Irish rock band. They meet and have a one-night stand but are unable to maintain contact. Lyla discovers that is she is pregnant. Following an argument with her overbearing father over her unborn baby, she is struck by a car forcing her to give birth prematurely. While Lyla is unconscious, her father puts the baby boy up for adoption, telling Lyla that her son died.\n\nEleven years later, the baby is living in a boys' orphanage under the name Evan Taylor, where he is assigned to a social worker named Richard Jeffries. Evan is a musical genius and displays savant-like abilities and perfect pitch, which is often a causes Evan to be bullied. Convinced that his parents will find him, Evan runs away to New York City, \"following the music\" in the hope it will lead him to his family. He finds a boy named Arthur busking in Washington Square Park and follows Arthur to his home in a condemned theatre where Evan is introduced to “Wizard” Wallace, an arrogant and aggressive vagrant and musician who teaches homeless and runaway children to be street performers. Evan tries playing Wizard's prize guitar, Roxanne (a Gibson J150ec), Evan is so good that Wizard gives him his old spot in Washington Square Park, along with the guitar, which was also Arthur's. He gives Evan the stage name \"August Rush\" and tries to market him to clubs. Seeing the posters that Jeffries has placed for the runaway Evan, Wizard destroys all the ones he finds, hoping to keep Evan for his own gain.\n\nLouis now lives in San Francisco as an agent while Lyla is a music teacher in Chicago. Louis reconnects with his brothers and decides to try to find Lyla. Lyla is called to her father's deathbed, where he confesses that her son is alive, causing Lyla to abandon her dying father and immediately start looking for her son.\n\nOn arriving at Lyla's apartment in Chicago, Louis talks to one of her neighbors, who mistakenly tells Louis she is on her honeymoon. Despairing, he ends up in New York, where he gets his band back together. After Jeffries meets Wizard and Arthur on the street and becomes suspicious, the police raid the derelict theatre in which Wizard and his \"children\" are living. Evan manages to evade the police and remembers Wizard’s advice to never reveal his real name to anyone. Evan (now \"August\") takes refuge in a church where he befriends a little girl named Hope, who introduces him to the piano and written music. Hope brings August and his abilities to the attention of the parish pastor, who takes August to Juilliard where he once again impresses the faculty. A rhapsody takes shape from August's notes and homework.\n\nIn New York, Lyla goes to Jeffries' office, and Jeffries identifies Evan/August as her son. While looking for him, she takes up the cello again and accepts an offer to perform with the Philharmonic at a series of concerts in Central Park. August is selected to perform the rhapsody he has been composing at the same concert. However, Wizard interrupts the rehearsal and claiming to be his father, manages to pull August out of the school.\n\nOn the day of the concert, August is back in his spot in Washington Square, while Wizard makes plans to smuggle him around the country to play. He meets Louis and, unaware of their blood relationship, they have an impromptu guitar duet. August tells him of his dilemma, and Louis encourages him to go. That evening, with help from Arthur, August escapes from Wizard through the subway and heads for his concert. Louis, after his own performance with his reunited band, sees Lyla's name on one of the banners and also heads for the park. Jeffries finds a misplaced flyer for \"August Rush\" with a picture, and also heads for the concert.\n\nAugust arrives in time to conduct his rhapsody, which attracts both Lyla and Louis to the audience, where they are reunited. August finishes his rhapsody and as he turns to discover his parents, he smiles knowing that he has been right all along.\n\n\n\nThe final number with Lyla and Louis begins with Lyla playing the Adagio-Moderato from Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto in E Minor.\n\nExcept for \"Dueling Guitars\", all of August's guitar pieces were played by American guitarist-composer Kaki King. King's hands are used in close-ups for August Rush.\n\nComposer Mark Mancina spent over a year and a half composing the score of \"August Rush\". \"The heart of the story is how we respond and connect through music. It's about this young boy who believes that he's going to find his parents through his music. That's what drives him.\" The final theme of the movie was composed first. \"That way I could take bits and pieces of the ending piece and relate it to the things that are happening in (August's) life. All of the themes are pieces of the puzzle, so at the end it means something because you've been subliminally hearing it throughout the film.\" The score was recorded at the Todd-AO Scoring Stage and the Eastwood Scoring Stage at Warner Brothers.\n\n\"August Rush\" received mixed to negative reviews from film critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 37% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 110 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \"Though featuring a talented cast, \"August Rush\" cannot overcome the flimsy direction and schmaltzy plot.\" On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 38 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally negative reviews\".\n\nIn a review by \"USA Today\", Claudia Puig commented that \"\"August Rush\" will not be for everyone, but it works if you surrender to its lilting and unabashedly sentimental tale of evocative music and visual poetry.\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reviewed the film positively, writing \"the story is about musicians and how music connects people, so the movie's score and songs, created by composers Mark Mancina and Hans Zimmer, give poetic whimsy to an implausible tale.\"\n\nPam Grady of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" called the film \"an inane musical melodrama.\" Grady said \"the entire story is ridiculous\" and \"Coincidences pile on, behavior and motivations defy logic, and the characters are so thinly drawn that most of the cast is at a loss.\" Edward Douglas of comingsoon.net said it \"does not take long for the movie to reveal itself as an extremely contrived and predictable movie that tries too hard to tug on the heartstrings.\"\n\nRoger Ebert gave the movie three stars, calling it \"a movie drenched in sentimentality, but it's supposed to be. The movie also came to a very sudden end leaving it unfinished.\"\n\nA few critics suggested that the film is essentially a musical adaptation of Dickens' \"Oliver Twist\".\n\nDespite the mixed reception, \"August Rush\" was praised for its music. The song \"Raise It Up\" was nominated for Best Original Song at the 80th Academy Awards, but lost to \"Once\".\n\nA musical theatre adaptation of \"August Rush\" premiered on May 3, 2019, at the Paramount Theatre in Aurora, Illinois. The book was written by Glen Berger, the music was composed by Mark Mancina, and the lyrics were written by both Berger and Mancina. The play was directed by John Doyle.\n"}

Guardado played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins (–, ), Seattle Mariners (–), Cincinnati Reds (–), and the Texas Rangers (Two separate stints in and ). He was named as a bullpen coach for the Minnesota Twins in 2014.\n\nHis common nickname is \"Everyday Eddie\", a testament to his durable arm during his first stint with the Twins. Over Eddie's career, he appeared in 908 games. Only 22 other pitchers have appeared in more games.\n\nFor several years the Twins attempted to use him as a starter, but in 1996 he was converted to exclusively a relief pitcher and did not start another Major League game. That season, he led the American League in games pitched with 83. In September 2001, Guardado became the Twins' closer, replacing LaTroy Hawkins. In 2002, he broke Rick Aguilera's 11-year-old Twins team record for games saved, saving 45 regular-season games. He followed that up with 41 saves in 2003. After that season, he became a free agent, signing with the Seattle Mariners.\n\nIn 2004, Guardado saved 18 games with a 2.78 earned run average, but suffered a torn rotator cuff and missed the last two months of the season. In 2005, he set the Mariners' record for consecutive saves at 27, which was later broken by J. J. Putz. On May 4, 2006, after three blown saves in less than three weeks, Guardado was temporarily removed from the closer role with the Mariners. Manager Mike Hargrove stated, \"We're going to back off Eddie as far as being the closer right now. We'll try to pitch him in less pressure situations. Just back him away from the edge and see if we could get his confidence up.\" On July 6, 2006, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds and converted eight of his first nine save situations. In August, Guardado was placed on the disabled list after he blew out his throwing elbow.\n\nFor 2007, Guardado signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training by the Cincinnati Reds. He made his season debut on August 9 after an intense rehab, giving up two hits and a sacrifice fly that allowed the Los Angeles Dodgers to tie the game at 4-4. They eventually won 5-4 in 11 innings.\n\nOn January 11, 2008, he signed with the Texas Rangers. On August 25, 2008, Guardado was traded back to the Minnesota Twins for minor league pitcher Mark Hamburger. On February 3, 2009, Guardado returned to the Texas Rangers on a minor league contract and was invited to spring training. Guardado pitched for the Texas Rangers in 2009, and went 1-2 with a 4.46 ERA in 48 relief appearances.\n\nAfter considering retirement during the 2009-10 offseason, Guardado decided to come back to baseball by agreeing to terms on a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals on December 26, 2009. On March 11, 2010, Guardado was released by the Nationals. In August, he acknowledged that his playing days had come to an end, saying \"I'm looking to add another chapter in my life, and that's to be a father to my three children, which I absolutely love.\" Over his career, he went 555 games without allowing a triple, dating to the end of his career. The last person to hit a triple off Guardado was Tony Graffanino back in September 1999.\n\nGuardado previously served as a special assistant for the Twins during Spring Training and coaches minor league pitchers.\n\nOn January 25, 2013, Guardado was elected to the Twins Hall Of Fame along with long-time Media Relations Director, Tom Mee.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, he was the head coach for the Tustin, California Little League All-Stars. On November 19, 2014, Guardado was named bullpen coach for the Minnesota Twins.\n\nOn January 6, 2015, Guardado received no votes on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot and so falls off the ballot for future elections.\n\nHe is married to Lisa Limbaugh and the couple have three children. Their oldest son, Niko, is a cast member on the 2020 TV series \"Party of Five.\"\n"}
{"id": "2236984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2236984", "title": "Late fee", "text": "Late fee\n\nA late fee, also known as an \"overdue fine\", \"late fine\", or \"past due fee\", is a charge fined against a client by a company or organization for not paying a bill or returning a rented or borrowed item by its due date. Its use is most commonly associated with businesses like creditors, video rental outlets and libraries. Late fees are generally calculated on a per day, per item basis.\n\nOrganizations encourage the payment of late fees by suspending a client's borrowing or rental privileges until accumulated fees are paid, sometimes after these fees have exceeded a certain level. Late fees are issued to people who do not pay on time and don't honor a lease or obligation that they are responsible for.\n\nLibrary fines, also known as overdue fines, late fees, or overdue fees, are small daily or weekly fees that libraries in many countries charge borrowers after a book or other borrowed item is kept past its due date. Library fines are an enforcement mechanism designed to ensure that library books are returned within a certain period of time and to provide increasing penalties for late items. Library fines do not typically accumulate over years or decades. Fines are usually assessed for only a few days or months, until a pre-set limit is reached.\n\nLibrary fines are a small percentage of overall library budgets, but lost, stolen or un-returned library books can be costly for various levels of government that fund.\n\nIn recent years, many libraries have stopped charging fines. The Public Library Association and the Association of Library Services to Children have asked libraries to reconsider policies that keep low-income teens away for fear of fines. Many libraries also offer alternatives and amnesties in order to encourage patrons to return overdue books. \"Food for Fines\" programs, in which borrowers donate canned food in exchange for fine forgiveness, are common in libraries all over the world. Some libraries offer children and teens the option to \"read down\" their fines by reducing fines based on the amount of time spent reading or the number of books read. Other libraries may block access to library privileges until materials are returned. Librarians have had a longstanding debate over whether or not to charge late fines.\n\nThe American Library Association’s Policy 61 entitled, “Library Services to the Poor,” highlights the removal of all barriers to library and information services, particularly fees and overdue charges”. Other researchers have argued for waiving fees if it is a barrier for continued use of the library. It is imperative that the library staff understands the financial situation of the patrons it serves. This barrier to use—the fines that low-income people cannot afford—is an underlying problem that needs to be addressed. Gehner (2010) proposes that libraries work with the community to find out their need and to build relationships (p. 45). He also found that overdue fines could be a limiting factor, too. Since libraries face limited funding, fees and fines represent both a source of revenue and a barrier to use (p. 43).\n\nSome libraries have stepped up enforcement and collection of late fees. People who do not return library property after an extended period of time may face arrest or a negative action on their credit reports in some jurisdictions. Patrons have been arrested for not returning library books in Colorado, Washington state, Iowa, Wisconsin and Texas. Punitive measures such as these are typically used to recover stolen library property, not to enforce late fees.\n\nA special use of the term late fee is additional postage that was once required by Post Offices to allow inclusion of a letter or package in the outgoing mail dispatch although having been posted later than the normal closing time for mail. Often a special Late Fee Box was provided.\n\nLate fees charged by banks, landlords, and utilities have been heavily criticized as a penalty against the poor, and attempts have been made in some places to outlaw them completely or place caps on them. The argument against them is that the poor will inevitably be forced to pay them as they cannot earn the money to pay their bills by the due date. These people will be forced to pay even higher fees for the same services, and will find making future timely payments to their creditors even more difficult.\n\n"}

(Some sources indicate that he was born in North Dakota, rather than in Montana.) The family relocated to Helena, Montana, when he was a youngster, and he graduated from high school there. He briefly attended Montana Wesleyan College (which later merged and became part of Rocky Mountain College), but quit to drive a tour bus at Yellowstone National Park.\n\nIn the early 1920s he moved to Los Angeles, California, and started working as an auto mechanic. His real-life experiences growing up on a horse ranch landed him bit parts in westerns from 1925, for Paramount Pictures. Studio executives suggested changing his name to Lane Chandler, and as such he began achieving leading roles opposite stars like Clara Bow, Greta Garbo, Betty Bronson and Esther Ralston. His first lead role was in \"The Legion of the Condemned\".\n\nAs a silent film star Chandler performed well, but when talkies arrived he was cast more in supporting roles, as in \"The Great Mike\" of 1944. He starred in a few low-budget westerns in the 1930s, but was more often cast as the leading man's partner, or saddle pal, or a sheriff or army officer. With the advent of television Chandler began making appearance on numerous series, often in Westerns such as \"The Lone Ranger\", \"The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok\", \"Lawman\", \"Have Gun – Will Travel\", \"Rawhide\", \"Maverick\", \"Cheyenne\", and \"Gunsmoke\". He continued acting on TV and in films through 1966, retiring comfortably due to his holdings in both residential and commercial properties. \n\nHe died in Los Angeles of heart disease in 1972, aged 73.\n\n\n"}

It was initially established in 1955 by the United States Forest Service for the study of the relationship between forest cover and water quality and supply.\n\nIn 1955 the first tract was dedicated in the Hubbard Brook watershed, just west of the village of West Thornton, New Hampshire. The first stream in the forest was fitted with monitoring devices in 1956. Subsequently, seven additional headwater streams and their associated watersheds were delimited for study. Each such zone functions essentially as a closed environmental system. Since efflux of water, minerals, and water-bound organisms leaving each watershed (and leaving the entire forest as well) can be monitored, the effects of changes experimentally introduced into the system can be measured.\n\nFor the first five or six years after its establishment the HBEF was used for research in forestry but soon its value for study of the forest ecosystem was recognized and it attracted the interest of researchers from major universities. The work at Hubbard Brook has led researchers there and elsewhere to try to model or better understand the complex forest ecosystem, including its interaction with humans. HBEF research teams have succeeded in elucidating a number of vexing environmental problems, most notably the harmful effects of acid rain. The forest preservation the research promotes helps to protect watershed chemistry, ambient humidity, seasonal temperature fluctuations, and wildlife habitats.\n\nThe idea for using the small watershed approach being used at Hubbard Brook for studies of elemental budgets and cycles was born with Professor F. Herbert Bormann of Dartmouth College, who began taking his botany classes for field trips to this area of the White Mountain National Forest in the early 1950s, and Forest Service scientist Robert Pierce. Bormann proposed to Pierce that the area set aside by the Forest Service for watershed studies be used for closed-system ecological studies.\n\nIn 1960, soon after the establishment of HBEF, ecologist Gene Likens and geologist Noye Johnson, both from Dartmouth, joined the research team. In 1963, the group received a $60,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to study \"Hydrological-Mineral Cycle Interaction in a Small Watershed\". This study evolved into the series of longitudinal studies now referred to as the \"Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study\", or HBES. The early ecosystem monitoring was aimed at studying the effects of forest management practices on water flow and quality. These data have been helpful as baselines for the increasingly sophisticated areas of ongoing research in the forest. HBES has spawned over 2000 scientific papers, perhaps most important a 1968 study that documented the widespread presence of \"acid rain\". HBRF was designated as a Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in 1988 and has some of the longest on-going ecological datasets.\n\nCurrently the study comprises researchers from multiple universities, including Dartmouth College, Yale University, Cornell University, Syracuse University, SUNY ESF, the University of New Hampshire, Keene State College and the University of Vermont. The Hubbard Brook Research Foundation provides housing for research assistants at nearby Pleasant View Farm and recently completed the purchase of cottages for visiting and resident scientists around Mirror Lake, the point at which Hubbard Brook exits the experimental forest.\n\nHubbard Brook Experimental Forest is the most recently added research forest under USFS jurisdiction for hydrologic studies in the eastern and southern United States. \n\nLocated in the White Mountain National Forest in central New Hampshire, within the town of Woodstock, the bowl-shaped forested valley has hilly terrain, ranging from in altitude. The forest comprises nine individual watersheds, each of which drains into Hubbard Brook which flows eastward into the Pemigewasset River near West Thornton. The outlet from Mirror Lake, a much-studied pond and recreation site, flows south into Hubbard Brook just before the brook passes under Interstate 93.\n\nThe forest is mostly a \"second-growth\" mix of northern hardwoods (80 to 90%) and red spruce-balsam fir (10 to 20%). Beech, yellow birch, and sugar maple experience their greatest importance at , , and , respectively, with paper birch, fir, and spruce at 720m to treeline (>). Mountain maple, striped maple, and mountain ash characterize the understory at various elevations, with mountain maple being ubiquitous. Five of the seven canopy species are valued for various reasons. Harsh winter conditions do not allow for rapid recovery, unlike more humid climates that recover net primary productivity within years, the northeastern version needs decades and in the case of the forest floor possibly centuries to recover. The forest was partly cleared for agriculture starting in the late 18th century and was also logged. By 1920 over 200 million board feet (470,000 m³) of timber had been harvested from the valley.\n\nSoil is predominantly well-drained spodosol derived from glacial till, with sandy loam textures, combining to produce an evident, but narrow E horizon. The forest floor is characterized by the complete suite of taxonomic subhorizons, has been classified as mor type humus, with mull occurring beneath maple stands at lower elevations (). It is acidic (pH about 4.5 or less) and relatively infertile for agricultural purposes. Aluminum and iron are preferentially leached from the upper soil horizons to an underlying layer(s) that is characteristic of the soil order. Hence, silica is retained and at times mixes with the forest floor. Soil depths are highly variable, with shallow strands of organic matter comprising the entire profile at higher elevations (folist) or underlain by sandy unsorted material (podzol).\n\nAnnual precipitation averages about , with one-third to one-quarter as snow. January averages about -9 °C and the average July temperature is 18 °C. The forest averages 145 frost-free days per year.\n\n\nThe Hubbard Brook Research Foundation supports the work of the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study, which is conducted at the USDA Forest Service's Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire's White Mountain National Forest. HBRF supports research by maintaining facilities for housing, meetings, and laboratory work. The Foundation also helps transmit the findings of the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study to policymakers, opinion leaders, and other members of the public through its \"Science Links\" program, which translates science from peer-reviewed scientific articles and conducts a variety of education and outreach activities.\n\nEach summer, Hubbard Brook scientists and experts from afar gather at the base station for a 2-day colloquium to present and discuss ongoing research. Approximately 150 scientists and students attend the program, which features eighty-odd 10-minute presentations in which participants openly criticize and contribute new ideas to each presenter's findings.\n\n"}

Home games were played at the EnergySolutions Arena. In 2013, the team did not submit proper documentation to remain in the AFL and the entire roster was reassigned to other teams in the league.\n\nIn September 2004, Commissioner C. David Baker announced that Salt Lake City, Utah was awarded an Arena Football League (AFL) franchise for the 2006 season. The Utah Blaze began play on January 28, 2006, on the road against the San Jose SaberCats. The team was coached by longtime Arizona Rattlers coach Danny White and played its home games at the EnergySolutions Arena in Salt Lake City, home of the National Basketball Association's Utah Jazz. The team was owned by automobile businessmen John Garff, Robert Garff, and Brett Hopkins.\n\nIn their first season, the Blaze had the highest average attendance in the Arena Football League, with 15,498 fans per game. They narrowly edged out Philadelphia's 15,463. Prior to the 2006 season, the Blaze had said EnergySolutions Arena held 13,000 fans due to poor sight lines in most of the building. After 16,705 people attended the home opener, that figure was changed to near 15,000. The Blaze topped that figure 5 of the 8 games their first season.\n\nThe offense was led by quarterback Joe Germaine and star wide receiver Siaha Burley. On Saturday, February 11, 2006, the Blaze lost to the New York Dragons 84–81 in the second highest scoring game in the history of the Arena Football League. The Blaze's performance was also the second highest score for a losing team in the AFL's 20-year history.\n\nDespite a losing record of 7–9, the Blaze got into the playoffs as an AC Wildcard (the conference's No. 6 seed). Unfortunately, the newly formed Blaze were given the boot as they lost to the Arizona Rattlers with a final score of 57–34.\n\nThe team's mascot was a dalmatian named \"Chief\". The Blaze were winners of the league\"Commissioners Award\" in 2006 and won the \"Support Staff of the Year Award\" in back-to-back seasons (2006–2007), an award that goes to the league's best training and equipment staff, which was headed by Hagen Featherstone and Kevin Seamans in the inaugural season and Kevin Seamans and Darin Featherstone in 2007.\n\nDuring the 2008 season the Blaze became the first, and only, professional football team to record three 1,500-yard receivers in the same season, with Huey Whittaker, J.J. McKelvey, and Aaron Boone. This also marks the first time three players each caught 120 or more passes in the same season.\n\nUpon the AFL's suspension of operations, the Blaze did so for the same time period.\n\nThe second Utah Blaze organization was originally the Utah Valley Thunder, a member of the American Indoor Football Association during the 2009 season. During their lone season in the AIFA, they were based in Orem, Utah, and played their home games at the McKay Events Center. They finished at a respectable 11–3, finishing second in the Western Division and qualifying for a playoff berth before losing to the Wyoming Cavalry in the Western Divisional playoff.\n\nOn September 28, 2009, the Thunder announced their intention to join Arena Football 1 for the 2010 season and beyond, also announcing relocation to the E Center (now Maverik Center) in West Valley City. Over two months later, on December 8, AF1 was awarded the original AFL's assets after they submitted the highest bid in a bankruptcy court auction. Current AF1 teams were given the right to adopt the former AFL teams' identities, but initially, Utah chose to brand as the \"Utah Thunder.\" The Blaze's previous owner attempted to claim the Blaze logo as his own, but was unsuccessful in doing so. Finally, on January 26, 2010, the team announced it would indeed be using the Blaze name and logo. Less than a month later, the AF1 announced it was going back to the former Arena Football League moniker.\n\nOn January 25, 2011, the team announced in a press release that they would be moving back to the EnergySolutions Arena.\n\nQuarterback Tommy Grady set the single season touchdown record throwing his 118th against the Georgia Force, on June 23, 2012. The Blaze also clinched their first winning season in franchise history during the 2012 season.\n\nFor the 2012 season the Blaze's defensive line was coined \"Sack Lake City\" due to their tremendous amount of pressure and quarterback sacks. In a game against the Iowa Barnstormers the Blaze recorded a league record 11 sacks in one game. Led by the combination of Caesar Rayford and Mike Lewis with 3.5 sacks each. In 2 seasons with the Utah Blaze the pair have recorded 3 All Pro Honors, along with 40 sacks combined.\n\nIn March 2013, Co-Owner Kristin Murdock sold her majority ownership share of the team to Salt Lake City businesswoman, Kim Brown.\n\nIn September 2013, the Arena Football League announced that the Utah Blaze had not submitted paperwork to the league committing for both the 2014 and 2015 seasons. As a result, the Blaze (along with the Chicago Rush) were removed from the league, with Commissioner Jerry Kurz stating, \"We fully expect both Chicago and Utah to return to become members of the AFL family again in the near future\".\n\nThe following Blaze players were named to All-Arena Teams:\n\nThe following Blaze players were named to All-Ironman Teams: \n\nThe following Blaze players were named to All-Rookie Teams:\n\n"}

A Game Boy Advance port was released in 2004. The GBA port was created independently of Namco, due to a licensing deal with Destination Software. The PAL release of the PS2 port came with a demo of on a separate disc. \n\nThe most distinguishing characteristic of \"Kill Switch\" is its cover system, a mechanic that has the player character taking cover behind objects and around corners in a manner similar to Namco's own \"Time Crisis\" series of light gun shooters as well as Koei's third-person shooter \"WinBack\" and Hideo Kojima's stealth game \"\". However, \"Kill Switch\" was the first third-person shooter to feature the cover system as its core game mechanic, though Gears of War would popularize it.\n\nProtagonist Nick Bishop (voiced by Marcus McCollum) is a super-soldier remotely controlled via direct neural connection by a man known only as \"Controller\" (voiced by Chuck McQuary) in a series of combat missions designed to bring \"the North\" and \"the West\" to war. Profiteer Archer (voiced by Adam Baldwin) plans to benefit by selling the technology used to control Bishop, who gives Controller headaches on recollection of suppressed memories featuring a woman and the phrase \"Say my name\". Moments before launching a biological warhead, Controller is killed by a surge triggered when a woman known as \"Duchess\" (voiced by Adrienne Wilkinson) seizes control of Bishop. Sent to attack Controller's base, Bishop's memories are eventually restored: the woman from his memories was his new wife, who Archer killed when he captured Bishop to sell the technology inside him. Freed, Bishop kills Archer in a final assault and walks away.\n\n\"Kill Switch\" received a wide range of reviews across all platforms, with the Xbox version receiving a score of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating “generally favorable reviews“, while the PC and PS2 versions received scores of 66 and 73 out of 100 respectively, indicating “mixed or average reviews“. Criticism was directed towards its thin plot and simplistic level design, while the gameplay mechanics, especially the cover system, were lauded and considered engaging. It was compared to the \"Time Crisis\" series. The Xbox version of the game was said to possess enhanced graphics over the PS2 version. GameSpot awarded the Xbox version a 6.9 out of 10.\n\nThe GBA version of the game was similarly received, with IGN calling it a \"solid portable action title\" and awarding it a 7.5 out of 10.\n\n\"Kill Switch\" is best remembered for its cover system as a core game mechanic, and for introducing the blind fire mechanic to the cover system. Several shooters took inspiration from \"Kill Switch\" and implemented similar cover systems. In the design of \"Gears of War\", lead developer Cliff Bleszinski of Epic Games credits \"Kill Switch's\" cover system as one of the influences they put into the game's design, as \"Kill Switch's\" lead designer Chris Esaki was employed by Epic Games and was involved in the development of \"Gears of War\".\n\nNaughty Dog's \"\", which began development in 2005 and was released in 2007, also took inspiration from \"Kill Switch\", which \"Uncharted's\" lead designers Evan Wells and Amy Hennig credited as inspiration for the game's cover system.

Both were active in school drama productions. He later went on to graduate from UCLA with a degree in music.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, Griffith aspired to be a musician rather than an actor. Instead after graduating from University of California, Los Angeles, he managed to find work in little theatres around Los Angeles, where the budding musician eased into a dual career of acting. He found success in the production \"They Can't Get You Down\" in 1939, but put his career on hold during World War II to serve with the United States Marine Corps. Following the war, Griffith switched from the stage to films when he appeared in the 1948 film noir picture \"Blonde Ice\". From then on, he enjoyed a lengthy career of supporting and bit roles (sometimes uncredited) in westerns and detective films.\n\nThough Griffith was generally cast as the outlaw in Western pictures, he managed to garner a few memorable \"good guy\" roles over his many years in Hollywood – Abraham Lincoln in both 1950's \"Stage to Tucson\" and 1955's \"Apache Ambush\", sheriff Pat Garrett in 1954's \"The Law vs. Billy the Kid\", and Davy Crockett in 1956's \"The First Texan\".

Coinciding with Gretzky's acquisition, the team also changed its uniforms and colours for 1988–89, scrapping the purple and gold associated with its co-tenant at the Great Western Forum, the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers, in favour of black and silver. Gretzky's presence signaled a dramatic on-ice turnaround for the Kings. Prior to his arrival via trade with the Edmonton Oilers on August 9, 1988, Los Angeles had the fourth-worst record in the NHL at 30 wins, 42 losses, and 8 ties. After Gretzky's first season with the Kings, however, they moved all the way up to fourth-best in the NHL, with a record of 42 wins, 31 losses, and 7 ties for 91 points. They also managed to defeat Gretzky's former team, the Oilers, in seven games in the Smythe Division Semifinal before falling victim to a four-game sweep at the hands of the eventual Cup champion Flames in the Division Final.\n\nFour years after Andy Van Hellemond became the first on-ice official to wear a helmet, the NHL also made helmets mandatory for its officials like it did with its players in 1979; like the ruling for players, any official that was not wearing a helmet before the ruling could also go helmetless if they so desired.\n\nMario Lemieux of the Pittsburgh Penguins won the Art Ross Trophy for the second consecutive season, leading the league with 199 points and recording all three of his eight point games in his career, with one of them happening during the playoffs.

This was the only season that there were four players that scored 150 or more points; Gretzky tallied 168, while Steve Yzerman and Bernie Nicholls totalled 155 and 150 points, respectively. This was also the only time that two teammates, Gretzky and Nicholls of the Los Angeles Kings, had hit the 150 point mark. Narrowly edging out Lemieux, Gretzky won his ninth Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's MVP, while Yzerman finished third in the balloting. Yzerman was voted by his fellow players as the NHLPA MVP, taking the Lester B. Pearson Award.\n\nNew York Rangers rookie Brian Leetch broke the record for goals by a rookie defenceman with 23.

{"id": "2237074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237074", "title": "MilkDrop", "text": "MilkDrop\n\nMilkDrop is a hardware-accelerated music visualization plugin for Winamp, which was originally developed by Ryan Geiss in 2001. It uses DirectX and intelligent beat detection to render iterated images which blend seamlessly. MilkDrop uses a complex system of interpolation to transition between presets gradually through time, creating a constantly changing visual experience.\n\nMilkDrop is an environment for running \"presets\", software which controls MilkDrop, and does not produce visualizations by itself.\n\nPresets are saved in .milk file format, typically in a subfolder of the MilkDrop plugin directory. Creating new presets is generally referred to as \"authoring\", or \"writing\", making the person that wrote a preset its author. Presets are distributed on the Internet through Winamp, the Winamp forums, and through the personal webpages of MilkDrop preset authors. A preset's title also doubles as its .milk save name, and usually includes the preset author or authors' pseudonym. MilkDrop presets often have more than one author, which is generally referred to as remixing or editing. A remix or an edit will often include these terms in the preset's title.\n\nA current .milk file is composed of four major different kinds of scriptable equations. These include per_frame and per_pixel equations, as well as custom shapes and custom waves.\n\nCode in the per_frame section is executed once for each frame, modifying variables which affect different parameters that can be passed to other areas of code. Trigonometric functions which modify MilkDrop's internal looping time variable, systems of logic, and interaction with the audio information received from Winamp or other applicable media player's Fast Fourier transform (FFT) can be used to govern how these parameters evolve through time.\n\nCode in the per_pixel section of MilkDrop is not actually re-evaluated at every pixel as the name would suggest, rather the screen is divided into a grid and the code is evaluated at each grid point. The pixels in-between these points interpolate their values from the surrounding four points on the grid. The size of the grid is 32×24 by default, but can be set higher or lower by the user. Per_Pixel equations allow the preset author to alter some of MilkDrop's parameters differently in certain areas of the screen based upon x and y values, distance from the center of the screen, and the angle.\n\nCustom shapes and custom waves each have variables which allow the author to change the shape, size, color, and location on screen, among other things. Shapes and custom waves each have internal per_frame code that affects these variables similarly to how per_frame equations affect the entire preset. Custom shapes and waves equations are included in MilkDrop version 1.04 and later. While initially MilkDrop allowed four custom shapes and waves, the latest version of the MilkDrop beta allows up to five custom shapes and five custom waves to be utilized per preset.\n\nMilkdrop is the successor of an earlier music visualization software by Ryan Geiss, the \"geiss plugin\" for Winamp, released around 1998. The \"geiss plugin\" did the real-time music visualization purely software rendered by utilizing the CPU effectively by highly optimized, hand-tuned assembly code.\n\nIn 2001 the first version of milkdrop was written, built around the now widely available GPU hardware. Ryan Geiss released 12 versions of MilkDrop between 5 November 2001 and 31 July 2003.\n\nOriginally closed source, version 1.04 Milkdrop's source code was released under the BSD license in May 2005. Geoff \"Redi Jedi\" Potter has taken up developing the program since 2005 and has released six beta versions.\n\nWith the availability of the source code, MilkDrop has been ported to many platforms: for instance to XBMC, a homebrew developed media player that can be downloaded for Xbox, PC, or as a LiveCD.\n\nprojectM is an implementation of MilkDrop using OpenGL in C++, and is released under the GNU LGPL. It is available as a plugin for Audacious, XMMS, Winamp, iTunes, Jack, PulseAudio, foobar2000, VLC media player and XBMC. The VLC versions 2.2.0 and higher no longer support the projectM plugin. It comes natively with Clementine, Poweramp, and Qmmp that are also available in the Play Store on Android.\n\nMilkDrop 2.0 was released in 2007, introducing Per Pixel Shader support. It is available with Winamp 5.5 or from projectM in their 2.0.1 version for use it with other players like the VLC media player. \"MilkDrop 2\" added DirectX 9.0 support and added the ability to use pixel shaders in its presets.\n\nThe source code for MilkDrop 2.25c has been released on 15 May 2013.\n\nIn 2011, Milkdrop was retrospectively described as \"\"the greatest single work of art produced during the naughties\"\".\n\nAccording to the Winamp main download page, the milkdrop plugin and its predecessor Geiss are the most downloaded plugins overall, with 2,737,890 and 4,686,010 downloads (on 10 August 2014), respectively.\n\nThe Flickernoise software for the Milkymist One video synthesizer is largely inspired by MilkDrop, and is compatible with MilkDrop presets to some extent.\n\n\n"}

Preer was known within the black community as \"The First Lady of the Screen.\"\n\nShe was the first black actress to earn celebrity and popularity. She appeared in ground-breaking films and stage productions, such as the first play by a black playwright to be produced on Broadway, and the first New York-style production with a black cast in California in 1928, in a revival of a play adapted from Somerset Maugham's \"Rain\".\n\nEvelyn Jarvis was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi on July 26, 1896. After her father died prematurely, she moved with her mother and her three other siblings to Chicago, Illinois. She completed grammar school and high school in Chicago. Her early experiences in Vaudeville and \"street preaching\" with her mother are what jump-started her acting career.\n\nAt the age of 23, Evelyn's first film role was in Oscar Micheaux's 1919 debut film \"The Homesteader,\" in which she played a sweet girl by the name of Orlean. Preer was promoted by Micheaux as his leading actress with a steady tour of personal appearances and a publicity campaign, she was one of the first African American women to become a star to the black community. Her most well-known film role is in Oscar Micheaux's \"Within Our Gates,\" (1920) in which Preer plays a school teacher by the name of Sylvia Landry who needs to raise money to save her school.\n\nShe continued her extremely successful career by starring in a total of 16 films. Micheaux developed many of his subsequent films to showcase Preer's extraordinary versatility. These included \"The Brute\" (1920), \"The Gunsaulus Mystery\" (1921), \"Deceit\" (1923), \"Birthright\" (1924), \"The Devil’s Disciple\" (1926), \"The Conjure Woman\" (1926) and \"The Spider's Web\" (1926). Preer had her talkie debut in the race musical \"Georgia Rose\" (1930). In 1931, she performed onscreen with Sylvia Sidney in the film \"Ladies of the Big House\". Her final film performance was as Lola, a prostitute, in Josef von Sternberg's 1932 film \"Blonde Venus\", with Cary Grant and Marlene Dietrich. Preer was lauded by both the black and white press for her ability to continually succeed in ever more challenging roles, \"...her roles ran the gamut from villain to heroine an attribute that many black actresses who worked in Hollywood cinema history did not have the privilege or luxury to enjoy.\" Only her film by Micheaux and three shorts survive. She was known for refusing to play roles that she believed demeaned African Americans.\n\nIn 1920, Evelyn Preer joined The Lafayette Players a theatrical stock company in Chicago that was founded in 1915 by Anita Bush, a pioneering stage and film actress known as “The Little Mother of Black Drama\". Bush and her acting troupe toured the US to bring legitimate theatre to black audiences at a time when theatres were racially segregated by law in the South, and often by custom in the North and the interest of vaudeville was fading. The Lafayette Players brought drama to black audiences, which caused it to flourish until its end during the Great Depression.\n\nBy the mid-1920s, Preer began garnering attention from the white press, and she began to appear in \"crossover\" films and stage parts. In 1923, she acted in the Ethiopian Art Theatre's production of \"The Chip Woman's Fortune\" by Willis Richardson. This was the first dramatic play by an African-American playwright to be produced on Broadway yet the plays repertory season only lasted two weeks. In 1926, Preer had a successful stint on Broadway in David Belasco’s production of \"Lulu Belle\". Preer supported and understudied the actress Lenore Ulric in the leading role of Edward Sheldon's steamy drama of a Harlem prostitute. She garnered acclaim in \"Sadie Thompson\" in a West Coast revival of Somerset Maugham’s play about a fallen woman.\n\nShe rejoined the Lafayette Players for that production in their first show in Los Angeles at the Lincoln Center. Under the leadership of Robert Levy, Preer and her colleagues performed in the first New York-style play featuring black players to be produced in California. That year, she also appeared in \"Rain\", a play adapted from Maugham's short story by the same name.\n\nPreer was also an accomplished vocalist, She performed in cabaret and musical theater where she was occasionally backed by such diverse musicians as Duke Ellington and Red Nichols early in their careers. Preer was regarded by many as the greatest actress of her time.\n\nEvelyn Jarvis was married twice. She first married Frank Preer (1886–1923) on January 16, 1915, in Chicago. She met her second husband, James Edward Thompson (1898–1960), when they were both acting with the Lafayette Players in Chicago. They married February 4, 1924, in Williamson County, Tennessee, Tennessee (while in Nashville).\n\nIn April 1932, Preer gave birth to her only child, daughter Edeve Thompson. Developing post-childbirth complications, Preer died of double pneumonia on November 27, 1932 in Los Angeles at the age of 36. Her husband continued as a popular leading man and \"heavy\" in numerous race films throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and died in 1960. Their daughter Edeve Thompson converted to the Roman Catholic Church as a teenager. She later entered the Sisters of St. Francis of Oldenburg, Indiana, where she became known as Sister Francesca Thompson, O.S.F., and became an academic, teaching at both Marian University in Indiana and Fordham University in New York City.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a Hughes HS-376 craft, and was launched from the Guiana Space Centre in December 2000 to join Astra 2A and Astra 2B at 28.2°E, where it remained for its active life.\n\nAs of February 2013, Astra 2D has carried no regularly active transponders.\n\nWhile active, most of Astra 2D's transponders were used to provide television channels available on the Sky Digital satellite service to both Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as the non-subscription service, Freesat. Provision of rights-sensitive broadcasts free-to-air was made possible by the satellite's beam that was tightly focused on Ireland and the United Kingdom. However, surrounding countries had the ability to pick up the signal (dependent on suitably sized satellite dishes) and so could still access Freesat from outside the UK. Some channels on 2D were encrypted with Videoguard (a proprietary encryption method by the NDS Group) and only Sky Digiboxes with valid cards, or standard hardware with non-approved (with respect to the Sky/NDS end-user contract) \"Dragon\", or \"T-Rex\" conditional-access module can decode these channels.\n\nThe BBC broadcast all of its domestic television channels (including BBC HD and the regional variations) from the Astra 2D satellite, except the BBC News Channel and BBC Parliament which broadcast from Astra 2A. All domestic BBC channels have been free-to-air since 29 July 2003.\n\nITV also broadcast all its television channels (including regional variations of ITV1, and STV and UTV) from the Astra 2D satellite. All ITV channels have been free-to-air from 1 November 2005, although some regions reverted to Free-To-View encryption in 2008 when their lease on one 2D transponder could not be renewed.\n\nChannel 4 broadcast most of its channels free-to-air from this satellite, including Channel 4, Channel 4+1, E4, More4 and Film4 along with their timeshift variants. All were unencrypted apart from the feeds of Channel 4, Channel 4+1, E4 and E4+1 intended for viewers in Ireland, which remain encrypted.\n\nFrom November 2008, Five began to transmit free-to-air for the first time on Astra 2D, using borrowed space on a BBC transponder, allowing the channel to join Freesat.\n\nWith a projected lifetime of 12 years, Astra 2D was expected to leave regular operational service towards the end of 2012 or the beginning of 2013 and so the Astra 1N satellite, designed for operation at Astra 19.2°E and launched in August 2011, was initially positioned at 28.2°E to temporarily replace Astra 2D until the start of service of its long-term replacement, Astra 2F, which was launched in September 2012.\n\nAstra 1N started commercial service at 28.2°E in October 2011 with transponder testing in October and November. Channels on Astra 2D started to transfer to Astra 1N in December with Channel 5 (plus 5* and 5USA), the Channel 4 family and ITV channels all moving to the new satellite over the next two months. On 24 February 2012 the last remaining channels on Astra 2D (the BBC channels) switched off and started transmission from Astra 1N.\n\nUntil June 2015, Astra 2D remained in position at 28.2°E, with no transponder activity. It was then moved and positioned at Astra 5°E in July 2015. In October 2015, Astra 2D was moved to 57°E alongside NSS-12. In December 2017 it was moved to 60°E. From May 2018 to July 2018, Astra 2D was moved west at 0.65°/day to Astra 5°E. From January 2020 to March 2020, Astra 2D was moved east at 0.9°/day back to 57.2°E, alongside NSS-12.\n\n\n"}

In the late 1940s he was the chief advisor to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) on international affairs. He was professor emeritus of history at Howard University.\n\nRayford Logan was born and raised in Washington, DC. He won a scholarship to Williams College, graduating in 1917. During the First World War he joined the U.S. Army, and served as a first lieutenant in the all-black 93rd infantry Division, which undertook operations with French troops. Once the war ended, Logan remained in France, absorbing both the culture and the language. He helped to co-ordinate the 2nd Pan-African Congress in Paris in 1921. He returned to the US in the early 1920s and began teaching at Virginia Union University, a historically black college in Richmond.\n\nDuring the United States' occupation of Haiti, he made a fact finding mission to Haiti to investigate educational efforts and published his findings in \"The Journal of Negro History\" in October 1930. The main findings indicated there was little improvement in education due to the choice of Southern white Marines as country administrators – men who had been raised with Jim Crow laws in the American South and had brought their prejudice with them to their new assignment in Haiti, a majority-black republic. The main improvement effort resulted in establishing agricultural schools, which were highly expensive and staffed by non-French speakers, so classes had to be translated. The funding provided to these schools dwarfed the amount given to the majority of academic schools.\n\nIn 1930 Logan started graduate studies at Harvard University, earning an MA in 1932 and a Ph.D. in 1936. Logan became a professor at Howard University, where he practiced as a historian from 1938 to 1965.\n\nIn 1932, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Logan to his Black Cabinet. Logan drafted Roosevelt's executive order prohibiting the exclusion of blacks from the military in World War II.\n\nIn 1950–51, Logan became Director of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH).\n\nLogan was the 15th General President of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity established for African Americans.\n\nLogan died of a heart ailment at Howard University Hospital, aged 85.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Capon met Enrico Fermi while she was a student in general science at the University of Rome. The couple married in 1928.\n\nThey had two children: a daughter, Nella (1931–1995), and a son, Giulio (1936–1997), named after Enrico's older brother, who had died in 1915. In 1936 Laura joined Ginestra Amaldi, wife of Edoardo Amaldi, to write a book relating alchemy and the nuclear transmutation performed by their mates.\n\nIn 1938, the Fermis emigrated to the United States to escape the anti-Jewish laws of the Fascist government of Benito Mussolini; Laura was Jewish. Though Fermi's prestige and membership in the Royal Academy of Italy could have mitigated the impact of the laws, they chose to leave instead. They traveled to Stockholm to receive Fermi's Nobel prize, and left from Stockholm for the United States, where Fermi had accepted a position at Columbia University. They were naturalized as Americans in 1944.\n\nIn 1954 Laura resumed writing. Her book \"Atoms in the Family\", about her life with Enrico, appeared shortly before he died of stomach cancer. \n\nIn August 1955 Laura traveled to Geneva for the International Conference for the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy which led to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Laura Fermi was the Official Historian of the Conference and published \"Atoms for the World\", reporting on its proceedings.\n\nHer book \"Illustrious Immigrants\" was about \"Many of Europe's most intelligent and best-trained men and women, who immediately became visible to middle class America as neighbors, teachers and colleagues\" in the years 1930 to 1941. They were, \"men and women who came to America fully made, so to speak, with their PhD's and diplomas from art academies or music conservatories in their pockets, and who continued to engage in intellectual pursuits in this country.\" She noted, \"Life was initially hard for many physicians, but it was the lawyers whose training proved least exportable and who most frequently had to find a new means of livelihood.\" Considering the extent of the influence of the immigrants, an evaluation of the impact of the migration is restricted to two fields: psychoanalysis and nuclear science.\n\nLaura Fermi died of cardiac arrest in 1977.\n\n\n\n"}

ST is short for \"standard\" and is usually in the range of 5\" in height. DX is short for \"deluxe\" and is usually much larger. In addition to the larger size, the DX versions usually came with more features such as separating parts and more complex weaponry, usually with launching projectiles.\n\nMany of these toys were re-released in the United States. Mattel sold a selection of Chogokin toys under the name \"Shogun Warriors\" in the late-1970s. Bandai America sold other Chogokin toys under the Godaikin line in the early-1980s. In the wake of a 1979 rumor of a boy choking to death on a missile fired from a \"Battlestar Galactica\" toy manufactured by Mattel, many of the later \"Shogun Warriors\" toys were modified to launch \"child-safe\" projectiles that would not injure children. The Godaikin releases were apparently targeted at an older audience and, as such, were largely identical to the original Japanese releases.\n\nThe use of die-cast metal in mass-market robot toys declined greatly after the 1980s, with PVC and ABS plastic becoming the only materials used in most cases. Chogokin toys produced today are usually fairly expensive, high-quality items aimed at collectors. \n\nBandai's Soul of Chogokin line is probably the most famous example of this trend, featuring updated versions of many toys first made by Popy in the 70s and 80s. The first \"SOC\" released was an updated Mazinger Z, and many other classic designs followed. The line is still going and has been recently expanded to include more modern robots, some of which did not have a pre-existing Chogokin toy. It is also a way to create new, more easily available mecha toys for older shows such as \"Dancouga- Super Beast Machine God\" and the Leopaldon from \"Spider-Man\".\n\nDebuting in 2000, the Souchaku Henshin series (also known as Armor Trans) is another contemporary Bandai line under the Chogokin banner. These action figures are made to a 5-inch scale, and feature tokusatsu characters from Kamen Rider, Metal Hero Series, and GARO. Souchaku Henshin figures feature multiple points of articulation, removable armor, and contain die-cast parts. Much like Soul of Chogokin, Souchaku Henshin features both recent characters as well as updates to classic ones.\n\nIn 2010, Bandai introduced Super Robot Chogokin, which is an affordable alternative to Soul of Chogokin. The \"SRC\" figures measure at approximately 140mm (14 cm) in height and have less die-cast parts, but boast more articulation and have a wider range of accessory options. The toy line not only features traditional robots such as Mazinger Z and Brave Reideen, but also robots from \"The King of Braves GaoGaiGar\", \"\" and the Super Sentai series.\n\nDue to success and notoriety in the toy collecting hobby, the term \"chogokin\" has become somewhat of a representative format for Japanese die cast robot toys. However, as ”超合金”(Chogokin) is registered trademark of Bandai, other companies have used the \"-gokin\" suffix, such as Takatoku Toys' Z-Gokin or Max Factory's Max Gokin line.\n\n\n"}

They became refugees after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and were forced to move to the Rafah camp in the Gaza Strip. Marzook was born there on 9 January 1951. He completed high school in Gaza, studied engineering in Cairo until 1976, and then looked for work in the Persian Gulf. He continued his studies in the U.S. obtaining a master's degree in construction management from Colorado State University and a doctorate in industrial engineering from Louisiana Tech.\n\nMarzook has been active in the Islamic political work since 1968, Marzook played a significant role in reorganizing Hamas after the mass arrest of its members in 1989. Israeli journalist Shlomi Eldar credits Abu Marzook's fundraising prowess, and his connections to donors in Europe and the US with saving the organization and developing its infrastructure in Gaza, including social service programs. Israel claims that some funds were used for attacks against Israel, a charge that Abu Marzouk denies. Abu Marzook was elected as the first Hamas political bureau chief in 1992, and since 1997 has been deputy chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau. Marzook founded the Islamic Association of Palestine.\n\nMarzook lived in Jordan from 1998 to 2001. He then moved to Damascus, Syria in 2001. As of 2012, Marzook lives in New Cairo, Egypt.\n\nIn the mid-1990s Marzook was arrested in JFK airport in the US, although no formal charges placed against him. Two months after his detainment, Israel filed a request for the United States to extradite him. Represented by Stanley L. Cohen, he spent the following 2 years fighting his case in the court system, but the final decision was for his extradition, after which Israel dropped its extradition request. With no formal charges against him the United States released him, but not wanting him to remain, the United States contacted numerous Arab countries to allow Marzook residency. All refused, except Jordan, which reportedly agreed under U.S. pressure. Cohen continues to legally represent Marzook.\n\nMarzook was listed as a Specially Designated Terrorist by the U.S. Treasury Department in 1995, and is currently on the renamed Treasury department Specially Designated National list under such alternative spellings of his name as Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, Sa'id Abu-Marzuq, Mousa Mohamed Abou Marzook, Musa Abu Marzouk, and Musa Abu Marzuk, and under the alias \"Abu-'Umar.\"\n\nIn 2002, a federal grand jury in Dallas returned an indictment against Marzook for conspiring to violate U.S. laws that prohibit dealings in terrorist funds. The indictment alleged that Marzook had conspired with the Richardson, Texas-based InfoCom Corporation and five of its employees to hide his financial transactions with the computer company. He allegedly invested $250,000 in InfoCom, with Infocom to make payments to Marzook based on the company's net profits or losses.\n\nIn 2004 Ismail Elbarasse was detained by police in Maryland west of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge after Baltimore County police officers said they saw a women (his wife) in the vehicle videotaping the Bridge (which included footage of the cables and upper supports of the main span). Elbarasse was an assistant to Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, and was named an unindicted co-conspirator by a grand jury in Chicago after authorities searched the home and vehicle of Elbarasse and found bank records belonging to Marzook, deputy chief of Hamas's political wing. A federal indictment charged Marzook in an alleged conspiracy that authorities said raised millions of dollars for Hamas.\n\nIn 2004, a U.S. court indicted him in absentia for coordinating and financing Hamas activities.\n\nIn April 2012, Marzook gave what was billed as his \"first-ever interview with a Jewish publication\", \"The Forward\". Marzook said that an agreement between Israel and the P.A. would have to be ratified by a referendum of all Palestinians, including those in Gaza. He would regard it as a hudna, or cease-fire, rather than as a peace treaty. If Hamas gained power, they would feel free to change provisions of the agreement. “We will not recognize Israel as a state,” he said. “It will be like the relationship between Lebanon and Israel or Syria and Israel,” that is, an armed truce. \n\n\"The Forward\" requested the interview, which took place over two days at Marzook’s home in New Cairo, Egypt. \"The Forward\" published responses to the interview from eight \"prominent observers of the Middle East peace process\", Laura Kam of The Israel Project, Israeli security analyst Yossi Alpher, Lara Friedman of Americans for Peace Now, Princeton University Professor Daoud Kuttab, Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, Arab-American activist Hussein Ibish, David Keyes of Advancing Human Rights and political scientist Nathan Brown.\n\nFollowing the eight-day cross-border battle between Israel and Hamas in November, 2012, Moussa Abu Marzouk said that Hamas would not stop making weapons in Gaza or smuggling them to the territory. According to the Associated Press, Moussa Abu Marzouk is the No 2 leader in Hamas.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2237139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237139", "title": "Basidiospore", "text": "Basidiospore\n\nA basidiospore is a reproductive spore produced by Basidiomycete fungi, a grouping that includes mushrooms, shelf fungi, rusts, and smuts. Basidiospores typically each contain one haploid nucleus that is the product of meiosis, and they are produced by specialized fungal cells called basidia. Typically, four basidiospores develop on appendages from each basidium, out of these 2 are of one strain and other 2 of its opposite strain. In gills under a cap of one common species, there exist millions of basidia. Some gilled mushrooms in the order Agaricales have the ability to release billions of spores. The puffball fungus \"Calvatia gigantea\" has been calculated to produce about five trillion basidiospores. Most basidiospores are forcibly discharged, and are thus considered ballistospores. These spores serve as the main air dispersal units for the fungi. The spores are released during periods of high humidity and generally have a night-time or pre-dawn peak concentration in the atmosphere.\n\nWhen basidiospores encounter a favorable substrate, they may germinate, typically by forming hyphae. These hyphae grow outward from the original spore, forming an expanding circle of mycelium. The circular shape of a fungal colony explains the formation of fairy rings, and also the circular lesions of skin-infecting fungi that cause ringworm. Some basidiospores germinate repetitively by forming small spores instead of hyphae.\n\nBasidiospores are generally characterized by an attachment peg (called a hilar appendage) on its surface. This is where the spore was attached to the basidium. The hilar appendage is quite prominent in some basidiospores, but less evident in others. An apical germ pore may also be present. Many basidiospores have an asymmetric shape due to their development on the basidium. Basidiospores are typically single-celled (without septa), and typically range from spherical to oval to oblong, to ellipsoid or cylindrical. The surface of the spore can be fairly smooth, or it can be ornamented. The color of the spore print is usually found in the spore wall, although in rare instances – like the yellow spores of \"Clavaria helicoides\" – the cytoplasm is responsible for the spore color.\n\n"}

The winner of several AVN Awards, she has spent most of her career as a contract performer with major producer Vivid Entertainment, and is known for her roles in acclaimed adult films such as \"The New Devil in Miss Jones\". In addition to performing, she has her own adult film studio, Savanna Samson Productions. A native of upstate New York, she entered the adult film industry in 2000, after working as a dancer at the Manhattan strip club, Scores.\n\nSamson has gained mainstream recognition with appearances on television shows such as \"Saturday Night Live\", \"The Daily Show\" and \"30 Rock\". Her wide range of activities outside pornography include working as a sex-advice columnist, a radio presenter and a political correspondent. She also produces her own line of wines, has a recording contract with E1 Music and is a trained ballerina.\n\nBorn Natalie Oliveros, one of five daughters, she grew up in a Roman Catholic family in Watertown, New York. She began dancing at a young age. At 17, she moved to New York City to pursue a career in ballet. However, she eventually gave this up, admitting she \"wasn't good enough\". She took a job dancing at the Manhattan strip club Scores, on the recommendation of her sister who worked there. When starting at the club, she chose the stage name Savanna in homage to a character in the novel and film, \"The Prince of Tides\" (1986/1991).\n\nIn 2000, she left that work as a dancer intending to become a porn film star. She choose the name Savanna Samson. The surname Samson, taken from \"the Samson,\" was added to distinguish her from porn actress Savannah. While at Scores, she met her future husband, wine merchant Daniel Oliveros. They have a son together.\n\nSamson's move into the adult film business began in 2000, after she wrote a letter to Italian porn actor and director Rocco Siffredi, asking to work with him. She initially wanted to make a movie in order to fulfill a fantasy, after her husband had given her the idea, and hoped to keep it a secret. But her first movie, \"Rocco Meats An American Angel In Paris\", was nominated for \"Best Foreign Release\" at the AVN Awards. Afterward, she got what she described as \"porn fever\" and worked to make further movies. Her family soon discovered her film career when she appeared on \"The Howard Stern Show\" and \"Entertainment Tonight\". Samson stated in 2006: \"My parents are devastated by my career choices\".\n\nIn April 2002, she signed an exclusive contract with Vivid Entertainment. She continued to live in New York, and commuted to California to shoot films for the company. Samson was among three Vivid Girls to be profiled in an early-2003 issue of \"Vanity Fair\", as part of an annual roundup of the entertainment industry. The Girls were featured alongside mainstream actors, such as Daniel Day-Lewis and Julianne Moore, in a double-page photograph taken at Elton John's home on the French Riviera.\n\nSansom was also one of several Vivid Girls who wrote material for the book \"How to Have a XXX Sex Life: The Ultimate Vivid Guide\", published by ReganBooks on July 20, 2004. Samson helped promote the book with appearances on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" and \"The Howard Stern Show\". In May 2004, she joined several other porn actresses and began to write as a columnist for AVNInsider.com. At the 2004 AVN Awards, Samson won \"Best Actress – Film\" and \"Best Group Sex Scene – Film\" for her role in \"Looking In\", a 2003 film about four suburban couples who have a view into each other's houses.\n\nAlong with comedian Thea Vidale, Samson hosted the 2005 AVN Awards. She also won awards that year for \"Best All-Girl Sex Scene – Film\" and \"Best Group Sex Scene – Film\".\n\nIn February 2005, Samson began co-hosting a daily music-and-talk radio show on the Internet station Electric Eye Radio. Later in the year, she was featured alongside Jenna Jameson in Vivid's high-budget remake of the classic adult film \"The Devil in Miss Jones\". Samson's role as Miss Jones earned her the 2006 AVN Awards for \"Best Actress – Film\" and \"Best All-Girl Sex Scene – Film\". During her acceptance speech, she expressed gratitude for this support from her peers and said \"most of my family is pretty ashamed of what I do\".\n\nSamson announced in early 2006 that she had started her own production company, Savanna Samson Productions, which would release one film a year, to be distributed exclusively by Vivid. During 2006, Samson appeared on \"The Tyra Banks Show\", \"The Dr. Keith Ablow Show\", \"Secret Lives of Women\", and for the second time, \"Saturday Night Live\". Michael Lucas' 2006 gay-porn remake of \"La Dolce Vita\" featured a cameo appearance by Samson, which in 2007 won her the GayVN Award for \"Best Non-Sexual Performance\".\n\nEarly in 2007, Samson signed a record contract with Koch Records, now known as E1 Music, who had approached her after hearing her sing during a radio tour. On May 3, 2007, she appeared as a guest on the WNYC public radio series, \"The Tristan Mysteries\", to discuss Richard Wagner's opera \"Tristan und Isolde\". A long-time Wagner fan, Samson said, \"I think I'm in a unique position to discuss the sensual aspects of the 'Tristan and Isolde' characters and of opera in general\".\n\nIn June 2007, Savanna Samson Productions released its first title, \"Any Way You Want Me\", an interactive movie directed by and starring Samson. She also appeared in the 2007 film \"Debbie Does Dallas ... Again\", a sequel to the 1978 classic \"Debbie Does Dallas\", as well as its \"making of\" series that was broadcast weekly on Showtime. The film gained her a 2008 AVN Award for \"Best Group Sex Scene – Film\".\n\nIn April 2008, Samson became a political correspondent on Fox News Channel's late-night talk show \"Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld\". She had made several previous appearances on the show, and in 2007 had endorsed New York Republican mayor Rudy Giuliani's presidential candidacy.\n\nIn September 2008 her debut album, \"Possession\", was released, and her first single, a title track co-written by Samson during the breakup of her marriage. Commenting on the theme of the song, she said, \"People see me nude and having sex and think they know me and that I'm available, but I'm no more available than Angelina Jolie\". Later in the month, she had a cameo role on \"The Daily Show\", in which she portrayed CBS Evening News anchor Katie Couric in a commercial for a fictional action-adventure show. In the appearance, Samson asks \"Daily Show\" correspondent Jason Jones, \"Hey, Jones, you really think you've got the balls for that story?\" She began writing a sex-advice column for the adult entertainment site XCritic.com in June 2009, having previously written such columns for \"Men’s Fitness\" magazine and AdultFriendFinder.com.\n\nSamson made her mainstream acting debut in the \"30 Rock\" episode, \"Into the Crevasse\", which first aired on October 22, 2009. In the episode, she plays a porn version of Tina Fey's character, Liz Lemon. In 2011, Samson was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame.\n\nAccording to the Internet Adult Film Database, as of May 2010 Samson had appeared in 90 adult movies, including compilations containing recycled scenes. A 2006 article in \"The New York Times\" reported that she earns from $20,000 to over $100,000 per film, depending on sales, with each one taking from three days to two weeks to make. An \"Adult Video News\" article written in February 2006 stated that Samson had five years left on her contract with Vivid.\n\nDespite enjoying her career in the adult film industry, Samson had other ambitions. In 2005, while on vacation in Tuscany, Italy, she decided she could \"leave a mark on this world\" by making wine. Then married to a wine merchant, she had frequently traveled to Italy and France, and often fantasized about owning her own vineyard. When she was a child, she had helped her family make wine in the basement of their house in Watertown, New York.\n\nShe formed the company, Savanna Samson Wines, and asked Italian winemaker and consultant Roberto Cipresso to help find a blend of grapes local to Tuscany that would produce her ideal flavor. They eventually chose a mixture of 70 percent Cesanese, 20 percent Sangiovese and 10 percent Montepulciano, which produced a red wine that she named \"Sogno Uno,\" meaning 'Dream One.' Its label played on Samson's notoriety as a porn star, featuring a side view of her wearing only a see-through gown and high heels. Wine critic James Suckling gave \"Sogno Uno\" a rating of 75 out of 100, and described it as \"barely drinkable\". A gala launch was held for the wine at a Manhattan restaurant on February 27, 2006. By June 2007, her company had produced two more wines.\n\n\n\n"}

The club was formed 1902 as a sports club and currently plays in the Championnat National 3, the fifth division of French football. Cannes plays its home matches at the Stade Pierre de Coubertin, located within the city. The team is managed by Ludovic Pollet. \n\nDespite playing football on the French Riviera, a popular and relaxing tourist destination, Cannes have had a lackluster existence. The club was one of the founding members of the first division of French football and finished runners-up in the league's inaugural season. The club's highest honour to date was winning the Coupe de France in 1932. Cannes last played in Ligue 1 in the 1997–98 season and are currently serving the longest stint of any club in the National division, having been in the league since the 2001–02 season. The club has most notably served as a springboard for several prominent French football players such as Zinedine Zidane, Patrick Vieira, Johan Micoud, Gaël Clichy, Sébastien Frey and Jonathan Zebina.\n\nCannes is known as \"Les Dragons\" (\"The Dragons\") and incorporates the nickname into a multitude of club's fixtures, most notably its crest. On 21 May 2010, the club unveiled its new logo to its supporters. The new logo is similar to the club's previous logo, but is more dynamic with the club's city name and foundation being displayed on the badge. The dragon, which is a focal point of the club, is also given a more up-to-date design.\n\nAssociation Sportive de Cannes was founded on 4 August 1902 by English sportsman Herbert Lowe and a group of friends. Lowe was installed as the club's president. During the infancy of the club, in addition to association football, Cannes also practised the sports of competitive swimming and athletics. The club also wore a black and blue combination kit before switching to its current red and white stripe following the club's merger with \"Club Sportif de Cannes\" in 1905. Under the leadership of Louis Grosso, a local furniture dealer, the football section developed its structures. In 1920, Cannes were playing in the Ligue du Sud-Est, a regional league under the watch of the French Football Federation (FFF). While playing in the league, Cannes developed rivalries with Nice and Marseille. Nice and Cannes contest the derby match that is known as the Derby de la Côte d'Azur. In 1921, the club inaugurated the Stade Municipal de Cannes and celebrated the opening by defeating Spanish club Espanyol 4–0. During the 1920s, Cannes successfully reached the semi-finals of the Coupe de France on two occasions. Led by French internationals such as Maurice Cottenet, Charles Bardot, and Raoul Dutheil, Cannes were regular participants in the latter rounds of the prestigious cup competition. In 1932, the club finally won the competition after defeating RC Roubaix 1–0 at the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir in Colombes, courtesy of a goal from captain Louis Clerc.\n\nIn July 1930, the National Council of the FFF voted 128–20 in support of professionalism in French football. Cannes, along with most clubs from the south, were among the first clubs to adopt the new statute and, subsequently, became professional and were founding members of the new league. In the league's inaugural season, Cannes finished runner-up to champions Olympique Lillois after losing 4–3 in the ultimate match on 14 May 1933. Cannes had originally finished second in its group behind Antibes, but were declared champions of the group after Antibes was disqualified from the league for suspected bribery. Cannes remained in Division 1 for a decade before falling to Division 2 in the 1948–49 season after finishing last in the league table.\n\nCannes returned to the top division for the 1965–66 season and spent an unforgettable campaign in the league finishing second from bottom, thus returning to Division 2. It took another 20 years before the club returned to the first division for the 1987–88 season. During this time, Cannes had a young playmaker by the name of Zinedine Zidane in its ranks. In the club return to the first division, Cannes finished in 11th place. In the ensuing two seasons, Cannes remained mid-table finishing 12th and 11th, respectively. However, in the 1990–91 season, the club surprised everyone by finishing in fourth place, which gave the club qualification for the UEFA Cup. Along with Zidane, PSG loanee striker Amara Simba and the presence of experienced players like Luis Fernandez, Cannes overclassed many of their higher-rated counterparts. Unfortunately, in the following season, with the departure of Simba and Cannes having to combine its focus on both the league and Europe, the club finished in a disastrous 19th-place position. The club also suffered elimination in Round of 32 in the UEFA Cup. The resulting relegation led to the departure of Zidane and numerous others who were being courted by Division 1 clubs.\n\nThough the departure of Zidane and others did hurt the club, Cannes still had a solid core of players, which included veterans André Amitrano, William Ayache, Franck Durix, and Adick Koot and youngsters Johan Micoud, Patrick Vieira, David Jemmali and Laurent Macquet. The group effectively lived up to club expectations by finishing second in its group in the second division. Due to having more points than the second-place finisher in the other group, Cannes were back in Division 1. In the club's return, Cannes finished in a respectable ninth-place position for the 1994–95 season under manager Safet Sušić. The next season didn't start well, with Sušić getting sacked in September 1995. Ultimately, Cannes finished 14th that season. In the off-season heading into the 1996–97, Vieira departed the club for Italy, Durix ventured to Japan, and Ayache retired. Cannes struggled to replace the departed players and, subsequently, finished in 15th place for the season. Midway through the campaign, Micoud left the club for Bordeaux. After the season, Jammeli followed suit and also joined Bordeaux. The resulting departure of all the club's youth talent ultimately led to its downfall with Cannes finishing dead last in the 1997–98 season. Since the club's relegation in 1998, Cannes have yet to return to the first division of French football.\n\nOn 1 July 2014, Cannes were officially excluded from professional football in France after a ruling from the Direction Nationale du Contrôle de Gestion relating to the club's financial situation. For the 2015–16 season, the remnants of Cannes played in the Division of Honor, in the Mediterranean Regional League of the French football system.\n\n \n\nBelow are the notable former players who have represented Cannes in league and international competition since the club's foundation as a football club in 1909.

{"id": "2237161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2237161", "title": "Rudolf Wolters", "text": "Rudolf Wolters\n\nRudolf Wolters (August 3, 1903 – January 7, 1983) was a German architect and government official, known for his longtime association with fellow architect and Third Reich official Albert Speer. A friend and subordinate of Speer, Wolters received the many papers which were smuggled out of Spandau Prison for Speer while he was imprisoned there, and kept them for him until Speer was released in 1966. After Speer's release, the friendship slowly collapsed, Wolters objecting strongly to Speer's blaming of Hitler and other Nazis for the Holocaust and World War II, and they saw nothing of each other in the decade before Speer's death in 1981.\n\nWolters, who was born to a Catholic middle-class family in the northern German town of Coesfeld, obtained his degree and doctorate in architecture from the Technical University of Berlin, forging a close friendship with Speer while a student. After receiving his doctorate, he had difficulty finding employment prior to the Nazi rise to power. From 1933 to 1937, he worked for the Reichsbahn. In 1937, Speer hired him as a department head, and Wolters soon took major responsibility for Hitler's plan for the large scale reconstruction of Berlin. When Speer became Minister of Armaments and War Production in 1942, Wolters moved to his department, remaining his close associate.\n\nAfter Speer's indictment and imprisonment for war crimes, Wolters stood by him. In addition to receiving and organizing Speer's clandestine notes from Spandau, which later served as the basis of his best-selling books of memoirs, Wolters quietly raised money for Speer. These funds were used to support Speer's family and for other purposes, according to directions which Wolters received from his former superior. Following Speer's release in 1966, their friendship gradually deteriorated, until the two men became so embittered that Wolters allowed papers demonstrating Speer's knowledge of the persecution of the Jews to become public in 1980.\n\nWolters was involved in the reconstruction of West Germany following World War II, rebuilding his hometown of Coesfeld among many other projects. Wolters wrote several architectural books during the war, as well as a biography of Speer.\n\nWolters was born into a Catholic family in Coesfeld, Germany on August 3, 1903, the son of an architect who had married the daughter of a master carpenter in the shipbuilding trade. In his privately published memoirs, \"Segments of a Life\", Wolters described his father as \"a serious, conscientious and diligent man, always concerned about the future\". Wolters regarded his mother as \"a highly practical woman, full of zest for life, who in hard times thought nothing of serving a delicious roast without letting on it was horsemeat\". Wolters passed a generally happy childhood, punctuated by the chaos of the war years, and by a childhood illness that resulted in his being taught at home for a year by two priests.\n\nAfter passing his \"Abitur\", or secondary school examination, he began his architectural studies at the Technical University of Munich in 1923. Wolters noted the politicized atmosphere of his student days, stating, \"My academic freedom began, one might say, to the sound of drums: the Hitler Putsch and its consequences to us students, most of whom were in agreement with it.\" Wolters, by his own admission, was in broad sympathy with Nazi aims, though he never saw a need to join the Party.\n\nIn 1924, Wolters met Albert Speer, who was a year behind him. Wolters transferred to the Technical University of Berlin later that year, followed by Speer in 1925. Wolters sought to study under Professor Hans Poelzig, but there was no room in the course for the transfer student. Instead, Wolters studied under Heinrich Tessenow, as did Speer. Wolters obtained his degree in 1927, and earned his doctorate at the school two years later. In class prize competition, Wolters generally finished second to Speer.\n\nWolters' graduation coincided with the start of the Great Depression, and he had great difficulty finding a job, eventually settling for an unpaid position at \"Reichsbahn\" headquarters in Berlin in 1930. Upon losing that position the following year, Wolters accepted a position with the Trans-Siberian Railway's urban planning division in Novosibirsk.\n\nIn 1933, Wolters returned to Berlin, where he briefly worked as an assistant in Speer's office before returning to the \"Reichsbahn\", this time getting paid for his work. Speer had forged a close relationship with Hitler, and in late 1936, Speer informed Wolters that the dictator would soon appoint Speer as \"\" (GBI) or General Building Inspector for the Reich Capital, and suggested that Wolters resign his post with the railway and come work for him again. Wolters did so, beginning work at the GBI office in January 1937 as a Head of Department in the Planning Bureau. Wolters was one of a number of young, well-paid assistants of Speer at the GBI, who were collectively nicknamed \"Speer's Kindergarten\". Most of the Kindergarteners were not Nazi Party members, since Speer found that Party duties interfered with working time, and the Kindergarten was expected to work long hours. Speer had Hitler's permission to hire non-Nazis, so the GBI became something of a political sanctuary.\n\nWolters later wrote of his views at this time:\nI had viewed Hitler and his movement with some skepticism, but when the abolition of the multi-party mess removed the obscenity of unemployment, and the first 1,000 kilometers of autobahns opened up a new era of mobility, I too saw the light: this was the time when Churchill said he hoped Great Britain would have a man like Hitler in time of peril, and when high church dignitaries and distinguished academics paid the \"Führer\" homage.\nMuch of Wolters' work at the GBI was connected to Hitler's plan for the large scale reconstruction of Berlin. The dictator had placed Speer in charge of this plan. The centerpiece of the scheme was a grand boulevard, long, dubbed by Speer as the \"Prachtstrasse\" (Street of Magnificence) or \"North–South Axis\", for which the main design responsibility was delegated to Wolters. Wolters was also responsible for transport rings in the new Berlin, for museums, and for the GBI's press office. In 1939, Wolters became responsible for the architecture portion of the magazine, \"Die Kunst im Deutschen Reich\" (\"Art in the German Reich\").\n\nWolters made several trips abroad in connection with his duties for the GBI. He visited the United States to study advanced transport systems, and Paris for the 1937 international exposition there. In 1939, Joseph Goebbels appointed him Exhibition Commissioner. Wolters took charge of organizing German architectural exhibits presented in other countries. Until 1943, Wolters traveled to other European capitals, and in addition to his duties as commissioner, gathered political intelligence. On his return, Wolters passed along his insights to Speer and some of these thoughts reached Hitler's ears.\n\nIn 1940, Wolters, a longtime diarist, suggested to Speer that he begin keeping a \"Chronik\", or chronicle of the GBI's activities. Speer agreed, and instructed department heads to send Wolters raw material for the \"Chronik\" on a regular basis. Among other matters, the \"Chronik\" detailed the GBI's responsibility for administering a 1939 amendment to the Nuremberg Laws which allowed Aryan landlords to evict Jewish tenants with virtually no notice. For example, the entry for August 1941 included this information: \"According to a Speer directive a further action for the clearing of some five thousand Jewish flats is being started.\" The November entry noted that \"roughly 4,500 Jews were evacuated\". The dispossessed Jews were sent to the occupied territories, with the newspapers reporting, as directed by Goebbels: \"Over the past few days many Jews have hurriedly left Germany, leaving debts behind them.\"\n\nWolters was given the additional task in 1941 of setting up a special section of the government publishing house which specialized in works of architecture. Wolters wrote several books on the Third Reich's architectural works during the war years. He rejected the notion that Nazi architecture was an imitation of classical models: \"Those who speak of neo-classicism have not understood the spirit of our buildings.\"\n\nIn February 1942, following the death of Fritz Todt, Hitler appointed Speer as Minister of Armaments and War Production. Wolters followed Speer to his new ministry, becoming head of the Department of Culture, Media, and Propaganda of the Organization Todt. Wolters continued his \"Chronik\" in the new position.\n\nIn December 1943, Speer put Wolters in charge of planning for the reconstruction of bombed German cities. Wolters organized a working group of about twenty architects and city planners, mostly from northern Germany. The work of this group, known as the \"Arbeitsstab Wiederaufbauplanung\" (Task Force for Reconstruction Planning), would form the basis for the actual postwar reconstruction of Germany. Speer, who authorized the group, saw an opportunity to make German cities more habitable in the age of the automobile. The group sought solutions which would use the existing street system, rather than the grand ceremonial boulevards common in Nazi city planning. In addition, the \"Arbeitsstab\" issued extensive guidelines, ranging from the width of avenues that carried streetcar lines to the ratio of theatre seats to inhabitants.\n\nWolters rarely met Hitler, and only in the company of other members of Speer's office. He later recorded,\nOf course, from these few experiences, I cannot judge Hitler's personality, but having shared with Speer his virtually daily contacts with him, and being familiar with Hitler's ideas, for example, on town planning, I think that commentators are making it easy for themselves now when, as they frequently do, they resort in their descriptions to simplistic epitaphs such as \"buck private\", \"wall painter\", \"petit-bourgeois philistine\", or \"history's greatest criminal\".\nWolters' longtime secretary, Marion Riesser, was half-Jewish, and Wolters protected her throughout the war. In late 1944, word reached them that those with Jewish ancestry who remained free would be called up and used for cannon fodder. Wolters met with Riesser and the three other half-Jews in the Speer organizations, telling them if it became necessary (which it did not), the four would be transferred to essential war factories where they would be safe. Wolters told them, \"With Albert Speer's help one can do anything.\"\n\nIn February 1945, as the Nazi regime collapsed, Speer instructed Wolters to take other high-ranking officials in his department, including Heinrich Lübke, and set up architectural offices in the north of Germany to work on large-scale prefabricated housing. Speer expected to join them, but not then, as he anticipated that the Allies would want to use his expertise towards the reconstruction of Germany. This did not come to pass; Speer was arrested and charged with war crimes.\n\nAs Speer had instructed, Wolters set up a small office in the North German town of Höxter with Lübke, who knew the town's mayor. The new office was soon commissioned to rebuild a bridge which had been destroyed, contrary to Speer's instructions to preserve infrastructure. Later in 1945, the office was dissolved, and Wolters returned to his hometown of Coesfeld where he had been commissioned to rebuild the ruined city. Lübke instead turned to politics, rising quickly through the political ranks of postwar Germany. In 1959, Lübke became President of the Federal Republic of Germany, a position in which he served almost ten years before he resigned over questions about what he may have known about forced labor while working in Speer's department.\n\nWolters was forced to rebuild in Coesfeld almost from scratch. With the widespread destruction, he had to lay out lots and rebuild streets, all without delay. He built a road through the grounds of the local castle, and converted the building into a hotel and conference center. The versatility he showed in the rebuilding of Coesfeld led to other commissions from German cities, including Rheine, Borken and Anholt.\n\nIn 1947 and 1949, Wolters organized meetings of the former \"Arbeitsstab\" members, many of whom were intensively involved in the postwar reconstruction efforts. In 1950, Wolters won a competition to design the new police headquarters in Dortmund The Hotel Königshof in Bonn, rebuilt by Wolters, had previously been the leading hotel in the city. It reopened by hosting the President of Italy in 1956 on his state visit, and again became the leading hotel in the then-capital of the Federal Republic, hosting heads of states (including U.S. Presidents Kennedy, Nixon, and Reagan), state dinners, and events hosted by the Chancellor of Germany.\n\nWolters received so many commissions from the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that he opened an additional office in Düsseldorf. In 1955, Wolters won a competition to design the Industrie-Kreditbank building in Düsseldorf. Two years later, he was again successful in that city in a competition to design the Galarie Conzen. Wolters was awarded a prize for his design to reconstruct Düsseldorf's \"Altstadt\" (Old City). His son, Fritz Wolters, also an architect, described him as a man who fought uncompromisingly for what he saw as the \"whole\" in urban planning, and once ended a discussion with a local committee with the remark that they had \"rented his head, not his pencil\". Wolters also considered himself to be a \"functionalist\", designing a number of concrete, flat roofed, modern hospitals.\n\nIn the 1960s, Wolters and his son shared an office until their architectural differences separated them, Fritz Wolters being more interested in the small details rather than in what he described as \"epoch-making\" solutions. However, their personal relationship survived this professional separation. In 1978, Wolters published a book on the town centre of Berlin, but despite suggestions from his son, he declined to include his views about Nazi architecture, and never did set forth such views to his colleagues.\n\nWolters did not attend the Nuremberg trial (he later described it as a \"victor's court\" and as a \"show trial\") but wrote to Speer in January 1946, during the trial: \"I stand by you in misfortune as in the good days. I believe as before in your lucky star.\" On August 10, as the trial approached its conclusion, Speer, anticipating the likelihood of a death sentence, wrote to Wolters asking him to \"collect my work together for later ages and to recount much of my life. I think it will be honored one day.\" Despite his forebodings, Speer did not receive the death sentence, but on October 1, 1946, was given a sentence of twenty years in prison, and on July 18, 1947, was transferred to Spandau Prison to serve it.\n\nWolters and longtime Speer secretary Annemarie Kempf, while not permitted direct communication with Speer in Spandau, did what they could to help his family and carry out the requests Speer put in letters to his wife—the only written communication officially allowed Speer. Beginning in 1948, Speer had the services of a sympathetic Dutch orderly to smuggle mail. In 1949, Wolters opened a special bank account for Speer, the \"Schulgeldkonto\" or \"School Fund Account\", and began fundraising among those architects and industrialists who had benefited from Speer's activities during the war. At first the funds were used only to support Speer's family, but as the amounts grew and Speer's family became increasingly able to support itself, the money was used for everything from vacations for Speer's Spandau conduit, Toni Proost, to bribes for those who might be able to secure Speer's release. Once Speer became aware of the existence of the fund, he would often send detailed instructions about what to do with the money. Wolters raised a total of DM158,000 for Speer over the final seventeen years of his sentence.\n\nIn 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years. He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs. In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld. Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages. Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published. Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser. While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions. Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.\n\nWolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect. For Speer's fiftieth birthday in March 1955, Wolters gathered letters from many of Speer's friends and wartime associates, and saw to it that they made their way inside the walls of Spandau in time for Speer's birthday. Wolters gave Speer's son Albert a summer job in his Düsseldorf office and a place to stay—in fact, Wolters hosted all six of the Speer children at one time or another. By prior arrangement, he and Speer tried to get in touch with each other by telepathy one New Year's Eve—but both men fell asleep before midnight struck.\n\nWolters constantly sought Speer's early release, which required the consent of the four occupying powers. He engaged Düsseldorf attorney, and later state minister, to lobby high German officials to get them to advocate Speer's release. Schütz, who refused to ask for his expenses, was unsuccessful even though Lübke, West German President for the last seven years of Speer's incarceration, had worked under Speer. Wolters had more success fending off denazification proceedings against Speer, collecting many affidavits in Speer's favor, including one from Tessenow whom Speer had shielded during the war. Those proceedings dragged on for years, and were eventually ended by order of Willy Brandt, a strong supporter of Speer's.\n\nAs early as 1956, Wolters feared the effect that disclosure of the GBI's eviction of Jewish tenants might have on Speer. Wolters wrote to Kempf concerning the denazification proceedings, \"I am only anxious about the matter of the clearance of Jew-flats in Berlin. That could be a bullseye. And this is the point to which the defense should direct itself ...\" In 1964, Speer mentioned to Wolters in a letter that he would need the \"Chronik\" as a reference in revising his memoirs upon his release. Wolter's response was to have Riesser retype the entire \"Chronik\", leaving out any mention of the GBI's involvement in the persecution of the Jews, without telling Speer what he was doing. Wolters later wrote that he did this to correct mistakes, to leave out extraneous matters, and \"above all to delete certain parts on the basis of which Speer and one or another of his colleagues could still have been prosecuted. The Ludwigsburg Central office for 'war crimes' was still at work and an end of the persecution of National Socialists was not in sight.\"\n\nIn April 1965, with only eighteen months left of Speer's sentence, Wolters wrote to him of their prospective reunion, \"<nowiki>[I]</nowiki>t will have been twenty years since I saw you last. What will there be between us old codgers, aside of course from happy memories of skiing tours in the long distant past<nowiki>[?] ... </nowiki>Will you come to me mainly to take receipt of the promised gift I have held for you in our cellar—that long cured Westphalian ham, and those patiently waiting bottles of your favorite nectar: Johannisberger 1937? Could these things of the senses end up being all that there is between us? I am so happy that the moment approaches, but my heart is heavy ...\"\n\nAccording to Riesser, she thought that Wolters \"was frightened of the reality of Speer\". However, Kempf thought Wolters wished Speer ill. Speer was unaware of the depth of Wolters' feelings, and later told his biographer-to-be Joachim Fest that Wolters was the closest friend he had. Speer added that during the Spandau years, Wolters performed invaluable services for him and that he did not know how he would have survived Spandau without Wolters' assistance.\n\nThroughout the latter part of Speer's imprisonment, Wolters was a faithful correspondent, writing lengthy letters to Speer at least once a month, attempting to tell Speer everything that might interest him but nothing that might hurt him. When Speer invented the concept of his \"world wide walk\", imagining his daily exercise around the prison yard to be segments in a long walk from Europe through Asia to North America, Wolters supplied Speer with details of what he would \"see\". Speer later stated, \"In a manner of speaking, Rudi Wolters accompanied me on these walks.\" As midnight struck and October 1, 1966 began, Speer was released from Spandau Prison. His last use of the clandestine message system was to have a telegram sent to Wolters, in which Speer jokingly asked Wolters to pick him up thirty-five kilometres south of Guadalajara, Mexico, which he had \"reached\" after walking 31,936 kilometres.\n\nAfter spending two weeks with his family, Speer came to Coesfeld to visit Wolters in October 1966. Shortly before Speer's visit, Annemarie Kempf had visited Wolters in Coesfeld to ask him not to allow his differences with Speer to affect their first meeting. Wolters responded that he and Speer were \"too far apart\". The visit was quickly marred by Speer's insistence on inviting industrialist to Wolters' home instead of allowing a one-on-one reunion. According to Wolters' son Fritz, his father was furious and hurt by the perceived slight. While the actual meeting was casual and cordial (in addition to the long-promised ham and wine, Wolters turned over all of the accumulated papers from Speer, the censored copy of the \"Chronik\" and the remaining balance of DM25,000 in the School Fund Account), Wolters later wrote, \"I knew that day of that first still merry reunion that the Spandau friendship was over. As he stood there, in person, I saw him suddenly quite differently than I had previously.\"\n\nWolters was perturbed by an interview with Speer published in \"Der Spiegel\" in November 1966, in which Speer, while again taking responsibility for crimes of the Nazi era, blamed Hitler, rather than Germany, for starting World War II. Wolters wrote to Speer on November 30, describing Speer's assignment of blame as a \"dangerous oversimplification made entirely from today's perspective ... You will surely remember that in 1939 we were all of the opinion that Hitler \"was\" Germany. Although we were certainly depressed rather than enthusiastic about the war in Poland, we surely considered that the responsibility for it was to be found in the provocative conduct by the Poles, and it was the British who made of it a world war.\" Wolters asked Speer to \"concentrate wholly on what really happened, leaving aside what the world thinks of it now\".\n\nTheir relationship was further embittered by Speer's failure to mention Wolters by name in Speer's first book based on the Spandau material, \"Inside the Third Reich\". Speer's initial draft of the book, written while in Spandau, does mention his \"old university friend, Dr. Rudolf Wolters, to whom was assigned the most essential task, the \"Prachtstrasse\"\" in connection with the Berlin project. However, Wolters' name appears nowhere in the published version, and no mention is made of Wolters' help, essential to the writing and preservation of the draft memoir. Speer later told his future biographer, Gitta Sereny, that he did so to protect Wolters, since it might have been risky for Wolters to have been known to have assisted an imprisoned war criminal. Sereny notes in her biography of Speer that it would not have been in Speer's interest to have publicized Wolter's assistance, given the growing disagreement between them over Speer's statements. Wolter's son, Fritz, suggested that had Speer mentioned Wolters even once, \"it would have made all the difference\", since it would have shown that Speer acknowledged the debt he owed Wolters for his efforts during his incarceration.\n\nAfter the German edition of \"Inside the Third Reich\" was published in late 1969, Speer proposed a visit to the embittered Wolters in Coesfeld. Wolters advised against it, sarcastically suggesting that he was surprised that the author did not \"walk through life in a hair shirt, distributing his fortune among the victims of National Socialism, forswear all the vanities and pleasures of life and live on locusts and wild honey\". Nevertheless, Wolters expressed a willingness to meet, proposing (rather pointedly) a meeting at Wolters' house on November 19, Buß- und Bettag, the day of penance and prayer for German Protestants. Speer duly visited, and as the two sat down to lunch, enquired, \"Where are the locusts?\"\n\nWith research concluded upon \"Inside the Third Reich\", Speer had donated the edited \"Chronik\" to the German Federal Archives in Koblenz in July 1969. David Irving compared the donated \"Chronik\" with a copy of the \"Chronik\" for 1943 in the Imperial War Museum in London, and discovered discrepancies. Irving asked the Archives and Speer the reason for the differences (which were minor compared with previous years). Speer requested an explanation from Wolters, and Wolters admitted the censorship by letter in January 1970, saying, \"I wouldn't have put it past the \"Ludwigsbergern\" <nowiki>[German war crimes prosecutors]</nowiki> to launch an additional prosecution against you on the pretext that this charge <nowiki>[of evicting the Jews] </nowiki>was not included in the Nuremberg Indictment.\" Speer suggested that the pages of the \"Chronik\" dealing with the Jews should not exist, and informed the Archives that the original of the \"Chronik\", from which the copy given to the Archives had been made, had disappeared. Wolters did not destroy the original as Speer had hinted.\n\nWolters' anger towards Speer burst into the open in 1971 after Speer did a lengthy interview for \"Playboy\", in which he again took responsibility for Nazi crimes and blamed Hitler and his associates for the war.\nWhat is the matter with you that, that even after the unending admissions of guilt in <nowiki>[</nowiki>\"Inside the Third Reich\"<nowiki>]</nowiki> you cannot stop representing yourself ever more radically as a criminal for whom twenty years in prison was \"too little\"? ... there appears to be a vast and incomprehensible discrepancy between your humble confessions and your present way of life. For the former would lead one to expect a Speer in sackcloth and ashes; I, however, know you as a merry fellow who undertakes one lovely journey after another and who happily regales his old chums with tales of his literary and financial successes ... <nowiki>[Y]</nowiki>our accusations against your former colleagues (Göring, Goebbels, Bormann, etc.) who, being dead, cannot defend themselves are agony to me ... I hope and think that the day will come when you will no longer find it necessary to confess your guilt to all and sundry in order to persuade yourself of your virtue.\nWolters concluded his letter with a suggestion that they avoid seeing each other in future, a suggestion with which Speer concurred. In spite of this, Wolters' wife Erika remained close friends with Margarete Speer, Albert Speer's wife. The two men had Christmas presents delivered to each other every year (Wolters sent Speer a ham, while receiving a pot of honey). Speer admitted that because he had had few friends, the estrangement hurt.\n\nIn 1975, Wolters attempted a reconciliation, sending Speer a letter for his seventieth birthday in March. Speer responded emotionally, pledging to come visit Wolters at the slightest hint. Speer wrote again two months later, telling Wolters that \"despite all inherent contradictions, I am very attached to you\". Nevertheless, the two men never met again.\n\nEven in Speer's second book of memoirs, \"\", Wolters' name is not mentioned, and his hometown is changed; the text refers to him as Speer's \"Coburg friend\". Speer sent Wolters a copy of the book anyway, though Speer stated that he thought it likely that Wolters would let it sit in his bookcase unread. Wolters responded sarcastically in a letter which he signed, \"Duke of Coburg,\" \"I forgive you for not 'localizing' me in the diaries after your modest restraint in <nowiki>[</nowiki>\"Inside the Third Reich\"<nowiki>]</nowiki>. The author of the <nowiki>[</nowiki>\"Chronik\"<nowiki>]</nowiki>, the temporary 'best friend', and the indefatigable contact for Spandau remains nonexistent.\"\n\nWolters bequeathed his papers to the Federal Archives, ensuring the record would be corrected one day. However, in late 1979, Speer was approached by Matthias Schmidt, a doctoral student, who sought answers to a number of questions for use in preparing his thesis. After answering Schmidt's questions, Speer referred Schmidt to Wolters for further information. Wolters took a liking to Schmidt, and showed him both the original \"Chronik\" and the correspondence in which Wolters had informed Speer of the censoring of the record. When confronted by Schmidt with this information, Speer both denied knowledge of the censorship and stated that the correspondence was not genuine. While Speer pledged not to take legal action against Schmidt for using the disputed papers (after obtaining his doctorate, Schmidt published his thesis as a book, \"Albert Speer: The End of a Myth\"), he made no such promise regarding Wolters. Speer published a formal revocation of a power of attorney he had given Wolters while in Spandau and disputed on legal grounds Wolters' right to the \"Chronik\" and other papers. The dispute was only ended by Speer's sudden death in London in September 1981.\n\nWolters died in January 1983 after a long illness. According to his son Fritz, his final word was \"Albert\". He had donated many of his papers to the Archives in 1982; after Wolters died, Riesser, as his literary executor, donated the remainder.\n\n\n\nOnline\n"}
