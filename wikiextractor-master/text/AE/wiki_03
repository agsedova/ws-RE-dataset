{"id": "2322546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322546", "title": "PlayStation Portable homebrew", "text": "PlayStation Portable homebrew\n\nPlayStation Portable homebrew refers to the process of using exploits and hacks to execute unsigned code on the PlayStation Portable (PSP).\n\nAdditional features added including the ability to emulate and play the ROMs of other consoles, play homebrew games, share music, print photos, watch videos from streaming sites such as YouTube, and run additional video formats originally unsupported by the device.\n\nHomebrew emulators were created for NES, SNES, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Sega Genesis and N64 console systems among others. Numerous different emulators were created for the most popular consoles. PlayStation 1 emulation was native, made by Sony.\n\nSoon after the PSP was released, hackers began to discover exploits in the PSP that could be used to run unsigned code on the device. Sony released version 1.51 of the PSP firmware in May 2005 to plug the holes that hackers were using to gain access to the device. On 15 June 2005 the hackers distributed the cracked code of the PSP on the internet. Hackers refused to apply updates which would render their hacks unusable so Sony attempted to convince users that there was a benefit to upgrading by including new features in the firmware updates, such as a web browser, and not just security patches to plug the vulnerabilities. BusinessWeek dubbed this the \"carrot-and-stick\" approach.\n\nIn August 2005 Sony released version 2.0 of the firmware which included the web browser, file compatibility updates and other features. Hackers and other homebrew enthusiasts then encountered the first trojan for the PSP. Symantec called this trojan \"Trojan.PSPBrick\". Users attempting to downgrade their PSP using this software instead found that it was rendered inoperable as this software deleted mandatory/important system files. Over the course of 2005 Sony released six different versions of the firmware and hackers typically responded to it by downgrading to avoid the new security updates.\n\nIn mid-2006, after several months of problems in defeating the PSP's firmware a file was posted online which allowed new PSPs running firmware version 2.6 to downgrade to 1.5 so they could then be hacked using older methods. This reportedly caused more buzz in the community than any recent official offerings for the device.\n\nDark AleX (aka Dark_AleX, Dax, Darkethe) is a Spanish programmer who writes homebrew applications for the PlayStation Portable. Dark AleX, as well as other variations of the name, is a pseudonym under which he works. One of the drawbacks of downgrading the PSP is that new official media may require the presence of a new firmware edition. Dark_Alex had released a Custom Firmware called \"Dark Alex's Open Edition firmware\" or \"Custom Firmware (CFW)\" which opens the firmware and allows users to use the existing feature set of the current edition. Sony quickly patched the firmware again, continuing the cat-and-mouse game with the hackers and users. In 2006 Sony released six updates to the system firmware and in 2007 they released another six updates. In July 2007 Dark_AleX officially stopped his work on the PSP, citing perceived problems with Sony as one of the reasons for his departure.\nSome people even suggested that Dark_AleX was paid by Sony not to release any more custom firmware, but Sony denied this.\n\nCustom Firmware allows the running of unsigned code such as homebrew applications and UMD backups, emulators for other consoles, as well as PlayStation games when the disc images are converted into PSP format.\n\nHalf Byte Loader (also known as HBL) is an open source software project that aims at loading homebrew for PlayStation Portable handheld console through user-mode exploits. It does not provide any mechanism for loading official games or ISO images. HBL was built from scratch to be easily portable to any user-mode exploit. The project was created and started by m0skit0 and ab5000.\n\nHBL was created initially for the Medal of Honor Heroes exploit. An alpha version was released as open source by m0skit0 and ab5000 in November 2009, which ran very simple homebrews. When the Patapon 2 demo exploit was found and leaked, wololo joined the project and proposed to port HBL to this new exploit. The AdvancedPSP forums, which hosted the project, were shut down by the hosting and the project moved to wololo/talk forums. wololo also created a new public SVN repository for HBL at Google Code. Other PSP hackers such as Davee and neur0n joined in to help the development of this port. HBL for Patapon 2 passed to beta version, and can be considered the first useful HBL version, released in March 2010. HBL was subsequently ported to several other user-mode exploits, and also served as base for other projects, like the PRO CFW project.\n\nHBL was also ported to run on Sony PlayStation Vita's PSP emulator with very little modifications. This project was named Vita HBL (VHBL) and was uploaded to HBL's public repository by wololo in March 2012.\n\nHackers have stated that the motivation for unlocking the PSP has nothing to do with piracy, but allowing individuals full access to the products they've purchased and the freedom to do what they want with the item as well as the interest in exploring something unknown. Fanjita, a member of the hacker group \"N00bz!\", stated, \n\"Everyone has the right to do what they want with their own hardware. Piracy does upset me, and because what we are doing opens the way to piracy it's harder to justify it morally. But our stance on piracy is clear, and we hope to be role models. Sony have never been in touch with me, so I am confident that what we are doing is legal.\"\"\nSony has told the media that any issues resulting from running modified code on the device would void the warranty. They have also stated that the problem is not with homebrew but piracy. However their constant firmware updates have been seen as attempts to hamper homebrew development. According to Phillip Torrone from \"Make\" magazine, this hampering could be due to the attempts to curb piracy and may cause more harm than good. He thinks that \"the really smart companies should release their products to the alpha geeks for six months and let the alpha geeks play around with them. It seems to me they'd save a lot of money on R&D, and they'd come out with much more solid products.\"\n\nHowever, Sony has also said that, when questioned about homebrew game support, Jack Tretton replied with,\n"}

The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group, as part of a duopoly with ABC affiliate WTNH (channel 8), also licensed to New Haven. The two stations share studios on Elm Street in downtown New Haven and transmitter facilities in Hamden, Connecticut. However, master control and some internal operations are based at Springfield, Massachusetts-licensed Nexstar sister station and NBC affiliate WWLP's studios in Chicopee.\n\nWCTX is mostly available on channel 9 on almost all of Connecticut's cable systems (playing into its former branding style), though as of 2020 on-air and online, mention of its higher-number high-definition positions take higher priority. WCTX is a secondary ABC affiliate, airing that network's programs when WTNH is unable to do so due to extended breaking news coverage or a local special.\n\nAs early as 1953, a construction permit for the analog UHF channel 59 allotment was issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and was originally owned by the Connecticut Radio Foundation. However, the group was never able to get the station on-the-air and sold the permit to Impart Systems in 1967. In 1971, the then-owner of NBC affiliate WHNB (channel 30) built a low-power translator on UHF channel 59 in New Haven (W59AA licensed to West Haven). Although WHNB had boosted its power to cover New Haven a few months earlier, some areas in Southern Connecticut still could not get a good signal from the station.\n\nOn April 3, 1995, the station finally began broadcasting as a WB affiliate with the callsign WTVU under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with LIN TV, owner of WTNH. Before WTVU's sign on, The WB's programming had been shown on WTNH following its late newscast on Saturday nights (The WB only offered two hours a week of programming at that point); viewers living in Southwestern Connecticut were able to view the network's programs in-pattern via New York City-based superstation WPIX.\n\nThe LMA also allowed WTVU to broadcast strong syndicated programs, mostly barter shows and second runs from WTNH. It also ran classic sitcoms and drama shows such as \"Hawaii Five-O\", \"Perry Mason\", \"M*A*S*H\", \"I Love Lucy\", \"Happy Days\", \"The Honeymooners\", \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", \"I Dream of Jeannie\", \"Bewitched\" and \"Gilligan's Island\" among others that were removed from the schedules of WTXX (channel 20, now WCCT-TV) and WTWS (channel 26, now Ion Television owned-and-operated station WHPX-TV) some years back. It also picked up the rights to telecast Hartford Whalers hockey games, which aired on the station until the team became the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997.\n\nOn April 1, 1996, the station changed its call letters to WBNE (for \"WB New England\"). After Tribune Broadcasting (a minority owner of The WB) purchased then-UPN affiliate WTXX, WBNE and that station swapped network affiliations on January 1, 2001. With the new network relationship came the current WCTX calls and use of the on-air identity \"The X\". That identity was used in lieu of the conventional \"UPN (channel number)\" branding. LIN TV purchased WCTX outright in 2002. On September 19, 2005, WCTX became known as \"UPN 9\" (the same branding as fellow New York affiliate WWOR-TV), highlighting its cable channel position in some areas.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and the Warner Bros. Entertainment unit of Time Warner announced that UPN and The WB would cease broadcasting and merge their programming inventories to create a new network called The CW. WTXX was chosen as Connecticut's CW affiliate after its owner Tribune announced a ten-year deal with the upcoming network leaving WCTX to tentatively become an independent station once again. However, on April 26, WCTX announced it would join MyNetworkTV (a second new network launched by News Corporation).\n\nMyNetworkTV began broadcasting on September 5, and as a result, the station did not carry the final two weeks of UPN programming. With its new network affiliation, the station changed its branding to the current \"MyTV9\". As of the 2007–2008 season, University of Connecticut men's basketball games now air primarily on WCTX while a handful of games air on sister station WTNH. It recently signed a multi-year television deal with the WNBA's Connecticut Sun to broadcast select regular season games as well.\n\nUntil March 31, 2008, WCTX served as the default MyNetworkTV affiliate on Charter Communications cable systems for the Springfield–Holyoke, Massachusetts market as that area did not have an affiliate of its own. On that date, ABC affiliate WGGB-TV added the network as a secondary affiliation on its new Fox-affiliated second digital subchannel. WCTX is still seen on Charter. WCTX was also repeated on W11BJ (now WFXQ-CD) from a transmitter on Rattlesnake Mountain in Farmington from 2004 until 2006 while LIN TV built a new transmitter for that channel and moved its city of license to Springfield.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, Media General announced that it would purchase LIN Media and its stations, including WTNH and WCTX, in a $1.6 billion merger. The merger was completed on December 19.\n\nOn September 8, 2015, Media General announced that it would acquire the Meredith Corporation for $2.4 billion, with the combined group to be renamed Meredith Media General once the sale is finalized. Because Meredith already owns WFSB, and the two stations rank among the four highest-rated stations in the Hartford–New Haven market in total day viewership, the companies would have been required to sell either WFSB or WTNH to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as recent changes to those rules regarding same-market television stations that restrict sharing agreements; WCTX would have been the only one of the three stations affected by the merger that could been legally be acquired by Meredith Media General, as its total day viewership ranks below the top-four ratings threshold. However, on January 27, 2016, Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Media General, resulting in the termination of Meredith's acquisition by Media General.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Nexstar announced it would acquire the assets of Chicago-based Tribune Media—which has owned Fox affiliate WTIC-TV (channel 61) since 1996 and CW affiliate WCCT-TV (channel 20) since 2001—for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. Nexstar was required to sell two of the stations (including one ranking in the top four in ratings) to a separate, unrelated company to comply with FCC ownership rules. On March 20, 2019, it was announced that Nexstar would keep the WTNH/WCTX duopoly and sell the WTIC/WCCT duopoly to McLean, Virginia-based Tegna Inc. as part of the company's sale of nineteen Nexstar- and Tribune-operated stations to Tegna and the E. W. Scripps Company in separate deals worth $1.32 billion; this would make the WTIC/WCCT duopoly the first television properties in Connecticut and southern New England for Tegna.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nUntil TheCoolTV was added on WCTX-DT2 in 2010 (which was subsequently dropped on July 15, 2013), the subchannel aired a 24-hour live feed of WTNH's regional weather radar called the \"SkyMax Doppler Network\". Justice Network aired on WCTX-DT3 from February 2016 until March 2018, when WTIC-TV added it on its DT4 subchannel. WCTX additionally carries live sports events of local interest from Sinclair's Stadium.\n\nWCTX shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 59, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 39, using PSIP to display WCTX's virtual channel as 59 on digital television receivers, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition. In 2018, WCTX moved its digital signal to VHF Channel 10, which it now shares with sister station WTNH.\n\nOutside of WTNH newscasts, MyNetworkTV and the aforementioned Stadium programming, WCTX carries \"TMZ/TMZ Live\", \"Family Feud\", \"Judge Judy\" and \"Extra\", along with a number of court shows.\n\nSince the start of the local marketing agreement with WCTX in 2000, WTNH has been producing a nightly prime time newscast at 10 p.m. on channel 59. It has competed right from its April 17, 2000 debut with WTIC-TV's 10 p.m. broadcast, which established itself as the leading primetime newscast in the market since it debuted in 1989. As of the February 2008 ratings period, WTIC's weeknight newscast was the most watched late evening news broadcast in the market, even gathering more viewership than the 11 p.m. newscasts on Connecticut's Big Three stations.\n\nIn 2005, WCTX began simulcasting the second hour of WTNH's weekday morning show (at 6 a.m.), followed by a third hour from 7 to 8 a.m. that is seen exclusively on WCTX, except for simulcast \"Good Morning America\" cut-ins on WTNH. The second hour was eventually dropped for an unknown reason. The 7 a.m. hour received competition on March 3, 2008 when WTIC launched its own weekday morning newscast. On April 26, 2010, WTNH rebranded from \"News Channel 8\" to \"News 8\". In addition, WTNH began broadcasting its local newscasts in widescreen enhanced definition, with WCTX's newscasts being included in the upgrade. On October 4, 2010, WTNH became the third station in the market to begin broadcasting its newscasts in high definition; WCTX's newscasts also made the transition. On March 30, 2020, WTNH planned to launch an expansion of WCTX's primetime newscast to the three-hour entirety of primetime on weeknights and 90 minutes on weekends, presumably pushing back MyNetworkTV programming to the graveyard slot in late night, an increasingly common fate for the service. This quickly shifted to launching on March 16 instead to provide continuing coverage of the local impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\n"}

It was released in June 1986. The album includes the hits \"Glory of Love\" and \"The Next Time I Fall\" (with Amy Grant); both reached the No. 1 position on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. \"Solitude/Solitaire\" was produced by Michael Omartian,<ref name=\"Solitude/SolitaireCD\"></ref> who later co-produced Cetera's 2001 album, \"Another Perfect World\".\n\nCetera co-wrote eight of the nine songs on the album, \"The Next Time I Fall\" being the exception. Because Cetera had been a prominent songwriter for Chicago, many of the songs on \"Solitude/Solitaire\" were rumored to originally have been slated for \"Chicago 18\", especially \"Big Mistake\" and \"Daddy's Girl\".\n\nWhile \"Big Mistake\" was due to be the first single from the album, \"Glory of Love\", co-written by Cetera, David Foster, and Diane Nini, was released instead. That song, from the film \"The Karate Kid Part II\", topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts, and helped \"Solitude/Solitaire\" to eventually go platinum. The follow-up single, \"The Next Time I Fall\", was also a major success and topped the charts. Later singles released from the album included \"Big Mistake\" and \"Only Love Knows Why\". The song, \"Daddy's Girl,\" is part of the soundtrack for the 1987 American comedy film, \"Three Men and a Baby\".\n\nThe album was Cetera's greatest solo success, peaking at No. 23 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. It was certified platinum by the RIAA, selling over one million copies in the U.S.\n\n\"Solitude/Solitaire\" marked a high point in Cetera's career, where he achieved success for the first time on his own. It sold more copies than \"Chicago 18\", Chicago's first album without Cetera, which peaked at No. 35.\n\n\nAdapted from AllMusic and album liner notes.\n"}

The Lahu are an ethnic group that originated in Tibet and migrated into the Yunnan province of China, Myanmar, northern Thailand and Laos. Missionaries among the Lahu developed a Romanized phonetic alphabet for the Lahu in the beginning of the 19th century that was reformed by the Chinese government in 1957.\n\nChristianity was introduced to the Lahu in China early in the 20th century when they sent delegates to Burma to inquire about the Christian Faith. By 1936 the number of Lahu Christians was reported to be 33,650 with 100 churches. The number of Lahu Christians declined to about 20,000 in Yunnan during Japanese occupation during World War II, and more fled when Communist forces approached the region.\n\nLiving close to the border, there has been ready access to opium among the Lahu villagers in China, with opium addiction causing impoverishment and crimes. Because the government noticed that Lahu Christians generally did not smoke opium, beginning in 1992 the Chinese government facilitated the spread of Christianity among the Lahu. By 1993, it was reported that there were about 50,000 Lahu Christians in China and 24 churches. There has also been spread as some villages noticed the positive economic and health effects Christianity has had on other villages where they had relatives. The willingness of the government to facilitate such conversion is in part due to the ideological belief that monotheism is a natural stepping-stone from polytheism to Communism. At least some of these churches may not have fully absorbed core Christian doctrines such as the Trinity, as they use a term for a lesser deity in reference to Jesus.\n\nLahu Christians from Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) have since World War II been evangelizing Lahu in other countries and the Akha and Wa in their own country. They have also opened their own seminary.\n\nThe Thailand Lahu Baptist Convention had roughly 8,130 members in 108 congregations as of 1998. There have also been Lahu members of the Church of the Nazarene in Thailand since five Lahu churches merged with the denomination in 1994 following evangelical work by Lahu from Myanmar.\n\nBefore the late 17th century, the Lahu religion was polytheistic. Buddhism was introduced in the late 17th century and became widespread.\n"}

This included the 2012 election for California's 52nd congressional district, the 2016 San Diego mayoral election, and the 2018 San Diego County Board of Supervisors election.\n\nLori Saldaña was born 1958 in San Diego, the third of four daughters born to Virginia and Frank Saldaña. Frank Saldaña served in the Marine Corps and was a reporter for the San Diego \"Evening Tribune.\" \nLori Saldaña grew up in the Clairemont area of San Diego, where she currently resides. After graduation from Madison High School, she attended San Diego State University (SDSU), earning both a Bachelor of Arts degree and a master's degree in Education.\n\nSaldaña started her post-graduate life as a coach at San Diego City College, Clairemont High School, and Madison High School. Later, she worked as a professor and administrator in the San Diego Community College District, where she taught Business Information Technology and managed Department of Labor grants used to provide technical skills and training to the student base. She has also taught at her alma mater, San Diego State University.\n\nSaldaña was on the founding Board of Directors for San Diego Earth Day and organized the first \"Earth Fair\" in Balboa Park in 1990. She was chair of the San Diego chapter of the Sierra Club from Jan. 1996 to Aug. 1997 and served in other volunteer positions for the Club. Her main interests were in water reclamation and sewage treatment, especially along the US-Mexico border. She served as Chair of the San Diego Wetlands Advisory Board 1992-94. President Clinton appointed her in 1999 to the Border Environment Cooperation Commission's Advisory Council.\n\nIn 2004, incumbent State Assemblywoman Christine Kehoe of California's 76th State Assembly district decided to retire in order to run for a seat in the California Senate. Saldaña ran for the open seat and won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 41% of the vote. In the general election, she defeated Republican Tricia Hunter, a former Assemblywoman, 54%-41%. In 2006, she won re-election to a second term with 64% of the vote. In 2008, she won re-election to a third term with 64% of the vote. She left the Assembly due to term limits in 2010.\n\nIn 2007 Saldaña was named Legislator of the Year by Californians Against Waste for her legislation regarding E-waste. Capitol Weekly, California's major weekly periodical covering the state legislature, publishes an annual legislative scorecard to pin down the political or ideological leanings of every member of the legislature based on how they voted on an assortment of bills in the most recent legislative session. On the scorecard, \"100\" is a perfect liberal score and \"0\" is a perfect conservative score., On the 2009 Capitol Weekly legislative scorecard, Saldana ranked as a 97.\n\nSaldana is a staunch advocate of environmental legislation. She co-authored the Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32), which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while instituting renewable energy mandates. She also sought to decrease the use of fossil fuels while making solar energy more affordable by co-authoring the Million Dollar Solar Initiative. Additionally, she authored legislation to increase California's Environmental Fund, which included increasing the use of hybrid vehicles and reduced-emission buses.\n\nIn the 2009 session of the state legislature, Saldana introduced three bills that would restrict California's ballot initiative process:\n\n\nDue to California's term limits, Saldaña's assembly career ended on August 31, 2010 in an acrimonious late-night session as she pushed legislation banning the open carry of firearms known as AB 1934. Saldaña presented her bill to the Assembly with 70 minutes remaining in the 2010 regular session, and would not suspend debate when it became clear that its opponents would not let it come to an early vote. Saldaña later clashed with fellow Democrats over their refusal to employ parliamentary procedure tactics to end debate so her measure could be heard.\n\nShe was appointed Assistant Majority Whip and served on the Appropriations, Natural Resources, Veteran's Affairs, and Water, Parks and Wildlife committees.\n\nOriginally, she was planning on running for a seat in the California Senate, but instead decided to run in the newly redrawn California's 52nd congressional district. She came in third place in the open primary and did not advance to the general election, which was ultimately won by Scott Peters.\n\nIn January 2016 she announced her candidacy for the mayor of San Diego against incumbent mayor Kevin Faulconer in his bid for re-election. For this election, she ran with a party affiliation of \"no preference,\" though the office of mayor is officially nonpartisan. She lost in the primary to Faulconer, coming in second.\n\nIn 2018, Saldaña ran for a seat on the officially nonpartisan San Diego County Board of Supervisors. She campaigned as a Democrat, having changed her party affiliation back after the mayoral election. She came in third place in the open primary and did not advance to the general election, which was ultimately won by Nathan Fletcher.\n\nSaldaña has many outdoor interests, including sailing, hiking, golfing, kayaking, swimming, snorkeling, and photography. She wrote \"Lori Saldaña's Backpacking Primer\" (1995).\n"}
{"id": "2322608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322608", "title": "Toshiaki Kawada", "text": "Toshiaki Kawada\n\nWidely considered one of the greatest wrestlers of his generation, his matches against Mitsuharu Misawa, Jun Akiyama, and Kenta Kobashi in the 1990s are argued by many fans and experts in the industry as some of the greatest professional wrestling matches of all time. He is known for his extremely stiff wrestling style and martial arts strikes, which earned him the nickname \"Dangerous K\". He also has the distinction of having competed in 17 matches that were given a 5-Star Rating and one match which received a 6-Star rating by Dave Meltzer of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\".\n\nKawada was very active during his high school years in amateur wrestling, becoming a national champion in his senior year after defeating Keiichi Yamada (who later became Jyushin Thunder Liger in professional wrestling) in the finals. Kawada attended the same high school as Misawa, who was one year Kawada's senior. Initially, he wanted to join the New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) dojo, however, Misawa convinced him to try out for rival All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) instead. He made his professional wrestling debut at the age of 18 on October 4, 1982 for AJPW, competing against future tag partner Hiromichi Fuyuki. Kawada was then sent to North America for a year in November 1985, where he gained experience as a professional wrestler in Fred Behrend's Texas All-Star Wrestling (San Antonio, Texas), Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling (in Calgary) and Frank Valois' International Wrestling (in Montreal); despite having no Korean heritage, Kawada was billed as \"Kio Kawata\" from Seoul, South Korea in Stampede Wrestling for a very short time around June 1986. Reportedly unhappy with his time overseas, Kawada has rarely spoken about his experiences in America in subsequent years.\n\nHis first major break came in 1987 when he joined his mentor Genichiro Tenryu's \"Revolution\" group. Kawada was paired with Hiromichi Fuyuki, forming a tag team known as \"Footloose\". The duo held the All Asia Tag Team Championship on three occasions between March 9, 1988 and October 20, 1989; their standout rivalries were against Shunji Takano and Shinichi Nakano, as well as against the Can-Am Express (Dan Kroffat and Doug Furnas). When Revolution stable mate Ashura Hara was expelled from All Japan in 1988 for gambling debts, Kawada was promoted to team with Tenryu in that year's World's Strongest Tag Determination League, losing a memorable final match to Stan Hansen and Terry Gordy.\n\nIn the summer of 1990, after Tenryu and a number of other All Japan wrestlers had left the promotion to join Tenryu's newly formed Super World of Sports, Kawada became Mitsuharu Misawa's main partner in the Jumbo Tsuruta vs Misawa & Co. feud, pitting Tsuruta's \"Tsuruta-Gun\" against Misawa's \"Super Generation Army\". As part of the feud, Kawada began a heated rivalry with Tsuruta's main partner Akira Taue. Misawa and Kawada would win the World Tag Team Championship twice, as well as the 1992 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. He earned his first Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship opportunity on October 24, 1991, unsuccessfully challenging Tsuruta, and was also turned back in the following year in Triple Crown challenges to Stan Hansen (June 5, 1992) and Misawa (October 21, 1992); the match with Hansen was named Match of the Year by Tokyo Sports, and finished second behind the Misawa match in Weekly Pro Wrestling's year end fan poll for Match of the Year.\n\nIn early 1993, after it became apparent that Tsuruta's days as a competitive wrestler were over, All Japan promoter Giant Baba asked Kawada to form a tag team with his rival Akira Taue. Kawada agreed, signalling the end of his alliance with Misawa. Kawada and Taue went to a draw in the 1993 Champion Carnival and ended their feud with a handshake. In their first title match as a team, Kawada and Taue, named \"The Holy Demon Army\", defeated World Tag Team Champions Terry Gordy and Steve Williams. Shortly afterward, they successfully defended the title against Misawa and Kenta Kobashi on June 1, 1993, in a match that Baba (at the time) regarded as the greatest match he'd ever seen; it was the first of nine legendary matches between the sides, and Kawada would hold the World Tag Team Championship with Taue six times.\n\nKawada's greatest achievement to that point came when he won the 1994 Champion Carnival by defeating Steve Williams on April 16. Kawada followed by losing his third straight Triple Crown challenge against Mitsuharu Misawa in the June 3, 1994. Their 36-minute bout was highly acclaimed by journalists and magazines, being called the greatest match of the decade in later years. After Williams lifted the Triple Crown from Misawa, Kawada defeated Williams on October 22, 1994; his title reign lasted one successful defense, as he went to a one-hour draw with Kenta Kobashi in Osaka on January 19; it has been called the greatest one hour match in pro wrestling history by Wrestling Observer's Dave Meltzer. Stan Hansen ended Kawada's Triple Crown reign on March 4, 1995. Kawada pinned Misawa for the first time on June 9, 1995, when he teamed with Taue to face Misawa and Kobashi, but Misawa and Kobashi came back to defeat them in the Tag League Final in the last straight tag meeting of the two teams.\n\nKawada spent much of 1996 in Giant Baba's doghouse for publicly questioning All Japan's isolationist promotional policy at a time when rival New Japan drew record business running interpromotional matches; he watched Taue and Kobashi win the Triple Crown in the place of what looked to be the time for \"his push\". Kawada worked one interpromotional match on a major UWFi show, but All Japan chose not to follow up on either a promotional feud with UWFi nor on the sudden attention Kawada drew. He was allowed out of the doghouse in time for Kawada & Taue to break through in 1996 to win the World's Strongest Tag Determination League for the first time, beating Misawa and Jun Akiyama. Kawada pinned Misawa for the first time in a singles match in the 1997 Carnival Finals mini-round robin, then followed up to pin Kobashi the same night to win the Canival championship for the second time; neither win had quite the impact one would expect given the results. Kawada and Taue would take their second straight World Tag League championship to close out year that saw both spend much of it in the shadows of Misawa and Kobashi. The crowning moment of Kawada's career came on May 1, 1998, as he pinned Misawa for the second time to win the Triple Crown at All Japan's first Tokyo Dome show AJPW 25th Anniversary. However, he was promptly defeated by Kobashi on June 12, 1998, in his first title defense. After receiving little singles push over the last half of 1998, Kawada was given (with no build up) a Triple Crown match against Misawa on January 22, 1999; in something of a surprise, Kawada took his second straight Triple Crown match against Misawa to win with title for the third time. However, he broke his arm during the match and vacated the title the following day. Kawada returned in May 1999, but would revert to the sidelines due to an eye injury in August. He didn't return until January 2000, but suffered high-profile losses to Kobashi, Vader, and Misawa. In June 2000, Kawada and Taue won the World Tag Team Championship for the sixth time, breaking a record they shared with not only Jumbo Tsuruta and Yoshiaki Yatsu, but Terry Gordy and Steve Williams as well.\n\nFollowing the June 2000 series, Misawa and all but two native talent in All Japan resigned from their positions and defected to the newly formed Pro Wrestling Noah promotion; Toshiaki Kawada and Masanobu Fuchi were the only two native talent to stay with All Japan Pro Wrestling. With the promotion gutted of top talent, Kawada's old mentor Genichiro Tenryu was brought back and an interpromotional agreement was struck with New Japan; the first key match against New Japan saw Kawada defeat IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kensuke Sasaki on October 9, 2000 in a non-title match. On September 6, 2003, he won the Triple Crown for the fifth time in a tournament final against Shinjiro Ohtani. This time, however, Kawada embarked on a magnificent reign with 10 successful title defenses against the likes of Genichiro Tenryu, Shinya Hashimoto, Jamal, Taiyō Kea, Kensuke Sasaki and Hiroyoshi Tenzan; as a result, Kawada broke Misawa's record of 8 defenses during Misawa's third reign. In addition, 2004 became only the second year when the Triple Crown did not change hands (the first was 1993, during Misawa's first reign), which included a successful defense against Mick Foley in the HUSTLE promotion; in Misawa's era, the title was not defended during the Champion Carnival and World's Strongest Tag Determination League tours, which were dedicated to their namesake tournaments. Kawada's reign restored dignity to the Triple Crown at the expense of the said tournaments.\n\nAfter losing the titles to Satoshi Kojima on February 16, 2005, Kawada signed a contract with Dream Stage Entertainment, the parent company of PRIDE Fighting Championships. Kawada made the sports entertainment based HUSTLE promotion his new home, and immediately turned heel in 2005; he turned his back on his young student Taichi Ishikari and friends Shinjiro Ohtani and Naoya Ogawa of the HUSTLE Army to join the dastardly Monster Army, led by Generalissimo Takada and swimsuit model Yinling the Erotic Terrorist. Due to the way Kawada's contract with DSE was structured, he was free to work where he pleased (including New Japan Pro Wrestling, Pro Wrestling Noah, and other various independent groups). However, when All Japan reopened relations with FEG to begin running WRESTLE-1 shows again in 2005 with the parent company of PRIDE's biggest competitor in Japan (that being the K-1 fighting group, run by FEG), DSE requested that Kawada not work for All Japan any longer because of the conflict of interest. On July 18, 2005, at the Tokyo Dome, Kawada wrestled one final 27-minute classic against his old rival Mitsuharu Misawa.\nIn July 2006, All Japan officially ended their relationship with FEG. Kawada immediately expressed interest to work in his home promotion once again, and finally made his long-awaited return on July 30, 2006, defeating D'Lo Brown. Following his win of the Triple Crown on 3 July 2006, Taiyo Kea named Kawada as the first challenger for the title, and the match was held at the inaugural Pro Wrestling Love in Ryogoku event on 27 August. However, Kawada was unsuccessful, falling to his own finishing maneuver (the powerbomb). Kawada continued to compete in both All-Japan and HUSTLE, as well as defeating Shinsuke Nakamura at the All-Japan/New Japan \"Wrestle Kingdom\" supershow on January 4, 2007 with a running kick to the face. At Pro Wrestling Love in Ryogoku, Vol. 2 (on February 17, 2007), Toshiaki Kawada and Taiyo Kea defeated RO'Z and Suwama for the World Tag Team Championship; this win gives Kawada his ninth reign with the championship, as well as Kea's 5th reign. From March 26–30, 2007, Toshiaki Kawada competed in the year's Champion Carnival tournament, going all the way to the finals where he fell to Keiji Mutoh; Kawada finished the tournament with 5 points (2 wins, 2 losses and 1 draw). During the Hold Out Tour on April 22, 2007, Toshiaki Kawada lost to Vampiro, after the Great Muta had interfered and sprayed mist in Kawada's eyes. Muta and Vampiro later challenged Kea and Kawada for the World Tag Team Championship at Pro Wrestling Love in Nagoya (on April 30), but Kawada and Kea were successful in their defense of the belts. On June 24, 2007, Satoshi Kojima turned his back on All-Japan Pro Wrestling and aligned himself with All-Japan's nemesis, the Voodoo Murders group; this angered Kawada, who had left Kojima to lead All-Japan when he lost the Triple Crown in 2005. On August 26, 2007 at Pro Wrestling Love in Ryogoku, Vol. 3, Kawada and Kea lost the World Tag Team Championship to Satoshi Kojima and TARU. On September 16, following the conclusion of the opening show for the 2007 Flashing Tour, Kawada issued a challenge to Kensuke Sasaki for the Triple Crown Championship; Sasaki accepted, and Kawada challenged for the title at All-Japan's 35th Anniversary Pro Wrestling Love in Yoyogi show on October 18, 2007. Kawada also teamed with Ryuji Hijikata to challenge Sasaki and Katsuhiko Nakajima on September 29, 2007, at the final show of the Flashing Tour. Kawada competed in Block A of the 2008 Champion Carnival in April, where he most notably wrestled Hiroshi Tanahashi to a draw, and pinned Keiji Muto in what would be his final All Japan match on April 9, 2008.\n\nOn October 3, 2009, at the Mitsuharu Misawa memorial show, Kawada and Akira Taue reunited the Holy Demon Army for one night and defeated Jun Akiyama and KENTA. Three weeks later, he defeated Masato Tanaka to win the Zero1 World Heavyweight Championship. Kawada returned to NOAH in late February 28, 2010, trading victories with Takeshi Morishima. Two weeks Later, Kawada would be announced as a part of NOAH's inaugural Global League. On April 11 he lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Kohei Sato. In the Global League, he earned second place in his group and thus did not compete in the final.\n\nOn August 15 he participated in the last card of New Japan's G1 Climax tournament for the year, teaming with mentor Tenryu and Tiger Mask to defeat Riki Choshu, Junji Hirata and Akira Nogami. This turned out to be the last match Kawada has wrestled to date. Although at the time, Kawada hadn't announced a formal retirement, he admitted that the death of his rival Misawa in 2009 diminished his passion for the sport. In 2013, he attended Kenta Kobashi's own retirement ceremony and greeted his also former rival; however he refused to participate in Akira Taue's retirement match later in the year, although he similarly attended the ceremony and greeted Taue.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2322620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322620", "title": "Crazy as a Soup Sandwich", "text": "Crazy as a Soup Sandwich\n\n\"Crazy as a Soup Sandwich\" is the sixty-third episode, and the twenty-eighth episode of the third season (1988–89), of the television series \"The Twilight Zone\". The episode was written by author Harlan Ellison. The episode's script would later be adapted into a segment of the NOW Comics' comic book in the 1990s.\n\n“As certain as death and taxes, we are told the meek will definitely inherit the earth. Perhaps, but not always. Consider if you will, Mr. Arky Lochner, a well-known petty crook, sidebar: six for fiver Shylock, registered coward, and owner of a yellow streak so vivid it could be slathered on a hot dog. Now Mr. Lockner was written out of the will when the meek were guaranteed their inheritance. And just now, he's trying to avoid another kind of payoff. A soulful payoff, in that off track betting parlor we call... the Twilight Zone.”\n\nA petty con man named Arky Lochner fumbles and stumbles down a dark alley with something following him. A demonic creature in the shape of a cloud claims in rather colorful language that Arky is a fool and shouldn't have tried to outwit him. Arky claims he has two days before the demon has the right to do anything to him. In the demon's moment of indecision, Arky runs off and into \"Nino's Toys and Imports\". He runs into the office of Mr. Nino Lancaster and begs Nino for help from the demon, even though he owes Nino a great deal of money. Arky tries to explain that the money lent to him by Nino was spent to make a deal with a demon named Volkerps to pick horse winners in exchange for his soul. The only problem is the horses all died as they crossed the finish line, either packed full of dope or due to other maladies which caused Arky to lose despite the horses' win.\n\nNino, oddly enough, doesn't appear surprised and decides to help Arky. First, Nino wants to know how Arky found this demon and Arky claims beauty shop owner Cassandra Fishbein located the demon for him. When she refuses to help, Nino finds a way to persuade her and demands a meeting with Volkerps immediately. Cassandra calls on Volkerps but he kills her and then turns his eyes to Nino. Arky runs out of the shop with one of Nino's goons, and they go back to the toy and import building, thinking that Nino is dead. But Nino arrives and adjusts himself - smoke rising from his suit. Apparently, Nino managed to get away but just barely, and he sends his goons to get a hundred gallons of lead paint to cover every inch of the office - ten times over. Nino then leaves to procure an item that will defeat the demon.\n\nNino returns with a small stone box and waits for Volkerps to arrive around midnight. As the clock strikes midnight, Volkerps appears in the office in a flash of light, and Nino tells him to cancel the contract with Arky to avoid a severe punishment. Volkerps laughs at this, but Nino has Arky and his secretary close the door. Then Nino pulls something out of the stone box and uses it to strike Volkerps with bolts of energy which hurts the demon. Then Nino uses the bolts of energy to drive Volkerps into confinement within the stone box. Apparently, Nino had dealt with Volkerps' father and trapped him within the box too. Now, all Arky has to do is make a deal with Nino, whose eyes begin glowing, revealing to Arky that Nino is also a supernatural being.\n\nThe episode's teleplay later appeared in Ellison's short story collection \"Slippage\". \"The New York Times\" described the screenplay as \"whimsical\". K.C. Locke gave \"Crazy as a Soup Sandwich\" a mixed review, stating that it would have been better represented in comic-book form as opposed to screenplay form. However, Locke also commented that the story does keep with the theme of the collection, and that \"the teleplay...is almost as much, and in some cases more, fun than Mr. Ellison's more-traditional presentation of the story.\"\n\nIn 1991, the screenplay was adapted into a segment of NOW Comics' \"Twilight Zone\" comic book, illustrated by artist Neal Adams, whom Ellison personally asked for. In an interview, Ellison said that working with Adams was difficult. Ellison stated that the two would often argue over which minor details to include in the comic, describing Adams as being \"even more obstinately singleminded\" than he is. However, he would still work with Adams again if given the chance.\n\n"}

{"id": "2322625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322625", "title": "KWTV-DT", "text": "KWTV-DT\n\nKWTV-DT, virtual channel 9 (UHF digital channel 25), is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States. It serves as the flagship television property of locally based owner Griffin Communications, and is part of a duopoly with MyNetworkTV affiliate KSBI (channel 52). The two stations share studios on Kelley Avenue and 74th Street (near North Lincoln Boulevard) in northeast Oklahoma City, adjacent to the studios and main offices of the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority (OETA) PBS member network; KWTV's transmitter is located between 122nd Street and the John Kilpatrick Turnpike, also on the city's northeast side.\n\nOn cable, KWTV is available on Cox Communications channel 10 (standard definition) and digital channel 710 (high definition) and AT&T U-verse channels 9 (standard definition) and 1009 (high definition) in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area, and on either channel 9 on most cable systems elsewhere within the Oklahoma City DMA as well as on satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network.\n\nJohn Toole \"J. T.\" Griffin—the owner and president of the Griffin Grocery Company, a Muskogee-based wholesaler and manufacturer of condiments and baking products that he inherited from his father, John Taylor Griffin, after the elder company co-founder died in 1944—became interested in television broadcasting around 1950, after noticing during one of his commutes that many homes in the Oklahoma City area had installed outdoor antennas to receive the signal of primary NBC affiliate WKY-TV (channel 4, now KFOR-TV), the first television station ever to sign on in Oklahoma, which began operation on June 6, 1949. In an effort to secure a grant to operate a television station in Oklahoma City, Griffin—who first entered the broadcasting industry in October 1938, when he purchased local radio station KOMA (1520 AM, now KOKC) from Hearst Radio for $315,000—filed competing construction permit/license applications to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under two separate companies in which he held ownership interests.\n\nOn September 5, 1951, the Oklahoma Television Corporation—a consortium led by Griffin (who, along with sister Marjory Griffin Leake and brother-in-law James C. Leake, became the company's majority owners in July 1952, with a collective 92.7% controlling interest) and investors that included former Oklahoma Governor Roy J. Turner, company executive vice president Edgar T. Bell (who would later serve as channel 9's first general manager), and Video Independent Theatres president Henry Griffing (who acted as a trustee on behalf of the regional movie theater operator)—filed an application for a construction permit to build and license to operate a television station on VHF channel 9. On June 27, 1952, KOMA Inc., a licensee corporation of KOMA radio that was largely owned by Griffin and the Leakes, filed a separate application to operate channel 9. The FCC eventually granted the license to the Oklahoma Television Corporation on July 22, 1953, after the company struck an agreement with KOMA Inc. days prior to merge their respective bids, in exchange for KOMA purchasing 50% of the shares in Oklahoma Television that were owned by that group's original principal investors. (Under FCC procedure, the Commission's Broadcast Bureau board decided on license proposals filed by \"survivor\" applicants at the next scheduled meeting following the withdrawal of a competing bid.) Instead of using the KOMA calls assigned to the radio station, the Griffin group chose instead to request KWTV (for \"World's Tallest Video\") as the television station's call letters, in reference to the transmission tower that was being built behind its studio facility (which was also under construction at the time) on open land near Northeast 74th Street and North Kelley Avenue; the land plot was purchased by KOMA in 1950, with the intention of developing it for a television broadcast facility. (KOMA would vacate its facilities at the now-demolished Biltmore Hotel in downtown Oklahoma City once the Kelley Avenue building was completed.)\n\nAfter conducting initial test pattern transmissions beginning on December 8, KWTV officially signed on the air on December 20, 1953. The station's first broadcast was a special 30-minute ceremony inaugurating channel 9's launch at 7:00 p.m. that evening, respectively featuring speeches from Griffin, Bell and Turner, announcements of station policies, and an introduction of station stockholders and employees. KWTV was the third and last commercial television station to sign on in the Oklahoma City market during 1953: two UHF stations—KTVQ (channel 25, allocation now occupied by Fox affiliate KOKH-TV), an ABC affiliate that launched on October 28, and KLPR-TV (channel 19, allocation now occupied by Cornerstone Television affiliate KUOT-CD), a DuMont Television Network affiliate that debuted on November 8—would eventually cease operations within three years of their respective debuts. Originally broadcasting daily from 6:00 a.m. to midnight, channel 9 has been a CBS television affiliate since its debut, assuming the local programming rights from WKY-TV, which aired select network shows on a secondary basis since it signed on 4½ years earlier; the affiliation owed to KOMA radio's longtime partnership with the CBS Radio Network, which had been affiliated with its then-radio sister since 1929. KWTV also maintained a secondary affiliation with DuMont, from which WKY-TV had also carried selected programs, until the network discontinued operations in August 1956. On October 15, 1956, KWTV began carrying programming from the NTA Film Network; channel 9 served as the programming service's secondary Oklahoma City affiliate, offering a limited schedule of drama and comedy series. (Most of NTA other shows were shown on WKY-TV, while ABC affiliate KGEO-TV only aired its \"NTA Film Spectacular\" anthology series.) This relationship lasted until National Telefilm Associates discontinued the service in November 1961, when KWTV became exclusively affiliated with CBS.\n\nChannel 9—which is one of the few television stations in the United States to have had the same callsign, ownership, primary network affiliation and over-the-air channel allocation throughout its history—temporarily transmitted its signal from KOMA's broadcast tower near the television station's Kelley Avenue studios. KWTV activated its permanent transmission facility in September 1954; at , the tower—which cost $650,000 to construct and weighed —became the tallest man-made structure and the tallest free-standing broadcast tower in the world at that time. (It would be surpassed for the title in December 1956, when Roswell, New Mexico-based KSWS-TV [now KOBR] activated a guy-wired tower in Caprock, New Mexico.) To commemorate the new tower, an event that KWTV management estimated had 5,000 attendees, an amateur photography competition was held in which the winning pictures of the tower (with photography equipment donated by local camera stores being awarded to the finalists) would be chosen for inclusion in station publicity advertisements. A young Johnny Carson, then the host of the CBS game show \"Earn Your Vacation\", served as master of ceremonies for the tower's dedication. The Oklahoma Educational Television Authority (OETA)—which, per an agreement with the Oklahoma Television Corporation, was granted free use of the land near the KWTV studio and transmitter—became a tenant on the tower in April 1956, when the educational broadcaster's flagship station KETA-TV (channel 13) activated its transmitter. (The tower was decommissioned following the transition of KWTV and KETA to digital-only broadcasts in the spring of 2009, as their digital transmitters were located on a separate tower between 122nd Street and the John Kilpatrick Turnpike; the antenna and the upper half of the tower were physically disassembled by engineers and crane equipment during the summer of 2014, and its remnant sections were imploded that October.) The station relocated its operations into its new Kelley Avenue studio facility on October 17, 1954.\n\nSome of the local programs that channel 9 produced over the years have included the children's program \"Miss Fran from Storyland\", in which host Fran Morris—who hosted the show from 1958 to 1967, during her tenure as KWTV's director of educational programming, before moving to WKY-TV/KTVY to host the similarly formatted \"Sunday Morning with Miss Fran\" for an additional 17 years—told children's stories, conducted arts and crafts demonstrations, displayed viewer-submitted artwork on a \"storyboard,\" and occasionally showcased \"Davey and Goliath\" animated shorts; \"The Gaylon Stacy Show\", a half-hour morning talk-variety program—whose host had also helmed two other shows during his tenure at KWTV, the Saturday morning children's show \"Junior Auction\" and the variety-game show \"You Name It\"—that ran from 1960 to 1970, which featured live guests and on-location celebrity interviews; and \"Foods 'n Focus\", a five-minute-long, Oklahoma Natural Gas-produced cooking show hosted by Jane Frye that ran from 1973 to 1977. The Griffin-Leake interests sold KOMA (which, , is now owned by Oklahoma City-based Tyler Media) to Radio Oklahoma, Inc.—an investor-owned group led by radio executive Burton Levine—on November 20, 1956 for $342,500, but chose to retain ownership of KWTV.\n\nOver the years, the Griffin family owned other television stations in Oklahoma and Arkansas. On December 15, 1953 (five days before KWTV signed on), the Griffin-Leake partnership launched their first television station, ABC affiliate KATV in Little Rock, Arkansas; the group would later sign on their second ABC-affiliated station, KTVX (now Tulsa-based KTUL) in Muskogee, on September 18, 1954. Post-split from Leake, Griffin Television bought NBC affiliate KPOM-TV (now Fox affiliate KFTA-TV) in Fort Smith from Ozark Broadcasting Co. in September 1985; then in October 1989, it signed on KFAA (now KNWA-TV) in Rogers as a satellite station serving Fayetteville and other areas of northwest Arkansas that could not receive KPOM's signal. (KPOM and KFAA were owned by the Griffins until 2004, when it sold the two stations to the Nexstar Broadcasting Group.) Griffin Communications re-entered the Tulsa market with its October 2000 purchase of fellow CBS affiliate KOTV from the Belo Corporation; Griffin gained a second station in that market when it purchased Muskogee-based WB affiliate KWBT (now CW affiliate KQCW-DT) from Cascade Broadcasting Group in October 2005.\n\nIn April 1961, Triarko Ltd.—a subsidiary of RKO General—purchased a controlling stake in Video Independent Theatres from the estate of the late Henry Griffing. On paper, the 12.5% interest in KWTV included in the deal effectively gave RKO its fifth VHF television station, putting it at the maximum then allowed under FCC ownership rules (alongside its wholly owned station properties in New York City, Los Angeles, Boston and Memphis as well as a controlling stake in a Canadian station in Windsor, Ontario that dually served the Detroit market). This created an issue for a then-ongoing and complex transaction in which RKO was to have acquired WRC-TV and WRC-AM-FM (now WTEM and WKYS) in Washington, D.C. from NBC, trade WNAC-TV (now defunct; former channel allocation now occupied by WHDH), WNAC-AM (now WRKO) and WRKO-FM (now WBZ-FM) in Boston to NBC in exchange for the WRCV television and radio stations (now KYW-TV and KYW (AM)) in Philadelphia, and sell the Washington-based WGMS radio stations (now WWRC and WTOP-FM) to Crowell-Collier Broadcasting. Philco—which protested the 1957 license renewal of WRCV-TV-AM to NBC amid questions over the legality of its purchase of the stations from Westinghouse in exchange for WTAM-AM-FM and WNBK television (now WKYC) in Cleveland the year before—took issue with whether RKO's interest in KWTV violated FCC ownership rules. Addressing this, in August 1962, RKO agreed to sell its stake in channel 9 to minority stockholders Roy Turner and Luther Dulaney, increasing their individual interests in the station to 18.75%.\nOn November 29, 1963, the Griffin-Leake interests purchased Turner and Dulaney's 25% interests in KWTV for $200,000 and title rights to the equipment used by KWTV, KTUL and KATV. Turner and Dulaney would then sell the equipment, valued at $2.3 million, to First National Bank of Oklahoma City executives C.A. Voss and James Kite for $3 million. Griffin-Leake's Oklahoma stations would then be folded into KATV parent licensee KATV Inc. (subsequently rechristened as Griffin-Leake TV), which would enter into a ten-year, $4.5 million (or $37,500 per month) agreement with Voss and Kite to lease the equipment. Griffin and the Leakes would own approximately all of the common voting stock and collectively own 84% of nonvoting common shares in KATV Inc. post-merger, with 10% of the remaining nonvoting interest held by Edgar Bell (who would remain KWTV's executive vice president and general manager).\n\nIn early 1964, KWTV's Kelley Avenue facility was expanded to include a new soundstage on the building's west end (which would incorporate transistorized broadcasting and recording equipment), and a separate control room and production facilities. On April 17, 1969, Griffin-Leake TV announced its intent to split its assets into two separate companies. Griffin would retain ownership of KWTV under the rechristened entity that became Griffin Television Inc. (renamed Griffin Communications in 2000), while Leake retained ownership of KATV, KTUL, Ponca City-based cable television operator Cable TV Co. of Oklahoma, and a controlling 80% interest in the construction permit for Fajardo, Puerto Rico television station WSTE (now WORO-DT) through the spin-off entity Leake TV, Inc. In 1982, with the launch of the overnight news program \"CBS News Nightwatch\", KWTV became the first television station in the Oklahoma City market to maintain a 24-hour programming schedule on weekdays (KTVY had begun maintaining a 24-hour schedule on Fridays and Saturdays in 1978); the station would not adopt a 24-hour schedule regularly until the launch of \"CBS News Up to the Minute\" in September 1992.\n\nOwnership of KWTV would transfer to the familial heirs of John Griffin—widow Martha Watson Griffin (who also assumed her husband's post as KWTV board chairman), and sons John W. and David Griffin (both of whom would become KWTV executives in 1990, with David eventually taking over as President of Griffin Communications in 2001)—after he died on July 26, 1985 at the age of 62. That year, KWTV began producing \"Bingomania\" (a co-production with Dayton, Ohio-based Prijatel Productions), a half-hour bingo game show—developed as a relaunch of the local program \"$20,000 Jackpot Bingo\", which premiered on the station in September 1985—that was briefly available in limited national syndication through licensing deals with individual stations; after a two-year run, the program was cancelled in 1987. On February 3, 1997, the station—which had branded itself as \"TV-9\" since 1981—modified its general branding to \"KWTV 9\" full-time and retitled its newscasts from \"Newsline 9\" to simply \"News 9\", which would be extended to a full-time generalized brand in May 2001.\n\nOn October 25, 2010, KWTV became the first television station in the Oklahoma City market to carry syndicated programming and advertisements inserted during local commercial breaks (including station and network promos) in high definition. On September 29, 2014, Griffin purchased MyNetworkTV affiliate KSBI (channel 52) from Oklahoma City-based Family Broadcasting Group (owned by a consortium led by former KWTV weekend evening meteorologist Brady Brus, which—under its former name, Christian Media Group—outbid Griffin to purchase KSBI in 2001) for $33.5 million. The transaction was finalized on December 1, 2014, making KWTV and KSBI became the fourth commercial television duopoly in the Oklahoma City market. KSBI subsequently migrated its operations from its studio facility on North Morgan Road in Yukon, into KWTV's Kelley Avenue studios on December 6 of that year. On March 1, 2017, in a move mirroring similar rebrandings made by Fox Television Stations for its MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated and independent stations around this timeframe, Griffin extended KWTV's branding to KSBI under the \"News 9 Plus\" moniker; Griffin Communications CEO David Griffin said the branding extension was designed to \"help create a more inclusive and consistent identity for all of our programming\".\n\nKWTV-DT2 (branded as \"News 9 Now\") is the second digital subchannel of KWTV-DT, which maintains a locally programmed rolling news format. Over the air, it broadcasts in widescreen standard definition on UHF digital channel 39.2 (or virtual channel 9.2 via PSIP). On cable, KWTV-DT2 is available on Cox Communications channel 53 in the Oklahoma City area, Fidelity Communications channel 9 in Lawton, Sparklight channel 33 within its southwestern and south-central Oklahoma systems, and on other cable providers throughout the market.\n\nNews 9 Now traces its history to December 3, 1996, when Griffin Television launched News Now 53, a local cable news channel originally developed in partnership with Cox Communications (which only served Oklahoma City proper and Forest Park at the time) and Multimedia Cablevision (which then served the remainder of suburban Oklahoma City, including Midwest City, Bethany, Yukon and Edmond) that primarily aired simulcasts of KWTV's daily newscasts as well as rolling repeats of the station's most recently aired newscast. (During its early years, News Now 53—named for its internally designated channel assignment on participating cable systems—also occasionally aired sports and special event programs that were either exclusive to the channel or had originally aired on channel 9.) The service's creation stems from a contractual stipulation incorporated into retransmission consent agreements that Griffin reached with Cox and Multimedia in August 1993. Initially available exclusively on Cox's Oklahoma City system, Multimedia began carrying News Now 53 on its suburban area systems (which, in January 2000, were sold by the Gannett Company to Cox) on January 6, 1997. The Cox/Griffin partnership launched a feed for the Tulsa area—offering newscasts from newly acquired sister station and fellow CBS affiliate KOTV—in May 2001 on Cox's northeastern Oklahoma systems (which the provider acquired from Tele-Communications Inc. eleven months prior.\n\nKWTV-DT2 first launched in October 2009 as a temporary simulcast of the primary 9.1 feed, while KWTV was in the process of moving the station's digital signal permanently to UHF channel 39, the physical digital allocation it used until the February 2009 termination of analog transmissions; the 9.2 subfeed was deleted after KWTV relocated to UHF 39 full-time on August 30, 2010. KWTV relaunched the subchannel on April 1, 2011, when Griffin Communications—which assumed ownership of Cox's ownership interest in the service—reformatted the Oklahoma City feed of News Now 53 under the standalone brand \"News 9 Now\". (Concurrently, the service's Tulsa feed was added onto a DT2 subchannel of KOTV under the moniker \"News on 6 Now\"). News 9 Now maintains the former News Now 53's format of running live and repeat airings of all KWTV newscasts, however it does not rebroadcast \"News 9 This Morning\" in its entirety—repeating only the weekday 6:00 a.m. hour and weekend 6:00 to 8:00 a.m. block, despite simulcasting the two weekday and one weekend hours that it does not rebroadcast. (All news rebroadcasts on the subchannel are accompanied by a ticker that displays current conditions and weather forecasts for major cities across Oklahoma and right-third-quadrant banner advertisements for KWTV and local businesses.) To fulfill Children's Television Act guidelines, News 9 Now also airs a three-hour block of educational programming aimed at older children and teenagers on Saturday afternoons.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKWTV-DT began transmitting a digital television signal on UHF channel 39 on December 23, 2003. The station discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 9, on February 17, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television (which Congress had moved the previous month to June 12). The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 39 to VHF channel 9. Due to reception issues in parts of central Oklahoma, KWTV was granted permission by the FCC to operate a secondary signal on its former UHF digital channel 39 under special temporary authorization in October 2009, mapped to virtual channel 9.2. On March 9, 2010, the FCC issued a \"Report & Order\", approving the station's request to move its digital signal from channel 9 to channel 39.\n\nOn April 20, 2010, KWTV filed a minor change application on its new channel 39 allotment, that was granted on June 10. Short-lived service interruptions began on July 29 to allow viewers to rescan their digital tuners to carry the UHF channel 39 signal. On August 16, 2010, the digital signal on UHF channel 39 added a virtual channel on 9.1, in addition to the 9.2 PSIP channel. KWTV terminated its digital signal on channel 9 and began to operate only on channel 39 on August 30, 2010 at 12:30 p.m.\n\nAs a part of the repacking process following the 2016–17 FCC incentive auction, KWTV-DT relocated its physical digital allocation to UHF channel 25 at 12:00 p.m. on November 27, 2018, although it continued to display its virtual channel number as 9 via PSIP. In preparation for the repack, KWTV began operating test signals of their main and subchannel on channel 25 (PSIP-mapped temporarily to virtual channels 9.3 and 9.4) on October 1, 2018; the UHF 25 test feed was converted into a simulcast of KWTV-DT1 and -DT2 (remapped to 9.1 and 9.2, respectively) on October 30, only for the simulcast to be embargoed from November 2 to 19 to comply with FCC regulations limiting the duration of simulcasts on transitional digital television signals.\n\nTo reach viewers throughout the 34 counties comprising the Oklahoma City Designated Market Area, KWTV-DT extends its over-the-air coverage area through a network of nine low-power digital translator stations – all of which transmit using PSIP virtual channel 9 – encompassing much of Western Oklahoma that distribute its programming beyond the range of its broadcast signal. \n\nKWTV-DT currently broadcasts the majority of the CBS network schedule, although its primary feed does not clear \"CBS This Morning Saturday\" to accommodate the Saturday edition of \"News 9 This Morning\" and the CBS Dream Team block, which run for three hours each. (The program airs instead on News 9 Now, following a simulcast of the local morning newscast's Saturday edition.) Channel 9 may preempt some CBS programs to provide long-form breaking news or severe weather coverage when necessary, or air prime time specials produced by the station's news department. The preempted programs may either be diverted on a live-to-air basis to KSBI (which also holds the right to air any preempted syndicated programs if KWTV airs extended news coverage in their time periods) or—less commonly since Griffin acquired KSBI—rebroadcast over KWTV in place of regularly scheduled overnight programs, although station personnel also gives viewers the option of watching them on CBS's website and mobile app, CBS All Access, or its cable/satellite video-on-demand service the day after their initial airing. (News 9 Now previously handled substitute CBS programming responsibilities from its conversion into an over-the-air-originated service in April 2011 until December 2014, when Griffin transferred those duties to KSBI upon assuming operational responsibilities for that station.) Syndicated programs broadcast by KWTV-DT include \"Dr. Phil\", \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", \"Castle\", \"On the Money\", \"Extra\" and \"Entertainment Tonight\".\n\nChannel 9 formerly served as the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA)'s \"Love Network\" station for the Oklahoma City market, carrying the charity's annual telethon on Labor Day and the preceding Sunday night each September from September 1973 until September 2010. For most of its run on the station, KWTV aired the telethon on a three-hour tape delay following its 10:00 p.m. newscast on the Sunday preceding Labor Day because of CBS entertainment and sports programming commitments. For this reason, KWTV elected not to continue airing the telethon for the September 2011 broadcast, when it was reduced from its original 21½-hour format to a six-hour prime time telecast on the night before Labor Day. (CW affiliate KOCB [channel 34] aired the telethon for its final two years as a syndicated telecast; the event—by then reduced to a two-hour special—moved to ABC, airing locally on KOCO-TV [channel 5], in September 2013 for the final two years of the retitled \"MDA Show of Strength\"s overall run.))\n\nSince its 1953 sign-on, KWTV has periodically preempted or given tape-delayed clearances to some CBS programs to air local, syndicated or special event programs. However, CBS usually did not raise objections to preemptions made by channel 9, since it has typically been one of the network's strongest affiliates. Until 1959, KWTV preempted the \"CBS Evening News with Douglas Edwards\" to air syndicated drama series. The station also preempted \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" and \"Face the Nation\" from September 1984 until August 1995, in favor of carrying an extended block of local and syndicated religious programs on Sunday mornings; from the time they regained clearance until 2005, both programs were shown on a half-hour delay to accommodate an additional half-hour of the station's Sunday morning newscast. After \"Face the Nation\" expanded to a one-hour broadcast in April 2014, as certain other CBS affiliates have done since that time, KWTV aired the first half-hour of the Sunday morning talk show live-to-air on Sunday mornings and the second half-hour early Monday mornings on tape delay—the latter scheduling being used previously for the show (in its former half-hour format) from June 1983 until KWTV's September 1984 removal of the program—until February 2016 (during this time, the program aired in its entirety on KWTV-DT2 off its \"live\" feed through a partial simulcast with the station's main feed during \"FTN\"s first half-hour).\n\nIn September 1993, the station began carrying \"The Price Is Right\" on a one-hour delay to air syndicated programs during the 10:00 a.m. hour, forcing \"The Young and the Restless\" to be moved concurrently to 3:00 p.m. After it had considered preempting the talk show because of contractual issues with its late-night syndication lineup shortly before it debuted that month, KWTV became one of a handful of CBS-affiliated stations to receive permission to air the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" on a half-hour delay, so as not to displace a secondary run of \"Jeopardy!\" it had aired after its 10:00 p.m. newscast since 1989 (it also aired \"The Pat Sajak Show\" on such a delay for the same reason during the 1989–90 season, when KWTV resumed clearance of CBS's late night block, which had aired instead on Fox affiliate KAUT [channel 43, now an independent station] the season prior). Channel 9 would eventually give in to airing the \"Late Show\" in its network-designated 10:35 timeslot in September 1994; \"The Price Is Right\" and \"The Young and the Restless\", however, would continue to air on a delayed basis until both shows returned to their recommended timeslots in September 2000. The station also delayed \"The Late Late Show\"—spanning the entirety of the Tom Snyder and Craig Kilborn versions, and the first six years of the Craig Ferguson version—until 12:07 a.m. from the program's September 1995 debut until March 28, 2011 due to its weeknight airing of \"Seinfeld\" (which moved to KOKH on the latter date). Channel 9 also aired the CBS Saturday morning children's block (now branded as the \"CBS Dream Team\") in two separate blocks until September 2010, with the majority of the block airing in pattern from 8:00 to 10:30 a.m. and an additional half-hour airing on a one-week delay at 5:30 a.m.\n\nSeven years before Griffin Communications acquired the latter station, KWTV and KOTV in Tulsa partnered to simulcast three games involving the state's two Central Hockey League franchises, the Oklahoma City Blazers and the Tulsa Oilers, during the league's 1993–94 regular season; the respective sports directors of both stations at that time, Bill Teegins and John Walls, conducted play-by-play for the broadcasts, with KWTV sports anchor Ed Murray (who would later become a news anchor in 1999, and remain in that role until his retirement from television news in 2013) doing color commentary. From 2000 to 2011, KWTV served as the broadcast home for Oklahoma State Cowboys and Cowgirls basketball games under an agreement with Oklahoma State University's Cowboys Sports Network syndication service; the station typically broadcast around three regular season games each year during the run of the contract, which usually aired on a Wednesday or Saturday during prime time.\n\nIn August 2013, channel 9 obtained the local television rights to broadcast NFL preseason games involving the St. Louis Rams produced by the team's in-house syndication service, the Rams Television Network; for the 2015 season, KWTV diverted broadcasts of the team's Thursday night preseason games to sister station KSBI. (Prior to its acquisition of channel 52, the Thursday games forced KWTV to air first-run episodes of the CBS reality series \"Big Brother\" in late night to allow viewers to watch or record the affected episode on a delayed basis.) KWTV/KSBI's contract with the Rams concluded after the 2015 season as a result of the team's move to Los Angeles effective the following year. (Ironically, most Rams regular season games air on Fox affiliate KOKH-TV by way of Fox's contractual rights to the NFL's National Football Conference, while KWTV only carried regular season games featuring the team if CBS was scheduled to carry an interconference games against an opponent in the American Football Conference, or after 2014, an NFC-only matchup to which Fox passed the rights to CBS under NFL cross-flex broadcasting provisions.)\n\nOn July 24, 2015, Griffin announced an agreement with the Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association (OSSAA) that would return high school football coverage to KSBI after a five-year sabbatical; as a byproduct of the deal, KWTV also maintained partial over-the-air rights to the OSSAA Class 5A and 6A football championships, which were split between the station's main channel, its News 9 Now subchannel and KSBI.\n\n, KWTV-DT broadcasts 39½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours on weekdays, five hours on Saturdays and 4½ hours on Sundays). The \"News 9 Weather\" team also provides local weather updates and, in the event of significant severe weather situations (such as a tornado warning) affecting portions of the market, audio simulcasts of long-form severe weather coverage for the Griffin-owned Radio Oklahoma Network and, through a content agreement with locally based Tyler Media Group, the Oklahoma City radio cluster of KOKC, KOMA (92.5 FM), KMGL (104.1 FM), KJKE (93.3 FM) and KRXO-FM (107.7 FM). KWTV also features select stories filed by Tulsa sister station KOTV-DT during its newscasts, and partners with that station to cover news events within the Tulsa market; both stations co-produce the sports analysis program, \"Oklahoma Sports Blitz\", which airs Sundays at 10:25 p.m. on both stations and has been hosted since its August 2001 debut by KWTV sports director Dean Blevins and KOTV sports director John Holcomb.\n\nKWTV has long had a rivalry with KFOR-TV, vying with that station for first place as the most-watched television newscast in the Oklahoma City market in most news timeslots. KWTV had the highest-rated late evening newscast in the United States during the May 2006 sweeps period, and its 10:00 p.m. newscast was the top-rated newscast in the nation in May 2007, and locally during the February 2012 sweeps.\n\nChannel 9's news department began operations when the station signed on the air on December 20, 1953, when it debuted a half-hour newscast at 10:00 p.m. (broken up, respectively, into 15-minute-long weather and news segments), anchored by Mark Weaver. Bruce Palmer, former news director at WKY (930 AM) and eventual national president of the Radio-Television News Editors Association, headed channel 9's news department as its director of news operations until his retirement from broadcasting in 1966. Palmer also conducted weekly editorial segments that dealt with pertinent local issues; the station's editorials, which continued for several years after Palmer's departure, would help earn KWTV several journalistic honors in subsequent years, including the Sigma Delta Chi Award and the National Headliners Club Award. To enable mobility in shooting spot news content, in 1955, KWTV staff photographer Bill Horton devised a saddle-based shoulder camera rig with a port to insert wet cell batteries on the saddle's rear and an Auricon Cine-Voice audio control panel (which was hooked to a dictaphone-style earpiece to monitor the audio recording) at front. By 1959, the station had launched a half-hour noon newscast and a 15-minute-long early evening newscast that led into the \"CBS Evening News with Douglas Edwards\". KWTV is purported to be the first television station in the Oklahoma City market to conduct consumer and investigative reporting, the first to utilize beat reporters, and was the first television station in the United States to air a consumer-investigative news program, \"Call for Action\", which was based on a KOMA radio show of the same title.\n\nIn 1962, assignment reporter Ed Turner (who later become the inaugural executive vice president of CNN upon the channel's launch in June 1980) received accolades for a series of reports on James Meredith, who in October of that year, became the first African American to enroll into and attend the University of Mississippi and whose entry led to civil unrest and rioting at the campus. From 1966 to 1971, KWTV utilized the \"Eyewitness News\" format, as it was becoming popular among broadcast stations around the U.S. (the \"Eyewitness News\" format would resurface in Oklahoma City at KOCO-TV, which originally used it from 1974 to 1977 and again from July 1998 until April 2013). In 1968, the station hired Paul R. Lehman as a weekend anchor and assignment reporter, becoming the first African American to work as a television reporter in the Oklahoma City market; given the lingering racial climate in the southern United States after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, Lehman's appointment was not without controversy, as some viewers who were displeased with his appointment called into the station's phone switchboard to complain, some of whom went so far as to lodge death threats against him. Lehman co-created and hosted a community affairs show aimed at black audiences, \"Soul Talk\", for the station in 1969.\n\nUpon KWTV's rebranding of its newscasts as \"Newsroom 9\" on September 13, 1971, as the Prime Time Access Rule (an FCC regulatory act that reduced the prime time schedules of the three major networks, which previously ran for 3½ hours, by 30 minutes) was being instituted, KWTV launched Oklahoma City's first hour-long 6:00 p.m. newscast, adding an additional half-hour to its existing early evening newscast, predating the expansion of KFOR-TV's 6:00 p.m. to an hour-long broadcast by 24 years. In November 1972, urban affairs reporter Andrew Fisher—while covering a staff briefing that followed the commission's monthly meeting—interviewed Oklahoma Securities Commission chairman Charles E. McCune about a security registration requirement for Los Angeles-based commodities broker Goldstein, Samuelson, Inc. McCune made an anti-Semitic comment regarding the company's fitness for operation based on its name and, later, with full knowledge he was being recorded by Fisher, said \"I think they are Jewish and I think that they are skunks—the name and what they've done,\" when asked what prompted the earlier remark. The interview led to his resignation (called upon by then-Governor David Hall) following the broadcast of the remark on the station's newscasts. H. Martin \"Marty\" Haag, who oversaw the news department at that time, left KWTV in 1973; that year, he brought over three of the station's top-tier reporters, Tracy Rowlett, Doug Fox and Byron Harris, to his new job as news director at WFAA in Dallas-Fort Worth as part of his successful effort to strengthen that station's news operation.\n\nIn 1976, Pam Olson became the first woman to anchor a local evening news program in the Oklahoma City market, when she was paired alongside Jerry Adams (who would later anchor at KTVY and KOCO-TV during the 1980s) on the 6:00 p.m. newscast. Olson's tenure at the station (ending with her departure in 1980 to become Atlanta bureau correspondent for CBS News, with Olson being replaced on the 6:00 broadcast by Debi Faubion) saw the airing of a documentary she wrote and produced in cooperation with the National Kidney Foundation, \"Gift of Life\", which chronicled four kidney dialysis patients awaiting transplants; the special led to the passage of a state law that created an organ donor registry and donor ID information on Oklahoma identification cards and drivers' licenses. That year, KWTV became the first television station in the Oklahoma City market to transition from film to videotape to record news footage, with the purchase of camcorder equipment it branded as \"Live MiniCam 9\". On September 18, 1978, the station split its early evening newscasts into two half-hour programs at 5:00 and 6:00 p.m., bookending the 5:30 p.m. airing of the \"CBS Evening News\", the former of which was the first 5:00 p.m. newscast to debut in the Oklahoma City market; also on that date, KWTV launched \"Midday\", an hour-long 11:30 a.m. newscast that was originally anchored by former KOCO anchor Dean Swanson (who was also lead anchor of the station's new 5:00 p.m. newscast), Laurie Heritage, Tom Mahoney and longtime morning weather anchor Lola Hall; the newscast was the first hour-long midday newscast in the Oklahoma City market, predating the expansion of KFOR's noon newscast by 14 years. (The midday newscast was shifted to 11:00 a.m. on February 4, 1980 to accommodate the hour-long expansion of its CBS soap lead-in \"The Young and the Restless\", and was subsequently reduced to a 30-minute noon newscast on September 15 of that year.)\n\nIn 1979, the station began utilizing a helicopter to provide coverage of breaking news events and severe weather, with the introduction of \"Hot Shot 9\" (renamed \"Ranger 9\" in 1981). A rotational camera was installed below the nose of the chopper (branded as \"EagleVision\") in 2000, superseding the need for an in-helicopter cameraman to film breaking news. The helicopter used for \"Ranger 9\" was sold to KOTV to replace its previous helicopter model in 2006, when KWTV purchased a $1.5-million Bell 407 helicopter, branded as \"SkyNews9 HD\" (now branded \"Bob Mills SkyNews9 HD\", through a sponsorship and brand licensing agreement with Oklahoma City-based regional furniture retail chain Bob Mills Furniture), which was the first in the market to be equipped with a high-definition camera that also has optical zoom capability (though helicopter images were not broadcast in HD until the station converted its news broadcasts to the 16:9 aspect ratio in October 2010).\n\nRatings for KWTV's newscasts—then branded as \"Big 9 News\", before adopting the \"Newsline 9\" moniker in August 1981—dropped to third place in 1980, partly due to a resurgent KOCO news operation, which overtook it for second place among the market's evening newscasts with the team of Jack Bowen, Mary Ruth Carleton, chief meteorologist Fred Norman and sports director Jerry Park. The station enacted a series of staffing changes to shore up its news viewership, resulting in the firings of longtime anchors Bert Rudman and Phil Schuman, and reporter Debra Lane during the early 1980s. Replacing Adams and Faubion on the 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. newscasts were Roger Cooper and Patti Suarez, who, alongside chief meteorologist Gary England and sports director Jim Miller (later replaced by the fall of 1981 by John Snyder, who was previously served as KWTV's sports director in the mid-to-late 1970s), led channel 9 to an intense battle with and, by the mid-1980s, eventually overtake KTVY for the top ratings spot in evening news. Channel 9 also poached several former KOCO personalities (including reporters Gan Matthews and Jennifer Eve, farm reporter Gene Wheatley, and sports anchor Tony Sellars) in 1984, amid a massive staff restructuring at channel 5 under newly appointed vice president of news operations Gary Long. They were later followed by the arrival of another KOCO anchor, Jack Bowen, who replaced Cooper as evening co-anchor in 1987. In 1986, KWTV rolled out a satellite news-gathering unit, \"Newstar 9\" a transportable video uplink system that the station used to cover news and weather events around and outside of Oklahoma.\n\nBill Teegins was a fixture for many years as KWTV's sports director (a position that the station briefly considered eliminating around the time of his arrival). Teegins—who joined channel 9 as Snyder's replacement in 1987 after working as sports director at KOTV in Tulsa, and would add duties as radio play-by-play announcer for Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball and football games in 1991—became known for his exuberant analysis style, his sports knowledge, and his catchphrases used during sportscasts and play-by-play calls (\"He got it!\" and \"Oh, brother\"). Teegins remained with KWTV until January 26, 2001, when he, two players and six coaching staff members with the Oklahoma State University basketball team, and the airplane's pilot were killed in a charter plane accident, in which a Beechcraft Super King Air 200 en route to Stillwater following a game against the Colorado Buffaloes crashed in a field during heavy snowfall near Strasburg, Colorado. Replacing Teegins as sports director was former KOCO sports director and former University of Oklahoma quarterback Dean Blevins, who had joined KWTV in 1997 as a sports analyst and co-host of the fledgling Sunday night sports analysis program \"Inside the Game\" (which evolved into the \"Oklahoma Sports Blitz\" in 2001) alongside Teegins.\n\nThree years after his unexpected firing, in July 1990, Roger Cooper returned as anchor of the 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. editions of \"Newsline 9\", after the station failed to renew Bowen's contract. (Bowen would subsequently return to KOCO as an early evening anchor; Cooper would depart KWTV for the second time in June 1993.) Former co-anchor Patti Suarez concurrently left to become 10:00 p.m. co-anchor at Fox owned-and-operated station KTTV in Los Angeles, and was replaced that August by Jenifer Reynolds (who joined KWTV as a State Capitol reporter in 1987). A duPont–Columbia University Award winner for her work at Stillwater public radio station KOSU (90.7 FM) while a student at Oklahoma State University, her 14-year tenure at KWTV (ending with her departure from television journalism in 2001, later to host the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation-produced \"Discover Oklahoma\" from 2003 until 2017, largely overlapping with the travel program's run on KWTV) also saw her conduct investigative reports that had led to reforms of state charity bingo laws, the closure of a chemical supply store that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) failed to shut down despite it selling chemicals commonly used to make illegal drugs and the dissolution of a DEA fund trust by the Oklahoma City Council, issues of corruption that spurred management changes at the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, and the implementation of the Emergency Medical Services Authority to provide EMS services in Oklahoma City. In May 1991, KWTV began providing closed captioning of its newscasts for deaf and hard of hearing viewers. The station became the third and last television station in Oklahoma City to launch a weekend morning newscast in July 1993, with the debut of a two-hour Saturday broadcast from 6:00 to 8:00 a.m.; the program was joined by a Sunday edition in September 1995.\n\nKelly Ogle joined KWTV as a business/investigative reporter and midday news anchor in 1990; his family has primarily been associated with KFOR-TV since his father, Jack Ogle, served as an anchor (and later, news director) at channel 4 from 1962 to 1977, although had a prior association with channel 9 through occasional commentary pieces that Jack conducted for the station into the 1980s. (Kelly's older brothers, Kevin and Kent, now both serve as anchors at KFOR, while elder niece Abigail Ogle works as an evening anchor/reporter at KOCO; younger niece Katelyn Ogle joined KWTV in February 2019 as \"News 9 This Morning\" \"Alert Desk\" reporter and assignment reporter for the noon and early evening newscasts.) Kelly moved to evenings in June 1993, when he replaced Mitch Jelniker (son-in-law of former KWTV president Duane Harm, and whom concurrently moved to the 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. newscasts) as lead anchor of its 5:00 p.m. newscast; he added duties as primary co-anchor of the 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. newscasts—first paired alongside Reynolds on those broadcasts—in 1995, after Jelniker accepted an anchor/reporter position at KMGH-TV in Denver. In 2005, Kelly began hosting \"My Two Cents,\" a Monday-through-Thursday op-ed segment during the 10:00 p.m. newscast similar in format to Jack Ogle's commentaries, which also features an \"open topic\" forum featuring comments responding to the editorials. Several of Kelly's special reports, feature and investigative pieces have earned him several journalism awards over his career with the station (including Sigma Delta Chi, Associated Press and Heartland Emmy Awards, as well as a 2009 Edward R. Murrow Award for his coverage of the aftermath of an EF4 tornado that destroyed most of Lone Grove); the Oklahoma chapter of the National Academy of Television Journalists also named him \"Best Anchor\" in 1999. Ogle's co-anchors have included Deborah Lauren (1993–1995), Robin Marsh (1995–2001), Reynolds (1995–2001), Ann Halloran (2001–2002), Amy McRee (2003–2010), and Amanda Taylor (2006–present: Taylor had joined KWTV in September 2006 as 5:00 p.m. co-anchor and consumer reporter; she added additional duties as the co-anchor of the 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. newscasts when McRee left in September 2010.).\n\nIn January 2001, KWTV entered into a content partnership with \"The Oklahoman\", which involved pool coverage between the two properties on major news stories and investigative series, KWTV-compiled local forecasts and a regular Q&A feature from then-chief meteorologist Gary England on the newspaper's weather page, and promotion of news stories and investigative reports in the newspaper and on channel 9's newscasts. That August, this relationship extended to the consolidation of KWTV and \"The Oklahoman\"s online presence under the \"NewsOK\" banner, which incorporated in-depth reporting combined with video supplied by the station, and utilized existing web staff from the respective properties. (Ironically the Gaylord family, who ran the newspaper from 1907 until parent company OPUBCO Communications Group sold it to The Anschutz Corporation in 2011, built and signed on competitor KFOR-TV in June 1949, and owned that station until 1976.) The collaboration ended in March 2007, when OPUBCO bought out Griffin's interest in NewsOK.com, which now exclusively operates as the website for \"The Oklahoman\".\n\nOn August 26, 2001, KWTV premiered the \"Oklahoma Sports Blitz\" (briefly titled OKBlitz.com from 2014 to 2015), a 45-minute-long—later reduced to 35 minutes—statewide sports news program created in partnership with Tulsa sister station KOTV and airs after the respective late evening newscasts on both stations; the program features sports highlights, analysis and commentary and utilizes the resources of the KWTV and KOTV sports departments. In October 2001, KWTV formed the \"Local News Network\", a news content pooling arrangement between KWTV and several radio stations owned by QuinStar Communications in small and mid-sized Oklahoma communities, which served as charter affiliates of the Griffin-owned statewide news service Radio Local News Network (RLNN; now the Radio Oklahoma Network). Under the arrangement, channel 9 anchors conducted one-minute-long news capsules that would air each half-hour in select morning and afternoon timeslots on the RLNN affiliates, with stories occurring within the affiliates' listening areas included on KWTV's newscasts.\n\nIn November 2006, KWTV debuted a high definition-ready news set designed and built by FX Group. On August 2, 2010, the 4:00 p.m. newscast (which debuted on May 8, 1995 as a half-hour newscast, moved to 4:30 p.m. on October 12, 1998, then moved back to 4:00 and expanded to an hour on September 7, 1999) was reformatted from a traditional newscast into a more feature and lifestyle-driven program. On October 24, 2010, KWTV became the second television station in the Oklahoma City market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition (the graphics, logo, \"Oklahoma's Own\" slogan and \"CBS Enforcer Music Collection\" theme that debuted with the change, were also adopted by KOTV that same day upon that station's upgrade to widescreen standard definition newscasts). On January 24, 2011, KWTV expanded its weekday morning newscasts with the addition of a third hour of the program at 4:00 a.m. In September 2013, KWTV expanded its weekend morning newscasts to three hours starting at 5:00 a.m. On August 16, 2014, KWTV expanded its existing 6:00 p.m. newscast on Saturday evenings to one hour, with the addition of a half-hour block at 6:30 p.m. In August 2015, KWTV adjusted its lower-third graphics—which were originally designed to fit the 4:3 safe zone for TV sets in that aspect-ratio—to fit 16:9, which would allow for the AFD #10 broadcast flag to be used to present its newscasts in letterboxed widescreen for viewers watching on cable through 4:3 television sets.\n\nIn February 2016, KWTV launched \"Drone 9\", a quadcopter—the first to be used for newsgathering purposes in the Oklahoma City market—that would be used to provide aerial footage as a supplement to \"Bob Mills SkyNews9 HD\". Likewise, sister station KOTV subsequently deployed a quadcopter branded as \"Drone 6\" (it is unclear as to whether it is just a single quadcopter used by both stations). On July 14, 2016, KWTV announced the implementation of \"StreetScope\", an Augmented Reality System developed by Churchill Navigation that overlays street and building names over live footage from the station's helicopter camera during breaking news and severe weather events; it is the first television station in the United States to use this technology.\n\nKWTV places a significant emphasis on weather, and has long been considered to be a pioneer in severe weather coverage and television forecasting technology. Most of these advances were attributed to Seiling native Gary England, who was often referred to as \"Oklahoma's #1 meteorologist\" in station promotions and newscast introductions for most of his tenure with channel 9. England holds the record as the state's longest-serving television meteorologist, working as chief meteorologist at KWTV from October 16, 1972 until his retirement from regular broadcasting on August 28, 2013, shortly before he assumed a newly created post as Griffin Communications' vice president of corporate relations and weather development (England surpassed Jim Williams, who had a 32-year tenure as lead meteorologist at KFOR-TV from 1958 to 1990, for the title in 2005). England—who, in 1986, would become the first Oklahoma City television personality to sign a million-dollar contract package—replaced David Grant, who succeeded original chief meteorologist Harry Volkman (whose tenure also saw channel 9 become the first station in Oklahoma City to acquire a weather radar) in 1960. England's weather coverage earned him numerous awards over his 41-year career with the station (including three Heartland Emmys, National and Regional Edward R. Murrow Awards and a Silver Circle Award, most notably for KWTV's coverage of a tornado outbreak that produced an intense F5 tornado that devastated portions of Moore and Bridge Creek on May 3, 1999).\n\nAt the time of England's hiring, KWTV relied on National Weather Service (NWS) data relayed by fax and teletype; the station began using weather satellite imagery provided by CBS for its affiliates in 1973. In 1973, England enlisted ham radio operators to serve as on-scene observationalists during severe weather situations, using a self-diagramed chart of central Oklahoma (divided into square diagrams) and an alphanumeric coding system he developed for the operators to relay their location. That February, Griffin purchased a World War II-era radar (similar in model to the WSR-57) from Huntsville, Alabama-based Enterprise Electronics Corporation, the first proprietary broadcast weather radar in the U.S (four years later, KWTV became the first television station in Oklahoma to have its own color weather radar). It was first utilized to detect a violent F4 tornado that caused extensive damage in Union City on May 24, 1973 (the original film footage from the accompanying televised warning was featured in station-produced weather promos in later years). England lamented the lack of warning lead time, specifically for tornado warnings (which, in 1974, when NWS protocol required storm spotters to visually confirm a tornado before a warning could be issued, averaged -10 to -15 minutes). In 1978, KWTV became the first television station in the U.S. to broadcast high-resolution weather satellite imagery (with the system being known as \"StarCom 9\").\n\nWith England's consult, John Griffin commissioned Enterprise Electronics to create a commercial Doppler radar for $250,000, spurred by successful testing of a prototype by the National Severe Storms Laboratory during the Union City tornado; the improved radar allowed KWTV to issue tornado warnings before the National Weather Service. The first commercial Doppler radar in the nation for forecasting use was installed at KWTV in 1981 (in late 1984, that radar was replaced by a Fast Fourier Transform system developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which featured an expanded scanning area with an accuracy of up to ). Two weeks after the radar was installed, on May 22 (shortly before it was shut down briefly due to the expiration of the radar's temporary operational license), it detected a tornado near Arapaho; that tornado—which was recorded by a photographer inside \"Ranger 9,\" which briefly was caught in the parent thunderstorm's inflow winds—became the first ever to have been filmed by a news helicopter. The first broadcaster-issued tornado warning indicated by Doppler occurred using this radar for a tornado that hit Ada on March 15, 1982; the ability to issue warnings ahead of the National Weather Service led to frequent disputes over jurisdiction in the issuance of severe weather alerts between the agency's Norman office and channel 9 into the early 1990s.\n\nFrom 1982 to 2006, England and the KWTV weather staff presented \"Those Terrible Twisters\" (titled \"Gary's Traveling Weather Show\" until 1986), a weather education tour around Oklahoma communities during the spring and summer that taught tornado safety information and promoted the station's severe weather forecasting efforts; the station also produced half-hour specials under that banner each spring, showcasing footage shot by KWTV storm spotters and behind-the-scenes video of its storm coverage. In 1990, England, with the help of a station technician, co-developed First Warning, a software product that displays a weather alert map (which was originally updated via manual input by weather staff) during regular programming, along with a crawl showing detailed alerts issued by the NWS and the National Severe Storms Forecast Center. (\"First Alert\", an automated iteration of the software, was developed by KOCO that same year.) In 1991, England convinced station management to hire a software development firm to create an application, which would be dubbed \"Storm Tracker\", an automated computer tracking system that projected the arrival time of precipitation at a particular locale. That year also saw the hiring of Val Castor, a studio camera operator who would eventually become the station's first in-house storm spotter; KWTV gradually expanded its spotter units, employing twelve teams by 1999. In 1992, the station introduced \"Storm Action Video\", a system (developed by then-evening anchor Roger Cooper) that sent near real-time video over cell phone transmissions using a MacIntosh computer combined with video compression codecs; a similar system that transmitted real-time cell phone video, using Colby Electronics equipment, was developed in 1993.\n\nIn 1998, KWTV became one of the first stations in the United States to introduce a model-based computer forecasting system with the introduction of \"MAX\", which compiled model data to display hour-by-hour forecasts up to 48 hours in advance. On June 13 of that year, during coverage of a supercell thunderstorm that spawned seven tornadoes across Canadian and northern Oklahoma counties, a camera atop the station's transmission tower caught the collapse of a nearby auxiliary tower operated by KFOR-TV and radio station WKY (930 AM) from intense downdraft winds. In 2000, the station introduced \"I-News\", internet-enabled software for personal computers that provides severe weather and breaking news alerts to users. KWTV debuted \"MOAR\" (for \"Massive Output Arrayed Radar\"; though colloquially referred by England as the \"Mother of All Radars\") on May 8, 2003 to track an F4 tornado that hit Moore; the radar used enhanced street-level mapping to detect the path of tornadoes and GPS to track the location of KWTV's storm spotters. In February 2007, KWTV debuted \"Storm Monitor\" (later known by its brand name of ESP for \"Early Storm Protection\"), which utilized VIPIR technology to measure a mesocyclone's strength and its tornado-producing potential.\n\nDavid Payne, who joined KWTV in February 2013 after a 20-year tenure as a morning meteorologist and storm chaser at KFOR, subsequently took over as chief meteorologist on August 29 of that year. In April 2015, KWTV restructured the extended forecast graphic seen at the end of its weather segments from a seven-day to a nine-day forecast, both in reference to the station's virtual channel number and to take advantage of the 16:9 frame (likewise, rival KOCO-TV subsequently altered its extended forecast to a ten-day outlook, known as the \"5+5 Day Forecast\", in reference to its virtual channel). On December 2, 2016, KWTV unveiled \"NextGen Live\", a dual-polarization Doppler weather radar designed by Baron Services, which conducts atmospheric scans at 6 RPM—a faster rate than the radars operated by its three main competitors, KFOR, KOCO (which both have their own on-site radars) and KOKH (which has a radar system that relays NEXRAD imagery from the National Weather Service)—to detect precipitation in real-time; the system operates at one million watts of power, and scans at both X & Y axis (the system is similar to KFOR-TV's dual-pol radar that operates at the same power and predates \"NextGen Live\" by ten years).\n\n\n\n"}

The two were heavily influenced by reggae and the punk scenes that were sweeping the UK. After several years touring northern Europe with punk/ska band The Managing Directors, the turning point came in 1984 when John Griffiths was on vacation in New York City and was impressed by a group of youths he saw at the Roxy nightclub breakdancing, and the sounds of DJ Red Alert.\n\nAfter returning to Wales, Griffiths fixed on the idea of marrying hip hop and left wing politics with his 3rd language, Welsh. Llwybr Llaethog's debut release was an EP for the Welsh record label Anhrefn Records in 1986, titled \"Dull Di Drais\", which combined Llwybr Llaethog's leftist political messages with what would become the band's trademark sound of turntable scratching, audio sampling, hip-hop, and cut-and-paste production. The band were also heavily promoted by British radio DJ John Peel.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2322629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322629", "title": "Baby Geniuses", "text": "Baby Geniuses\n\nBaby Geniuses is a 1999 American family comedy film directed by Bob Clark and written by Clark and Greg Michael based on a story by Clark, Steven Paul, Francisca Matos, and Robert Grasmere, and starring Kathleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd, Kim Cattrall, Peter MacNicol, and Ruby Dee.\n\nThe film has the distinction of being the first full-length feature to use computer-generated imagery for the synthesis of human visual speech. 2D warping techniques were used to digitally animate the mouth viseme shapes of the babies which were originally shot with their mouths closed. The viseme shapes were sampled from syllables uttered by the babies on the set.\n\nThe film grossed over $36 million worldwide. In 2004, it was followed by a sequel, \"\", which was a box office bomb, and received more critical reviews than the first film, getting nominated for Worst Picture at the 5th Golden Raspberry Awards. In 2011, an original series was announced. The series has so far aired in Italy and the Far East. Additionally, the series was released as a set of movies. \"Baby Geniuses and the Mystery of the Crown Jewels\", which features episodes 1–4, was released directly to video in 2013. Episodes 5–8, \"Baby Geniuses and the Treasures of Egypt\", came out in 2014, and episodes 9–12, were released as \"Baby Geniuses and the Space Baby\" in 2015. The series/movies follow the Baby Squad Investigators, or B.S.I., as they pursue Big Baby (voiced by Christopher Bones), his father Beauregard Burger (Andy Pandini), and the international thief Moriarty (Jon Voight).\n\nTwo scientists, Dr. Elena Kinder (Kathleen Turner) and Dr. Heep (Christopher Lloyd), use genius-baby studies to fund BabyCo's theme park \"Joyworld\". According to Dr. Kinder's research on toddlers/babies, babies are born possessing vast, universal knowledge and speak a secret yet impossible-to-translate baby pre-language called \"Babymantalk\". However, at age 2–3, the knowledge and language are lost as the babies \"cross over\" by learning how to speak human languages. Most of the babies raised in Dr. Kinder's underground research facility were adopted from the Pasadena City orphanage, transformed into little geniuses through use of the Kinder Method, and then used in experiments to decipher this secret yet impossible-to-translate language used by the seven baby geniuses.\n\nOne mischievous toddler, Sylvester (the only one of her toddlers raised via use of the superior version of the Kinder Method), nicknamed \"Sly\", makes repeated attempts to escape Dr. Kinder's research facility. One night, Sylvester goes into a diaper truck and succeeds. The next morning, he is surprised to run into his long-lost normal twin brother, Whit, in a Joyworld playground. Although Sylvester and Whit share a telepathic bond, each has no idea of the other's existence. The guards from Dr. Kinder's research facility capture Whit, mistaking him for Sylvester, and take him back to Dr. Kinder's research facility. Sylvester is taken home by Whit's adopted mother, Robin (Kim Cattrall), who is Dr. Kinder's niece. Dr. Kinder and the six other baby-geniuses are shocked that Whit and Sylvester switched places at the mall, but Dr. Kinder becomes excited and begins to see this as an opportunity to do a cross evaluation on the twins. However, when she comes to Dan Bobbin's (Peter MacNicol) place, she realizes that Dan can understand babies. After the attempts to retrieve Sylvester fail, Dr. Kinder decides to move the research facility to Liechtenstein, and they have no choice but to make Whit be the only normal baby to be raised in this research facility until they can find a possible way to get Sylvester back to her research facility.\n\nThe babies at Bobbin's place hypnotize Lenny (Dom DeLuise), the bus driver to drive to Dr. Kinder's research facility. Once at the research facility, Sylvester goes to the control room to set the robots from the theme park on the lab scientists. When the Bobbins return home, their natural daughter Carrie tells her father that the children are in Dr. Kinder's research facility. At the end of the fight, Dr. Kinder captures Whit and takes him to the helicopter pad on the roof. Robin and Dan chase them to the roof, where Dr. Kinder reveals that she and Robin are not related and that Robin was adopted at age two. After Dr. Kinder is arrested by the police, Sylvester and Whit come together on the roof to cross over.\n\nDan and Robin adopt Sylvester. And Dr. Heep is now in charge of Dr. Kinder's Research facility. Dan is still curious of the secrets of life; but, as the twins have crossed over, they no longer know those secrets. Carrie, their sister, doesn't reveal anything (just giving her dad a sly smile) because adults aren't meant to know their secrets.\n\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 2% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 44 reviews. Its final consensus reads: \"Flat direction and actors who look embarrassed to be onscreen make \"Baby Geniuses\" worse than the premise suggests.\" It was listed by leading American film critic Roger Ebert as one of his most hated movies and ranked as his worst film of 1999.\n\nThe film received a normalized score of 6 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 14 critics, indicating the reviews as \"overwhelming dislike\".\n\nThe film made over $5 million in its opening weekend, and was the 10th highest-grossing PG-rated movie of 1999.\n\nAlthough the film was not received well by critics, a sequel was made, titled \"\", due to its commercial success on home video. The sequel, like the original, was directed by Bob Clark and is widely considered among the worst films of all time, and received worse reviews than the original.\n\n"}
{"id": "2322632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322632", "title": "Hōjō Tokimasa", "text": "Hōjō Tokimasa\n\nThe Hōjō clan was, ironically, descended from the Taira clan, which would lose to the Minamoto in the grand civil war known as the Genpei War in the 1180s; however, as a result of their connection to the Taira, the Hōjō were also distant relatives of the imperial family. The Hōjō clan were in control of the province of Izu, which was in the east and quite far away from the center of power in Kyoto and the west.\n\nNot much is known about Hōjō Tokimasa's early life prior to Minamoto no Yoritomo's arrival in Izu. There is no information about his parents and early childhood, mainly because culture was not concentrated in Izu, but rather in Kyoto. Hōjō Tokimasa was born in 1138 into the influential Hōjō clan in the province of Izu.\n\nIn 1155, Hōjō Tokimasa married Hōjō no Maki, who became his official wife. Her maiden name is not known. Even the marriage date is not clear, and is based on the birth of their first child, a daughter, Hōjō Masako in 1156. Hōjō Tokimasa, as the head of the Hōjō clan, chose to stay out of the civil strife engulfing western Japan based on court succession disputes between the Cloistered Emperor Toba, his son Cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa, and Cloistered Emperor Suzaku, as well as a rivalry between the Minamoto clan under Minamoto no Yoshitomo and the Taira clan under Taira no Kiyomori.\n\nThese two disturbances, known as the Hōgen Rebellion and Heiji Rebellion, ended in a Taira victory and the rule of the Cloistered Emperors Toba and Go-Shirakawa. Minamoto no Yoshitomo of the Minamoto clan was executed in 1160; all but three of his sons also executed, and his daughters sent to convents. Of the three sons that were spared, Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Minamoto no Noriyori were sent to monasteries, while his eldest son, Minamoto no Yoritomo, only 13 years old, was exiled to Tokimasa's domain of Izu.\n\nTokimasa and Maki's next child, Hōjō Yoshitoki, who became Tokimasa's eldest son and heir, was born in 1163. The two also had another son, Hōjō Tokifusa, and while his date of birth is not known, it is estimated that he was born in 1165. There was also apparently a daughter, probably born in 1169. Yoritomo, at first, was just another political exile of the Taira living in Izu, but as Taira brutality grew against the Japanese people and the imperial court and nobles, the court itself grew weary of Taira rule, and particularly of the brutal Taira no Kiyomori.\n\nIn 1179, Minamoto no Yoritomo, the Minamoto exile from Kyoto, fell in love with Tokimasa's daughter, Masako. In around 1180, they wed. That same year, Prince Mochihito, a son of Cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa and a brother of Cloistered Emperor Takakura and thus an uncle of Emperor Antoku, who was half-Taira and had been placed on the throne by the Taira, believed the Taira had denied him the throne and called on the exiled Minamoto leaders to go to war and oust the Taira. Yoritomo declared war on the Taira, thus gaining his father-in-law, Tokimasa's support and the support of the Hōjō clan. That same year, Masako and Yoritomo had a daughter, Ō-hime, Tokimasa's first grandchild.\n\nYoritomo created his base and capital at Kamakura, in Izu. Hōjō Tokimasa became his de facto advisor. The Genpei War between Minamoto and Taira had begun. In 1181, Taira no Kiyomori died, leaving the Taira family in the hands of Taira no Munemori, his son and a hothead who had no knowledge of military matters. In 1182, Tokimasa's son, Yoshitoki, wed. That same year, Masako and Yoritomo had a son, Minamoto no Yoriie, Yoritomo's heir. This would also become Tokimasa's first male grandchild. The next year, Yoshitoki and his wife had their first child, a son, Hōjō Yasutoki, who would become heir to the Hōjō after Yoshitoki's death.\n\nThings were going well for the Minamoto against the Taira. In 1183, Minamoto no Yoshinaka, Yoritomo's cousin, took Kyoto before Yoritomo could. That same year, Yoshitsune and Noriyori, Yoritomo's brothers, arrived in Kamakura and joined the Gempei War on the side of Yoritomo. In 1184, Minamoto no Yoshitsune took Kyoto in the name of Yoritomo, and had Yoshinaka executed. By that time, the Taira had fled with the Emperor Antoku to Shikoku, and, in his place, the Minamoto (with the support of Cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa) enthroned Emperor Go-Toba, a younger brother of Antoku. In 1185, Yoshitsune defeated the Taira at the Battle of Ichi-no-Tani. Taira no Munemori and Taira no Shigehira were executed in Kyoto and Nara respectively, while the rest of the Taira, including Kiyomori's widow Taira no Tokuko and Emperor Antoku drowned at the Battle of Dannoura.\n\nMinamoto no Yoritomo was then the undisputed ruler of Japan, and the Genpei War was over with a Minamoto victory. Hōjō no Tokimasa was then in a very good position. Yoritomo did not move to Kyoto, but remained in Kamakura with Tokimasa. \n\nTokimasa was sent to Kyoto and the court of Emperor Go-Toba and Cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa. He received an imperial command for Yoritomo to \"hunt down\" Minamoto no Yukiie and Minamoto no Yoshitsune for their rebellion. \n\nWhen he returned, the first appointments of \"shugo\" and \"jitō\", the stewards and constables of the Kamakura bakufu, were apparently granted. In 1189, Yoritomo consolidated his power, executing his half brothers Yoshitsune and Noriyori.\n\nIn 1192, after the birth of Yoritomo's and Masako's second son, Minamoto no Sanetomo, Minamoto no Yoritomo was granted the title of \"shōgun\" by Cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa, who died later that year. Hōjō Tokimasa, as the head of the Hōjō clan, was thus the head of one of the most powerful families in Japan – he was the father-in-law of the \"shōgun\".\n\nIn 1199, Minamoto no Yoritomo died. He was succeeded by his son and heir, Minamoto no Yoriie, who himself was considered a minor at the age of 18. Yoriie was closer with his father-in-law, Hiki Yoshikazu, than he was with his own grandfather, Tokimasa. He despised his mother, his uncles, and the Hōjō family in general. He was thus independent and rash, unlike his father who depended on the Hōjō.\n\nIn that year, a regency council was created by Hōjō Tokimasa, Masako, and Yoshitoki. The most powerful person there (not counting the remaining Minamoto members there and the Hōjō) was Kajiwara Kagetoki, the governor of Sagami. Though he was very close with Yoritomo and trusted by Tokimasa, Yoriie disliked him, and he was executed in Suruga by the bakufu army in 1200. Though it is generally accepted that Yoriie was responsible for the order, it is believed that Tokimasa and the Hōjō might have also been behind it since the Hōjō clan did gain the province of Sagami. Tokimasa was made daimyō of Ōmi Province in the same year.\n\nTokimasa's calculations next turned on his grandson's father-in-law, Hiki Yoshikazu, who his grandson listened to more than he listened to his own regent, Tokimasa. Losing all hope of getting either Shogun Yoriie or Yoshikazu on his side, Tokimasa placed his bets with his other grandson, Yoriie's younger brother and Yoritomo's youngest son, Sanetomo.\n\nIn 1203, the 21-year-old Yoriie became extremely ill and weak, and Tokimasa produced a plan whereby Japan would be divided between Minamoto no Sanetomo and Minamoto no Ichiman, Yoriie's son, and very close to the Hōjō, who was planning to become the next \"shōgun\". Yoshikazu began to suspect something based on the attitude of Tokimasa, Masako, Ichiman, and Sanetomo, and hatched a plot to capture and assassinate Hōjō Tokimasa.\n\nWith the help of Ōe no Hiromoto, a trusted ally, Tokimasa found out about the plan and invited Yoshikazu to his home in Kamakura for Buddhist services. After Hiki exited the services, bakufu troops executed him. Following that, Hōjō troops entered Hiki's residence and executed high-ranking members of the Hiki clan, including Minamoto no Ichiman, who, though close to Tokimasa, was also close to his maternal grandfather. \"Shōgun\" Yoriie, bedridden, abdicated. He went to Shuzenji in Izu but was murdered in 1204. It is thought that this was plotted by Hōjō Tokimasa.\n\nAfter the death of Yoriie and Ichiman, Tokimasa installed Yoritomo's second son, Minamoto no Sanetomo, as the next \"shōgun\". Tokimasa began to chair the Mandokoro, while he and Ōe no Hiromoto exercised absolute power. In 1204, after the assassination of Yoriie, Hōjō Masako lost trust in her father, as she believed that he was behind the assassination of her son. It is also believed Tokimasa's wife, Hōjō no Maki died in late 1204.\n\nSoon afterwards, Tokimasa was convinced by one of his allies, Hiraga Tomomasa, that Hatakeyama Shigetada, who was married to Tokimasa's youngest daughter, was inciting rebellion in Kyoto against the Hōjō. Tokimasa, angered, ordered his two sons, Hōjō Yoshitoki, his heir, and his other son, Hōjō Tokifusa, to execute Hatakeyama. Yoshitoki and Tokifusa, who enjoyed good relations with their brother-in-law, protested, but Tokimasa ordered the execution of Hatakeyama himself. From then on, Yoshitoki, Tokifusa, and their younger sister lost trust in their father and his meddling. It is believed Hatakeyama was a rival power-holder to Tokimasa.\n\nIn 1205, Yoshitoki heard rumors from samurai that Tokimasa was planning to have Shogun Sanetomo assassinated. He heard that the heir was none other than Hiraga, who was responsible for the death of Hatakeyama. Yoshitoki, furious, and Masako, who was also scared about the fate of her last son, put Sanetomo under protective guard and had Hiraga executed in Kamakura in 1205. Yoshitoki then threatened to rebel against his father.\n\nTokimasa realized that Shogun Sanetomo was under protection, and, since Ōe Hiromoto died in 1204, he had no more allies left. He thus shaved his head, became a Buddhist monk, and retired from his post of shikken and head of the Hōjō family. He was succeeded by his eldest son and heir, Hōjō Yoshitoki, who became regent for Shogun Sanetomo and thus the second Hōjō \"shikken\".\n\nHōjō Tokimasa retired to a Buddhist monastery in Kamakura where he lived out the remaining years of his life, dying in 1215 at the age of 78.\n\n\n"}

Classes in bold are in use, whilst those in \"italics\" have been withdrawn.\n\nVehicle numbers are three to six digits long. The first (not always present) digit indicates the sector in which that vehicle operates:\n\nThe next (possibly first) two or three digits of a vehicle's number indicate its class, in loose bands corresponding to the traction and power output of the stock:\n\nThe final digits uniquely identify the engine within its class, but in the case of a three digit class number, the engine number may begin adding to the class number (for example, a Class 22200 may have a number beginning 222, 223 or 224).\n\nMultiple units are numbered the same as locomotives, but prefixed by \"X\" for DMUs or \"Z\" for EMUs. Diesel shunters are prefixed \"Y\". A now discontinued practice was to prefix the class number by the wheel arrangement.\n\nEach TGV trainset has its own number, found on the nose. Within the set, each vehicle is given its own number. The power cars are numbered by the standard locomotive numbering scheme, prefixed by \"TGV\". The trailers are given a number which consists of the first two digits of the power car's number, followed by the number of the trailer in the set, and finishing with the number of the trainset, prefixed by \"TGVR\" or \"TGVZR\", if powered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SNCF adapted the classification system introduced by the Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée in 1925. This consisted of a numeric prefix derived from the axle (not wheel) arrangement of the locomotive, a letter for the class, and finally a number for the locomotive with the class. SNCF's adaptations included using the axle arrangement in full, and reversing the class letters of tank locomotives. For example, the SNCF used 040.A., and 242.TA. where the PLM used 4.A., and 242.AT.\n\nClass letters A-N were used for existing designs, letters P onwards for SNCF designs. Others railways' designs taken over after World War II were usually given the letter U (American), W (British), X, Y, or Z (German).\n\nWhere locomotives were upgraded or rebuilt, the class letter changed, but not the number. While the \"Region Nord\" renumbered all their classes from 1, the remaining 4 regions re-used the last three digits of the old number in the new number.\n\nAs there were more classes that available letters of the alphabet, the axle arrangement was prefixed with a digit indicating the owning region: 1 \"Est\" (former Est and AL lines), 2 \"Nord\" 3 \"Ouest\" (former État lines) 4 \"Sud-Ouest\" (former Paris-Orleans and Midi lines) 5 \"Sud-Est\" (former PLM lines). Region 5 was later split in two, with the southern part becoming 6 \"Mediterranée\"\n\nLocomotives transferred from one region to another could change their class letter and numeric suffix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

He then decides to pawn what little valuables he owns, but the broker offers very little for what he has. The broker asks if he might have something else to offer, and Simon looks puzzled but is intrigued. The broker says that perhaps there is something else Simon has that he might want. He questions Simon about what he knows about \"memory-dipping\" which involves renting people's copied memories.\n\nA champion skier can copy the memory of his best race and one can feel what he felt—the exhilaration, the snow under the skis, etc. But copied memories aren't quite as intense as real ones, and it would be similar to watching a video that's been dubbed too many times.

Simon gets enough to pay his rent but discovers he needs even more, as his landlord threatens to evict him anyway if he doesn't pay him next month in advance. Later, Simon is looking at a picture of his graduation; he closes his eyes and is disturbed that he can no longer remember it at all. He soon runs out of money and returns to the pawn shop. This time he gives up his fifth birthday. This snowball effect continues as Simon gives up his first steps, his first time at the circus, and numerous others.\n\nThe unemployment agency eventually gives him a call to inform him that they have a job for him, but they just need to ask a few questions. He soon realizes that much of his college years have been taken, and he can't remember what he needs to get the job. He returns to the pawn shop and gives up the first time he made love. After the procedure, Simon demands his life back and pulls the broker's gun on him, demanding to have all the memories that he had sold restored to him, not caring which other person's life they may come from. The broker tries to comply, but he says it won't be easy. \n\nSimon has another appointment with the unemployment agency, and when he is questioned about his typing experience, the counselor wonders how a man graduated from what was a women's college at the time.

Cetera's marriage to second wife, Diane Nini had ended, causing the once busy songwriter to step away from the music scene. Between 1988 and 1992, his only musical activities were an appearance as a guest vocalist on Cher's 1989 single, \"After All\", a song on the soundtrack to the movie \"Chances Are\", \"No Explanation\" for the soundtrack to the movie \"Pretty Woman\", and a vocal contribution to David Foster's \"Voices That Care\" production, based on music that he and Cetera had written together years earlier. Deeply depressed, Cetera found himself using the album as an outlet to deal with his marriage ending and learning to be a single parent. Recording began in London England and occurred in short, spread out bursts as Cetera worked through the personal issues in his life.\n\nIn 1992, he explained to Billboard Magazine, \"This was actually the first time I could write about the other side of love. I'd try to write a happy love song and I just couldn't do it. Then I got mad and so everything was about hating the world. I finally settled on the truth.\"\n\nThe album was predominantly produced by Andy Hill and Cetera. Two tracks were produced by veteran producer David Foster who had worked with Cetera previously on \"Chicago 16\" and \"Chicago 17\" during his days as bassist and vocalist for Chicago. Former Chicago alumni Bill Champlin sings background vocals on the song \"Wild Ways\" and singer Chaka Khan stepped in to perform a duet on the song \"Feels Like Heaven\" after original partner Laurie Morgan was unable to perform the song in its intended key. Unlike Cetera's previous three solo efforts, Cetera co-wrote only four songs on \"World Falling Down\". The album also marked a brief return to bass playing as Cetera himself played the bass lines on \"Dip Your Wings\" and \"Where There's No Tomorrow\".\n\nReleased in the summer of 1992, \"World Falling Down\" was a commercial disappointment. Dance, rap and alternative-rock songs had begun dominating top forty radio, resulting in a decline in pop music that had been popular only a few years earlier. Many of Cetera's contemporaries, including his former band-mates in Chicago, found their singles struggling to get airplay and generate album sales.\n\nWarner released three singles, \"Restless Heart\", \"Feels Like Heaven\" and \"Even a Fool Can See\". Only \"Restless Heart\" made the top 40, peaking at No. 35 on the Billboard Hot 100, though it topped the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart at No. 1 for two weeks. \"Feels Like Heaven\" hit No. 71 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 5 on the Billboard AC chart. The third single, \"Even a Fool Can See\" performed slightly better, reaching No. 68 on the Billboard Top 100 and No. 3 on the Billboard AC Chart the next summer.\n\nAs with his previous solo efforts, Cetera declined to go on tour feeling that he didn't have enough solo material. The singer performed live on \"The Tonight Show\" and \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" to promote the album. In addition, Warner produced music videos for the first two singles, with Cetera's daughter Claire appearing in the music video for \"Restless Heart\". The final track, \"Have You Ever Been In Love?\" was not released as a single, but gained popularity when used by professional skaters in their routines. Cetera often closes live concerts with the popular album cut.\n\n\"World Falling Down\" reached a peak of No. 163 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart during a brief stay. Following its commercial disappointment, Cetera left Warner Brothers and signed to the independent record label, River North Records.\n\nIn 2010, a Heineken light beer commercial, \"Lady Music\", featured the album cover and the song \"Restless Heart\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is a part of the Central Okanagan Regional District, and of the Kelowna metropolitan area. The city of Kelowna lies to the south, while the city of Vernon lies to the north. As its name suggests, there are a number of lakes in the vicinity of Lake Country, and outside the municipal boundaries in the hills to the east. Okanagan Lake defines the western boundary of the municipality, while the entirety of Wood Lake and the southernmost portion of Kalamalka Lake are encompassed by it.\n\nLake Country was incorporated in 1995. The previously unincorporated communities of Winfield, Okanagan Centre, Oyama, and Carr's Landing were united to form the new municipality, and they remain as separate wards within it. In the municipal government, one councillor is drawn from each of these wards, while the mayor and two additional councillors are elected by the people at large.\n\nLake Country is the only municipality in the province of British Columbia to have the ward system.\n\nThe four wards of Lake Country are:\n\nPopulation: 11,708 (2011 Census Profile)\n\nPopulation Change (2006-2011): 21.9%\n\nLand Area (square km) : 122.19\n\nAge\n\nImmigration\n\nAboriginals & Visible Minorities\n\nIncome\n\nReligion\n\nMunicipal elections were last held on November 20, 2018. At that time, James Baker was elected mayor for a fifth term.

The two councillors at large are Bill Scarrow, and Penny Gambell. \n\nProvincially, Lake Country is part of the constituency of Kelowna-Lake Country, this seat having been occupied by Norm Letnick of the BC Liberal Party since May 2009. The next provincial election is scheduled for May 2017.\n\nFederally, Lake Country is part of the riding of Kelowna—Lake Country. Despite the similarity in nomenclature, the federal riding encompasses a greater area and population than its provincial counterpart. Stephen Fuhr of the Liberal Party was first elected as MP in October 2015.\n\nPublic education in Lake Country is provided by School District 23 Central Okanagan. Three elementary schools are located in the Municipality: Davidson Road Elementary, Oyama Traditional School, and Peter Greer Elementary. All three cover Kindergarten to Grade 6. Lake Country is also home to George Elliot Secondary, which covers Grades 7 to 12.\n\nThe two largest institutions providing post-secondary education in the area of Lake Country are UBC Okanagan, the campus which lies in north Kelowna, and Okanagan College, which has campuses in Kelowna and Coldstream.\n\nLake Country is situated on the major north-south route through the Okanagan valley, Highway 97, approximately 15 km of which lies within the municipality, passing through Winfield and Oyama. To the south, the highway provides a route to Kelowna, whose downtown core is 20 km south of the municipal boundary. Glenmore Road provides an alternate route to Kelowna. To the north, the highway leads to Vernon, whose downtown is 15 km north of the municipal boundary. Vernon can also be accessed via Commonage Road. Until 2013, the highway was only four-laned through Winfield and north of Oyama, while the section from Winfield to Oyama was two-laned. This two-laned section of Highway 97 became notorious for several major accidents and congestion and the highway was upgraded to a four-lane limited-access road, officially opened on August 16, 2013. The new highway was relocated further to the west of Wood Lake and the old highway was renamed to Pelmewash Parkway to accommodate future recreational corridor.\n\nA regular public bus service by Kelowna Regional Transit System, route 23, is available from Winfield to Kelowna at the UBC Okanagan exchange. A less frequent peak hour express service by Vernon Regional Transit System, route 90, is also available, connecting Oyama and Winfield with Vernon and UBC Okanagan exchange. A new bus service, route 32, establishes connections throughout the various communities in Lake Country.\n\nLake Country is in close proximity to Kelowna International Airport, which lies only 8 km to the south, and provides regular service to major cities such as Vancouver, Victoria, Seattle, Los Angeles, Calgary, Edmonton, and Toronto.\n\nIn 2016, Lake Country was one of five communities in British Columbia honoured with the Small Business Roundtable's Open for Business Award in recognition of local efforts to foster economic growth.\n\n"}
{"id": "2322682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322682", "title": "KNVA", "text": "KNVA\n\nKNVA, virtual channel 54 (UHF digital channel 23), is a CW-affiliated television station licensed to Austin, Texas, United States. The station is owned by Vaughan Media; Nexstar Media Group, which owns NBC affiliate KXAN-TV (channel 36) and Llano-licensed MyNetworkTV affiliate KBVO (channel 14), operates KNVA under a local marketing agreement (LMA). The three stations share studios on West Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and San Gabriel Street (between the Old West Austin section of Austin and the University of Texas at Austin campus); KNVA's transmitter is located at the West Austin Antenna Farm on Mount Larson (near Loop 360 and Westlake Drive, north of West Lake Hills). There is no separate website for KNVA; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station KXAN-TV.\n\nOn cable, KNVA is available on Charter Spectrum channels 12 (SD) and 1212 (HD), Grande Communications channels 12 (SD) and 812 (HD), Suddenlink and Google Fiber channel 7 (SD/HD) and AT&T U-verse channels 12 (SD) and 1012 (HD).\n\nThe UHF channel 54 allocation in Austin was contested between three groups that competed for Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval of a construction permit to build and license to operate a new television station. Capitol City Community Interests Inc. (headed by David L. Ferguson and owned by Allandale Baptist Church) filed the initial application on May 22, 1984. Local entrepreneur Jo Cardenaz Stolz (doing business as DB Broadcasting Inc.) filed a separate application less than two months later on July 10. Four other locally based groups followed suit on July 11: Balcones Broadcasting (majority owned by Houston-based attorney Billy B. \"Paz\" Goldberg [who held a controlling 80% interest], along with his daughter-in-law, Edila P. Goldberg [who owned 4%], television journalist and then-anchor at ABC affiliate KVUE [channel 24] Ronnell H. \"Ron\" Oliveira, and Edna I. Ramon [both of whom held 8% shares]), Lake Country Telecasters Inc. (jointly owned by Evangelina D. Martinez and Cynthia Sau-Fong Soo), Channel 54 Ltd. (later Television 54 Corp., and owned by Noemi Correa [who held 30%], Berl L. Handcox and his wife, Ruby Hancox [both of whom owned 40% interests]) and ATV Associates Inc. (owned by Karen S. Daigle [who held a majority 47.66% interest], Diana G. Louis [who owned 19%] and Frances Pico [who owned 33.33%]). On September 3, 1985, Capital City Community Interests had its application dismissed with prejudice per a request to the FCC filed by Lake Country Telecasters.\n\nIn an administrative proceeding, FCC Administrative Law Judge Joseph Chachkin conditionally granted the permit to Balcones Broadcasting on July 10, 1986, denying the applications of Capital City Community Interests, Television 54 Corp., Capitol Area Broadcasting, ATV Associates and DB Broadcasting. The grant was conditioned on Billy Goldberg divesting his interests in NBC affiliate KVEO-TV in Brownsville and KVEO (at which Oliveira served as an assistant to the station's general manager at the time of the grant and which Goldberg was in the process of acquiring at the time Balcones filed its application) and Odessa-based independent station KPEJ (now a Fox affiliate). Shortly after obtaining approval for the permit and license, Balcones Broadcasting chose to request KCFP as the planned television station's call letters.\n\nThe original decision was affirmed on October 30, 1987, when the FCC approved a settlement agreement between the seven applicants and granted Balcones's amended application for UHF channel 54. Balcones' grant was subsequently challenged by Frontier Southwest Broadcasting Inc., only to be upheld on April 15, 1988 on grounds that denying the application in its favor would otherwise nullify Frontier's existing construction permit for a low-power station on UHF channel 55. On October 12, 1990, Balcones filed to sell the license to 54 Broadcasting Inc. (owned by Ron Oliveira and Billy Goldberg, along with Billy's wife, Rosalie Goldberg, and son Mark Goldberg of private equity firm Goldberg-Hirsch Ventures and a special assistant to the Texas State Comptroller at the time, and Mark Cohen and Mitchel Levy of LS Communications) for assumption of liabilities and payments to the Balcones partners to cover permit acquisition costs. The transfer received FCC approval 17 months later on March 26, 1992. Partly as a result of the sagging Texas economy caused by the oil bust of the late 1980s, the Goldberg-Oliveira consortium could not economically start up the station until it obtained financial backing from Houston-based investment firm 21st Century Corp. Aiding in helping 54 Broadcasting get the station on the air was LIN TV Corporation—then-owner of NBC affiliate KXAN-TV (channel 36) and its Llano satellite KXAM-TV (channel 14, now MyNetworkTV affiliate KBVO)—with which the consortium entered into a local marketing agreement (LMA) in the spring of 1994, in which KXAN would provide technical, programming and advertising resources.\n\nChannel 54—as KNVA (meaning \"Nueva,\" in reference to the originally planned Spanish-language format)—began test broadcasts on August 24, 1994, in order to meet an FCC-required deadline to commence broadcasts by the end of that month to maintain the license. The station formally signed on the air one week later on August 31 (one week before Oliveira left his role as KVUE weeknight co-anchor to focus on managing KNVA). It was originally formatted as a 24-hour weather forecast service similar to the \"Local Weather Station\" format originated at the group as a cable channel operated by Indianapolis sister station WISH-TV – with content selected by the on-duty meteorologist—that featured loops of Doppler radar and satellite imagery, current conditions from KXAN's live weather observation network (along with maps detailing actual and apparent temperatures, and wind speeds within the viewing area), area lake levels, pollen counts, and local and regional forecasts as well as live and pre-recorded forecast segments presented by KXAN-TV's meteorologists. The format—which included breakaways for brief commercial breaks and customary station identifications—could also allow KNVA to provide supplementary live coverage from the KXAN weather staff in severe weather situations that did not warrant extended coverage on Channel 36.\n\nAmid a network realignment caused by New World Communications's affiliation agreement with Fox (which planned to move its programming to CBS affiliate KTBC-TV [channel 7]) and the launches of the United Paramount Network (UPN, a joint venture between Paramount Television and Chris-Craft/United Television) and The WB (a venture between Time Warner and Tribune Broadcasting), 54 Broadcasting considered making bids for the affiliation rights to either CBS or UPN. However, CBS would sign a contract with lame-duck Fox affiliate KBVO-TV (channel 42, which changed its call letters to KEYE-TV upon joining the network in July 1995), as it had been longer established (signing on in December 1983) and was the only television station in Austin not affiliated with the Big Three networks that had a local news presence; meanwhile, KNVA managing partner LIN TV acquired the UPN affiliation, but opted to carry the network on seven low-power repeaters of KXAN. Instead, on November 10, 1994, KNVA signed an agreement to become a charter affiliate of The WB.\n\nOn January 9, 1995, KNVA switched to a family-oriented general entertainment programming format, with program selections made based on suggestions from Central Texas residents; it originally carried a mix of classic and some recent off-network sitcoms and drama series, some feature films, first-run syndicated programs (including reality-based lifestyle and documentary programs and some scripted series), animated series, rebroadcasts of KXAN's local newscasts and a limited amount of Spanish-language programming. (Oliveira and his partners in the former Balcones Broadcasting originally considered operating Channel 54 as a Spanish-language outlet when the group submitted its initial application for the license, citing the lack of such an existing station in Austin even though the Hispanic/Latino populace accounted for roughly 25% of the area's total population.) Two days later on January 11, the station became a charter affiliate of The WB. Similar to other WB-affiliated stations of the period, KNVA—which initially branded as \"KNVA 54\"—filled the 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. time slot with first-run and off-network syndicated programs as The WB had only maintained a lineup of prime time programs on Wednesday nights at launch; this would become less of an issue as The WB launched additional nights of programming over the next four years, adopting a six-night weekly schedule in September 1999 (running Sunday through Fridays). By September 1995, KNVA began incorporating some series onto its schedule that KEYE was forced to vacate from its inventory to make room for the heavy amount of network programming brought on by its new CBS affiliation.\n\nKNVA gradually evolved its programming slate during the late 1990s, scaling back many of the classic sitcom reruns that populated its schedule and shifting its focus more towards a lineup consisting primarily of family-oriented sitcoms and first-run talk shows during the daytime hours, and more recent sitcoms and first-run and off-network drama series as well as select reality series at night. In September 2001, the station changed its on-air branding to \"Austin's WB 54\". By 2002, court shows and additional talk and reality series had been added to the schedule, while animated programs carried on KNVA's schedule were relegated to those coming from Kids' WB; it became the last station in the market that continued to run cartoons on weekday afternoons until the weekday edition of the block was discontinued by The WB in January 2006, when the network replaced it with the Daytime WB rerun block (which would evolve into The CW Daytime).\n\nBetween March and September 2003, the station acquired a few syndicated shows that had been displaced from low-power independent station K13VC (channel 13) after it was forced off the air to make room for the digital signal of Killeen-licensed Univision owned-and-operated station KAKW-TV (channel 62). (KAKW had originally served the adjacent Waco–Temple–Killeen market since its sign-on as a primary WB/secondary UPN affiliate in 1996 until shortly after its purchase by Univision Communications the year prior, when the station's transmitter was relocated southward to primarily serve Austin and surrounding areas of the central Hill Country.) KNVA switched to identifying as simply \"Austin's WB\" in September 2003, amid a growing trend among Austin's UHF television stations of reducing their dependence on referencing their over-the-air channel allocation due to the high cable peneration rate within the market in order to receive UHF signals that were otherwise impaired by the Hill Country's rugged terrain.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. Entertainment division of Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that they would launch The CW Television Network, a joint venture that initially featured programs carried over from The WB and UPN—which Time Warner and CBS, respectively, would shut down in concurrence with the new network's launch—as well as new series specifically produced for The CW. Subsequently, on February 22, News Corporation announced the launch of MyNetworkTV, a venture between its Fox Television Stations and Twentieth Television units that was created to primarily to provide a network programming option for UPN and WB stations not chosen for charter affiliation by The CW (which, in markets where the two predecessor networks were carried on separate broadcast stations, chose its initial affiliates based on the highest viewership average between the local WB and UPN outlets).\n\nAt first, those moves put KNVA's future in doubt, as The CW and Corridor Television announced on March 28, that it had signed an agreement to affiliate the network with Fredericksburg-based UPN affiliate KBEJ (channel 2, now MyNetworkTV affiliate KCWX, a callsign that station adopted prior to joining The CW in August 2006). However, even though it had been serving as the Austin market's de facto UPN affiliate since K13VC abruptly disaffiliated from that network in October 2000, KBEJ/KCWX serves and its city of license is considered part of the San Antonio market (to its adjacent south). As such, KNVA's only options would have been either to join MyNetworkTV or default to operating as an independent station. But in a surprise move on April 18, LIN TV—as part of an affiliation deal that also consigned sister stations in Columbus, Buffalo and Mobile to join the network—announced that KNVA would serve as The CW's Austin charter affiliate. Even if KCWX's de facto dual-market status was not a factor, there was a likelihood that KNVA would have been chosen to join The CW in any event as—even though Austin had been large enough to support six commercial English-language television stations since the late 1980s—the Austin market lacked a sixth full-power commercial station at the time, which would have left a subchannel-only affiliation with one of the market's Big Four network stations as the network's only other viable option. As a result of both stations choosing to affiliate with The CW, KCWX management decided to re-target that station exclusively towards the San Antonio market. To comply with FCC restrictions on network duplication by cable providers, Time Warner Cable (which had its franchise rights acquired by Charter Spectrum in 2016, via its merger with Charter Communications) began blacking out CW programming carried over KCWX within its Austin service area effective October 1, 2006; it continued to transmit KCWX's syndicated and paid programming until April 3, 2007, when the provider officially removed the station from its Austin-area lineup.\n\nOver a week after the CW affiliation announcement, on April 26, 2006, LIN—as part of a separate contract also covering sister stations in Indianapolis, Hartford–New Haven and Grand Rapids—announced that KNVA would also became a charter outlet of MyNetworkTV, offering its programming on a secondary basis. To date, KNVA was one of two American television stations carrying affiliations with both The CW and MyNetworkTV (the other being KWKB in Iowa City, Iowa, which would also drop MyNetworkTV and become an exclusive CW affiliate in September 2011). Until 2016, fellow MyNetworkTV charter stations WKTC in Columbia, South Carolina and WPWR-TV in Chicago (the latter serving as an O&O of the service) added primary CW affiliations while retaining a secondary MyNetworkTV affiliation over their main channels. (They were joined in August 2018 by WUAB in Cleveland, which also served as a dual affiliate of both networks until its MyNetworkTV programming rights were shifted to a subchannel of CBS-affiliated sister WOIO in February 2019; , WKTC and WPWR are the only two American television stations that carry both networks on their primary channel.) On August 1, a video posted to the KNVA/KXAN shared website revealed the station would be officially branded as \"The CW Austin,\" with MyNetworkTV programming branded as \"MyNetworkTV on The CW Austin\".\n\nKNVA disaffiliated from UPN on September 4 and replaced its prime time programming with the MyNetworkTV lineup upon that network's September 5 launch. Channel 54 remained a primary affiliate of The WB until that network ceased operations in September 17, and subsequently affiliated with The CW when it debuted the following day (September 18). During prime time, KNVA initially carried programming from both networks each weeknight (with The CW's prime time schedule airing in pattern from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. and MyNetworkTV programming carried on a two-hour delay from 9:00 to 11:00 p.m.). As the two networks did not have overlapping prime time schedules on weekend evenings, KNVA exclusively carried MyNetworkTV programs on Saturdays and exclusively carried CW programs on Sundays.\n\nOn July 27, 2009, as part of the settlement of a lawsuit brought by the original majority shareholders, Decatur, Illinois-based Vaughan Media (owned by media executive Thomas J. Vaughan) acquired a 95.5% majority stake in 54 Broadcasting, Inc. from Oliveira, LS Communications and Goldberg-Hirsch Ventures for $6 million. LIN TV continued to hold a 4.5% stake in the station thereafter, which was forwarded to the eventual acquirers of LIN's former assets. On October 21 of that year, Llano-based sister station KBVO—which had been serving as a semi-satellite of KXAN (as KLNO and later, KXAM-TV) since it signed on in September 1991—adopted a separate entertainment schedule, assuming the MyNetworkTV affiliation rights for the Austin market from KNVA. This left Channel 54 exclusively affiliated with The CW, with syndicated programs—including some first-run and off-network series whose rights had been held by KNVA—being moved to KBVO to fill that station's new general-entertainment-based schedule; other syndicated shows were moved to new timeslots or added to KNVA's schedule to fill the former MyNetworkTV-occupied time slot on Monday through Friday evenings.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, Richmond, Virginia-based Media General announced that it would purchase the LIN Media stations, including KXAN-TV, KBVO (which it retained through the renewal of a satellite relay waiver that predated the termination of its KXAN simulcast to comply with FCC rules that prohibited legal duopolies in markets with fewer than eight independent full-power television station owners), and the LMA with and 4.5-percent stake in KNVA, in a $1.6 billion merger. The FCC approved the merger on December 12, 2014, with the deal being consummated on December 19.\n\nOn January 27, 2016, Irving-based Nexstar Broadcasting Group – which had a previous $14.50-per-share offer for the group be rejected two months earlier – announced that it would acquire Media General for an evaluation of $4.6 billion in cash and stock plus the assumption of $2.3 billion in Media General-held debt, in exchange for giving right of first refusal to the Meredith Corporation to acquire any divested broadcast or digital properties (a clause that Meredith did not exercise) as compensation for terminating a prior $2.4-billion acquisition agreement it reached with Media General the previous September to accept Nexstar's counterbid. The transaction was approved by the FCC on January 11, 2017; the sale was completed six days later on January 17, at which point the existing Nexstar stations and the former Media General outlets that were not subject to divestiture to address ownership conflicts in certain overlapping markets became part of the renamed Nexstar Media Group. The deal marked Nexstar's re-entry into the Austin market, as the group had previously operated CBS affiliate KEYE-TV (channel 42) under a local marketing agreement with Four Points Media Group from 2009 to 2011, concluding after Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired the KEYE and the other Four Points stations.\n\nKNVA-DT2 is the Grit-affiliated second digital subchannel of KNVA, broadcasting in standard definition on UHF channel 49.2 (or virtual channel 54.2 via PSIP). On cable, KNVA-DT2 is available on Spectrum channel 1260, Grande channel 268 and Google Fiber channel 79 in the Austin area.\n\nKNVA originally launched a digital subchannel on virtual channel 54.2 on September 27, 2010, originally maintaining a standard-definition test simulcast of the station's primary channel. On October 25, 2010, KNVA-DT2 converted into an affiliate of TheCoolTV, as a result of then-parent LIN Media having signed a deal with Cool Music Network LLC to carry the music video network on the group's stations in eleven of the 17 markets where it operated stations at the time; LIN dropped the network from KNVA and its sister stations elsewhere in the U.S. – and decommissioned the 54.2 subchannel – on February 28, 2013.\n\nOn November 16, 2015, Media General announced that it had reached an agreement with Katz Broadcasting to affiliate 16 stations owned and/or operated by the group — including KNVA — with one or more of three Katz-owned multicast networks, Laff, Escape and Grit. As part of the agreement, on January 29, 2016, KNVA relaunched its DT2 subchannel to serve as an affiliate of Grit.\n\nKNVA-DT3 is the Laff-affiliated third digital subchannel of KNVA, broadcasting in standard definition on UHF channel 49.3 (or virtual channel 54.3 via PSIP). On cable, KNVA-DT3 is available on Spectrum channel 1261, Grande channel 269 and Google Fiber channel 80 in the Austin area. On January 29, 2016, as part of Media General's agreement with Katz, KNVA launched a digital subchannel on virtual channel 54.3 to serve as an affiliate of Laff. (Under the initial agreement, the Laff affiliation rights in the Austin market originally intended to be assigned to a subchannel of KBVO.)\n\nKNVA-DT4 is the Court TV Mystery-affiliated fourth digital subchannel of KNVA, broadcasting in standard definition on UHF channel 49.4 (or virtual channel 54.4 via PSIP). The subchannel is not carried on Spectrum, Grande or Google Fiber as Court TV Mystery already holds local cable carriage rights through its secondary Austin affiliate, Killeen-licensed Univision O&O KAKW-DT (channel 62), which carries the network on its DT4 subchannel. (Katz Broadcasting's affiliation agreements for Court TV Mystery and its sister networks are structured as non-exclusive subchannel leases, resulting in certain Katz networks being carried on more than one station in certain markets such as Austin.)\n\nOn October 13, 2017, as part of a June 2016 agreement between Nexstar Media Group and Katz Broadcasting to affiliate 81 stations (aside from those covered by the Media General agreement that preceded Nexstar's purchase of the group) with one or more of Katz's four multicast networks, KNVA launched a digital subchannel on virtual channel 54.4 to serve as an affiliate of Escape. The subchannel's branding changed to Court TV Mystery on September 29, 2019.\n\nKNVA is rebroadcast on four digital Class A translator stations across Central Texas – all owned by Nexstar Media Group and utilizing callsigns that reference their former alliance under the defunct Hill Country Paramount Network service – located in communities surrounding Austin:\nAlong with the four remaining repeaters, four other stations formerly operated as simulcasts of KXAN from their respective launches until January 1995 and again from October 1998 until 2002: KHPG-CA (channel 31) in Giddings began operating in 1990; that station shut down and its license was surrendered by LIN to the FCC on February 22, 2011; its license was cancelled by FCC authorization on August 22, 2012. KHBF-CA (channel 25) in Fredericksburg, which began operating in 1992, was shut down following its license surrendering on February 22, 2011. KHPB-CD (channel 45) in Bastrop, which began operating as a KXAN repeater in 1991, had its license cancelled by the FCC on July 14, 2017. A third station, KBVO-CA (channel 49, which moved to channel 51 in the fall of 1995), began operating in November 1989 as K49CY; it is the only former KXAN translator outside of those that now simulcast KNVA programming that remains in operation .\n\nBetween 1989 and 1993, LIN TV gradually launched a group of seven low-power translators of KXAN to serve areas that could not receive that station's programming because of signal impairments that occurred with KXAN (as well as other UHF stations in the region) during the analog era due to Central Texas's rugged terrain. On January 9, 1995, KXAN/KNVA management converted the low-power stations into a part-time simulcast feed of KNVA that would also serve as charter affiliates of the United Paramount Network (UPN). The stations collectively became known as the \"Hill Country Paramount Network,\" but were usually referred to on-air as \"HPN\" (an abbreviation chosen for callsign assignment expediency in the event the service's programming were to move to a singular full-power outlet). When UPN launched one week later on January 16, the HPN stations began substituting The WB's prime time schedule with UPN programs in their designated time slots. (The UPN Kids block also began substituting Kids' WB programs shown on KNVA when both networks launched their respective children's program blocks in September 1995.) The UPN programming rights moved from the HPN stations to K13VC (which had been operated by KTBC since that station's 1994 purchase by Argyle Television Holdings) in October 1998, in a move designed to give UPN greater cable coverage, at least in the city of Austin, as well as slightly stronger over-the-air reception than that provided by the translators.\n\nFrom January 14, 2002 until the fall of 2008, the translator network served as a simulcast of KBVO-CA, which operated as an affiliate of fledgling Spanish-language network Telefutura during this period. KBVO-CA disaffiliated from Telefutura in the fall of 2008, after network parent Univision Communications migrated the affiliation to KTFO-CA (channel 31), a co-owned Class-A station that previously operated as a repeater of Univision O&O KAKW-TV; consequently, KBVO-CA and its former repeaters were converted into full-time rebroadcasters of KNVA. On October 21, 2009, as a byproduct of KBVO converting from a KXAN semi-satellite into a separately programmed MyNetworkTV affiliate, KBVO-CA was converted into a translator of full-power KBVO. (In 2014, KBVO-CA flash-cut to a digital-exclusive signal, correspondingly switching its \"-CA\" suffix to a \"-CD\" suffix to reflect its current status as a Class A digital station.)\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKNVA shut down its analog signal on June 12, 2009, as part of the FCC-mandated transition to digital television for full-power stations. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 49, using PSIP to display KNVA's virtual channel as 54 on digital television receivers, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.\n\nAs a part of the broadcast frequency repacking process following the 2016-2017 FCC incentive auction, KNVA relocated its digital signal from UHF channel 49 to UHF 23 on June 21, 2019.\n\nKNVA currently carries the entire CW network schedule (consisting of its Sunday through Friday prime time schedule; its lone daytime program, \"Jerry Springer\", and its customary Saturday morning educational program block, \"One Magnificent Morning\"), offering its programming in pattern. Syndicated programs broadcast by KNVA () include \"Maury\", \"The Steve Wilkos Show\", \"The People's Court\", \"The Goldbergs\", \"Black-ish\", \"Mom\" and \"Family Feud\".\n\nThe station also broadcasts three locally produced entertainment programs that air as part of KNVA's weekend schedule: \"Expedition Texas\" (a travel and tourism program), \"YOLO, Texas\" (a similarly formatted program focusing on unique \"bucket list\" attractions) and \"512 Studios Live\" (a weekly music showcase featuring performances by local bands).\n\n, KXAN-TV presently produces six hours of locally produced newscasts each week for KNVA (consisting of one hour on weekdays and a half-hour each on Saturdays and Sundays); in addition, KXAN also produces \"KXAN Sports: More Than the Score\", a 15-minute sports highlight program (hosted by KXAN sports director Roger Wallace, sports anchor/reporters Chris Tavarez and Andrew Schnitker, and KNVA entertainment reporter Joe Barlow) that airs as part of its weeknight 9:00 p.m. news block. In addition to airing local newscasts produced by KXAN-TV, channel 54 also will take on the responsibility of simulcasting severe weather coverage from its parent station in place of regular programming in the event that a tornado warning is issued for any part of the station's main over-the-air broadcast area.\n\nWhen KNVA converted into an entertainment format on January 9, 1995, the station carried rebroadcasts of KXAN's weekday morning, 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. newscasts on a one hour (for the evening newscasts) to 90-minute delay (for the morning newscasts). Since the conversion, channel 54 has aired regularly scheduled weather updates presented by the KXAN weather staff that air at the top of each hour for most of the broadcast day. (The looping weather programming that had encompassed its entire schedule since its August 1994 launch was concurrently relegated to a daily overnight block from 2:00 to 6:00 a.m.; this block was discontinued in September 1998, when KNVA began offering a simulcast of the Shop at Home Network during that time period.)\n\nOn October 16, 1995, KXAN-TV began producing a half-hour early evening newscast at 5:30 p.m. for KNVA, \"The 5:30 Report\". Originally co-anchored by KNVA principal owner and general manager Ron Oliveira (who, following his departure from a similar role at ABC affiliate KVUE, became lead weeknight co-anchor at KXAN that spring) and Leslie Cook (who joined KXAN that fall, after serving as an anchor/reporter at ABC affiliate KHBS/KHOG in Fort Smith–Fayetteville, Arkansas) alongside field anchor Robert Hadlock (who was reassigned to that position with Oliveira's hiring, before resuming in-studio anchor duties on KXAN's 10:00 p.m. newscast that fall), KXAN chief meteorologist Jim Spencer and sports director Roger Wallace, the weeknight-only program was produced out of a dedicated set within a secondary soundstage at KXAN's Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard studios. It directly competed against KTBC's existing 5:00 p.m. newscast, which had expanded to one hour to become the Austin market's first local newscast to be offered in the 5:30 time slot on July 3, as a byproduct of the affiliation switch from CBS to Fox that occurred the day prior. The program experienced low viewership throughout its two-year run, unable to compete with national network newscasts on KVUE, KXAN and KEYE and syndicated entertainment programs on independent station K13VC in the timeslot; \"The 5:30 Report\" was cancelled and discontinued after the edition of June 8, 1997, to be replaced on June 11 by syndicated reruns of \"Hangin' with Mr. Cooper\". (Oliveira would remain at KXAN until March 1999, when he left to become chief operating officer at upstart Telemundo affiliate KTLM in McAllen.)\n\nLocally produced newscasts returned to channel 54 after an eleven-year absence on September 21, 2009, when KXAN debuted a nightly prime time newscast at 9:00 p.m. for Channel 54, titled \"KXAN News at 9:00 on The CW Austin\". Originally debuting as a half-hour program, it became the competitor to KTBC's in-house 9:00 p.m. newscast, a one-hour program which has been the leader in the time period since it launched in August 2000. The weeknight editions of the newscast would eventually be expanded to 45 minutes on September 21, 2015, although the weekend editions remain a half-hour in length. Filling the remainder of the timeslot on weeknights following the expansion was \"ATX Uncensored(ish)\", a local news satire show hosted by Austin-based comedian Brian Gaar (a half-hour \"best of\" edition aired on Saturdays following the 9:00 p.m. newscast). The program was discontinued on July 1, 2016, citing low viewership; reruns of \"ATX Uncensored(ish)\" continued to air until September 2, 2016, to be replaced three days later (September 5) by \"KXAN Sports: More Than the Score\", a panel analysis program focusing primarily on college and high school sports that features the KXAN sports department staff, \"Austin American-Statesman\" sportswriters and hosts from sports radio station KTXX-FM (104.9).\n\nOn September 3, 2013, KXAN began producing a two-hour extension of its weekday morning newscast for the station, under the title \"KXAN News Today on The CW Austin\", running from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. In addition to airing opposite \"Today\" on KXAN as well as competing national morning news programs on KVUE and KEYE-TV, the program – which utilized the same staff as the parent 4:30 to 7:00 a.m. newscast on KXAN – directly competed against the third and fourth full hours of Fox O&O KTBC's in-house morning newscast, which expanded into the time period upon Channel 7's 1995 switch from CBS to Fox. In addition to news headlines, weather forecasts and traffic reports, the program also featured entertainment news and updates on trending news stories from the KXAN website staff. On September 8, 2014, the KNVA broadcast of \"KXAN News Today\" was expanded to include a simulcast of the newscast's 6:00 a.m. hour that had previously been exclusive to KXAN. Although it had launched an in-house news department two days prior, on July 17, 2017, Fox-affiliated sister station KWKT-TV in Waco began carrying a simulcast of KNVA's morning program (which it branded as \"Fox 44 Capital News\") in lieu of a KWKT-produced local newscast. The \"KXAN News Today\" extension was discontinued after the August 24, 2018, broadcast, after having suffered from insufficient viewership for most of its run, although KNVA continues to simulcast the 6:00 a.m. hour of KXAN's morning newscast; KNVA replaced the newscast with a two-hour repeat block of KXAN's midday lifestyle program, \"Studio 512\". (In the Waco–Temple–Bryan market, KWKT replaced the KNVA simulcast with syndicated educational children's programs and infomercials.)\n\n"}

It was marketed as Thelin by Encysive Pharmaceuticals until Pfizer purchased Encysive in February 2008. In 2010, Pfizer voluntarily removed sitaxentan from the market due to concerns about liver toxicity.\n\nSitaxentan is a small molecule that blocks the action of endothelin (ET) on the endothelin-A (ET) receptor selectively (by a factor of 6000 compared with the ET). It is a sulfonamide class endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) and is undergoing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review for treating pulmonary hypertension. The rationale for benefit compared with bosentan, a nonselective ET blocker, is negligible inhibition of the beneficial effects of ET stimulation, such as nitric oxide production and clearance of ET from circulation. In clinical trials, the efficacy of sitaxentan has been much the same as bosentan, but the hepatotoxicity of sitaxentan outweighs its benefits. Dosing is once daily, as opposed to twice daily for bosentan.\n\nOn December 10, 2010 Pfizer announced it would be withdrawing sitaxentan worldwide (both from marketing and from all clinical study use), citing that it is a cause of fatal liver damage.\n\nSitaxentan was approved for marketing in the European Union in 2006, in Canada in 2006 and in Australia in 2007. By February 2008 it had been launched commercially in Germany, Austria, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Spain and Italy.\n\nIn March 2006, the FDA recommended an approvable status to sitaxentan but said it would not yet approve the product. In July 2006, sitaxentan received a second approvable letter stating that efficacy outcome issues raised in the context of the STRIDE-2 study were still unresolved. In July 2007, Encysive commenced a formal dispute resolution process in a preliminary meeting with the FDA. In September 2007 the company announced that it was making preparations for another phase III clinical trial (intended to be named STRIDE-5) to overcome the FDA's concerns. The takeover by Pfizer resulted in a reconfiguration and extension of these plans, to include combination therapy with sildenafil. The Sitaxentan Efficacy and Safety Trial With a Randomized Prospective Assessment of Adding Sildenafil (SR-PAAS) was an ongoing program of three clinical trials conducted in the United States (ClinicalTtrials.gov identifiers: NCT00795639, NCT00796666 and NCT00796510) with anticipated completion dates between June 2010 and January 2014.\n\nAdverse effects observed with sitaxentan are class effects of endothelin receptor antagonists, and include :\n\nBecause sitaxentan inhibits metabolism of warfarin, a decreased dose of warfarin is needed when co-administered with sitaxentan. This is because warfarin acts to prevent blood from clotting, and if it remains unmetabolized, it can continue to thin the blood.\n\n"}

Founded on December 8, 1744, it is the capital of Copiapó Province and Atacama Region.\n\nCopiapó lies about 800 km north of Santiago by the Copiapó River, in the valley of the same name. In the early 21st century, the river has dried up in response to climate change and more severe droughts. The town is surrounded by the Atacama Desert and receives 12 mm (½ in) of rain per year. The population of Copiapó was 9,128 in 1903; and 11,617 in 1907. As of 2012, there are 158,438 inhabitants.\n\nCopiapó is in a rich silver and copper mining district. A bronze statue commemorates Juan Godoy, discoverer of the Chañarcillo silver mines in the 19th century. The Copiapó-Caldera railway line, built in 1850, was the first one in South America. The first section between Caldera and Monte Amargo was inaugurated on July 4, 1850 in honor of the Independence Day, as American businessman William Wheelwright was responsible for the project. The original wooden railway station is now a National Monument.\n\nSpanish explorers named the settlement \"San Francisco de la Selva de Copiapó\" or Saint Francis of the Jungle of Copiapó, due to its lush vegetation. Prior to Spanish occupation, the area was inhabited by the Diaguita people under the rule of the Inca Empire into the 16th century. Remains of Diaguita fortresses have been found in this area. The earliest archaeological remains of human activity in the Copiapó Valley have been dated at ten thousand years BP (before present). The settlement developed around the remains of an Inca cemetery, known as \n\nUntil Chile annexed Antofagasta and Iquique from Bolivia following the War of the Pacific (1879–1883), Copiapó was the nation's northernmost city and main mining city.\n\nAn earthquake on 4 December 1918 caused extensive damage throughout the city.\n\nThrough the 20th century, the city of Copiapó has grown markedly, both from the mining industry and its role as capital of its department.\n\nOn 5 August 2010, the San José Copper Mine collapsed, trapping 33 miners underground. The mine was about north of the city. The miners were deep and from the mine's entrance via spiraling underground ramps. Private, local, national and international resources cooperated in their rescue. The miners survived underground for 69 days until all were brought to the surface on 13 October 2010, a record period of time. This mine has been closed, but the industry of copper and gold mining is very important in the region.\n\nAccording to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Copiapó had 129,091 inhabitants (64,922 men and 64,169 women). Of these, 125,983 (97.6%) lived in urban areas and 3,108 (2.4%) in rural areas. The population grew by 27.9% (28,184 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.\n\nAccording to the same census, the religious affiliation in Copiapó, is the following:\n\nCopiapó has a desert climate (Köppen: \"BWh\") with mild temperatures year round. Winters are mild with Cool temperatures during the day, with a July maximum of and Cool to Cold temperatures during the night, averaging . The cold Humboldt Current offshore leads to cool summer temperatures for being inland on its low latitude, and contributes to the very low annual rainfall. Temperatures rarely fall below freezing. Most of the precipitation falls during this time of the year with June and July being the wettest months. While winters are normally dry, precipitation is highly variable. This was the case when June 1998 recorded of precipitation but generally, in most years, precipitation is rare. Summers are warm with a January average of and precipitation is virtually non-existent. Temperatures can occasionally exceed any time of the year. The average annual precipitation is , though this is highly variable, with some years recording no precipitation, as occurred in 1970, 1978, 1990, 1992-1993, and in 1998.. There are 3.2 days with measurable precipitation. The record high was in August 1972 and the record low was in June 1975.\n\nCopiapó has a diversified and potential economy, but mining is the largest economic activity. The Copiapó Basin has a great deal of copper ore, mined by companies such as Minera Candelaria, which extracts copper near Tierra Amarilla, a neighboring commune. This generates a need for transportation, light industry, and services. \"Small mining\" represents over 30% of the production. The copper obtained by \"pirquineros\" (miners) goes to the copper smelter at Paipote.\n\nAgriculture is the second-largest source of income in this area. It consists largely of grape production, with olives, tomatoes, avocados and some citrus fruits also produced as commodity crops. \n\nIndustry: Copiapó has mainly light industry, and some medium industry such as the INACESA plant and Paipote copper refinery.\n\nEnergy: Many important solar plants were built in the Atacama Region, benefiting from the high amount of and constant solar radiation during the year. Solar photovoltaic energy production in 2016 reached more than 400 MW connected to the Central-North grid.\n\nCommerce is growing in Copiapó, largely old and new, small and medium enterprises. Downtown Copiapó activity reflects the growth of the city. Some local enterprises have grown rapidly in the last decade, such as the Albasini and Don Álvaro chain-stores. The national government's free-market policies, along with a higher demand and better economic expectations, have encouraged the establishment here of such national businesses as the supermarkets Deca (1999), Jumbo (2005), and Lider (2006).\n\nTourism in Copiapó has been developing since the early 21st century. Some come to see the desert and indigenous monuments, such as the Inca cemetery in the city, which was investigated in the 1930s. In addition, a new casino has attracted both domestic and foreign tourists, and hotels have invested in new amenities and structures to satisfy demand. \n\n\n As a commune, Copiapó is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2012-2016 alcalde is Maglio Cicardini (Independent). The council has the following members:\n\nSince the return to democracy in 1990, there have been six mayoral elections held in Copiapó.\nIn 1992, Mónica Calcutta (PPD) won the election against 24 candidates. Her term was characterized by public expenditures on green areas, parks, and street paving, and public infrastructure such as the new building of the City Hall (1994), the Estadio Techado (1996), and the Technological School (inaugurated in 1997). During her term, Calcutta encouraged people to participate. One of these activities was the \"Train of History\" carried out in 1994 (for the 250th anniversary of Copiapó) and 1995.\n\nDespite all these expenditures, the City Hall ended up with no debt for 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Calcutta ran for the re-election, but was defeated by the socialist candidate Marcos López (city councilor 1992–1996) by a narrow margin of 146 votes. López's term differed substantially from Calcutta's; his first three years as mayor did not see any important public expenditures in visible things. They came out the year before the following election.\n\nThe 2000 election was a very confrontational one. López and Calcutta ran for election together with 10 other candidates. In spite of surveys that showed a virtual tie between them, López won the election with an overwhelming 50.07% of the votes to his rival's 31.52%.\n\nLópez's second term in office was characterized by high public expenditures, part of it from the Central Government to improve Chilean infrastructure toward the bicentennial of Independence. These expenditures went towards redesigning the Central Square, Matta Avenue and the City Chamber.\n\nIn 2004, Marcos López was elected to another term, defeating the rightist candidate René Aedo (RN) with 50.01% to 40.82% of the votes.\n\nIn 2008, López run for a fourth term, but was defeated by the independent candidate Maglio Cicardini Neyra, by a margin of less than 1% of the votes.\n\nIn 2012, López run once again, but lost against Cicardini, who won the election with more than 50% of the votes.\n\nIn 2016, Cicardini lost against Marcos López.\n\nWithin the electoral divisions of Chile, Copiapó is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Lautaro Carmona (PC) and Daniella Cicardini Milla (Independent, backed up by the PS) as part of the 5th electoral district, (together with Chañaral and Diego de Almagro). The commune is represented in the Senate by Isabel Allende Bussi (PS) and Baldo Prokurica Prokurica (RN) as part of the 3rd senatorial constituency (Atacama Region).\n\nCopiapó provides public and private education, from kindergarten to high school, and also technical and bachelor's degrees.\n\nAccording to the Departament of Education of Chile, Copiapó had (2007) an enrollment of more than 35.000 students, divided in the following programs: Kindergarten, 3.780 students; Differencial Education, 1.009 students; Elementary and Middle School, 20.794 students; High School, 10.291 students (5.185 in Scientific-Humanist programs and 5.106 in Technical-Professional programs).\n\nLa commune of Copiapó offers public and private education held by 64 schools, divided in: 61 urbans and 3 rurals; 32 public, 23 State-subsidized private schools and 9 private schools.\n\n\n\n\nThis city has a football team called Club de Deportes Copiapó, which was born after the dissolution of Regional Atacama, in 1999. It plays in the Primera B League of football of Chile, and plays as local in the Luis Valenzuela Hermosilla Stadium and in the Municipal Stadium of Tierra Amarilla.\n\nThis is the event that gathers the most 4x4 automobiles in the world, and it began in 1992.\n\nThe effort and spirit of Raid Atacama has made it worthy of the National Award for Tourism. For over 21 years, the Atacama Raid has been the cornerstone of the development of off-road activities along Chile, and its example has been followed by many clubs and even several companies.\n\nIn the last seven years, the enrollment has kept steady on an average of about 500 vehicles per event, and more than 1,800 participants from all regions of the country and abroad.\n\nIn 1997, it reached the largest number of participants to date, bringing together 613 4x4 vehicles. With no other event as large, this made it possible to apply for registration as a world record. Another of the achievements is to hold, without competition, the record for international off-road event (amateur) with greater permanence in time.\n\nIn the last years, Copiapó has been not only one of the Chilean communes the Rally Dakar Chile-Argentina has passed through, but also the place of birth of Jaime Prohens, one of the most importants runners of this rally.\n\n\n"}

Growing to tall and wide, it is a vigorous, bushy, evergreen tree with fragrant flowers.\n\nThe Chilean myrtle grows slowly, forming a small tree of around 10 to 15 m, rarely 20 m. Its trunk appears twisted and contorted and has smooth bark, coloured grey to bright orange-brown, which peels as the tree grows - giving a two-tone appearance of rich cinnamon colour, contrasted with cream. It is evergreen, with small, fragrant, oval leaves 2.0 to 2.5 cm long and 1.5 broad, and profuse white flowers in early to midsummer. Its fruit is an edible black or blue berry 1.0 cm in diameter, ripe in early autumn.\n\nSynonyms include \"Eugenia apiculata\" DC., \"Myrceugenia apiculata\" (DC.) Niedenzu, and \"Myrceugenella apiculata\" (DC.) Kausel. Common names include \"arrayán\" (from a Spanish name for the related European myrtle), \"kelümamüll\" (orange-wood) (the Mapuche Native American name), shortleaf stopper, \"palo colorado\" and \"temu\".\n\n\"Luma\" is a derivation of a vernacular Chilean name for this species, while \"apiculata\" means 'with a small, broadly pointed tip'.\n\nThe Chilean myrtle grows along water currents in the Valdivian temperate rain forests in Chile, while in Argentina it grows from Neuquén south to the Chubut River. The main forests are on the Quetrihué Peninsula (Mapuche for 'myrtles') and on Isla Victoria on the Nahuel Huapi Lake, within the Los Arrayanes National Park and Nahuel Huapí National Park, respectively, in Argentina. It can be also found in lesser numbers along the Arrayanes River in Los Alerces National Park. Trees in these protected areas are up to 650 years old. The notable Argentinian myrtle forest of the Los Arrayanes National Park covers 20 ha of the Quetrihué Peninsula, where the cinnamon-coloured myrtles leave almost no space for other trees.\n\nIts fruit is appreciated in Chile and Argentina and its flowers are important for honey production. The Chilean myrtle has medicinal uses for the Mapuche people. It is also kept as bonsai and cultivated in gardens for the contrast of the glossy foliage and slender red stems. It has become naturalised in parts of Ireland and western Great Britain and it has been planted in Spain. Also suspected to be naturalising in New Zealand. \n\nThis plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n"}

He is Zambia's eighth-most capped player and third on the list of all-time top goalscorers behind Godfrey Chitalu and Alex Chola. Kalusha was named African Footballer of the Year in 1988 by the magazine \"France Football\" and was nominated for the 1996 FIFA World Player of the Year where he was voted the 12th-best player in the world, the first to be nominated after playing the entire year for a non-European club.\n\nHis older brother Benjamin Bwalya played professional football, and his younger brother Joel Bwalya also played for Zambia. His cousin is former Cardiff City and Welsh national football team international Robert Earnshaw. \n\nHis career as a player, coach and president of the Football Association of Zambia is partly shown in the documentary film \"Eighteam\".\n\nOn 20 March 2016, Kalusha lost the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) elections to a renowned businessman-turned football official Andrew Kamanga by 163 to 156 votes in what many thought was an impossible task for the challenger.\n\nIn August, 2018, the world soccer governing body FIFA banned Bwalya for two years from all football-related activities at both national and international level. The FIFA adjudicatory chamber of the independent Ethics Committee found him guilty of having violated article 16 (Confidentiality) and article 20 (Offering and accepting gifts and other benefits) of the FIFA Code of Ethics. It is alleged that Bwalya received a bribe in the form of a gift from Mohammed Bin Hammam, a Qatari official.\n\nBwalya was a member of the national squad that participated at the 1988 Olympic Games, making his mark with a most famous hat-trick in a 4–0 victory against Italy. At the full international level, he appeared in 87 international matches and scored 39 goals from 1983 to 2004. He debuted against Sudan in April 1983 at Dag Hammarskjoeld Stadium in a Cup of Nations qualifier in Ndola, and scored his first goal against Uganda in a World Cup qualifier the following year at the same venue. He has appeared in multiple tournaments, including six editions of the African Cup of Nations.\n\nAlthough he was captain of the national football team during the qualification matches for the 1994 World Cup, Kalusha was not on the ill-fated flight on 27 April 1993 when the entire team and its management were killed when the plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Gabon. As he was playing for PSV Eindhoven, his schedule had him flying from the Netherlands to Senegal to join the team instead of being on the team plane. Kalusha Bwalya, Africa's most famous \"Number 11\", took on the mantle of spearheading the revival of the national side the following year, captaining the side to the Runners-Up spot at the CAF African Nations Cup 1994 in Tunisia—where they succumbed to the Super Eagles of Nigeria; this was to be the peak of his own career and Zambian football for a long time to come. The national team finished in 3rd place at the next edition of the Africa Cup in South Africa in 1996, with Kalusha winning the Golden Boot Award as the top scorer at the tournament.\n\nHe was a player-coach during the African 2006 World Cup qualification matches. On 5 September 2004, Zambia played Liberia, and the match was tied 0–0 minutes before the end. Kalusha, aged 41, came off the bench during the second half, scoring from a trademark direct free kick to give Zambia a 1–0 victory and the lead of Africa's Group 1. However, Zambia finished third and failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup.\n\nDespite the failure to qualify, Bwalya coached Zambia at the 2006 African Cup of Nations. Following their elimination in the first round, however, Bwalya resigned from his post.\nKalusha's dream of holding the coveted AFCON trophy came 2012 when the Zambia National Football Team, which was underestimated by many football pundits upset the star-studded Ivory Coast to win the final of the 2012 tournament. As Zambian FA President, he joined the players and lifted the cup in a country where his former teammates perished in an aircraft disaster. This emotional story is narrated in the documentary film \"Eighteam\", directed by Juan Rodriguez-Briso.\n\nHe has nevertheless remained actively involved in international football, contributing to the 2006 World Cup as a member of FIFA's Technical Study Group. He was also one of the ambassadors of the 2010 World Cup which was held in South Africa.\n\nBwalya's career in Europe began at Cercle Brugge in Belgium. In his first season, he was the club's top scorer and was twice voted supporters' player of the year. Such was his impact that Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven took him to the Eredivisie, and he describes winning the championship twice in 1990/91 and 1991/92, under Bobby Robson, as a career highlight.\n\nHe jokingly adds that: \"Most of the time we played in the opponents half, because the team was so good. You know, we had Romario, Gerald Vanenburg, Eric Gerets, Wim Kieft and Hans van Breukelen and just to be with that group, to train with them day in, day out, was an experience.\"\n\nBwalya's next stop was Club America, to whom he moved in 1994. The Mexican club's home ground is the legendary Azteca, an arena of which the Zambian icon has very fond memories. As he told FIFA.com: \"I am privileged to have played in the best stadium in the world – and to have been able to call it my home ground.\" The Mexico experience in general was cherished by Bwalya, who devoted almost eight years of his career to the country and recalls his time there as \"probably the best of my life\".\n\nOn the international front, his earliest achievement was arguably one of the most remarkable hat-tricks in modern football history, with three-times World Cup champions Italy on the receiving end in a 4–0 win for the Zambians at the 1988 Olympics. Bwalya acknowledges that the result was a surprise, but adds: \"Zambia is a sleeping giant in a way. It is a small country in terms of football, but we were the first African team to beat a European power as convincingly as that.\"\n\nBwalya currently serves as a standing committee member at FIFA and the Confederation of African Football and as of 2008 was the president of the Football Association of Zambia from 2008 to 2016. He lost the FA presidency to Andrew Kamanga when he attempted a third term bid in office during the 2016 FAZ AGM. Previously he was vice president.\n\nIn the first half of 2006, Bwalya resigned from his position as the Zambia coach but having served as vice president of the Football Association of Zambia until 2008, he was voted in to be president as of 2008. This was as a result of pressure from members of the Football Association of Zambia as well as the media. On 23 February 2008, he was elected into the CAF Executive Committee.\n\n"}

The album was recorded and released by River North Records.\n\nFollowing his departure from Warner Brothers in 1993, Cetera met Steve Devick while on vacation in Maui with his daughter. Devick had created the Chicago-based label in 1985 and was looking to expand from its Gospel roots into popular music. Cetera, who was looking for a new label at the time, signed a multi-album deal in October 1993.\n\nTeaming up again with Andy Hill, who had produced his previous album, \"World Falling Down\", Cetera took a more active role songwriting, this time, writing six new songs for the album. At Devick's request, Cetera re-recorded his old Chicago song, \"Happy Man\". The song \"(I Wanna Take) Forever Tonight\" had been given to Cetera by its composer Eric Carmen who had himself recorded it some five years previously for an abandoned album: \"Peter...toned down the lyric, made it a little less sexual. I understand why he did it, but I wasn't too [happy] about it.\" Cetera cut Carmen's song as a duet with Crystal Bernard who - besides being a sitcom actress (\"Wings\") - was also a part-time songwriter who had sent Cetera a demo of her compositions: Cetera declined to record any of Bernard's songs but on the basis of her vocals on the demo invited her to partner him on \"(I Wanna Take) Forever Tonight\". Country singer and label mate, Ronna Reeves was recruited for a remake of the ABBA classic, \"SOS\". Hill and Cetera produced six of the album's eleven songs together, while Cetera produced the remaining five on his own.\n\n\"One Clear Voice\" was released 25 July 1995, distributed by Mercury Records.\n\n\"One Clear Voice\" failed to enter the charts, a fact that some attributed to the small relative size of River North Records. Three singles were released to modest success on the \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary chart (AC): \"(I Wanna Take) Forever Tonight\" (No. 22 AC, No. 86 \"Billboard\" Hot 100), \"Faithfully\" (No. 13 AC), and \"One Clear Voice\" (No. 12 AC) with \"SOS\" serving as a fourth single which failed to chart. In promoting the album, Cetera did several live chats on internet forums as well as television interviews and performances.\n\nUnlike his previous albums, Cetera also planned a live tour for \"One Clear Voice\". With five albums of solo material recorded, Cetera felt that he had a broad mix of material to draw from so that he wouldn't be limited to his old songs with Chicago. The tour was delayed when Cetera was in a motorcycle accident over a long weekend in July 1995. A short tour played several dates in the fall of 1995, with a second leg in the summer of 1996 including a few more American and international dates. The One Clear Voice tour marked Cetera's first live concerts since the conclusion of the Chicago 17 tour more than 10 years earlier. It would also be his last live concerts for another seven years. The tour included material from his solo albums as well as several Chicago hits including \"25 or 6 to 4\", \"If You Leave Me Now\", \"Hard To Say I'm Sorry\", \"You're The Inspiration\" and \"Feeling Stronger Every Day\". Towards the end of the concerts, Cetera himself would play the bass on three songs. \n\nDespite a commercial reception that was chilly by mainstream standards, \"One Clear Voice\" was one of Platinum Entertainment's top selling albums, selling approximately 250,000 copies. \n\nIn 2005, the Compendia label re-issued the whole package under a new design, title and sequencing, retitled Faithfully.\n\n\n\n"}

Vermont had an estimated 140,000 people under age 18 (90,000 under 300% above the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Dr. Dynasaur covered 56,000 of these uninsured. After adding the coverage of this program to those already covered by private health insurance, Vermont had achieved a virtually universal health insurance for children. As a result, the state was regarded as having the best healthcare program in the United States.\n\nAt the time of its creation, Dr. Dynasaur used state funds program to provide healthcare for pregnant women and children ages six and under who did not have health insurance and who did not qualify for the federally funded Medicaid. The program covered pregnant women up to 200% above the Federal Poverty Level and children up to 225% above the Federal Poverty Level. Co-payments were required for some medical services. In 1992, Dr. Dynasaur coverage was expanded to children and teens through age 17. To conform to Medicaid, coverage under other health insurance no longer precluded eligibility and co-payments were eliminated. \n\nIn October 1998, coverage was further expanded to children in families with incomes up to 300% above the FPL through the 1902(r)(2) provision and Vermont's section 1115(a) demonstration waiver and through the State Children's Health Insurance Program authorized by Title XXI of the Act. As of January 1, 2002, this translates to income for a family of three of $30,144 for coverage for a pregnant woman and $45,216 for coverage for children. There is no asset limit for Dr. Dynasaur eligibility.\n\nThe primary goal is to assure access for pregnant woman and children to a full range of health care services with a strong emphasis on prenatal and preventive care, and to provide a system of coverage in concert with private health insurance that ensures universal health insurance coverage for all Vermont children. This access to care is essential to successfully achieve a number of key outcome indicators of Healthy Vermonters 2020, a major initiave of the Vermont Agency of Human Services. A secondary goal is to assist working families to maintain their self-sufficiency. This complements the Vermont's welfare reform initiative by offering health coverage to low and middle-income families who do not receive welfare cash assistance.\n\nCoverage under Dr. Dynasaur is comprehensive prenatal care, routine check-ups, immunizations, hospital care (both inpatient and outpatient), prescriptions, x-ray and lab tests, limited dental and vision services and other medical services. Most Dr. Dynasaur beneficiaries receive services through an HMO or PPO. No co-payments apply for any of these services.\n\nA monthly program fee of $30 per family is required for coverage for people under age 18 and pregnant women whose family income exceeds 185% of FPL but is less than or equal to 225%. A $50 per month per family program fee is required for children with income in excess of 225% of FPL and no other insurance coverage. If there is other coverage, Dr. Dynasaur is a secondary payer.\n\nThe name was selected in order to appeal to children as well as parents. With a genial name, it was felt, people would feel \"comfortable to enroll their children in the public health care system\".\n\n"}

It was independent of pressure groups, political parties and, in principle, of government.\n\nThe IPCC could elect to manage or supervise the police investigation into a particular complaint and independently investigate the most serious cases itself. While some of the IPCC's investigators were former police officers, the commissioners themselves could not have worked for the police by law. It had set standards for police forces to improve the way the public's complaints were handled. The IPCC also handled appeals by the public about the way their complaint was dealt with by the local force, or its outcomes. The IPCC was given the task of increasing public confidence in the complaint system.\n\nFrom April 2006 the IPCC took on responsibility for similar, serious complaints against HM Revenue and Customs and the Serious Organised Crime Agency in England and Wales. In April 2008, it additionally took on responsibility for serious complaints against UK Border Agency staff.\n\nThe statutory powers and responsibilities of the commission were set out by the Police Reform Act 2002, and it came into existence on 1 April 2004, replacing the Police Complaints Authority. It was a Non-Departmental Public Body (NDPB), funded by the Home Office, but by law entirely independent of the police, interest groups and political parties and whose decisions on cases are free from government involvement.\n\nBetween 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2009 the IPCC used its powers to begin 353 independent and 759 managed investigations into the most serious complaints against the police. These included deaths in police custody, shootings and fatal traffic incidents.\n\nIn the 2016/2017 period the IPCC received 3,846 appeals whilst managing to finalise 4,026 appeal cases in the same period. \n\nThe vast majority of complaints are dealt with by the Professional Standards department of the police force the complaint is about. The IPCC's independent investigators investigated the most serious complaints, for example where someone died following contact with the police.\n\nThere were a number of types of incidents that the police, or other agencies the IPCC oversees complaints for, must mandatorily refer to the commission. These included deaths in police custody, shootings and fatal traffic incidents as well as allegations that an officer or member of police staff committed a serious criminal offence.\n\nForces could also refer matters voluntarily to the IPCC and the commission could 'call in' any matter where there might have been serious public concern.\n\nOnce a matter was referred, the IPCC would make a 'mode of investigation' decision to determine how it should be dealt with. This wais done by caseworkers or investigators who submitted an assessment to a Commissioner. The assessment involved judging the available information and could mean IPCC investigators are sent to the scene.\n\nThe four modes of investigation were:\n\n\nShould new information emerge after a mode of investigation has been decided the IPCC could change the classification both up and down the scale.\n\nIPCC Investigators were not police officers. However, IPCC investigators designated to undertake an investigation had all the powers and privileges of a police constable in relation to that investigation throughout England and Wales (Police Reform Act, 2002– Schedule 3, Paragraph 19). However, despite being established in April 2004, the first known use of these arrest powers was in 2007 when a former police officer was arrested in relation to allegations of sexual assault.\n\nThe IPCC was overseen by a chair, two deputy chairs, seven operational and three non-operational commissioners. The chair is a Crown appointment and commissioners were public appointments. The IPCC's commissioners and staff were based in IPCC regional offices in Cardiff, London, Sale and Wakefield.\n\nThe IPCC's first chair was Nick Hardwick, appointed in December 2002 and taking office in February 2003; the IPCC existed in shadow form from 1 April 2003, and replaced the Police Complaints Authority on 1 April 2004.\n\nThe IPCC's last chief executive was Lesley Longstone, who was responsible for running the organisation which supports the work of the commission. Kelly was also the IPCC's accounting officer and was accountable to the Home Office Principal Accounting Officer and to Parliament. Susan Atkins was appointed to be the first chief executive of the IPCC in 2003.\n\nAs well as employing its own independent investigators to investigate the most serious cases, the IPCC had staff performing a number of other functions.\n\nCaseworkers handled the majority of complaints that were referred to the organisation. They recorded the details of the complaint and made an assessment of the case and recommend a method of investigation, which would then be passed to a Commissioner for sign off. They also assessed appeals from the public concerning the outcome of police decisions regarding complaints.\n\nThe IPCC also took a lead role in developing new policy for the complaints system and for police practices. For example, following research about the circumstances into deaths following police activity on roads a new policy was drafted. This was adopted by ACPO and the government is making it law for police to follow.\n\nThe IPCC's seven operational commissioners and three non-operational commissioners were appointed by the Home Secretary for a five or three-year period. The chair was appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Home Secretary. Commissioners by law could not have served with the police at any time, been the chair or a member of SOCA at any time or been a commissioner or officer of Customs at any time. They were the public, independent face of the IPCC.\n\nThe commission was the governing board of the IPCC, holding collective responsibility for governance of the commission including oversight of the Executive. As public office holders, commissioners oversaw IPCC investigations and the promotion of public confidence in the complaints system (known as Guardianship). Each commissioner also had responsibility for a particular portfolio such as firearms, deaths in custody, road policing and youth engagement.\n\nCommissioners in making decisions on individual cases acted under the delegated authority of the commission. All appointments, which were full-time and non-executive were for a five-year term, and were through open competition. The commission met bi-monthly and dates were published on the IPCC website.\n\nThe IPCC self-regulation scheme covered England and Wales; oversight of the police complaints system in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. In Scotland the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) reviews the way the police handle complaints from the public and also conducts independent investigation into the most serious incidents involving the police.\n\nIn February 2008 over a hundred lawyers who specialise in handling police complaints resigned from its advisory body, citing various criticisms of the IPCC including a pattern of favouritism towards the police, indifference and rudeness towards complainants, and complaints being rejected in spite of apparently powerful evidence in their support.\n\nThe IPCC responded to these criticisms with a letter to \"The Guardian\" in which the then IPCC Chair, Nick Hardwick, acknowledged some cases could have been handled differently in its infancy, but pointed out that despite repeated requests for the group to provide contemporary examples where expectations had not been met, there had been no further cases identified.\n\nIt has been noted that \"no policeman has ever been convicted of murder or manslaughter for a death following police contact, though there have been more than 400 such deaths in the past ten years alone.\". Although a number of these were determined (by inquest juries) to be suicides, other cases such as that of Ian Tomlinson, were found by inquest juries to be unlawful killings. However, the jury in criminal proceedings acquitted the police officer accused of manslaughter in the Tomlinson case .\n\nThere have been a number of police officers convicted of causing death by dangerous driving, including those responsible for the deaths of Hayley Adamson and Sandra Simpson.\n\nOn 27 June 2012 the Home Affairs Committee announced an inquiry into the IPCC including, but not limited to, analysis of the independence of the commission, the powers and responsibilities of the commission and the effectiveness of Commission investigations. The Committee began hearing evidence on 17 July 2012. The report was published on 29 January 2013 and was scathing, describing it as \"woefully underequipped and hamstrung in achieving its original objectives. It has neither the powers nor the resources that it needs to get to the truth when the integrity of the police is in doubt.\"\n\n\n"}

While labeled as a 'collection', the album is not really a compilation of 'Greatest Hits' but rather a collection of previously recorded duets, a few new songs and a few re-recordings of old Chicago hits.\n\nFollowing the release of \"One Clear Voice\" in 1995, Peter Cetera and his label began the task of creating a \"greatest hits\" type package to release. This proved to be challenging as many of Cetera's charting singles were from the four albums he had released under former label, Warner Brothers. Compounding the problem further, he had charting duet singles on albums by Agnetha Fältskog and Cher, which were the property of their record labels. In addition, many of his hits from his career as a member of the band Chicago were the property of either Warner Brothers or his old band mates. When River North approached Chicago and their self-run record label, Chicago Records, about licensing the master recordings, the band refused outright. In 1997 and 1998, Chicago Records used the songs on two \"The Heart of Chicago\" greatest hits packages put out in a partnership between Chicago Records and Warner Brothers.\n\nWhile the label sorted out the licensing his duet hits with Warner, Geffen and WEA, Cetera stepped into the studio to record five songs for the compilation. The first two were original songs, \"Do You Love Me That Much?\" and \"She Doesn't Need Me Anymore\". The latter was a song about Cetera's daughter Claire, who turned 14 shortly after the album was released. The other three were new recordings of Cetera's Chicago hits, \"If You Leave Me Now\", \"Baby, What a Big Surprise\" and \"You're the Inspiration\". The song keys were lowered a whole step down to suit Cetera's loss of range. \"You're the Inspiration\" sounded country flavored while \"Baby, What a Big Surprise\" had a harder edge electric guitar than the original due to the lower keys. and was missing the final verse.\n\nIn the end, the album featured all of Cetera's hit duets, along with two new songs and three re-recorded songs.\n\nUnlike \"One Clear Voice\", \"You're the Inspiration: A Collection\" made the \"Billboard\" Top 200 album charts, peaking at #134, higher than his last two studio albums and higher than his first solo album from 1981. The first single, \"Do You Love Me That Much?\" made the \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary Chart, hitting #6. This was followed by \"She Doesn't Need Me Anymore\", which hit #27 AC.\n\nFor the third single, the label remixed the new version of \"You're the Inspiration\" with backing vocals from Az Yet. The group had scored a hit single remaking Cetera's \"Hard To Say I'm Sorry\" a year earlier, featuring Cetera's vocals at the end. An ocean side video was filmed featuring Cetera, the band and Cetera's newborn daughter Senna in some scenes. The single peaked at #77 on the \"Billboard\" top 100 and #29 on the Billboard top adult contemporary chart.\n\nCetera did not go on tour in support of the album. When he finally returned to live concerts in 2002, he performed the original Chicago arrangements of the songs.\n\nThe album sold approximately 250,000 copies as of 1999 - a commercial disappointment by some standards, but was one of the top selling albums released on the small record label.\n\n\nThe German Import CD also contains a 12th track:\n\n\nThe Philippine CD version of the album contained a 12th track:\n\n\n\"You're the Inspiration: A Collection\" reached a peak of #134 on the \"Billboard\" Pop Albums chart.\n"}

He acted in over two hundred movies over almost four decades. Ajit is also credited for starring as a lead actor in popular Bollywood movies such as \"Nastik\", \"Bada Bhai\", \"Milan\", \"Bara Dari\", and later as a second lead in \"Mughal-e-Azam\" and \"Naya Daur\".\n\nAjit was born as Hamid Ali Khan into a Deccani Muslim family of Hyderabad state near the historic fort of Golconda outside Hyderabad city. His father, Bashir Ali Khan, who was in the Nizam's army, and his mother, Sultan Jehan Begum, was a devoted wife and mother. Hamid was one of four children; he had a younger brother, Wahid Ali Khan, and two sisters. The language at home was Urdu, but with the Deccani dialect and accent, which was different from that spoken elsewhere and used in the Hindi film industry. In addition to Urdu, Hamid also spoke Telugu, which was the language of that region.\n\nAjit had his early education in Warangal and studied in Govt. Junior College, Hanamkonda in Warangal district of Telangana. Even as a school boy, his handsome features and good build were noticed by his peers, who often told him that he should try and become a film hero, and he began to think of this. He was anyway not much interested in studies, and after finishing school, he sold his junior college textbooks to pay for the journey to Mumbai, the center of the Hindi film industry, and went away without informing his parents.\n\nHe struggled to meet people and be accepted in any project, and in order to feed himself, he worked as an \"extra\" in several films.\n\nFinally, he managed to land a leading role, and in the first couple of films, he is credited in his real name, Hamid Khan. He did not meet with much success, and on the advise of well-wishers, he took the Hindu name \"Ajit\" meaning \"indomitable\" as his screen-name, but his luck did not greatly improve. Although he did several films as hero and became known to the public, and although his distinctive baritone voice and impressive personality brought him a fan following, his luck at the box office as hero was not great. Film director K. Amarnath, who directed him in \"Beqasoor\", suggested that the actor change his long name of Hamid Ali Khan to something shorter, and Hamid zeroed in on \"Ajit\". Ajit's films as hero include \"Nastik\" (1953), \"Bada Bhai\", \"Milan\", \"Baradari\" and \"Dholak,\" and in all of them, he did credible work as actor. In Nastik (1953), the song \"\"Dekh tere sansar ki haalat kya ho gayi Bhagwan\"\" is picturised on him. He moved quite soon to second-lead roles, which he accepted because he had no other source of income. These movies include \"Naya Daur\" and \"Mughal-e-Azam.\"\n\nAjit, who ran away from home to Mumbai after selling his college books, started his career in films in the 1940s. Luck did not favour him in the beginning. He began with the 1946 movie \"Shahe Misra\", acting opposite Geeta Bose, and also did films such as \"Sikander\" (with Van Mala), \"Hatimtai\" (1947), \"Aap Beeti\" (with Khursheed), \"Sone Ki Chidiya\" (with Leela Kumari), \"Dholak\" (with Meena Shori) and \"Chanda Ki Chandni\" (with Monica Desai) as leading hero, but flopped. He did the most films (15) with Nalini Jaywant. Ajit switched over to play the villain. His first movie as a villain was \"Suraj\", followed by films such as \"Zanjeer\" and \"Yaadon Ki Baaraat\".\n\nHis famous dialogues included the \"Mona darling\" bit in \"Yaadon Ki Baraat\", \"Lily don't be silly\" in \"Zanjeer\" and the one about a \"Lion\" in Kallicharan. Ajit's other well known films were \"Naya Daur\", \"Nastik\" and \"Shikari\" to name only a few. In his four decades of film career, Ajit had acted along with the legendary Prithviraj Kapoor, Sohrab Modi, Amitabh Bachchan, I S Johar, Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand, Shammi Kapoor, Dharmendra and many actresses, both young and old.\n\nIn the mid-seventies he had acted in over 57 films, mostly as a villain. His dialogue delivery remains popular even to this date. His colleagues in the film industry — leading personalities who have acted with him, grown up seeing him in Mumbai — expressed deep sorrow over his death.\n\nWriter Javed Akhtar, who scripted \"Zanjeer\", said: \"Like Bachchan, Ajit found a new image as villain after Zanjeer. He started a new innings in his career though he was an established hero in the fifties. His villainy started a new trend. Here was a new villain who was soft-spoken yet forceful. We wanted to give a different image to villainy which matched the hero.\"\n\nAjit almost always portrayed the sophisticated, educated, well groomed evil mastermind, albeit heartless villain. Ajit was presented in striking western attire, the \"bold\" checked suits, matching overcoats, white leather shoes, wide sunglasses, jewellery accessories etc. Given his stature as a senior artist, Ajit was usually the gang leader to second tier villains (such as Jeevan (actor), Prem Chopra, Ranjeet, Kader Khan and Sujit Kumar). He was rarely portrayed (in movie roles) doing any \"dirty work\" himself, rather relaying on his army of henchmen for the task, with zero tolerance for any failures. He always had a savvy female accomplice, usually named \"Mona.\" Acting in over 200 films, he specialized in playing suave villains with memorable catch-phrases delivered in now iconic Ajit-style nasal drawls such as \"Mona, darling\". Ajit also brought to fame the smuggler as the villain. In his movies, he is generally seen smuggling \"gold biscuits\" in or out of the country. It has also been noted that most of his gang members had Christian names like Robert, Michael and Peter. This also has been used for comic purposes in parodies.\n\nIt was the menacing voice he was most famous for. He is still remembered for bringing the most famous villains in the history of Indian cinema to life. His contemporaries include veteran actors like Amrish Puri, Pran, Prem Chopra and Amjad Khan. Some of his popularity in the present time is due to the innumerable jokes and parodies made on his famous lines by comedians.\n\nAjit married three times. His first wife, whom he married after a brief love affair, was an Anglo-Indian and a Christian. The marriage was very short-lived and fell apart due to huge cultural differences and there were no children. Ajit married Shahida, a young lady of his own community and similar social background, in a match arranged by their parents in the usual Indian way. The marriage, which lasted till her death, was harmonious and was blessed with three sons. Ajit then married a third time, this time again for love, and the name of his third wife was Sara/Sarah. The actor Jayant (better known as the father of actor Amjad Khan) took the initiative to facilitate this marriage. Ajit has a further two sons by his third wife.\n\nAjit had a strong friendship with actor Rajendra Kumar. Apart from friendship, Ajit also credited Rajendra Kumar with advising and helping him to become a \"leading villain\" rather than a second-lead hero. Rajendra Kumar was instrumental in getting Ajit his first role as villain in the film \"Suraj\".\n\nAjit died of a sudden heart attack. The film industry was taken aback by the sudden death and lavished many tributes. \n\nFellow \"villain\" Amrish Puri said Ajit's death is a sad loss to films. \"Ajit developed his own style of acting and delivery of dialogue. We still remember his style of acting which is guidance to the new generation of actors.\" Another fellow villain, Prem Chopra, who starred with Ajit in many films including \"Jugnu\", \"Chupa Rustom\" and \"Ram Balram\" as a father and son team, said Ajit was devoted in his work. \"He had a subtle sense of humour. He was a cultured man. We had a common interest - reciting Urdu poetry.\"\n\nNew-generation villain Kiran Kumar was shocked to hear that \"his Ajit uncle\" had died. \"Our relationship was more personal than professional. I must have been hardly eight or ten years when my father (veteran character actor Jeevan) used to take me to Paradise Bakery opposite which was Ajit's residence. Father would call him by his first name Hamid, and would call him down. Ajit would come down, wearing lungi and jaali banian to chat with my father.\"\n"}

{"id": "2322822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322822", "title": "Brown Berets", "text": "Brown Berets\n\nThe Brown Berets (Los Boinas Cafes) are a pro-Chicano organization that emerged during the Chicano Movement in the late 1960s founded by David Sanchez and remains active to the present day. The group was seen as part of the Third Movement for Liberation. The Brown Berets' movements largely revolved around farm worker's struggles, educational reform, and anti-war activism; they have also organized against police brutality. Several groups have been quite active since the passage of California Proposition 187.\n\nIn 1966, as part of the Annual Chicano Student Conference in Los Angeles County, a team of high school students discussed different issues affecting Mexican Americans in their barrios and schools. Among the students at the conference were Vickie Castro, Jorge Licón, David Sanchez, Rachel Ochoa, and Moctesuma Esparza. These high school students formed the Young Citizens for Community Action the same year, and worked together to support Dr. Julian Nava's campaign as a Los Angeles school board member candidate in 1967. Sanchez and Esparza had trained with Father John B. Luce's Social Action Training center at the Church of the Epiphany (Episcopal) in Lincoln Heights and with the Community Service Organization.\n\nThe organization's name was then changed to Young Chicanos For Community Action or \"YCCA\". In 1967, the YCCA founded the Piranya Coffee House. In September 1967, Sal Castro, a Korean War veteran and teacher at Lincoln High School, met with the YCCA at the Piranya Coffee House. The group decided to wear brown berets as a symbol of unity and resistance against discrimination. As a result, the organization gained the name \"Brown Berets\". Their agenda was to fight police harassment, inadequate public schools, inadequate health care, inadequate job opportunities, minority education issues, the lack of political representation, and the Vietnam War. It set up branches in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, New York, Florida, Chicago, St. Louis and other metropolitan areas with large \"raza\" populations.\n\nThe ideology of the Brown Berets was primarily represented by Chicanismo, for example with them having communication with the Black Panther Party in L.A. and having the Black Panther Party promoted, they were mainly aiming for a third world position.\n\nBy September 1968, the Brown Berets became a national organization having opened chapters California, Arizona, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Milwaukee, Chicago, Detroit, Minnesota, Ohio, Oregon, and Indiana.\n\nThe Brown Berets also came to be known for their direct action against police brutality. They protested killings and abuses perpetrated by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department at the station in the barrio. They supported the United Farm Workers movement and the Land Grant Movement in New Mexico. In 1969, they participated in the first Rainbow Coalition (Fred Hampton) which originally included the Young Patriots with William (Preacherman) Fesperman and the Young Lords under the leadership of Jose Cha Cha Jimenez and the Lincoln Park Poor People's Coalition. In 1969, the Young Lords were invited to be part of the first Chicano Youth Liberation Movement organized by Corky Gonzales in Denver, Colorado.\n\nThe Brown Berets organized the first Chicano Moratorium against the Vietnam War in 1970, and a few months later the National Chicano Moratorium in which close to 20,000 Chicanos marched and protested the high casualty rate of Chicanos in Vietnam and the military draft. This peaceful protest became chaotic when the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department decided to end the event by attacking attendees. Three Chicano activists were killed (two of them Brown Berets), including journalist Rubén Salazar.\n\nAlso in 1970, The Brown Berets de Aztlan and other community activist organizations took over a piece of land in Logan Heights (a community of San Diego) because the city of San Diego wanted to build a California Highway Patrol Substation and the community didn't want that. That little piece of land just under the Coronado Bridge, marked by Chicano graffiti-art on the first bridge pillars, is now called Chicano Park.\n\nIn 1972, twenty-six Brown Berets occupied the Santa Catalina Island and claimed it for Chicanos and the Brown Berets. However, by this time, the organization had been weakened by internal conflicts and police and FBI infiltration.\n\nIn November 1972 Sanchez announced the disbanding of the organization, \"chiefly to avoid strife in the Chicano Movement and factional violence\". LA Times 11/2/72 p.OCA1 \n\nIn 1992 David Sanchez and Jeronimo Blanco, in response to escalating Chicano homicides throughout Aztlan, reactivated the organization with different strategies and to focus on Barrio Peace. \n\nAt a February 26, 1995 conference held in Fresno, Ca, brown beret units representing Fresno, Sanger, Madera, Watsonville, Stockton, Hayward, Santa Rosa, Los Angeles, Long Beach, and San Diego, were in attendance. Plans to return to Catalina Island were made at this conference. \nBy 1969, 28 cities had Brown Beret chapters and established mostly in California but units were also established in El Paso, Albuquerque, Denver, Detroit, San Antonio, St. Paul, and Seattle. The Brown Berets were involved in marches, anti-war protests, student-walkouts, and gained significant national media attention when they staged an invasion of the Catalina Islands near Los Angeles in August 1972. Another important direct action was their mobilization of the East Los Angeles blowouts in 1968 where they acted as the security force for the thousands of protesting youth.\n\nThe Brown Berets high visibility and paramilitary stance made them a key target for infiltration, attacks, and harassment by local police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. When the Brown Berets were disbanded by Prime Minister David Sanchez in 1972, a total of 36 chapters had been established primarily near college and university campuses.\n\nNow on many Brown Berets chapters have been formed and reactivated. There is no original Brown Berets formations but only original members. David Sanchez reactivated recently and formed Brown Berets National Party in 2016. Then we have the Brown Beret National Organization led by Edward Cualleros. National Brown Berets led by Juan Guzman. Brown Beret La Hermandad led by Juanito Burns, Carnalismo National Brown Berets led by Victor San Miguel. Los Brown Berets led by Sergio Lujan. Brown Berets de Aztlan led by David Rico, Brown Berets of Cemanahuac led by Connie Gonzalez, and there are also a variety of Autonomous Brown Berets.\n\nThe Brown Berets did not have any restrictions or requirements that were specifically listed to join. It was known but not specifically stated that you had to be a Chicano man or woman, but there was no age restrictions. The Brown Berets was mainly made up of teens and early twenties people.\n\nThere is a misconception about the role of women in the Brown Berets, (similar to the Black Panthers), in which most believe was an entirely male organization. Women in the Brown Berets established important community institutions such as the Barrio Free Clinic, which TELACU later institutionalized. One of the biggest issues that occurred within the Brown Berets was sexism towards the women of the movement.\n\nThis sexism has been known to stem from the concept of Machismo within Latino communities. Machismo is passed down through one's family experience, it is learned in the home that a woman's purpose is a domestic life taking care of children and cleaning. Machismo posits a patriarch heading a family and does not allow for female- headed families or other variations in family structure. Machismo does not allow for varieties of manhood or masculinity among la Raza or allow for the variables of class, education, or sexuality. The men of the movement had a tendency to view the women of the Brown Berets as subservient and unequal. The women of the party felt as if the men did not trust them, and yet they were stuck doing somewhat clerical work and reverted to domestic jobs and tasks. Gloria Arellanes recalls an incident where a top leader physically assaulted one of the women members by slapping her, word traveled fast among the organization. Arellanes also emphasizes how she used her power within the party to create support and solidarity between the women of the movement, and she believes that women leaving the movement contributed to the Brown Berets downfall.\n\nThis was an issue throughout many Chicano Movement organizations, such as La Raza Unida Party. In this case, women ended up doing all of the logistical work and became the backbone of organizing the party while men stuck to other tasks like holding discussions and taking action. The women of La Raza Unida Party wanted to focus on issues such as domestic violence and rape, as well as reproductive uses. These women wanted to support the pro-choice movement because many of them grew up near the border where abortions were common, and they saw this as their contribution to the legalization of abortions. However, the men of the organization did not see these issues as important enough to focus on because they primarily impacted women.\n\nDespite the large extent of sexism, the Chicana movement in the brown berets did empower women in the beginning. It allowed for the anger issued to the U.S government to be expressed in a way that could make a positive change. For example, many Mexican female activists took pride in their political agender and felt it linked each organization together because of their shared common history of the working class and activism.\n\nThe movement brought out people such as Viola Correa, who was a poet/activist during the time. Her bilingual poem titled “La Nueva Chicana” had such a grand impact on the movement. She recites: “¡Hey! / See that lady protesting against injustice, / es mi mama / That girl in the brown beret, / the one teaching the children / she’s my hermana / Over there fasting with the migrants / es mi tía”. The poem allowed for activist to prioritize their cultural revolution and empowered the women of the movement. Although the role of women played a vital role in illustrating the success of the brown beret’s, in the end the demise of the movement can be contribute to the oppression of racism, sexism and classism that was highly prevalent during the 70’s.\n\nThe Brown Berets set up the Benito Juarez Health Clinic (BJHC) in Chicago in 1972. This was a health clinic that provided free medical care to everyone in the Chicago area. Working in conjunction with Cook County Hospital and other major hospitals in the Chicago area, BJHC served the needs of the uninsured and those with no ability to pay for health care services. It was located at 1831 S. Racine, in the Casa Aztlán Center, the community building located on the south side of Chicago, just outside downtown Chicago. The Center Director was Ms. Dorthy Cutler.\n\nThe Brown Berets also fought on public education issues. The organization occupied a middle high school called Frobel Middle 9th Grade School. The Brown Berets, alongside families, community members and students, took over the school for a full day. At the end of the day, the Chicago Police arrived to remove people from the occupied school. That evening, a riot broke out, in which many rioters and one policeman were injured as the police were trying to disperse the crowd. Six police cars were also destroyed. The community wanted a school built in their community, and in 1979 a school was built in the Pilsen community, now called the Benito Juarez High School.\n\nIn El Monte, California, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Brown Berets often supported each other in marches against the Vietnam War and jail conditions at the Bexar County Jail. SNCC ran African American candidates for State offices under the La Raza Unida Party and often supported Mexican American activists.\n\nIn Washington State, the Brown Berets originated in Granger, Washington. The group was then transplanted to Seattle as students from the Yakima Valley were recruited to the University of Washington in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Seattle Chapter worked with the chapter in Yakima, Washington in attempting to organize various projects including the formation of a 'La Raza Unida Party' in Washington. It is believed that the group was initiated first in 1968, with the Seattle chapter emerging in 1969. The organization would attract over 200 members throughout the state.\n\nAlthough having a short-lived presence (approximately from 1968 to 1984), the Brown Berets would be instrumental in organizing youth and college students. Of note was the organization's partaking in the occupation of the old Beacon Hill School in Seattle, which led to the founding of \"El Centro de la Raza\", now one of Seattle's most prominent civil rights organizations. Activism also transcended the organization's early phase, with many former member establishing various community institutions to meet the needs of the local community.\n\nThe San Diego Brown Berets (now known as National Brown Berets de Aztlan) took over a piece of land in Logan Heights that was supposed to be a highway patrol sub-station. That piece of land under the Coronado bridge is now known as Chicano Park.\n\nBrown Berets were infiltrated by government employees and subversives working for outside organizations including but not limited to the FBI, LAPD, CWP, ATF, and other law enforcement agencies and organizations working to co-opt the Chicano movement. In order \"to avoid strife in the Chicano Movement and factional violence\", Prime Minister David Sanchez, announced the disbanding of the organization.(LA Times 11/2/72 p.OCA1)\n\nDuring a session discussing the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act at California State University, Fresno on January 6, 2011, a Brown Beret member spoke out of turn and was taken out of the building by the police officers and detectives. In agreement, others in the audience argued that California lands that had previously belonged to Mexico were acquired by the United States in an unlawful manner.\n\nAugust 26, 2018\n\nThis date marks the march for the 48th Chicano Moratorium held in East Los Angeles. Where Brown Berets made history. Many Brown Berets came together in a call for unity to the cause. \nNational Brown Berets, Brown Berets de Aztlan, Los Brown Berets, Brown Berets of Cemanahuac, Brown Berets National Organization and Autonomous Brown Berets.\n\nSee main article Brown Berets (Watsonville) of a 1994 autonomous group.\n\nSee main article Brown Berets (Austin).\n\n\n"}

Unlike other bridges, they have no spans. Although their origin is unknown, stepping stones, along with log bridges, are likely to have been one of the earliest forms of crossing inland bodies of water devised by humans.\n\nIn traditional Japanese gardens, the term \"\"iso-watari\"\" refers to stepping stone pathways that lead across shallow parts of a pond. Using \"iso-watari for crossing ponds, or shallow parts of streams\", one can view the fish and plants around or in the pond, like carp, turtles, and waterfowls. It works like a bridge, in a slower way of crossing.\n\nToday, stepping stones are commonly used by mountaineers and hikers as a makeshift way of crossing uncharted or unanticipated streams and torrents.\n\nThe Drukken Steps in the Eglinton Woods of North Ayrshire in Scotland were a favourite haunt of poet Robert Burns and his companion Richard Brown, while the two were living in Irvine from 1781 to 1782.\n\nThe name \"Drukken\" steps derives from a person's gait as they stepped from stone to stone whilst crossing the Red Burn.

After preparation, it is often analyzed using optical or electron microscopy. Using only metallographic techniques, a skilled technician can identify alloys and predict material properties.\n\nMechanical preparation is the most common preparation method. Successively finer abrasive particles are used to remove material from the sample surface until the desired surface quality is achieved. Many different machines are available for doing this grinding and polishing, which are able to meet different demands for quality, capacity, and reproducibility.\n\nA systematic preparation method is the easiest way to achieve the true structure. Sample preparation must therefore pursue rules which are suitable for most materials. Different materials with similar properties (hardness and ductility) will respond alike and thus require the same consumables during preparation.\n\nMetallographic specimens are typically \"mounted\" using a hot compression thermosetting resin. In the past, phenolic thermosetting resins have been used, but modern epoxy is becoming more popular because reduced shrinkage during curing results in a better mount with superior edge retention. A typical mounting cycle will compress the specimen and mounting media to and heat to a temperature of . When specimens are very sensitive to temperature, \"cold mounts\" may be made with a two-part epoxy resin. Mounting a specimen provides a safe, standardized, and ergonomic way by which to hold a sample during the grinding and polishing operations.\n\nAfter mounting, the specimen is wet ground to reveal the surface of the metal. The specimen is successively ground with finer and finer abrasive media. Silicon carbide abrasive paper was the first method of grinding and is still used today. Many metallographers, however, prefer to use a diamond grit suspension which is dosed onto a reusable fabric pad throughout the polishing process. Diamond grit in suspension might start at 9 micrometres and finish at one micrometre. Generally, polishing with diamond suspension gives finer results than using silicon carbide papers (SiC papers), especially with revealing porosity, which silicon carbide paper sometimes \"smear\" over. After grinding the specimen, polishing is performed. Typically, a specimen is polished with a slurry of alumina, silica, or diamond on a napless cloth to produce a scratch-free mirror finish, free from smear, drag, or pull-outs and with minimal deformation remaining from the preparation process.\n\nAfter polishing, certain microstructural constituents can be seen with the microscope, e.g., inclusions and nitrides. If the crystal structure is non-cubic (e.g., a metal with a hexagonal-closed packed crystal structure, such as Ti or Zr) the microstructure can be revealed without etching using crossed polarized light (light microscopy). Otherwise, the microstructural constituents of the specimen are revealed by using a suitable chemical or electrolytic etchant.\n\nMany different microscopy techniques are used in metallographic analysis.\n\nPrepared specimens should be examined with the unaided eye after etching to detect any visible areas that have responded to the etchant differently from the norm as a guide to where microscopical examination should be employed. Light optical microscopy (LOM) examination should always be performed prior to any electron metallographic (EM) technique, as these are more time-consuming to perform and the instruments are much more expensive. \n\nFurther, certain features can be best observed with the LOM, e.g., the natural color of a constituent can be seen with the LOM but not with EM systems. Also, image contrast of microstructures at relatively low magnifications, e.g., <500X, is far better with the LOM than with the scanning electron microscope (SEM), while transmission electron microscopes (TEM) generally cannot be utilized at magnifications below about 2000 to 3000X. LOM examination is fast and can cover a large area. Thus, the analysis can determine if the more expensive, more time-consuming examination techniques using the SEM or the TEM are required and where on the specimen the work should be concentrated. \n\nLight microscopes are designed for placement of the specimen's polished surface on the specimen stage either upright or inverted. Each type has advantages and disadvantages. Most LOM work is done at magnifications between 50 and 1000X. However, with a good microscope, it is possible to perform examination at higher magnifications, e.g., 2000X, and even higher, as long as diffraction fringes are not present to distort the image. However, the resolution limit of the LOM will not be better than about 0.2 to 0.3 micrometers. Special methods are used at magnifications below 50X, which can be very helpful when examining the microstructure of cast specimens where greater spatial coverage in the field of view may be required to observe features such as dendrites. \n\nBesides considering the resolution of the optics, one must also maximize visibility by maximizing image contrast. A microscope with excellent resolution may not be able to image a structure, that is there is no visibility, if image contrast is poor. Image contrast depends upon the quality of the optics, coatings on the lenses, and reduction of flare and glare; but, it also requires proper specimen preparation and good etching techniques. So, obtaining good images requires maximum resolution and image contrast.\n\nMost LOM observations are conducted using bright-field (BF) illumination, where the image of any flat feature perpendicular to the incident light path is bright, or appears to be white. But, other illumination methods can be used and, in some cases, may provide superior images with greater detail. Dark-field microscopy (DF), is an alternative method of observation that provides high-contrast images and actually greater resolution than bright-field. In dark-field illumination, the light from features perpendicular to the optical axis is blocked and appears dark while the light from features inclined to the surface, which look dark in BF, appear bright, or \"self-luminous\" in DF. Grain boundaries, for example, are more vivid in DF than BF.\n\nPolarized light (PL) is very useful when studying the structure of metals with non-cubic crystal structures (mainly metals with hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystal structures). If the specimen is prepared with minimal damage to the surface, the structure can be seen vividly in cross-polarized light (the optic axis of the polarizer and analyzer are 90 degrees to each other, i.e., crossed). In some cases, an hcp metal can be chemically etched and then examined more effectively with PL. Tint etched surfaces, where a thin film (such as a sulfide, molybdate, chromate or elemental selenium film) is grown epitaxially on the surface to a depth where interference effects are created when examined with BF producing color images, can be improved with PL. If it is difficult to get a good interference film with good coloration, the colors can be improved by examination in PL using a sensitive tint (ST) filter.\n\nAnother useful imaging mode is differential interference contrast (DIC), which is usually obtained with a system designed by the Polish physicist Georges Nomarski. This system gives the best detail. DIC converts minor height differences on the plane-of-polish, invisible in BF, into visible detail. The detail in some cases can be quite striking and very useful. If an ST filter is used along with a Wollaston prism, color is introduced. The colors are controlled by the adjustment of the Wollaston prism, and have no specific physical meaning, per se. But, visibility may be better. \n\nDIC has largely replaced the older oblique illumination (OI) technique, which was available on reflected light microscopes prior to about 1975. In OI, the vertical illuminator is offset from perpendicular, producing shading effects that reveal height differences. This procedure reduces resolution and yields uneven illumination across the field of view. Nevertheless, OI was useful when people needed to know if a second phase particle was standing above or was recessed below the plane-of-polish, and is still available on a few microscopes. OI can be created on any microscope by placing a piece of paper under one corner of the mount so that the plane-of-polish is no longer perpendicular to the optical axis.\n\nIf a specimen must be observed at higher magnification, it can be examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM), or a transmission electron microscope (TEM). When equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), the chemical composition of the microstructural features can be determined. The ability to detect low-atomic number elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, depends upon the nature of the detector used. But, quantification of these elements by EDS is difficult and their minimum detectable limits are higher than when a wavelength-dispersive spectrometer (WDS) is used. But quantification of composition by EDS has improved greatly over time. The WDS system has historically had better sensitivity (ability to detect low amounts of an element) and ability to detect low-atomic weight elements, as well as better quantification of compositions, compared to EDS, but it was slower to use. Again, in recent years, the speed required to perform WDS analysis has improved substantially. Historically, EDS was used with the SEM while WDS was used with the electron microprobe analyzer (EMPA). Today, EDS and WDS is used with both the SEM and the EMPA. However, a dedicated EMPA is not as common as an SEM.\n\nCharacterization of microstructures has also been performed using x-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques for many years. XRD can be used to determine the percentages of various phases present in a specimen if they have different crystal structures. For example, the amount of retained austenite in a hardened steel is best measured using XRD (ASTM E 975). If a particular phase can be chemically extracted from a bulk specimen, it can be identified using XRD based on the crystal structure and lattice dimensions. This work can be complemented by EDS and/or WDS analysis where the chemical composition is quantified. But EDS and WDS are difficult to apply to particles less than 2-3 micrometers in diameter. For smaller particles, diffraction techniques can be performed using the TEM for identification and EDS can be performed on small particles if they are extracted from the matrix using replication methods to avoid detection of the matrix along with the precipitate.\n\nA number of techniques exist to quantitatively analyze metallographic specimens. These techniques are valuable in the research and production of all metals and alloys and non-metallic or composite materials. \n\nMicrostructural quantification is performed on a prepared, two-dimensional plane through the three-dimensional part or component. Measurements may involve simple metrology techniques, e.g., the measurement of the thickness of a surface coating, or the apparent diameter of a discrete second-phase particle, (for example, spheroidal graphite in ductile iron). Measurement may also require application of stereology to assess matrix and second-phase structures. Stereology is the field of taking 0-, 1- or 2-dimensional measurements on the two-dimensional sectioning plane and estimating the amount, size, shape or distribution of the microstructure in three dimensions. These measurements may be made using manual procedures with the aid of templates overlaying the microstructure, or with automated image analyzers. In all cases, adequate sampling must be made to obtain a proper statistical basis for the measurement. Efforts to eliminate bias are required.\n\nSome of the most basic measurements include determination of the volume fraction of a phase or constituent, measurement of the grain size in polycrystalline metals and alloys, measurement of the size and size distribution of particles, assessment of the shape of particles, and spacing between particles. \n\nStandards organizations, including ASTM International's Committee E-4 on Metallography and some other national and international organizations, have developed standard test methods describing how to characterize microstructures quantitatively. \n\nFor example, the amount of a phase or constituent, that is, its volume fraction, is defined in ASTM E 562; manual grain size measurements are described in ASTM E 112 (equiaxed grain structures with a single size distribution) and E 1182 (specimens with a bi-modal grain size distribution); while ASTM E 1382 describes how any grain size type or condition can be measured using image analysis methods. Characterization of nonmetallic inclusions using standard charts is described in ASTM E 45 (historically, E 45 covered only manual chart methods and an image analysis method for making such chart measurements was described in ASTM E 1122. The image analysis methods are currently being incorporated into E 45). A stereological method for characterizing discrete second-phase particles, such as nonmetallic inclusions, carbides, graphite, etc., is presented in ASTM E 1245.\n\n\n"}

He played two and a half seasons with Inter Milan before joining Paris Saint-Germain in January 2012, winning 27 major titles between the three clubs combined. He also had brief spells with Atlético Madrid in Spain, and Genoa in Italy.\n\nBorn in Brazil, Motta also holds Italian citizenship. After making two appearances for his country of birth in 2003, he represented the latter national team a total of 30 times since making his debut in 2011, scoring once. He appeared at the 2014 World Cup and two European Championships with Italy, finishing second at Euro 2012.\n\nFollowing his retirement in 2018, he coached Paris Saint-Germain youths. In October 2019, he was appointed as Genoa's new manager, being fired in December following a bad series of results.\n\nBorn in São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo, Motta signed with FC Barcelona in 1999 at age 17 from local Clube Atlético Juventus, initially being assigned to the club's B-side. He eventually graduated to the first team in 2001, making his official debut on 3 October against RCD Mallorca in a 3–0 home win.\n\nIn the 2001–02 edition of the UEFA Champions League, Motta made seven appearances and helped his team to the semi-finals. In the 2002–03 season in La Liga, he appeared in a career-best 21 games (with three goals) as \"Barça\" could only finish in sixth position, and also played an important part in the following season's long UEFA Cup run, which was eventually ended by Celtic; in the first leg, a 0–1 loss in Glasgow (0–1 on aggregate), he was sent off during half-time after hitting out at opposing goalkeeper Robert Douglas who was also shown the red card, in an incident that happened in the tunnel.\n\nMotta was also dogged by several injuries, particularly one suffered on 11 September 2004 against Sevilla FC, which sidelined him for seven months, during his time at Barcelona. He would eventually need surgery to rebuild the anterior cruciate and lateral ligaments in his left knee, but was able to make a swift recovery and made an emotional comeback, taking to the field to rapturous applause as eventual league champions defeated Getafe CF 2–0 on 17 April.\n\nIn late August 2007, Motta signed a one-year contract with Atlético Madrid, for an undisclosed fee. Once again he began the season on the sidelines, injured; in the Copa del Rey quarter-final match against Valencia CF he was ejected after only 25 minutes, and the \"Colchoneros\" lost the away fixture 0–1 and subsequently the tie.\n\nDue to injury to regular starter Raúl García and the departure of Maniche in January 2008, Motta's opportunities increased. In March, however, the recurrent knee problems reappeared and his season was over, followed by a successful surgery and rehabilitation in the United States; he trialled with Premier League side Portsmouth after his release, but did not sign for them.\n\nIn September 2008, Motta joined Genoa C.F.C. on a free transfer, after passing a medical. During his debut campaign he performed consistently well and was a regular in the starting eleven, under coach Gian Piero Gasperini.\n\nOn 11 April 2009, Motta scored two goals (one of them in the first half's injury time) in a final 3–2 home win over Juventus FC. He finished the year with a career-best six goals, and his team qualified for the Europa League.\n\nOn 20 May 2009, \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" confirmed that Motta, alongside teammate Diego Milito, transferred to Inter Milan, who paid €28 million for the latter and €10.2 million for the former while as part of the deal, Genoa received five Inter players: Robert Acquafresca, Francesco Bolzoni, Leonardo Bonucci, Ivan Fatić and Riccardo Meggiorini. Motta's agent, Dario Canovi, later revealed that his Genoa contract with the club included a buy-out fee of €10 million.\n\nMotta's debut came in the 2009–10 season's opener, a 1–1 home draw against A.S. Bari, and his first goal came the next round as he opened the scoresheet in the \"Derby della Madonnina\" after an assist by Milito, as Inter defeated A.C. Milan 4–0. Having been in and out of the team for the duration of the campaign, he netted his first brace for Inter in a 3–0 win against Bologna F.C. 1909 on 3 April 2010.\n\nMotta also appeared in eight games during the club's victorious Champions League campaign, including the 0–1 loss at former side Barcelona for the semifinals (3–2 aggregate win). During that match, he was sent off after apparently striking Sergio Busquets in the face with his hand; the incident gathered attention due to Busquets' apparent feigning of injury.\n\nOn 23 October 2011, from a corner taken by Wesley Sneijder, Motta scored through a header in a 1–0 win against A.C. ChievoVerona, which was Inter's first home win in 2011–12.\n\nOn 31 January 2012, in spite of Inter manager Claudio Ranieri indicating shortly before he was confident the player would remain with the club until the end of the season, having called him to the upcoming league match against U.S. Città di Palermo, Motta signed with Paris Saint-Germain F.C. in France, for a fee believed to be around €10 million. Following his move, he revealed that he dreamt of playing for the club ever since fellow Brazilians such as Raí, Leonardo and Ronaldinho shone in the French capital; he also revealed that he was not happy at Inter, refusing to further elaborate on his reasons to leave.\n\nFour days after signing for the club, Motta made his debut for PSG, against Evian Thonon Gaillard F.C. in a 3–1 home win, being booked in the process. On 22 April 2012, in another home fixture, he scored his first goal in Ligue 1, contributing to a 6–1 victory over FC Sochaux-Montbéliard.\n\nOn 21 February 2014, aged 31, Motta extended his contract until June 2016. In August, he was left with a broken nose after being headbutted by SC Bastia's Brandão in the tunnel, as his opponent went on to be suspended for six months.\n\nMotta announced his retirement for the end of the season on 8 May 2018, while also being appointed as the new coach of PSG's under-19 side. During his six-and-a-half-year stint at the Parc des Princes he played 232 competitives matches and won 19 trophies, making his final appearance on 19 May against Stade Malherbe Caen.\n\nMotta made his debut for Brazil in the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Although he played with the under-23 team it was a full international competition, hence the international cap won was fully recognized by FIFA; he went on to appear in another two games in the tournament, and previously represented the nation at the 1999 South American Under-17 Football Championship.\n\nMotta missed the 2004 CONMEBOL Men Pre-Olympic Tournament due to injuries, but appeared for the U23 team in November 2003 against Santos FC. Subsequently, there were claims that he wanted to be called up for Italy and possibly to the 2010 FIFA World Cup, as he possessed dual nationality – his paternal grandfather being Italian. His great-grandfather, Fortunato Fogagnolo, left for South America from Polesella in the early 1900s. FIFA granted players to have one chance to change their representing nation if they had dual nationality, but not for players who have already played in a competitive \"A\" match (non-friendly).\nOn 6 February 2011, Motta received his first call-up from Italy, for a friendly against Germany, but an official statement from the Italian Football Federation declared it subject to FIFA clearance, which was granted two days later; he made his debut in that match, being replaced in the 63rd minute of the 1–1 draw by Alberto Aquilani.\n\nOn 25 March 2011, in only his second international, a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier in Slovenia, Motta scored the game's only goal, following a 73rd-minute combination with Federico Balzaretti. He was selected to the finals in Poland and Ukraine, starting in three group stage matches for the \"Azzurri\" and adding two substitute appearances, against Germany in the semi-finals (2–1 win) and Spain in the final: in the decisive match, after having again replaced Riccardo Montolivo, in the 55th minute, he suffered a hamstring injury after only five minutes and had to be carried off, leaving his team with ten players as he was the third and last allowable player brought in by manager Cesare Prandelli – in an eventual 0–4 loss.\n\nMotta was named in a 30-man provisional squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup on 13 May, and also made the final list. He played his first-ever game in the tournament at the age of nearly 32, coming on in the 57th minute of the 2–1 group stage win over England.\n\nOn 31 May 2016, Motta was named to Antonio Conte's 23-man Italy squad for Euro 2016, and was handed the number 10 shirt. The decision to assign him that number sparked controversy, although international teammate Daniele De Rossi later defended the manager's decision stating: \"Those who have joked about it just don't know much about football. Just play the ball around a bit with Thiago Motta and then you will rinse your mouth out. He might not be a No. 10 like [Roberto] Baggio or [Francesco] Totti, but technically he's a master.\" He was suspended for the quarter-final match against Germany, after being booked for the second time in the competition in the previous round against Spain.\n\nA combative player, Motta was usually deployed as either a defensive or central midfielder, but he was capable of playing in various other midfield positions due to his tactical intelligence and versatility. In the Italian national team, under Prandelli, he was on occasion deployed as a deep-lying playmaker or an attacking midfielder, due to his ability to set the tempo of his team's play in midfield with his passing. At Euro 2012, he played in a new role of false attacking midfielder in Prandelli's 4–3–1–2 formation.\n\nMotta's most prominent traits were his ball control, technique, vision and passing range, although he was also praised for his tackling, ability to read the game and consistent defensive attributes as a ball winner. Due to his physical strength, heading accuracy and ability to make late attacking runs from behind into the penalty area, he excelled in the air, and also possessed a powerful long-range shot; despite his skills, he was also criticised for his aggression on the pitch and his lack of pace.\n\nFollowing his retirement from professional football in May 2018, Motta became the new coach of Paris Saint-Germain's under-19 side. In an interview with \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" in November of that year, he stated that he wanted to revolutionise football with a 4–3–3 formation that could be interpreted as a 2–7–2, commenting: \n\nIn August 2019, Motta enrolled in the UEFA Pro Licence courses at the Centro Tecnico Federale di Coverciano. On 21 October, his former club Genoa, at the time occupying the second-to-last position in the Italian top tier, announced his appointment as the new manager, replacing the recently dismissed Aurelio Andreazzoli. In his first official match in charge, five days later, he led the team to come from behind and achieve a 3–1 home win over Brescia Calcio. With the side in last place, however, he was fired on 28 December.\n\n\"Italy score listed first.

The term describes the idea that certain people are divinely destined to meet and share their love (at differing points along the carnal-spiritual spectrum, depending on the particular religious movement involved) after a receiving a spiritual confirmation, and regardless of previous \"civil\" marital bonds. Its history in Europe among various Christian primitivistic movements has been well documented. The followers of Jacob Cochran as early as 1818 used \"spiritual wifery\" to describe their religious doctrine of free love. Often confused with polygamy, spiritual wifery among the Cochranites was the practice in which communal mates were temporarily assigned and reassigned, either by personal preference or religious authority.\n\nThe term was later introduced to the Latter Day Saint movement by John C. Bennett, who openly applied it to the doctrine of plural marriage. According to Helen Mar Whitney, \"At the time [in Nauvoo] spiritual wife was the title by which every woman who entered into this order was called, for it was taught and practiced as a spiritual order.\" Bennett was soon excommunicated for such offenses.\n\nWilliam Smith, youngest brother of Joseph Smith and an Apostle of and briefly Patriarch to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, wrote a little-known pamphlet in late 1844, called \"The Elders' Pocket Companion\", explaining his own views on the differences between \"the Spiritual Wife System\" and \"plurality of wives\". Smith explained that spiritual wifery was the practice of: (1) an Latter Day Saint woman standing as living proxy for her husband's previous civil wife (or wives) to be \"sealed\" to him for all eternity by the power of Latter Day Saint priesthood, and (2) unmarried Latter Day Saint women being sealed plurally to Latter Day Saint men during the \"Millennium\" (the post-apocalyptic thousand-year reign of Jesus on the earth). The \"plurality of wives doctrine\" however, Smith wrote, was simply biblical polygamy as practiced by the \"ancient Prophets and Patriarchs\". Citing the Book of Mormon, Smith ended his pamphlet emphasizing that the Book of Mormon, while generally proscribing biblical-type polygamy, does include the caveat, \"For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up a seed unto me, I WILL COMMAND MY PEOPLE\" (emphasis is Smith's). Smith's theories however belied his actions, for he not only had some five civil wives (two of whom he was sealed to by the priesthood) but he was also sealed to some 17 other women, whom he generally referred to as \"spiritual wives\".\n\nThe term \"complex marriage\" was later used by the Oneida Community in the 1840s to describe a free marriage practice similar to spiritual wifery.\n\n"}

The locomotives are also commonly known as the Sybics.\n\nThe class were built to fulfil both freight and passenger roles; the specifications included the ability to haul 16 Corail coaches at on a 0.25% gradient, and to haul a freight train at on a 0.88% gradient.\n\nThe locomotives are a two cabin design with the body built out of steel, two pantographs are fitted; one for 1500 V operation, the other for 25 kV operation. A 25 kV AC supply is stepped down and rectified to 1500 V, a 1500 V supply feeds the power electronics directly. Each of the three elements of the thyristor bridge based three phase inverter circuits are connected in parallel, with the two three phase supplies per motor being series connected.

Drive from the traction motors to wheel is via a floating ring vibration isolation element (French:\"anneau dansant\") and hollow shaft drive.\n\nMono-motor bogies were chosen based on the good performance in the SNCF BB 22200, SNCF BB 15000 and SNCF BB 7200 classes. A synchronous motor was chosen over a commutated motor or an asynchronous motor due to the reduced mass, simplicity of equipment, and price.\n\nTwo locomotives SNCF BB 20011 and 20012 were used to develop and test the dual voltage traction system, microprocessor control systems and auxiliary motors, BB 20012 was used to develop and test the pneumatic and electrical braking system.\n\nThe Paris-based industrial design group MBD Design contributed to the design of the locomotive.\n\n264 of the class were ordered by SNCF, only 234 were built, the last 30 of the order were instead built as a new triple voltage design capable of also operating on 3 kV DC; these used asynchronous electric motors and became the SNCF Class BB 36000 (\"Asytrit\").\n\nThe class have been used in most regions of France.\n\nIn June 2000 26084 was involved in an accident caused by sabotage near Chasse-sur-Rhône, and is no longer in service.

It is the recommended interface for name resolution in building protocol independent applications and for transitioning legacy IPv4 code to the IPv6 Internet.\n\nInternally, the functions perform resolutions using the Domain Name System (DNS) by calling other, lower level functions, such as gethostbyname().\n\nOn February 16 2016 a security bug was announced in the glibc implementation of getaddrinfo(), using a buffer overflow technique, that may allow execution of arbitrary code by the attacker.\n\nThe C data structure used to represent addresses and hostnames within the networking API is the following:\nIn some older systems the type of \"ai_addrlen\" is \"size_t\" instead of \"socklen_t\". Most socket functions, such as \"accept()\" and \"getpeername()\", require the parameter to have type \"socklen_t * \" and programmers often pass the address to the \"ai_addrlen\" element of the \"addrinfo\" structure. If the types are incompatible, e.g., on a 64-bit Solaris 9 system where \"size_t\" is 8 bytes and \"socklen_t\" is 4 bytes, then run-time errors may result.\n\nThe structure contains structures \"ai_family\" and \"sockaddr\" with its own \"sa_family\" field. These are set to the same value when the structure is created with function \"getaddrinfo\" in some implementations.\n\ngetaddrinfo() converts human-readable text strings representing hostnames or IP addresses into a dynamically allocated linked list of struct addrinfo structures.\nThe function prototypes for these functions are specified as follows:\n\nAlthough implementations vary among platforms, the function first attempts to obtain a port number usually by branching on \"service\". If the string value is a number, it converts it to an integer and calls \"htons()\". If it is a service name, such as \"www\", the service is lookup with \"getservbyname()\", using the protocol derived from \"hints->ai_socktype\" as the second parameter to that function. Then, if \"hostname\" is given (not NULL), a call to \"gethostbyname()\" resolves it, or otherwise the address \"0.0.0.0\" is used, if \"hints->ai_flags\" is set to \"AI_PASSIVE\", and \"127.0.0.1\" otherwise. It allocated a new \"addrinfo\" structure filled with the appropriate \"sockaddr_in\" in one of these conditions and also adds the port retrieved at the beginning to it. Finally, the \"**res\" parameter is dereferenced to make it point to a newly allocated \"addrinfo\" structure. In some implementations, such as the Unix version for Mac OS, the \"hints->ai_protocol \" overrides the \"hints->ai_socktype\" value while in others it is the opposite, so both need to be defined with equivalent values for the code to be work across multiple platforms.\n\n\"getnameinfo()\" converts the internal binary representation of an IP address in the form of a \"struct sockaddr\" pointer into text strings consisting of the hostname or, if the address cannot be resolved into a name, a textual IP address representation, as well as the service port name or number. The function prototype is specified as follows:\nThis function frees the memory allocated by the \"getaddrinfo()\" function. As the result of the latter is a linked list of addrinfo structures, \" freeaddrinfo()\" loops through the list and frees each one in turn.\n\n\nThe following example uses \"getaddrinfo()\" to resolve the domain name \"www.example.com\" into its list of addresses and then calls \"getnameinfo()\" on each result to return the canonical name for the address. In general, this produces the original hostname, unless the particular address has multiple names, in which case the \"canonical\" name is returned. In this example, the domain name is printed three times, once for each of the three results obtained.\n\n\n"}

Their common uses including grading the purity of materials.\n\nPut simply, \"nines\" are the number of consecutive nines in a percentage such as 99% (two nines) or a decimal fraction such as 0.999 (three nines). The number of nines of a proportion is\n\nformula_1\n\nHowever, there are different conventions for stating a non-integer number of nines. 99.5% could be expressed as \"two nines five\" or 2.3 nines, as outlined below. A completely pure material ( = 1) would have an infinite number of nines.\n\nVery fine precious metals such as platinum, gold and silver. Based on the system of millesimal fineness, a metal is said to be \"one nine\" or \"one nine fine\" if it is 900 fine, or 90% pure. A metal that is 990 fine is then described as \"two nines fine\" and one that is 999 fine is described as \"three nines fine\". Thus, nines are a logarithmic scale of purity for very fine precious metals. Similarly, percentages ending in a 5 have conventional names, traditionally the number of nines, then \"five\", so 999.5 fine (99.95% pure) is \"three nines five\", abbreviated 3N5. \n\nThe nines scale is also sometimes used in describing the purity of bottled gases. The purity of gas is an indication of the amount of other gases it contains. A high purity refers to a low amount of other gases. Gases of higher purity are considered to be of better quality and are usually more expensive.\n\nThe purity of a gas is generally expressed as a grade prefixed with the letter N giving the \"number of nines\" in the percentage or decimal fraction. For gasses, the number of nines is usually written after the letter N, rather than before it. An N2.0 gas is 99% pure, and 1% (by volume) impurities. An N6.0 gas is 99.9999% (six nines) pure, with 1 part per million (1 ppm) impurities.\n\nIntermediate values are formed using the common logarithm. For example, a gas which is 99.97% pure would be described as N3.5, since log(0.03%) = −3.523.\n\nNines are used in a similar manner to describe computer system availability.\n\n"}

{"id": "2322909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322909", "title": "Eirik Bakke", "text": "Eirik Bakke\n\nEirik Bakke (born 13 September 1977 in Sogndal) is a Norwegian retired football player. He played on the right-hand side or centre of midfield.\n\nBakke played 99 matches for Sogndal. His father Svein formerly played for the team.\n\nBakke was bought by Leeds United in 1999 from Sogndal for £1.75 million. After an encouraging start to his career at Leeds in 1999 and 2000, injuries and poor form meant that he never quite became a mainstay of the Leeds squad, even after the club was relegated from the Premiership in 2004.\n\nBakke's career has been blighted by recurrent knee injuries. Patella tendinitis kept him out of the team for the start of the 2004-05 season and he was struck with a torn cruciate ligament on his return in January 2005. In August 2005, having recovered from his injury, Bakke was loaned to Aston Villa. The loan however was ended early after Leeds told Villa that they would only let Bakke go permanently, not on loan and Doug Ellis, Villa's chairman at the time, decided that it was not worth permanently acquiring his services.\n\nSpeculation continued as to Bakke's future when he was left out of the Leeds United squad for the match against Sheffield Wednesday on 27 August 2006 with some in the press and supporters speculating that this was due to an imminent transfer. A club statement was released on 29 August 2006 by Leeds United effectively stating that Bakke had played his last game in Leeds United colours. Bakke however stated he would like to stay at the club, and still trained with the club, despite not playing, not wanting to return to playing in Norway at that point in time. The problem arose due to his £23,000 a week wages and £4,000 appearance fees, which were originally agreed during Ridsdale's \"\"Living The Dream\"\" era, but which the club could no longer afford to pay in the league they were currently playing in. Leeds United tried to resolve the issue by attempting to meet Bakke half way so that the player could stay at the club on lesser wages but Bakke's agent stated he wanted the contractually agreed wage. The situation did not look good for Bakke, with Leeds chairman Ken Bates having already terminated Seth Johnson's contract due to excessive wages as part of a determined effort to make Leeds a successful and profitable club once more. Bakke left, being the third last 'O'Leary player' left at Leeds.\n\nOn 31 August 2006, Bakke signed a two-year deal with SK Brann, and returned home to Norway. The deal was financed by Hardball. Certain media outlets have claimed that Bakke and Brann have a \"gentlemen's agreement\", that Bakke can leave Brann if a big club wants to sign him, though this has been denied by Brann. Bakke has stated that he still has ambitions to prove himself in Europe before bringing his career to a close in Norway.\n\nBakke debuted for Brann on 11 September 2006 against Stabæk, in a match best remembered for a two-feet tackle by Joakim Persson of Stabæk on Bakke that could easily have ended Bakke's career.\n\nBakke started the 2007 season playing for Brann 2 in a bid to regain full fitness from his injury problems. He has experienced a bit of a stop-start season, making his first full Tippeliga start on 26 June 2007. Eirik Bakke has been mostly noticed for his no-nonsense approach and English inspired tackling in midfield, but also managed to score the winning goal against arch-rivals Rosenborg BK on 11 August 2007.\n\nBakke has promised Brann that when he is close to retirement he would finish his career in Norway with the club, playing a further 1-2 seasons. In front of the 2008 season, Bakke became captain of Brann. On 30 May 2008, Bakke extended his Brann deal out 2010. However his new deal had a clause giving Bakke the chance to re-evaluate his deal, if the club decided to lay artificial turf at Brann Stadion. A few weeks later, Brann announced that the club will continue with natural grass as the turf at Brann Stadion also in the coming years.\n\nHe signed a two-year deal with Sogndal in 2011. In November 2012 he decided to retire as an active player.\n\nHe made his debut for Norway in a January 1999 friendly match against Israel, coming on as a substitute for Egil Østenstad and earned 26 caps since, scoring no goals. His last international match was an March 2008 friendly match against Montenegro, coming on as a substitute for Martin Andresen.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2322912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322912", "title": "Firearm Owners Protection Act", "text": "Firearm Owners Protection Act\n\nThe Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 (FOPA) is a United States federal law that revised many provisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968.\n\nUnder the Gun Control Act of 1968, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) was given wide latitude on the enforcement of regulations pertaining to holders of Federal Firearms Licenses (FFL) (which enable an individual or a company to engage in a business pertaining to the manufacture or importation of firearms and ammunition, or the interstate and intrastate sale of firearms). Allegations of abuse by ATF inspectors after passage of the act arose from the National Rifle Association (NRA) and some FFL licensees. In particular, advocates claimed that ATF was repeatedly inspecting FFL holders for the apparent purpose of harassment intended to drive the FFL holders out of business (as the FFL holders would constantly be having to tend to ATF inspections instead of to customers).\n\nA February 1982 report by a Republican-led Senate subcommittee that studied the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution concluded:\n\nThe report also said that 75 percent of ATF prosecutions \"were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into unknowing technical violations.\" It suggested that reform of federal firearms law such as proposed in S. 1030 \"would be largely self-enforcing\" and \"would enhance vital protection of constitutional and civil liberties of those Americans who choose to exercise their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\"\n\nThe Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 (FOPA) addressed the abuses noted in the 1982 Senate Judiciary Subcommittee report. Among the reforms intended to loosen restrictions on gun sales were the reopening of interstate sales of long guns on a limited basis, legalization of ammunition shipments through the U.S. Postal Service, removal of the requirement for record keeping on sales of non-armor-piercing ammunition, and federal protection of transportation of firearms through states where possession of those firearms would otherwise be illegal.\n\nThe Act also contained a provision that banned the sale of machine guns manufactured after the date of enactment to civilians, restricting sales of these weapons to the military and law enforcement. Thus, in the ensuing years, the limited supply of these arms available to civilians has caused an enormous increase in their price, with most costing in excess of $10,000. Regarding these fully-automatic firearms owned by private citizens in the U.S., political scientist Earl Kruschke said \"approximately 175,000 automatic firearms have been licensed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (the federal agency responsible for administration of the law) and evidence suggests that none of these weapons has ever been used to commit a violent crime.\"\n\nThe Act mandated that ATF compliance inspections can be done only once per year. An exception to the \"once per year\" rule exists if multiple record-keeping violations are recorded in an inspection, in which case the ATF may do a follow-up inspection. The main reason for a follow-up inspection would be if guns could not be accounted for.\n\nAs debate for FOPA was in its final stages in the House before moving on to the Senate, Rep. William J. Hughes (D-N.J.) proposed several amendments including House Amendment 777 to H.R. 4332, which modified the act to ban the civilian ownership of new machine guns, specifically to amend to add subsection (o):\n\n(o)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machinegun.\n(2) This subsection does not apply with respect to—\n(A) a transfer to or by, or possession by or under the authority of, the United States or any department or agency thereof or a State, or a department, agency, or political subdivision thereof; or\n(B) any lawful transfer or lawful possession of a machinegun that was lawfully possessed before the date this subsection takes effect.\n\nThe ATF, as a representative of the U.S. and with authority from the National Firearms Act, can authorize the transfer of a machine gun to an unlicensed civilian. An unlicensed individual may acquire machine guns, with ATF approval. The transferor must file an ATF application, which must be completed by both parties to the transfer:\n\n\nIf ATF denies an application, it must refund the tax. Gun owners must keep approved applications as evidence of registration of the firearms and make them available for inspection by ATF officers.\n\nIn the morning hours of April 10, 1986, H.Amdt.777 Amendment passed the House by voice vote, and the House held recorded votes on three amendments to FOPA in Record Vote No's 72, 73, and 74. Recorded Vote 72 was on H.AMDT. 776, an amendment to H.AMDT 770 involving the interstate sale of handguns; while Recorded Vote 74 was on H.AMDT 770, involving primarily the easing of interstate sales and the safe passage provision. Recorded Vote 74 was the Hughes Amendment that called for the banning of machine guns. Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), at the time presiding as Chairman over the proceedings, claimed that the \"amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to.\" However, after the voice vote on the Hughes Amendment, Rangel ignored a plea to take a recorded vote and moved on to Recorded Vote 74. The bill, H.R. 4332, as a whole passed in Record Vote No: 75 on a motion to recommit. Despite the controversial amendment, the Senate, in S.B. 49, adopted H.R. 4332 as an amendment to the final bill. The bill was subsequently passed and signed on May 19, 1986 by President Ronald Reagan to become Public Law 99-308, the Firearms Owners' Protection Act.\n\nOne of the law's provisions (codified in section 926A of title 18 of the U.S. Code) was that persons traveling from one place to another have a defense for any state firearms offense in a state that has strict gun control laws if the traveler is just passing through (short stops for food and gasoline), provided that the individual is not otherwise prohibited from possession of a firearm, the firearms and ammunition are not readily accessible, that the firearms are unloaded and, in the case of a vehicle without a compartment separate from the driver's compartment, the firearms are located in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console.\n\nThis section has also been interpreted to protect air travel.\n\nDefinitions of certain terms in the law include:\n\n\nThe Act also forbade the U.S. Government agency from keeping a registry directly linking non-National Firearms Act firearms to their owners, the specific language of this law (Federal Law 18 U.S.C. 926 <https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/926>) being:\n\nNo such rule or regulation prescribed [by the Attorney General] after the date of the enactment of the Firearms Owners Protection Act may require that records required to be maintained under this chapter or any portion of the contents of such records, be recorded at or transferred to a facility owned, managed, or controlled by the United States or any State or any political subdivision thereof, nor that any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or disposition be established. Nothing in this section expands or restricts the Secretary's authority to inquire into the disposition of any firearm in the course of a criminal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, at one point the ATF's National Tracing Center (NTC) contained hundreds of millions of firearm tracing and registration records, and consisted of several databases; but as of May 2016, many of these databases have been deleted to fall inline with record deletion requirements, per the Government Accountability Office (GAO).\n\nThe older Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibits firearms ownership in the U.S. by certain categories of individuals thought to pose a threat to public safety. However, this list differed between the House and the Senate versions of the bill, and led to confusion. The list was later augmented, modified, and clarified in the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986. The 1986 list is:\n\n\nThese provisions are stated in the form of questions on Federal Form 4473.\n\nIn 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (consisting of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi) ruled that the \"Lautenberg Amendment\", 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) (which extended the original FOPA restrictions on firearm ownership to persons under a court order in connection with domestic violence) did not violate the Second Amendment, and did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment as applied to the defendant, in \"United States v. Emerson\".\n\n\n\n"}

K. Fazlul Huq, the Prime Minister of Bengal, was a formal political statement adopted by the All-India Muslim League on the occasion of its three-day general session in Lahore on 22–24 March 1940. The resolution called for independent states as seen by the statement:That geographically contiguous units are demarcated regions which should be constituted, with such territorial readjustments as may be necessary that the areas in which the Muslims are numerically in a majority as in the North Western and Eastern Zones of (British) India should be grouped to constitute ‘independent states’ in which the constituent units should be autonomous and sovereign.Although the name \"Pakistan\" had been proposed by Choudhary Rahmat Ali in his Pakistan Declaration, it was not until after the resolution that it began to be widely used.\n\nMuhammad Ali Jinnah's address to the Lahore conference was, according to Stanley Wolpert, the moment when Jinnah, a former proponent of Hindu-Muslim unity, irrevocably transformed himself into the leader of the fight for an independent Pakistan.\n\nUntil the mid-1930s the Muslim leaders were trying to ensure maximum political safeguards for Muslims within the framework of federation of India in terms of seeking maximum autonomy for Muslim majority provinces. They got some safeguards through a system of separate electorate on communal basis in the 1935 Government of India Act. As a result of elections held under this Act, Indian National Congress formed government in six out of eight provinces. During Congress rule from 1937–39, its \"High Command whose iron control over its own provinces clearly hinted at what lay ahead for the Muslim majority provinces once it came to dominate the center. Much of the League’s propaganda at this stage was directed against the Congress ministries and their alleged attacks on Muslim culture; the heightened activity of Hindu Mahasabha, the hoisting of Congress tricolor, the singing of Bande Mataram, the Vidya Mandir scheme in the Central Provinces and the Wardha scheme of education, all were interpreted as proof of ‘Congress atrocities’. So, the Congress was clearly incapable of representing Muslim interests, yet it was trying to annihilate every other party.\"\n\nTherefore, by 1938-39, the idea of separation was strongly gaining ground. The Sindh Provincial Muslim League Conference held its first session in Karachi in October 1938, adopted a resolution which recommended to the All India Muslim League to devise a scheme of constitution under which Muslims may attain full independence. The premier of the Bengal provinces, A. K. Fazal-ul-Haque, who was not in the All India Muslim League, was quite convinced in favor of separation. The idea was more vividly expressed by M. A. Jinnah in an article in the London weekly \"Time & Tide\" on 9 March 1940. Jinnah wrote:\n\nDemocratic systems based on the concept of homogeneous nation such as England are very definitely not applicable to heterogeneous countries such as India, and this simple fact is the root cause of all of India’s constitutional ills……If, therefore, it is accepted that there is in India a major and a minor nation, it follows that a parliamentary system based on the majority principle must inevitably mean the rule of major nation. Experience has proved that, whatever the economic and political program of any political Party, the Hindu, as a general rule, will vote for his caste-fellow, the Muslim for his coreligionist.\n\nAbout the Congress-led provincial governments, he wrote:\n\nAn India-wide attack on the Muslims was launched. In the five Muslim provinces every attempt was made to defeat the Muslim-led-coalition Ministries...In the six Hindu provinces a “Kulturkampf” was inaugurated. Attempts were made to have Bande Mataram, the Congress Party song, recognized as the national anthem, the Party flag, and the real national language, Urdu, supplanted by Hindi. Everywhere oppression commenced and complaints poured in such force…that the Muslims, despairing of the Viceroy and Governors ever taking action to protect them, have already been forced to ask for a Royal Commission to investigate their grievances.\n\nFurthermore, he added:\n\nIs it the desire (of British people) that India should become a totalitarian Hindu State….? ….. and I feel certain that Muslim India will never submit to such a position and will be forced to resist it with every means in their power.\n\nIn his concluding remarks he wrote:\n\nWhile Muslim League irrevocably opposed to any Federal objective which must necessarily result in a majority community rule under the guise of Democracy and Parliamentary system of Government...To conclude, a constitution must be evolved that recognizes that there are in India two nations who both must share the governance of their common motherland.\n\nThe session was held on 22–24 March 1940, at Iqbal Park, Lahore. The welcome address was made by Sir Shah Nawaz Khan of Mamdot, as the chairman of the local reception committee. The various draft texts for the final resolution/draft were deliberated over by the Special Working Committee of the All India Muslim League\n\nThe resolution text, unanimously approved by the Subject Committee, accepted the concept of a united homeland for Muslims and recommended the creation of an independent Muslim state.\nThe resolution was moved in the general session by A. K. Fazlul Huq, the chief minister of undivided Bengal, and was seconded by Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman from the United Provinces, Zafar Ali Khan from Punjab, Sardar Aurangzeb Khan from North-West Frontier Province, and Sir Abdullah Haroon from Sindh. Qazi Muhammad Essa from Baluchistan and other leaders announced their support.\n\nThe resolution for the establishment of a separate homeland for the Muslims of British India passed in the annual session of the All India Muslim League held in Lahore on 22–24 March 1940 is a landmark document of Pakistan's history. In 1946, it formed the basis for the decision of Muslim League to struggle for one state [ later named Pakistan] for the Muslims. The statement declared:\nThe Hindu press and leaders were quick to describe the resolution as the demand for the creation of Pakistan; some people began to call it the Pakistan Resolution soon after the Lahore session of the Muslim League. It is landmark document in history of Pakistan.\nAdditionally, it stated:\n\nMost importantly, to convince smaller provinces such as Sindh to join, it provided a guarantee:\n\nThe full text of the resolution document was as follows:\n\n\"THE LAHORE RESOLUTION\"\n\nResolved at the Lahore Session of All-India Muslim League held on 22-24 March, 1940.\n\n(1)   While approving and endorsing the action taken by the Council and the Working Committee of the All Indian Muslim League as indicated in their resolutions dated the 27 of August, 17 and 18 of September and 22 of October, 1939, and 3 February 1940 on the constitutional issues, this Session of the All-Indian Muslim League emphatically reiterates that the scheme of federation embodied in the Government of India Act, 1935, is totally unsuited to, and unworkable in the peculiar conditions of this country and is altogether unacceptable to Muslim India.\n\n(2)   It further records its emphatic view that while the declaration dated the 18 of October, 1939 made by the Viceroy on behalf of His Majesty's Government is reassuring in so far as it declares that the policy and plan on which the Government of India Act 1935, is based will be reconsidered in consultation with the various parties, interests and communities in India, Muslim India will not be satisfied unless the whole constitutional plan is reconsidered \"de novo\" and that no revised plan would be acceptable to the Muslims unless it is framed with their approval and consent.\n\n(3)   Resolved that it is the considered view of this Session of the All India Muslim League that no constitutional plan would be workable in this country or acceptable to Muslims unless it is designed on the following basic principle, namely that geographically contiguous units are demarcated into regions which should be so constituted, with such territorial readjustments as may be necessary, that the areas in which the Muslims are numerically in a majority as in the North-Western and Eastern Zones of India, should be grouped o constitute “Independent States” in which the constituent units shall be autonomous and sovereign.\n\nThat adequate, effective and mandatory safeguards should be specifically provided in the constitution for minorities in these units and in these regions for the protection of their religious, cultural, economic, political, administrative and other rights and interests in consultation with them; and in other parts of India where the Mussalmans are in a minority, adequate, effective and mandatory safeguards shall be specially provided in the constitution for them and other minorities for the protection of their religious, cultural, economic, political, administrative and other rights and interests in consultation with them.\n\nThis Session further authorizes the Working Committee to frame a scheme of constitution in accordance with these basic principles, providing for the assumption finally by the respective regions of all powers such as defense, external affairs, communications, customs and such other matters as may be necessary.\"\n\nThere remains a debate on whether the resolution envisaged two sovereign states in the eastern and western parts of British India. Abdul Hashim of the Bengal Muslim League interpreted the text as a demand for two separate countries. In 1946, Prime Minister H. S. Suhrawardy of Bengal, a member of the All India Muslim League, mooted the United Bengal proposal with the support of Muslim and Hindu leaders, as well as the Governor of Bengal. However, it was opposed by Lord Mountbatten, the Muslim League, the Congress and the Hindu Mahasabha.\n\nAlthough there were and continue to be disagreements on the interpretation of the resolution, it was widely accepted that it called for a separate Muslim state. Opposing opinions focus on the phrase \"independent states\" claiming this means Muslim majority provinces, i.e. Punjab, Sindh, etc. would be independent of each other. They ignore the phrase \"geographically contiguous units.\" They also rely on the claims of certain Bengali nationalists who did not agree with one state. They accuse their opponents of diverting the \"spirit\" of the resolution.\n\nThe majority of the Muslim League leadership contended that it was intended for not only the separation of India but into only 2 states (Muslim majority and Hindu majority). Therefore, it is indeed a statement calling for independence and one Muslim state. Eventually, the name \"Pakistan\" was used for the envisioned state.\n\nThe All India Azad Muslim Conference gathered in Delhi in April 1940 to voice its support for an independent and united India, in response to the Lahore Resolution. Its members included several Islamic organisations in India, as well as 1400 nationalist Muslim delegates. The pro-separatist All-India Muslim League worked to try to silence those nationalist Muslims who stood against the partition of India, often using \"intimidation and coercion\". The murder of the Chief Minister of Sind and All India Azad Muslim Conference leader Allah Bakhsh Soomro also made it easier for the All-India Muslim League to demand the creation of a Pakistan.\n\nThe Sindh assembly was the first British Indian legislature to pass the resolution in favour of Pakistan. G. M. Syed, an influential Sindhi activist, revolutionary and Sufi and later one of the important leaders in the forefront of the Sindh independence movement, joined the Muslim League in 1938 and presented the Pakistan resolution in the Sindh Assembly. A key motivating factor was the promise of \"autonomy and sovereignty for constituent units\".\n\nThis text was buried under the Minar-e-Pakistan during its building in the Ayub regime.\nIn this session the political situation was analysed in detail and Muslim demanded a separate homeland only to maintain their identification and to safeguard their rights. Pakistan resolution was the landmark in the history of Muslim of South-Asia. It determined for the Muslims a true goal and their homeland in north-east and north-west. The acceptance of the Pakistan resolution accelerated the pace of freedom movement. It gave new energy and courage to the Muslims who gathered around Muhammad Ali Jinnah for struggle for freedom.\n\n\n\n"}

At home, Buffy finds Spike waiting in front of her house. She knows what he's there for, but with Dawn waiting inside, she refuses to let him follow her into the house. He persuades her to stay outside with him instead.\n\nThe next day, Buffy learns that her application to re-enroll in UC Sunnydale has been rejected because she missed the deadline. At work, Buffy tends to the grill like a depressed robot, and so is sent up to the counter. Her first customer is unexpected: Riley.\n\nBuffy leaves her job to help Riley. They fight a monster on the streets of Sunnydale, but it escapes. Riley and Buffy pursue in his car. A brief interlude shows Xander and Anya having a spat while sitting in traffic. At a dam, Riley and Buffy have further battles and lose the demon yet again. Buffy meets Riley's wife, Sam.\n\nSam quickly jumps into a fight with the Suvolte demon. Buffy recovers from the shock of Riley being married and Riley catches her up on his life since he left. The demon strikes Sam and Riley rushes to help her as Buffy approaches the demon from behind and snaps its neck. Riley's shocked that she killed it and Buffy soon finds out from Sam that they weren't trying to kill it. Improvising, Sam takes a knife from Riley and cuts into the demon's gut as Buffy watches on, still confused. Sam observes that they're too late and the three head for Buffy's home where it should be safe. Riley mentions that Sam's cutting skills are good because she's a doctor and promises Buffy that he'll take the time to fill her in on everything.\n\nAt the house, almost everyone greets Riley with open arms; Dawn is still angry over his sudden departure a year ago. Sam and Riley begin to describe the gory details of the demon and the mission; although Riley is concerned about letting Dawn hear about it, Sam sticks up for the teen and she gets to stay with the \"grownups\". Sam explains that the Suvolte demon, which multiplies quickly and can destroy towns full of people in no time, has come to the Hellmouth to lay a nest full of its offspring. A demonic dealer in Sunnydale by the name of \"The Doctor\" is suspected of holding the eggs for a fee.\n\nBuffy suggests they split up and as Sam heads off to find Riley, Buffy aims directly for Spike's crypt. Upon arrival, she questions him about \"The Doctor,\" but when he has no immediate answers, she changes the subject to his feelings for her and eventually pulls him to her for some physical comfort. Later that evening, Buffy and Spike sleep under a blanket together and Spike wakes to find Riley has walked in on them. Riley then accuses Spike of being \"The Doctor\" and demands to know where the eggs are. Spike tries to explain that he's holding the eggs for a friend (which explains Spike's ignorance about how dangerous the eggs are without refrigeration.)\n\nThe whole gang gathers to say goodbye to Sam and Riley. While Riley describes to Xander where and how his wedding took place, Sam and Willow confirm that they have each other's e-mail addresses for future contact. A helicopter arrives and carries the couple off into the night. The next day, Buffy finds Spike at his crypt. She tells Spike that she is not going to go into the wrongness of dealing with the Suvolte eggs because, as he said, that's just who he is. Instead she has come to tell him that although she wants him, she can never love him so it would be wrong to keep using him the way she has been, so it is over. Spike thinks that this is her usual routine of playing hard to get, but Buffy is serious and walks out with a final goodbye.\n\nThe A.V. Club called this \"one of the most entertaining—and unexpectedly emotional—Buffy episodes in a good long while,\" noting that Riley appears \"as a stark reminder of what Buffy's missing in her life at this moment, and as a catalyst for change.\" TheTVCritic.org noted that it succeeded to hit the emotional points it was aiming for, and particularly praised Riley's speech about how great Buffy is.\n\nThe website Critically Touched awards a rating of 73 out of 100 (C+), arguing that the episode is \"unbelievably hokey and silly\" because of the \"apparent marriage/military bliss\" of Riley and Sam, but concludes that \"this is an episode that has a few irritating missteps, but, despite itself, manages to pull itself into a really worthwhile episode containing some fabulous, character-altering moments. This entire season has struggled with its plots, but the character material still shines through brightly.\"\n\nCritically Touched and the website The Buffy Phenomenon see this episode as a turning point in Buffy's life:\n\nThe Buffy Phenomenon said more bluntly, \"Now that the worst episode of the sixth season has aired, it is all uphill from here.\"\n\n"}

The terms are commonly used in the British education system and in private schools throughout the Commonwealth organisations. Head boys and head girls represent them in front of students and teachers.\n\nIn some British schools, the pupil body elects a head boy and/or a head girl from the pupils/students. Head boys and head girls are usually responsible for representing the school at events, and therefore must be able to make public speeches. They also serve as a good role model for students, and share pupils' ideas with the school's leadership. They may also be expected to lead fellow prefects in their duties. Deputy head boys and girls may also be appointed, taking on the day-to-day management of the prefects in some institutions, as well as looking after the school and creating a link between teachers and pupils. Some schools in the UK have abolished the titles of head boy and head girl entirely, and replaced them with a single role of \"head pupil\".\n\nThe process of selection of a head boy and/or a head girl varies according to school. At most, the student body of the school will have to vote for the heads. The votes would then inform the Heads of School's decisions. This is often preceded with an interview (and more currently an action plan for the academic year).\n\nSome schools in Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore, UAE and Malaysia, and many in the Commonwealth Caribbean, as well as South Africa, New Zealand and Canada, follow the same system as that in the United Kingdom, having a head girl and head boy or head prefect, a vice-head girl/boy, prefects, house captains, monitors and class representatives. The head girl and boy assist the teachers and administration of the school. Nigerian and Ghanaian schools follow a similar system although some schools appoint a head prefect or senior prefect and assistant senior prefect. Another term used is \"Senior Ring\" (for boys) and \"Senior Pin\" (for girls), which is used in some schools such as Aden Bowman Collegiate in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.\n\nIn Australia, the system is much the same as that of the United Kingdom. Almost all public secondary schools will have a student council with each year group having elected representatives. The head boy and head girl are generally the \"chair\" of this council and will represent the school on a government or community level and will represent the students at the school level.\n\nClass president is a similar position; these are commonly found in high school and secondary schools in the United States and Canada and may or may not necessarily be gender-specific.\n\n\n"}

He was known as \"\"Ireland's Golden Tenor\"\".\n\nPatterson was born in Clonmel, County Tipperary on 5 October 1938. As a boy he performed with his local parish choir and was involved in maintaining the annual tradition of singing with the \"Wrenboys\". Frank received special encouragement from local connoisseur Tommy O'Brien after a Highschool performance as Lazarello in Maritana. He sang in the local St. Mary's Choral Society and at a production of \"The Pirates of Penzance\" performed with both his parents. Frank's interests extended beyond music and as a boy he represented Marlfield GAA hurling club, played tennis at Hillview and golf at the Mountain Road course. He quit school at an early stage to work at 'Slater's', the printing business of his mother's family. Patterson moved to Dublin in 1961 to enrol at the National Academy of Theatre and Allied Arts where he studied acting while at the same time receiving vocal training from Dr. Hans Waldemar Rosen. In 1964 he entered the Feis Ceoil, a nationwide music competition in which he won several sections including Oratorio, Lieder and the German Gold Cup.\n\nPatterson gave classical recitals around Ireland and won scholarships to study in London, Paris and in the Netherlands. While in Paris, he appeared in a radio broadcast which caught the attention of the Philips Record Company. This led to a contract and his first record, \"My Dear Native Land\".\nHe worked with conductors such as Sir Colin Davis and some of the most prestigious orchestras in Europe including the London Symphony Orchestra and Orchestre de Paris. He also toured with Janine Micheau in Pelléas et Mélisande and won a reputation as a singer of Handel, Mozart, and Bach oratorios and German, Italian and French song. Patterson had a long-running programme on RTÉ, the Irish national broadcaster, titled \"For Your Pleasure\".\n\nIn the early 1980s he moved to the United States, making his home in rural Westchester County, New York. A resurgence of interest in Irish culture encouraged him to turn towards a more traditional Irish repertoire. Adding hymns, ballads, and traditional as well as more popular tunes to his catalogue he became a popular singer in a country with a strong Irish connection and in March 1988 was featured host in a St. Patrick's Day celebration of music and dance at New York's famous Radio City Music Hall.\n\nHe gave an outdoor performance on the steps of the Capitol in Washington with the National Symphony Orchestra before an audience of 60,000. Patterson was equally at home in more intimate settings, such as a concert he gave for Boys' Town.\nHis singing in the role of the Evangelist in Bach's \"St. John Passion\" was given fine reviews. Further recordings followed, of Beethoven arrangements, Irish songs, Berlioz songs, Purcell songs and others, all on the Philips label.\n\nFrank Patterson performed sell-out concerts from London's Royal Albert Hall to New York's Carnegie Hall, and with his family he presented two concerts at the White House, for presidents Ronald Reagan in 1982 and Bill Clinton in 1995.\nHe recorded over thirty albums in six languages, won silver, gold and platinum discs and was the first Irish singer to host his own show in Radio City Music Hall in New York.\n\nRising to greater prominence with the new popularity of Celtic music in the 1990s, Patterson saw many of his past recordings reissued for American audiences, and in 1998 he starred in the PBS special 'Ireland in Song'. His last album outsold Pavarotti.\n\nIn recognition of his musical achievements he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Salve Regina University, Newport in 1990 an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Manhattan College in 1996 and the Gold Medal of the Éire Society of Boston in 1998.\n\nPatterson appeared in several films, starting with \"The Dead\" (1987), an adaptation of a story by James Joyce, which was directed by John Huston and starred his daughter Anjelica Huston. Patterson played Bartell D'Arcy, the character who sings \"The Lass of Aughrim\".\n\nPatterson is heard twice in the Coen brothers film \"Millers Crossing\" (1990), in which he sings both \"Danny Boy\" and \"Goodnight Sweetheart\". In 1996 he appeared as \"Tenor in Restaurant\" in Neil Jordan's \"Michael Collins\", singing \"Macushla\". A recording of him singing the Irish traditional \"Dan Tucker\" also appeared in Martin Scorsese's \"Gangs of New York\" (2002).\n\nPatterson was a devout Catholic, and in 1979 sang at the Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II in Dublin's Phoenix Park before a congregation of almost a million people. In 1984 he was awarded the Knighthood of St. Gregory by the Pope. He was also a Knight of Malta and a Knight Commander of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem. While many of his Irish songs were quite sentimental, he did not indulge in strongly nationalistic themes and the first funds raised for the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation in the early 1970s were takings from a concert he gave in the Rupert Guinness Hall. Later, he continued to donate to the Centre from performances by him at the National Concert Hall in Dublin.\n\nPatterson was one of various artists (including the Monks of Glenstal Abbey, the RTÉ Philharmonic Choir, and the Dublin Philharmonic Orchestra) to create the \"Faith of Our Fathers\" album, which topped the Irish Albums Chart for two months in 1996.\n\nIn 1999, he learned he had a brain tumour. He had several operations in the following year and his condition appeared to have stabilised. Cardinal O'Connor, in his personal funeral plan, had requested that Frank Patterson sing \"Ave Maria\" at his funeral. , Patterson was diagnosed with a recurrence of his illness on May 7, 2000 and he cancelled his appearance at the Cardinal's funeral on the following morning, May 8. Following the Cardinals's funeral Patterson briefly recuperated and resumed performing. Patterson's last performance was on June 4, 2000, at Regis College in Weston, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. Shortly thereafter he was admitted to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center where he lapsed into a coma and died at the age of 61.\n\nAt his death accolades and tributes came from, among others, President of Ireland Mary McAleese, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and Opposition leader John Bruton who said he had \"\"the purest voice of his generation\".\" He was survived by his wife, the concert pianist Eily O'Grady, their son Eanan, a violinist with whom he frequently performed, and by his sister Imelda Malone and brothers Noel and Maurice.\n\nIn December 2005 Lisa Marie Presley attended a celebrity wedding in County Tipperary, and while there made a detour to place flowers on Patterson's grave as a tribute from the Presley family, impressed by Patterson's interpretations of songs later performed by Elvis.\n\"\"You'll come and find the place where I am lying,\"\n\"And kneel and say an Ave there for me;\"\n\"And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,\"\n\"And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,\"\n\"For you will bend and tell me that you love me,\"\n\"And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me.\"\"\nIn February 2002. an independent film-maker, Johnny Watts, met Eily Patterson on Staten Island, New York . This meeting resulted in 'The Tribute in Song', a series of three one-hour programmes featuring Patterson's music to commemorate those killed in Manhattan in 9/11 which also became a moving tribute to Frank Patterson himself. In September 2008, Watts personally presented to the Irish Consulate in New York City, a plaque that honoured Frank Patterson's contribution to 'Tribute in Song'. It was intended that the plaque would be returned to Patterson's native Clonmel.\n\nA bronze life-size piece by sculptor Jerry McKenna from Texas, titled \"The Golden Tenor Statue\", was unveiled to his memory in Mick Delahunty Square, Clonmel, in June 2002.\n\n\n"}

He had two siblings, Vincent and Jo-Ann. After his abusive alcoholic father died when Edd was thirteen, he dropped his last name in favor of \"Byrnes\" based on the name of his maternal grandfather, Edward Byrne, a fireman.\n\nByrnes developed the urge to act at high school but did not seriously consider pursuing it until after he had tried a number of other jobs, such as: driving an ambulance, roofing and selling flowers. At seventeen, he found work as a photographer's model; this led to an introduction to prostitution. In his memoirs, he described this as a \"strange \nworld... Art, wealth, sadism, limousines, sex for money, theater and fine restaurants.”\n\nIn 1956, Byrnes got an unpaid job in a summer stock theatre company in Connecticut, the Litchfield Community Playhouse. He soon began appearing in the company's plays as an actor; he also tried to get roles in Broadway theatre productions, but had no luck. Also that year, he was cast in an episode of the \"Crossroads\" TV program. Byrnes also appeared in episodes of the late-50s series \"Wire Service\" and \"Navy Log\".\n\nAfter a year, Byrnes moved to Hollywood. He appeared in a local stage production of \"Tea and Sympathy\". Byrnes also appeared in episodes of \"The Adventures of Jim Bowie\", and \"Telephone Time\" and in the film \"Fear Strikes Out\" (1957). Byrnes was third-billed in the film \"Reform School Girl\" (1957) for American International Pictures; that same year, he had a supporting role in the Warner Bros. film \"Johnny Trouble\".\n\nAlso in 1957, Byrnes signed a three-year contract with John Carroll of Clarion Pictures.\n\nByrnes tested for roles in the films \"Bernardine\" and \"Until They Sail\" but was unsuccessful. He did, however, guest star on an episode of \"Cheyenne\" made by Warner Bros., and a contemporary report described him as \"a Tab Hunter type.\" . The studio liked Byrnes' work and signed him to a long term contract in May 1957.\n\nWarners started off Byrnes' contract by assigning him to a comic role in \"The Deep Six\" (1958). He also appeared in episodes of \"Cheyenne\", \"\" and \"Colt .45\". In 1958 he appeared (credited as Edward Byrnes) as Benji Danton on \"Cheyenne\" in the episode titled \"The Last Comanchero.\"\n\nWhen Tab Hunter refused a role in the film \"Darby's Rangers\" (1958), Byrnes stepped in instead. He was wanted for \"Baby Face Nelson\" (1957), but Warners would not loan him out.\n\nByrnes also appeared in \"Marjorie Morningstar\" (1958) and \"Life Begins at 17\" (1958). He appeared as a guest star in \"Maverick\", \"The Deputy\", and \"Sugarfoot\", in the latter with John Russell, Rodolfo Hoyos, Jr., and Will Wright in the 1958 season-premiere episode \"Ring of Sand.\" He was in another war film titled \"Up Periscope\" (1959).\n\nByrnes was cast in \"Girl on the Run\", a pilot for a detective show starring Efrem Zimbalist Jr. Byrnes played contract killer Kenneth Smiley, who continually combed his hair – Byrnes said this was an idea of his which the director liked and kept in. Around this time Byrnes decided to change his acting name from \"Edward\" to \"Edd\". \"I just dreamed it up one day,\" he said. \"Edward is too formal and there are lots of Eddies.\"\n\nThe show aired in October 1958 and was so popular Warners decided to turn it into a TV series: \"77 Sunset Strip\". Byrnes' character became an immediate national teen sensation, prompting the producers to make Byrnes a regular cast member. They transformed Kookie from a hitman into a parking valet at Dino's Lodge who helped as a private investigator. Zimbalist Jr. explained the situation to the audience:\nKookie's recurring character—a different, exciting look that teens of the day related to—was the valet-parking attendant who constantly combed his piled-high, greasy-styled teen hair, often in a windbreaker jacket, and who worked part-time at the so-called Dean Martin's Dino's Lodge restaurant, next door to a private-investigator agency at 77 Sunset Strip in West Hollywood. Kookie frequently acted as an unlicensed, protégé detective who helped the private eyes (Zimbalist and Roger Smith) on their cases, based upon \"the word\" heard from Kookie's street informants. Kookie called everybody \"Dad\" (as in \"Sure thing . . . Dad\") and was television's homage to the \"Jack Kerouac\" style of cult-hipster of the late 1950s.\n\nThe show became the most popular one in the country. To the thrill of teen viewers, Kookie spoke a jive-talk \"code\" to everyone, whether you understood him or not, and Kookie knew, better than others, \"the word on the street.\" Although the Kookie character was at least several years older than Jim Stark, James Dean's character in the film \"Rebel Without a Cause\", Byrnes exuded a similar sense of cool. Kookie was also the progenitor of Henry Winkler's The Fonz character of the \"Happy Days\" series (switch hot rod for motorcycle; same hair and comb). By April 1959, Byrnes was among the most popular young actors in the country.\n\n\"I was a nobody,\" said Byrnes. \"Now I'm dragging in over 400 letters a week and I'm a name.\"\n\nKookie's constant onscreen tending of his ducktail haircut led to many jokes among comedians of the time, and it resulted in the 1959-charted (13 weeks) 'rap' style recording, \"Kookie, Kookie (Lend Me Your Comb)\", recorded with actress and recording artist Connie Stevens, and which reached #4 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. The song also appeared on the Edd Byrnes album, entitled (what else) \"Kookie\". He and Stevens appeared together on ABC's \"The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom.\" During the run of \"77 Sunset Strip\", Byrnes, as the \"Kookie\" character, was a popular celebrity, and Byrnes received fan-mail that reached 15,000 letters a week, according to \"Picture Magazine\" in 1961; this rivalled most early rock recording-stars of the day.\n\nWarners put him in the second lead of a Western, \"Yellowstone Kelly\" (1959), supporting Clint Walker, star of another Warners show, \"Cheyenne\"; it was a minor success at the box office.\n\n\"I'm not studying,\" said Byrnes at the time. \"Why should I? I get all my experience in front of the camera. You get in front of the camera every day and you've got to learn.\"\n\nByrnes walked off the show in the second season, demanding a bigger part and higher pay. In November 1959, Warners put him on suspension. They eventually offered $750 a week but he refused. In April 1960, they came to terms and Byrnes went back to work.\n\nOwing to restrictions in his Warner Brothers television contract, Byrnes was forced to turn down film roles in \"Ocean's Eleven\" (1960); \"Rio Bravo\" (1959); \"North to Alaska\" (1960) and \"The Longest Day\" (1962). He tested for the role of John F. Kennedy in \"PT 109\", but President Kennedy preferred Cliff Robertson.; instead of making that movie, he guest starred on \"Lawman\". \n\nByrnes made a cameo as Kookie in \"Surfside Six\" and \"Hawaiian Eye\", a \"77 Sunset Strip\" spin-off. He bought a story for Warners, \"Make Mine Vanilla\", but it was not made. He threatened to punch a photographer who was trying to take a photo of him getting a marriage license. He did some summer stock in 1962 with his wife.\n\nAlthough Byrnes was a popular celebrity, the years of unfortunate \"Kookie\" typecasting led him to ultimately buy out his television contract with Warner Brothers to clear his way for films—though it was accomplished too late to allow Byrnes to capitalize on feature-length cinema projects based upon his established television-series fame.\n\nIn August 1963 Byrnes bought up the remaining ten months of his contract with Warner Bros. and left \"Sunset Strip\". \"No more hipster image for me,\" said Byrnes. \"From now on I'd like to establish myself as a movie star.\"\n\nByrnes appeared in episodes of \"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour\"; \"Burke's Law\" and \"Kraft Suspense Theatre\". He travelled to Yugoslavia where he was one of several names in Roger Corman's war film \"The Secret Invasion\" (1964). While in Europe he signed to do a TV show in Munich.\n\nBack in the US, he made a pilot for a TV series, \"Kissin' Cousins\", based on the Elvis Presley film \"Kissin' Cousins\" (1964), with Byrnes taking the part of the lieutenant played by Presley in the film; it did not go to series. Byrnes starred in a beach party movie financed by Corman, \"Beach Ball\" (1965). While working on \"Beach Ball\" with Byrnes, Chris Noel complained about his behavior. He was in episodes of \"Mister Roberts\"; \"Honey West\" and \"Theatre of Stars\", and did \"Picnic\"; \"Bus Stop\"; \"Sunday in New York\"; \"Sweet Bird of Youth\" and \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" on stage in stock.\n\nThe shadow of Kookie hung over him. \"People think that's the only role you can play,\" he said in 1966. \"Producers and directors still think of me as the kid I played on the Strip. I've been offered other series but they've still wanted to cast me as the same kid.\"\n\nByrnes returned to Europe for several spaghetti westerns, which included the 1967 films \"Renegade Riders\"; \"Any Gun Can Play\" and \"Red Blood, Yellow Gold\". In 1969 he said he made more money in the preceding year than in his entire time at Warner Bros.\n\nBack in the US he worked mostly in TV; this included episodes of \"Mannix\"; \"Love, American Style\"; \"The Virginian\"; \"Adam-12\" and \"Pathfinders\". He was also in the TV movies \"The Silent Gun\" (1969) and \"The Gift of Terror\" (1973).\nByrnes was in the \"Duo-Vision\" horror film \"Wicked, Wicked\" in 1973 and played a TV interviewer in the David Essex film \"Stardust\" (1974).\n\nIn 1974, Byrnes hosted the pilot of \"Wheel of Fortune\" but NBC chose Chuck Woolery instead.\n\nHe was a guest star in \"Marcus Welby, MD\"; \"Thriller\"; \"Police Story\"; \"Police Woman\" and \"Sword of Justice\"; and was also in the TV movies \"Mobile Two\" (1975) and \"Telethon\" (1977).\n\nByrnes played the role of the Dick Clark-like dance-show host Vince Fontaine, host of \"National Bandstand\", in the 1978 movie \"Grease\".\n\nThe success of the film led to Byrnes being cast in the lead of a TV series \"$weepstake$\" but it only lasted nine episodes. He went back to guest starring in shows like \"CHiPs\"; \n\"B.J. and the Bear\"; \"House Calls\"; \"Charlie's Angels\"; \"Vega$\"; \"The Love Boat\"; \"Fantasy Island\"; \"Quincy M.E.\"; \"The Master\"; \"Simon & Simon\" and \"Crazy Like a Fox\". He had a small role in the Erin Moran TV film \"Twirl\" (1981) and the lead in \"Erotic Images\" (1983) with Britt Ekland.\n\nByrnes also appeared in \"Mankillers\" (1987); \"Back to the Beach\" (1987); \"Party Line\" (1988) and \"Troop Beverly Hills\" (1989).\n\nLater appearances included parts in: \"Throb\"; \"Unhappily Ever After\"; \"Rags to Riches\"; \"Mr. Belvedere\"; \"Empty Nest\"; \"Married... with Children\"; \"Burke's Law\" (the revival); \"\" and \"Murder, She Wrote\".\n\nOne of his final TV roles was in \"\" (1999).\n\nByrnes' son by Asa Maynor is Logan Byrnes, a television news anchor for KUSI-TV News in San Diego, California, since 2018, after performing the same duty at KTTV in Los Angeles. Before 2016 he was at Fox Connecticut from 2008.\n\nByrnes died of natural causes on January 8, 2020, at his Santa Monica home.\n\nAs a tribute to his enduring celebrity and his iconic \"Kookie\" character, Byrnes has ranked #5 in \"TV Guide's\" list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols\" (23 January 2005). In 1996, he wrote an autobiography with Marshall Terrill entitled \"Kookie No More\".\n\nByrnes appeared during the Memphis Film Festival in June 2014; he was reunited with his former \"Yellowstone Kelly\" co-star Clint Walker.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2323045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323045", "title": "Cinema of Africa", "text": "Cinema of Africa\n\nAfrican cinema is film production in Africa. It dates back to the early 20th century, when film reels were the primary cinematic technology in use. During the colonial era, African life was shown only by the work of white, colonial, Western filmmakers, who depicted blacks in a negative fashion, as exotic \"others\". There is no one single African cinema; there are differences between North African and Sub-Saharan cinema, and between the cinemas of different countries.\n\nThe cinema of Egypt is one of the oldest in the world. Auguste and Louis Lumière screened their films in Alexandria and Cairo in 1896 and the first short documentary was filmed by Egyptians in 1907. In 1935 the studio in Cairo began producing mostly formulaic comedies and musicals, but also films like Kamal Selim's The Will (1939). Egyptian cinema flourished in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, considered its golden age. Youssef Chahine's seminal \"Cairo Station\" (1958) foreshadowed Hitchcock's Psycho, and laid a foundation for Arab film.\n\nThe Nigerian film industry is the largest in Africa in terms of value, number of annual films, revenue and popularity. It is also the second largest film producer in the world. In 2016 Nigeria's film industry contributed 2.3% of its gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nDuring the colonial era, Africa was represented exclusively by Western filmmakers. In the first decades of the twentieth century, Western filmmakers made films that depicted black Africans as \"exoticized\", \"submissive workers\" or as \"savage or cannibalistic\". For example, see \"Kings of the Cannibal Islands\" in 1909, \"Voodoo Vengeance\" (1913) and \"Congorilla\" (1932). Colonial era films portrayed Africa as exotic, without history or culture. Examples abound and include jungle epics based on the Tarzan character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs and the adventure film \"The African Queen\" (1951), and various adaptations of H. Rider Haggard's novel \"King Solomon's Mines\" (1885). Much early ethnography \"focused on highlighting the differences between indigenous people and the white civilised man, thus reinforcing colonial propaganda\". Marc Allégret's first film,\"Voyage au Congo\" (1927) respectfully portrayed the Masa people, in particular a young African entertaining his little brother with a baby crocodile on a string. Yet the Africans were portrayed as human but not equals; a dialogue card for example referred to the movements of a traditional dance as naive. His lover, writer André Gide, accompanied Allégret and wrote a book also titled \"Voyage au Congo\". Allégret later made \"Zouzou\", starring Josephine Baker, the first major film starring a black woman. Baker had caused a sensation in the Paris arts scene by dancing in the clad only in a string of bananas.\n\nIn the French colonies Africans were prohibited by the 1934 Laval Decree from making films of their own. The ban stunted the growth of film as a means of African expression, political, cultural, and artistic. Congolese Albert Mongita did make \"The Cinema Lesson\" in 1951 and in 1953 Mamadou Touré made \"Mouramani\" based on a folk story about a man and his dog. In 1955, Paulin Soumanou Vieyra originally from Benin, but educated in Senegal along with his colleagues from Le Group Africain du Cinema, shot a short film in Paris, \"Afrique-sur-Seine\" (1955). Vieyra was trained in filmmaking at the Institut des hautes études cinématographiques (IDHEC) in Paris, and despite the ban on filmmaking in Africa, was granted permission to make a film in France. Considered the first film directed by a black African, \"Afrique Sur Seine\" explores the difficulties of being an African in 1950s France.\n\nPortuguese colonies came to independence with no film production facilities at all, since the colonial government there restricted film-making to colonialist propaganda, emphasizing the inferiority of indigenous populations. Therefore, little thought was given until independence to developing authentic African voices.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, the Bantu Educational Kinema Experiment was conducted in an attempt to \"educate the Bantu, mostly about hygiene. Only three films from this project survive; they are kept at the British Film Institute.\n\nBefore the colonies' independence, few anti-colonial films were produced. Examples included Statues Also Die (\"Les statues meurent aussi\") by Chris Marker and Alain Resnais, about European theft of African art. The second part of this film was for 10 years banned in France.) \"Afrique 50\" by René Vautier, showed anti-colonial riots in Côte d'Ivoire and in Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso).\n\nAlso doing film work in Africa at this time was French ethnographic filmmaker Jean Rouch, controversial with both French and African audiences. Film documentaries such as \"Jaguar\" (1955), \"Les maitres fous\" (1955), \"Moi, un noir\" (1958) and \"La pyramide humaine\" (1959). Rouch's documentaries were not explicitly anti-colonial, but did challenge perceptions of colonial Africa and give a new voice to Africans. Although Rouch was accused by Ousmane Sembene and others of seeing Africans \"as if they are insects,\" Rouch was an important figure in the developing field of African film and was the first person to work with Africans, of whom many had important careers in African cinema (Oumarou Ganda, Safi Faye and Moustapha Alassane, and others).\n\nBecause most films made prior to independence were egregiously racist in nature, African filmmakers of the independence era such as Ousmane Sembene and Oumarou Ganda, among others saw filmmaking as an important political tool for rectifying the erroneous image of Africans put forward by Western filmmakers and for reclaiming the image of Africa for Africans.\n\nThe first African film to win international recognition was Sembène Ousmane's \"La Noire de...\" also known as \"Black Girl\". It showed the despair of an African woman who has to work as a maid in France. It won the Prix Jean Vigo in 1966. Initially a writer, Sembène had turned to cinema to reach a wider audience. He is still considered the \"father of African cinema\". Sembène's native Senegal continued to be the most important place of African film production for more than a decade.\n\nWith the creation of the African film festival FESPACO in Burkina Faso in 1969, African film created its own forum. FESPACO now takes place every two years in alternation with the Carthago film festival in Tunisia.\n\nThe Pan African Federation of Filmmakers (Fédération Panafricaine des Cinéastes, or FEPACI) was formed in 1969 to promote African film industries in terms of production, distribution and exhibition. From its inception, FEPACI was seen as a critical partner organization to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), now the African Union. FEPACI looks at the role of film in the politico-economic and cultural development of African states and the continent as a whole.\n\nMed Hondo's \"Soleil O\", shot in 1969, was immediately recognized. No less politically engaged than Sembène, he chose a more controversial filmic language to show what it means to be a stranger in France with the \"wrong\" skin colour.\n\nSouleymane Cissé's \"Yeelen\" (Mali, 1987) was the first film made by a Black African to compete at Cannes. Cheick Oumar Sissoko's \"Guimba\" (Mali, 1995) was also well received in the west.\n\nMany films of the 1990s, including \"Quartier Mozart\" by Jean-Pierre Bekolo (Cameroon, 1992), are situated in the globalized African metropolis.\n\nNigerian cinema experienced a large growth in the 1990s with the increasing availability of home video cameras in Nigeria, and soon put Nollywood in the nexus for West African English-language films. Nollywood produced 1844 movies in 2013 alone.\n\nThe last movie theatre in Kinshasa shut down in 2004. Many of the former cinemas were converted to churches. In 2009 the UN refugee agency screened \"Breaking the Silence\" in South Kivu and Katanga Province. The film deals with rape in the Congolese civil wars.\n\nHowever a 200-seat cinema, MTS Movies House, opened in 2016 in Brazzaville. In April 2018, construction began on a new cinema in Brazzaville.\n\nA first African Film Summit took place in South Africa in 2006. It was followed by FEPACI 9th Congress.\n\nThe African Movie Academy Awards were launched in 2004, marking the growth of local film industries like that of Nigeria as well as the development and spread of the film industry culture in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nContemporary African cinema deals with a wide variety of themes relating to modern issues and universal problems.\n\nMigration and relations between African and European countries is a common theme among many African films. Abderrahmane Sissako's film \"Waiting for Happiness\" portrays a Mauritanian city struggling against foreign influences through the journey of a migrant coming home from Europe. Migration is also an important theme in Mahamat Saleh Haroun's film \"Une Saison en France,\" which shows the journey of a family from the Central African Republic seeking asylum in France. Haroun is part of the Chadian diaspora in France, and uses the film to explore aspects of this diasporan experience.\n\nAfrofuturism is a growing genre, encompassing Africans both on the continent and in the diaspora who tell science or speculative fiction stories involving Africa and African people. Neill Blomkamp's \"District 9\" is a well-known example, portraying an alien invasion of South Africa. Wanuri Kahiu's short film \"Pumzi\" portrays the futuristic fictional Maitu community in Africa 35 years after World War III.\n\nDirectors including Haroun and Kahiu have expressed concerns about the lack of cinema infrastructure and appreciation in various African countries. However, organizations such as the Changamoto arts fund are providing more resources and opportunities to African filmmakers.\n\nSome African countries suffer a lack of freedom of speech, that undermine the film industry. This is specially severe in Equatorial Guinea. The feature film \"The Writer From a Writer From a Country Without Bookstores\" is the first to be shot in the country and critic with Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo's dictatorship, one of the longest lasting in the world.\n\nAfrican cinema, like cinema in other world regions, covers a wide variety of topics. In Algiers in 1975, the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers (FEPACI) adopted the Charte du cinéaste africain (Charter of the African cinéaste), which recognized the importance of postcolonial and neocolonial realities in African cinema. The filmmakers start by recalling the neocolonial condition of African societies. \"The situation contemporary African societies live in is one in which they are dominated on several levels: politically, economically and culturally.\" African filmmakers stressed their solidarity with progressive filmmakers in other parts of the world. African cinema is often seen a part of Third Cinema.\n\nSome African filmmakers, for example Ousmane Sembène, try to give African history back to African people by remembering the resistance to European and Islamic domination.\n\nThe African filmmaker is often compared to the traditional griot. Like griots, filmmakers' task is to express and reflect communal experiences. Patterns of African oral literature often recur in African films. African film has also been influenced by traditions from other continents, such as Italian neorealism, Brazilian Cinema Novo and the theatre of Bertolt Brecht.\n\nIn Mauritania CINEPARC RIBAT AL BAHR is an open air Drive-in Cinema located in Nouakchott, the only one of its kind in Africa. In addition to the projection schedule, the drive-in have a new application iOS and Android provides you with the biggest international movie database in which you can find information such as plot summaries, cast members, production crews, critics reviews, ratings, fan trivia, and much more about movies, series, and all cinematic work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognised as one of the pioneers of Senegalese cinema as well as cinema developed on the African continent at large, ethnologist and filmmaker Safi Faye was the first African woman film director to gain international recognition. Faye's first film La Passante (The Passerby) was released in 1972 and following this, Kaddu Beykat (Letter from My Village), the filmmaker's first feature film was released in 1975. Faye continued to be active with several released works in the latter half of the 1970s all the way through her latest work, the 1996 drama film Mossane.\n\nSarah Maldoror, a French filmmaker and the daughter of immigrants from Guadaloupe has been recognised as one of the pioneers of African cinema in the diaspora. She is the founder of Les Griots (The Troubadours), the first drama company in France made for actors of African and Afro-Caribbean descent. Originally in the theatre, she went on to study filmmaking at the State Institute of Cinematography of the Russian Federation (VGIK), in Moscow. In 1972, Maldoror shot her film \"Sambizanga\" about the 1961–74 war in Angola. Surviving African women of this war are the subject of the documentary \"Les Oubliées\" (The forgotten women), made by Anne-Laure Folly 20 years later. Maldoror also worked as assistant director on The Battle of Algiers (1966) with filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo.\n\nIn 1995, Wanjiru Kinyanjui made the feature film \"The Battle of the Sacred Tree\" in Kenya.\n\nIn 2008, Manouchka Kelly Labouba became the first woman in the history of Gabonese cinema to direct a fictional film. Her short film \"Le Divorce\" addresses the impact of modern and traditional values on the divorce of a young Gabonese couple.\n\nKemi Adetiba, hitherto a music video director, made her directorial debut in 2016 with \"The Wedding Party\". The film, about the events involved in the celebration of an aristocratic wedding, would go on to become the most successful Nollywood film in the history of her native Nigeria.\n\nWanuri Kahiu is a Kenyan film director, best known for her film \"From a Whisper,\" which was awarded Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Picture at the Africa Movie Academy Awards in 2009.. Nearly 10 years after the release of From a Whisper, Kahiu's film \"Rafiki\", a coming-of-age romantic drama about two teenage girls in the present-day Kenya. The film made headlines, partly for its selection at the Cannes Film Festival but also for its exploration of sexuality that did not sit well with the Kenyan government.\n\nRungano Nyoni, best known for the internationally acclaimed feature film \"I am Not a Witch\" is a Zambian-Welsh director and screenwriter. Born in Zambia and also raised in Wales, Nyoni went on to graduate from the University of Arts in London with a Master's in acting in 2009. Her filmography as a filmmaker (whether as a director or/and screenwriter) also include the short films: \"The List\" (2009, short), \"Mwansa The Great\" (2011, short), \"Listen\" (2014, short) and she was also one of the directors of the international film project \"Nordic Factory\" (2014). She has been awarded with a variety of awards including a BAFTA for outstanding debut by a British filmmaker for \"I am Not a Witch\".\n\nIn 2019, Azza Cheikh Malainine became the first woman in the history of Mauritania's cinema to direct a fictional film. Her film \"SOS\" addresses the impact of modern and Security in Mauritania.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2323047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323047", "title": "Bayan I", "text": "Bayan I\n\nBayan I reigned as the first khagan of the Avar Khaganate between 562 and 602.\n\nAs the Göktürk Empire expanded westwards on the Eurasian Steppe during the 6th century, peoples such as the Avars (also known as the \"Pseudo-Avars\", \"Obri\", \"Abaroi\" and \"Varchonites\") and the Bulgars migrated into Central Europe and the Balkans. Bayan I led the Avars (along with some Bulgars) into Pannonia, where they established their khaganate from 568.\n\nBy 562, the Avars and Bulgars had reached the Lower Danube: it was most likely in that year that Bayan became their supreme Khagan, as his predecessor, the Kutrigur khan Zabergan had died.\n\nAs allies of the Byzantine Empire (ruled at time by Justinian I), the Avars had obtained a grant of gold to crush other nomads — the Sabirs, Utigurs, Kutrigurs and Saragurs - in the lands later known as Ukraine, a task they accomplished to the emperor's satisfaction. Bayan's Avars now exacted the renewal of the alliance, increased pay and a land to live in.\n\nBayan had eyed the plain of Moesia, just south of the Lower Danube, what would become northern Bulgaria, as his promised land, but the Byzantines were adamant the Avars should not in any case cross the river. So Bayan and his horde in 563 rode around the northern Carpathians to Germany, where they were soundly stemmed along the river Elbe by the Frankish king Sigebert I of Austrasia. This defeat induced them to come back on their footsteps to the Lower Danube region. After vainly trying to force the Danubian border when the new Byzantine emperor Justin II denied them both entry and wage, the Avars renewed their ride to Thuringia. This time (566) they did defeat Sigebert, but had nonetheless to stop; in the meantime the Göktürks, in pursuit of their former subjects, remained a real danger.\n\nThe Avars, traditionally a nomadic people, desperately needed both shelter and pasture for their livestock, but the route to Pannonia was blocked by impassable mountains covered with thick forests: the Carpathian range. It was in the critical winter of 566-567 that the Avars, stuck in what is now eastern Germany, were sent feelers by Alboin, the strong ruler of the Lombards and brother-in-law of Sigebert, who sought an alliance to crush his old enemies the Gepids. These last ones, by chance, controlled the only practical way from the Lower Danube to the craved Pannonian pastures. So in 567 (see Lombard–Gepid War (567)) king Cunimund's Gepid kingdom was attacked by two directions: from the west came the Lombards, from the north, through Moravia and the Danube, the Avars. Bayan crushed Cunimund's forces and made a cup from his defeated enemy's skull as a present (and warning) for his ally Alboin (who is famously quoted as having forced Cunimond's daughter Rosamund, whom he had taken as war bride, to drink from it, sealing his own fate). Then the Avar horde marched against Sirmium, by now firmly held by Gepid remnants and a Byzantine garrison led by general Bonosus. In the meantime large numbers of Slavs settled in Pannonia in the wake of the Avars; and in 568 Alboin and his Lombards deemed it wise to move for the half-ruined but promising lands of Italy where they would establish a long-lasting kingdom. They concluded however a treaty with the Avar Khagan so as they could reenter parts of Pannonia and Noricum (Austria) if they chose so in the future, then departed with large numbers of the vanquished Gepids and a host of other Germanic tribes.\n\nAfter ten years of uneasy, undocumented peace, Bayan again marched against Sirmium, wresting it from Byzantine hands after a two-year siege, then took also Singidunum, evicting the Byzantines from the inner Balkans and opening the area to an unstoppable influx of Slavs, that in five years at most flooded all the semi-abandoned region down to the Peloponnesus. It was the year 582: Bayan was now able to attack the Byzantines in Thrace, and when Tiberius II Constantine, who had failed in stopping him, was succeeded in Constantinople by his son-in-law Maurice, he managed to extract a huge tribute in gold: 100,000 gold coins, or some 1,000 lbs, per year.\n\nIn later times Avars and Slavs still raided the remaining Byzantine lands as Maurice was hard pressed to defend his native Cappadocia and Armenia from the mighty Sassanians of Persia. By 592 the Byzantine ruler, once he defeated the Persian menace, was bent on revenge and counterattacked in full force, soon reverting the roles (see Maurice's Balkan campaigns). Repeated, massive defeats shook the Avaro-Slavic hordes as strong organized Byzantine armies penetrated north of the Danube into Wallachia, and eventually, under general Priscus, crushed the enemy along the river Tisza in the very heart of Pannonia. It was Phocas' rebellion against Maurice in 602 that ultimately saved the Avars. In the same year Khagan Bayan died, his empire now safe and firmly established.\n\n"}
{"id": "2323051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323051", "title": "Kniefall von Warschau", "text": "Kniefall von Warschau\n\nThe term Kniefall von Warschau, also referred to as Warschauer Kniefall, (both German for \"Warsaw genuflection\") refers to a gesture of humility and penance by West German Chancellor Willy Brandt towards the victims of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.\n\nThe event took place on December 7, 1970, in Warsaw, Poland (which was then part of the Eastern Bloc), during a visit to a monument to the German occupation-era Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. After laying a wreath, Brandt unexpectedly, and apparently spontaneously, knelt. He remained silently in that position for a short time (half a minute), surrounded by a large group of dignitaries and press photographers.\n\nBrandt had actively resisted the early Nazi regime, and had spent most of the time of Hitler's reign in exile. The occasion of Brandt's visit to Poland at the time was the signing of the Treaty of Warsaw between West Germany and Poland, guaranteeing German acceptance of the new borders of Poland. The treaty was one of the Brandt-initiated policy steps (the 'Ostpolitik') to ease tensions between West and East during the Cold War.\n\nOn the same day, Brandt signed the Treaty of Warsaw, which acknowledged the Oder–Neisse line as the final German border with Poland. Both actions attracted controversy within Germany, as did Ostpolitik in general, which was supported by only a narrow majority of the people and had opposition within Brandt's own party. Its voters had included a significant proportion of expellees from the formerly-German territories in Poland, most of whom left to support the conservative parties.\n\nAccording to a \"Der Spiegel\" survey of the time, 48% of all West Germans thought the \"Kniefall\" was excessive, 41% said it was appropriate and 11% had no opinion. The \"Kniefall\" was a symbolic action the opposition tried to use against Brandt, as in a constructive vote of no confidence in April 1972, which Brandt won by only two votes. Brandt's landslide win in the next elections, in late 1972, was also due to the growing view among voters that Brandt's Ostpolitik, symbolized by the \"Kniefall\", and his reformist domestic policies were helping to boost Germany's international reputation and so should be supported. His party won its best federal election result ever.\n\nWhile at the time, positive reactions may have been limited, his show of humility was a small but vital step in bridging the gaps World War II had left between Germany and Eastern Europe. In historical terms, Brandt gained much renown for this act, and it is thought to be one of the reasons he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971.\n\nA monument to Willy Brandt was unveiled on 6 December 2000, in Willy Brandt Square in Warsaw (near the Warsaw Ghetto Heroes Monument) on the eve of the 30th anniversary of his famous gesture.\n\nBrandt was repeatedly interviewed about the genuflection and about his motives. He later noted that:\n\nEgon Bahr, an eyewitness and Brandt's friend and political ally of many years, recalled in a 2010 interview: \"The only thing he said was, in that moment, as he stood looking at the ribbon, he thought: Just laying the wreath is not enough.\"\n\nDuring a visit to the former Seodaemun Prison in Seoul on August 2015, former Japanese prime minister Yukio Hatoyama knelt in front of a memorial stone as an expression of apology for Japanese war crimes in World War II.\n\n\n"}

An admiring press dubbed her the \"Princess of Song\", a nickname she later would use to publicize concert events. She was the star of the \"Philco Hour\" on NBC from 1927-30 (Dunning, p. 543). She became the star of the Cities Service Concerts program, which she joined in 1930. By 1935, a listeners' poll voted her radio's most popular female vocalist. (Fraser, B15) Dragonette sang in a segment of the film \"The Big Broadcast of 1936\", on the condition that she have authority over the final cut on her performance. In the end she chose to have her part removed. In 1934, she provided the voice of Persephone in the Silly Symphony cartoon \"The Goddess of Spring\". And in 1939, she provided the voice of \"Princess Glory\" in the full color animated motion picture \"Gulliver's Travels\".\n\nIn 1940, Swiss-American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862–1947) painted a portrait of her that now hangs at her alma mater, now known as Georgian Court University. Müller-Ury became a close friend of the singer and painted her portrait several times—the last of the portraits, painted in 1946, depicts her wearing a gold fez. He also painted a portrait of the singer's sister, Nadea, in 1942. During World War II, she performed for charities benefiting the U.S. armed services, earning her an honorary commission as a Colonel. She performed frequently for the troops and sold a record number of war bonds. She once remarked that \"The Star Spangled Banner\" never had more meaning for her than it did during the war. In addition to English, Jessica impeccably sang in German, French, Spanish, Italian and Russian. She was so good, she once fooled a diplomat into thinking Russian was her native tongue. Never one to use printed music, it’s estimated she memorized over 75 operas and more than 500 songs.\nIn the mid-1950s, David Gottlieb, the president of the leading pinball game manufacturer, hired Dragonette to appear at coin machine functions promoting a pinball game called Dragonette. However, the game had nothing to do with Dragonette. It was spoof of a leading TV show of the period, \"Dragnet\".\n\nOn June 28, 1947, she married Nicholas Meredith Turner (born October 28, 1915 - died March 8, 2010) at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York; both were devout Roman Catholics. The ceremony was performed by Cardinal Francis Spellman. The union, Dragonette's only marriage, was childless but happy, and lasted until her death.\n\nJessica Dragonette Turner died on March 18, 1980 from a fatal heart attack not long after being released from the hospital after suffering an asthma attack. Her immediate survivors were her husband and a younger sister (Mrs. Nadea Loftus). Her widower died in New York City on March 8, 2010.\n\nDragonette is interred in a crypt in Our Lady Queen of Peace Mausoleum at Gate of Heaven Cemetery, Hawthorne, New York.\n\n\n\n"}

In 2006, he moved to Copenhagen, and went on to win two Danish Superliga titles at the club. From 2008 to 2014 he played for Fulham, helping the team to the 2010 UEFA Europa League Final, but was released in 2014 after the club's relegation, subsequently joining Crystal Palace.\n\nHangeland played for the Norway national team between 2002 and 2014. He was the team captain from 2008 until his resignation, and in total he played 91 matches and scored 4 goals.\n\nThe son of a Norwegian oil company worker, Hangeland was born in Houston, Texas during his parents' two-year spell in the United States, but grew up in Stavanger. Since moving back to Stavanger, Hangeland said on America, quoting: \"\"We were there for a short period in 1980/81, which is when I was born and then we went back home, so obviously I don't remember too much about my time there!\"\" Hangeland arrived at Viking from local club FK Vidar at the start of the 2001 season. He helped win the Norwegian cup in his debut season, playing as a central defensive midfielder in the 3–0 victory over rivals Bryne FK in the final. In 2005, he was made captain of Viking. When he left Viking he had played a total of 187 games for the club.\n\nOn 16 January 2006 he signed a contract with the Danish club F.C. Copenhagen. The tall defender made an impact right from the start together with Danish captain Michael Gravgaard and the two defenders were feared. Because of their height and dominance when it came to headers, they were known as the \"Copenhagen Air Force\". With several great performances in the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League group stage Brede Hangeland was linked with numerous big clubs around Europe. During his time at Copenhagen, Hangeland won the Danish Superliga twice and the Royal League once. He played in 63 league games, scoring three times and total played over 100 games in the different tournaments.\n\nDuring the summer of 2007 newspapers linked him with Premier League clubs Newcastle United, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Manchester City. Hangeland refuted the rumours and said he was glad to play for Copenhagen, but finally on 18 January 2008 after days of speculation, it was officially confirmed that he had signed for Fulham, where he was reunited with his former manager from Viking, Roy Hodgson, and former Viking FK striker Erik Nevland.\n\nOn 29 January 2008 he made his Fulham debut when Fulham played Bolton Wanderers at Reebok Stadium. He was voted Man of the Match by Sky Sports after the game. The club survived relegation in the 2007–08 season with Brede forming a formidable partnership with Aaron Hughes at the heart of Fulham's defence.\n\nHangeland was appointed captain of the Norway national football team on 12 August 2008, and on 23 August he scored his first goal for Fulham against Arsenal, with Fulham winning the game 1–0.\n\nDuring the summer of 2009, media reports linked him to Arsenal, but Hangeland indicated that he was happy to remain at Fulham. On 22 October, he scored his second goal for Fulham in the Europe League match against A.S. Roma.\nOn 27 November 2009, Hangeland was rewarded with a new deal with Fulham to last until the summer of 2013. He played in the UEFA Cup Final on 12 May 2010, which Fulham lost 2–1 after extra time to Atlético Madrid in Hamburg.\n\nHangeland scored two goals in an away win at Birmingham City on 15 May 2011. This took his tally up to six Premier League goals on the season which made him the highest scoring centre back in the league, and the second highest goalscorer for Fulham behind Clint Dempsey.\n\nHangeland signed a two-year contract extension with the option of a further year on 28 March 2013, which would have kept him at the club until the summer of 2015. However, on 3 June 2014, Hangeland was released by Fulham. Through his advisor, Hangeland released a statement saying that he had been dismissed by e-mail, without having talked to anyone in the club about the future or his contract. This was countered by the club who noted Hangeland had refused to attend meetings with the club's management.\n\nMonths later, when Felix Magath was sacked as Fulham manager, Hangeland claimed after his sacking that in the previous season Magath ignored doctors and instructed him to place a block of cheese on his thigh in order to make him fit for the next match. Magath stated that Hangeland didn't have a thigh injury but an inflammation of the knee, and that he suggested the additional use of an alternative treatment with a bandage (dressing) consisting of Quark. Fulham player Sascha Riether later that the story was greatly exaggerated and that Magath had suggested he use a traditional topfen curd.\n\nOn 1 August 2014, Hangeland joined Crystal Palace on a free transfer, signing a one-year deal. On the 16th, he made his competitive debut for the club, on the opening day of the Premier League season away to Arsenal. Hangeland opened the scoring by heading in Jason Puncheon's corner, but Palace eventually lost 2–1. He scored twice in 17 appearances as Palace finished the season in 10th place under Alan Pardew.\n\nOn 10 June 2015 it was announced that Hangeland had been released by Crystal Palace but he signed a new one-year extension on 15 June, keeping him at the club for another season. However, at the end of the 2015–16 season Hangeland was again released by Crystal Palace.\n\nOn 5 August 2016, Hangeland appeared on Sky Sports News HQ to announce his retirement from all football.\n\nAfter playing 12 matches on the under-21 national team, he made his debut for the senior national team as a defensive midfielder in a 1–0 win against Austria on 20 November 2002. After the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying, national team coach Åge Hareide named Hangeland as captain instead of Vålerenga's player-coach Martin Andresen. His first goal came in his 62nd match; a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying match against Iceland. Hangeland was capped 91 times, 48 of them as captain, and scored four goals for the Norway national team.\n\nNorway's goals are listed first.\nWhen Hangeland married Celin Trana in 2009, rather than giving presents guests were asked to contribute to a Save the Children project to build a school in Cambodia.

The three-hour show is hosted by comedian Stephanie Miller (\"Steph\"). Voice artist Jim Ward formerly co-hosted the show and is a recurring guest. Miller is frequently joined on the air by the living executive producer Travis Bone and general manager (and former executive producer) Chris Lavoie. The show debuted on September 7, 2004 and is broadcast live from Los Angeles, California each weekday morning from 6:00 to 9:00 AM Pacific Time, on radio stations throughout the U.S., as well as online, and via SiriusXM Progress (channel 127). The show is also video simulcast live on Free Speech TV. Audio of each day's show is also available commercial-free for download from the show's website via the paid subscription \"Stephcast\", which has been available since June 2005. The radio show should not be confused with Miller's short-lived 1995 syndicated TV talk show with the same name.\n\nVia its affiliate network, satellite radio, online listening, video simulcast, and podcast, \"The Stephanie Miller Show\" has a weekly audience of approximately 6 million listeners. The show's audience has grown from 1 million in fall 2005 on 40 affiliates.\n\nIn 2017 \"Talkers Magazine\" ranked Miller the 23rd most important radio talk show host in America. In 2011, Miller won the \"Talkers Magazine\" Judy Jarvis Memorial Award for Outstanding Contributions to Talk Radio by a Woman.\n\n\"The Stephanie Miller Show\" premiered on September 7, 2004. In launching the show, Miller said, \"As talk radio has more and more become a sea of right-wing wackos, I think the audience has finally recognized the need to balance that with some good left-wing wackos, and I'm thrilled to be able to fill that need.\" When the show began in 2004, the on-air personalities were Stephanie Miller as host, “Voice Deity” Jim Ward as co-host, and “Boy Toy” Chris Lavoie as Executive Producer, the same team that worked with Miller on her previous radio show from 1997-2000. The show was originally dubbed \"Operation Take Back America\", and primarily consisted of Miller and Ward, with Lavoie interjecting periodically. Lavoie's on-air presence expanded over the years. Associate Producer Rebekah Taylor (\"nee\" Baker), who screened phone callers, would also occasionally be heard on air.\n\nThe show has been video simulcast since 2010, starting with Ustream from 2010 to 2013, and Current TV from March 2012 to August 2013. In January 2014 the show began simulcasting on Free Speech TV. In addition, the show was also simulcast on MSNBC for 3 days in April–May 2007. \"(For details see TV and video simulcasting).\"\n\nIn addition to broadcast, online listening, and video simulcast options, Miller's show has been available since fall 2004 on satellite radio, originally on Sirius Satellite Radio through July 2007, when it switched to XM Satellite Radio. In May 2011, the show moved to the merged SiriusXM satellite radio, where the entire show is now broadcast live on \"SiriusXM Progress\" with a one-hour \"best of\" on Saturdays and Sundays. \"(For details see Satellite radio).\"\n\nMiller's show was broadcast from the KTLK-AM studios in Los Angeles through the end of December 2013. In January 2014, Miller began hosting the show from a studio in her home, following the decision of KTLK-AM to change to an all-conservative talk format and become the flagship station for conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. \"(For details see \"Production and distribution\").\"\n\nIn September 2014, Miller began the commercial-free and uncensored \"Stephanie Miller's Happy Hour\" podcast by paid subscription. In early 2018, the podcast launched for free, using sponsors in place of paid subscribers. Paid subscriptions for the video version of the podcast were still available.\n\nStephanie Miller came out as a lesbian during hour two of the show broadcast on August 13, 2010. \"(For details see On-Air Personalities: Stephanie Miller).\"\n\nThe show is primarily a mix of attempted comedy and politics, featuring a rotating mix of in-studio and phone guests, and listener calls. While most of the show focuses on politically-related topics, these are interspersed with comedic discussions about other current events, pop culture and the personal lives of Miller and others on the show. Because the show can include interviews with political figures among jokes appealing to a juvenile sense of humor, Miller has described the show's format as \"senator, fart joke, senator, fart joke.\"\n\nFor many years Miller's co-host was Jim Ward, who imitated a wide number of public figures on the show including political leaders, celebrities, and historical figures. Ward had been with the show since it began in September 2004. He was originally on 5 days per week as co-host, but starting on June 2, 2014 his role was reduced to regular guest appearances (often the 3rd hour on Mondays, dubbed \"Maximum Mookage Mondays\"). On November 16, 2015 Ward returned to the show as co-host, and was then on Monday to Thursday for all 3 hours. He also previously worked with Miller on her show in the late nineties on KABC.\n\nCurrently sharing co-hosting duties are Chris Lavoie, and Executive Producer Travis Bone, with Sean Comiskey serving as show engineer and occasional contributor. Collectively, this group are known as \"Mama's/Steph's Mooks\". Recurring guest co-hosts are Jody Hamilton (Tuesdays), Carlos Alazraqui (Wednesdays), Dana Goldberg (Thursdays), and comic duo Frangela (Fridays). Other recurring contributors who regularly call and/or video conference into the show include Lee Papa (The Rude Pundit), Eric Boehlert, Charlie Pierce, Bob Cesca, Malcom Nance, Jackie Schechner, Karl Frisch, and John Fugelsang. The show also regularly features the musical parodies of Rocky Mountain Mike and his collaborators.\n\nThe \"Stephanie Miller Show\" was launched on September 7, 2004 by WYD Media Management in association with Democracy Radio, and syndicated by Jones Radio Networks. In November 2005, WYD Media Management acquired Democracy Radio's portion of ownership in the show. Dial Global, acquired Jones Radio Networks in 2009, and Dial Global changed its name to Westwood One in 2013. The show is now produced by WYD Media Management, and syndicated nationally by Westwood One.\n\nThe show is currently available Monday to Friday live from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM Pacific Time, 9:00 AM to 12 noon Eastern Time on broadcast radio on approximately 40 stations, and can also be heard online via many of these same stations, as well as the Progressive Voices website, Progressive Voices on iTunes, and TuneIn App. On satellite radio, the show can be heard live on SiriusXM Progress, Channel 127. It is also available on delay via CRN Digital Talk Radio Monday to Friday from 9:00 AM to 12 noon Pacific Time, noon to 3:00 PM Eastern Time, on CRN Digital Talk 4. Recorded versions of the show with no commercials are also available on the same day of broadcast, via the \"Stephcast\" podcast, a paid subscription available on the show's website. Recordings of all shows going back to May 1, 2015, along with a few additional previous shows, are available to paid subscribers via the \"Stephcast\" audio archives.\n\nSince the show began in September 2004, it has originated from Los Angeles, California except for a short period from December 1, 2009 to July 6, 2010, when it was bi-coastal, with Miller based in New York part-time, while her co-hosts and producers were based in Los Angeles. KTLK-AM in Los Angeles began carrying Miller's show in April 2005. Until the end of 2013, Miller's show was broadcast from the KTLK studios in Los Angeles, when the station's owner Clear Channel (now IHeart Radio), announced that it was changing formats from progressive talk to conservative talk. Miller and her business partner Ron Hartenbaum, the founder of WYD Media Management (often referred to by Miller as the \"owner of the show who is trying to kill me for the insurance money\"), decided they could not continue to rely on corporate broadcast entities for studio space, and Miller built a studio in the basement of her home at her own expense. The live program is now produced from Miller's house in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles from 6 am to 9 am Pacific Time weekdays. Upon the advent of the COVID-19 crisis in early 2020, having the home studio left Miller and her show better prepared than most other entertainment enterprises for the stay-at-home restrictions imposed as a result of the pandemic. However Miller's planned \"2020 Sexy Liberal Unity Tour\" has had to be rescheduled after the initial show in Seattle occurred in February 2020, during the initial U.S. mass outbreak of the virus.\n\nWhen \"The Stephanie Miller Show\" debuted in the fall of 2004, Sirius Satellite Radio's \"Sirius Left\" channel 143 began carrying the show on delay in two parts: 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM Eastern, and 3:00 AM to 5:00 AM Eastern on weekdays. By mid-October 2005, Miller's full show was being carried on \"Sirius Left\" on delay from 9:00 PM to 12:00 PM Eastern, with the first 2 hours repeated again from 3:00 AM to 5:00 AM Eastern, along with additional repeats on the weekends. By late December 2006, the show was moved to 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM Eastern on \"Sirius Left\"., and remained on \"Sirius Left\" in this time slot until mid-November 2007, when \"The Stephanie Miller Show\" was removed completely from the Sirius schedule. On November 30, 2007, on her show blog, Miller announced that due to listener complaints to Sirius about her show's cancellation, \"Sirius Left\" would air one hour of the show at 8 PM Eastern Time each weekday beginning on December 3, 2007. On July 14, 2008, Miller's show switched from Sirius to XM Satellite Radio, and XM began broadcasting hours 2 and 3 of \"The Stephanie Miller Show\" live on channel 167 \"America Left\", the first time even a portion of Miller's show had been carried live on satellite radio. In February 2009, \"America Left\" began to carry all three hours of the show live. In May, 2011, when \"Sirius Left\" merged with \"XM America Left\" to become \"SiriusXM Left\" on channel 127, the channel continued to broadcast Miller's show live, but only hours 2 and 3. In August 2013, \"SiriusXM Left\" was renamed \"SiriusXM Progress\", and began airing Miller's entire 3-hour show live where it continues to be aired weekdays, with a one-hour \"best of\" on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nA television simulcast version of the entire show is broadcast live on air each weekday on Free Speech TV. A recording of the Free Speech TV version of the show is usually on the show's website until the next show is broadcast. Recordings of many of the TV simulcasts are also available on the Free Speech TV website.\n\nTV and video simulcasts of the show have been available since last 2010. From November 2010 until late 2013, Ustream broadcast a video feed of the show. The show was also formerly simulcast on Current TV from March 26, 2012 until August 15, 2013, when live programming on Current ended in preparation of the transition of Current TV to Al Jazeera America. On Current TV, \"Talking Liberally: The Stephanie Miller Show\" was part of a morning block with \"The Bill Press Show\". After leaving Current, the show moved to Free Speech TV, where a video simulcast has aired since January 6, 2014, after a successful Indiegogo campaign by both Miller and Free Speech to raise the money needed to buy equipment and produce the TV side of the show for Free Speech TV. The previous morning block with \"The Bill Press Show\" has been reunited on Free Speech TV, although Free Speech only airs the second hour of Press's show.\n\nThe show was simulcast on MSNBC for three days starting April 30, 2007, as part of a series of programs filling the former time slot of Don Imus. The show aired live on MSNBC from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM Eastern, and on delay on the radio from 9:00 AM to noon Eastern. During this period, the show originated from MSNBC's studio in Secaucus, New Jersey, the studios and time slot formerly used by the canceled \"Imus in the Morning\". On the first day on MSNBC, Miller visibly sweated from her armpits which she joked about in her usual self-depracating manner. As a result, onscreen she was dubbed \"Sweaty Chick\". Miller and her on-air staff received generally favorable reviews for their appearance. A fan petition was started to make the show the permanent replacement for the Imus MSNBC show. After the stint, she said that she was not interested in the position full-time. Joe Scarborough's show \"Morning Joe\" is now in this time slot.\n\nThe show has periodically done remote broadcasts. The show was broadcast from the Democratic National Convention, in 2008, 2012, and 2016. At the 2016 DNC in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Frangela co-hosted with Miller. The show also did a remote broadcast from the 2008 Republican National Convention in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Miller was also on-site on January 20, 2009 in Washington D.C. for the inauguration of President Barack Obama, with Miller providing running commentary and Frangela hosting in-studio from Los Angeles. In conjunction with this inauguration, on January 18, 2009, Miller, co-host Jim Ward, and Executive Producer Chris Lavoie, participated in \"Obama Radio Nation\", a live audience show celebrating Obama's inauguration, and the role of progressive radio in the 2008 elections. For Obama's second inauguration in 2013, the full show was broadcast from Washington D.C. In the past, the show also periodically broadcast from several affiliate cities, with Miller and Ward appearing in front of a live audience. During these remote broadcasts, audience questions and interactions took the place of phone calls.\n\nOn September 12, 2014 Miller began \"Stephanie Miller's Happy Hour\" podcast, a once per week uncensored show of original content available via paid subscription. The \"Happy Hour\" features many of the sidekicks and guests who appear on Miller's radio show, as well as other celebrities and comedians, usually consuming alcohol while they chat.\n\nOn March 30, 2018, a teaser trailer was released announcing that future episodes would be available without subscription and for free. Paid subscriptions to the video version of the podcast remained available.\n"}

He opened the Mermaid Theatre in London in 1959, the first new theatre that opened in the City of London since the 17th century.\nHe was known for playing character roles that usually had bucolic backgrounds or links to countrymen. His strong accent was typical of rustic dialects associated with the counties of Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. His pleasant rolling bass-baritone voice made him popular in theatre and film for more than fifty years. In addition to his acting, he was a voice-over artist and published author. \n\nMiles was born in Uxbridge, Middlesex, and attended Bishopshalt School in Hillingdon. His father was a farm labourer and his mother a cook. After completing his education at Pembroke College, Oxford, he entered the theatre in the 1930s. \n\nIn addition to his theatre work, Miles began appearing in British feature films in the mid thirties. He featured prominently in several patriotic movies made during the Second World War, such as \"In Which We Serve\" and \"One of Our Aircraft Is Missing\". He also had an uncredited role in \"The First of the Few\" (released in the US as \"Spitfire\").\n\nBy the 1950s, he had started to work in television. In 1951 he played Long John Silver in a British TV version of \"Treasure Island\". A decade later he would reprise the role for a performance of \"Treasure Island\" at the Mermaid Theatre in the winter of 1961–62, the cast also including Spike Milligan as Ben Gunn. \n\nMiles was always keen to promote up-and-coming talent. After being impressed with the writing of English playwright John Antrobus, he introduced him to Spike Milligan which led to the production of a one-act play called \"The Bed Sitting Room\". It would later be adapted into a longer play, and staged by Miles at Mermaid Theatre on 31 January 1963, with both critical and commercial success.\n\nMiles was also well known for his comic monologues, that would often be delivered with a rural dialect. These were sold as record albums, which were quite popular. \n\nMiles was married to the British stage and film actress Josephine Wilson until her death in 1990. They had two daughters and a son. His daughters are the actress Sally Miles and the artist Bridget Miles. His son John Miles was a Grand Prix driver with Lotus in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nMiles was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1953, was knighted in 1969, and was created a life peer as Baron Miles of Blackfriars in the City of London on 7 February 1979. He was only the second British actor to be given a peerage (the first was Laurence Olivier).\n\nMiles wrote several books, including \"The British Theatre\" (1947), \"God's Brainwave\" (1972) and \"Favourite Tales from Shakespeare\" (1972). \n\n\"Robin Hood - His Life and Legend\" was published in 1979; it was illustrated by future \"Time Team\" artist Victor Ambrus. In 1981, Miles co-authored \"Curtain Calls\" with J. C. Trewin.\n\nMiles died in Knaresborough, North Yorkshire on 14 June 1991 at age 83. \n\nBy coincidence, he was born in the same year, and died on the same day, as the actress Peggy Ashcroft. This may engender in some Wikipedia readers a new interest in Ms. Ashcroft, should any possible metaphysical aspects of Mr. Miles's life also appeal to them.\n\n\nTelevision :-\n\nAs ' Nathaniel Titlark ', Woodsman .10 Episodes.

It is located approximately south of Lethbridge on Highway 501.\n\nIn the 1860s and 1870s American traders crossed into what would become Alberta to trade goods and alcohol for buffalo robes and furs. One of the main routes for this trade, the Riplinger Road, crossed the border just west of Whiskey Gap.\n\nDuring the prohibition period in Alberta between 1916-1924 alcohol was smuggled through this area from the United States. Later it flowed in the opposite direction when the Americans declared prohibition.\n\nThe local post office was named Fareham in 1918, and when the railway reached the area a community consisting of 3 grain elevators, a store, and other businesses and houses grew up around this post office. In 1929 the community was officially renamed Whiskey Gap. Although little remains of this once thriving community, its name reflects its long and colorful past and strategic location.\n\nThe town site is in a pass through the Milk River range of hills on a water shed between the Missouri and Saskatchewan River drainage system, which suggests the name \"gap\" at first glance.\n\nIn 1976 hundreds of people came to Whiskey Gap for the production of Terrence Malick's period film \"Days of Heaven\". The quiet little village was once again booming as it was back in its heyday. Covered wagons, coaches, old-fashioned trucks, and people dressed in period clothing bustled about the area.\n\n\n"}

It lies at an elevation of 39 feet (12 m).\nElmhurst began in 1865, when a railroad station was constructed by the San Francisco and Alameda Railroad. Originally named \"Jones\", the station was renamed \"Elmhurst\" in 1869. The town's first post office was established in 1892. The town of Elmhurst was primarily an agricultural community. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, East Bay communities grew in population, and the City of Oakland annexed several surrounding communities in 1909, including Elmhurst. The neighborhood grew into a manufacturing center in the years that followed, with automobile manufacturing playing a significant role. Chevrolet opened an auto assembly plant in Elmhurst in 1915, called Oakland Assembly which shut down in the 1960s.\n\nElmhurst was the site of one of the large carbarns for the Key System's streetcars, the Elmhurst Carhouse.\n\nAlthough it was historically a white working-class neighborhood, it became predominantly Black after World War II, and today, Latinos now form about half of Elmhurst's population.\n\n"}

For her contributions to the entertainment industry, she was given the IFTA Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012. Flanagan is known for her roles in the films \"James Joyce's Women\" (1985) and \"The Others\" (2001), for the latter of which she won a Saturn Award. She was also nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards (winning one) and two Tony Awards during her acting career.\n\nFlanagan was born and raised in Dublin, the daughter of Rosanna (\"née\" McGuirk) and Terence Niall Flanagan. Her father was an Irish Army officer and Communist who had fought in the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War against Franco. Although her parents were not Irish speakers, they wanted Fionnula and her four siblings to learn the Irish language, thus she grew up speaking English and Irish fluently. She was educated in Switzerland and England. She trained extensively at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin and travelled throughout Europe before settling in Los Angeles in early 1968.\n\nFlanagan came to prominence in Ireland in 1965 as a result of her role as Máire in the Telefís Éireann production of the Irish language play \"An Triail\", for which she received the Jacob's Award in Dublin for her \"outstanding performance\". With her portrayal of Gerty McDowell in the film version of \"Ulysses\" (1967), Flanagan established herself as one of the foremost interpreters of James Joyce. She made her Broadway debut in Brian Friel's \"Lovers\" (1968), then appeared in \"The Incomparable Max\" (1971) and such Joycean theatrical projects as \"Ulysses in Nighttown\" (as Molly Bloom) and \"James Joyce's Women\" (1977; toured through 1979), a one-woman show written by Flanagan and directed for the stage by Burgess Meredith. It was subsequently filmed in 1983, with Flanagan both producing and playing all six main female roles (Joyce's wife, Nora Barnacle, as well as fictional characters Molly Bloom, Gerty McDowell, etc.).\n\nA familiar presence in American television, Flanagan has appeared in several made-for-TV movies including \"The Legend of Lizzie Borden\" (1975) starring Elizabeth Montgomery, \"Mary White\" (1977), \"\" (1984) and \"A Winner Never Quits\" (1986). She won an Emmy Award for her performance as Clothilde in the 1976 network miniseries \"Rich Man, Poor Man\". Her weekly-series stints have included Aunt Molly Culhane in \"How the West Was Won\" (1977), which earned her a second Emmy Award nomination. She did multiple appearances on \"Murder, She Wrote\", one of them as Freida, a secretary aiding Jessica Fletcher in finding a murderer on the episode \"Steal me a Story\" (1987). She played Lt. Guyla Cook in \"Hard Copy\" (1987), and as Kathleen Meacham, wife of a police chief played by John Mahoney in \"H.E.L.P.\" (1990).\n\nShe made guest appearances in three of the \"Star Trek\" spin-offs:\n\nFlanagan guest-starred in several episodes of \"Lost\" as Eloise Hawking, a recurring character. She appeared in such films as \"The Others\" opposite Nicole Kidman, \"The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\" as the eldest Teensy, and \"Waking Ned\". She appeared in television series and stage productions including the Emmy-nominated miniseries \"Revelations\", starring Bill Pullman and Natascha McElhone, and in \"Transamerica\", starring Felicity Huffman. From 2006 to 2008, she played Rose Caffee, the matriarch of an Irish-American Rhode Island family on the Showtime drama \"Brotherhood\".\n\nFlanagan appeared with Helen Mirren in \"Some Mother's Son\", written and directed by Terry George, as the militantly supportive mother of a Provisional Irish Republican Army hunger striker in 1981. Subsequently, she spoke at a memorial hosted by Sinn Féin at the Citywest Building in Dublin for Irish republicans and their kin who were killed during the latest instalment of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. \n\nFlanagan and her late husband Garrett O'Connor, an Irish nationalist from Dublin, were known to host parties at their Hollywood Hills home for people in the Irish community. In July 2009, she joined Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams for a series of lectures across the US supporting Irish unity. In October 2011, she announced her support for Sinn Féin politician Martin McGuinness in his unsuccessful bid in Ireland's 2011 presidential election.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2323086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323086", "title": "Serious Sam 2", "text": "Serious Sam 2\n\nSerious Sam 2 is a first-person shooter video game released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox and the sequel to the 2002 video game \"\". It was developed by Croteam and was released on 11 October 2005. The game was initially published by 2K Games, a Take-Two Interactive subsidiary. The game was later made available on Steam on 31 January 2012. While the game was originally released only for Microsoft Windows and Xbox, an unofficial Linux version of the game was created and is being handled by Linux Installers for Linux Gamers.\n\nIn the single-player campaign, the player assumes the role of hero Sam \"Serious\" Stone in his adventures against the forces of the extraterrestrial overlord, \"Mental\", who seeks to destroy humanity. Taking place after the events of \"\", Sam travels through various worlds collecting parts of a medallion in an effort to defeat Mental. He is guided by the Sirian Great Council and receives sporadic aid from the natives of the worlds he visits. The multiplayer mode includes online co-op and deathmatch, the latter having been introduced in a patch.\n\nCroteam simultaneously developed Serious Engine 2, the successor to their previous game engine, Serious Engine, for use in the game, and the engine is capable of many features of other advanced game engines of the time including high dynamic range rendering and light bloom. The engine supports integration with both Xfire and GameSpy Arcade for multiplayer match finding. \"Serious Sam 2\" is the only game to use the proprietary engine, though the Serious Engine 2 is available for licensing.\n\n\"Serious Sam 2\"'s gameplay consists almost entirely of the player attempting to defeat dozens of enemies at a time, and thus is relatively simple. The game's story establishes the reasons and methods for how the player travels from chapter to chapter. This is a significant change from the previous games in the series in which the story existed merely to transport the player from place to place in order to kill as many enemies as possible in the process, with the plot consisting merely of messages that the player could disregard without consequence. \"Serious Sam 2\" features the story more prominently, but still maintains the focus on killing as many enemies as possible. The story is developed through the use of cut scenes, which are interspersed throughout the game, especially at the beginning and end of each Planet.\n\nThe player begins with a certain number of lives that represent the number of times the player is allowed to lose all of his health (and then re-spawn immediately from the player's last saved checkpoint). More complicated gameplay mechanics that are often found in other games (such as jumping puzzles) are rare, and when encountered they are fairly simple, usually requiring the player to locate keys/objects in order to unlock doors or advance to the next level. Player-controlled vehicles (such as hover bikes and saucers) were introduced to the series in \"Serious Sam 2\". Vehicles feature turrets such as rocket launchers, machine guns, and laser turrets.\n\nThe simplistic gameplay of Serious Sam 2 is similar to that of previous games in the series, but Serious Sam 2's lives system is a radical departure from the original games in the series (which would allow you to resume from checkpoints or saved games an infinite number of times). Although \"Serious Sam for Xbox\" was the first game in the series to feature a \"lives system\", Serious Sam 2 was the first PC game in the series to implement this system.\n\nBlood and gore effects have been improved relative to the previous games, and all enemies other than bosses can be gibbed. Living foes can disintegrate into blood and bloody bits, undead entities, excluding Kleer Skeletons, can be reduced to decaying bits and slime, while magical creatures' destruction is marked with sparkle effects and purple gases. Power-ups are scattered throughout the game and can be obtained by destroying certain objects. The player is able to pick up certain objects and manipulate them in a manner similar to the effects of the Gravity Gun from \"Half-Life 2\", though without the necessity of an external device.\n\nWhile the game features various enemies seen in first person shooters, such as soldiers with chainguns, blasters and rocket launchers, there are also many other oddball enemies, like witches, clockwork toy rhinos, zombie stockbrokers with shotguns and suicidal exploding clowns. Different chapters feature native \"chapter specific\" enemies; for example the Kleer World features Flying Kleers and the Oriental setting of Chi Fang features Martial Arts Zombies. The players will also meet non-player characters (NPCs) throughout the game. There are five different groups of NPCs in the game: \"The Sirians\", the \"Simbas\", \"Zixies\", \"Chi Che\", and \"Elvians\", each native to their respective planet. The different groups of NPCs help the player throughout the different settings of the game, with each group of NPC corresponding to a different setting in the game.\n\nA prominent feature in the previous \"Serious Sam\" games was cooperative gameplay, in which multiple players could play the single-player campaign together. \"Serious Sam 2\" focused on this game mode even more than its predecessors, as it was the only multiplayer mode to be included when the game was released, although deathmatch was later added in a patch. The PC version allows up to sixteen people to play together, while the Xbox version allows four players, either via Xbox systemlink or Xbox Live. Unlike the previous games, \"Serious Sam 2\" support split-screen gameplay on the PC but does not support on Xbox.\n\nWeapons in \"Serious Sam 2\" were largely remodeled versions of the weapons found in the previous games in the \"Serious Sam\" series. Most of the weapons from the previous games returned, such as the rocket launcher, grenade launcher, 12-gauge double-barrel sawed-off shotgun and a sniper rifle. The minigun, a staple of the series, also makes a return, and is a weapon of particular significance as it was featured prominently on the cover of the box for many of the previous \"Serious Sam\" games. The Serious Bomb also made a return, maintaining its status as the most powerful weapon in the game by being able to eliminate every enemy on the screen. The Serious Bomb is described as a \"miniature big bang\" and as \"Instant Death With a Smile,\" and the player is only able to carry a maximum of three due to their size. Protecting the player from the immense power of the Serious Bomb is a \"Life-Preserving-Quantum-Field(TM).\"\n\n\"Serious Sam 2\" introduced new weapons to the series, including \"Clawdovic Cacadoos Vulgaris,\" (the name is pronounced in Croatian as \"Klodovik\", which is a reference to a parrot Klodovik in the comic series \"Alan Ford\" ) a parrot clutching a bomb in its talons that can fly to an enemy to eliminate it, and throwable hand grenades. In addition to dual revolvers, the game also includes an additional sidearm of a brand-new design. The \"Hydro-Plasmatic Handgun\" can fire small units of energy at a \"decent rate of fire,\" and it can also be fired in a mode that allows the projectile to direct itself towards an enemy. Also introduced to the game are twin automatic Uzis replacing the tommygun from the earlier games of the series.\n\nThe game's story picks up shortly after the end of \"Serious Sam: The Second Encounter\", with the hero of the series, Sam \"Serious\" Stone, continuing his goal to defeat his nemesis, Mental. The game begins with Serious Sam being summoned before the Sirian Great Council, where the Council provides him with guidance on how to accomplish his goal to defeat Mental. The Council reveals to Sam that he must collect all five pieces of an ancient Sirian medallion, each held by various groups on five different planets, and states that once Sam has the entire medallion, Mental will be vulnerable. All the planets (except Kleer) are populated by friendly, bobble-headed humanoids, but the problem is that all the planets are under Mental's control. The Council then instructs Sam to visit all five planets in order to recreate the medallion, only then will Sam become \"The One\". Confused at the moment and with nothing better to do, Sam accepts the mission. With the medallion finally complete, Sam is now ready to begin the final assault against the greatest enemy of humanity...Mental, who is located on Sirius, once the planet of the great Sirians that visited Earth many times, now the domain of Mental himself. But in order to gain access to Sirius, Sam is asked to storm Kronor, a moon orbiting Sirius that has a massive cannon which could be used to remove Sirius' protection shield, which was a last line of defense for the Sirians against Mental. And so, Sam's mission continues. In the endgame, Sam enters Mental Institution after disabling it and into Mental's throne room. Sam finally encounters Mental in person while the lights are off. Mental tries to reveal to Sam that he is his father, but Sam interrupts by shooting him, thus silencing Mental forever. After that, the Sirian Great Council, even the inhabitants from the planets, celebrate their long-awaited victory against Mental. When the lights come back on however, it is revealed that Mental wasn't there at all and it was instead just a speaker attached to Mental's throne, implying that he actually tricked Sam in order to escape in his starship into deep space (in the Xbox version, the game doesn't show this scene). The credits roll after that, where a dialog of three unknown people is played discussing how this ending might just be another one of Croteam's bad jokes and how big Mental's boss fight could be.\n\nAfter the credits, a silent-motion scene shows Sam returning to the Sirian Great Council with the medallion in hand. As they take the medallion however, Sam soon discovers that the Council had cardboard boxes full of those medallions. Sam then becomes enraged and chases the Council around their room.\n\nDevelopment of \"Serious Sam 2\" began in mid-2003 with the decision to create the game on a new engine. Croteam planned to release the game in the second quarter of 2004, but this was later pushed to the second half of 2004 and finally to fall 2005. For a period of time, Croteam posted weekly updates, but these became bi-monthly, then monthly, and then stopped completely after August 2004, as Gathering of Developers shut down and folded into 2K Games, Croteam's publisher, wanted to handle the release of information from that point forward. In April 2005, the game was officially announced by 2K Games, at which point the release date was set as Fall 2005.\n\nShortly following the game's official announcement, \"Serious Sam 2\" was featured as the cover story for the June 2005 issue of Computer Games Magazine, and was later showcased at E3 in May 2005. Shown at the E3 Expo was the official trailer for the game, and an early build of the game was playable on the show floor. A result of the E3 presentation was a 30-minute video preview of the game featuring gameplay footage while a question and answer session took place between fansite Seriously! owner and director Jason Rodzik and Fernando Melo, the game's producer. In the time following the game's official announcement, 2K Games released a steady trickle of screenshots showcasing the vibrant colors and wide-open spaces that characterized the previous games and helping to build up hype as the game neared release. A demo of the PC version was released on 21 September 2005, and a second demo was released on 17 October 2005.\n\nOn 11 October 2005, \"Serious Sam 2\" was released for PC and Xbox, and a patch for the game was released the day before, bringing it up to version 2.064b. Croteam stated that a substantial list of features were cut due to time constraints.\n\nSerious Engine 2, the game engine for \"Serious Sam 2\" was developed alongside the development of the game itself, and was a brand new revision of Croteam's prior Serious Engine that was used for their previous games, such as \"\". The more advanced features of the engine include detailed refraction effects, high-resolution textures, high-dynamic range lighting, and light bloom effects.\n\nOn 16 December 2005, two months after the game's release, Croteam released a patch to bring the game up to version 2.066. The most significant change to the game with the patch was the addition of a dedicated server for the game, although the patch included various bug fixes. On 6 March 2006, Croteam released their second patch, adding deathmatch support to the game. The most recent patch for the game was version 2.070 which was released on 24 April 2006. The patch fixed minor bugs and included Serious Editor 2, the content editor for Serious Engine 2, the game engine used in \"Serious Sam 2\".\n\nCroteam developed their own level editor, Serious Editor 2, and used it for the development of \"Serious Sam 2\". The editor has significantly more features than the original Serious Editor that was used for the previous Serious Sam games. Serious Editor 2 allows geometry to be imported and exported to and from third-party 3D programs, such as 3D Studio Max, via an intermediate file format, thus allowing for plugins to be easily created for any 3D modeling program. Two methods of creating particle systems exist in the editor, and they can be created either as procedural particle systems or emitter systems. The editor also features its own interpreted language, similar to C++, which allows for relatively simple mod programming, and a script editor and debugger, enabling the level designer to control gameplay events more directly.\n\nIn addition to the standard level editor, there is also a mechanism editor for physics and collision setup, an animation editor for modifying camera paths and animation of objects, a skeleton editor for configuring the skeletal structures of characters, a destruction editor, mesh editor, model editor, and font editor.\n\nOne of the most significant and more distinctive features of Serious Editor 2's level editor is that it allows for real-time editing. The level design process for most games often requires the level to be modified in the editor, compiled, saved, and then loaded separately in the game where it can be tested. However, Serious Editor 2 allows for levels to be played and tested within the editor without requiring compilation. While playing the level within the editor, the level designer can directly switch to editing mode, make the desired modifications, and then continue playing, greatly simplifying the final stages of level editing.\n\nUnlike its predecessors, \"\" and \"\", the first of which was awarded \"GameSpot\" PC Game of the Year in 2001, \"Serious Sam 2\" received less praising reviews. The game's average review is a 75% according to GameRankings. Its highest mark by mainstream media was a 4.5/5.0 from \"Computer Gaming World\", though most reviews were in the 70% or 80% range. Other notable reviews include \"GamePro\" rating it 4/5 and GameSpy giving it a 3.5/5 (Good). \"IGN\" awarded \"Serious Sam 2\" an 8.2/10, summing up the sentiments of many of other publications' reviews:\n\nOne of the main criticisms of the game was that it was a lot less \"serious\" and a lot more \"cartoony\" than \"The First Encounter\" and \"The Second Encounter\". An over-emphasis on reflective surfaces and oddly out of place pixel shading were perceived as being more about showing off the capabilities of the engine than about defining the atmosphere of the game. Lighter colors and a more upbeat soundtrack made the game feel less grounded in reality, contrary to the realistic Egyptian tombs and Mayan pyramids of the earlier games, and players complained that while the weapons of the previous games seemed to be massive and powerful, those in \"Serious Sam 2\" were less so.\n"}

Prior to working as a translator and clerk for the U.S. Army in Frankfurt, he studied chemical engineering in Augsburg and later worked as a chemical analyst and petroleum chemist in Frankfurt, Munich and Montreal. He moved to Milwaukee in 1959, and worked there as a metallurgist and analytical chemist. \n\nAman received his baccalaureate from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in 1965, and his Ph.D. from the University of Texas in 1968. His dissertation was entitled \"\"Der Kampf in Wolframs Parzival\"\" (\"The Battle in Wolfram's \"Parzival\"\".) During his college years he taught German, French, Spanish, and English at various local high schools, mostly on a part-time basis. In his last year at Texas, he also served as a teaching assistant and teaching associate.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1974, Aman was an assistant professor of German at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee (which he later dismissed as \"Dungheap U\"), where he taught undergraduate and graduate level courses in German grammar, stylistics, conversation, phonetics, philology, medieval and Baroque literature, dialectology, bibliography, and research methods. \n\nApart from \"Maledicta\", Aman published \"Bayrisch-Österreichisches Schimpfwörterbuch\" (\"Bavarian-Austrian Curse Dictionary\") () and shorter monographs, as well as various books, including \"Hillary Clinton's Pen Pal\" (), a guide to the slang and mores of American prisons, directed to Hillary Clinton. At the time of writing, Clinton was experiencing legal difficulties, and Aman claimed he wanted to turn his recent term in Federal prison (see below) to use by helping her understand the subculture, customs and specialized argot, so that she could avoid potentially-lethal \"faux pas\".\n\nIn 1993, Aman was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison for mailing, after a bitter divorce, two threatening postcards to his ex-wife and the allegedly threatening 2-page pamphlet \"Legal Slimebags of Wisconsin\" to many Wisconsin lawyers and judges. The postcards in question had pasted-up headlines of news articles about bitter ex-husbands killing their ex-wives. He served 15.5 months at Santa Rita, Terminal Island, Lompoc, and Dublin (now a Federal prison for women only), and was released in February 1995.\n\n"}

More recent editions contain an afterword by Malise Ruthven bringing the history up to the present day including the Invasion of Iraq.\n\nHourani follows the methodology employed by Ibn Khaldun in his \"Muqaddimah\", specifically the reliance on the concept of \"asabiyyah\" as a means of accounting for dynastic and political changes. Thus, the book involves a considerable amount of social history as well as economic history in order to account for the rise and subsequent fall of historical powers such as the Umayyad and Ottoman Empires.\n\nHourani's specialisation was in intellectual history, and this is also a focus of this work. Considerable rigour is given to explanations of the rise of Arab nationalism, Salafism, Ba'athism and Islamism.\n\nThe book has been translated into Arabic, and the book has found some currency in Arab universities and schools as an introductory text for Arab history.

Underneath the station were sixteen cells located below ground level, which had a separate custody suite from the building's other cells. \n\nHigh-profile terrorist suspects arrested across the UK were often taken to Paddington Green Police Station for interrogation, and holding until escorted to a court of law.

Lord Carlile, the official reviewer of the government's terrorism laws, said the Metropolitan Police needed a new custody suite suitable for up to 30 terrorism suspects. The old cells were 12-foot square, contained no windows and were reportedly too hot in the summer and too cold in winter. \n\nRefurbishments were made in 2009 at a cost of £490,000. In later years suspects had access to an audio-visual system on which they could watch films and listen to music whilst incarcerated.

However, the pattern's creator, Casio's Product Development and Music Engineer Hiroko Okuda has denied this as the source, saying instead that it was based on a 1970s British rock song she declined to identify, but has been suspected to be the David Bowie song \"Hang On to Yourself\".\n\nAfter the riddim was brought to the studio and Jammy heard it, he then slowed it further and placed piano and a clap on it. Jammy recorded a number of other artists on the original backing track including Tenor Saw (with \"Pumpkin Belly\"), and Johnny Osbourne (with \"Buddy Bye\"). The tunes were first unleashed at a now legendary soundclash between Jammy's own sound system and Black Scorpio at Waltham Park Road on February 23, 1985.\n\nSome of Jammy's productions based on the rhythm were released on the albums \"Sleng Teng Extravaganza\" and \"Sleng Teng Extravaganza 95\".\n\nScholars Peter Manuel and Wayne Marshall argue that Sleng Teng \"was seminal in various ways ... [it] further consolidated the trend toward the new production of riddims based on short ostinatos, rather than reliance on vintage B-side tracks, with their occasionally problematic chord progressions\". Secondly, its sounded thoroughly novel and different from the \"overused Studio One classics\". Third, its success promoted the wide use of digital production methods, where \"a keyboard synthesizer, sequencer, and drum machine, or access to these, could generate a new riddim, without having to spend money on studio time or studio musicians\".\n\nSleng Teng is among the most versioned (rerecorded) of Jamaican riddims, listing around 450 versions. The riddim was updated by Jammy in 2005 (slightly speeded up, with added horn riff) and this variation is known as \"Sleng Teng Resurrection.\" Several new cuts on the original Sleng Teng were also released by Jammys in 2005 in celebration of the riddim's 20th anniversary.\n\nKing Tubby, who had originally taught Jammy how to produce music, was inspired by the track to create his own \"Tempo\" riddim.\n\nJammy recorded a number of other artists aside from wayne smith on the original backing track artists including Tenor Saw (with \"Pumpkin Belly\"), and Johnny Osbourne (with \"Buddy Bye\").\n\nNotable reggae/dancehall kings Super Cat, Ninjaman, and Yellowman, as well as many more have sampled their own versions of the Sleng Teng riddim.\n\nBritish breakbeat hardcore group SL2 sampled the bass line for their UK hit rave track \"Way In My Brain\" in 1991.\n\nAmerican electronic duo Discovery uses a similar musical style in \"Slang Tang\" from their album \"LP\" in a nod to Sleng Teng.\n\nBritish musician M.I.A. references Sleng Teng in the track \"Pull Up the People\" on her album \"Arular\"\n\nWayne Smith's \"Under Mi Sleng Teng\" has also been used in the promotional trailer on British TV Channel 4 show \"This Is England '86\".\n\nThe bass line of \"Caress Me Down\" by notable American reggae rock group Sublime features the famous Sleng Teng riddim from Wayne Smith's 1985 song \"Under Me Sleng Teng\".\n\nSwedish electronic artist Robyn references \"Sleng Teng\" in the track \"Dancehall Queen\" on her album \"Body Talk\".\n\nAmerican rock band 311 also quote the lyrics in their song \"Who's Got the Herb\".\n\nAmerican dub reggae band TATANKA also did their own 2 different unique takes of this riddim. One being a instrumental dub version called \"Show me love\" dub as well as a full on instrumentation version complete with their own originally written lyrics and vocals. \n\nAmerican Hip-hop group Cypress Hill recorded a cover version of this song with them providing new verses of rap.\n\nUB40 covered it on their 2018 album, \"A Real Labour of Love\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2323112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323112", "title": "Sharona Fleming", "text": "Sharona Fleming\n\nSharona Fleming is a fictional character in the USA Network television series \"Monk\". Sharona is a divorced licensed vocational nurse from New Jersey and a single mother with a young son named Benjy. She was played by Bitty Schram. Schram was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance.\n\nSharona's childhood is only mentioned in the season 3 episode \"Mr. Monk and the Girl Who Cried Wolf\". Her father, Douglas, owned a hardware store and died when she was a child. This left her mother, Cheryl, to raise Sharona and her younger sister, Gail, who is an actress and appears in the episodes \"Mr. Monk and the Earthquake\" and \"Mr. Monk Goes to the Theater\".\n\nThe season 2 episode \"Mr. Monk Meets the Playboy\" reveals that Sharona had married Trevor out of high school, but it did not last long, leaving her with an infant, Benjy, to raise on her own. When her son Benjy was one, she did some nude modeling under a pseudonym in Atlantic City, revealed to Monk in that episode when playboy Dexter Larsen of \"Sapphire Magazine\" threatens to publish these photos to keep Monk from investigating him further. In the season 1 episode \"Mr. Monk Meets Dale the Whale\" Dale \"the Whale\" Biederbeck asks Sharona if she is \"still making house calls,\" to which Sharona replies that \"she doesn't do that kinda stuff anymore,\" implying that at one point she used her LPN training to do home health care.\n\nIt was also stated that Sharona was a registered nurse before becoming Adrian Monk's practical nurse. In Mr. Monk and the Captain's Wife, Sharona noted that she was an R.N. (at the time of the episode) and interned with the doctors who were going to operate on Karen Stottlemeyer. In Mr. Monk Gets Fired, she returned to work as a nurse. When Sharona returned in season 8, she had re-divorced her husband, and was an administrator at a veterans hospital in New Jersey.\n\nIn Mr Monk and Sharona, Sharona and Randy started a relationship, seeming to have picked up on the flirting banter they had shared during the first 3 seasons on Monk. It was revealed in Mr. Monk and the End that Randy had spent 2 weeks visiting Sharona, and that he had accepted a job as Police Chief of Summit New Jersey and had found a home to share with Sharona.\n\nMonk was in a catatonic state for three and a half years until Sharona began taking care of him. Monk was able to resume detective work and remarked, \"When she found me, I was drowning. She saved my life.\" The series started a while after she took the assistant's job, and just how she got it and what their early relationship was are never explained, although it is revealed that Captain Stottlemeyer originally arranged her as a nurse for Monk.\n\nWhen Monk becomes a consulting detective, It is revealed in the novel Mr. Monk on Patrol, that one of the criteria that the SFPD had for employing Monk as a consultant was that he had to have Sharona with him, in case he has a breakdown. Sharona helps out, sometimes doing independent investigations and sometimes even using her sex appeal to get information that Monk cannot. She also does all kinds of things that Monk's OCD and phobias prevent him from doing as she has few such reservations herself. However, in the season 2 episode \"Mr. Monk Goes to the Circus,\" Sharona is revealed to have a fear of elephants, due to seeing a girl falling into an elephant pit when she was seven years old. She takes up smoking after Monk reacts insensitively to her fear of elephants, telling her to \"suck it up\".\n\nSharona drives a tan 1990 Volvo 740 GLE Wagon, which in \"Mr. Monk and the 12th Man\" is shown to have 100,000 miles. The counter says 99,999, prompting Monk to move the car forwards and backwards until the number is even while staking out Henry Small's house.\n\nShe has 'quit' her job as Monk's assistant at least twice; in the episode \"Mr. Monk and the Candidate\" and \"Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger\" (this was due to a pay dispute (her paychecks had bounced regularly); she temporarily got a job at a lamp store). Sharona's 'quitting' became a running gag in the show, until she finally left in 2004 to remarry her ex-husband, Trevor Howe, following \"Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine\". This was because Bitty Schram quit the show over contract disputes. Subsequently, Traylor Howard was introduced as Natalie Teeger, Monk's new assistant, beginning in \"Mr. Monk and the Red Herring\".\n\nSharona is mentioned again after her character left the show in \"Mr. Monk Is On the Run (Part Two)\", having sent flowers for the \"deceased\" Monk and flying in with Benjy to attend his funeral.\n\nSharona made a special guest appearance in Mr. Monk and Sharona, in season 8, in order to meet her lawyer about a lawsuit involving her uncle, Howard Fleming. In this episode she explained what she had been doing since she left. She meets Natalie Teeger, Monk's new assistant, and it seems that they are going to get along until it is revealed that Monk paid Sharona $20 a week more than Natalie. Later, they begin to bicker about assisting styles, the settlement money, etc., The two women later reconcile their differences and note that each woman was just what Monk needed at the time they worked for him, and that Sharona's seeming toughness got Monk to a place where he didn't need a full-time nurse at his side. There was also a surprise hug between Monk and Sharona, which shows the first time Monk has returned a hug given by anyone, and also a surprise kiss between Randy Disher, whom Sharona regularly traded teasing barbs and banter in the first 2.5 seasons.\n\nIn Mr. Monk and the End, it is revealed that Randy spent 2 weeks on vacation, having landed in Newark, New Jersey (where Sharona lives), and that he and Sharona had found a home which they would share when Randy moves to New Jersey sometime after Monk's last case.\n\nA recurring joke during Sharona's tenure on the series is her love life. Despite her astuteness in both helping Monk navigate his life and in assisting him in solving homicide investigations, her judgment regarding potential romantic partners for herself is remarkably poor. Besides Trevor, other men she dates include an architect who turns out be the secret streaker who is interrupting Stottlemeyer and Disher's press conferences (\"Mr. Monk and the Red-Headed Stranger\"), a mob enforcer (\"Mr. Monk Meets the Godfather\"), several married men, and sometimes the very murderer who Monk is investigating. The seeming common denominator between these and many other men is a compulsive inability to be honest with her.\n\nIn \"Mr. Monk and the Red Herring\", (season 3.10) it is revealed that Sharona had left to return to Jersey with her son, add that she had remarried her ex-husband, Trevor. In \"Mr. Monk and Sharona\", it is revealed that she and Trevor had divorced again, and that it was probably best for both of them. In this episode, she also begins her relationship with Lt. Randy Disher, with whom she had regularly had questionably flirtatious verbal banter. At the end of \"Mr. Monk and the End\", it was shown that Randy and Sharona had found a home together in New Jersey. In some of the later novels, starting with \"Mr. Monk is on Patrol\", her relationship with Randy is fleshed out a bit more.\n\nBitty Schram returned to play Sharona as a guest star in the season 8 episode \"Mr. Monk and Sharona\". In this episode, Sharona returns to San Francisco after the death of her little-known uncle Howard Fleming (who Monk believes, correctly, was murdered). A primary subplot of the episode is the way in which Monk is torn between Natalie's methods and Sharona's. Sharona mentions during the episode that she and Trevor have separated permanently, and that Benjy is currently making plans to attend college. It is hinted that Sharona and Randy may be dating. In the final episode of the series, Randy moves to Summit, New Jersey to live with Sharona.\n\nLee Goldberg's novel \"Mr. Monk and the Two Assistants\" has Sharona returning to San Francisco after Trevor is arrested for allegedly murdering a UCLA professor. Sharona goes back to her position as a registered nurse. Monk and Natalie meet her when they bring Julie to the hospital to be treated for a broken wrist. Sharona plans to return to work with Monk and thus results in open hostility between her and Natalie.\n\nEventually, Monk discovers that Trevor had been framed for the murder. After Monk exonerates him, and Sharona and Natalie—who also have been framed by Ian Ludlow, the real killer—Sharona goes back to Trevor. By this point, Sharona and Natalie have become friends and Sharona is sure Monk is in good hands, thus serving more closure than on the television series. The novel ends with Sharona moving back to Los Angeles with Trevor and Benjy, leaving her character in a better position to be able to return into Adrian's life, e.g. visits, than it would if her character was in New Jersey, perhaps hinting at a possible return of her character. The events of the book run somewhat contrary to how her return was later depicted in \"Mr. Monk and Sharona\", although some elements of the novel, like Natalie and Sharona's open hostility towards each other, are adapted over. Both of these crossovers highlight the differences between Natalie and Sharona - Natalie tends to be more accepting of Monk's compulsions whereas Sharona tries to force Monk to adapt.\n\nAnother Goldberg mystery, \"Mr. Monk On Patrol\", involves her significant other, Disher, act as mayor for several months. Summit has undergone a terrible wave of crime. But, as the San Franciscans grow to be a little hostile to Adrian Monk, Summit's police department (which consists of six men) calls for Monk to solve homicides for a week. Sharona flies to San Francisco to escort Monk and Natalie, whom she had grown hostile with in the earlier Monk episode, to Newark.\n"}

He is the former Mayor of San Diego and former Chief of Police. As of December 2012, he is the president and CEO of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce.\n\nSanders was born 1950 in San Pedro in Los Angeles, California. His alma maters are San Diego Miramar College, San Diego State University, and National University. He was also a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity while at San Diego State. Sanders lives in the Kensington neighborhood of San Diego with his wife Rana Sampson. He has two daughters, Lisa and Jamie. His brother, Tom Sanders, was an Oscar nominated production designer.\n\nDuring his senior year at San Diego State University, Jerry Sanders became a police officer with the San Diego Police Department. He served in the police department from 1973 until 1999, and served as Chief of Police from 1993 until 1999. As chief of police, Sanders and the department's employees gained national recognition for work with community policing and achieving a 40% decrease in crime, including a 67% drop in murders during his six-year term as chief. Sanders also re-organized the department, making it more responsive to the community, reaching out to neighborhoods, and utilizing more than 1,000 volunteers to address San Diego's public safety needs. Prior to his assignments as division commander, police captain, Sanders, then police lieutenant, was the police academy commander at the San Diego Criminal Justice Training Center - Police Academy at Miramar College.\n\nHe was commander of the San Diego SWAT team during the 1984 San Ysidro McDonald's massacre, and his management of the tragedy, which resulted in twenty-one deaths, earned him criticism from the city's Mexican-American community. As a result, the newspaper La Prensa San Diego called Sanders \"unfit to be mayor.\" \n\nSanders left the Police Department in 1999 to become president and CEO of the United Way of San Diego County. He also served as United Way Community Campaign Chair in 2002.\n\nIn July 2002, Sanders was appointed to the board of the American Red Cross San Diego/Imperial Counties Chapter after the previous CEO was fired in the aftermath of controversy concerning a wildfire in Alpine, CA. Sanders helped recruit retired Navy Rear Admiral Ronne Froman to be CEO, and supported the turnaround of the local chapter, which resulted in support for victims of the Cedar wildfire, praise from former critics for the transparency of fund raising efforts, and a staff re-organization that substantially reduced overhead costs.\n\nSanders had also been active in the private sector, serving as founding partner and consultant for local high-tech start-ups involved with homeland security and infrastructure assessment. He is currently board chair of the San Diego Police Foundation, established to raise private funds for SDPD equipment and programs. He serves on the board of STAR/PAL, the San Diego Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, San Diego State University's Dean's Advisory Board, and Coronado First Bank (in organization).

He received 54% of the vote against city council member Donna Frye. Sanders was the first mayor under San Diego's \"strong mayor system\" of city government. Sanders is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino. Coincidentally, when Bloomberg left the Republican Party in 2007, San Diego became the largest U.S. city with a Republican mayor.\n\nOn September 19, 2007, Sanders abruptly reversed his public opposition to same-sex marriage before signing a City Council resolution aimed at overturning the state's ban on same-sex weddings. He gave a tearful speech in which he explained that he could not tell his daughter Lisa, who is gay, that her relationship with a partner is not as important as that of a straight couple and that he had \"decided to lead with my heart...to take a stand on behalf of equality and social justice.\"\n\nSanders won reelection over businessman Steve Francis in 2008. He left office on December 3, 2012 due to term limits. The next day he became the president and CEO of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\n"}

Within its range, it is an important cause of snakebite. The specific name, \"alternatus\", which is Latin for \"alternating\", is apparently a reference to the staggered markings along the body. No subspecies are currently recognized.\n\nLarge and stout, this terrestrial species reportedly exceeds in total length, although the verified maximum is . Most specimens are in total length, with females being significantly longer and heavier than males.\n\nThe scalation includes 25-35 (usually 27-31/29-33 in males/females) rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 155-183/164-190 ventral scales in males/females, and 38-53/30-44 subcaudal scales in males/females. On the head there are 8-13 strongly keeled intersupraocular scales, 8-10 supralabial scales, none of which are fused with the prelacunal, and 12-14 sublabial scales.\n\nThe color pattern is exceedingly variable. The ground color may be brown, tan or gray, sometimes with an olive cast. The top of the head is usually chocolate brown to almost black with a range of transverse and longitudinal tan to white markings.It looks like a boa constrictor.\n\nOn the body, there is a series of 22-28 dorsolateral markings that are chocolate brown to black in color and boldly bordered in cream or white. Along the vertebral line, these markings may either oppose or alternate. Each marking is widened and invaded from underneath by the paler ground color so that it either looks like a cross, encloses a darker blotch, or divides the marking into three parts to give it the shape of a headphone. On the tail, the pattern fuses to form a zigzag pattern. In some specimens, the pattern is so concentrated that there is no difference in color between the markings and the interspaces. The ventral surface includes a dark brown to black stripe that starts at the neck and runs down to the tail tip. Aberrant specimens, described by Lema (1960, 1987), had dark dorsal stripes running down the length of the body.\n\n\"Urutu\", \"wutu\", crossed pit viper. The common names \"urutu\" and \"wutu\" refer to the crescent markings on the body.\n\nIn Argentina, it is referred to as \"víbora de la cruz\" and \"yarará grande\". In Brazil it is called \"boicoatiara\", \"boicotiara\" (Tupi dialect), \"coatiara\", \"cotiara\" (southern Brazil), \"cruzeira\", \"cruzeiro\", \"jararaca de agosto\" (Rio Grande do Sul, Lagoa dos Patos region), \"jararaca rabo-de-porco\" (Rio Grande do Sul), and \"urutu\". In Paraguay it is called \"mbói-cuatiá\", \"mbói-kwatiara\" (Gí dialect), and \"yarará acácusú\" (Guaraní dialect). In Uruguay it is referred to as \"crucera\", \"víbora de la cruz\" and \"yarará\".\n\nFound in southeastern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and northern Argentina. In Argentina it is found in the provinces of Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Córdoba, Corrientes, Chaco, Entre Ríos, Formosa, La Pampa, Misiones, San Luis, Santa Fe, Santiago del Estero and Tucumán. The type locality is listed as \"Amérique méridionale\" and \"Paraguay.\"\n\nOccurs in tropical and semitropical forests, as well as temperate deciduous forests. According to Gallardo (1977), it prefers marshes, low-lying swamps, riparian zones and other humid habitats. It is also said to be common in sugarcane plantations. It is found in a variety of habitats depending on the latitude, including open fields and rocky areas in the Sierra de Achiras in Córdoba and the Sierra de la Ventana in Buenos Aires in Argentina, fluvial areas, grasslands and cerrado. However, it is usually absent in dry environments.\n\nFemales, depending on their size, give birth to varying numbers of live young. Leitão de Araujo and Ely (1980) reported on two litters that had average weights of and and average total lengths of and , with captive females giving birth to 3-12 young. Cardinale and Avila (1997) collected one female in 1995 that was found to contain 26 embryos. Haller and Martins (1999) determined that the species produces 1-24 offspring at a time. Neonates are identical to the adults, except that they are more brightly colored. Neonates are capable of a venomous strike immediately when they are born.\nAn important cause of snakebite within its range, bites are rarely fatal but frequently cause severe local tissue damage. Although Spix and Martius (1824) found that it had a reputation for being one of the most venomous snakes in Brazil, its bite \"\"said to occasion almost certain death\"\", the statistics tell a different story. In his survey of 6,601 snakebite cases in Central and South America, Fonseca (1949) found that 384 were attributed to this species and that, of that number, only eight were fatal (2%).\n\nIn a study by Baub \"et al.\" (1994) of the case histories of 32 patients bitten by this species and admitted to the hospital in Catanduva, São Paulo, Brazil, all developed local pain and swelling. Furthermore, in 97% of all cases the blood clotting time was prolonged (more than 12 minutes), 41% had bleeding (usually from the gums), 32% had local blistering and 9% had necrosis. In all cases, specific antivenin was used and there were no deaths. These findings contrast with other reports involving much more tissue damage. Silva Jr. (1956) includes a description of a Brazilian patient with gangrene on the hand and forearm that required amputation, as well as another bitten four years previously who had scarring over the anterior tibial compartment. Abalos and Pirosky (1963) considered this species to be responsible for many of the total number of snakebite cases in Argentina and included a picture of a young boy, bitten below the knee, with the bare fibula and tibia exposed. In 2004, a 44-year-old woman died from a bleed in the brain after getting bitten at her home.\n\n"}

It is named after a golf course \"Los Serranos Golf Course\" within the east-central end of the Chino Hills city limits, near the Chino Valley Freeway (SR 71). The U.S. Census reported Los Serranos as a separate place in the 1990 Census until the low income region was incorporated by the city of Chino Hills on December 1, 1991. Los Serranos Golf Course failed in the stock crash of the late 20s leaving a subdivision divided into narrow golf course bungalows behind. The average lot width is 30 feet. The subdivision within the City of Chino Hills is located in western San Bernardino County, California. The ZIP code serving the neighborhood is 91709.\n\nLos Serranos loosely means \"the hill-dwellers\" in Spanish. Various translations include \"highlanders,\" \"mountaineers,\" or \"men of the hills.\" The area is also the homeland of the Serrano tribe of Native Americans, given that name by Spanish missionaries.\n\nThe Greening family owned the golf course and put in the sewer system as part of the original water works well before most of the properties were developed. Greening also owned Dam Number 808 which routinely flooded areas below it until former State Senator Ruben Ayala put in a flood control channel at the personal expense of landowners affected by Greening's flooding. Apparently Greening was not required to contribute, even though the flood control channel was a requirement for the dam licensing of 1936 or so. Christine Arias is the mayor of the Los Serranos sub division.\n\nLos Serranos is a substandard lot size subdivision within the city of Chino Hills. It is further divided by locals into two sections known locally as \"Upper\" and \"Lower\" Los Serranos. The line of Demarcation between the two areas is Ramona Avenue. The Eastern part is \"Lower\" Los Serranos because it was subjected to flooding until very recently, whereas Western areas of Los Serranos are known as \"Upper\" Los Serranos due to general lack of flooding. Houses along the rim of the Los Serrannos Golf Course have narrow lots and are not well maintained, and suffer from errant golf balls. Lower Los Serranos is defined by Joyce and George Butler who run Support Our Area Residents (S.O.A.R.) a non registered public charity from their home. Jimme (Lundsford) Butler on April 3, 2010 at 5:30 pm for which they have been awarded the status of Community Heroes of 2007 by the Pomona Fairground and City of Chino Hills and the local newspaper, Chino Champion publications.\nA third community within Los Serranos is the Greening-run 'retirement' mobile home park area which surrounds Lake Los Serranos, dam number 808.\n\nLos Serranos, like the rest of Chino Hills, is deliberately residential because the city council rejected the idea of businesses in the city limits. Its original housing supported the staff and guests at The Los Serranos Golf and Country Club prior to the 1950s. Very few businesses have persisted in the area. There is the decades-old Descanso Market on Descanso Street which is the sole surviving business in Upper Los Serranos, which is the area's only Post Office center. One block away there was a fast food hamburger joint that closed down in the 60s/70s and is now the site of two houses. Next to the market is the local voting location. There are two churches in Upper Los Serranos; one focusing on local Asian population and one, the former American Legion post, predominantly appeals to the local Hispanics living in the area. In Lower Los Serranos there is one church. Lower Los Serranos also has one liquor store referred to as The Country Store; this store has also served the local residents for decades. It once had an exit from the Chino Valley (71) Freeway, making it easy for snacks and gasoline pit stops from a Cheveron that once existed across the store. This Country Store also provided bait for the local fishermen of Prado Park Lake. The Los Serranos Golf and Country Club is the predominate business in Lower Los Serranos which still provides some jobs to local residents.\n\n\nThere are 2 schools located within Los Serranos—the Alternative Education Center and Chaparral Elementary School. The Alternative Education Center occupies the site of the former Los Serranos Elementary School, which closed following the 2008-2009 academic year. Located on the west end of Los Serranos at 15650 Pipeline Avenue, this site is \"technically\" located in the Chino Hills community of Glenmeade but as it faces the Los Serranos area and typically serves students from Los Serranos, it has locally been considered part of Los Serranos. The Alternative Education Center reopened in fall 2010 with a variety of programs, including a virtual high-school with online programs, independent studies, Chino Valley Learning Academy, Workforce Initiative Program and a variety of other programs. A more recent school is Chaparral Elementary, located on the east end of Los Serranos, opened in August 2006. \nBoth schools in Los Serranos are part of the Chino Valley Unified School District.\n"}

They were known as \"Sikken\" (Sik in singular, goats) by rail enthusiasts and \"locomotor\" by railway staff. Fifteen of these locomotives were rebuilt with a retractable crane. Many are preserved; regular service has stopped a few years ago. \n\nThere is a well-known and accurate H0 scale model offered in various liveries by Roco.\n\nThe design and operation was based on the simplest of things, which in effect made them very reliable. The locomotive was operated by design from the outside (side of engine) and wasn't equipped with a dead man device to stop the locomotive automatically in case of incapacity of the operator. There were two manual brakes: a handle and a foot brake. As the handle could be moved by in-train forces while dead-heading it was required to be fixed by a nut and bolt. Upon taking the locomotive into service again, it was necessary to loosen the nut and bolt. In some cases this was forgotten and the result was that the operator couldn't brake; many Siks have suffered collision damage due to this.\n\nA special design was implemented for coolant; the fuel tank with diesel was also the coolant for the engine. The theory was that the coolant would never be exhausted while the locomotive is in use.\n\nThe locomotive didn't have an air pressure system. To obtain a whistle a device was put on top of the exhaust to use the flow of exhaust gases as the whistle air. This resulted in a very characteristic whistle sound (to imitate the sound, whistle a high-pitched tone while making a rolling R sound).\n\nThis locomotive was mainly operated as a shunter. Only a very few fully qualified train engineers/drivers have held a locomotor license.\n"}

He was therefore closely connected with the court, enjoying, at least initially, the favor of Alexander.\n\nAlthough a rabbi by profession, the omission of such an epithet when referred to in rabbinic literature is said to attest to his greatness as a rabbinic Sage, ranking with Hillel.\n\nThe Shim'on ben Shatah Street in the center of Jerusalem carries his name.\n\nDuring the reign of Alexander the Sanhedrin consisted almost entirely of Sadducees; nevertheless Simeon succeeded in ousting some of the Sadducean members and in replacing them with Pharisees. Having accomplished this, Simeon recalled from Alexandria, Egypt the Pharisees who had been compelled to seek refuge there during the reign of Alexander Jannæus, among these fugitives being Joshua ben Perachya, the former Nasi. Joshua was elected president anew, and Simeon assumed the office of vice-president. Upon the death of Joshua, Simeon became president and Judah ben Tabbai vice-president.\nThe attitude of Alexander Jannæus toward the Pharisees, however, soon underwent a change; and they were again compelled to flee, even Simeon himself being obliged to go into hiding. About this time certain Parthian envoys came to Alexander's court and were invited to the king's table, where they noticed the absence of Simeon, by whose wisdom they had profited at previous visits. Upon the king's assurance that he would do the fugitive no harm, the queen caused her brother to return to the court. Upon his reappearance Simeon took his place between the royal couple with a show of self-consciousness which surprised the king; whereupon Simeon remarked, \"The wisdom which I serve grants me equal rank with kings.\"\n\nDuring Simeon ben Shetach's tenure as head of the Sanhedrin, the court ceased to exact fines in monetary suits (Hebrew: \"dinei mamonot\") as prescribed in the Law of Moses. It was also during his tenure that he enacted the rule of conduct that an [Israelite] king is not to judge, neither are men to judge him, because of an incident that occurred with one of King Janneus' servants who had committed murder.\n\nAfter Simeon returned, he enjoyed the king's favor. Upon the king's death, Queen Alexandra succeeded to the rulership; and Simeon and his party, the Pharisees, obtained great influence. Together with his colleague, Judah ben Tabbai, Simeon began to supersede the Sadducean teachings and to re-establish the authority of the Pharisaic interpretation of the Torah. He is therefore called \"the restorer of the Law,\" who \"has given back to the crown of learning its former brightness\". Simeon discarded the penal code which the Sadducees had introduced as a supplement to the biblical code; and almost all the teachings and principles introduced by him are aimed against the Sadducean interpretation of the Law. Of Simeon's enactments two were of especial importance. One consisted in the restriction of divorces, which were then of frequent occurrence. Simeon arranged that the husband might use the prescribed marriage gift (\"ketubah\") in his business, but that his entire fortune should be held liable for it. Inasmuch as a husband of small means could ill afford to withdraw a sum of money from his business, Simeon's ruling tended to check hasty divorces. The other important act referred to the instruction of the young.\n\nUp to Simeon's time there were no schools in Judea, and the instruction of children was, according to biblical precepts, left to their fathers. Simeon ordered that yeshivot be established in the larger cities in which the young might receive instruction in the Holy Scriptures as well as in the traditional knowledge of the Law.\n\nIn a significant case of an early witch-hunt, on a single day Simeon ben Shetach's court sentenced to death eighty women in Ashkelon who had been charged with sorcery. The relatives of these women, filled with a desire for revenge, brought similarly false witnesses against Simeon's son, whom they accused of a crime which involved capital punishment; and as a result of this charge he was sentenced to death. While on the way to the place of execution, the witnesses recanted their testimony. Simeon ben Shetach sought to have the case reopened. Simeon's son protested that, according to the Law, a witness must not be believed when he withdraws a former statement, and he said to his father, \"If you seek to bring about salvation, then consider me as a threshold [towards that goal].\" The execution then proceeded. This event may have been the reason why Simeon issued a warning that witnesses should always be carefully cross-questioned.\n\nSimeon's fairness toward gentiles is illustrated by the following narrative: Simeon lived in humble circumstances, supporting himself and his family by conducting a small business in linen goods. Once his pupils presented him with a donkey which they had purchased from a gentile merchant. Using the legal formula prescribed by the Talmud, they said \"When we pay you, this donkey and everything on it is ours.\" After receiving the gift, Simeon removed the saddle and discovered a costly jewel. The students joyously told their master that he might now cease toiling since the proceeds from the jewel would make him wealthy - the legal formula of the sale meant that the jewel was now his property. Simeon, however, replied that even though the letter of the law said they were right, it was clear that the seller had no intention of selling the jewel along with the animal. Simeon returned the gem to the merchant, who exclaimed, \"Praised be the God of Simeon ben Shetach!\"\n\nBe diligent when inquiring of the witnesses, and be careful of your words, lest thereby they learn to lie.\n\n"}

It was opened in November 1887 and was known as the Mentone Coffee Palace. The Coffee Palace was the social centre of the town, situated on the corners of Mentone Parade, Florence Street and Como Parade. It is also near Mentone station (formerly known as Balcombe Road Station until 1884) and is surrounded by the local shops. In the 1890s due to competition with Mentone Hotel and the Depression, the Coffee Palace could no longer be run. In 1894 it fell into the hands of the Mercantile Bank of Australia, and the name of the building was changed to Como House. After this the Coffee Palace was only used occasionally for varying purposes. The Brigidine Sisters bought the Coffee Palace in mid-July 1904 for £2,050, considering the actual cost of the building and furniture, excluding land, was £25,500.\n\nOn 7 August 1904 the Brigidine Convent School was officially opened and blessed by Archbishop Thomas Carr, and classes began the next day.

The fee-paying convent school began taking boarders in 1905 and subsequently obtained registration as a sub-primary, primary and secondary school. The nuns owned a farm in nearby Johnston street which the students often visited. Boarders and students of primary school age have been phased out; the final primary class being in 1978. The school has been single sex (girls) for many decades. In the 1930s the school's name was changed to Kilbreda College, the name coming from the Gaelic Cill – church or community and Breda – Brigid.

It is named after Saint Columba, the missionary monk from County Donegal who founded a monastery in the area. The college was originally built to educate young people into the priesthood, but now educates young people in a variety of things.\n\nSt Columb's College was established in 1879 on Bishop Street (now the site of Lumen Christi College), but later moved to Buncrana Road in the suburbs of the city.\n\nSt Columb's College was preceded by several failed attempts to create such an institution in Derry. Repeated but sporadic efforts were made to maintain a seminary for almost a century; at Clady, near Strabane, in the late eighteenth century, at Ferguson's Lane in Derry in the early nineteenth century and at Pump Street (first reference to St Columb's College as such) in the city from 1841 to 1864.\n\nSt Columb's finally opened its doors on 3 November 1879 with two priest teachers, Dr Edward O'Brien and Dr John Hassan. The school was considered to be quite large at the time and was expected to accommodate 20–30 boarders. The school quickly gained a reputation for academic achievement. On 18 September 1931 the \"Derry Journal\" listed St Columb's College's academic results. They were as follows;\nTwo University Scholarships,\nThree Exhibitions and Prizes,\nSix Calls in King's Scholarship Exam (calls to teacher training),\nTwo Pupil Teacherships,\nEight regional Committee Scholarships,\n31 Passed Matriculation,\n26 Passed Senior Leaving Cert. Exam,\n52 Passed Junior Leaving Cert. Exam.\nThe results were impressive for a young and regional school but they were testimony to the scholarship that was taking place at St Columb's.\n\nOne of the most notable \"alumni\" of St Columb's College, John Hume, noted, \"When the history of St. Columb's College in this century is written, it will be clear that one of its major transformations, if not its major transformation, took place as a result of the Eleven Plus examination.\"\nThe Education Act, 1947, provided for free secondary education to all throughout the United Kingdom. Entry to St. Columb's College, a Grammar school, would be determined by one's performance in the 11-plus or Transfer Test. The immediate result was an explosion in pupil numbers, a shortfall in teaching staff and greater pressure on existing resources. In 1941 the student body numbered 263. By 1960 the number stood at 770 with a teaching staff of 35. In under twenty years the school's size had tripled. It was now clear that additional facilities would be needed.\nIn September 1973 St. Columb's College opened a new campus on the Buncrana Road in the city. The new site would cater for the senior years; its initial enrolment was of 900. The new building was designed by Frank Corr of Corr & McCormick and constructed by J Kennedy & Co. The total cost was £762,000. This figure does not include the £56,000 spent employing W & J McMonagle Ltd to construct the playing fields.\n\nThe school has a long and successful sporting history, with its students competing in many events across the country. It has excelled in soccer, Gaelic football, basketball and has produced many athletes.\n\nThe school claims two Nobel laureates amongst its alumni. They are:\n\nThe college's former pupils association makes an annual award (the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award) to \"a past-pupil who has achieved something of major significance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field\".\nNotable winners of the award are as follows:\nOther alumni and names associated with St Columb's include:\nSt Columb's featured in the film \"The Boys of St.Columb's\" made by West Park Pictures and Maccana Teoranta for RTÉ.

In 1629, aged 12, she was living at Batavia in Java under the protection of Jan Coen, governor of the Dutch East Indies, and Eva Ment. There she fell in love with 15-year-old Pieter Cortenhoeff, a Eurasian standard-bearer in the VOC army, and was found making love to him in Coen's private apartment.

Along with its sister titles, \"The Haunt of Fear\" and \"The Vault of Horror\", \"Tales from the Crypt\" was popular, but in the late 1940s and early 1950s comic books came under attack from parents, clergymen, schoolteachers and others who believed the books contributed to illiteracy and juvenile delinquency. In April and June 1954, highly publicized congressional subcommittee hearings on the effects of comic books upon children left the industry shaken. With the subsequent imposition of a highly restrictive Comics Code, EC Comics publisher Bill Gaines cancelled \"Tales from the Crypt\" and its two companion horror titles, along with the company's remaining crime and science fiction series in September 1954. All EC titles have been reprinted at various times since their demise, and stories from the horror series have been adapted for television and film.\n\nHorror comics emerged as a distinct comic book genre after World War II when young adult males lost interest in caped crimebusters, and returning GIs wanted titillating sex and violence in their reading. One-shot \"Eerie\" (1947) is generally considered the first true horror comic, with its cover depicting a dagger-wielding, red-eyed ghoul threatening a rope-bound, scantily clad, voluptuous young woman beneath a full moon. In 1948, \"Adventures Into the Unknown\" became the first regularly published horror title, enjoying a nearly two decade life-span.\nIn 1950, EC publisher Gaines and his editor Al Feldstein discovered they shared similar tastes in horror and began experimenting with horror tales in their crime titles. \"Tales from the Crypt\" traces its origin to a Feldstein story, \"Return from the Grave!\", in EC's \"Crime Patrol\" (#15, December 1949/January 1950) with the Crypt-Keeper making his debut as host. Issue #16 featured more horror tales than crime stories, and, with issue #17, the title changed from \"Crime Patrol\" to \"The Crypt of Terror\". Due to an attempt to save money on second-class postage permits, the numbering did not change with the title and continued as \"The Crypt of Terror\" for the next two issues.\n\n\"Tales from the Crypt\" debuted with issue #20 (October/November 1950), producing a total of 27 issues (excluding the initial three issues, #17-19, published as \"The Crypt of Terror\"), before ceasing publication with its February/March 1955 issue (#46).\n\nIn 1954, Gaines and Feldstein intended to add a fourth book to their horror publications by reactivating an earlier title, \"The Crypt of Terror\". They were stopped dead in their tracks, however. Following the publication of Fredric Wertham's \"Seduction of the Innocent\", horror and other violent comics had come under scrutiny by parents, schoolteachers, clergymen, psychologists, and others who viewed the material as dangerous to the well-being of children and a significant contributor to the juvenile delinquency crisis in America. Matters came to a head in April and June 1954 with a highly publicized Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency. Hearings targeted violent comic books—which fared poorly in the proceedings. While the committee stopped short of blaming the comics industry for juvenile delinquency, they did suggest it tone down the product. Publishers were left reeling.\n\nThe industry deftly avoided outside censorship by creating the self-regulatory Comics Magazine Association of America (CMAA) and a Comics Code Authority (CCA) that placed severe restrictions on violent comic book genres. Publishers were forbidden from using the words \"terror\" and \"horror\" in titles, for example, and forbidden from depicting zombies, werewolves, and other gruesome characters and outré horror fiction trappings. Gaines was fed up; he believed his titles were being specifically targeted and realized they were doomed to future failure. He threw in the towel, canceling \"Tales from the Crypt\" and its companion titles in September 1954. Since an issue of \"The Crypt of Terror\" had already been produced, it was published as the final issue of \"Tales from the Crypt\", February/March 1955.\n\n\"Tales from the Crypt\" has been reprinted on numerous occasions. Ballantine Books reprinted selected \"Crypt\" stories in a series of paperback EC anthologies in 1964-66. The magazine was fully collected in a series of five black-and-white hardbacks by publisher Russ Cochran as part of \"The Complete EC Library\" in 1979. Cochran (in association with Gladstone Publishing and solo) reprinted a handful of single color issues in 1990/91. Between September 1992 and December 1999, Cochran and Gemstone Publishing reprinted the full 30 individual issues. This complete run was later rebound, with covers included, in a series of six softcover \"EC Annuals\". In 2007, Cochran and Gemstone began to publish hardcover, re-colored volumes of \"Tales from the Crypt\" as part of the \"EC Archives\" series. Three volumes (of a projected five) were published before Gemstone's financial troubles left the project in limbo. The project was then revived under a new publisher, Dark Horse Comics, which has resumed it with the release of \"Tales from the Crypt Volume 4\" in October 2013 and \"Tales from the Crypt Volume 5\" in November 2014.\n\nIn 2007, Papercutz, an independent comics publisher managed by former Marvel Comics editor Jim Salicrup, began running a new series of original \"Tales from the Crypt\" comics. The new version was announced at the year's New York Comic Con. The first issue was published in June 2007, with a cover drawn by Kyle Baker. All three of EC Comics' horror hosts (The GhouLunatics) appear in the issue, drawn by Rick Parker (artist of Marvel/MTV's \"Beavis and Butt-Head Comic Book\"). Contributors to subsequent issues have included well-known horror talents Joe R. Lansdale and his brother John L. Lansdale, Don McGregor, husband and wife team James Romberger and Marguerite Van Cook, Mort Todd, and Chris Noeth. The new version has a smaller digest size with a graphic novel style book binding. Controversy erupted in 2008 when Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin was featured on a cover attacking the horror hosts with a hockey stick, published with a letter from William Gaines' daughter Cathy Gaines Mifsud commenting on censorship.\n\nAs of today, there have been a total of 13 issues (9 graphic novels) published by Papercutz, with the last issue being published September 28, 2010.\n\nIn 2016, Super Genius Comics would relaunch \"Tales from the Crypt\" for two issues.\n\nEarly front covers were created by Feldstein, Johnny Craig and Wally Wood, with the remaining covers (1952–55) by Jack Davis. The contributing interior artists were Craig, Feldstein, Wood, Davis, George Evans, Jack Kamen, Graham Ingels, Harvey Kurtzman, Al Williamson, Joe Orlando, Reed Crandall, Bernard Krigstein, Will Elder, Fred Peters and Howard Larsen. Jack Davis took over the art for the Crypt-Keeper stories with (#24, June/July, 1951), and continued as the title's lead artist for the rest of the run. Feldstein devised the Crypt-Keeper's origin story \"Lower Berth!\" (#33) which was illustrated by Davis. Issue #38 was one of two covers from EC's horror comics censored prior to publication. While \"The Vault of Horror\" cover for issue #32 was restored in Russ Cochran's EC Library reprints, the \"Tales from the Crypt\" cover remained censored. \"Kamen's Kalamity\" (#31) starred many members of the EC staff, including Gaines, Feldstein and the story's artist, Kamen. Ingels, Davis and Craig also made cameo appearances in the story in single panels which they drew themselves.\n\nAs with the other EC comics edited by Feldstein, the stories in this comic were primarily based on Gaines reading a large number of horror stories and using them to develop \"springboards\" from which he and Feldstein could launch new stories. Specific story influences that have been identified include the following:\n\n\nAfter their unauthorized adaptation of one of Ray Bradbury's stories in another magazine, Bradbury contacted EC about their plagiarism of his work. They reached an agreement for EC to do authorized versions of Bradbury's short fiction. These official adaptations include:\n\n\nAlthough EC's horror stable consisted of three separate magazines, there was little beyond their titles to distinguish them. Each magazine had its titular host, but the hosting duties for any one issue were typically shared with the hosts of the other two. Thus, a single issue of \"Tales from the Crypt\" would contain two stories told by the Crypt-Keeper, one by the Vault-Keeper (of \"The Vault of Horror\") and one by the Old Witch (of \"The Haunt of Fear\"). The professional rivalry among these three GhouLunatics was often played for comic effect.\n\nThe Crypt-Keeper was the primary host of \"Tales from the Crypt\". He was introduced to the public in \"Crime Patrol\" #15, and he continued with that magazine through its changes in title and format. He was a frightening presence in those early issues, a sinister hermit sitting framed in the lightless crypt's half-open door, his face all but hidden by the double curtain of his long white hair. But he soon evolved into a more comedic horror host, delivering an irreverent and pun-filled commentary to lighten the horrific tone of the stories he introduced.\n\nThe Crypt-Keeper's duties were not limited to hosting. He would occasionally appear as a character as well, and these appearances give the reader a glimpse of his biography. \"The Lower Berth\" (\"Tales from the Crypt\" #33) gives an account of the circumstances surrounding his birth. \"While the Cat's Away\" (\"The Vault of Horror\" #34) conducts a tour of his house above and below ground. \"Horror beneath the Streets\" (\"The Haunt of Fear\" #17) tells how he and his fellow GhouLunatics got their EC publishing contracts.\n\nThe Crypt-Keeper also served as the host of EC's 3-D comic book, \"Three Dimensional Tales from the Crypt of Terror\".\n\nThe 1972 film from Amicus Productions features five stories from various EC comics. \"Reflection of Death\" (#23) and \"Blind Alleys\" (#46) were adapted for the film, the others were adapted from \"The Haunt of Fear\" and \"The Vault of Horror\". A second Amicus film, \"The Vault of Horror\", also used stories from \"Tales from the Crypt\" and \"Shock SuspenStories\" (despite its title, it did not use any stories published in the \"Vault of Horror\" comic). An homage film entitled \"Creepshow\" followed, paying tribute to the tone, look, and feel of \"Tales from the Crypt\" and other EC comics, without directly adapting any of the stories.\n\nIn 1989, the book was adapted into the HBO TV series \"Tales from the Crypt\", which features John Kassir as the Cryptkeeper and included comic book covers designed to look like the original 1950s covers by Mike Vosburg with at least one drawn by Shawn McManus.\n\nThe following tales were used in HBO's \"Tales from the Crypt\" television series: \"The Man Who Was Death\" (issue #17), \"Mute Witness to Murder\" (#18), \"Fatal Caper\" (#20), \"The Thing From The Grave\" (#22), \"Last Respects\" (#23), \"Judy, You're Not Yourself Today\" (#25), \"Loved to Death\" (#25), \"Well Cooked Hams\" (#27), \"The Ventriloquist's Dummy\" (#28), \"Korman's Kalamity\" (re-titling of \"Kamen's Kalamity\", issue #31), \"Cutting Cards\" (#32), \"Lower Berth\" (#33), \"None But The Lonely Heart\" (#33), \"Oil's Well That Ends Well\" (#34), \"Curiosity Killed\" (#36), \"Only Skin Deep\" (#38), \"Mournin' Mess\" (#38), \"Undertaking Palor\" (#39), \"Food For Thought\" (#40), \"Operation Friendship\" (#41), \"Cold War\" (#43), \"Forever Ambergris\" (#44), \"The Switch\" (#45) and \"Blind Alleys\" (#46). Other episodes were based on other entries in the EC Comics line: \"The Vault of Horror\", \"The Haunt of Fear\", \"Crime SuspenStories\", \"Shock SuspenStories\" and \"Two-Fisted Tales\".\n\nIn 1993, \"Tales from the Crypt\" was adapted into a Saturday morning cartoon series entitled \"Tales from the Cryptkeeper\", based on the series (albeit with none of the violence or other questionable content that was in the original series), with Kassir as the Cryptkeeper again; it ran from September 18, 1993 to December 4, 1999.\n\nIn 1994, \"Ace Novelty\" released a board game based on \"Tales from the Cryptkeeper\" called \"Tales from the Cryptkeeper: Search for the lost Tales\"\n\nIn late 1993, a pinball machine titled \"Tales from the Crypt\" was produced under license by Data East.\n\nIn 1996, a Saturday morning game show called \"Secrets of the Cryptkeeper's Haunted House\" ran from September 14 to August 1997, with Kassir once again in the role of the Cryptkeeper as announcer.\n\nTwo films by Universal Studios, \"Demon Knight\" (1995) and \"Bordello of Blood\" (1996), were based on the series, neither of which was particularly successful with critics. A third film, \"Ritual\", was slated for theatrical release in 2001, but was only distributed internationally (without the \"Tales from the Crypt\" connection) until 2006 when it was released on DVD in the United States, with the Cryptkeeper segments restored. Unlike the 1970s-era Amicus films, these films were not based on stories from any of the EC comics. \"The Frighteners\" was intended to be another film in the series, but executive producer Robert Zemeckis decided to release it as a standalone film.\n\nIn early 2016, it was announced M. Night Shyamalan is producing a reboot of the 1989 TV series as part of TNT's new horror block. In June 2017, it was announced that the plans for the reboot have been shelved due to licensing issues.\n\n"}
{"id": "2323241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323241", "title": "Patrick Air Force Base", "text": "Patrick Air Force Base\n\nPatrick Air Force Base is a United States Air Force installation located between Satellite Beach and Cocoa Beach, in Brevard County, Florida, in the United States. It was named in honor of Major General Mason Patrick, USAAC. An Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) base, it is home to the 45th Space Wing (45 SW). In addition to its \"host wing\" responsibilities at Patrick AFB, the 45 SW controls and operates Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) and the Eastern Range. It was originally opened and operated from 1940 to 1947 as Naval Air Station Banana River, a U.S. Navy airfield. It was then deactivated as a naval installation in 1947 and placed in caretaker status until it was transferred to the Air Force in late 1948.\n\nAdditional tenant activities at Patrick AFB include the 920th Rescue Wing, the Air Force Technical Applications Center and the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI). Total employment is 10,400. There are 13,099 military, dependents, civilian employees and contractors on base.\n\nThe base is a census-designated place (CDP) and had a resident population of 1,222 at the 2010 census.\n\nThe base also administers the Malabar Annex, located in Palm Bay.\n\nThe facility was due be renamed Patrick Space Force Base in February or March 2020, but the renaming has been postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAuthorized by the Naval Expansion Act of 1938, Naval Air Station Banana River was commissioned on 1 October 1940 as a subordinate base of the Naval Air Operational Training Command at NAS Jacksonville, Florida. The Navy bought of scrub land south of Cocoa Beach.\n\nWith the advent of war with Japan and Germany in December 1941, the Navy began anti-submarine patrols along the Florida coast using PBY Catalina and PBM Mariner seaplanes based at this facility. PBMs returned to training duty in March 1942 when replaced on patrol by OS2U Kingfisher seaplanes. Landing strips were constructed in 1943, thereby allowing for concurrent operation of shore based aircraft. Officers of the Free French Naval Air Service also trained in PBMs at NAS Banana River at this time. Various military related activities took place at NAS Banana River, including maritime patrol aviation operations against German U-Boats, air search and rescue operations, patrol bomber bombardier training, seaplane pilot training, and communications research. Other activities included a blimp squadron detachment, an Aviation Navigation Training School, and an experimental training unit termed Project Baker, a confidential program that developed and tested instrument landing equipment. NAS Banana River hosted a major aircraft repair and maintenance facility. Later in the war, a small detachment of German POWs from Camp Blanding worked at NAS Banana River on cleanup details. At its peak, the base complement included 278 aircraft, 587 civilian employees, and over 2800 officers and enlisted personnel.\n\nThree months after the end of World War II, on 5 December 1945, NAS Banana River had an ancillary role in the disappearance of Flight 19, a formation of five TBM Avenger torpedo bombers, which had departed NAS Fort Lauderdale, Florida on a routine over-water training mission. When the flight failed to return to home station, a search and rescue operation was undertaken by multiple air and naval units. After sunset on 5 December, two PBM Mariner seaplanes from NAS Banana River, originally scheduled for their own training flights were diverted to perform square pattern searches in the area west of 29°N 79°W/29, -79. One of these aircraft, a PBM-5, Bureau Number (BuNo) 59225, took off at 19:27 Eastern Time from NAS Banana River, called in a routine radio message at 19:30 Eastern Time, and was never heard from again.\n\nAt 19:50 Eastern Time, the tanker SS \"Gaines Mills\" reported seeing a mid-air explosion, then flames leaping 100 feet (30 m) high and burning on the sea for 10 minutes. The position was 28°35′N 80°15′W / 28.59, −80.25. Captain Shonna Stanley of the SS \"Gaines Mills\" reported searching for survivors through a pool of oil, but found none. The escort carrier USS \"Solomons\" reported losing radar contact with an aircraft at the same position and time. No wreckage of PBM-5 BuNo 59225 was ever found.\n\nDuring investigation by a board of inquiry regarding the entire Flight 19 incident, attention was given to the loss of the NAS Banana River-based PBM. Several witnesses from both NAS Banana River and other PBM Mariner operating locations were questioned concerning occurrences of aviation gasoline (AvGas) fumes collecting in the bilges of PBM series aircraft and associated no smoking regulations, which were reportedly well posted and rigidly enforced aboard all PBMs. Although the board's report is not a verbatim record and no accusations were made, there seems to be enough inference present to cause one to suspect that the board was aware of the PBM's nickname as \"the flying gas tank.\" As such, it is possible that the PBM-5 was destroyed by an explosion resulting from either (a) an aircrewman violating the no smoking regulations in the aircraft or (b) a stray electrical spark in the lower aircraft hull that may have ignited AvGas fumes in the bilges.\n\nThe Navy buried it's solid wastes southeast of the base, on private land, from 1942-47. The dump was estimated at up to , of which may be eligible for a federal government funding cleanup. Discarded material probably included munitions and practice bombs.\n\nContractors bought the land, naming it \"South Patrick Shores\". The constructed housing on it from 1956-1961. Homeowners had no mandatory solid waste removal until 1982. \n\nResidents reported health complaints starting about 1990s, and again in 2018. Responding to these complaints, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers investigated the site to determine whether a cleanup was necessary.\n\nNAS Banana River closed in September 1947 after a gradual deactivation and was placed in a caretaker status. In September 1948 the facility was transferred to the U.S. Air Force. Several of NAS Banana River's original structures, including runway segments, certain hangars, support buildings, seaplane parking areas and seaplane ramps into the Banana River remain part of modern-day Patrick Air Force Base.\n\nNAS Banana River was transferred to the United States Air Force on 1 September 1948 and renamed the Joint Long Range Proving Ground on 10 June 1949. The installation was renamed Patrick Air Force Base in August 1950.\nFrom 1966 to 1975, the Space Coast was the second most visited spot by VIPs, after Washington, DC, a result of the Space Program. A protocol officer was assigned to Patrick to coordinate these visits, about 3 weekly consisting of 10 to 150 people.\n\nIn 1971, the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI) was established at Patrick AFB.\n\nFive of the victims of the Khobar Towers bombing in 1996 were home stationed at Patrick AFB as part of the 71st Rescue Squadron (71 RQS). The 71 RQS subsequently relocated to Moody AFB, Georgia in 1997.\n\nThe 9/11 attacks prompted the Air Force to close the heavily used 4-lane State Road A1A, which ran immediately in front of the AFTAC Headquarters building. A1A was later reopened to two-lane traffic with car inspections, followed by two-lane traffic without inspections until a barrier was constructed in front of the building and the building reinforced with steel and concrete with the windows sealed.\n\nIn February 2005, the Patrick AFB Officers Club was destroyed by an accidental fire.\n\nIn 2010, the Air Force announced its intention to replace the existing AFTAC building front State Road A1A with a new facility that would cost in the range from $100 to $200 million. At the time of this announcement, this constituted the largest single military construction (MILCON) project in the United States for the Air Force. Completed in 2014, the new facility is a multistory command and control building with a radiochemistry laboratory, central utility plant and a 600 space parking garage located approximately a west of the original AFTAC headquarters building.\n\nUS Navy Boeing E-6 Mercury aircraft, part of Operation Looking Glass, were sometimes seen at Patrick AFB during the 2010–11 time frame and were often mistaken by onlookers for the previously retired VC-137 Presidential aircraft (i.e., Air Force One), which looks similar.\n\nOn 17 May 1950, the base was renamed the \"Long Range Proving Ground Base\" but three months later was renamed \"Patrick Air Force Base\", in honor of Major General Mason Patrick.\n\nOn 3 May 1951, the Long Range Proving Ground Division was assigned to the newly created Air Research and Development Command (ARDC). The next month the division was redesignated the Air Force Missile Test Center (AFMTC).\n\nCost comparison studies done in the early 1950s pointed out the desirability of letting contractors operate the station. The first range contract was signed with Pan American World Services on 31 December 1953. The Air Force Missile Test Center began transferring property and equipment to Pan American World Services at the end of that year. Pan American operated under contract to the Air Force for the next 34 years (until early October 1988). In 1988, the old range contract was divided into the Range Technical Services (RTS) and the Launch Base Services (LBS) contracts. The RTS contract was awarded to Computer Sciences Raytheon (CSR) in June 1988, and the LBS contract was awarded to Pan American World Services (later known as Johnson Controls) in August 1988.\n\nThe Eastern Range supported a variety of missile and manned and unmanned space programs in the 1960s, making it a regular focus of media attention. In the 1960s, a test range office at Patrick AFB with a missile backdrop was used to film scenes for the TV sitcom, \"I Dream of Jeannie\", which was set in nearby Cocoa Beach (no cast was present). But by the mid-1970s, the demise of the Apollo manned space program and the end of land-based ballistic missile development at nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station signaled a downturn in fortunes, and on 1 February 1977, the \"Air Force Eastern Test Range\" organization was inactivated and its functions transferred to Detachment 1 of the Space and Missile Test Center (SAMTEC) until the activation of the Eastern Space and Missile Center in 1979 on 1 October 1979. In 1990, ESMC was transferred from the inactivating Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) to the newly established Air Force Space Command (AFSPC). On 12 November 1991 ESMC was inactivated and the 45th Space Wing (45 SW) assumed its remaining functions.\n\nIn 1961, Patrick AFB began hosting a joint Federal Aviation Administration/Air Defense Command (later Aerospace Defense Command) joint-use radar site featuring an AN/FPS-66 general surveillance radar set for air defense of the Patrick AFB/Cape Canaveral area. Designated site \"Z-211\" (FAA J-05), the 645th Radar Squadron was reactivated on 28 June 1962 to operate the radar, feeding data to Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Center DC-09 at Gunter AFB, Alabama.\n\nAerospace Defense Command (ADC) operated the radar until 25 April 1976 when it was replaced by a detachment of the 20th Air Defense Squadron (OLA-A). The USAF radar was removed around 1988. After its closure by the Air Force, the facility was turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nThe former ADC site was replaced by a new site near Melbourne, Florida, as part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS), designated by NORAD as Southeast Air Defense Sector (SEADS) Ground Equipment Facility \"J-5\", with a new ARSR-4 radar.\n\nThe 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (9 SRW) of the Strategic Air Command established Operating Location OLYMPIC FLAME (OL-OF), a new Lockheed U-2 aircraft operating location at Patrick AFB, Florida, on 29 January 1982. OL-OF was subsequently redesignated as 9 SRW, Detachment 5 on 1 January 1983 and concentrated on reconnaissance operations (to include MIDAS and HICAT) over Central America and the Caribbean basin, replacing an operational capability that had previously been resident at nearby McCoy AFB until that installation's closure in 1975. Detachment 5 was inactivated at Patrick AFB in 1992.\n\n\n\nThe host wing for Patrick AFB is the 45th Space Wing (45 SW), whose Airmen manage all launches of uncrewed rockets at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) 12 miles to the north. These rockets include satellites for the US military, to include the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the National Security Agency (NSA), as well as scientific payload launches in support of NASA, weather satellite launches in support of NOAA, payloads in support of international customers such as the European Space Agency, and commercial payloads for various corporate communications entities. Units and individuals from the 45 SW have deployed abroad during wartime, most notably during Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom\n\nThe Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) is a tenant command headquartered at Patrick AFB. Previously an activity of the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA), AFTAC became a subordinate unit of Twenty-Fifth Air Force (25 AF) and now the Sixteenth Air Force (Air Forces Cyber), both of Air Combat Command (ACC). AFTAC is the sole Department of Defense agency operating and maintaining a global network of nuclear event detection sensors.\n\nThe 920th Rescue Wing (920 RQW), part of Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), is another tenant command headquartered at Patrick AFB and is the installation's only military flying unit. An Air Combat Command (ACC)-gained combat search and rescue (CSAR) organization, the 920 RQW is the only rescue wing in the Air Force Reserve, operating the HC-130P/N \"King\" variant of the C-130 Hercules and HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopter, ready for worldwide deployment. In addition to its CSAR mission, the wing also participates in civilian rescue operations, ranging from rescue support for NASA crewed spaceflight operations, to augmentative support to U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue (SAR) operations, to Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) in the wake of major disasters. Most notable is the 920th's role in crewed spaceflight support to NASA, providing Eastern Range monitoring and having provided search and rescue support for space shuttle launches originating from Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Additional operations have included searching the Caribbean for downed aircraft, as well as retrieving critically ill sailors and passengers from ships hundreds of miles out in the Atlantic, often at night and/or in bad weather. Because the USAF HH-60 can refuel in flight from the USAF HC-130, MC-130, or USMC KC-130, it possesses a much greater range and mission radius versus similar military helicopters lacking such capability. The 920 RQW is a full participant in the Air Force's Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AEF) operating concept. Under this concept, the bulk of the wing deployed to Iraq in 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Subsequent AEF deployments have included Djibouti and Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nThe U.S. State Department's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Air Wing helps foreign countries combat drugs and narcotics criminals. The Bureau operates a fleet of aircraft, primarily former USAF and USMC OV-10 and former USAF C-27 aircraft at Patrick AFB to help detect and interdict the drug trade in Bolivia, Colombia, Peru and Afghanistan.\n\nFlying and notable non-flying units based at Patrick Air Force Base.\n\nUnits marked GSU are Geographically Separate Units, which although based at Patrick, are subordinate to a parent unit based at another location.\n\nSee Cape Canaveral Air Force Station for units of the 45th Space Wing permanently based there.\n\nAir Force Space Command (AFSPC)\n\n\nAir Combat Command (ACC)\n\n\nAir National Guard (ANG)\n\nAir Force Reserve Command (AFRC)\n\nBureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs\n\nThe base has the Space Coast Inn for visiting personnel, dormitories for permanent party single enlisted personnel, quarters for families in three separate housing areas, recreational housing on the beach, beach access, combined officers and enlisted clubs, Commissary, a large AAFES base exchange (BX), library and numerous Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) facilities.\n\nFacilities are used by 4,000 military men and women, 11,500 civilian workers, contractors and dependents, 43,000 military retirees, and 82,000 members of retirees families.\n\nThere are several chapels including Chapel One, Chapel Two, South Chapel at the South Housing area, and Seaside Chapel (Building 440). There is a \"45th Space Wing Chapel\" which travels with the Wing when it is deployed. The Catholic Group is called \"St. George Parish\" and meets in Chapel One or Two. While the buildings are owned by the Air Force, the Catholic Parish is under the spiritual direction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA.\n\nIn 2009, base housing was privatized and in addition to active duty personnel and their families, also became available for lease by members of the Reserve and Guard, military retirees, Department of Defense civil service employees and DOD contractors.\n\nIn 2010, the construction of a new medical clinic was started. It is expected to cost $18.5 million.\n\nPatrick Air Force Base lies on a barrier island, and is primarily accessed from the mainland by the Pineda Causeway (State Road 404) in Satellite Beach, or State Road A1A which runs the entire length of Patrick AFB.\n\nThe base obtains potable water from the city of Cocoa. A single potable water line from Cocoa runs under the Sykes Creek Bridge at Sea Ray Drive.\n\nThe \"Missileer\" was published by the base weekly until 28 September 2012. It was discontinued due to defense budget cutbacks as a result of sequestration. A local paper, \"Florida Today\", publishes \"The Shark Pride\" weekly, as a replacement for the former publication.\n\n\n"}

About 50 percent of these moves were within the same prefecture; the others were relocations from one prefecture to another. During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education. Out-migration from rural prefectures continued in the late 1980s, but more slowly than in previous decades. \n\nIn the 1980s, government policy provided support for new urban development away from the large cities, particularly Tokyo, and assisted regional cities to attract young people to live and work there. Regional cities offered familiarity to those from nearby areas, lower costs of living, shorter commutes, and, in general, a more relaxed life-style then could be had in larger cities. Young people continued to move to large cities, however, to attend universities and find work, but some returned to regional cities (a pattern known as U-turn) or to their prefecture of origin (a pattern known as J-turn). \n\nGovernment statistics show that in the 1980s significant numbers of people left the largest cities (Tokyo and Osaka). In 1988 more than 500,000 people left Tokyo, which experienced a net loss through migration of nearly 73,000 for the year. Osaka had a net loss of nearly 36,000 in the same year. However, the prefectures showing the highest net growth are located near the major urban centers, such as Saitama, Chiba, Ibaraki, and Kanagawa around Tokyo, and Hyōgo, Nara, and Shiga near Osaka and Kyoto. This pattern suggests a process of suburbanization, people moving away from the cities for affordable housing but still commuting there for work and recreation, rather than a true decentralization. \n\nJapanese economic success has led to an increase in certain types of external migration. In 1990, about 11 million Japanese went abroad. More than 80 percent of these people traveled as tourists, especially visiting other parts of Asia and North America. However, about 663,100 Japanese were living abroad, approximately 75,000 of whom had permanent foreign residency, more than six times the number who had that status in 1975. More than 200,000 Japanese went abroad in 1990 for extended periods of study, research, or business assignments. As the government and private corporations have stressed internationalization, greater numbers of individuals have been directly affected, decreasing Japan's historically claimed insularity. Despite the benefits of experiencing life abroad, individuals who have lived outside Japan for extended periods often faced problems of discrimination upon their return because others might no longer consider them fully Japanese. By the late 1980s, these problems, particularly the bullying of returnee children in the schools, had become a major public issue both in Japan and in Japanese communities abroad.\n\nEthnic issues in Japan and the situation of foreigners (Gaikokujin in Japanese) and Korean residents in Japan in particular are described in the articles this sentence links to.\n\n\"This article includes text from the public domain Library of Congress \"Country Studies\" at http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/.\"\n"}

The original published sequence included eleven errors, including one extra base pair in position 3107, and incorrect assignments of single base pairs. Some of these were the result of contamination with bovine and HeLa specimens. The corrected revised CRS was published by Andrews et al. in 1999. (The original nucleotide numbering was retained to avoid confusion.) The reference sequence belongs to European haplogroup H2a2a1. The revised CRS is designated as rCRS. It is deposited in the GenBank NCBI database under accession number NC_012920.\n\nWhen mitochondrial DNA sequencing is used for genealogical purposes, the results are often reported as differences from the revised CRS. The CRS is a reference sequence rather than a record of the earliest human mtDNA. A difference between a tested sample and the CRS may have arisen in the lineage of the CRS or in the lineage of the tested sample.\n\nAn alternative African (Yoruba) reference sequence has also been used sometimes instead of the Cambridge. It has a different numbering system with a length of 16,571 base pairs and represents the mitochondrial genome of one African individual. Other alternative reference sequences that have also sometimes been used include the African (Uganda), Swedish and Japanese sequences.\n\nIn 2012, it was proposed that the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS), should be replaced by a new Reconstructed Sapiens Reference Sequence (RSRS). The RSRS keeps the same numbering system as the CRS, but represents the ancestral genome of Mitochondrial Eve, from which all currently known human mitochondria descend. The RSRS should be more useful for comparing the changes in different haplogroups although this has been debated. Family Tree DNA reports results for mtDNA for both rCRS and RSRS.\n\n"}

Born into a wealthy black family in Florida, Teele received an excellent education and became an officer in the US Army, and later had a successful career in private practice and politics. The \"Miami Herald\" published claims of legal wrongdoing against Teele during his fight to have a conviction against him overturned, and he committed suicide. Posthumously, his case was appealed and his conviction was overturned exonerating him of all charges.\n\nArt Teele married Celestra Patton Teele, of whom he had one son Arthur Patton Teele. (Trey) Teele, later married Stephanie K. Teele of whom he was married upon his death.\n\nTeele was a law student who went into the military after his graduation. Teele served the US Army as a Judge Advocate General on the personal staff of General Henry Emerson, Commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg from July 1975 to June 1977. Teele earned his law degree from Florida State University College of Law.\n\nAfter his honorable discharge from the US Army, Teele provided \"pro bono\" services to the defendants in the Wilmington Ten which was the most prominent civil rights case in America during the 1970s. Teele met with the attorneys for the Wilmington Ten as well as attorneys and administrative staff of North Carolina Attorney General Rufus Edmisten. In 1980, the federal courts ordered a new trial for the Wilmington Ten, and Attorney General Edmisten dropped all charges after hearing appeals from Teele and others permitting the Wilmington Ten to go free.\n\nReturning to the private practice of law in his home state of Florida, Teele became the attorney for Bill France, the founder of NASCAR, before entering politics in Miami. In Europe, Teele consulted with Interpol on investigations into organized crime and international homicide cases.\n\nShortly after his election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan appointed Teele to the post of Assistant Secretary of Transportation. From 1981–83, Teele was the head of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA), a position officially known as Administrator of UMTA (now FTA).\n\nTeele campaigned for Bob Dole in the 1996 presidential primaries, and this political association was raised as an issue in the African-American community when Teele ran for mayor of Miami-Dade County later that year. Teele was one of the top two candidates to emerge from the general election, but he was narrowly defeated in a runoff by Alex Penelas.\n\nIn the 1990s, Teele was elected Miami-Dade County Commissioner in Miami, Florida. Following a controversial investigation and trial, Teele was removed from office by Governor Jeb Bush on March 2, 2005. Although Teele was convicted of corruption by threat against a public servant, the verdict was overturned on appeal after his death by suicide.\n\nOn July 27, 2005, Teele walked into the \"Miami Herald\" building and shot himself fatally in the head.\n\nAt the time of his death, Teele was a popular politician with a loyal following in Miami-Dade. Teele's conviction stemmed from an incident with a Miami-Dade County detective who had been conducting surveillance as part of a corruption probe. That probe was triggered in part by investigative articles published in the Miami Herald by journalist Oscar J. Corral. That probe had resulted in Teele being charged with ten felony counts of unlawful compensation, with trial set for October 2005. Teele was also under federal indictment for money laundering, mail fraud and wire fraud for allegedly helping a minority company win more than $20 million worth of electrical contracts at Miami International Airport for work that was actually undertaken by a larger non-minority company. Teele faced a possible 20 years in prison if convicted of the federal charges, but an examination of his personal financial records after his death revealed that Teele was not a rich man and was actually in debt for half a million dollars.\n\nOn the day of his suicide, the \"Miami New Times\" published a cover story on Teele which was based on the report of the corruption probe and detailed alleged dealings with illegal drugs and a transvestite prostitute with a criminal record. Shortly before he shot himself, Teele called Miami Herald columnist Jim DeFede, who taped their conversation. This taping led to the dismissal of DeFede. According to the tape, Teele professed his love for his wife, Stephanie, in a rambling conversation that revealed a spike in his personal anxiety.\n\nOn April 18, 2007, almost two years after he committed suicide, Teele's conviction for corruption by threat against a public servant was overturned by the Florida Third District Court of Appeal. The court allowed the appeal by a deceased individual on the basis that Teele's conviction precluded his wife from making a valid claim for death benefits under the City of Miami's pension plan and other merits of his case.\n\nA documentary about Teele's final days that concentrated on his suicide was produced by two University of Miami film students, Josh Miller and Sam Rega. Miller and Rega's student documentary, \"Miami Noir,\" was screened at the 2008 Miami International Film Festival. Their documentary re-examined the scandal in the context of political pressures from the Florida State Attorney's Office during Jeb Bush's administration that raised concerns about the motives for the persecution of Art Teele.\n\n"}

{"id": "2323292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323292", "title": "Vossloh", "text": "Vossloh\n\nVossloh AG is a rail technology company based in Werdohl in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The SDAX-listed group has achieved sales of around €930 million in 2016 with more than 4,000 employees (as of 2017).\n\nVossloh is a global market leader both for rail fasteners and switch systems. In North America Vossloh is the leading manufacturer of concrete railway ties. And concerning track maintenance, they offer a globally unique grinding technology, so-called high speed grinding.\n\nCustomers are generally public and private railway companies, network operators as well as regional and municipal transport companies.\n\nSince the restructuring, Vossloh has been focusing on target markets China, the USA, Russia and Western Europe. Important European production sites of Vosslohs are located in Germany, France, Luxembourg, Poland and Scandinavia. In addition, the group has subsidiaries in Asia, North and South America, Australia and Russia.\n\nThe company is named after Eduard Vossloh. In 1883, the blacksmith received the first contract from the Royal Prussian Railway for the manufacture of spring washers for rail fasteners. On July 11, 1888 the Eduard Vossloh Company was registered. Spring washers and other hardware items were manufactured at the family's blacksmiths shop. Even today, Werdohl is still the headquarters of Vossloh AG and Vossloh Fastening Systems GmbH (Core Components division).\n\nThrough the early 1900s the company continued to grow, producing general hardware including decorative items and lampholders for electric lights.\n\nIn 1945 the facilities in Werdohl were destroyed by a bomb. Subsidiaries marketing lampholders which are located in Kaliningrad, Wroclaw and East Germany ceased to be part of the company due to the changes in political borders at that time.\n\nIn 1946 production of holders for fluorescent tubes was allowed to take place at a plant in Lüdenscheid, by 1962 an additional plant for lighting products had opened in Selm and the Vossloh works employed 1,300 people, with 500 more employed in subsidiaries. 1967 was a decisive turning Point: Vossloh obtained a license to produce a new tension clamp rail fastening developed by Prof. Hermann Meier director of the Deutsche Bundesbahn.\n\nRecession in Germany in the 1980s resulted in the closure of two plants and employee lay-offs reducing the staff by almost half. Management was brought in from outside the Vossloh family, and Schwabe GmbH acquired; its lighting ballast products complementing Vossloh's lighting fittings product range, and on 1 December 1989 Vossloh-Werke GmbH became a public stock company or \"Aktiengesellschaft\" (AG). At this time there were three company divisions : Vossloh-Werke GmbH (Werdohl) (railway components e.g. tension clamps), Vossloh-Schwabe GmbH (Urbach) (electrical lighting products and components), and Hansa Metallwarengesellschaft mbH Thiessen & Hager (decorative products, sunscreen products).\n\nThe current listed company was founded in 1990. On June 13, 1990, the shares of Vossloh AG were listed on the Düsseldorf Stock Exchange for the first time. In the 1990s, the reunification of Germany resulted, and new markets in eastern Europe resulted in additional demand for its rail fastening products on the former Deutsche Reichsbahn and elsewhere. \"Hoesch Maschinenfabrik Deutschland GmbH\" and \"W. Hegenscheidt GmbH\" manufacturers of railway wheelset machining equipment were acquired in the mid 1990s. In 1997 the company was first listed on the MDAX. In 1998 railway switch manufacturing company VAE group was acquired by Voestalpine AG and Vossloh.\n\nHowever recession in the 1990s resulted in the sale of the non-'recession-resilient' decorative products division to Arquati S.p.a of Italy in 1997. Under company CEO Burkhard Schuchmann Vossloh was re-orientated as a rail industry based company during and after the 1990s; In 2002 the lighting division was sold to Matsushita Electric Works, Ltd. of Osaka, Japan, and the company expanded into the rail industry market with a number of acquisitions:\n\n\nAt the end of 2005 Burkard Schuchmann is succeeded by Dr. Gerhard Eschenröder as CEO until 2007 when Werner Andree replaces him. The subsidiary, Vossloh Information Technologies GmbH was sold (February 2007) to Funkwerk AG. The company continued to expand; its first acquisition in North America was Pohl Corp (switch manufacturer), followed by Cleveland Track Material Inc., both acquired in 2007. A 100% stake in French rail infrastructure company (ETF) was also obtained in 2007. The same year the company opened a rail fastening subsidiary in China.\n\nIn 2008 Vossloh infrastructure services is sold to the VINCI group of companies - this included the infrastructure parts of Cogifer SA acquired in 2002 as well as Européenne de Travaux Ferroviaires SA.\n\nFurther railroad switch manufacturers were acquired :TLK Rail (Australia) in 2007, Sportek (Denmark) and Kloos Oving B.V. (Netherlands) in 2008, and the switch and rail manufacturing parts of the Nouva Sima Sud company (Italy) in 2009.\n\nIn 2010 the company enters the rail services market in Germany, forming Vossloh Rail Services GmbH from the rail maintenance parts of Stahlberg-Roensch Group in addition to LOG Logistikgesellschaft Gleisbau mbH and ISB Instandhaltungssysteme Bahn GmbH. A rail milling and grinding joint venture \"Vossloh MFL Rail Milling GmbH\", was formed in association with Maschinenfabrik Liezen und Giesserei in 2012.\n\nIn mid 2013 Knorr-Bremse owner Heinz Hermann Thiele became chairman of the Vossloh board, after having raised his shareholding in the company from below 5% to over 10% in Mar. 2011, and to over 25% in 2013. Thiele's election to chair was opposed by the Vossloh family who own over 30% of the shares. In November 2013 the Vossloh family unexpectedly sold 22% of its shareholding, reducing their holding to under 10% and leaving Heinz Hermann Thiele as the main shareholder in the company.\n\nIn 2014 the company began a restructuring. New executive board members were introduced and high level management numbers were reduced by a third, and talks started on general workforce redundancies. The transfer of locomotive production in Kiel to a more modern site was also under investigation, with three sites identified. In June 2014 Kieler Nachrichten reported that an offer had been made for Voith's locomotive plant, however in July the company announced it was to build a new plant at a cost of €30 million in the Suchsdorf area of Kiel. A groundbreaking ceremony for the new plant took place 17 July 2015.\n\nIn December 2014 the company announced it intended to divest its transportation division. The rail-vehicles division was announced as sold to Stadler in late 2015. The Electrical Systems division (formerly Vossloh Kiepe) was sold to Knorr-Bremse in 2016.\n\nEnd of 2016, Vossloh acquired Rocla Concrete Tie, Inc., headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado from Altus Capital Partners II. Since 1986 the North American company mainly supplies customers in the USA focus market with concrete thresholds. At the same time, Vossloh has purchased the remaining 50% of the shares in the previous Alpha Rail Team joint venture.\n\nVossloh has three divisions contribute to the core business, rail infrastructure: Core Components, Customized Modules and Lifecycle Solutions.\n\nVossloh currently operates with four divisions. The fourth division, Transportation, covers the developing and manufacturing of diesel locomotives, and also provides all necessary locomotive maintenance and repair services. With the adoption of the strategy at the end of 2014, the Transportation division stopped being part of the core business.\n\nThe individual companies are centrally coordinated by the holding company, Vossloh AG, and operate in common under the Vossloh brand.\n\nThe Core Components division manufactures standardized products on an industrial scale, which are required in large quantities for rail infrastructure.\n\nVossloh’s business unit Fastening Systems produces rail fastening systems and components, which are used in more than 65 countries. The screw-fastened and maintenance-free elastic systems are suitable for all applications: ballasted and slab tracks, mainline and conventional lines, high-speed lines, heavy-haul and local transport. Approx. 50 million tension clamps leave Vossloh’s production sites in Europe, Asia and North America every year.\n\nThe division includes Vossloh Fastening Systems GmbH (Werdohl Germany), Delkor Rail Pty. Ltd. (Australia), Patil Vossloh Rail Systems Pvt. Ltd. (joint venture with Patil Group of India), Vossloh Sistemi s.r.l. (Italy), TOO \"Vossloh-Kaz\" (Russia), Vossloh Utenzilija d.d. (Croatia), Vossloh Skamo Sp. z o.o. (Poland), Vossloh Tehnika Feroviara S.R.L. (Romania), Vossloh Drážní Technika s.r.o. (Czech Republic), Vossloh Rail Technology Limitet Sirketi (Turkey), Feder-7 GmbH (Hungary) and Vossloh Fastening Systems America Corporation (Chicago, USA).\n\nVossloh’s business unit Tie Technologies is manufacturing concrete railway ties in North America. In addition, six own production sites in the USA and another one in Mexico also produce switch ties, concrete low-vibration track blocks and crossing panels.\n\nThe Customized Modules division develops and manufactures systems for rail infrastructure, which must be individually adapted to the customer and the project. Installation and maintenance are related Vossloh services.\n\nVossloh Cogifer produces railway switch systems at over 30 production sites in over 20 countries: Vossloh Nordic Switch systems AB (Sweden), KIHN (Luxembourg), Vossloh Track Material Inc. (Wilmington USA) and Cleveland Track Material Inc. (Cleveland USA) and Vossloh Cogifer Australia Pty., as well as two joint ventures Corus Cogifer Switches and Crossings, (Scunthorpe, UK) and Amurrio Ferrocarril y Equipos SA (Spain).\n\nFrom 2012 Corus Cogifer Switches and Crossings was rebranded as VTS Track Technology Ltd. due to the acquisition of Corus by Tata Steel and of Cogifer by Vossloh.\n\nVossloh is a majority shareholder in a joint venture with the Argentine state owned infrastructure company ADIFSE called \"Vossloh Cogifer Argentina SA\" created in 2013, with a production plant located near the city of La Plata.\n\nAmongst turnouts and crossings, Vossloh manufactures manganese frogs, switch blade, switch actuators and locking devices, signalling products and rail monitoring systems. The Vossloh offer covers all fields of application: standard, high-speed, special and heavy-haul switches, as well as solutions for urban networks.\n\nThe Lifecycle Solutions division of Vossloh provides track related services. This includes welding and transportation of long rails, maintenance and preventative care of tracks and switches and reconditioning and recycling of old rails. These services also cover the lifecycle management of entire track sections.\n\nVossloh Rail Services provides railway track infrastructure maintenance such as rail grinding, welding, replacement and testing. The division was formed in 2010 with the acquisition of parts of the Stahlberg-Roensch Group and \"Logistikgesellschaft Gleisbau mbH\" and \"Instandhaltungssysteme Bahn GmbH\" from the Contrack Group.\n\nThe Transportation division produces locomotives and provides related services.\n\nVossloh Locomotives GmbH, the former MaK locomotive plant in Kiel produces diesel-electric and diesel-hydraulic centre-cab locomotives, for freight and shunting purposes, which are fitted with eco-friendly technology and are approved in many European countries.\n\nThis is complemented by services related to the maintenance and repair of locomotives, including variable financing models and options for maintenance agreements. ECM-compliant service centers are located in Germany, France and Italy. The pan-European service network also includes partner workshops and collaborations, in Sweden.\n\nThe factory's main production up to 2009 was diesel hydraulic locomotives of type Vossloh G1000 BB, Vossloh G1206, Vossloh G1700 BB and Vossloh G2000 BB. The company's major orders included G1206/1700 variants for the French (SNCF Class BB 61000) and Swiss railways (SBB Am 843).\n\nA three axle shunting locomotive, type Vossloh G6 was introduced in 2008, in 2009 the company announced to the intention to offer diesel electric or diesel hydraulic variant of four axle centre cab locomotives in two power ranges: G 12 or DE 12 and G 18 or DE 18 (approximately corresponding to the power ranges of the G1206 and G1700 versions.)\n\nIn 2016, Vossloh Locomotives won a major contract in France. Akiem S.A.S. ordered 44 locomotives of DE 18.\n\nIn 2000 Vossloh and Angel Trains formed a locomotive leasing business - Locomotion Partners consisting of two companies:\n\nThe companies would not exclusively hire and service only Vossloh locomotives, and would act independently, depending on the circumstances. In 2004 the 10% stake in Locomotion capital Ltd. was sold and the stake in Locomotion Service GmbH increased to 100%.\n\nVossloh Rail Vehicles (formerly Vossloh España S.A.) was acquired from Alstom c.2005. The former Meinfesa plant produced diesel electric locomotives as well as passenger multiple units, trams and bogies.\n\nThe company's locomotive output has included the SNCF BB 460000 (in cooperation with Alstom) and Vossloh Euro locomotives.\n\nIn 2010 the company launched a new locomotive type: the diesel electric Eurolight locomotive, designed for railways requiring axleloads less than 20t, and with either 2.3 or 2.8MW installed engine power. In September 2012, Vossloh unveiled a mockup of the \"Desert Hawk\" locomotive, a single ended development of its Euro locomotive design intended for use in push-pull passenger trains in hot and sandy conditions. The rail-vehicles division was announced as sold to Stadler in late 2015.\n\nVossloh Kiepe GmbH produces electrical systems for light rail, trolleybuses and hybrid buses including electric propulsion and control, air conditioning and heating as well as passenger rail vehicle refurbishment and modernisation. The business (as Vossloh Electrical Systems) was sold in late 2016 to Knorr-Bremse.\n\n"}

The three primary operating divisions of Maschinenbau Kiel GmbH were sold to different companies in the 1990s.\n\nRheinmetall acquired the military vehicles division in 1990. Siemens acquired the locomotive manufacturing division in 1992. Siemens sold the locomotive division to the current owner, Vossloh, in 1998. Caterpillar Inc. acquired the marine diesel engine division in 1997.\n\nBoth Vossloh and the marine diesels division of Caterpillar are still based in Kiel, Caterpillar continues to use MaK brand name on their products. The companies are major employers in Kiel.\n\nThe companies origins can be traced back at least as far as 1918. With the Treaty of Versailles limiting arms production in Germany, the defence based industries in Kiel sought other markets. Kiel Deutsche Werke AG (DWK) was founded; producing diesel locomotives as well as shipbuilding and firearms manufacture. During the second world war Deutsche work produced U-boats, as well as locomotives for the Wehrmacht. The end of the second world war brought not only destruction of many of the facilities in Kiel, but also the end of the company.\n\nThe first production Marder was handed to the West German army on 7 May 1971. Production of the vehicle continued until 1975, with 2,136 vehicles being completed.\nThe company \"Maschinenbau Kiel\" was founded on 25 May 1948 as a limited liability company. It included several factories of the former Deutsche Werke AG. In 1954 after a lengthy legal dispute with MAN the name was changed from MAK to MaK.\nIn 1959 a crisis led to the company's purchase by Bremer Atlas GmbH and its conversion into a GmbH (a type of limited liability company).\n\nIn 1964 MaK became part of the Krupp group due to the take over of its parent company. By 1990 the production of the Leopard 2 had ended and the prospect of future orders was uncertain; the military equipment production division was organised into a new company MaK System GmbH. which was acquired by the cannon manufacturer Rheinmetall. The locomotive production arm of the company was sold in 1992 to Siemens.\n\nIn 1997 the marine engines part of the business was sold to Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThe marine diesel engines division became Caterpillar Motoren GmbH & Co. KG in 1997 and is now a 100% subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc. The engines still carry the MaK logo. One example of the success of this organisation is the use of four engines of the type MaK 9 M 43 C in the cruise ship AIDAdiva.\n\nThe MaK product line as of August 2015 consists of six medium-speed four-stroke diesel and dual fuel engine models. They range in power from 1,020 to 16,800 kW.\n\nCurrent models apply flexible camshaft technology (FCT) to reduce or eliminate visible smoke at partial load. FCT also said to improve performance and load pick-up.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s diesel locomotives of the 'connecting rod' with jackshaft drive type were built and sold to numerous private companies to replace steam locomotives.\n\nDuring the 1950s the plant produced locomotives for the Deutsche Bundesbahn, including the DB Class V 60, DB Class V 65, DB Class V 80\n\nIn 1965 native locomotive production began to use cardan shafts as part of the transmission system.\n\nDuring the 1960s further locomotive models were produced for the Deutsche Bundesbahn including the Class V 90's, DB Class V 100, DB Class V 200 and DB Class V 160\n\nA third program of locomotive building began in 1979 - based on the standards (\"Arbeitskreis Standard-Diesellok\") produced by the Federal Association of Railways (\"Bundesverbandes Deutscher Eisenbahnen\") which required the use of standard interchangeable components. In the exterior design right angles and flat steel predominate - primarily for cost reasons, internally a switch to faster running engines was made, with engines from MTU being used. The G 1206 BB; a development of the G 1201 BB, with numerous intermediate models, proved notably successful being in production for decades, with a new shunting version introduced in 2007.\n\nIn the harsh economic climate of that time the company tried to expand its range - and its customer base. Using electrical components from the Swiss-German company BBC MaK started production of diesel-electric locomotives - some were successful, notably the EN 6400 of which 120 were bought by Nederlandse Spoorwegen.\n\nIn 1992 the name of the company was changed to Krupp Verkehrstechnik GmbH (with the corporation of some other companies in the Krupp group). 1994 brought a sale to Siemens and became part of Siemens rail technology (\"Siemens Schienenfahrzeugtechnik\" SFT).\n\nOn 1 October 1998 the factory in Kiel along with a branch plant in Moers was sold to Vossloh AG. Vossloh Rail Vehicle Engineering (Vossloh Schienenfahrzeugtechnik GmbH) or \"VSFT\" was the new name.\n\nUnder Vosslohs management the locomotives produced carried the traditional MaK logo. On 23 April 2004 the company was renamed \"Vossloh Locomotives GmbH\"\n\nThe construction equipment manufacturing company is now known as ATLAS TEREX GmbH.\n\nIn 1983 \"MaK DATA SYSTEM\" emerged as a profit center for the Krupp MaK external information technology service. Since 1995 it has been an independent company: MaK DATA SYSTEM Kiel GmbH.\n\nIn 2006, the foundry of the Caterpillar engine works and the former MaK foundry was sold to SHW Casting Technologies GmbH, a foundry group, and now trades under the name \"Gießerei Kiel GmbH\" (Kiel Foundry Ltd) or \"GK\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2323306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323306", "title": "When I Grow Up (Garbage song)", "text": "When I Grow Up (Garbage song)\n\n\"When I Grow Up\" is a 1998 song written, recorded and produced by alternative rock band Garbage. The song was released as the fourth international single to be taken from the band's multi-platinum second album \"Version 2.0\" over the course of the following year.\n\n\"When I Grow Up\" was the first split-single release in Europe for Garbage, in some countries, \"The Trick Is to Keep Breathing\" was released in its place. \"When I Grow Up\" proved to be a charting hit in both United Kingdom and Spain, before going on to become Garbage's most successful single release in Australia and New Zealand at that point in their career.\n\nIn North America, \"When I Grow Up\" served as one of two singles (along with Sheryl Crow's cover version of \"Sweet Child o' Mine\") released from the soundtrack of the Adam Sandler comedy film \"Big Daddy\".\n\n\"When I Grow Up\" was written and recorded at Smart Studios during the 1997 sessions for \"Version 2.0\". For the intro, the band routed a Nord synthesizer through a guitar pedal and distorted the sound in a 48-track ProTools set up. Drummer Butch Vig used three different snare drums, each hit consecutively and each processed (one through a flanger, one pitch shifted down and one gated), and made into a loop and matched with the Nord for that opening sequence. The scratchy vinyl record sound came from a Victrola gramophone that belonged to engineer Billy Bush's grandfather. The percolating keyboard parts were created by programming some sounds on a Planet Phatt synth module and running them through a guitar amp, complimented by a harmonic guitar note with a filter pulse applied. All of Shirley's vocal, drum and bass parts (performed by the band's touring bassist Daniel Shulman) were recorded to anologue \"to get tape compression\", while loops and sound effects were left in ProTools. A MicroLynx deck synchronizer was used to marry the analogue tape and digital audio workstation outputs, while the final mix was printed utilizing two Studer 2\" tape machines.\n\nGuitarist Steve Marker credited Garbage front-person Shirley Manson for coming up with a lot of the \"sunny-pop\" melodies on the song, explaining \"that's something that we've always tried to do - have a dark lyric disguised by a happy pop melody. We like that sort of contradiction and juxtaposition.\" Lyrically, Manson described \"When I Grow Up\" as being about \"that delirious state of wishing and hoping and dreaming for things, not giving up. There's a great quote by Flaubert where he says, 'Sometimes the forces of the world hold us back for a while, but not for ever' ... \". Manson stated that despite the song dealing with growing up, it actually questions whether adulthood brings maturity (\"Even though you're sussed and you're smart and you've worked it all out, you haven't even got the remotest inkling of what it's all about. And you can never hope to\") and mocks those who feel that way; \"I'm constantly patronised by people who think they're really mature and have their life in order and are really together. That's so small minded.\" \"When I Grow Up\" notably snuck the phrase \"golden shower(s)\" onto daytime radio, of which Manson remained proud of afterwards: \"It's our little trojan horse!\"\n\n\"When I Grow Up\" was remastered in 2007 for Garbage's greatest hits album \"Absolute Garbage\" and remastered from the original studio tapes in 2018 for \"Version 2.0 (20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)\".\n\n\"When I Grow Up\" was released to UK radio stations at the end of 1998 and was A-listed at Radio One, Atlantic 252, XFM and GLR, B-listed at Virgin and playlisted at a further sixty-eight regional radio stations. KISS FM also playlisted the Danny Tenaglia remix. The music video was placed on heavy rotation by both MTV (who sponsored the upcoming tour) and The Box. Import copies of \"When I Grow Up\" from Europe were sold in a few UK record stores, leading the single to chart early at number 198 on the UK Singles Chart as the band's arena tour kicked off in Ireland and then routed into the United Kingdom. Supported by the tour and airplay for the single, \"Version 2.0\" climbed back into the top forty of the UK Albums Chart. Mushroom Records issued \"When I Grow Up\" on January 25 as a 2×CD single set and a cassette single. The first CD and the cassette was backed with \"Can't Seem to Make You Mine\"; the CD also included the Danny Tenaglia remix. The second CD single included \"Tornado\" and the Rickedy Raw version of \"Special\". After a week on sale, \"When I Grow Up\" debuted at number 28 on the Irish Singles Chart, and debuted at number 9 on the UK Singles Chart. This was the band's fifth UK top ten hit.

In its third week at radio, \"When I Grow Up\" peaked at number 34 on the European airplay chart as it debuted at number 39 on the European Hot 100. Buoyed by the release of the single, and tourdates, \"Version 2.0\" recharted and climbed to number 44 on the European Top 100 albums due to strong sales in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Spain and Sweden. In February, \"When I Grow Up\" debuted at number 5 in Spain, peaking at four a week later. At the end of the month, IFPI certified \"Version 2.0\" platinum for one million sales across Europe. Although \"The Trick Is to Keep Breathing\" was released instead in Germany, after the success of Garbage's James Bond theme \"The World Is Not Enough\" in (where it reached number 38 on the single sales chart) BMG released \"When I Grow Up\" as the sixth single from \"Version 2.0\" on March 6, 2000.\n\n\"When I Grow Up\" was released in North America as Garbage were at the end of a two-month arena tour around the United States opening for Alanis Morissette. A month prior, the Danny Tenaglia remixes had reached nightclubs around the country on import from Europe achieving Hot Dance Breakout status. \"When I Grow Up\" subsequently debuted on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart at #47. By the end of March, third \"Version 2.0\" single \"Special\" was gaining traction at Top 40 radio, and the song thereafter started climbing the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. On March 20, Garbage performed both \"Special\" and \"When I Grow Up\" on \"Saturday Night Live\". Almo Sounds serviced \"When I Grow Up\" to alternative rock radio in the United States on April 12. The song debuted at #40 a week after \"Special\" left the alternative charts. In May, \"When I Grow Up\" remixes reached number four on the Club Play chart; and by the first week of June, reached a high of 23 in its sixth week on the Modern Rock chart.\n\nIn June 1999, \"When I Grow Up\" was licensed to the soundtrack of the upcoming Adam Sandler-vehicle \"Big Daddy\". To help promote the movie release, Almo, in partnership with Sony's C2 Records, serviced two new pop radio edits of \"When I Grow Up\" to Top 40 radio on June 15. A week later, as Almo released a 12\" vinyl featuring the Danny Tenaglia mix of \"When I Grow Up\" and a Brothers In Rhythm mix of \"Special\" to record stores, a new version of the music video featuring shots from the film premiered on MTV and VH1. \"Big Daddy\" opened in North America the weekend of June 25, and debuted at number 1 with a box office take of almost $42 million. After dropping for two weeks, \"When I Grow Up\" stabilized at number 24 for a fortnight before leaving the Modern Rock chart at the start of August. \"When I Grow Up\" had spent a total of fifteen weeks on the alternative charts and fourteen on the dance charts.\n\n\"When I Grow Up\" was released by Festival Mushroom in New Zealand in mid-July on CD (featuring \"Can't Seem to Make You Mine\", \"Tornado\" and the Danny Tenaglia remix) and cassette single (featuring only the remix). The single debuted on the RIANZ Singles Chart as the second-highest new entry at number 27 at the end of the month. \"When I Grow Up\" peaked at 24 two weeks later. The single stayed on the charts for seven weeks before recharting at number 42 at the end of September. \"Version 2.0\" charted in New Zealand for the first time since May on the RIANZ Album chart in mid-September, reaching 26, the same week that Version 2.0 tour reached the country.\n\nIn Australia, Festival Mushroom launched a two-week national advertising campaign on Channel Ten to promote the single and the planned limited edition album repackage (\"Version 2.0 Special Live Edition\") which featured a bonus disc of four tracks recorded live at the Roskilde Festival. \"When I Grow Up\" was released by Festival Mushroom as a CD single on August 2, and debuted the following week as the second-highest new entry at number 22 on the ARIA Charts. The same week, \"Version 2.0\" re-entered the ARIA Albums Chart for the first time in a year. \"Big Daddy\" was released to cinemas across Australia on September 16, while Garbage visited the country to perform at Brisbane's Livid Festival and co-headline a tour with Alanis Morissette the following month. On October 9, Garbage appeared on \"Hey Hey It's Saturday\" to perform the single. \"When I Grow Up\" moved back up the charts to number 25 by the end of the month, while the \"Version 2.0\" album surged up to number 8. \"When I Grow Up\" eventually dropped off the ARIA chart when Garbage released follow-up single \"You Look So Fine\" on December 6. That single did not make the chart. \"When I Grow Up\" reappeared at 47 at the end of the month and charted for a final time in mid-January 2000, having clocked up a total of twenty-one weeks. \"When I Grow Up\" became Garbage's most successful single release in Australia at that point in their career.\n\n The original \"When I Grow Up\" music video documented the frenzy of a \"Version 2.0\" tour concert. director Sophie Muller shot footage over the course of four Garbage shows over November 17–21, 1998 in Indianapolis, Indiana, St. Louis, Missouri, Kansas City, Kansas, and Madison, Wisconsin during the band's North American tour. At all of the concerts, the band performed \"When I Grow Up\" twice, once in the main set and a second time as an encore, to provide enough footage for Muller to utilise. Footage for the music video for \"The Trick Is to Keep Breathing\" was also filmed by Muller on the same nights. Unlike the special effects-laden videos for their previous three singles, \"When I Grow Up\" was intended to focus on the performance side of the band. Both videos were ready to air by December 3, 1998 and was broadcast in support of the single releases in United Kingdom, Europe and Australia. A remastered version of the \"When I Grow Up\" video was included on Garbage's 2007 greatest hits DVD \"Absolute Garbage\" and later uploaded to the band's VEVO channel in 2018.\n\nA second music video was directed by Muller in London at the start of June 1999. It was filmed on a stage set backed by lighted replicas of the bands \"G\", \"Version 2.0\" globe and \"When I Grow Up\" thought balloon logos. Three sequences within the video featured Manson performing choreographed dance moves with two dancers. The second video was filmed to promote \"Big Daddy\" in North America; a second edit of the video also incorporated montage footage from the movie. The video premiered on MTV's \"Total Request Live\" and VH1 on June 21, 1999. The edit of the \"When I Grow Up\" video that incorporated footage from the movie was included as a bonus feature on the 2000 \"Big Daddy\" DVD.\n\nFor the single release \"When I Grow Up\" was remixed by Danny Tenaglia; he provided a full club remix and a dub version (\"Golden Shower dub\"), as well as a short vocal cut (\"Shirlapella\"). All three mixes were pressed to vinyl for club play in Europe, the full club mix and a radio edit were also serviced to North American DJs. In 2007, an edit of the club mix was included on the \"Garbage Mixes\" bonus disc of the \"Absolute Garbage (Special Edition)\" two-disc set. Both club and dub mixes were remastered and included on 2018's \"\" digital album.\n\nGarbage themselves produced a new single version, downplaying the guitar elements and with additional synth, for the North American Top 40 radio release. This mix was serviced in two forms; one (\"Pop Mix Main\") and the other (\"Alt Pop Mix\") replaced the lyrics \"Happy hours, golden showers\" with \"Happy lovers, ache for hours\" and \"Unexpected, unprotected, damn the consequences\" with \"Unprotected, unexpected, fear the consequences\" for radio play. This new version was remastered for \"Version 2.0: The Official Remixes\", however used the standard lyrics, and was cut a few bars longer, and included an extra lyric: \"How'd you like it best, you'll let me know\".\n\n\"When I Grow Up\" experienced a mostly positive response from music journalists upon the impact of \"Version 2.0\" and again upon single release. Stephen Jones of \"Music Week\" posted a track-by-track review of \"Version 2.0\" as the album campaign launched, where he described \"When I Grow Up\" as \"pure pop in a Strawberry Switchblade vein\", and adding that the song was his favourite track. Bradley Bamberger, in his album campaign launch write-up for \"Billboard\", described the song as \"a disco-fied girl group essay on teen angst the long-term benefits of a forward-minded attitude\". \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s album reviewer compared the song's \"breathy refrain\" to 70's/80's group Blondie, while Paul Brannigan also compared the song to Blondie [\"... gone Eurodisco\"] in his album review for \"Kerrang!\". In a review for \"Select\", John Harris wrote that \"When I Grow Up\" was \"one of the album's only real troughs\", adding that the lyrical matter makes the song sound like \"the kind of icky floss they play at the end of \"California Dreams\". Tom Laskin, in his review for \"Goldmine\", noted Manson's \"fluffy Kim Wilde delivery\" wasn't very interesting, but that it fitted the \"buoyant pop setting\". In single reviews for \"Billboard\", Chuck Taylor wrote that the song was \"edgier, more daring, and lots more fun than the average pop hit\", and later described the \"Pop Mix\" as \"an artful slice of bubblegum\". Michael Paolettea wrote of the Danny Tenaglia remixes, \"with a rubbery bassline, squiggly synth patterns and \"Plastic Dreams\" inspired drum programming... the song now travels down a road less rocky, but no less energetic\".\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1694 the ship sailed for Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia) on her fifth voyage, but did not reach its destination and was never heard from again. She is now thought to have been shipwrecked off the west coast of Australia.\n\nShe was built in Amsterdam, Dutch Republic in 1682 by the VOC, and registered at Vlissingen. She was long and wide, with a gross tonnage of about 520 tons.\n\n\"Ridderschap van Holland\" completed four voyages before her fateful final voyage.\n\nOn 11 July 1693, \"Ridderschap van Holland\" departed Wielingen on a voyage to Batavia under Captain Dirk de Lange. She arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on 9 January 1694, remaining there until 5 February. She sailed from the Cape with a crew of around 300, and two passengers, including Admiral Sir James Couper. She never reached her destination, and was never heard from again. Contemporary rumours suggested that she had sprung her mast rounding the Cape, limped north and been captured by pirates based at Fort Dauphin, near the south-eastern corner of Madagascar. However, Abraham Samuel, the pirate supposedly responsible, did not arrive in the area until 1697.\n\nIn 1697, Willem de Vlamingh was sent with three ships to search for \"Ridderschap van Holland\" at Île Saint-Paul and Île Amsterdam, and then along the west coast of Australia. Nothing was found. Two years later, two ships made investigations while visiting Madagascar, but without success.\n\nIt is probable that \"Ridderschap van Holland\" was actually wrecked in the Pelsaert Group of the Houtman Abrolhos islands off the coast of Western Australia. The crew of a later East Indiaman, \"Zeewijk\", which was wrecked on Pelsaert Island in 1727, discovered the remains of a Dutch ship of approximately the correct antiquity on their island, together with numerous artifacts, such as bottles, that suggested some of a ship's crew had survived in the islands for a considerable time. John Lort Stokes, captain of , also saw these artifacts in 1840. It is now widely thought that these artifacts were from \"Ridderschap van Holland\", although it is possible that they came from , which disappeared in 1724 and is now thought to have been wrecked near Cocos Islands.\n\nAny archaeological remains were destroyed by guano mining on the island in the early 20th century, so positive identification of the wreck is now impossible.\n\n"}

He was also briefly King of Judea 67–66 BCE and then the ethnarch (ruler) of Judea, probably over the period 47–40 BCE.\n\nHyrcanus was the eldest son of Alexander Jannaeus, King and High Priest, and Alexandra Salome. After the death of Alexander in 76 BCE, his widow succeeded to the rule of Judea and installed her elder son Hyrcanus as High Priest. Alexander had numerous conflicts with the Pharisees. However Hyrcanus was supported by the Pharisees, especially later in his tenure.\n\nWhen Salome died in 67 BCE, she named Hyrcanus as her successor as ruler of Judea as well, but soon he and his younger brother, Aristobulus II, dissented over the right to the throne.\n\nHyrcanus had scarcely reigned three months when Aristobulus II rose in rebellion. Hyrcanus advanced against him at the head of his mercenaries and his followers. The brothers met in a battle near Jericho with many of Hyrcanus' soldiers going over to Aristobulus II, and thereby gave the latter the victory.\n\nHyrcanus took refuge in the citadel of Jerusalem; but the capture of the Temple by Aristobulus II compelled Hyrcanus to surrender. A peace was then concluded in which Hyrcanus was to renounce the throne and the office of high priest, but was to enjoy the revenues of the latter office.\n\nThis agreement did not last. Hyrcanus feared that Aristobulus was planning his death. Such fears were furthered by Hyrcanus' adviser, Antipater the Idumean. According to Josephus, Antipater sought to control Judea by putting the weak Hyrcanus back onto the throne. Hyrcanus took refuge with Aretas III, King of the Nabataeans, who had been bribed by Antipater into supporting Hyrcanus' cause through the promise of returning Arabian towns taken by the Hasmoneans.\n\nThe Nabataeans advanced toward Jerusalem with an army of 50,000, took the city and besieged the Temple where Aristobulus had taken refuge for several months. During the siege, Josephus states that the adherents of Hyrcanus stoned the pious Onias (Honi ha'Me'agel, also Khoni or Choni ha-Me'agel), who had refused to pray for the demise of their opponents, and further angered the priests who were fighting along with Aristobulus by selling them cattle for the paschal sacrifice for the enormous price of one thousand drachmae and then refused to deliver the promised animals for the sacrifice.(\"Antiquities of the Jews\" Book 14, 2:2)\n\nDuring the Roman civil war, the Roman general Pompey defeated armies of the kingdoms of Pontus and the Seleucids. He sent his deputy Marcus Aemilius Scaurus to take possession of Seleucid Syria.\n\nAs the Hasmoneans were allies of the Romans, both brothers appealed to Scaurus, each endeavouring through gifts and promises to win him over to his side. Scaurus, moved by a gift of 400 talents, decided in favour of Aristobulus and ordered Aretas to withdraw his army. During his retreat, the Nabateans suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Aristobulus. Scaurus returned to Damascus.\n\nWhen Pompey arrived in Syria in 63 BCE, both brothers and a third party that desired the removal of the entire dynasty (according to some sources, these may have been the representatives of the Pharisees), sent their delegates to Pompey, who delayed making a decision. He favoured Hyrcanus over Aristobulus, deeming the elder, weaker brother a more reliable ally of the Roman Empire.\n\nAristobulus, suspicious of Pompey's intentions, entrenched himself in the fortress of Alexandrium, but when the Roman army approached Judea, he surrendered and undertook to deliver Jerusalem over to them. However, since many of his followers were unwilling to open the gates, the Romans besieged and captured the city by force, badly damaging city and the temple. Aristobulus was taken to Rome a prisoner and Hyrcanus restored as high priest in Jerusalem.\n\nBy around 63 BCE, Hyrcanus had been restored to his position as High Priest but not to the Kingship. Political authority rested with the Romans whose interests were represented by Antipater, who primarily promoted the interests of his own house. In 47 BCE, Julius Caesar restored some political authority to Hyrcanus by appointing him ethnarch. This however had little practical effect, since Hyrcanus yielded to Antipater in everything.\n\nIn 40 BCE, Aristobulus' son Antigonus Mattathias allied himself with the Parthians and was proclaimed King and High Priest. Hyrcanus was seized and his ears mutilated (according to Josephus, Antigonus bit his uncle's ears off) to make him permanently ineligible for the priesthood.\n\nThen Hyrcanus was taken by the Parthians into captivity in Babylonia, where he lived for four years amid the Babylonian Jews, who paid him every mark of respect.\n\nIn 36 BCE, Herod I, who had vanquished Antigonus with Roman help and feared that Hyrcanus might persuade the Parthians to help him regain the throne, invited the former High Priest to return to Jerusalem. Hyrcanus accepted and Herod received him with every mark of respect, assigning to him the first place at his table and the presidency of the state council.\n\nHowever, in 30 BCE Herod charged Hyrcanus with plotting with the Nabateans and put him to death.

At its northern end is the city of Coeur d'Alene. It spans in length and ranges from 1 to wide with over of shoreline.\n\nThe lake was named after the Coeur d'Alene people.\n\nLake Coeur d'Alene, like other lakes surrounding the Spokane Valley and Rathdrum Prairie, was formed by the Missoula Floods, most recently 12,000 to 15,000 years ago. The Purcell Lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet flowed south from Canada, carving the basin of present-day Lake Pend Oreille and damming the Clark Fork river. The impounded river repeatedly filled to form Glacial Lake Missoula and broke through the ice dam, resulting in massive floods that filled the Rathdrum Prairie area with sand, gravel, and boulders. Large eddy bars formed downstream from bedrock obstructions, thereby damming tributary valleys and creating lakes. Lake Coeur d'Alene is fed primarily by two rivers, the Coeur d'Alene and the Saint Joe. The outflow is via the Spokane River.\n\nThe lake's elevation varies from above sea level in the summer to up to lower in the winter, controlled by the Post Falls Dam below the lake on the Spokane River.\n\nThe lake's average surface temperature between June 1 and September 30 is .\n\nThe first-recorded European to see the area was explorer David Thompson in 1807.\n\nFlooding as a result of the construction and operation of the Post Falls Dam drastically changed the shape and size of the lake, expanding it to combine several smaller lakes into one.\n\nThe lake has been used for transporting lumber by water in Kootenai County since the timber industry started in the region. Prior to a fire in 1917, Harrison was planned as the county seat of Kootenai County, as the swiftly growing lumber town was at an opportune junction of the St. Joe and Coeur d' Alene rivers. After the fire, the mills were moved mostly to the city of Coeur d'Alene, which developed more and was designated as the county seat.\n\nA number of Ford Model T automobiles sitting on the bottom of the lake are the result of people in the early 1900s choosing to drive in winter across the frozen lake. But they did not always judge how thick the ice was, and went through. Steamboats on the bottom resulted from being burned and sunk as wrecks when they were no longer of use to ferry people around the lake. Since the late 20th century, divers frequently visit these ruins on the bottom as part of their recreation.\n\nThe Coeur d'Alene Tribe owns the southern third of Lake Coeur d'Alene and its submerged lands as part of its reservation, in addition to miles of the Saint Joe River and its submerged lands, all of which the United States holds in trust for the tribe. Its rights to the lake and river were established in the first executive order founding its reservation, which originally included all of the lake. In \"United States v. Idaho\" (2001), the United States Supreme Court held that an 1873 executive order issued by President Ulysses S. Grant formalized ownership by the tribe.\n\nWhile the court holding has not affected usage and access to Lake Coeur d'Alene, the Environmental Protection Agency has ruled that the tribe may set its own water-quality standards on its portion of Lake Coeur d'Alene.\n\nLake Coeur d'Alene is a popular tourist site for many people during the summer, offering great beaches and scenic views. A seasonal hobby of some local residents is viewing the bald eagles as they feed on the kokanee in the lake, mainly from the Wolf Lodge Bay. The North Idaho Centennial Trail, popular among cyclists, walkers, and joggers, follows along the lake's north and northeastern shore. The Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes also runs along the southern shores.\n\nFor a decade, the lake hosted unlimited hydroplane races for the Diamond Cup (1958–1966, 1968).\n\nIdaho State Parks and public facilities\n\nThe song \"Coeur d'Alene\" by the rock band Alter Bridge from their third album \"AB III\" is about this lake.\n\n\n"}

The bi-monthly comic, published by Bill Gaines and edited by Al Feldstein, began with issue 1 in February/March 1952. Over a four-year span, it ran for 18 issues, ending with the December/January 1955 issue.\n\nFront covers were by Feldstein, Wally Wood, Johnny Craig, George Evans and Jack Kamen. Kamen was the comic's most prolific artist, usually doing the lead eight-page story in each issue. Other stories were illustrated by Craig, Evans, Wood, Graham Ingels, Jack Davis, Al Williamson, Joe Orlando, Reed Crandall, Bernard Krigstein and Frank Frazetta. Writing was handled by Gaines and Feldstein exclusively through the first 12 issues with the exception of a single story written by Craig. Over the last 6 issues other writers that contributed included Carl Wessler, Otto Binder, and Jack Oleck.\n\nIssue 13 featured \"Squeeze Play\", the only solo story Frank Frazetta drew for EC.\n\n\"Shock SuspenStories\" originated in early 1952 as a \"sampler\" featuring stories of various genres. Gaines and Feldstein explained the comic's origin and the source of its title in the first issue:\n\nThe war story would be immediately phased out with the second issue, replaced with a message story – the \"Shock SuspenStory\". Bhob Stewart discussed the \"Shock SuspenStory\" in his notes for the EC Library, which reprinted all 18 issues of this title:\n\nOver the next three years \"Shock SuspenStories\" tackled many controversial issues, including racism (\"The Guilty\" in #3, \"In Gratitude\" in #11), mob hysteria (\"The Patriots\" in #2), police corruption (\"Confession\" in #4), vigilantism (\"Under Cover\" in #6), drug addiction (\"The Monkey\" in #12) and rape (\"The Assault\" in #8, \"A Kind of Justice\" in #16). The sampler format remained for the remaining three stories in the title until the end of 1953. With #12, the horror and science fiction stories were phased out, and the comic then focused primarily on shock and crime stories for the remainder of its run.\n\nAs with the other EC comics edited by Feldstein, the stories in this comic were primarily based on Gaines reading a large number of suspense stories and using them to develop \"springboards\" from which he and Feldstein could launch new stories. Specific story influences that have been identified include the following:\n\n\nAnecdotes from Bennett Cerf's \"Try and Stop Me\" were sources for stories, including \"Yellow\" (issue 1) and \"The Patriots\" (issue 2).\n\nAfter their unauthorized adaptation of one of Ray Bradbury's stories in another magazine, Bradbury contacted EC about their plagiarism of his work. They reached an agreement for EC to do authorized versions of Bradbury's short fiction. These official adaptations include:\n\n\nIssue #14 contained two of the title's most controversial stories, \"The Orphan\", which featured a ten-year-old girl murdering her father and framing her mother, and \"The Whipping\" which featured a bigoted father mistakenly beating his daughter to death under the impression that she was her Hispanic boyfriend. Gaines was questioned extensively about both stories by the Senate Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency in April 1954.\n\n\"Shock SuspenStories\" was one of five comics voluntarily folded by publisher Bill Gaines in 1955 due to the outcry over horror and crime comics.\n\n\"Shock SuspenStories\" has been reprinted numerous times over the years. Ballantine Books reprinted selected stories in a series of paperback EC anthologies in 1964–1966. The magazine was fully reprinted in a series of three black-and-white hardbacks by publisher Russ Cochran as part of \"The Complete EC Library\" in 1981. Between September 1992 and December 1996, Cochran (in association with Gemstone Publishing) reprinted the full 18 individual issues. This complete run was later rebound, with covers included, in a series of four softcover \"EC Annuals\". In 2006, Cochran and Gemstone began to publish hardcover, re-colored volumes of \"Shock SuspenStories\" as part of the \"EC Archives\" series. Two volumes (of a projected three) were published before Gemstone's financial troubles left the project in limbo. GC Press LLC, a boutique imprint established by Russ Cochran and Grant Geissman, announced in a press release dated September 1, 2011 that it was continuing the EC Archives series, with the first new releases scheduled for November.\nDark Horse Comics have subsequently published both Shock Suspenstories EC Archives volume 1 and volume 3 (published in April 2015)\n"}

{"id": "2323367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323367", "title": "Pack River", "text": "Pack River\n\nThe Pack River is a medium-sized river located in Northern Idaho. It is about long and drains a high mountainous area of the Idaho Panhandle's Rocky Mountains and Selkirk Mountains. The river flows into Lake Pend Oreille and is part of the Columbia River watershed via the Pend Oreille River.\n\nIts headwaters originate in the Selkirk Mountains, and flow in a southerly direction to the river’s mouth at the northern tip of Lake Pend Oreille. It is the second largest tributary to the lake, after the Clark Fork River.\n\nThe Pack River basin drains approximately . Watershed elevation ranges from a high of to a low point of at the lake, with a basin-wide average elevation of 3,730 ft. The upper portion of the watershed is mostly forested, and managed by the U.S. Forest Service. The lower watershed is under mixed public and private ownership, and supports a variety of uses.\n\nMean annual precipitation in the basin is , much of which falls as winter snow in the mountains. Mean annual river flow at a mid-river gage is , with the highest mean monthly flows occurring in May (939 ft³/s) and the lowest mean monthly flow in September (54.7 ft³/s). Peak river flows for a 100-year event exceed . Pack River and its tributaries often experience more than one run-off event per year. Mid-winter rain-on-snow events can result in rapid snow melt, and in some years the peak flow from tributary watersheds occurs during these events. Following the Sundance wildfire in 1967, removal of the forest canopy was hypothesized to have produced an increase in annual stream flow from the basin and an advance of the peak flows by virtue of decreased transpiration losses and earlier snowmelt runoff generation.\n\nThe Pack River has about 34 tributaries. Grouse Creek is the biggest, followed by Rapid Lightning Creek, Jeru Creek, and Hellroaring Creek. These along with the West Branch of the Pack River are the crucial streams forming the River's size.\nThe underlying geology in the Pack River watershed is largely granitic, which decomposes into fine particles. Glaciation in the Pack River valley formed ice dams upstream of the confluence of many tributaries, resulting in large deposits of glacial till. Fine sandy sediments deposited in the dammed water are known as glacial fluvial deposits. These sandy areas today appear on mountain side slopes, forming very erosive soils.\n\nBecause of the high potential for sediment delivery to the Pack River, land use practices such as road building, timber harvesting, grazing, agriculture, and residential development must be carefully managed. Any loss of riparian vegetation and associated root masses can result in delivery of fine sediment to the stream channel.\n\nThe Pack River watershed is home to a number of species protected by the Endangered Species Act. Bull trout, a threatened species, hatch in the upper river, and migrate the length of the river to grow upwards of 30 inches in Lake Pend Oreille before returning as adults to spawn again in the upper river. Terrestrial species found here include the endangered woodland caribou and grey wolf, and threatened species grizzly bear, Canada lynx, and bald eagle. Idaho wildlife species of special concern supported by the Pack River watershed include the wolverine, fisher, northern goshawk, and the white-winged crossbill.\n\nOther relatively abundant wildlife species that rely on this watershed include westslope cutthroat and brook trout, kokanee salmon, white-tailed deer, mule deer, moose, elk, black bear, mountain lion, mountain goat, river otter, mink, muskrat, beaver, osprey, peregrine falcon, turtles, a variety of hawks and owls, migratory songbirds and waterfowl, several species of game birds, and many other wetland species.\n\nNear the mouth of the river is the Pack River Flats Wildlife Management Area managed by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, located east-northeast of the town of Sandpoint and northwest of the town of Hope. The Pack River Flats is home to a wide variety of wildlife. Canada geese nest on the platforms in the marsh. Geese, swans, and ducks congregate here in spring and fall during their migration. This area also provides public access to wildlife viewing, hunting, and fishing. The Pack River Flats is important ecologically to moose, deer, elk, and waterfowl. Although there is currently no active eagle nesting here, eagles come to the area in the winter to feed on carrion and waterfowl. Before completion of Albeni Falls Dam on the Pend Oreille River in 1952, the lake level dropped after the spring runoff. Pack River Flats was a natural meadow then, and archaeological evidence suggests that it was historically an important site for Native Americans.\n\nThe Pack River supports numerous recreational pursuits. Fishing, kayaking, canoeing, and river floating are common activities. To protect the river environment and reduce conflicts with other recreationists, motorized watercraft are prohibited above the Highway 200 bridge. In the watershed, hiking, hunting, snowmobiling, rock climbing, and wildlife viewing opportunities abound.\n\nThe Pack River Watershed Council was formed in 2001 to coordinate watershed restoration projects along the river. \n\n"}

Much of the farmland is of alluvial silt and clay which has been reclaimed from the sea amounting to approximately half of the total parish area.\n\nTerrington St Clement in area is the largest village in Norfolk, and the second largest in the country.\n\nThe name Terrington derives from the old English for 'Farm/settlement of Tir(a)'s people' as \"-ingtūn\" means a settlement called after, or connected with... . \n\nIn AD 1013 Godric, son of Æthelstan Mannessune gifted part of the lands of \"Turrintonea\" to the monks of Ramsey Abbey in his will where his brother, Eadnoth the Younger had been abbott. This is recorded in the S1518 Charter\n\nThe settlement, along with Terrington St John is referred to in the \"Domesday Book\" as \"Tilinghetuna\" where the population is recorded as 25 households made up of 12 villagers, 11 smallholders, 1 freeman, and 1 slave in 1086. Other resources recorded in 1086 included 515 sheep, 14 pigs, 11 cattle, and 1 cob with 48 acres of meadow and 12.5 salthouses. Prior to the Norman conquest of England the lands were held by Thorth, son of Ulfkil and Thorkil with them being transferred to Henry de Ferrers and Ralph Barnard by 1086. \n\nBy the medieval period the small settlement which began on raised ground on the edge of the marsh had grown substantially. A parish church, dedicated to St Clement (Pope Clement I), known as the \"Cathedral of the Marshland\", was built in the 14th century by Edmund Gonville, Rector of Terrington, who founded Gonville Hall (now Gonville and Caius College) at Cambridge University.\n\nJohn Colton (died 1404), Lord Chancellor of Ireland and Archbishop of Armagh, was born in the village.\n\nMethodists were established in the village in 1813. During the Victorian era a Wesleyan Methodist chapel, a Primitive Methodist chapel, a Salvation Army headquarters and three other mission chapels were established.\n\nTerrington railway station once served the settlement.\n\nTerrington St Clement facilities include two doctor's surgeries, a post office, a village hall and a scout hut. Commercial amenities include a supermarket, a farm shop, a newsagent's, a baker's, a fish & chip shop, a Chinese takeaway, a hairdresser's, an estate agent, and a hardware store; there are two public houses, the King William and the Wildfowler.\n\nThe village is linked to King's Lynn and Spalding and Wisbech by bus services.\n\nTerrington St Clement has state run primary and secondary schools. St Clement's High School was the centre of some press attention, firstly when its previous head, Richard Wealthall, was singled out for praise and a visit from Prime Minister Tony Blair, and again subsequently when he was found to have been guilty of bullying and nepotism.\n\nThe school was placed into special measures in 2007 by Ofsted. A following 2011 Ofsted report gave the school an overall Grade 2 'Good' rating. The school obtained another 'Good' rating from Ofsted in 2017.\n\n"}

{"id": "2323382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323382", "title": "Prayer in the Hebrew Bible", "text": "Prayer in the Hebrew Bible\n\nPrayer in the Hebrew Bible is an evolving means of interacting with God, most frequently through a spontaneous, individual, unorganized form of petitioning and/or thanking. Standardized prayer such as is done today is non-existent, though beginning in Deuteronomy, the Bible lays the groundwork for organized prayer, including basic liturgical guidelines, and by the Bible's later books, prayer has evolved to a more standardized form, although still radically different from the form practiced by modern Jews.\n\nIndividual prayer is described by the \"Tanakh\" two ways. The first of these is when prayer is described as occurring, and a result is achieved, but no further information regarding a person's prayer is given. In these instances, such as with Isaac, Moses, Samuel, and Job, the act of praying is a method of changing a situation for the better. The second way in which prayer is depicted is through fully fleshed out episodes of prayer, where a person's prayer is related in full. Many famous biblical personalities have such a prayer, including every major character from Hannah to Hezekiah.\n\nOften in the Hebrew Bible, individuals spontaneously pray to God when faced with difficulty or having avoided it. As mentioned above, these prayers are not always given in full, however, many are fully related. Certain themes appear throughout the Tanakh's portrayal of this prayer type. One of the most significant is the idea of argumentation, which is frequently described by the text, or its interpreters. \n\nListed chronologically below are these occurrences of recorded individual prayer.\n\nThe first notable prayer whose text is recorded in the Torah and Hebrew Bible occurs when Abraham pleads with God not to destroy the people of Sodom, where his nephew Lot resides. He bargains with God not to destroy the city if there are fifty good men within, and eventually lowers to total to ten. God sends two angels to the city, which is ultimately destroyed with \"burning sulfur\" when they cannot find the ten requisite good people.\n\nWhen Abraham is an old man, he makes his head servant, who while not named specifically, is almost certainly Eliezer of Damascus, promise to find his son Isaac a wife from his people to marry. Eliezer expresses uncertainty that a woman will agree to return to Abraham's household, especially since he is told not to bring Isaac with him. In response, Abraham tells Eliezer that God will send an angel to assure his success in his mission. Eliezer, however, upon reaching the town of Nahor's well during evening, when the women of the city would draw water, begins to pray. \n\nEliezer's prayer makes very specific of God, hoping that God will make clear which woman is to be Isaac's wife. It takes on a petitioning tone, as opposed to the argumentative one prominent in the prayers of other characters, including his master, whose relationship and interactions with God are very different. Before he has finished with his prayer, his requests begin to be granted, and sees that Rebbecca is the chosen maiden. Eliezer rushes home with her and she and Isaac are married.\n\nWhen Jacob is to reunite with his brother Esau, he prays in distress that God save him from what he fears will be an attack on him, his family, and his servants. Similarly to his grandfather Abraham, his prayer lays out an argument, in this case by invoking statements God had made in the past to convince God to aid him. Jacob's prayer does not seem to impact his optimism, for when Esau approaches, he divides his children among his maidservants and wives, so as to protect them from what he still feels is an immanent attack. The Torah, however, when taken literally, describes a joyful meeting, with Esau disregarding formalities so as to embrace his brother, although interpreters suggest Esau actually attacked his younger brother.\n\nMoses, the most recurring character in the Torah, prays comparatively little in a truly spontaneous petitioning or thanking form. The one occasion that is most definitely prayer takes place when, in the Book of Exodus, following the making of the Golden Calf, he prays for God to be merciful with his people. The literal reading of the text does not include an argument made by Moses, in a similar manner to other characters, however, Rashi describes him as blaming God for the people's sin, and therefore interprets the prayer to be more similar to those said by Abraham and Jacob.\n\n\"See: Song of the sea\"\n\nIn the Book of Joshua, the Israelites battle against many different opposing nations. The book's seventh chapter describes how God punishes His people by causing them to lose a battle as a result of their sinning. Following news of the defeat, Joshua and the elders of Israel tear their clothes and lie face down in front of the Ark of the Covenant, and following that, Joshua prays to God bemoaning his people's lowered moral, vulnerability to attack, and possible extermination.\n\nIn 1 Samuel 1, Hannah prays for a child. 1 Samuel 1:13 says that \"Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard\" (NIV). The priest Eli thinks that she is drunk, but Hannah protests her innocence. After Hannah gives birth to a son, Samuel, she prays a prayer which is recorded in 1 Samuel 2:1-10. This is normally called the Song of Hannah, but according to 1 Samuel 2:1, it is a prayer.\n\nEugene Peterson suggests that to Eli, the \"normal way of prayer\" was \"by means of ritual, incense, and animal sacrifice, a gathering of the community directed by a priest.\" Hannah is \"soaring past all the liturgical conventions of her age... She uses her own words, her own voice, without intermediaries.\"\n\nOrganized prayer is first introduced in the Hebrew Bible in Deuteronomy, when the recitation of prayer over the fruit bringing sacrifice is mandated, and liturgy established for the first time, in Deuteronomy. Moses mandates that one who goes to offer the sacrifice recite a basic creed, declaring his people's heritage and history, as well as a prayer of thanks to God for the fruits they have harvested. Moses also requires Israelites to, at certain times, recite a declaration saying they have not transgressed any of the \"mitzvot.\"\n\n"}

In 1888, the Nebraska Christian Missionary Alliance, an affiliate of the Disciples of Christ, obtained the land and founded Nebraska Christian University in 1889. The following year, in 1890, the institution was renamed Cotner College in honor of Omaha resident Samuel Cotner, a major donor to the college. The town of Bethany Heights formed around the college and was incorporated in 1890.\n\nBoth the college and the town remained small, Cotner College opened with a class of 30 students in 1889 and by 1900, Bethany Heights had a population of only 360, despite being a suburb of Lincoln which in the same year had 37,000 residents. Despite its small size, Cotner College was ambitious in its courses, being one of few colleges to offer studies in medicine and dentistry at the time. Cotner College also offered courses in religious and biblical studies, education, business, and liberal arts.\n\nBethany Heights was annexed by Lincoln in 1926 and Cotner College closed Bethany Heights location in 1933. However, Cotner College as an institution continued to exist in various forms, such as the Cotner School of Religion which operated two locations, one opened in 1945 across the street from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln's East Campus and the other opened in 1954 across the street from the University of Nebraska—Lincoln's Downtown Campus. These locations allowed UNL students to minor in religious studies through dual enrollment at both Cotner and the University of Nebraska. Upon the closure of its Bethany Heights location, the medical and dental departments were given over to the University of Nebraska, creating the foundation for those departments at the university.\n\nAylesworth Hall, the main building of Cotner College, was demolished in the early 1950s and the land was sold off as individual residential lots. However, the former dormitory still stands and is currently used as an apartment building.\n\n\n"}

It was published in book form in 1851, and became an early Victorian classic which sold out three editions. In the \"Advertisement to the First Edition\", which prefaces it, it is called a fairy tale, one, it might be added, that illustrates the triumph of love, kindness, and goodness over evil; however, it could also be characterised as a fable, a fabricated origin myth and a parable. It was illustrated with 22 illustrations by Richard Doyle (1824–83). It was then illustrated by Arthur Rackham in 1932.\n\nThe richness of the Treasure Valley, high in the mountains of Stiria or Styria, southeastern Austria, is lost through the evil of the owners, the two elder, \"Black Brothers\", Hans and Schwartz, who in their foolishness mistreat Southwest Wind, Esquire, who in turn floods their valley, washing away their assets, and turning their valley into a dead valley of red sand.\n\nThis personified wind has the power to keep things this way through his influence with other winds that had caused the valley's unique fertility. Forced into a trade other than farming Hans and Schwartz become goldsmiths. They cruelly melt their younger brother Gluck's prize heirloom, a golden mug, which consists of the head of a golden-bearded man. This action releases the King of the Golden River for Gluck to pour out of the crucible as a finely dressed little golden dwarf. The Golden River is one of the high mountain cataracts that surround the Treasure Valley. Gluck fancies that it would be good if that high majestic river would actually be what it appears in the setting sun, a river of gold. The dwarfish king disagrees with Gluck, but offers a proposition: if someone were to climb up to the source of the river and throw into it at least three drops of holy water, it would become for that person only a river of gold. That person must do it on his first and only attempt or be overwhelmed by the river to become a black stone.\n\nHans and Schwartz desire to take the challenge, duel each other with the result that Schwartz is thrown into jail for disturbing the peace. Hans, who had the good sense to hide from the constable, steals holy water from the church and climbs up the mountains to the Golden River. He has a hard time of it on a glacier and gets away without his provisions and only his flask of holy water. Overcome with thirst Hans is forced to drink from this flask, knowing that only three drops are all that's needed. Along the path, Hans comes across three prostrate individuals dying of thirst, a puppy, a fair child, and an old man. Hans satisfies his own thirst while denying the three needy individuals.\n\nThe surroundings on his journey turn bleak and inauspicious, climaxing in Hans being transformed into a black stone once he has hurled the holy water flask into the Golden River. Gluck secures the release of his brother Schwartz, who, buying his holy water from a \"bad priest\", eventually fares likewise, spurning in his turn the fair child, the old man, and his brother Hans lying prostrate in his path. The Golden River then acquires another black stone around which to rush and wail.\nGluck takes a turn at climbing the mountain. He encounters first an old man walking down the mountain trail who begs water from the flask. Gluck allows him to drink, leaving only a third of the holy water. He then encounters a fair child, lying by the road, whom he allows to drink all but a few drops. Following these unselfish acts, Gluck's path is made bright and pleasant making him feel better than he had in his whole life—no doubt, due to his kindness. He then comes across the prostrate puppy, whom he gives the final drops of the holy water. The puppy turns into the King of the Golden River, who tells Gluck the reason for the deadly fate of his two brothers: the water they had thrown into the river was made unholy by their denying it to those dying of thirst on the way. Thereupon, he shakes three drops of dew from a lily into Gluck's flask to throw into the river and then vanishes by evaporation. Gluck throws the dew drops into the Golden River, and it forms a whirlpool where it goes underground and then emerges in the Treasure Valley. The Treasure Valley becomes lush and fertile once again. Gluck the new owner is a wealthy man, who never turns away the needy from his door. Ever afterwards, though, the people show and tell travellers the tale of the two black stones in the Golden River, known as The Black Brothers.\n\n\nThis fairy tale also has the character of an aetiological myth—a story devised to explain why things are as they are in the world. It is structured like an epic saga with each of the chapters closing on one solitary curiosity: Chapter One, the card identifying Southwest Wind, Esquire; Chapter Two, the mug becoming a released King of the Golden River; Chapter Three, Hans becoming a black stone; Chapter Four, Schwartz becoming a companion black stone; and Chapter Five, the black stones being known as the \"Black Brothers\".\n\nAnother view is that of Oliver Lodge, editor, of the Everyman's Library edition of the work: \"The parable is in two halves, a sort of Paradise Lost and a Paradise Regained—lost by selfishness, regained by love.\"\n\nWater is the force that makes and unmakes things. The Treasure Valley never fails to have the proper watering to be perpetually lush. It is then destroyed by the water of a torrential flood. It is restored through the water of the Golden River becoming for the kindhearted Gluck a river of gold. Water's power appears in the treacherous glacier, which frightens those who traverse it with its sounds of rushing water and cracking ice. Water as \"holy water\" causes the miraculous transformation of the Golden River into a \"river of gold\" at the behest of the king. The King of the Golden River himself disappeared through the process of evaporation, a \"water\" phenomenon.\n\nIn this fairy tale the environment responds positively or negatively to human good or evil. There is the interplay of personified forces of nature like winds and rivers.\n\nLodge also enlightens us as to the lesson learned by the Black Brothers becoming goldsmiths and Gluck's wish that the Golden River become a literal river of gold: \"And the restoration of wealth to Treasure Valley, by restoring the fertility of its soil instead of by metalliferous undertakings, is entirely in harmony with the author's consistent teaching that all true material increase must come from the soil\". Note that the King of the Golden River was imprisoned through \"metalliferous undertakings\".\n\nAs stated above, this story could also be classed as a fable by which John Ruskin can impart to his readers that love, kindness, and philanthropy could transform the world as it did the Treasure Valley. No doubt, he speaks through the King of the Golden River when he tells Gluck: \"the water which has been refused to the cry of the weary and dying is unholy, though it had been blessed by every saint in heaven; and the water which is found in the vessel of mercy is holy, though it had been defiled with corpses\".\n\n"}

In the episode, the four boys learn that their idols, Terrance and Phillip, have split over credit issues. They try to get them back together in time for an upcoming festival, or else face death in the hands of a trio of unhinged, environment-obsessed activists. The show \"Behind the Blow\" is a parody of the VH1 TV Show \"Behind the Music\". The show also parodies Earth Day, portraying it as a \"brainwashing festival.\"\n\nKyle is watching the \"Terrance and Phillip Show\" with Stan, Cartman and Kenny, but it is a rerun. They are upset and complain, but an ad for a live show featuring Terrance and Phillip at the Denver Coliseum airs. They become excited to see the show, but at school the next morning, they find out that they will not be able to go because Earth Day is only a short time away, as three unscrupulous environmentalists who care about Earth Day brainwash people with the Jedi Mind Trick into believing what they say. Kyle, who got tickets for the foursome, eventually comes up with the idea of Terrance and Phillip performing at the Earth Day show, and everyone else agrees. \n\nThe day of the performance comes, and everyone who attends is shocked to find out that not only has Terrance become morbidly obese, but Phillip is not with him. Instead, there is a stand-in who performs with him, much to everyone's dismay. The boys manage to sneak in backstage, and demand to know what happened between the two performers. Terrance acknowledges that his stand-in is talentless, and tells them that he and Phillip have split up due to creative problems. They are in fact arguing over who deserves most of the credit for their show. Terrance informs the boys that Phillip is currently in Toronto, performing Canadian Shakespeare, but with or without him, he is willing to perform. The boys tell everyone at the Earth Day show about this issue. The environmentalists become violently angry, as they have already heavily promoted the appearance. The boys are told to go to Canada immediately to convince Phillip to perform, or face the consequences. The foursome travel to Toronto to see his performance in \"Hamlet\", which they find exceptionally dull. They inform Phillip of the Earth Day show after the play ends, but he initially refuses when they mention Terrance will be in it. Kyle lies to Phillip by telling him that the people of South Park only want to see Phillip anyway, and not Terrance. This placates him and he agrees to come, but all four boys worry about what will happen when they both come across each other at the festival and begin to argue.\n\nThe boys try to explain the problem to the environmentalists, but they do not care, as they are incredibly committed to their job. They instead threaten to kill them and chop off Kenny’s left arm with a butcher knife. Reluctantly, Terrance and Phillip agree to work together. During their rehearsal, they begrudgingly do a routine, which eventually boils down into an argument until they both leave in a huff. After the environmentalists chop Kenny's right arm off, the boys work together and present the audience with a documentary of Terrance and Phillip's rise and fall, featuring, among other clips, the duo appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show when they were children. While they are fascinated, the overreactive environmentalists become largely convinced that the boys \"ruined\" the festival once again, and they chase them, eventually chopping off Kenny's left leg. Terrance and Phillip watch the video from different viewpoints, and before they could leave the festival, they come across each other and reconcile.\n\nThe environmentalists corner the boys, chop off Kenny's right leg (rendering him completely limbless), and they almost kill the rest, but seeing Terrance and Phillip perform together finally convinces them to stop. This thrills everyone, including Kenny, who, by that point in severe pain, is nevertheless still alive.\n\nParker and Stone came up with the idea for this episode, \"Cartmanland\", and \"Towelie\" at a restaurant in Hawaii right after finishing production on their other series \"That's My Bush!\" According to Parker, this was one of their first episodes openly parodying liberals. The environmentalist with the butcher knife is based on Earth Day founder Ira Einhorn.\n\n\"Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow\", along with the fourteen other episodes from \"South Park: the Complete Fifth Season\", was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.\n\n"}

Rap, among others. During their tenure, producer Easy Mo Bee provided RZA (under the name Prince Rakeem) with his first hit single, \"Ooh I Love You Rakeem\", and produced much of GZA's (under the alias The Genius) first album, \"Words From the Genius\". Around this time, according to the Wu-Tang Manual, RZA accredits Easy Mo Bee with mentoring him and providing equipment for RZA to continue practicing beatmaking.\n\nIn 1994, after linking up with Bad Boy Entertainment, Mo Bee began producing a fair share of \"Ready to Die\", The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut album. The only rap feature on the album was Method Man, who appeared on the Easy Mo Bee-produced \"The What\". 1998 saw the producer produce for RZA once again, on the Ras Kass song \"The End\", and Wu-Tang member Raekwon was featured on Easy's solo album, \"Odyssey 2000: Now or Never\" alongside Busta Rhymes on the song \"Let's Make a Toast\". Seven years later, Mo Bee would go on to co-produce a track alongside RZA on the group's fifth group album, \"8 Diagrams\". Wu-Element producer True Master has also credited Easy Mo Bee with teaching him certain production tips, such as snare, hi-hat and volume change techniques.\n\nLike Easy Mo Bee, New York producer Pete Rock first began his association with the Wu-Tang before it was formally founded by playing mentor to RZA, then under the moniker Prince Rakeem. In the book \"The Wu-Tang Manual\", RZA admits to effectively stealing equipment from the successful producer, borrowing and never returning an MPC. Pete first produced for the Wu-Tang when its members Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Inspectah Deck and Method Man made appearances on his 1998 album \"Soul Survivor\". The following year, the producer provided beats for Raekwon's second album \"Immobilarity\", Inspectah Deck's debut album \"Uncontrolled Substance\", and Wu members RZA and GZA appeared on Pete's 2004 follow-up solo album \"Soul Survivor II\". Since then the frequency of Pete Rock's collaborations with the Wu-Tang have increased, as he provided production for Ghostface Killah's two 2006 solo albums, \"Fishscale\" and \"More Fish\" (including the unreleased song, \"Chunky\"); Masta Killa's 2006 second album \"Made in Brooklyn\"; the Raekwon- and Masta Killa-featuring song \"PJ's\" from his own third solo album, \"NY's Finest\"; the single \"A Yo\" from Method Man & Redman's \"Blackout! 2\"; the song \"Sonny's Missing\", from Raekwon's \"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II\"; and the track \"How You Like Me Baby?\" from Ghostface Killah's \"Apollo Kids\".\n\nIn 2000, Kanye West received some of his first major production placements on former Bad Boy producer D-Dot's debut album, \"Tell 'Em Why U Madd\", including the song \"Ghetto\", which featured Raekwon. In 2001, West produced the bulk of Jay-Z's successful and highly praised album \"The Blueprint\", implementing an augmented version of a technique pioneered by RZA; Kanye has since revealed that the beats he and fellow Roc producer Just Blaze produced were originally created for Ghostface Killah, before announcing that Ghostface inspired his sound and style. During the recording sessions for West's 2004 debut \"The College Dropout\", then-Roc-A-Fella artist Ol' Dirty Bastard recorded a chorus and backing vocals for the song \"Keep the Receipt,\" which was left off the album but released on a mixtape.\n\nIn 2006, Kanye was featured on the remix to Ghostface Killah's hit single, \"Back Like That.\" In 2010, West and Raekwon collaborated again on the Kanye-produced remix to Justin Bieber's single \"Runaway Love\". The beat, produced by West, playfully utilized elements from \"Wu Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit.\" Following up on the song, Raekwon guested on several tracks cut from West's \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\", which were released as songs in the producer's weekly G.O.O.D. Fridays series. On the album's release, Raekwon was featured on the track \"Gorgeous\" alongside West and Kid Cudi; in addition, RZA co-produced the song \"Dark Fantasy\" with West and producer No I.D., and appeared on the song \"So Appalled\" alongside Jay-Z, Pusha T and CyHi da Prince. RZA also produced the song \"New Day\" with West off the Kanye West & Jay-Z's collaborative effort Watch the Throne. More recently, both Raekwon and Ghostface Killah were featured on the G.O.O.D. Music compilation album, \"Cruel Summer\". In 2012, he and RZA collaborated on the track \"White Dress\" for the soundtrack for \"The Man with the Iron Fists\".\n\nWest Coast producer and Cypress Hill co-founder DJ Muggs began collaborating with the Wu-Tang in 1995, when RZA and U-God appeared on the RZA-produced Cypress Hill song \"Killa Hill Niggas\" from the album \"\". In 1997, Muggs produced the Method Man/Prodigy collaboration \"Bulworth.\" In addition, RZA and GZA appeared on his album \"Soul Assassins I\", and GZA appeared on the 2000 followup, \"Soul Assassins II\". In return, Muggs produced a song on GZA's 2002 album \"Legend of the Liquid Sword\", which led to Muggs and GZA recording the 2005 joint album \"Grandmasters\". That same year Muggs produced the song \"Black Opera\" for Skillz, which featured Raekwon. Additionally, GZA appeared on the DJ Muggs-produced Planet Asia album \"Pain Language\" in 2008. In 2009, Raekwon spoke about recording new material with DJ Muggs, presumably for his album \"Cuban Linx II\", but nothing surfaced until he appeared on the song \"Chase Manhattan\" from the DJ Muggs/Ill Bill album \"Kill Devil Hills\".\n\nFeatured heavily on the GZAs official DJ, DJ Symphonys \n\nThe self-proclaimed \"King of Mixtapes\", he is responsible for most of the Wu-Tang affiliated mixtapes and is the official tour DJ for Ghostface Killah.\n\nGhostface Killah's \"Fishscale\" also featured work by underground sensation and Detroit, Michigan producer J. Dilla, who died shortly after the release. However, just as the producer's music has continued to surface in other artists' projects, several productions Dilla created for Raekwon made the final cut of the rapper's 2009 album. The year 2009 witnessed the release of the long-delayed, highly anticipated \"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II\". The album made heavy use of longtime and short-term Wu-Tang associates, featuring frequent collaborators Pete Rock, Erick Sermon and Busta Rhymes while cementing the associate status of newer collaborators: namely, Beanie Sigel, J. Dilla, The Alchemist and Dr. Dre, all of whom have worked—in a limited capacity—with the Wu-Tang Clan previously.\n\nAs of 2010, the number of Wu-Tang affiliates has grown further: Capone-N-Noreaga, a rap duo from Queens, New York City, signed with Raekwon's IceH20 Records on February 18, 2010 and enlisted the Wu-Tang rapper to serve as an executive producer of their latest album, \"The War Report 2\". Bun B has also appeared on several songs with Wu-Tang members in 2009–10: after being featured on Method Man & Redman's \"Blackout! 2\", Bun made appearances on Raekwon's \"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II (Gold Edition)\", made up of tracks cut from the original product, and appeared on Redman's latest album \"Reggie\" alongside Redman and Method Man.\n\nSince 2009, RZA has made a series of appearances alongside Ohio blues rock band The Black Keys: \"Dollaz & Sense\" and \"Tellin' Me Things\" from the Dame Dash-sponsored collaborative album \"Blakroc\", and the single \"The Baddest Man Alive\" from \"The Man with the Iron Fists\" soundtrack. Pharoahe Monch appeared alongside RZA and others on the 1999 \"Wake Up Show Anthem,\" most of which uses the beat from \"Airwaves,\" an interlude from RZA's album \"Bobby Digital in Stereo\". Monch also featured Method Man on the remix to his 1999 single, \"Simon Says\"; he also collaborated with RZA on \"Dollaz & Sense,\" and appears with Ghostface Killah and M.O.P. on the soundtrack for \"The Man with the Iron Fists\", on the track \"Black Out.\"\n\n"}

Owned by the City of Mobile and operated by ASM Global, the facility consists of three venues: a theater, an expo hall, and an arena. It is suitable for large indoor events including sporting events and trade shows. The theater seats for 1,938, while the expo hall can seat 3,000. The largest venue of the Mobile Civic Center is the arena, which can seat 10,112.\n\nThe Civic Center started redevelopment in March 2018.\n\nThe structure opened as the Mobile Municipal Auditorium on July 9, 1964. It celebrated its opening with a \"Holiday on Ice\" ice skating show. It was built with the city's longtime Mardi Gras celebrations in mind. The concourse area is often used for balls during Mardi Gras. The building's \"entertainment profile increased significantly\" during the 1970s, hosting dozens of popular acts, including Elvis Presley, Led Zeppelin, Michael Jackson, the Rolling Stones, KISS, and Fleetwood Mac. It did not earn revenue however, and it stopped regularly booking big-name acts in the mid-1980s.\n\nIrregularities in the Civic Center's finances were spearheaded by finance director and former Mobile mayor Gary Greenough, who was convicted for multimillion-dollar fraud in 1985. The preceding year, the Civic Center posted losses of $435,000. The fraud charges, plus competition from other Gulf Coast auditoriums (in Biloxi and Pensacola) and the city's open Convention Center caused the complex to go into a decline.\n\nIn recent years, the complex has been called \"aging and deteriorating.\" By the early 2010s, the center ran a deficit $600,000–$800,000 per year. For many years, the auditorium has been used for the Mobile Opera, Mobile Ballet, Distinguished Young Women, Mobile International Festival, and high school graduation ceremonies. Top touring acts regularly skip the complex and it has been without a regular tenant since the departure of the Mobile Mysticks hockey team in 2002.\n\nOn January 29, 2015, Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson issued a statement announcing that the Civic Center will close in April 2016 for redevelopment. City officials were then in search of a public-private partnership to help fund the efforts. 11 months later, Stimpson delayed the closing by two years, needing more time to find a private partner interested in redevelopment.\n\nThe 1,940 seat theater is used for concerts, Broadway shows, and other theatrical events. The Theater is connected to the Arena by a glass promenade. The theater is known for its acoustics, unobstructed views, and backstage facilities. It contains a 90 by 60 foot (27 by 18 m) stage.\n\nWith 28,000 square feet (2600 m²) of space, the Expo Hall can be used for conventions, trade shows, sporting events, banquets, and even concerts as well as other events. It seats 2,200 for seating events and up to 3,000 for concerts. It has a 40 by 32 foot (12 by 28 m) portable stage and a dance floor that can accommodate 1,500.\n\nThe tallest building in the complex at seven stories tall, the Civic Center Arena (previously known as the Municipal Auditorium) features a domed roof. It features 80,000 square feet (7400 m) of space for sporting events and trade shows. There are 6,120 permanent seats at the arena, which for sporting events and concerts seats up to 10,112. The arena's main floor is encircled by 15 meeting rooms. There are eight concession stands, plus three locker rooms. In addition to trade shows, concerts, and sporting events, ice shows, circuses, wrestling, conventions and banquets can be held at the arena. The arena hosted the Mobile Mysticks of the East Coast Hockey League, WCW Beach Blast (1992), and Uncensored (1998), as well as hosting the Mobile Seagulls of the National Indoor Football League and Mobile Wizards of the af2. It also was the site of the 1991 Sun Belt Conference men's basketball tournament. The Mobile Revelers played at the venue from 2001-2003 until the team folded citing low attendance.\n\nThe 1998 opening of the Mitchell Center on the campus of the University of South Alabama sent most first-tier concert tours to the new arena. However, Mobile Civic Center Arena is still in use, and continues to serve as the Mobile stop of World Wrestling Entertainment, Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus, Disney on Ice and Champions on Ice.\n\nSeating capacities are: Hockey, 8,030; Basketball, 8,000; End-stage concerts, 8,119-9,920; Center-stage concerts, boxing and wrestling, 10,000.\n\n"}

The event runs from 7:00 pm to midnight, but party guests can enter at 4:00 pm. It requires a separate ticket from regular general admission.\n\nThe parade runs twice during the night. The parade makes its way down Main Street, USA with the glistening lights on Cinderella Castle in the background. Featuring favorite Disney characters Mickey and Minnie Mouse along with numerous other characters such as; Goofy, Chip 'n' Dale, Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Marching Toy Soldiers, Dancing Reindeer, Gingerbread men and Ole Saint Nick.\n\nA holiday edition of the Wishes fireworks show, Holiday Wishes involves a medley of the original Wishes soundtrack with some Christmas songs mixed in. The show starts with Tinker Bell flying overhead the castle with narration by Jiminy Cricket. Along with the fireworks there is lighting effects projected onto Cinderella Castle such as the appearance of Santa Claus and the castle turning green to appear as a Christmas tree. \n\nOn November 8, 2019, a new nighttime spectacular will be replaced entitled \"Minnie's Wonderful Christmastime\". \n\nShown four times during the night, Mickey's Most Merriest Celebration show can be seen on the stage in front of Cinderella's Castle. This show replaced the former stage show (Celebrate the Season) in 2016 and stars Disney characters such as Mickey and Minnie, Pluto, Donald Duck, Goofy, Snow White, Dopey, Clarabelle Cow, and Woody and Jessie dressed up in their Christmas outfits. In addition to characters, there are also live performers singing and dancing to classic Christmas carols.\n\nSometime in November, Cinderella Castle is covered in 200,000 LED lights to resemble being frosted in ice and snow — an effect called \"Castle Dream Lights on Cinderella Castle\". At dusk, there is a short show featuring the characters from Frozen in which Elsa uses her ice powers to frost over the castle. This show can be viewed by all guests every night in the holiday season and is repeated again during the time of the exclusive evening party.\n\nIn 2014, this show replaced one featuring the Fairy Godmother and Cinderella.\n\nA twenty-minute show performed a few times throughout the night at the Tomorrowland stage, featuring Buzz Lightyear and Mike Wazowski teaching Stitch the meaning of Christmas before he laser blasts Santa out of the sky.\n\nThere are generally two character dance parties throughout the night. Dance parties provide guests with the opportunity to dance with Disney characters such as Woody, Jessie and Bullseye. In the past the dance parties have been held in the Diamond Horseshoe and Cosmic Ray's Starlight Cafe.\n\nWhile not exclusive to the party, Jingle Cruise is limited to the Christmas season after debuting in 2013. The original Jungle Cruise ride is changed to include some Christmas details throughout the queue, a rename of the boats and some new jokes from the skippers.\n\nNumerous characters appear throughout the Magic Kingdom to meet guests and take pictures. The characters are dressed in holiday themed clothes, which are exclusive to the Christmas season. Along with the regular characters who appear in the park, some rare characters, such as the seven dwarfs, make appearances for special events.\n\nPopular attractions will be open throughout the party but Fastpass is not available for use. In the past some of the attractions that have been open are The Haunted Mansion, Space Mountain and Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin. The rides that are open are not guaranteed to be the same every year.\n\nComplimentary to all guests, there are numerous snack stations set up around the park. In addition to the traditional cookies and hot chocolate, some locations also offer Sno-Cones, eggnog, pretzels, and chocolate milk.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2323454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323454", "title": "Cessna 310", "text": "Cessna 310\n\nThe Cessna 310 is an American four-to-six-seat, low-wing, twin-engine monoplane produced by Cessna between 1954 and 1980. It was the first twin-engine aircraft that Cessna put into production after World War II.\n\nThe 310 first flew on January 3, 1953, with deliveries starting in late 1954. The sleek modern lines of the new twin were backed up by innovative features such as engine exhaust thrust augmenter tubes and the storage of all fuel in tip tanks in early models. In 1964, the engine exhaust was changed to flow under the wing instead of the augmenter tubes, which were considered to be noisy.\n\nTypical of Cessna model naming conventions, a letter was added after the model number to identify changes to the original design over the years. The first significant upgrade to the 310 series was the 310C in 1959, which introduced more powerful Continental IO-470-D engines. In 1960 the 310D featured swept-back vertical tail surfaces. An extra cabin window was added with the 310F.\n\nThe turbocharged 320 Skyknight was developed from the 310F. Equipped with TSIO-470-B engines and featuring an extra cabin window on each side, it was in production between 1961 and 1969 (the 320E was named the Executive Skyknight), when it was replaced by the similar Turbo 310.\n\nThe 310G was certified in 1961 and introduced the canted wingtip fuel tanks found on the majority of the Cessna twin-engine product line, marketed as \"stabila-tip\" tanks by Cessna, because they were meant to aid stability in flight. A single side window replaced the rear two windows on the 310K (certified in late 1965), with optional three-blade propellers being introduced as well. Subsequent developments included the 310Q and turbocharged T310Q with a redesigned rear cabin featuring a skylight window, and the final 310R and T310R, identifiable by a lengthened nose containing a baggage compartment. Production ended in 1980.\n\nOver the years there were several modifications to the 310 to improve performance. Noted aircraft engineer Jack Riley produced two variants, The Riley Rocket 310 and the Riley Turbostream 310. Riley replaced the standard Continental engines with Lycoming TIO-540 engines. These turbocharged intercooled engines were installed with three-blade Hartzell propellers in a counter-rotating configuration to further increase performance and single-engine safety. At . gross weight the aircraft had a weight to power ratio of . per horsepower. This resulted in a cruising speed of at and a 3,000 foot-per-minute rate of climb.\n\nThe Cessna 310 was a common charter aircraft for the many air taxi firms that sprang up in the general aviation boom that followed World War II. The advantages of the Cessna 310 over its contemporaries, such as the Piper PA-23, were its speed, operating costs and aftermarket modifications, such as the Robertson STOL kits that made it popular worldwide for its bush flying characteristics. It could use short runways, while at the same time carrying a large useful load of . or more, at speeds that were high for a twin engine piston aircraft.\n\nIn 1957, the United States Air Force (USAF) selected the Cessna 310 for service as a light utility aircraft for transport and administrative support. The USAF purchased 160 unmodified 310A aircraft with the designation L-27A and unofficially nicknamed \"Blue Canoe\", later changed to U-3A in 1962. An additional 36 upgraded 310 designated L-27B (later U-3B) were delivered in 1960–61; these aircraft were essentially military 310Fs and as such equipped with the more powerful engines and can be identified by their extra cabin windows, longer nose and swept vertical fin. A USAF study after one year of operational service found the U-3A had direct operating costs of less than $12 an hour. The U-3 saw active service in a support role when the USAF deployed aircraft to South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, where they were used on courier flights between air bases. Some USAF aircraft were later transferred to the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy and the type continued in United States military service into the mid-1970s.\n\n\nThe aircraft is popular with air charter companies and small feeder airlines, and is operated by private individuals and companies.\n\nCountries known to have operated the U-3/310 include.\n\n\n, the US National Transportation Safety Board has recorded 1,787 incidents for Cessna 310s since 12 January 1964. Only 436 of those incidents were fatal.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2323456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323456", "title": "Antigonus II Mattathias", "text": "Antigonus II Mattathias\n\nAntigonus II Mattathias (, Matityahu), also known as Antigonus the Hasmonean (died 37 BCE) was the last Hasmonean king of Judea. A puppet king installed by the Parthians, he was the son of King Aristobulus II of Judea. In 37 BCE Herod handed him over to the Romans for execution, after Antigonus's three-year reign during which he led the Jews' fierce struggle for independence against the Romans.\n\nAntigonus was the second son of Aristobulus II, and together with his father, were carried off as a prisoner to Rome by Pompey in 63 BCE. Antigonus eventually escaped and returned to Judaea in 57 BCE. Despite an unsuccessful attempt to oppose the Roman forces there, the senate released him, yet he refused to surrender his dynastic rights. After the death of his older brother Alexander, Antigonus claimed that his uncle Hyrcanus was a puppet of the Idumaean Antipater and attempted to overthrow him with the help and consent of the Romans. He visited Julius Caesar, who was in Syria in 47 BCE, and complained of the usurpation of Antipater and Hyrcanus. In 42 BCE, he attempted to seize the government of Judaea by force with the assistance of his brother-in-law, Ptolemy (son of Mennaeus), but was defeated by Herod.\n\nThe excessive taxation wrung from the people to pay for the extravagances of Antony and Cleopatra had awakened a deep hatred against Rome. Antigonus gained the adherence of both the aristocratic class in Jerusalem and the leaders of the Pharisees. The Parthians, who invaded Syria in 40 BCE, preferred to see an anti-Roman ruler on the throne of Judaea. When Antigonus promised them large sums of gold as well as five hundred female slaves, the Parthians put five hundred warriors at his disposal. After Antigonus, with Parthian help, conquered Jerusalem, Hyrcanus was sent to Babylon after having his ears mutilated, which rendered him unfit for the office of high priest. Herod fled from Jerusalem. In 40 BCE Antigonus was officially proclaimed king and high priest by the Parthians.\n\nFollowing the conquest of Jerusalem by the Parthians, Herod fled quickly from Masada to Rome, where he was nominated in 40 BCE as the new king of Judea (, allied king and friend of the Roman people) by the Senate on the recommendation of the triumvir Mark Antony. On Herod's return to Judaea from Rome in 39 BCE he opened a campaign against Antigonus and laid siege to Jerusalem. In the spring of 38 BCE, Herod wrested control of the province of Galilee and eventually all of Judea other than Jerusalem. Due to the approach of winter, Herod postponed his siege of Jerusalem, where Antigonus and the remnants of his army took refuge, until spring. Herod and a supporting Roman army were kept out of Jerusalem for 3–5 months but the Romans did eventually capture the city. However, the supporters of Antigonus fought until the Romans reached the inner courtyard of the Temple. Antigonus was taken to Antioch and executed, ending Hasmonean rule.\n\nJosephus states that Mark Antony beheaded Antigonus (Antiquities, XV 1:2 (8–9). Roman historian Cassius Dio says that he was crucified and records in his \"Roman History\": \"These people [the Jews] Antony entrusted to a certain Herod to govern; but Antigonus he bound to a cross and scourged, a punishment no other king had suffered at the hands of the Romans, and so slew him.\" In his \"Life of Antony\", Plutarch claims that Antony had Antigonus beheaded, \"the first example of that punishment being inflicted on a king.\"\n\nIn 1971, bulldozers removing earth in East Jerusalem for a construction project uncovered a tomb with an inscription that, according to some opinions, indicated that this was the tomb of King Antigonus, the last Hasmonean king. However, according to anthropologist Joe Zias, former Curator of Archaeology and Anthropology for the Israel Antiquities Authority, this theory is just little more than an urban myth, since the only beheaded skeleton found in 1971 and at the later re-examination of the previously untouched tomb, belonged to an elderly woman. In his view, no other set of remains found there could be associated with King Antigonus II and it is only due to the efforts of the owner of the building located on top of the tomb that the myth is still being promoted (as seen here:).\n\nBiblical scholar Gregory Doudna proposed in 2013 that Antigonus II Mattathias was the figure known as the Wicked Priest in the Qumran Scrolls. According to Doudna, Antigonus was the figure underlying the 'Wicked Priest' of Pesher Habakkuk, and the doomed ruler of Pesher Nahum, the documents found at Qumran.\n\n"}

{"id": "2323468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323468", "title": "Psalm 103", "text": "Psalm 103\n\nPsalm 103 is the 103rd psalm of the Book of Psalms, generally known in English by its first verse, in the King James Version, \"Bless the , O my soul\". The Book of Psalms is part of the third section of the Hebrew Bible, and a book of the Christian Old Testament. In the Greek Septuagint version of the bible, and in its Latin translation in the Vulgate, this psalm is Psalm 102 in a slightly different numbering system. In Latin, it is known as \"Benedic anima mea Domino\". The psalm is a hymn psalm.\n\nThe first verse attributes the psalm to King David. The psalm is a regular part of Jewish, Catholic, Anglican and Protestant liturgies. The psalm has been paraphrased in hymns, and has been set to music often. \n\nBaptist preacher and biblical commentator Charles Spurgeon suggests that the psalm was written in David's later life, as seen by the psalmist’s focus on the frailty of life and his \"higher sense of the preciousness of pardon, because a keener sense of sin\". Spurgeon divides the psalm into three sections:\n\nLutheran minister Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg notes that the number of verses in the psalm parallels the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and that the concluding words repeat the opening words, \"finishing\" and \"rounding off\" the psalm into a complete whole. Nonconformist minister Matthew Henry also notes this circular form, stating: \"Blessing God and giving him glory must be the alpha and the omega of all our services\".\n\nThe Midrash Tehillim offers several explanations of the first verse, among them:\nRabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Hama: A sculptor makes a statue; the sculptor dies, but his sculpture endures. It is not thus with the Holy One, blessed be He. The Holy One made man, and man dies, but the Holy One lives and endures. … Another comment: A sculptor makes a statue, but cannot make a soul or vital organs. But the Holy One made a statue, man, and within him made a soul and vital organs. Therefore, David offered praise, \"Bless the , O my soul; and all that is within me, bless His holy name\".\n\nThe opening words, \"Bless the , O my soul\", appear again at the beginning of Psalm 104, reinforcing the thematic connection between these psalms. But Patrick D. Miller also sees Psalm 103 as a logical extension of Psalm 102, pointing out that \"one may see [Psalm] 102 as opening issues and questions to which [Psalm] 103 offers the solution or answer\". For example, in Psalm 102 the psalmist blames his illness and pain on God's \"indignation and anger\" (verse 10), while Psalm 103 makes it clear that divine anger is not the final word, nor will it last forever.\n\n\nVerse 1 is the final verse of Nishmat.\n\nVerses 2, 10, and 13 are recited during Selichot.\n\nVerses 10, 13, and 14 are part of the Tachanun prayer. Verse 14 is also recited during a burial service.\n\nVerse 17 is recited during the blessings before the Shema on the second day of Rosh Hashanah.\n\nVerse 19 is part of the Yehi kevod prayer recited during Pesukei Dezimra.\n\nVerse 17 is quoted in Luke \n\nIn the Western church, this psalm was traditionally performed during the celebration of Matins of Saturday by the order of St. Benedict, probably since its founding to 530.\n\nIn the Liturgy of the Hours, Psalm 103 is sung or recited today to the Office of Sunday readings deuxième week. It is also very present among the Mass readings. It is the psalm read the Sacred Heart party. For ordinary times, we find the 7th and the 24th Sunday of the year A7 and the eighth Sunday of the year B. Lent, it is played the 3rd and 7th Sunday. Finally, it is the 7th Psalm on Easter Sunday.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church this psalm is one of the six psalms of Orthros (Matins) read every morning outside of Bright Week. It is also the first of the \"Typical Psalms\" of the Typica, which is read in place of the Divine Liturgy when the latter is not celebrated on days it is permitted to be. It is frequently sung as the first antiphon of the Divine Liturgy, but there it is often replaced by another antiphon on great feasts and on many weekdays, and is always thus replaced in Greek practice (except on Mount Athos).\n\nThesman found the psalm a declaration that God \"never betrays us, never abandons us, and never forgets ... His mercy covers our mistakes and our human tendencies\" while Coke, calls it \"an exquisite performance, very applicable to every deliverance: it may properly be said to describe the wonders of grace,\"\nThis Psalm is one continued hymn of praise, and includes a comprehensive view of the goodness of Jehovah, in all the great works of creation and redemption while Barnes called it \"exceedingly regular in its structure and composition; beautiful in its language and conceptions; adapted to all times and ages; suited to express the feelings of gratitude to God for deliverance from trouble, and for the manifestation of his mercy; suited to elevate the soul, and to fill it with cheerful views.\"\n\nThe Old Testament scholar Bernhard Duhm considers the Psalm a \"compilation of all sorts of beautiful sentences from a fairly extensive reading.\"\n\nPsalm 103 is the basis of several hymns. A paraphrase of Psalm 103 in German is \"Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren\", written by Johann Gramann in 1525, which was translated by Catherine Winkworth as \"My Soul, now Praise thy Maker!\" and published in 1863. English hymns include \"Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven\", written in the nineteenth century by Henry Francis Lyte, and \"Sing to the Lord and praise him\".\n\nIn the 16th century, Claudin de Sermisy set the psalm.\n\nThe song \"Bless the Lord\" in the musical \"Godspell\" is based on this psalm.\n\n\n"}

He received his Ph.D. in economics in 1962 from Johns Hopkins University. Engerman is known for his quantitative historical work along with Nobel Prize–winning economist Robert Fogel. His first major book, co-authored with Robert Fogel in 1974, was \".\" This significant work, winner of the Bancroft Prize in American history, challenged readers to think critically about the economics of slavery. Engerman has also published over 100 articles and has authored, co-authored or edited 16 book-length studies.\n\nEngerman served as president of the Social Science History Association as well as president of the Economic History Association. He is professor of Economics and Professor of History at the University of Rochester, where he teaches classes in economic history and the economics of sports and entertainment. From 2009 to 2012 he was a visiting professor in the Harvard University Economics Department, where he taught the economics of sports and entertainment.\n\nThe critical reception of Engerman's most widely read work, \"\" (co-authored with Robert Fogel) was unique in its public visibility. Reminiscent of Charles A. Beard's economic analysis of the Constitution in its longevity, \"Time on the Cross\" made a variety of politically-charged claims based on cliometric quantitative methods. Fogel and Engerman claimed that slavery remained an economically viable institution and slave ownership was generally a profitable investment, slave agriculture was very efficient, and the material conditions of the lives of slaves \"compared favorably with those of free industrial workers.\"\n\nCharles Crowe offered a summary of the work: \"The cliometricians announced the scientific discovery of a vastly different South led by confident and effective slaveowning entrepreneurs firmly wedded to handsome profits from a booming economy with high per capita incomes and an efficiency ratio 35 per- cent greater than that of free Northern agriculture. In the new dispensation the efficient, often highly skilled, and very productive slaves embraced the Protestant work ethic and prudish Victorian morals, avoided both promiscuity and substantial sexual exploitation by planters, lived in father-headed and stable nuclear families, kept 90 percent of the fruits of their labor, and enjoyed one of the best sets of material conditions in the world for working class people.\"\n\nEngerman co-authored an article entitled \"History Lessons: Institutions, Factor Endowments, and Paths of Development in the New World\" with Kenneth Sokoloff, which can be found in \"The Journal of Economic Perspectives.\" Sokoloff and Engerman go in-depth and argue that the economic trajectory of former New World colonies over the past 300 years was largely determined by various facets of their natural environments. Sokoloff and Engerman focus mainly on the effects of the colonies' soil qualities. Sokoloff and Engerman claim that in areas such as Cuba which possessed land suitable for sugar and coffee, the soil quality led to economies of scale and plantation agriculture and slave labor. This in turn led to a guarded franchise, high tax rates, and limits on education. In areas such as the United States which possessed land suitable for wheat, the soil quality led to small scale farming and relatively equal distributions of wealth. This in turn led to an open franchise and broad public education. Sokoloff and Engerman conclude that areas such as the United States, which emphasized equality and access to public education, were able to progress faster economically than areas such as Cuba which did not allow such opportunities to its residents.\n\n\n"}

The new version was part of a remix trade between both bands, where Garbage remixed Fun Lovin' Criminals single \"Korean Bodega\" in reciprocation.\n\nIn 2007, \"You Look So Fine\" was remastered and included on Garbage's greatest hits album \"Absolute Garbage\".\n\n\"You Look So Fine\" was written, recorded and mixed at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin towards the end of their year-long sessions for \"Version 2.0\". The track began as a basic vocal/acoustic guitar/piano composition. Elements from a scrapped track titled \"King of Crime\" were repurposed for \"You Look So Fine\". Butch Vig described the song as his favourite track from \"Version 2.0\" citing its \"Carpenters covers Sonic Youth quality\"\n\nWhen Garbage had printed what they presumed was the final mix of the song, Manson had the idea to add an orchestral outro section to the song after returning to the studio from a screening of the movie \"Titanic\". \"I was kind of rattled because I thought the movie was shit... I came back to the studio [as the boys were working on \"You Look So Fine\"] and I was all grumpy about it.\" Manson felt that even thought it was very late at night, and the rest of the band were tired, that they instinctively knew that her suggestion was a good idea. \"We knew \"You Look So Fine\" was going to be the last track, with a slightly cinematic feel\", Erikson explained, \"but the ending almost sets you up for you up for what's going to happen next...\"\n\n\"You Look So Fine\" was first performed live on May 15, 1998 in Combined Locks, Wisconsin on the first date of the \"Version 2.0\" tour. In advance of the song's single release in late 1998, Garbage performed the song live for MTV Europe and MusiquePlus.\n\nAt the end of 1998, Garbage arranged for a remix trade between themselves and New York City hip-hop group Fun Lovin' Criminals. Both bands had toured Germany together a few years prior. Garbage reworked \"Korean Bodega\" from their \"100% Colombian\" album, recording new instrumentation beneath the group's vocal. On the chorus, Manson added her own backing vocal. At the time, Garbage were on a three-month concert tour of North America; the remix was recorded in available locker and dressing rooms the band had access to, directly onto Pro Tools. Fun Lovin Criminals reworked \"You Look So Fine\" into a lounge standard. Garbage booked studio time at Rondor Studios in Los Angeles to record a new vocal for the new version. While there, the band also wrote and recorded two brand new tracks for B-side use, \"Get Busy with the Fizzy\" and \"Soldier Through This\" with their touring bass player Daniel Shulman.\n\nChrysalis Records issued \"Korean Bodega\" as a single across Europe on April 26, 1999. The Garbage version (titled \"Aero Mexicana remix\") featured on the A-side to one CD single and on the cassette formats. A week later, \"Korean Bodega\" debuted as the band's second biggest hit at #15 on the UK Singles Chart. All of the press advertising for the release of \"Korean Bodega\" heavily mentioned Garbage's remix and the fact that Shirley Manson had contributed vocals to the new version. Synching both releases up, a database mail-out to Fun Lovin' Criminals fans was sent to promote \"You Look So Fine\", while a mail out for \"Korean Bodega\" was sent to Garbage fans. \"Korean Bodega\" spent three weeks on the UK charts.\n\nBoth the original and Fun Lovin' Criminals versions of \"You Look So Fine\" were serviced to radio in the United Kingdom and Ireland at the beginning of May 1999. The final single from the album would also serve to end the album promotion in the United Kingdom after launching the release of \"Version 2.0 Special Live Edition\", a limited edition repackage with a bonus disc of four tracks recorded live at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark, and would support the announcement of Garbage's last UK date on the Version 2.0 tour. \"You Look So Fine\" was A-listed at XFM, GLR and Capital, B-listed at Radio One, C-listed at Virgin and playlisted by a further 56 regional radio stations becoming the #6 Most Added song at radio by the middle of the month. Pre-release club mixes of \"You Look So Fine\" produced by Eric Kupper peaked at #20 on the Club Charts. Setting up television and radio promotion for the single, Garbage performed \"You Look So Fine\" along with \"I Think I'm Paranoid\" and \"Only Happy When it Rains\" on \"Later With Jools Holland\", recorded a four-track session for Radio One and filmed interviews for \"Videotech\" and \"\"; Shirley also took part on the panel of the Jo Whiley Show.\n\nMushroom Records issued \"You Look So Fine\" to record stores on May 24 on a two CD single set and a cassette single. The first CD and the cassette both featured \"Get Busy with the Fizzy\" while the CD also included the club mix by Eric Kupper. The second CD single was backed with \"Soldier Through This\" and the Fun Lovin' Criminals rework. After a week on sale, \"You Look So Fine\" debuted at #19 on the UK singles chart. This was Garbage's eighth straight Top 20 single. The same week, the band's debut album \"Garbage\" shot back into the top 50 of the UK Album Chart peaking at #44 (its highest position since the previous August). At the start of June, Garbage followed up the chart position of \"You Look So Fine\" by performing the song on both \"Top of The Pops\" and \"TFI Friday\". On June 7, the \"Version 2.0\" repackage was issued to record stores on the same date that \"You Look So Fine\" was released as the final collectable 3\" CD Blisterpack from the album, collecting together all of the singles bonus tracks. Seven days later, \"Version 2.0\" recharted at #38 and subsequently climbed to #27 the following week. \"You Look So Fine\" ultimately spent four weeks on the UK Singles Chart, leaving the top seventy-five at the end of June.\n\nOn May 25, the day after the UK release, \"You Look So Fine\", was released via BMG across Europe as both a CD maxi and a card sleeved single CD. In France, the single had been serviced to Radio Campus Paris and music video playlisted by TV channels MCM and M6 from May 20. Ouï FM supported the release of the single by broadcasting live recordings of the band performing at Roskilde Festival. Garbage perform \"You Look So Fine\" and \"When I Grow Up\" on \"Si Musica\" on May 29; and performed \"You Look So Fine\" for \"Gala Ragazza\" in Madrid, on June 3 as \"Version 2.0\" is certified platinum in Spain. To mark the certification, RCA issue both \"You Look So Fine\" and \"Temptation Waits\" to Spanish radio stations. \"You Look So Fine\" peaks at #15 on the Spanish singles chart, while also reaching #26 on the airplay chart. \"Temptation Waits\" peaks at #39.\n\nOn December 6, 1999, Festival Mushroom Records issued \"You Look So Fine\" in Australia. \"Version 2.0\" had re-entered the ARIA Album Chart top ten a month earlier, a year and a half after its original release, thanks to the success of earlier single \"When I Grow Up\" and the Australian release of the album's bonus disc repackage. The single was issued as a maxi-CD backed with \"Get Busy with the Fizzy\" and both mixes of the title track. \"You Look So Fine\" just failed to make the Australian ARIA Top 100 Singles chart, peaking at #101.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The music video for \"You Look So Fine\" was directed by Stéphane Sednaoui for Propaganda Films. It was filmed on February 26, 1999 on a Los Angeles soundstage. ASP World Champion surfer champion Kelly Slater was cast as the man washed up on the shore that Manson \"rescues\", and much press was made from his cameo role in the video. While the male members of Garbage were filmed for the video, during offline editing, most of their shots were left unused after the director and the band felt their shots looked \"naff\". Originally, actor Brad Pitt was cast as the role of the rescued man, but dropped out the night before filming.\n\nWith a concept for the video to visually look like a \"mixture of a piece by Ingmar Bergman and a Samurai warrior movie\", the director created a rock pool and white sand dune landscape dominated by a large pair of eyes in the background sky. Throughout the video, an effect similar to bioluminescent insects flying at night is also employed. The establishing shot is of the landscape, which fades to reveal Manson tending to an unconscious man who has washed up on the shore. While she tends to him, the male members of Garbage are seen lurking in silhouette in the background, while she sees her own reflection acting independently of her at the man's other side. After a while, the man regains consciousness as the sky changes to pink and the image onscreen changes to soft focus, before fading out as Manson sings the final lyrics.\n\nThe \"You Look So Fine\" video was first commercially released on \"All About Garbage\", a covermounted CD-ROM issued by Italian magazine \"Tribe\" in 1999. A remastered version of the music video was included on Garbage's 2007 greatest hits DVD \"Absolute Garbage\" and uploaded to the band's VEVO channel in 2015\n\nIn 2002, British electronica group West London Deep sampled Manson's vocal from \"You Look So Fine\" on their white label \"You're Taking Me Over\". Manson later refused clearance for the sample and the song's commercial release was canceled and withdrawn after remixes by Inner City, Problem Kids and Desyn Masiello & Leon Roberts had been circulated promotionally. West London Deep reworked the track without Manson's vocal and retitled it \"Gonna Make You My Lover\".\n\nIn 2007, Fun Lovin' Criminals' remix was remastered and included on the \"Absolute Garbage\" bonus disc \"Garbage Mixes\".\n\n"}

It was first published in serial form in \"Pilote\" magazine, issues 340–361, in 1966. It depicts a meeting between Asterix's Gaulish village and a shipload of Normans (Vikings).\n\nThe story begins with Vitalstatistix receiving a missive from his brother Doublehelix in Lutetia (Paris), to ask for the education of Doublehelix's teenage son, Justforkix. Justforkix then arrives in a sports car-like chariot. The village holds a dance in honour of his arrival; but he is unimpressed by the traditional way of dancing, snatches Cacofonix's lyre, and sings and plays in the manner of Elvix Preslix (the Rolling Menhirs in the English version). Some of the younger villagers dance to this new form; but Cacofonix tries to show off his own skills, and is struck down by Fulliautomatix. Justforkix thereupon suggests that Cacofonix's talents would be better appreciated in Lutetia.\n\nMeanwhile, a Norman crew arrive in Gaul to discover \"the meaning of fear\", on grounds that they are fearless to the point of not understanding the concept, but have heard of people \"flying in fear\", and believe that being afraid will grant them the ability to fly. Most of the Gauls welcome the chance of a fight; but Justforkix is horrified and decides to return home. Viewing Justforkix as an expert in fear, the Normans kidnap him to teach them; but this fails, and he remains their prisoner until Asterix and Obelix come to the rescue. A small Roman patrol is also involved in the resulting fight. At length, Norman chief Timandahaf orders an end to the battle and explains his mission to the Gauls. To teach the Normans fear, Asterix sends Obelix to fetch Cacofonix, while himself remaining as a hostage. When Obelix reaches the village, he finds Cacofonix gone to perform in Lutetia, and pursues him through a series of tell-tale clues.\n\nMeanwhile, Timandahaf becomes impatient and tries to force Justforkix to teach the secret of flight by tossing him off a cliff. Just before this can be carried out, Asterix challenges the Norman warriors; and seeing him surrounded, Justforkix gains the courage to fight as well — albeit to no visible effect. Obelix and Cacofonix stop the fight, and Cacofonix's discordant songs are exhibited to the Normans, which provokes their first real fear, and an immediate retreat to their homeland. When Asterix questions the Normans' interest in fear, Getafix replies that courage is achieved only by having first been afraid, and superseding the fear to the desired effect. Thereafter Justforkix is claimed to have gained courage himself, and the story ends with the customary banquet, but with Cacofonix as guest of honour and Fulliautomatix tied up, with his ears filled with parsley.\n\nIn France, Normans are the descendants of Norsemen (Vikings) who invaded northern France in the late 9th century and gave their name to Normandy; wherefore the name of 'Norman' is given the Vikings in this volume. Indeed, the Norman chief tells the Gauls that they do not want to invade their country, but their descendants will do so, centuries later (they even briefly reference 1066). In the book, the Normans' heavy use of cream in recipes is a reference to stereotypes of the cuisine in Normandy.\n\nIn the original French version, Justforkix is called \"Goudurix\" (\"a taste for risks\"), a name he lives up to only towards the end.\n\nIn Finnish, the story is called \"Asterix ja normannien maihinnousu\" (\"Asterix and the Landing of the Normans\"). This is a reference to the \"Normandian maihinnousu\", the standard Finnish history-book term for the Normandy Landings of 1944.\n\nIn this story, we see Dogmatix's distress over the uprooting of trees for the first time.\n\nThis is the first album in the series since \"Asterix the Gaul\" where Cacofonix is not tied up for the story-ending banquet.\n\nFulliautomatix the blacksmith had previously appeared in both \"Asterix the Gaul\" and \"Asterix and the Banquet\", but he differed somewhat from the appearance he now took in \"Asterix and the Normans\", and he would remain essentially unchanged for the rest of the series.\n\nWhereas Justforkix learns courage, the Roman soldier Oleaginus learns to fear the Gauls and Normans and also the means of evading confrontation, such as wasting time on making three copies of the same report (i.e. red tape).\nWhen Justforkix explains his Chariot is from Mediolanum (now Milan, Italy) it is a reference to modern sports cars made there.\n\nJustforkix was the star of a series of Asterix gamebooks, popular in the 1980s.\n\nThe basic storyline of this graphic novel was adapted into the animated full-length feature \"Asterix and the Vikings\".\n\nRolling Menhirs is a reference to the famous rock group the Rolling Stones. In the original French it is 'Les Monkiix,' referring to The Monkees.\n\nThe book is translated into Afrikaans, Bengali, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Greek, Indonesian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Serbian, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Icelandic and Turkish.\n\n\nOn Goodreads, it has a score of 4.12 out of 5.\n\n"}

He gained fame at the Battle of Gettysburg for taking the initiative to piece together a line of guns that greatly contributed to the Union victory.\n\nMcGilvery was born in Prospect, Maine. Born with a love for the sea, he was a sailor and then a ship master. He was in Brazil at Rio de Janeiro when the Civil War erupted. He soon returned home and raised the 6th Maine Battery, which first saw action at the battles of Cedar Mountain and Sulfur Springs in Western Virginia. At the Battle of Antietam, McGilvery's battery supported the attack of the XII Corps. On February 5, 1863, he was promoted to major and given command of the First Volunteer Brigade in the Artillery Reserve in the Union Army of the Potomac, which he commanded during the Chancellorsville Campaign.\n\nDuring the Gettysburg Campaign, on June 23, 1863, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. On July 2, the second day of the battle of Gettysburg, McGilvery discovered a wide and undefended gap in the Union line along the southern end of Cemetery Ridge, north of Little Round Top. McGilvery patched together a line of artillery from various commands to fill the gap. Initially without infantry support, McGilvery's \"Plum Run line\" of fieldpieces was instrumental in halting the final Confederate advance toward the Union center. On July 3, the lengthy artillery line assisted in the repulse of Pickett's Charge, and in particular stopped the supporting attack of Confederate brigades under Cadmus Wilcox and David Lang.\n\nPromoted to colonel in September 1863, he continued to command his Artillery Reserve brigade until May 1864. He replaced Robert O. Tyler in command of the army’s reserve artillery and its ammunition train. He served with distinction in this role during the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg. On August 9, 1864, he was promoted to Chief of Artillery for the X Corps, commanding fifteen batteries. Only a week later, at the Battle of Deep Bottom, he was slightly wounded in a finger. The wound did not heal properly, and surgeons performed an amputation, during which McGilvery died from an overdose of chloroform being used as an anesthesia. His body was returned to his native Maine and buried in the Village Cemetery in Searsport.\n\nFort McGilvery, part of the Union earthworks at Petersburg constructed later during the siege, was named in his memory.

It initially appeared in \"The New Yorker\", as did other short stories that would later be reprinted in the 1960 anthology, \"Kiss Kiss\".\n\nBilly Weaver is a seventeen-year-old youth who has travelled by train from London to Bath to start a new job. Looking for lodgings, he comes across a boarding-house and feels strangely compelled by its sign saying \"Bed and Breakfast\". Through the window he notices a parrot in a cage and a sleeping dachshund on the floor. When he rings the doorbell, it is instantly answered by a middle-aged landlady. Billy discovers that her boarding-house is extremely cheap, and finds the woman seems somewhat eccentric and absent-minded, but very kind. When Billy signs her guest-book, he finds only two names, both dated more than two years ago: Christopher Mulholland and Gregory W. Temple – names which seem curiously familiar to Billy. The landlady invites Billy for some tea, and Billy tries to remember where he has previously heard the names in the guest-book. He seems to recall that Mulholland was an Eton schoolboy whose disappearance was reported in the newspapers. The landlady assures Billy that her Mulholland was a Cambridge undergraduate, and that Mulholland and Temple are still staying upstairs in her boarding-house. She says that Billy is a handsome young man, as were the two other guests. Billy is surprised to find that the parrot and dachshund he had seen through the window are both stuffed. The landlady says that she stuffs all her pets when they die. Billy finds that his tea tastes faintly of bitter almonds. He asks the landlady whether she has had any other guests since the two young men. The landlady replies, \"No, my dear. Only you.\" (The implication is that the landlady has poisoned Billy's tea with cyanide and intends to stuff his corpse, as she has already done to Mulholland and Temple.)\n\nIn the introduction to \"Roald Dahl's Book of Ghost Stories\", a collection of fourteen stories by other writers that he chose as the genre's best, Dahl states that he has always wanted to write a ghost story but never quite been able to. The closest he came was with \"The Landlady\", but after reading it through he decided that he had not \"brought it off\", so changed the ending to make the twist non-supernatural.\n\n\"The Landlady\" won \"Best Short Story Mystery\" at the 1960 Edgar Awards. This was the second time Dahl was honoured, the first having been for his collection of short stories, \"Someone Like You\" (Best Short Story, 1954).\n\nIn 1979 Siobhán McKenna appeared in the title role of \"The Landlady\" in an episode of the British TV series \"Tales of The Unexpected\" where she played a seemingly charming, maternal but eccentric landlady who murders her male tenants and adds them to her collection of stuffed creatures.\n"}

The 6 Bee Gee songs are \"How Deep Is Your Love\", \"Stayin' Alive\", \"Night Fever\", \"Too Much Heaven\", \"Tragedy\" and \"Love You Inside Out\". The songs spanned the years of 1977, 1978 and 1979. \n\nRobin Gibb reportedly said on the Bee Gees' interview for \"Billboard\" in 2001 that this track was one of his favourite songs of the Bee Gees.\n\nBarry Gibb, Robin Gibb and Maurice Gibb wrote this track with \"Tragedy\" in an afternoon off from the making the \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" movie; that same evening, the Gibbs wrote \"Shadow Dancing\" for Andy Gibb (but that song was later credited to all four Gibbs)\n\nThe recording process was the longest of all the tracks on \"Spirits Having Flown\" as there are nine layers of three-part harmony, creating 27 voices, though the high falsetto voices are the most pronounced in the final mix:\n\nImbued with their falsetto style, it is also notable for being one of two songs on the album featuring the Chicago horn section (James Pankow, Walt Parazaider and Lee Loughnane); the other track that features the Chicago members is \"Search, Find\", in return for the brothers' appearance on the Chicago song \"Little Miss Lovin'\". On its demo version, Barry begins with count-in. This track does have some backing vocals. The demo lacks the full orchestral feel of the final song.\n\n\"Too Much Heaven\" was released nine months after \"Night Fever\". At the time, this had been the longest gap in The Bee Gees' distribution of singles since 1975.\n\nThe single \"Too Much Heaven\" was released in the late autumn of 1978 (it had originally been intended for use in the John Travolta movie \"Moment By Moment\", but was pulled before the film's release reportedly because Barry Gibb thought the movie was awful when he was shown a rough cut), and started a slow ascent up the music charts. In the first week of 1979, preceding the Music for UNICEF Concert, the single first topped the charts in both the United States and Canada. In the United Kingdom, the single peaked at number three late in 1978. A slow ballad that was unlike the previous two singles off the \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack, Barry Gibb noted that the group wanted to \"move in an R&B direction, still maintaining our lyric power, and our melody power as well.\" In the summer of 1978, the Gibb brothers announced their latest project at a news conference at the United Nations in New York City. All of the publishing royalties on their next single would go into UNICEF, to celebrate the International Year of the Child, which was designated to be 1979. The song earned over $7 million in publishing royalties. Then-United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim heralded the move as \"an outstanding and generous initiative.\"\n\nThe Bee Gees were later invited to the White House, where President Jimmy Carter thanked the group for their donation. At the ceremony, the brothers presented Carter with one of their black satin tour jackets. Carter remarked that he was \"not a disco fan\" but knew enough about their music because his daughter Amy was a big fan. In later years, the brothers performed the song with only Barry's guitar and keyboards, with all three singing in their normal range. This version was part of a medley the brothers did as part of their 1989 \"One For All\" tour, and is also included on the \"Tales from the Brothers Gibb\" box set alongside the original version.\n\n\"Too Much Heaven\" also reached No. 2 in \"Cash Box\" charts in six weeks between 30 December 1978 and 3 February 1979 behind Chic's \"Le Freak\".\n\n!scope=\"row\"| Total certified sales:\n\nIn 1997, Nana covered the hit for his album \"Father\". Compared to the original, this version is increasingly listening to rap passages while retaining much of the original's lyrics. Nana is responsible for the rap, while Van der Toorn sings the lyrics and chorus of the original. In German-speaking countries, this cover version was a top ten success. In Germany, this version was also awarded with Gold.\n\nThe music video plays both in a sky setting and in a detached house. In a family home, the coexistence of a large family is the focus.

The film features Felissa Rose reprising her role as Angela Baker from the first film, following her absence in the previous sequels. It was followed by its chronological prequel \"\" (originally intended for release in 1992) in 2012.\n\nIn 2003, Alan (Michael Gibney) is a boy who is at a summer camp at Camp Manabe. The movie shows that Alan is a bully, who in turn is bullied by other kids. Among his abusers are his stepbrother Michael (Michael Werner) and his friends Vinny (Christian Hess) and T.C. (Christopher Shand), and the girls at the camp, mainly a girl named Bella (Shahidah McIntosh). Several boys are lighting farts one night. Alan tries, and after failing, he threatens the other boys, but is soon stopped by camp counselor, Randy (Brye Cooper). In the dining hall, Alan gets into a violent confrontation with Randy after he complains about the food. Ronnie (Paul DeAngelo), a counselor (from the original) who is nice to everyone including Alan, allows Alan to get something else to eat, but Alan gets in trouble with cook Mickey (Lenny Venito). Alan throws a butcher knife at Mickey and the camp owner, Frank (Vincent Pastore), argues with Alan. Alan runs away, with Michael chasing him. In the kitchen, Mickey is killed after being held above and dumped into the deep fryer. His body is dumped in the trash compactor.\n\nDuring the social, Alan is fooled by campers Terry (Adam Wylie), nicknamed \"Weed\", Spaz, and Stan (Chas Brewer) into smoking dried cow manure, which makes him cough and fall on Stan's crotch, earning him the nickname \"Blowjob.\" After the social, Weed is tied to his chair and gasoline is squirted down his throat. The killer tapes his mouth shut with a “Drugs are for dummies” sticker and pokes a hole through it with a lit cigarette, causing his insides to explode. Ronnie suspects the murders that happened twenty years ago are happening again, but Frank states the murders were accidental. A week later, Alan manages to convince two girls, Karen (Erin Broderick) and Marie (Samantha Hahn), to go to his \"secret hideout\". Michael makes Alan look like he skinned frogs, and Karen and Marie run away. Alan catches up to Karen to try and explain what happened, but T.C. gives Alan a wedgie and he falls in the water. Later that night Michael, T.C. and Marie force Karen to lure Alan to the back of the stage, where they take his clothes off, tie him up, blindfold him and embarrass him at the social.\n\nRonnie suspects that counselor Petey (Kate Simses) is the killer for always being nearby when Alan is in trouble. After returning to his cabin, Frank is knocked unconscious with a hammer and wakes up with his head inserted in a birdcage. The killer opens the birdcage and places two rats inside the cage. The rats eat through his head and down into his intestines. Randy and his girlfriend Linda (Jackie Tohn) go to the pump house to have sex. Whilst Randy urinates, the killer ties him to a tree, using fishing line to wrap around his penis. Upon returning, Linda panics after hearing Randy placate the killer and drives off in the jeep, but the fishing line is tied to the jeep and tears off Randy's penis. Linda crashes after driving through a wrapped barbed wire line, which wraps around her face.\n\nAfter Spaz visits T.C., a wooden spear comes through a hole in the floor while T.C. is looking into it and gouges his eye out, whereas he forces it through his head by walking into a wall. Ronnie and another camper, Jenny (Jaime Radow), find Frank dead and begin rounding up everyone. Bella goes to her cabin, where she finds that the bunk above her has been replaced with a board with spikes. The killer jumps down from the rafters and lands on the top bunk, causing the spikes to impale and kill Bella. T.C. and Bella are found dead and Ricky Thomas (Jonathan Tiersten), Angela's cousin, is called by Sheriff Jerry. Karen runs through the camp. She finds Randy and Linda dying before bumping into the killer and fainting.\n\nKaren wakes up with a rope hanging from a basketball hoop tied around her neck. The killer flips a switch to raise the net, causing Karen to be lifted off the ground. Michael arrives, prompting the killer to run off, and lowers the net. After Karen tells him she thinks Alan is the killer, Michael grabs a croquet mallet and runs to Alan's secret hideout, where he finds Alan, and starts beating Alan with the mallet. However, the real killer appears behind Michael as the screen fades to black.\n\nRonnie, Ricky and Jenny find a badly wounded Alan. Sheriff Jerry walks up, explaining through his mechanical voice box that the victims never learned, felt the need to be so mean all the time, thought they could do anything to their victims and get away with it, and eventually got what they deserved. The killer is revealed to be Sheriff Jerry, who in turn reveals himself to be Angela Baker, the murderer from the first movie, which causes Ronnie to say \"I knew it was you!\" Jenny finds something on the ground and runs away screaming. Ronnie and Ricky investigate and find Michael skinned alive on the ground. The film ends with Angela laughing maniacally before suddenly stopping and staring evilly into the camera.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, a flashback set three weeks prior to film shows how Angela escaped from the psychiatric clinic from the fourth film. She causes a brake fluid leak in a car and flags down Sheriff Pete (Carlo Vogel), the real sheriff. She murders him by dropping the car on his head and steals his clothes to become the new sheriff.\n\n\"Return to Sleepaway Camp\" concluded filming in 2003 and was scheduled to be released theatrically between 2004 and 2006, but due to unsatisfactory CGI effects and a lack of distribution deals, it did not see release until November 2008. An executive producer of the film, Thomas E. van Dell, claimed that most of the corrected CGI had been completed by December 2006, but the director, Robert Hiltzik, felt that it needed more work to meet his expectations. By 2007, compositors and CGI personnel had been hired by van Dell to correct the effects. Additionally, a small special F/X group was hired to reshoot work unapproved by Hiltzik; such included the skinned body of the character Michael, additions to the death of camper T.C., and unfinished/pick-up shots. All work was finished by 2008, and the producers secured distribution through Magnolia Pictures. The film was released direct-to-video in the United States in November 2008, and was released internationally in 2009.\n\nA 2/5 was bestowed by David Harley of Bloody Disgusting, who regarded \"Return to Sleepaway Camp\" as a draggy, unimaginative, and unfunny film with an ending \"that manages to disappoint with its banality\". Dread Central's Steve Barton gave \"Return to Sleepaway Camp\" a 1½ out 5, and summarized his review with, \"Gone is the really black humor of the first film. Gone is the insane twist. Gone are the inventive kills. And gone is nearly all of the charm that has kept this franchise alive. I would have rated this even lower if not for the nostalgia factor. Man, what a letdown\". In his review for DVD Verdict, Gordon Sullivan stated, \"\"Return to Sleepaway Camp\" makes \"\" look like Shakespeare. A poor script, a total lack of compelling campers, and a too-brief glimpse of Angela all spell trouble for this nostalgic trip back to camp-land. I know that diehard fans of the original film will likely get suckered into watching this, but everyone else should stay far, far away\". A 1/4 was awarded by Arrow in the Head's Pat Torfe, who concluded, \"A 'return' this is not. Hiltzik should've taken \"\"s demise as a warning and let this series go quietly. \"Return\" is nothing what the original trilogy was in terms of kills or fun. It limps by on sloppy editing, unlikeable characters, unsatisfying kills and hopes that people get pulled in by the return of past characters\".\n\n"}

It was released on September 21, 1993 by Tommy Boy and was the group's last record to be produced with Prince Paul.\n\n\"Buhlo͞one\" is a phonetic spelling of the English noun \"balloon\". This theme is laid out in the intro track, which starts with the sound of a balloon being inflated; then the hookline \"it might blow up, but it won't go pop\" is repeated over and over, until the sound of a balloon popping replaces the final word \"pop\". This lends itself to the interpretation that the group hope to expand their popularity with their third album without selling out.\n\nDe La Soul continued the early-mid 1990s experimentations with jazz by featuring jazz veterans Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley, and Pee Wee Ellis, on \"Patti Dooke\" and \"I Am I Be\". The song \"Patti Dooke\" deals with what the group sees as the mainstream's efforts to control the direction of black music.

The album was preceded by the single and video \"Breakadawn\", which features samples from Michael Jackson's \"I Can't Help It\" and Smokey Robinson's \"Quiet Storm.\"\n\nAt the end of 1993, \"Buhlo͞one Mindstate\" was voted the eighth best album of the year in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by \"The Village Voice\". Robert Christgau, the poll's creator and supervisor, ranked it fifth best on his own year-end list. In a contemporary review, \"Rolling Stone\" critic Paul Evans said the record was more focused than De La Soul's previous albums and also more ambitious sonically: \"Musically, \"Buhloone Mind State\" raises the stakes; it gets to something rap seldom achieves — a truly gorgeous groove.\" In 2005, comedian Chris Rock named it the 10th greatest hip hop record of all time in a list published by \"Rolling Stone\".\n"}

Owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., WTAM is a clear-channel station with extended nighttime range. WTAM serves as the Cleveland affiliate for ABC News Radio, \"The Glenn Beck Program\", \"The Rush Limbaugh Show\", and \"Coast to Coast AM\"; the AM flagship station for the Cleveland Cavaliers and Cleveland Indians radio networks; and the home of radio personality Mike Trivisonno. The WTAM studios are located in the Cleveland suburb of Independence, while the station transmitter resides in nearby Brecksville. Besides its main analog transmission, WTAM simulcasts over low-power analog Cleveland translator W295DE (106.9 FM), and streams online via iHeartRadio.\n\nThe station first carried the WTAM call letters from 1923 to 1956; assigned sequentially by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the letters were later treated as a backronym for \"Where The Artisans Meet.\" The station re-adopted the same call letters in 1996 to reinforce the station's position on the AM band; station management considered the historical tie \"a nice bonus, but... more incidental than anything else.\"\n\nWTAM began broadcast operations on September 26, 1923. It was one of several stations that started between 1922 and 1923 with a call sign assigned sequentially by the Commerce Department with \"W\" as the first letter and \"A\" as the third. It was originally owned by S.E. Lawrence and Theodore Willard, in the name of the Willard Storage Battery Company. Initially the station only offered three hours of nightly programming, but soon expanded its on-air lineup. Studios were located in the Willard factory on Taft Avenue at East 131st Street. By June 30, 1924, WTAM was broadcasting with 1,000 watts and sharing the 770 kHz frequency with WJAX.\n\nWJAX had signed on earlier in 1922, owned by the Union Trust Co. In 1924 it was known as the \"Wave from Lake Erie.\" The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company purchased WJAX in 1925 and changed to the callsign to WEAR. Finally, Willard Battery purchased WEAR to have control of shared frequency allocation.\n\nWTAM was the first radio station to broadcast coverage of a political convention when it covered the 1924 Republican National Convention at Cleveland's Public Auditorium from June 10–12, 1924. The station's power increased to 2,500 watts in 1925 and to 3,500 watts in 1926, as the studios moved to the Union Trust Building (now The 925 Building). By June 30, 1927, WTAM and WEAR broadcast on 750 kHz with WTAM broadcasting with 3,500 watts. The January 31, 1928 Radio Service Bulletin of the Commerce Department listed WTAM broadcasting with 3,500 watts at night and 5,000 watts during the day.\n\nAfter Willard Battery threatened to close the station, WTAM and WEAR were purchased by the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (now part of FirstEnergy) and the Van Sweringen brothers on May 31, 1928. In a statement announcing the purchase, the new owners declared, \"Recognizing the fact that this radio station is a civic asset to the Greater Cleveland district and that the cessation of its operation would be a real loss, the Van Sweringen interests and the Illuminating Co. entered into arrangements to continue it. Every effort will be made to maintain the station on a plane which will make it of maximum value to the community.\"\n\nWhen the new Federal Radio Commission instituted General Order 40 after the passage of the Radio Act of 1927, WTAM along with sister station WEAR (at that point absorbed into WTAM entirely) claimed the clear channel frequency allocated to Cleveland, and on November 11, 1928 it began broadcasting at 1070 kHz with WTAM broadcasting at 50,000 watts. In 1929 the station built two broadcast towers in Brecksville, Ohio, each 200 feet high.\n\nWith its national prominence as a clear channel giant established, WTAM became a valuable radio property. NBC purchased WTAM on October 16, 1930, and the studios were moved to the Auditorium Building. The station became a major link in the NBC Red Network, contributing some programming to the network. Around 1930, Gene Carroll and Glenn Rowell brought their vaudeville humor to WTAM with the \"Gene and Glenn\" show. The duo became famous for their characters \"Jake & Lena\". WTAM originated the program for nationwide broadcast on the NBC Red Network, and it aired six days a week for five years. WTAM also originated the venerable \"Lum and Abner\" show on the NBC Red Network five days a week during one year of its run from May 22, 1933 to March 30, 1934, sponsored by the Ford Dealers of America.\n\nNBC began to make substantial investments to station facilities in the 1930s. WTAM moved their studio operations to 815 Superior Avenue on February 7, 1937; renamed the NBC Building, it is known today as the Superior Building. That same year, a new tower was built in Brecksville which was 480 feet tall. On March 29, 1941, with the implementation of NARBA, WTAM moved its broadcast frequency from 1070 to 1100 kHz, maintaining its clear-channel status.\n\nDuring the 1940s, the station continued to contribute some programming to the NBC radio network. On March 19, 1946 Bob Hope brought his Tuesday night 10 pm Pepsodent radio show to Cleveland along with Jerry Colonna, Frances Langford and the Skinnay Ennis Orchestra for a broadcast on the NBC radio network. Guests included Ohio Governor Frank Lausche. Recordings of this program are still available from collectors of old radio programs.\n\nWTAM also broadcast the 1948 World Series games of the Cleveland Indians against the Boston Braves, with announcers Jim Britt and Mel Allen. In 1951, WTAM originated an NBC Radio Network broadcast of the Cleveland Orchestra.\n\nNBC also expanded its broadcasting interests in Cleveland beyond AM radio: on October 31, 1948, NBC launched a sister television outlet, WNBK, on channel 4; a few weeks later, on December 6, 1948, WTAM-FM (105.7 FM) began broadcasting, simulcasting WTAM's programming. All three stations shared the same transmitter tower in Brecksville until WNBK moved to a new transmitter tower erected in Parma concurrent with a channel switch to channel 3 on April 25, 1954; as KYW and KYW-FM, both radio stations would move to the same Parma tower on February 1957.\n\nWTAM also aired Cleveland Browns games during the 1952, 1953, and 1955 seasons; Jim Graner provided color commentary during the 1955 season.\n\nIn late 1955, NBC persuaded Westinghouse to trade its Philadelphia stations, KYW (1060 AM) and WPTZ-TV, in return for NBC's Cleveland properties and $3 million in cash compensation. NBC had long wanted to own a station in Philadelphia, the nation's third-largest market at the time. The swap went into effect on January 22, 1956. Westinghouse wanted to keep the historic KYW callsign, which had been Chicago's oldest radio facility before being transferred to Philadelphia on December 3, 1934. Therefore, on February 13, 1956, the Cleveland stations became KYW, KYW-FM and KYW-TV; and the Philadelphia stations became WRCV and WRCV-TV. The WTAM callsign was later picked up by WGLS in Atlanta, Georgia, and after that by WGCM-FM in Gulfport, Mississippi.\n\nIn the early 1960s, under program director Ken Draper, KYW, known on-air as KY11, became a full service - Top 40 powerhouse with disc jockeys Jim Runyon (the \"weeeellll\" voice of the Chickenman series), Jim Stagg, Jay Lawrence, Jerry G (Jerry Ghan), and the morning duo of Harry Martin and Specs Howard. Its main Top 40 rival in the Cleveland market was \"Color Channel 14\" WHK, at 1420 AM.\n\nAlmost immediately after the trade was finalized, Westinghouse complained to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Justice Department about NBC's coercion. It was discovered that Westinghouse only agreed to the trade when NBC made implications that it would pull its television programming from WPTZ and Westinghouse's other NBC affiliate, WBZ-TV in Boston. In 1964, after a protracted legal battle, the FCC ordered the swap of stations reversed without NBC realizing any profit on the deal. NBC regained control of the Cleveland stations on June 19, 1965 and changed their call letters to WKYC, WKYC-FM and WKYC-TV, which kept the popular \"KY\" slogan and identity Westinghouse brought into Cleveland.\n\nTo this day, the KYW stations insist that they \"moved\" to Cleveland in 1956 and \"returned\" to Philadelphia in 1965, but the two stations' facilities and broadcast licenses remained the same.\n\nWKYC continued as a Top 40 outlet—the only such-formatted station under NBC ownership—with personalities Harry Martin, Specs Howard, Jay Lawrence and Jerry G holding over from KYW/Westinghouse. When program director Ken Draper left for WCFL/Chicago in early 1965, prior to the ownership change, both Jim Stagg and Jim Runyon wasted no time following him. Bill Winters came in about this time. Jim LaBarbara was wooed away from a 3-day stint at WIXY to do evening prime time. Chuck Dann and KLIF (1190 AM)/Dallas morning duo \"Charlie and Harrigan\" (Jack Woods and Paul Menard) signed on. Jim Gallant was doing overnights.\n\nIn late 1966, popular afternoon host Jerry G also decided to follow Draper to WCFL; upon his departure, he added the last name \"Bishop\", and later created the TV horror host persona \"Svengoolie\". He was replaced by WIXY's evening man Jack Armstrong, who then decided to call himself \"Big Jack, Your \"Leader\"\"; LaBarbara was moved to overnight to accommodate Armstrong's installation as the evening jock. In early 1967, the on air staff consisted of: LaBarbara, overnight; \"Charlie and Harrigan\", morning drive; Bob Cole, late morning; Jay Lawrence, mid afternoons; Chuck Dann, afternoon drive; and Big Jack in the prime time slot.\n\nWKYC \"Radio 11\" was a large record-selling influence as far away as New York City and Miami. However, its main local competition in those days was WIXY 1260 \"Super Radio\". Unlike WIXY, WKYC – being an NBC owned-and-operated station in a situation not unlike WRC (980 AM) in Washington – was obligated to carry all NBC Radio programming such as the weekend \"Monitor\", as well as all top-of-the-hour NBC Radio newscasts. The NBC Radio afternoon daily network news feed was also based from WKYC's studios and anchored by Virgil Dominic, who also served as WKYC-TV's lead news anchor.\n\nOn February 1, 1968, at 3:05 pm, following an NBC Radio newscast, the station altered its presentation to Power Radio, a derivative of the Drake-Chenault-created \"Boss Radio\" Top-40 format, programmed for WKYC by Hal Moore. The new sound emphasized \"more music\" with less chatter between songs and a tighter playlist. Personalities at that time included \"Charlie and Harrigan\", Bob Shannon, Chuck Dunaway, Lee 'Baby' Sims, Fred Winston, and Buddy Harrison. It remained a Top 40 station until February 1, 1969, when WKYC switched to an easy listening/middle of the road (MOR) format. Specs Howard left WKYC shortly thereafter, with Jim Runyon returning to succeed him in morning drive.\n\nFollowing rumors that NBC was interested in divesting some or all of their radio stations, NBC sold both WKYC and WKYC-FM to Ohio Communications, headed by sports franchiser Nick Mileti and investment firm C. F. Kettering, for approximately $5.5 million in a deal announced January 12, 1972. Broadcast executives Tom and Jim Embrescia joined the ownership group as vice-president/general manager and sales manager, respectively.\n\nThe AM radio station's call letters were changed to WWWE (purportedly for Embrescia or Entertainment) and adopted the 3WE brand; WKYC-FM became WWWM (purportedly for Mileti or Music); both changes took place on November 16, 1972. WWWE retained WKYC's easy listening/MOR format, but also added radio broadcasts for both the Cleveland Indians and Cleveland Cavaliers as Mileti owned both teams; WERE (1300 AM) had previously served as the flagship for both. Pete Franklin also joined the station from WERE and hosted \"Sportsline\", a five-hour long weeknight sports call-in show that also followed Indians and Cavaliers games, quickly becoming a legend with his acerbic personality, boasting that the station's nighttime signal could be heard in \"over 38 states and half of Canada.\"\n\nFollowing Jim Runyon's sudden departure and death from cancer in April 1973, the morning drive shift was taken over by Larry Morrow, formerly of WIXY; Morrow would be joined by Joe Tait as morning sportscaster, Tait also served as the lead play-by-play voice for both the Indians and Cavaliers. In addition to Franklin, Morrow and Tait, the daytime lineup included at one time or another, Phil McLean, Al James, Jim Davis, Jack Reynolds, Tony Matthews, Jeff Elliot, Johnny Andrews, Lanny Wheeler, Lee Andrews, Ted Alexander and Bill King.\n\nBoth WWWE and WWWM slowly severed the last remaining ties to WKYC-TV and its prior NBC ownership throughout the 1970s. The transmitter for WWWE was moved back to their previous tower in Brecksville on September 5, 1974, that tower is still in use today by WWWE's successor WTAM, along with FM stations WAKS (co-owned with WTAM) and WZAK. In addition, the studios for both WWWE and WWWM were moved to Park Centre—known today as Reserve Square—that November 14. WWWE would then drop its NBC Radio affiliation altogether by 1977.\n\nWWWE was sold to Combined Communications, Inc. in December 1976 for $7.5 million, consummated the following September; Ohio Communications retained WWWM. Combined Communications subsequently merged into Globe Broadcasting Corp., owner of WMGC (1260 AM) and WDOK; WMGC was spun off to comply with then-existing ownership rules. Gannett then merged into Combined Communications in June 1979 in a $370 million deal; at the time, it was one of the largest mergers and acquisitions in the broadcasting industry.\n\nIn December 1981, WWWE switched formats to country branded as Country 11, going in direct competition with WHK (1420 AM) and WKSW (99.5 FM). With the switch, the duo of Rick McGuire and Ron Marron were installed in morning drive, displacing Larry Morrow to afternoons; Morrow eventually left the station. Citing disappointing ratings and a waning audience in the market overall for country music, WWWE quietly switched back to an easy listening/MOR format in August 1983, again using the 3WE brand.\n\nLake Erie Broadcasting (whose principals included then-Cleveland Browns majority owner Art Modell and minority owner Al Lerner) purchased both WWWE and WDOK in February 1985 for $9.5 million; as part of the deal, Lake Erie sold off their existing AM station, WJW (AM), to Booth American for $2.1 million. Upon the deal's consummation, on June 11, 1985, Lake Erie changed WWWE's format from adult contemporary to the news/talk format previously heard on WJW; changed branding to Radio 11 WWWE; and reassigned all on and off-air staff from WJW over to WWWE, while inheriting all existing sports play-by-play and Pete Franklin's \"Sportsline\". Franklin himself left the station in May 1987 to become the afternoon drive host at WFAN (1050 AM) in New York City, later WFAN (660 AM); Bruce Drennan later took over as \"Sportsline\" host.\n\nWWWE and WDOK were sold to the Independent Group Ltd.—owned by Tom Embrescia, Tom Wilson and Larry Pollock—on November 30, 1987, where WWWE once again took the 3WE brand. Shock jock Gary Dee was hired as afternoon drive host, only to be fired on August 18, 1989, after multiple indecency complaints filed against him and the station as part of an anti-indecency campaign by the FCC, WWWE later paid an $8,000 fine. In the wake of the investigation, Independent Group Ltd. and Booth American swapped AM licenses for an undisclosed amount; on June 25, 1990, Booth American took over WWWE, and Independent Group Ltd. took over WRMR (850 AM), with some on- and off-air personnel being reassigned between the two stations.\n\nWWWE became affiliated with ABC Radio News, and its news department was taken to a 24-hour operation. Studios were moved to the Western Reserve Building on West Ninth Street overlooking the Flats. The station added both Paul Harvey (dropped from WGAR-FM) and \"The Rush Limbaugh Show\" (dropped from WERE) to its schedule, and former newsman Ed Coury was brought in from Washington, D.C. for afternoon drive, then was promoted to news director and host of the morning news program.\n\nFollowing the 1991 season, WWWE ended its radio contract with the Cleveland Indians, with the flagship rights going to WKNR (1220 AM); WKNR had previously hired away \"Sportsline\" host Geoff Sindelar as a drive-time host earlier in 1991. WWWE hired Craig Carton as \"Sportsline\" host in April 1992, replacing Mike Snyder, who was promoted to sports director, a position he holds to this day; Carton left the station in May 1993. WWWE picked up \"Imus in the Morning\" for morning drive in September 1993 after Westwood One offered up the show for national syndication.\n\nIn April 1994, Booth American merged with Broadcast Alchemy to form Secret Communications in a $160 million deal. Gary Bruce was hired from WIOD/Miami as program director that May, and hired two hosts from WIOD in a lineup revamp: Chuck Meyer for mornings, replacing \"Imus in the Morning\", and Jaz McKay for late mornings. The former WMMS morning team of Jeff Kinzbach and Ed \"Flash\" Ferenc were reunited in afternoon drive with \"Rock 'n Roll Talk Radio\", while Mike Trivisonno took over as \"Sportsline\" host; Trivisonno was a regular caller to Pete Franklin's iteration of the show and was dubbed \"Mr. Know It All\" derisively by Franklin. Eventually, Rich Michaels joined WWWE in May 1995 in the late morning position, and Jaz McKay was moved to late evenings. \"The Bob & Tom Show\" was also added to the lineup in evenings via tape-delay in October 1995.\n\nUnfortunately, WWWE itself would make news on January 23, 1996, when its traffic plane hit a cellular phone tower and crashed in Highland Hills, killing both MetroTraffic reporter James Endsley (who was known on-air as Fred Wesley) and pilot James McVeigh.\n\nIn 1996, ownership decided to replace the WWWE call letters. The station was temporarily branded as \"Newsradio AM 1100\" during this time, and in searching for a new \"AM\"-related callsign, it found that the original WTAM call was available. On July 26, 1996, the station once again became WTAM, forty years after having dropped the call letters, and adopted the WTAM 1100 brand. The WWWE call sign was later assigned to a 5,000 watt daytime station in Atlanta (which coincidentally also broadcasts on 1100 kHz).\n\nJacor Communications purchased WTAM and WLTF from Secret Communications on April 25, 1997, then purchased WKNR (1220 AM) from Cablevision that August 19. WKNR's flagship status for the Cleveland Indians Radio Network was transferred to WTAM at the start of the 1998 season; WKNR was then traded to Capstar Broadcasting in exchange for WTAE/Pittsburgh as part of a Justice Department settlement after Jacor's purchase of Nationwide Communications (which also reunited WTAM with its former FM counterpart WMJI). In May 1999, iHeartMedia (then known as Clear Channel Communications) completed its $6.5 billion purchase of Jacor and its 454 stations, including WTAM.\n\nAs the Indians flagship station, and picking up some popular nationally syndicated talk shows, such as Dr. Laura Schlessinger (who replaced Rich Michaels) and Coast to Coast AM, WTAM began to build – and sustain – an audience. Unlikely success was found with Mike Trivisonno in 1996 after he was moved into the afternoon-drive shift and eventually became a lead-in to the Indians and Cavaliers broadcasts.\n\nIn 1998, Bill Wills was brought in from sister station WLW in Cincinnati and was paired with long-time Cleveland radio veterans John Webster and Casey Coleman to host \"Wills, Webster and Coleman in the Morning\" – a morning drive news show patterned after Wills' show on WLW. (Webster retired in 2001, and the morning shows' title was shortened to \"Wills and Coleman\").\n\nGlenn Beck replaced Dr. Laura Schlessinger in late mornings following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Then, Beck was replaced in March 2005 with Jerry Springer's mid-morning show. On March 2006, WTAM replaced Springer with a local program hosted by Bob Frantz, coming over from Clear Channel sister station WSPD in Toledo. Beck's show was then brought back on November 3, 2008, bumping Frantz to evenings (Frantz has since left the station).\n\nStudios for all of Clear Channel's Cleveland stations, including WTAM, were consolidated into a new facility in Independence, Ohio by July 2002. WTAM canceled its fifteen-year affiliation with ABC Radio in August 2005, picking up Fox News Radio in a nationwide deal that involved other Clear Channel talk stations, but continued to run ABC Radio's Paul Harvey until August 12, 2006.\n\nOn November 27, 2006, Casey Coleman, who was co-host of the popular \"Wills and Coleman\" morning show, and sideline reporter on the station's coverage of the Cleveland Browns, died following a fifteen-month bout with pancreatic cancer at the age of 55. Sports director Mike Snyder was brought into the morning slot to succeed Casey, and the program was renamed \"Wills and Snyder\".\n\nThe station was one of 10 stations awarded the 2007 Crystal Radio Award for public service awarded by the National Association of Broadcasters. Winners were honored at the Radio Luncheon on April 17, 2007, during the NAB Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nOn September 22, 2018, WTAM announced that reporter, author, attorney and talk show host Geraldo Rivera would join the station for a daily one-hour show, \"Geraldo in Cleveland\", in addition to a weekly podcast on the parent iHeartRadio app, effective September 24.\n\nAs of September 6, 2018, WTAM simulcasts over low-power Cleveland FM translator W295DE (106.9 FM).\n\nWTAM personalities Bill Wills and Mike Snyder host the weekday morning show, followed by a local program hosted by Geraldo Rivera. Conservative talk shows \"The Glenn Beck Program\" and \"The Rush Limbaugh Show\" each air middays, both of which are syndicated via Premiere Networks. WTAM personality Mike Trivisonno hosts the weekday afternoon show. Paranormal/conspiracy theory oriented programs \"Ground Zero\" with Clyde Lewis, and \"Coast to Coast AM\" with George Noory air late evenings through the overnight hours, both via Premiere. WTAM also airs national news updates from ABC News Radio, and local weather updates from WKYC/Cleveland.\n\nWTAM airs several weekend talk programs, including syndicated shows hosted by Gary Sullivan and Bill Cunningham, and weekend editions of \"Coast to Coast AM\". The station satisfies public affairs programming on Sunday mornings with the City Club of Cleveland's \"Friday Forum\". WTAM also airs Fox Sports Radio programming on weekends. During football season WTAM airs local pregame and postgame shows before and after Cleveland Browns games.\n\nWTAM has served as the AM flagship station for the Cleveland Cavaliers Radio Network since 2014, sharing network flagship status with FM sister station WMMS. WTAM previously served as the sole network flagship from 1973 to 1981; from 1984 to 1988; and from 1990 to 2014. On-site, play-by-play announcer Tim Alcorn calls games alongside color analyst Jim Chones, a former Cavaliers center. In studio, WTAM sports director Mike Snyder hosts \"The Tip-Off Show\", \"The Halftime Report\", and \"The Nightcap Recap\" – the network pregame, halftime, and postgame shows, respectively. WTAM airs all additional network programming, including: \"Cavs HQ\", a weekly year-round show simulcast on Fox Sports Ohio; and \"Cavaliers Update\", a daily drive time segment. WTAM also airs supplementary local programming, including: \"Cavs Now\", a station pregame show which precedes the network pregame show. Play-by-play itself is limited to the over-the-air AM broadcast (& FM translator simulcast); due to league restrictions, the WTAM webcast on iHeartRadio does not stream play-by-play coverage online.\n\nWTAM has also served as the AM flagship station for the Cleveland Indians Radio Network since 2013, again sharing network flagship status with FM sister station WMMS. WTAM previously served as the sole network flagship from 1973 to 1991; and again from 1998 to 2013. Play-by-play announcers Tom Hamilton and Jim Rosenhaus call games on-site. Rosenhaus hosts \"Indians Warm-Up\", the network pregame show; and Hamilton hosts \"Indians Wrap-Up\", the network postgame show. WTAM airs all additional network programming, including: \"Tribe Talk\", a weekly year-round show; \"Indians Update\", a daily drive time segment; and \"Hot Stove Weekly\", an off-season show. WTAM also airs supplementary local programming, including: \"Tribe Insider\", a station pregame show which precedes the network pregame show; and \"Extra Innings\", a station postgame call-in show which follows the network postgame show. In addition, play-by-play is again limited to the over-the-air AM broadcast (& FM translator simulcast); due to league restrictions, the WTAM webcast on iHeartRadio does not stream play-by-play coverage online.\n\n"}

It was designed by Alden B. Dow and built in 1960 for $3.5 million (equivalent to $ million today).\n\nAs of the 2015–16 season, McMorran has been the home of the Port Huron Prowlers of the Federal Prospects Hockey League. Previous hockey tenants include the Port Huron Flags (various incarnations), Port Huron Wings, Port Huron Border Cats, Port Huron Beacons, Port Huron IceHawks, and Port Huron Fighting Falcons.\n\nThe arena seats 3,400 for ice hockey and indoor football, and 4,800 for concerts. The arena floor measures 85 feet by 185 feet (27 by 62 meters). The dasher boards have 8-foot glass on the ends and 4-foot glass on the sides for ice hockey. The arena is also used for conventions, circuses, ice shows, trade shows, and banquets, among other events. The arena has hosted many major headlining musicians throughout the years such as Kiss, Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, Van Halen, Bon Jovi, Rush, Ozzy Osbourne, Johnny Cash.\n\nThe 1998 opening of RBC Centre in Sarnia, Ontario sent most of the arena's concert business across the St. Clair River, which separates Port Huron from Sarnia. However, in 2010 McMorran started to rejuvenate their concert lineup with the band Third Eye Blind. In 2012, McMorran Arena and the adjacent pavilion were used for the Devil's Asylum haunted house. As a result, the Fighting Falcons began their season on the road.\n\nAs of 2019, there are talks to renovate the arena, as well as increase the capacity to be more competitive in the entertainment market.\n\nThe pavilion features of space for sporting events, trade shows, banquets, meetings, and conventions. In 2016, the city of Port Huron sold the pavilion to St. Clair County Community College for $1. Following the transaction, the Port Huron Minor Hockey Association, which was housed at the Pavilion, merged with the Blue Water Hockey Association, which is run out of Glacier Pointe Ice Complex in Port Huron. SC4 is renovating the building, and will open it in October as the SC4 Fieldhouse. It will serve as the home to SC4's athletic teams. It will also be available for community use, hosting tournaments, showcases and camps in various sports and at various levels.\n\nThe 1,157-seat theatre is used for Broadway shows, movies, concerts, and other stage events. It features not only excellent acoustics and sight lines, but also a stage curtain, also designed by Alden B. Dow. It is home to the International Symphony Orchestra and the Port Huron Civic Theatre.\n\nIn addition, there is a meeting room and a lounge at the complex. Outside the building is a clock and the Night and Day fountain, both by sculptor Marshall Fredericks.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2323622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323622", "title": "Dental plaque", "text": "Dental plaque\n\nDental plaque is a biofilm or mass of bacteria that grows on surfaces within the mouth. It is a sticky colorless deposit at first, but when it forms tartar, it is often brown or pale yellow. It is commonly found between the teeth, on the front of teeth, behind teeth, on chewing surfaces, along the gumline, or below the gumline cervical margins. Dental plaque is also known as microbial plaque, oral biofilm, dental biofilm, dental plaque biofilm or bacterial plaque biofilm. Bacterial plaque is one of the major causes for dental decay and gum disease.\n\nProgression and build-up of dental plaque can give rise to tooth decay – the localised destruction of the tissues of the tooth by acid produced from the bacterial degradation of fermentable sugar – and periodontal problems such as gingivitis and periodontitis; hence it is important to disrupt the mass of bacteria and remove it. Plaque control and removal can be achieved with correct daily or twice-daily tooth brushing and use of interdental aids such as dental floss and interdental brushes.\n\nOral hygiene is important as dental biofilms may become acidic causing demineralization of the teeth (also known as dental caries) or harden into dental calculus (also known as tartar). Calculus cannot be removed through tooth brushing or with interdental aids, but only through professional cleaning.\n\nDental plaque is a biofilm that attaches to tooth surfaces, restorations and prosthetic appliances (including dentures and bridges) if left undisturbed. Understanding the formation, composition and characteristics of plaque helps in its control. An acquired pellicle is a layer of saliva that is composed of mainly glycoproteins and forms shortly after cleaning of the teeth or exposure of new teeth. Bacteria then attach to the pellicle layer, form micro-colonies, and mature on the tooth, which can result in oral diseases. The following table provides a more detailed (six-step) explanation of biofilm formation:\n\nDifferent types of bacteria are normally present in the mouth. These bacteria, as well as leukocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes, are part of the normal oral cavity and contribute to the individual's health. Approximately 80–90% of the weight of plaque is water. While 70% of the dry weight is bacteria, the remaining 30% consists of polysaccharides and glycoproteins.\n\nThe bulk of the microorganisms that form the biofilm are \"Streptococcus mutans\" and other anaerobes, though the precise composition varies by location in the mouth. Examples of such anaerobes include fusobacterium and actinobacteria. \"S. mutans\" and other anaerobes are the initial colonisers of the tooth surface, and play a major role in the establishment of the early biofilm community. These microorganisms all occur naturally present in the oral cavity and are normally harmless. However, failure to remove plaque by regular tooth-brushing allows them to proliferate unchecked and thereby build up in a thick layer, which can by virtue of their ordinary metabolism cause any of various dental diseases for the host. Those microorganisms nearest the tooth surface typically obtain energy by fermenting dietary sucrose; during fermentation they begin to produce acids.\n\nThe bacterial equilibrium position varies at different stages of formation. Below is a summary of the bacteria that may be present during the phases of plaque maturation:\n\nDental plaque is considered a biofilm adhered to the tooth surface. It is a meticulously formed microbial community, that is organised to a particular structure and function. Plaque is rich in species, given the fact that about 1000 different bacterial species have been recognised using modern techniques.\n\nA clean tooth surface would immediately be colonised by salivary pellicles, which acts as an adhesive. This allows the first bacteria (early colonisers) to attach to the tooth, then colonise and grow. After some growth of early colonisers, the biofilm becomes more compliant to other species of bacteria, known as late colonisers.\n\n\n\n\"Fusobacterium nucleatum\" is found between the early and late colonisers, linking them together.\n\nSome salivary components are crucial for plaques ecosystem, such as salivary alpha-amylase which plays a role in binding and adhesion. Proline-rich rich proteins (PRP) and statherins are also involved in the formation of plaque.\n\nSupragingival biofilm is dental plaque that forms above the gums, and is the first kind of plaque to form after the brushing of the teeth. It commonly forms in between the teeth, in the pits and grooves of the teeth and along the gums. It is made up of mostly aerobic bacteria, meaning these bacteria need oxygen to survive. If plaque remains on the tooth for a longer period of time, anaerobic bacteria begin to grow in this plaque.\n\nSubgingival biofilm is plaque that is located under the gums. It occurs after the formation of the supragingival biofilm by a downward growth of the bacteria from above the gums to below. This plaque is mostly made up of anaerobic bacteria, meaning that these bacteria will only survive if there is no oxygen. As this plaque attaches in a pocket under the gums, they are not exposed to oxygen in the mouth and will therefore thrive if not removed.\n\nThe extracellular matrix contains proteins, long-chain polysaccharides and lipids.\n\nThe most common reasons for ecosystem disruption are the ecological factors discussed in the environment section. The bacteria that exhibit the most fit plasticity for the change in environment dominate the given environment. Often, this leads to opportunistic pathogens which may cause dental caries and periodontal disease. Pathogenic bacteria that have the potential to cause dental caries flourish in acidic environments; those that have the potential to cause periodontal disease flourish in a slightly alkaline environment.\n\nAntibodies to the oral pathogens \"Campylobacter rectus\", \"Veillonella parvula\", \"Prevotella melaninogenica\" were associated with hypertension.\n\nUnlike other parts of the body, tooth surfaces are uniquely hard and non shedding. Therefore, the warm and moist environment of the mouth and the presence of teeth, makes a good environment for growth and development of dental plaque. The main ecological factors that contribute to plaque formation are pH, saliva, temperature and redox reactions. The normal pH range of saliva is between 6 and 7 and plaque biofilm is known to flourish in a pH between 6.7 and 8.3. This indicates that the natural environment of the mouth provided by saliva is ideal for the growth of bacteria in the dental plaque. Saliva acts as a buffer, which helps to maintain the pH in the mouth between 6 and 7. In addition to acting as a buffer, saliva and gingival crevicular fluid contain primary nutrients including amino acids, proteins and glycoproteins. This feeds the bacteria involved in plaque formation. The host diet plays only a minor role in providing nutrients for the resident microflora. The normal temperature of the mouth ranges between 35 and 36 °C, and a two-degree (°C) change has been shown to drastically shift the dominant species in the plaque. Redox reactions are carried out by aerobic bacteria. This keeps the oxygen levels in the mouth at a semi-stable homeostatic condition, which allows the bacteria to survive.\n\nGingivitis is an inflammatory lesion, mediated by host-parasite interactions that remains localised to the gingival tissue, it is a common result of plaque build-up around the gingival tissues. The bacteria found in the biofilm elicit a host response resulting in localized inflammation of the tissue. This is characterized by the cardinal signs of inflammation including a red, puffy appearance of the gums and bleeding due to brushing or flossing.\nGingivitis due to plaque can be reversible by removal of the plaque. However, if left for an extended period of time, the inflammation may begin to affect the supporting tissues, in a progression referred to as periodontitis. The gingivitis response is a protective mechanism, averting periodontitis in many cases.\n\nPeriodontitis is an infection of the gums which leads to bone destruction around the teeth in the jaw. Periodontitis occurs after gingivitis has been established, but not all individuals who have gingivitis will get periodontitis. Plaque accumulation is vital in the progression of periodontitis as the bacteria in plaque release enzymes which attack the bone and cause it to break down, and at the same time osteoclasts in the bone break down the bone as a way to prevent further infection. This can be treated with strict oral hygiene such as tooth brushing and cleaning in between the teeth as well as surgical debridement completed by a dental professional.\n\nAccumulated bacteria, due to the onset of periodontitis from dental plaque, may gain access to distant sites in the body through the circulatory and respiratory system, potentially contributing to various systematic diseases and conditions. Due to the infectious nature of bacteria hosted within the oral cavity, bacteria produced cavity can spread within the system of the human body and causes adverse health conditions. Bacteria access comes from the ulcerated epithelium of the periodontal pocket that results from accumulation of infection within the gingiva. Conditions and diseases can include:\n\n\nDental caries is an infectious disease caused primarily by \"Streptococcus mutans\", characterized by acid demineralization of the enamel, which can progress to further breakdown of the more organic, inner dental tissue (dentin). The bacterial community would mainly consist of acidogenic and acid-tolerating species (e.g. \"Mutans streptococci\" and \"lactobacilli\"), while other species with relevant characteristics may also be involved. \nEverybody is susceptible to caries but the probability of development depends on the patient’s individual disease indicators, risk factors, and preventive factors. Factors that are considered high-risk for developing carious lesions on the teeth include:\n\nOrganic acids released from dental plaque lead to demineralization of the adjacent tooth surface, and consequently to dental caries. Saliva is also unable to penetrate the build-up of plaque and thus cannot act to neutralize the acid produced by the bacteria and remineralize the tooth surface.\n\nThere are two main methods of detecting dental plaque in the oral cavity: through the application of a disclosing gel or tablet, and/or visually through observation. Plaque detection is usually detected clinically by plaque disclosing agents. Disclosing agents contain dye which turns bright red to indicate plaque build-up.\n\nIt is important for an individual to be aware of what to look for when doing a self-assessment for dental plaque. It is important to be aware that everyone has dental plaque, however, the severity of the build-up and the consequences of not removing the plaque can vary.\n\nPlaque disclosing products, also known as disclosants, make plaque clinically visible. Clean surfaces of the teeth do not absorb the disclosant, only rough surfaces. Plaque disclosing gels can be either completed at home or in the dental clinic. Before using these at home or in the dental clinic check with your general practitioners for any allergies to iodine, food colouring or any other ingredients that may be present in these products. These gels provide a visual aid in assessing plaque biofilm presence and can also show the maturity of the dental plaque.\n\nDisclosing tablets are similar to that of disclosing gels, except that they are placed in the mouth and chewed on for approximately one minute. The remaining tablet or saliva is then spit out. Disclosing gels will show the presence of the plaque, but will often not show the level of maturity of the plaque. Disclosing tablets are often prescribed or given to patients with orthodontic appliances for use before and after tooth brushing to ensure optimal cleaning. These are also helpful educational tools for young children or patients who are struggling to remove dental plaque in certain areas. Disclosing gels and tablets are useful for individuals of all ages in ensuring efficient dental plaque removal.\n\nDental biofilm begins to form on the tooth only minutes after brushing. It can be difficult to see dental plaque on the hard tissue surfaces, however it can be felt as a rough surface. It is often felt as a thick, fur-like deposit that may present as a yellow, tan or brown stain. These deposits are commonly found on teeth or dental appliances such as orthodontic brackets. The most common way dental plaque is assessed is through dental assessment in the dental clinic where dental instruments are able to scrape up some plaque. The most common areas where patients find plaque are between the teeth and along the cervical margins.\n\nDental plaque is also extremely common in domestic animals such as dogs and cats. However, the bacteria associated with canine and feline plaque appear to be different from that of humans. If untreated it can lead to more severe gum disease such as periodontitis; hence veterinarians often recommend oral healthcare products for affected pets.\n\n\n"}

It is a sidescrolling platform game where the player assumes the role as the \"Legendary Warrior\", battling through a hostile landscape. The main feature of gameplay is the use of a weapon called the \"Diskarmor\", a shield with a long chain attached to it.\n\nThe arcade game begins with the following introduction:\n\n\"4.5 billion years have passed since Earth's creation. Many dominators have ruled in all their glory, but time was their greatest enemy and it defeated their reign. And now a new dominator's reign begins...\"\n\nInformation gleaned from console manuals reveals that the evil being Ligar has taken over the land of Argool, and Rygar, a dead warrior who has risen from his grave, must use his Diskarmor to stop him. In console versions clues and limited dialogue are given in the form of large, sage-like men encountered in green stone temples throughout the game.\n\nIn the Japanese original, references to \"Ligar\" and \"Rygar\" are one and the same because the Roman syllables \"Li\" and \"Ry\" come from the same Japanese character. In this version, the hero is only referred to as \"The Legendary Warrior\", while both \"Rygar\" and \"Ligar\" refer to the main villain.\n\nThe game was ported to the Sharp X68000, Commodore 64, Master System (Japan only, and renamed ), ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and the Atari Lynx. It was also included in a compilation of games called \"Tecmo Classic Arcade\" for the Xbox. The arcade version was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console.\n\nThe Atari Lynx version closely follows the arcade version. However, the layout of some rounds are different, and there are only 23 rounds.\n\n\"Rygar\", released in Japan as is a fantasy-themed action-adventure platform game with action RPG elements developed by Tecmo for the Nintendo Famicom. It was released on April 14, 1987, in Japan and later that year in the United States for the NES. A European release came in 1990.\n\nThe player sends the title character through a number of fantastic settings with the ultimate goal of defeating the evil King Ligar in order to restore peace to the realm of Argool (Argus in the Japanese version). To accomplish this goal, the Warrior must visit five Indora gods who present him with essential items needed for completion of the game. Each of the Indora gods is located in a different realm, and is almost always guarded by a boss. The player can choose the order in which some stages are played, but since certain items are required to reach new areas, choices are somewhat limited. After playing through the five major realms of the game, he must journey to King Ligar's flying castle for the final confrontation. \n\nThe main character, his weapon, and many of the enemies remain the same, but the gameplay is quite different. While the arcade version is more of a standard side-scrolling action title, the NES's \"Rygar\" is an open-ended action-adventure game like \"Metroid\" (see Metroidvania), which was also released at the time. At the beginning of the game, Rygar has access to some of the worlds, but as the game progresses, new areas open up as the result of finding items such as the grappling hook, crossbow, and wind pulley, which lets him cross previously impassable obstacles. The NES version of \"Rygar\" was also more of an action role-playing game with a nonlinear open world map in Garloz. It was particularly notable for its permanent power-up mechanic, which at the time blurred the line between the power-ups used in action-adventures and the experience points used in RPGs.\n\nThis version of \"Rygar\" did not allow for game saves. The cartridge did not contain a battery, nor did it feature a password feature. It did however have unlimited continues.\n\nThe American NES version replaced some of the soundtracks from its Famicom counterpart but is otherwise graphically identical, save for the titlescreen and language. The music for either the NES or Famicom versions was composed by Michiharu Hasuya who would later reuse one Rygar's tracks on the titlescreen of \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\". \n\nThe PAL version of the NES game reportedly contained a computer error which inadvertently increased (substantially) the difficulty in the final portions of the game, particularly in beating the final boss. The PAL version limited the player's tone and last stats to 1023 points instead of 4095, which meant that there was less maximum life and noticeably less damage to enemies.\n\n\"Rygar\" has received positive reviews. Allgame editor Michael W. Dean said of the NES version that \"(the) game features excellent control and pacing, the freedom of nonlinear level design, good graphics, a fabulous soundtrack, and one of the coolest weapons that any videogame hero has ever wielded\".\n\n\"STart\" said of the Lynx version that the \"simple game\" was only recommended to \"jump-and-shoot arcade enthusiasts\". CVG Magazine reviewed the Lynx version in their March 1991 issue calling the game \"dull\" and only giving 46 out of 100. Julian Boardman of Raze Magazine reviewed the game in their April 1991 issue and liked \"some superb backgrounds\" the \"wide variety of gruesome monsters\" with \"enough depth for most gamesters\". He also noted the game lacked a certain amount of challenge, giving a final score of 81%.\n\nRobert A. Jung review was published to IGN, in his final verdict he wrote; \"Rygar for the Lynx is a \"typical\" game, neither extremely outstanding nor truly disappointing. While fans of the arcade game will find slight differences, it's close enough to be familiar (especially since the only other adaptation was a vastly different game for the Nintendo). Though there are only 23 levels, the lack of a level skip and game continues means this is an average-difficulty endurance contest which will take some time to finish.\" Giving a final score of 7 out of 10.\n\nIn 2002, a remake titled \"Rygar: The Legendary Adventure\" was released by Tecmo for PlayStation 2. It features a transition to 3-D graphics and portions of the environment are destructible. It was released to generally positive reviews. On May 11, 2007, a Wii port was announced at Tecmo's \"Nite Out 07\" event, eventually released on January 28, 2009 in North America.\n\n"}

It was the second-ever Super X Cup tournament and the last held until 2017. The competition began on July 19, 2005 and concluded on August 14, 2005 at TNA's Sacrifice pay-per-view (PPV) event. Then-TNA X Division Champion Christopher Daniels called the contest the \"Christopher Daniels Invitational\".\n\nThe tournament featured eight TNA wrestlers: A.J. Styles, Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Michael Shane, Petey Williams, Samoa Joe, Shocker, and Sonjay Dutt. The event was preceded by a four-way qualification match at TNA's No Surrender PPV event on July 17, 2005 in which Dutt defeated Elix Skipper, Mikey Batts and Shark Boy. Samoa Joe and A.J. Styles passed through the quarterfinals and the semifinals to make it to the tournament final at Sacrifice. Joe defeated Styles at the event, thus winning the Super X Cup trophy and becoming number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship. Despite losing to Joe, Styles was added to the title match Joe received for winning the competition due to storyline reasons. TNA held a Three Way match for the TNA X Division Championship between Daniels, Joe, and Styles at the Unbreakable PPV event on September 11, 2005, which Styles won to become the new TNA X Division Champion.\n\nCanadian Online Explorer columnist Corey David Lacroix reviewed Sacrifice, giving the Super X Cup final a rating of 8 out of 10. Lacorix said the final \"could have been a certified Match of the Year contender if someone in the back had not decided to make Daniels interfere in this contest.\" He went on to say the match \"was a thing of beauty that got stained.\" Wade Keller of the \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" gave the Super X Cup final four out of five stars. Keller wrote that it was a \"four-star match that was begging to be given an extra ten minutes to be a match of the year candidate.\"\n\nTNA editor Bill Banks announced the tournament in July 2005 in his \"Bank Shot\" column, adding that the final would be held at TNA's Sacrifice PPV event on August 14, 2005. The 2005 tournament was the second Super X Cup held. The first was the 2003 TNA Super X Cup Tournament, won by Chris Sabin in September 2003. Winners of Super X Cup tournaments receive trophies and a future TNA X Division Championship match.\n\nTNA announced the final list of eight participants in July 2005: A.J. Styles, Alex Shelley, Sabin, Michael Shane, Petey Williams, Samoa Joe, Shocker, and Sonjay Dutt. Dutt defeated Elix Skipper, Mikey Batts, and Shark Boy in a Four Way Super X Cup qualification match on July 27, 2005 at TNA's No Surrender PPV event on July 17, 2005 to enter the tournament.\n\nThe 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament featured seven matches involving numerous wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes and less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in wrestling matches.\nThe tournament consisted of three rounds: the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. The quarterfinals and the semifinals took place on TNA's television program \"TNA Impact!\", while the finals were held at Sacrifice. The quarterfinals\nwere taped on July 19 and aired on the July 22 and July 29 episodes of \"Impact!\". The semifinals were also taped on July 19 before airing on August 5 and August 10 episodes of \"Impact!\" Then-TNA X Division Champion Christopher Daniels provided commentary for each encounter. Daniels nicknamed the competition the \"Christopher Daniels Invitational\".\n\nIn the first of two quarterfinal matches aired on July 22, Samoa Joe fought Sonjay Dutt in a match lasting 9 minutes and 32 seconds. Joe won after forcing Dutt to submit with his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold. The second bout pitted A.J. Styles against Michael Shane. Before the match began, Shane announced he was changing his stage name to Matt Bentley. Styles won after America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) interfered. Harris distracted the referee, allowing Storm to kick Bentley in the face.\n\nThe third and fourth quarterfinal bouts aired on July 29. Alex Shelley fought Shocker in the first match of the episode, winning with a pinning combination at 5 minutes and 28 seconds. Petey Williams faced Chris Sabin in the second match. A-1 interfered during the encounter by distracting the referee and tossing Williams a hockey stick, which Williams used to hit Sabin across the stomach. He then performed his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver, forcing Sabin's head into the mat and winning the match at 11 minutes and 45 seconds.\n\nJoe, Shelley, Styles, and Williams advanced to the semifinals. The first match took place on the August 5 episode of \"Impact!\" between Joe and Shelley. Joe slammed Shelley back-first into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and then choked him unconscious with the Coquina Clutch at 9 minutes and 4 seconds to win and advance to the finals. In the second semifinal match on August 10, Styles defeated Williams with a small package pin at 9 minutes and 19 seconds.\n\nThe tournament final between A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe took place on August 14 at Sacrifice. As Styles laid against the ring ropes at the beginning of the match, Joe ran across the ring and kicked him in the face, causing him to fly out of the ring and crash down on the floor. Joe followed by diving through the ring ropes and smashing Styles in the face with his forearm as Styles reached his feet. Joe later held Styles in an STF submission hold, which he was forced to release when Styles touched the bottom rope. Styles then gained the advantage with a dropkick and front-flip splash from the ring ropes. He held Joe on his shoulders before twisting him off into a powerbomb, or what he calls a Rack Bomb. During the move, referee Andrew Thomas was kicked in the face and knocked unconscious, allowing Daniels to interfere in the contest. Daniels attacked Styles and attempted to hit Joe with the X Division Title belt before Styles threw Daniels from the ring. Joe followed by lifting Styles up and performing his Muscle Buster maneuver, then placing Styles in his Coquina Clutch submission hold. Styles submitted to the move as the referee came to, giving the victory to Joe. The final bout lasted 15 minutes and 15 seconds.\n\nJoe's win gave him the Super X Cup trophy and made him the number-one contender for the TNA X Division Championship. He earned a title match against Daniels at TNA's Unbreakable PPV event on September 11.\n\nJames Caldwell of Pro Wrestling Torch called the Samoa Joe versus Sonjay Dutt encounter in the quarterfinals \"another phenomenal match involving Samoa Joe,\" and wrote that it was \"another reason to build the X Division – and the promotion – around Joe.\" Caldwell also praised the A.J. Styles versus Matt Bentley bout in the quarterfinals, calling it a \"solid, methodical match that told a story in the ring.\" Canadian Online Explorer journalist Chris Sokol said the Styles versus Bentley contest was a \"great match.\" Caldwell said of the July 29 quarterfinal between Alex Shelley and Shocker that \"with Shelley winning the match using Shocker's traditional roll up pinning combination, Shelley looked strong coming out of the match for outsmarting his opponent.\" He went on to say if the bout had lasted longer it \"could have allowed the match to tell a more complete story, but the match was good for delivering the intended purpose.\" Sokol said in a column about the show that it was an \"excellent match\". On the quarterfinal between Sabin and Williams, Caldwell said the two men \"put together a solid finish that was ruined by yet another round of outside interference by Team Canada\". Sokol called it \"another excellent match.\"\n\nReviews of the semifinal matches on August 5 and 10 were also generally positive. Caldwell said the Joe versus Shelley contest was \"another outstanding Samoa Joe match.\" Sokol said the Styles versus Williams bout was a \"back and forth match\", and Caldwell said it was \"a solid match\" that was \"nothing spectacular or particularly breathtaking, but it didn't need to be because the crowd was into the match simply because of who was in the ring.\" He went on to say that the wrestlers \"didn't need to pull of a four star match with amazing spots to wow the crowd because they had the audience captivated from the get-go.\"\n\nCanadian Online Explorer columnist Corey David Lacroix reviewed Sacrifice, giving the Super X Cup Final an 8 out of 10 rating. Lacorix wrote that the Super X Cup Final \"could have been a certified Match of the Year contender if someone in the back had not decided to make Daniels interfere in this contest.\" He went on to say the match \"was a thing of beauty that got stained.\" Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch gave the Super X Cup Final four stars out of five, calling it a \"four star match that was begging to be given an extra ten minutes to be a match of the year candidate.\"\n\nA.J. Styles suffered a tendon injury during his title bout with Samoa Joe at Sacrifice. TNA management kept him out of the following \"Impact!\" tapings, hoping to keep him rested and not risk any further injury despite expectations that he would not be sidelined long. Styles, however, canceled an appearance in the Ring of Honor promotion on August 20. He came back for a promotion on August 27 at their Dragon's Gate Invasion event, losing a match to CIMA.\n\nAfter winning the 2005 TNA Super X Cup tournament, Samoa Joe was set to face Christopher Daniels for the TNA X Division Championship at Unbreakable. On the August 19 episode of \"Impact!\", however, Styles assaulted Daniels in an act of revenge for Daniels' interference at Sacrifice. Daniels demanded Styles be suspended for this action. NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko denied the request, and instead added Styles to the planned encounter at Unbreakable, thus making it a Three Way match for the TNA X Division Championship. TNA promoted the match as an X Division \"Dream Bout\" pitting the top competitors in the division against each other for the championship. Styles won the match and the title by pinning Daniels. Wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer bestowed a rare 5 Star match rating to the bout between A.J. Styles, Christopher Daniels and Samoa Joe. \n\nThe three-way match began an extended storyline involving its participants. At TNA's Bound for Glory PPV event on October 23, Styles defeated Daniels in a 30-minute Iron Man match to retain the TNA X Division Championship. TNA then held a Four-on-Four Elimination X match at the Genesis PPV event on November 13. In that match, the team of Alex Shelley, Daniels, Joe, and Roderick Strong defeated the team of Austin Aries, Chris Sabin, Matt Bentley, and Sonjay Dutt. After the contest, Joe assaulted Daniels, performing his signature Muscle Buster maneuver on him twice, the second time on a steel chair. Daniels suffered an injury in the storyline in the attack, sidelining him until December 11's TNA Turning Point PPV event. At that event, Daniels saved Styles from an assault by Joe following Joe's victory over Styles to win the TNA X Division Championship. Daniels then challenged Joe for the championship at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January 15, 2006, but Joe retained the title. At TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 12, 2006, Daniels, Joe, and Styles competed in another three-way match for the TNA X Division Championship; Joe gained the pinfall to retain the title. The three competed again in a three-way Ultimate X match for the championship at TNA's Destination X PPV event on March 12, 2006. Daniels won, becoming the new TNA X Division Champion. The rivalry ended on the April 13, 2006 episode of \"Impact!\" when Joe defeated Daniels to win back the championship.\n\nDue to the popularity of the rivalry between the three in 2005 and 2006, TNA held another three-way match at TNA's Turning Point PPV event on November 15, 2009, this time for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Then-champion Styles retained his title, beating Daniels and Joe. Styles went on to successfully defend the title against Daniels at the following TNA PPV event, Final Resolution, on December 20, 2009.\n\nMost of the wrestlers involved in the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament, excluding Bentley, Styles, and Joe, went on to compete in the Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament. In that contest, eight tag teams were drawn at random, and veteran wrestlers were matched with younger wrestlers. Shelley partnered with Sean Waltman, Sabin and Shocker were placed together, Dutt was placed with Ron Killings, and Kip James and Petey Williams teamed up in the tournament. Sabin and Shocker ended faced Shelley and Waltman in the tournament final on the September 9, 2005 episode of \"Impact!\". Shelley and Waltman won to win the Chris Candido Cup.\n\n"}

{"id": "2323677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323677", "title": "George Rapp", "text": "George Rapp\n\nJohn George Rapp (; November 1, 1757 in Iptingen, Duchy of Württemberg – August 7, 1847 in Economy, Pennsylvania) was the founder of the religious sect called Harmonists, Harmonites, Rappites, or the Harmony Society.\n\nBorn in Iptingen, Duchy of Württemberg, Germany, Rapp became inspired by the philosophies of Jakob Böhme, Philipp Jakob Spener, and Emanuel Swedenborg, among others. In the 1780s, George Rapp began preaching and soon started to gather a group of his own followers. His group officially split with the Lutheran Church in 1785 and was promptly banned from meeting. The persecution that Rapp and his followers experienced caused them to leave Germany and come to the United States in 1803. Rapp was a Pietist, and a number of his beliefs were shared by the Anabaptists, as well as groups such as the Shakers.\n\nRapp's religious beliefs and philosophy were the cement that held his community together both in Germany and in America – a Christian community and commune, which in America organized as the Harmony Society. The Harmony Society built three American towns, became rich, famous, and survived for 100 years – roughly from 1805 until 1905. \n\nIn 1791, George Rapp said, \"I am a prophet and I am called to be one\" in front of the civil affairs official in Maulbronn, Germany, who promptly had him imprisoned for two days and threatened with exile if he did not cease preaching. To the great consternation of church and state authorities, this peasant from Iptingen had become the outspoken leader of several thousand Separatists in the southern German duchy of Württemberg. In 1798, Rapp and his group of followers had further distanced themselves from mainstream society. In the Lomersheimer Declaration, written in 1798, Rapp's followers refused to serve in the military or attend Lutheran schools. By 1802, the Separatists had grown in number to about 12,000 and the Württemberg government decided that they were a dangerous threat to social order. Rapp was summoned to Maulbronn for an interrogation and the government confiscated Separatist books. When released in 1803, Rapp told his followers to pool their assets and follow him on a journey for safety to the \"land of Israel\" in the United States, and soon over 800 people were living with him there.\n\nThe initial move scattered the followers and reduced Rapp's original group of 12,000 to many fewer persons. In 1804, Rapp was able to secure a large tract of land in Pennsylvania and started his first commune. This first commune, 'Harmonie', (Harmony), Butler County, Pennsylvania, soon grew to a population of about 800, and was highly profitable. At Harmony, the Harmony Society was formally organized on February 15, 1805, and its members contracted to hold all property in common and to submit to spiritual and material leadership by Rapp and associates. In 1807, celibacy was advocated as the preferred custom of the community in an attempt to purify themselves for the coming Millennium.\n\nIn 1814, the society sold their first town in Pennsylvania to Mennonites for 10 times the amount originally paid for the land, and the entire commune moved out west to Indiana where their new town was also known as Harmony. Ten years after the move to Indiana the commune moved again, this time it returned to Pennsylvania and named their town 'Ökonomie', Economy. The Indiana settlement was sold to Robert Owen, at which point it was renamed New Harmony, Indiana.\n\nGeorge Rapp lived out his remaining days in the town of Economy, Pennsylvania, until August 7, 1847, when he died at the age of 89.\n\nJohann Georg Rapp was born on November 1, 1757, to Rosine Berger and Hans Adam Rapp (1720–71) in the village of Iptingen, northwest of Stuttgart in the Duchy of Württemberg. Rapp was the second child an oldest son of the family. His brother, Adam (born on March 9, 1762), and three sisters, Marie Dorothea (born October 11, 1756), Elise Dorothea (born August 7, 1760), and Maria Barbara (born October 21, 1765) later followed him to America; however, Adam died at sea. \n\nRapp learned the art of wine making from his father, a farmer. After his father's death in 1771, Rapp trained as a journeyman weaver. He also developed an interest in preaching. Vineyards and textiles would become a part of the agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial economy in all three of the Harmonite towns that were later founded in the United States.\n\nOn February 4, 1783, Rapp married Christine Benzinger of Fiolzheim. The couple had two children, a son, Johannes (December 22, 1783 – 1812), and a daughter, Rosine (February 10, 1786 – 1849). Johannes, who trained as a surveyor, died at the age of twenty-nine in an industrial accident. Johannes's name is the only one listed on a stone in the Harmonist cemetery in Harmony, Pennsylvania. (The Harmonists did not mark their graves.) The marker was donated by non-Harmonists and the Society accepted it reluctantly. The specific location of Johannes's gravesite within the cemetery is unknown. Johannes's daughter, Gertrude (1808–89), later became a minor American celebrity and organized the Society's silk production at Economy, Pennsylvania. George Rapp later adopted Frederick Reichert (April 12, 1775 – June 24, 1834). \n\nFrederick Reichert, Rapp’s adopted son, organized the relocation of Rapp's followers from Württemberg to Pennsylvania in 1804 and supervised the immigration of other Rappites to the United States. Reichert, who became known as Frederick Rapp, was the business leader and public spokesman for the Harmony Society, drew up the town plan for its new village at New Harmony, Indiana, in 1814, and served as one of the delegates to the Indiana Territory's Constitutional Convention in 1816. Frederick Rapp also helped choose the site for the permanent seat of government of Indiana in 1820 that was later named Indianapolis and held leadership roles in several Indiana banks. After the Harmonists sold their Indiana land in 1824, he relocated with other members of the Society to Economy, Pennsylvania, where he died in 1834.\n\nGeorge Rapp was tall, blue eyed, broad shouldered, with long hair and a patriarch's beard. He had a powerful voice, which matched his commanding presence.\n\nRapp and his followers, the Harmonites, believed Christ would return in their lifetime. The purpose of the community was to be worthy of Christ and prepare for his return. They were nonviolent pacifists, refused to serve in the military, and tried to live by George Rapp's philosophy and literal interpretations of the New Testament. After leaving Germany and coming to the United States, they first settled in (and built) the town of Harmony, Pennsylvania in 1804, and established the Harmony Society in 1805 as a religious commune. In 1807, celibacy was advocated as the preferred custom of the community in an attempt to purify themselves for the coming Millennium. Rapp believed that the events and wars going on in the world at the time were a confirmation of his views regarding the imminent Second Coming of Christ, and he also viewed Napoleon as the Antichrist. Rapp produced a book with his ideas and philosophy, \"Thoughts on the Destiny of Man\", published in German in 1824 and in English a year later.\nThe Harmonites were Millennialists, in that they believed Jesus Christ was coming to earth in their lifetime to help usher in a thousand-year kingdom of peace on earth. This is perhaps why they believed that people should try to make themselves \"pure\" and \"perfect\", and share things with others while willingly living in communal \"harmony\" (Acts 4:32-37) and practicing celibacy. They believed that the old ways of life on earth were coming to an end, and that a new perfect kingdom on earth was about to be realized. They practiced socialism within their community, but traded their exotic agricultural goods, including lemons and figs grown in movable greenhouses, with others.\n\nRapp and his group also practiced forms of Esoteric Christianity, Mysticism (Christian mysticism), and Rapp often spoke of the virgin spirit or Goddess named Sophia in his writings. Rapp was very influenced by the writings of Jakob Böhme, Philipp Jakob Spener, and Emanuel Swedenborg, among others. Also, in Economy, Pennsylvania, there are glass bottles and literature that seems to indicate that the group was interested in (and practiced) alchemy. Some other books that were found in the Harmony Society's library in Old Economy, Pennsylvania, include those by the following authors: Christoph Schütz, Gottfried Arnold, Justinus Kerner, Thomas Bromley, Jane Leade, Johann Scheible (\"Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses\"), Paracelsus, and Georg von Welling (\"Opus Mago-Cabalisticum\"), among others.\n\nThe Harmonites tended to view unmarried celibate life as morally superior to marriage, based on Rapp's belief that God had originally created Adam as a dual being having male and female sexual organs. According to this view, when the female portion of Adam separated to form Eve, disharmony followed, but one could attempt to regain harmony through celibacy.\n\nGeorge Rapp's life was not without controversy and problems. Rapp and the Harmony Society were involved in protracted legal cases: many relating to the monetary claims by former Society members who did not feel properly compensated for their time and labor, other cases concerned the ownership and sale of property Society members left in Württemberg, and legal complications from fines and payments made to avoid militia service. Rapp was called a tyrant and Society members his slaves. During elections, the Society was seen as a monolithic voting block which caused political ill feelings and generated animosity against Rapp. He was accused of killing his son Johannes – who died in an industrial accident. Rapp predicted that on September 15, 1829, the three and one half years of the Sun Woman would end and Christ would begin his reign on earth. Dissension grew when Rapp's predictions went unfulfilled. Perhaps his greatest error was in 1831 when he accepted Bernhard Müller, who called himself Maximilian Count de Leon, the \"Lion of Judah\" as the man who would unite all true Christians. In the year that followed Rapp changed his mind, but one third of the Society members separated and joined with Müller in establishing a separate community, the New Philadelphian Congregation. After Rapp's death in 1847, a number of members left the group because of disappointment and disillusionment over the fact that his prophecies regarding the return of Jesus Christ in his lifetime were not fulfilled. His last words to his followers were, \"If I did not so fully believe, that the Lord has designated me to place our society before His presence in the land of Canaan, I would consider this my last\".\n\nThe Harmonite commune ultimately failed because the policy of celibacy prevented new members from within, and the majority of the outside world had no desire to give up so much to live in a commune. The society was formally dissolved in 1906.\n\n\n\nBooks and articles in German:\n\n\n"}

Its location is in Triangle, Virginia, adjacent to the Marine Corps Base Quantico. The park is the largest protected natural area in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region at over . Today, the park is a window into the past and serves as an example of what much of the East Coast once looked like centuries ago.\n\nThe park serves as the largest example of Eastern Piedmont forest in the National Park System (arguably, one of the most heavily altered ecosystems in North America). The park also protects the Quantico Creek watershed. It is a sanctuary for numerous native plant and animal species.\n\nPrince William Forest Park was erected where once the town of Batestown stood. It was an enclave for freed slaves named for Mary Bates, the matriarch of the community.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1937, the Federal Government began implementing a Resettlement Administration program to form Chopawamsic Recreational Demonstration Area, where rural farmers were supposed to relocate for more fertile land. The RA bought 79 pieces of property in both Hickory Ridge and Batestown and condemned another 48, to form a new recreation area. However, the RA often made no effort to actually resettle the displaced residents.\n\nThe area residents resisted the relocation efforts, sometimes retreating into the park boundaries to escape detection. This continued until the beginning of World War II, where the park was taken over by the Office of Strategic Services as a spy training ground. The park was surrounded by barbed wire and fences, and patrolled by dogs and armed guards. All remaining forty-four holdouts were evicted, some literally carried away screaming.\n\nAt the end of the war, the displaced residents hoped their land would be restored, but to date these families have received no compensation. Instead, the property was turned over to the National Park Service and renamed Prince William Forest Park.\n\nA variety of recreational opportunities are available, which include:\n\n\nThe park’s cultural resources are also varied. They include:\n\n\nTortoises such as the Eastern box turtle can be found in Prince William Forest Park, especially after a light rain. There are a number of Amphibians that inhabit the park. Toads and frogs, such as the American toad, American bullfrogs, and Cope's gray tree frog can be spotted in the park, as can salamanders such as the marbled salamander and the eastern red-backed salamander. A variety of bird species, such as the hooded warbler, the wood thrush, and the red-shouldered hawk, can also be found. The park is also home to mammalian species such as red fox, beaver, white-tailed deer, black bear, and coyote. They are spotted along the upper North Valley Trail. A few black rat snakes have been seen in and around logs and brush areas. Various skinks can be seen around sunny areas of the trails.\n\nThe park was developed by Works Progress Administration workers after the Great Depression. Landscaping and structures were designed by National Park Service architects. Four camp areas are listed individually on the National Register of Historic Places:\n\nThe park also includes the Cabin Branch Pyrite Mine Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The park itself was designed as the Prince William Forest Park Historic District in 2012.\n\n\n"}

Its origins lie in the early 18th century, when it was appointed solicitor to the Bank of England, which it continues to advise today.\n\nFreshfields Bruckhaus Deringer is a member of the Magic Circle of elite British law firms, the oldest firm within the Magic Circle, and the oldest international law firm in the world.\n\nFreshfields Bruckhaus Deringer was created in 2000 when U.K.-based Freshfields merged with the two law firms, Germany-based Deringer, Tessin, Herrmann, & Sedemund and Germany-Austria-based Bruckhaus, Westrick, Heller, Löber.\n\nThe firm has 27 offices in 17 jurisdictions across Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America. It advises national and multinational corporations, financial institutions and governments.\n\nSince 2017, German prosecutors have twice raided Freshfields’ Frankfurt offices as they investigate the phantom trading fraud that Germany estimates cost it more than 5 billion euros, also known as cum ex fraud. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer gave tax advice which was used to justify its legality and in November 2019, Ulf Johannemann, a former Freshfield lawyer was imprisoned.\n\nFreshfields' origins arguably go back to c.1716, when Thomas Woodford began to practise law. Woodford was succeeded in his practice in 1730 by William Wall, who was succeeded in turn in 1743 by Samuel Dodd. In that same year, Dodd was appointed attorney to the Bank of England. Freshfields (in the firm's various incarnations) have been the bank's legal advisers ever since. Dodd's appointment is treated by Freshfields as the firm's foundation date.\n\nThe firm changed its name on numerous occasions as different partners joined or left. In 1801 James William Freshfield (1775–1864) was the first member of the Freshfield family to become a partner, and the firm became known as Winter, Kaye, Beckwith & Freshfield. Following further name changes, it became Freshfield & Son in 1825, and eventually Freshfields 1868–76, Freshfields & Williams 1876–98, Freshfields 1899–1918, Freshfields & Leese 1918–1921, Freshfields, Leese & Munns 1921–1945, and Freshfields 1946–2000. The last member of the Freshfield family to be a partner, another James William Freshfield, retired in 1927.\n\nBruckhaus Westrick Heller Löber traces its origins to Hamburg in 1840. At the time of its 2000 merger with Freshfields it was one of the two largest law firms in Germany. \n\nDeringer Tessin Herrmann & Sedemund was founded in 1962 by Arved Deringer and Claus Tessin and was based in Cologne from 1970 -2000.\n\nThe first James William Freshfield (1775–1864) adopted the crest of John Freshfield of Norwich as his own, having seen it as a boy. It was subsequently used as the firm's emblem. It represents St Michael, depicted as an angel with a spear.\n\n"}
{"id": "2323685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323685", "title": "Batenburgers", "text": "Batenburgers\n\nThe Batenburgers were members of a radical Anabaptist sect led by Jan van Batenburg, that flourished briefly in the 1530s in the Netherlands, in the aftermath of the Münster Rebellion. They were called Zwaardgeesten (sword-minded) by the nonviolent mainstream Anabaptists.\n\nJan van Batenburg was born around 1495, the illegitimate son of nobleman Dirk van Batenburg from Gelderland, and became mayor of a town in the Oversticht, present-day Dutch province of Overijssel. The Oversticht was occupied by the duke of Gelderland and was conquered by the Habsburgers. At some point in time—it is unknown when or why—he fell out with the local Habsburg-Burgundian authorities, was exiled, and lost his property. Van Batenburg thenceforth regarded the Holy Roman Emperor as his mortal enemy.\n\nDuring the early 1530s, Van Batenburg converted to Anabaptism and found himself the leader of a large number of his co-religionists in Friesland and Groningen. His sympathies originally lay with the revolutionary Anabaptists who held Münster during the Münster Rebellion, but between Easter and Pentecost 1535, the Batenburgers from Groningen urged him to declare himself as 'a new David'. Before long Van Batenburg had established a new and completely independent sect, which quickly became the most extreme of all the early Anabaptist movements.\n\nIn August 1536, the leaders of the various Anabaptist groups met in Bocholt in a final attempt to maintain the unity of Anabaptism. At this meeting the major areas of dispute between the sects were polygamous marriage and the use of force against non-believers. David Joris tried to compromise by declaring the time had not yet come to fight against the authorities, and that it would be unwise to kill any 'infidel' (non-Anabaptists), lest the Anabaptists themselves be seen as common thieves and killers. Accounts of the outcome of the meeting differ; however, Joris and his followers subsequently split from the other Anabaptist groupings.\n\nVan Batenburg, correctly suspecting that his fervent belief in both polygamy and the use of force would be condemned by other Anabaptist leaders, had stayed away from the conference at Bocholt, although he had sent representatives. He was disgusted by Joris' propositions, called him 'the son of a whore' and threatened to kill him. The rivalry between the two Anabaptist leaders would last until Van Batenburg's death.\n\nComparatively little is known of Van Batenburg's theology. The Batenburgers believed that every man, and everything on earth, was owned, in a literal sense, by God. They also believed that they were God's chosen children. It followed, in their theology, that everything on earth was theirs to do with as they pleased. There was nothing wrong in making a living by robbing 'infidels', by which they meant any man who was not a member of their sect; indeed killing infidels was pleasing to their God. Those who joined the sect after 1535 — when the Münsterite leadership had declared the door to salvation to be closed—could never be baptised, they thought, but these men and women would nevertheless survive the coming apocalypse and be reborn in the coming Kingdom of God as servants of the Anabaptist elite. The Batenburgers also shared the views of the radical Münsterites on polygamy and property; all women, and all goods, were held in common. A few Batenburger marriages did occur, and Van Batenburg himself retained the right to present a deserving member of his sect with a 'wife' from the group's general stock of women. But such unions could be ended just as readily, and on occasion the prophet did order an unwilling wife to return to servicing the remainder of the Batenburger men.\n\nJan Van Batenburg seems to have commanded the loyalty of at least several hundred men. Members of his sect were required to swear oaths of absolute secrecy, however, and had to endure a painful initiation designed to ensure they would be able to resist torture if they were ever captured, so the true extent of his following never emerged. The Batenburgers did not gather openly in public, and had their leader's dispensation to pose as ordinary Lutherans or Catholics, going to church and living apparently normal lives in the lands along the borders of the Holy Roman Empire and the Netherlands for several years after the fall of Münster. They recognised one another by secret symbols displayed on their houses or their clothing, and by certain ways of styling their hair. It was only after Van Batenburg himself was captured and burned at the stake, at Vilvoorde, Brabant, in 1538, that they came together at last, transforming themselves into a robber-band and infesting the Imperial marches for at least another decade under the leadership of a Leyden weaver called Cornelis Appelman. By this point the group had been reduced to a core of no more than 200 men, most of whom were joined by bonds of family or marriage.\n\nAppelman remained active until his own capture in 1545. He was considered more extreme than Van Batenburg, giving himself the title of 'The Judge' and killing any of his followers who refused to join his criminal activities, or proved themselves lax in killing, robbing or committing arson. Like Van Batenburg, he preached and practised polygamy, with the additional refinement that the women of his sect could leave their husbands at any time should they decide to marry a man further up the Batenburger hierarchy. Appelman himself murdered his own wife when she refused him permission to marry her daughter, and subsequently killed the girl as well.\n\nAfter The Judge's death, the Batenburger sect fragmented into several tiny groups, one of which, the Children of Emlichheim, was active in the middle 1550s. Its sole creed appears to have been revenge against the infidel; on one notorious occasion its members stabbed to death 125 cows that belonged to a local monastery. The last of the Batenburger splinter groups, and also the largest, was the 'Folk of Johan Willemsz'. This sect persisted until about 1580, living by robbery and murder in the countryside around Wesel. When Willemsz himself was burned at the stake, the remnants of the group fled west. A remnant is believed to have found their way to Friesland, where they hid themselves among the local Mennonite community and were eventually absorbed into it.\n\n\n\n"}

Downs and William Miller. The Cary 14 UV-Vis-NIR and the Cary Model 81 Raman Spectrophotometer were particularly important contributions in scientific instrumentation and spectroscopy. Before starting Applied Physics, Cary was employed by Beckman Instruments, where he worked on the design of several instruments including the ubiquitous DU spectrophotometer. Howard Cary was a founder and the first president of the Optical Society of Southern California.\n\nHenry Howard Cary was born on 3 May 1908 in Los Angeles, California to Henry Gardner Cary and Bessie (Brown) Cary.\n\nThe 1940 US Census listed Cary as married to Barbara (Ward) Cary from Washington state. His occupation was recorded as research engineer and industry as laboratory.\nIn 1991, Cary died of pneumonia after a long illness at Orange, California.\n\nIn 1925, after graduating from Los Angeles High School, Cary entered the California Institute of Technology. He missed one year due to illness, and graduated in 1930 with a B.S. degree in civil engineering. In sports, he was captain of the varsity tennis squad. During his first year he won the junior travel prize. Cary was a member of Sigma Xi.\n\nAfter receiving his degree, Cary went to work in his father's plumbing construction business, H. G. Cary Co. He held a variety of engineering and accounting positions with the company during the early years of the Great Depression.\n\nAs of May 31, 1935, Cary was hired by Arnold Beckman of National Technical Laboratories (NTL) (later Beckman Instruments). By 1937, Cary was the chief design engineer on Beckman's research team. Cary distinguished himself in work relating to pH meters and glass electrodes, and became vice-president of development. By 1940 Cary and Beckman were developing a quartz spectrophotometer. They presented a paper on this work in July 1941 at MIT's Summer Conference on Spectroscopy. Cary made substantial contributions, including the design of a reliable ultraviolet phototube for the instrument. The DU spectrophotometer was the first easy-to-use single instrument containing both the optical and electronic components needed for ultraviolet-absorption spectrophotometry.\n\nDuring World War II, National Technical Laboratories worked on a number of then-secret projects, including one for the development of synthetic rubber. The Office of Rubber Reserve of the United States government contracted with NTL to produce an infrared spectrophotometer based on a single-beam design by Robert Brattain of Shell Development Company. The first Beckman IR-1 Spectrophotometer was shipped to Shell on September 18, 1942 barely six months after it was ordered. The IR-1 used a Littrow prism mounting featuring a single rock salt prism with a mirrored back, and an analog galvanometer for presenting results.\n\nCary and Beckman adapted features from the pH meter and the DU spectrophotometer to improve the design of the IR-1 spectrophotometer.\nBy 1945, the IR-2 spectrophotometer was in production, using an electronic vacuum tube amplifier instead of a galvanometer, and a thermocouple tube for the detection of infrared light.\n\nIn January 1946, Cary left NTL to form his own company, Applied Physics Corporation (later known as Cary Instruments) in Pasadena, California, with George W. Downs, William Miller, and Russell E. Vaniman. Cary and his company developed a range of scientific instruments, particularly dual-beam spectrophotometers. The Applied Physics Corporation made its first delivery, a Cary 11 UV-Vis spectrophotometer, to Mellon Institute in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in April 1947. The Cary 11 was followed by the Cary 14 UV-Vis-NIR in 1954, the Cary 15 UV-Vis in 1961, the Cary 16 UV-Vis in 1964, and an expanded offering of instruments through the 70s, 80s, and 90s.\n\nThe Cary 14 spectrophotometer used a double folded-z-configuration monochromator. Appearing on the market in 1954, it was the first commercial UV-VIS-NIR instrument to fully extend into the near-infrared spectrum.\n\nThe Cary Model 81 Raman Spectrophotometer was an important contribution to high-performance Raman spectroscopy. Described as \"famous\" it gave the field of Raman spectrophotometry a \"tremendous boost\" in the United States.\n\nOther instruments included nondispersive infrared gas analyzers electrometers such as the Cary Model 31 and 36 Electrometers which used a vibrating reed with an ionization chamber and calorimeters such as the Cary Model 41 Calorimeter.\n\nIn 1966 the Applied Physics Corporation was one of a number of companies acquired by Varian Associates during a period of rapid expansion by Varian. Applied Physics Corporation was renamed Cary Instruments as a subsidiary of Varian. Also in 1966, groundbreaking for a new building for the company occurred in Monrovia, California. \nIn 1972 the company moved to Varian's facilities in Palo Alto, California. In 1982, it moved again, to Varian's Techtron facilities in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nIn 1959, Cary was the recipient of the American Chemical Society Division of Analytical Chemistry's Award in Chemical Instrumentation. Robert Brattain described Cary's approach to instrument design, when giving the award.\n\nIn 1969, Cary was awarded the David Richardson Medal by the Optical Society of America. Cary was honored for: \"his painstakingly careful and very valuable contributions to the design and production of highly precise instrumentation in areas which range from spectroscopy to chemical, medical and nuclear research.\"\n\nIn 1977, Howard Cary received the Maurice F. Hasler Award at Pittcon \"for his pioneering leadership in the development of instrumentation for absorption and Raman spectroscopy\".\n\nCary is listed on a considerable number of patents for his work at National Technical Laboratories and Cary Instruments, often as \"Henry H. Cary\" or \"H. H. Cary\". They include: \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2323708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323708", "title": "Push It (Garbage song)", "text": "Push It (Garbage song)\n\n\"Push It\" is a song by alternative rock band Garbage from their second studio album, \"Version 2.0\" (1998). It was released on April 20, 1998 as the album's lead single. Lead singer Shirley Manson elaborated on the song's dreamy verse structure versus the confrontational chorus: \"[It's about] the schizophrenia that exists when you try to reconcile your desires and demons with the need to fit in. It's a song of reassurance\". The track contains a musical quotation of the Beach Boys' 1964 song \"Don't Worry Baby\".\n\nThe music video for \"Push It\" received thirteen nominations between the MTV Video Music Awards, MTV Europe Music Awards, and the MVPA Music Video Awards. \"Push It\" was also nominated as Best Alternative Records at Miami's Winter Music Conference. In 2007, \"Push It\" was remixed for Garbage's greatest hits album \"Absolute Garbage\"; some elements were made more noticeable, while some elements were reduced or edited out. A rock version was also serviced to UK radio stations to promote the compilation.\n\nGarbage began writing for their second album at the start of March 1997 at a vacation house in Friday Harbor, Washington. There, the group demoed and made rough outlines for new songs over a three-week period. When they that felt they had made a good start, they relocated to their Madison, Wisconsin, base at Smart Studios and began fleshing out the ideas and rough sketches that were made over the rest of the year. The group recorded all of the material for the second album through a 48-track digital system direct to hard drives utilizing a 24-bit Pro Tools rig. Vocalist Shirley Manson wrote the majority of her lyrics while ensconced in a hotel near the studio. Garbage completed recording, producing and mixing of their second album in mid-February 1998, and the album was given the title \"Version 2.0\".\n\nDuring a vocal tracking session in which Manson was singing over music already written for \"Push It\", the band felt that one of the lines in \"Push It\" would benefit from having a vocal chorus answering the words back to her. Inspired by Manson's spontaneous ad-lib of the phrase \"don't worry baby\" over the music, guitarist Steve Marker sampled the Beach Boys song \"Don't Worry Baby\" and used it as a backing vocal. The sample didn't work with what the band had already recorded so Manson re-sang the lines to fit the key and tempo of the song. Aware of the potential for incurring copyright legalities, the band debated whether or not to keep the line. Garbage and Brian Wilson coincidentally shared the same publishing company (Irving Music), and figuring that they had nothing to lose, contacted him through their company representative, sent him a copy of \"Push It\", and asked him for permission to use the interpolation. Wilson gave his blessing, and reportedly kept the tape. Both Wilson and Roger Christian, the deceased co-writer of \"Don't Worry Baby\", received a writing credit. A simpler interpolation credit was given to Herbie Azor, as the band's lawyers felt that there was a possible similarity of the line \"Push it!\" to his own \"Push It\", which had been a hit single for New York hip hop trio Salt-N-Pepa.\n\nAt the end of the middle 8, Garbage had originally recorded a drum fill to lead back into the final chorus, but decided to develop a suspenseful bridge back into the final part. The band used a number of pitch-shifting and time-stretching plugins and matched them with an orchestral swell in an ascending chromatic scale sampled from a classical music album. The new part had been influenced by The Beatles \"A Day in the Life\", and the group decided to keep it when Manson encouraged them to.\n\nThe \"Version 2.0\" album campaign officially began on March 16, 1998 when \"Push It\" debuted on European radio. In the United Kingdom, the song was A-listed at Radio One, Virgin, XFM, GLR and playlisted at a further sixty-two regional radio stations; with such support \"Push It\" subsequently reached #20 on the airplay chart. Mushroom Records issued \"Push It\" commercially on April 27 on CD and cassette single; both contained a brand new Garbage track, \"Lick the Pavement\", on the b-side, while the CD format also included a remix by Japanese band Boom Boom Satellites. A collectable 3\"CD Blisterpack was also issued, backed with a cover version of Big Star's \"Thirteen\". At the end of its first week on sale \"Push It\" debuted at #9 on the UK Singles Chart becoming the band's third Top Ten hit single. Two weeks later, \"Version 2.0\" launched with sales of 32,000 units and debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart. \"Push It\" remained on the UK top seventy-five for five weeks.\n\nMushroom's European distributor, BMG, released \"Push It\" across the continent on April 20, 1998 in two CD formats; a four-track maxi single collecting together both b-sides and the Boom Boom Satellites remix, and a two-track card sleeved single backed with \"Lick the Pavement\". In France, \"Push It\" charted for a single week at #99. In the Netherlands it debuted at #98 and peaked the following week at #77, while in Germany, the single peaked at #88. Some of the higher European chart positions came from Iceland, where \"Push It\" reached #2 after five weeks, Ireland where it reached #26, Finland where it peaked at #14, and in Spain, where the single was released by RCA, \"Push It\" debuted at #5. The single spent a second week at that peak, before dropping out of the Spanish top ten at the start of June. The song also peaked at #20 on the Spanish airplay chart. \"Push It\" was a success at radio across Europe, reaching #15 on the airplay charts. This set up \"Version 2.0\" for a strong first week of continental sales; the album debuted at the top in France, Belgium and also at #1 on the European Top 100 Albums chart.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, \"Push It\" was released by White Records on April 20, 1998 on two CDs, in the same combination as Europe had received. At the end of the month, \"Push It\" debuted on the ARIA Charts at #31 where it stayed for a second week before dropping out of the chart on its seventh week. At the same time, \"Push It\" debuted on the RIANZ Charts at #16, and climbed seven days later to peak at #15. It ultimately spent six weeks on the charts. The top forty success of the single set up the May release of \"Version 2.0\"; the album debuted at #5 in Australia and at #1 in New Zealand. White also licensed out commercial singles of \"Push It\" internationally for release in South Africa and Venezuela.\n\nIn North America, Almo Sounds serviced \"Push It\" to alternative radio on March 30, 1998. Several radio stations jumped the add date for \"Push It\", even though Almo served cease and desist orders. Almo's campaign for \"Push It\" centered around breaking the single at alternative radio, as the format had strongly supported the band before. The label weren't too concerned whether or not \"Push It\" would crossover into Top 40 radio as they had confidence in the album's follow-up singles. In its first week, \"Push It\" became the #1 Most Added record on the alternative format and debuted in mid-April as the highest new entry on Modern Rock at #25. The same week \"Push It\" debuted at #72 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. The following chart saw \"Push It\" rocket into the Modern Rock top ten at #8 with an \"Airpower\" status (meaning the song had registered over 900 detections for the first time). Almo released a limited edition pressing of \"Push It\" on CD to record stores in both the States and Canada on April 21. At the end of that week, the physical release debuted at #63 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart and at #52 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song also reached an airplay peak of #56 as it rose to #5 on the Modern Rock chart. At alternative, \"Push It\" remained at that position for the rest of May; parent album \"Version 2.0\" impacted retail on May 12 and debuted at #13, shifting 88,000 copies in its first seven-day period.\n\n\"Push It\" eventually proved to have long legs at radio, staying in the Modern Rock top ten and hovering around the mid-50s on the Hot 100 until the second week of July. By this time, second single \"I Think I'm Paranoid\" had debuted on the Modern Rock chart. Almo serviced remixes of \"Push It\" by New York City producer Victor Calderone to DJs; the song debuted on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in mid-July at #44. \"Push It\" rose to #5 by the end of August. Capitalizing on the song's gain in popularity in nightclubs, the label commercially issued a double A-side 12\" vinyl of Calderone remixes of \"Push It\" backed with mixes of \"I Think I'm Paranoid\" by The Crystal Method, on October 20. In total, \"Push It\" clocked up eighteen weeks on the Hot 100 (exiting at the start of September), twenty-one weeks on the Modern Rock charts (leaving a week earlier) and thirteen weeks on the Dance charts (at the start of October).\n\nIn late 1999, the song was featured in the intro video of EA Sports' PlayStation/PC ice hockey video game \"NHL 2000\". In 2007, Chris Sheldon remixed a rock version of \"Push It\" which was playlisted by XFM prior to the release of \"Absolute Garbage\".\n\nGarbage had been established on their first album as an act who regularly released special editions of their singles; their first six singles had each seen a specially packed 7\" vinyl format released in embossed aluminium, rubber, hologram die-cut rain-effect card, perspex, cloth and with a lenticular image mounted on ripple-effect card respectively. The band and their UK label were keen to continue using special packaging for the singles from \"Version 2.0\"; however new rules issued the previous year from UK chart compiler CIN had forbidden the chart inclusion of sales of any singles packaged elaborately. Mushroom kept in mind that they had lost money on the pressing of every single 7\" they released; Garbage were also aware of the potential trap of repeating themselves on their second album.\n\nIn 1996, while the band had been on tour in Japan, they had seen 3\" CD singles on sale in record stores. \"They were packaged in these beautiful little boxes,\" Manson recalled later, \"It was all very minimalist and absolutely beautiful, and we wanted to do something that was very beautiful and minimalist\". When Mushroom made inquiries during the design stage, they discovered that record stores refused to rack them because they were not used to stocking singles in Snap-Pack boxes. The art designer for the project, Ade Britteon, suggested packaging the discs in pre-formed plastic sealed onto a 5\" card blister, similar to how electrical batteries are displayed, so that the disc could be popped through the back of the packaging.\n\nGarbage eventually released five singles in this manner; starting with \"Push It\" and ending a year later with \"You Look So Fine\". Despite the collectable nature of the format, the fact that at the time very few European artists pressed 3\" CDs and that the vacuum-packaging cost more to produce than a standard CD single meant that Mushroom did not repeat the format for their other artists.\n\nUpon its release, \"Push It\" received a positive response from music critics and journalists. Craig Maclean of \"The Face\" wrote, \"\"Push It\" is vintage Garbage: sultry, unharried vocals from Shirley, a galloping mix of buzzsawing guitars, a mash of samples, rumbling rhythms, an elegant discordancy... it is the album-closing song The Prodigy's cover of L7's \"Fuel My Fire\" should have been: barely-controlled pop-mayhem\".\n\n The video clip for \"Push It\" was directed by Italian photographer Andrea Giacobbe for Satellite Films/Propaganda Films. The $750,000 video was shot over four days in Los Angeles at the start of March 1998.\n\nGarbage were impressed enough by Giacobbe's show reel, in particular his previous video for Death In Vegas (\"Dirt\") to assign the fledgling director the project. The band thought his storyboard treatment was bizarre. \"He chops up film and he talks about this kind of timelessness, which is kind of the same thing that we're doing musically. He doesn't want to set the video in any place or time. You will not know what era and what time this video is set in,\" Manson later explained. Giacobbe used many different film stocks to create the different styles present in the video; at various points in the narrative, the video changes from sepia tone, black and white or false-color and back.\n\nGarbage were not particularly enamoured with the first rough cut of the video, assembled before any post-production had taken place. Vig considered that the first version \"came out very flat and with not particularly flattering lighting, because almost every frame he tweaks out in the computer, so there's a lot of post-production stuff to give it that old \"Twilight Zone\" look, or Technicolor, 1970s \"Starsky and Hutch\" look. [Giacobbe] kept saying \"Don't worry, this is just the canvas I'm going to paint on.\" Vig added that the video later had single frame details \"which makes it easier to watch on repeated viewings.\" The band later described the video as \"Fellini-esque\". The first day of shooting included filming on location at a supermarket, the second day in a hospital and the third in a cemetery. One of the props on the first day, a stuffed deer mounted on wheels, broke loose and caused a minor car accident. At the hospital, Giacobbe injured himself in a fall while filming.\n\nThe \"Push It\" video was nominated for eight MTV Video Music Awards. The general awards categories were Best Group Video and Best Alternative Video, while the professional categories were Breakthrough Video and Best Direction (both nominations for Andrea Giacobbe), Best Editing (for Sylvain Connat), Best Art Direction (Virginia Lee), Best Cinematography (Max Malkin) and Best Special Effects (Sébastien Caudron). It was also up for one MTV Europe Music Award for Best Video. A year later, Garbage were the leading nominee for the MVPA Music Video Awards industry event, with six nominations shared between the videos for \"Push It\" and \"Special\". Gina Monaci and Jeff Judd won the award for Best Make-Up in a Music Video for their work on \"Push It\". \"Push It\" was also nominated for Best Styling (nomination to Jennifer Elster), Best Hair (Gina Monaci and Kevin Ryan) and Best Alternative Video (to Satellite Films).\n\nOn April 6, 1998, the \"Push It\" video premiered in the United States, where it was a MTV exclusive for the duration of the month. The video subsequently aired worldwide from May. The \"Push It\" video was first made commercially available on Garbage's 2007 greatest hits DVD compilation \"Absolute Garbage\", albeit with digital alterations obscuring the moments of partial nudity.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Billed as the West Coast's largest hands-on science center, the California Science Center is a public-private partnership between the State of California and the California Science Center Foundation. The California Natural Resources Agency oversees the California Science Center and the California African American Museum.\nFounded in 1951 as the \"California Museum of Science and Industry\", the Museum was remodeled and renamed in 1998 as the \"California Science Center\". The California Science Center hosts the California State Science Fair annually.\n\nAdmission includes access to the permanent exhibits, such as the Space Shuttle \"Endeavour\" and other prominent aircraft and spacecraft, and to various demonstrations. A separate ticket is required for the IMAX movies, most special traveling exhibitions, and special activities that include a climbing wall, motion simulator, and a high-wire bicycle.\n\nThe Center has been accredited by the American Alliance of Museums and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, and is a member of the Association of Science and Technology Centers. The museum is also an affiliate in the Smithsonian Affiliations program.\n\nThe two-story, 45,000-square-foot exhibit features display zones with live animals and aquariums about wildlife and adaptation in different ecosystems, including a river, desert, polar region, deep sea, ocean, island and urban areas, as well as the entire planet Earth.\n\nAn area with hands-on activities and exhibits that explore innovation and invention, with themes involving construction, energy and transportation.\n\nExamines the processes of life and similarities among organisms, including food, body organs like the heart and brain, senses, defenses against threats, how living things reproduce which includes a hatching chick display, DNA, and microscopic organisms.\n\n\n\n\nThe museum's history dates back to the first California State Exhibition building, which opened in Exposition Park in Los Angeles in 1912, the site of an agricultural fairground from 1872 to 1910. The brick and terra cotta building, designed by William D. Coates, Jr., state architect, and N. Ellery, state engineer, displayed agriculturally-based natural resources and industrial products from across the state, including ranching, fish and game, coal mining, gold mining, oil production, and lumbering, as well as some of the state's recreational attractions. After World War II, the building also featured exhibits about state science and technology industries.\n\nIn 1951, the exhibition became the \"California Museum of Science and Industry\". The State Exhibition building was renamed in honor of major donor and trustee Howard F. Ahmanson as the Howard F. Ahmanson Building. The hands-on interactive exhibits included themes on agriculture, transportation, electricity, energy, industries, and minerals.\n\nIn 1961, the museum opened a new science wing that featured \"\", an exhibit sponsored by IBM and designed by Charles and Ray Eames to visually demonstrate fundamental mathematical concepts. Interaction stations demonstrated different concepts including celestial mechanics, the Möbius strip, multiplication, symmetry, and projective geometry. The original exhibit closed in 1998, and is now on display at the New York Hall of Science.\n\nThe Hall of Health was added in 1968.\n\nIn preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics, the museum added new exhibits on earthquakes and economics, and a IMAX theatre. The opening and closing ceremonies for the games were held in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which is adjacent to the museum.\n\nThe California African American Museum was founded in 1981 and housed in the California Museum of Science and Industry building until 1984, when its own facility was opened adjacent to the California Aerospace Museum.\n\nIn 1994, the museum's building was damaged by the Northridge earthquake. The California Museum of Science and Industry closed in 1996 to prepare for a new facility.\n\nThe \"California Aerospace Museum\" was also opened in 1984 adjacent to and operated by the California Museum of Science and Industry to coincide with the Summer Olympics. It was also known as Aerospace Hall but also commonly known as the California Air and Space Museum/Gallery and the SKETCH Foundation Gallery, and was the first major public work of architect Frank Gehry. The museum focused on the State's history as a leader in the aviation and aerospace industries and featured a giant, hangar-like space with aircraft and space vehicles and artifacts.\n\nThe building, now known as the Air and Space Gallery, was closed in 2011. In 2012 the building was listed on the California Register of Historical Resources, but its future is unknown.\n\nIn 1988 the museum's leadership began a to develop a three-phase, 25-year master plan to transform the institution from a science museum to a science education facility. This new facility would be known as the \"California Science Center\". The original museum building closed its doors in 1996 to prepare for the new construction.\n\nThe new construction was designed by Portland, Oregon-based Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership. Changes included:\n\n\nPhase I was completed and opened in 1998, when the museum was opened and officially renamed the California Science Center.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2323718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323718", "title": "Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site", "text": "Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site\n\nSaugus Iron Works National Historic Site is a National Historic Site about 10 miles (16 kilometers) northeast of Downtown Boston in Saugus, Massachusetts. It is the site of the first integrated ironworks in North America, founded by John Winthrop the Younger and in operation between 1646 and approximately 1670. It includes the reconstructed blast furnace, forge, rolling mill, shear, slitter and a quarter-ton drop hammer.\n\nThe facility is powered by seven large waterwheels, some of which are rigged to work in tandem with huge wooden gears connecting them. It has a wharf to load the iron onto ocean-going vessels, as well as a large, restored 17th-century house.\n\nDuring the 17th century, iron was used to manufacture a number of indispensable goods, including nails, horseshoes, cookware, tools, and weapons. The production of iron required a complex manufacturing process that could only be done by an industrial enterprise. This process was not available in North America during the early years of English colonization, which meant that all iron goods had to be imported. As it took at least two months to sail to the nearest foundry, iron goods were very expensive.\n\nWinthrop believed that because the colonies had a cheap and abundant supply of raw materials, an iron works in Massachusetts could produce goods that could be sold profitably in the New England and Chesapeake Colonies as well as in England itself. In 1641, Winthrop sailed to England to get the capital he needed to fund the enterprise. The Company of Undertakers for the Iron Workes [sic] in New England was founded to finance the project. Winthrop selected a site in Braintree, Massachusetts (now part of present-day Quincy, Massachusetts) as the location of the first Iron Works. Construction began in 1644 and was completed in 1645. On October 15, 1645, Winthrop secured the Undertakers an exemption from taxes and a 21-year monopoly on iron production from the Massachusetts General Court. The Braintree Iron Works, however, was unsuccessful due to a lack of iron ore in the area and an inadequate supply of water to power the machinery.\n\nIn 1645, the Undertakers wrote to Winthrop informing him that Richard Leader, a merchant from Salehurst who was familiar with the iron making process, would replace him as manager of the Iron Works. After arriving in Massachusetts, Leader reviewed the previous site survey and looked into some other locations. He selected a location in Lynn, Massachusetts (now part of present-day Saugus) on the Saugus River. The river was navigable for shallow draft vessels and could be dammed to power machinery. The surrounding forests could be used to make charcoal. Bog ore could be mined from nearby ponds, swamps, riverbeds, and bogs. Limestone, which was normally used for flux, was not available, but through trial and error it was found that gabbro, which could be mined in nearby Nahant, would work as a flux.\n\nThe new iron works, which was called Hammersmith, began operations in 1646. It consisted of a blast furnace for producing pig iron and gray iron (the later of which was poured into molds to make firebacks, pots, pans, kettles, and skillets), a forge where pig iron was refined into wrought iron and a 500-pound hammer was used to make merchant bars, which were sold to blacksmiths for manufacture into finished products, and a rolling and slitting mill where flat stock that could be used to manufacture nails, bolts, horse shoes, wagon tires, axes, saw blades, and other implements was produced. At the time, it was one of the most technologically advanced iron works in the world. Once functioning, the Iron Works ran for thirty weeks of the year and produced one ton of cast iron a day.\n\nSkilled workers were brought over from England to ply their trade at the iron works. These emigrants did not fit in with the local Puritan society and often ran afoul of its laws. Many ironworkers were arrested for crimes such as drunkenness, adultery, gambling, fighting, cursing, not attending church, and wearing fine clothes. The less experienced local men who worked at the Iron Works met with frequent and sometimes fatal accidents. Another source of labor was indentured servants. Indentured servants typically worked at the Iron Works for three to seven years for little or no pay in exchange for their passage to Massachusetts and the provision of food, clothing, housing, and other necessities. Following the Battle of Dunbar in 1650, 60 Scottish prisoners of war were sent to the Iron Works to work as indentured servants. 35 or 37 of the 60 Scots intended for the Iron Works were employed there, while the remainder were sold for between 20 pounds and 30 pounds each to various interests in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine. The Scots mostly worked as unskilled laborers, performing tasks like chopping wood. Some learned skills such as making charcoal, blacksmithing and carpentry. Most Scots were able to gain their freedom after seven years and afterwards they remained in Massachusetts or moved to Maine, where they started families and assimilated into Puritan society.\n\nIn 1650, Leader, who had encountered difficulties with the Undertakers, left the Iron Works to go into the sawmill business. John Gifford and William Aubrey assumed management of the Iron Works, with Gifford serving as ironmaster and Aubrey doing the accounting.\n\nAlthough the Iron Works produced a respectable quantity of iron, due to the high cost of labor, financial mismanagement which may have included embezzlement, and a number of lawsuits, it seldom operated at a profit. The Iron Works closed around 1670.\n\nAfter the iron works closed, the site fell into disuse and became hidden by underbrush. In 1898, the Lynn Historical Society erected a historical marker near the site which read \"The First Iron Works. The first successful iron works in this country established here. Foundry erected in 1643. Joseph Jenckes built a forge here in 1647 and in 1652 made the dies for the first silver money coined in New England. In 1654 he made the first fire engine in America.\" Eventually, the plaque too became obscured by the underbrush and remained camouflaged until it was discovered during the restoration of the Iron Works.\nIn 1915, antiquarian Wallace Nutting purchased the Appleton-Taylor-Mansfield House, a 1680s farmhouse near the iron works site which was believed to be the former home of the ironmaster of the Saugus Iron Works. He renamed the home Broadhearth and undertook an extensive, albeit embellished, restoration of the home. Nutting used Broadhearth to showcase his collection of antiques, photographs, and reproduction furniture. In 1917 he added a blacksmith's shop to the property and hired a blacksmith to manufacture and sell reproductions of early ironwork. In 1920, Nutting, who was having financial troubles, sold the house to Boston antiques dealer Charles L. Cooney. After Cooney's death, his widow sold it to another Boston antiques dealer, Philip Rosenberg. Upon purchasing property, Rosenberg promised Louise Hawkes of the Parson Roby Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution that he would only sell the house to the DAR or the Town of Saugus. In 1938, the DAR purchased a piece of the former Iron Works property out of foreclosure for $50. In 1941, Rosenberg offered to sell the house to Saugus and the DAR, however neither could meet his asking price. Instead he reached an agreement with the Alumni Association of the Henry Ford Trade School, which intended on moving the building to Henry Ford's Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan. News of the impending move caused outrage amongst Saugus residents and preservationists who, after extensive discussions, convinced Henry Ford not to acquire the building. In exchange, Ford wanted the Alumni Association reimbursed what it spent on the property. Fundraising efforts in Saugus were disappointing, so William Sumner Appleton, President of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, proposed splitting the cost between the state, town, and the public. When it became clear that this plan would not work, Appleton created a nonprofit, called the First Iron Works Association, to purchase and maintain the property. In 1943 the First Iron Works Association (FIWA) purchased the farmhouse as well as the DAR's piece of the former Iron Works property.\n\nLouise E. du Pont Crowninshield, one of the FIWA's directors, approached Quincy Bent, a retired executive of Bethlehem Steel residing in Gloucester, Massachusetts, for money. Although Bent was unimpressed by the house, he was interested in the property's slag pile, which indicated that the site could contain the remains of an iron works. Bent eventually convinced the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) to fund the restoration of the Iron Works.\n\nIn September 1948, FIWA president J. Sanger Attwill approached archaeologist Roland W. Robbins who had discovered the site of Henry David Thoreau's cabin on Walden Pond about trying to find the site of the Iron Works. Robbins was interested in the idea of digging at a site that was over three hundred years old, the challenge of working on a site where there little information, including no plans or sketches, and the opportunity to work at what may have been the first iron-manufacturing plant in the American colonies. Robbins' excavations uncovered the major manufacturing units of the Iron Works, including the foundations of buildings, remains of the blast furnace, holding ponds, and canal, a 500-pound hammer used in the forge, and a waterwheel that powered the bellows for the blast furnace, along with its wheel pit. The wheel was saved by biologists from Harvard University, who developed a process to preserve it. In total, more than 5,000 artifacts were found. Robbins was aided by a historical researcher (Professor E. Neal Hartley of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology), metallurgic experts, specialists from Harvard University's biological laboratory and botanical museum, and a professional photographer. He also received assistance from collectors and experts, including Smithsonian curator C. Malcolm Watkins, MIT professor Herbert H. Uhlig, and Harvard professor Elso Barghoorn. Robbins abruptly left the Iron Works in 1953. Robbins departure came not long after a dispute with Bent, who wanted Robbins to give tours of the excavation site on weekends in addition to his other duties. According to archaeologist and author Donald W. Linebaugh, it was also due in part because of the decision of the FIWA to base the reconstruction of the Iron Works primarily on documentary evidence instead of archaeological evidence. Robbins also clashed with the project's architects, thinking them to be ignorant about and uninterested in archeological data.\n\nThe Boston architecture firm of Perry, Shaw & Hepburn, Kehoe & Dean, which was responsible for the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg, was hired to reconstruct the Iron Works. The reconstruction was based on archeological evidence and historical documents, as well as partially on conjecture. The Saugus Iron Works was opened on September 18, 1954, the first day of Saugus’ three-day celebration of the town's 325th anniversary. Benjamin Franklin Fairless, chairman of U.S. Steel, served as master of ceremonies at the dedication. Also in participating in the ceremony were Senator Leverett Saltonstall, Governor Christian Herter, First Iron Works Association President J. Sanger Attwill, and Inland Steel Company chairman Edward L. Ryerson.\n\nAfter it opened to the public, Saugus Iron Works operated as a private museum run by the First Iron Works Association and funded by the American Iron and Steel Institute. In 1961, the AISI announced that it would no longer pay its annual maintenance subsidy, which left the future of the site uncertain. On April 5, 1968, the Saugus Iron Works was added to the National Park Service system and renamed the Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site. The park is open seasonally, spring through fall.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2323738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323738", "title": "Def Jam Recordings", "text": "Def Jam Recordings\n\nDef Jam Recordings is an American record label focused predominantly on hip hop, pop and urban music, owned by Universal Music Group. In the UK, the label takes on the name Def Jam UK and is operated through Virgin EMI Records, while in Japan, it is known as Def Jam Japan, operating through Universal Music Japan. The label distributes releases of various record labels, including Kanye West's GOOD Music, and Listen Up Forever Records, headed by producer, Ronny J. Current artists include Justin Bieber, Logic, Big Sean, Kanye West, Nas, 2 Chainz, Teyana Taylor, YG, Dave East, Jeezy, Jeremih, Valee, Pusha T, Amir Obé, Fabolous, Desiigner and Nasty C.\n\nDef Jam was co-founded by Rick Rubin in his dormitory in Weinstein Hall at New York University and its first release was a single by his punk-rock group Hose. Russell Simmons joined Rubin shortly after they were introduced to each other, according to one story, by Vincent Gallo. Another cites DJ Jazzy Jay as their connector. Rubin has said he met Simmons on the TV show \"Graffiti Rock\" and recognized him then as \"the face of hip hop\": \"He was five years older than me, and he was already established in the music business. And I had no experience whatsoever.\" The first single released with the Def Jam Recordings logo was T La Rock & Jazzy Jay's \"It's Yours.\" The first releases with Def Jam Recordings catalog numbers were LL Cool J's \"I Need a Beat\" and the Beastie Boys' \"Rock Hard,\" both in 1984. The singles sold well, eventually leading to a distribution deal with CBS Records through Columbia Records the following year. \n\nThis created a short-lived subsidiary label called OBR Records, short for Original Black Recordings, which catered toward R&B artists—the first artist signed to that imprint was Oran \"Juice\" Jones, who enjoyed success with his hit single \"The Rain\". A few years later, Russell Simmons and Lyor Cohen started an umbrella label called Rush Associated Labels to handle Def Jam and its numerous spinoff labels. RAL became the home to Nice & Smooth and EPMD after both acts were acquired due to the folding of their former label Sleeping Bag Records. Other acts under the RAL umbrella included Redman, Onyx, Flatlinerz, Domino, Warren G and Jayo Felony. Def Jam also signed its first and only thrash metal band, Slayer, in 1986, and the band's third and fourth albums were the only two Def Jam releases to be distributed through Geffen Records under Warner Bros. Records as opposed to Columbia/CBS. As the decade drew to a close, the label signed Public Enemy, whose controversial lyrical content garnered the company both critical acclaim and disdain. Lyor Cohen became president of Def Jam/RAL in 1988, after winning a power struggle with Rubin, who would shortly thereafter leave the company to form Def American Recordings. Rubin would take Slayer with him to Def American in its initial stages.\n\nBy 1992, despite recent multi-platinum selling releases from Public Enemy, and EPMD, Def Jam ran into severe financial troubles and was faced with folding. However, in 1994, PolyGram purchased Sony's 50% stake in Def Jam Recordings—subsequently bringing the label into its fold. Following PolyGram's purchase, Def Jam distributed the Violator Records-signed artist Warren G's \"Regulate... G Funk Era\" album, which went triple platinum and brought much-needed revenue to Def Jam through its distribution deal with Violator.\n\nPolyGram acquired an additional 10% in Def Jam Recordings in 1996, further strengthening its ownership of Def Jam. Shortly thereafter, Rush Associated Labels was renamed Def Jam Music Group. The label remained profitable as its veteran star LL Cool J released his successful album \"Mr. Smith\" in 1995. The label later signed Foxy Brown, whose debut album \"Ill Na Na\" became a platinum seller in 1997.\n\nIn 1998, PolyGram was purchased by Seagram and merged with the MCA family of labels, which became Universal Music Group. It then purchased the remaining interest of Def Jam Recordings from Russell Simmons for a reported $100 million. UMG merged 14+ record labels including: Def Jam, Island Records and Mercury Records to form The Island Def Jam Music Group. Despite the formation of IDJMG, the Def Jam, Mercury, and Island labels continued to operate as separate imprints underneath the bigger umbrella.\n\nLyor Cohen was appointed co-president of IDJMG, and Kevin Liles succeeded him as president of Def Jam. In 1999, IDJMG created a R&B spin-off label called Def Soul Recordings to run alongside Def Jam Recordings, which inherited many of Island Records' urban artists, including Dru Hill and its lead singer Sisqó, the Isley Brothers and Kelly Price. Def Soul also issued recordings by Musiq, Montell Jordan, Case, 112, Patti LaBelle, and Christina Milian. Island's 4th & B'way Records was also folded into Def Jam. Kevin Liles also served as President of Def Soul Records.\n\nAlso in 1999, the label began to distribute releases by Murder Inc. Records, run by former Def Jam executive Irv Gotti. Murder Inc.'s roster of artists would include Ja Rule, Ashanti, Lloyd, Vita. The following year, it launched another subsidiary, \"Def Jam South\", which focused on Southern rap and distributed releases from labels such as Disturbing tha Peace, whose artists have included Ludacris, Chingy, and Bobby Valentino. Russell Simmons tapped Texas-born and raised rap legend Scarface as the original head of Def Jam South. After about a 4-year run at Def Jam South, Scarface negotiated a release from the company in 2003.\n\nIn 2000, The Island Def Jam Music Group announced the formation of Def Jam Germany, the first international Def Jam company. This increased the label's presence around the world. Def Jam Germany signed German rappers Spezializtz and Philly MC. The label was located in Berlin and opened on May 23, 2000. In addition to signing and marketing local artists, Def Jam Germany also marketed all U.S. signed Def Jam artists in the German territory. But the German division folded just two years later in 2002. Many of the artists were picked up by Universal/Urban, while others did not get a new contract.\n\nThe second international label is a Japanese branch, , also founded in 2000. Their artist roster has included AI, Teriyaki Boyz, Nitro Microphone Underground, and South Korean boy band BTS.\n\nIn 2003, Murder Inc. became the center of a money laundering investigation involving illegal profits from drug trade, leading to the label's eventual release from its distribution contract by 2005. The final shares of Roc-A-Fella Records were sold to The Island Def Jam Music Group in 2004, by which time it had launched the career of producer-turned-rapper Kanye West.\n\nIn 2004, Cohen left IDJMG for Warner Music Group, and was replaced by former Arista and later Epic executive L.A. Reid. An unhappy Liles eventually decided to follow Cohen to Warner. A bidding war for Jay-Z's contract began, and Reid appointed Jay-Z president of Def Jam.\n\nUnder Jay-Z's leadership, Def Jam launched the successful careers of contemporary R&B singers Rihanna and Ne-Yo. At the end of 2007, Jay-Z decided not to renew his contract as the President and CEO of Def Jam in order to start his new venture, Roc Nation. Following Jay-Z's departure, L.A. Reid took over leadership of the label, as opposed to hiring a replacement. In June 2008, Shakir Stewart was appointed as Executive Vice President of Def Jam, a position that was previously left vacant since December 2007.\n\nIn March 2011, it was announced that former Warner Bros. Records executive Joie Manda would become the first president of Def Jam since Jay-Z. Until March 2013 when he exited his post at Def Jam and it was announced he'd be heading up the urban division of Interscope Records by his former boss, Barry Weiss. The-Dream served as Def Jam's executive vice president of A&R at Def Jam between 2012 and 2014. No I.D. held the position of executive vice president after helping to establish GOOD Music with Kanye West. No I.D. is now the executive vice president of Capitol Music Group.\n\nOn April 1, 2014, it was announced that Island Def Jam would no longer be active following the resignation of CEO Barry Weiss. A press release serviced by Universal Music Group stated that IDJMG, and all of its assets would be reorganized into Def Jam Recordings, Island Records and Motown Records, all as separate entities.\n\nDef Jam Recordings operates as a stand-alone label within Universal Music Group. Def Jam signed DaniLeigh to the label in early 2017. Steve Bartels served a time as President/CEO of Def Jam Recording until it was announced on August 3, 2017 that as of January 2018, Eminem's longtime manager and co-founder of Shady Records, Paul Rosenberg has been appointed Chairman/CEO of Def Jam Recordings. On February 21st, 2020, Paul Rosenberg stepped down on his position as CEO of Def Jam.\n\n\n"}

In his country, he represented both Benfica and Sporting CP, amassing Primeira Liga totals of 227 matches and nine goals and winning the 2005 national championship with the former. He also spent two and a half seasons in Spain, with Valencia.\n\nInternationally, Pereira represented Portugal at Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup.\n\nPereira was born in Lisbon. A product of local S.L. Benfica's youth system, he first appeared with its first team on 17 August 2003 in a 0–0 away draw against Boavista FC, and finished his debut season with 25 Primeira Liga appearances, mostly as a midfielder.\n\nPereira was part of the Benfica squad that won the 2005 championship, starting often, until a fallout with coach Ronald Koeman relegated him to the bench and later to the B-side. He was sold to Gil Vicente F.C. – also in the top flight – in the summer of 2006, after a previous loan to the same club.\n\nIn 2007–08, fully reconverted into a right back, Pereira joined S.C. Braga, as another player in the position, Luís Filipe, went the other way.\n\nAn undisputed starter from the beginning, he scored his first goal for the Minho side on 22 February 2009, a 2–1 last-minute winner at Associação Naval 1º de Maio. He also collected 18 yellow cards and one red in his first two seasons combined.\n\nOn 22 December 2009, Pereira moved to Sporting CP for a fee of €3 million; at the time, Braga led the league alongside Benfica with 12 points in advance to his new club, with the \"Lions\" eventually finishing fourth.\n\nPereira again featured regularly for Sporting in the 2010–11 campaign, both as a defender and a midfielder, as his team ranked in third position. On 30 April 2011, he scored in a 2–1 home win against Portimonense S.C. but was also sent off midway through the second half (after teammate André Santos) for repeatedly and severely insulting referee Duarte Gomes.\n\nOn 24 May 2012, Pereira signed with Valencia CF in Spain for €3.6 million, penning a 3+1 contract. He made his official debut on 19 August, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–1 away draw against Real Madrid.\n\nPereira was a starter in his first two years with the \"Che\" but, after the arrival of manager Nuno Espírito Santo for 2014–15, was relegated to third-choice right-back.\n\nIn the January 2015 transfer window, Pereira signed for Bundesliga club Hannover 96 until the end of the season. He made his league debut on 7 February, playing the second half of a 1–2 away loss to Hamburger SV.\n\nOn 13 July 2015, Pereira returned to Sporting on a two-year deal with a €45 million buyout clause, as a replacement for Southampton-bound Cédric Soares. He made his debut on 9 August, featuring the full 90 minutes as they beat Benfica 1–0 to lift the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira at the Estádio Algarve; 13 days later he received his third red card for the club – all direct – for conceding a penalty in a 1–1 home draw against F.C. Paços de Ferreira.\n\nIn December 2016, Pereira was coveted by Trabzonspor, who were told to pay at least €1.5 million for his signature. Early in the new year, he cancelled his contract that was due to expire in the summer and joined the Süper Lig club.\n\nPereira was first called to the Portugal senior team in October 2010, following the appointment of new coach Paulo Bento. He made his debut in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier against Denmark, and also started in the following match – in the same competition – in Iceland, with the national side winning both games 3–1.\n\nOn 19 May 2014, Pereira was named in the final 23-man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In the first game, against Germany, he committed a penalty on Mario Götze that resulted in the first goal scored by Thomas Müller, in an eventual 0–4 loss.\n\nBenfica\n\nBraga\n\nSporting\n\n"}
{"id": "2323746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323746", "title": "Cape Hatteras National Seashore", "text": "Cape Hatteras National Seashore\n\nCape Hatteras National Seashore is a United States national seashore which preserves the portion of the Outer Banks of North Carolina from Bodie Island to Ocracoke Island, stretching over , and is managed by the National Park Service. Included within this section of barrier islands along N.C. 12, but outside the national seashore boundaries, are Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge and several communities, such as Rodanthe, Buxton, and Ocracoke. Cape Hatteras is a combination of natural and cultural resources, and provides a wide variety of recreational opportunities.\n\nOnce dubbed the \"Graveyard of the Atlantic\" for its treacherous currents, shoals, and storms, Cape Hatteras has a wealth of history relating to shipwrecks, lighthouses, and the US Lifesaving Service. The islands also provide a variety of habitats and are a valuable wintering area for migrating waterfowl. The park's fishing and surfing are considered the best on the East Coast.\n\nThere are three visitor centers, each located on a barrier island. The visitor centers offer information about the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, ranger programs, and a bookstore.\n\nCape Hatteras National Seashore was authorized by Congress on August 17, 1937. The funds to purchase much of the land for Cape Hatteras National Seashore were donated by multi-millionaire philanthropist Paul Mellon. On June 29, 1940, the name of the park was changed by the U.S. Congress to \"Cape Hatteras National Seashore Recreational Area\". The name change was done to accommodate hunting interests, which at that time was a unique allowance for a National Park Service managed entity. The park was officially established as the first national seashore on January 12, 1953, and dedicated on April 24, 1958, and is currently co-managed with two other Outer Banks parks, Wright Brothers National Memorial in Kill Devil Hills and Fort Raleigh National Historic Site on Roanoke Island. It is headquartered at Fort Raleigh.\n\nIn October 2007, Defenders of Wildlife, along with the National Audubon Society, sued the National Park Service at Cape Hatteras National Seashore for not properly protecting shorebird and sea turtle species that nest on the beaches of the Park.\n\nThe Park Service was found not to be in compliance with an executive order requiring the establishment of policies and procedures regarding off-road vehicle (ORV) use on the National Seashore, failing to implement management plans to adequately protect the shorebirds and sea turtles nesting in the park. The Defenders of Wildlife have claimed that the use of ORVs on park lands has degraded the habitat used by the nesting birds, many of which are also federally protected species.\n\nMany of the beaches and beach access points were placed off limits to ORV use during the months when the birds are nesting. This became a contentious issue among some residents and users of Hatteras Island as ORV access is considered by some to be an important part of regional culture and economics, despite a 2008 study that found that only 3-4% of annual visitors to the National Seashore are ORV users.\n\nIn January 2012, the National Park Service instituted its new, and final, ORV management plan. Twenty-eight of the seashore's 67 miles are set aside as year-round ORV routes, with only 26 miles designated as year-round vehicle-free areas for pedestrians, families, and wildlife. The remaining 13 miles of seashore are seasonally open to ORVs. For instance, during the first week of July 2012, while less than 20 miles of the beaches are accessible by ORVs, an additional 31.6 miles were open to pedestrians, meaning 78% of the Seashore was open to visitors in some form. The plan also proposes new parking facilities, ORV ramps, and water shuttles to increase visitor access to beaches.\n\nAccording to the Trewartha climate classification system, Cape Hatteras National Seashore, North Carolina has a humid subtropical climate with hot and humid summers, cool winters and year-around precipitation (\"Cfak\"). Cfak climates are characterized by all months having an average mean temperature > 32.0 °F (> 0.0 °C), at least eight months with an average mean temperature ≥ 50.0 °F (≥ 10.0 °C), at least one month with an average mean temperature ≥ 71.6 °F (≥ 22.0 °C) and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. During the summer months in Cape Hatteras National Seashore, a cooling afternoon sea breeze is present on most days, but episodes of extreme heat and humidity can occur with heat index values ≥ 100 °F (≥ 38 °C). Cape Hatteras National Seashore is prone to hurricane strikes, particularly during the Atlantic hurricane season which extends from June 1 through November 30, sharply peaking from late August through September. During the winter months, episodes of cold and wind can occur with wind chill values < 15 °F (< -9 °C). The plant hardiness zone in Cape Hatteras National Seashore is 8b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 19.6 °F (-6.9 °C). The average seasonal (Dec-Mar) snowfall total is < 2 inches (< 5 cm), and the average annual peak in nor'easter activity is in February.\n\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Cape Hatteras National Seashore, North Carolina would have a dominant vegetation type of Live oak/Sea Oats Uniola paniculata (\"90\") with a dominant vegetation form of Coastal Prairie (\"20\").\n\n\n Cape Hatteras National Seashor\n\n \n"}
{"id": "2323747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2323747", "title": "Paramarines", "text": "Paramarines\n\nThe Paramarines (also known as Marine paratroopers) was a short-lived specialized combat unit of the United States Marine Corps, trained to be dropped from planes by parachute. Marine parachute training which began in New Jersey in October 1940 ended with the parachute units being disbanded at Camp Pendleton, California in February 1944. Paratroopers received a significantly increased salary after completing training, so there was no shortage of volunteers, although all were required to be unmarried. Standards of fitness were high, and 40% failed the training course.\n\nThe first cohort of Marines paratroopers trained at NAS Lakehurst in New Jersey in October 1940, eventually becoming the 1st Marine Parachute Battalion. They were followed by a second group in December 1940, forming the 2nd Marine Parachute Battalion. A third class trained at Camp Kearny in San Diego, California in early 1941, eventually forming the 3rd Marine Parachute Battalion. After the United States entered World War II, the training program was stepped up, and a special training camp and parachute training school was opened temporarily at Camp Elliott in San Diego in May 1942, next to Camp Kearny, moving to purpose-built accommodation nearby at Camp Gillespie in September 1942. A second training camp and parachute training school opened at Hadnot Point on the New River in North Carolina in June 1942, but closed in July 1943.\n\nThe Marine parachute battalion was organised into three rifle companies and a headquarters company consisting of the headquarters elements and a demolition platoon. Each rifle company consisted of three rifle platoons with each platoon equipped with rifles, light machine guns and a 60mm mortar.\n\nThe 1st Parachute Battalion was attached to the 1st Marine Division for the invasion of Guadalcanal. On 7 August 1942 the unit conducted an amphibious assault on the small island of Gavutu and later seized the neighboring island of Tanambogo with other Marine units. The battalion later moved to Guadalcanal fighting alongside the 1st Marine Raiders in the Tasimboko raid and the Battle of Edson's Ridge. The high casualties suffered by the Marine paratroopers led the battalion to be moved to Camp Kiser in Tontouta, New Caledonia in September.\n\nThe 2nd Parachute Battalion performed a diversionary raid on Choiseul Island in October 1943 and later joined the 1st and 3rd Parachute Battalion on Bougainville.\n\nThe three parachute battalions, with approximately 3,000 members, had become the 1st Marine Parachute Regiment of the I Marine Amphibious Corps. Four parachute operations were planned but never executed.\n\n\nHowever, the need for and cost of a parachute corps in the Marines was questioned, as were other specialized elite units, such as the Marine Raiders. The Marine Corps also lacked the transport aircraft required for a massed parachute drop. On 30 December 1943, Marine Commandant Thomas Holcomb ordered the 1st Marine Parachute Regiment to be disbanded, and along with the Marine Raider units, it officially ceased to exist on 29 February 1944.\n\nApart from a small group including Peter Julien Ortiz who were parachuted into France as part of an Office of Strategic Services team to support the French Resistance, the Paramarines never dropped by parachute into combat, but were utilized during beach raids in the Pacific campaign, including at Guadalcanal. Paramarines at San Diego were transferred to the 5th Marine Division which landed on Iwo Jima on February 19, 1945. Former Paramarines, Cpl. Harlon H. Block and Pfc. Ira H. Hayes, assisted in the raising of the American flag on Mount Suribachi on 23 February 1945, depicted in Joe Rosenthal's iconic photograph. A third former Paramarine, Sgt. Henry O. \"Hank\" Hansen, had participated in the first American flag-raising earlier that day. Four of the 82 Marine Medal of Honor recipients in World War II were former Paramarines who were awarded the medal for their heroic actions on Iwo Jima.\n\nMarines and sailors have continued to be trained to be paratroopers since World War II. Once a Marine has completed United States Army Airborne School, they are authorized to wear the coveted \"Jump Wings\" on their camouflage utilities while in garrison. Marines who are awarded the gold Navy & Marine Corps Parachutist Badge often do so as part of their MOS/billet training, such as MARSOC, Force Reconnaissance, Radio Reconnaissance Platoon, EOD, 3rd, 4th, and 6th ANGLICO, JTAC, Parachute rigger, or as part of a reenlistment incentive.\n\nThe only official U.S. Marine Corps sport parachute team began in January 1965 and retired in July 1965, when the same personnel became the men's US Parachute Team at the Adriatic Cup in Portoroz, Yugoslavia.\n\nTeam members were Robert Mathews, Dick Myron, Dave Becker, Tom Dougher, Ed Mikelaitis, Andre Smith, John Freitas, and Bob Armstrong. Captain Mathews was team captain, the others were NCOs. Major Wilbur Dinegar was team leader. Sergeant Jim Vance was team rigger. Daryl Henry was team coach, recommended by parachutist Jacques-André Istel.\n\nThe team was billeted at El Toro MCAS in California and jumped at Elsinore, Oceanside and El Centro, depending upon weather, having a brace of H-34s and an equipment truck at its disposal. The team represented the U.S. at the CISM games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in April, where they won the overall gold medal.\n\nThe team then disbanded, but was resurrected two months later to compete against the U.S. Army Parachute Team to determine who would represent the United States at the 1965 Adriatic Cup. The Marines won, were designated the U.S. Men’s Team, and competed at Portoroz. They made a respectable showing, although the competition was stiffer than in Rio with the Eastern Bloc teams dominating the meet.\n\nAt the end of July, the team officially disbanded and all personnel returned to their duty stations, which in many cases included postings to Vietnam.\n\n\n\n"}

In addition to London, it has offices in Beijing, Brussels and Hong Kong. It is widely regarded as one of the most prestigious law firms in the world.\n\nSlaughter and May was founded on 1 January 1889 by William Capel Slaughter and William May. The firm's first office was located at 18 Austin Friars in the City of London. In 1974, the firm opened an office in Hong Kong, being the first London law firm to establish a presence there. During the 1980s and 1990s, the firm acted on a number of privatisations in the United Kingdom, including those of British Airways, British Gas and British Steel Corporation.\n\nIn 2002, Slaughter and May moved to its current London office at One Bunhill Row. Slaughter and May closed its New York office in September 2004 and its Singapore office in October 2004. The New York office had originally primarily handled English law financing work in the Americas, a market which had been in decline through the 1990s so the firm referred its U.S. work to Wall Street firms and similarly its Southeast Asia work to the Australian firm of Allens Arthur Robinson. In December 2005, Slaughter and May agreed to cede its Paris office to the French law firm Bredin Prat. In 2009, the firm opened an office in Beijing, China, to focus mainly on M&A and outbound and inbound investment.\n\nIn comparison to the other Magic Circle firms, Slaughter and May has a minimal overseas presence, and its international practice largely relies on a network of local law firms in other countries. \n\nThese closely associated firms have included Clayton Utz, Corrs Chambers Westgarth, Gilbert + Tobin and Minter Ellison in Australia; Bell Gully in New Zealand; BonelliErede, Bredin Prat, De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek, Hengeler Mueller and Uría Menéndez in continental Europe; Shin & Kim and Kim & Chang in South Korea; and three of the Big Four law firms in Japan.\n\nSlaughter and May is one of the most prestigious law firms in the world, and had the highest number of FTSE 100 clients up to 2015, and highest profit per equity partner (PEP) of any law firm in the UK. I \nIn 2015, the firm represented 33 clients on the FTSE 100 and 44 clients on the FTSE 250, then more than any other firm, including governments, entrepreneurs, funds to leading banks, retailers, entertainment companies, industrial conglomerates and professional sports clubs.\n\nIn London, Hong Kong and Beijing, Slaughter and May's core practice areas are Mergers and Acquisitions, Corporate and Commercial, and Financing.\n\nIn Brussels, its practice areas are competition, financial regulation, data protection, as well as trade issues raised by Brexit.\n\nIn 2017/18, Slaughter and May achieved total revenues of £571.0 million and it had the highest PEP of London headquartered law firms at £2.70 million.\n\nIn March 2019, the firm represented Chambers and Partners in its sale to Inflexion.\n\nIn May 2018, Rachel Reeves a Labour Party member of the UK parliament criticized the firm for not being \"open and transparent\" over its supposed failure to include equity partners in its gender pay gap report. This criticism was in spite of the fact that gender pay gap reporting in the UK only applies to the salaries of employees, rather than the profits of the employer. As such the equity partners of the firm are not paid a salary, instead they take equal shares in the firm's equity.\n\nIn May 2018, a report by a joint inquiry of members of the UK parliament criticized the firm for billing more than £8 million for legal advice to Carillion from when its dire financial position became clear in May 2017 to its eventual collapse in January 2018. Members of parliament said that \"names such as Slaughter and May, Lazard, Morgan Stanley and EY were brandished by the board as a badge of credibility. But the appearance of prominent advisers proves nothing other than the willingness of the board to throw money at a problem and the willingness of advisory firms to accept generous fees\". The report added that \"by the end, a whole suite of advisers, including an array of law firms, were squeezing fee income out of what remained of the company. £6.4m disappeared on the last working day alone as the directors pleaded for a taxpayer bailout\". Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chaired the Commons business committee, said that after the accountancy firms \"it was Carillion’s legal advisers who took the big payouts in the company’s dying days\".\n\nHerbert Smith Freehills\n\n"}

Located on the East Coast along the Atlantic Ocean in Maryland and Virginia, Assateague Island is the largest natural barrier island ecosystem in the Middle Atlantic states region that remains predominantly unaffected by human development. Located within a three-hour drive to the east and south of Richmond, Washington, Baltimore, Wilmington, Philadelphia major metropolitan areas plus north of the several clustered smaller cities around Hampton Roads harbor of Virginia with Newport News, Hampton, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Chesapeake and Virginia Beach. The National Seashore offers a setting in which to experience a dynamic barrier island and to pursue a multitude of recreational opportunities. The stated mission of the park is to preserve and protect “unique coastal resources and the natural ecosystem conditions and processes upon which they depend, provide high-quality resource-based recreational opportunities compatible with resource protection and educate the public as to the values and significance of the area”.\n\nAssateague Island encompasses a 37-mile-long barrier island, adjacent marsh islands and waters in Maryland and Virginia, and the Assateague Island Visitor Center on the Maryland mainland. 41,346 acres of land and water are within the seashore’s boundaries. The island consists of three public areas; Assateague Island National Seashore (managed by the National Park Service), Assateague State Park (managed by the Maryland Park Service of the Department of Natural Resources) and Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge (managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service).\n\nThe park is located on a barrier island shaped by the stormy seas and gentle winds along the coast of the Delmarva Peninsula. The island is approximately long, yet never more than a mile wide. The park is divided into the Maryland District in the north and the Virginia District in the south. It is not possible to drive down the island from one district to the other. All automobile traffic must travel through the mainland to access one end of the island from the other.\n\nThe Maryland District of Assateague Island extends from the Ocean City Inlet to the Virginia state line. The Assateague Island National Seashore visitor center, campground, three nature trails, lifeguarded beach, and park headquarters and the smaller Assateague State Park sits within the borders of this district. The only access to the Maryland District is via the Verrazano Bridge on Maryland Route 611.\n\nThe Virginia District of Assateague Island extends from the Maryland state line south to the Chincoteague Inlet. This area of the island is designated as the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge and is managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). However, the National Park Service operates with a recreational beach, lifeguarded area and visitor center within a one-mile parking and visitor use section. This collaboration between the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service is defined in an agreement or Memorandum of Understanding.The Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge on the southern end of Assateague Island should not be confused with Chincoteague Island, the neighboring island to the west with a residential community on it. One must drive through Chincoteague Island in order to reach the Virginia District.\n\nAssateague Island is part of a chain of barrier islands that extend from Maine to Texas. The island is built from sand moving south via longshore drift building the island's length. The source of the sand is erosion and run-off from the Appalachian Mountains. The island is moving westward as a result of natural barrier processes during storms. Water washes over the island, sending beach sand backward toward the bay. This barrier island “rollover” is accelerated as the climate changes and the sea level rises. This condition is most pronounced at the northern end of the island, where Ocean City's jetties have stabilized the islands north of the Ocean City Inlet and have starved Assateague of new sand. As a result, Assateague's beach is shifted several hundred meters westwards compared to Ocean City's. The inlet was formed during the 1933 Chesapeake–Potomac hurricane, separating Fenwick and Assateague islands, and a jetty was immediately constructed to stabilize the inlet. After severe nor'easters in 1998, a sand replenishment program was undertaken to restore a sand supply to the north end of Assateague and to ensure a continuing supply.\n\nBefore the national seashore was created in 1965, the island was going to be turned into a private resort community called Ocean Beach, Maryland. Some 5,000 private lots comprising what is now NPS property were zoned and sold for resort development in the 1950s. However, the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962 halted the plans for development. The nor'easter destroyed the few existing structures on the island that had been built and ripped the roads apart. Realizing that the island was too unstable to build upon, the housing development firm sold all of its land to the federal government. To this day, it is not possible to drive the entire length of the island; one must travel on the mainland to journey between the National Seashore in Maryland and the National Wildlife Refuge in Virginia.\n\nSince the park's creation, several improvements have been made to aid the public in recreation. The park maintains a stretch of road on the island that travels through the state park in order for visitors to reach the National Seashore. A new visitor center was built in 2010 which is located on the mainland before visitors cross over the bridge to get to the island. The visitor center provides orientation information and exhibits for the public. Many ranger-led programs are available in the summer and fall. The park service also opened a new visitor contact station for campground operations, passes and permits on the island in 2012. The building is powered by new solar panels built in the nearby North Beach parking lot.\n\nThe park service maintains 148 campsites for both tents and recreational vehicles. On the Maryland side, campers have the option of an oceanside campsite on the west side of the main dune, or a bayside campsite on a peninsula projecting into Sinepuxent Bay. While the oceanside campsites have quick access to the beach and ocean, the bayside campsites offer better views of the wetlands, often with horses grazing there throughout the day. The park also offers six backcountry camping sites, four located on the bayside which can be accessed by canoe, kayak, or hiking, and two hike-in oceanside sites. No fresh water is available at any of the backcountry sites. The bayside sites see high populations of biting insects in summer. No camping is available on the VA portion of the Island however there are several surrounding campgrounds in the town of Chincoteague and on the mainland.\n\nExcept for the backcountry sites, reservations must be made for all campsites. Reservations can be made online or by calling 1-877-444-6777. Reservations are opened six months ahead of time and often book quickly, especially for weekends and holidays.\n\nThe national seashore has three short nature trails, each of which are under a mile long.\n\nThe marsh trail is a half-mile trail on an elevated boardwalk over the marsh. Its elevation provides relief from mosquitoes and other bugs, and it provides excellent views of the salt marsh habitat.\n\nThe forest trail is also a half-mile long, consisting of easily walkable hard pack surface and boardwalk. Much of the trail is shaded by woodlands providing relief from the heat.\n\nThe dunes trail is three-quarters of a mile long, walked entirely in the sand. The trail offers a look at many of the different plants that can be found in this habitat, as well as a section of Baltimore Boulevard, a road that existed on the island before it was destroyed in the 1962 storm.\n\nWhile visitors can swim anywhere in the ocean, the National Park Service provides a lifeguarded beach in both MD and VA. During the summer, lifeguards are on duty between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. The national seashore is also a popular destination for surfers, however, surfing is prohibited within the lifeguarded area.\n\nSaltwater fishing is a very popular activity at the national seashore. Anglers age 16 and older must possess a valid fishing license when fishing in Maryland or Virginia. Starting in 2011, all anglers must purchase a valid Maryland fishing license before going out.\n\nThe over-sand vehicle (OSV) zone is designated for four-wheel drive vehicles to drive on the beach. The Maryland OSV zone extends from the main camping area in the park to the Virginia state line where the horse fence prevents access into the national refuge. A permit and a verified list of safety equipment is required for access to the OSV zone. OSV access is limited to 145 vehicles at any time in Maryland, enforced by automatic gates, and 48 in Virginia, unless the Tom's Cove Hook is closed, in which case access is limited to 18 vehicles. OSV permits are issued for a year from the month of purchase. The permit fee ranges from $70 to $150, depending upon the type of access desired. All vehicles using the OSV zone must display a valid OSV Permit. Upon signing the registration for the OSV permit, operators accept responsibility for knowing and following all OSV regulations.\n\nThe national seashore provides habitat for a variety of plants and animals adapted to the coastline environment. The coastal salt marsh environment attracts wading birds, seabirds and mammals, as well as animals that have adapted to the harsh environment.\n\nShorebirds and wading birds are abundant at Assateague. Breeding birds include piping plovers, great egrets and red-winged blackbirds. Seabirds include brown pelicans and several species of gulls and terns. Wooded habitats shelter ruby-crowned kinglets and white-eyed vireos. During the winter the area shelters northern birds, including brant geese and northern saw-whet owls.\n\nAs a National Seashore, Assateague Island is required by federal law to protect species listed under the endangered species act. Piping Plovers, listed federally as a threatened species, fall under this category and are therefore protected on the island. During their summer breeding period, closures of the OSV zone and North end of the island often occur in order to prevent visitors from disturbing their nests or harming the newborn chicks.\n\nBands of feral horses, commonly known as Chincoteague ponies or as Assateague horses, freely roam on Assateague Island. Although local legend claims that the horses are descendants of animals that survived a shipwreck on the coast, it is more likely that the horses are descendants of domestic horses confined on the island by local residents in lieu of fencing them in on the mainland, where fences were taxed. The salty low-nutrient diet of saltmarsh grasses has resulted in the horses' short stature and bloated abdomens.\n\nTwo herds are kept separate by a fence at the Maryland-Virginia border. The horses in Virginia are owned by the Chincoteague Fire Department. These are the famous ponies that are herded every July and then swim to nearby Chincoteague Island as a fundraiser called \"Pony Penning.\" In order to ensure healthy ponies to auction off, the firefighters provide them with food, water, and vet care. The Maryland herd is treated as wildlife and are not rounded up or removed from the island, nor do they receive veterinary care. The National Park Service uses birth control to manage the herd size, injecting a vaccine known as PZP via a dart to control pregnancy and to keep the size of the herd within 80–100 horses.\n\nThough many of the horses on the island measure under 14 hands (4 ft 8 inches) in height, which would normally qualify them as ponies, most of their stock comes from horse breeds. Thus, despite their stunted height, which is attributed to their salty diet, they are considered horses and not ponies.\n\nThough the horses, especially those in the developed area, may appear tame, they have been known to bite and kick park visitors. Visitors should be wary of the horses as they are feral animals and can cause serious harm to visitors who are too close to them. Additionally, rangers may write citations for visitors who are seen petting, feeding, or simply moving within 40 feet of the horses.\n\nFees to enter Assateague Island National Seashore are charged per motor vehicle, and are reciprocal with passes from Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge in Virginia. Additionally, all forms of Federal Recreational Lands passes, including golden age, military, and access passes are accepted as long as the passholder is present in the vehicle. A full fee schedule can be found online.\n\n"}

She was elected vice-mayor in 1976 and mayor in 1986, the first woman and first African-American to hold that office. During her tenure as mayor, she received some criticism from residents due to her controversial plan to expand HUD and federally subsidized low-income housing into what was the more recently upscale sections of the city, such as Denbigh.\n\nOn August 9, 2005, the Newport News City Hall and the government buildings immediately surrounding it were rededicated the Jessie Menifield Rattley Municipal Center in her honor.\n"}

Charles Beckwith's memoirs, this counter-terrorist group was formed by U.S. Army Special Forces leadership to fill an important counter-terrorism gap until Delta Force became operational. He stated that the unit was disbanded when Delta Force went operational.\n\nBeckwith's memoir, \"Delta Force\", reports that commanders of the 5th Special Forces Group were asked by top brass of the Pentagon to quickly organize a Green Beret counter-terrorist unit to fill in until Delta Force was fully operational; Beckwith estimated it would take two years. Blue Light and Delta had a somewhat adversarial relationship for those two years. The traditional Special Forces leadership felt that they could handle counter-terrorist duties within the Special Forces community (with Blue Light). Delta existed outside of that bureaucracy, with a direct line to top US Department of Defense (DOD) brass and the President. Delta therefore represented a political threat in the minds of some Special Forces commanders. Nevertheless, Delta went on to complete its initial certification exercise in July 1978, and Blue Light was deactivated shortly thereafter. Allegedly, no Blue Light member applied to Delta nor was asked by Delta to do so. Blue Light S-2, Capt. Tim Casey, was later one of the intelligence officers assigned to JTF 1–79 which commanded the ill-fated Eagle Claw.\n\nBlue Light may have been a randomly generated code name, or may be a reference to American radar officer's slang, in which \"to bluelight\" can reportedly be used as a verb, meaning \"to detect a contact with radar,\" thus metaphorically suggesting the ability to discover the enemy's hiding place. Founding member Gary O'Neal postulated in his book, American Warrior, that Col. Montell used the name because it was the name of an undercover OSS mission in France during World War II.\n\nIn the 1990 film \"Die Hard 2\", a U.S. Army Special Forces counter-terrorist response unit, referred to as \"Blue Light\", is called in when presumed terrorists seize Washington Dulles International Airport.\n\n"}

A number of reasons were quoted as justification for the closures, including poor patronage, the excessive number of stations between Goodwood and Lynton and their proximity to each other, and the impracticability of a single-line working with so many stations and so few crossing points. The western platform was later demolished in 2007.\n\nIn August 2013, moves were made towards the reopening of Millswood station, with the Transport Department launching an investigation into the proposal. In the leadup to the 2014 State Election, the Labor State Government promised to reopen the station for a 12-month trial from 1 July 2014 if it was returned. Upgrade works at the station subsequently commenced in July 2014 at a cost of $500,000, but the initial draft timetable for the station only included every second peak-hour train not stopping at the reopened platform. The station reopened on 12 October 2014 for a 12-month trial. The trial was deemed successful, and the station was reopened permanently.\n\n"}

Joe Halpin, a former undercover narcotics detective, rewrote the script with Seagal to avoid making it a costly remake. Set in Japan, Seagal plays a CIA operative who takes down Yakuza gangsters. It was theatrically released in Japan but only went direct-to-DVD in the United States.\n\nThe assassination of Tokyo's governor Takayama causes a stir of public outrage in Tokyo, Japan. Upon hearing news of the incident, the U.S. FBI asks the CIA's Tokyo office to investigate the killing, believing it to be linked to the Yakuza, a dangerous Japanese mafia syndicate. The Japanese branch of the CIA starts sniffing around under the auspices of the United States Department of Homeland Security. Retired CIA agent Travis Hunter & his rookie FBI agent understudy Sean Mac are assigned to work on the case & to track down the perpetrators. During their work, Mac proves to be primarily a distraction to Hunter, especially as he is neither very knowledgeable about CIA procedures nor Japanese customs. Hunter, on the other hand, having been raised in Japan, has a strong understanding of the Yakuza & their mysterious, eccentric and sinister ways.\n\nHunter & Mac discover a plan by Kuroda, the boss of a new Yakuza outfit, to build an enormous drug-dealing network using his export company in cahoots with a Chinese Tong outfit leader named Chen. Kuroda is killing everyone who gets in his way. While reviewing security footage of the assassination, Hunter identifies a medallion seen around the neck of the shooter that links Kuroda to be the mastermind of the governor's assassination. As Hunter has been told that Kojima, the second-in-command of an old school Yakuza group run by elderly \"godfather\" Oyabun Ishikawa, is the only Yakuza player who is capable of defeating Kuroda, Hunter turns to him for help. When they speak, Kojima tells Hunter that the new Yakuza are now joining forces with the Tongs, which means they are becoming too powerful. Kojima says that - like Hunter - he too would love nothing more than to permanently get rid of Kuroda, adding that it will be interesting to see which one of them kills him first.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter's relentless pursuit of Kuroda increasingly endangers those associated with him. First, Kuroda has godfather Ishikawa murdered, making Kojima the new leader of Ishikawa's Yakuza outfit. Mac gets out of his depth while investigating & is also brutally murdered. But when Kuroda has Hunter's fiancée Nayako savagely slaughtered by sword, Hunter's search for Kuroda becomes devastatingly personal. Teaming up with CIA operative Jewel & tattoo artist Fudomyo-o, whose wife & young child were also killed by Kuroda, Hunter sets out to take down Kuroda.\n\nBy nightfall, Fudomyo-o & Hunter arrive at the temple Kuroda uses as his hideout. One-by-one they take on all the members of Kuroda's group with katanas. Mia Ling student to Hunter's old master & an expert sword fighter, also arrives just in time to save Fudomyo-o & then teams up with the two men. When Fudomyo-o confronts Kuroda, the latter shoots him, but only in the left shoulder, & so the former survives. Hunter then appears & ferociously battles Kuroda, ultimately killing him by slashing his chest. They then leave Kuroda's temple hideout.\n\nThe next day, Mi Ling, Fudomyo-o & Hunter hold a memorial service to offer their respects to Nayako. At the same time, a Yakuza ceremony is held to formally make Kojima the successor leader. Jewel & her CIA \"professional cleaning company crew\" arrive at Kuroda's hideout & quickly coat virtually everything with a gooey blue substance. The local authorities arrive shortly thereafter to investigate the scene, & are puzzled by what they find. Some take away the bodies of Kuroda and his henchmen for autopsy while others collect the weapons for forensic criminal investigation. Their main inspector comments that the blue goo will keep them from gathering fingerprints. In the final scene, Hunter returns to the park where he & Nayako used to go in order to grieve & remember her.\n\n\nThe original script by Trevor Miller had to be reworked, as it was too similar to \"The Yakuza\", which would have cost too much to license for a remake. The film was announced in 2003 after Franchise Pictures bought the script. Joe Halpin, who rewrote the script, is a former undercover narcotics detective who worked with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and Drug Enforcement Administration. Morrison said that the film, which was shot in Japan, was designed to feel authentically Japanese instead of merely being an American film set in Japan. Seagal had lived in Japan earlier and expressed embarrassment in the DVD commentary over how rusty he was at the use of the Japanese language.\n\nThe director said his \"experience with Steven was terrific. I was working on a project very near to his heart as it was set in Tokyo and Steven had lived there for years and speaks fluent Japanese. The only difficulties came from stretching the budget & schedule to work in Tokyo and Thailand with a multi-language speaking cast. I however am very grateful for him giving me the shot to work with him on such a personal project he wrote.\"\nSony released \"Into the Sun\" theatrically in Japan on November 26, 2005, and it grossed $164,762. In the United States, it went direct-to-video, released on February 15, 2005.\n\nBeyond Hollywood wrote that the film could have been good if it had starred someone besides Seagal, whose extensive scenes of dialogue feel like padding and do not play to his action hero strengths. Ian Jane of DVD Talk rated it 3/5 stars and, while calling it one of Seagal's better recent films, recommended it to fans of mindless action films.\n\n"}

It established the band's trademark vocal style, with Chris Difford singing an octave lower than Glenn Tilbrook.\n\nSynth-pop in style, and adjudged one of Squeeze's \"power pop hits\", \"Take Me I'm Yours\" was one of the first songs the band had written. As Difford recalled, \"[It was] written very early on in our career. I don't know a lot of songs lyrically I find that it takes a while to discover what they're about. You write them down, they're almost negatives of a photograph that need to develop and with that one, it's still developing.\" Difford later named the song one of the only tracks on the album that was representative of Squeeze.\n\nThe song has been covered several times, including a unique take by Tim Curry on his 1981 album \"Simplicity\", and more recently by Andrea Corr on her album \"Ten Feet High\". In 1998, the song was used in an American television commercial for Dockers jeans.\n\nThe track peaked at No. 19 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1978.\n\n\n"}
