{"id": "2332862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332862", "title": "Japanese carpentry", "text": "Japanese carpentry\n\nJapanese carpentry is carpentry in Japan.\n\nThough there is a core practice shared by all Japanese carpenters, defined by a vocabulary of tools and joints and a method of working, a carpenter will typically identify with one of four distinct carpentry professions. \"Miyadaiku\" 宮大工 practice the construction of Japanese shrines and temples, and are renowned for their use of elaborate wooden joints and the fact that the buildings they construct are frequently found among the world's longest surviving wooden structures. Teahouse and residential carpenters, known as \"sukiya-daiku\" 数奇屋大工, are famed for their delicate aesthetic constructions using rustic materials. Furniture makers are known as \"sashimono-shi\" 指し物師, and interior finishing carpenters, who build \"shōji\" 障子 and \"ranma\" 欄間, are termed \"tateguya\" 建具屋.\n\nThough it is rare to find a \"sashimono-shi\" or \"tateguya\" practising outside of their field, it is not uncommon for a carpentry workshop to work simultaneously as both \"miyadaiku\" and \"sukiyadaiku\".\n\nThe tools commonly used by Japanese carpenters are divided into a few basic families, within which there are found a multitude of variations and specializations geared toward particular tasks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough a carpenter will typically fashion handles and woodblocks and set and sharpen his blades himself, the blades themselves are forged by steel smiths and provided unmounted to the carpenter. Japanese steel has long enjoyed a high level of refinement, without which the fine surfaces and detail for which Japanese woodwork is renowned would not be possible. The blades used in the Japanese chisel and the Japanese plane shares similar constructive principles to the Japanese sword. A thin piece of extremely hard blade metal called \"ha-gane\" 鋼 (lit. \"edge metal\") is forge-welded to a softer piece of metal called \"ji-gane\" \"(lit. \"base metal\" 地金)\". The function of the softer base metal is to absorb shock, and to protect the more brittle \"ha-gane\" from breaking. This technology allows for the use of steels in the \"hagane\" which are harder than in use in Western chisels, typically Rockwell 62 and up, and also allows for the honing of a much finer edge than is typically known in carpentry outside Japan. When sharpening a blade, a Japanese carpenter will typically use three or more whetstones of varying coarseness, progressing from the roughest stone to the finest.\n\nThe blades of both planes and chisels are distinguished by the hollow, \"ura\" in their flat side. This hollow portion has a number of functions. The primary function is that it ensures a high degree of flatness when sharpening, in that when the flat side is polished it cannot rock or develop a curve because it is only contacting the stone on either side of its width. This then improves the precision with which cuts can be made by the chisel, and in the case of planes ensures smooth contact with the wedge and therefore even support across the full width of its blade. The hollow also greatly reduces the amount of metal needed to be removed to achieve flatness on the back of the blade, which shortens initial set-up and subsequent re-sharpening considerably. Secondly, in the case of chisels, it reduces the frictional resistance as the chisel is driven into or extracted from the wood. Thirdly, the interaction of the leading edge of the hollow with the edge of the blade is a changing relationship as the tool is re-sharpened. With plane blades, as the edge is sharpened down to the rim of the hollow, the edge can then be 'tapped-out' (\"ura-dashi\"), a process where a pointed hammer is used to depress the\" ha-gane\" downward slightly along the bevel of the blade. When the blade's back is re-flattened after \"ura-dashi\", the hollow is re-established; thus the hollow acts as a sort of gauge for sharpening as a means of prolonging the life of the thin piece of cutting steel as long as possible. This in turn tends to keep the geometry of the blade consistent over time, which keeps it fitting the \"dai\" over time.\n\nThere are many types of steel used for the \"ha-gane\" of Japanese planes and chisels:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe traditional Japanese vise was a wedge of wood tied to a post with a coil of rope. The wood was inserted under the wedge and the wedge hammered down.\n\nVises of any sort are used far less in traditional Japanese carpentry than would be the case for equivalent tasks in the traditional crafts of the West. Many tasks in Japanese carpentry associated with building, involve very large pieces of timber, and in general, the weight of the timber and of the carpenter are used to stabilize the piece on which the carpenter is working. For this reason the carpenter's horses used in Japan are much lower than their Western counterparts, and carpenters must always position themselves over their work.\nMuch of the work on smaller pieces of material can be done in the seated position, and relies on the fact that the saws and planes both cut on the pull stroke, enabling stabilization of the work using the body or shooting board.\n\nWoods used in Japanese carpentry and woodwork, as well as tool construction, include sugi (杉), akamatsu (赤松), hinoki (檜 or 桧), Camphor Laurel, Magnolia obovata, keyaki (欅) and kiri (桐).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2332880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332880", "title": "Alice Cunningham Fletcher", "text": "Alice Cunningham Fletcher\n\nAlice Cunningham Fletcher (March 15, 1838 in HavanaApril 6, 1923 in Washington, D.C.) was an American ethnologist, anthropologist, and social scientist who studied and documented American Indian culture.\n\nNot much is known about Fletcher's parents; her father was a New York lawyer and her mother was from a prominent Boston family. Her parents moved to Havana, Cuba in vain hopes of easing her father's illness with a better climate. Fletcher was born there in 1838. After her father died in 1839, the family moved to Brooklyn Heights, New York City. Fletcher was enrolled in the Brooklyn Female Academy, an exclusive school for the elite. \n\nFletcher taught school and later became a public lecturer to support herself, arguing that anthropologists and archaeologists were best at uncovering ancient history of humans. She also advocated for the education of Native Americans \"so that they could gain accoutrements of civilization.\"\n\nFletcher credited Frederic Ward Putnam for stimulating her interest in American Indian culture and began working with him at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University. She studied the remnants of the Indian civilization in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys, and became a member of the Archaeological Institute of America in 1879.\n\nFrom 1881, Fletcher was involved with the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania, where native children learned English, arithmetic, and skills designed to allow them to be integrated American citizens.\n\nIn 1881, Fletcher made an unprecedented trip to live with and study the Sioux on their reservation as a representative of the Peabody Museum. She was accompanied by Susette \"Bright Eyes\" La Flesche, an Omaha spokeswoman who had served as interpreter for Standing Bear in 1879 in his landmark civil rights trial. Also with them was Thomas Tibbles, a journalist who had helped publicize Standing Bear's cause and arranged a several-month lecture tour in the United States.\n\nThese times also marked the beginning of Fletcher's 40-year association with Francis La Flesche, Susette's half brother. They collaborated professionally and had an informal mother-son relationship. They shared a house in Washington, D.C., beginning in 1890.\n\nIn addition to her research and writing, Fletcher worked in several special appointed positions during the late nineteenth century. In 1883 she was appointed special agent by the US to allot lands to the Miwok tribes, in 1884 she prepared and sent to the World Cotton Centennial an exhibit showing the progress of civilization among the Indians of North America in the quarter-century previous, and in 1886 visited the natives of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands on a mission from the commissioner of education. In 1887 she was appointed United States special agent in the allotment of lands among the Winnebago and the Nez Perce under the Dawes Act.\n\nShe was made assistant in ethnology at the Peabody Museum in 1882, and in 1891 received the Thaw fellowship, which was created for her. Active in professional societies, she was elected president of the Anthropological Society of Washington and in 1905 as the first woman president of the American Folklore Society. She also served as vice-president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and was a longtime member of the Literary Society of Washington.\n\nWorking through the Women's National Indian Association, Fletcher introduced a system of making small loans to Indians, wherewith they might buy land and houses. She also helped secure a loan for Susan LaFlesche, an Omaha woman, to enable her studies at medical school. Graduating at the top of her class, LaFlesche became the first Native American woman doctor in the United States.\n\nLater Fletcher helped write, lobbied for and helped administer the Dawes Act of 1887, which broke up reservations and distributed communal land in allotments for individual household ownership of land parcels.\n\nIn 1888 Fletcher published \"Indian Education and Civilization\", a special report of the Bureau of Education. She was a pioneer in the study of American Indian music, a field of research inaugurated by a paper she gave in 1893 before the Chicago Anthropological Conference. In 1898 at the Congress of Musicians held in Omaha during the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, she read several essays upon the songs of the North American Indians. A number of Omaha Indians sang their native melodies. Out of this grew her \"Indian Story and Song from North America\" (1900), exploring a stage of development antecedent to that in which culture music appeared.\n\nFletcher worked with Frederic Ward Putnam in his research on Serpents Mound in Ohio and assisted in the efforts to raise funds to purchase the site in 1886. The site was donated to the Ohio Archaeological and Historical Society in 1900 and is a National Historic Landmark.\n\nIn 1930, Margaret Mead started work with the Omaha, and decided to concentrate on the modern aspects of the tribe, because of the extensive work already done by Alice Fletcher.\n\nOver her lifetime Alice Fletcher worked with and for the Omaha, Pawnee, Sioux, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Chippewa, Oto, Nez Percé, Ponca and Winnebago tribes.\n\nAlice Fletcher helped write and pass the Dawes Act of 1887. This act imposed a system of private land ownership on Indigenous tribes. This was a big difference because traditionally these tribes had communal land ownership. Individual Indigenous peoples would be allotted up to 160 acres of land. This land was tax-free and was to be held in trust by the government for a period of 25 years. At the time, she thought it would enable American Indians to assimilate to European-American ways, as their best means of survival. The government also wanted to gain \"surplus\" land for sale to other Americans. The Dawes Act was accountable for the inevitable breakup of all Indigenous reservations. By 1932 the amount of land acquired was approximately 92,000,000 of the 138,000,000 acres Indigenous groups had owned in 1887. Fletcher's land allotment work has been viewed as an error in the administration policies of Native American peoples and their land. Fletcher herself may have even realized this error because she abandoned her political policy work to focus strictly on more ethnographical work after the turn of the century.\n\nFletcher wrote about the experiences of her 1881 field trip in two journals. These journals included drawings of the plains, reservations, and many of her different campsites throughout eastern Nebraska and South Dakota. Even though many of her writings regarding the Sioux would seem rather insensible by contemporary anthropological standards, \"Her writings reflect the attitudes regarding the movement of history and social evolution prevalent in her day\".\n\nIn 1911, with Francis La Flesche, she published \"The Omaha Tribe\". It is still considered to be the definitive work on the subject. Altogether she wrote 46 monographs on ethnology. In 1908 she led in founding the School of American Archaeology in Santa Fe, New Mexico. From 1899 until 1916 Fletcher was on the editorial board of the American Anthropologist, and she also made major contributions to many issues. Fletcher was a pioneer in the study of Native American music. She became fascinated by their music and dancing so she transcribed hundreds of their songs. In 1898 she presented several essays on the subject of Native American songs at the Congress of Musicians in Omaha. From these essays eventually came her books \"Indian Story and Song from North America\" and \"The Hako: A Pawnee Ceremony\".\n\nFletcher became President of the Anthropological Society of Washington in 1903 and the first woman President of the American Folklore Society in 1905. One of her colleagues, Walter Hough, remembered Fletcher as one who, \"Mildly, peaceably, yet with great fortitude...did what she could to advance the cause of science\". Her ashes are interned in the patio wall of the New Mexico Museum of Art behind a bronze plaque with a quote from her.\n\nSome of her recordings can be found in the Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology.\n\nAlice Fletcher received numerous honors for the work she accomplished throughout her career. In 1890 she was awarded the Margaret Copley Thaw Fellowship at Harvard, which granted her funding for ethnographic and reform work. \n\n\n"}

While in Detroit he was a school friend of Paul Chambers and Donald Byrd, and also knew Tommy Flanagan, Thad Jones and Milt Jackson. After army service between 1953 and 1955 (when he played in a band with Chambers and brothers Cannonball and Nat Adderley), Fuller joined the quintet of Yusef Lateef, another Detroit musician. In 1957 the quintet moved to New York, and Fuller recorded his first sessions as a leader for Prestige Records.\n\nAlfred Lion of Blue Note Records first heard Fuller playing with Miles Davis in the late 1950s, and featured him as a sideman on record dates led by Sonny Clark (\"Dial \"S\" for Sonny\", \"Sonny's Crib\") and John Coltrane (\"Blue Train\"). Fuller led four dates for Blue Note, though one of these, an album with Slide Hampton, was not issued for many years. Other sideman appearances over the next decade included work on albums under the leadership of Bud Powell, Jimmy Smith, Wayne Shorter, Lee Morgan and Joe Henderson (a former roommate at Wayne State University in 1956).\n\nFuller was also the first trombonist to be a member of the Art Farmer-Benny Golson Jazztet, later becoming the sixth man in Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in 1961, staying with Blakey until 1965. In the early 1960s, Fuller recorded two albums as a leader for Impulse! Records, having also recorded for Savoy Records and Epic after his obligations to Blue Note had ended. In the late 1960s, he was part of Dizzy Gillespie's band that also featured Foster Elliott.

Established in 2001 as a fan-led breakaway from Enfield, the club are currently members of the and play at the Queen Elizabeth II Stadium. The club badge features the Enfield beast.\n\nThe club was founded on 23 June 2001 by the Enfield Supporters' Trust after Trust members considered that the regime in charge of Enfield no longer had the interests of the club at heart and lacked sufficient will to bring about the return of the club to its home town, having left Southbury Road in 1999. This followed the chairman of Enfield withdrawing from an outline agreement with the Supporters' Trust which would have seen the Trust take over the running of a debt-free club and receiving £100,000 from money from the sale of Southbury Road which was held in an escrow account by Enfield Council. The balance of over £600,000 would have been paid to the chairman.\n\nThe newly formed club were admitted to the Essex Senior League for the 2001–02 season, three divisions below the Isthmian League Premier Division where Enfield continued to play. The club's first season saw them finish second in the league and win the League Cup, the Capital Counties Feeder Leagues Trophy, and the Middlesex Senior Charity Cup. The following season they won the Essex Senior League, but were not promoted due to ground grading issues. Despite only finishing fourth in the 2003–04 season, in May 2004 the Isthmian League invited the club to join Division Two, but later rescinded the offer. They won the Essex Senior League for a second time in 2004–05, and were promoted to Division One East of the Southern League, which Enfield were also members of. They finished third in their first season in the Southern League, qualifying for the play-offs, where they were beaten 3–1 after extra time in the semi-finals by Wivenhoe Town.\n\nIn the summer of 2006 the club were transferred to Division One North of the Isthmian League. The 2006–07 season saw them finish third again, but they lost 4–2 to AFC Sudbury in the play-off semi-finals. At the end of the season Enfield were liquidated and Enfield Town chairman Paul Millington released a statement suggesting that the two clubs should merge and \"return the name of Enfield to the top of the non-league world\". However, the Enfield players, officials and supporters rejected the offer and formed a brand new club named Enfield 1893. Enfield Town qualified for the play-offs again in 2009–10 after finishing fourth. However, after beating Wingate & Finchley 3–2 in the semi-finals, they lost 3–1 in the final to Concord Rangers. In 2011–12 they were runners-up in the division and went on to win the play-offs with a 1–0 win over Needham Market in the final, earning promotion to the Premier Division.\n\nAt the start of the 2012–13 season the club won the Supporters Direct Cup, defeating Wrexham 3–1. They retained it the following season, beating YB SK Beveren of Belgium 8-2. In 2016–17 they finished fourth in the Isthmian League Premier Division before losing 4–2 to Dulwich Hamlet in the play-off semi-finals. The 2018–19 season saw the club win the Isthmian League's League Cup, beating AFC Hornchurch 2–0 in the final.\n\nThe club originally played at Brimsdown Rovers' Goldsdown Road ground, and were later joined by Enfield 1893. In October 2008, Enfield Council announced a deal with the club allowing the club to relocate to the Queen Elizabeth Stadium, close to Enfield's old Southbury Road ground. At the end of the 2009–10 season the club was awarded a grant of £81,504 by the Football Stadium Improvement Fund towards the first phase of works on the new ground.\n\nThey left Goldsdown Road at the end of the 2010–11 season, taking with them much of the ground's infrastructure, which resulted in Enfield 1893, who had won the Essex Senior League, not being able to take promotion to the Isthmian League as the ground no longer met the league's standards. After spending the first few months of the 2011–12 season groundsharing at the Cheshunt Stadium in Cheshunt, they moved into the Queen Elizabeth II Stadium in November 2011, with the first match being a victory against Harefield United in the Middlesex Senior Cup on 9 November. The ground was officially opened with a friendly match against Tottenham Hotspur on 16 November, a game which saw the club's record attendance of 969.\n\nThe club set up a reserve side in time for the 2006–07 season and joined the Eastern Division of the Capital League. The club's U21 team play in the Isthmian League's U21 North Division.\n\nThe club also have a women's team, who play in the FA Women's Premier League.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2332892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332892", "title": "Duffield Castle, Derbyshire", "text": "Duffield Castle, Derbyshire\n\nDuffield Castle was a Norman Castle in Duffield, Derbyshire. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.\n\nIt was on a rocky promontory facing the river, easily defended, though it is debatable whether it was inhabited in prehistoric times. It is also controversial whether the Romans maintained a military presence to protect the ford, nearby, across which the convoys of lead from Lutudarum (possibly Wirksworth) joined Rykneld Street at Derventio (now part of Derby), en route for the North Sea ports.\n\nHowever, remains that appear to be of Anglo-Saxon origin have been found, suggesting occupation by persons of some position, possibly a Saxon Thane of the name of Siward, or his relatives. Considerable amounts of Roman or Romano-British pottery have also been found, including roof tiles of Roman pattern. Some of the artefacts that were discovered were lodged with the Derby Museum, while others were kept in the Parish Room; many have disappeared.\nWhat is known, however, is that in or around 1066 Henry de Ferrers (sometimes spelt Ferrars), having rendered great service to King William, was granted estates in Derbyshire, which became known as Duffield Frith. This extended between Heage and Shottle on the North, and Tutbury on the South. He built Tutbury Castle, and made it his chief seat; but he needed an outpost to protect his lands further north, so built another castle, probably of wood, at Duffield.\n\nHis third son, Robert, distinguished himself in the Battle of the Standard against the Scots in 1138 and was made the Earl of Derby.\nHis great grandson, William, who succeeded to the position in 1162 joined the King's sons in a rebellion against their father, Henry II, and in 1173 both castles were destroyed.\n\nFollowing him was his second, William, a favourite of King John who restored his earldom along with the manors of Wirksworth, Ashbourne and, later, Horston Castle (Horsley). At some time, the castles at Tutbury and Duffield were rebuilt, this time of stone. The next William also enjoyed many Royal favours.\n\nThe next Earl, Robert, the seventh generation, rebelled against Henry III and Tutbury Castle was destroyed. Although pardoned, Robert rebelled again and being defeated in battle at Chesterfield was dispossessed in 1269 and Duffield Castle was destroyed. His lands were given to Prince Edmund, who was shortly afterwards created Earl of Lancaster.\n\nThe castle was literally razed to the ground, much of the stone being scavenged for other buildings, and gradually became overgrown. Memories of a castle persisted, preserved in the name of \"Castle Orchard\", which extended from the present cottages of that name at the base of the castle mound, to the Hazlewood Road. The site was rediscovered in 1885.\n\nDuffield Castle originally occupied over an estimated 5 acres of land and had a massive keep. The keep spanned 31 metres in length and width (approximately 0.24 acres) and was constructed from stone. \n\nIn 1924, a H. Walton stated that there was a series of stairways and entrances on the west side that lead to the first floor; due to a lack of either windows or entrances on the ground floor level. The first floor was believed to contain a guardroom or stateroom and some private inner rooms. Furthermore, H. Walton also believed that the second floor contained domestic and small apartments, kitchens, private retirement rooms and possibly a chapel.\n\nWhen the site was excavated, the foundations of a traditional Norman motte and bailey castle were discovered, with a stone keep built upon it. What was remarkable was the size of the latter, about 98 feet in length and 95 feet in breadth, only slightly smaller than the White Tower in London.\nThe grounds were preserved, with the foundations marked out, and donated to the National Trust, in 1899, one of its earliest archaeological monuments. For many years, upkeep was carried out by the Parish Council, but has recently been taken back by the Trust.\n\nAlthough further investigations were carried out in the 1930s and in 1957, few medieval remains were found, but the idea that the site had been occupied before the arrival of the Normans was confirmed by a number of Romano‑British finds.\n\nA geophysical investigation of the site was carried out by the University of Bradford in 2001 and this revealed traces of other structures to the south and the southeast which would appear to date from the same period.

He published a book of his travels in 1799. Browne was murdered while attempting to reach Tehran.\n\nBrowne was born at Great Tower Hill, London. At seventeen he was sent to Oriel College, Oxford. Having had a moderate inheritance left him by his father, on quitting the university he applied himself entirely to literary pursuits. But the fame of James Bruce's travels, and of the first discoveries made by the African Association, made him determined to become an explorer of Central Africa. He went first to Egypt, arriving at Alexandria in January 1792. He spent some time in visiting the oasis of Siwa or Jupiter Ammon, and employed the remainder of the year in studying Arabic and in examining the ruins of Ancient Egypt.\n\nIn the spring of 1793 he visited Sinai, and in May set out for Darfur, joining the great caravan which every year went by the desert route from Egypt to that country. This was his most important journey, in which he acquired a great variety of original information. He was forcibly detained by the sultan of Darfur and endured much hardship, being unable to effect his purpose of returning by Ethiopia (then known as Abyssinia). He was, however, allowed to return to Egypt with the caravan in 1796; after this he spent a year in Syria, and did not arrive in London till September 1798.\n\nIn 1800 Browne again left England, and spent three years in visiting Greece, some parts of Asia Minor and Sicily. In 1812 he once more set out for the East, proposing to penetrate to Samarkand and survey the most interesting regions of central Asia. He spent the winter in Smyrna, and in the spring of 1813 travelled through Asia Minor and Armenia, made a short stay at Erzurum, and arrived on the June 1 at Tabriz. About the end of the summer of 1813 he left Tabriz for Tehran, intending to proceed further eastwards, but was shortly afterwards murdered. Some bones, believed to be his, were afterwards found and interred near the grave of Jean de Thévenot, the French traveller.\n\nIn 1799 Browne published his \"Travels in Africa, Egypt and Syria, from the years 1792 to 1798\". While informative, the dry style of his book prevented it from becoming popular.\n\nRobert Walpole published, from papers left by Browne, an account of Browne's journey in 1802 through Asia Minor to Antioch and Cyprus in the second volume of his \"Memoirs relating to European and Asiatic Turkey\" (1820); also \"Remarks written at Constantinople\" (1802).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2332911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332911", "title": "I.Q. (film)", "text": "I.Q. (film)\n\nI.Q. is a 1994 American romantic comedy film directed by Fred Schepisi and starring Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and Walter Matthau. The original music score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The film centers on a mechanic and a Princeton doctoral candidate who fall in love, thanks to the candidate's uncle, Albert Einstein.\n\nIs everything random \"or is there a Grand Design?\" muses Albert Einstein at the opening of the film. And we are left with the ultimate conclusion that where true love is concerned at least, the answer is a resounding \"Yes\" to a Grand Design.\n\nAn easy-going garage mechanic, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins), meets Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), a successful Princeton University mathematics doctoral candidate, as she comes into the garage, accompanied by her resistant and critical English fiancé, acerbic experimental psychology professor James Moreland (Stephen Fry). There is an immediate \"electric\" connection which Ed recognizes as he falls in love with her at first sight, but she is not yet aware.\n\nEd sees his future, briefly, and Catherine is a major part of it; they are married, and have children together. \"How long will all of this take?\" asks Catherine, referring to the car repair, and Ed, thinking about their future life together, replies, \"That's up to you\". His life purpose has suddenly been decided by a force of nature greater than himself.\n\nFinding a watch she left at the garage, Ed travels to her address and finds himself face to face with Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau), who is Catherine's uncle.\n\nAlbert—portrayed as a fun-loving genius—and his mischievous friends, fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht (Joseph Maher), Kurt Gödel (Lou Jacobi), and Boris Podolsky (Gene Saks), quickly accept Ed as a friend and see Ed as someone who would be better suited for Catherine. The four of them bring their communal vehicle to Ed's garage to have it modified as a convertible, and chat with Ed about how to attract Catherine's interest. An amused suggestion by Ed to \"borrow their brains\" inspires them to try to help Ed look and sound like a scientist (i.e., a \"wunderkind\" in physics) temporarily, in order to garner Catherine's attention for Ed, while at the same time trying to convince Catherine that life is not all about the mind, but is also about the heart. James's heart is virtually non-existent (as seen in his casual cruelty in his treatment of test subjects and limited awareness of humanity), while Ed's heart is adventurous and virtually limitless.\n\nEinstein sees bringing Ed and Catherine together as his most enduring legacy to his niece, because she was of the mistaken opinion that her only contribution to the world was to be through her children, and that she therefore must marry a total intellectual because then she will produce genius children, like himself. Einstein realizes that Ed loves Catherine for herself, and will help her blossom into her full potential as a person full of life and spirit; a fellow world traveler with mutual interests as varied as the Boyd's Comet and the Seven Sacred Pools on Maui, which James belittled.\n\nCatherine eventually sees through the \"intellectual Ed\" ruse Einstein and his cohorts had temporarily created in order to get her to give Ed some attention, but falls for Ed anyway, just as Einstein had hoped. A smiling Albert Einstein uses a small telescope to spy happily on the two young moonstruck lovers as they take delight in the return of Boyd's Comet and in each other's company. The film ends with both Catherine and Albert saying \"Wahoo!\", just as Einstein had earlier in the film while riding on Ed's motorcycle.\n\n\nFor dramatic reasons, \"I.Q.\" fictionalizes the lives of certain real people. Albert Einstein did not have a niece by the name of Catherine Boyd. Kurt Gödel was famously shy and reclusive, unlike his fictional counterpart in this film. The movie gives the impression that Einstein and his friends are all around the same age, when in fact, they were between 17 and 30 years younger than Einstein. The real-life Louis Bamberger died in 1944, before the film's set period.\n\nThe characters in the film listen to Little Richard's \"Tutti-Fruitti,\" which was released in November 1955, while Albert Einstein died in April of that year.\n\nWhile some viewers believe Robbins' character can be seen impersonating Don Vito Corleone, portrayed by Marlon Brando, from \"The Godfather\", which was released in 1972, he was actually impersonating the character of Johnny Strabler (also played by Marlon Brando), from The Wild One, a 1953 American film noir, whose persona became a cultural icon of the 1950s.\n\nThe director, Fred Schepisi, later said that, while he liked the film, it was not what it could have been:\n\nThe problem was there were two other producers, there was a studio and there was Tim Robbins and they were all contributing, and Tim Robbins was being difficult because he said in the '90s nobody would like a character who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie. That's the whole premise of the film. And it's all right for him to know that and believe it, but he should spend the whole time trying to say, \"Hey, I'm lying to you,\" and be constantly frustrated. Because of that attitude, he pulled the film this way, he pulled it that way while we were writing and it just felt messy. And nobody ever understood the value of those four scientists, and I like the cast that I had, but the other three scientists apart from Walter Matthau were originally going to be Peter Ustinov, Barry Humphries and John Cleese. I wanted them all the way through, but nobody understood how strong they would be. Nobody understood that with a garage and the scientists and this other guy, if you could just stay within that world, if you kept your two lovers together all the time under pressure and you do lots of silly things - there were a couple of wonderfully silly things when they were trying to prove his theory and they kept blowing things up - it had that whimsy about it that would have kept the lovers together and under tension. If they want subplots, they up the stakes and all this formulaic crap - and that's the problem.\n\n\"I.Q.\" opened in theaters on Christmas Day. It grossed $3,131,201 during its opening weekend (12/25-27), ranking #8 in opening-weekend sales for the weekend. By the time the film closed, it had made $26,381,221 domestically.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, as \"I.Q.\" holds a 44% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 25 reviews.\n\n"}

The understanding of this mediation has undergone development over time and especially with the advent of modern historical and biblical studies, as has the understanding of whether Christian sacrifice is meant to impact God or to draw our attention to God working in us. \nSacerdotalism is found in Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and some forms of Anglo-Catholic theology. \n\nThe current understanding of the role of the priest in the Roman Catholic Church depends vitally on the understanding of the sacrifice of Christ which is remembered in the Catholic Mass. A current explanation of Christ's sacrifice by Edward J. Kilmartin, S.J., a theologian at the Pontifical Gregorian University, is as follows. The Son's self-offering response to the love of the Father is realized over Jesus' whole human life, in a way that all humanity learns to better know and love the Father. The Christian participates in the life of faith of Jesus in his various ministries, as response to the Father. At the Eucharist, the Spirit brings to remembrance and binds us to Christ, through the ministry of the priest. All is through the initiative of the Father who demonstrated His love for us by sending the Son. \n\nUnlike the above Christian theologies, the Protestant tradition generally rejects \"sacerdotalism\". Those churches argue that the New Testament presents only one atoning sacrifice, the Body of Christ offered once for all on the cross by Christ himself, who is both the sinless offering and the sinless priest. The Eucharistic sacrifices of prayer, praise, and thanksgiving are offered by all believers as spiritual priests. The Body of Christ - in what is often called the Eucharist, Holy Communion, Holy Supper, or Lord's Supper - is not offered by the ministry to God as a means of sheltering the communicants from the divine wrath, but it is offered by God through the ministry as representatives of the congregation, to individuals, as an assurance of his gracious will to forgive them their sins.\n\nAccording to Lutherans, the office of the ministry in Christianity is not part of the priestly system of the Old Testament, rather it is an institution found in the Gospels. For some Lutherans this ministry is not a self-perpetuating group that can be passed on to successors through ordination. Instead, those Lutherans hold that the divinely instituted ministry continues the work of Christ by exercising on behalf of the laity the means of grace, which Christ gave to all Christian believers.. Other Lutherans emphasize the view that the office of the Ministry is a continuation of the priestly work of the Apostles handed down in a succession of ordinations, whether through bishops or presbyters.\n\n\n"}

He is best known as the singer, songwriter, and bassist of the popular 1980s ska pop band Doe Maar.\n\nVrienten began his career in the late 1960s as a member of local outfit Les Cruches. In the early 1970s he wrote songs for others and released his first single as Ruby Carmichael. In 1977 Vrienten released his debut solo album \"Paul Santos\", which he recorded with US producer Tom Salisbury. \"Lift Me Up Higher\" was extracted as a single.\n\nMeanwhile, Vrienten began to work with singer-songwriter Boudewijn de Groot in the studio and on stage. While recording the 1975 album \"Waar ik woon en wie ik ben\" ('Where I live and who I am\"), he met keyboard player Ernst Jansz and drummer Johnny Lodewijks. The latter suggested they form a reggae band. The Rumbones (Rumboon: Dutch alcohol-filled chocolate), led by the vocals of French Toots-soundalike Cris Lester, toured from October 13 to November 12, 1977 and split up immediately afterwards. Vrienten moved on to Sammie America's Gasphetti, recorded demos at his garage, and did another tour with de Groot. Jansz asked him to join his band Doe Maar, but Vrienten declined the offer, thinking that a Dutch-language group playing for fun would not survive. In 1980, he changed his mind after ending his relationship with his wife and her two teenage kids. Vrienten joined Doe Maar in time for the recording of their second album; he delivered three songs and co-designed the green/pink sleeve as the band's trademark colours.\n\nThe album \"Skunk\" was belatedly released in March 1981, \"32 Jaar\" (\"32 Years\") being the lead single and becoming a hit. The follow-up \"Smoorverliefd\" (\"Smitten\") missed the Top 40, but with the 1982-released \"Doris Day\", (a complaint against boring TV schedules), Doe Maar broke through and become key figures of the New Dutch Wave explosion. Initially they enjoyed their newfound popularity, but six months down the line doubts started to creep in.\n\nIn March 1983, by which time the fourth album \"Virus\" (4US), was released, Doe Maar announced a six-month publicity ban (i.e., no interviews and radio/TV appearances). This completely backfired as Doe Maar-mania grew even bigger.\n\nIn between tours of Belgium and the Netherlands Antilles, Henny recorded his first Dutch-language solo album, \"Geen Ballade\", which he released in March 1984, a few weeks before Doe Maar played two farewell shows for live broadcast.\n\nInstead of embarking on a solo tour, Vrienten decided to stretch himself by writing TV and film scores (notably the Dutch \"Sesame Street\") and producing for other artists.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1991, Vrienten played oldies like \"Teddy Bear's Picknick\" with Magnificent Seven, whose members include singer/advert composer Fay Lovsky and unofficial fifth Doe Maar-member Joost Belinfante.\n\nA new solo album was in the pipeline but held back by the release of a Best-of album; the expected Doe Maar revival never happened, and in early 1992, \"Mijn Hart Slaapt Nooit\" (\"My Heart Never Sleeps\") saw the light of day. As with \"Geen Ballade\", the album received minimal promotion. At the end of the year, all Doe Maar members reunited to support the 1960s outfit CCC Inc. (featuring Ernst Jansz and Joost Belinfante) at their 25th anniversary concert. Only a few people noticed.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a new generation of Dutch-language acts emerged, and Henny ended up collaborating with rap group Osdorp Posse.\n\nIn 1999, the four-piece rock band BLØF (also referred to as the Dutch Counting Crows) spent a whole tour playing a Doe Maar-covers-only set. Doe Maar members attended the show at the Amsterdam Paradiso and on November 1, 1999 they announced their reunion for one last album and a 25-date tour of the Netherlands and Belgium consisting of eight club shows, a record-breaking 16-night stint at the Rotterdam Ahoy, and a stadium show at the Antwerp Sportpaleis. \"Klaar\" (\"Done\") was released in April 2000; the band were finally acknowledged by the pop critics who had previously criticized them for singing in Dutch. The band continues to play occasional reunion shows.\n\nIn 2008 Vrienten recorded an album with contemporaries Frank Boeijen and Henk Hofstede (frontman of The Nits). \"Aardige jongens\" (\"Nice Guys\") was promoted with a theatre tour; they performed the album as well as individual classics.\n\nIn 2010 Vrienten appeared in \"Ali B op volle toeren\", a programme in which young Dutch rappers exchange songs with established artists. He contributed \"32 Jaar Later\" (\"32 Years Down the Line\"), a sequel to the song that gave Doe Maar their first top 40 hit back in 1981.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, he released two solo albums and went on tour, accompanied by his son Xander (Jett Rebel's bass-player at the time) and the three-piece-rock-band My Baby.\n\nIn 2016 Vrienten formed the supergroup Vreemde Kostgangers (\"Strange Boarders\") with Golden Earring guitarist George Kooymans and Boudewijn de Groot. In between tours they recorded two albums which were both released in 2017.\n\nIn 2019, Vrienten and son appeared in a self-made documentary on bass-players; it was the sequel to 2013's \"Gitaarjongens\" which explored the joy of guitar-playing. Vrienten and son(s) became the artist(s) in residence on talkshow \"De Wereld Draait Door\" during its final season. A new solo album, \"Tussen de Regels\" (\"Between the Lines\"), was released by the end of September. Early 2020, his song-lyrics were collected in \"De Een is de Ander Niet\" (\"No Two Are Alike\"); Vrienten also became guest-editor for \"Soundz\"-magazine in celebration of its 5th anniversary; he chronicled every aspect of his career and reunited with his fellow-musicians from the sixties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2332965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332965", "title": "Thomas Mun", "text": "Thomas Mun\n\nSir Thomas Mun (17 June 157121 July 1641) was an English writer on economics and is often referred to as the last of the early mercantilists. Most notably, he is known for serving as the director of the East India Company. Due to his strong belief in the state and his prior experience as a merchant, Mun took on a prominent role during the economic depression which began in 1620. To defend the East India Company and to regain England's economic stability, Mun published \"A Discourse of Trade from England unto the East-Indies.\"\n\nThrough mercantilist principles, Mun created a proposed set of \"means to enrich a kingdom\" which centred on ensuring that exports exceeded imports. In other words, Mun advocated for achieving a positive balance of trade which would cause England's wealth to steadily increase. Thomas Mun is also widely considered to be a sophisticated thinker and has become a hugely important part of the history of economic theory.\n\nThomas Mun was born in June 1571. He was the third child of a substantial London family based in the vicinity of St Andrew Hubbard, where he was baptised on 17 June 1571. His father, John Mun, and his stepfather both earned their livings as mercers. His grandfather, also named John Mun, was provost of moneyers in the Royal Mint of England. Through his family ties It can be assumed that Thomas gained insight into matters pertaining to currency and to the economy as a whole. At the age of forty-one, Thomas married Ursula Malcott and together they had three children: John, Ann and Mary. They chose the parish of St. Helen's Bishopsgate as their home.\n\nNothing is known about his education, but Thomas's own career as a merchant started around 1596 where he was a member of the Mercers' company and engaged in Mediterranean trade, especially with Italy and the Middle East. He was successful as a practising merchant and was able to amass a large fortune. In 1615, due to his prosperity, Mun was elected as the director of the East India Company and in 1622 was appointed as a member of the standing commission on trade. The rest of his professional career was spent advocating for and promoting the East India Company's interests.\n\nIn conjunction with the British Crown, The East India Company was a trading business established to colonise new lands and to pursue trade with the East Indies. In 1615 Mun was elected as the director of the company and set out to ensure that it was operating at full capacity. To achieve this meant that wealth would be maximised and exports would be increased. In 1620, during the onset of the depression, Mun's role within the economy was greatly enhanced. He was forced to not only defend the East India Company and its practices, but also aid the government in correcting the economy.\n\nThe trade crisis that eventually led to the depression stemmed from two separate events. First, through the East India Company, England was importing from India at a much higher rate than it was exporting. This negative balance of trade, or trade deficit, meant that England was sending out more money than it was bringing in, a clear detriment to the economy according to the principles of mercantilism. Second, to pay for all of their imports, England sent precious metals to India. As the only real determinant of affluence in the 1600s, due to the fact that paper money was not yet in use in Northern Europe, exporting precious metals was generally unheard of. For the East India Company, however, the exportation restrictions on bullion were reduced. Due to this stipulation, the exchange of silver for luxuries brought a lot of negative attention to the East India Company; citizens believed that it was a large factor in the economic downturn. Mun was thus put forward as a representative of the enterprise. His task was to clear the name of his company while also convincing his clients, and the general public, that the actions taken were ultimately for the best. He conveyed his views through his first published book, \"A Discourse of Trade from England Unto the East Indies.\"\n\nAccording to Mun, foreign trade was the best way to increase the wealth of a nation. More specifically, it was necessary for exports to exceed imports. All other corrective economic policies were secondary. As he says in \"England's Treasure by Foreign Trade\", we must \"sell more to strangers yearly than we consume of theirs in value.\" To achieve this positive balance of trade, Mun laid out a list of criterion which he urged England to follow\n\n\nMun's 1621 work, \"A Discourse of Trade from England unto the East Indies\", is in a large part a defence of company ethics. Due to the East India Company's practice of exporting silver, the general consensus swung against the company; they were in danger of losing their trade monopoly. The book was authored in an attempt to answer the charge that the East India Company was responsible for the shortage of silver and, thus, the depression. It is said that Mun vehemently and convincingly argued that the loss of precious metals was, in itself, not a detriment to the economy. Mun contended that, indirectly, the practices of the East India Company actually benefitted the economy. Not only did some of the imported goods produce a greater profit when re-exported (mostly to the Continent), but the growth of the shipping industry and the employment of dock workers was greatly increased.\n\nUltimately, Mun was successful in his attempt to salvage the name of the East India Company and alleviated the pressure from its biggest attackers. His brilliant defence was one of the main reasons as to why he was appointed to be a member of the Standing Commission on Trade in 1622. Mun's main task on the committee was to provide recommendations to the government in regard to British economic policy.\n\nWhile Mun's first publication earned him a strong reputation and high acclaim, it was ultimately his second authorship for which he is most well known. While serving as a member of the Privy Council committee of inquiry, Mun took a broader view of the economy as a whole and wrote \"England's Treasure by Forraign Trade\" or \"the Balance of Forraign Trade is the Rule of Our Treasure\". Although most likely written sometime between 1620–1630, the book was not published for the public until 1664, when it was \"published for the Common good by his son John,\" and dedicated to the Earl of Southampton, lord high treasurer.\n\nInfluenced by his work as a merchant and his time spent as the director of the East India Company, the book covers a wide array of topics. Most notably, however, \"England's Treasure\" is considered to be a direct repudiation of arguments made in regards to foreign trade by Gerard de Malynes and Edward Misselden. Mun was opposed to a fixed exchange rate, as proposed by Malynes, and saw it as more of an impairment than a benefit to the economy. In the book we also find the first notion of Mun's theory of the balance of trade. It should be the focus of English policy, argued Mun, to export at a higher rate than it imports from abroad. In doing so, the wealth of the country will inevitably increase.\n\nThe publication, however, was not as optimistic as it is widely perceived it to be. A large portion of the book is spent chastising the British for being too unlike the Dutch. A strong work ethic, a restraint from conspicuous consumption, and a vigorous trade regiment are all qualities which led to the overall prosperity of the Dutch. They are also qualities, Mun contends, that the British did not possess.\n\n\n"}

He was a pupil of Philo of Larissa at the Academy, but he diverged from the Academic skepticism of Philo and his predecessors. He was a teacher of Cicero, and the first of a new breed of eclectics among the Platonists; he endeavoured to bring the doctrines of the Stoics and the Peripatetics into Platonism, and stated, in opposition to Philo, that the mind could distinguish true from false. In doing so, he claimed to be reviving the doctrines of the Old Academy. With him began the phase of philosophy known as Middle Platonism.\n\nAntiochus was born in Ashkelon. He was a friend of Lucullus (the antagonist of Mithridates) and the teacher of Cicero during his studies at Athens in 79 BC; but he had a school at Alexandria also, as well as in Syria, where he seems to have died. He was a philosopher of considerable reputation in his time, for Strabo in describing Ascalon, mentions his birth there as a mark of distinction for the city, and Cicero frequently speaks of him in affectionate and respectful terms as the best and wisest of the Academics, and the most polished and acute philosopher of his age.\n\nAntiochus studied under the Stoic Mnesarchus, but his principal teacher was Philo, who succeeded Clitomachus as the head (\"scholarch\") of the Academy. He is, however, better known as the adversary than the disciple of Philo; and Cicero mentions a treatise called \"Sosus\", written by him against his master, in which he refutes the scepticism of the Academics. Another of his works, called \"Canonica\", is quoted by Sextus Empiricus, and appears to have been a treatise on logic.\n\nAntiochus was called the founder of the \"fifth Academy,\" in the same way that Philo was called the founder of the fourth. This split occurred just before the First Mithridatic War began in 88 which would lead to the destruction of the Academy in 86. During this time, Antiochus was resident in Alexandria. He had returned to Athens by the time Cicero studied there in 79, and he seems to have died around 68.\n\nThe Academic skepticism of the Academy before Antiochus probably had its origin in Plato's successful attempts to lead his disciples to abstract reasoning as the right method of discovering truth, and not to trust too much to the impressions of the senses. Cicero even ranks Plato himself with those philosophers who held that there was no such thing as certainty in any kind of knowledge; as if his depreciation of the senses as trustworthy organs of perception, and of the kind of knowledge which they convey, invalidated also the conclusions of the reason.\n\nLater philosophers, either by insisting too exclusively on the uncertainty of the senses (in order like Arcesilaus to exaggerate by comparison the value of speculative truth), or like Carneades and Philo, by extending the same fallibility to reason, had fallen into a degree of scepticism that seemed to strike at the root of all truth, theoretical and practical. It was, therefore, the chief object of Antiochus, besides promoting particular doctrines in moral philosophy, to examine the grounds of our knowledge, and our capacities for discovering truth; though no complete judgment can be formed of his success, as the book in which Cicero gave the fullest representation of his opinions has been lost.\n\nAntiochus professed to be reviving the doctrines of the \"Old Academy\", or of Plato's school, when he maintained, in opposition to Philo and Carneades, that the intellect had in itself a test by which it could distinguish truth from falsehood; or in the language of the Academics, discern between the images arising from actual objects and those conceptions that had no corresponding reality. For the argument of the sceptics was, that if two notions were so exactly similar as that they could not be distinguished, neither of them could be said to be known with more certainty than the other; and that every true notion was liable to have a false one of this kind attached to it: therefore nothing could be certainly known. This reasoning was obviously overthrown by the assertion that the mind contained within itself the standard of truth and falsehood; it was also attacked more generally by the argument that all such reasoning refutes itself, since it proceeds upon principles assumed to be true, and then concludes that there can be no certain ground for any assumption at all. In this manner Antiochus seems to have taken the side of the Stoics in defending the senses from the charge of complete uncertainty brought against them by the Academics.\n\nIt is evident that in such discussions the same questions were examined which had formerly been more thoroughly sifted by Plato and Aristotle, in analyzing the nature of science and treating of the different kinds of truth, according as they were objects of pure intellectual apprehension, or only of probable and uncertain knowledge. The result was an attempt to revive the dialectic art which the Academics had ignored, so the existing accounts of Antiochus' moral teaching seem to show. Without yielding to the paradoxes of the Stoics, or the skepticism of the Academics, he held in the main doctrines nearly coinciding with those of Aristotle: that happiness consists essentially in a virtuous life, yet is not independent of external things. So he denied the Stoic doctrine that all crimes were equal, but agreed with them in holding that all the emotions ought to be suppressed. On the whole, therefore, though Cicero inclines to rank him among the Stoics, it appears that he considered himself an eclectic philosopher, and attempted to unite the doctrines of the Stoics and Peripatetics, so as to revive the old Academy.\n\n\n\n"}

Research during the following twenty years was based mainly on the documented on-site observations. Consequently, experts remained reluctant to agree on a conclusive age nor was there consensus on the species it belonged to.\n\nOnly after a fragment of the right scapula (shoulder blade) was retrieved was it possible to produce an accurate dating of the individual, an analysis and diagnostic of its morphological features, and a preliminary paleogenetic characterization. In a 2015 paper published in the \"Journal of Human Evolution,\" it was announced that the fossil was a Neanderthal, and dating of the calcite has revealed that the bones are between 187,000 and 128,000 years old.\n\nAltamura Man is one of the most complete Paleolithic skeletons ever to be discovered in Europe as \"even the bones inside the nose are still there\" and as of 2016 it represents the oldest sample of Neanderthal DNA to have been sequenced successfully.\n\nThe skull was discovered in October 1993 by speleologists of CARS (Centro Altamurano Ricerche Speleologiche) in the cave of Lamalunga in Altamura, Italy. While exploring the cave the researchers stumbled upon a deep karst sinkhole, formed by the action of running water on limestone. The sinkhole merges into a tunnel about long in which they found the Altamura Man incorporated into the calcium carbonate concretions that had formed by water dribbling down the cave walls. The finding was reported to researchers at the University of Bari.\n\nThe remaining skeletal structure owes its excellent state of preservation to the fact that Altamura Man obviously had fallen into this remote spot, got stuck, probably badly injured where he must have starved to death or died from lack of water intake. Unaffected by weather and disarticulation (dispersion of skeletal structure by scavengers) the calcite preserved the bones but it also covers them to a great extent. It was thought that excavating the remains would cause irreparable damage and thus, the bones have remained in situ for over twenty years.\n\nThe fossilized skull of a 35-year-old adult male displays the anthropological features of the hypodigm of \"Homo neanderthalensis\" who lived during the Middle-Upper Pleistocene between 170,000 and 130,000 BP. Yet a number of phenetic peculiarities exist, such as the shape of the brow ridges, the relative dimension of the mastoids and the general architecture of the cranial vault, which according to the research team of the Sapienza University of Rome support accepted speciation chronology. \"It shows archaic traits, making the Altamura Man a sort of morphological bridge between the previous human species such as \"Homo heidelbergensis\" and the Neanderthals\".\n\nResearchers associated with the University of Bari have carried out laser scans of the find, obtaining numerical maps, models and three-dimensional videos of the fossil. Results of a study of the DNA sample taken from the scapula determined that it belongs to the genetic variability of the \"Neanderthal of Southern Europe\".\n\nChronological studies on twenty faunal remains retrieved from the Cave Of Lamalunga based on Uranium-thorium dating by Maria Elisabetta Branca and Mario Voltaggio of \"IGAG\" (Institute of Environmental Geology and Geoengineering) and \"CNR\" (Italian National Research Council) in Rome and published in 2010 show a deposition age varying between 45,000 and 17,000 BP. with the majority of remains varying between 45,000 and 30,000 years ago. Accumulation of cave deposits were found to begin around 170,000 years ago and ended 17,000 years ago.\n\nMore recent research analysis that began in 2009 and based on Uranium-thorium dating revealed that the calcite was formed 172,000 to 130,000 years ago during the penultimate quaternary glaciation period.\n\nThe Altamura man remains embedded in a matrix of limestone to this day. As such a running challenge exists among experts to devise a way to remove the fossil intact.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2000 the \"Sarastro\" project was carried out by Digamma Research Consortium, using integrated tele-operated systems it allowed remote access and observation of the site.\n\n"}

{"id": "2332995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332995", "title": "Cindy Sherman", "text": "Cindy Sherman\n\nCynthia Morris Sherman (born January 19, 1954) is an American artist whose work consists exclusively of photographic self-portraits, depicting herself in many different contexts and as various imagined characters.\n\nHer breakthrough work is often considered to be \"Complete Untitled Film Stills,\" a series of 70 black-and-white photographs of herself in many of the roles of women in performance media (especially arthouse films and popular B-movies). In the 1980s, Sherman used color film and large prints, and focused more on costume, lighting and facial expression.\n\nIn 1995, Sherman was the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship. In 2013 she received an honorary doctorate degree from the Royal College of Art, London.\n\nSherman was born on January 19, 1954, in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, the youngest of the five children of Dorothy and Charles Sherman. Shortly after her birth, her family moved to the township of Huntington, Long Island. Her father worked as an engineer for Grumman Aircraft. Her mother taught reading to children with learning difficulties.\n\nIn 1972, Sherman enrolled in the visual arts department at Buffalo State College, where she began painting. During this time, she began to explore the ideas which became a hallmark of her work: She dressed herself as different characters, cobbled together from thrift-store clothing. Frustrated with what she saw as the limitations of painting as a medium of art, she abandoned it and took up photography. \"[T]here was nothing more to say [through painting]\", she recalled. \"I was meticulously copying other art, and then I realized I could just use a camera and put my time into an idea instead.\" Sherman has said about this time: \"One of the reasons I started photographing myself was that supposedly in the spring one of my teachers would take the class out to a place near Buffalo where there were waterfalls and everybody romps around without clothes on and takes pictures of each other. I thought, ‘Oh, I don't want to do this. But if we're going to have to go to the woods I better deal with it early.’ Luckily we never had to do that.\" She spent the remainder of her college education focused on photography. Though Sherman had failed a required photography class as a freshman, she repeated the course with Barbara Jo Revelle, whom she credited with introducing her to conceptual art and other contemporary forms. At college she met Robert Longo, a fellow artist who encouraged her to record her process of \"dolling up\" for parties. This was the beginning of her Untitled Film Still series.\n\nIn 1974, together with Longo, Charles Clough and Nancy Dwyer, she created Hallwalls, an arts center intended as a space that would accommodate artists from diverse backgrounds. Sherman was also exposed to the contemporary art exhibited at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the two Buffalo campuses of the SUNY school system, Media Studies Buffalo, and the Center for Exploratory and Perceptual Arts, and Artpark, in nearby Lewiston, N.Y.\n\nIt was in Buffalo that Sherman encountered the photo-based conceptual works of artists Hannah Wilke, Eleanor Antin, and Adrian Piper. Along with artists like Laurie Simmons, Louise Lawler, and Barbara Kruger, Sherman is considered to be part of the Pictures Generation.\n\nSherman works in series, typically photographing herself in a range of costumes. To create her photographs, Sherman shoots alone in her studio, assuming multiple roles as author, director, make-up artist, hairstylist, wardrobe mistress, and model.\n\n\"Bus Riders\" (1976–2000) is a series of photographs that feature the artist as a variety of meticulously observed characters. The photographs were shot in 1976 for the Bus Authority for display on a bus. Sherman used costumes and make-up, including blackface, to transform her identity for each image, and the cutout characters were lined up along the bus's advertising strip. Some critiques say that this work showed insensitivity to race through the use of blackface makeup while others state that it was rather with the intention of exposing racism embedded in society.\n\nOther early works involved cutout figures, such as the Murder Mystery and Play of Selves.\n\nIn her landmark photograph series \"Untitled Film Stills\", (1977–80), Sherman appears as B-movie and film noir actresses. When asked if she considers herself to be acting in her photographs, Sherman said, “I never thought I was acting. When I became involved with close-ups I needed more information in the expression. I couldn't depend on background or atmosphere. I wanted the story to come from the face. Somehow the acting just happened.”\n\nMany of Sherman's photo series, like the 1981 \"Centerfolds,\" call attention to stereotypes of women in films, television and magazines. When talking about one of her centerfold pictures Sherman stated, \"In content I wanted a man opening up the magazine suddenly look at it with an expectation of something lascivious and then feel like the violator that they would be looking at this woman who is perhaps a victim. I didn't think of them as victims at the time... Obviously I'm trying to make someone feel bad for having a certain expectation\".\n\nShe explained to \"The New York Times\" in 1990, \"I feel I'm anonymous in my work. When I look at the pictures, I never see myself; they aren't self-portraits. Sometimes I disappear.\" She describes her process as intuitive, and that she responds to elements of a setting such as light, mood, location, and costume, and will continue to change external elements until she finds what she wants. She has said of her process, \"I think of becoming a different person. I look into a mirror next to the camera…it’s trance-like. By staring into it I try to become that character through the lens ... When I see what I want, my intuition takes over—both in the 'acting' and in the editing. Seeing that other person that’s up there, that’s what I want. It's like magic.”\n\nThe series \"Untitled Film Stills\" (1977–1980), with which Cindy Sherman achieved international recognition, consists of 69 black-and-white photographs. The artist poses in different roles (librarians, hillbillies, and seductresses), and settings (streets, yards, pools, beaches, and interiors), producing a result reminiscent of stills typical of Italian neorealism or American film noir of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. She avoided putting titles on the images to preserve their ambiguity. She would often pose her heroines as alone, expressionless, and in private. An overarching characteristic of her heroines were those that did not follow conventional ideas of marriage and family. They were rebellious women who either died as that or who were later tamed by society. Modest in scale compared to Sherman's later cibachrome photographs, they are all 8 1/2 by 11 inches, each displayed in identical, simple black frames.\nSherman used her own possessions as props, or sometimes borrowed, as in \"Untitled Film Still #11\" in which the doggy pillow belongs to a friend. The shots were also largely taken in her own apartment.\nThe \"Untitled Film Stills\" fall into several distinct groups:\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan purchased the series for an estimated $1 million in 1995.\n\nIn addition to her film stills, Sherman has appropriated a number of other visual forms—the centerfold, fashion photograph, historical portrait, and soft-core sex image. These and other series, like the 1980s \"Fairy Tales and Disasters\" sequence, were shown for the first time at the Metro Pictures Gallery in New York City.\n\nIt was with her series \"Rear Screen Projections\", 1980, that Sherman switched from black-and-white to color and to clearly larger formats. \"Centerfolds/Horizontals\", 1981, are inspired by the center spreads in fashion and pornographic magazines. The twelve (24 by 48 inches) photographs were initially commissioned — but not used — by Artforum's Editor in Chief Ingrid Sischy for an artist's section in the magazine. She poses either on the floor or in bed, usually recumbent and often supine. About her aims with the self-portraits, Sherman has said: \"Some of them I'd hope would seem very psychological. While I'm working I might feel as tormented as the person I'm portraying.”\n\nIn 1982, Sherman began her \"Pink Robes\" series which includes Untitled #97, #98, #99 and #100.\n\nIn \"Fairy Tales\", 1985, and \"Disasters\", 1986–1989, Cindy Sherman uses visible prostheses and mannequins for the first time. Provoked by the 1989 NEA funding controversy involving photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, as well as the way Jeff Koons modeled his porn star wife in his \"Made in Heaven\" series, Sherman produced the \"Sex\" series in 1989. For once she removed herself from the shots, as these photographs featured pieced-together medical dummies in flagrante delicto.\n\nBetween 1989 and 1990, Sherman made 35 large, color photographs restaging the settings of various European portrait paintings of the fifteenth through early 19th centuries under the title \"History Portraits\".\n\nSherman uses prosthetic limbs and mannequins to create her \"Sex Pictures\" series (1992). Hal Foster, an American art critic, describes Sherman's \"Sex Pictures\" in his article \"Obscene, Abject, Traumatic\" as “[i]n this scheme of things the impulse to erode the subject and to tear at the screen has driven Sherman […] to her recent work, where it is obliterated by the gaze.” Moreover, Abigail Solomon- Godeau, a photo critic who taught art history at the University of California, illustrates Sherman's work in \"Suitable for Framing: The Critical Recasting of Cindy Sherman\". Solomon-Godeau writes, “[Sherman's] pictures have struck many viewers as centrally concerned with the problematics of femininity (as role, as image, as spectacle); more recent interpretation now finds them redolent with allusion to “our common humanity,” revealing “a progression through the deserts of human condition.”\nReviewer Jerry Saltz told \"New York\" magazine that Sherman's work is “[f]ashioned from dismembered and recombined mannequins, some adorned with pubic hair, one posed with a tampon in vagina, another with sausages being excreted from vulva, this was anti-porn porn, the unsexiest sex pictures ever made, visions of feigning, fighting, perversion. … Today, I think of Cindy Sherman as an artist who only gets better.” Commentator Greg Fallis of Utata Tribal Photography describes Sherman's \"Sex Pictures\" series and her work as follow: \"[t]he progression of her work reflects more than a progression of ideology. It also demonstrates a progression in approach. Sherman’s initial photographs used relatively few props—just clothing. As her photographs became more sophisticated, so did her props. During her Centerfold series, she began to incorporate prosthetic body part culled from the pages of medical educational catalogs. Each new series tended to utilize more prosthetics and less of Sherman herself. By the time she began the \"Sex Pictures\" series, the photographs were exclusively of prosthetic body parts. Often close-up shots of prosthetic male/female genitalia, this series of photos were shot exclusively in color. With her \"Sex Pictures\", Sherman posed medical prostheses in sexualized positions, recreating—and strangely modifying—pornography. They are a comment on the intersection of art and taste, they are a comment on pornography and the way porn objectifies the men and women who pose for it, they are a comment on social discomfort with overt sexuality, and they are a comment on the relationship between sex and violence. Yet the emphasis is still on creating a striking image that seems simultaneously familiar and strange.\" Utata's Sunday Salon\n\nBetween 2003 and 2004, Sherman produced the \"Clowns\" cycle, where the use of digital photography enabled her to create chromatically garish backdrops and montages of numerous characters. Set against opulent backdrops and presented in ornate frames, the characters in Sherman's 2008 untitled \"Society Portraits\" are not based on specific women, but the artist has made them look entirely familiar in their struggle with the standards of beauty that prevail in a youth- and status-obsessed culture.\n\nHer exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 2012 also presented a photographic mural (2010–11) accompanied by films selected by Sherman. Based on a 32-page insert Sherman did for \"POP\" using vintage clothes from Chanel’s archive, a more recent series of large-scale pictures from 2012 depict outsized enigmatic female figures standing in striking isolation before ominous painterly landscapes the artist had photographed in Iceland during the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull and on the isle of Capri.\n\nIn 2017, she collaborated on a \"selfie\" project with W Magazine that was based on the concept of the \"plandid,\" or \"the planned candid photograph\". Sherman utilized a variety of photo-correction apps to create her Instagram portraits.\n\nSherman's career has also included several fashion series, including designs for Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, and Marc Jacobs. In 1983, fashion designer and retailer Dianne Benson commissioned her to create a series of advertisements for her store, Dianne B., that appeared in several issues of Interview magazine. Sherman also created photographs for an editorial in \"Harper's Bazaar\" in 1993. In 1994, she produced the \"Post Card Series for Comme des Garçons\" for the brand's autumn/winter 1994–95 collections in collaboration with Rei Kawakubo.\n\nIn 2006, she created a series of fashion advertisements for designer Marc Jacobs. The advertisements themselves were photographed by Juergen Teller and released as a monograph by Rizzoli. For Balenciaga, Sherman created the six-image series \"Cindy Sherman: Untitled (Balenciaga)\" in 2008; they were first shown to the public in 2010. Also in 2010, Sherman collaborated with Anna Hu on a design for a piece of jewelry.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Sherman worked with Minneapolis band Babes in Toyland, providing photographs for covers for the albums \"Fontanelle\" and \"Painkillers\", creating a stage backdrop used in live concerts, and acting in the promotional video for the song \"Bruise Violet.\" She also worked as a film director. Sherman moved from photographs to film with her movie \"Office Killer\" in 1997, starring Jeanne Tripplehorn, Molly Ringwald and Carol Kane. Dorine, played by Carol Kane, is a stand-in for Sherman. They have a shared interest in arranging bodies, like a puppeteer, in diorama-like scenes. According to author Dahlia Schweitzer, \"Office Killer\" is full of unexpected characters and plot twists. Schweitzer considers the film to be a comedy, horror, melodrama, noir, feminist statement, and an art piece. The film got mixed reviews. In a review for \"The New York Times\", art critic Roberta Smith states that the film lacks the artist's usual finesse and is a retrospective of her work - \"a fascinating if lumpish bit of Shermaniana.\" Movie critic colleague to Roberta Smith, Stephen Holden, called the film \"sadly inept.\" Later, she had a cameo role in John Waters' film \"Pecker\", and also appeared in \"The Feature\" in 2008, starring ex-husband Michel Auder, which won a New Vision Award. Echoing similar grisly and gory elements as her \"Untitled Horror\" series, the film includes several artistically executed murder scenes. \"Office Killer\" grossed $37,446 and received generally poor reviews, which called the film \"crude\" and \"laugh-free.\"\n\nIn the catalog essay by Philipp Kaiser for Sherman's 2016 exhibition at the Metro Pictures Gallery, he mentioned six short films that Sherman made while in college, and how they were the precursors that eventually led to \"Office Killer\" being created. The catalog also includes a conversation between Sherman and the director of the exhibit, Sofia Coppola, in which Sherman admits that she may star in an upcoming film project.\n\nSherman's first solo show in New York was presented at a noncommercial space called the Kitchen in 1980. When the Metro Pictures Gallery opened later that year, Sherman's photographs were the first show. “Untitled Film Stills” were shown first at the non-profit gallery Artists Space where Sherman was working as a receptionist. Her first solo exhibitions in France were presented by Galerie Chantal Crousel in Paris.\n\nSherman has since participated in many international events, including SITE Santa Fe (2004); the Venice Biennale (1982, 1995); and five Whitney Biennials. In addition to numerous group exhibitions, Sherman's work was the subject of solo exhibitions at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (1982), Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (1987), Kunsthalle Basel (1991), Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. (1995), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1998), the Serpentine Gallery in London and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art (2003), and Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin (2007), among others. Major traveling retrospectives of Sherman's work have been organized by the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in Rotterdam (1996); the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York (1997); and Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria, Louisiana Museum for Moderne Kunst, Denmark, and Jeu de Paume in Paris (2006–2007). In 2009, Sherman was included in the seminal show \"The Pictures Generation, 1974–1984\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nIn 2012, the Museum of Modern Art mounted “Cindy Sherman,” a show that chronicled Sherman's work from the mid-1970s on and include more than 170 photographs. The exhibition travelled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. In 2013, Sherman was invited to organize a show within that year's Venice Biennale.\n\nIn 2016, after a sabbatical from her studio which was spent \"coming to terms with health issues and getting older,\" Sherman produced and staged her first photo gallery in five years. The series, \"The Imitation of Life,\" named after a 1959 melodrama by Douglas Sirk, tackles aging by presenting Sherman in highly stylized glamour portraits inspired by the divas of old Hollywood, such as Gloria Swanson, Mary Pickford, and Ruby Keeler. The series was exhibited in 2016 at the Metro Pictures Gallery in New York City, and also at the Broad Museum in Los Angeles. In 2017 it was shown at the Spruth Magers gallery in Berlin, Germany, and at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio.\nIn 2019, the National Portrait Gallery, London, organised a major retrospective of Sherman's works from the mid-1970s to the present day.\n\nWorks by Sherman are held in the following collections:\n\nSherman's work is often linked to feminism, since her photos call attention to the objectification of women in the media. Sherman's 1981 series \"Centerfolds\" contains pseudo-voyeuristic images of young women. Her 2008 series \"Society Pictures\" addresses the obsession with female youth and beauty in American society. Her most recent series, the 2016 \"Imitation of Life\", explores the glamour that can be found within mature women. By using stylized, vintage costumes and heavy makeup, Sherman is rendered as a subject that looks almost artificial, aside from her conspicuously-placed, aged hands, which point to the reality behind the illusion.\n\nWhen writing about Sherman's \"Film Stills\" in the journal \"October\", the scholar Douglas Crimp states that Sherman's work is \"a hybrid of photography and performance art that reveals femininity to be an effect of representation.\"\n\nHowever, Sherman does not consider her work or herself to be feminist, stating \"The work is what it is and hopefully it's seen as feminist work, or feminist-advised work, but I'm not going to go around espousing theoretical bullshit about feminist stuff.\"\n\nMany scholars emphasize the relationship Cindy Sherman's work has with the concept of the gaze. In particular, scholars like Laura Mulvey have analyzed Sherman's \"Untitled\" series in relation to the male gaze. In a 1991 essay on Sherman, Mulvey states that ″the accouterments of the feminine struggle to conform to a facade of desirability haunt Sherman's iconography,″ which functions as a parody of different voyeurisms captured by the camera.\n\nOthers question whether this confrontation with the male gaze and a feminine struggle was an intentional consideration of Sherman's, and whether this intentionality is important in considering the feminist standpoint of Sherman's photography.\n\nSherman herself has identified an uncertainty toward the \"Untitled\" series' relationship with the male gaze. In a 1991 interview with David Brittain in \"Creative Camera,\" Sherman said that \"I didn't really analyze it at the time as far as knowing that I was commenting upon some feminist issue. The theories weren't there at all... But now I can look back on some of them, and I think some of them are a little blatantly obvious, too much like the original pin-up pictures of those times, so I have mixed feelings about them now as a whole series.\"\n\nIn addition to questions of the gaze, Sherman's work is also given feminist analysis in the context of Abjection. Scholars like Hal Foster and Laura Mulvey interpret Sherman's use of the abject via the grotesque in 1980s projects like \"Vomit Pictures\" as de-fetishizing the female body.\n\nScholar Michele Meager interprets Sherman as having been \"crowned a resistant celebrity\" to feminist theory.\n\nIn 1981, Sherman was artist-in-residence at the non-profit Light Work in Syracuse, New York. In 1995, she was the recipient of one of the MacArthur Fellowships. This fellowship grants $500,000 over five years, no strings attached, to important scholars in a wide range of fields, to encourage their future creative work. Among her awards are the Larry Aldrich Foundation Award (1993); Wolfgang Hahn Prize (1997); Hasselblad Award (1999); Guild Hall Academy of the Arts Lifetime Achievement Award for Visual Arts (2005); American Academy of Arts and Sciences Award (2003); National Arts Award (2001); Jewish Museum’s Man Ray Award (2009); the Roswitha Haftmann Prize (2012); and the Wolf Prize in Art (2020). In 2010, Sherman was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Arts, London. She received an honorary doctorate degree from the Royal College of Art, London, in 2013.\n\nAt the 10th anniversary Gala in the Garden at the Hammer Museum in 2012, Sherman was honored by actor Steve Martin. In 2012, Sherman was among the artists whose works were given as trophies to the filmmakers of winning pictures in the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival's jury competitions.\n\nIn 2010, Sherman's nearly six foot tall chromogenic color print \"Untitled#153\" (1985), featuring the artist as a mudcaked corpse, was sold by Phillips de Pury & Company for a record $2.7 million, near the $3 million high estimate. In 2011, a print of \"Untitled#96\" fetched $3.89 million at Christie's, making it the most expensive photograph at that time.\n\nSherman's work is often credited as a major influence for contemporary portrait photographers. One such photographer is Ryan Trecartin, who manipulates themes of identity in his videos and photography. Her influence stretches to other mediums of art including painter, Lisa Yuskavage, visual artist, Jillian Mayer, and performance artist, Tracy Ullman.\n\nIn April 2014, actor and artist James Franco exhibited a series of photographs at the Pace Gallery called \"New Film Stills\", in which Franco restaged twenty-nine images from Sherman's \"Untitled Film Stills\". The exhibit garnered mainly negative reviews, calling Franco's appropriations 'sophomoric,' 'sexist,' and embarrassingly clueless.'\n\nSherman married director Michel Auder in 1984, making her stepmother to Auder's daughter, Alexandra, and her half-sister Gaby Hoffmann. They divorced in 1999.\nFrom 2007 to 2011, she had a relationship with the artist David Byrne.

Soon after his death, it was alleged that he had committed acts of extreme domestic violence and sexual abuse.\n\nMullard was born in a humble background in Islington, London. He started work at the age of 14 as a butcher's assistant and joined the Army at 18. It was there that he began boxing, becoming champion of his regiment. When he left the army after three years, he had a short stint at boxing professionally. This ended after 20 fights over three years, following a knock-out from which he lost his memory. He married Florence Rose in the second quarter of 1939. He is recorded in the 1939 Register as a general labourer living with his parents at 35 Douglas Street, Islington. He rejoined the army in the Second World War, becoming a Warrant Officer (sergeant major) in the Royal Artillery.\n\nFollowing the end of the war in 1945 Mullard sought work as a stuntman at Pinewood and Ealing film studios, from which he drifted into uncredited bit-parts in British films such as \"Oliver Twist\" (1948), \"The Lavender Hill Mob\" (1951) and \"The Ladykillers\" (1955).\n\nMullard's face and cockney accent lent themselves to a certain character and he graduated to more visible roles in comedy films and on television. It was on television that Mullard made a name for himself, first as a straight man for Tony Hancock, Frankie Howerd and Benny Hill, then in \"The Arthur Askey Show\". It was the London Weekend Television series \"Romany Jones\", first aired in 1973, which gave Mullard his highest profile, playing Wally Briggs, a crafty caravan-dweller. Popular in its time, the show did not find critical favour and has subsequently been named as one of the worst British sitcoms ever made.\n\nSo popular was Mullard's character that a sequel, \"Yus, My Dear\", was broadcast in 1976, in which Wally and his wife Lily (Queenie Watts) had moved out of their caravan into a council house. The series gained modest ratings, though it too received critical broadsides as one of Britain's worst-ever sitcoms.\n\nMullard (or \"Arfur\" as he was widely known) was regularly a guest in other programmes and television commercials. He and Watts also reprised their roles of Wally and Lily appearing in the film \"Holiday on the Buses\" (1973), the last feature-length version of the popular \"On the Buses\" comedy series of the time.\n\nMullard also appeared in \"Ladies Who Do\" (1963), \"Morgan!\" (1966), \"The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery\" (1966), \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" (1968) and \"Adventures of a Plumber's Mate\" (1978). In 1986, invited by producer Victor Lewis-Smith, Mullard hosted an edition of \"Midweek\" on BBC Radio 4 to replace regular host Libby Purves during her temporary absence.\n\nIn 1967, Mullard recorded \"I Love You, You Love Me\"/\"Was It Something I Said\" on the Masquerade label (MA5001). This was followed the same year by an album \"Arthur Mullard of London\" (MQ 2003) The LP included Mullard's cover of the Beatles' \"Yesterday\", jokes and philosophy. More singles followed in the 1970s, including 1974's \"Not Now Arthur\"/\"If I Only Had My Time Again\" (BASFBA 1012), and in 1975 \"I Only Have Eyes for You\"/\"One 'Fing 'N' Annuver\" (RCA 2610) with \"Yus My Dear\"/\"Arthur\" (RCA Z639A) released in 1976.\n\nHe entered the UK Singles Chart in 1978 with his cover of \"You're the One That I Want\" (Pye 7N 46121) (from the film \"Grease)\" with Hylda Baker, who was in her seventies. The single, which peaked at Number 22 in the UK, was taken from the album, \"Band On The Trot\" (Pye PKL 5576).\nThe single was the last professional success of Mullard's life; there followed an uncredited narration on the Glenn Close-led live action \"101 Dalmatians\", released in 1996 after his death.\n\nIn 1996, after Mullard's death, the \"Sunday Mirror\" reported that a \"This Is Your Life\" special about Mullard was planned, until it was cancelled after producers contacted his eldest son and discovered Mullard's history of extreme domestic violence and years of sexual abuse against his daughter, starting when she was 13.\n\nHis wife Florence committed suicide by an overdose of sleeping tablets in 1961 after suffering from poor physical and mental health. Her death was said by her daughter to be partly the result of the extreme physical and mental violence Mullard perpetrated against her. She left a suicide note which said, \"I don't want to live any more because of what you're doing with Barbara. Please look after my Johnny.\" Mullard continued to live in a council house in Islington after his success and spent much of his free time socialising in local pubs. He died in his sleep on 11 December 1995, aged 85. Despite his alleged acts of child sexual abuse against her his daughter nursed him in his dotage. He left her and one of her brothers £5,000 each; he left £250,000 to a children's home.\n\nHe wrote an autobiography, \"Oh, Yus, It's Arthur Mullard\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2333014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333014", "title": "Lagan College", "text": "Lagan College\n\nLagan College is an integrated secondary school in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It was formed in 1981 as the first integrated school in Northern Ireland and contains students of mainly Roman Catholic and Protestant faiths, however students from other faiths also attend the school.\n\nThe school is currently situated on National Trust land, overlooking Belfast. It is named after the River Lagan, which flows through the city. It is one of Northern Ireland's most oversubscribed secondary schools.\n\nLagan College was founded as a response to the conflict in the community and to the religiously divided school system in Northern Ireland. Most Catholic children attended Catholic-maintained schools, while Protestant school children mainly attended state schools.\n\nSince 1974 the All Children Together (ACT) movement had been lobbying against the segregation in schools in Northern Ireland, however even by 1981 there had been virtually no initiatives from either the churches or the government in the direction of integration. Consequently, a small group of parents with children at the age of transfer from primary to secondary school decided to take the initiative with the support of ACT. They founded the school in September 1981 in temporary premises at Ardnavally Activity Centre beside the River Lagan in South Belfast.\n\nOn the first day the school contained 28 pupils and seven staff members, including the Principal, Mrs Sheila Greenfield, one full-time teacher and five part-time teachers. At the end of 1981 the college needed to be relocated, and it was moved into a vacant primary school situated at Castlereagh, overlooking Belfast from the south-east, in time for the start of the Easter term. From September 1983 the new first year pupils were taught in the Manor House at Cultra, until a new building became ready in October 1984.\n\nFor the first three years of teaching, Lagan College received no government funding. Parents of pupils contributed what they could afford towards the costs. However over £500,000 still needed to be raised, so an appeal for benefactions by private individuals and charitable trusts was launched to bring the school to the point where it could develop into an economically viable institution. Lagan College gained maintained status in 1984, making the school eligible for full funding from the Department of Education. From this point 100% of running costs were met by the Department of Education and the school governors were responsible for 15% of capital expenditure. The school's first Chairman was Basil McIvor, a former Ulster Unionist MLA and Minister of Community Relations, who was a proponent of integrated education in Northern Ireland.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1987, due to accommodation difficulties, the 98 new first year pupils were taught several miles away from Castlereagh in the Balmoral area of South Belfast, in premises shared with the newly opened Forge Integrated Primary School. A permanent home for Lagan College was eventually found just outside Belfast at Lisnabreeny, thanks to the hospitality of the National Trust. The first temporary buildings were opened at Lisnabreeny in September 1987, however travelling continued between the two areas until September 1991 when the first phase of the permanent school building was opened.\n\nFollowing new legislation in 1989 concerning the development of integrated education by the then Minister, Dr Brian Mawhinney, the College became a Grant-Maintained Integrated School in 1991. As a result, 100% of the costs (recurrent and capital) are now funded directly by the Department of Education for Northern Ireland.\n\nAs of 2010, the first third of the permanent school building is open. Approval for the completion of the permanent buildings was given in 2002 under the Department's private finance initiative at a cost of £11.1 million. It is anticipated that the building programme will begin in 2010. With the current educational climate in Northern Ireland, Lagan College stands among the top post-primary education secondary schools. While its focus has been on integration in terms of religious background, the school also integrates children in an 'all-ability' context. Thus, Lagan College accommodates for children with a variety of academic backgrounds. As of 2010 the college accommodates 50% of its pupil intake, retaining at least those who achieve an A grade in the transfer procedure. With that in focus, Lagan College remains one of Northern Ireland's most oversubscribed schools.\n\nThe school recently opened new buildings, opened in 2014.\n\n\n"}

Alleging that it was an attempt at religious profiling, the daily claimed that 268 email accounts had been subjected to surveillance, out of which 258 belonged to Muslims. None among them had any previous criminal background and there was no clarity as to why they were put under surveillance, the newspaper stated. A probe was ordered after leading Muslim organisations in Kerala demanded Chief Minister Oommen Chandy's explanation in this issue as he is handling the Home Affairs.\n\nChandy said that \"Madhyamam Weekly\" had not published the complete list, and provided the lists after removing the emails of people belonging to other communities. He said the weekly must come clear on this. The investigating officers got 268 mail IDs from a person and they were handed over to the hi-tech cell for tracing the identity, and no hacking attempt was made, he added.\n\nIn accordance with an order from the Ernakulam judicial first magistrate court, on 11 March 2014, Kerala Police registered a case against Madhyamam and other media organizations in response to a petition regarding allegations raised against Mata Amritanandaymayi, accusing them of insulting religious sentiments. \"Madhyamam\" was booked under Sections 153A, 153B, 295A, 298, 120B and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n\"Madhyamam Weekly\" has been a literary and political magazine since 1998. It claims a circulation of 25,000 copies each week. The magazine contains regular columns of prominent writers like Maythil Radhakrishnan (\"Moonnu Vara\"), Viju V Nair (\"Vellezhuthu\"), KEN Kunhahammad (\"Idapedal\") and Babu Bharadwaj (\"Vazhipokkante Vaakkukal\").\n\nIt gave new insight into the murder of Naxal Varghese, a 1970s leader of the CPI (ML) in Kerala during the Emergency of 1975–1977. A penitent policeman in the Kerala Police, Constable Ramachandran Nair dictated a confessional note to M.K. Jayadevan which was later handed over to \"Gro\" Vasu, an erstwhile Naxalite who later published it in \"Madhyamam Weekly\". The letter was then used an important evidence in the Supreme Court of India \"P. Vijayan vs State of Kerala\" case.\n\n"}

The Court held that Aboriginal rights, such as fishing, that were in existence in 1982 are protected under the Constitution of Canada and cannot be infringed without justification on account of the government's fiduciary duty to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada.\n\nRonald Edward Sparrow, a member of the Musqueam Band, was caught fishing with a drift net 45 fathoms (82 m) in length, 20 fathoms (37 m) longer than permitted by the band's fishing licence under the Fisheries Act of 1985. Sparrow admitted to all the facts in the charge but justified it on the ground that he was exercising his Aboriginal right to fish under section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n\nAt trial, the judge found that section 35 protected only existing treaty rights and that there was no inherent right to fish. An appeal to the County Court was dismissed, and a further appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to maintain the defence.\n\nThe issue to the Supreme Court was whether the net length restriction violated s. 35(1).\n\nThe judgment of unanimous Court was given by Chief Justice Brian Dickson and Justice Gérard La Forest. They held that Sparrow was exercising an \"inherent\" Aboriginal right that existed before the provincial legislation and that was guaranteed and protected by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. They interpreted each of the words of section 35(1).\n\n\nThe existence of the aboriginal right to fish was not at serious dispute in this appeal, so this case doesn't elaborate on how to determine whether a right is an aboriginal right. This case instead focused on whether that right was extinguished, whether that right was infringed, and whether that infringement was justified.\n\nThe word \"existing\" in section 35(1), the Court said, must be \"interpreted flexibly so as to permit their evolution over time\". As such, \"existing\" was interpreted as referring to rights that were not \"extinguished\" prior to the introduction of the 1982 Constitution. They rejected the alternate \"frozen\" interpretation referring to rights that were being exercised in 1982. As long as the right had not been extinguished, the \"manner\" in which the right happened to have been regulated prior to 1982. The existing right is not to be narrowed in interpretation based on regulation.\n\nBased on historical records of the Musqueam fishing practices over the centuries and into colonial time, the Court found that the band had a clear right to fish for food.\n\nExtinguishment of rights can occur only through an act that showed \"clear and plain intention\" on the government to deny those rights. Here, the Court found that the Crown was not able to prove that the right to fish for food were extinguished prior to 1982. The licensing scheme was merely a means of regulating the fisheries, not removing the underlying right, and no historical government policy towards fishing rights amounted to a clear intention to extinguish.\n\nThe words \"recognized and affirmed\" incorporate the government's fiduciary duty to the Aboriginal people, which requires it to exercise restraint when applying its powers in interference with Aboriginal rights. It further suggests that Aboriginal rights are not absolute and can be encroached upon given sufficient reason.\n\nIn order to justify a \"prima facie\" infringement, the government needs to demonstrate the following (at p 1119):\n\nAfter the \"Sparrow\" case, federal or provincial legislation may limit Aboriginal rights only if it has given them appropriate priority because Aboriginal rights have a different nature from other non-Aboriginal rights.\n\nThe \"Sparrow test\" has been used by many experts as a way of measuring how much Canadian legislation can limit Aboriginal rights.\n\nTypical cases of inappropriate priority include distributing hunting licences by lottery.\n\n\n"}

He assumed the title after Bob Goodenow resigned on July 28, 2005, but was unanimously fired by the NHLPA on May 10, 2007, after a union-commissioned report concluded Saskin had quarterbacked a campaign to hack into player email accounts.\n\nSaskin had previously served as NHLPA Senior Director of Business Affairs and Licensing since 1992, as one of Goodenow's new deputies when the latter assumed the role of executive director after the forced resignation of Alan Eagleson.\n\nSaskin was credited with taking a more conciliatory approach to collective bargaining agreement negotiations, compared to the hard-line stance of Goodenow, which ended the 2004–05 NHL lockout. Saskin was widely seen as the heir apparent to Goodenow and initially touted as a successor due to his knowledge of the CBA, so he became NHLPA Executive Director in 2005 after Goodenow was forced to step down.\n\nHowever, Saskin's hiring came under scrutiny from some players who felt that he was improperly elected and misrepresented salary figures during negotiations with players union president Trevor Linden, a forward with the Vancouver Canucks. On October 2, 2006, a group of NHL players, led by Chris Chelios filed a lawsuit in US Federal Court to remove Saskin and also millions of dollars in damages and punitive damages. Eventually the lawsuit was dismissed by a judge who ruled that because the NHLPA is based in Toronto, Ontario, that is the appropriate venue for the case.\n\nIn 2007, Saskin and other union executives came under fire for allegedly inappropriately accessing the private email accounts of players and agents who have challenged his hiring.\n\nOn March 11, 2007, Saskin was placed on a paid leave of absence from his position as NHLPA executive director, before being let go on May 10. Saskin, who was in the second year of a five-year contract reportedly worth $10 million US, reportedly received nearly $750,000 US in accrued vacation pay and union shares.\n\nSaskin is a lawyer and practicing in Toronto since 1985.\n"}
{"id": "2333090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333090", "title": "Madisar", "text": "Madisar\n\nThe Madisar or Koshavam () is a typical way in which the sari is worn by Tamil Brahmin women. The sari and the tying style dates back to ancient India, at least as far back as the period between 2nd century BC to 1st century AD when the antariya and uttariya garments were merged to make a single garment. This style of tying the saree is the \"koshavam\" style, (that is going between the legs, in the typical style used by men). Tamil Brahmin women are required to use this style after their marriage. Different communities have evolved different sari styles from the original koshavam style, that requires more material - nine yards. Extant nine-yard sari styles include the nauvari of Maharashtra, the Kannada drape, the Telugu Brahmin style. The name Madisari is however typically associated with Tamil Brahmins, with two sub-styles, the Iyer kattu (tie) and the Iyengar kattu (tie). Today, madisar is hardly worn as daily wear, although women do drape the madisar style on select festive occasions and religious ceremonies. The madisar requires a nine-yard sari to wear it, unlike the current modern version of sari wearing style which needs 6 yards. Both Iyer and Iyengar Brahmins are supposed to wear madisars at ceremonial/ religious occasions, such as the wedding ceremony, the Seemantham (a religious ceremony conducted for a first pregnancy), all religious ceremonies, Puja, and death ceremonies.\n\nIyers and Iyengars wear Madisars differently. Iyers drape the Pallu (the layer of sari which comes over one's shoulder) over the right shoulder while Iyengars wear it over the left shoulder. Conventionally, the first Madisar a woman wears is maroon or red in colour, nowadays Madisar is being worn in other colours according to people's wishes.\n\nMadisars are available in a variety of materials such as silk, cotton, cotton-silk blends, polyester-cotton blends, etc. These days a version of the madisar is also tied using the 6-yard sari. Though not as traditional, it is easier and more convenient to wear.\n"}

Goodrich was largely self-educated, and became an assistant in a country store at Danbury, Connecticut, which he left in 1808, and later again at Hartford, Connecticut, until 1811. From 1816 to 1822 he was a bookseller and publisher in Hartford. He visited Europe from 1823 to 1824, and moved to Boston in 1826. In 1833 he bought in nearby Roxbury and built a home in what is now Jamaica Plain. There he continued in the publishing business, and from 1828 to 1842 published an illustrated annual, \"The Token\", to which he was a frequent contributor both in prose and verse. A selection from these contributions was published in 1841 under the title \"Sketches from a Students Window\". \"The Token\" also contained some of the earliest work of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Nathaniel Parker Willis, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Lydia Maria Child. In 1841 he established \"Merry's Museum\", which he continued to edit till 1854.\nGoodrich was associated with his brother Charles A. Goodrich in writing books for the young. His series, beginning in 1827 under the name of Peter Parley, embraced geography, biography, history, science and miscellaneous tales. Of these he was the sole author of only a few, but in 1857 he wrote that he was the author and editor of about 170 volumes, and that about seven millions had been sold. An English writer, George Mogridge, also used the name Peter Parley, raising objections from Goodrich, who had the prior claim.\nIn 1857 he published \"Recollections of a Lifetime\", which contains a list both of the works of which he was the author or editor and of the spurious works published under his name. By his writings and publications he amassed a large fortune. He was active in Whig politics, and was elected a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1836, and of the state Senate in 1837, his competitor in the last election being Alexander Hill Everett, and in 1851-1853 he was consul at Paris, where he remained till 1855, taking advantage of his stay to have several of his works translated into French. At the end of his consulship, he was presented with a commemorative medal.\n\nHe returned to America and, in 1859, he published \"Illustrated History of the Animal Kingdom\". He died in New York and was buried in Southbury, Connecticut where he lived for a short time. His funeral was widely attended by a vast concourse of persons. Two hundred Sunday School children headed the procession to the cemetery. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds a collection of his papers.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2333096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333096", "title": "Windows Genuine Advantage", "text": "Windows Genuine Advantage\n\nWindows Genuine Advantage (WGA) is an anti-infringement system created by Microsoft that enforces online validation of the licensing of several Microsoft Windows operating systems when accessing several services, such as Windows Update, and downloading Windows components from the Microsoft Download Center. WGA consists of two components: an installable component called \"WGA Notifications\" that hooks into Winlogon and validates the Windows license upon each logon and an ActiveX control that checks the validity of the Windows license when downloading certain updates from the Microsoft Download Center or Windows Update. WGA Notifications covers Windows XP and later, with the exception of Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition. The ActiveX control checks Windows 2000 Professional licenses as well.\n\nIn Windows 7, WGA is renamed Windows Activation Technologies.\n\nDespite its name it does not actually evaluate the integrity or security of any computer.\n\nThe WGA validation process validates the present installation of Windows and its license key against the detected computer hardware and determines if the software was licensed from Microsoft. It is accessible by either a stand-alone program, a Netscape-compatible web browser plug-in, or as an ActiveX control within Internet Explorer, the latter of which is relevant to any attempt to access Microsoft updates via its browser. It includes the following steps:\n\nThe ActiveX control is downloaded on the first validation and when a new version is available, but the validation itself can be performed any time the user connects to a Microsoft Website to update.\n\nOn Windows Vista without service packs, WGA validation failure has a greater impact. In addition to persistent notification and the disabling of non-critical updates, WGA also disables Windows Aero, Windows Defender and Windows ReadyBoost. The user is given a grace period in which to then pass validation, after which most of the operating system is disabled and Windows reverts to \"reduced functionality mode\". This behavior however has been removed in Service Pack 1 of Windows Vista in favor of prominent notices on systems believed unlicensed.\n\nWhen a user installs Windows Genuine Advantage, an Internet Explorer add-on is installed labeled \"Windows Genuine Advantage\". In early releases the tool could be readily disabled with the IE Add-on Management feature. A Windows Group Policy was added by later updates, causing this option to be unavailable by default, but still accessible if the policy were removed. As of July 2006, the latest update blocks management by other means.\n\nThe program uses either a stand-alone program to generate a key or an ActiveX control to discover whether the license key is valid; either way an Internet connection is required. On Windows XP, if WGA determines that a user's copy of Windows is unauthorized but was installed from seemingly legitimate media (i.e., the CD/DVD and holographic emblem present on real copies of Windows seems genuine), then Microsoft will supply the user with a new CD/DVD. However, newer versions of Windows will still require the user to purchase a new copy. Microsoft also offers discounts to people who want to purchase a legitimate copy of Windows but do not have a valid CD. Microsoft has indicated that they will continue to deliver critical security updates through their Automatic Updates service as well as via the Microsoft Download Center, so that all systems, including those that fail to pass validation, will still continue to receive critical security updates.\n\nThe company has made installation of Windows Genuine Advantage a requirement for use of the Windows Update and Microsoft Update websites, in part to be sure that customers who use support resources of the company are aware when their software is unlicensed. According to Microsoft themselves, it is legal to run Microsoft Windows without Windows Genuine Advantage . However, since non-critical Windows updates are not presented by Automatic Updates, installation of WGA is required for installation of such non-critical updates, which are only available through Windows Update or the Microsoft Download Center.\n\nOn April 25, 2006, Microsoft began distributing Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications as \"critical update\" KB905474 to Windows users. For Windows 7, KB971033 has the same function. Back in 2006, users with copies the WGA believed to be unlicensed were exposed to alerts at startup, login, and during use of the Windows OS, stating that they do not have a genuine copy of Windows. Users with legitimate copies are not supposed to see the alerts (although some do anyway). On May 23, 2006, Microsoft updated the program, closing some forms of circumvention, but reportedly not all. It was updated again on May 30, June 6 and June 27, 2006, though some forms of circumvention are still usable. The latest versions do not roll out worldwide at the same time: the dates given are the earliest dates on which the versions appeared, so the actual version being offered in some places will be an earlier version than the latest release. It is still possible to opt out of receiving this update using the \"do not show\" option at the Windows Update site (Windows XP), and the \"Hide\" option in the right-click menu of Windows Update in Control Panel (Windows Vista/7/8). In addition to these notifications, Windows Genuine Advantage will also notify users with the message \"This version of Windows XP is no longer secure\" if users on an XP Operating System are not using Service Pack 3, and it will provide a link to help users to update their systems to the new service pack.\n\nThe version of Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications released November 29, 2006, had a changed install process to inform the user of what the program does, and can also be set to automatically update to newer versions of Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications. It also informs users that may have a non-genuine version of Windows why their Windows version isn't being reported as genuine. However, unlike previous releases, it started being only automatically delivered to Windows machines using four widely distributed product keys.\n\nThe latest update (version 1.9.0040.0) was released on March 24, 2009.\n\nMicrosoft includes the Windows Genuine Advantage Validation Library in several products, such as Windows validation tool or Windows Media Player 11, to check the validation about all Windows software. As of version 7, Internet Explorer no longer requires the user to pass a Windows Genuine Advantage test in order to download or install the software.\n\nThe WGA Validation Library is also included in the Microsoft Security Essentials 2.0 and validate the Windows installation whether it is legitimate or not. The program will stop working after 30 days once it failed the validation process.\n\nThe information is then used in the WGA Library to check for overuse of license keys.\n\nIn September 2005, Microsoft filed lawsuits against a number of companies that sold unauthorized copies of software based on information from users who were told they have copyright infringing software by the Windows Genuine Advantage application.\n\nOn May 4, 2006, Microsoft announced lawsuits for allegedly distributing unauthorized copies of Windows against eDirectSoftware of Montana, and Chicago-area resellers Nathan Ballog and Easy Computers.\n\nSome personal firewalls, though not one embedded in Windows, may alert on the method by which wgatray.exe is started; in the case of Outpost firewall, it is identified as a \"hidden process\". The wgatray.exe process itself can be firewall blocked, without apparent problems.\n\nA tool has been released by a firewall vendor to prevent WGA Notifications transmitting information from one's PC.\n\nThrough Windows Genuine Advantage, Microsoft collects the following data:\n\nOn October 20, 2008, many users of Windows XP in China received a black desktop, as Microsoft introduced its WGA system for Chinese language systems in an effort to combat copyright violation, which is extremely common in China. Since the majority of users in China run an unlicensed copy of Windows, many users have experienced what is described as a \"black screen syndrome\", where the operating system changes the desktop background to a black screen, as well as displays constant warning messages. Some users have even reported the disabling of Office programs such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Outlook.\n\nAccording to various polls carried out by Chinese portals such as Sohu.com, QQ.com, 21cn.com, and many others, a large number (over 60% of those surveyed) of Chinese Internet users are hostile to Microsoft Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) and Office Genuine Advantage (OGA).\n\nEven if WGA does not really make the program unusable, no updates except critical ones can be downloaded from Microsoft. Rather than just disallowing updating, Windows Vista originally ran in reduced-functionality mode if found by WGA to be compromised, which has made some people compare WGA to time bomb software. Windows Vista SP2 has removed this behavior and reverted to the nag-only methods of Windows XP.\n\nThe notification tool has been accused of spyware-like behavior, \"phoning home\" on a daily basis. Microsoft subsequently admitted the behaviour, but denied that it amounted to spyware. Following pressure, Microsoft announced that in future the tool would only phone home once every two weeks, instead of every day. Microsoft has also provided removal instructions for the pilot version of WGA.\n\nDespite this, Microsoft was sued under anti-spyware statutes over WGA's non-disclosed \"phone home\" behaviour. The lawsuit has since been dismissed.\n\nThe WGA program can produce false positives (incorrectly identifying a genuine copy of Windows as \"not genuine\"). This can happen for any number of reasons such as failed updates, etc. Microsoft has established a forum to help users encountering problems. In February 2007, a \"Not Sure\" section was added to the program, in case of an incorrect reading.\n\nAccording to an \"Ars Technica\" editorial, WGA reported around 22% of 500 million Windows computers as failing the test; of these less than 0.5% were due to unauthorized software, with the balance (over 20%, or 90% of all positives) related to edge cases. Microsoft \"refused to comment on the rate of pure false positives\" beyond saying it was \"under 1%\" (or as stated, at most around 5 million users affected).\n\nOn June 18, 2007, news surfaced that it is possible to positively validate as a \"Genuine Microsoft Product\" user (and as a result be able to download certain software from Microsoft's official website) using Internet Explorer with IEs4Linux and Wine, running on Linux, without even having a Windows-family system installed.\n\nOn October 5, 2006, a WGA failure occurred, incorrectly flagging some systems as being non-genuine.\n\nOn August 25, 2007, the Microsoft WGA servers suffered an outage, resulting in many legitimate copies of Windows XP and Vista being marked as counterfeit. The issue was solved about 12 hours later. According to Microsoft, \"fewer than 12,000 systems were affected worldwide.\"\n\nOn July 18, 2008, reports of Microsoft's WGA and OGA servers being offline surfaced again. Microsoft later responded that only offline verification was temporarily down.\n\n\n"}

It lies west of Cheltenham, near the city of Gloucester and close to the M5 motorway. Its operator claims it to be Gloucestershire's largest general aviation airfield.\n\nThe airport is regularly used for private charter flights to destinations such as Jersey and Guernsey. Between 2013 and 2017, Citywing operated scheduled flights from the airport, describing it as \"Gloucester (M5) Airport\" and marketing it as an alternative to Birmingham Airport, Bristol Airport and to a lesser extent Oxford Airport. This was due to the airport's ease of use and fast handling of passengers, compared to its larger counterparts.\n\nAn airfield was opened in 1931, named after the local village of Down Hatherley; the change of name to Staverton followed relocation to the present site. The airfield served as a training base for pilots during the Second World War and was known as RAF Staverton. It was later used by Alan Cobham as he developed in-flight refuelling. A pillbox that was part of the British anti-invasion preparations of the Second World War can still be found opposite the main airfield entrance. With its proximity to Cheltenham, it was also used extensively by the U.S. Army, particularly the Service of Supply and its commanding general, Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee, who was responsible for all supply and administrative functions of U.S. forces in Britain, beginning in May 1942.\n\nAfter the war, what is now Smiths Group used the airport as a test site for various aircraft. At the same time the airport provided scheduled services to the Channel Islands, Dublin and Isle of Man. In the 1960s the Skyfame Museum, dedicated to World War II aircraft, opened.\n\nIn the 1990s, both the Police Aviation Services and Bond Air Services stationed helicopters and their headquarters at Staverton. In 1993, its name was changed to Gloucestershire Airport in an effort to \"...reflect its increasing prominence as the business aviation centre for the county.\"\n\nDuring the 1990s, Staverton was the home of the MidWest production facility where the company manufactured the MidWest AE series of single- and twin-rotor Wankel aero-engines for light aircraft. The twin-rotor engine was first installed into two ARV Super2 aircraft. Midwest was eventually closed down, and its assets bought by Austrian manufacturer Diamond Aircraft Industries.\nIn 2009, Gloucestershire Airport was granted planning permission for expansion, first proposed in 2006, which included lengthening a runway. The plans were controversial and proved divisive amongst the local community and authorities. \n\nOn 14 November 2014, BBC Radio Gloucestershire and its listeners set a new world record for the longest line of cakes, to raise money for Children in Need. Volunteers around the region baked 14,392 cupcakes which were laid in a line at the airport. At about 16:45 GMT, an adjudicator from Guinness confirmed the breaking of the world record which now stands at of cakes. The previous record of was set in Colombia in 2013.\n\nIn March 2015, Gloucestershire Airport announced that it will look to provide more flights, more hangars and more profits in the coming years as part of a new vision for the transport hub. The business plan will see £6million invested in the airport between 2015 and 2025.\n\nMany of the flights to and from the airport are for business purposes, but there are also recreational flights and training flights.\n\nThe airport houses several flying clubs for private pilots including Bristol Aero Club, Cotswold Aero Club and the Staverton Flying School alongside commercial pilot training from \"Aeros\" and 'kyborne Aviation, together with specialist helicopter trainers JK Helicopter Training, who also provide gift/pleasure helicopter flights. People are able to undertake their pilot's licence training at the airport.\n\nExecutive Aviation Services offer type ratings on Cessna Citation business jets, as well as aircraft acquisition, management and business jet charters to a number of destinations in Europe and Scandinavia using Citation Bravos.\n\nThe airport has a pilot shop, and is also home to The Aviator restaurant and bar. There is also a live video camera, aimed on a bearing of 255degrees, just south of due west.\n\nThe majority of Gloucestershire Airport's movements are operated by private aircraft.\n\nCitywing previously flew a minimum of five weekly to the Isle of Man during the winter months and up to 25 times weekly during the summer peak season. The Jersey route was flown three times per month during the peak season between July and September, but was not operated during the winter months. This service ended in March 2017, after the airline was liquidated.\n\n"}

For most of its 115+ year history the building held a glass factory and storage warehouse for Pilkington Glass Company.\n\nThe building later fell into terrible disrepair and became abandoned. In 1989 the property at 100-102 Powell St. was purchased by Bryan Adams.\n\nThe building at 102 Powell was gutted and converted into a parking lot with green space hidden behind a street front facade. The 2nd building, the original Oppenheimer Warehouse on the corner was restored and converted into a three-storey state of the art studio. Importantly, Adams was sure to maintain the building's character and charm by preserving the original brick and beam construction. The project took nearly a decade to complete.\n\nIn 1998, The Warehouse Studio received a City of Vancouver Heritage Award for outstanding restoration of a historic building.\n\nOn the main floor is a large format analog mixing room with a 72 input Solid State Logic G Series console with Total Recall and Black E Series EQ. It also has an isolated recording space and a small lounge and kitchen.\n\nThis console was previously installed in the basement of Bryan Adams' former West Vancouver residence on Mathers Avenue. While he was on tour, Adams would allow other bands to record and mix there until his plan to create a studio complex in the heart of Vancouver could be realized.\n\nLocated on the second floor is the main tracking room. The dimensions of the live room are 32 ft by 58 ft with a 24-ft ceiling and three isolation booths. There is also a lounge area, a long table for dining, full kitchen services, and a small fire escape patio.\n\nThe Neve A6630 installed in Studio 2 is one of the three legendary custom-ordered consoles built for Sir George Martin. Built in 1979, it was installed in AIR Studios London on Oxford Street. It later found a home in Atlantic Studios in New York, until Bryan bought it in 1991. Ron Obvious rebuilt and modded the console and it was installed into Studio 2.\n\nIt is a split console, with 58 channels, 24 busses, and a 32 channel tape monitor panel (58x24x32).

The song was released as a single on January 7, 1997. Although the song was released after the death of lead singer Bradley Nowell, \"Santeria\" along with \"What I Got\" are often considered the band's signature songs.\n\nThe song includes the bassline and guitar riff from Sublime's earlier song \"Lincoln Highway Dub\" off the 1994 album \"Robbin' the Hood\". Santería is an Afro-Cuban religion, practiced in Cuba, South Florida, and exported to other areas in the Caribbean.\n\nThe song tells the story of a jealous ex-boyfriend who is planning to take revenge on the man who stole his girlfriend. The man then decides to find a new girlfriend, instead. However, the man then mentions using violent force as he describes his plans to \"pop a cap in Sancho\" and \"stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat\" if he ever sees him again. The lead singer of Sublime, Bradley Nowell, refers to the man as \"sancho\" and his ex-girlfriend as \"Heina\". In Chicano/a culture, a man who steals another man's girlfriend is often referred to as \"Sancho\" while a man's woman or girlfriend is referred to as \"Heina\", which is adapted from the Spanish word \"reina\", meaning \"queen\" in English.\n\nA music video was filmed after the death of lead singer Bradley Nowell, who makes a cameo via stock footage. During the video, his beloved Lou Dog is seen along with the other members of Sublime remembering him. The video was a visualization of the story told in the song in the form of a Western, and featured Tom Lister, Jr. as Sancho. Tiny Tom Lister Jr. was bitten by Lou Dog on the lip in a particular scene where Tiny gets too close to Lou Dog's face. \n\n\"Santeria\" was a moderate U.S. crossover hit, cracking the Top 5 on \"Billboard\"'s Modern Rock Tracks chart as well as reaching number 43 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. \n\nThe song is a playable track on the 2008 video game \"Guitar Hero World Tour\", and was released as a downloadable song for \"Rock Band 3\" in 2012 as well as \"Rocksmith 2014\" in 2014.

Although sometimes considered part of the urban area of greater Bognor Regis, it is a village and civil parish in its own right, having an area of 4.26 km² with a population of 9,611 people that is still growing (2001 census). The population at the 2011 Census was 9,746.\n\nFelpham lies on the B2259 coastal road.\n\nThe 12th century Anglican parish church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. There is also a Methodist church close to the three-way junction of Felpham Way, Flansham Lane and Middleton Road, in the east of the village.\n\nFelpham was in existence long before Bognor Regis, having been mentioned in the Domesday Book of the 11th century, under the hundred of Binstead: \"St Edward's Abbey [Shaftesbury] holds and held Felpham before 1066...\" \nIts value before 1066 was said to be £10.\nWilliam Blake, introduced to the village by his friend William Hayley, lived in Felpham for three years while writing his \"\". The poem contains his famous words about \"England's green and pleasant land\", today known as the anthem \"Jerusalem\", which were inspired by Blake's \"evident pleasure\" in the Felpham countryside. The cottage where he lived is depicted in the illustrations for the poem. It lies within the original village, close to \"the Fox\" public house. Of the village he wrote:\n\nAway to sweet Felpham for heaven is there:\nThe Ladder of Angels descends through the air\nOn the turrett its spiral does softly descend\nThrough the village it winds, at my cot it does end.\nThe \"turrett\" in the verse is Hayley's house, east of the church, which he built around 1800. It was in Felpham that Blake had his altercation with the drunken soldier John Scofield, who was trespassing in his garden. This led to Blake's trial for sedition because of Scofield's allegation that he had cursed the king. Blake has a road named after him, Blake's Road, the road on which his former residence is sited, and a memorial window dedicated to him in St Mary's Church.\n\nBlake's host, Hayley, was also famous in his day for having turned down the offer of the position of poet laureate in 1790.\n\nThe village has a village hall, called the Memorial Hall, built in remembrance to the fallen from the First World War and a church community hall called St Mary's Centre.\n\nDue to the 1960’s redevelopment Peartree Cottage, in Vicarage Lane, is now the oldest house in Felpham. It is Late Medieval (c1500), four bay, timber-framed thatched Yeoman’s house with queen struts and clasped side purlins. It had an open first bay, (probably a workshop) and still has an intact smoke bay. In the 1700s the house was 'modernised' with the insertion of a chimney built within the smoke bay and three exterior walls replaced with flint with rubble infill. Peartree has a small Victorian extension faced with galleted knapped flint. Two small bays were added to the south face of the house in the early 1900s. \nIn the 1940s the house was owned by the Jagger family, namely David Jagger (1891-1958). He and his siblings, Edith Jagger (1880-1977) and Charles Sargeant Jagger (1885-1934) were all celebrated artists. Charles’s best friend was fellow artist Augustus John (1878 - 31 October 1961) who may well have visited Peartree because carved into one of the sagging jowl posts is the image of a bearded man who looks uncannily like the young Augustus John\n\nGreat expansion of the village took place between 1930 and 1960 when three (nominally) gated housing estates were developed, and again in the 1970s when two public housing developments took place on farmland between Felpham and its neighbouring village of Middleton-on-Sea. In December 2006 planning permission was granted for further development, this time on farmland to the north.\n\nFelpham has three primary schools, Bishop Tufnell CE Infant and Bishop Tufnell CE Junior Schools (both Church of England Aided Schools) and Downview Primary (Infant and Junior) School. A third infant and junior school is planned to be added as part of the current housing plans.\n\nFelpham Community College, the main school in the area, operates its own youth wing. It is situated next door to the Arun Leisure Centre which has extensive playing fields.\n\nFelpham has a recreation ground, King George's Field, named after King George V.\n\nFelpham Colts Football Club (including mixed teams, boys' teams and girls' teams) is the largest youth football club in West Sussex. It has 26 teams competing in local football leagues and has been in existence since 1973. The club's teams can be found training at King George V Field on Saturday mornings and playing at Shrubbs Field in nearby Middleton-on-Sea and King George V Field on Sundays. In the early 2010s a men's team was started and has gone on to win a number of promotions, currently playing in the West Sussex Football League Division Two South, with the reserve team playing three divisions below in Division Five South. Like the youth teams, their home ground is the King George V Playing Field.\n\nPredators Youth started in 1994 with only a few players and has grown to 14 youth teams a women's team and a successful adults team.

{"id": "2333127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333127", "title": "Rose Terry Cooke", "text": "Rose Terry Cooke\n\nRose Terry Cooke (February 17, 1827 – July 18, 1892) was an American author and poet. Some of her earliest contributions were published in \"Putnam's Magazine\"; and the \"Atlantic Monthly\", in which she wrote the leading story in the first number; then in the \"Galaxy\", published in Philadelphia; and in \"Harper's\". A very popular story by Cooke was \"The Deacon's Week\". Her short stories of New England life would fill several volumes. Cooke's dream was that of developing her powers of poetry. Her first verses were printed in the New York \"Tribune\", using her mother's initials for a pseudonym.\n\nRose Terry was born in a farm house on February 17, 1827, in West Hartford, Connecticut. Her mother was Anne Wright Hurlbut, the daughter of John Hurlbut of Wethersfield, Connecticut, the first New England shipmaster who sailed round the world. He left his daughter an orphan when she was nine years old; and she grew up with a morbid conscience. She married Henry Wadsworth Terry, the son of Nathaniel Terry, president of a Hartford Bank, and for some time a United States Representative from Connecticut. Henry Wadsworth Terry was a social favorite, sensitive, generous, and open-hearted. On his mother's side, he belonged to the old Wadsworth stock, from which the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow descended, his immediate ancestor in this country having been the Hon. William Wadsworth; and his uncle, several times removed, having been that Joseph Wadsworth who stole the Charter Oak, and who had a descendant, General Alfred Terry of Fort Fisher and Pulaski notability, the cousin of Rose. There was one younger sister.\n\nHer father educated her in outdoor studies, familiarizing her with birds, bees, and flowers. The mother taught Cooke to read before she was three years old, and at age six, she was studying Walker's Rhyming Dictionary, columns of which had to be learned with their definitions, and compositions written including the words learned. With such an exacting mother, Cooke kept a diary from the age of six to ten, which was preserved at least through adulthood. The dictionary process produced such sentences as: \"To-day I imbued my fingers with the blood of cherries!\" Cooke was a delicate child, owing to an early illness, which was so severe that for a time, it was thought she would die. It was possibly for that reason that she was encouraged to spend time outdoors. She was an exceedingly sensitive child, too, and her imagination was by no means dwarfed by the servants who told her ghost stories, the most noted of these servants being Athanasius, a Greek boy who escaped from the Turkish massacre.\n\nAfter her father lost his property in the Morus Multicaulis Speculation, the family moved to Hartford, taking up their residence in a large brick mansion built in 1799 by Colonel Jeremiah Wadsworth for his daughter, who had married Nathaniel Terry. When Cooke was about ten, she was sent to the Hartford Female Seminary where she asked to be admitted to a special class considered far beyond her grade level, being instruction in literature and composition given by the principal, John P. Brace. Brace had been an instructor in the school where Cooke's mother received her education. While at the Hartford Female Seminary, \"For her own entertainment [Cooke] wrote poems and dramas for her friends\". She graduated in 1843, at the age sixteen.\n\nIn that same year, she joined the Congregational Church. Both parents raised Cooke in the severest puritanical habits and absolutely restricted her from the company of young men. But that did not prevent the feelings of youth, suppressed in real life, from overflowing into printed verse.\n\nImmediately after graduation, Cooke began to teach in Hartford, although she did not remain there for long. She then took a position in a Presbyterian church school in Burlington, New Jersey. In the fourth year there, she became a governess in the family of the clergyman, William Van Rensselaer. After a while, feeling the need there was of her at home, she returned to Hartford and began her literary life. \n\nTerry's first published poem appeared in the \"New York Daily Tribune\" in 1851 and received high praise from the editor Charles A. Dana. In 1855, she published \"The Mormon's Wife\" in \"Graham's Magazine\", of which Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward wrote that it \"dealt powerfully with the leprosy of Mormonism, and wrung from the heart tears dried only by the heat of indignation,\" and interpreted the story as early evidence of Cooke's \"intuitions of genius... a genius [which] became the ultimate expression of generations of hard Puritan ancestry.\" This was followed by a piece for the \"Atlantic Monthly\", the leading story in the first number. Around 1858, when Rose was about twenty-nine her idolized sister Alice, younger than herself by nearly five years, married; and in the delicate state of this sister's health her two children became the care and delight of Cooke. In 1860, she published a volume of poems, and in 1888, she published more verse with her \"Complete Poems\".\n\nAmong those who admired the short stories of Miss Rose Terry was a young banker named Rollin S. Cooke, who lived in Winsted, Connecticut. His recreation was in the reading of them, and he looked forward to a new story from Miss Terry with intense delight. He became cashier of the local bank at the place where Miss Terry lived so that he was enabled not only to admire her stories, but to admire her in person as well. She was considerably older than he was, but that seemed the more to fascinate Rollin. Those living in Winsted saw the gentleness, chivalry, and admiration which characterized his courtship manner and gallantry. More than the making of money did the literary reputation of his wife give him satisfaction. And he took greater pleasure in hearing her praises sounded than she did herself. She was forty-three when she met Rollin in 1872 at Winsted, and married him April 16, 1873. At some point, he was an iron manufacturer of Litchfield County, Connecticut. They made their home in Winsted and in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.\n\nIt was after her marriage that she became best known for her fresh and humorous stories. Her chief volumes of fiction dealing mainly with New England country life were \"Happy Dodd: or, She Hath Done What She Could\" (1878), \"Somebody's Neighbors\" (1881), \"Root-bound and Other Sketches\" (1885), \"The Sphinx's Children and Other People's\" (1886), \"No: A Story for Boys\" (1886), \"Steadfast\" (1889) and \"Huckleberries Gathered From the New England Hills\" (1891). Cooke was a contributor to \"Putnam's Magazine\", \"Atlantic Monthly\", \"Galaxy\", and \"Harper's\". She considered \"The Deacon's Week\" one of the best of her short stories. \"The Two Villages,\" her best-known poem, was inspired by the view from the home of her brother-in-law, Howard Collins. Located on Torrington Avenue in the industrial town of Collinsville, the home overlooked both the Collins Company axe factory (where the \"fires\" of the poem would \"gleam from the smithy's door\") and the cemetery on the hillside behind the factory. A plaque on Torrington Avenue marks this spot.\n\nThere were at least five attempts to impersonate Cooke. The first of these appeared in a Pennsylvania town with a woman who claimed there that she had written everything ever published under Rose Terry's name, that the name was a \"nom de plume\" any way, the name of a little cousin of hers who died young, her uncle, the child's father, allowing her to use it. This person aroused a wild religious excitement among the young people of the place, fell into hysteric trances on hearing sacred music, and made herself generally adored and followed. As irritating as this was, she further stated that she had received from these writings of hers, and had used it all in educating poor girls. After a time, Harriet Beecher Stowe received a note from the lady with whom this pretender boarded, which ran, —\"dear Madam,—I call upon you to silence the base reports spread about here concerning a lovely Christian woman at present staying with me. A line from you, stating that she is the author of the works written under the signature of Rose Terry will stop the rumors at once, and much oblige yours truly.\" Stowe immediately responded that she had known Rose Terry from her birth, and that she was then, and had been for many years, living in Hartford, and the other person was an impostor. Years afterward, this deceiver came to Rose Terry's home town, established herself there as one of the leaders in religious and charitable matters, told someone that she had written much under Rose's name, told someone else that she had a year from the \"Atlantic Monthly,\" and marked several of the best poems in a religious collection as her own, the publisher positively denying her statement when asked about it. This peculiar individual held a trusted position in a city charity, and lived in a wealthy family as a guide, although the truth was told to her clientele, who persisted in regarding her as a persecuted saint.\n\nThe next impersonation was made by a lady on a railroad train, who made acquaintance with the sister of a friend of Rose's, the sister never happening to have seen Rose. She informed her that she was Rose Terry, that she was going abroad to write a book, and various other items of her literary affairs, of which Rose herself was never in the habit of speaking to casual acquaintances, having an old-fashioned predilection for modesty. Number three of these replicas simply offered her services in a New York Sunday school, and having registered this name of her fancy, never appeared. Number four, however, very soon replaced her, making her avatar at a hotel in New York and confiding the fact of the authorship of certain sentimental, romantic, and humorous stories and verses to a Southern lady who then betrayed her. As for number five, it was at a meeting of an acquaintance of Rose's in the cars on the way from Hartford. She inquired if she lived there, and then if she knew Rose, and then proceeded to give quite a circumstantial account of her own intimacy with the object of her remark. On reaching New York, she left the train at the upper station, having also stolen the pocketbook of Rose's Hartford acquaintance.\n\nShe died at Pittsfield on July 18, 1892.\n\nCooke wrote subtle metaphysical reveries as \"My Tenants,\" and \" Did I?\" as well as bits of poetic romance, and a succession of stories of New England life. She was particularly happy in her delineations of rustic New England life. One of these tales, entitled \"Mrs. Flint's Married Experience,\" setting forth the \"closeness\" of the average farmer nature, was severely criticised as overdone, but its correctness was proven by recourse to certain records in town and church books, which exhibited just such a state of facts existing in the life history of certain people in the town of Torringford, Connecticut.\n\nThe verses \"Samson Agonistes,\" \"Fremont's Ride,\" and \"After the Camanches,\" demonstrate the writer's patriotism, politics, and lively interest in the questions of the day. Her religious feeling is found in the \"Bell Songs\" and in \"Prayer\"; and her sympathy with the human heart is noted in \"At Last,\" and in \"The Two Villages\". There is a tremendous vigor and vivid picturesqueness in her poems of \"Semele\" and \"The Suttee,\" which contain weird phases of passion. \"In The Hospital,\" \"Done For,\" and \"Lost on the Prairie,\" were the pioneers of the Border ballad.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is dominated by large, older homes built before 1900, and its streets are shaded by spreading oak and elm trees.\n\nOne of the first Europeans to settle the area was Francis Lovelace, the second governor of the New York colony, who in 1668 started farming in the area that would become Livingston. An earlier name for the district was Elliotville, after a renowned ophthalmologist, Samuel Mackenzie Elliott, who by 1840 had acquired more than 30 homes in the community. The present name of Livingston was coined by officials of the Staten Island Railway who bought the mansion of resident Anson Livingston and then gave that name to a station built near the current intersection of Richmond Terrace and Bard Avenue. This station was situated on the now-defunct North Shore branch of the railway, on which passenger service ceased in 1953; the tracks on this branch are still there, but all traces of the Livingston station have been removed, as is the case with the two other former stations on either side (Sailors' Snug Harbor and West Brighton).\n\nLivingston was formerly served by the North Shore Branch of the Staten Island Railway at Livingston, before it was closed. Livingston is now served by two pairs of bus routes: the , as well as the .\n\nRobert Gould Shaw was a resident of Livingston as were many abolitionists in the 19th century. Several of the 19th century homes, especially those along Davis and Pelton Avenues, were part of the Underground Railroad and have remnants such as hiding places. George William Curtis, who married Shaw's sister Anna, was also a resident.\n\nLivingston was a filming location for movies such as \"School of Rock\" and \"A Beautiful Mind\", which was filmed on Kissel Avenue. The neighborhood was also used for the television program \"The Education of Max Bickford\".\n"}
{"id": "2333138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333138", "title": "Manchester Terrier", "text": "Manchester Terrier\n\nThe Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog of the smooth-haired terrier type. It was first bred in the 19th century to control vermin, notably rats, at which it excelled. So efficient at the task was it that it often appeared in rat-baiting pits until that sport, which had effectively been illegal in the UK since 1835, finally died out at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe breed is generally healthy, although dogs can be affected by several inheritable genetic disorders. A crash in the number of registered Manchester Terriers following the Second World War has resulted in the Kennel Club categorising it as a vulnerable native breed, in danger of extinction.\n\nThe Manchester Terrier closely resembles the Black and Tan Terrier, the oldest known breed of terrier, from which it was developed. Writing in the early 16th century, John Caius describes a Manchester-terrier type of dog in \"De Banibus Britannicis\", and at the beginning of the 19th century Sydenham Edwards described what he called a Manchester Terrier in his \"Cynographia Britannica\".\n\nThe Black and Tan Terrier had an almost legendary status as a rat killer, an ability that was much prized in overcrowded and rat-infested cities such as 19th-century Manchester. The sport of rat baiting, in which a terrier was thrown into an enclosure filled with rats, and timed to see how long it took the dog to kill them all, had become popular by the early 19th century along with rabbit coursing. In an effort to produce a dog that could excel at both sports, the breeder John Hulme decided to cross a Black and Tan Terrier with a Whippet. Similar dogs were bred in various other parts of England, but by 1860 Manchester had become the breed centre for these new terriers, and so they became known as Manchester Terriers. Other breeds, including the Italian Greyhound and the Dachshund, may also have been introduced into the bloodline.\n\nThe Manchester Terrier gained the nickname of the Gentleman's Terrier in Victorian times, because of its dignified demeanour.\n\nBy the early 19th century a closer facsimile to the current Manchester terrier had evolved. In \"The Dog in Health and Disease\" by J. A. Walsh, a full chapter was devoted to the black and tan, for the first time recognising it as an established breed. The description given by Walsh is still relevant: Smooth haired, long tapering nose, narrow flat skull, eyes small and bright, chest rather deep than wide, only true colour black and tan.\n\nSome terrier breeds have a reputation for being \"stoic and dour\", but such terms do not apply to the intelligent and inquisitive Manchester Terrier, who is as \"feisty and affectionate\" as he is \"courageous and tough\", and makes a \"loyal, eager-to-please\" companion. The American Temperament Test Society reports a test pass rate of 87.1 per cent for Manchester Terriers; the average pass rate for all breeds is 80.4 per cent.\n\nThe Canadian and American Kennel Clubs recognise two varieties of Manchester Terrier, the original and a miniaturised variant, the Toy Manchester Terrier. The latter was recognised as a separate breed by the American Kennel Club in 1938, and is still considered to be a separate breed by the British Kennel Club, the English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan). Where the Manchester Terrier may have button ears, erect ears, or cropped ears, the Toy Manchester Terrier only has erect ears. Other than the size difference and ear type, the Manchester Terrier and the Toy Manchester Terrier have the same overall appearance. Since 1958 the American Kennel Club has considered both to be varieties of the same breed.\n\nAccording to the Kennel Club's Purebred Health Survey, carried out in 2004, the Manchester Terrier has a median lifespan of around 12 years 10 months. Slightly more than 31 per cent of the animals whose deaths were reported in the survey died of old age. There are some recognised health problems in the breed associated with inheritable genetic mutations.\n\nGlaucoma is a fairly common genetic condition in several breeds of terrier, including the Manchester Terrier. Secondary glaucoma, also known as lens luxation, is caused by excessive pressure within the eyeball forcing the lens of the eye out of alignment. The only effective treatment for this condition is surgical removal of the lens.\n\nAlso known as cutaneous aesthenia, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome is a group of connective tissue disorders caused by a mutation in one of a number of different genes. Signs of the condition include excessive elasticity of the skin, thinness of the skin and a corresponding propensity to be cut easily.\n\nVon Willebrands disease is a blood-clotting disorder that affects humans and several breeds of dog, including the Manchester Terrier. The genetic mutation occurs in both the standard and toy varieties, but is seen more commonly in the toy. In the Manchester Terrier the gene is autosomal recessive, meaning that for any offspring to be affected the faulty gene must be carried by both parents. Affected dogs are prone to nose bleeds and bleeding from the gums. DNA tests are available to check for the condition, and the Kennel Club maintains a register of the results of those tests, allowing breeders to avoid breeding from affected dogs.\n\nAt the end of the Second World War in 1945 there were only 11 Manchester Terriers registered with the Kennel Club, but thanks to the efforts of the British Manchester Terrier Club, formed in 1937, and others, the breed was saved from extinction. The Kennel Club has nevertheless classified the Manchester Terrier as a vulnerable native breed. Between 2010 and 2016, the last year for which data is available, an average of 164 births per year were registered.\n\n\n"}

Written by Gary Valentine and Debbie Harry for the band's self-titled debut album, \"Blondie\", the song was released as the album's lead single on Private Stock in June 1976.\n\nThe title of the song was originally \"Sex Offender\". Bassist Gary Valentine originally wrote the song about an 18-year-old boy being arrested for having sex with his younger girlfriend. Debbie Harry changed the lyrics so that the song was about a prostitute being attracted to the police officer that had arrested her. The track was co-produced by Richard Gottehrer who had worked with 1960s girl group The Angels, and the song is reminiscent of that era in its style.\n\nPrivate Stock insisted that the name of the single be changed to \"X Offender\" because they were nervous about the original title. It was released in mid-1976 with the B-side being \"In the Sun\". While the song did not chart, Chrysalis heard it along with the \"Blondie\" album and signed the band. \"X Offender\" later served as the B-side to \"Rip Her to Shreds\". Due to limited copies of the single being released and the subsequent popularity of the band, a copy of the original UK Private Stock single \"X Offender\"/\"In the Sun\" is a sought-after rarity with copies selling for £750 in collectors' markets since the mixes of both songs on the single are different from those on the \"Blondie\" album. These mixes appear as bonus tracks on EMI/Capitol Records' 2001 re-issue of the album. Unfortunately, no master tapes of the Private Stock versions have been kept in the archives; consequently, these bonus tracks are direct transfers from vinyl.\n\nMusic videos were produced for both \"X Offender\" and \"In the Sun\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was \"one of Turkey's few internationally known photographers\".\n\nGüler was born in Beyoğlu, Istanbul, Turkey, in 1928 to Armenian parents. He studied at the local Getronagan Armenian High School. Owner of a pharmacy on Istiklal Avenue, his father had a wide circle of friends from the art world of the period. Ara Güler's early contact with this world inspired him to embark on a career in cinema. During his high school years, he jobbed in movie studios and attended drama courses held by Muhsin Ertuğrul, the founder of modern Turkish theater. However, he abandoned cinema in favor of journalism, joining the staff of the newspaper \"Yeni Istanbul\" as photojournalist in 1950 and studying economics at the University of Istanbul at the same time. He then transferred to another newspaper, \"Hürriyet\". (Güler is not related to the royal Guleria family.)\n\nIn 1958, the American magazine company \"Time–Life\" opened a branch in Turkey, and Güler became its first correspondent for the Near East. Soon he received commissions from \"Paris Match, Stern,\" and \"The Sunday Times in London.\" After completing his military service in 1961, Güler was employed by the Turkish magazine \"Hayat\" as head of its photographic department.\n\nAbout this time, he met Henri Cartier-Bresson and Marc Riboud, who recruited him for the Magnum Photos agency, which he joined (though later withdrew from). He was presented in the British \"1961 Photography Yearbook.\" Also in that year, he was accepted as the only Turkish member to the American Society of Magazine Photographers (ASMP) (today called the American Society of Media Photographers). The Swiss magazine \"Camera\" honored him with a special issue.\n\nIn the 1960s, Güler's photographs were used to illustrate books by notable authors and were displayed at various exhibitions throughout the world. His works were exhibited in 1968 in \"10 Masters of Color Photography\" at the New York Museum of Modern Art and at Photokina Fair in Cologne, Germany. His book \"Türkei\" was published in Germany in 1970. His photos on art and art history were used in \"Time,\" \"Life,\" \"Horizon\" and \"Newsweek\" and publications of Skira of Switzerland.\n\nGüler traveled on assignment to Iran, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Kenya, New Guinea, Borneo, as well as all parts of Turkey. In the 1970s he photographed politicians and artists such as Indira Gandhi, Maria Callas, John Berger, Bertrand Russell, Willy Brandt, Alfred Hitchcock, Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham, Marc Chagall, Salvador Dalí and Pablo Picasso. Some critics consider his most renowned photographs to be his melancholic black and white pictures taken mostly with a Leica camera in Istanbul, mainly in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nHe has exhibited frequently since then, and also had his work published in special supplements. International publishers have featured his photographs.\n\nGüler's work is collected by the National Library of France in Paris; the George Eastman Museum in Rochester, New York; University of Nebraska-Lincoln Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery; Museum Ludwig Köln, and Das imaginäre Photo-Museum, Köln.\n\nIn the 1970s, Güler worked in film, directing the documentary \"The End of the Hero\" (1975). It was based on a fictional account of the dismantling of the World War I veteran battlecruiser \"TCG Yavuz.\"\n\nGüler's archive contains some 800,000 photographic slides.\n\nGüler attached the greatest importance to human presence in his photographs and described himself as a \"visual historian\". \"\"When I'm taking a picture of Aya Sofia, what counts is the person passing by who stands for life\"\", he said. He believed that photography should provide a memory of people, of their lives and especially their suffering. While he considers that art lies, he believes that photography can only reflect reality. He embraced the identity of a photojournalist because he did not attach much value to photography as an artistic pursuit, which to him would have little value. He did not consider photography to be an art.\n\nGüler died of a heart attack on 17 October 2018. He had been suffering from kidney failure and was being treated with dialysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was scrapped in 1931.\n\n\"Wood\" was the first Navy ship named for Navy Surgeon-General William M. Wood (1809–1880). She was laid down on 23 January 1919 at San Francisco, California, by the Union Iron Works plant of the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 28 May 1919; sponsored by Mrs. George Kirkland Smith, the granddaughter of William Maxwell Wood; reclassified DD-317 on 17 July 1920; and commissioned at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, on 28 January 1921, Lieutenant Commander Paul M. Bates in command.\n\nFollowing commissioning, \"Wood\" underwent her trials before mooring at the Santa Fe docks, San Diego, California, where she remained as part of the \"rotating reserve\" into the summer of 1921. The new destroyer then spent the ensuing months, into the late spring of 1922, operating off the coast of southern California on drills and exercises, off the port of San Pedro, and the Coronado Islands.\n\nAt the end of that period of activity in June 1922, \"Wood\" shifted northward and reached Seattle, Washington, on 1 July 1922. She spent 4 July there before visiting Port Angeles, Washington, with the fleet, for exercises and maneuvers. She then conducted tactical drills and exercises in the Pacific Northwest, touching at Tacoma, Port Angeles, Bellingham, and Seattle before departing Port Angeles on 2 September, bound for Mare Island.\n\nAfter taking on board ammunition at Mare Island on 5 September and 6 September, \"Wood\" put to sea, bound for San Diego, California, for a machinery overhaul. Upon completion of those repairs, the destroyer rejoined the fleet for rehearsals for short range battle practices. She then operated on various trials into November.\n\nOver the next nine and a half years, \"Wood\" operated with the Battle Fleet in an active role, while many of her sisters lay in \"Red Lead Row\" awaiting the call to active service. Breaking her local operations off the west coast, \"Wood\" participated in Fleet Problems I through IX — the large scale fleet exercises that were held once a year (except in 1924, when three were held) involving most of the Fleet's active units. During the course of those maneuvers, she ranged from the Caribbean to the Panama Canal and from Hawaii to the coast of Central America. She also ventured as far north as the coast of Alaska.\n\nA highlight of \"Wood\"'s service in the autumn of 1925 was the cruise with the fleet to Australia as part of Destroyer Division 34. The destroyer subsequently took part in the search for the downed PN-9 flying boat. In March 1927, during one of the phases of Fleet Problem VII, \"Wood\" participated in the search for survivors from the lost German steamship \"Albatros\" and later that same year, from 27 June to 16 July, \"Wood\" supported American peace-keeping forces ashore on Nicaragua.\n\nDecommissioned at San Diego on 31 March 1930, \"Wood\" was struck from the Navy list on 22 July. Her hulk was then sold for scrap on 14 November 1930.\n\nAs of 2005, no other ship in the United States Navy has been named \"Wood\". \"Exchequer\" was laid down in 1942; renamed \"Wood\" in October 1942, but renamed prior to commissioning.\n\n\n"}

Her siblings included King John III of Portugal and Holy Roman Empress Isabella. She was educated under the supervision of her governess Elvira de Mendoza.\n\nIn Villefranche-sur-Mer on 8 April 1521, Beatrice married Charles III, Duke of Savoy.

When Christina was widowed in 1535, the Milanese Count Stampa suggested a marriage between Christina and the eldest son of Beatrice, Louis, the heir of Savoy, in an attempt to protect Milan from Imperial sovereignty. Beatrice supported the plan, and when Louis died, she suggested that her next son could replace him. Nothing more was heard of this, however. In April 1536, Beatrice fled from the French conquest of Savoy to Christina in Milan in the company of two of her two eldest surviving children and the Shroud of Turin from Chambéry. In May, she was able to visit the Emperor with Christina in Pavia, but without any political result. She then lived as a guest with Christina in Milan, with whom she was good friends.

It is made from turmeric or any other local materials. The turmeric is dried and powdered with a bit of slaked lime, which turns the rich yellow powder into a red color. \n\nIn India, it is known by many names including \"kuṅkumam\" (Sanskrit कुङ्कुमम्), \"kumkuma\" (Telugu కుంకుమ), \"kunku\" (Marathi कुंकू), \"kumkum\" (Bengali কুমকুম, Hindi कुमकुम), \"kunkuma\" (Kannada ಕುಂಕುಮ), \"kungumam\" (Tamil குங்குமம்), and \"kuṅkumam\" (Malayalam കുങ്കുമം).\n\nKumkuma is most often applied by Indians to the forehead. The reason has to do with the ancient Indian belief that \"the human body is divided into seven vortices of energy, called chakras, beginning at the base of the spine and ending at the top of the head. The sixth chakra, also known as the third eye, is centered in the forehead directly between the eyebrows and is believed to be the channel through which humankind opens spiritually to the Divine\".\n\nThus, the kumkuma is placed where Indians believe to be the most important spot for receptivity to be enhanced.\n\n\nIn the Vaishnava tradition, the \"white lines represent the footprint of their God, while the red refers to his consort, Lakshmi\". The Swaminarayana tradition holds that the tilaka (yellow U-shaped mark) \"is a symbol of the lotus feet of Paramatma,\" and the kumkuma \"represents the bhakta\" (devotee). In both of these traditions, the forehead mark serves as a reminder that a devotee of God should always remain as a servant at the feet of God.\n\nThe 'color' of the womb is yellow and is symbolically represented by turmeric. The blood stains on the womb is represented by kumkuma. It is believed that the combination of turmeric and kumkuma represents prosperity.\n\nWhen a girl or a married woman visits a house, it is a sign of respect (in case of an elderly lady) or blessings (in case of a girl) to offer kumkuma to them when they leave. However, it is not offered to widows.\n\nMen, women, girls, and boys also apply a dot on their forehead of red turmeric powder, when visiting a temple or during a pooja. Kumkuma at temples is found in heaps. People dip their thumb into the heap and apply it on the forehead or between the eyebrows.\n\nIn most of India, married women apply red kumkuma to the parting of their hair above their forehead every day as a symbol of marriage. This is called vermilion, or in Hindi, \"sindoor\". In southern India, many unmarried girls wear a bindi every day unlike northern India where it is only worn as a symbol of marriage.\n\nKumkum is made from turmeric by adding limestone and is an Ayurvedic facial material along with turmeric.\n\nKumkuma is also widely used for worshiping the Hindu goddesses, especially Shakti and Lakshmi, and a kumkuma powder is thrown (along with other mixtures) into the air during Holi (the Festival of Colours), a popular Hindu spring festival.\n\n\n"}

Since his retirement from football, he has been mainly an Australian rules football media personality, featuring on television, radio and in newspapers. He has also coached during the International Rules Series.\n\nLyon, the son of former Hawthorn player Peter Lyon, was born in Devonport, Tasmania. In his youth he moved to Victoria, where he attended Melbourne High School.\n\nLyon was recruited from the Kyabram Football Club and debuted in 1986 with the Melbourne Football Club, playing in the 1988 VFL Grand Final. He quickly became a dominant player in the Victorian Football League (VFL), later renamed the Australian Football League (AFL), winning his first Melbourne best and fairest award in 1990. He became Melbourne's captain in 1991 and eventually became the longest-serving Melbourne captain in club history until he was released from the role after the 1997 season due to the club's belief that he would suffer from too many injuries. Lyon was known for playing with many back injuries and his presence on the field despite such adversity saw him as an inspiration to teammates.\n\nLyon finished his career having won two Melbourne best and fairest awards and being named in three All-Australian teams. His career ended as a result of increasing back problems. A broken leg, footage of which is often played on \"The AFL Footy Show\", ended his 1987 season. In the end he finished with 226 VFL/AFL games and 426 goals in 1999, third best all-time for a Melbourne player.\n\nLyon had a successful State of Origin career for Victoria, first being selected in 1988 against Western Australia. In 1989 he played in a famous game against South Australia, where Tony Lockett, Jason Dunstall and Dermott Brereton all played in the same forward line, performing well being named in the best players. In 1991 Lyon scored one goal against South Australia. He was selected again in 1992 against the same opposition. In 1993 he performed on the big stage in the State of Origin Carnival grand final against South Australia, kicking three goals and being named in the best players. In 1994 he was named Captain of Victoria, in what he has described as \"a great honour\". In 1995 he was named vice-captain against South Australia, scoring one goal. Lyon is a big supporter of Victoria and State of Origin and has said in reference to playing State of Origin that he \"loved it\". He is also a big supporter of State of Origin being reintroduced, and has described training and playing with the best players in the game as a \"dream come true\" and \"it took the experience of playing football to another level\". He has said that the great players of today should be afforded the same honour.\n\nLyon's radio career began in the late 1990s on 3AW, and in 2004 he hosted \"Morning Glory\" on SEN 1116. In 2005 he returned to 3AW, and appeared on \"Sports Today\" as well as providing special comments for the station's AFL coverage. In 2007, Lyon moved to Triple M where he provided special comments on Friday Night and Saturday afternoon matches until the end of 2015.\nLyon became a regular panelist on \"The AFL Footy Show\" late in his playing career. In 2006, alongside James Brayshaw, he took the hosting reins of the program after Eddie McGuire became CEO of the Nine Network. Previously he had worked alongside Brayshaw on \"The Sunday Footy Show\" and in 2005 on \"Any Given Sunday\", as well as being a presenter of the Melbourne Commonwealth Games 2006 coverage on Nine. In 2007 he became a panelist on the program \"Footy Classified\".\n\nLyon is a columnist for \"The Age\" newspaper and has co-authored children's books, including those in the \"Specky Magee\" series with Felice Arena.\n\nIn 2018, Lyon ended his long association with the Nine Network and joined Fox Footy as a commentator and co-host on On The Couch\n\nSince his retirement, Lyon has dabbled in coaching. He has coached the Australian international rules football team debuting in 2001 and remained coach for four successive seasons before being replaced by Kevin Sheedy. His International rules record remains as two heavy losses and two narrow wins.\n\nDespite being touted as a potential Melbourne Football Club coach, Lyon has vowed not to re-enter senior coaching. In 2009, he coached the Victorian under 16 representative side at the AFL championships.\n\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1986\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1987\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1988\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1989\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1990\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1991\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1992\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1993\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1994\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1995\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1996\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1997\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1998\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1999\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 226\n! 426\n! 277\n! 2656\n! 898\n! 3554\n! 1103\n! 315\n! 1.9\n! 1.2\n! 11.8\n! 4.0\n! 15.7\n! 4.9\n! 1.5\n\nAustralian cricketer Nathan Lyon is nicknamed \"Garry\", after Garry Lyon.\n\n"}

{"id": "2333211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333211", "title": "Student marketing", "text": "Student marketing\n\nStudent marketing refers to the promotion of products, brands and ideas to the 3 million+ higher and further education student population. Student marketing is generally realised through student media or ambient marketing on campuses.\n\nStudent marketing is not the same as Student Union Marketing which concentrates on marketing opportunities only through Student Union, Association and Guild media. This type of media is powered through companies who provide media services for student union bodies as well as the production of their newspapers and website systems. Youth marketing companies that influence student buying behaviour and motivate student spending utilise a variety of mediums and marketing channels to effectively talk to the youth.\n\nMarketing material directed at students must overcome several problems: they have little money; they are a transient population who will soon graduate, cease to be students, and possibly move away; and they tend to be a skeptical audience critical towards marketing messages and fake attempts to be cool.\n\nHowever students are also an attractive market: while they do have a restricted budget many are living away from home and are therefore making independent choices over which brands to buy for the very first time. Hence they are often excited about making purchases that would be mundane for older consumers. Attracting students at this time has huge long run brand loyalty effects. University students also make an ideal target market for internet-based companies. Over 99% of students are comfortable using the internet, going online at least once a week, although usually every day. They also don’t have the same fear of the internet as much of the general population, particularly when it comes to purchasing goods online – average online spend is 7 times higher than that of the general population. Finally, whilst the working population uses the internet predominantly for work purposes, two-thirds of the time that students spend online is general surfing.\n\nWhen it comes to targeting, students have in the past been considered an elusive group, with much of their time taken up on campus and through socialising. Traditional forms of advertising, such as mainstream radio, TV and billboard advertising campaigns, are not ideal channels for reaching today’s students. Therefore, other media are targeted, such as smartphone advertising and social media. Equally, marketers can take advantage of students' concentration at geographical locations (colleges) and use techniques such as campus visits and college street teams.\n\nStudents in the UK are estimated to spend over £13 billion a year, making them a key market for consumer brands.\n\nWith the growth and development of the internet, campaigns have vastly diversified and now include multiple elements from traditional on-campus activity to bluetooth, Adwalkers, email, sms, online and social media. Leading youth brands such as the BBC, Burger King, O2, Red Bull, Virgin, to name a few, are actively engaging with the UK student market through agencies and media channels who produce the official universities welcome parcels directly into the student bedrooms.\n\nA leading factor in the diversification of the market has been the rapid growth in the size of the student market in the UK over recent years, with 1.8 million students now in Higher Education Programmes. \nWith a combined spending power of more than £10 billion and an average student spending over £5,000 each year the student market can be a highly lucrative one. Students are certainly the most profitable group of 18- to 24-year-olds.\n\nSome UK universities have moved to ban advertising they consider harmful to students, such as for payday loan companies.\n\nCertain agencies have focused on advertising to college students, such as Student Advantage, which operated a membership-card based program in the 1990s and moved into the internet, and which in 1998 bought rival Collegiate Advantage.

There he attended Saint Peter and Paul's School, and worked as a weaver, coal-bagger and lorry-driver before he started writing.\n\nAlthough best remembered for his play, \"Alfie\", mostly because of the British film starring Michael Caine in the eponymous role, Naughton was a prolific writer of plays, novels, short stories and children's books. His preferred environment was working class society, which is reflected in much of his written work.\n\nIn addition to \"Alfie\", at least two of his other plays have been made into feature films. These are \"Spring and Port Wine\", which had James Mason starring in the role of Rafe Crompton, and \"All in Good Time\", filmed as \"The Family Way\", which starred John Mills. His novel \"Alfie Darling\", the sequel to his earlier novel and play, was also filmed, with Alan Price succeeding Michael Caine in the lead role.Both 'Alfie' and 'Alfie Darling'were drawn upon for the 2004 film 'Alfie' with Jude Law in the eponymous role. \n\nHis work also includes the novel \"One Small Boy\" (1957), and the collection of short stories \"The Goalkeeper's Revenge: And Other Stories\" (1961). His 1977 children's novel \"My Pal Spadger\" is an account of his childhood in 1920s Bolton.\n\nMany of his plays were performed at the Octagon Theatre in Bolton town centre. An 85-seat adaptable studio theatre within the Octagon is named after him.\n\nDuring his lifetime, he received the following awards:\n\nNaughton died in 1992, aged 81, in Ballasalla on the Isle of Man. A \"Bill Naughton Short Story Competition\", administered by The Kenny/Naughton Autumn School, was named in his honour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

While employed in his father's manufacturing firm, he visited the British Museum to make drawings of the marble sculptures there. His work \"The River Brent, near Hanwell\" of 1825 saw him admitted to the Royal Academy schools the next year. He left his father's firm in 1830 and began to make a living teaching art.\n\nHe worked at first as a designer. He was elected an Associate in 1840 and an Academician in 1851 (retired, 1882). His \"Gulliver on the Farmer's Table\" (1837) made his reputation as a painter. He became an assiduous painter of landscape and genre; his best pictures being \"Country Cousins\" (1848), \"Olivia's Return to her Parents\" (1839), \"The Sempstress\" (1844) and \"A Well-spring in the Forest\" (1877).

Mangala sutra is a social practice widespread in India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. This practice is also an integral part of a marriage ceremony as prescribed by Manusmriti.\n\nMangala sutram literally means \"an auspicious thread\" which is knotted around the bride's neck. It is usually a necklace with black beads strung from a black or yellow thread prepared with turmeric. Sometimes gold, white or red beads are also added to the mangala sutram, depending on regional variation. It is a symbol of marriage worn by women.\n\nThe significance of the mangala sutra was re-iterated by Adi Shankara in his famous book Soundarya Lahari. According to Hindu tradition, the mangala sutra is worn for the long life of the husband. As told by religious customs and social expectations, married women should wear mangala sutra throughout their life as it is believed that the practice enhances the well-being of her husband.\n\nIt is called, \"thaali\" (), \"maangalyam\" () in Tamil, nuptial chain in English, \"thella\" () in Sinhala, \"mongolsutro\" (মঙ্গলসূত্র) in Bengali, \"mangal sutra\" () in Marathi, \"mangalyasutra\" (), \"thaali\" () in Kannada, and \"thaali\" (), \"maangalyamu\" (), \"mangalasutramu\" () or \"pustelu\" () in Telugu, \"thaali\" () in Malayalam, Mangalasutra (ମଙ୍ଗଳସୂତ୍ର), Konkanis (Goans and others, both Hindus and Christians) wear three necklaces around their necks, referred to as \"dhaaremani\" or \"muhurtmani\" (big golden bead), \"mangalasutra\" with one or two gold discs and \"kasithaali\" with gold and coral beads. In Kerala, a Christian version of the mangalsutra is called a \"minnu\". In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana regions, the two coin-sized gold discs are separated by 2-3 beads of different kinds. By tradition, one disc comes from the bride's family and another from the groom's side.\n\nMangala sutras are made in a variety of designs. The common ones are the \"Lakshmi thaali\", pustelu worn by the Telugus, ela thaali or minnu worn by the Malayalees and the \"kumbha thaali\" worn by the tamilians of the Kshatriya caste. The design is chosen by the groom's family according to prevalent customs. Gujaratis and Marwaris often use a diamond pendant in a gold chain which is merely ornamental in nature and is not a substitute to the mangala sutra in the traditional sense. Maharashtrians wear a pendant of two \"vati\" ornaments. The mangalya, thaali or mangala sutra of Kannidagas is similar to that of the Maharashtrians, except that it usually has two vatis. Nowadays many fashion conscious families opt for lighter versions, with a single vati or more contemporary style.\n\n\n"}

He sings in English, and to a lesser extent in Irish.\n\nDempsey was born and raised in Donaghmede, a Northside suburb of Dublin. His father was a panel beater while his mother had a variety of jobs in the area. His earliest musical influences came from the post-pub musical sessions that were held in his parents' house when he was a toddler. This developed into a love of artists such as Christy Moore, Luke Kelly, Shane MacGowan, Bob Marley and Elvis Presley.\n\nShy as a teenager, Dempsey retreated to his bedroom where he spent his time honing his singing and guitar playing. He soon started to pen his own songs, testing the water on his pleasantly surprised family with \"a song about smog\". His family encouraged him to enter a 2FM song contest, and he came second with \"Cardboard City\", a song of his own about homelessness.\n\nAlthough hugely taken with the Irish folk tradition, it was Bob Marley who inspired Dempsey during some of his darker times:\n\nGrowing up on the northside of Dublin, the six-foot two-inch Dempsey trained along with his older brothers (both over 6 foot 5), and competed for Dublin as an amateur boxer before committing himself to studying music.\n\nDempsey attended secondary school at Mount Temple Comprehensive School, sharing classes with model Amanda Brunker. He then went on to Ballyfermot College of Further Education – the \"Rock School\" – for two years before graduating in 1995. There he studied musical performance and management and his first EP, \"The Contender\", was released in 1995 on the school's record label.\n\nUnemployed and on the dole for several years, Dempsey was a regular visitor to the library in Donaghmede where he read about Irish history and developed a lasting appreciation for the \"seanchaí\" – the Irish storyteller.\n\nHis first commercial single \"Dublin Town\" was released in 1997, and reached number 18 in the Irish music charts. The Irish music magazine \"Hot Press\" praised the single, remarking that it was \"an underground anthem for disaffected youth and closet balladeer alike\". His first full-length album, titled \"They Don't Teach This Shit in School\", was released in 2000 and contained a re-recorded version of this song.\n\nDempsey's talent was beginning to be noticed, not least by Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor, who invited him out on tour with her and championed him as one to watch. \"I don't think there's ever been anyone like him. I think he represents the sort of voice in Ireland that is not allowed to be heard\", she said. Dempsey later joked onstage that when he got the call from O'Connor to join the tour, he assumed it would be on the door as a bouncer.\n\nHis next release, in 2002, the \"Negative Vibes\" EP, featured Sinéad O'Connor on the title track and led to an invitation to support her on her 2002/2003 Irish, UK, and European tour.\n\nDempsey's second full-length album, \"Seize the Day\", was released in May 2003 in Ireland on Clear Records via Sony and entered the charts in its first week of release at No. 5. It has since achieved double-platinum sales.\n\nIn 2004 Dempsey toured extensively headlining his own shows as well as supporting Bob Dylan during the Irish leg of his European tour and making his debut appearances at The Fleadh and Womad.\n\nHe has earned the support of his peers, particularly Morrissey, who invited Dempsey to support him on various UK and Irish dates as well as his autumn 2004 US tour. Morrissey went on to sign Dempsey to his label (Attack), and \"Seize the Day\" had its US release in October 2004.\n\nHis third album, \"Shots\", simultaneously released in Ireland and the UK in March 2005, entered the Irish album charts at No. 1.\n\nAt Oxegen 2006, on the main stage on Saturday afternoon, Dempsey said that Patrick Pearse would be \"turning in his grave\" at the state of modern Ireland. This sparked off controversy.\n\nHe supported English folk-rock band The Levellers on their UK tour in the spring of 2006 as well as playing at The Levellers' music festival Beautiful Days in August 2006.\n\nDempsey's first live album, \"Live at the Olympia\", was released June 2006 in Ireland and the UK. The album was recorded at Dublin's Olympia Theatre on 15 December 2005.\n\n\"Shots\" was released in the US on the United For Opportunity label in June 2006 and Dempsey undertook a coast to coast tour.\n\nOn the Fleadh 2007 tour Dempsey, along with Sharon Shannon's Big Band, toured Ireland and the UK with Willie Nelson.\n\nHis fourth studio album, \"To Hell or Barbados\", released in June 2007, entered the Irish album chart at No. 2. An extended version of the album, which included a bonus CD featuring previously unreleased and rare tracks, was released in Ireland via Sony BMG in November 2007.\n\nDempsey's fifth studio album, a covers album entitled \"The Rocky Road\", was released on 6 June 2008 in Ireland via Sony BMG, with a UK release via IRL on 9 June 2008 and on 26 August via United for Opportunity. The lead single \"A Rainy Night in Soho\", a cover of the Pogues' track, was released on 30 May 2008.\n\nHis sixth studio album, \"Almighty Love\", was released in October 2012 and entered the chart at No. 3, with the single of the same name released in mid-October.\n\nIn 2014, Dempsey released a best-of album titled \"It's All Good\" which entered the chart at No. 1. During the Australian leg of his tour promoting this album, he appeared on an episode of the comedy-music panel show \"Spicks and Specks\".\n\nIn 2016, Dempsey released an album titled \"No Force On Earth\" of original and covered songs to commemorate the centenary of The 1916 Rising. The album featured the traditional song \"James Connolly\" which Dempsey had become known for singing at recent protests to water charges introduced by the Irish government. Other songs on the album included one written for his great aunt Jennie Shanahan who fought in the 1916 rising along with a song to commemorate an ancestor of his friend, \"Love/Hate\" actor John Connors, who also fought in the rebellion. The album was initially only made available to buy at live concerts with a limited run of 2016 copies only being produced.\n\nMany artists have covered Damien Dempsey's work, including Sinead O'Connor, The Proclaimers and The Wonder Stuff's Miles Hunt. His songs have been featured on many TV shows including \"Sons of Anarchy\", \"Fair City\" and the BAFTA winning \"Tyrannosaur\".\n\n\nThe Irish crime film \"Between the Canals\" featured Dempsey's debut performance as an actor. He played the fictional Dublin crime boss Paul Chambers. The film has been well received by critics; \"The Irish Times\" stated that the film \"has all the raw, angry energy of the great man's roaring songs.\" The film was released in cinemas in March 2011.\n\nHe appeared in the 2017 Irish crime film \"Cardboard Gangsters\".\n\nA 2003 documentary, \"It's All Good: The Damien Dempsey Story\", by independent filmmaker Dara McCluskey, followed Dempsey's career progression up to the release of \"Seize the Day\". It was broadcast on Ireland's national television station RTÉ in 2004 and shown at film festivals in Ireland and in New York.\n\nNominated in four categories in the 2004 Irish Meteor Music Awards, Dempsey walked away with two, the only 2004 double winner. In 2006 and 2007, he added to his collection of Meteor Awards when he won Best Irish Male. He was also nominated in two categories in the Irish Meteor Awards 2008 and won \"Best Folk/Traditional\".\n\n"}

It opened in 1980 in what, despite its name, was a former flour mill, originally as a Community Centre. This coincided with the rise of several Sheffield bands, including the Human League, Cabaret Voltaire, Heaven 17 and ABC.\n\nThe venue has prided itself on the variety of its events over the years hosting live music, comedians, theatre productions, record fairs, cabaret, drag and talks.\n\nThe Leadmill first opened in 1980 in the building that previously housed The Esquire, a club during the sixties that saw gigs from Jimi Hendrix and Small Faces. The Esquire was housed in one of the upper floors of The Leadmill building, it is now occupied by the venue's box office.\n\nOriginally acting as a community centre. The venue was not granted an alcohol license until 1982 and so initially hosted plays, education and training workshops and live music. The team at The Leadmill in the early 80s had the mission statement to promote the education of the public in the arts and to promote social welfare by providing recreational and leisure-time facilities. The young and unemployed were the central focus of the venue throughout the 1980s. \n\nNotable early events included a 1982 pantomime directed by Jarvis Cocker and The Housemartins deciding to queue for their own 1984 gig, but being turned away by bouncers. The venue also hosted the Festival Against Unemployment in September 1982, promoting local bands; New Model Soldier, Party Day and Agent Orange. Jazz For Lunch, an afternoon live music event was often held on Sundays throughout the 1980s.\n\nIn 1988, HRH Prince Charles visited The Leadmill. He described it as \"a building well restored\" and went on to say \"It houses a theatre, live music venue, educational and training centre, not to mention a restaurant, bar, nightclub, and, they say, it makes a profit!\". The staff at the venue had made the prince a cake in the shape of the building which was then taken to the Sheffield Children's Hospital for the enjoyment of staff and patients.\n\nThe Leadmill rolled with the times in the 90s, briefly becoming the Sheffield home of Gatecrasher before launching its own influential house night RISE. \n\nDuring the 00s, The Leadmill played host to bands such as Milburn, Coldplay, Snow Patrol, The Killers, Enter Shikari, Sisteray, Klaxons, The Coral, Explosions in the Sky, Kids in Glass Houses, Elliot Minor, One Night Only, The Audition, The Maccabees, and The White Stripes. Sheffield's own Arctic Monkeys sold out the Leadmill in 2005 quicker than any other band, well before they released \"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\". The Libertines played a five-band bill in 2002, supported by Parva, who would later come back to headline as Kaiser Chiefs. In the same way, in 2003, Hot Hot Heat were supported by Franz Ferdinand before they came back to headline. Franz Ferdinand went on to tell Arcade Fire that playing The Leadmill was a 'rite of passage for any band worth their salt'. \n\nMilburn returned to the venue in 2016, during a surprise gig as part of the venue's Tramlines Festival after party. \n\nIn 2017,The Leadmill featured in Sheffield made independent video game, Welcome To Hanwell. The survival horror game allowed you to fight zombies beneath the iconic neon sign. \n\nThis year also saw the venue begin renovation work which included tearing up the original dance floor to make way for a new one. Instead of throwing it away, the venue decided to cut it up into individual engraved pieces for customers to purchase. In addition to the new dancefloor, the venue also revealed a new mezzanine floor in the back right corner of the main room.\n\nComedy has always had its place at The Leadmill and 2017 saw the venue host its first comedy festival with 55 acts taking to the stage over the space of a week. Acts included Ross Noble, Sara Pascoe, Russell Kane, Joe Lycett, Mark Watson and more. \n\nIn more recent years, The Leadmill has continued to host emerging and world renowned artists with gigs from Sam Fender, Brian Jonestown Massacre, Marmozets, Tom Walker, Mahalia, Peace, Pale Waves, Jake Shears, Tom Grennan, Miles Kane, Shame, Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Jimmy Eat World and Jorja Smith.\n\nIn 2019, the venue was chosen alongside Cambridge Junction to host the return gigs of Bombay Bicycle Club.\n\nLeadmill Road was closed during Tramlines weekend in 2019 while the venue occupied it for a street party, welcoming over 2,000 festival goers. Additional elements included an outdoor bar, carnival performers and street food. \n\nDuring the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020, panic buying had become rife and so the venue opted to begin selling toilet roll at cost price to combat those inflating the price due to the demand. A spokesperson from The Leadmill said, 'No-one should have to worry about not having basic supplies like toilet rolls at the best of times, never mind in a horrible crisis like this\". \n\nEventually due to government lockdown restrictions during the global pandemic, The Leadmill was forced to temporarily close. The venue auctioned off a variety of items from their archive to raise money to pay staff wages and to ensure the future of the venue. Items that went on sale included signed memorabilia from Arctic Monkeys, Arcade Fire, George Ezra, Biffy Clyro and more.\n\nAlso during this period of closure, the venue launched a Crowdfunder to pay essential overheads and to support the nationwide campaign, #SaveOurVenues, which aimed to ensure no music venues closed as a result of the pandemic. This was supported by online gigs promoted by The Leadmill via their Facebook page, with notable guests including Billy Bragg, APRE, Little Man Tate and a one-off performance from George Waite of disbanded Sheffield group, The Crookes. Billy Bragg's online concert went on to raise over £15,000 for the fund.\n\nThe venue has been voted favourite live music venue by readers of the \"NME\" on several occasions. The Leadmill has won 'Best Live Venue' at the Exposed Awards several times, most recently claiming the prize in 2019.The Leadmill was awarded a Music Heritage Award by PRS for Music in 2015, which was unveiled by Pulp at an event broadcast live from the venue on BBC 6 Music’s Steve Lamacq show. They have also won 'Best Venue Teamwork' at the LIVE UK Awards in 2011 and 2015.\n\nThe Leadmill has taken events beyond the venue many times including three 7,500 capacity outdoor events at Don Valley Bowl in 2018 with headliners including George Ezra, Ocean Colour Scene and Hacienda Classical. This run of events was nominated for 'Best Local Event' at the 2019 Exposed Awards. \n\nThe venue also promoted several cinematic events at Sheffield General Cemetery as part of their Halloween events in 2019 including screenings of The Omen and Get Out. When Tramlines Festival made the move from a city centre festival to an all-in-one site at Hilsborough Park, The Leadmill remained part of the festival with a stage named after it, featuring up and coming artist alongside comedians.\n\nClub Tropicana, a club night ran by the venue's team, expanded to a night in Leeds during 2018, taking place at Leeds University Union.\n\n"}

One of the commandants has been keeping an eye on David \n, making sure he is fed properly and taking his vitamins. This guard sets up the escape, gives him some soap, and leaves a sack outside the camp fence with bread, a bottle of water, and a compass in it. David must go south to Salonika, find a boat to Italy, then travel north to a free country that has a king.\n\nDavid finds a truck headed for Salonika, and without realizing it, climbs on board. He eats some of the food inside and when the truck stops, he jumps out. He finds a boat labeled \"Italy\" and sneaks in. After hiding for a few days and getting quite drunk (accidentally), he is found. Thankfully, the Italian sailor decides to help David escape by lowering him down the side of the ship with a lifebelt on. He floats to land and, after climbing for a little ways, promptly falls asleep.\n\nAfter having a bath, David finds a cave to spend the day in. Then he decides to go to the town nearby to learn about life outside of a prison camp. He is given, much to his surprise, a loaf of bread. He also finds a piece of newspaper that he uses to practice reading with. Later, after visiting the town every day for a while, David decides uses the excuse that he works for a circus to explain why he is a polyglot and why he is traveling. Then he overhears people talking about him. He flees the town and travels north. On his way, he helps people, and sometimes they give him money. Along his journey, David discovers the beauty of the world and slowly he changes his behavior and the way he interacts with people.\n\nHe saves a girl named Maria from a fire in a shed where she was trapped. David spends some time in Maria's family's house, where he sees a globe and learns about different countries. However, his knowledge of suffering and death, as well as his enmity with their eldest son and his deepening, overtly exclusive relationship with Maria worries the parents. David overhears them talking about him and, after writing them a letter, leaves the house to travel north again. Some time later he sees a personal advertisement in a newspaper placed by Maria's family, offering him a home and saying they understand his reticence.\n\nDavid has also been praying to the \"God of green pastures and still waters\", and a priest explains that while some people say there are many gods, there really is only one.\n\nWhen he meets Sophie, a middle-aged lady who lives in Switzerland and likes to paint as a hobby, she asks David if she might paint him; later she invites David to have lunch with her in her house, and while he is there, David sees a picture of a woman in Denmark. Sophie tells him that the woman's husband and her child, a boy named David, were killed, but that a guard who was attracted to the woman allowed her to escape. He realizes he needs to travel to Denmark and find that woman, who is his mother. He also realizes that the guard, who became the commandant, has saved him because he was in love with David's mother. However, because she did not love him back, and he felt a need for revenge, he did not tell her that David was still alive.\n\nWhen winter hits, David is traveling through the mountains, and he is held prisoner by a farmer who uses him for work. It is a hard season, but he is grateful to shelter at night in the farmer's stable until the snow melts. The farmer's dog, King, keeps him company through the winter. David knows that as the snow melts, he must escape from the bolted stable, as the farmer will soon hand him to the police. He makes a hole in the stable, digs a tunnel, and is free again. King catches up with him. Later, the dog gives his life to distract some guards in East Germany so that David can sneak over the border. David travels on through Denmark to Copenhagen where he looks up his mother's address in a telephone book. Virtually at the end of his strength he knocks on the door and introduces himself to his mother whom he recognizes from the picture he saw of her in Switzerland. His mother instantly recognizes him as her son David.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Donald Currie & Co. Before Sir Donald's death the fleet of the united company consisted of forty-seven steamers, with a gross tonnage of 295,411 tons. \nThe enormous improvement of communication between the United Kingdom and South Africa was largely due to Sir Donald and his ships.\n\nCurrie soon became recognised as one of the highest authorities on shipping. In 1875, he was elected chairman of a committee of ship-owners to consider proposed changes in laws affecting the mercantile marine, and he was responsible for important amendments of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1876.\n\nAlthough the Cape Prime Minister John Molteno was a personal friend of Donald Currie, he refused to authorise Currie to run a monopoly – desiring instead to preserve a state of competition between the principal shipping companies. \nMolteno therefore ordered the South African mail service to be shared equally, between Currie's Castle Company and its older rival, the Union Line. \nAfter lengthy negotiations, Currie agreed to alternating services, speed premiums and other clauses to promote competition. \nThe new mail contract was signed on 5 October 1876 and Currie created the Castle Mail Packets Company, with the offices located at the Castle Shipping Line headquarters.\n\nInitially forbidden by the contract from amalgamating, keen competition ensued between the companies. This competition led to their shipping services running at unprecedented speed and efficiency. However the contract eventually expired and several decades later, in 1900, Castle Shipping Line and Union Line would merge and become the Union-Castle Line.\n\nHis knowledge of South African affairs often proved of advantage to the British government. \nIn 1875 Lord Carnarvon, the colonial secretary, entrusted him with the conduct of negotiations with President Brand of the Orange Free State and President Burgers of the Transvaal Republic regarding the occupation of the Kimberley diamond fields. Currie defined the boundaries, and arranged the terms of agreement. \nCurrie supplied the home government with the first news of the disaster of Isandhlwana during the Zulu war in January 1879. \nThere was at that time no telegraphic connection between the United Kingdom and South Africa; the despatch announcing the calamity was sent from Cape Town by a Castle liner to St. Vincent, and thence telegraphed to Currie in London. \nWithin forty-eight hours, one of the Castle liners started for South Africa with reinforcements. \nIn 1883, on Currie's representations, the British flag was hoisted at St. Lucia Bay in Zululand, which the Germans would have captured a few days later.\n\nIn 1877, Paul Kruger and two others came to the United Kingdom as a deputation from the Transvaal Boers to the British government, begging for self-government. \nThey sought Currie's aid. \nHe introduced them to Lord Carnarvon, supporting their appeal; but his advice was not taken. When the South African war broke out in 1899, Currie's services were of great value in the conveyance of troops. \nHis ships carried altogether 172,835 men to and from South Africa, together with thousands of tons of stores, and this without an accident. \nAt the critical juncture in December 1899, when Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener were ordered to the seat of war, he arranged that the Castle liner which conveyed Lord Roberts from the United Kingdom should be so timed as to meet Lord Kitchener at Gibraltar on his arrival there from Egypt, so that the two generals might travel together to Cape Town.\n\nIn 1880, Currie had entered parliament in the Liberal interest as one of the members for Perthshire. This seat he held until 1885, when, on the division of the constituency, he was elected for West Perthshire. \nIn 1886, he broke on the Irish home rule question with Gladstone, whom he had hitherto followed. He represented West Perthshire as a Liberal Unionist from 1886 until his retirement from parliament in 1900. \nHe remained on intimate social terms with Gladstone, who was on several occasions between 1883 and 1895 his guest with other distinguished persons on one or other of his ships for summer cruises.\n\nIn 1880 Currie purchased the Garth estate in Perthshire. \nIn 1884, he added to this great property the adjoining Glen Lyon estate, and in 1903 that of Chesthill. \nHe also purchased from Lord Macdonald the island of Scalpay, off Skye, and the adjacent islands of Longa, Guillamon and Pabay.\n\nTo his tenants on all these properties Currie proved a generous landlord. \nNew breeds of cattle and sheep were introduced, and large sums expended on the erection and improvement of churches, schools, and cottages. \nHe delighted in sport in his deer-forests, on his grouse moors, and salmon rivers.\n\nIn his later years Currie was munificent in public gifts. In 1904 he gave to University College Hospital, London, £80,000 for a school of final medical studies, and £20,000 for a nurses' home and a maternity students' house. To the University of Edinburgh ho gave £25,000 for 'The Donald Currie Lectureship Endowment Fund,' and £6000 for the enlargement of the Students' Union. He also bestowed numerous benefactions on the United Free church of Scotland (he had 'come out' with his minister at the disruption of 1843) and the presbyterian church of England. He restored at a large cost the choir of Dunkeld cathedral. To Belfast, where he spent his boyhood, he was especially generous. To the 'Better Equipment Fund' of Queen's College there he gave £20,000, a gift which 'The Donald Currie Laboratories' there commemorate. He contributed a fourth of the cost of an athletic field for the Belfast students. In the Belfast Royal Academy, his first school, he founded scholarships at a cost of £2000, and, scholarships in the Royal Belfast Academical Institution at an expense of £1000. He helped, too, to pay off the debt of Fisherwick presbyterian church, Belfast, of which his father had been a member.\n\nHe died on 13 April 1909 at the Manor House, Sidmouth, Devonshire, and was buried in the churchyard of Fortingal, beside his Highland home.\n\nCurrie was married in 1851 to Margaret, daughter of John Miller of Liverpool and Ardencraig, Bute, who survived him. He left three daughters, who erected at a cost of £25,000 a university hall to their father's memory in the University of Cape Town, of which the foundation stone was laid by the duke of Connaught in 1910.\n\nDonald's brother, James Currie (d.1900) ran James Currie & Co and founded the shipping company the Currie Line in Leith. James' son and Donald's nephew James Currie FRSE (1863-1930) was a prominent amateur mineralogist and botanist.\n\nCurrie was the recipient of many honours. \nIn 1880, he was awarded the Fothergill gold medal of the Royal Society of Arts in recognition of 'the improvements which he had introduced into his passenger steamers.' \nIn 1881, he was created C.M.G., and in 1897 G.C.M.G. \nIn 1906, he was made hon. LL.D. at Edinburgh, and received the Freedom of the City of Belfast.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2333250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333250", "title": "Date rape", "text": "Date rape\n\nDate rape is a form of acquaintance rape and dating violence. The two phrases are often used interchangeably, but date rape specifically refers to a rape in which there has been some sort of romantic or potentially sexual relationship between the two parties. Acquaintance rape also includes rapes in which the victim and perpetrator have been in a non-romantic, non-sexual relationship, for example as co-workers or neighbors.\n\nSince the 1980s, date rape has constituted the majority of rapes in some countries. It is particularly prevalent on college campuses, and frequently involves consumption of alcohol or other date rape drugs. The peak age for date rape victims is from the late teens to early twenties.\n\nA feature of date rape is that in most cases the victim is female, knows the perpetrator and the rape takes place in the context of an actual or potential romantic or sexual relationship between the parties, or when that relationship has come to an end. The perpetrator may use physical or psychological intimidation to force a victim to have sex against their will, or when the perpetrator has sex with a victim who is incapable of giving consent, for example, because they have been incapacitated by alcohol or other drug.\n\nAccording to the United States Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), date rapes are among the most common forms of rape cases. Date rape most commonly takes place among college students when alcohol is involved or date rape drugs are taken. One of the most targeted groups are women between the ages of 16 to 24.\n\nThe phenomenon of date rape is relatively new. Historically, date rape has been considered less serious than rape by a stranger. Since the 1980s, it has constituted the majority of rapes in some countries. It has been increasingly seen as a problem involving society's attitude towards women and as a form of violence against women. It is controversial, however, with some people believing the problem is overstated and that many date rape victims are actually willing, consenting participants, and others believing that date rape is seriously underreported and almost all women who claim date rape were actually raped.\n\nAmerican researcher Mary Koss describes date rape as a specific form of acquaintance rape, in which there has been some level of romantic interest between the perpetrator and the victim, and in which sexual activity would have been generally seen as appropriate, if consensual. Acquaintance rape is a broader category than date rape, that can include many types of relationships including employer-employee, landlord-tenant, service provider-consumer, driver-hitchhiker, and rape among people who have a family relationship or who are neighbours.\n\nIn his 1992 book \"Sex and Reason\" American jurist, legal theorist and economist Richard Posner characterized the increased attention being given to date rape as a sign of the changing status of women in American society, pointing out that dating itself is a feature of modern societies and that date rape can be expected to be frequent in a society in which sexual morals vary between the permissive and the repressive. In Sara Alcid's 2013 article \"Navigating Consent: Debunking the “Gray Area” Myth\", she argues that dating is incorrectly believed to mean \"a permanent state of consenting to sex\".\n\nSince the final decades of the 20th century, in much of the world, rape has come to be broadly regarded as sexual intercourse (including anal or oral penetration) without a person's immediate consent, making rape illegal, including among people who know each other or who have previously had consensual sex. Some jurisdictions have specified that people debilitated by alcohol or other drugs are incapable of consenting to sex. Courts have also disagreed on whether consent, once given, can later be withdrawn. \"Cultural and legal definitions of rape are always shaped by the relationships and status of those involved, a premise that holds both historically and cross-culturally.\"\n\nMany societies rank the seriousness of a rape based on the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim. \"An assault by a stranger is more likely to be seen as a 'real rape' than one by some-one known to the victim.\" Because of this cultural conception, many date rapes are considered to be less serious than stranger rapes because the nature of the perpetrator-victim relationship, especially for those who have had a prior or current sexual relationship. In college date rape has a different meaning, as in a date would be a party where the woman is purposely given alcohol and drugs by the man and usually his friends, therefore the rape is a group effort.\n\nThe term \"date rape\" is first found in print in the 1975 book \"\" by American feminist journalist, author and activist Susan Brownmiller. But it is likely that the first use of the term was by the prominent feminist American-British lawyer Ann Olivarius in a series of public lectures at Yale University when she was an undergraduate to describe the strangulation and rape of a woman by a now-prominent gerontologist in California, Dr. Calvin Hirsch, to Yale's police department. In 1980 it was used in \"Mademoiselle\" magazine, in 1982 \"Ms.\" magazine published an article titled \"Date Rape: A Campus Epidemic?\", and in 1984 English novelist Martin Amis used the term in his novel \"Money: A Suicide Note\". One of the earliest and most prominent date rape researchers is Mary Koss, who in 1987 conducted the first large-scale nationwide study on rape in the United States, surveying 7,000 students at 25 schools, and who is sometimes credited with originating the phrase date rape.\n\nThe concept of date rape originated in the United States, where most of the research on date rape has been carried out.\nOne out of every five teens are victims of date rape.\nRape prevalence among women in the U.S. (the percentage of women who experienced rape at least once in their lifetime so far) is in the range of 15–20%, with different studies disagreeing with each other. An early 1987 study found that one in four American women will be the victim of a rape or attempted rape in her lifetime, and 84% of those will know their attacker. However, only 27% of American women whose sexual assault met the legal definition of rape think of themselves as rape victims, and only about 5% report their rape. One study of rape on American college campuses found that 13% of acquaintance rapes, and 35% of attempted acquaintance rapes, took place during a date, and another found that 22% of female rape victims had been raped by a current or former date, boyfriend or girlfriend, and another 20% by a spouse or former spouse. A 2007 American study found black non-Hispanic students were likeliest to be victims of dating violence, followed by Hispanic students and then white non-Hispanic students.\n\nRates of date rape are relatively low in Europe compared with the United States.\n\nThe rate of reported rapes is much lower in Japan than the United States. In a 1993 paper German sociologist and criminologist Joachim Kersten suggested date rape may be less prevalent in Japan compared with the United States because Japanese culture puts a lesser emphasis on romantic love and dating, and because young Japanese people have less physical privacy than their American counterparts, and in her 2007 book \"Kickboxing Geishas: How Modern Japanese Women Are Changing Their Nation\", American feminist Veronica Chambers questions whether date rape is under-reported in Japan because it isn't yet understood there to be rape. In the 2011 book \"Transforming Japan: How Feminism and Diversity Are Making a Difference \"Japanese feminist Masaki Matsuda argued that date rape was becoming an increasing problem for Japanese college and high school students.\n\nA 2007 study of attitudes towards rape among university students in South Korea found that date rape was \"rarely recognized\" as a form of rape, and that forced sex by a date was not viewed as traumatizing or criminal.\n\nDate rape is generally underreported in Vietnam.\n\nIn 2012, 98% of reported rapes in India were committed by someone known to the victim.\n\nResearcher Mary Koss says the peak age for being date raped is from the late teens to early twenties.\n\nEven though date rape is considered a hurtful, destructive and life-changing experience, research done by Mufson and Kranz showed that lack of support is a factor that determines the fragmented recovery of victims. They refused to disclose any information about the sexual assault to others, especially if they have experienced date or acquaintance rape due to self-humiliation and self-blame feelings.\n\nHowever, there are several situational contexts where victims are able to seek for help or reveal the sexual assaults they have experienced. One act for disclosure can be provoked from the willing of preventing other people from being raped, in other words, speaking out. Also, a concern transmitted by the people surrounding the victim can lead into a confession of the assault, or within a situation in which alcohol is involved and that leads to recount the experience.\n\nMost of the research on sexual assault victims has been carried out with White-middle class population. However, the scale of date and acquaintance rape among the Black and Hispanic youth population is higher, and has its particular risk factors. A research conducted in 2013 indicated that sexual assault situations were greater among Hispanic (12.2%) and Black (11.5%) female high-school students than whites (9.1%).\n\nResearchers say date rape affects victims similarly to stranger rape, although the failure of others to acknowledge and take the rape seriously can make it harder for victims to recover.\n\nRape crimes are more frequently perpetrated by people that the victims have confidence with and have known for quite some time. Nevertheless, some people's beliefs don't fit within the date rape scenario paradigm because they firmly prejudiced and stereotyped rape, victims and perpetrators. They tend to justify date rape and blame victims, particularly women victims, for the sexual assault by emphasizing the wearing of provocative clothing or the existence of a romantic relationship.\n\nOne of the main problems of date rape attributions is the type of relationship that the victim and the offender shared. The more intimate the relationship between both partners, the more probable that witnesses will consider the sexual assault as consensual rather than a serious incident.\n\nA 2002 landmark study of undetected date rapists in Boston found that compared with non-rapists, rapists are measurably more angry at women and more motivated by a desire to dominate and control them, are more impulsive, disinhibited, antisocial, hypermasculine, and less empathic. The study found the rapists were extremely adept at identifying potential victims and testing their boundaries, and that they planned their attacks and used sophisticated strategies to isolate and groom victims, used violence instrumentally in order to terrify and coerce, and used psychological weapons against their victims including power, manipulation, control and threats. Date rapists target vulnerable victims, such as female freshmen who have less experience with drinking and are more likely to take risks, or people who are already intoxicated; they use alcohol as a weapon, as it makes the victim more vulnerable and impairs their credibility with the justice system should they choose to report the rape.\n\nAmerican clinical psychologist David Lisak, the study's author and an expert in date rape, says that serial rapists account for 90% of all campus rapes, with an average of six rapes each. Lisak argues that this and similar findings conflict sharply with the widely held view that college rapes are typically perpetrated by \"a basically 'decent' young man who, were it not for too much alcohol and too little communication, would never do such a thing\", with the evidence actually suggesting that the vast majority of rapes, including date rapes, are committed by serial, violent predators.\n\nDate rape has a particular dynamic: the sexual assault happens on a date type of setting. Therefore, date rapes trials are considered inconclusive by nature and are charged with social concerns (e.g. gender roles, sexuality, body-shape). The criminal justice system urges the victim to describe the sexual assault in detail in order to be able to make a decision in court, ignoring the possibility that the trial can create a hostile environment and be a disturbing moment for the victim. Jurors’ personal beliefs and rape myth acceptance can be influential in their decision when it comes to evaluating the scenery, evidence, and making a sentence.\n\nResearch has found that jurors are more likely to convict in stranger rape cases than in date rape cases. Often, even in cases in which sufficient physical evidence is present to support conviction, juries have reported being influenced by irrelevant factors related to the female victim such as whether she used birth control, engaged in non-marital sex, was perceived by jurors as sexually dressed, or had engaged in alcohol or other drug use. Researchers have noted that because date rape by definition occurs in the context of a dating relationship, jurors' propensity to discount the likelihood of rape having occurred based on date-like behaviors is problematic. A 1982 American study of assignment of responsibility for rape found respondents were more likely to assign greater responsibility to a rape victim if she was intoxicated at the time of the rape; however, when her assailant was intoxicated, respondents assigned him less responsibility.\n\nSome critics of the term date rape believe the distinction between stranger rape and date rape seems to position date rape as a lesser offence, which is insulting to date rape victims and could partly explain the lower conviction rates and lesser punishments of date rape cases.\n\nDavid Lisak argues that prevention efforts aimed at persuading men not to rape are unlikely to work, and universities should instead focus on helping non-rapists to identify rapists and intervene in high-risk situations to stop them. Lisak also argues that whenever a nonstranger sexual assault is reported, it represents a window of opportunity for law enforcement to comprehensively investigate the alleged offender, rather than \"putting blinders on looking solely on the alleged 45-minute interaction between these two people\". Lisak believes rape victims should be treated with respect, and that every report of an alleged rape should trigger two simultaneous investigations: one into the incident itself, and a second into the alleged perpetrator to determine whether they are a serial offender.\n\nEducation programs are one way to prevent, protect, and raise awareness about rape and acquaintance rape. But these prevention programs don't have a huge impact. The combination of sexual harassment prevention tips, survival information and the psychosocial data gathered from women's assessment of date risks, make these programs focus on broad topics and don't emphasize specific and particular areas of date rape prevention.\n\nFuture prevention programs should focused on engaging men, creating an open space for conversation and the possible recognition of holding gender bias beliefs and sexual behavior myths, which can lead them to promote sexual harassment behavior.\n\nDate rape was widely discussed on college campuses in North America during the 1980s but first attracted significant media attention in 1991, when an unnamed 29-year-old woman accused William Kennedy Smith, a nephew of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, of raping her when they went for a walk on the beach after meeting in a Florida bar. Millions of people watched the trial on television. Also in 1991, Katie Koestner came forward publicly about her own experience with date rape. Koestner was featured on the cover of \"TIME\" Magazine, appeared on shows such as \"Larry King Live\" and \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". Her efforts helped bring a human face to victims of date rape and helped bring the term into common use.\n\nHip-hop band A Tribe Called Quest has a song titled The Infamous Date Rape, included in their album The Low End Theory, which was released shortly after the William Kennedy Smith incident. American ska punk band Sublime released a humorous song called Date Rape in 1991; the song ends with the date rapist being sent to prison and being anally raped by a fellow inmate.\n\nDate rape received more media attention in 1992, when former boxer Mike Tyson was convicted of rape after inviting 18-year-old Desiree Washington to a party and then raping her in his hotel room.\n\nIn 1993, Koestner was featured in an HBO special, \"No Visible Bruises: The Katie Koestner Story\" as part of the series, \"\".\n\nIn her 1994 book \"The Morning After: Sex, Fear, and Feminism\", American author Katie Roiphe wrote about attending Harvard and Princeton in the late 1980s and early 1990s, amid what she described as a \"culture captivated by victimization\", and argued \"If a woman's 'judgment is impaired' and she has sex, it isn't always the man's fault; it isn't necessarily always rape.\"\n\nIn 2007, American journalist Laura Sessions Stepp wrote an article for \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine titled \"A New Kind of Date Rape\", in which she popularized the term \"gray rape\" to refer to \"sex that falls somewhere between consent and denial\". The term was afterwards picked up and discussed by \"The New York Times\", \"Slate\", and PBS, and was criticized by many feminists, including \"Bitch\" founding editor Lisa Jervis, who argued that gray rape and date rape \"are the same thing\", and that the popularization of gray rape constituted a backlash against women's sexual empowerment and risked rolling back the gains women had made in having rape taken seriously.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2333253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333253", "title": "Battle of Castlebar", "text": "Battle of Castlebar\n\nThe Battle of Castlebar occurred on 27 August 1798 near the town of Castlebar, County Mayo, during the Irish Rising of that year. A combined force of 1,000 French troops and Irish patriots routed a force of 6,000 Protestant militia in what would later become known as the \"Castlebar Races\" or \"Races of Castlebar\".\n\nThe long-awaited French landing to assist the Irish revolution begun by Theobald Wolfe Tone's Society of United Irishmen had taken place five days earlier on 22 August, when almost 1,100 troops under the command of General Jean Joseph Amable Humbert landed at Cill Chuimín Strand, County Mayo. Although the force was small, the remote location ensured an unopposed landing away from the tens of thousands of British soldiers concentrated in the east in Leinster, engaged in mopping-up operations against remaining pockets of insurgents there. The nearby town of Killala was quickly captured after a brief resistance by local yeomen. Just south, Ballina was taken two days later following the rout of a force of cavalry sent from the town to oppose the Franco-Irish march. Following the news of the French landing, Irish volunteers began to trickle into the French camp from all over Mayo.\n\nThe Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Cornwallis, requested urgent reinforcements from England but in the interim all available forces were concentrated at Castlebar under the command of General Gerard Lake, the victor of the Battle of Vinegar Hill. The build-up of the British forces at Castlebar had reached 6,000 militia soldiers with dozens of artillery pieces and huge caches of supplies by dawn of 27 August.\n\nLeaving about 200 French regulars behind in Killala to cover his rear and line of withdrawal, Humbert took a combined force of about 2,000 French and Irish on 26 August to march on and take Castlebar. The obvious nature of his objective presented the reinforced British there with the apparent advantage of being able to deploy their forces to face a head-on attack from the Ballina road and their forces and artillery were accordingly arranged. However, locals advised the French of an alternative route to Castlebar through the wilds along the west of Lough Conn, which the British thought impassable for a modern army with attendant artillery train. This route was successfully taken and when Lake’s scouts spotted the approaching enemy, the surprised British had to hurriedly change the deployment of their entire force to face the threat from this unanticipated direction.\n\nThe British had barely completed their new deployment when the Franco-Irish army appeared outside the town at about 6 a.m. The newly sited British artillery opened up on the advancing French and Irish and cut them down in droves. French officers, however, quickly identified an area of scrub and undergrowth in a defile facing the centre of the artillery line which interfered with, and provided some cover from, the British line of fire. The French launched a bayonet charge, the ferocity and determination of which unnerved the units stationed behind the artillery. The British units began to waver before the French reached their lines and eventually turned in panic and fled the battlefield, abandoning the gunners and artillery. Some soldiers of the Longford and Kilkenny militias ran to join the republicans and even joined in the fighting against their former comrades. A unit of cavalry and British regular infantry attempted to stand and stem the tide of panic but were quickly overwhelmed.\n\nIn the headlong flight of thousands of British soldiers, large quantities of guns and equipment were abandoned, among which was General Lake's personal luggage. Although not pursued a mile or two beyond Castlebar, the British did not stop until reaching Tuam, with some units fleeing as far as Athlone in the panic. The panic was such that only the arrival of Cornwallis at Athlone prevented further flight across the Shannon.\n\nAlthough achieving a spectacular victory, the losses of the French and Irish were high, losing about 150 men, mostly to the cannonade at the start of the battle. The British suffered over 350 casualties of which about 80 were killed, the rest either wounded or captured, including perhaps 150 who joined the republicans. Following the victory, thousands of volunteers flocked to join the French who also sent a request to France for reinforcements and formally declared a Republic of Connacht.\n\nOn 31 August, Humbert proclaimed a \"Republic of Connaught\" - which lasted 3 days and collapsed when the French departed - and sent to France for reinforcements. On 5 September, the British forces were again defeated at Collooney but, after that, the rebellion quickly unfolded. More troops gathered and by the Battle of Ballinamuck on 8 September, their strength was over 15,000. Ballinamuck was the end for the French general, Humbert, who handed in his surrender. The Irish rebels fought on briefly until scattered; 200 were captured and 500 killed. Around 1,000 ran away.\nKillala was re-taken on 12 September. More French warships sailed for Ireland, but were decisively defeated by the Royal Navy near Tory Island. With that the 1798 rebellion ended. The captured French soldiers were transferred to England and eventually repatriated. The French officers of Irish origin were hanged in Dublin with the Irish rebels.\n\n"}

It is now part of the Royal Armouries, housing their collection of artillery, and a Grade I Listed Building.\n\nFort Nelson is a typical Polygonal or Palmerston Fort. It is six-sided with a deep ditch protected by three caponiers. Above each caponier is a well-protected emplacement for 13-inch mortars. It was originally entered by two Guthrie rolling bridges and has a barrack block for 172 officers and men, protected by a V-shaped redan. A large open parade ground gives access to the magazines 40 feet underneath it. There are open emplacements on the ramparts for 64 pounder rifled muzzle-loading guns and RML 6.6-inch howitzers. There are also three Haxo casemates for 7 inch rifled breech-loaders.\n\nFort Nelson is one of five Portsdown Forts. Built as a result of the 1859 Royal Commission by Lord Palmerston to prevent a French land attack, on the Portsmouth dockyard only 8 kilometres away, because the older Hilsea Lines at the bottom of the ridge were considered insufficient. A series of 6 forts were built along the 7 miles (10 km) of the ridge. From west to east they are forts Fareham, Wallington, Nelson, Southwick, Widley and Purbrook. The line was finished off at the eastern end with Crookhorn Redoubt and Farlington Redoubt. A garrison of around 200 volunteers accompanied by regular army officers would have manned the fort in time of war. Construction was protracted and Fort Nelson wasn't fully armed until the 1890s. The fort was disarmed in 1907 and then used for accommodation. In 1938, it was converted to an area anti-aircraft ammunition store; ten large magazines were built on the parade ground. Fort Nelson was abandoned in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1979, after years of neglect and vandalism, it was sold to Hampshire County Council for £50,000. The Council, with assistance of volunteers from the Palmerston Forts Society, restored it at a cost of £3-4million, and it opened to the public in 1994, becoming part of the Royal Armouries in 1995. It houses their collection of artillery, including:\n\nThe fort covers around and is open all year round, with no charges except for some special events. Live firing demonstrations are held every day, costumed guides, video presentations, and visitors are able to explore the tunnels that run below the fort connecting the magazines with gun emplacements. There are displays demonstrating the living and working conditions of the soldiers who manned the fort, and views over Portsmouth, the Solent, Hayling Island and Gosport, with the Isle of Wight beyond.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2333262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333262", "title": "Fife Circle Line", "text": "Fife Circle Line\n\nThe Fife Circle is the local rail service north from Edinburgh. It links towns of south Fife and the coastal towns along the Firth of Forth before heading to Edinburgh. Operationally, the service is not strictly a circle route, but, rather, a point to point service that reverses at the Edinburgh end, and has a large bi-directional balloon loop at the Fife end.\n\nThe service includes the Edinburgh-Dunfermline stretch of the East Coast Main Line, which includes the world-famous Forth Bridge. On the Fife side, while this main line hugs the coast, the circle is formed by a line from Inverkeithing that loops back round to Kirkcaldy by an inland route via Cowdenbeath through the old Fife coalfield. Narrowly speaking, just this line could be called the Fife Circle.\n\nThe current service is actually a combination of two previously separate local routes - Edinburgh to and Edinburgh to & . During the 1970s and 80s British Rail only ran a regular daytime service on the Dunfermline line as far as Cowdenbeath; & Cardenden were only served during the weekday business peaks (as can be seen from Table 242 of the UK All Line timetable of that era), whilst the remainder of the route to Thornton Junction was freight-only (having been closed to passengers in 1969). All local stopping trains on the coast line meanwhile terminated at Kirkcaldy.\n\nIn 1989 though, BR decided to link the two services together by reopening the eastern end of the old Edinburgh and Northern Railway Dunfermline branch to passenger traffic and run an 'out & back' service from Edinburgh from the start of the summer timetable in May that year. Three years later (May 1992), a new station was opened at at the northern end of the route to serve the town of Glenrothes and restore a rail service to Thornton after an absence of 23 years. This is listed in the timetables as the northern terminal of the Fife Circle and is the point at which certain trains terminate - the rest continue back to Edinburgh along the opposite side of the 'circle'.\n\nThere is a goods line connection from Dunfermline to Stirling via Longannet Power Station that rail campaigners would like to reopen to passengers, as it has already been between Stirling and Alloa. The current line via Longannet and Kincardine was last used by passenger trains in 1930, though a Stirling - Alloa - Dunfermline (Upper) service ran via the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway (now closed east of Alloa) until October 1968. Coal trains that formerly crossed the Forth Bridge en route to Longannet Power Station were rerouted by that line so that the bridge's maximum signalling capacity for trains can be used to increase the local passenger service; Longannet Power Station closed in 2017 and all coal train movements ceased although the site is now being redeveloped by Talgo to build new trains in the UK. The line between Alloa and Dunfermline is not currently signalled to passenger carrying standards. The Fife Circle is a priority for present investment in new rolling stock. Its morning peak services can be notoriously overcrowded.\n\nIn March 1998, Dalgety Bay opened. In 2000, a new station was opened in the expanding eastern suburbs of Dunfermline and given the name of Dunfermline Queen Margaret, after the nearby Queen Margaret hospital. A new station was built on the edge of Edinburgh called Edinburgh Gateway station and was opened in December 2016 to provide connections by tram to the nearby Edinburgh Airport.\n\nAll services are run by Abellio ScotRail.\n\n\n\nIn the evening, there are hourly services to Glenrothes via Cowdenbeath and to Kirkcaldy only (some of the latter continue to/from Dundee). Sundays see an hourly service in both directions around the full circle to Glenrothes.\n\nSome services regularly ran through to/from until 2015, but with the opening of the Borders Railway in September that year this routing ceased (except for a small number of weekday peak trains).\n\n\nHere the main line and loop line divide.\n\n\n\nThe two lines join forming a circle.\n\nThe east peninsula of Fife beyond Kirkcaldy is not served by railways post-Beeching. At one time a railway ran all the way from Thornton to St Andrews round the coast of Fife. The Beeching Report in fact recommended services continue between Thornton and Leven but these fell victim, like services on other Fife branch lines, to widespread apathy in the post-Beeching era. The devolved Scottish government is considering backing a branch reopening to Leven, where a new station will be built next to the swimming pool and at the disused power station. This is to satisfy the long term upward trend of cross-Forth communications in Fife's economy. Along this branch line is Cameron Bridge which serves Windygates and Kennoway, where the line runs close to Scotland's largest distillery and Diageo's main Scottish bottling operations.\n\nThe 5-mile Leven branch line continued to operate until 2001 supplying coal to Methil Power Station. Trials of freight trains continued at least until 2003.   From 2011, a one-mile stretch of the line was reopened for freight services from Earlseat opencast pit to the mainline at Thornton. Levenmouth is now the largest urban area in Scotland unserved by direct rail services (37,500 in Levenmouth excluding the nearby East Neuk where an estimated 8,500 catchment exists). STAG (Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidance) appraisals conducted in 2008 and again in 2015 indicated a positive case. A subsequent analysis described the report as not \"as robust as it should have been\", however further sustainability studies have continued and are ongoing as of 2019.\n\nSupporters of the line argue it would provide better services to support major industrial sites at Fife Energy Park, Methil Docks, the Low Carbon Park (under construction), Diageo, the businesses along the Leven Valley (including Donaldsons) and major retailers in Leven located close to the line. Levenmouth is an area of high deprivation and Fife Council estimates that an hourly train link (using the Fife Circle services)to Edinburgh would increase available job vacancies by 500% since commuting for work would become possible. The plan to re-open the rail link to Leven was approved by the Scottish Government on 8 August 2019.\n\nIt has also been proposed to start a Burntisland - Leith ferry crossing in order to spread some of the Fife-Edinburgh traffic. A previous attempt at promoting this ferry service as a commuter route in 1991 failed after 18 months. Leith itself, now Edinburgh's government district, is not served by rail but is planned to be linked to the Edinburgh tram network.\n"}

This unrest was provoked by the death of Hassan Evan Naseem at Maafushi Prison - located on a separate inhabited island - and the subsequent shooting at the same prison, that killed 3 and injured 17 others.\n\nMany government buildings, vehicles and other public properties were set on fire, some were destroyed. The government controlled the unrest by around 2300hrs and declared a State of Emergency in Malé and nearby islands. Late night curfews were enforced from 2200hrs to 0430hrs in Malé for more than a month following the rioting.\n\nOn Friday September 19, 2003, Hassan Evan Naseem, who was serving at Maafushi Jail for drug abuse related offenses, was beaten by the NSS personnel of the security unit in the jail. This led to Naseem's death the following day. The beating came about as punishment for the disturbances from complicated disputes between Naseem's inmates and \"neighboring\" prisoners. To control the disturbances caused by these disputes (and reportedly to investigate this incident) security personnel came with a list of \"troublemakers\". Though it is said that, Naseem was not involved in the above-mentioned incident his name appeared on the list. The security guards then had gone in to round-up the listed prisoners. Naseem had resisted and had refused to leave his cell, demanding reasons for his summoning. This resistance ended up injuring a security guard which led to numerous members of the security unit storming into the cell. Evan was then moved to solitary confinement (referred to as \"the range\"). On the same night he was severely beaten up by 12 officers. He died in the early morning of September 20, 2003, largely due to injuries sustained to his lungs from the said beating.\n\nInmates of Evan Naseem learned of his death at around 1100hrs, of 20 September 2003. On receiving this news, they demanded to meet with a Security officer from Department of Corrections. There was no response to these repeated demands. Some of the prisoners refused to take lunch to reflect their concern about the death of Evan Naseem.\n\nFuneral prayers were performed by Evan's inmates and many other prisoners, after mid-day prayers. Shortly afterwards came a loud uproar from Block C where Evan's cell was located. Two inmates, then, jumped out of cell C3 after corrugated iron sheets being pushed open. More prisoners followed them and attacked jail security unit personnel. They tried to calm the prisoners down for a while and then dispersed them when the prisoners refused to cease their attack. By now more inmates came out of the Block C and opened other Blocks, facilitating more prisoners to come out.\n\nCaptain Adam Mohamed, in charge of security unit, was informed of this uprising. He issued instructions to block the premises. Upon Adam Mohamed's instruction to block the premises, Jail Security Unit personnel were issued riot gear. Prisoners on the loose confronted with this unit. Since prisoners highly out numbered them; security personnel in riot gear soon retreated.\n\nThe angry mob then turned to Captain Adam Mohamed himself. Mohamed Faseeh, a prisoner from the crowd, questioned him about the death of Evan Naseem, to which he did not respond reasonably. During this confrontation, Captain Adam Mohamed ordered security units to take arms. Sergeant Shahid Ali Manik, shot the first shots into the air at 1230hrs. He then aimed and shot at Mohamed Faseeh without further warning. Subsequently, Private Hassan Rifaau, Private Ahmed Mujuthaba Hussain and Private Mohamed Jinaah shot the prisoners. Some were shot from behind while retreating, others directly from the front.\n\nTwelve rifles were issued from the armory and 15 persons had its possession during the rampage.\n\nA total of 20 people, including a security officer, were shot during the shooting incident at Maafushi prison. Fifteen of the 20 were shot above the knees and 9 of them were directly shot from behind while retreating. Six were shot from front and bullet entry points were not determinable in 5 persons. Abdualla Ameed died instantly due to being hit directly in the head. Two died in a Sri Lankan hospital while being treated.\n\nEvan Naseem was taken to Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital, on September 20, 2003, in Malé. News of his death soon began to spread by word of mouth. By noon, many learnt about the death of Evan Naseem. People soon started gathering near the hospital to witness and to verify. Access was denied to the public and relatives, except for his mother and father.\n\nA large number of people gathered at his burial service. While people were at the cemetery, news of the shooting incident reached the already angry public. Civil unrest in Malé started with this news. Several police stations were set on fire, government buildings were attacked, and government vehicles were set on fire or destroyed by the angry mob. Among the key places target were The Elections Division office, the Majlis and the High Court.\n\nTear gas drifted through the streets of Malé in late evening and police used force to control the mob when as they reached Shaheed Hussain Adam Building. By 2300hrs, several people were arrested. President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom addressed to the nation soon after controlling the riot.\n\nPresident Maumoon Abdul Gayoom established a Presidential Commission on September 20, 2003 to investigate the death of Evan Naseem and the shooting incident at Maafushi Prison. The findings of the commission were released to the public with the title \"Report on the Death of Hassan Evan Naseem\" and \"Investigative Findings on the Incident of Shooting at Maafushi jail\" respectively. However, several sections from these public report were omitted due to national security concerns.\n\nDuring the investigation, survivors were interviewed and investigation teams were sent to Nawaloka Hospital and Apollo Hospital in Colombo where those who survived were being treated. Members of the commission visited Maafushi jail on two different occasions (September 23 and October 6, 2003) and Girifushi training center (on November 30) to obtain information on the nature of weapons used in shooting.\n\n\n"}

It is found as a native plant species in North and South America, Europe, Eurasia, and Africa. In Canada, broadleaf cattail occurs in all provinces and also in the Yukon and Northwest Territories, and in the United States, it is native to all states except Hawaii. It is an introduced and invasive species, and is considered a noxious weed, in Australia and Hawaii. It has been reported in Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines.\n\n\"Typha latifolia\" has been found in a variety of climates, including tropical, subtropical, southern and northern temperate, humid coastal, and dry continental. It is found at elevations from sea level to 7,500 feet (2,300 m).\n\n\"Typha latifolia\" is an \"obligate wetland\" species, meaning that it is always found in or near water. The species generally grows in flooded areas where the water depth does not exceed 2.6 feet (0.8 meters). However, it has also been reported growing in floating mats in slightly deeper water. \"T. latifolia\" grows mostly in fresh water but also occurs in slightly brackish marshes. The species can displace other species native to salt marshes upon reduction in salinity. Under such conditions the plant may be considered invasive, since it interferes with preservation of the salt marsh habitat.\n\n\"Typha latifolia\" shares its range with other related species, and hybridizes with \"Typha angustifolia\", narrow-leaf cattail, to form \"Typha × glauca\" (\"Typha angustifolia × T. latifolia\"), white cattail. Common cattail is usually found in shallower water than narrow-leaf cattail.\n\nThe plant is 1.5 to 3 metres (5 to 10 feet) high and it has 2–4 cm (¾ to 1½ inch) broad leaves, and will generally grow out in to 0.75 to 1 metre (2 to 3 feet) of water depth.\n\nTraditionally, \"Typha latifolia\" has been a part of certain indigenous cultures of British Columbia, as a source of food, medicine, and for other uses. The rhizomes are edible after cooking and removing the skin, while peeled stems and leaf bases can be eaten raw, or cooked. The young flower spikes, young shoots, and sprouts at the end of the rootstocks are edible as well. The starchy rootstalks were ground into meal by Native Americans.\n\nWhile \"Typha latifolia\" grows all over, including in rural areas, it is not advisable to eat specimens deriving from polluted water as it absorbs pollutants and in fact is used as a bioremediator. Specimens with a very bitter or spicy taste should not be eaten.\n\n"}

It has the royal warrant of King Albert II.\n\nIn 1795 during the War of the First Coalition which brought about the fall of the Dutch Republic, France had annexed what was then termed the Southern Netherlands, now known as Belgium. During the period of the Napoleonic Wars, in 1802 Napoleon Bonaparte asked French industrialist Henri D'Artigues to leave the noted French crystal maker Saint-Louis to buy the dilapidated glassworks at Vonêche. Like Saint-Louis, Vonêche produced lead crystal glass, and within ten years had become the most important crystal producer in the French empire. Two of the key workers in the plant's success were chemist François Kemlin and engineer Auguste Lelièvre. In 1815 following Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the Southern Netherlands was re-united within the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands. As a result of newly imposed import duties, the Vonêche factory immediately lost most of its French market. In 1816, D'Artigues negotiated with King Louis XVIII of France to buy the Verrerie de St Anne glassworks in the town of Baccarat, and renamed it the Verrerie de Vonêche à Baccarat – a name it kept until 1843. The Belgian Revolution of 1830 meant that the Vonêche glassworks also lost most of its Southern Holland market, and hence closed soon afterwards.\n\nIn 1825 Kemlin and Lelièvre bought the site of the former Val-Saint-Lambert Abbey in Seraing near Liège on the River Meuse. There they founded a new glassworks (still in operation to this day, originally focused on heavy lead crystal), which initially employed some of the key workers from the former Vonêche glassworks. The two founders initially built two houses for themselves, and block accommodation for the acquired former Vonêche workers. Like similar highly religious employers, this policy of complete lifestyle development eventually led to the company building over 200 houses on the site to house workers, in what became a self-service village which also had a general store, school and post office; the local Roman Catholic church was also expanded to accommodate additional worshippers.\n\nDue to the quality of its designs and manufacturing process, the company developed a well known brand and expanded. Aside from its home territory of Belgium and the Netherlands, the largest export market was to then Tsarist-ruled Russia. In 1876 the company opened a distribution base in New York, and in 1889 the company's CEO visited the store, and toured locally based competitor East Coast factories. As a result, on his return to Belgium the CEO noted in his report the then superior quality of American glass and the skill of its crystal cutters, which the company responded to by developing its own \"bright\" ranges and superior quality cutting. The resulting \"bright period\" expanded the companies reputation and market especially in North America, and hence today it is well known and collected there for its Art Nouveau and Art Deco pieces. In 1894 at the world exhibition in Antwerp, the company manufactured an over 2 metres high vase consisting of 82 parts and weighing 200 kilograms, which is still intact and now on display at the Curtius Museum in Liège. As the company became more successful - at its height in the period 1900–1914, it employed over 5,000 workers creating 120,000 pieces of glass per day - the company contracted out work to other factories, latterly either buying them or opening new factories, including: Jemeppe (1883 to 1952); two near Namur (1879 to 1935); and Jambes (1880 to 1931, producing oil glass lamps).\n\nThe company stopped producing during World War I, and post-war after the Russian Revolution the market in Russia totally collapsed, resulting in financial difficulties and contraction. Exports to North America saved the company, but again it suffered difficulties with the collapse of that market post the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The company hence closed the Jambes and two Namur factories, and was stable by the time of World War II, during which like most of Belgium the factory was bombed by both the Nazi Luftwaffe and the Allied Air Forces of the RAF and USAAF. Production resumed initially in the less bomb-damaged Jemeppe factory until the production lines could be restored at Seraing, which resulted in the closure of the Jemeppe factory in the 1950s. Whilst many of the buildings at Seraing were restored, a large part of the site remained as was post-WW2 until the early 2000s, when these derelict 19th century buildings were cleared to create the modern steel-framed factory, visitor centre and small factory shop which exist today, together with the original restored 19th century factory offices.\n\n"}

The album discusses a diverse range of topics including oppression, slavery, drugs and poverty.\n\n\"Shots\" entered the Irish Albums Chart at #1 and reached platinum status. It went on to receive one nomination at the 2006 Meteor Awards.\n\n\"Shots\" was Dempsey's third studio album, the successor to his 2003 platinum selling album \"Seize the Day\" which was the occasion during which his music became more noticed and appreciated. Since then he has received praise from musicians such as Christy Moore, Sinéad O'Connor and Shane MacGowan, whilst Morrissey invited him on tour with him in 2004. \"Shots\" was recorded in Rockfield Studio in Wales and produced by John Reynolds who has worked with Dempsey before.\n\nThe third track on the album \"St. Patrick's Day\" begins with a guitar which slowly builds up into a combination of tin whistles, uilleann pipes and drums. It describes pre-Celtic Tiger era Ireland. The fifth track \"Party On\" discusses the negative aspect of Ireland's drugs culture.

He is perhaps best known today for Frémy's salt, a strong oxidizing agent which he discovered in 1845. Fremy's salt is a long-lived free radical that finds use as a standard in electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.\n\nFrémy was born at Versailles, entered Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac's laboratory in 1831, and was employed at the École Polytechnique in 1834 and at the Collège de France in 1837. His next post was that of repetileur at the École Polytechnique, where in 1846 he was appointed professor, and in 1850 he succeeded Gay-Lussac in the chair of chemistry at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle, of which he later became director (1879–1891) after Michel Eugène Chevreul. He died in Paris.\n\nFrémy's work included investigations of osmic acid, the ferrates, stannates, plumbates, and other oxometallates, as well as ozone; attempts to obtain free fluorine by the electrolysis of fused fluorides; and the discovery of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid and a series of \"acides sulphazotés\", the precise nature of which long remained a matter of discussion. He also studied the coloring of leaves and flowers, the composition of bone, cerebral matter, and other animal substances, and the processes of fermentation, in which he was an opponent of Pasteur's views.\n\nKeenly alive to the importance of the technical applications of chemistry, Frémy devoted special attention as a teacher to the training of industrial chemists. In this field he contributed to our knowledge of the manufacture of iron and steel, sulfuric acid, glass, and paper, and in particular worked at the saponification of fats with sulfuric acid and the utilization of palmitic acid for candle-making. In the later years of his life he applied himself to the problem of obtaining alumina in the I crystalline form, and succeeded in making rubies identical with the natural gem not merely in chemical composition but also in physical properties.\n\nIn addition to numerous treatises in the \"Annales de Chimie et de Physique\", he published \"Traité de chimie générale\" (7 vols., 3rd ed. 1862-65). The \"Encyclopédie Chimique\", a work in 10 volumes, upon which he was engaged for thirteen years, was prepared by him in collaboration with several other scientists, and was completed in 1894.\n"}

Politically it represented a conservative traditionalist position, and drew support from traditional chiefs and the colonial administration. It was founded in December 1945 by Sissoko, son of a canton chief, and Hamadoun Dicko, a former canton chief. The party sought gradual independence from France, seeking to preserve the influence of traditional elites.\n\nThe party was established in 1946 as the Sudanese Progressive Party (\"Parti Progressiste Soudanais\"). In the French elections that year the party won two of three Sudanese seats in the French National Assembly. Sissoko and Jean Silvandre were elected. In total list of the party obtained 60,759 votes (64%). After the elections, the PSP parliamentarians joined the SFIO parliamentary group. In the 1951 French elections, the party won all three seats in French Sudan. Sissoko, Dicko and Silvandre were elected.

It was featured on the band's third studio album, \"Parallel Lines\" (1978), and was released as the album's third single in January 1979 and reached number one on the charts in several countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn December 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked the song number 255 on its list of the 500 greatest songs of all time. It was ranked at number 259 when the list was updated in April 2010. \"Slant Magazine\" placed it at number 42 on their list of the greatest dance songs of all time and \"Pitchfork\" named it the 18th best song of the 1970s.\n\nIn 2018, \"Heart of Glass\" ranked at number 66 in the UK's official list of biggest selling singles of all-time with sales of 1.32 million copies.\n\nDebbie Harry and Chris Stein wrote an early version of \"Heart of Glass\", called \"Once I Had a Love\", in 1974–75. This earlier version was initially recorded as a demo in 1975. The song had a slower, funkier sound with a basic disco beat. For this reason the band referred to it as \"The Disco Song\". This original version was inspired by The Hues Corporation's hit disco song \"Rock the Boat\" (1974). The song was re-recorded in a second demo with the same title in 1978, when the song was made a bit more pop-oriented. Harry said that \"'Heart of Glass' was one of the first songs Blondie wrote, but it was years before we recorded it properly. We'd tried it as a ballad, as reggae, but it never quite worked\", and that \"the lyrics weren't about anyone. They were just a plaintive moan about lost love.\" It was only when the band met with producer Mike Chapman to start work on \"Parallel Lines\" that Harry recalled Chapman \"asked us to play all the songs we had. At the end, he said: 'Have you got anything else?' We sheepishly said: 'Well, there is this old one.' He liked it – he thought it was fascinating and started to pull it into focus.\"\n\nExactly who decided to give the song a more pronounced disco vibe is subject to differing recollections. On some occasions, the producer Mike Chapman has stated that he convinced Harry and Stein to give the song a disco twist. On other occasions, Chapman has credited Harry with the idea. As a band, Blondie had experimented with disco before, both in the predecessors to \"Heart of Glass\" and in live cover songs that the band played at shows. Bassist Gary Valentine noted that the set list for early Blondie shows often included disco hits such as \"Honey Bee\" or \"My Imagination\".\n\nIn an interview published in the February 4, 1978 edition of \"NME\", Debbie Harry expressed her affinity for the Euro disco music of Giorgio Moroder, stating that \"It's commercial, but it's good, it says something... that's the kind of stuff that I want to do\". A notable example of this type of musical experimentation occurred when Blondie covered Donna Summer's \"I Feel Love\" at the Blitz Benefit on May 7, 1978. In his history of CBGB, music writer Roman Kozak described this event: \"When Blondie played for the Johnny Blitz benefit in May, 1978, they surprised everyone with a rendition of Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love'. It was arguably the first time in New York, in the middle of the great rock versus disco split, that a rock band had played a disco song. Blondie went on to record 'Heart of Glass,' other groups recorded other danceable songs, and dance rock was born.\"\n\nThe song was ultimately given the disco orientation that made the song one of the best-known Blondie recordings. For the single release the track was remixed by Chapman, with the double-tracked bass drum even more accentuated.\n\nIn reflecting on the development of \"Heart of Glass\" from its earliest incarnations until the recorded version on \"Parallel Lines\", Chris Stein noted that the earliest versions had a basic conventional disco beat, but that the recorded version incorporated the electronic sound of Euro disco, stating that \"The original arrangement of 'Heart of Glass'—as on the [1975] Betrock demos—had doubles on the high-hat cymbals, a more straight-ahead disco beat. When we recorded it for \"Parallel Lines\" we were really into Kraftwerk, and we wanted to make it more electronic. We weren't thinking disco as we were doing it; we thought it was more electro-European.\"\n\nThe \"Parallel Lines\" version (as well as most others) contained some rhythmic features that were very unusual for the disco context, which typically follows a strict four-beats-per-measure pattern for maximum danceability. The instrumental interludes in \"Heart of Glass\", in contrast, consist of (seven-beat) phrases, with exception to the last phrase and subsequent reprises of each interlude, which resolve back to eight beats per phrase.\n\nA 5:50 version of \"Heart of Glass\" was first released as a 12-inch single in December 1978. Some radio stations in the US were reluctant to play the song because of the \"pain in the ass\" lyric, so an edited 7-inch single was released in January 1979. The original album version was released as a single in the UK where the BBC bleeped out the word \"ass\". Debbie Harry told \"The Guardian\", \"At first, the song kept saying: 'Once I had a love, it was a gas. Soon turned out, it was a pain in the ass.' We couldn't keep saying that, so we came up with: 'Soon turned out, had a heart of glass.' We kept one 'pain in the ass' in – and the BBC bleeped it out for radio.\"\n\nThe single reached number one on the singles charts in the US and the UK. In the US, the single was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in April 1979, representing sales of one million copies. In the UK, it was certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry in February 1979, also for sales of one million copies.\n\nDespite its overall popularity, \"Heart of Glass\" was not a hit in New York City's traditional discothèques such as Studio 54, Xenon and Crisco Disco, and reached only No. 58 in \"Billboard\"s Disco Top 80 chart. One of the first rock/disco fusion hits, it was more popular in rock-oriented nightclubs such as Hurrah and the Mudd Club.\n\nThe song is associated with the disco and new wave genres.\n\n\nThe versions appearing on original 7\" and 12\" singles issued in early 1979 varied from country to country:\n\n\n\"Heart of Glass\" was recorded at the Record Plant in New York City in June 1978. The production of \"Heart of Glass\" was discussed in detail by Richard Allinson and Steve Levine on the BBC Radio 2 radio program \"The Record Producers\" that was aired on May 25, 2009. As explained in the program, the production of \"Heart of Glass\" was built around the use of a Roland CR-78 drum machine. The CR-78 was first introduced in 1978, the same year that \"Parallel Lines\" was recorded, and the use of this device on \"Heart of Glass\" was, according to the program, among the earliest uses of this device in popular music. As the program explained, it was also very unusual to use a drum machine in the context of a rock band.\n\nIn deciding to use the CR-78 for \"Heart of Glass\", the choice was made to combine the sound of the drum machine with the sound of actual drumming. This reflected the hybrid nature of the song, the combination of a drum machine that was typically used in the context of dance music with the actual drum sound that was a traditional aspect of rock recordings. In combining these elements, the sound of the drum machine was first recorded on an individual track. To synchronize the actual drum play with the drum machine, the drums were also recorded on separate tracks, with the bass drum recorded separately from the rest of the drums.\n\nHaving combined the drums with the drum machine, another important feature of the CR-78 was that it could be used to send a trigger pulse to the early polyphonic synthesizers. This trigger pulse feature was also used on \"Heart of Glass\". The trigger pulse created by the CR-78 became a distinctive electronic/synth element of the song. The additional synthesizer portions of the song were played separately.\n\nOther electronic musical instruments used in the track include the Roland SH-5 and Minimoog synthesizers. Due to the lack of music sequencers, they recorded three different parts using the SH-5 and Minimoog.\n\nFor the guitars, each guitar part was again recorded on separate tracks. For the vocals, a single track and a double track of Debbie Harry's voice were combined into a single vocal recording.\n\nIn an interview in the magazine that is part of the collector's edition for the ninth Blondie studio album \"Panic of Girls\", Debbie Harry explained that band members Chris Stein and Jimmy Destri had purchased the CR-78 from a music store on 47th Street in Manhattan, and that this is how the device had become part of the production of \"Heart of Glass\": \"Chris and Jimmy were always going over to 47th Street where all the music stores were, and one day they came back with this little rhythm box, which went 'tikka tikka tikka'... And the rest is history!\" Stein also credited Destri with influencing the song's sound, saying he \"had a lot to do with how the record sounds... It was Jimmy who brought in the drum machine and a synthesiser. Synchronising them was a big deal at the time. It all had to be done manually, with every note and beat played in real time rather than looped over.\"\n\nAt the time, Blondie was one of the bands at the forefront of New York's growing new wave music scene and were accused of \"selling out\" for releasing a disco song. According to Harry, \"Heart of Glass\" made the band pariahs in the eyes of many of their fellow musicians in the New York music scene. The band was accused of pandering to the mainstream that many punk/new wave bands at the time were actively rebelling against. She also said, \"People got nervous and angry about us bringing different influences into rock. Although we'd covered 'Lady Marmalade' and 'I Feel Love' at gigs, lots of people were mad at us for 'going disco' with 'Heart of Glass'... Clem Burke, our drummer, refused to play the song live at first. When it became a hit, he said: 'I guess I'll have to.'\" Chris Stein was unrepentant about the song's disco sound, saying, \"As far as I was concerned, disco was part of R&B, which I'd always liked.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, the song was a huge hit and helped propel Blondie from cult group to mainstream icons. The band itself has acknowledged the success of the song in helping their careers and has downplayed criticism of the song, pointing out that they always experimented with different styles of music and that \"Heart of Glass\" was their take on disco. The band itself has jokingly taken to referring to the song as \"The Disco Song\" in interviews. The band also credits the TV sitcom about a radio station, \"WKRP in Cincinnati\", which played the song on one of their episodes and gave it critical exposure. In gratitude, the band gave the series' producers a Gold record for the song and it can be seen in the bullpen scenes from the second season to the series' conclusion.\n\nThe \"Heart of Glass\" promotional video was directed by Stanley Dorfman. Contrary to popular belief, it was not filmed at the Studio 54 nightclub; Chris Stein said that \"in the video, there's a shot of the legendary Studio 54, so everyone thought we shot the video there, but it was actually in a short-lived club called the Copa or something\". The video begins with footage of New York City at night before joining Blondie on stage. Then, the video alternates between close-ups of Debbie Harry's face as she lip-syncs and mid-distance shots of the entire band. Harry said, \"For the video, I wanted to dance around but they told us to remain static, while the cameras moved around. God only knows why. Maybe we were too clumsy.\"\n\nIn the video Harry wears a silver asymmetrical dress designed by Stephen Sprouse. To create the dress, Sprouse photo-printed a picture of television scan lines onto a piece of fabric, and then, according to Harry, \"put a layer of cotton fabric underneath and a layer of chiffon on top, and then the scan-lines would do this op-art thing.\" The popularity of the song helped Sprouse's work earn a lot of exposure from the media. Harry also said that the T-shirts used by the male members of the band in the video were made by herself.\n\n\"Draped in a sheer, silver Sprouse dress,\" Kris Needs summarized while writing for \"Mojo Classic\", \"Debbie sang through gritted teeth, while the boys cavorted with mirror balls\". Studying Harry's attitude in the \"effortlessly cool\" video, musician and writer Pat Kane felt she \"exuded a steely confidence about her sexual impact... The Marilyn do has artfully fallen over, and she's in the funkiest of dresses: one strap across her shoulder, swirling silks around about her. Her iconic face shows flickers of interest, amidst the boredom and ennui of the song's lyrics.\" Kane also noted that the band members fooling around with disco balls, \"taking the mickey out of their own disco fixation.\" Reviewing the \"Greatest Hits: Sound & Vision\" DVD for \"Pitchfork\", Jess Harvell wrote that while \"owning your own copy of 'Heart of Glass' may not seem as cool [anymore]... there's the always luminous Deborah Harry, who would give boiling asparagus an erotic charge, all while looking too bored to live.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemix\n\nThe first official remix of \"Heart of Glass\", by Shep Pettibone, appeared on the 1988 Blondie/Debbie Harry remix compilation \"Once More into the Bleach\" and was a single in some territories. A 1995 remix by Diddy, from the Blondie compilation \"\", reached no. 15 on the UK Singles Chart. \n\nPicking up on their similarities, the Hood Internet's ABX created a mashup of \"Heart of Glass\" and Arcade Fire's new wave-infused \"Sprawl II\" of 2010. (Harry later joined Arcade Fire in live performances of both songs at the Coachella Festival.) A remix of \"Heart of Glass\" by composer Philip Glass, titled \"Crabtree Remix\", was issued as a single in 2016.\n\nBlondie rerecorded the song for the 2014 compilation album \"Greatest Hits Deluxe Redux\", part of the two-disc set \"Blondie 4(0) Ever\", which marked the 40th anniversary of the band forming.\n\nIn 2014, the Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen went into the recording studio with French music producer and DJ Bob Sinclar to record a cover version of Blondie's \"Heart of Glass\" for H&M. She is credited on the single by her mononym Gisele. The song is Gisele's and Sinclar's charity single for the H&M 2014 campaign. Bündchen spoke to the fashion trade magazine \"Women's Wear Daily\" about the opportunity of working with Sinclar on \"Heart of Glass\" stating: \"I never in a million years thought that I would record a song and to work with a producer like Bob.\" A year earlier, she had recorded and released a cover version of the Kinks' \"All Day and All of the Night\" as her contribution to the H&M 2013 charity campaign.\n\nThe \"Heart of Glass\" single was issued on the Ultra Records label and was officially released on April 29, 2014. The new version turned out to be an international hit charting in a great number of European singles charts including France at number 31, reaching number 73 in Germany, peaking at number 28 in Poland, number 27 in Spain, number 31 in Hungary, number 63 in Austria and at number 16 in Belgium. All proceeds from the song are to go towards helping to raise funds for UNICEF. The radio edit single version is available on iTunes.\n\nThe \"Heart of Glass\" music video by Gisele and Bob Sinclar shows her dancing on a beach. The video also features Bündchen's vocal rendition of the song as the supermodel poses in sexy beachwear. The music video made its premier on the morning television show \"Good Morning America\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Ultraist core was formed, among others, by Guillermo de Torre, Juan Larrea, Gerardo Diego and the Argentine Jorge Luis Borges, who lived in Madrid at the time. \n\nIn the trend of Russian and Italian futurism, Dadaism and French surrealism, the Ultraist movement, which ended in 1922 with the cessation of the journal \"Ultra\" (though some authors, such as Borges, continued writing in the Ultraist style for nearly a decade afterwards), proposed an aesthetic change, less ambitious than that of surrealism, trying to extend to all arts and to daily life itself. The Ultraists departed completely from the mannerisms and opulence of Modernismo. Ultraist poetry is characterized by evocative imagery, references to the modern world and new technologies, elimination of rhyme, and creative graphic treatment of the layout of poetry in print, in an attempt to fuse the plastic arts and poetry. Ultraism was influenced in part by Symbolism and by the Parnassians.\n\nIn a manifesto published by \"Nosotros\" magazine (Buenos Aires, 1922), Borges summarized Ultraist goals thus:\n\n\nThe expression \"ornamental artifacts\" was clearly a reference to Rubén Darío's Modernismo, which the Ultraists considered over-ornamented and lacking in substance. The Ultraist movement agreed with other avant-garde movements in its elimination of sentimentalism.\n\nUltraism was akin to the of the Chilean poet Vicente Huidobro, who met with the Ultraists in their tertulias. Huidobro proposed that a poem should always be a new object, distinct from the rest, which must be created \"like nature creates a tree\"—a position that implied freedom of the poem from reality, including the inner reality of the author.\n"}

She is a descendant of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart.\n\nA character called Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart appeared in Ben Aaronovitch's novelisation of \"Remembrance of the Daleks\" (but not in the original television serial). That was in fact Kadiatu's great-grandmother, who wrote \"The Zen Military — A History of UNIT\", which, in the fictional world of \"Doctor Who\", was published in 2006.\n\nKadiatu's first appearance was in Aarononvitch's New Adventure novel \"Transit\". Her adopted father is Brigadier Yembe Lethbridge-Stewart, a commanding officer in the United Nations Third Tactical Response Brigade and the Zen Brigade during the Thousand Day war between Earth and the Ice Warriors. He is descended from Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and an African woman, Mariatu, whom the Brigadier had a relationship with whilst serving in Africa. Brigadier Yembe rescued Kadiatu from a research centre in Leipzig when she was three months old, acting on information received from a possible future Doctor. She had been genetically augmented with unknown technology, although some of her augmentations, such as her musculature, have similarities to Time Lord physiology. These augmentations have given her increased intelligence and rapid healing. She has also never had any form of illness or sickness.\n\nGrowing up, her adoptive father told her family stories about the Doctor. Whilst she was a student at Lunerversity, Kadiatu discovered from computer records that the stories were true and continued to research the Doctor's activities.\n\nWhen she encountered the Seventh Doctor and Bernice in the year 2109, she helped them repel an intruder from the Solar Transit System — a mass transit system that linked all the planets of Earth's solar system. When attacked, Kadiatu discovered that her instinctive response to hostile action is to kill the attacker. The Doctor also realised that she was extremely close to developing the technology to time travel. The Doctor, knowing that he should stop her from discovering this, chose to see what would happen. Kadiatu was asked to become one of his companions, but she refused. She had researched her own time travel technology and used it to explore the universe by herself.\n\nKadiatu next encountered the Doctor in Kate Orman's \"Set Piece\". When the Doctor, Ace, and Bernice were scattered through time because of time rifts, the Doctor found himself in Paris, 1871. There, he discovered that the rifts were caused by Kadiatu's time travelling equipment. Kadiatu came under the control of an alien spaceship known simply as Ship, which caused her to take the Doctor as a hostage. He, however, was able to shut down Ship's nervous system thus defeating it, and Kadiatu fled through a time rift.\n\nIt was later revealed in the novel \"The Also People\", by Ben Aaronovitch, that the Doctor had rescued Kadiatu after her escape from Ship (finding her in a feral state aboard a slave trading ship, having killed all aboard), and had hidden her on the Worldsphere — home to a very powerful race known as the People. To prevent her from doing any damage in her wild state, the Doctor arranged a remote drone aM!xitsa to guard her. The Doctor realized that he now had to make a decision about Kadiatu, but, undecided whether to kill her or save her life, the Doctor made Bernice make the decision. Although realising that she could prevent the death of many of Kadiatu's victims, Benny decided to save her. The Doctor linked the two women through the TARDIS's telepathic circuits, so that Kadiatu gained Benny's strength to live. She then built a new time machine and together with aM!xitsa again left to explore the universe. The Doctor also gave her an injection of Time Lord genes, allowing her to eventually evolve to understand the complexities of time travel.\n\nShe appeared at Benny's wedding to Jason Kane (\"Happy Endings\" by Paul Cornell), at which she encountered the Brigadier, her ancestor, and briefly at the funeral of Roz Forrester (\"So Vile a Sin\", by Ben Aaronovitch and Kate Orman), where she ordered the Doctor to snap out of his misery. After a brief mention in \"The Dying Days\", Kadiatu didn't appear again until the 2007 Bernice Summerfield audio drama, \"The Final Amendment\".\n\n"}

The first society, consisting of just 22 members, met at Lake Farm in Shebbear, Devon. Members of the Church were sometimes known as Bryanites, after their founder.\n\nPrimarily concentrated in Cornwall and Devon, the church sent missionaries all over England. By 1820, missions had been established in the Channel Islands and in Kent. They were also strong in the Isle of Wight amongst farm labourers, largely due to the inspirational teachings of Mary Toms of Tintagel, Cornwall. The vicar of Brighstone, Samuel Wilberforce, urged that their influence be countered by having their adherents sacked from their jobs and turned out from their cottages, resulting in their sometimes meeting in a chalk pit. There are several chapels in rural areas of the Island which have the title \"Bible Christian Chapel\" over the doorway (e.g. Apse Heath, Arreton).\n\nBy 1831, ministers were being sent to Prince Edward Island and Ontario, and a mission was established in Canada in 1845. Many of the emigrants from Devon and Cornwall to Canada and the United States in the 1830s were 'Bible Christians', further encouraging the spread of the church in those countries.\n\nAustralia was a favourite destination for missionaries by 1850.\n\nOther missionaries worked in New Zealand by 1878, and in China by 1885.\n\nMembers of the Bible Christian Church were sometimes known as Bryanites, after their founder. The church made extensive use of female preachers like Ann Freeman, and O'Bryan's wife Catherine.\n\nWhile being only a small denomination, the Bible Christians grew faster than the British population throughout their existence.\n\nThe Bible Christians recognised the ministry of women, calling then \"Female Special Agents\". A number of women appear on the stations – the places ministers were appointed to by the Bible Christian Conference. There were fewer than five of these women ministers in 1907, when the separate existence of the Bible Christians came to an end.\n\nIn 1907, the Bible Christian Church in England was amalgamated with the United Methodist Free Churches and the Methodist New Connexion, to form the United Methodist Church. In Canada, the Bible Christian Church had already been amalgamated, in 1884, into the Methodist Church of Canada, which later became part of the United Church of Canada. In Australia, it merged into the Methodist Church of Australasia on 1 January 1902.\n\n\nSee also Lloyd (2010) \"Women and the shaping of British Methodism\"\n\n"}

These reforms included the introduction of income contingent loans for tuition costs through the HECS, the conversion of all Colleges of Advanced Education (CAEs) into universities, and a series of provisions for universities to provide plans, profiles, statistics etc. to justify courses and research. As a result, undergraduate student numbers increased dramatically as universities were given economies of scale. There were also many mergers between universities and CAEs, with some successful (University of Queensland Gatton Campus), and others not so (the University of New England and the then Northern Rivers CAE which subsequently split acrimoniously to become Southern Cross University), and others didn't proceed (Australian National University and the Canberra CAE, now the University of Canberra).\n\nThere has been extensive criticism of the Dawkins reforms, which have been described as the application of neo-liberal ideology to universities. Critics regard the Dawkins reforms as an attempt to reduce public funding of universities, 'commercialise' university education, and expose research to 'subjective' market pressures.\n\nThe reforms have led to a culture of \"corporate managerialism\" in universities, and have been related to a rise in bullying tactics among university management, a decline in the freedom of academic speech and inquiry, and a loss of academic collegiality.\n\nAmong the Dawkins reforms is the encouragement of the use of various metrics to assess and rate research output. These measures have been subjected to intense criticism. For example, the pressure placed on academics to seek external research grants, and be rated on their ability to do so, has been criticised on the basis that different fields of research require different levels of funding, and external grants may not even be necessary. University managements are accused of shifting the responsibility for acquiring funding onto academics. Academics are also critical of allegedly objective ratings of the \"quality\" of research output, often determined by looking at the \"impact factor\" of journals in which they publish (the 'impact factor' is the ratio of papers cited from a journal to papers published in that journal) - considered an inappropriate measure of research quality, as the impact factor of a journal is not necessarily related to the relevance of that journal to a given field.\n\nOther critics, especially those among the Group of Eight, saw these reforms as \"dumbing down\" higher education, as college diploma students became university graduates overnight. The traditional universities were forced to compete for research funds with the newly designated and amalgamated universities, although they still continue to dominate competitive research funding.\n"}

The fort is named for Revolutionary War hero Dr. Joseph Warren, who sent Paul Revere on his famous ride, and was later killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill. The name was transferred in 1833 from the first Fort Warren – built in 1808 – which was renamed Fort Winthrop.\n\nFort Warren is a pentagonal bastion fort, made with stone and granite, and was constructed from 1833–1861, completed shortly after the beginning of the American Civil War. Fort Warren defended the harbor in Boston, Massachusetts, from 1861 through the end of World War II, and during the Civil War served as a prison for Confederate officers and government officials. The fort remained active through the Spanish–American War and World War I, and was re-activated during World War II. It was permanently decommissioned in 1947, and is now a tourist site. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970 as a masterpiece of coastal engineering of the pre-Civil War period, and for its role in the Civil War.\n\nFort Warren was built from 1833 to 1861 and was completed shortly after the beginning of the American Civil War as part of the third system of US fortifications.\n\nThe Army engineer in charge during the bulk of the fort's construction was Colonel Sylvanus Thayer, who is best known for his tenure as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. It was the fifth largest of the 42 third system forts. The overall plan was pentagonal in shape, slightly irregular to make the best use of the island's terrain. The fort features excellent granite work. A demilune (half-moon) battery protecting the north sally port is a rare feature in US forts. The fort was originally designed for over 200 guns, including some mortars and flank howitzers. During the Civil War it was armed with 15-inch and 10-inch Rodman smoothbore guns.\n\nDuring the Civil War, the island fort served as a prison for captured Confederate army and navy personnel, elected civil officials from the state of Maryland, and Northern political prisoners.\n\nJames M. Mason and John Slidell, the Confederate diplomats seized in the \"Trent\" affair, were among those held at the fort. Confederate military officers held at Fort Warren included Richard S. Ewell, Isaac R. Trimble, John Gregg, Adam \"Stovepipe\" Johnson, Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr., and Lloyd Tilghman. High-ranking civilians held at Fort Warren include Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens and Confederate Postmaster General John Henninger Reagan. The prison camp had a reputation for humane treatment of its detainees. When the camp commander's son, Lieutenant Justin E. Dimick, left Fort Warren for active duty in the field with the Second U.S. Artillery, he was given a letter from Confederate officers in the camp urging good care should he be captured. (He was later mortally wounded at Chancellorsville in May, 1863.)\n\nThe famous Union marching song \"John Brown's Body\" was written at the fort using a tune from an old Methodist camp song, and was performed at a flag-raising there on 12 May 1861. The song was carried to the Army of the Potomac by the men of the \"Webster Regiment\" (12th Massachusetts Infantry), who had mustered in at Fort Warren. Julia Ward Howe heard this song while visiting Washington, DC. At the suggestion of her minister, Howe was encouraged to write new words. \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\", which was initially published as a poem, was later matched with the melody of the \"John Brown\" song and became one of the best remembered songs of the Civil War era.\n\nIn the 1870s Fort Warren was upgraded with new barbette batteries on the parapets along with a six-gun external battery; these were armed with Rodman guns. A plaque at the fort states that the southeast bastion was roofed over at this time to create a rare (possibly unique) casemated 15-inch Rodman gun battery. The massive brick arches built to enclose this bastion are impressive.\n\nFrom 1892 to 1903 Fort Warren was rebuilt to accommodate modern breech-loading rifled guns under the Endicott program. Five batteries were added to the fort, replacing some of the older gun positions, as follows:\n\nThe two 12-inch (305 mm) and five 10-inch (254 mm) guns were the fort's main armament against enemy battleships. For defense against smaller vessels, particularly to defend nearby mine fields against minesweepers, two 4-inch (102 mm) and three 3-inch (76 mm) guns were included. The 4-inch guns were a Navy design by Driggs-Schroeder, and in the whole US Army coast defense system only Fort Warren and Fort Washington in Maryland had this type of gun. Battery Adams was built of low-quality concrete and was disarmed and abandoned due to deterioration in 1914.\n\nFort Warren was the headquarters of the Coast Defenses of Boston in World War I. In 1917–1918 the four 10-inch guns of Battery Bartlett were removed for potential service as railway artillery on the Western Front. Contrary to some references, although some 10-inch guns were shipped to France to be mounted as railway guns, none appear to have been used in action in World War I. Different 10-inch M1888 guns, including two from Battery Reilly at Fort Adams in Rhode Island and two from storage, replaced these weapons in 1919.\n\nIn 1920, with World War I over, several weapon types were withdrawn from Coast Artillery service. These included the 4-inch Driggs-Schroeder guns of Battery Plunkett and the 3-inch Driggs-Seabury guns of Battery Lowell. None of these were replaced. The 4-inch guns at Fort Warren remained as display pieces at least through 1941.\n\nDuring World War II, the fort served as a control center for Boston Harbor's south mine field, a precaution taken in anticipation of potential attacks by Kriegsmarine U-boats. At that time, Fort Warren was garrisoned by the 241st Coast Artillery Regiment (Harbor Defense), a Massachusetts National Guard unit that was federalized in September, 1940. As new 16-inch batteries were built, particularly Battery Murphy at the East Point Military Reservation, Fort Warren's remaining guns were scrapped in 1942–1944. Fort Warren was permanently decommissioned after 1950. At some point an emplacement of Battery Bartlett was demolished for an access road.\n\nFort Warren was owned by the U.S. federal government until 1958, when the state obtained it from the General Services Administration. In 1961, the fort was reopened to the public after initial restoration.\n\nToday, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation maintains and administers the fort, which is the centerpiece of the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area. The fort is reachable by ferry from downtown Boston, Hingham, or Hull to Georges Island. Transfers are then available for those who wish to visit some of the other Harbor Islands.\n\nThe fort is typically open from early or mid May through Columbus Day weekend. DCR Rangers offer guided tours, or you may explore on your own. An information booth just outside the sally port (the main entrance to the fort) posts information about available activities. The island offers a well-stocked snack bar, water fountains, and a large number of composting toilets. There is also a museum located in the old mine storehouse (the red brick building opposite the ferry dock), a number of picnic tables, and a children's play structure. The tops of several of the walls and several of the casemates and magazines beneath them are open to visitors. The dock side of the fort features two Civil War 3-inch rifled guns converted to breechloaders. 10-inch Rodman guns, projectiles from the Endicott era, and two World War II 40 mm Bofors guns are also at the fort. The museum includes a demonstration model of a disappearing gun and a Nike-Ajax missile.\n\nThe Commonwealth's only Confederate memorial, a headstone which commemorates 13 southern soldiers who died while imprisoned during the Civil War at the fort was housed on the island until 2017. It was removed then removed and placed into storage at the Massachusetts Archives. The headstone marker was installed in 1963 by the Boston Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Governor Charlie Baker called for the removal of the memorial in June 2017. The state subsequently covered over and removed the monument in October 2017.\n\n\n\n"}

He was of Austrian descent and used the German spelling Pär in application for printing in Venice, and later in France the spelling Paër.\n\nHe was born in Parma into a family of Austrian descent. His grandfather Michael Pär was a regimental band member from Peterwardein (today Petrovaradin, part of Novi Sad). His father Giulio Paer was a trumpeter with the Ducal Bodyguards and also performed at church and court events; his mother was Francesca Cutica. He was named Ferdinando after Duke Ferdinand of Parma by Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria, Duke Ferdinand's wife. He studied the theory of music under the violinist Ghiretti, a pupil of the Conservatorio della Pietà de' Turchini in Naples. His first Italian opera, \"Circe\", was given in Venice during carnival 1792; others rapidly followed, and his name was soon famous throughout Italy. In 1797, he went to Vienna, where his future wife, the singer Francesca Riccardi, had obtained an engagement. There he became music director of the Kärntnertortheater until 1801, where he produced a series of operas, including his \"Camilla\" (1799) and his \"Achille\" (1801). In 1802 he was appointed composer to the court theatre at Dresden, the , where his wife was also engaged as a singer, and in 1804 the lifetime appointment of Court Kapellmeister was bestowed upon him by Elector Frederick August.\n\nHis opera \"Leonora\" (1804) is based on the same story as Beethoven's \"Fidelio\", first produced as \"Leonora\" the following year. Beethoven had a high opinion of Paer, once jesting that the funeral march in \"Achille\" was so fine he \"would have to compose it\".\n\nIn 1807 Napoleon, while in Dresden, took a fancy to him and took him with him to Warsaw and Paris at a salary of 28,000 francs. He composed a bridal march for Napoleon's wedding to Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma (a religious ceremony that took place on 2 April 1810).\n\nIn 1809 he composed his most famous opera, \"Agnese\", a \"dramma semiserio per musica\" in two acts. Its success spread throughout Europe, and it was performed at the most important theatres (Milan, Naples, Rome, Vienna, London and Paris). It had a deep influence on the following generations of composers and aroused the admiration of many celebrated musicians and musical critics such as Stendhal, Berlioz, Castil-Blaze and Chopin. The primary reason for this success is most certainly the high quality of the music involved, but the dramaturgical structure also presents significant material such as the mad scene involving Agnese's father Uberto (bass).\n\nIn 1812, he succeeded Spontini as conductor of the Opéra-Italien in Paris. He retained this post after the Restoration while accepting those of chamber composer to the king and conductor of the private orchestra of the Duke of Orléans. In 1823, he retired from the Opéra-Italien and was succeeded by Rossini. It was around this time that he taught composition to the young Franz Liszt. In 1831, he was elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and in 1832 was appointed conductor of the royal orchestra of King Louis Philippe. In 1824, he was parodied by Daniel Auber in the role of Signor Astucio in \"Le concert à la cour\". He died at 67 in Paris in 1839.\n\nPaer wrote a total of 55 operas, in the Italian Classical styles of Paisiello and Cimarosa. His other works, including several religious compositions, cantatas, many songs and a short list of orchestral chamber pieces, are worthy of further study and performance. Some consider his music highly imaginative and melodic, while others hear his most famous work, Leonora (due to its setting by Beethoven for his only opera a year later), as mere dull formula-writing. One of his pupils was Ferdinando Orlandi.\n\nOratorios:\n\n\n"}

It expresses the wind speed (v) by the formula:\n\nMost UK tornadoes are T6 or below with the strongest known UK tornado estimated as a T8 (the London tornado of 1091). For comparison, the strongest detected winds in a United States tornado (during the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak) would be T11 using the following formulae:\n\nwhere \"v\" is wind speed and \"T\" is TORRO intensity number. Wind speed is defined as a 3-second gust at 10 m AGL.\n\nAlternatively, the T-Scale formula may be expressed as:\n\nor\n\nTORRO claims it differs from the Fujita scale in that it is \"purely\" a wind speed scale, whereas the Fujita scale relies on damage for classification, but in practice, damage is utilised almost exclusively in both systems to infer intensity. That is because such a proxy for intensity is usually all that is available, although users of both scales would prefer direct, objective, quantitative measurements. The scale is primarily used in the United Kingdom whereas the Fujita scale has been the primary scale used in North America, continental Europe, and the rest of the world.\n\nAt the 2004 European Conference on Severe Storms, Dr. Meaden proposed a unification of the TORRO and Fujita scales as the Tornado Force or TF Scale. In 2007 in the United States, the Enhanced Fujita Scale replaced the original Fujita Scale from 1971. It made substantial improvements in standardizing damage descriptors through expanding and refining damage indicators and associated degrees of damage, as well as calibrated tornado wind speeds to better match the associated damage. However, the EF Scale is biased to US construction practices. As of 2014, only the United States and Canada have adopted the EF scale.\n\nUnlike with the F scale, no analyses have been undertaken at all to establish the veracity and accuracy of the T scale damage descriptors. The scale was written in the early 1970s, and does not take into account changes such as the growth in weight of vehicles or the great reduction in numbers and change of type of railway locomotives, and was written in an environment where tornadoes of F2 or stronger are extremely rare, so little or no first-hand investigation of actual damage at the upper end of the scale was possible. The TORRO scale has more graduations than the F scale which makes it arguably more useful for tornadoes on the lower end of the scale; however, such accuracy and precision are not typically attainable in practice. Brooks and Doswell stated that \"the problems associated with damage surveys and uncertainties associated with estimating wind speed from observed damage make highly precise assignments dubious\". In survey reports, Fujita ratings sometimes also have extra qualifications added (\"minimal F2\" or \"upper-end F3 damage\"), made by investigators who have experience of many similar tornadoes and relating to the fact that the F scale is a damage scale, not a wind speed scale.\n\nTornadoes are rated after they have passed and have been examined, not whilst in progress. In rating the intensity of a tornado, both direct measurements and inferences from empirical observations of the effects of a tornado are used. Few anemometers are struck by a tornado, and even fewer survive, so there are very few in-situ measurements. Therefore, almost all ratings are obtained from remote sensing techniques or as proxies from damage surveys. Weather radar is used when available, and sometimes photogrammetry or videogrammetry estimates wind speed by measuring tracers in the vortex. In most cases, aerial and ground damage surveys of structures and vegetation are utilised, sometimes with engineering analysis. Also sometimes available are ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) left in the wake of a tornado. If an on site analysis is not possible, either for retrospective ratings or when personnel cannot reach a site, photographs, videos, or descriptions of damage may be utilised.\n\nThe 12 categories for the TORRO scale are listed below, in order of increasing intensity. Although the wind speeds and photographic damage examples are updated, which are more or less still accurate. However, for the actual TORRO scale in practice, damage indicators (the type of structure which has been damaged) are predominantly used in determining the tornado intensity.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2333491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333491", "title": "Nibiru cataclysm", "text": "Nibiru cataclysm\n\nThe Nibiru cataclysm is a supposed disastrous encounter between the Earth and a large planetary object (either a collision or a near-miss) that certain groups believed would take place in the early 21st century. Believers in this doomsday event usually refer to this object as \"Nibiru\" or Planet X. The idea was first put forward in 1995 by Nancy Lieder, founder of the website ZetaTalk. Lieder describes herself as a contactee with the ability to receive messages from extraterrestrials from the Zeta Reticuli star system through an implant in her brain. She states that she was chosen to warn mankind that the object would sweep through the inner Solar System in May 2003 (though that date was later postponed) causing Earth to undergo a physical pole shift that would destroy most of humanity. \n\nThe prediction has subsequently spread beyond Lieder's website and has been embraced by numerous Internet doomsday groups. In the late 2000s, it became closely associated with the 2012 phenomenon. Since 2012, the Nibiru cataclysm has frequently reappeared in the popular media, usually linked to newsmaking astronomical objects such as Comet ISON or Planet Nine. Although the name \"Nibiru\" is derived from the works of the ancient astronaut writer Zecharia Sitchin and his interpretations of Babylonian and Sumerian mythology, he denied any connection between his work and various claims of a coming apocalypse. A prediction by self-described \"Christian numerologist\" David Meade that the Nibiru cataclysm would occur on 23 September 2017 received extensive media coverage.\n\nThe idea that a planet-sized object will collide with or closely pass by Earth in the near future is not supported by any scientific evidence and has been rejected by astronomers and planetary scientists as pseudoscience and an Internet hoax. Such an object would have destabilised the orbits of the planets to the extent that their effects would be easily observable today. Astronomers have hypothesized many planets beyond Neptune, and though many have been disproved, there are some that remain viable candidates such as Planet Nine. All the current candidates are in orbits that keep them well beyond Neptune throughout their orbit, even when they are closest to the Sun.\n\nThe idea of the Nibiru encounter originated with Nancy Lieder, a Wisconsin woman who claims that as a girl she was contacted by gray extraterrestrials called Zetans, who implanted a communications device in her brain. In 1995, she founded the website ZetaTalk to disseminate her ideas. Lieder first came to public attention on Internet newsgroups during the build-up to Comet Hale–Bopp's 1997 perihelion. She stated, claiming to speak as the Zetans, that: \"The Hale–Bopp comet does not exist. It is a fraud, perpetrated by those who would have the teeming masses quiescent until it is too late. Hale–Bopp is nothing more than a distant star, and will draw no closer.\" She claimed that the Hale–Bopp story was manufactured to distract people from the imminent arrival of a large planetary object, \"Planet X\", which would soon pass by Earth and destroy civilization. After Hale–Bopp's perihelion revealed it as one of the brightest and longest-observed comets of the last century, Lieder removed the first two sentences of her initial statement from her site, though they can still be found in Google's archives. Her claims eventually made the \"New York Times\".\n\nLieder described Planet X as roughly four times the size of the Earth, and said that its closest approach would occur on May 27, 2003, resulting in the Earth's rotation ceasing for exactly 5.9 terrestrial days. This would be followed by the Earth's pole destabilising in a pole shift (a \"physical\" pole shift, with the Earth's pole physically moving, rather than a geomagnetic reversal) caused by magnetic attraction between the Earth's core and the magnetism of the passing planet. This in turn would disrupt the Earth's magnetic core and lead to subsequent displacement of the Earth's crust. After the 2003 date passed without incident, Lieder said that it was merely a \"white lie ... to fool the establishment.\" She refused to disclose the true date, saying that to do so would give those in power enough time to declare martial law and trap people in cities during the shift, leading to their deaths.\n\nAlthough Lieder originally referred to the object as \"Planet X\", it has become deeply associated with \"Nibiru\", a planet from the works of ancient astronaut proponent Zecharia Sitchin, particularly his book \"The 12th Planet\". According to Sitchin's interpretation of ancient Mesopotamian religious texts, which contradicts conclusions reached by all credited scholars of Mesopotamian history, a giant planet (called Nibiru or Marduk) passes by Earth every 3,600 years, allowing its sentient inhabitants to interact with humanity. Sitchin identified these beings with the Anunnaki in Sumerian mythology and claimed that they were humanity's first gods. Lieder first made the connection between Nibiru and her Planet X on her site in 1996 (\"Planet X does exist, and it is the 12th Planet, one and the same.\").\n\nSitchin, who died in 2010, denied any connection between his work and Lieder's claims. In 2007, partly in response to Lieder's proclamations, Sitchin published a book, \"The End of Days\", which set the time for the last passing of Nibiru by Earth at 556 BC, which would mean, given the object's supposed 3,600-year orbit, that it would return sometime around AD 2900. He did say that he believed that the Annunaki might return earlier by spaceship, and that the timing of their return would coincide with the shift from the astrological Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius, sometime between 2090 and 2370.\n\nModern proponents of the Nibiru cataclysm often cite the winged sun symbol as actually representing Nibiru, whom they believe would appear like a \"winged star\".\n\nThough Lieder herself has not specified a new date for the object's return, many groups have taken up her idea and cited their own dates. One frequently cited date was December 21, 2012. This date had many apocalyptic associations, as it was the end of a cycle (bʼakʼtun) in the long count in the Maya calendar. Several writers published books connecting the encounter with 2012. Despite that date having passed, many websites still contend that Nibiru/Planet X is en route to Earth.\n\nIn 2012, Lieder claimed that U.S. President Barack Obama futilely attempted to announce the presence of Nibiru near the Sun. After 2012, she claimed that several world leaders had intended to announce the presence of Nibiru near the Sun on October 20, 2014. Two weeks after the supposed date of announcement, she claimed that it did not occur because of consternation amongst the establishment.\n\nIn 2017, a conspiracy theorist and self-proclaimed \"Christian numerologist\" named David Meade revived the Nibiru cataclysm by tying it to various passages from the Bible. Meade declared that these passages contained secret numerological codes, which revealed the exact date on which Nibiru would arrive. He also based his predictions on the geometry of the Giza Pyramids. Meade initially predicted that Nibiru would arrive in October 2017, but he later revised the date back to 23 September. The specific focus of his prediction revolved around the Woman of the Apocalypse referring to a supposedly unique configuration on that date of the Sun, Moon, and planets in Virgo. He cited the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017 as a harbinger.\n\nMeade's claims received extensive media attention. Viral fake news stories circulated across the Internet, adducing non-existent confirmations by NASA of Nibiru's existence on a course \"headed straight for Earth\". In reality, NASA's position is, and always has been, that Nibiru does not exist. Meade also faced criticism from fellow Christians; Ed Stetzer, writing for \"Christianity Today\", stated that \"there is no such thing as a 'Christian numerologist'\", and described Meade as \"a made-up expert in a made-up field talking about a made-up event.\" Christopher M. Graney, a professor with the Vatican Observatory Foundation, noted that the supposedly unique event was, in fact, quite common, having occurred four times in the last millennium. His September 23rd theories were also debunked by \"Time\" writer Jeff Kluger. Brazilian astronomer Duília de Mello called his predictions and theories rubbish, and also said Nibiru would have been seen during the eclipse and that Meade was using calculations based on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nAfter his predictions failed to come true, Meade revised them and declared that Nibiru would arrive on 5 October 2017, not on 23 September. Meade announced that, on 5 October, Nibiru would eclipse the Sun, and North Korea, China and Russia would launch a combined nuclear attack on the United States. Then, the earth would be devastated by a series of magnitude 9.8 earthquakes, the earth's magnetic pole would shift by 30 degrees, the United States would be split in half, and Barack Obama would be elected president for an unconstitutional third term. He predicted that the seven-year Great Tribulation would begin on 15 October.\n\nWhen October came, another apocalyptic writer, Terral Croft, predicted the arrival of Nibiru for November 19, a prediction again reported in the British tabloid press. Croft describes Nibiru as a \"black star\" at the edge of our Solar System, which, rather than colliding with Earth, would form an apocalyptic conjunction with Earth, leading to massive earthquakes. Croft claimed that earthquakes have been increasing worldwide in the leadup to the conjunction, though \"The Washington Post\", quoting the United States Geological Survey, was quick to point out that earthquakes had decreased in both power and frequency over the year. Paul Begley, a YouTube conspiracy theorist and pastor at the Community Gospel Baptist Church in Knox, Indiana, also predicted in one of his YouTube videos that Nibiru would appear in 2017 and declared that the solar eclipse was a sign of the apocalypse and the rogue planet. Around 12 April 2018, Meade cited an alleged 23 April astrological conjunction in Virgo and predicted that Nibiru would appear during the conjunction and presage the Rapture; Space.com needled that nothing resembling such a conjunction is actually forecast for 23 April.\n\nAstronomers reject the idea of Nibiru, and have made efforts to inform the public that there is no threat to Earth. They point out that such an object so close to Earth would be easily visible to the naked eye, and would create noticeable effects in the orbits of the outer planets. Most photographs purporting to show \"Nibiru\" beside the Sun are lens flares, false images of the Sun created by reflections within the lens. Claims that the object has been concealed behind the Sun are untenable.\n\nAn orbit like that of Nibiru within our Solar System is inconsistent with celestial mechanics. David Morrison, NASA space scientist explains that after just one previous flyby of Earth, such as they claim happened in Sumerian times, Earth itself would no longer be in its current near circular orbit and would be likely to have lost its Moon. If Nibiru were a brown dwarf it would have even worse effects, as brown dwarfs are far more massive. Since Pluto is now frequently observed by backyard telescopes, any giant planet beyond Pluto would be easily observed by an amateur astronomer. And if such an object existed in our Solar System, it would have passed through the inner Solar System a million times by now. \n\nAstronomer Mike Brown notes that if this object's orbit were as described, it would only have remained in the Solar System for about a million years before Jupiter expelled it, and, even if such a planet existed, its magnetic field would have no effect on Earth's. Lieder's assertions that the approach of Nibiru would cause the Earth's rotation to stop or its axis to shift violate the laws of physics. In his rebuttal of Immanuel Velikovsky's \"Worlds in Collision\", which made the same claim that the Earth's rotation could be stopped and then restarted, Carl Sagan noted that, \"the energy required to brake the Earth is not enough to melt it, although it would result in a noticeable increase in temperature: The oceans would [be] raised to the boiling point of water ... [Also,] how does the Earth get started up again, rotating at approximately the same rate of spin? The Earth cannot do it by itself, because of the law of the conservation of angular momentum.\"\n\nIn a 2009 interview with the Discovery Channel, Mike Brown noted that, while it is not impossible that the Sun has a distant planetary companion, such an object would have to be lying very far from the observed regions of the Solar System to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets. A Mars-sized object could lie undetected at 300 AU (10 times the distance of Neptune); a Jupiter-sized object at 30,000 AU. To travel 1000 AU in two years, an object would need to be moving at 2400 km/s – faster than the galactic escape velocity. At that speed, any object would be shot out of the Solar System, and then out of the Milky Way galaxy into intergalactic space.\n\nMany believers in the imminent approach of Planet X/Nibiru accuse NASA of deliberately covering up visual evidence of its existence. Polls have suggested that many perceive NASA as a vast government agency that receives as much funding as the Department of Defense. In fact NASA's budget amounts to roughly 0.5% of that of the US government.\nOne such accusation involves the IRAS infrared space observatory, launched in 1983. The satellite briefly made headlines due to an \"unknown object\" that was at first described as \"possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth that it would be part of this Solar System\". This newspaper article has been cited by proponents of the Nibiru cataclysm, beginning with Lieder herself, as evidence for the existence of Nibiru. However, further analysis revealed that of several initially unidentified objects, nine were distant galaxies and the tenth was \"galactic cirrus\"; none were found to be Solar System bodies.\nAnother accusation frequently made by websites predicting the collision is that the U.S. government built the South Pole Telescope (SPT) to track Nibiru's trajectory, and that the object has been imaged optically. However, the SPT (which is not funded by NASA) is a radio telescope, and cannot take optical images. Its South Pole location was chosen due to the low-humidity environment, and there is no way an approaching object could be seen \"only\" from the South Pole. The \"picture\" of Nibiru posted on YouTube was revealed, in fact, to be a Hubble image of the expanding light echo around the star V838 Mon.\n\nAnother conspiracy claim regards a patch of missing data in Google Sky near the constellation of Orion, which has often been cited as evidence that Nibiru has been redacted. However, the same region of sky can still be viewed by thousands of amateur astronomers. A scientist at Google said that the missing data is due to a glitch in the stitching software used to piece the images together.\n\nAnother piece of claimed evidence drawn from Google Sky is the carbon star CW Leonis, which is the brightest object in the 10 μm infrared sky and is frequently claimed to be Nibiru.\n\nBelievers in Planet X/Nibiru have given it many names since it was first proposed. All are, in fact, names for other real, hypothetical or imaginary Solar System objects that bear little resemblance either to the planet described by Lieder or to Nibiru as described by Sitchin.\n\nLieder drew the name Planet X from the hypothetical planet once searched for by astronomers to account for discrepancies in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. In 1894, Bostonian astronomer Percival Lowell became convinced that the planets Uranus and Neptune had slight discrepancies in their orbits. He concluded that they were being tugged by the gravity of another, more distant planet, which he called \"Planet X\". However, nearly a century of searching failed to turn up any evidence for such an object (Pluto was initially believed to be Planet X, but was later determined to be too small). \n\nThe discrepancies remained through to the 1990s when the astronomer Robert Harrington put forward his hypothesis for an extra planet beyond Neptune with, as one example, a semi-major axis 101.2 AU and eccentricity 0.411 which makes its perihelion 59.60, so the closest to the Sun it would get is one and a half times the distance to Pluto.\n\nSix months before Harrington died of throat cancer in 1992, astronomer Myles Standish showed that the supposed discrepancies in the planets' orbits were illusory, the product of overestimating the mass of Neptune. When Neptune's newly determined mass was used in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Developmental Ephemeris (JPL DE), the supposed discrepancies in the Uranian orbit, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished. There are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as \"Pioneer 10\", \"Pioneer 11\", \"Voyager 1\", and \"Voyager 2\" that can be attributed to the gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in the outer Solar System. Today astronomers accept that Planet X, as originally defined, does not exist.\n\nIn 1999, New Age author V. M. Rabolú wrote in \"Hercolubus or Red Planet\" that Barnard's star is actually a planet known to the ancients as Hercolubus, which purportedly came dangerously close to Earth in the past, destroying Atlantis, and will come close to Earth again. Lieder subsequently used Rabolu's ideas to bolster her claims.\n\nBarnard's star has been directly measured to be 5.98 ± 0.003 light years (56.6 Pm) from Earth. While it is approaching Earth, Barnard's Star will not make its closest approach to the Sun until around 11,700 AD, when it will approach to within some 3.8 light-years. This is only slightly closer than the closest star to the Sun (Proxima Centauri) lies today.\n\nBelievers in Planet X/Nibiru have often confused it with Nemesis, a hypothetical star first proposed by physicist Richard A. Muller. In 1984, Muller postulated that mass extinctions were not random, but appeared to occur in the fossil record with a loose periodicity that ranged from 26 to 34 million years. He attributed this supposed pattern to a heretofore undetected companion to the Sun, either a dim red dwarf or a brown dwarf, lying in an elliptical, 26-million-year orbit. This object, which he named Nemesis, would, once every 26 million years, pass through the Oort cloud, the shell of over a trillion icy objects believed to be the source of long-period comets that orbit at thousands of times Pluto's distance from the Sun. Nemesis's gravity would then disturb the comets' orbits and send them into the inner Solar System, causing the Earth to be bombarded. However, to date no direct evidence of Nemesis has been found. Though the idea of Nemesis appears similar to the Nibiru cataclysm, they are, in fact, very different, as Nemesis, if it existed, would have an orbital period thousands of times longer, and would never come near Earth itself.\n\nOther people also confuse Nibiru with Sedna (90377 Sedna) or Eris (136199 Eris), trans-Neptunian objects discovered by Mike Brown in 2003 and 2005 respectively. However, despite having been described as a \"tenth planet\" in an early NASA press release, Eris (then known only as 2003 UB) is now classified as a dwarf planet. Only slightly more massive than Pluto, Eris has a well-determined orbit that never takes it closer to the Earth than . Sedna is slightly smaller than Pluto, and never comes closer to Earth than . Mike Brown believes the confusion results from both the real Sedna and the imaginary Nibiru having extremely elliptical orbits.\n\nOthers have tied it to Tyche, the name proposed by John Matese and Daniel Whitmire of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette for an object they believe to be influencing the orbits of comets in the Oort cloud. In February, 2011, Whitmire and his colleagues took their hypothesis to the public in an article in \"The Independent\", in which they named the object \"Tyche\" and claimed that evidence for its existence would be found once data from the WISE infrared telescope was collated, leading to a spike in calls to astronomers. The name, after the \"good sister\" of the Greek goddess Nemesis, was chosen to distinguish it from the similar Nemesis hypothesis as, unlike Nemesis, Matese and Whitmire do not believe that their object poses a threat to Earth. Also, this object, if it exists, would, like Nemesis, have an orbit hundreds of times longer than that proposed for Nibiru, and never come near the inner Solar System. In March 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out the existence of Tyche as its proponents had defined it.\n\nSome associated Nibiru with Comet Elenin, a long-period comet discovered by Russian astronomer Leonid Elenin on December 10, 2010. On October 16, 2011, Elenin made its closest approach to the Earth at a distance of , which is slightly closer than the planet Venus. Nevertheless, in the leadup to its closest approach, claims spread on conspiracy websites concluded that it was on a collision course, that it was as large as Jupiter or even a brown dwarf, and even that the name of the discoverer, Leonid Elenin, was in fact code for ELE, or an Extinction Level Event.\n\nAlthough the sizes of comets are difficult to determine without close observation, Comet Elenin is likely to be less than 10 km in diameter. Elenin himself estimates that the comet nucleus is roughly 3–4 km in diameter. This would make it millions of times smaller than the supposed Nibiru. Comet hysteria is not uncommon. Attempts have been made to correlate Elenin's alignments with the 2011 Japan earthquake, the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, and 2010 Chile earthquake; however, even discounting Elenin's tiny size, earthquakes are driven by forces within the earth, and cannot be triggered by the passage of nearby objects. In 2011, Leonid Elenin ran a simulation on his blog in which he increased the mass of the comet to that of a brown dwarf (0.05 solar masses). He demonstrated that its gravity would have caused noticeable changes in the orbit of Saturn years before its arrival in the inner Solar System.\n\nIn August, 2011, Comet Elenin began to disintegrate, and by the time of its closest approach in October 2011 the comet was undetected even by large ground-based telescopes.\n\nOn 21 September 2012, Vitali Nevski and Artyom Novichonok, using the International Scientific Optical Network of telescopes (ISON), discovered the comet C/2012 S1, known as \"Comet ISON\". Its orbit was expected to take it within of Earth on 26 December 2013. Nonetheless, believers tied it to the Nibiru cataclysm, claiming it would hit the Earth on that date, or that it would fragment and pieces of it would hit the Earth. Images of the \"fragments\" of the comet circulating on the Internet were shown to be camera artifacts. On April 30, 2013, the Hubble Space Telescope took three pictures of the comet over the course of 12 hours, which were published as a composite in Hubble's archives. This led to speculation on conspiracy sites that the comet had split into 3 pieces, or even that it was a UFO. After ISON passed perihelion on 28 November, it rapidly began to fade, leaving many to suspect that it had been destroyed as it passed the Sun. While a dim remnant did eventually return round the Sun, it was generally accepted to be a cloud of dust, rather than a solid object. On 2 December 2013, the CIOC (NASA Comet ISON Observing Campaign) officially announced that Comet ISON had fully disintegrated. The Hubble Space Telescope failed to detect fragments of ISON on 18 December 2013. On 8 May 2014, a detailed examination of the comet disintegration was published, suggesting that the comet fully disintegrated hours before perihelion.\n\nIn March 2014, astronomers Chad Trujillo and Scott Sheppard published a paper in \"Nature\" arguing that the apparent clustering of the arguments of perihelion of distant trans-Neptunian objects suggested the existence of a large trans-Neptunian planet. On January 20, 2016, Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin announced that they had corroborated Trujillo and Sheppard's findings, and that they believed the planet, which they dubbed \"Planet Nine\", would have a mass roughly ten times that of the Earth, and a semimajor axis of approximately 400–1500 AU (60–225 billion km). Believers in Nibiru and the Nibiru cataclysm immediately argued that this constituted evidence for their claims. However, astronomers pointed out that this planet, if it exists, would have a perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) of roughly 200 AU, or 30 billion km.\n\nIn March 2016, believers in the Nibiru cataclysm began to suggest that the month marked the true date for Nibiru's arrival and the destruction of Earth. That same month, the \"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society\" published a paper by Daniel Whitmire (who had proposed the existence of Tyche) in which he reconsidered a modified version of the Nemesis model he had first proposed in 1985 in light of recent speculations concerning the possibility of a trans-Neptunian planet. The hypothesis argues that an object far closer to the Sun than Nemesis could have a similar effect if its orbit precessed at a rate thousands of times slower than its actual speed, which would mean it might only interact with the Kuiper belt every 27 million years, potentially sending comets into the inner Solar System and triggering mass extinctions. However, the paper had been initially published online in November 2015, before Brown and Batygin went public with Planet Nine, and concerns a different object far closer to the Sun (100 AU vs. ~600 AU); Planet Nine, if it exists, is too far away, says Brown, to have such an effect on the Kuiper belt. Nonetheless, an article in the British tabloid \"The Sun\" (later republished in the \"New York Post\") conflated the three ideas of Nibiru, Planet Nine, and Whitmire's planet to suggest that not only had Planet Nine been found, but that it would collide with Earth at the end of April, which resulted in Batygin receiving a spike in panicked calls. In October 2017, science writer Pat Brennan wrote that this planet has no chance of ever colliding with Earth.\n\nOn November 27, 2016, NASA's NEOWISE project identified , an Apollo-class near-Earth asteroid that they calculated would pass by Earth on 25 February 2017 at a distance of . On 25 January 2017, the British tabloids, initially the \"Daily Mail\", ran a story claiming that \"Self-proclaimed Russian astronomer Dr Dyomin Damir Zakharovich\" (for whose existence the \"Daily Mail\" could not vouch) said that WF9 was in fact a spun off piece of the Nibiru system that was on course to collide with Earth.\n\nThe impact of the public fear of the Nibiru cataclysm has been especially felt by professional astronomers. In 2008, Mike Brown said that Nibiru was the most common pseudoscientific topic he was asked about.\n\nBefore his retirement after 2012, David Morrison, director of the SETI Institute, CSI Fellow and Senior Scientist at NASA's Astrobiology Institute at Ames Research Center, said he received 20 to 25 emails a week about the impending arrival of Nibiru: some frightened, others angry and naming him as part of the conspiracy to keep the truth of the impending apocalypse from the public, and still others asking whether or not they should kill themselves, their children or their pets. Half of these emails were from outside the U.S. \"Planetary scientists are being driven to distraction by Nibiru,\" notes science writer Govert Schilling, \"And it is not surprising; you devote so much time, energy and creativity to fascinating scientific research, and find yourself on the tracks of the most amazing and interesting things, and all the public at large is concerned about is some crackpot theory about clay tablets, god-astronauts and a planet that doesn't exist.\" In a similar vein, Professor Brian Cox Tweeted in 2012 that, \"If anyone else asks me about 'Nibiru' the imaginary bullshit planet I will slap them around their irrational heads with Newton's \"Principia\".\" \n\nNASA frequently has to evaluate whether or not to respond to such claims, and the value of reassuring the public is outweighed by the risk of granting further exposure to a completely non-scientific idea. Prior to the 2012 date, Morrison stated that he hoped that the non-arrival of Nibiru could serve as a teaching moment for the public, instructing them on \"rational thought and baloney detection\", but doubted that would happen. During the 2017 revival, Morrison stated that the Nibiru phenomenon \"keeps popping up over and over\" despite his original assumption that it would be short-lived.\n\nMorrison noted in a lecture recorded on FORA.tv that there was a huge disconnect between the large number of people on the Internet who believed in Nibiru's arrival and the majority of scientists who have never heard of it. To date he is the only major NASA scientist to speak out regularly against the Nibiru phenomenon.\n\n\n\n"}

The company was purchased by Short Brothers shortly before the start of World War II, production continuing until the end of the war.\n\nDouglas Rudolf Pobjoy started in the engine business working with Roy Fedden at Cosmos Engineering just after the end of World War I. Cosmos went bankrupt shortly after the war, and its assets were picked up by the Bristol Aeroplane Company, where Fedden would go on to produce a line of extremely successful engines.\n\nPobjoy also spent time in the RAF as an education officer. Here he met Flt. Lt. Nicholas Comper who went on to design the Comper Swift, that would later fly from London to Australia in 9 days 2 hours. Pobjoy partnered with Parnall to develop an engine for the Swift. Although they felt that a cast-block inline engine like the ones being produced by Cirrus and de Havilland would always be less expensive, they nevertheless selected the radial layout for their design, feeling that the cost would be more than offset by the lighter weight and higher performance his designs would offer. Douglas Pobjoy later took over the design, and started a company of his own to produce it at Hooton Park in the Wirral.\n\nThe Parnall/Pobjoy design, the 7-cylinder 67 hp Pobjoy P, received its 50-hour type rating in 1928. This was followed in 1929 by the 75/80 hp Pobjoy R, that became very successful, notably on the General Aircraft Monospar. Later designs included the 85/90 hp Pobjoy Cataract, replacing the Pobjoy R, and the 130 hp Pobjoy Niagara of 1934. The Niagara was used on a number of designs by Shorts designers, notably the Short Scion Senior and the original half-scale prototype for the Short Stirling, the S.31. The Niagara's compact size and excellent performance led to it being used on the General Aircraft GAL.38 and Airspeed AS.39 extremely long-endurance slow-flying \"Fleet Shadower\" prototypes produced to Air Ministry specification S.23/27\" where they maximized airflow over the wings.\n\nIn 1934, Pobjoy Airmotors moved its plant to Rochester, Kent, to be closer to its largest customer, Shorts. The move, and the ongoing effects of the Great Depression, drove the company into financial difficulty, and it was eventually bought outright by Shorts. The company was made public in 1935. Douglas Pobjoy then moved on to designing de-icing equipment for high-altitude flights.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Pobjoy ran a section of Rotol Airscrews of Gloucester, England, and was responsible for the design and development of an airborne generator, intended for use on the Short Shetland flying boat. The unit consisted of a flat-six sleeve-valve air-cooled petrol engine driving the generator. This was installed inboard on the aircraft, and due to the incorrect closure of the cooling ducts the engine overheated and the resulting fire destroyed the prototype Shetland. It seems that the project was abandoned at this stage.\n\nAfter the war Pobjoy designed a new tractor. On 4 July 1948, he was returning from a sales trip to Helsinki when the Scandinavian Airlines Douglas DC-6 in which he was flying was involved in the 1948 Northwood mid-air collision. All 38 passengers in both aircraft were killed.\n\n\n\n"}

Its main organ was the daily newspaper \"L'Essor-La Voix du Peuple\", which had a circulation of 40.000. It was the largest newspaper in the country as of the mid-1980s.\n\nThe party was founded by the CMLN military junta regime in order to provide it with political legitimacy. On 22 September 1975 Moussa Traoré announced that the party would be formed, with himself as general secretary. Upon the restoration of civilian rule in 1979, it became the only legal party in Mali.\n\nThe UDPM was organized along democratic centralist lines, but was not a Marxist formation. UDPM had a Central Executive Bureau with 19 members and a National Council with 137 members. As the party's general secretary, Traoré was the only candidate for president of the republic. He was automatically elected for a six-year term and confirmed in office in the 1979 general elections, whilst voters were presented with a single list of UDPM candidates for the National Assembly. This was repeated in elections in 1982, 1985 and 1988.\n\nFollowing a coup by Amadou Toumani Touré in 1991, the party was dissolved in the same year.\n"}
{"id": "2333507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333507", "title": "Former Marine Police Headquarters", "text": "Former Marine Police Headquarters\n\nThe Former Marine Police Headquarters Compound, completed in 1884, is located in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong. The Kowloon compound served as the headquarters for the Marine Police, now a unit within the Hong Kong Police Force, since its establishment until late 1996, when it was moved to Sai Wan Ho. \n\nThe compound is a declared monument since 1994 as it is one of the four oldest surviving government buildings in Hong Kong. The Compound and the Old Kowloon Fire Station have been re-developed into a heritage hotel with food and beverage outlets and retail facilities in a project headed by architect Daniel Lin of A+T Design, opened in 2009. The site is now officially renamed as 1881 Heritage.\n\nThe compound was completed in 1884 and served as the headquarters of the Water Police (as they were originally known) until late 1996. The main building was originally constructed on the waterfront, and had a dedicated slip prior to the reclamation of land to create Salisbury Road. To the east, the headquarters faced a sandy beach.\n\nDuring the Japanese Occupation (1941–1945), the compound was used as a base for the Japanese navy. At this time, an extensive network of tunnels were constructed beneath the lawn but after World War II, these tunnels were blocked and the lawn was returfed for the safety of public.\n\nIn the 1970s the compound lost a large part of its gardens, when the slope to the east was levelled to make way for the construction of Kowloon Park Drive.\n\nThe station was colloquially referred to as T-Lands Police Station – probably a reference to Marine Police brevity code for a marine police station on \"Land\" at \"Tsim Sha Tsui\". This name is used in at least two novels set in Hong Kong: \"Soldier of Fortune\" by Ernest K. Gann, published in 1954; and \"Dragon Flame\" by the house author Nick Carter, published in 1966.\n\nIn 2002, the Hong Kong Government announced a competitive tender for an adaptive reuse concept for the former Marine Police Headquarters, which had been vacant since 1996; to entice tenders, the conditions included permission to create up to of floor space below the Main Building.\n\nThe Government announced on 23 May 2003 that Flying Snow Limited, a subsidiary of Cheung Kong Holdings, had won the 50-year land grant at a tendered price of  million, out of six competitive proposals. The approval allowed the developer to preserve and redevelop the historical building into a heritage tourism facility. Flying Snow has transformed the building into a heritage hotel with food and beverage outlets, and retail facilities. The project was the first private sector-led preservation project in Hong Kong; under the terms of the land grant, specific furnishings and features were required to be preserved and restored. The project opened as \"1881 Heritage\" in 2009, and was criticized for removing most of the trees from what was once a grassy hill.\n\nIn 2010, the \"South China Morning Post\" reported the estimated floor space in the existing buildings had not been correctly surveyed and was , instead of the originally submitted for the tender; in addition, the finished project added , an extra above the tender, for which Cheung Kong paid an additional  million. Because the prevailing market rate was  million per square metre, the under-counted existing floor space and below-market rate paid for the extra construction collectively were estimated to have provided an effective  billion bonus to Cheung Kong Holdings.\n\nThe original Marine Police Headquarters comprises the Main Building, Stable Block and Signal Tower. The redevelopment into 1881 Heritage added the nearby Old Kowloon Fire Station and the Fire Station Accommodation Block to the campus.\n\nThe \"Main Building\" was originally a two-storey structure; an extra storey was added to the Main Building in the 1920s, and an ancillary building was added to the north. The south-east and south-west wings of the main building served as married quarters, while the top floor of the west wing was the residence for the Superintendent of the Water Police. The Main Building also includes a small jail and carrier pigeon coops on the walls of the courtyard to the north.\n\nAfter the 2003–09 renovation, the Main Building was renamed to \"Hullett House\" to honour Richmond William Hullett. It included a small boutique hotel offering ten suites and five restaurants and bars; each of the ten suites had a unique theme, and the Mariner's Rest bar allowed patrons to drink in a former jail cell.\n\nIn 2017, Harbour Plaza Hotels and Resorts assumed the management of Hullett House. FWD Group leased the hotel and renamed it \"House 1881\" in 2019; FWD renovated the ten suites, ranging in size from , and five dining concepts.\n\nThe Stable Block is immediately north of the Main Building.\n\nThe \"Signal Tower\" (), also known as the \"Time Ball Tower\" or \"Round House\", was constructed to provide time signals to ships in the harbour. A ball was hoisted each morning and dropped precisely at 1 PM. Its use diminished in 1907 when the time ball apparatus was removed to Signal Hill, Kowloon.\n\nThe \"Old Kowloon Fire Station\", also known as the \"Former Tsim Sha Tsui Fire Station\", was originally completed in 1920; a charity shop selling handcrafts occupied the space starting in 1986 until the 2003–09 renovations.\n\nThe Fire Station Accommodation Block is immediately north of the Old Kowloon Fire station, and was completed in 1922.\n\n\n"}

Margaret was very close to her paternal aunt, Marguerite de Navarre, who took care of her and her sister Madeleine during her childhood, and her sister-in-law Catherine de' Medici. \nNear the end of 1538, her father and Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, agreed that Margaret should marry Charles' son, the future Philip II of Spain. However, the agreement between Francis and Charles was short-lived and the marriage never took place.\n\nOn 29 April 1550 at the age of 26 she was created \"suo jure\" Duchess of Berry.\n\nShortly before her 36th birthday, a marriage was finally arranged for her by her brother King Henry II of France and her former suitor Philip II as part of the terms stipulated in the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis which was signed by the ambassadors representing the two monarchs on 3 April 1559. The husband selected for her was Philip's ally, Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, Prince of Piedmont. At the time, Margaret was described as having been a \"spinster lady of excellent breeding and lively intellect\".\n\nThe wedding took place in tragic circumstances. On 30 June just three days after her marriage contract had been signed, King Henry was gravely injured during a tournament celebrating the wedding of his eldest daughter Elisabeth to the recently widowed King Philip. A lance wielded by his opponent the Count of Montgomery accidentally struck his helmet at a point beneath the visor and shattered. The wooden splinters deeply penetrated his right eye and entered his brain. Close to death, but still conscious, the king ordered that his sister's marriage should take place immediately, for fear that the Duke of Savoy might profit from his death and renege on the alliance.\n\nThe ceremony did not take place in Notre Dame Cathedral as had been planned. Instead it was a solemn, subdued event conducted at midnight on 9 July in Saint Paul's, a small church not far from the Tournelles Palace where Margaret's dying brother was ensconced. Among the few guests was the French queen consort Catherine de' Medici who sat by herself, weeping. King Henry died the following day.\n\nMargaret and her husband had only one surviving child: Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy who was born in January 1562, when Margaret was 38 years of age. He later married Infanta Catherine Michelle of Spain, the daughter of King Philip by his marriage to Margaret's niece, Elisabeth of Valois.\n\nMargaret died on 14 September 1574 at the age of 51. She was buried in Turin at the Cathedral of Saint Giovanni Battista.\n\n"}

He served as the Bishop of the Diocese of Härnösand.\nFranzén was born in Oulu (), Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland, which at the time was an integral part of Sweden. At thirteen he entered the Royal Academy of Turku, where he attended the lectures of Henrik Gabriel Porthan (1739–1804), a pioneer in the study of Finnish history and folklore. He graduated in 1789, and became \"eloquentiae docens\" in 1792. \n\nThree years later he started on a tour through Denmark, Germany, France and England, returning in 1796 to accept the office of university librarian at Turku in Finland. In 1801 he became professor of history and ethics, in 1808 he was elected a member of the Swedish Academy and in 1815 a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nFinland was ceded by Sweden to Russia in 1809 after the Finnish War, and Franzén relocated to Kumla, Sweden, where he was appointed parish priest in the diocese of Strängnäs (1810), minister of the Klara Church in Stockholm (1824) and Bishop of Härnösand (1831). \n\nFranzén was married three times; in 1799 to Margareta Elisabet Roos, in 1807 to Sophia Christina Wester, in 1831 to Christina Elisabeth Arvedsson. Franzén's son-in-law poet and historian Anders Abraham Grafström (1790–1870) served alongside him in the Swedish Academy and was Franzén's biographer. Franzén died in the parish of Säbrå in Västernorrland.\n\nFrom the autumn of 1793, when his \"Till en ung Flicka and Menniskans anlete\" were inserted by Kellgren in the \"Stockholmspost\", Franzén grew in popular favour by means of many minor poems of singular simplicity and truth, such as \"Till Selma\", \"Den gamle knekten\", \"Riddar St Göran\", \"De Små blommorna\", \"Modren vid vaggan\", \"Nyårsmorgonen\" and \"Stjernhimmelen\". His songs \"Goda gasse glaset töm\", \"Sörj ej den gryende dagen förut\", \"Champagnevinet\" and \"Beväringssång\" were widely sung, and in 1797 he won the prize of the Swedish Academy by his \"Sång öfver grefve Filip Creutz\".\nAfter 1797, his muse, touched with the academic spirit, grew more reflective and didactic. His longer works, as \"Emili eller en afton i Lappland\", and the epics \"Svante Sture eller mötet vid Alvastra\", \"Kolumbus eller Amerikas upptäckt\" and \"Gustaf Adolf i Tyskland\" (the last two incomplete), though rich in beauties of detail, are far inferior to his shorter pieces.\n\nThe poetical works of Franzén are collected under the title \"Skaldestycken\" (7 vols., 1824–1861); new ed., \"Samlade dikter\", with a biography by A. A. Grafström (1867–1869); also a selection (\"Valda dikter\") in 2 vols. (1871). His prose writings, \"Om svenska drostniningar\" (Åbo, 1798; Örebro, 1823), \"Skrifter i obunden stil\", vol. i.

It serves as the administrative center of Pinezhsky Selsoviet, one of the seventeen selsoviets into which the district is administratively divided. Municipally, it is the administrative center of Pinezhskoye Rural Settlement, one of the fifteen rural settlements in the district. Population: .\n\nPinega was known from 17th century as the pogost of Pinezhsky Volok. In the course of the administrative reform performed in 1708 by Peter the Great the area was included into Archangelgorod Governorate, with the creation of Kevrolsky Uyezd. The center of the uyezd was located in Kevrola, now a village. In 1780, the Governorate was abolished and transformed into Vologda Viceroyalty, with the creation of Pinezhsky Uyezd in place of the Kevrolsky Uyezd. The center of the uyezd was Pinega, which thereby became a town. In 1796, Pinezhsky Uyezd moved into the Arkhangelsk Governorate. In 1897, the population of Pinega was 992. In 1925 the town of Pinega, while still being the center of the uyezd, was downgraded to a selo, and in February 1927, Pinezhsky Uyezd was abolished and merged into Arkhangelsky Uyezd.\n\nDuring Russian Civil War in 1918, battles were fought between the Red Army and British troops in Pinega and around. For a short period, Pinega was occupied by British and American troops.\n\nIn 1929, several governorates were merged into Northern Krai. July 15, 1929 the uyezds were abolished, and Pinezhsky District was established. Pinezhsky District became a part of the Arkhangelsk Okrug of the Northern Krai. In 1930, the Okrug was abolished, and the district became subordinate to the central administration of the Northern Krai. In 1936, the Krai was transformed into Northern Oblast. In 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast. Then, in 1959, Karpogorsky and Pinezhsky Districts were merged into one district with the administrative center located in Karpogory.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1993 Pinega was an urban-type settlement, after which it was downgraded to a rural type settlement again.\n\nThe Pinega River is navigable below the village of Sogra, although there is no regular passenger navigation. Pinega is located at the point where the river sharply turns south-west. At this point, it passes several kilometers from the course of the Kuloy River. In 1926—1928 a canal connecting the Pinega with the Kuloy was constructed, however, currently the canal is pretty much neglected.\n\nAn important road (unpaved) along the right bank of the Pinega connects Arkhangelsk with the valley of the Mezen. From this road, another one, also unpaved, branches off and follows the Pinega to Karpogory, the village of Zanyukhcha, and then crosses the border with the Komi Republic to the timber production settlements.\n\n from Pinega, in the village of Maletino, there is Krasnogorsky Monastery which is classified as cultural and historical heritage by Russian Federal law. The monastery is neglected.\n\nThe District Museum of the Pinezhsky District is located in Pinega.\n\nDownstream from Pinega there are karst caves which are a major tourist attraction.

He is now best known for his work on Asian languages, his \"History of the Indian Archipelago\", and his role in founding Singapore as the last British Resident of Singapore; the position of Resident was replaced by the Governor of the Straits Settlements.\n\nHe was born on Islay, in Argyll, Scotland, the son of Samuel Crawfurd, a physician, and Margaret Campbell; and was educated at the school in Bowmore. He followed his father's footsteps in the study of medicine and completed his medical course at the University of Edinburgh in 1803, at the age of 20.\nCrawfurd joined the East India Company, as a Company surgeon, and was posted to India's Northwestern Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), working in the area around Delhi and Agra from 1803–1808. He saw service in the campaigns of Baron Lake.\n\nCrawfurd was sent in 1808 to Penang, where he applied himself to the study of the Malay language and culture. In Penang he met Stamford Raffles for the first time.\n\nIn 1811, Crawfurd accompanied Raffles on Lord Minto's Java Invasion, which overcame the Dutch. Raffles was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Java by Minto during the 45-day operation, and Crawfurd was appointed the post of Resident Governor at the Court of Yogyakarta in November 1811. There he took a firm line against Sultan Hamengkubuwana II. The Sultan was encouraged by Pakubuwono IV of Surakarta to assume he had support in resisting the British; who sided with his opponents his son the Crown Prince and Pangeran Natsukusuma. The Sultan's palace, the Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat, was besieged and taken by British-led forces in June 1812. \n\nAs Resident, Crawfurd also pursued the study of the Javanese language, and cultivated personal relationships with Javanese aristocrats and literati. He was impressed by Javanese music.\n\nCrawfurd was sent on diplomatic missions to Bali and the Celebes (now Sulawesi). His knowledge of the local culture supported Raffles's government in Java. Raffles, however, wanted to introduce land reform in the Cheribon residency. Crawfurd, with his experience of India and the \"zamindari\", was a supporter of the \"village system\" of revenue collection. He opposed Raffles's attempts to introduce individual (\"ryotwari\") settlement into Java.\n\nJava was returned to the Dutch in 1816, and Crawfurd went back to England that year, shortly becoming a Fellow of the Royal Society, and turning to writing. Within a few years he was recalled to South-East Asia, as a diplomat; his missions were of limited obvious success.\n\nIn 1821, the then Governor-General of India, Lord Hastings, sent Crawfurd to the courts of Siam (now Thailand) and Cochinchina (now Vietnam.) Lord Hastings was especially interested in learning more about Siamese policy with regard to the northern Malay states, and Cochinchina's policy with regard to French efforts to establish a presence in Asia.\nCrawfurd travelled with notes from Horace Hayman Wilson on Buddhism, as it was understood at the time.\nCaptain Dangerfield of the Indian army, a skilful astronomer, surveyor and geologist, served as assistant; Lieutenant Rutherford commanded thirty Sepoys; noted naturalist George Finlayson served as medical officer. Mrs. Crawfurd accompanied the Mission.\n\n21 November 1821, the mission embarked on the \"John Adam\" for the complicated and difficult navigation of the Hoogly river, taking seven days to sail the 140 miles (225 km.) from Calcutta to open water. Crawfurd writes that, with the assistance of a steam-boat, ships might be towed down in two days without difficulty; then adds in a footnote: \"The first steam-vessel used in India, was built about three years after this passage was written...\"\n\nThe \"John Adam\" proceeded on what would be the first official visit to Siam since the resurgence of Siam following the Burmese–Siamese War of 1765–1767. Crawfurd soon found the court of King Rama II still embroiled in the aftermath of the Burmese–Siamese War of 1809–1812. On 8 December 1821, near Papra Strait (modern Pak Prah Strait north of Thalang District) Crawfurd finds fishermen \"in a state of perpetual distrust and insecurity\" due to territorial disputes between hostile Burmans and Siamese. 11 December, after entering the Straits of Malacca and arrival at Penang Island, he finds the settlements of Penang and Queda (modern Kedah Sultanate, founded in 1136, but then a tributary state of Siam) in a state of alarm. Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II, the Rajah of Quedah had fled the Rajah of Ligor (modern Nakhon Si Thammarat) to claim right of asylum at Prince of Wales's Island (modern Penang.) British claim to the island was based upon payment of a quit-rent accordant with European feudal law, which Crawfurd feared the Siamese would challenge.\n\nCrawfurd's journal entry for 1 April 1822, notes that the Siamese, for their part, were especially interested in the acquisition of arms. Pointedly questioned in this regard in an urgent private meeting with the Prah-klang (Prayurawongse), the reply was, \"that if the Siamese were at peace with the friends and neighbours of the British nation, they would certainly be permitted to purchase fire-arms and ammunition at our ports, but not otherwise.\" On 19 May, a Chief of Lao (Chao Anu, a king in what is now Laos and soon-to-be rebel) met with Crawfurd, a first diplomatic contact for the UK. This visit was despite the isolation into which the mission had fallen. A Vietnamese embassy had arrived not long before, and tensions were high. Since Crawford's brief opposed the interests of court figures including the Raja of Ligor and Nangklao, there was little prospect of success. By October relations were at a low ebb. Crawfurd moved on to Saigon, but Minh Mạng refused to see him.\n\nCrawfurd was appointed British Resident of Singapore in March 1823. He was under orders to reduce the expenditure on the existing factory there, but instead responded to local commercial representations, and spent money on reclamation work on the river. He also concluded the final agreement between the East India Company, and Sultan Hussein Shah of Johor with the Temenggong, on the status of Singapore on 2 August 1824. It was the culmination of negotiations started by Raffles in 1819, and the agreement is now sometimes called the Crawfurd Treaty. He also had input into the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 dealing with spheres of influence in the East Indies.\n\nCrawfurd was on familiar terms with Munshi Abdullah. He edited and contributed to the \"Singapore Chronicle\" of Francis James Bernard, the first local newspaper that initially appeared dated 1 January 1824. Crawford Street and Crawford Bridge in Singapore are named after him.\n\nCrawfurd was sent on another envoy mission to Burma in 1826, by Hastings's successor Lord Amherst, in the aftermath of the First Anglo-Burmese War. It was to be his last political service for the Company. The party included Adoniram Judson as interpreter and Nathaniel Wallich as botanist. Crawfurd's journey to Ava up the River Irrawaddy was by paddle steamer, the \"Diana\": it had been hired by the East India Company for the war, where it had seen action and travelled 400 miles up the Irrawaddy. There were five local boats, and soldiers making up a party of over 50.\n\nCrawfurd at the court found Bagyidaw temporising despite a weak position with the British forces in Arakan and Tenasserim. The king conceded only a trade agreement, in return for a delay in indemnity payments; and sent his own mission to Calcutta.\n\nThe expedition fortuitously was delayed on the return journey for repairs. Crawfurd collected significant fossils, north of Magwe on the left bank of the river, in seven chests. Back in London, William Clift identified a new species of mastodon (more accurately Stegolophodon) from them; Hugh Falconer also worked on the collection. The finds, of fossil bones and wood, were discussed further in a paper by William Buckland, giving details; and they brought Crawfurd the friendship of Roderick Murchison, Foreign Secretary of the Geological Society. There were also collected 18,000 botanical specimens, many of which went to the Calcutta Botanic Garden.\nIn the United Kingdom, Crawfurd spent around 40 years in varied activities. He wrote as an orientalist, geographer and ethnologist. He tried parliamentary politics, without success; he agitated for free trade; and he was a publicist for and against colonisation schemes, in line with his views. He also represented the interests of British traders based in Singapore and Calcutta.\n\nCrawfurd made several unsuccessful attempts to enter the British Parliament in the 1830s. His campaign literature featured universal suffrage and the secret ballot, free trade and opposition to monopolies, public education and reduction of military spending, and opposition to regressive taxation and the taxation of Dissenters for a state church, with nationalisation of Church of England properties. He joined the Parliamentary Candidate Society, founded by Thomas Erskine Perry (his brother-in-law), to promote \"fit and proper\" Members of Parliament. He also joined the Radical Club, a breakaway from the National Political Union founded in 1833 by William Wallis.\n\nCrawfurd unsuccessfully contested, as an advanced radical, Glasgow in 1832, Paisley in 1834, Stirling Burghs in 1835, and Preston in 1837. At Glasgow he polled fourth (there were two MPs for the borough), with Sir Daniel Sandford third. In March 1834 it was Sandford who was elected at Paisley. \"Alexander's East India and Colonial Magazine\" struck a note of regret after his defeat at Stirling Burghs.\n\nOn 31 January 1834 Crawfurd supported Thomas Perronet Thompson in a meeting agitating against the Corn Laws. Thomas Carlyle alluded, in notes on one of Jane Welsh Carlyle's letters, to Crawfurd speaking at a radical meeting at the London Tavern set up by Charles Buller on 21 November 1834; in which he showed much more originality than John Arthur Roebuck, but lost his thread.\n\nIn Preston in the 1837 general election Crawfurd had the Liberal nomination in a three-cornered fight for two seats, as Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood was regarded as a waverer by the Conservatives who ran Robert Townley Parker against him; but he polled third. He also supported John Temple Leader's candidacy at Westminster against Sir Francis Burdett, being deputy chairman on his election committee (with Thomas Prout, chairman Sir Ronald Craufurd Ferguson). Crawfurd spoke with George Grote at a meeting for Leader at the Belgrave Hotel.\n\nA lifelong advocate of free trade policies, in \"A View of the Present State and Future Prospects of the Free Trade and Colonization of India\" (1829), Crawfurd made an extended case against the East India Company's approach, in particular in excluding British entrepreneurs, and in failing to develop Indian cotton. He had had experience in Java of the export possibilities for cotton textiles. He then gave evidence in March 1830 to a parliamentary committee, on the East India Company's monopoly of trade with China. Robert Montgomery Martin criticised Crawfurd, and the evidence of Robert Rickards, an ex-employee of the Company, for exaggerating the financial burden of the monopoly on tea. Crawfurd put out a pamphlet, \"Chinese Monopoly Examined\". Ross Donnelly Mangles defended the East India Company in 1830, in an answer addressed to Rickards and Crawfurd. When the Company's charter came up for renewal in 1833, the China trade monopoly was broken. Crawfurd's part as parliamentary agent for interests in Calcutta had been paid (at £1500 per year); his publicity work had included facts for an \"Edinburgh Review\" article written by another author.\n\nIn reviewing Edward Gibbon Wakefield's \"New British Province of South Australia\", and subsequent writing in the \"Westminster Review\", Crawfurd gave an opinion against systematic colonisation. He considered that abundant land and individual enterprise were the necessary elements. Robert Torrens, who floated the South Australian Land Company, replied to the \"Westminster Review\" line in \"Colonization of South Australia\" (1835). Part I of the book is a \"Letter\" to Crawfurd.\n\nIn 1843 Crawfurd gave evidence to the Colonial Office on Port Essington, on the north coast of Australia, to the effect that its climate made it unsuitable for settlement. He returned to the topic in a debate in 1858 on settlements on the Victoria River, as had been suggested by Sir George Everest. He generally opposed Sir Roderick Murchison's promotion of European colonisation of Australia, as far as it applied to the north coast.\n\nWhen the Stamp Act 1827 was passed, meaning that all public documents in India would have to pay a stamp tax (including newspapers as well as legal documents), Crawfurd was hired as London agent for a group of British merchants in Calcutta opposing the legislation. Crawfurd involved Joseph Hume, and he obtained newspaper coverage for his cause, including in \"The Examiner\" where the precedents from America were cited. He also wrote pamphlets himself, in which he advocated an end to the East India Company monopoly, and European colonisation. These moves occurred in 1828–9; in 1830 Crawfurd approached William Huskisson directly. His lobbying continued with the free trade issues mentioned above. \"Inquiry into the System of Taxation in India, Letters on the Interior of India, an attack on the newspaper stamp-tax and the duty on paper entitled Taxes on Knowledge\" (1836) is a related work.\n\nIn 1855 Crawfurd went with a delegation to the Board of Control of the East India Company, with representations on behalf of the Straits dollar as an independent currency. Crawfurd lobbied in both Houses of Parliament, with George Keppel, 6th Earl of Albemarle acting to bring a petition to the Lords, and William Ewart Gladstone putting the case in the Commons. Among the arguments put was that the dollar was a decimal currency, while the rupee used by traders, and legal tender in East India Company territories since it was coined in 1835, was not. In 1856 a Bill to change the status quo on coins minted and issued from India was defeated.\n\nIn 1868 Crawfurd with James Guthrie and William Paterson formed the Straits Settlements Association, to protect the colony's interests. Crawfurd was its first President.\n\nHe was elected President of the Ethnological Society in 1861. He died at his home in Elvaston Place, South Kensington, London on 11 May 1868 at the age of 85.\n\nCrawfurd wrote prolifically. His views have been seen as inconsistent: a recent author wrote that \"[...] Crawfurd seemed to embody a complex mixture of elements of coexisting but ultimately contradictory value systems\". A comment about \"hasty general opinions from a few instances\", by George Bennett on the topic of Papuan people, has been taken to be aimed at Crawfurd.\n\nHis 1822 work \"\"Malay of Champa\"\" contains a vocabulary of the Cham language.\n\nIn retirement after the Burmese mission, Crawfurd wrote books and papers on Eastern subjects. His envoy experiences from missions were written up in \"Journals\" in 1828 and 1829. This documentation was reprinted nearly 140 years later by Oxford University Press.\n\n\nAccording to Jane Rendall's concept of \"Scottish orientalism\", Crawfurd is a historian of the second generation. His \"History of the Indian Archipelago\" (1820), in three volumes, was his major work. Crawfurd was a critic of much of what the European nations had done in the area of Asia he covered.\n\n\"An Historical and Descriptive Account of China\" (1836) was a joint work in three volumes from the \"Edinburgh Cabinet Library\", with Hugh Murray, Peter Gordon, Thomas Lynn, William Wallace, and Gilbert Thomas Burnett.\n\nCrawfurd and Colin Mackenzie collected manuscripts from the capture of Yogyakarta, and some of these are now in the British Library.\n\nCrawfurd claimed Cham for the Austronesian languages. His suggestion met no favour at the time, but scholars from around 1950 onwards came to agree.\n\nCrawfurd held strong views on what he saw as the backwardness of the economy of India of his time. He attributed it to the weakness of Indian financial institutions, compared to Europe. His opinions were in an anonymous pamphlet \"A Sketch of the Commercial Resources and Monetary and Mercantile System of British India\" (1837) now attributed to him. Like Robert Montgomery Martin, he saw India primarily as a source of raw materials, and advocated investment based on that direction. A harsh critic of the existing Calcutta agencies, he noted the absence of bill broking in India and suggested that an exchange bank should be set up.\n\nHis view that an economy dominated by agriculture was inevitably an absolute government was cited by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in his \"On the Constitution of the Church and State\".\n\nWhile Crawfurd produced work that was ethnological in nature over a period of half a century, the term \"ethnology\" had not even been coined when he began to write. Attention has been drawn to his latest work, from the 1860s, which was copious, much criticised at the time, and which has also been scrutinised in the 21st century, as detailed below.\n\nCrawfurd held polygenist views, based on multiple origins of human groups; and these earned him, according to Sir John Bowring, the nickname \"the inventor of forty Adams\". In \"The Descent of Man\" by Charles Darwin, Crawfurd is cited as believing in 60 races. He expressed these views to the Ethnological Society of London (ESL), a traditional stronghold of monogenism (belief in a unified origin of humankind) where he had come in 1861 to hold office as President.\n\nCrawfurd believed in different races as separate creations by God in specific regional zones, with separate origins for languages, and possibly as different species. With Robert Gordon Latham of the ESL, he also opposed strongly the ideas of Max Müller on an original Aryan race.\n\nCrawfurd wrote in 1861 in the \"Transactions\" of the ESL a paper \"On the Conditions Which Favour, Retard, and Obstruct the Early Civilization of Man\", in which he argued for deficiencies in the science and technology of Asia. In \"On the Numerals as Evidence of the Progress of Civilization\" (1863) he argued that the social condition of a people correlates with the numeral words of their language. Crawfurd used domestication frequently as a metaphor. His racist views on black people were laughed at, during the British Association meeting at Birmingham in 1865.\n\nA paper by Crawfurd, \"On the Physical and Mental Characteristics of European and Asian Races of Man\", given 13 February 1866, argued for the superiority of Europeans. It particularly laid emphasis on European military dominance as evidence. Its thesis was directly contradicted at a meeting of the Society some weeks later, by Dadabhai Naoroji.\n\nRecent analyses have sought to clarify Crawfurd's agenda in his writings on race and, at this time, when he had become prominent in a young and still fluid field and discipline. Ellingson demonstrates Crawfurd's role in promoting the idea of the noble savage in service of racial ideology. Trosper has taken Ellingson's analysis a step further, attributing to Crawfurd a conscious \"spin\" put on the idea of primitive culture, a rhetorically sophisticated use of a \"straw man\" fallacy, achieved by bringing in, irrelevantly but for the sake of incongruity, the figure of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\n\nCrawfurd dedicated considerable effort to a critique of Darwin's theories of human evolution; as a proponent of polygenism, who believed that human races did not share common ancestors, Crawfurd was an early and prominent critic of Darwin's ideas. Right at the end of his life, in 1868, Crawfurd was using a \"missing link\" argument against Sir John Lubbock, in what Ellingson describes as a misrepresentation of a Darwinist viewpoint based on the idea that a precursor of humans must still be extant.\n\nEllingson points to a 1781 work of William Falconer, \"On the Influence of Climate\", with an attack on Rousseau, as a possible source of Crawfurd's thinking; while also pointing out some differences. Ellingson also places Crawfurd in a British group among those of his period whose anthropological views not only turned on race, but who also drew conclusions of superiority from those views, others being Luke Burke, James Hunt, Robert Knox, and Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie.\n\nCrawfurd's attitudes were not, however, based on human skin colour; and he was an opponent of slavery, having written an article \"Sugar without Slavery\" with Thomas Perronet Thompson in 1833 in the \"Westminster Review\". In dismissing Crawfurd's notes and suggestions on his work as \"quite unimportant\", Charles Darwin identified Crawfurd's racial views as \"Pallasian\", i.e. the analogue for humankind of the theories of Peter Simon Pallas.\n\nThe predominant approach in the ESL went back to James Cowles Prichard. In the view of Thomas Trautmann, in Crawfurd's attack on the Aryan theory there is a final rejection of the \"languages and nations\" approach, which was Prichard's, and a consequent freeing of (polygenist) racial theory.\n\nCrawfurd married Horatia Ann, daughter of James Perry. From 1821 to 1822, Mrs. Crawfurd had accompanied the Mission to Siam and Cochin China aboard the \"John Adam\". As the ship made way from Bangkok to Hué, Mrs. Crawfurd went ashore on an island in the Gulf of Siam, where she made a considerable impression upon the natives. The writer Oswald John Frederick Crawfurd, born in 1834, was their son. The couple knew John Sterling, and the Carlyles. Thomas Carlyle met Henry Crabb Robinson at dinner at the Crawfurds (25 November 1837, at 27 Wilton Crescent), making a poor impression.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The company’s first product, Total, was the first commercial database management system that was not bundled with manufacturer hardware and proprietary software.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Tom Nies, a salesman and project manager at IBM, had noticed that software was becoming a more important component of computer systems and decided to work for a business that sold software. The only software businesses in existence at that time were a small number of service bureaus, none of which was located in Cincinnati, where Nies resided. In 1968, Nies joined Claude Bogardus and Tom Richley to found Cincom Systems, which initially only wrote programs for individual companies. Within its first year, the company realized that it was solving the same data management problems for its various clients. Nies proposed the solution of developing a core database management system that could be sold to multiple customers. Total was the result of this development effort.\n\nThe company he started was initially only writing programs for individual companies; Total came later.\n\nOn August 20, 1984, President Ronald Reagan called Cincom and Tom Nies \"the epitome of entrepreneurial spirit of American business.\"\n\nAt a time when each application program \"owned\" the data it used, a company often had multiple copies of similar information:\n\nThe problem was known, and CODASYL's \"Database Task Group Report\" wrote about it, as did General Electric and IBM. Cincom's TOTAL \"segregated out the programming logic from the application of the database.\"\n\nDespite IBM being \"where the money was,\" there was still the matter of large/OS or small/DOS,\nso they \"implemented 70 to 80 percent of the application programming logic in such a way \nthat it insulated the user from\" whichever they used; some used both.\n\nFrom 1968 through the present, Cincom founder Thomas M. Nies \nhas been the longest actively serving CEO in the computer industry, and Cincom Systems was described in 2001 as \"a venerable software firm, included in the Smithsonian national museum along with Microsoft as a software pioneer.\"\n\nConvinced that software was a potential profit center, rather than a drain on profits, as was then viewed by IBM management, Thomas M. Nies, left IBM late 1968 and brought along Tom Richley and Claude Bogardus. This executive trio functioned as sales and marketing (Nies), product development (Richley), and research and development (Bogardus). By March 1969, the company became a full-service organization by adding principals Judy Foegle Carlson (administration), George Fanady (custom systems), Doug Hughes (systems engineering), and Jan Litton (product installation).\n\nThe name Cincom was a contraction of the words \"Cincinnati\" and \"computer.\" \n\nInitially they simply wrote programs for local companies. At some point they realized that the data management aspects of many programs had enough similarity to develop a product. From this effort came what became \"Total\", an improvement and generalization of IBM's DBOMP. \n\nOther than IBM, which was still in the \"selling iron\" business, Cincom became the first U.S. software firm to promote the concept of a database management system (DBMS). Cincom delivered the first commercial database management system that was not bundled with a computer manufacturer's hardware and proprietary software.\n\nCincom introduced several new products during the 1970s, including:\n\n\n\nStarting in 1971, Cincom opened offices in Canada, England, Belgium, France, Italy, Australia, Japan, \nBrazil and Hong Kong.\n\nNew products introduced in the 1980s included:\n\n\n\n\nBy 1980, TOTAL product sales reached $250 million.\n\nNew products during the 1990s, included:\n\n\nNew products include:\n\n2007: Cincom generated over $100 million in revenue for the 21st straight year, a feat unmatched by any private software publisher in the world. Microsoft (a public company) is the only other software publisher in the world to reach this milestone.\n\n"}

{"id": "2333615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333615", "title": "Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons", "text": "Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons\n\nThe Federal Review Board for Media Harmful to Minors ( or BPjM) is an upper-level German federal agency subordinate to the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth. It is responsible for examining and censoring media works suspected to be harmful to young people. When determined they are, these works are entered onto an official list – a process known as \"\" (indexing) in German as part of child protection efforts. The decision to index a work has a variety of legal implications; chiefly, restrictions on sale and advertisement.\n\nThe basic rights of freedom of expression and artistic freedom in Article 5 of the German \"Grundgesetz\" are not guaranteed without limits. Along with the \"provisions of general laws and \"provisions [...] in the right of personal honor\", \"provisions for the protection of young persons\" may restrict freedom of expression (Article 5 Paragraph 2).\n\nThe \"\" , which came into effect in April 2003, is one such provision. It superseded the \"Gesetz über die Verbreitung jugendgefährdender Schriften\" (Law on the Distribution of Writings Harmful to Young Persons) as the legal basis for the restriction of freedom of expression when applied to physical media (printed works, videos, CD-ROMs etc.).\n\nThe \"Jugendmedienschutz-Staatsvertrag\" (State Treaty on Media Protection of Young Persons) between the different \"Länder\" came into effect on the same day as the \"Jugendschutzgesetz\" and regulates the distribution of broadcasts and virtual media. It also provides a legal basis for the actions of the \"BPjM\".\n\nThe original \"Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Schriften\" (Federal Department for Writings Harmful to Young Persons) was established on May 18, 1954, after the \"Gesetz über die Verbreitung jugendgefährdender Schriften\" was adopted on June 9, 1953. The presiding officers of the \"Bundesprüfstelle\" have been:\n\nThe first session deciding upon applications requesting the indexing of materials took place on July 9, 1954. The first two works indexed by the BPjS were Tarzan comics. The rationale for this was that they would affect young people in a \"nerve-inflaming and brutalizing way\" and \"transport them into an unreal world of lies\". Such works were supposedly \"the result of a degenerate imagination\".\n\nIn 1978 the number and type of institutions which could petition for a work to be indexed was widened considerably. Since then, not only the higher authorities with responsibility for young people in the \"Länder\" (states), but also the youth welfare offices of individual \"Kreise\" (districts) have been authorized to submit applications. The number of applications for indexing has multiplied significantly as a result of this.\n\nFollowing the Erfurt massacre (a Columbine-like shooting at a school in Erfurt), the \"Jugendschutzgesetz\" was passed in June 2002, replacing the \"Gesetz über die Verbreitung jugendgefährdender Schriften\" and the \"Gesetz zum Schutz der Jugend in der Öffentlichkeit\" (Law for Protection of Young Persons in Public Places). It came into effect on April 1, 2003.\n\nThe change in the law clarified the area over which the \"Bundesprüfstelle\" has authority. New forms of media such as websites and computer software were within its jurisdiction. As a result of these new powers the organisation's name was changed to the current \"Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien\". As previously, an examination order can result from the application of a state youth protection agency or from the request of a non-governmental youth organisation.\n\nFor video games, the new law also made the ratings of the USK compulsory. Games that have been given a rating by this organisation can no longer be put on the index.\n\nThe \"BPjM\" has the following responsibilities:\n\n§ 18 Paragraph 1 JuSchG (Youth Protection Law) defines jugendgefährdend as that which is harmful \"to the development of children or young people or to their education as autonomous and socially-compatible individuals\". Media that are \"immoral, brutalizing, or which provoke violence, crime or racial hatred\" are named as examples of this.\n\nUnder § 15 Paragraph 2 JSchG, certain types of content are subject to restricted distribution by virtue of the law on account of their obvious harm to young people, without the need to add them to the \"Index\". These include:\n\nHowever, as often it may not be immediately apparent whether a particular work has content as described in § 15, 2 JSchG, the \"Bundesprüfstelle\" is able to index such media for the purpose of clarification. The \"Bundesprüfstelle\" has consequently indexed works which deny the Holocaust, which would be indictable as \"Volksverhetzung\" or as bringing the memory of the deceased into disrepute, when the public prosecutor's office was not able to proceed further at that point.\n\nUpon the application (\"Antrag\") of a youth welfare office or at the request of an accredited non-governmental youth organisation, the \"BPjM\" examines whether a written work, film, computer game or other media product has content they consider harmful to young persons. If an application is made by a government body, the \"BPjM\" must always examine the media work. If a non-governmental body makes a request, the \"BPjM\" can decide itself if it needs to take action. No organization or individual other than the prescribed government bodies may make an \"Antrag\". In practice applications are normally made by the youth welfare offices.\n\nThe authors, producers or rightsholders of the work in question are notified of the application or request for indexing. They have the right to a legal hearing.\n\nThe \"Bundesprüfstelle\" may not continue with the indexing process, if one of the following requirements if met:\n\nThe decision whether a media work is harmful to young people is taken by the Zwölfer-Gremium (Panel of Twelve) or the Dreier-Gremium (Panel of Three). On these panels, youth protection agencies, the arts and business are represented by honorary assessors. The members of the panel act independently and not as directed by the interests they represent.\n\nThe Zwölfer-Gremium consists of:\n\nThe hearing, which representatives of the work in question can take part in, is oral and not open to the public. However, the presiding officer can allow third parties to attend the hearing. As in the courts, transcripts of the hearing are not published, but the written reasons for a decision can also be requested by those not involved in the proceedings. The names of the assessors are disclosed to those involved in the proceedings, and are also listed in both the transcript and the decision to index. If those not involved in the proceedings request the decision to index, any personal data (of assessors and also of any companies or lawyers involved) is removed.\n\nThe decision to index requires a majority of two thirds of the votes. If this majority is not reached, the indexing is rejected. In the event that the \"Bundesprüfstelle\" holds a meeting with the legal quorum of nine people, a qualified majority of seven must vote to index or the application will be rejected.\n\nThe Dreier-Gremium has jurisdiction only in cases where harm to young people is obvious. At least one assessor on the panel must be a representative of art, literature, the book trade and publishing, or the video or telecommunications industry. An application for indexing will be accepted only if the panel votes unanimously.\n\nThe person responsible for an indexed work can file suit against the decision to index in an administrative court.\n\nThe List of Media Harmful to Young People (colloquially known as the \"Index\") is published only for physical media (those whose content is stored as an object rather than virtually). The list of virtual media is not published so as to avoid advertising these works. It is technically illegal for third parties to publish the list, and the only sanctioned lists can be found in the official publications of the \"BPjM\". The lists are published in \"BPjM-Aktuell\", a quarterly journal which costs €11 per issue. Nonetheless, there are numerous lists available on the Internet that reveal which media has been indexed or confiscated.\n\nWhile these online lists are technically illegal, their right to exist and how the publication has yet been untested in court, as only a small number of them have shut down voluntarily after receiving warnings from a number of non-governmental youth protection associations. As such, it is as yet unknown whether a ban on the publication of these lists could be a violation of the Youth Protection Act. If it is not, then such a ban would not be permitted under article 5 of the German constitution.\n\nUnder the new \"Jugendschutzgesetz\", a decision to index remains valid for 25 years. After that, the work is automatically removed from the \"Index\". If the \"BPjM\" is of the opinion that there is still a risk of harm to young people, it must begin the legal proceedings afresh. After a popular movie has been removed from the index, there is usually a label that has it re-rated by the FSK (which does not rate indexed movies). Most previously indexed movies get an FSK 16 rating. As commercial interest in old video games is usually very low (see abandonware), no one wants to pay for a re-rating by the USK.\n\nIn the event that the material or legal situation changes, the rightsholders for an indexed work can apply for the proceedings to be re-opened under Article 51 of the \"Verwaltungsverfahrengesetz\" (the Administrative Proceedings Law) with the aim of removing the work from the list.\n\nThe List is subdivided into various sublists, and these in turn are subdivided into various indexes:\n\nThe legal consequences of a work being listed on the \"Index\" are enumerated in § 15 Jugendschutzgesetz (law for the protection of minors):\n\nIndexed content of lists A and C can, however, be advertised and sold to adults on the internet, if it is technically ensured that minors do not have access to the content (closed user groups). Media on lists B and D may be disseminated under the aforementioned conditions, however they not to be distributed through broadcasting system, including the internet.\n\nIt is a matter of dispute whether criticism or discussion of indexed works is allowed in works that are accessible to young people. Public prosecutors have not been unanimous in this regard, but publishers tend to err on the side of safety: In the German version of Marc Saltzman's \"Game Design: Secret of the Sages\", for example, the titles of indexed games were replaced by random strings matching only first letter and length.\n\nPornographic content on the internet is legal only if technical measures prohibit minors from getting access to the object (AVS = Age Verification System or Adult-Check-System).\n\nThe BPjM has drawn criticism for de facto censorship, paternalism, and restricting the freedom of speech and of the press on the following grounds:\n\n\nThe counter-argument states that the advertising ban on indexed works is not the aim of the decision to index, but its legal consequence. The \"BPjM\" sees it as its responsibility to use the decision to index works harmful to young people in order to raise awareness that there is content which is unsuitable and damaging for children and minors. This should consequently encourage public debate about the depiction of violence in the media or about other matters of concern.\n\nHowever, in practice this debate seldom takes place. One reason for this is the legal uncertainty as to whether a critical discussion of an indexed work is legally permissible or whether it infringes the advertising ban. This can be traced back to the differing positions of various public prosecutor's offices, and a clarification of the legal position by law enforcement agencies would consequently be helpful.\n\nThe critique that the \"BPjM\" is an organisation unique to Germany ignores the fact that other western countries also have laws and mechanisms, albeit different in scope and practice, to prevent, for example, the sale of pornography to minors, holocaust denial, or racist literature and hate speech.\n\nThe nature of the \"BPjM\"'s judgements has altered over the decades and been modified in accordance with changing public opinion. Decisions to index from the 1950s and 1960s, and indeed those from the early days of computer and video games, are unlikely to be made today. Regardless, many of these decisions are still in effect today. Consequently, the time period of 25 years that media is retained on the index is of high controversy.\n\nIn recent times, it has become more prevalent for digital games on PC to be bought as license keys, while an online-activation has to be undertaken to use the license. Many publishers deem it necessary to restrict activation out of Germany for certain games. This leaves German adults without the option to import said games, while consoles do not have those kind of restrictions. So far, importing console games has not led to an incrimination of any publisher. While indexing keeps a larger portion of the German population (especially parents) in ignorance over indexed media, due to the internet it is easier than ever for minors to inform themselves about new media which might be indexed in Germany and thus be of more interest to them. The indexing process is thus often labelled as outdated, useless for parents and the society as a whole. Since it seems to only just provide a thin veil of false security for youth protection, it leeds to a disproportionate factual restriction of adults' freedom of information.\n\nIndexing is not the only mechanism in use in Germany by which broader circulation of certain media works is prevented. Works may also receive a confiscation order by a court when certain articles of the \"Strafgesetzbuch\" apply to them, for example, glorification of violence or denial of the Holocaust. Confiscation results in a nationwide ban on its sale even to adults; the mere possession of such material remains legal (with the exception of child pornography).\n\nA well-known example of a confiscated work is \"Wolfenstein 3D\", which was confiscated due to the use of Nazi symbols such as swastikas. Since it was initially not been clarified in court whether video games constitute a form of art (like e.g. movies), the same has happened to later games in the franchise and any other computer game displaying Nazi symbols. These rulings were later loosened in August 2018 as a result of a ruling from April 2018. The web-based game \"Bundesfighter II Turbo\" was released prior to the September 2017 elections, which included parodies of the candidates fighting each other; this included Alexander Gauland, who had a special move that involved Swastika imagery. When this was noticed by public authorities, they began prosecution of the game in December 2017, submitting it to the Public Prosecutor General's office for review based on the \"Wolfenstein 3D\" decision. The Attorney General declined to consider the game illegal under Strafgesetzbuch section 86a, stating that the 1998 ruling was outdated; since then, USK had adopted age ratings for video games, and that there was no reason not to consider video games as art within the social adequacy clause. As a result, the Supreme Youth Protection Authority of the Federal States adapted the Attorney General's ruling to be applicable for all video games within Germany, and subsequently the USK announced in August 2018 this change; USK will still review all games to judge if the use of imagery under Section 86a remains within the social adequacy clause and deny ratings to those that fail to meet this allowance.\n\n\n"}

From 1895 to 1911 he served as professor of the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts (ASP) in Kraków, and from 1934, ASP in Warsaw. He was a founding member of the Society of Polish Artists \"Sztuka\" (Art, 1897).\n\nWyczółkowski was born in Huta Miastowska near Garwolin. At first, in his artistic experience he aimed at devoting himself to the genre of historical painting with documentary realism in the detail. After his trip to Paris though, he changed his focus and began implementing solutions typical of the French Impressionists. He painted dramatic landscapes, nudes and pastoral scenes with impasto and impressionist lighting effects (e.g., \"Paddling Fishermen\"). For a short while he came under the influence of Symbolism (e.g., \"Fossilized Druid\"), and around 1900 darkened his palette. His work is characterized by a richness of form and complex technical means. Thanks to a friendship with Feliks Manggha Jasieński, he expanded his interests to include oriental scenes as well.

Owned by Entravision Communications, it is a sister station to low-powered Class A UniMás affiliate WUTH-CD (channel 47). The two stations share studios at Constitution Plaza in downtown Hartford and transmitter facilities on Birch Mountain Road in Glastonbury, Connecticut.\n\nWUVN operates a low-powered semi-satellite in Springfield, Massachusetts, WHTX-LD (channel 24), which airs the same programming as provided by its parent but airs separate commercial inserts and station identifications. WHTX-LD's transmitter is located on Provin Mountain in the Feeding Hills section of Agawam, Massachusetts; aside from that, it does not maintain any facilities in Springfield or Holyoke. Master control and some internal operations for WHTX-LD are based at WUVN's facilities.\n\nWUVN is one of the oldest UHF stations in New England. It began operation on October 2, 1954, as WGTH-TV, a primary ABC/secondary DuMont affiliate. The station was initially owned by a partnership of \"The Hartford Times\" and General Teleradio, along with WGTH radio (1410 AM, now WPOP), but was sold to CBS in 1956, shortly after Hartford and New Haven were merged into a single market. The station's call letters were changed to WHCT, for \"Hartford CBS Television\" (or alternatively \"Hartford, ConnecticuT\", or \"Hartford Christian Television\" in its later years, according to some sources).\n\nAs a CBS station, WHCT's ratings were low because television sets were not required to have UHF tuners until 1964. Even with a very expensive converter, UHF signals were very unclear at the time. In 1957, Travelers Insurance Company, owners of WTIC-AM-FM, signed on WTIC-TV on channel 3. By 1958, CBS had concluded that it was better to have its programming on a VHF station, even if it was only an affiliate. It moved its Hartford affiliation to WTIC-TV, and sold WHCT to a group led by Edward Taddei, which turned it into an independent station. Channel 3, which is now WFSB, has been Hartford's CBS affiliate ever since then. Two years later, what had become RKO General retook ownership of the station, this time without the involvement of the \"Times\".\n\nAs an independent, WHCT's schedule consisted of cartoons, movies, off-network sitcoms and dramas, sports (including New York Mets baseball games), public affairs programming, and religious shows. However, it never really thrived, even with the addition of all-channel tuning. Beginning in 1962, the station ran a subscription television service from 7:00 p.m. to midnight, with first-run movies and sports events from Madison Square Garden. A decade before the 1972 launch of pay cable network HBO, WHCT's programming was an experiment between RKO and Zenith, who provided the \"Phonevision\" descrambler boxes. WHCT could be seen by all viewers with a UHF tuner and antenna during regular broadcast hours, but viewers needed a decoder box in order to view the signal during the subscription television block. The first pay-TV movie was \"Sunrise at Campobello\", starring Ralph Bellamy and Greer Garson. The subscription television service could only broadcast in black and white, despite the fact that many of the movies shown were made in color. It was deemed a failure, and RKO dropped it early in 1968. By then, the station had slashed its operating hours, signing on at 1 p.m. in the afternoon and signing off late at night. The future host of \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" from 1994 to 2016, Charles Osgood, was general manager of the station. By 1970, the station was signing on at 10 a.m. and had a moderate amount of then-strong programming, including \"Gilligan's Island\", \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\", \"McHale's Navy\", \"Mister Ed\", \"Bugs Bunny\", \"The Fugitive\", \"The Untouchables\" and \"What's My Line?\", as well as the RKO film library. They also ran \"Romper Room\", which was produced at then-sister station WOR-TV in New York.\n\nIn 1971, RKO put the station up for sale, but after failing to receive a financially significant offer, they donated the station in February 1972 to California's Faith Center, led by Reverend Ray Schoch, an ordained minister by the Assemblies of God. At the time, Faith Center was a Christian TV ministry, similar to the more well-known Christian Broadcasting Network, of the Evangelical Pentecostal denomination. They produced some of their own programming while also selling time to like-minded outside ministries. Under Schoch, the station began to air religious programming in the morning and late evening hours, while continuing to air general entertainment programming from noon to 8 p.m. and again after 10 p.m. The religious shows consisted of several national televangelists, as well as programming featuring Pastor Schoh himself. The plan was for WHCT to remain commercial, unlike Faith Center's Los Angeles and San Francisco stations. WHCT also broadcast games of the World Hockey Association's New England Whalers. In 1974, WHCT added daily runs of \"The PTL Club\" and \"The 700 Club\" to their lineup and was about half-religious and half-secular by 1975.\n\nDr. Eugene Scott joined the ministry as a financial consultant in 1974 and assistant to Schoch early in 1975. That year, Pastor Schoch became ill and retired from the ministry full-time, and Dr. Scott (who by then had left the Assemblies of God and whose religious views were changing) took over station operations. Under Scott, WHCT was put up for sale and almost sold to the Christian Broadcasting Network. Plans would have been for WHCT to become a stronger independent general entertainment station. But for various reasons the sale was aborted late in 1975. That year, as shows expired, WHCT did not renew them and gradually added more religious programming, with only some low-budget secular shows. The hours on the air also declined to about 8 hours a day. Sister stations KVOF and KHOF also began to decline as well under Scott. Pastor Schoch died in 1977, by which time movies were gone from the WHCT schedule, as were cartoons. \n\nWHCT was almost exclusively religious by 1978 and all religious by 1979, with Gene Scott's programming taking up about 8 hours a day and other religious shows about 6 hours a day. The station's transmitter was damaged late in 1979, forcing it to broadcast at low power. As a result, religious groups stopped buying time on WHCT, and the station had no money to make any programming investments or fully repair the transmitter. By 1981, the station aired Dr. Scott's shows full-time during the 12 hours a day the station was on the air. Scott, whose views had changed from Conservative, Evangelical and Pentecostal to more libertarian militant views, would provide rambling discourses on wide-ranging topics.\n\nWHCT was put up for a \"distress\" sale in 1981, with the stipulation from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that the station be sold to minority ownership. After some legal wrangling, Astroline Communications took ownership of the station in 1984, took the station dark upon taking over, replaced the transmitter, and put WHCT back on the air in September 1985 with a lineup of movies, reruns, and syndicated programming not shown on the other two Connecticut independents, WTXX (channel 20, now WCCT-TV) and WTIC-TV (channel 61). The station also once again carried what was by then the Hartford Whalers, who were part of the a National Hockey League, from 1986 until 1990. The station ran a mix of older sitcoms, older movies, drama shows, and a small number of children's programs. Beginning in August 1986, WHCT also ran Home Shopping Network overnights from 1 to 6 a.m. However, WHCT continued to underperform in the ratings, due to formidable competition and better lineups offered by WTXX and WTIC. Hartford–New Haven was not big enough at the time to support three independent stations, and it did not help matters that New York City's three major independents–WNEW-TV (now WNYW), WOR-TV (now WWOR-TV) and WPIX, as well as Boston's WSBK-TV and WLVI–were all available on cable, and as the FCC's SyndEx rules did not go into effect until 1990, WHCT had no method to stop their ratings from being cannibalized by those regional superstations. WTIC-TV also had its share of financial problems, and dropped a number of shows that WHCT picked up. However, these programs did not help WHCT at all and put the station deeper into debt. Much of the financial problems came as a result of challenges to WHCT's license, as Gene Scott was supposed to sell the station at market value to minority owners, but challengers alleged that this was not the case because minorities did not have voting stock in the station. Additionally, issues with former owner RKO also played a role in the legal matters. Legal fees, while not the only problem, did play a role in preventing the station from really growing.\n\nBy the spring of 1989, WHCT was in serious financial trouble. Syndicated shows were pulled off the station daily because program distributors were not being paid; much of this programming would migrate to New London station WTWS (channel 26, now WHPX-TV). With the station's finances and program supply dwindling, WHCT gradually increased the amount of paid programming and infomercials on its schedule, to the point where it ultimately ran them for 6 hours a day. They also ran the Home Shopping Network about 12 hours a day and some low-budget movies and drama shows about 6 hours a day. Finally, in 1990, WHCT filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. On April 4, 1991, the bankruptcy filing was converted to Chapter 7, and soon afterwards the station was ordered off the air by the Federal Bankruptcy Court, with its equipment repossessed to satisfy the creditors' demands. On April 9, WHCT ceased operations.\n\nTwo if By Sea Broadcasting attempted to purchase the station in 1993, but its application was tied up in a license renewal dispute between Astroline and Shurberg Broadcasting, in which Shurberg alleged that Astroline had misrepresented itself as a minority broadcaster in order to purchase the station. In the meantime, WHCT stayed dark until February 5, 1997, when the bankruptcy trustee for Astroline, to avoid the license being automatically canceled by the FCC on February 9, put the station back on the air with programming provided by Paxson Communications (which sold WTWS soon afterward). The FCC designated WHCT's license for hearing that April. Paxson's inTV service was dropped from WHCT in June 1998 in favor of Shop at Home Network programming, and the Pax TV affiliation for Hartford ultimately went to the renamed WHPX (though WHCT still carried some Worship Network programming, as well as Boston Red Sox games declined by WBNE (channel 59, now WCTX), in addition to Shop at Home). Another affiliation change took place in January 1999, when the station affiliated with ValueVision (now Evine).\nThe Astroline-Shurberg dispute continued even after an administrative law judge approved WHCT's license renewal and the sale to Two if By Sea in 1999, as Shurberg raised concerns about that company's qualifications. As a result, the following year, Entravision Communications proposed to purchase the station for $18 million, to be split between Shurberg, Two if By Sea, and Astroline. Although Entravision's offer was itself briefly threatened by both a separate dispute with Barbara Laurence, in which Laurence attempted to obtain a 10 percent stake in WHCT, as well as WNTO (now WVEN-TV) in Daytona Beach, Florida, by alleging that she found the stations for Entravision, and a complaint from Astroline general partner Richard Ramirez over a payment by the bankruptcy trustee to Shurberg, it was eventually approved; the station changed its call letters to WUVN that December, and dropped ValueVision in favor of Univision's Spanish-language programming on April 1, 2001. Since then, WUVN has largely been a semi-satellite of Boston's WUNI.\n\nWHTX-LD has its origins in W10CG, a low-power station on channel 10 in Hartford that signed on in February 1997, became WHTX-LP on March 31, and shut down in December 1998 to make room for WTNH (channel 8)'s digital signal; its programming from America One and the American Independent Network moved to former simulcast partner WMLD-LP (channel 6, now WRNT-LD on channel 32). As the station did not return to the air within a year of going dark, the license was deemed to have expired by the Federal Communications Commission on October 11, 2002. However, original owner Harvard Broadcasting claimed to the FCC that WHTX had briefly resumed operations on an annual basis, and the license was reinstated a month later; it was sold to Entravision soon thereafter. Entravision moved the station to channel 43 in Springfield, and signed the new WHTX-LP on the air in November 2003 as a semi-satellite of WUVN. WHTX was picked up by Comcast's Springfield-area systems on July 10, 2006, replacing the national Univision feed.\n\nSoon after WHTX made its move, however, Meredith Corporation filed an objection, stating that the station's claimed resumptions were not enough to avoid the automatic expiration of its license, and that there were sufficient channels available in the Hartford area for WHTX to use to accommodate WTNH. As a result, the move was never formally granted even a construction permit, and was operated by a series of special temporary authority grants; on March 9, 2009, the FCC overturned the reinstatement of the WHTX license and revoked its operating authority. Nonetheless, its programming continued to remain available on cable and on WUVN's digital channel 18.2. After finding that there was insufficient evidence to prove that WHTX-LP had in fact failed to operate for twelve consecutive months, the FCC again reinstated the station's license on November 3, 2014 and directed Entravision to file a new displacement application; on November 7, it filed to construct a digital companion channel for WHTX, again specifying operation on channel 43 in Springfield. The WHTX-LD signal was licensed on September 29, 2015. WHTX-LD now serves as a complete simulcast of WUVN.\n\nWUVN's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\nIn the station's early years, WGTH-TV aired a local newscast, hiring away Charles Norwood from WNHC-TV (now WTNH). WHCT made another attempt at a news operation for a short time in 1969, experimenting with a 10 p.m. newscast anchored by Pat Sheehan (another attempt at a 10 p.m. newscast would not be attempted until 20 years later, when WTIC-TV launched such a newscast, itself anchored at first by Sheehan).\n\nUpon the sale to Entravision, the company announced that it would launch a Spanish-language local news operation on WUVN.

It is also used for some purposes in the UK tax system.\n\nThe number is sometimes referred to as a NI No or NINO.\n\nShortly before a person's 16th birthday, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) notifies them of their NI number. re in receipt of Child Benefit. As a result of this, siblings who met the criteria above were allocated NI numbers sequentially.\n\nPersons from abroad who wish to work in the UK, or those to whom a number was not initially allocated as children, must apply for a number through the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).\nThe prefixes used are typically different from those used in the normal run.\n\nThe format of the number is two prefix letters, six digits and one suffix letter. An example is \"QQ123456C\".\n\nNeither of the first two letters can be D, F, I, Q, U or V. The second letter also cannot be O. The prefixes BG, GB, NK, KN, TN, NT and ZZ are not allocated. Validation lists of issued two-letter prefixes are published from time to time.\n\nAfter the two prefix letters, the six digits are issued sequentially from to . The last two digits determine the day of the week on which various social security benefits are payable and when unemployed claimants need to attend their Jobcentre to sign on (renew their claims): \"00\" to \"19\" for Monday, \"20\" to \"39\" for Tuesday, \"40\" to \"59\" for Wednesday, \"60\" to \"79\" for Thursday and \"80\" to \"99\" for Friday.\n\nThe suffix letter is either A, B, C, or D. (although F, M, and P have been used for temporary numbers in the past). The NI number is unique without the suffix letter, so, for example, if exists, then there will be no other numbers beginning with (although temporary numbers were not necessarily unique, because two people with the same date of birth would have had the same number). In official electronic submissions, the final letter may be represented by a space if not known.\n\nUntil 1975, the suffixes A, B, C and D at the end of the NI number signified the period of validity of the \"National Insurance cards\" originally used to collect \"National Insurance contributions\" (NICs). Cards were exchanged every twelve months and because of the very large numbers of cards issued the exchange was staggered. Suffix A cards ran from March of one year until March of the next when they were exchanged for a new one. Stagger B suffix cards ran from June until the following June, stagger C from September until the following September and stagger D from December until the following December. For example, a B stagger card issued in 1955 might have run from the first Monday in June that year until the first Sunday in June the following year. This staggered system operated from 5 July 1948 until 1975, at which time the A stagger cards were extended to run an extra five weeks, until 5 April 1975, in line with the end of the tax year. The B, C and D stagger NI Cards had a shorter period of validity in their final year and ran from June, September and December respectively in 1974 until 6 April 1975. From 6 April 1975 onwards, a computerised National Insurance Recording System (NIRS) was used to allocate all NICs by tax years.\n\nIn Great Britain, expired NI cards were sorted into one hundred separate groups corresponding to the final two numbers of the NI number and were posted to the individual insured person's NI account (the RF1) by the corresponding one hundred ledger sections at the Records Branch of the Central Office of the Ministry of Labour and its successors—the Ministry of National Insurance (from 1945), Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance (1953), the Department of Health and Social Security (1968), Department of Social Security (1988), and Department for Work and Pensions (since 2001). These 100 sections dealt not only with the recording of NI contributions but with requests for information about qualifying contributions necessary to pay sickness, unemployment, widows, and other benefits and also with any correspondence arising from those NI accounts and NI cards. Within each of the 100 sections, NI numbers were allocated among 16 splits with one clerk administering each split. To trace unknown NI numbers, a general index contained millions of small RF2 index slips, filed in order of surname and listing the name(s), date of birth, and NI number for every person within the National Insurance scheme.\n\nThe Northern Ireland National Insurance scheme is funded and administered separately from the scheme in Great Britain but operates identically so that, in practice, the same rules apply throughout the United Kingdom.\n\nUntil April 2001, employers sometimes allocated their employees a temporary insurance number, which followed the format , where 'TN' stands for temporary number and is static and \"x\" is M for male, F for female, or P for pensioner and the numbers in the midsection were the employee's date of birth. In the case of a woman born on 31 December 1958, for example, the temporary NI number would have been . Temporary NI numbers could not be used to trace back any NI credits or personal details. Since 2001 the National Insurance number must be obtained – the temporary code must not now be used.\n\nAnother type of temporary NI number is the Revenue-issued \"temporary reference\" used when HMRC is unable to trace a taxpayer's original NI number. It follows the format \"63T12345\".\n\nReference numbers similar in format to NI numbers are sometimes allocated for tax or benefit purposes with special prefix letters. Special prefixes used in the past include the letters OO (for Tax Credit claims), CR (for investigations), FY (formerly for Attendance Allowance claims, named after the Fylde social security office where claims were processed), MW (used from 1980 to 1987 for migrant workers), NC (formerly for Stakeholder Pensions, PP (for use by pension schemes as PP999999P), and PY or PZ (both used for tax-only accounts created prior to 2003).\n\nPrior to 1984, when a person was allocated an NI number, a manila notification card was issued to them. From 1984 until 2011, they also received a plastic 'numbercard', of similar proportions to a credit card, with the number raised on the front. The card was only used as a reminder of the number; it was not needed to start work, and was not considered a valid identity card. Numbercards were phased out after September 2010 and their issue ceased in October 2011. NI numbers are now notified by letter.\n\nNational Insurance numbers issued in the Isle of Man hold the prefix MA. Similarly, those issued in Jersey start with JY, and those issued in Guernsey hold the prefix GY. Only Channel Island NINOs issued prior to 1975 are validated, and recognised for UK use by HMRC.\n\nThe National Insurance number is used as a reference number in the Pay As You Earn system, and also by the self-employed. It is also used in applications for Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), to check that an individual has opened only one ISA in a tax year.\n\nHowever, the NI number is not used universally as a tax identification number. Taxpayers who need to file a tax return are given a different number, a Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR), which is used as a reference number in the self-assessment tax system.\n\nNI numbers are sometimes used for identification purposes in other contexts which have nothing to do with their original National Insurance purpose – such as forming part of evidence of right to work in the UK. The NI card, however, is not proof of identity.\n\n"}

{"id": "2333728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333728", "title": "Haumea", "text": "Haumea\n\nHaumea (minor-planet designation 136108 Haumea) is a likely dwarf planet located beyond Neptune's orbit. It was discovered in 2004 by a team headed by Mike Brown of Caltech at the Palomar Observatory in the United States and independently in 2005, by a team headed by José Luis Ortiz Moreno at the Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain, though the latter claim has been contested. On September 17, 2008, it was named after Haumea, the Hawaiian goddess of childbirth, under the expectation by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) that it would prove to be a dwarf planet.\n\nHaumea's mass is about one-third that of Pluto, and 1/1400 that of Earth. Although its shape has not been directly observed, calculations from its light curve indicate that it is a Jacobi ellipsoid, with its major axis twice as long as its minor. In October 2017, astronomers announced the discovery of a ring system around Haumea, representing the first ring system discovered for a trans-Neptunian object. Haumea's gravity was until recently thought to be sufficient for it to have relaxed into hydrostatic equilibrium. Haumea's elongated shape together with its rapid rotation, rings, and high albedo (from a surface of crystalline water ice), are thought to be the consequences of a giant collision, which left Haumea the largest member of a collisional family that includes several large trans-Neptunian objects and Haumea's two known moons, Hiʻiaka and Namaka. Haumea is currently the third-largest known trans-Neptunian object, after Eris and Pluto.\n\nTwo teams claim credit for the discovery of Haumea. Mike Brown and his team at Caltech discovered Haumea in December 28, 2004 on images they had taken on May 6, 2004. On July 20, 2005, they published an online abstract of a report intended to announce the discovery at a conference in September 2005. At around this time, José Luis Ortiz Moreno and his team at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía at Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain found Haumea on images taken on March 7–10, 2003. Ortiz emailed the Minor Planet Center with their discovery on the night of July 27, 2005.\n\nBrown initially conceded discovery credit to Ortiz, but came to suspect the Spanish team of fraud upon learning that his observation logs were accessed from the Spanish observatory the day before the discovery announcement.\n\nThese logs included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images, and they were accessed again just before Ortiz scheduled telescope time to obtain confirmation images for a second announcement to the MPC on July 29. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating he was merely verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Precovery images of Haumea have been identified back to March 22, 1955.\n\nIAU protocol is that discovery credit for a minor planet goes to whoever first submits a report to the MPC (Minor Planet Center) with enough positional data for a decent determination of its orbit, and that the credited discoverer has priority in choosing a name. However, the IAU announcement on September 17, 2008, that Haumea had been named by dual committee established for bodies expected to be dwarf planets, did not mention a discoverer. The location of discovery was listed as the Sierra Nevada Observatory of the Spanish team, but the chosen name, Haumea, was the Caltech proposal; Ortiz's team had proposed \"Ataecina\", the ancient Iberian goddess of spring, which as a chthonic deity would have been more appropriate for a plutino.\n\nUntil it was given a permanent name, the Caltech discovery team used the nickname \"Santa\" among themselves, because they had discovered Haumea on December 28, 2004, just after Christmas. The Spanish team were the first to file a claim for discovery to the Minor Planet Center, in July 2005. On July 29, 2005, Haumea was given the provisional designation 2003 EL, based on the date of the Spanish discovery image. On September 7, 2006, it was numbered and admitted into the official minor planet catalogue as (136108) 2003 EL.\n\nFollowing guidelines established at the time by the IAU that classical Kuiper belt objects be given names of mythological beings associated with creation, in September 2006 the Caltech team submitted formal names from Hawaiian mythology to the IAU for both (136108) 2003 EL and its moons, in order \"to pay homage to the place where the satellites were discovered\". The names were proposed by David Rabinowitz of the Caltech team. \"Haumea\" is the matron goddess of the island of Hawaii, where the Mauna Kea Observatory is located. In addition, she is identified with Papa, the goddess of the earth and wife of Wākea (space), which, at the time, seemed appropriate because Haumea was thought to be composed almost entirely of solid rock, without the thick ice mantle over a small rocky core typical of other known Kuiper belt objects. Lastly, Haumea is the goddess of fertility and childbirth, with many children who sprang from different parts of her body; this corresponds to the swarm of icy bodies thought to have broken off the main body during an ancient collision. The two known moons, also believed to have formed in this manner, are thus named after two of Haumea's daughters, Hiʻiaka and Nāmaka.\n\nThe proposal by the Ortiz team, Ataecina, did not meet IAU naming requirements, because the names of chthonic deities were reserved for stably resonant trans-Neptunian objects such as plutinos that resonate 3:2 with Neptune, whereas Haumea was in an intermittent 7:12 resonance and so by some definitions was not a resonant body. The naming criteria would be clarified in late 2019, when the IAU decided that chthonic figures were to be used specifically for plutinos. \"(See Ataecina § Dwarf planet.)\"\n\nHaumea has an orbital period of 284 Earth years, a perihelion of 35 AU, and an orbital inclination of 28°. It passed aphelion in early 1992, and is currently more than 50 AU from the Sun. Haumea's orbit has a slightly greater eccentricity than that of the other members of its collisional family. This is thought to be due to Haumea's weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune gradually modifying its initial orbit over the course of a billion years, through the Kozai effect, which allows the exchange of an orbit's inclination for increased eccentricity.\n\nWith a visual magnitude of 17.3, Haumea is the third-brightest object in the Kuiper belt after Pluto and , and easily observable with a large amateur telescope. However, because the planets and most small Solar System bodies share a common orbital alignment from their formation in the primordial disk of the Solar System, most early surveys for distant objects focused on the projection on the sky of this common plane, called the ecliptic. As the region of sky close to the ecliptic became well explored, later sky surveys began looking for objects that had been dynamically excited into orbits with higher inclinations, as well as more distant objects, with slower mean motions across the sky. These surveys eventually covered the location of Haumea, with its high orbital inclination and current position far from the ecliptic.\n\nHaumea is in an intermittent 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune. Its ascending node formula_1 precesses with a period of about 4.6 million years, and the resonance is broken twice per precession cycle, or every 2.3 million years, only to be reestablished a hundred thousand years or so later. The resonance will next be broken a quarter million years from now.\n\nHaumea displays large fluctuations in brightness over a period of 3.9 hours, which can only be explained by a rotational period of this length. This is faster than any other known equilibrium body in the Solar System, and indeed faster than any other known body larger than 100 km in diameter. While most rotating bodies in equilibrium are flattened into oblate spheroids, Haumea rotates so quickly that it is distorted into a triaxial ellipsoid. If Haumea were to rotate much more rapidly, it would distort itself into a dumbbell shape and split in two. This rapid rotation is thought to have been caused by the impact that created its satellites and collisional family.\n\nThe size of a Solar System object can be deduced from its optical magnitude, its distance, and its albedo. Objects appear bright to Earth observers either because they are large or because they are highly reflective. If their reflectivity (albedo) can be ascertained, then a rough estimate can be made of their size. For most distant objects, the albedo is unknown, but Haumea is large and bright enough for its thermal emission to be measured, which has given an approximate value for its albedo and thus its size. However, the calculation of its dimensions is complicated by its rapid rotation. The rotational physics of deformable bodies predicts that over as little as a hundred days, a body rotating as rapidly as Haumea will have been distorted into the equilibrium form of a triaxial ellipsoid. It is thought that most of the fluctuation in Haumea's brightness is caused not by local differences in albedo but by the alternation of the side view and end view as seen from Earth.\n\nThe rotation and amplitude of Haumea's light curve were argued to place strong constraints on its composition. If Haumea were in hydrostatic equilibrium and had a low density like Pluto, with a thick mantle of ice over a small rocky core, its rapid rotation would have elongated it to a greater extent than the fluctuations in its brightness allow. Such considerations constrained its density to a range of 2.6–3.3 g/cm. By comparison, the Moon, which is rocky, has a density of 3.3 g/cm, whereas Pluto, which is typical of icy objects in the Kuiper belt, has a density of 1.86 g/cm. Haumea's possible high density covered the values for silicate minerals such as olivine and pyroxene, which make up many of the rocky objects in the Solar System. This also suggested that the bulk of Haumea was rock covered with a relatively thin layer of ice. A thick ice mantle more typical of Kuiper belt objects may have been blasted off during the impact that formed the Haumean collisional family.\nBecause Haumea has moons, the mass of the system can be calculated from their orbits using Kepler's third law. The result is , 28% the mass of the Plutonian system and 6% that of the Moon. Nearly all of this mass is in Haumea.\nSeveral ellipsoid-model calculations of Haumea's dimensions have been made. The first model produced after Haumea's discovery was calculated from ground-based observations of Haumea's light curve at optical wavelengths: it provided a total length of 1,960 to 2,500 km and a visual albedo (p) greater than 0.6. The most likely shape is a triaxial ellipsoid with approximate dimensions of 2,000 × 1,500 × 1,000 km, with an albedo of 0.71. Observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope give a diameter of and an albedo of , from photometry at infrared wavelengths of 70 μm. Subsequent light-curve analyses have suggested an equivalent circular diameter of 1,450 km. In 2010 an analysis of measurements taken by Herschel Space Telescope together with the older Spitzer Telescope measurements yielded a new estimate of the equivalent diameter of Haumea—about 1300 km. These independent size estimates overlap at an average geometric mean diameter of roughly 1,400 km. In 2013 the Herschel Space Telescope measured Haumea's equivalent circular diameter to be roughly .\nHowever the observations of a stellar occultation in January 2017 cast a doubt on all those conclusions. The measured shape of Haumea, while elongated as presumed before, appeared to have significantly larger dimensions according to the data obtained from the occultation Haumea is approximately the diameter of Pluto along its longest axis and about half that at its poles. The resulting density calculated from the observed shape of Haumea was about more in line with densities of other large TNOs. This resulting shape appeared to be inconsistent with a homogenous body in hydrostatic equilibrium, though Haumea appears to be one of the largest trans-Neptunian objects discovered nonetheless, smaller than , , similar to , and possibly , and larger than , , and .\n\nA 2019 study attempted to resolve the conflicting measurements of Haumea's shape and density using numerical modeling of Haumea as a differentiated body. It found that dimensions of ≈ 2,100 × 1,680 × 1,074 km (modeling the long axis at intervals of 25 km) were a best-fit match to the observed shape of Haumea during the 2017 occultation, while also being consistent with both surface and core scalene ellipsoid shapes in hydrostatic equilibrium. The revised solution for Haumea's shape implies that it has a core of approximately 1,626 × 1,446 × 940 km, with a relatively high density of ≈ , indicative of a composition largely of hydrated silicates such as kaolinite. The core is surrounded by an icy mantle that ranges in thickness from about 70 at the poles to 170 km along its longest axis, comprising up to 17% of Haumea's mass. Haumea's mean density is estimated at ≈ , with an albedo of ≈ 0.66.\n\nIn 2005, the Gemini and Keck telescopes obtained spectra of Haumea which showed strong crystalline water ice features similar to the surface of Pluto's moon Charon. This is peculiar, because crystalline ice forms at temperatures above 110 K, whereas Haumea's surface temperature is below 50 K, a temperature at which amorphous ice is formed. In addition, the structure of crystalline ice is unstable under the constant rain of cosmic rays and energetic particles from the Sun that strike trans-Neptunian objects. The timescale for the crystalline ice to revert to amorphous ice under this bombardment is on the order of ten million years, yet trans-Neptunian objects have been in their present cold-temperature locations for timescales of billions of years. Radiation damage should also redden and darken the surface of trans-Neptunian objects where the common surface materials of organic ices and tholin-like compounds are present, as is the case with Pluto. Therefore, the spectra and colour suggest Haumea and its family members have undergone recent resurfacing that produced fresh ice. However, no plausible resurfacing mechanism has been suggested.\n\nHaumea is as bright as snow, with an albedo in the range of 0.6–0.8, consistent with crystalline ice. Other large TNOs such as appear to have albedos as high or higher. Best-fit modeling of the surface spectra suggested that 66% to 80% of the Haumean surface appears to be pure crystalline water ice, with one contributor to the high albedo possibly hydrogen cyanide or phyllosilicate clays. Inorganic cyanide salts such as copper potassium cyanide may also be present.\n\nHowever, further studies of the visible and near infrared spectra suggest a homogeneous surface covered by an intimate 1:1 mixture of amorphous and crystalline ice, together with no more than 8% organics. The absence of ammonia hydrate excludes cryovolcanism and the observations confirm that the collisional event must have happened more than 100 million years ago, in agreement with the dynamic studies.\nThe absence of measurable methane in the spectra of Haumea is consistent with a warm collisional history that would have removed such volatiles, in contrast to .\n\nIn addition to the large fluctuations in Haumea's light curve due to the body's shape, which affect all colours equally, smaller independent colour variations seen in both visible and near-infrared wavelengths show a region on the surface that differs both in colour and in albedo. More specifically, a large dark red area on Haumea's bright white surface was seen in September 2009, possibly an impact feature, which indicates an area rich in minerals and organic (carbon-rich) compounds, or possibly a higher proportion of crystalline ice. Thus Haumea may have a mottled surface reminiscent of Pluto, if not as extreme.\n\nA stellar occultation observed on 21 January 2017 and described in an 11 October 2017 \"Nature\" article indicated the presence of a ring around Haumea. This represents the first ring system discovered for a TNO. The ring has a radius of about 2,287 km, a width of ~70 km and an opacity of 0.5. It is well within Haumea's Roche limit, which would be at a radius of about 4,400 km if it were spherical (being nonspherical pushes the limit out farther). The ring plane approximately coincides with Haumea's equatorial plane and the orbital plane of its larger, outer moon Hiʻiaka. The ring is also close to the 3:1 resonance with Haumea's rotation (which is at a radius of 2,285 ± 8 km). The ring is estimated to contribute 5% to the total brightness of Haumea.\n\nIn a study about the dynamics of ring particles published in 2019, Othon Cabo Winter and colleagues have shown that the 1:3 resonance with Haumea's rotation is dynamically unstable, but that there is a stable region in the phase space consistent with the location of Haumea's ring. This indicates that the ring particles originate on circular, periodic orbits that are close to, but not inside, the resonance.\n\nTwo small satellites have been discovered orbiting Haumea, (136108) Haumea I Hiʻiaka and (136108) Haumea II Namaka. Darin Ragozzine and Michael Brown discovered both in 2005, through observations of Haumea using the W.M. Keck Observatory.\n\nHiʻiaka, at first nicknamed \"Rudolph\" by the Caltech team, was discovered January 26, 2005. It is the outer and, at roughly 310 km in diameter, the larger and brighter of the two, and orbits Haumea in a nearly circular path every 49 days. Strong absorption features at 1.5 and 2 micrometres in the infrared spectrum are consistent with nearly pure crystalline water ice covering much of the surface. The unusual spectrum, along with similar absorption lines on Haumea, led Brown and colleagues to conclude that capture was an unlikely model for the system's formation, and that the Haumean moons must be fragments of Haumea itself.\n\nNamaka, the smaller, inner satellite of Haumea, was discovered on June 30, 2005, and nicknamed \"Blitzen\". It is a tenth the mass of Hiiaka, orbits Haumea in 18 days in a highly elliptical, non-Keplerian orbit, and is inclined 13° from the larger moon, which perturbs its orbit.\nThe relatively large eccentricities together with the mutual inclination of the orbits of the satellites are unexpected as they should have been damped by the tidal effects. A relatively recent passage by a 3:1 resonance with Hiʻiaka might explain the current excited orbits of the Haumean moons.\n\nAt present, the orbits of the Haumean moons appear almost exactly edge-on from Earth, with Namaka periodically occulting Haumea. Observation of such transits would provide precise information on the size and shape of Haumea and its moons, as happened in the late 1980s with Pluto and Charon. The tiny change in brightness of the system during these occultations will require at least a medium-aperture professional telescope for detection. Hiʻiaka last occulted Haumea in 1999, a few years before discovery, and will not do so again for some 130 years. However, in a situation unique among regular satellites, Namaka's orbit is being greatly torqued by Hiʻiaka, which preserved the viewing angle of Namaka–Haumea transits for several more years.\n\nHaumea is the largest member of its collisional family, a group of astronomical objects with similar physical and orbital characteristics thought to have formed when a larger progenitor was shattered by an impact. This family is the first to be identified among TNOs and includes—beside Haumea and its moons— (≈364 km), (≈174 km), (≈200 km), (≈230 km), and (≈252 km). Brown and colleagues proposed that the family were a direct product of the impact that removed Haumea's ice mantle, but a second proposal suggests a more complicated origin: that the material ejected in the initial collision instead coalesced into a large moon of Haumea, which was later shattered in a second collision, dispersing its shards outwards. This second scenario appears to produce a dispersion of velocities for the fragments that is more closely matched to the measured velocity dispersion of the family members.\n\nThe presence of the collisional family could imply that Haumea and its \"offspring\" might have originated in the scattered disc. In today's sparsely populated Kuiper belt, the chance of such a collision occurring over the age of the Solar System is less than 0.1 percent. The family could not have formed in the denser primordial Kuiper belt because such a close-knit group would have been disrupted by Neptune's migration into the belt—the believed cause of the belt's current low density. Therefore, it appears likely that the dynamic scattered disc region, in which the possibility of such a collision is far higher, is the place of origin for the object that generated Haumea and its kin.\nBecause it would have taken at least a billion years for the group to have diffused as far as it has, the collision which created the Haumea family is believed to have occurred very early in the Solar System's history.\n\nJoel Poncy and colleagues calculated that a flyby mission to Haumea could take 14.25 years using a gravity assist at Jupiter, based on a launch date of 25 September 2025. Haumea would be 48.18 AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives. A flight time of 16.45 years can be achieved with launch dates on 1 November 2026, 23 September 2037 and 29 October 2038.\nHaumea could become a target for an exploration mission, and an example of this work is a preliminary study on a probe to Haumea and its moons (at 35–51 AU). Probe mass, power source, and propulsion systems are key technology areas for this type of mission.\n\n\n"}

They are shown shopping and gossiping in a series of luxurious locales such as: London, the Hamptons, Hilfiger's family estates in Nantucket and tropical British West Indies, as well as Los Angeles. However, their home base and the setting for much of the action was New York City.\n\nAlly and Jaime were the show's eponymous \"rich girls\" because Hilfiger's father is Tommy Hilfiger, the multi-millionaire owner of the same named fashion label and Gleicher's late father, Leo, was the founder of \"Innovation Luggage\", a company with a net worth of $10 million.\n\nNotable cameos that occurred during the program included \"American Idol\" judge Randy Jackson who ran into the girls at a Los Angeles eatery, former President of the United States Bill Clinton who attended a special screening of the World War II film \"Proud\" (a project Hilfiger produced) held aboard the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum, and Ally's famous dad, who invited his daughter to his workplace to critique his sportswear line.\n\nA total of ten episodes were produced during the season, and included one that featured the Northeast blackout of 2003, which had a direct impact on the series, as the production was taping in New York at the time of the event.\n\nAs the show filmed, Hilfiger and Gleicher began to argue with each other, and living on camera apparently had a negative effect on both girls. After the season ended, Ally continued using marijuana for her illness many months before being placed in rehab by her parents where she was eventually properly diagnosed with Lyme disease. Gleicher was seen attending Barnard College of Columbia University as a freshman in the series' final episode, however during the airing of the series she began treatment at Silver Hill Hospital for depression and an eating disorder.\n\nThe two friends' off-screen animosity (they each served as co-producers of the series) caused them to split and they went their separate ways.\n\nThe program's theme song was \"This Town\", an edited cover version of a track from The Go-Go's 1981 debut album \"Beauty and the Beat\" and performed by the all-female Canadian pop/rock group Lillix.\n"}

It was a hit single in 1967 for the American girl group The Marvelettes for the Motown label, from their self-titled album released that same year. In 1980, Jamaican singer Grace Jones remade the song and had minor success with her version in the US. The song has had several cover versions over the years. Blondie included a cover as the closing track on their 1982 conceptual album \"The Hunter\". Massive Attack and Tracey Thorn (of Everything but the Girl) recorded a cover for the soundtrack to Batman Forever in 1995. Most recently, Bette Midler performed a rendition included in the deluxe edition of her 2014 studio album \"It's The Girls!\". Another cover also appeared on Jerry Garcia Compliments in 1974 and was performed live by the Jerry Garcia Band until into the early 90s.\n\nThe Marvelettes single peaked in the United States in spring 1967 at number 13 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 pop singles chart and at number two on the \"Billboard\" soul chart. The group's version of the song was produced by Smokey Robinson. The song is written in the first person, from the point of view of someone who has \"laid such a tender trap\" to catch a lover. Lead singer Wanda Young-Rogers (wife of Miracles member Bobby Rogers) talks about how she had been stalking her lover, having to learn his \"ways and habits\" so she could plan how to catch him. But \"certain things rearrange\" and she finds herself caught, presumably, in love with her 'game.'\n\nThere seems to be 3 variations issued. The original mono single ended cold, yet some (not all) of the stereo remixes fade at the end. There is also a different last verse on some of the reissues, leading to the assumption that Smokey recorded the song much longer than any of the issued versions. Additionally, the single version and at least one of the stereo mixes exclude the first part of the second verse.\n\n\"Billboard\" named the song #71 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.\n\n\nJamaican singer Grace Jones covered \"The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game\" on \"Warm Leatherette\" in 1980, her first post-disco album. It was also released as the lead single in the USA and the fourth in the UK. The B-side on the European single is an alternate version of the song, known as the \"Special Single Version\". This version was not released on CD until 2016 when \"Warm Leatherette\" was reissued.\n\n\n\n"}

ABA Games' works, available as open source, are predominantly shoot 'em up games often inspired by classic games in the genre. Its games feature stylised retro graphics, innovative gameplay features and modes and feature random rather than scripted events. These creations have been acclaimed as some of the best and well-known independent games available, though some commentators, including Cho himself, feel they are too simple for commercial release.\n\nCho began creating computer games as a hobby during his childhood in the 1980s. After leaving university, he pursued a career with Toshiba in multimedia research and development while continuing to develop games in his spare time. The positive reaction to ABA Games' first shoot 'em up, \"Noiz2sa\" (2002), encouraged him to concentrate on that genre. The developer's games have been ported from the original Windows versions to macOS and Linux, and various handheld devices. One of its games, \"Tumiki Fighters\", was remade, built upon and released for the Wii console as \"Blast Works\". According to Cho, he occasionally receives interest in further console ports. In addition to \"Tumiki Fighters\", acclaimed ABA Games titles include \"Gunroar\", \"rRootage\" and \"Torus Trooper\".\n\nABA Games' sole developer, Kenta Cho, began writing games as a child during the 1980s using the NEC PC-6001 microcomputer, as there were few commercially available games. After leaving university, Cho contemplated professional games development but ultimately instead joined Toshiba to work in multimedia research and development. He continues to work full-time for Toshiba while running ABA Games as a hobby, working mainly on weekends. Cho is the sole contributor to ABA Games. Lacking musical training, he creates the soundtracks to his games using commercially available, pre-made samples. ABA Games releases a game approximately every six months, with the first three months spent creating prototypes and the latter three spent refining a finished version.\n\nABA Games released its first shoot 'em up game for Windows PCs—\"Noiz2sa\"—in 2002, and the positive feedback Cho received encouraged him to concentrate on the genre. ABA Games' creations are \"avant-garde\" re-imaginings of classic arcade shoot 'em ups, using modern 3D graphics techniques to emulate older vector graphics and employing \"imaginative, fresh\" gameplay ideas. According to Cho, his graphical style was inspired by the game \"Rez\" as well as street billboards, and his attempts at innovative gameplay features have been inspired by games such as \"Radiant Silvergun\", \"Ikaruga\" and \"Gradius V\". ABA Games' works also tend to be set in random rather than scripted events. Its games are developed for Windows, but some have been ported to other systems including macOS, iPhone, iPod touch, and PSP, with its game \"Tumiki Fighters\" forming the basis of Wii game \"Blast Works\" (which included a selection of his games as bonus content). Cho has also created BulletML, an open source program which can replicate bullet patterns from other shoot 'em up games.\n\nCho has stated he occasionally receives interest in ports for game consoles, but although he would otherwise be interested in such ports, he feels his games are too simple for commercial release. He has also stated his use of the D programming language proved problematic when porting \"Tumiki Fighters\" to the Wii. ABA Games' works are open source and free to download; Cho has stated he creates games of the kind which he desires to play and distributes them (along with the source code) for the enjoyment of others without the intent of monetary profit. \"Macworld\" acclaimed Cho as \"spectacularly talented\" and \"one of today’s best independent game programmers\", while \"GamesRadar\" noted him for \"creating some of the best freeware shoot ‘em ups out there\". Ashcraft states that in the West, Cho is \"hailed as the most famous 'doujin software' shmup maker\", while \"The Guardian\" claimed Cho's works are among \"the best-known examples\" of Japan's independent gaming scene. While out with Japan ABA Games is known as a \"doujin\" developer, unlike doujin developers Cho does not seek to sell his works, nor are they fan-created games; however, Cho is affable to the term being applied to his work. Jonathan Mak, creator of award-winning game \"Everyday Shooter\" (published by Sony on PlayStation Network) has cited ABA Games' \"Parsec 47\" as the inspiration behind his game's aesthetic.\n\n\n\n\nAs Kenta Cho usually releases the source code of his games under a BSD-like permissive license, his games are often ported by volunteers to other systems. For example, Tumiki Fighters written in D and released in 2004, was included in the Linux distribution Debian and also ported to Pandora handheld.\n\n"}

It is a mix of sliced potatoes, sliced onions, cubed mutton, beef, and pork which have been marinated overnight in Alsatian white wine and juniper berries and slow-cooked in a bread-dough sealed ceramic casserole dish. Leeks, thyme, parsley, garlic, carrots and marjoram are other commonly added ingredients for flavor and color.\n\nAlsatian people often eat this dish for a special occasion, such as Christmas.\n\nThe Baekeoffe is a dish inspired from the Hamin , an Hebraic traditional dish of Shabbat. Because of the spiritual prohibition of using the fire from Friday night to Saturday night, the Jews had to prepare food for Saturday on Friday afternoon, and then would give the dish to the baker, who would keep it warm in his oven until Saturday noon.\n\nTraditionally, the women would prepare this dish on Saturday evening and leave it with the baker to cook in his gradually cooling oven on Sunday while they attended the lengthy Lutheran church services once typical to the culture. The baker would take a \"rope\" of dough and line the rim of a large, heavy ceramic casserole, then place the lid upon it for an extremely tight seal. This kept the moisture in the container. On the way back from church, the women would pick up their casserole and a loaf of bread. This provided a meal to the Alsatians that respected the strict Lutheran rules of the Sabbath. Part of the ritual is breaking the crust formed by the rope of dough.\n\nAnother version of the story of the origin of this dish is that women in France would do laundry on Mondays and thus not have time to cook. They would drop the pots off at the baker on Monday morning and do the laundry. When the children returned home from school they would then pick up the pot at the baker and carry it home with them. This version of the story may be closer to reality as bakers were often closed on Sundays.\n\n"}
{"id": "2333752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333752", "title": "History of Unix", "text": "History of Unix\n\nThe history of Unix dates back to the mid-1960s when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AT&T Bell Labs, and General Electric were jointly developing an experimental time sharing operating system called Multics for the GE-645 mainframe.\nMultics introduced many innovations, but had many problems.\n\nBell Labs, frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not the aims, slowly pulled out of the project. Their last researchers to leave Multics, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Doug McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna among others, decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale. In 1979, Dennis Ritchie described their vision for Unix:\n\nIn the late 1960s, Bell Labs was involved in a project with MIT and General Electric to develop a time-sharing system, called Multiplexed Information and Computing Service (Multics), allowing multiple users to access a mainframe simultaneously. Dissatisfied with the project's progress, Bell Labs management ultimately withdrew.\n\nKen Thompson, a programmer in the Labs' computing research department, had worked on Multics. He decided to write his own operating system. While he still had access to the Multics environment, he wrote simulations for the new file and paging system on it. He also programmed a game called \"Space Travel\", but it needed a more efficient and less expensive machine to run on, and eventually he found a little-used Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-7 at Bell Labs. On the PDP-7, in 1969, a team of Bell Labs researchers led by Thompson and Ritchie, including Rudd Canaday, implemented a hierarchical file system, the concepts of computer processes and device files, a command-line interpreter, and some small utility programs, modeled on the corresponding features in Multics, but simplified. The resulting system, much smaller and simpler than Multics, was to become Unix. In about a month's time, in August 1969, Thompson had implemented a self-hosting operating system with an assembler, editor and shell, using a GECOS machine for bootstrapping.\n\nDouglas McIlroy then ported TMG compiler-compiler to PDP-7 assembly, creating the first high-level language running on Unix. Thompson used this tool to develop the first version of his B programming language.\n\nThe new operating system was initially without organizational backing, and also without a name. At this stage, the new operating system was a singletasking operating system, not a multitasking one such as Multics. The name \"Unics\" (Uniplexed Information and Computing Service, pronounced as \"eunuchs\"), a pun on \"Multics\" (Multiplexed Information and Computer Services), was initially suggested for the project in 1970. Brian Kernighan claims the coining for himself, and adds that \"no one can remember\" who came up with the final spelling Unix. Dennis Ritchie and Doug McIlroy also credit Kernighan.\n\nWhen the Computing Sciences Research Center wanted to use Unix on a machine larger than the PDP-7, while another department needed a word processor, Thompson and Ritchie added text processing capabilities to Unix and received funding for a PDP-11/20. For the first time in 1970, the Unix operating system was officially named and ran on the PDP-11/20. A text formatting program called roff and a text editor were added. All three were written in PDP-11/20 assembly language. Bell Labs used this initial text processing system, consisting of Unix, roff, and the editor, for text processing of patent applications. Roff soon evolved into troff, the first electronic publishing program with full typesetting capability.\n\nAs the system grew in complexity and the research team wanted more users, the need for a manual grew apparent. The \"UNIX Programmer's Manual\" was published on 3 November 1971; commands were documented in the \"man page\" format that is still used, offering terse reference information about usage as well as bugs in the software, and listing the authors of programs to channel questions to them.\n\nAfter other Bell Labs departments purchased DEC PDP-11s, they also chose to run Unix instead of DEC's own operating system. By Version 4 it was widely used within the laboratory and a Unix Support Group was formed, helping the operating system survive by formalizing its distribution.\n\nIn 1973, Version 4 Unix was rewritten in the higher-level language C, contrary to the general notion at the time that an operating system's complexity and sophistication required it to be written in assembly language. The C language appeared as part of Version 2. Thompson and Ritchie were so influential on early Unix that McIlroy estimated that they wrote and debugged about 100,000 lines of code that year, stating that \"[their names] may safely be assumed to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed\". Although assembly did not disappear from the man pages until Version 8, the migration to C suggested portability of the software, requiring only a relatively small amount of machine-dependent code to be replaced when porting Unix to other computing platforms. Version 4 Unix, however, still had many PDP-11 dependent codes, and is not suitable for porting. The first port to other platform was made five years later (1978) for Interdata 8/32.\n\nThe Unix operating system was first presented formally to the outside world at the 1973 Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, where Ritchie and Thompson delivered a paper. This led to requests for the system, but under a 1956 consent decree in settlement of an antitrust case, the Bell System (the parent organization of Bell Labs) was forbidden from entering any business other than \"common carrier communications services\", and was required to license any patents it had upon request. Unix could not, therefore, be turned into a product. Bell Labs instead shipped the system for the cost of media and shipping. Ken Thompson quietly began answering requests by shipping out tapes and disks, each accompanied by according to legend a note signed, \"Love, Ken”.\n\nIn 1973, AT&T released Version 5 Unix and licensed it to educational institutions, and licensed 1975's Version 6 to companies for the first time. While commercial users were rare because of the cost, the latter was the most widely used version into the early 1980s. Anyone could purchase a license, but the terms were very restrictive; licensees only received the source code, on an as is basis. The licenses also included the machine-dependent parts of the kernel, written in PDP-11 assembly language. Copies of the \"Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition, with Source Code\" circulated widely, which led to considerable use of Unix as an educational example. The first meeting of Unix users took place in New York in 1974, attracting a few dozen people; this would later grow into the USENIX organization. The importance of the user group stemmed from the fact that Unix was entirely unsupported by AT&T.\n\nVersions of the Unix system were determined by editions of its user manuals; for example, \"Fifth Edition UNIX\" and \"UNIX Version 5\" have both been used to designate the same version. The Bell Labs developers did not think in terms of \"releases\" of the operating system, instead using a model of continuous development, and sometimes distributing tapes with patches (without AT&T lawyers' approval). Development expanded, adding the concept of pipes, which led to the development of a more modular code base, and quicker development cycles. Version 5, and especially Version 6, led to a plethora of different Unix versions both inside and outside Bell Labs, including PWB/UNIX and the first commercial Unix, IS/1.\n\nUnix still only ran on DEC systems. As more of the operating system was rewritten in C (and the C language extended to accommodate this), portability also increased; in 1977, Bell Labs procured an Interdata 8/32 with the aim of porting Unix to a computer that was as different from the PDP-11 as possible, making the operating system more machine-independent in the process. Unix next ran as a guest operating system inside a VM/370 hypervisor at Princeton. Simultaneously, a group at the University of Wollongong ported Unix to the similar Interdata 7/32. Target machines of further Bell Labs ports for research and AT&T-internal use included an Intel 8086-based computer (with custom-built MMU) and the UNIVAC 1100.\n\nIn May 1975, ARPA documented the benefits of the Unix time-sharing system which \"presents several interesting capabilities\" as an ARPA network mini-host in RFC 681.\n\nIn 1978, UNIX/32V was released for DEC's then new VAX system. By this time, over 600 machines were running Unix in some form. Version 7 Unix, the last version of Research Unix to be released widely, was released in 1979. In Version 7, the number of system calls was only around 50, although later Unix and Unix-like systems would add many more:\n\nA microprocessor port of Unix, to the LSI-11, was completed in 1978, and an Intel 8086 version was reported to be \"in progress\" the same year. The first microcomputer versions of Unix, and Unix-like operating systems like Whitesmiths' Idris, appeared in the late 1970s.\n\nBell developed multiple versions of Unix for internal use, such as CB UNIX (with improved support for databases) and PWB/UNIX, the \"Programmer's Workbench\", aimed at large groups of programmers. It advertised the latter version, as well as 32V and V7, stating that \"more than 800 systems are already in use outside the Bell System\" in 1980, and \"more than 2000\" the following year. Research Unix versions 8, 9, and 10 were developed through the 1980s but were only released to a few universities, though they did generate papers describing the new work. This research focus then shifted to the development of Plan 9 from Bell Labs, a new portable distributed system.\n\nBecause the company widely and inexpensively licensed Unix, by the early 1980s thousands of people used Unix at AT&T and elsewhere, and as computer science students moved from universities into companies they wanted to continue to use it. Observers began to see Unix as a potential universal operating system, suitable for all computers. Less than 20,000 lines of code almost all in C composed the Unix kernel as of 1983, and more than 75% was not machine-dependent. By that year Unix or a Unix-like system was available for at least 16 different processors and architectures from about 60 vendors; \"BYTE\" noted that computer companies \"may support other [operating] systems, but a Unix implementation always happens to be available\", and that DEC and IBM supported Unix as an alternative to their proprietary operating systems.\n\nMicrocomputer Unix became commercially available in 1980, when Onyx Systems released its Zilog Z8000-based C8002 and Microsoft announced its first Unix for 16-bit microcomputers called Xenix, which the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) ported to the 8086 processor in 1983. Other companies began to offer commercial versions of Unix for their own minicomputers and workstations. Many of these new Unix flavors were developed from the System V base under a license from AT&T; others were based on BSD. One of the leading developers of BSD, Bill Joy, went on to co-found Sun Microsystems in 1982 and created SunOS for its workstations.\n\nAT&T announced UNIX System III based on Version 7, and PWB in 1981. Licensees could sell binary sublicenses for as little as , which observers believed indicated that AT&T now viewed Unix as a commercial product. This also included support for the VAX. AT&T continued to issue licenses for older Unix versions. To end the confusion between all its differing internal versions, AT&T combined them into UNIX System V Release 1. This introduced a few features such as the vi editor and curses from the Berkeley Software Distribution of Unix developed at the University of California, Berkeley Computer Systems Research Group. This also included support for the Western Electric 3B series computers. AT&T provided support for System III and System V through the Unix Support Group (USG), and these systems were sometimes referred to as USG Unix.\n\nIn 1983, the U.S. Department of Justice settled its second antitrust case against AT&T, causing the breakup of the Bell System. This relieved AT&T of the 1956 consent decree that had prevented the company from commercializing Unix. AT&T promptly introduced Unix System V into the market. The newly created competition nearly crippled the long-term viability of Unix, because it stifled the free exchanging of source code and led to fragmentation and incompatibility. The GNU Project was founded in the same year by Richard Stallman.\n\nSince the newer commercial UNIX licensing terms were not as favorable for academic use as the older versions of Unix, the Berkeley researchers continued to develop BSD as an alternative to UNIX System III and V. Many contributions to Unix first appeared in BSD releases, notably the C shell with job control (modelled on ITS). Perhaps the most important aspect of the BSD development effort was the addition of TCP/IP network code to the mainstream Unix kernel. The BSD effort produced several significant releases that contained network code: 4.1cBSD, 4.2BSD, 4.3BSD, 4.3BSD-Tahoe (\"Tahoe\" being the nickname of the Computer Consoles Inc. Power 6/32 architecture that was the first non-DEC release of the BSD kernel), Net/1, 4.3BSD-Reno (to match the \"Tahoe\" naming, and that the release was something of a gamble), Net/2, 4.4BSD, and 4.4BSD-lite. The network code found in these releases is the ancestor of much TCP/IP network code in use today, including code that was later released in AT&T System V UNIX and early versions of Microsoft Windows. The accompanying Berkeley sockets API is a de facto standard for networking APIs and has been copied on many platforms.\n\nDuring this period, many observers expected that UNIX, with its portability, rich capabilities, and support from companies like DEC and IBM, was likely to become an industry-standard operating system for microcomputers. Citing its much smaller software library and installed base than that of MS-DOS and the IBM PC, others expected that customers would prefer personal computers on local area networks to Unix multiuser systems. Microsoft planned to make Xenix MS-DOS's multiuser successor; by 1983 a Xenix-based Altos 586 with 512 KB RAM and 10 MB hard drive cost . \"BYTE\" reported that the Altos \"under moderate load approaches DEC VAX performance for most tasks that a user would normally invoke\", while other computers from Sun and MASSCOMP were much more expensive but equaled the VAX. The magazine added that both PC/IX and Venix on the IBM PC outperformed Venix on the PDP-11/23. uNETix, a commercial microcomputer Unix, implemented the first Unix color windowing system.\n\nIn 1986, \"Computerworld\" wrote that \"Until very recently, almost no one associated Unix with corporate data processing. [...] the operating system traveled almost exclusively in academic and technical circles ... But now — almost entirely because of strenuous efforts by AT&T — some people are beginning to perceive Unix as a viable option for large commercial installations.\" Unix became commercially available for the mainframe via Amdahl UTS in 1981, and now IBM started offering Unix as IX/370 and VM/IX. The total installed base of Unix, however, remained small at some 230,000 machines.\n\nDespite its academic reputation \"InfoWorld\" stated in 1989, \"Until recently, Unix conjured up visions of long-haired bearded technoids stuck in the bowels of an R&D lab, coding software until the wee hours of the morning\" the increasing power of microcomputers in the late 1980s, and in particular the introduction of the 32-bit Intel 80386, caused Unix to \"explode\" in popularity for business applications; Xenix, 386/ix, and other Unix systems for the PC-compatible market competed with OS/2 in terms of networking, multiuser support, multitasking, and MS-DOS compatibility. The beginning in 1984 of the annual Unix Expo trade show in New York reflected the growing commercial presence of Unix.\n\nDuring this time a number of vendors including Digital Equipment, Sun, Addamax and others began building trusted versions of UNIX for high security applications, mostly designed for military and law enforcement applications.\n\nA problem that plagued Unix in this period was the multitude of implementations, based on either System V, BSD, or what Poul-Henning Kamp later described as a \"more or less competently executed\" combination of the two, usually with home-grown extensions to the base systems from AT&T or Berkeley. Xenix was effectively a third lineage, being based on the earlier System III. The rivalry between vendors was called the Unix wars; customers soon demanded standardization.\n\nAT&T responded by issuing a standard, the System V Interface Definition (SVID, 1985), and required conformance for operating systems to be branded \"System V\".\nIn 1984, several European computer vendors established the X/Open consortium with the goal of creating an open system specification based on Unix (and eventually the SVID).\nYet another standardization effort was the IEEE's POSIX specification (1988), designed as a compromise API readily implemented on both BSD and System V platforms. POSIX was soon mandated by the United States government for many of its own systems.\n\nIn the spring of 1988, AT&T took the standardization a step further. First, it collaborated with SCO to merge System V and Xenix into System V/386. Next, it sought collaboration with Sun Microsystems (vendor of the 4.2BSD derivative SunOS and its Network File System) to merge System V, BSD/SunOS and Xenix into a single unified Unix, which would become System V Release 4. AT&T and Sun, as UNIX International, acted independently of X/Open and drew ire from other vendors, which started the Open Software Foundation to work on their own unified Unix, OSF/1, ushering in a new phase of the Unix wars.\n\nThe Unix wars continued into the 1990s, but turned out to be less serious of a threat than it originally looked: AT&T and Sun went their own ways after System V.4, while OSF/1's schedule slipped behind. \nBy 1993, most commercial vendors changed their variants of Unix to be based on System V with many BSD features added. The creation of the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative that year, by the major players in Unix, marked the end of the most notorious phase of the Unix wars, and was followed by the merger of UI and OSF in 1994. The new combined entity retained the OSF name and stopped work on OSF/1. By that time the only vendor using it was Digital Equipment Corporation, which continued its own development, rebranding their product Digital UNIX in early 1995.\nPOSIX became the unifying standard for Unix systems (and some other operating systems).\n\nMeanwhile, the BSD world saw its own developments. The group at Berkeley moved its operating system toward POSIX compliance and released a stripped-down version of its networking code, supposedly without any code that was the property of AT&T. In 1991, a group of BSD developers (Donn Seeley, Mike Karels, Bill Jolitz, and Trent Hein) left the University of California to found Berkeley Software Design, Inc. (BSDi), which sold a fully functional commercial version of BSD Unix for the Intel platform, which they advertised as free of AT&T code. They ran into legal trouble when AT&T's Unix subsidiary sued BSDi for copyright infringement and various other charges in relation to BSD; subsequently, the University of California countersued.\nShortly after it was founded, Bill Jolitz left BSDI to pursue distribution of 386BSD, the free software ancestor of FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD.\n\nShortly after UNIX System V Release 4 was produced, AT&T sold all its rights to UNIX to Novell. Dennis Ritchie likened this sale to the Biblical story of Esau selling his birthright for the mess of pottage. Novell developed its own version, UnixWare, merging its NetWare with UNIX System V Release 4. Novell tried to use this as a marketing tool against Windows NT, but their core markets suffered considerably. It also quickly settled the court battles with BSDi and Berkeley.\n\nIn 1993, Novell decided to transfer the UNIX trademark and certification rights to the X/Open Consortium. In 1996, X/Open merged with OSF, creating the Open Group. Various standards by the Open Group now define what is and what is not a UNIX operating system, notably the post-1998 Single UNIX Specification.\n\nIn 1995, the business of administering and supporting the existing UNIX licenses, plus rights to further develop the System V code base, were sold by Novell to the Santa Cruz Operation. Whether Novell also sold the copyrights would later become the subject of litigation (see below).\n\nWith the legal troubles between AT&T/Novell and the University of California over, the latter did two more releases of BSD before disbanding its Computer Systems Research Group in 1995. The BSD code lived on, however, in its free derivatives and in what Garfinkel \"et al.\" call a second generation of commercial Unix systems, based on BSD. The first exponent of these was BSDi's offering, popular at internet service providers but eventually not successful enough to sustain the company. The other main exponent would be Apple Computer.\n\nIn 1997, Apple sought a new foundation for its Macintosh operating system and chose NeXTSTEP, an operating system developed by NeXT. The core operating system, which was based on BSD and the Mach kernel, was renamed Darwin after Apple acquired it. The deployment of Darwin in Mac OS X makes it, according to a statement made by an Apple employee at a USENIX conference, the most widely used Unix-based system in the desktop computer market.\n\nMeanwhile, Unix got competition from the copyleft Linux kernel, a reimplementation of Unix from scratch, using parts of the GNU project that had been underway since the mid-1980s. Work on Linux began in 1991 by Linus Torvalds; in 1998, a confidential memo at Microsoft stated, \"Linux is on track to eventually own the x86 UNIX market,\" and further predicted, \"I believe that Linux – moreso than NT – will be the biggest threat to SCO in the near future.\"\n\nIn 2000, SCO sold its entire UNIX business and assets to Caldera Systems, which later changed its name to The SCO Group.\n\nThe bursting of the dot-com bubble (2001–03) led to significant consolidation of versions of Unix. Of the many commercial variants of Unix that were born in the 1980s, only Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX were still doing relatively well in the market, though SGI's IRIX persisted for quite some time. Of these, Solaris had the largest market share in 2005.\n\nIn 2003, the SCO Group started legal action against various users and vendors of Linux. SCO had alleged that Linux contained copyrighted Unix code now owned by the SCO Group. Other allegations included trade-secret violations by IBM, or contract violations by former Santa Cruz customers who had since converted to Linux. However, Novell disputed the SCO Group's claim to hold copyright on the UNIX source base. According to Novell, SCO (and hence the SCO Group) are effectively franchise operators for Novell, which also retained the core copyrights, veto rights over future licensing activities of SCO, and 95% of the licensing revenue. The SCO Group disagreed with this, and the dispute resulted in the \"SCO v. Novell\" lawsuit. On 10 August 2007, a major portion of the case was decided in Novell's favor (that Novell had the copyright to UNIX, and that the SCO Group had improperly kept money that was due to Novell). The court also ruled that \"SCO is obligated to recognize Novell's waiver of SCO's claims against IBM and Sequent\". After the ruling, Novell announced they have no interest in suing people over Unix and stated, \"We don't believe there is Unix in Linux\". SCO successfully got the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals to partially overturn this decision on 24 August 2009 which sent the lawsuit back to the courts for a jury trial.\n\nOn 30 March 2010, following a jury trial, Novell, and not The SCO Group, was \"unanimously [found]\" to be the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights. The SCO Group, through bankruptcy trustee Edward Cahn, decided to continue the lawsuit against IBM for causing a decline in SCO revenues. On March 1, 2016, SCO's lawsuit against IBM was dismissed with prejudice.\n\nIn 2005, Sun Microsystems released the bulk of its Solaris system code (based on UNIX System V Release 4) into an open source project called OpenSolaris. New Sun OS technologies, notably the ZFS file system, were first released as open source code via the OpenSolaris project. Soon afterwards, OpenSolaris spawned several non-Sun distributions. In 2010, after Oracle acquired Sun, OpenSolaris was officially discontinued, but the development of derivatives continued.\n\nSince the early 2000s, Linux is the leading Unix-like operating system, with other variants of Unix (apart from macOS) having only a negligible market share (see Usage share of operating systems).\n\n\n\n"}

His first cap with Italian Swimming National Team was in 1998. Raised as a breaststroker, after 2000 he dedicated totally to freestyle swimming, soon to achieving noteworthy results. Magnini gained his first international honour in 2003, with a silver medal in 100 m freestyle at the European Swimming Championships (short course) in Dublin. He won three more gold medals (in the 100 m, 4×100 m relay and 4×200 m relay freestyle) and one bronze medal at the 2004 European Championships (long course) in Madrid. At the 2004 Summer Olympics Magnini won the bronze medal in the 4×200 m freestyle relay, achieving 5th place in the 100 m freestyle. His steady rise reached its highest point at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships, where he won the gold medal in the men's 100 m freestyle with the time of 48.12, then the all-time second fastest behind Pieter van den Hoogenband's world record.\n\nAt the 2006 European Aquatics Championships he won the gold medal in the 100 m and in the 4×200 m freestyle races, and a bronze in the 200 m freestyle. The following year, he defended his world championship gold medal in the 100 m, when he tied for first place with Canadian Brent Hayden in a time of 48.43, resulting in joint gold. He also won a silver medal in the 4 × 100 m. Since then he has won silver and medals at the World Short Course Championships (silver – 100 m freestyle, 2007, 4 × 100 m freestyle, 2012, 4 × 200 m freestyle, 2014; bronze – 4 × 200 m freestyle, 2008, 4 x 50 m freestyle, 2014), and gold, silver and bronze medals at European level.\n\nMagnini's nickname is \"Superpippo\". \"Pippo\" is the normal Italian nickname of Filippo but also of Goofy's Italian version, and therefore the complete nickname refers to the funny superhero in which the comics character transforms sometimes in his Italian edition. From August 2011 has a romance with fellow swimmer Federica Pellegrini.\n\nOn 8 July 2019, it was reported that Magnini saved newlywed Andrea Benedetto from drowning off a Sardinian beach. \"The bather was in a lot of trouble: he was quite frightened, he was really stuck and had swallowed some seawater,\" Magnini said. \"When I reached him he wasn't even able to speak, and it wasn't easy to lift him on to the raft, so we laid him on an airbed that some other bathers had nearby.\"\n\nAt the 2012 Olympics Magnini failed to qualify for the finals in all the events he was competing in. After these disappointing performances he blamed the coach and the swimming team leaders for poor training management of the whole Italian team, spurring a strong media reaction for what was judged as an immature and irresponsible behavior.\n\nIn long-course swim pools Magnini's personal bests are:\n\n\n\n"}

The phrases were most often used against Republicans, who were accused of using the memory of the Civil War to their political advantage. Democrats were not above using memories of the Civil War in such a manner as well, especially while campaigning in the South.\n\nThe phrases gained popularity with a fictitious incident in which Representative, and former Union general, Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts, while making a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, allegedly held up a shirt stained with the blood of a Reconstruction Era carpetbagger who had been whipped by the Ku Klux Klan. While Butler did give a speech condemning the Klan, he never waved anyone's bloody shirt. White Southerners mocked Butler, using the fiction of him having \"\"waved the bloody shirt\"\", to dismiss Klan thuggery and other atrocities committed against freed slaves and Republicans. \n\nThe Red Shirts, a defunct 19th-century white supremacist paramilitary organization, took their name from the term. \n\nToday the terms, often abbreviated bloody shirt, are used more broadly to refer to any effort to stir up partisan animosity.\n"}
{"id": "2333759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333759", "title": "The Graphic", "text": "The Graphic\n\nThe Graphic was a British weekly illustrated newspaper, first published on 4 December 1869 by William Luson Thomas's company Illustrated Newspapers Ltd. Thomas's brother Lewis Samuel Thomas was a co-founder. The premature death of the latter in 1872 \"as one of the founders of this newspaper, [and who] took an active interest in its management\" left a marked gap in the early history of the publication. It was set up as a rival to the popular \"Illustrated London News\".\n\nThe influence of \"The Graphic\" within the art world was immense, its many admirers included Vincent van Gogh, and Hubert von Herkomer.\n\nIt continued to be published weekly under this title until 23 April 1932 and then changed title to \"The National Graphic\" between 28 April and 14 July 1932; it then ceased publication, after 3,266 issues. From 1890 until 1926, Luson Thomas's company, H. R. Baines & Co., published The Daily Graphic.\n\n\"The Graphic\" was founded by William Luson Thomas, a successful artist, wood-engraver and social reformer. Earlier he, his brother and his brother-in-law had been persuaded to go to New York and assist in launching two newspapers, \"Picture Gallery\" and \"Republic\". Thomas also had an engraving establishment of his own and, aided by a large staff, illustrated and engraved numerous standard works. Exasperated, even angered, by the unsympathetic treatment of artists by the world's most successful illustrated paper, \"The Illustrated London News\", and having a good business sense Luson Thomas resolved to set up an opposition. His illustrated paper, despite being more expensive that its competition, became an immediate success. \nWhen it began in 1869, the newspaper was printed in a rented house. By 1882, the company owned three buildings and twenty printing presses, and employed more than 1,000 people. The first editor was Henry Sutherland Edwards. A successful artist himself, the founder Thomas recruited gifted artists including Luke Fildes, Hubert von Herkomer, Frank Holl, and John Millais.\n\n\"The Graphic\" was published on a Saturday and its original cover price was sixpence, while the \"Illustrated London News\" was fivepence. In its first year, it described itself to advertisers as \"a superior illustrated weekly newspaper, containing twenty-four pages imperial folio, printed on fine toned paper of beautiful quality, made expressly for the purpose and admirably adapted for the display of engravings\".\n\nIn addition to its home market the paper had subscribers all around the British Empire and North America. \"The Graphic\" covered home news and news from around the Empire, and devoted much attention to literature, arts, sciences, the fashionable world, sport, music and opera. Royal occasions and national celebrations and ceremonials were also given prominent coverage.\n\nArtists employed on \"The Graphic\" and \"The Daily Graphic\" at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century included Helen Allingham, Edmund Blampied, Alexander Boyd, Frank Brangwyn, Randolph Caldecott, Léon Daviel, John Charles Dollman, James H. Dowd, Godefroy Durand, Luke Fildes, Harry Furniss, John Percival Gülich, George du Maurier, Phil May, George Percy Jacomb-Hood, Ernest Prater, Leonard Raven-Hill, Sidney Sime, Snaffles (Charles Johnson Payne), George Stampa, Edmund Sullivan, Bert Thomas, F. H. Townsend, Harrison Weir, and Henry Woods.\n\nWriters for the paper included George Eliot, Thomas Hardy, H. Rider Haggard and Anthony Trollope.\nMalcolm Charles Salaman was employed there from 1890 to 1899. Beatrice Grimshaw travelled the South Pacific reporting on her experiences for the \"Daily Graphic\". Mary Frances Billington served the \"Graphic\" as a special correspondent from 1890 to 1897, reporting from India in essays that were compiled into \"Woman in India\" (1895). Joseph Ashby-Sterry wrote the Bystander column for the paper for 18 years.\n\n\nThere were at least three pages dedicated to advertising, with many adverts for toothpaste, soap products and 'miracle-cure' pills.\n\n\"The Graphic\" was designed to compete with the \"Illustrated London News\" (established in 1842), and became its most successful rival. Earlier rivals such as the \"Illustrated Times\" and the \"Pictorial Times\" had either failed to compete or been merged with the \"ILN\". It appealed to the same middle-class readership, but \"The Graphic\", as its name suggests, was intended to use images in a more vivid and striking way than the rather staid \"ILN\". To this end it employed some of the most important artists of the day, making an immediate splash in 1869 with \"Houseless and Hungry\", Luke Fildes' dramatic image of the shivering London poor seeking shelter in a workhouse.\n\nIt is much more difficult to produce and print illustrations than type. Improvements in process work and machinery at the end of the 1880s allowed Luson Thomas to realise a long-cherished project, a daily illustrated paper.\n\nOn 4 January 1890, Luson Thomas's company, H. R. Baines & Co., commenced publication of the first daily illustrated newspaper in England, which was called \"The Daily Graphic\".\nIt was published until 16 October 1926, when it was incorporated with the \"Daily Sketch\". <br>\n\nLuson Thomas's seventh son George Holt Thomas was a director of the newspaper company and became general manager. Holt Thomas founded \"The Bystander\" and later \"Empire Illustrated\" before abandoning newspapers in 1906 and making a greater name for himself in the aviation industry.\n\nOn 15 August 1932, \"Time\" magazine reported the name change to \"The National Graphic\" and editor William Comyns Beaumont of \"The Bystander\" took over, replacing Alan John Bott.\n\n\n\n"}

High school students have the option of taking German. There is a strong emphasis on science, mathematics, and the arts. History, civics, and geography are also offered.\n\nLoyola High School and Junior College are recognized by the Government of Maharashtra and prepare students for the Maharashtra State Secondary School Certificate (SSC, Std X) and the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC, Std XII) examinations. \n\nThe school was founded in the early 1960s. Fr. Schoch, S.J., had dreamt of the site where the school is now situated and requested the National Chemical Laboratory (who owned the land) to set up a school. Land was leased. The school takes its name from St. Ignatius of Loyola, a sixteenth-century saint who was recognised for his devotion to education and is best known for founding the Society of Jesus. Loyola High School is run by Jesuit priests and welcomes students from all ethnic, cultural, and economic backgrounds. Establishment of the school became necessary to take the load off the highly popular St. Vincent's High School, Pune Camp, and all students not living in Pune Camp and Pune City (up to Lakdipul, i.e., the wooden bridge across the River Mutha connecting Pune City with Deccan Gymkhana) were asked to shift to Loyola's. The same logic was applied to the overcrowded St Mary's School opposite St. Vincent's and the affected girls were shifted to The Convent of Jesus And Mary at St. Joseph's High School, located directly between Loyola's and Pashan Road.\n\nAnother compelling reason was that children of Faculty and Staff at the National Defence Academy, some 25 km from Pune Camp, did not have school facilities beyond Class V. The junior school at NDA was run by Jesuits, the Principal being the imposing figure of the cigar-toting Rev. Rehm, from Switzerland. This entire school and staff was merged with Loyola and all children of residents in the NDA would come to Loyola's/St Joseph's, a 15-km trip by bus. This cost them 45 minutes each day, but was actually a 30-minute saving each way compared to schooling at St. Vincent's/St. Mary's. Rev. Rehm was the first Principal of Loyola, when the school became operational, from 1961–63, handing over to Rev. A.E.Oesch.\n\nThe girls' school building was not yet complete, so girls in Classes 10 and 11 were moved to Loyola's until 1963. Loyola's had an interesting faculty amongst the Jesuit Priests. Rev. Bernadetti, an Italian, taught German, followed by Rev. Toscano, another Italian, followed thereafter by Mrs Mani and Mrs Sahasrabudhe. Rev. D'Costa, a Portuguese priest taught English. In classes 10 and 11, Rev. Oesch, an Austrian, took over German, English and Higher English. Rev. Gregory taught up to nine subjects-Algebra, Geometry, Arithmetic, Higher Arithmetic, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Botany and Zoology - assisted by Mr. Contractor. Mr. Mahamuni, spent half his time as a Hindi teacher teaching Drawing; the Drawing teacher, Mr. Khataukar, taught Maharashtrian History.\n\nIn 1965-66, 29 boys appeared for their Matriculate (Class XI) and all 29 got a First Division, with seven Distinctions. One lad came first in the state, but was relegated to 2nd for an unknown reason. The prominent industrialist, Racehorse owner and ex- Member of the Committee at Royal Western India Turf Club Ltd., Mr. Vijay Shirke was among the seven distinctions.\nRev. Oesch, Principal 1963-66, had represented Austria in the 1936 Olympics- famous for Jesse Owens' performance in Hitler's presence- in both soccer and javelin throw. Thanks to his efforts in one year thereafter, Loyola won every possible inter-school athletics or sports meet. To cite an example, in 1966 Loyola was 0-5 down in goals vs Modern School at the halfway stage in an inter-school match, when Rev. Oesch arrived and spoke to his boys at the interval. They equalised in the next 45 minutes, reaching 5-5, winning the replay next day 6-5.\n\nThe school had 474 boys and 27 girls registered in 1961. The Ground floor had class rooms, the Principal's office, the admin section, the bookshop, the watering hole and Physics laboratories. The first floor had classrooms and Chemistry laboratories. There were no Biology or Zoology labs. The 2nd/top floor was only partly constructed and housed the Jesuit priests. It took two years for completion of Phase 1 of the school and the girls returned to their school as that edifice had also been completed.\n\nWith all rooms available, it was time to move the Jesuits into a community house of their own, and use all rooms on the three floors, numbering 30, as classrooms. In the mid-eighties, the local rule on pupil strength per class was amended to increase boys per class to thirty five. The school could now accommodate over 1000 students. A small temporary seminary for eight was built behind the school, extending westwards, which was adequate, but there was no assembly hall or space for comprehensive laboratories. It was decided to integrate the extant seminary with a much larger and fully equipped Laboratory Section being erected directly behind the School and build a separate walled-in seminary just off the approach road to the School, to the East. The Principal and other Jesuits moved into this building.\nAll were Jesuit priests except 2003-2007:\nThe school is located in the Pashan area, near Shivaji Nagar, 13 km from Pune railway station. It is adjacent to the Headquarters of Pune Rural Police, Pune Police Wireless, the St. Josephs Girls School and is located one kilometer from the National Chemical Laboratory and the Armament Research and Development Establishment. Close by is the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune. On the other side of the hill flanking the school lies the Chaturshringi temple.\n\nThere is a two-floored library, and science and computer labs. The auditorium has a stage with lighting and balcony seating. In 2011 Esense Learning program was introduced in the school. Projectors were installed in every classroom.\n\nSports facilities include a 25-meter swimming pool, diving boards, children's pool, basketball courts, and football and hockey fields. The swimming pool complex was completed in 1971. Loyola remains one of the few schools in Pune with a 400m Olympic-size track for athletics.\n\nA FIFA-standard natural grass football pitch was recently inaugurated. The four-inch sand-based pitch, backed with an auto popup irrigation system and a slit-drain drainage system, is a first-of-its-kind at any school in the city. The idea of having a sand-based pitch below a grass pitch was primarily to be in sync with world practices that include having a good drainage system and importantly softness to the ground. As a school it remained pertinent to give the kids a surface that is playable all year round and reduce injury risk in their formative years.\n\nThe house system fosters a sense of collective responsibility and solidarity amongst students. It serves as the centre of school life, with students from houses competing at sports and other co-curricular activities. The four houses are Blue, Green, Red, and Gold. Every house has a Commander and Flag Bearer.\nBoys from class 1 to class 8 wear half-sleeved beige shirts and dark beige shorts. Class 9 and 10 boys wear dark beige trousers and the same shirt. Junior college boys wear full-sleeved beige shirts and dark beige trousers. The rest of the uniform consists of brown shoes and a brown belt. The PT uniform consists of the house-coloured, sleeveless T-shirt and shorts.\n\nThe Ex-Loyola Students' Association (ELSA) arranged career seminars, inter-school quiz competitions, sponsored the school magazine, and arranged the school's 25th year celebrations. Today ELSA stands inactive but the Ex-Loyola Alumni Network (ELAN) was formed by another generation alumni. ELAN has been active since 1997. It organises annual get-togethers for ex-students. It is now the official alumni body of the school and ELSA is merged to ELAN. ELAN supports school activities and assists former teachers. ELAN planned the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the school in 2010-2011.\n\nAs part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations :\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2333767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333767", "title": "Neonatal jaundice", "text": "Neonatal jaundice\n\nNeonatal jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the white part of the eyes and skin in a newborn baby due to high bilirubin levels. Other symptoms may include excess sleepiness or poor feeding. Complications may include seizures, cerebral palsy, or kernicterus.\nIn many cases there is no specific underlying disorder (physiologic). In other cases it results from red blood cell breakdown, liver disease, infection, hypothyroidism, or metabolic disorders (pathologic). A bilirubin level more than 34 μmol/l (2 mg/dL) may be visible. Concerns, in otherwise healthy babies, occur when levels are greater than 308 μmol/L (18 mg/dL), jaundice is noticed in the first day of life, there is a rapid rise in levels, jaundice lasts more than two weeks, or the baby appears unwell. In those with concerning findings further investigations to determine the underlying cause are recommended.\nThe need for treatment depends on bilirubin levels, the age of the child, and the underlying cause. Treatments may include more frequent feeding, phototherapy, or exchange transfusions. In those who are born early more aggressive treatment tends to be required. Physiologic jaundice generally lasts less than seven days. The condition affects over half of babies in the first week of life. Of babies that are born early about 80% are affected. Globally over 100,000 late-preterm and term babies die each year as a result of jaundice.\nThe primary symptom is yellowish discoloration of the white part of the eyes and skin in a newborn baby. Other symptoms may include excess sleepiness or poor feeding.\n\nA bilirubin level more than 34 μmol/l (2 mg/dL) may be visible. For the feet to be affected level generally must be over 255 μmol/l (15 mg/dL).\n\nProlonged hyperbilirubinemia (severe jaundice) can result in chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus). Quick and accurate treatment of neonatal jaundice helps to reduce the risk of neonates developing kernicterus.\n\nInfants with kernicterus may have a fever or seizures. High pitched crying is an effect of kernicterus.\n\nExchange transfusions performed to lower high bilirubin levels are an aggressive treatment.\n\nIn newborns, jaundice tends to develop because of two factors—the breakdown of fetal hemoglobin as it is replaced with adult hemoglobin and the relatively immature metabolic pathways of the liver, which are unable to conjugate and so excrete bilirubin as quickly as an adult. This causes an accumulation of bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia), leading to the symptoms of jaundice.\n\nIf the neonatal jaundice does not clear up with simple phototherapy, other causes such as biliary atresia, Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, bile duct paucity, Alagille syndrome, alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, and other pediatric liver diseases should be considered. The evaluation for these will include blood work and a variety of diagnostic tests. Prolonged neonatal jaundice is serious and should be followed up promptly.\n\nSevere neonatal jaundice may indicate the presence of other conditions contributing to the elevated bilirubin levels, of which there are a large variety of possibilities (see below). These should be detected or excluded as part of the differential diagnosis to prevent the development of complications. They can be grouped into the following categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Breastfeeding jaundice\" or \"lack of breastfeeding jaundice,\" is caused by insufficient breast milk intake, resulting in inadequate quantities of bowel movements to remove bilirubin from the body. This leads to increased enterohepatic circulation, resulting in increased reabsorption of bilirubin from the intestines. Usually occurring in the first week of life, most cases can be ameliorated by frequent breastfeeding sessions of sufficient duration to stimulate adequate milk production.\n\nWhereas breastfeeding jaundice is a mechanical problem, breast milk jaundice is a biochemical occurrence and the higher bilirubin possibly acts as an antioxidant. Breast milk jaundice occurs later in the newborn period, with the bilirubin level usually peaking in the sixth to 14th days of life. This late-onset jaundice may develop in up to one third of healthy breastfed infants.\n\n\nMost infants develop visible jaundice due to elevation of unconjugated bilirubin concentration during their first week. This is called physiological jaundice. This pattern of hyperbilirubinemia has been classified into two functionally distinct periods.\n\n\nMechanism involved in physiological jaundice are mainly:\n\nDiagnosis is often by measuring the serum bilirubin level in the blood. In those who are born after 35 weeks and are more than a day old transcutaneous bilirubinometer may also be used. The use of an icterometer, a piece of transparent plastic painted in five transverse strips of graded yellow lines, is not recommended.\n\nThis is hand held, portable and rechargeable but expensive. When pressure is applied to the photoprobe, a xenon tube generates a strobe light, and this light passes through the subcutaneous tissue. The reflected light returns through the second fiber optic bundle to the spectrophotometric module. The intensity of the yellow color in this light, after correcting for the hemoglobin, is measured and instantly displayed in arbitrary units.\n\nAny of the following features suggests pathological jaundice:\n\nThe signs which help detect pathological jaundice are the presence of intrauterine growth restriction, stigma of intrauterine infections (e.g. cataracts, small head, and enlargement of the liver and spleen), cephalohematoma, bruising, signs of bleeding in the brain's ventricles. History of illness is noteworthy. Family history of jaundice and anemia, family history of neonatal or early infant death due to liver disease, maternal illness suggestive of viral infection (fever, rash or lymphadenopathy), maternal drugs (e.g. sulphonamides, anti-malarials causing red blood cell destruction in G6PD deficiency) are suggestive of pathological jaundice in neonates.\n\nThe bilirubin levels for initiative of phototherapy varies depends on the age and health status of the newborn. However, any newborn with a total serum bilirubin greater than 359 μmol/l ( 21 mg/dL) should receive phototherapy.\n\nBabies with neonatal jaundice may be treated with colored light called phototherapy, which works by changing trans-bilirubin into the water-soluble cis-bilirubin isomer.\n\nThe phototherapy involved is not ultraviolet light therapy but rather a specific frequency of blue light. The light can be applied with overhead lamps, which means that the baby's eyes need to be covered, or with a device called a biliblanket, which sits under the baby's clothing close to its skin.\n\nThe use of phototherapy was first discovered, accidentally, at Rochford Hospital in Essex, England, when a nurse, Sister Jean Ward, noticed that babies exposed to sunlight had reduced jaundice, and a pathologist, Dr. Perryman, who noticed that a vial of blood left in the sun had turned green. Drs Cremer, Richards and Dobbs put together these observations, leading to a landmark randomized clinical trial which was published in \"Pediatrics\" in 1968; it took another ten years for the practice to become established.\nMassage therapy could be useful in addition to phototherapy in order to reduce the phototherapy duration. However, it does not appear to reduce the requirement for phototherapy in the treatment of neonatal jaundice.\n\nThere is currently no reliable evidence about whether home-based or hospital-based phototherapy is more effective for full term infants with jaundice.\n\nMuch like with phototherapy the level at which exchange transfusion should occur depends on the health status and age of the newborn. It should however be used for any newborn with a total serum bilirubin of greater than 428 μmol/l ( 25 mg/dL ).\n\nHomeopathy, acupuncture, and traditional Chinese medicine do not work and should not be used.\n\nPenicillamine was studied in the 1970s in hyperbilirubinemia due to ABO hemolytic disease. While tin mesoporphyrin IX may decrease bilirubin such use is not recommended in babies. Preclinical studies have looked at minocycline to help prevent neurotoxicity. Clofibrate may decrease the duration of phototherapy. Evidence as of 2012 however is insufficient to recommend its use.\n\n"}

It was translated from an Indic language (see History) and is found in Taisho 685 and Taisho 686 in Volume 16, the third volume of the Collected Sutra Section. Taisho 685 was translated by Dharmarakṣa from 265-311 CE and is entitled: ‘The Buddha Speaks the Yulanpen Sutra’. Taisho 686 was translated by an unknown or lost translator during the Eastern Jin Dynasty and is entitled: ‘The Buddha Speaks the Sutra of Offering Bowls to Repay Kindness’. According to Karashima, Taisho 686 is basically a more idiomatic adaptation of Taisho 685. It records the events which followed after one of the disciples of Shakyamuni Buddha, Maudgalyayana, achieves Abhijñā and uses his newfound powers to search for his deceased parents. In the end, Maudgalyayana finds his mother in the preta (hungry ghost) world and with the assistance of the Buddha, is able to save her. The East Asian Ghost Festival is based on this sutra.\n\nThe Yulanpen Sutra has traditionally been regarded as being translated from the Sanskrit into Chinese by Dharmarakṣa under the Jin at some point between 265-311 CE. The subject matter of the Yulanpen Sutra is broadly similar to several accounts described in other sutras. The most ancient of those accounts (Petavatthu No. 14 - The Story of the Mother of Sariputta) describes how the disciple Sāriputta rescued his mother (from five past lives ago) who had become a preta or hungry ghost. Similar to the Yulanpen Sutra, Sariputta builds four huts and fills them with food and drink for the Sangha of the four quarters; with the Buddha present, he dedicates this donation on behalf of his suffering mother. The transference of merit enables Sariputta's mother to be reborn and released from the preta world. Another account can be found in the Avadanasataka, which is also very similar to the Yulanpen Sutra: Maudgalyayana communicates on the behalf of five hundred pretas with their relatives who make offerings on the pretas' behalf to the monastic community. Once the transference of merit is completed, the former pretas are reborn and released from their suffering.\n\nThe sutra records the time when Maudgalyayana achieves abhijñā and uses his new found powers to search for his deceased parents. Maudgalyayana discovers that his deceased mother was reborn into the preta or hungry ghost realm. She was in a wasted condition and Maudgalyayana tried to help her by giving her a bowl of rice. Unfortunately as a preta, she was unable to eat the rice as it was transformed into burning coal. Maudgalyayana then asks the Buddha to help him; whereupon Buddha explains how one is able to assist one's current parents and deceased parents in this life and in one's past seven lives by willingly offering food, etc., to the sangha or monastic community during Pravarana (the end of the monsoon season or vassa), which usually occurs on the 15th day of the seventh month whereby the monastic community transfers the merits to the deceased parents, etc.,\n\nThe sutra was picked up almost immediately by Chinese festival guides like the \"Jingchu Suishiji\" and helped create the modern Ghost Festival. It also influenced the older Japanese Bon Festival.\n\n\n\n"}

Harrison spent several years as the bassist of the American rock band Blondie during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIn the early 1970s Harrison lived in Princes Risborough near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. He was the bassist for the local band Farm, and later recorded and toured with Silverhead (fronted by Michael Des Barres) from 1972 to 1974. On August 11, 1974 he played bass for the infamous \"Murder of a Virgin\", Iggy Pop's first solo performance. He was recruited to Blondie from Nite City (former The Doors' keyboardist Ray Manzarek's short-lived band) in 1977 after the band recorded their second album \"Plastic Letters\" without a regular bass player and stayed until the band split after Tracks Across America Tour '82.\n\nDuring his time with Blondie, Nigel Harrison contributed as a songwriter to every album he played on and also co-wrote several hit singles with Debbie Harry, such as \"One Way or Another\", \"Union City Blue\" and the band's last single with their original line-up, \"War Child\", released in 1982.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1984, he was a member of the band Chequered Past, which also included two of his former bandmates: Des Barres, from Silverhead, steve Jones from The Sex Pistols and Clem Burke, from Blondie. They released an eponymous album in 1984. Harrison was also music supervisor/producer for the soundtrack to the 1988 comedy \"Tapeheads\".\n\nIn 1991, he had a small part in a British film Young Soul Rebels as 'Cid Man'.\n\nWhen Blondie started to talk about re-forming in 1997, Harrison was initially asked to rejoin the group. He recorded demo tracks with the band for the album \"No Exit\" (1999), but was dropped from the band before the record was finished. He and another excluded former member, Frank Infante, brought a lawsuit over the dispute, but were unsuccessful.\n\nHarrison was an A&R Executive at Interscope Records, who also did A&R work for Capitol Records.\n\nHe is now the bass player for The Grabs, whose album \"Sex, Fashion And Money\" was released in November 2005.\n\nIn March 2006, Blondie, following an introductory speech by Shirley Manson of Garbage, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Seven members were invited to the ceremony, which led to an on-stage spat between the extant group and their former bandmate Frank Infante, who asked during the live broadcast of the ceremony that he and Harrison be allowed to perform with the group, a request refused by Debbie Harry.\n\n"}

A dialect may use any desired syntax, but it must be possible to demonstrate precisely how the concrete syntax of a dialect conforms to the abstract CL semantics, which are based on a model theoretic interpretation. Each dialect may be then treated as a formal language. Once syntactic conformance is established, a dialect gets the CL semantics for free, as they are specified relative to the abstract syntax only, and hence are inherited by any conformant dialect. In addition, all CL dialects are equivalent (i.e., can be mechanically translated to each other), although some may be more expressive than others.\n\nIn general, a less expressive subset of CL may be translated to a more expressive version of CL, but the reverse translation is only defined on a subset of the larger language.\n\nCommon Logic is published by ISO as \"ISO/IEC 24707:2007 - Information technology — Common Logic (CL): a framework for a family of logic-based languages\".

In 1902 they moved to Southport trading as Vulcan Motor Manufacturing and Trading and built the first Vulcan car which was a 4hp single-cylinder belt-driven type driving the rear wheels through a two speed gearbox and a belt to the back axle. In 1903, this grew to 6.5hp with shaft drive and the chassis was now \"armoured ash\". Twin-cylinder 1.5 L models followed in 1904 now with steel chassis and in 1905, 2 and then 3 L four-cylinder types appeared and the company moved from Yellow House Lane to Hawesside Street, both in Southport. Things kept growing and a van version of the twin came in 1906 along with large 4.8 L six-cylinder models and a move to even larger premises at Crossens, Southport with a change of company name to Vulcan Motor and Engineering. The six-cylinder model grew to 6 L in 1908. In 1912, a new small car — the 10/12 of 1.8 L with two-cylinder Aster engine — was added, the first use of a bought in engine.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I, the range consisted of the 2.4 L four-cylinder 10/15, the 2.6 L 15.9, the 3 L 15/20 and the last of the old sixes, the 25/30. As a sign of things to come, a truck was also offered. This model saw use as an ambulance in Britain, India, Belgium, Russia, and Portugal. During the war, the factory concentrated on munitions. In 1916, the Hampson brothers left the company and it was reformed as Vulcan Motor Engineering (1916) under the control of C.B. Wardman. In 1918, the company bought Southport F.C. which was renamed Southport Vulcan — thus becoming the first football club to take a sponsor's name.\n\nIn 1919, Harper Bean acquired 75% of the company under a complex cash and shares deal and went into the British Motor Trading Corporation with the intention Vulcan be responsible for commercial vehicles; nevertheless, car production continued. The group also included Swift Motor Company and a number of components manufacturers.\n\nWith peace the first new launch was the 16 with 2.6 L Dorman engine. The cars now had a flat radiator replacing the pre-war \"bullnose\" type. There was also a nominal 12 model which became the main product from 1920 to 1927, which was available with a range of engines from Dorman (1.8 L), Meadows (1.5 L), and British Anzani (1.5 L). The model was also sold as the Lea-Francis Kirkstone as from 1922 the companies shared some manufacturing and a dealer network. The 20 available from 1920 to 1922 with 3.3 L Vulcan engine and from 1923 to 1925 with 3.7 L shared mechanical components with the 1½ and 2 ton trucks. The final car was the 14/40 (1927–28) and 16/60 (1928–29) with their own design twin camshaft six of 1.7 and 2 L. Production capacity was nearly 5000 per annum, a potential never reached as the orders did not materialize. Nonetheless, over 6000 Vulcans of all kinds were sold from the armistice until 1923, which proved to be a high watermark for the company. The 1½ and 2 ton models were the mainstay of truck production until the 1926 introduction of heavier four ton units, with four-cylinder engines and also a six-cylinder Dorman bus chassis. Commercial vehicles began to supplant automobiles as Vulcan's main product around this time, with buses and light (¾ ton) military vehicles alongside the trucks.\n\nFinancial problems came in 1928 and C. B. Wardman resigned and officially no more Vulcan cars came from Southport but some badged as Lea-Francis were made up to 1930. \n\nFrom 1930, production was solely of trucks and buses which had been made seriously since 1922. Many of the trucks were aimed at the municipal market and road sweepers and refuse trucks sold well. New lighter commercials of American inspired designs depredated Vulcan's sales, however, and the Great Depression made things more dire yet. By 1931 the company was in compulsory liquidation, although they continued trading in their more profitable fields for several years, building small volumes.\n\nAmongst the buses, twenty-seater buses were sold from 1922 on the two-ton chassis. A 6.6 L Vulcan-engined 32-seat Brisbane came in 1928 and the Emperor double decker in 1930.\n\nBrockhouse Engineering took over Vulcan in the mid-thirties and managed to keep production going until 1938, when the remains of the company was sold to Tilling-Stevens, a bus manufacturer of Maidstone, Kent. Vulcan (petrol) or Gardner (diesel) engined trucks re-entered production, alongside a new five ton, Perkins-engined lorry. Six ton Vulcans were produced in large numbers during World War II, also with electric power. After the war, six tonners and heavier articulated trucks were built in large numbers, around 1000 per year, and a new seven tonner appeared at that 1950's Commercial Motor Show in London. The range was successful enough that Tilling-Stevens ended up being taken over by the Rootes Group in 1951. Rootes, however, had their own established commercial makers in Commer and Karrier and as those brands introduced their own heavier trucks both Vulcan and Tilling-Stevens were squeezed out. The two brands vanished finally in 1953.\n\nThe original factory premises at 13 Yellowhouse Lane were finally demolished on 25 March 2010 as a result of the British government policy to levy business taxes on the owners of empty buildings.\n\nThe second factory which was built in 1907 in Rufford Road, Crossens, Southport has been partially demolished but some of the building still remains standing. The old boardroom and administration block are still in situ as is a small part of the original factory. The last occupiers, Vitrathene Ltd (a plastic manufacturer) ceased trading on 30 September 2011 and the building is now unoccupied. The future of the building remains uncertain.\n\n"}
{"id": "2333824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333824", "title": "Optical fiber connector", "text": "Optical fiber connector\n\nAn optical fiber connector terminates the end of an optical fiber, and enables quicker connection and disconnection than splicing. The connectors mechanically couple and align the cores of fibers so light can pass. Better connectors lose very little light due to reflection or misalignment of the fibers. In all, about 100 different types of fiber optic connectors have been introduced to the market.\n\nOptical fiber connectors are used to join optical fibers where a connect/disconnect capability is required. Due to the polishing and tuning procedures that may be incorporated into optical connector manufacturing, connectors are often assembled onto optical fiber in a supplier's manufacturing facility. However, the assembly and polishing operations involved can be performed in the field, for example, to terminate long runs at a patch panel.\n\nOptical fiber connectors are used in telephone exchanges, for customer premises wiring, and in outside plant applications to connect equipment and cables, or to cross-connect cables.\n\nMost optical fiber connectors are spring-loaded, so the fiber faces are pressed together when the connectors are mated. The resulting glass-to-glass or plastic-to-plastic contact eliminates signal losses that would be caused by an air gap between the joined fibers.\n\nPerformance of optical fiber connectors can be quantified by insertion loss and return loss. Measurements of these parameters are now defined in IEC standard 61753-1. The standard gives five grades for insertion loss from A (best) to D (worst), and M for multimode. The other parameter is return loss, with grades from 1 (best) to 5 (worst).\n\nA variety of optical fiber connectors are available, but SC and LC connectors are the most common types of connectors on the market. Typical connectors are rated for 500–1,000 mating cycles. The main differences among types of connectors are dimensions and methods of mechanical coupling. Generally, organizations will standardize on one kind of connector, depending on what equipment they commonly use.\n\nIn many data center applications, small (e.g., LC) and multi-fiber (e.g., MTP/MPO) connectors have replaced larger, older styles (e.g., SC), allowing more fiber ports per unit of rack space.\n\nOutside plant applications may require connectors be located underground, or on outdoor walls or utility poles. In such settings, protective enclosures are often used, and fall into two broad categories: hermetic (sealed) and free-breathing. Hermetic cases prevent entry of moisture and air but, lacking ventilation, can become hot if exposed to sunlight or other sources of heat. Free-breathing enclosures, on the other hand, allow ventilation, but can also admit moisture, insects and airborne contaminants. Selection of the correct housing depends on the cable and connector type, the location, and environmental factors.\n\nMany types of optical connector have been developed at different times, and for different purposes. Many of them are summarized in the tables below.\n\nModern connectors typically use a \"physical contact\" polish on the fiber and ferrule end. This is a slightly convex surface with the apex of the curve accurately centered on the fiber, so that when the connectors are mated the fiber cores come into direct contact with one another. Some manufacturers have several grades of polish quality, for example a regular FC connector may be designated \"FC/PC\" (for physical contact), while \"FC/SPC\" and \"FC/UPC\" may denote \"super\" and \"ultra\" polish qualities, respectively. Higher grades of polish give less insertion loss and lower back reflection.\n\nMany connectors are available with the fiber end face polished at an angle to prevent light that reflects from the interface from traveling back up the fiber. Because of the angle, the reflected light does not stay in the fiber core but instead leaks out into the cladding. Angle-polished connectors should only be mated to other angle-polished connectors. The APC angle is normally 8 degrees, however, SC/APC also exists as 9 degrees in some countries. Mating to a non-angle polished connector causes very high insertion loss. Generally angle-polished connectors have higher insertion loss than good quality straight physical contact ones. \"Ultra\" quality connectors may achieve comparable back reflection to an angled connector when connected, but an angled connection maintains low back reflection even when the output end of the fiber is disconnected.\n\nAngle-polished connections are distinguished visibly by the use of a green strain relief boot, or a green connector body. The parts are typically identified by adding \"/APC\" (angled physical contact) to the name. For example, an angled FC connector may be designated FC/APC, or merely FCA. Non-angled versions may be denoted FC/PC or with specialized designations such as FC/UPC or FCU to denote an \"ultra\" quality polish on the fiber end face. Two different versions of FC/APC exist: FC/APC-N (NTT) and FC/APC-R (Reduced). An FC/APC-N connector key will not fit into a FC/APC-R adapter key slot.\n\nMT-RJ connectors look like a miniature RJ-45 connector.\n\nST connectors refer to having a \"straight tip\", as the sides of the ceramic tip are parallel—as opposed to the predecessor bi-conic connector which aligned as two nesting ice cream cones would.\n\nSC is short for \"subscriber connector\". SMA is short for \"subminiature assembly\".\n\nField-mountable optical fiber connectors are used to join optical fiber jumper cables that contain one single-mode fiber. Field-mountable optical fiber connectors are used for field restoration work and to eliminate the need to stock jumper cords of various sizes.\n\nThese assemblies can be separated into two major categories: single-jointed connector assemblies and multiple-jointed connector assemblies. According to Telcordia GR-1081, a single-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly where there is only one spot where two different fibers are joined together. This is the situation generally found when connector assemblies are made from factory-assembled optical fiber connector plugs. A multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly where there is more than one closely spaced connection joining different fibers together. An example of a multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly that uses the stub-fiber type of connector plug.\n\nFeatures of good connector design:\n\n\nGlass fiber optic connector performance is affected both by the connector and by the glass fiber. Concentricity tolerances affect the fiber, fiber core, and connector body. The core optical index of refraction is also subject to variations. Stress in the polished fiber can cause excess return loss. The fiber can slide along its length in the connector. The shape of the connector tip may be incorrectly profiled during polishing. The connector manufacturer has little control over these factors, so in-service performance may well be below the manufacturer's specification.\n\nTesting fiber optic connector assemblies falls into two general categories: factory testing and field testing.\n\nFactory testing is sometimes statistical, for example, a process check. A profiling system may be used to ensure the overall polished shape is correct, and a good quality optical microscope to check for blemishes. Insertion loss and return loss performance is checked using specific reference conditions, against a reference-standard single mode test lead, or using an \"Encircled Flux Compliant\" source for multi-mode testing. Testing and rejection (\"yield\") may represent a significant part of the overall manufacturing cost.\n\nField testing is usually simpler. A special hand-held optical microscope is used to check for dirt or blemishes. A power meter and light source or an optical loss test set (OLTS) is used to test end-to-end loss, and an optical time-domain reflectometer may be used to identify significant point losses or return losses.\n\n\n"}

He was then raised in the community of Galiwinku on Elcho Island, Arnhem Land. \nAn icon of Aboriginal rock music he is best known as the charismatic frontman of Warumpi Band.\n\nBurarrwanga's musical career began as a child through the education of Ancestral Song Lines which his father, Charlie Matjuwuy Burarrwanga mastered in depth of historical knowledge, pitch, tone and feeling. Matjuwuy was to become the most respected and sought after Yolngu ceremonial singer across Australia's Indigenous communities until his death in 2018 in his eighties. \n\nDuring the late 1970's, leaving behind the seashores for the desert community of Yuendumu, Rrurrambu married Felicity Robertson and became fluent in the Walpiri language and law as if he were \"learning like a baby\". He and Felicity had their first child, Glenda, who is a strong advocate for the rights of community members struggling with mainstream culture and revered healer.\n\nYuendumu is closely located to the community of Papunya where families of both communities regularly visit one another. It was on one of these visits where George was to encounter two brothers; Sammy Butcher and Gordon Butcher together with Neil Murray musing over backyard arrangements without the confidence of a singer. \n\nOral history, from George recalling these initial meetings was how clearly his lead singer's role was destined in the founding of Warumpi Band. In the meantime, Neil Murray's comfort amongst the Butcher Brother's was suddenly displaced by Rrurrambu's talent, tenacity and blinding charismatic presence ... all of what was needed to take the world by storm, which even Murray couldn't resist.\n\nIn 1983 they released the single \"Jailanguru Pakarnu\" (\"Out of Jail\"), the first rock song ever released in an Australian Aboriginal language.\n\nThree albums, \"Big Name No Blanket\" (1985), \"Go Bush\" (1988) and \"Too Much Humbug\" (1996), followed, including the anthemic songs \"Blackfella/Whitefella\" and \"My Island Home\", the latter of which was made famous when it was covered by Christine Anu in 1995.\n\nBurarrwanga performed at a number of major music festivals, including WOMADelaide, the Melbourne International Arts Festival, the Adelaide Fringe Festival, the indigenous music events Stompen Ground in Broome and the Garma Festival in Gove.\n\nAfter the break-up of the Warumpi Band, Burarrwanga launched a lower-key solo career, performing to sellout crowds at the Festival of Darwin and appearing live on national television for the Yeperenye Federation Festival in Alice Springs during 2000. He then launched a solo reggae album, touring throughout the Northern Territory and then to Europe in 2002.\n\nThroughout his career Burarrwanga was active in promoting reconciliation and cross-cultural understanding between black and white Australians. In later years Burarrwanga largely returned to traditional Aboriginal life, attending funeral and circumcision ceremonies with his father, a Gumatj clan leader. He was a proponent of combining the technical experience of white Australia with the knowledge of the land of the Aboriginal people to achieve more successful outcomes.\n\nAfter his death at the age of 50 in 2007 he became known as George Burarrwanga for cultural reasons. Recently, his original Yolngu name has returned to use - the liner notes to the \"Warumpi Band 4 Ever\" box set refer to him as George Rrurrambu Burarrwanga.\n\n"}

{"id": "2333854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333854", "title": "Tumbleweed", "text": "Tumbleweed\n\nA tumbleweed is a structural part of the above-ground anatomy of a number of species of plants, a diaspore that, once it is mature and dry, detaches from its root or stem, and rolls due to the force of the wind. In most such species, the tumbleweed is in effect the entire plant apart from the root system, but in other plants, a hollow fruit or inflorescence might detach instead. Tumbleweed species occur most commonly in steppe and arid ecosystems, where frequent wind and the open environment permit rolling without prohibitive obstruction.\n\nApart from its primary vascular system and roots, the tissues of the tumbleweed structure are dead; their death is functional because it is necessary for the structure to degrade gradually and fall apart so that its seeds or spores can escape during the tumbling, or germinate after the tumbleweed has come to rest in a wet location. In the latter case, many species of tumbleweed open mechanically, releasing their seeds as they swell when they absorb water.\n\nThe tumbleweed diaspore disperses seeds, but the tumbleweed strategy is not limited to the seed plants; some species of spore-bearing cryptogams—such as \"Selaginella\"—form tumbleweeds, and some fungi that resemble puffballs dry out, break free of their attachments and are similarly tumbled by the wind, dispersing spores as they go.\n\nThe tumbleweed dispersal strategies are unusual among plants; most species disperse their seeds by other mechanisms. Many tumbleweeds are ruderal species, opportunistic agricultural weeds. Tumbleweeds have been recorded in the following plant groups:\nIn the family Amaranthaceae \"s.l.\" (i.e. broadly defined to include Chenopodiaceae), several annual species of the genus \"Kali\" are tumbleweeds. They are thought to be native to Eurasia, but when their seeds entered North America in shipments of agricultural seeds, they became naturalized in large areas. In the cinema genre of Westerns, they have long been symbols of frontier areas. \"Kali tragus\" is the so-called \"Russian thistle\". It is an annual plant that breaks off at the stem base when it dies, and forms a tumbleweed, dispersing its seeds as the wind rolls it along. It is said to have arrived in the United States in shipments of flax seeds to South Dakota, perhaps about 1870. It now is a noxious weed throughout North America, dominating disturbed habitats such as roadsides, cultivated fields, eroded slopes, and arid regions with sparse vegetation. Though it is a troublesome weed, \"Kali tragus\" also provides useful livestock forage on arid rangelands.\n\nOther members of the Amaranthaceae (s.l.) that form tumbleweeds include \"Kochia\" species, \"Cycloloma atriplicifolium\", and \"Corispermum hyssopifolium\", which are called plains tumbleweed. \"Atriplex rosea\" is called the tumbling oracle or tumbling orach.\n\nAmong the Amaranthaceae (s.s.) that form tumbleweeds, there are several species of \"Amaranthus\", such as \"Amaranthus albus\", native to Central America but invasive in Europe, Asia, and Australia; and \"Amaranthus graecizans\", native to Africa, but naturalized in North America. \"Amaranthus retroflexus\", which is indigenous to tropical North and South America, has become nearly cosmopolitan largely as a weed, but like many other species of \"Amaranthus\", it also is widely valued as animal forage and as human food, though it should be utilised with caution to avoid toxicity.\n\nSeveral Southern African genera in the family Amaryllidaceae produce highly optimised tumbleweeds; their inflorescences are globular umbels with long, spoke-like pedicels, either effectively at ground level, or breaking off once the stems are dry. When the seeds are about ripe, the fruit remain attached to the peduncles, but the stem of the umbel detaches, permitting the globes to roll about in the wind. The light, open, globular structures form very effective tumbleweed diaspores, dropping their seeds usually within a few days as the follicles fail under the wear of rolling. The seeds are fleshy, short-lived, and germinate rapidly where they land. Being poisonous and distasteful, they are not attractive to candidate transport animals, so the rolling diaspore is a very effective dispersal strategy for such plants. Genera with this means of seed dispersal include \"Ammocharis\", \"Boophone\", \"Crossyne\" and \"Brunsvigia\".\n\nSome species of the Apiaceae form tumbleweeds from their flower umbels, much as some Amaryllidaceae do.\n\nIn the Asteraceae, the knapweed \"Centaurea diffusa\" forms tumbleweeds. It is native to Eurasia and is naturalized in much of North America. Also in the Asteraceae, \"Lessingia glandulifera\", native to America, sometimes forms tumbleweeds; it grows on sandy soils in desert areas, chaparral, and open pine forests of the western United States.\n\nIn the Brassicaceae, \"Sisymbrium altissimum\", \"Crambe maritima\", \"Lepidium\", and a resurrection plant, \"Anastatica\" form tumbleweeds.\n\nIn the Caryophyllaceae, the garden plant \"baby's-breath\" (\"Gypsophila paniculata\"), produces a dry inflorescence that forms tumbleweeds. In parts of central and western North America, it has become a common weed in many locations including hayfields and pastures.\n\nIn the legume family (Fabaceae), \"Baptisia tinctoria\" and some species of \"Psoralea\" produce tumbleweeds. In \"Psoralea\" the tumbleweed detaches from the plant by abscission of the stem.\n\nIn the Plantaginaceae, \"Plantago cretica\" forms tumbleweeds.\n\nInflorescences that act as tumbling diaspores occur in some grasses, including \"Schedonnardus paniculatus\" and some species of \"Eragrostis\" and \"Aristida\". In these plants, the inflorescences break off and tumble in the wind instead of the whole plant, much as happens in some of the Apiaceae and Amaryllidaceae. The species of \"Spinifex\" from Southeast Asia are prominent examples of this dispersal adaptation. These grasses are often called tumble-grasses, including such species as \"Panicum capillare\" and \"Eragrostis pectinacea\" in the United States.\n\nIn the Solanaceae, \"Solanum rostratum \". forms tumbleweeds.\n\nWind dispersed fruits that tumble or roll on the ground, sometimes known as \"tumble fruits\", are rare. Some are technically achenes. Highly inflated indehiscent fruits that may facilitate tumbling include \"Alyssopsis\", \"Coluteocarpus\", \"Physoptychis\", \"Sutherlandia\" and \"Physaria\".\n\nVery similar in habit to \"Anastatica\", but practically unrelated, are the spore-bearing \"Selaginella lepidophylla\" (a lycopod) and earthstar mushroom family (Geastraceae). All of these curl into a ball when dry and uncurl when moistened.\n\n\"Bovista\", a genus of puffball, uses essentially the same dispersal strategy.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture classified the ubiquitous tumbleweeds as a non-native and highly invasive plant in the United States. They are considered noxious in nature and detrimental in many ways. Tumbleweeds thrive with disturbed soil situations and are a major contributor to native plant extinctions and wildfires. Despite over a century of cooperation between Mexican, Canadian, and U.S. governments to combat the species, Tumbleweeds can be found in most regions of North America.\n\nSome ruderal species that disperse as tumbleweeds are serious weeds that significantly promote wind erosion in open regions. Their effects are particularly harmful to dry-land agricultural operations where the outside application of additional moisture is not practicable. One study showed that a single Russian thistle can remove up to 167 liters (44 gallons) of water from the soil in competition with a wheat crop in one year. The amount of water removed from fallow land more subject to erosion would be even more damaging.\n\nIt sometimes happens that species of large tumbleweed, especially if thorny, can form aggregations that are physically hazardous and can block roads and cover buildings and vehicles. This can most obviously happen where fences and similar obstacles cause the accumulation, but the weeds can also entangle each other spontaneously until they form piles that can no longer roll. Such piles can be a serious threat to trapped vehicles or buildings and their occupants, most particularly because they are dry and flammable. Examples of enveloped buildings and vehicles have been documented mainly in the Western regions of the US. In residential areas, an example was the town of Mobridge, South Dakota, where tens of tons of large tumbleweeds (\"Russian thistles\") that had matured in the dry bed of nearby Lake Oahe buried many houses so deeply that mechanical equipment was necessary to remove it, release occupants, and counter the fire hazard.\n\nThere was a significant outbreak of \"Panicum effusum\" in the Australian town of Wangaratta in February 2016 that attracted international attention. The seed heads of the weed, known locally as \"hairy panic\", had piled several meters deep in some places, forcing residents to spend several hours removing it to regain access to their doors and homes. The local council subsequently indicated it was considering attaching large vacuums to street-sweepers in an attempt to control the outbreak.\n\nOn April 18, 2018, strong winds and neglected maintenance of neighboring private land brought in a very large number of tumbleweeds into Victorville, California and about 100 to 150 homes required help from public services after their entryways were at least partly blocked off. The local fire department also participated in the cleanup as the massive influx of tumbleweeds presented both a safety and fire hazard.\n\nA similar incident occurred on December 31, 2019, when high winds dislodged a large number of tumbleweeds on the Hanford Reservation northwest of Richland, Washington. The tumbleweeds piled up 15 to 20 feet (5-7 meters) deep in some areas, burying cars and trucks and closing Washington State Route 240 for ten hours while road crews used snowplows to remove the tumbleweeds.\n\nTumbleweeds have also been observed to cause issues with wastewater treatment plants. In some cases of inadequate fencing, they can get entangled in electromechanical equipment within plants such as clarifiers and mechanical aerators leading to increased energy use and labor cost associated with operating and cleaning the units.\n\n"}
{"id": "2333861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333861", "title": "All-seater stadium", "text": "All-seater stadium\n\nAn all-seater stadium is a sports stadium in which every spectator has a seat. This is commonplace in professional association football stadiums in nations such as the United Kingdom, Spain, and the Netherlands. Most association football and American football stadiums in the United States and Canadian Football League stadiums in Canada are all-seaters, as are most baseball and track and field stadiums in those countries. A stadium that is not an all-seater has areas for attendees holding standing-room only tickets to stand and view the proceedings. Such standing areas are known as terraces in Britain. Stands with only terraces used to dominate the football attendance in the UK. For instance, the \"South Bank Stand\" behind the southern goal at Molineux Stadium, Wolverhampton, home of Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C., had a maximum of 32,000 standing attenders, while the rest of the stadium hosted a little bit less than that (total maximum attendance was around 59,000).\n\nSome European countries, such as Germany, do not have all-seater stadiums. German fans expressed a preference to stand while watching football, so the country's grounds have large terraced areas. For instance, Borussia Dortmund's Westfalenstadion (commercially known as Signal Iduna Park) has an all-seated capacity of 65,829, but during Bundesliga games the attendance limit is set to 81,360. (If the general rule \"two standing occupies the same space as one sitting\" applies, then around 15,000 seats are replaced by 30,000 standing attenders at Bundesliga games.)\n\nIn 1977, Clydebank, a relatively small club, were promoted to the Scottish Premier Division. At that time, the grounds of clubs in Britain were required to comply with the Safety of Sports Grounds Act if their capacity was above 10,000. Clydebank, faced with a large bill to ensure compliance, decided to reduce the capacity of Kilbowie Park to 9,950 by bolting wooden bench seating to their terraces, which were open to the elements. Kilbowie thereby became the first all-seater ground in Britain, albeit as a response to an unforeseen problem rather than a long-term plan.\n\nAberdeen followed suit in 1978, putting benches on the open south terrace as the final part of a longer-term plan to make the ground all-seated. Subsequent to this, the south side of the ground was covered over, and Pittodrie Stadium was proclaimed as the country's first all-seated, all-covered ground, although the southern corners of the ground remained open to the skies. In 1981, Coventry City converted Highfield Road to all-seating, the first club in England to do so, at the instigation of the then chairman, Jimmy Hill. This move, forced on the fans, proved unpopular, with attendances declining, and terracing was reinstated at one end by 1985.\n\nIn 1986, Luton Town converted their Kenilworth Road stadium to all-seater status as one of the consequences of the Luton Town vs Millwall hooligan riot during their FA Cup sixth round match on 13 March 1985. This was therefore the second all-seater stadium in England.\n\nThe first English professional football club to convert to all-seats following the watershed of the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster, was Ipswich Town's Portman Road in 1992.\n\nThe other ground often cited as all-seated in Britain before 1990 was Ibrox, home of Rangers. However, although Ibrox had no terracing after the redevelopment which was completed in 1981, there was still a significant standing area in the 'Enclosure', the front portion of the old Main Stand.\n\nSt Johnstone opened the first purpose-built all-seater football stadium in the United Kingdom weeks after the Hillsborough disaster, with the opening of McDiarmid Park in August 1989.\n\nAll-seater stadiums have been compulsory in the English Premiership since the start of the 1994-95 season as a result of the Taylor Report, which gave recommendations to improve stadium safety after the Hillsborough disaster. The initial plan, drawn up in 1990, had recommended that standing areas should be banned from stadiums in the upper two tiers of the league from 1994 onwards, while stadiums in the lower two tiers had until 1999 to meet these requirements. A review of the proposals in 1992 saw non-Premiership and second tier clubs retain the option to have standing areas. From time to time there are calls for Premiership stadiums to be allowed to have standing areas, but these have always been rejected.\n\nThe compulsory introduction of all-seated stadiums in the upper reaches of English football saw the demolition of several famous terraced standing areas which had been iconic throughout the game and famous all over the world. The first such notable casualties were Manchester United's Stretford End and Arsenal's North Bank, both of which were demolished in 1992 to be replaced by new all-seated stands. Two years later, Liverpool demolished their iconic Spion Kop and replaced it with an all-seater stand, while a similar redevelopment occurred with Aston Villa's Holte End.\n\nFIFA, UEFA, and CONCACAF also mandate that all matches in competitions that they control be held in all-seater stadiums. This means that in countries where standing terraces are commonplace, either the stadiums cannot be used at all, or the standing areas must be closed to spectators. Either temporary seats have to be installed (as is the case with Croke Park, home to the Republic of Ireland national team during the Lansdowne Road redevelopment), or the standing areas must be converted to seating (as is the case with several of the larger stadiums in Germany, many of which were used in an all-seater configuration for the 2006 FIFA World Cup).\nMany cricket stadiums in South Africa, New Zealand and Australia are not all seaters, many areas of the ground provide grass banks offering cheaper entry, this means that spectators can sit on the grass. Examples of this include the Adelaide Oval, the WACA Ground in Perth and the Basin Reserve in Wellington.\n\nNorth American stadiums rarely have standing-room terraces; rather, many stadiums have bleacher seating, which are tiered seating areas using flat benches and are usually uncovered. In most large facilities, bleachers are in a relatively small section far from the playing field, and are often referred to as the \"cheap seats\". (In baseball stadiums, generally, the bleachers are often located along the outfield. One example of this is in San Diego, where the only ground-level bleachers are located beyond the right field corner, and others are on the top of a historic building in the left field corner.) Because standing-room terraces are so uncommon, the term \"all-seater\" is not generally used.\n\nWhen standing-room areas do exist, they are generally not sold separately from seats, but rather are provided for spectators who wish to view a portion of the game from a different angle (such as the bullpen area and centerfield terrace at Seattle's Safeco Field), or are admission-free (such as an area at San Francisco's AT&T Park, where the game is visible from a public waterfront walk, through a series of fenced archways which form a part of the outfield wall). Notable exceptions to this are the NFL Washington Redskins' FedExField, which contains a terrace-style standing room only section in the higher areas above each end zone, and the Dallas Cowboys, who sell standing-room tickets for 4 large endzone terraces and smaller terraces located in the corners of AT&T Stadium. The Boston Red Sox baseball team offers standing room tickets when a game is sold out. The Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Tigers both offer standing room only seating. There are no major standing room terraces; rather, people stand along the edges of the concourses directly at the back of the seating areas.\n\n"}
{"id": "2333864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333864", "title": "Poverty in Australia", "text": "Poverty in Australia\n\nPoverty in Australia deals with the incidence of relative poverty in Australia and its measurement. Relative income poverty is measured as a percentage of the population that earns less in comparison to the median wage of the working population.\n\nA study conducted by the Australian Council of Social Service in 2016. It revealed that poverty is growing in Australia, with an estimated 2.9 million people or 13.3% of all people living below the internationally accepted relative poverty line. It also estimated that there are 731,000 children in poverty, and 17.5% of children under the age of 15 are in poverty.\n\nIn 2020 ACOSS released a new report revealing that poverty is growing in Australia, with an estimated 3.2 million people, or 13.6% of the population, living below the internationally accepted poverty line of 50% of a country's median income. It also estimated that there are 774,000 (17.7%) children under the age of 15 that are in poverty.\n\nThe main way of measuring poverty is to set a poverty line and then determine how many people fall below this line. Poverty lines can be set as either absolute poverty lines or relative poverty lines. Australia does not have an official poverty line, either absolute or relative. The 2012 report entitled Poverty in Australia used two poverty lines and also took account of people's housing costs. One poverty line used by the OECD and in this study, referred to half of the middle income for all households, that is, 50% of median household income and the other is 60% of median income.\n\nFirst introduced in 1990, the dollar a day poverty line measured absolute poverty by the standards of the world's poorest countries. The World Bank defined the new international poverty line as $1.25 a day for 2005 (equivalent to $1.00 a day in 1996 US prices). but have recently been updated to be $1.25 and $2.50 per day. Absolute poverty, extreme poverty, or abject poverty is \"a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information. It depends not only on income but also on access to services.\"\n\nThe term 'absolute poverty', when used in this fashion, is usually synonymous with 'extreme poverty': Robert McNamara, the former President of the World Bank, described absolute or extreme poverty as, \"...a condition so limited by malnutrition, illiteracy, disease, squalid surroundings, high infant mortality, and low life expectancy as to be beneath any reasonable definition of human decency\". Australia is one of the world's wealthier nations. In his article published in Australian Policy Online, Robert Tanton notes that, \"While this amount is appropriate for third world countries, in Australia, the amount required to meet these basic needs will naturally be much higher because prices of these basic necessities are higher.\"\n\nHowever, as the amount of wealth required for survival is not the same in all places and time periods, particularly in highly developed countries where few people would fall below the World Bank's poverty lines, countries often develop their own National poverty lines.\n\nAn absolute poverty line was calculated in Australia for the Henderson poverty inquiry in 1973. It was $62.70 a week, which was the disposable income required to support the basic needs of a family of two adults and two dependent children at the time. This poverty line has been updated regularly by the Melbourne Institute according to increases in average incomes; for a single employed person it was $391.85 per week (including housing costs) in March 2009. In Australia the OECD poverty would equate to a \"disposable income of less than $358 per week for a single adult (higher for larger households to take account of their greater costs).\n\nPoverty can also be measured in relative terms, where the poverty line is set as some proportion of the average income or wealth of the society.\n\nThere are many different ways to calculate relative poverty, resulting in different levels of poverty, and researchers often argue about where the line should be drawn. For example, a Smith Family and NATSEM (The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling) report in 2000 indicated as many as 1 in 8 Australians are experiencing poverty. The Centre for Independent Studies (CIS) argues that their research indicates the figure is at least 1 in 12 and could even be as low as 1 in 20. This is because their poverty lines were determined in different ways:\n\nThe problem of these measures is that they focus exclusively on income. But poverty is also defined through other indicators such as education, health, access to services and infrastructure, vulnerability, social exclusion, access to social capital, etc.\n\nThe most widely used indicator to take non-income factors into consideration is the Human Development Index (HDI) compiled yearly by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which combines measure for income, health and education. For advanced economies, the Human Poverty Index (HPI-2) was developed, which takes into consideration the higher levels of income, health and education in these countries. Australia ranks very high on these global indexes.\n\nDuring the first decade of the twenty-first century, the notion of \"the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer\" was increasing in popularity. Often, different conclusions have been reached depending on how relative poverty is measured.\n\nAccording to the Smith Family in 2001:\n\n\nThis report highlighted the relationship between poverty and unemployment with the under-employed facing greater risks of poverty particularly with the increasing casualisation of the workforce.\n\nThe last report, 2006, The UN Human Poverty Index (HPI) for 2006 only has a ranking for 18 of the 21 countries with the highest Human Development Index.\n\nIn the report, Australia is ranked 4th in the OECD, with a HPI of 12.8.\n\nThe value for the 'Population below 50% of median income (%)' for Australia was 14.3% (2.84 Million).\n\nAustralia's child poverty rate falls in the middle of the international rankings. In 2007, UNICEF's report on child poverty in OECD countries revealed that Australia had the 14th highest child poverty rate.\n\nThe child poverty rate is estimated at 0.13 (under 17 years of age) according to OECD statistics (using the median income) from 2013 - 2017. According to ACOSS, children under the age of 15 have a poverty rate of 17.3%, and young people aged 15 to 24 have a rate of 13.9%. They suggest the high poverty rate is related to the high poverty rate among single adults (estimated 25%). This is high compared to the total national poverty rate of 12.8% according to OECD statistics. National Centre For Social And Economic Modeling (NATSEM) suggests another reason for high child poverty rates could be the unavailability of affordable housing for low income adults. They found that 39% of families with children under the age of 15 were presented with unaffordable mortgages, which suggests rising mortgage prices in Australia may be increasing the child poverty rate.\n\nAccording to statistics by the OECD (using median household income), the poverty rates of citizens over 66 are more than double the national average at 0.257. To look at Australia’s elderly poverty rate comparatively, it ranks #4 among the OECD nations, 8 times the lowest ranking of 0.031 for France, the Netherlands, and Denmark. The rate is more comparable to that of other liberal economies, with the US at 0.229 and the UK at 0.142. Although these elderly poverty rates are low, some sources indicate this may be because home ownership is high in Australia among the elderly. For example Australian Bureau of Statistics’ 2009-10 \"Survey of Income and Housing\" indicates that 33% of households own their homes without a mortgage, whereas 36% own a home with a mortgage (that’s 21% of homeowners with a mortgage). This is relevant when compared with the Home-ownership in the United States, where the Washington Post estimates 66% of US homeowners have some type of mortgage. Australia’s high home ownership rates and low mortgage rates may be a factor in determining the wealth of citizens over 66 years of age, not reflected in the elderly poverty rate.\n\nIndigenous and minority groups are sometimes referred to as the \"Fourth World\". They experience a lower life expectancy, higher rates of infant mortality, higher unemployment rates, a lower general standard of living (health, housing), high rates of arrest and imprisonment, plus problems of alcohol and other substance abuses.\n\nAustralian Indigenous people are no exception. In 2000, life expectancy of Indigenous Australians was some 20 years below that of other Australians. All the socioeconomic indicators such as income, employment, housing, education and health show considerable disparities between Australia's Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. In fact, Australian Indigenous poverty ranks alongside countries as poor as Bangladesh where absolute poverty is real.\n\nIn the years following the end of the Second World War, and during Australia's long post-war economic boom, it was widely believed that the introduction of the welfare state together with the emergence of the affluent society had finally put an end to poverty in \"the lucky country\". The mid-to-late Sixties, however, saw a \"rediscovery\" of poverty, as it was found that many Australians had failed to share in the post-war economic boom.\n\nA number of researchers and organisations highlighted the persistence of poverty in Australia. According to one academic in 1960, Helen Hughes, about a third of the half-a-million widows and aged and invalid pensioners in Australia were estimated by social workers to be living in poverty. In 1959, another academic by the name of James Jupp wrote about the \"submerged tenth\" of the Australian population left out of the country's economic prosperity, including Aborigines, shack dwellers, deserted wives, unemployed migrants, slum dwellers, pensioners, and \"no-hopers\". Research into the extent of poverty in Australia was also undertaken by the Victorian and Australian Councils of Social Service, while the church-based welfare agency, the Brotherhood of St. Laurence, carried out a number of studies into the needs of low-income families and pensioners.\n\nIn 1963, a Melbourne university lecturer called Ray Brown estimated that 5% of Australians lived in chronic poverty, with articles published in the radical magazine \"Dissent\" by David Scott, Leon Glezer, and Michael Keating coming to similar conclusions. In 1966 popular awareness of poverty was further extended by the publication of John Stubb's \"The Hidden People\", where he estimated that half-a-million Australians lived in poverty.\n\nHousing conditions also remained underdeveloped for many Australians. A census carried out in 1954 revealed that 49,148 families were living in huts and sheds, while by the end of 1972, more than 1.5 million people in the major cities were living in flats and houses that were not connected to a complete sewerage reticulation system. In 1971, the Institute of Applied Economic Research estimated that at least 1 million Australians lived in poverty. A report by Justice John A. Nimmo from the start of the Seventies estimated that there were about a million Australians living below a miserably poor \"poverty line.\"\n\nLabor parliamentarians provided numerous instances of social and financial deprivation in their own constituencies. As one Labor parliamentarian representing East Sydney asked the Minister for Social Services, Hugh Robinson, to see in May 1964\n\n“if he would like to get up early one morning and go to Paddy's Market or the general City Markets area of Sydney he would see many pensioners going through rubbish heaps to pick out food scraps with which to supplement their meals. You will see pensioners buying second-hand clothing because it is cheap. You will see other pensioners trying on spectacles. Spectacles are not included in social service benefits and the pensioners go to Paddy's Market because glasses may be bought there for one or two shillings a pair. I have seen age pensioners in the market trying sets of false teeth which are sold there. These people go to the market and can be seen standing there actually trying false teeth to see whether they fit. This situation obtains in Australia at present and we should be ashamed of it and so should the Government.\"\n\nOther studies on poverty carried out by the International Labour Office in Geneva also revealed high incidences of poverty in Australia. In 1973, using a national poverty line, it was estimated that 20.8% of Australians lived in poverty before benefits were taken into account, and 11.0% after benefits were taken into account. By contrast, using a standard poverty line, it was estimated that 24.3% of Australians lived in poverty before benefits, and 19.3% after benefits.\n\nOne academic whose work on poverty would galvanise both public and political opinion was that of Professor Ronald Henderson who, together with his fellow researchers from the Melbourne University Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, carried out the \"first systematic attempt to estimate the extent of poverty in Australia\".\n\nIn 1966, Henderson and the Melbourne University Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research which he headed set out to measure the extent of poverty in the city of Melbourne. A poverty line was set at $33, which was close to the basic wage plus child endowment for two children. Based on this figure, 7.7% of all family units in Melbourne lived on or below the poverty line, while an additional 5.2% \"hovered dangerously close to the minimum level\".\n\nA Commission of Inquiry into Poverty was set up in August 1972 by the Liberal Prime Minister William McMahon, and Henderson was appointed as Chairman of the inquiry. The Whitlam Government elected later that year expanded the size of the Commission and scope, giving it specific responsibility to focus on the extent of poverty in Australia together with the groups most at risk of experiencing poverty, the income needs of those living in poverty, and issues relating to housing and welfare services. These issues were addressed in the Commission's first main report, \"Poverty in Australia\", which was released in April 1975.\n\nIn this report, Henderson sought to identify the extent of poverty in Australia in terms of inadequate income relative to need, and the poverty line was defined as a percentage of average earnings, adjusted for household size. The poverty line was set at 56.5% of average earnings for a \"standard\" family (consisting of a male breadwinner, a woman not in paid employment, and two dependent children). According to the report, 8.2% of the population lived in poverty in 1972–73, or 6.4% when housing costs were taken into account. Before housing costs, over 10% of income units in 1972–73 were below the Commission's poverty line, while a further 8% were defined as 'rather poor', having an income of less than 20% above that line. After housing costs were taken into account, the percentage of income units living below the poverty line was about 7%.\n\nThe Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty also estimated that more than 50% of Aborigines had living standards below the poverty line and less than 20% above it. The infant mortality rates among Aborigines in the period 1973–77 were 63 deaths per thousand live births in the Northern Territory and 71 per thousand in Queensland. This compared with a rate of 62 per thousand in South America, 59 per thousand in Africa, 41 per thousand in Central America, 68 per thousand in Asia, and 15 per thousand amongst non-Aboriginal Australians.\n\nFrom a study conducted by the Australian Council of Social Service in 2016. It revealed that poverty is growing in Australia, with an estimated 2.9 million people or 13.3% of all people living below the internationally accepted relative poverty line. It also estimated that there are 731,000 children in poverty, and 17.5% of children under the age of 15 are in poverty.\n\nIn 2020 ACOSS released a new report revealing that poverty is growing in Australia, with an estimated 3.2 million people, or 13.6% of the population, living below the internationally accepted poverty line of 50% of a country's median income. It also estimated that there are 774,000 (17.7%) children under the age of 15 that are in poverty.\n\n\nGeneral:\n"}

In 1949, he was elected to the first Knesset, and served in many ministerial positions for the next 40 years. He was one of the founders of the National Religious Party.\n\nShlomo Yosef Burg was born in Dresden, Germany, on 31 January 1909. He attended the Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary in Berlin from 1928 to 1938, and was ordained as a rabbi that year. He also studied at the University of Berlin from 1928 to 1931, and received a Doctorate in mathematics and logic from the University of Leipzig in 1933.\n\nWhile studying at the University of Leipzig, he joined the Young Mizrahi religious Zionist movement. He arranged Jewish prayer services in private homes after German synagogues were burned, and worked underground to help Jews escape to Britain and the Netherlands. His mother and grandmother died in Nazi concentration camps.\n\nIn 1939, he immigrated to Mandate Palestine. When World War II begun, Burg was stuck in Geneva. He returned thanks to the help of Polish diplomat of Ładoś Group who provided him with a Polish passport. He worked as teacher at the Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium in Tel Aviv before moving to Jerusalem. There he became a research fellow at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Burg lived in the Rehavia neighborhood of Jerusalem.\n\nBurg was married to Rivka Slonim, who was born in Hebron and survived the 1929 Hebron massacre. They had a son, Avraham, a politician who served as speaker of the fifteenth Knesset, and a daughter, Ada, a doctor.\n\nBurg died on 15 October 1999 at the age of 90 at the Sha'arei Tzedek Medical Center.\n\nIn Palestine, Burg joined Hapoel HaMizrachi, a religious-Zionist party. Alongside three other religious parties, Hapoel HaMizrachi ran on a joint list called the United Religious Front for the first Knesset elections in 1949. The group won 16 seats and Burg took a seat in the Knesset, becoming deputy speaker.\n\nIn the 1951 elections the party ran by itself, winning eight seats. Burg remained in the Knesset and became minister of health in the third government. In the fourth, fifth and sixth governments he served as minister of postal services, a position he retained until 1958.\n\nIn 1956 Hapoel HaMizrachi merged with their ideological twins from the Mizrachi party to form the National Religious Party (NRP). The party was a member of all governments until 1992. In 1977, he became the president of the World Mizrachi Movement. As a key party member, Burg maintained a ministerial position in every Knesset until his resignation from the Knesset and retirement from politics in 1986, holding the positions of minister of welfare, minister of internal affairs, minister without portfolio and minister of religious affairs.\n\nBurg was famous for his erudite wit. Journalists dubbed his appearances in parliament \"Burgtheater,\" after the famous playhouse in Vienna.\n\nAccording to Shimon Peres, Burg's most important legacy was trying to bridge the gulf between religious and secular Jews: \"He was a religious man but he believed in compromise.\" Ehud Barak said Burg took the path of moderation and tolerance, and showed a love for Jewish tradition.\n"}

Barajas served as the interim manager for the San Diego Padres after Andy Green's firing on September 21, 2019. As a player in Major League Baseball (MLB), he played for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Texas Rangers, Philadelphia Phillies, Toronto Blue Jays, New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Barajas also played for the Mexico national baseball team.\n\nBarajas was originally signed by the Arizona Diamondbacks as an amateur free agent on December 23, 1996. He was immediately sent to the minor leagues. He played for the Lethbridge Black Diamonds of the Pioneer League (Rk), the lowest level of the minors as a rookie, but excelled, hitting .337 in 51 games. He played his way to the top of the minor leagues in the Diamondbacks' system.\n\nBarajas made his Major League debut for the Diamondbacks on September 25, 1999, against the San Francisco Giants. He was hitless in three at-bats in that game. He hit his first career home run in the last game of the season on October 3, 1999, against the San Diego Padres, a line-drive to left-center field off of Heath Murray. He played in a total of 10 games with the Diamondbacks in 1999 and 2000. He homered twice and did not commit a single error while playing catcher.\n\nBarajas struggled at the plate in 2001, hitting just .160 in 51 games, though he only committed one error while serving as a backup for Damian Miller. He was on the Diamondbacks' World Series roster. In Game 5 of the World Series, he homered off Mike Mussina of the New York Yankees.\n\nBarajas continued to serve as a backup for Miller in 2002. In 70 games, he hit .234 with 3 home runs and 23 RBI. Despite the poor offensive numbers in 2002, Barajas did not commit a single error behind the plate. In 2003, he pulled off similar numbers in 80 games, batting just .218 with 3 home runs and 28 RBI. He became a free agent after the season.\n\nBefore , Barajas had never played more than 80 games, hit more than three home runs, or batted higher than .234 in a full season. In 2004, the Texas Rangers invited him to spring training and he won the backup catcher's job. After starting catcher Gerald Laird was sidelined with a sprained thumb, Barajas took over the starting job with Laird and Danny Ardoin serving as his backups. At the end of the season, he established career highs in games played (108), home runs (15), RBIs (58), and batting average (.249). Barajas also played some first base when needed, compiling ten career games there as a defensive replacement, through the season. In 2005, he hit a career-high 21 Home Runs, serving as the starter once again. In 2006, his numbers dropped significantly and he split time with Laird.\n\nIn November , Barajas was originally going to sign a deal with the Toronto Blue Jays, but he backed out of the deal at the last minute, after switching agents. On December 18, 2006, it was announced that he had reached an agreement with the Philadelphia Phillies for a one-year deal worth less than half of the Blue Jays' offer a month earlier. Barajas claimed he was happy with the new deal and had no regrets. He shared time behind the plate with Carlos Ruiz.\n\nOn October 11, 2007, the Phillies declined his option making him a free agent, and on January 24, , Barajas signed a deal with the Toronto Blue Jays, the team he backed out of a contract with the previous off-season, this time as the backup to incumbent catcher Gregg Zaun. Zaun had signed a two-year deal with the team only after negotiations with Barajas fell apart. Blue Jays general manager J.P. Ricciardi said he had no hard feelings towards Barajas. Zaun was supposed to be the starting catcher, but due to his poor offensive numbers and overall difficulties, manager Cito Gaston made Barajas the starter after he took over for John Gibbons. He took over the starting catching job from Gregg Zaun, and continued in that role in 2009. He finished the 2008 season batting .249 with 11 home runs, 49 RBIs, a .294 on-base percentage, and a .410 slugging percentage over 104 games.\n\nBarajas finished the 2009 season batting .226 in 125 games with 19 home runs and a career high 71 RBI.\n\nOn February 24, 2010, Barajas signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the New York Mets and was named the opening day catcher. On May 7, 2010, he hit the first walk-off home run in the history of Citi Field, giving him three multi home run games in his first five weeks as a Met. Barajas became the first Met catcher to hit 12 or more home runs since Mike Piazza's last year with the Mets in 2005.\n\nOn August 22, 2010, Barajas was claimed off waivers by the Los Angeles Dodgers and acquired for cash considerations.\n\nIn his first game with Los Angeles against the Milwaukee Brewers, Barajas hit two doubles and a three-run home run. Barajas became the first Dodger to hit three extra-base hits in his first game with the club. In his first home game in Dodger Stadium, Barajas hit a home run in the fifth inning.\n\nBarajas appeared in 25 games with the Dodgers in 2010, hitting .297 with 5 home runs and 13 RBI. On December 3, 2010, he re-signed with the Dodgers on a one-year deal for 2011.\n\nIn 2011, he played in 98 games with the Dodgers, hitting .230 with 16 home runs and 47 RBI. He became a free agent after the season.\n\nOn November 10, 2011, Barajas signed a one-year contract with a club option for 2013 with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates declined his 2013 option on October 31, 2012.\n\nOn February 8, 2013, Barajas signed a minor-league deal with the Diamondbacks., but the Diamondbacks released him on March 25.\n\nBefore the 2014 season, Barajas was named manager of the Arizona League Padres.\nBarajas replaced Jamie Quirk as the manager of the San Antonio Missions on June 17, 2015, after Quirk was promoted to coach at Triple-A El Paso. Because the game was postponed by rain, his debut occurred with a double-header on June 18 against the Midland RockHounds.\n\nHe was later the manager for the El Paso Chihuahuas AAA baseball team.\n\nIn October 2018, he was named as the bench coach for the San Diego Padres. On September 21, 2019, Barajas was named the interim manager for the Padres following the team's firing of Andy Green. He was named the Padres catching and quality control coach prior to the 2020 season.\n\nBarajas is of Mexican descent. His mother and father are from Michoacán and Baja California, respectively. He and his wife Stacie have four sons, Andrew, Bryce, Rod Jr. and Jace, and three daughters, Aunalilia, Aubrielle, and Starlette.\nRod attended Santa Fe High School, Santa Fe Springs, California and Cerritos Community College.

{"id": "2333910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333910", "title": "French pronouns", "text": "French pronouns\n\nFrench pronouns are inflected to indicate their role in the sentence (subject, direct object, and so on), as well as to reflect the person, gender, and number of their referents.\n\nFrench has a complex system of personal pronouns (analogous to English \"I\", \"we\", \"they\", and so on). When compared to English, the particularities of French personal pronouns include:\n\nPossessive pronouns refer to an object (or person) by identifying its possessor. They lexically indicate the person and number of the possessor, and like other pronouns they are inflected to indicate the gender and number of their referent. This is a key difference from English: in English, possessive pronouns are inflected to indicate the gender and number of their antecedent — e.g., in \"the tables are his\", the form \"his\" indicates that the antecedent (the possessor) is masculine singular, whereas in the French \"les tables sont les siennes\", \"siennes\" or its base form \"sien\" indicates that the antecedent is third person singular but of unspecified gender while the inflection \"-nes\" indicates that the possessed noun \"table\" is feminine plural. \n\nIn French, the possessive pronouns are determined by the definite article \"le\", \"la\", \"les\" (\"the\"), depending on the gender and number of their referent; nonetheless, they are considered pronouns.\n\nThe following table lists the possessive pronouns by the possessor they indicate:\n\nExamples:\n\nThe term \"possessive pronoun\" is also sometimes applied to the possessive determiners (\"my\", \"your\", etc.), which are discussed at \"French articles and determiners\".\n\nLike English, French has a number of different interrogative pronouns. They are organized here by the English pronoun to which they correspond:\n\n\nFor more information on the formation of questions, see \"French grammar\".\n\nFrench, like English, uses relative pronouns to introduce relative clauses. The relative pronoun used depends on its grammatical role (such as subject or direct object) within the relative clause, as well as on the gender and number of the antecedent and whether the antecedent represents a human. Further, like English, French distinguishes between ordinary relative clauses (which serve as adjectives) and other types.\n\nIf the relative pronoun is to be the subject of the clause's verb, \"qui\" is ordinarily used: « l'homme qui a volé ma bicyclette » (\"the man who stole my bike\"). Note that \"qui\" in this use does not change form to agree in any way with its antecedent: « les bicyclettes qui ont été volées » (\"the bikes that were stolen\"). However, it may occasionally be replaced with a form of \"lequel\" to specify the antecedent's gender or number. For example, while the phrase « Jean et Marie, qui vole(nt) des bicyclettes » (\"Jean and Marie, who steal(s) bicycles\") is ambiguous in speech (since \"vole\" and \"volent\" are homophones), the phrases « Jean et Marie, laquelle vole des bicyclettes » (\"Jean and Marie, who steals bicycles\") and « Jean et Marie, lesquels volent des bicyclettes » (\"Jean and Marie, who steal bicycles\") are not: in the former, only Marie is being described, while in the latter, both Jean and Marie are. This substitution is very rare, however.\n\nIf the relative pronoun is to be the direct object of the clause's verb, \"que\" (or \"qu'\" before a vowel; \"see\" elision) is ordinarily used: « la bicyclette qu'il a volée » (\"the bicycle that he stole\"). Like \"qui\", \"que\" does not change form to agree with its antecedent, and may occasionally be replaced with a form of \"lequel\" for the sake of clarity.\n\nIf the relative pronoun is to be the grammatical possessor of a noun in the clause (usually marked with \"de\"), \"dont\" is used: « le garçon dont j'ai volé la bicyclette » (\"the boy from whom I stole the bicycle\", \"the boy whose bicycle I stole\"). Note that unlike in English, the object of possession is not moved to appear immediately after \"dont\"; that is, \"dont\", unlike \"whose\", is not a determiner.\n\nTraditionally, if the relative pronoun was to be the object of a preposition in the clause (other than the \"de\" of possession), or the indirect object of the clause's verb, a form of \"lequel\" was used, with the preposition placed before it: « la femme de laquelle j'ai parlé » (\"the woman about whom I spoke\"). (Note that here, as in the interrogative case described above, \"à\" and \"de\" contract with most forms of \"lequel\".) Nowadays, the form of \"lequel\" is typically replaced with \"qui\" when the antecedent is a human: « la femme de qui j'ai parlé ». Further, if the preposition is \"de\", even if it is not the \"de\" of the possession, \"dont\" has started to be used (with both human and non-human antecedents): « la femme dont j'ai parlé ». (However, \"dont\" has \"not\" started to be used in the case of compound prepositions ending in \"de\", such as \"à côté de\", \"loin de\", and \"à cause de\": « la femme à cause de laquelle j'ai parlé », \"the woman because of whom I spoke\").\n\nAlternatively, if the relative pronoun is to be an adverbial complement in the clause, introduced by the preposition \"à\" (or a similar preposition of time or place), \"où\" may be used: « la ville où j'habite » (\"the city where I live\"), « au moment où il a parlé » (\"at the moment that he spoke\").\n\nWhen a relative clause is to serve as an inanimate noun, it is prefixed with \"ce\": « ce que j'ai dit » (\"that which I said\", \"what I said\"). In a prepositional phrase after \"ce\", the pronoun \"lequel\" is replaced with the pronoun \"quoi\": « ce à quoi je pense » (\"that about which I am thinking\", \"what I am thinking about\"; note the non-contraction of \"ce\"), except that \"ce dont\" is usually preferred to \"ce de quoi\" ( both meaning \"that of which\"). \n\nWhen a relative clause serves as an animate noun usually a construction like « l'homme qui ... » (\"the man who ...\") is used, rather than a \"he who\" construction. However, \"qui\" is sometimes used alone: « Qui vivra, verra » (\"Whoever lives, will see\" \"He who lives, will see\").\n\nWhen a relative clause is to serve as an adverb, it takes the same form as when it is to serve as an inanimate noun, except that \"ce\" is omitted before a preposition: « Ils sont allés dîner, après quoi ils sont rentrés » (\"They went out to eat, after which they went home\"); « Ils ne se sont pas du tout parlé, ce qui me semblait étrange » (\"They did not talk to each other at all, which seemed strange to me\").\n\nFrench has several demonstrative pronouns. The pronouns \"ceci\" and \"cela\" / \"ça\" correspond roughly to English \"this\" and \"that\"; the pronoun \"celui\" corresponds to English \"this one, that one; the one (which)\". The major reason why there is confusion by native English speakers is that \"this\" and \"that\" are also used in English as demonstrative adjectives that correspond to the single French demonstrative adjectives \"ce\" ‘this; that’ (declined as: \"cet\" m. before vowels, \"cette\" f. and \"ces\" m.pl.).\n\n\"Ceci\" and \"cela\" correspond roughly to English \"this\" and \"that,\" respectively. \"Ça\" is a truncated form of \"cela\", used in standard spoken contexts. Unlike English \"this\", French \"ceci\" is quite rare; its most common use is in writing, to refer to something that is about to be mentioned: « Ceci est le problème : il boit trop. » (\"This is the problem: he drinks too much.\") \"Cela\" and \"ça\" are often used even when English would use \"this.\"\n\n\"Celui\" corresponds to English \"the one,\" \"this one,\" and \"that one.\" Since its purpose is to identify (\"demonstrate\") its referent, it is always accompanied by additional identifying information.\n\nLike other pronouns, \"celui\" is inflected to agree with its antecedent in gender and number. Its forms are as follows:\nAs mentioned above, the demonstrative pronoun is always accompanied by additional identifying information. This information can come in any of the following forms:\n"}

They recruited former Pale Saints, Parachute Men and Rialto member Colleen Browne on bass guitar 1995-1997. She was replaced by Aki Shibahara.\n\nAfter the release of their debut EP \"Autopia\" the band received positive press and played prestigious support slots and festival appearances, including an arena tour with Blur. The band appeared on NME's annual tour of up and coming bands in early 1998.\n\nTheir only album, \"Future Signs\", was released in 1998, mixed by Glyn Johns. The band had top forty hits in Britain with \"Never Never\" and \"Hurricane\".\n\nThe band had some tabloid fame when singer Louis Jones had a relationship with DJ Zoë Ball. They were also often namechecked by Jones's friend and media buddy Paul Kaye under his Dennis Pennis alter ego.\n\nPaul Noble left the band.

Over time the feldspar and mica have been removed from the rock, leaving almost pure quartz. Even on the hottest days, the sand is so reflective that it feels cool underfoot. According to Harvard University geologists, it's estimated that the sand on Siesta Beach and Crescent Beach on Siesta Key is millions of years old, having its origin in the Appalachians and flowing down the rivers from the mountains until it eventually was deposited on the shores of Siesta Key.\n\nThe southern portion of Siesta Beach is alternatively called Crescent Beach, which extends to the sea wall and Point of Rocks, an area with coral and active marine life.\n\nSiesta Beach is not only long, but also expansively wide, especially around the Siesta Key Beach Pavilion section. The beach is so wide the city installed walking mats to help beachgoers get to the shore, where they can then walk on firmer wet sand.\n\nUp until the 20th century, Siesta Key was virtually vacant and was referred to as Clam Island, Little Sarasota Island, or Sarasota Key. The Island was not connected to the city of Sarasota in any way, so the only way to get to and from the island was by boat. It had deep vegetation, snakes of all varieties (including all of the venomous ones found in the United States - rattlesnakes, copperheads, water moccasins and coral snakes), sand fleas, wildcats and wild boars.\n\nIt remained that way until 1906 when Mr. and Mrs. Roberts opened the Roberts’ (or Siesta) Inn. This hotel became very popular for people who wanted a place to escape the cold winters of the north. The Roberts’ Inn also attracted many people because of Mrs. Roberts’ cooking (specifically her seafood dishes). Mr. Roberts teamed up with Mayor Harry Higel to create the Siesta Land Company, which formed Siesta Village and renamed the island Siesta Key around a year after he opened his hotel. In 1914, Higel opened his own hotel called Higelhurst and used his boat to transfer guests to and from the city. Higel also worked to get the Army Corps Engineers to build a bridge that would connect the key with the city of Sarasota. He was finally able to, and that bridge opened in 1917, which connected the northern part of the key with the city. In 1927, a second bridge opened at the southern end of the key on Stickney Point.\n\nIn 1954, Sarasota County first purchased property on the key for a public beach. Slowly, Siesta Key began to grow in population, and now around 350,000 tourists visit it every year.\n\nIn 2018 the beaches were impacted by \"Karenia brevis\", an algae drift known as red tide. Several tons of dead fish washed ashore on the beach at various times, most of which were removed in the early morning hours by the truckload. The toxins from red tide cause respiratory discomfort to humans, in addition to killing fish, turtles, and manatees. In the past, the cycle of red tide has lasted up to eighteen months.\n\n"}

It was originally intended for the education of King Magnus Lagabøte, the son of King Håkon Håkonsson, and it has the form of a dialogue between father and son. The son asks, and is advised by his father about practical and moral matters, concerning trade, the hird, chivalric behavior, strategy and tactics. Parts of \"Konungs skuggsjá\" deals with the relationship between church and state.\n\nA study of the relations of the text's manuscripts was undertaken by Ludvig Holm-Olsen, underpinning his 1983 edition, which is presently the standard one. The most important manuscript is AM 243 a fol., copied in Norway (probably Bergen), around 1275.\n\nThe seventy chapters of the text consist of a prologue and two main parts, of which the second may perhaps be subdivided into two sections, one focused on the king's court, the other (more specifically) on the king's justice. In the prologue, the speaker sets out to deal with merchants, kingsmen, the clergy and peasants, but his discussion does not extend much beyond the first two classes.

The true number of the Satyrinae species is estimated to exceed 2400.\n\nThey are generally weak fliers and often shun bright sunlight, preferring moist and semishaded habitats. The caterpillars feed chiefly on monocotyledonous plants such as palms, grasses, and bamboos.

Their name derives from Arabic \"bahman\", \"root,\" as each was considered a source of astrological power for one or more planets. Each is also connected with a gemstone and plant that would be used in rituals meant to draw the star's influence (e.g., into a talisman). When a planet was within six degrees of an associated star, this influence was thought to be particularly strong.\n\nHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa discussed them in his \"Three Books of Occult Philosophy\" (Book II, chapters 47 & 52) as the \"Behenii\" (singular \"Behenius\"), describing their magical workings and kabbalistic symbols. He attributed these to Hermes Trismegistus, as was common with occult traditions in the Middle Ages. Their true origin remains unknown, though Sir Wallis Budge suspects a possible Sumerian source.\n\nThe following table uses symbols from a 1531 quarto edition of Agrippa, but other forms exist. Where the name used in old texts differs from the one in use today, the modern form is given first.\n\n These locations are given in celestial longitude, the relatively fixed reference frame of tropical signs used in astrology and are derived from the measurements listed at Constellations of Words. Due to Precession of the Equinoxes the Fixed Stars appear to drift or move through space at the rate of 1 degree of Arc per 72 years. In order to fix the measurement to a specific date and degree of arc the values published through that scholarly work are utilized for the year 2000. All celestial bodies, including stars and constellations, are measured according to various fixed frameworks, in this instance a geocentric tropical zodiac. Cf. Heliocentric model as a fixed framework and sidereal and tropical astrology to identify the measuring system used here. For example, 26 Taurus 10 means 26 degrees 10 minutes of the tropical sign Taurus. See Ecliptic coordinate system for further information.\n\n\n"}

The most famous film produced by him remains the Shekhar Kapur directed sci-fi film \"Mr India\" starring Anil Kapoor and Sridevi. It was the second biggest hit of 1987 and remains a cult classic in India. The film was known for several of its lines and songs, including Sridevi's \"Miss Hawa Hawaii\" performance and Amrish Puri's quote \"Mogambo khush hua\" (Mogambo is pleased), which is one of the most famous quotes of Bollywood and has become synonymous with Puri.

Boney Kapoor also launched many big stars of the Hindi film industry. His production \"Woh Saat Din\" launched brother Anil Kapoor, \"Prem\" launched younger brother Sanjay Kapoor and Tabu, and \"Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe\" launched actress Esha Deol. He is considered one of the most lavish producers of Bollywood who produced one of the most expensive films in the history of Hindi cinema: \"Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja\" in 1993.

Graphical and other improvements included tire smoke when landing or skidding, runway taxi-way lighting, the Air Combat Command insignia on most U.S. aircraft, increased number of polygons (making objects appear much more round than they appeared in \"A-10 Attack!\"), and weapon damage was significantly upgraded (increased realism) and ground vehicle physics were more realistic.

{"id": "2333976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333976", "title": "Atwater v. City of Lago Vista", "text": "Atwater v. City of Lago Vista\n\nAtwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U.S. 318 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court decision which held that a person's Fourth Amendment rights are not violated when the subject is arrested for driving without a seatbelt. The court ruled that such an arrest for a misdemeanor that is punishable only by a fine does not constitute an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nTexas law provides for police officer discretion in arresting any person caught committing a misdemeanor, such as violating its mandatory seat belt laws. Violation of its seat belt law in 1999 was punishable with the maximum fine of $50. In March 1997, Gail Atwater, a long-term resident of Lago Vista, Texas, was driving her pick-up truck with her three-year-old son and five-year-old daughter from soccer practice. One of the children had lost a toy and she allowed them to unbuckle their seat belts to stand to search for the toy; hence, none of them were wearing their seat belts. Police officer Bart Turek, then with the city of Lago Vista, recognized Ms. Atwater and pulled her over. According to court records, witnesses observed that Atwater and her children remained in her pick up when Turek approached the driver's side window and aggressively jabbed his finger toward Atwater's face. According to Atwater's complaint (allegations, previously supported by witnesses at the scene, that the court also presumed to be true for its purposes), Turek screamed at Atwater about the seatbelts, frightening her children. When Atwater calmly and in a normal tone requested that Turek lower his voice. Turek immediately yelled \"you’re going to jail.\" According to the record, Atwater remained calm when Turek told her she was going to jail. She did not act suspiciously, she did not pose any threat to Turek, and she did not engage in any illegal conduct other than failing to wear a seat belt. Turek continued to verbally abuse Atwater, accusing her of not caring for her children. Atwater's children and bystanders, including friends and other Lago Vista residents who drove or walked by, witnessed Turek's tirade.\n\nAfter telling Atwater that she would be taken to jail, Turek demanded her driver's license and proof of insurance. When Atwater informed Turek that her license and insurance card were in her purse that had been stolen a couple of days before, Turek told Atwater that he had \"heard that story two-hundred times.\" Atwater provided her address from her checkbook. Atwater then asked Turek to allow her to take her \"frightened, upset, and crying\" children to a friend's home just two houses down before taking her to jail, but he refused her request. Turek told her \"[y]ou're not going anywhere\" and stated that her children could accompany her to the police station. A friend of Atwater's who came to the scene took the children into her care while the officer arrested Atwater. Turek handcuffed Atwater, in front of her two young children, placed her in his squad car, did not fasten her seat belt, and drove her to the police station to be booked. According to the court document, \"booking officers had her remove her shoes, jewelry, and eyeglasses, and empty her pockets. Officers took Atwater's 'mug shot' and placed her alone in a jail cell for about one hour.\" A magistrate released Atwater on $310 bond. She later paid three $50 fines for each violation of Texas's seat belt law (one for her and each of her children). The charges of driving without a license and without proof of insurance were dismissed.\n\nAtwater and her husband, Michael Haas, an emergency room physician at a local hospital, filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, represented by Charles Lincoln, alleging that the city violated her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures by arresting her for a crime whose only punishment was a fine. This argument required her to concede that the police had probable cause to arrest her for violating the seat belt law, and thus the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas found summary judgment for the city. A panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that arresting a person for a fine-only misdemeanor was per se unreasonable. The Fifth Circuit sitting en banc reversed the panel, agreeing with the district court's reasoning. Three judges dissented from the en banc panel's ruling, arguing that the police had to have a specific reason for arresting Atwater for only violating the seat belt law. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.\n\nThe court started by analyzing and rejecting Atwater's argument that the common law did not grant authority to police officers to execute warrantless arrests for misdemeanors that did not involve a breach of the peace. The court, recognizing the lack of unanimity of a common law rule, found that the historical common law had a \"decided, majority view that the police did not need to obtain an arrest warrant merely because a misdemeanor stopped short of violence or threat of it\" and hence the argument had failed.\n\nThe majority conceded that \"If we were to derive a rule exclusively to address the uncontested facts of this case, Atwater might well prevail.\" The majority also acknowledged specific directness in its actual opinion, \"suggesting that courts look with 'disfavor' on such legislative enactments 'as interfering with the constitutional liberties of the subject'.\" Furthermore, the majority decision concluded that \"warrantless misdemeanor arrests [may not] need constitutional attention,\" and that \"It is of course easier to devise a minor-offense limitation by statute than to derive one through the Constitution\" Thus, the court rejected adopting a new Constitutional law rule by focusing on administrability concerns. It then held that probable cause was the issue and that the standard had been met.\n\nThe Court held officer \"Turek was authorized (though not required) to make a custodial arrest without balancing costs and benefits or determining whether Atwater's arrest was in some sense necessary.\" \"Atwater v. City of Lago Vista\", 532 U.S. 318, 322.\nIn \"Wilson v. Arkansas\", , the Court considered whether the Fourth Amendment required the police to knock first and announce their presence before entering a person's home. To decide that issue, the Court deemed it necessary to examine whether the common law required the police to knock and announce their presence. The Court's analysis in this case proceeded along similar lines. Atwater claimed that the Framers of the Fourth Amendment understood an \"unreasonable\" seizure to include a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor offense that was not a \"breach of the peace.\" The Court examined the historical evidence of practice in England during the Middle Ages and in the 17th and 18th centuries and in America from the time of the ratification of the Bill of Rights to modern times. Though the Court did find some evidence favoring Atwater's position, it determined that much of the historical precedent contradicted her argument. In the end, the Court's common law analysis supported the proposition that a police officer could arrest any person for a misdemeanor committed in his or her presence.\n\nAtwater had urged the Court to adopt a \"bright-line\" rule that the police not arrest anyone for an offense that did not carry jail time unless the government could show a compelling need to detain the person. At first blush, the Court conceded, this rule appeared easily administrable by police officers, which would serve the government's interest in rules that are easy to apply on the spot. But in thinking through many possible applications of the rule Atwater proposed, the Court found it more difficult to apply. Court opinion stated that it is not reasonable to expect the average police officer to know the details of \"frequently complex penalty schemes,\" especially since the penalty associated with seemingly identical conduct can vary with the facts that are difficult to discern at the scene of a crime, such as whether the suspect is a repeat offender or the weight of drugs. Furthermore, even if the officer could make that distinction on the spot, he could not know how the district attorney will later choose to charge the offense.\n\nPolice routinely exercise discretion in their work. Requiring the police to decide whether a crime is a fine-only crime, for which he could not arrest the suspect, in the heat of the moment ultimately exposes the police to greater legal consequences—either exclusion of illegally obtained evidence, or personal liability for violating the suspect's constitutional rights. Balancing of Fourth Amendment interests through \"probable cause\" and \"extraordinary\" circumstances has been delineated in \"Terry v. Ohio\", . Given the choice to abandon or abridge the requirement of probable cause for arrest in the case of fine-only misdemeanors, the Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment imposed the same standard for all crimes: probable cause.\n\nThe Court's decision in this case ultimately involved the extent of law-enforcement discretion in exercising their duties. After asking in oral argument, \"how bad the problem is out there?\" the court admonished Atwater's counsel's failure to provide it with \"indications of comparably foolish, warrantless misdemeanor arrests.\" The majority opinion ultimately emphasized a specific view that \"Multiplied many times over, the costs to society of such underenforcement could easily outweigh the costs to defendants of being needlessly arrested and booked.\"\n\nJustice O'Connor, presenting the (4-5) dissenting opinion, stated that the historical evidence was not uniform in rejecting Atwater's proposed rule and reasoned that the Fourth Amendment required a balancing of interests in the case of an arrest for a fine-only misdemeanor. The court dissent in Atwater precluded the sole use of probable cause in \"Whren v. United States\", , where the Court had held that, on balance, it was reasonable to allow the police to make a traffic stop whenever they spied a violation of the traffic laws, although a traffic stop was a seizure. But, because of the length of the typical traffic stop and the fact that most drivers are free to go after it is done, such a seizure was commensurate with the magnitude of the violation and sufficient to ensure that the offender would appear later in court if necessary. The dissent elucidated, “probable cause” and “extraordinary” circumstances as delineated in Terry v. Ohio, Whren v. United States, etc., have also proved less than problematic. Strong argument to the contrary also remains as to the merit of the majority opinion that “personal § 1983 liability for the misapplication of a constitutional standard…would guarantee increased litigation.” In Atwater, the dissent further argued that Atwater could not have been characterized as a possible flight risk by the arresting officer, since she was known to him and was an established member of the community and that respondents failed to substantiate any demonstrable merit for the arrest decision. They further noted that arrest for a fine-only misdemeanor was not reasonable because sending someone to jail for up to 48 hours (the time necessary to get him or her before a magistrate to be released) was too great an intrusion upon the personal liberty interests of anyone who had committed a relatively minor offense as would only merit such a fine as punishment.\n\nThe Atwater dissenting court opinion states, “A broad range of conduct falls into the category of fine-only misdemeanors... Such unbounded discretion [given to law enforcement] carries with it grave potential for abuse. The majority takes comfort in the lack of evidence of ‘an epidemic of unnecessary minor-offense arrests’.\" Reasoning beyond the case of a misdemeanor arrest for a seat-belt-law violation, Justice O'Connor’s dissenting court opinion further cautions, “The Court’s error, however, does not merely affect disposition of this case. The per se rule that the Court creates has potentially serious consequences for the everyday lives of Americans.” Justice O'Connor concludes the court's minority's dissent by stating, “The Court neglects the Fourth Amendment’s express command in the name of administrative ease. In so doing, it cloaks the pointless indignity that Gail Atwater (and her children) suffered with the mantle of reasonableness.”\n\nAlong with the power to make a custodial arrest for any misdemeanor traffic offense, officers have the Constitutional authority to make a suspicionless search of any person incident to a custodial arrest.\n\nHowever, the potential for a warrantless search of a vehicle incident to such misdemeanor arrests—combining the holdings of \"Atwater\" and \"New York v. Belton\"—has since been limited by \"Arizona v. Gant\".\n\n\"Gant\" limited searches incident to arrest to circumstances where it is reasonable to believe that: 1) the arrested individual might access the vehicle at the time of the search; or 2) the arrested individual's vehicle contains evidence of the offense that led to the arrest. The Court suggested in dictum that \"when a recent occupant is arrested for a traffic violation, there will be no reasonable basis to believe the vehicle contains relevant evidence.\"\n\n\n"}

He was First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff in the late 1970s and in that role he worked hard to secure a decent wage for servicemen and helped win them a 32% pay rise. He went on to be Chief of the Defence Staff during the Falklands War, serving as chief war planner and as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's chief advisor during the war. He was also the first Chief of Defence Staff to act as head of the Armed Forces rather than just Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee.\n\nBorn the son of Eric Lewin and Maggie Lewin (née Falconer) and educated at The Judd School in Tonbridge, where he was head prefect in 1938, Lewin joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1939.

He served with distinction being mentioned in despatches three times and being awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1942 for saving the lives of many fellow servicemen when the destroyer was hit by a torpedo.\n\nLewin attended the gunnery school at in Spring 1945 and then joined the staff there in May 1945. He was posted to the cruiser as gunnery officer in April 1946 and, after attending the advanced gunnery course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in 1947, he returned to the staff at HMS \"Excellent\" in December. Promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 July 1949, he became gunnery officer of the First Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet. He rejoined the staff of HMS Excellent in January 1952 and, having been promoted to commander on 31 December 1952, he joined the staff of the Second Sea Lord at the Admiralty in December 1953.\n\nLewin was given command of the destroyer in October 1955 and then of HM Yacht \"Britannia\" in April 1957, before being promoted to captain on 30 June 1958.

He graduated from Kansas State Agricultural College in 1886, and thereafter worked as an instructor at the college for two years. In 1889, he enlisted in the United States Army. On July 31, 1891, he received a commission with the Fifth Cavalry.\n\nHarbord's first overseas experience came as a member of the occupation army in Cuba after the Spanish–American War. On January 21, 1899, during an extended leave, he married Emma Yeatman Overshine, daughter of brigadier General Samuel Ovenshine. In 1901, he was promoted to captain and transferred from Cuba, where he has served initially as quartermaster and commissary for the 10th Cavalry Regiment, and later as aide-de-camp and adjutant-general of the department of Santiago and Puerto Principe.\n\nAfter serving briefly in the Secretary of War office, he requested and received transfer to duty in the Philippines with the 11th Cavalry Regiment. He then served as Assistant Chief of the Philippine Constabulary from 1903 to 1909 and again from 1910 through 1913. By late April 1914 he was commanding the unit defending the California border at Calexico. In 1916, he was on the Mexican border with brigadier general John J. Pershing, pursuing Pancho Villa.\n\nWhen the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Harbord went to France as Pershing's chief of staff, which won him a promotion to brigadier general. Throughout the war he continued to work closely with Pershing, now the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) on the Western Front. In June 1918, he was succeeded by James W. McAndrew as AEF chief of staff, and assigned to command of the 4th Marine Brigade, which was serving as part of the 2nd Infantry Division, and then on July 15, briefly given command of the division itself. He commanded the U.S. Marines during the Battle of Château-Thierry and the Battle of Belleau Wood. \nAfter generals Richard Blatchford and his replacement, Francis Kernan, had failed to organize an adequate delivery of supplies to the US troops in France, John J. Pershing asked Harbord in August 1918 to take the job. Harbord introduced several reforms to the ″Services of Supply″ (SOS) and achieved almost instant improvements. Pershings trust in Harbord went so far, that Jim Lacey wrote in his Pershing biography \"if a problem were outside Harbord's ability to solve, it was not solvable by mortal man\".\n\nFollowing the war, he was promoted to major general and was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal.\n\nIn August 1919, President Woodrow Wilson sent a fact-finding mission to the Middle East, headed by Harbord, to investigate the feasibility of the Balfour Declaration, which supported the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine, taken from the Ottoman Empire during the war. Harbord was also to report on Turkish–Armenian relations in the wake of the Armenian Genocide. Upon returning to the United States, Harbord wrote the \"Conditions in the Near East: Report of the American Military Mission to Armenia\", which was a summary of the expedition that provided various details of the mission. The report includes maps, statistics, and a historical analyses of the country and its population. In addition to such details, Harbord collected evidence and information regarding the massacres of Armenians. Harbord's report stated that \"the temptation to reprisals for past wrongs\" would make it extremely difficult to maintain peace in the region. The final conclusion of the report was the inclusion of Armenia in the possible American mandate for Asia Minor and Rumelia since a mandate for Armenia alone was not deemed feasible under these conditions.\n\nIn 1922, Harbord retired from the Army to become President of the Radio Corporation of America. While Harbord was President of RCA, the corporation undertook a number of significant moves. In 1926, RCA began television broadcasts and formed NBC. In 1928, RCA was one of four corporations that jointly formed RKO Pictures. Finally, in 1929, RCA acquired the Victor Talking Machine Company (maker of the famous \"Victrola\") and became RCA-Victor.\n\nIn 1928, Harbord took a leave of absence to campaign for Herbert Hoover for President, and in 1930 he officially retired from the position, allowing David Sarnoff to assume the office.\n\nHarbord remained as Chairman of the Board for RCA until 1947.\n\nIn 1942, the U.S. Congress passed legislation allowing retired Army generals to be advanced one rank on the retired list or posthumously if they had been recommended in writing during World War I for a promotion which they did not receive, and if they had received the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross or the Distinguished Service Medal. Under these criteria, Harbord and William M. Wright were eligible for promotion to lieutenant general, and they were advanced on the retired list effective July 9, 1942.\n\nHarbord died in Rye, New York on August 20, 1947. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a chambered, gas-filled shell used for buoyancy control; its siphuncle is highly modified and is on the ventral side of the shell. The microscopic structure of cuttlebone consists of narrow layers connected by numerous upright pillars. \n\nDepending on the species, cuttlebones implode at a depth of . Because of this limitation, most species of cuttlefish live on the seafloor in shallow water, usually on the continental shelf. \n\nThe largest cuttlebone belongs to \"Sepia apama\", the giant Australian cuttlefish, which lives between the surface and a maximum depth of 100 metres.\n\nIn the past, cuttlebones were ground up to make polishing powder, which was used by goldsmiths. The powder was also added to toothpaste, and was used as an antacid for medicinal purposes or as an absorbent. They were also used as an artistic carving medium during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nToday, cuttlebones are commonly used as calcium-rich dietary supplements for caged birds, chinchillas, hermit crabs, reptiles, shrimp, and snails.

Then the casting can be done by carving a design into the cuttlebone, adding the necessary sprue, melting the metal in a separate pouring crucible, and pouring the molten metal into the mold through the sprue. Finally, the sprue is sawed off and the finished piece is polished.\n\n\n"}

Moise Amyraut, professor at Saumur, taught that the atonement of Jesus was hypothetically universal rather than particular and definite. His colleague, Louis Cappel, denied the verbal inspiration of the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, and Josué de la Place rejected the immediate imputation of Adam's sin as arbitrary and unjust.\n\nThe famous and flourishing school of Saumur came to be looked upon with increasing mistrust as the seat of heterodoxy, especially by the Swiss, who were in the habit of sending students there. The first impulse to attack the new doctrine came from Geneva, seat of historical Calvinism. In 1635 Friedrich Spanheim wrote against Amyraut, whom the clergy of Paris tried to defend. In course of time Amyraldism gained ground in Geneva. In 1649, Alexander Morus, the successor of Spanheim, but suspected of belonging to the liberal party, was compelled by the magistrates of Geneva to subscribe to a series of articles in the form of theses and antitheses, the first germ of the Formula consensus. His place was taken by Philippe Mestrezat, and later by Louis Tronchin (), both inclined toward the liberal tendency of France, while Francis Turretin defended the traditional system. Mestrezat induced the Council of Geneva to take a moderate stand point in the article on election, but the other cantons of Switzerland objected to this new tendency and threatened to stop sending their pupils to Geneva.\n\nThe Council of Geneva submitted and peremptorily demanded from all candidates subscription to the older articles. But the conservative elements were not satisfied, and the idea occurred to them to stop the further spread of such novelties by establishing a formula obligatory upon all teachers and preachers. After considerable discussion between Lucas Gernler of Basel, Hummel of Bern, Ott of Schaffhausen, Johann Heinrich Heidegger of Zurich, and others, the last mentioned was charged with drawing up the formula. In the beginning of 1675, Heidegger's Latin draft was communicated to the ministers of Zurich; and in the course of the year it received very general adoption, and almost everywhere was added as an appendix and exposition to the Helvetic Confession.\n\nThe Consensus consists of a preface and twenty-five canons, and states clearly the difference between strict Calvinism and the school of Saumur.\n\nAlthough the Helvetic Consensus was introduced everywhere in the Reformed Church of Switzerland, it did not long hold its position. At first, circumspection and tolerance were shown at the enforcement of its signature, but as soon as many French preachers sought positions in Vaud after the revocation of the edict of Nantes, it was ordered that all who intended to preach must sign the Consensus without reservation. An address of the Great Elector of Brandenburg to the Reformed cantons, in which, in consideration of the dangerous position of Protestantism and the need of a union of all Evangelicals, he asked for a nullification of the separating formula, brought it about that the signature was not demanded in Basel after 1686, and it was also dropped in Schaffhausen and later (1706) in Geneva, while Zurich and Bern retained it.\n\nMeanwhile, the whole tendency of the time had changed. Secular science stepped into the foreground. The practical, ethical side of Christianity began to gain a dominating influence. Rationalism and Pietism undermined the foundations of the old orthodoxy. An agreement between the liberal and conservative parties was temporarily attained insofar that it was decided that the Consensus was not to be regarded as a rule of faith, but only as a norm of teaching. In 1722 Prussia and England applied to the respective magistracies of the Swiss cantons for the abolition of the formula for the sake of the unity and peace of the Protestant Churches. The reply was somewhat evasive, but, though the formula was never formally abolished, it gradually fell entirely into disuse.\n\n\n\n"}

(stylized as \"IMPACT!\") is a professional wrestling television program produced by the American Impact Wrestling promotion, formerly known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). The show debuted in the United States on June 4, 2004, and currently airs on AXS TV, owned by parent company Anthem, as well as in simulcast on the online video platform Twitch.\n\nIn May 2004, TNA announced that they had negotiated a television deal with Fox Sports Net (FSN) where they would get a one-hour timeslot on Fridays in most markets, putting TNA on unrestricted cable and satellite for the first time. TNA began taping \"Impact!\" that month and aired the first episode on June 4, 2004. \"Impact!\" was also syndicated throughout Canada on RDS and Europe on The Wrestling Channel and later both Bravo and Bravo 2 in the United Kingdom, as well as Eurosport. After 51 shows TNA's contract with FSN expired in May 2005 and was not renegotiated, with the last episode airing on May 27, 2005. The series as a whole had little success, averaging a 0.3 household rating.\n\nTNA was left with no television deal and, therefore, had no means of promoting their monthly pay-per-views, although \"Impact!\" did continue to air on certain regional networks in place of \"Xplosion\". On July 1, TNA began offering new episodes through their website, first using BitTorrent downloads, then by streaming through RealPlayer. To save on production costs, four hours of the show were recorded in a day and made available throughout the subsequent month.\n\nAt the same time, TNA began seeking a more profitable television outlet, finally negotiated a Saturday night timeslot with Spike TV (now known as the Paramount Network) and started airing \"Impact!\" on October 1, 2005. Two episodes were taped every other Tuesday, airing them on the subsequent Saturday. TNA's syndication contracts for the show on local TV channels, from after the FSN contract, were converted to contracts for their syndicated show, \"TNA Xplosion\". They were no longer paying for the timeslot, though Spike controlled their advertising revenue. Because of viewership growth, \"Impact!\" was moved to Thursdays in April 2006, and later to an earlier primetime slot in November. At this time tapings were moved from Tuesdays to Mondays. In June 2006, episodes became available at the iTunes Store, though they have since been removed.\n\nDue to further viewership growth, \"Impact!\" was expanded to two hours on October 4, 2007, still starting at the same time of 9pm. On January 17, 2008, Spike presented an event entitled \"Global Impact!\", which featured TNA wrestlers in matches against talents from New Japan Pro Wrestling and on March 27, 2008, \"Impact!\" aired live for the first time in the show's history in its regular timeslot. Announced in a release on TNAwrestling.com on April 2, 2008, TNA came to terms on a deal that had the show airing in Australia starting April 5. Up until then, they had only broadcast their monthly pay-per-view events on Main Event in Australia. The contract expired in March 2011 and was not renewed, however, in May 2011, the show was picked up by Australian Network FuelTV, which began airing it every Saturday at 8:30 pm AEST, starting on June 11. On October 23, 2008, TNA aired its first \"Impact!\" filmed outside the Impact Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was broadcast from The Joint in the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. TNA also made the transition to HD for this broadcast and announced that all future episodes would be broadcast in High Definition.\n\nOn January 4, 2010, the show went head-to-head for the first time with TNA's rival-promotion WWE's flagship show \"Raw\". This would be the first time since March 2001 that two major wrestling promotions went head-to-head in a Monday night television ratings competition. TNA advertised the debut of Hulk Hogan and his return to professional wrestling, while WWE promoted the return of Bret Hart to \"Raw\", who last made an appearance in November 1997 before the Montreal Screwjob. On this night, \"Impact!\" was watched by more than 3 million viewers for the opening hour, towards the end of the show, the viewership declined to 2.2 million viewers, this was the highest viewership in the show's history; \"Raw\" was watched by 5.6 million viewers, the most since August 2009.\n\n\"Impact!\" was permanently moved to Monday nights on March 8, 2010. The show would air live on a bi-weekly basis and be taped for the following week. On the edition of March 8, \"Impact!\" debuted their new theme song. Beginning with the show of April 12, 2010, \"Impact!\" was aired at 8:00pm Eastern on Spike TV. This change was made as a result of the increase in ratings from the show of March 29, 2010 (which aired at 9:00pm Eastern) and the show of April 5, 2010 (which aired at 8:00 pm Eastern). The final Monday \"Impact!\" scored a 0.8 rating and was then moved back to Thursday nights, the reason for the return to Thursdays was due to reduced television audience figures on Mondays.\n\nThe show returned to Thursday nights on Thursday, May 13, 2010. Commenting on the move on the TNA website, Brian J. Diamond (Spike TV's Senior Vice President of Sports and Specials) said, \"The fans have spoken and with their input we have determined the best time slot to maximize the TNA audience is on Thursday nights where we are confident it will be among the most-watched shows with young men\". In the same announcement, TNA president Dixie Carter was quoted as saying, \"Our fans made it clear that they preferred the Thursday night time period. By moving to Thursdays, this is a win/win opportunity for both TNA and the fans. We are looking forward to delivering what the fans are asking for\".\n\nOn June 24, 2010, Spike TV expanded “TNA Thursdays” to three hours with the addition of \"TNA Reaction\" (stylized as \"TNA ReAction\" or, alternatively, as \"TNA ReACTION\"), which became a regular one-hour docu-series immediately preceding \"TNA iMPACT!\" from 8:00pm–9:00pm Eastern. \"ReAction\" focused on the stories and characters of TNA Wrestling and previewed the upcoming episode of \"TNA iMPACT!\" \"TNA Impact!\" was also re-branded as \"Thursday Night Impact\" due to its return to Thursdays. TNA Wrestling president Dixie Carter announced on January 13, 2011, that on February 24, 2011, TNA would be holding \"Impact!\" tapings at the Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville, North Carolina.\n\nOn May 3, 2011, during the tapings of the May 12 episode, the show changed its name to \"Impact Wrestling\" with the slogan \"Where Wrestling Matters\", and the color scheme changing from red and black to blue, white and gray. The URL of TNA Wrestling's website was also changed to impactwrestling.com. On July 11, 2011, it was announced that TNA would hold \"Impact Wrestling\" tapings on August 25 at the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama, on September 21 at the Knoxville Coliseum in Knoxville, Tennessee, and on October 26 at the Macon Coliseum in Macon, Georgia. On January 6, 2012, TNA announced the first international \"Impact Wrestling\" tapings would be taking place on January 28 at the Wembley Arena in London, England.\n\nOn May 17, 2012, TNA announced that \"Impact Wrestling\" would air live through the summer of 2012, starting on May 31, when the show moved to a new time slot at 8pm ET. The live schedule was later extended first through September, and then through the rest of 2012. On January 31, 2013, TNA announced that they would begin taping Impact from different venues around the United States starting March 14, 2013, from the Sears Center in Chicago. TNA officially terminated its lease with Universal Studios Orlando Florida in late March 2013 and left the Impact Wrestling Zone.\nOn March 14, 2013, TNA introduced a new universal HD set which is used for all weekly programming. On May 30, 2013, Impact Wrestling went back to its old start time of 9pm and in July 2013, TNA announced that they would broadcast five \"Impact Wrestling\" specials in 2013 starting July 18, 2013 with Destination X. This was followed by Hardcore Justice, No Surrender, Final Resolution and Turning Point. These specials replaced the PPV events of the same name following TNA changing their monthly PPV format to a quarterly model.\n\nOn October 24, 2013, TNA announced they will be returning to Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida on November 21, 2013 due to the high cost of production on the road. Impact tapings would be filmed from soundstage 19, rather than at the original Impact Zone at soundtage 21, but there will still be select tapings on the road from time to time, such as the Genesis \"Impact Wrestling\" special on January 16 and 23, 2014 from the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama. TNA also announced a new programming initiative called IMPACT365 - Where Action Never Ends, in which cameras provide unprecedented access to the lives of the TNA Superstars. This has been used to make announcements for upcoming shows and for starting new angles and storylines.\n\nOn January 30, 2014, for the first time, \"Impact Wrestling\" was broadcast live in the UK on Challenge before it aired in the US. The show took place at The Hydro in Glasgow, Scotland. TNA announced that they will be changing soundstages at Universal Studios Florida again starting with the March 13, 2014 live broadcast of \"Impact Wrestling\". The new soundstage will be soundstage 20. Soundstage 19 and 20 were only temporary venues for Impact Wrestling tapings. Since June 10, 2014 TNA has taped Impact Wrestling from The Sands Casino Event Center in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and the Manhattan Center's Grand Ballroom in New York City. On July 17, 2014, after a poll made on the \"Impact Wrestling\" website, TNA brought back the six-sided ring permanently.\n\nOn July 28, 2014, \"TMZ\" reported that Spike would not renew TNA's contract, which was due to expire in September. The decision was reportedly triggered by TNA's decision to bring writer Vince Russo back to the company as a consultant. However, Mike Johnson of PW Insider who first revealed that Russo was working for TNA insists that his involvement had nothing to do with the cancellation. TNA president Dixie Carter and Spike subsequently released independent statements claiming that negotiations were ongoing. On August 14, Carter announced that \"Impact Wrestling\" would move to Wednesday nights and on August 20 announced that \"Impact Wrestling\" would continue on Spike for the remainder of 2014, adding that negotiations were still on going. Spike spokesperson David Schwarz told \"The Christian Post\" that increasing competition from other sports programs prompted the move from Thursday nights. The show ceased airing new televised events after the edition of November 19 of \"Impact Wrestling\", with the final episodes of 2014 being dedicated to Best of TNA clip shows, before resuming events on January 7, 2015 with a live show from The Manhattan Center's Grand Ballroom in New York City. The last episode of \"Impact Wrestling\" broadcast on Spike aired on December 24, 2014.\n\nOn November 19, 2014, TNA announced that it had reached a deal with Discovery Communications to move its programming, including \"Impact Wrestling\", to its network Destination America in January 2015. After premiering on Wednesday, January 7, \"Impact\" moved to its permanent slot on Fridays on January 16.\n\nAlong with the move to Destination America, the show got a new logo, graphics package, theme music, and stage. Former WWE employee Josh Mathews was also added to the commentary team. A brand new weekly series hosted by Mike Tenay, \"Impact Wrestling: Unlocked\", premiered on Saturday, January 17 and \"TNA Wrestling's Greatest Matches\", a series featuring the best matches in the company's history, made its U.S debut on Saturday, January 10. After switching timeslots numerous times, both shows were cancelled in May.\n\nAlso in May, Dave Meltzer of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" reported that Destination America had decided to cancel \"Impact\" by late September 2015. TNA vehemently denied the report, stating: \"These false statements constitute defamation and if necessary we will seek all legal remedies available to us.\" The following week Destination America announced that they had signed a 26-week trial deal with Ring of Honor that would see \"Ring of Honor Wrestling\" air as \"Impact\"'s lead-in which began on June 3. \"Impact\" subsequently began airing on Wednesdays starting in June.\n\nOn June 3, D'Angelo Dinero officially joined Josh Mathews as a new addition to the commentary team for \"Impact Wrestling\". In a September interview with \"Sports Illustrated\", Dixie Carter indicated that \"Impact\" would remain on Destination America for the rest of the year which ended on December 16, 2015.\n\nOn November 19, 2015, it was announced \"Impact Wrestling\" will air Tuesdays nights on Pop beginning January 5, 2016. With the show's move to Pop, it got a new graphics package, theme music (including \"Roustabout\" by The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan), and stage. \"Impact Wrestling\" moved to Thursday night beginning July 21, 2016, to avoid airing directly opposite \"WWE SmackDown\", which moved to Tuesdays.\n\nOn July 4, 2017, after Impact Wrestling briefly rebranded as Global Force Wrestling (GFW), the show's name was changed to simply \"Impact!\". The show's name would remain unchanged following the departure of Jeff Jarrett and aborted merger with GFW.\n\nIn October 2018, \"Impact!\" moved to 10pm ET on Thursdays nights.\n\nIn January 2019, during its Homecoming pay-per-view, it was announced that \"Impact!\"'s U.S broadcast would move to Pursuit Channel (which is partly owned by Anthem) and stream in simulcast on Twitch. Its first broadcast on Pursuit, which serves a significantly smaller number of subscribers than Pop, was seen by an average of 12,500 viewers.\n\nOn September 9, 2019, Anthem purchased a majority stake in AXS TV. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that \"Impact!\" will move to AXS the following month, after Bound for Glory on October 20, 2019, and continue to simulcast on the company's Twitch channel. It was later announced that the show would move to Tuesday nights, with \"Impact\" premiering on October 29, 2019.\n\n\"Impact!\" originally premiered on Fox Sports Net, where it remained until May 2005. The show began broadcasting episodes via syndication in limited markets on Urban America Television (replacing the syndicated show \"Xplosion\") and on the Internet between June 24 and September 16, 2005. \n\nThe company would eventually secure a deal with Spike TV, with the first episode airing on October 1, 2005. \"Impact!\" first began airing episodes on Saturday nights, before later moving to Thursday nights in April 2006. The show would briefly move to Monday nights in 2010, and as well as Wednesday nights in 2014, until its final broadcast on Spike. \n\nIn 2015, the show moved to Destination America, initially airing on Friday nights, before moving back to Wednesday nights on June 3, 2015, until its final broadcast on December 16, 2015. From January 5, 2016, until January 4, 2019, \"Impact!\" aired weekly on Pop, with the show moving back to Thursday nights on July 21, 2016. \n\nOn January 11, 2019, \"Impact!\" moved to Friday nights on Pursuit Channel and Twitch. Beginning October 29, 2019, \"Impact!\" moved to Tuesday nights on AXS TV. On January 15, 2020, Impact's Twitch channel was banned after a sexually implicit segment involving Rob Van Dam was aired during that week's episode. The ban ended on January 22, 2020.\n\nGenerally, the show features four to seven matches over the course of the two hours, as well as numerous interviews and segments interspersed between the matches. Due to the nature of the wrestling business, advertisements for merchandise and upcoming pay-per-view events often serve as bookends for the commercial segments.\n\nWhen the show was on Fox Sports Net, all matches had a time limit (10 minutes for normal singles matches and 30 minutes for title matches) and the network's Fox Box was used. In the event of a time limit draw, the winner was determined by the NWA Championship Committee, a group consisting of three veteran stars. Since leaving the channel, Impact Wrestling discarded the time limit concept.\n\nThe show features various on-air personalities including the stars themselves, ring announcers, knockouts, commentators, and on-screen authority figures. \"Impact\" also has had various recurring on-air segments hosted by members of the roster.\n\nIn addition to being broadcast on AXS TV in the United States, the show is also broadcast internationally in the following countries.\n\n\n"}

It had a population at the 2011 Census of 4,054.\n\nAlthough there was a small drift mine on the edge of the village which closed in the 1970s, Lanchester's economy was mainly based on agriculture. It is now a residential village in which a number of housing estates have been developed since the late 1960s. \n\nThe earliest occupation on the site is the Roman auxiliary fort located just southwest of Lanchester (. \"Longovicium\" lay on the Roman road leading north from Eboracum (York), known as Dere Street. It is situated between the forts of Vindomora (Ebchester) and Vinovia (Binchester). The fort dates to AD 140, covers almost , and housed around 1,000-foot soldiers and cavalry. The fort foundations are well preserved, but there has only been minor excavation work carried out in 1937.\n\nStone from the fort was used in the construction of All Saints' Church, which has a Roman altar in its porch. It is one of many altars found in or near the fort, and was found in 1893.\n\nAndrew Breeze has argued that the Battle of Brunanburh took place at the Roman fort of Longovicium. He interprets \"Brunanburh\" as meaning 'stronghold of the River Browney.'\n\nAn electoral ward in the same name exists. The population of this ward taken at the 2011 Census was 7,446.\nThe schools at Lanchester include St Bede's Catholic School and Sixth Form College. There are also two primary schools: Lanchester All Saints' RC Primary School and Lanchester Endowed Parochial (E.P) This latter has since moved about to new premises and the old school is now the village hall. The school has a nursery, an infants department and a juniors department.\n\nThe main Parish church is now known as All Saints but was once called St. Mary the Virgin. The original building dates from the mid 12th Century but was extended in 1284 by Antony Bek, the bishop of Durham. The tower dates from c.1430. Features of interest include the Norman chancel arch, the monolithic columns of the nave (presumably from the Lanchester Roman station) and a Roman altar in the porch.\n\nThe parish of Lanchester was originally very large, covering sixty-eight miles². To profit from this Anthony Bek created a Deanery and College of Canons at the church in 1284 and extended it to accommodate the increased numbers of clergy. The college consisted of a Dean and seven Prebendarys who each held a share in the church's revenues. Bek created a set of statutes and ordinances for the College which were confirmed by Edward I in 1293. The church supplemented its income by monopolising the sale of religious items such as holy water to the surrounding villages.\n\nBy the 15th century, the college was falling out of use and the church fell into a poor state of repair with \"gaping ruins\" in the church, Deanery and the canons' houses. By the time Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries the College and Deanery were abolished and the church returned to perpetual curacy.\n\nThe other churches within Lanchester are the All Saints' Catholic church and the Methodist Church which is centred in the heart of the village.\n\n\n"}

Its western terminus is a diamond interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75 or SR 93) in the Palm Springs North area near Miami Lakes, passing through Carol City, Miami Gardens, and North Miami Beach before ending at an intersection with Biscayne Boulevard (U.S. Route 1 or US 1/SR 5) in Aventura. State Road 860 is a major commuter road passing by major shopping centers and industrial parks separated by suburban communities, and often serves as an alternate to the northern (east–west) segment of the often-congested Palmetto Expressway (SR 826) and the Golden Glades Interchange to the south.\n\nA four-lane divided highway for most of its route, State Road 860 begins at a diamond interchange (formerly a trumpet interchange prior to 2018) with I-75 and a park and ride facility. The highway heads east as Miami Gardens Drive, as a central artery through a mostly residential area, serving the local commercial businesses, becoming more commercial east of a canal crossing. It has an intersection with Ludlam Road and then intersects State Road 823 (Red Road/NW 75th Avenue). East of that intersection, it enters Miami Gardens, with slightly older housing developments than west of SR 823. It then intersects State Road 847 (NW 47th Avenue) and State Road 817 (NW 27th Avenue), with SR 817 leading to Hard Rock Stadium. East of there, SR 860 continues east through residential areas of Miami Gardens, passing under Florida's Turnpike without an interchange, and intersecting with US 441/SR 7 at the eastern end of Miami Gardens. SR 860 then enters North Miami Beach, passing through a small industrial area before intersecting with I-95, along with State Road 915. Following the intersection, Miami Gardens Drive continues east into the residential areas of Aventura, traversing in a northeastern direction at a canal crossing and continuing east through condo developments and more housing before reaching its eastern terminus at US 1/SR 5.\n\nState Road 860 was applied in the late 1970s to the section of Miami Gardens Drive from Red Road/West 57th Avenue – at that time, the northern terminus of SR 955, now part of SR 823 in Carol City to US 1. Unlike most Florida State Roads in Miami-Dade County, SR 860 has actually become longer since the designation, as after the completion of I-75 in 1993, the SR 860 designation was extended westward to connect with the Interstate highway.\n"}

It is based on the professional wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Unlike \"TNA Wrestling\", the previous mobile game based on TNA, \"TNA Wrestling Impact\" features 3D graphics and is more action-oriented than its predecessor. The game was released for both iOS and Android devices. The game has received mixed reviews, with criticism directed at the game's presentation and controls. It is no longer available for download on the iTunes App Store or Google Play Store.\n\nThe game makes use of the touch screen of iOS and Android devices by providing a virtual control pad for movement and three buttons for grapples, attacks and other in-ring actions. The actions available to the player are determined by the current in-ring situation - for example, pressing the attack button near a downed wrestler may result in a stomp to the opponent's closest body part. The game also features an option allowing players to create an original wrestler.\n\nPlayers can enter career mode to contend for one of three TNA titles: the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, the TNA X Division Championship or the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Match types include cage matches and submission matches.\n\nThe game has received mixed reviews. Harry Slater reviewed the Android version for Pocket Gamer and criticized the pace as well as the repetitiveness of the game. However, he described the game as fun and as a good representation of pro wrestling as a whole, giving the game a 7 out of 10.

The 75 outlets in the easyInternetcafé chain are managed by 28 franchises.\n\nThe business was launched in 1999 with the name easyEverything. The company built yield management into its business system and adapted this to a penetration pricing strategy to build location, brand and product awareness. In several European countries it was able to build upon some degree of brand awareness created by the marketing activities of its sister company, the airline EasyJet.\n\nEasyEverything was different from most Internet cafés in that it offered dynamically priced services on the High Street. The principle was as the occupancy, the number of customers, in a café (or group of cafés) increases, so does the rate per hour they pay for services. Viewed conversely, as the occupancy increases, the number of minutes of a service that customers get for their £, $ or € decreases. The business was aggressive and disruptive with its pricing strategy, offering high-speed Internet access at a price per hour of up to 80% less than competing Internet cafés. An EasyEverything customer could ‘roam’ nationally, i.e. use their pre-paid credit for services at different Internet cafés in the same country.\n\nEasyEverything partnered with Microsoft to provide games and personal productivity software as metered services and with the network provider Deltathree for an Internet telephony service.\n\nIn September 2000, EasyEverything was named ‘E-company of the Year’ at Future Publishing’s Internet awards ceremony. The award was voted for by members of the public. In the same year it received an award from \"Retail Week\" magazine for ‘Retail Launch of the Year’ and from \"Network Telecoms\" magazine for the ‘Most Innovative Use of Network Products and Services.’ In November 2000 it won the award for 'International Property Strategy and Development, Design, Innovation and Concept' at the MAPIC awards in Cannes, France, one of the most prestigious awards ceremonies in the international retail real estate sector. In February 2001 EasyEverything launched its own media sales house, easyEverything media sales (ee-ms), in a joint venture with the WPP advertising and marketing services group.\n\nIn June 2001 EasyEverything received the ‘Investment in France 2001’ award at the French ambassador's residence in London.\n\nThe company achieved initial success in London with very large Internet cafés. In its subsequent rapid pan-European (and New York) expansion it overestimated demand for similar Internet cafés with hundreds of PCs open 24 hours a day at locations other than the most popular capital city epicentres for tourists and travellers. In response the business later had to rationalise its portfolio of outlets, make staff redundant (vending machines replacing staff as the method of dispensing service credit to customers), sublet retail space and overhaul head office and in-country operations. The business was reorganised on a franchising model focusing on more compact and locally managed sites operating with higher rates of occupancy. The company's first franchisee was the Greek retailer Germanos. The company was rebranded EasyInternetcafé. The company's operations were devolved entirely to its franchisees by 2009. easyGroup retains the easyInternetcafe brand name.\n\nIn July 2001 gay websites gaydar.co.uk and squirt.org called a boycott of easyInternetcafé (then called easyEverything), claiming that they blocked \"harmless\" gay websites. Websense, the filtering software being employed by easyEverything had blocked gay sites such as their own. An easyEverything spokesman responded described the sites as \"offensive\" owing to the images that they contain, but was unable to offer a clear definition of \"obscene\" content. easyEverything advised customers to contact Websense directly with any complaints about the filtering system.\n\nIn 2003 the chain was found liable for copyright infringement occurring when customers used its CD-burning service to burn illegally downloaded music to their own CDs.\n"}

It is managed by the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation. SPECfp is the floating point performance testing component of the SPEC CPU testing suit. The first standard SPECfp was released in 1989 as SPECfp89. Later it was replaced by SPECfp92, then SPECfp95, then SPECfp2000, then SPECfp2006, and finally SPECfp2017.\n\nSPEC CPU2017 is a suite of benchmark applications designed to test the CPU performance. The suite is composed of two sets of tests. The first being CINT (aka SPECint) which is for evaluating the CPU performance in integer operations. The second set is CFP (aka SPECfp) which is for evaluating the CPU floating point operations performance.\n\nThe benchmark applications are programs that perform a strict set of operation that simulate real time situations, such as physical simulations, 3D graphics, and image processing. These applications are written in different programming languages, C, C++ and Fortran. Many SPECfp benchmark applications are derived from applications that are freely available to the public and each application is assigned a weight based on its importance.\n\nTo compute the SPECfp score, benchmark applications run on a reference machine and the time each application requires for completion is recorded as the reference time. When evaluating the performance of another machine, the benchmark application is run on that system and the time the application requires for completion is recorded. Then the ratio between the recorded time and the reference time is computed. The geometric mean of all the benchmark suite application ratios is then computed as the SPECfp score.\n\nFor example, 126.gcc application takes 1280 seconds to complete on the AlphaStation 200 4/100, while it takes 1700 seconds on the reference machine. So, the ratio is: 1700/1280 = 1.328, which implies that AlphaStation 200 4/100 is 32.8% faster than the reference machine in running the 126.gcc.\n\nThe SPECfp2017 test is organized in 2 suites: SPECrate 2017 Floating Point and SPECspeed 2017 Floating Point containing in total 23 benchmark programs, designed to evaluate the floating point operations performance of a given system. The suite was released on June 2, 2017 replacing SPECfp2006 as of January 2018.\n\nThe SPECfp2006 test suite contains 17 benchmark programs, designed to evaluate the floating point operations performance of a given system. Three of these programs are written in C, four are written in C++, six are written in Fortran, and four are written in both C and Fortran. The suite was released on August 24, 2006 replacing SPECfp2000 as of February 2007.\n\nThe benchmark programs are:\nThe SPECfp2000 test suite contains 14 benchmark programs, designed to evaluate the floating point operations performance of a given system.

The magazine was founded in Iowa City, Iowa in 1991 by Paul Valerio. Issue #1 was released as a half-sized black & white xerox fanzine with a press run of 100 copies. It quickly grew in size and depth to document the underground electronic music industry and culture. In 1995 the magazine's home base relocated to Chicago. \"Industrialnation\" upgraded to a full-size format (8.5\"×11\") with full-color glossy cover and newsprint interior. After publishing issue #16 in 1998, the editorial staff took a hiatus from publishing. In 2003 \"Industrialnation\" reappeared in the San Francisco Bay Area and laid roots in Oakland. For the five issues published thereafter, the print quality of the magazine was improved, adding glossy and color pages inside.\n\nIn the 1990s, no other periodical dedicated to industrial music culture had the circulation and influence of \"Industrialnation\". The magazine was an important channel of communication in the subculture—particularly within America. Since 2010 it has been cited repeatedly in \"\" and been referenced as historically significant in liner notes by Prurient. Scholar Michael du Plessis notes that the magazine was an early voice in transhumanism. The publication is included in special collections at academic libraries that include Michigan State University and Bowling Green State University.\n\n\"Industrialnation\" on occasion would also publish a compilation album on CD to be included with an given issue.

{"id": "2334120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334120", "title": "Indian Oil Cup 2005", "text": "Indian Oil Cup 2005\n\nThe Indian Oil Cup 2005 was a three-team One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament held in Sri Lanka between 30 July and 7 August 2005. The participating teams were hosts Sri Lanka, and India and West Indies. Sri Lanka won the tournament beating India by 18 runs in the final.\n\nEntering the tournament, Sri Lanka were second in the ICC ODI rankings, and were the favorites to win the tournament. West Indies did not field their strongest side as the team was in the middle of a contract dispute with their governing board. Each team played the others twice during the round-robin stage and the two top-placed teams based on points met in the final.\n\nPoints System:\n\n\nIn the event of teams finishing on equal points, the right to play in the final match or series was determined as follows:\n\nIn a match declared as no result, run rate is not applicable.\n\nOpting to bat first, India got off to a poor start losing Virender Sehwag in the third over, after he scored three fours off Farveez Maharoof and Dilhara Lokuhettige. The other opener Mahendra Singh Dhoni soon followed him to the pavilion, and Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh were to rebuild, from the score at 22/2. They played cautiously, yet the former gave away his wicket, pulling to substitute fielder Upul Tharanga at mid-on. More wickets followed in the form of debutante, Suresh Raina, who was trapped leg before wicket in his first ball in senior international cricket, by Muttiah Muralitharan's doosra, as India crumbled to 64/5. Dravid, however, played a reliable knock, and together with another debutante, Yalaka Venugopal Rao, added 58 in thirteen overs. However, it came to an end too early to help India significantly in the late overs, with leg-spinner Upul Chandana sneaking a ball past his bat and pads and having him bowled for 54, and India were staring at a very low score – 123/6 after 33 overs. Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan added 20 each, however, which coupled with Irfan Pathan's slow but steady 21, lifted India to a somewhat competitive score of 205/9 at the end of 50 overs.\n\nThe only downside for Sri Lanka was that their opener Sanath Jayasuriya had torn his shoulder, and looked unlikely to have a bat. Therefore, Kumar Sangakkara joined Marvan Atapattu as openers for Sri Lanka. They pair added 19 in 26 balls, before Irfan Pathan dug him out with a good inswinger. India took wickets regularly, but by the end of the 25th over Sri Lanka were 99/3, and well on the way to chasing 206. But Harbhajan Singh's off-breaks two players to miss their shots, and suddenly the score was 112/5, with an injured Jayasuriya and debutante Dilhara Lokuhettige at the crease. However, Jayasuriya battled on bravely and made an unbeaten 43 to guide Sri Lanka to the target with ten balls to spare, well helped by Farveez Maharoof, who made 23 from number 9 including four fours hit in front of square and a number of nervy shots that missed the bat.\n\nWest Indies got off to a poor start losing their first wicket in the third over and were reduced for 36/3 at the end of 15 overs. Narsingh Deonarine, who had struggled to get off the mark, and Shivnarine Chanderpaul survived for 17 overs, making only 52 before Suresh Raina took his first international wicket as Chanderpaul missed a straight delivery. Ricardo Powell followed shortly afterwards, and despite some slogging from Dwayne Smith, who made 20 off 7 balls including two sixes, and Tino Best, who made 24, West Indies crumbled to 178 all out as Ashish Nehra took two late-order wickets and Zaheer Khan, the final wicket.\n\nAfter India's shaky first 15 overs which had yielded 83 runs and three wickets, Rahul Dravid (52*) and Yuvraj Singh (28) settled in the crease, and put on 61 runs for the 4th wicket. Mahendra Singh Dhoni took his place with ease, smashing a four and a six on the way to an unbeaten 15, and India reached the target with fourteen overs to spare.\n\nSri Lanka lost their first wicket in debutante, Upul Tharanga (6), in the third over, when Kumar Sangakkara joined the other opener Marvan Atapattu, who put 138 runs together for the second wicket in 34 overs. After 25 overs, the score was 78/1, but the pair took to the attack in the next 10 overs and added another 71 before part-timer Narsingh Deonarine had Sangakkara caught at cover for 79. Despite wickets tumbling, Sri Lanka kept the run rate up well and added 107 in the last 15 overs. Russel Arnold made an unbeaten 21 and pairing up with Upul Chandana (15*) for 36 for the seventh wicket, saw Sri Lanka to the 50-over mark on 241/6.\n\nThe Sri Lankan bowling attack reduced West Indies to 26/3 by the end of 10 overs, with Farveez Maharoof bowling three maidens in his first five overs and giving away just 5 runs for 2 wickets. Dilhara Lokuhettige picked two up two wickets in the space of five overs, and also had a catch dropped. After 20 overs, the West Indies were 55/5; Maharoof having bowled ten of those, finishing his quota, finishing with figures of 3/9. Deonarine, Dwayne Smith and Denesh Ramdin tried to build their innings. Deonarine inside-edged a delivery from Dilhara Fernando back onto his own stumps for 23, Ramdin departed for 29 in the 37th over after a 46-run partnership, and Smith was bowled by Muralitharan for 69. Losing the tail quickly, they finished at 191, one run short of gaining a bonus point, in 45.1 overs.\n\nRahul Dravid, India's stand-in captain, retained as captain despite Sourav Ganguly's return to the team following a four-match ban, decided to bat first after winning the toss. The latter and Virender Sehwag put on 67 for the first wicket. The debutant, Pradeep Jayaprakashdaran, picked up Sehwag's wicket, and was economical, conceding only 21 in his six overs, that included five wides. The part-timer Tillakaratne Dilshan picked up three of the next four wickets, but only after India had moved to 117/1. V. V. S. Laxman departed first for 22, Ganguly quickly following suit after having scored 51 off 110 deliveries, in the process reaching 10,000 ODI runs, and Dravid, done in by the drift, was bowled by Dilshan for a golden duck. Dilshan got a fourth scalp, that of Suresh Raina, and finished with figures of 4/29. Irfan Pathan (36*) and Mohammad Kaif (34) attacked the bowlers in the final overs to see India to a competitive 220/8.\n\nSanath Jayasuriya was still out due to his injury sustained in his last game against India and Muttiah Muralitharan was rested. For India, Irfan Pathan, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Ashish Nehra took four wickets together and toiled away; another fell to a run-out, and Harbhajan Singh had Dilhara Lokuhettige caught behind for a six-ball duck. After 26 overs, Sri Lanka were 96/6, needing 125 from the last 24 overs. At the crease were Mahela Jayawardene and the number eight, Upul Chandana. They saw off Nehra, who finished with 2/22, and managed to get runs off other bowlers, such as part-timers Ganguly and Sehwag, who gave away 55 runs in 9 overs. The pair put on an unbeaten 126 for the seventh wicket to see their team home in 48 overs. Jayawardene finished at 94* and Chandana at 44*.\n\nShivnarine Chanderpaul, who was coming in at five or six, opened the innings with Xavier Marshall, in an effort to stabilise the top order. The latter was run out by Upul Tharanga's direct throw to the stumps in the ninth over with the score at 25/1. Chanderpaul (57) put on a 72-run stand with Sylvester Joseph (58) for the second wicket, the team's highest second-wicket partnership in any form of cricket since early May 2005. Joseph and Narsingh Deonarine added 55 together, but after 41 overs West Indies were still at a relatively paltry 166/4; Joseph having been run out after a mix-up with Omari Banks. However, Banks redeemed himself with 33. Ricardo Powell and Tino Best hit quick runs, and saw the team reach 226/7 at the end of 50 overs.\n\nAfter an opening ten overs which yielded 46 runs for Sri Lanka, Sanath Jayasuriya was trapped lbw by Deighton Butler with the last delivery of the tenth over, following which Daren Powell and Dwayne Smith tied the Sri Lankans down with good pace bowling. Powell got Kumar Sangakkara's wicket for 7, before Smith dug out two wickets with successive balls as Sri Lanka moved to 73/4. Mahela Jayawardene gave an heave to Powell, and Sri Lanka were five down for 92, after 25 overs. Banks finished with 26 runs from his ten overs, securing the wicket of Chandana, following which Sri Lanka felt were compelled to lash out in order to have a go at reaching the target. The part-timer Deonarine got two wickets, including the final one of Russel Arnold, who made a slow 59, before bowling Sri Lanka out to 193 at the end of the 47th over, thereby helping his team win their first game of the tournament.\n\nThis match was, in effect, a semi-final, with both teams needing a win to proceed to the final with Sri Lanka. Rahul Dravid won the toss and chose to bat. His teammates were immediately worried by the hostile bowling of the West Indian seamers who got plenty of swing and awkward bounce. It was enough to send Sourav Ganguly out of the match with an arm injury in the fourth over, and Virender Sehwag and V. V. S. Laxman were also dismissed early. Effectively, India were three batsmen down for 21 at that point. Dravid and Yuvraj Singh rebuilt with a 30-run partnership when Omari Banks struck with his first ball bowling out Dravid, reducing India to 51/3 after 16 overs. Singh, however, kept his calm, and was well supported by Mohammad Kaif (83*), putting together 165 runs off 178 balls for the fourth wicket. The pair took runs off Narsingh Deonarine in particular, clubbing hi for 69 in eight overs, while the seamers Deighton Butler, Tino Best and Daren Powell were not used for the full ten overs. Singh was eventually got out for 110, sweeping Best to short fine leg. Blitz by Mahendra Singh Dhoni (28*) in the final overs which included two sixes, lifted India to 262/4.\n\nSylvester Joseph led the West Indian side in Shivnarine Chanderpaul's absence owing to illness. Openers Xavier Marshall and Runako Morton attacked from the outset, plundering 37 runs from the first six overs, when Irfan Pathan got Marshall out with an inswinger and bowled a wicket-maiden over. Pathan, Ashish Nehra and Anil Kumble continued to dig out wickets, but Morton remained at the crease. The West Indies crashing to 112/6 after 24 overs. Kumble did get Banks and Dwayne Smith out lbw, the latter for a 12-ball cameo that yielded 26 runs. However, Morton stuck in, making 84, before losing his wicket to Nehra, getting caught by Dravid. West Indies needed 68 runs from 11 overs, with three wickets in hand. Denesh Ramdin, the wicket-keeper, gave it a go. He hacked at everything, missing occasionally, but also getting quite a few boundaries. His team needed twelve runs off the last over, and Nehra conceded only 4, helping his team win by seven runs.\n\nSri Lanka prevailed on home soil, recovering from Nehra's spell of swing bowling and Sehwag's massive onslaught to keep their 2.5-year unbeaten record in home international tournaments. It started with Atapattu choosing to bat after winning the toss, and then getting bowled by Nehra for 11 after misreading the line. Sri Lanka sent in a pinch hitter in Dilhara who hit two fours and a single off seven deliveries before being dubiously adjudged lbw, again from Nehra. Nehra took his third wicket when Sangakkara was caught at point by Sehwag, and Sri Lanka were struggling slightly at 67 for 3.\n\nMeanwhile, Jayasuriya was dropped twice, but survived and went on to make 67 before being run out attempting a difficult second run. By that time, however, he had steadied the ship with Jayawardene, and Arnold helped to up the pace - the score being 122 for 4 after 26 overs, when Jayasuriya was out. It did not matter, as Arnold and Jayawardene treated the spinners with disdain, plundering 125 runs in 20 overs and accelerating the scoring to a point where India could not keep up. Nehra tried, and his variations gave him more wickets - he finished with the second six-wicket-haul of his career, the first coming against England in the 2003 World Cup, but a returning Vaas helped himself to 18 not out and upped the total to 281 for 9. An interesting feature of the scorecard was that no Indian bowler apart from Nehra got wickets - six for him, the other three were run outs.\n\nIndia batted with composure, grit, and the occasional flamboyance - the latter coming from Sehwag especially, who plundered nine fours and a six on his way to a 22-ball 48 before Vaas curved a short one into his body and Sehwag obligingly chopped onto his stumps. It had arguably given India a perfect start, and had included a 22-run over off Dilhara. Ganguly was lbw to Dilshan in the 16th over, but Yuvraj and Dravid set the scene for an Indian victory, pairing up for 84 for the third wicket as India needed 98 in 15 overs. Tricky, but definitely possible in today's ODI cricket.\n\nHowever, Yuvraj swept to Dilhara when the 36th over began, and just as Kaif had begun to settle in with Dravid, a miscommunication left Dravid out of his crease, run out for 69. Kaif needed to forge a partnership with Dhoni, India's last recognised batsman as they had gone in with five specialist bowlers, but Dhoni was deceived by a straight ball from Chandana and lbw for 7. None of the batsmen from seven to eleven managed to get into double figures, Kaif was left to injudicious hitting and naturally top-edged one to midwicket, and India's chase - thought to be relatively simple fifteen overs before - ended a whole 18 runs short of Sri Lanka's total.\n\n"}

His father was an astronomer and the first Director of the University of London Observatory.\n\nGregory served with the Royal Air Force's Signals branch during World War II, and after the war earned an RAF scholarship to Downing College, Cambridge. One of Sir Frederic Bartlett's last pupils at Cambridge, Gregory admitted to having been inspired by him. He was made an Honorary Fellow of Downing in 1999.\n\nIn 1967, with Prof. Donald Michie and Prof. Christopher Longuet-Higgins, he founded the Department of Machine Intelligence and Perception, a forerunner of the Department of Artificial Intelligence, at the University of Edinburgh. He was Head of the Bionics Research Laboratory, Professor of Bionics, and Department Chairman 1968–70. Gregory was founding editor of the journal \"Perception\" (1972), which emphasized phenomenology and novel percepts produced by new stimuli. He was a founding member of the Experimental Psychology Society and served as its President in 1981–2.\n\nHe collaborated with W. E. Hick for the latter's influential paper \"On the rate of gain of information\". He commented: \"I was the only subject for his gain of information experiment to complete the course, as he was the only other subject and he packed it in when the apparatus fell apart.\"\n\nIn 1981, he founded The Exploratory, an applied science centre in Bristol, the first of its kind in the UK. In 1989, he was appointed Osher Visiting Fellow of the Exploratorium, a similar scientific education centre in San Francisco, California.\n\nGregory suggested Hermann von Helmholtz as his hero from past psychology, describing him as \"the modern founder of the science of perception\".\n\nHe appeared on, or was an advisor to, numerous science-related television programmes in the UK and worldwide. His particular interest was in optical illusions and what these revealed about human perception. He wrote and edited several books, notably \"Eye and Brain\" and \"Mind in Science\". One of his hobbies was punning (making puns). In April 1993, he was the guest for BBC Radio 4's \"Desert Island Discs\", where his favourite choice was Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 30.\n\nHaving suffered a stroke a few days earlier, he died on 17 May 2010 at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, surrounded by family and friends.\n\nIn 1967, he delivered the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on \"The Intelligent Eye\".\n\nGregory's main contribution to the discipline was in the development of cognitive psychology, in particular that of \"Perception as hypotheses\", an approach which had its origin in the work of Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) and his student Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920). Between them, the two Germans laid the basis of investigating how the senses work, especially sight and hearing.\n\nAccording to Gregory, Helmholtz should take the credit for realising that perception is not just a passive acceptance of stimuli, but an active process involving memory and other internal processes.\n\nGregory progressed this idea with a key analogy. The process whereby the brain puts together a coherent view of the outside world is analogous to the way in which the sciences build up their picture of the world, by a kind of hypothetico-deductive process. Although this takes place on a quite different time-scale, and inside one head instead of a community, nevertheless, according to Gregory, perception shares many traits with scientific method. A series of works by Gregory developed this idea in some detail.\n\nGregory's ideas ran counter to those of the American direct realist psychologist J. J. Gibson, whose 1950 \"The Perception of the Visual World\" was dominant when Gregory was a younger man. Much in Gregory's work can be seen as a reply to Gibson's ideas, and as the incorporation of explicitly Bayesian concepts into the understanding of how sensory evidence is combined with pre-existing (\"prior\") beliefs. Gregory argued that optical illusions, such as the illusory contours in the Kanizsa triangle, demonstrated the Bayesian processing of perceptual information by the brain.\n\n\nIn 1953, he married Margaret Hope Pattison Muir, one son, one daughter (marriage dissolved 1966). In 1967, he married Freja Mary Balchin, the daughter of writers Elizabeth and Nigel Balchin, (marriage dissolved 1976). Gregory is survived by two children (Mark and Romilly Gregory), two grandchildren (Luutsche Ozinga and Kiran Rogers) and his long term companion Priscilla Heard.\n\n"}

He was educated at Irvine Royal Academy and then Glasgow University, where he took a BSc (Hons) and PhD in Chemistry. He joined the ICI Petrochemical & Polymer Laboratory (later renamed the ICI Corporate Laboratory) at Runcorn in 1969 after post-doctoral research work in Paris. He moved to ICI Pharmaceuticals Division in 1975 and, having held a number of positions in Research, in 1989 he was appointed Technical Director of ICI with international responsibilities for research, development and production.\n\nIn 1993, ICI Pharmaceuticals demerged to become Zeneca, and in 1994 he was appointed chief executive officer of the new company. In April 1999, Zeneca merged with Astra to form AstraZeneca PLC. McKillop became chief executive officer (CEO) of the merged company. He retired from AstraZeneca on 1 January 2006, when David Brennan took over as AstraZeneca's CEO. McKillop became the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). His brother, Alexander McKillop, was Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of East Anglia from 1970–96.\n\nMcKillop then changed from chemistry to banking in 2006. He was chairman RBS from when it accrued a debt of £45 billion, working with CEO Fred Goodwin, who promoted aggressive expansion of the bank by acquiring other banks.\n\nOn 13 October 2008, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced a UK government bailout of £45 billion of new capital into Royal Bank of Scotland. RBS has accrued a further debt of £58 billion since 2008.\n\nBy 2008 RBS was the fifth-largest bank in the world by market capitalisation. It rose while aggressively pursuing leveraged buyouts which include debt transferal of acquired companies; for example RBS acquired ABN Amro for €71 billion, while ABN transpired to be worth only half of that. RBS Directors contracted that ABN could keep its collection of priceless art assets as part of the deal. In 2008 RBS also lent $9.3bn, more than double its nearest rival.\n\nFrom the time that Goodwin took over as chief executive until 2007, RBS's assets quadrupled, its cost-to-income ratio improved markedly, and its profits soared. In 2006 pre-tax profits climbed 16% to £9.2 billion with most of the growth coming from its investment banking business.\n\nHowever, following a shareholder crisis meeting in the midst of a $12bn rights issue, Tom was criticized for \"re-arranging the cosy deck-chairs on the sinking titanic\", and Goodwin was criticised by RBS shareholders for selling shares at half the price of the shareholder's given value. Having nearly trebled between February 2000 and May 2002 the share price halved from 2006 to 2008. It had lost 95% of its value by 2009. Goodwin was accused of megalomania by some shareholders, as reported by Dresdner Kleinwort analyst James Eden (who said he thought the label was 'unwarranted'). After the Bank of China deal, he was forced to promise RBS shareholders he would not indulge in any further big acquisitions and focus instead on growing the group organically.\n\nHowever, in early 2007, the Dutch bank ABN AMRO was under pressure from hedge funds, including Chris Hohn of the hedge fund TCI, to break itself up to maximise shareholder value. ABN chief executive Rijkman Groenink suspected RBS of acting in concert with the hedge fund \"Tosca\", which was chaired by former RBS chairman Mathewson and recommended the takeover bid of an RBS consortium for €71 billion, against the proposed merger with Barclays Bank for €61 billion. Goodwin arranged a consortium of RBS, Fortis and former RBS shareholders Grupo Santander, to purchase the assets of ABN AMRO and break them up in a three-way split. According to the proposed deal, RBS would take over ABN's Chicago operations, LaSalle Bank, and ABN's wholesale operations; while Santander would take the Brazilian operations and Fortis would take the Dutch operations. In a manoeuvre \"labelled in all quarters as a poison pill\" ABN AMRO agreed to sell key RBS target LaSalle to Bank of America for $21bn, but in July 2007 the consortium offered the same $98bn for ABN's remaining assets, with a higher cash component (93%).\n\nThe deal was struck in October 2007 as the global liquidity crisis began to develop, with Barclays withdrawing its EUR61bn bid and ABN's shareholders endorsing the EUR71bn RBS takeover. Coming after the nationalisation of Northern Rock due to the freezing of the wholesale money markets, the deal proved the final straw for RBS, as it severely weakened its balance sheet not only through the size of the acquisition but due to ABN AMRO's substantial exposure to the US subprime mortgage crisis.\n\nWhile at RBS, the value of the bank's shares fell below a quarter of their level in early 2007. Following criticism from the press for the takeover of ABN AMRO and the UK government having to bail out the bank, McKillop announced his early retirement as Chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland on 13 October 2008. At a meeting of the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons on 10 February 2009, he admitted to having no qualifications in banking. Like the retired bankers present, he apologised for the bankruptcy for RBS.\n\nMcKillop married Elizabeth Kettle in 1966 and has three children.\n\n\n\n"}

It was a property of Grupo CIE. Billed as \"where kids can do what they wanna do,\" it was a child-sized representation of a metropolis where children aged 2–14 could participate in different careers and other lifelike activities. The concept of the theme park was taken from the KidZania concept, which was brought by Luis Javier Laresgoti five years after the KidZania concept was taken in 1996. However, Kidzania and Wannado City lost ownership interests in 2004, and when Wannado City opened, both parties went separate ways.\n\nCareers in which the \"kidizens\" could participate included but were not limited to firefighter, police officer, lawyer, physician, TV reporter, singer, actor, and model. They could also use issued money, \"Wongas\", to set up bank accounts.\n\nDue to financial problems, alongside lack of business, Wannado City was sold by Stampler Auctions on January 11, 2011. Wannado City closed on January 12, 2011 and was replaced by a new wing of stores called \"Fashion Row\" in 2013. \n\nThe system functioned by the idea of participation in different activities, gaining capital and spending their earnings in luxurious locations such as the Wonka Factory, The Coca-Cola Bottling Plant, a Publix supermarket, the Wannado City Fair and a permanent circus. Guests were granted 150 Wongas upon their arrival, and were awarded 20 Wongas for each activity. There were also ATMs where guests could withdraw money or make a deposit at a State Farm bank, so that guests would not have to carry their money around. Children were given \"ATM cards\" so that they are able to deposit and withdraw more efficiently. The \"ATM cards\" were discontinued in 2006.\n\nThe city hosted numerous job occupations available for selection. Children could star in their own television newscast, join the city's fire or police department, the Miami Herald and the Spirit Airlines Flight Academy. The city also hosted a theater, circus, hospital, movie studio, recording studio, courthouse, bakery, dentistry office, public park, library, mine, and an archaeological/paleontological site, among other locations.\n\nUpon arrival, the children and parents were given RFID security bracelets. Throughout the park there were computer stands where a person would place their bracelet against a scanner and details of any known individual's location were shown.\n"}
{"id": "2334148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334148", "title": "Formwork", "text": "Formwork\n\nFormwork is temporary or permanent molds into which concrete or similar materials are poured. In the context of concrete construction, the falsework supports the shuttering molds.\n\nFormwork comes in several types: \n\nSome of the earliest examples of concrete slabs were built by Roman engineers. Because concrete is quite strong in resisting compressive loads, but has relatively poor tensile or torsional strength, these early structures consisted of arches, vaults and domes. The most notable concrete structure from this period is the Pantheon in Rome. To mould this structure, temporary scaffolding and formwork or falsework was built in the future shape of the structure. These building techniques were not isolated to pouring concrete, but were and are widely used in masonry. Because of the complexity and the limited production capacity of the building material, concrete’s rise as a favored building material did not occur until the invention of Portland cement (and developments by the Edison Portland Cement Company) and reinforced concrete.\n\nSimilar to the traditional method, but stringers and joist are replaced with engineered wood beams and supports are replaced with adjustable metal props. This makes this method more systematic and reusable.\n\nOn the dawn of the rival of concrete in slab structures, building techniques for the temporary structures were derived again from masonry and carpentry. The traditional slab formwork technique consists of supports out of lumber or young tree trunks, that support rows of stringers assembled roughly 3 to 6 feet or 1 to 2 metres apart, depending on thickness of slab. Between these stringers, joists are positioned roughly 12 inches, 30 centimeters apart upon which boards or plywood are placed. The stringers and joists are usually 4 by 4 inch or 4 by 6 inch lumber. The most common imperial plywood thickness is ¾ inch and the most common metric thickness is 18 mm.\n\nSimilar to the traditional method, but stringers and joist are replaced with aluminium forming systems or steel beams and supports are replaced with metal props. This also makes this method more systematic and reusable. Aluminum beams are fabricated as telescoping units which allows them to span supports that are located at varying distances apart. Telescoping aluminium beams can be used and reused in the construction of structures of varying size.\n\nThese systems consist of prefabricated timber, steel or aluminum beams and formwork modules. Modules are often no larger than 3 to 6 feet or 1 to 2 metres in size. The beams and formwork are typically set by hand and pinned, clipped, or screwed together. The advantages of a modular system are: does not require a crane to place the formwork, speed of construction with unskilled labor, formwork modules can be removed after concrete sets leaving only beams in place prior to achieving design strength.\n\nThese systems consist of slab formwork \"tables\" that are reused on multiple stories of a building without being dismantled. The assembled sections are either lifted per elevator or \"flown\" by crane from one story to the next. Once in position the gaps between the tables or table and wall are filled with \"fillers\". They vary in shape and size as well as their building material. The use of these systems can greatly reduce the time and manual labor involved in setting and striking the formwork. Their advantages are best used by large area and simple structures. It is also common for architects and engineers to design building around one of these systems.\nA table is built pretty much the same way as a beam formwork but the single parts of this system are connected together in a way that makes them transportable. The most common sheathing is plywood, but steel and fiberglass are also in use. The joists are either made from timber, wood I-beams, aluminium or steel. The stringers are sometimes made of wood I-beams but usually from steel channels. These are fastened together (screwed, weld or bolted) to become a \"deck\". These decks are usually rectangular but can also be other shapes.\n\nAll support systems have to be height adjustable to allow the formwork to be placed at the correct height and to be removed after the concrete is cured. Normally adjustable metal props similar to (or the same as) those used by beam slab formwork are used to support these systems. Some systems combine stringers and supports into steel or aluminum trusses. Yet other systems use metal frame shoring towers, which the decks are attached to. Another common method is to attach the formwork decks to previously cast walls or columns, thus eradicating the use of vertical props altogether. In this method, adjustable support shoes are bolted through holes (sometimes tie holes) or attached to cast anchors.\n\nThe size of these tables can vary from . There are two general approaches in this system:\n\nThis technique is fairly common in the United States and east Asian countries. The advantages of this approach are the further reduction of manual labour time and cost per unit area of slab and a simple and systematic building technique. The disadvantages of this approach are the necessary high lifting capacity of building site cranes, additional expensive crane time, higher material costs and little flexibility.\n\nBy this approach the tables are limited in size and weight. Typical widths are between , typical lengths are between , though table sizes may vary in size and form. The major distinction of this approach is that the tables are lifted either with a crane transport fork or by material platform elevators attached to the side of the building. They are usually transported horizontally to the elevator or crane lifting platform singlehandedly with shifting trolleys depending on their size and construction. Final positioning adjustments can be made by trolley. This technique enjoys popularity in the US, Europe and generally in high labor cost countries. The advantages of this approach in comparison to beam formwork or modular formwork is a further reduction of labor time and cost. Smaller tables are generally easier to customize around geometrically complicated buildings, (round or non rectangular) or to form around columns in comparison to their large counterparts. The disadvantages of this approach are the higher material costs and increased crane time (if lifted with crane fork).\n\nTunnel forms are large, room size forms that allows walls and floors to be cast in a single pour. With multiple forms, the entire floor of a building can be done in a single pour. Tunnel forms require sufficient space exterior to the building for the entire form to be slipped out and hoisted up to the next level. A section of the walls is left uncasted to remove the forms. Typically castings are done with a frequency of 4 days. Tunnel forms are most suited for buildings that have the same or similar cells to allow re-use of the forms within the floor and from one floor to the next, in regions which have high labor prices.\n\nSee structural coffer.\n\n\nThere is an increasing focus on sustainability in design, backed up by carbon dioxide emissions reduction targets. The low embodied energy of concrete by volume is offset by its rate of consumption which make the manufacture of cement accountable for some 5% of global CO2 emissions.\n\nConcrete is a fluid that offers the opportunity to economically create structures of almost any geometry - concrete can be poured into a mould of almost any shape. This fluidity is seldom used, with concrete instead being poured into rigid moulds to create high material use structures with large carbon footprints. The ubiquitous use of orthogonal moulds as concrete formwork has resulted in a well-established vocabulary of prismatic forms for concrete structures, yet such rigid formwork systems must resist considerable pressures and consume significant amounts of material. Moreover, the resulting member requires more material and has a greater self-weight than one cast with a variable cross section.\n\nSimple optimisation methods may be used to design a variable cross section member in which the flexural and shear capacity at any point along the element length reflects the requirements of the loading envelope applied to it.\n\nBy replacing conventional moulds with a flexible system composed primarily of low cost fabric sheets, flexible formwork takes advantage of the fluidity of concrete to create highly optimised, architecturally interesting, building forms. Significant material savings can be achieved. The optimised section provides ultimate limit state capacity while reducing embodied carbon, thus improving the life cycle performance of the entire structure.\n\nControl of the flexibly formed beam cross section is key to achieving low-material use design. The basic assumption is that a sheet of flexible, permeable fabric is held in a system of falsework before reinforcement and concrete are added. By varying the geometry of the fabric mould with distance along the beam, the optimised shape is created. Flexible formwork therefore has the potential to facilitate the change in design and construction philosophy that will be required for a move towards a less material intensive, more sustainable, construction industry. Its potential is further demonstrated in work by Lee.\n\nFabric formwork is a small niche in concrete technology. It uses soft, flexible materials against the fresh concrete as formwork, normally with some sort of strong tension textile or plastic material. The International Society of Fabric Forming conducts research on fabric formwork.\n\nFor removable forms, once the concrete has been poured into formwork and has set (or \"cured\"), the formwork is \"struck\" or \"stripped\" (removed) to expose the finished concrete. The time between pouring and formwork stripping depends on the job specifications, the cure required, and whether the form is supporting any weight, but is usually at least 24 hours after the pour is completed. For example, the California Department of Transportation requires the forms to be in place for 1–7 days after pouring, while the Washington State Department of Transportation requires the forms to stay in place for 3 days with a damp blanket on the outside.\nSpectacular accidents have occurred when the forms were either removed too soon or had been under-designed to carry the load imposed by the weight of the uncured concrete. Less critical and much more common (though no less embarrassing and often costly) are those cases in which under-designed formwork bends or breaks during the filling process (especially if filled with a high-pressure concrete pump). This then results in fresh concrete escaping out of the formwork in a \"form blowout\", often in large quantities.\n\nConcrete exerts less pressure against the forms as it hardens. The hardening is an asymptotic process, meaning that most of the final strength will be achieved after a short time, though some further hardening can occur depending on the cement type and admixtures.\n\nWet concrete also applies hydrostatic pressure to formwork. The pressure at the bottom of the form is therefore greater than at the top. In the illustration of the column formwork to the right, the 'column clamps' are closer together at the bottom. Note that the column is braced with steel adjustable 'formwork props' and uses 20 mm 'through bolts' to further support the long side of the column.\n\n\n\n"}

Roman vestiges have been found as well, but not in quantities nor concentrations such as to warrant conclusively identifying Fossato with the ancient \"Helvillum\", the site of which remains unknown: the other main candidate is Sigillo.\n\nFossato is known, however, to have been inhabited in the early Middle Ages, when it was the southernmost outpost of the Byzantine corridor, which its name seems to confirm: while \"fossato\", meaning \"ditch\" in Italian, is not an uncommon placename, it is usually found on small creeks — but Fossato di Vico is on sharply sloping ground with no watercourse in the area, and it has therefore been proposed by local historians that the name is to be derived from Latin (and Byzantine Greek) \"fossatum\", a ditch-fortified defensive work.\n\nThe specification \"di Vico\" was added to the name in 1862, to remember a noble of the Duchy of Spoleto. Fossato was part of the county of Nocera in the 9th century, and after the Vico it was a possession of the Bulgarelli family, who built the current castle. In 1386 it became a free commune, which was annexed to the Papal States in 1540.\n\nIn the plain below, two Roman bridges are extant; both relate to the Via Flaminia.\n\nThe town walls date to the late Middle Ages and would be of no particular interest were it not for a covered rampart walk capable of accommodating wide carts: it was designed for supplying the town in case of a siege. A very ruined tower at the top of the town is lovingly preserved as the oldest structure, and is said by some to be Byzantine, but without evidence.\n\nThe main churches are \"S. Sebastiano\", the 16th‑century parish church, damaged in the 1997 Umbria and Marche earthquake but almost immediately restored; S. Pietro, the former parish church, medieval; S. Benedetto, also medieval, with some frescoes; and La Piaggiola, a small votive chapel of uncertain use, but likely belonging to a penitential confraternity: on its walls are to be found the best medieval frescoes in town.\n\nAlso in the plain, mention should be made of the shrine of the Madonna della Ghea.\n\nThe economic engine of the \"comune\" is the \"frazione\" of Osteria del Gatto, in the plain below, with several factories (cheese, packaging materials). An unusual aspect of the town's economy is that the municipal government has taken advantage of the winds sweeping the Cima del Mutali to contract the construction of two windmills for electrical generation; Fossato is a net exporter of electrical energy, and the installation turns a profit used for the operations of local government.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball as a third baseman from to . Cross played most of his 21-year career with Philadelphia-based teams in four different leagues. One of the sport's top all-around players in the years surrounding the turn of the 20th century, when he retired he ranked fifth in major league history in hits (2,644) and runs batted in (1,371), ninth in doubles (411) and total bases (3,466), and third in games played (2,275) and at bats (9,064). \n\nCross also excelled as a defensive player. After beginning his major league career as a catcher, he led third basemen in fielding percentage five times, and ended his career with nearly every fielding record at that position: games (1,721), putouts (2,306), assists (3,706), total chances (6,406), and fielding average (.938); his 212 double plays ranked third behind Billy Nash and Arlie Latham. He captained the Philadelphia Athletics teams which captured two of the first five American League pennants.\n\nBorn in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Lave Cross began his career as a secondary catcher and occasional outfielder with the - Louisville Colonels. His contract was sold to the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association for the 1889 season, and he jumped to the Philadelphia Quakers of the Players' League in before returning to the AA team in . That season he saw his first regular play, splitting time in the outfield and behind the plate, and also playing at third base for the first time; in addition, he batted .301 and finished fifth in the league in slugging average. \n\nAfter the American Association's merger with the National League in 1892, he joined the Philadelphia Phillies from 1892 through 1897. In his first two years he played as a catcher and third baseman, while in the last two years he played primarily at third with substantial play as a second baseman and shortstop. Playing exclusively at third in 1895, he led the NL in assists and fielding average for the first time. He also became a solid hitter, batting a career-high .386 with 125 RBI and 123 runs in ; on April 24 of that year, he hit for the cycle. During this period, major league rules did not restrict the size of infielders' gloves, and he continued to use his catcher's mitt in the field; on August 5, he set a still-standing record at second base with 15 assists in a 12-inning game.\n\nHe was traded to the St. Louis Browns after the 1897 season, and responded with an campaign in which he hit .317 – the first of seven straight seasons at .290 or better – and finished among the league leaders in hits, doubles and total bases, while again leading the NL in assists and fielding average. Before the 1899 season, the Browns were purchased by the owner of the competing Cleveland Spiders and renamed the Perfectos. The new owners promptly shifted almost all the best players on both teams to St. Louis, with Cleveland being used as a de facto farm club; Cross was sent to Cleveland in the thankless role of player-manager, but was returned to St. Louis after an 8-30 start. Cleveland played even worse afterwards, ending the season at 20-134 and being promptly dissolved, later becoming known as the worst club in major league history. Cross hit .303 after returning to St. Louis, and led the NL in double plays and fielding. In May 1900 his contract was sold to the Brooklyn Superbas, who went on to win the pennant. After over a dozen years on second-rate teams, during which his club managed only a pair of third-place finishes, the move to a championship team was most welcome, and he ended the season among the NL's top ten in RBI (73) while leading the league in fielding for the fourth time.\n\nWith the elevation of the American League to major league status in , many stars from the NL saw an opportunity to move away from that league's longstanding turmoil and rowdiness. Cross jumped to the Athletics franchise in the new league and became one of the veteran leaders on Connie Mack's club. As team captain, he batted .328, and was among the AL leaders in batting, slugging and doubles. In he improved his average to .342 and was among the league's top three players in hits (191), doubles (39) and RBI (108) as the Athletics won the pennant; the 108 RBI were a record for a player without any home runs. On April 23 of that year he began a streak of 447 consecutive games (all but one of them at third base), then one of the ten longest in history, which ended on May 8, . In each of the next two seasons he hit .290 or better while ending the year in the top ten in hits and RBI, and in 1905 he finished second in the league with 77 RBI at age 39 as the team won another pennant. But in the 1905 World Series, batting cleanup, he collected only two singles in the five games as the Athletics were crushed by the New York Giants, being shut out three times by Christy Mathewson and outscored 15-3.\n\nIn January 1906 he was sent to the Washington Senators; he led the league in fielding average for the fifth time at age 40, and ended his career in after hitting .199 in 41 games. Over 21 seasons he batted .292 with 1333 runs, 47 home runs and 135 triples, in addition to the totals noted above. His hit total ranked second among right-handed batters behind Cap Anson. In he surpassed Arlie Latham's record of 1571 career games at third base; Pie Traynor broke the record in . His records for career putouts and total chances were broken by Jimmy Collins in ; but his assists record stood until , when Eddie Mathews broke it. His career fielding average was topped in the late 1910s by several players.\n\nCross was later employed as a machinist, and died of a heart attack at age 61 while walking to work in Toledo, Ohio. His older brother Amos Cross was a major league catcher from 1885 to 1887, and his younger brother Frank Cross played one game as a right fielder for the 1901 Cleveland Blues.\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

With others he invested in the New World. While he remained in Europe, his offspring became wealthy land owners and were involved in New York politics. \n\nDe Bruce was once a resort town, catering to fly fishermen. George LeBranch, author of \"The Dry Fly and Fast Water\" in 1914, who had his home in De Bruce, famously cast his first dry fly there. The De Bruce Club Inn, first owned by Charles B. Ward and then by Walter Kocher since the early 1940s, was also there. The Inn offered a nine-hole golf course, tennis courts and fishing on several miles of the choicest water on the upper Willowemoc. It had its own farm, fish hatchery, hydroelectric plant, private area telephone system, and later TV cable. Movies were shown on weekends. During its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s it was a popular destination for sportsmen from the city, famous for its food and smiling hostesses, and Chef Cesar Ricci. Chef Ricci would oversee its grand formal picnics at both Little Falls and at Mongaup Pond with tables, linens, and flatware with animals spit roasted whole.\n\nIn the early 1900s one of LeBranch's favorite dry flies was called the pink lady—pale pink floss ribbed with gold tinsel, duck wings, ginger hackle and tail on a #12 hook. Amusingly, a favorite drink at the Inn was also called the pink lady—gin, grenadine, apple brandy, lemon juice and cracked ice, strained into a stemmed glass. It was also popular with parents of children at the many area summer camps.\n\nThe main Inn was torn down in 1970 by its current owners, the Kocher family. The Auditorium and several hotel buildings still stand. The De Bruce Fly Fishing Club leases what was the Fishermans'Cottage, the hatchery and the several miles of Willowemoc. The properties are currently owned and operated by the Kocher family.\n\nThe New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has run the De Bruce Environmental Education Camp, for youth who are 12 to 14 years old in De Bruce. Situated on over of land adjoining the Catskill Forest Preserve, Camp De Bruce has been in operation since 1948. Formerly a private estate and fish hatchery, the De Bruce Camp was acquired by the DEC in the 1940s and converted into a conservation education camp for boys. In 1975, Camp De Bruce began operation as a co-educational facility. Other area camps during the hotel's heyday were Camp Acadia and Our Lady of Lourdes Camp for Girls, and Hunter Camp.\n\nDe Bruce was, in its earliest days, a site for one of the Catskills' largest tanneries, employing over 100 men shortly after it was established in 1856. This industry relied on the easy availability of water and hemlock trees, about 5% of the forests. The trees were cut down and their bark, one of the cheapest supplies of tannin available, was peeled off, leaving the timber to rot. The leather was processed in factories near the water and often actually in the forest. The industry quickly depleted the trees, peaking in about 1870, and was entirely gone from the Catskills by 1895, much to the relief of the trout fishermen, no doubt. Bald Mt. in De Bruce was so named because it was left that way by the tanneries.\n\nThe one remaining hotel in De Bruce is De Bruce Country Inn.\n\nToday, the town is renowned for its \"De Bruce Family Labor Day Parade\". Held annually since 1993, it brings the entire community (many, if not most, summer people) out to celebrate the Autumn harvest, the end of summer, or just to be together one more year. It is ably organized by Steve Dill (pictured) who enthusiastically energizes his friends and neighbors into a frenzy of speech-making, face-painting, dancing, games, food, costumes and assorted show-and-tells. Often there is a King or Queen of the parade—Floyd Cook, the 100-year-old \"Mayor of the Hill\" has had this honor several times. Unfortunately, Cook died in August 2012. An unusual feature of the parade is its shortness. The course, it starts in Dill's front yard, and stretches over about one city block, which is considerably shorter than the line of marchers and vehicles in it.\n\nIn 2007 it had a \"green\" theme and even had two aircraft \"buzz\" the parade. While the parade was not held in 2009, it returned in 2010 with a theme of \"Books, Bubbles and Balloons.\" In 2011, the theme was \"Fun, Food, and Fitness\", while in 2012, it was \"Cars, Crafts, and Country\". 2012 had the biggest turnout for the De Bruce parade since the start of the tradition. There were 50 antique cars, numerous organizations, businesses, a firetruck, and the MountainTones marching band. The band got its start at the De Bruce parade, and has played at many other events and parades around Sullivan County.\n\nSince 2010, the De Bruce parade has been held as a fundraiser for the Livingston Manor Free Library, which is located about 6 miles away from the parade site.\n\n\nhttp://livingstonmanor.net/JoelKimball/Joel_Kimball_Diary_November_1874.htm\n"}

{"id": "2334156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334156", "title": "Batman Begins (video game)", "text": "Batman Begins (video game)\n\nBatman Begins is a stealth action-adventure game. It was released June 14, 2005, a day before the release of \"Batman Begins\". It was developed by Eurocom and published by Electronic Arts in conjunction with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and DC Comics. It was released on Game Boy Advance, GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The film's original cast provided a voice-over reprisal in the game, with the exception of Gary Oldman, who portrays James Gordon, replaced by Gavin Hammon.\n\nA PlayStation Portable version of the game was planned, but subsequently canceled. A sequel, \"\", was developed for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 but later canceled.\n\nThe game has a unique system involving intimidation. \"Batman Begins\" features the utilization of the environment to frighten opponents, which may cause them to drop their weapons. Certain gadgets designed to frighten enemies during combat are provided, such as smoke grenades, flash bang grenades, and an 'HF Transponder', which summons bats to gather around and incapacitate enemies with fear. On top of this is traditional stealth gameplay reminiscent of the \"Splinter Cell\" series, such as sneaking. There are many ways to incapacitate enemies with stealth, using various combat and martial arts techniques. The game also includes combat racing sections where the player can drive the Batmobile.\n\nThe game follows the movie's plot very closely, with minor modifications. Throughout the game there are over 20 clips from the film that give context to the story. Though it follows the movie, the game goes deeper into each scene. For example, at the docks, the player learns specifically how Falcone was hoisted on a crane and how Batman infiltrated Arkham Asylum. It also presents a slightly alternate ending; Batman is forced to detonate the Batmobile in order to destroy the monorail tracks and stop Ra's Al Ghul from reaching Wayne Tower with the Microwave Emitter, whereas in the film, Sergeant Gordon uses the Batmobile's missiles to destroy the tracks. Two members of the film's crew make cameo appearances in the game; Wally Pfister, the film's director of photography, appears as a mob informant Batman interrogates, and Emma Thomas, producer of the film, appears as an Arkham psychologist. The only scene in the game that is not taken from the film is a second car chase with the Tumbler in which Batman attempts and fails to stop the theft of the microwave emitter that Ra's Al Ghul will use in his attack on Gotham.\n\nReviews of the game found it generally average. GameRankings gave it a score of 62.14% for the Game Boy Advance version, 66.74% for the GameCube version, 65.63% for the PlayStation 2 version, and 67.20% for the Xbox version. Likewise, Metacritic gave it a score of 61 out of 100 for the GBA version, 66 out of 100 for the GameCube version, 64 out of 100 for the PS2 version, and 65 out of 100 for the Xbox version. It received G4's award for 'Best Graphics on PS2 and Xbox'.\n\nMany criticized the linear gameplay, framerate issues and the unrealistic artificial intelligence whereas the sound design, voice acting and overall presentation were generally praised. GameSpot mentioned that it felt like a combination of several other popular games such as , and Burnout 3.\n\nOn July 17, 2008, actor Gary Oldman unofficially announced during an interview with G4's Kristin Adams that a video game sequel of the \"Batman Begins\" video game based on the second film of the franchise was in development. In his interview on GameTrailers, Oldman said he knew an awful lot of effort had gone into getting Batman's gliding abilities to feel suitably smooth and fluid for \"\" game. Oldman, who reprised his role as Lt. Jim Gordon, did not name a developer in the interview but anonymous sources reported that \"The Dark Knight\" was a secret project of Pandemic Studios and EA.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 566. It is situated approximately north from Billinghay and north-east from the town of Sleaford.\n\nAccording to \"A Dictionary of British Place Names\", Walcott is derived from the Old English 'walh' with 'cot', which means \"cottage(s) of the Britons\".\n\nIn the \"Domesday Book\" account the settlement is written as \"Walecote\", and was in the Langoe Hundred of Kesteven. In 1086 Walcott contained twenty-five households, seven freemen and two smallholders, land for four plough teams, and a meadow. In 1066 lordship of the manor was held by Hemming of Branston, this transferred to Walter D'Aincourt in 1086, who was also Tenant-in-chief to William I.\nThe Gilbertine Catley Priory of St Mary was founded between 1146 and 1154; and dissolved in 1538. No sign of the priory can now be seen, but the site is scheduled.\n\nWalcott is recorded in the 1872 \"White's Directory\" as a hamlet of Billinghay parish, part the Langoe wapentake, and near the Car Dyke navigation. The hamlet had a population of 609 within a land area of which stretched eastwards to the River Witham. The fenland between the hamlet and the Witham had been enclosed in 1799 and was \"well drained and cultivated\". The land was in the possession of various local families, but had been, between 1780 and 1787, held by William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam. At the enclosure, the tithes - typically one-tenth of the produce or profits of the land given to the rector for his services - were commuted to an allotment of to support the ecclesiastical parish vicar. An \"ancient\" St Oswald's chapel of ease began decaying in 1776, and was replaced in 1852 by a new chapel, built by subscription in Early English style, the curacy of which was attached to Billinghay vicarage. A Wesleyan chapel had been built in 1820.\n\nTwo \"ancient\" trees, one of of wood, were dug up at Walcott Dales (near the River Witham), in 1811; an axe was also discovered, by which one of the trees was \"supposed to have been felled\". In 1817 \"several\" tumuli were found, one of them containing coffins and human bones. About half a mile west of the hamlet was reported the former Catley Priory, founded by Peter de Billinghay during the 12th-century reign of King Steven for nuns and brethren of the Gilbertine Order, and which at the 16th-century Suppression of the Monasteries was given to Robert Carre of Sleaford. The priory stood on of ground, which, when investigated in 1791, revealed \"several\" gravestones, human bones and pieces of painted glass.\n\nTrades listed at Walcott in 1872 included two shoemakers, two joiners, one of whom was also a wheelwright, a blacksmith, and a cattle salesman. There were thiry-six farmers, one of whom was also a grocer, draper & baker, another also a draper, one running a beerhouse, one a butcher, and one also the licensed victualler of the Black Horse public house. There were two beerhouse licensees, one of whom was also a carrier; he and a further carrier—transporter by wagon of goods and occasionally people between centres of trade—operated between the village and both Sleaford and Lincoln.\n\nThe parish church is a Grade II listed building of red brick dedicated to Saint Oswald and built in 1852. It was presumably named after a previous chapel at Walcott, dedicated to Saint Oswald, and given by King John to Spalding Priory. The previous chapel stood in the centre of the village and was pulled down around 1790\n\nAs at 2010, Walcott has one public house, The Plough, and a primary school; the school caters for Walcott children and has study links with Martin village primary school away.\n\nThe countryside around Walcott is of agricultural use, with sheep farming and the growing of potatoes being prominent.\n\n"}
{"id": "2334169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334169", "title": "Brown Hotel (Louisville, Kentucky)", "text": "Brown Hotel (Louisville, Kentucky)\n\nThe Brown Hotel is a historic 16-story hotel in downtown Louisville, Kentucky, U.S., located on the corner of Fourth and Broadway. It contains 294 rooms and over 24,000 ft² of meeting space. It also contains special amenities, such as a fitness center and three restaurants. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Brown Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\n\nThe hotel which featured 600 rooms, ballrooms, shoppes, meeting rooms, and restaurants, was designed by Preston J. Bradshaw and opened in 1923, only 10 months after construction began. The hotel cost $4 million, and was funded and owned by James Graham Brown, a local entrepreneur who wanted to compete with The Seelbach Hotel just a few blocks down the street. The hotel quickly became a central part of the growing downtown Louisville economy and the social lives of the locals.\n\nIn 1926 the hotel chef Fred K. Schmidt introduced the Hot Brown sandwich, consisting of an open-faced turkey sandwich with bacon with a delicate Mornay sauce. The Hot Brown became rather popular among locals and visitors alike. The sandwich was featured on the 2002 PBS documentary \"Sandwiches That You Will Like\".\n\nMany famous people have visited the hotel in the past and present. David Lloyd George, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, was the first person to sign the guest register, and Queen Marie of Romania also visited. The famous soprano Lily Pons was allowed to bring her pet lion along with her, and it roamed free in her room. Actor Victor Mature was an elevator operator at the hotel before becoming famous; he lost his job after abandoning his post at the elevator and leaving a simple note so that he could go dance with a girl during one of the hotel's many roof-top parties. \n\nThe combination of Prohibition and the Great Depression led to hard times for the hotel in the early 1930s. The Brown defaulted on its loan, and the bank threatened foreclosure. Employees were asked to work for periods without pay, and the Brown was only able to stay open due to the employees' willingness to do so.\n\nWhen the 1937 Flood hit Louisville, the Brown's first floor was flooded. Although there was no electricity, the hotel stayed open, and many people whose homes were submerged stayed at the hotel. One resident recalled: \"We were rowing down Broadway and there was The Brown Hotel. The doors were open and the place was filled with water so we just rowed our boat in one door, went through the lobby and rowed out another.\" A worker is recorded to have caught a two-pound fish in the lobby. WAVE radio, located on the 15th floor, was the only radio station to remain in operation in its own facilities during the flood.\n\nLike much of the rest of the nation, economic recovery began in the buildup to World War II. Thousands of soldiers passing through from Fort Knox would stay in the area, and the hotel would frequently be filled to capacity. The week of the Kentucky Derby was and still is the most successful week of every year, celebrities such as The Duke of Windsor, Harry Truman, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Crawford, Gene Autry, Eva Marie Saint, and Muhammad Ali have stayed here during this time.\n\nAs the city declined in the 1960s and 1970s, the fortunes of The Brown declined as well. Though $1.5 million was spent in 1965 to modernize the Brown and another downtown hotel, attendance remained low. Then on March 20, 1969, James Graham Brown died, this in turn led to the further decline of the hotel and in 1971 after financial shortfalls The Brown closed. The building was sold to the Louisville Public Schools and became the headquarters for the city school system. When Louisville and Jefferson County schools merged in 1975 the new school system used the county schools' VanHoose Education Center as its headquarters and the Brown Education Center housed other school administrative offices.\n\nThe city of Louisville began to make many moves to revitalize the downtown area in the 1980s. As part of this project the \"Broadway Group\" was formed, which acquired The Brown from Jefferson County Public Schools and began its renovation in 1983. The schools took a toll on the building, however, the grand public rooms were spared and were able to be saved. After the restoration of the hotel it was reopened as a Hilton Hotel. In 1993 the hotel was purchased by the Camberley Hotel Company who furthered the restoration and returned the hotel to its former glory, although the once two-story Bluegrass room became a single story room with three other meeting rooms overhead. Another alteration made to the hotel was the demolition of the dividing wall in every other room thus doubling the size of each guest room and taking the hotel from 600 rooms to its present 293 guest rooms. After the restorations and alterations were completed, Camberley sold the hotel to its present owner, 1859 Historic Hotels LTD based out of Galveston, Texas in 2006.\n\nThe Brown served as location for numerous scenes in the 2005 movie Elizabethtown, directed by Cameron Crowe.\n\n\n"}

In 1969, Atlantic released \"Swiss Movement\", album recorded with saxophonist Eddie Harris and trumpeter Benny Bailey at that year's Montreux Jazz Festival. The album contained the song \"Compared to What\", and both the album and the single reached the \"Billboard\" pop charts. \"Compared to What\" criticized the Vietnam War.

He was head coach of the Oakland Raiders in the team's loss to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl II in early 1968.\n\nRauch's football playing career almost ended before it began. At the age of 14, he was diagnosed with a heart murmur and instructed to give up the sport. Ignoring the dire warnings, Rauch was a three-sport star at Yeadon High School, then put together an outstanding college football career. Earning the starting quarterback slot for the University of Georgia as a true freshman in 1945, he led the Bulldogs to a 36–8–1 record. Included in these victories are four straight bowl game appearances, as well as an undefeated record in 1946. On an individual level, he won first team All American accolades following his senior year in 1948, and left the school as college football's all-time passing leader with 4,044 yards.\n\nRauch was the second overall pick in the 1949 NFL Draft, taken by the Detroit Lions, but then sent to the transplanted New York Bulldogs in exchange for the rights to SMU's Doak Walker. During his first season with the Bulldogs in 1949, Rauch saw action on both sides of the ball, throwing for 169 yards and one touchdown, while also intercepting two passes. The following year, he saw action in eight contests, throwing for 502 yards and six touchdowns, then split time with New York and the Philadelphia Eagles in , combining for 288 yards and one touchdown pass. In 1952, rather than accept a trade to the Pittsburgh Steelers to become a player/coach, he accepted an offer from University of Florida Coach Bob Woodruff to join his staff in Gainesville.\n\nIn 1952, Rauch began his coaching career with the first of two seasons at the University of Florida. After spending the 1954 season at Tulane University, he returned to his alma mater, Georgia, the next year as an assistant for four seasons. In 1959, he headed to West Point, NY as an Army assistant. Three years later, he went back to Tulane for the 1962 campaign.\n\nIn 1963, Rauch moved to the professional level with the AFL's Oakland Raiders. Working under head coach Al Davis as the offensive backs coach, Rauch was the heir apparent and was promoted to head coach in April 1966, when Davis became commissioner of the AFL.\n\nAfter leading the Raiders to an 8–5–1 mark in his first year, Rauch's squad lost just once during the 1967 regular season and faced the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl II in Miami. For his efforts, Rauch was named the AFL Coach of the Year.\n\nIn 1968, the team again flourished during the regular season with a 12–2 mark, defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in a Western Division playoff game, but lost the AFL championship game to the New York Jets. During his three years as head coach, Davis' frequent interference with the day to day coaching role became a source of aggravation for Rauch. On January 16, 1969, Rauch dealt with the problem by resigning from his championship team to become head coach of the struggling Buffalo Bills.\n\nThe shift meant going from one of the sport's top teams to the team that finished with the worst record. However, with the first pick in the 1969 NFL/AFL draft, the Bills selected Heisman Trophy-winning running back O. J. Simpson. Rauch then caused controversy by expecting Simpson to become more than the one-dimensional running back he was at the University of Southern California. He expected Simpson to become an all-around running back, necessary in Professional Football, by also blocking and receiving passes out of the backfield, as Rauch had coached successfully at Oakland. Simpson refused to do these added things and friction began. The media, unaware that Simpson often refused to take extra passing drills, viewing them as 'punishment', began a campaign that Rauch was using Simpson as a decoy, which did not explain the indecisiveness in Simpson's style. Having several aging and many very young players, Buffalo improved by only two games to finish with a 4–10 record in 1969.\n\nFollowing a 3–10–1 record in 1970, Rauch avoided being dismissed, and was seemingly prepared to handle the reins for the upcoming year. However, on July 20, 1971, he abruptly resigned following a heated discussion with team owner Ralph C. Wilson Jr. The source of the argument stemmed from Rauch's comments about former Bills' players Ron McDole and Paul Maguire. Wilson, without any consultation with Rauch, had traded the 31-year-old McDole to the Washington Redskins. Maguire who had become a problem with excessive lack of decorum on the practice field, was not offered a contract for the 1971 season by Rauch. On Rauch's first television show of the 1971 season prior to opening training camp, when asked about McDole, he stated, in loyalty to Wilson, that they traded McDole \"while they could get something in return\" due to his age. When asked why he did not offer Maguire a contract, he commented that all Maguire cared about was \"how to get out of work and when's the next party.\" Training camp opened the next day and later in the week Wilson arrived at camp and indicated that he would issue a statement of support for the players (in spite of the fact that Wilson himself had traded McDole). Rauch said \"if you do that, you can have my resignation\". Wilson accepted.\n\nAfter briefly serving as a scout for the Packers, Rauch was hired on October 10 as quarterback coach of the Eagles. He served in that capacity until the entire staff was fired on December 18, 1972. Less than three weeks later, Rauch was hired as head coach of the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts, leading the team to a playoff berth in his first year. After the team was sold to a new owner and a slow start to begin the 1974 season, Rauch was dismissed on September 4.\n\nReturning to the NFL the following year, Rauch served as backfield coach for the Atlanta Falcons, but then resigned on February 18, 1976, to become offensive coordinator of the expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. That tenure would prove to be short after Rauch had repeated conflicts with head coach John McKay, over McKay's demand to only utilize the I-formation that Rauch felt could not be successful in the NFL. After a successful 334 total yards game against the Dolphins with Rauch and quarterback, Steve Spurrier, calling the plays, McKay commented that there wasn't anything they did in the game that they couldn't have done out of the I-formation. McKay called the plays the next week out of the I with no success, but complained about the offense's performance. Rauch had had enough with McKay and resigned.\n\nThe same day he resigned from Tampa, Rauch returned to Atlanta to work under interim coach Pat Peppler, but the staff was not retained after the team won three of its final nine games.\n\nDesiring to live in the Tampa area, Rauch was intent on at least \"semi-retirement\" in 1977. Later in the same year, Rauch became aware of problems with the football program at a local school, Admiral Farragut Academy in St. Petersburg, Florida. He contacted the school and offered to help find a coach for the then-struggling program. When his search proved fruitless, Rauch felt an obligation to the school, and accepted the position as head coach for one season, on September 10, 1977; during that time, a successor was found. He also served as director of the short-lived Canadian-American Bowl, a postseason all-star game. Rauch also served as a part-time writer for the \"St. Petersburg Independent\", a local newspaper that had him cover his old team, the Raiders, when they reached Super Bowl XV. Upon the arrival of the United States Football League, Rauch returned to professional football as the Tampa Bay Bandits' director of operations.\n\nIn 2003, Rauch was honored for his stellar career in the college ranks when he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nRauch died in 2008 at age eighty in his sleep, possibly due to a heart problem, at his home in Oldsmar, Florida.\n\n"}

It is the sister school to Pretoria Boys High School.\n\nIn the 1880s the South African Republic Government built a Staatsmodelschool on the corner of Skinner and van der Walt Streets and a Staatsmeisjesschool (State Girls' School) on Visagie Street. By January 1900, with the war in full swing, the Staatsmeisjesschool had been commissioned as a hospital, while the Staatsmodelschool had been turned into a prison. Sir Winston Churchill was captured by the Boers and imprisoned in the school building, but managed to make his famous escape from there and took the railroad into Portuguese East Africa (Mozambique).\n\nWith Pretoria under British control, it became apparent to Lord Milner, the Colonial Secretary at the time, that the educational facilities in the city needed attention as there was no secondary school for English-speaking pupils (and it was Milner's intention to anglicise what would become the Transvaal). The Staatsmodelschool was duly refurbished. It was renamed Pretoria High School and became the first of the so-called \"Milner\" schools in the Transvaal, opening on 3 June 1901 with Charles Hope, who also founded Potchefstroom High School for Boys, as headmaster. Initial enrollment was 32 pupils, both boys and girls, which increased to 132 by August of that year. The school was to later become Pretoria Boys High School when the girls left.\n\nMr Hope left 15 months later, along with the girls, who were finally accommodated into the old building of the Staatsmeisjesschool. By October 10, 1902, the school opened as Pretoria High School for Girls. It consisted of four teachers and 126 girls under Edith Aitken, but contrary to the name, taught both primary and secondary school pupils until these two groups were separated in 1905. Girls High moved out to its current Hatfield location on 28 July 1915. The primary school continued to occupy the Staatsmeisjesskool premises and is today known as Hamilton School.\n\nDuring the 2nd World War, the school served the community by supplying items to the needy. This tradition has continued into the present day, with each pupil and staff member annually knitting a jersey, which is given to needy members of the community.\n\nPretoria High School for Girls was designated a \"white\" school during the apartheid era in South Africa. The school was subject to the government's separate development policies resulting in schools segregated according to government determined racial categories. As a progressive school, Girl's High was one of the first white schools to embrace the \"New South Africa\". Even before President De Klerk's call for a new South Africa, Clem Sunter had addressed the \"high road, low road\" vision to integrate. PHSG was the first school under the Transvaal Education Department to open its facilities to pupils from the townships. Teachers here taught Saturday morning classes to 50 standard 9 pupils as part of St Mary's DSG Outreach Program.\n\nIt was amongst one of the first public schools to integrate during the transition period in South Africa from a political system of apartheid to a multiparty, multi-racial democracy. The school hoped to finally, legally realise its multi-racial dimension in its charter (\" earnest hope that here girls of different races and different denominations might meet\") as apartheid began to be dismantled. The first black pupil was admitted to Girls High in 1990 and was the daughter of a Malawian diplomat, SP Kachipande. After that, a student vote where 80% of the students voted for PHSG to transition to an \"open school\" to enable it to admit South Africans from all races. The year after, a few more students from the Malawian embassy enrolled in the school and thereafter South Africans from other races. PHSG became the first white state school in Northern Transvaal (now Gauteng) to open its doors to girls of all races. During this time, the school was under the leadership of Ms. Ann Van Zyl, who later became headmistress of the prestigious St Stithians Girls College in Johannesburg and Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls. By 1994, the school opened its doors to black South African students and became fully integrated. Apartheid was fully dismantled as the legal system in 1994.\n\n\nGirls High is a state school that is supported by influential people and organizations. It includes the children of Minister of finance Pravin Gordhan's and Minister of health Aaron Motsoaledi's daughters. The school has also had patronage from the diplomatic community, including diplomats from Chile, Malawi, Uruguay, and other countries. It was voted by the Pretoria News as the best high school in Pretoria.\n\nPHSG is one of the top schools in Gauteng in academic achievement. They are listed in the department of education's top 100 list. PHSG has a rigorous academic curriculum,from 2004–2009, they have had a 100% Matriculation pass rate. PHSG also won the Most Improved Schools Awards of 2007 together with 10 other schools around the country. They won a prize for Excellence in Mathematics because 138 students attained a higher grade maths pass mark. It is in the top 5 public schools in the province.\n\nIn 2009, the school had a 99.9 percent Matric pass rate. The school has also been recognized as a circle of Excellence School by the Allan Gray Investment Management.\n\nThe motto of the School is \"We work in hope\", and has a Latin equivalent, \"Prosit Spes Labori\".\n\nIn 1936, the school's coat of arms was registered with the Department of the Interior as a \"badge\" under the Protection of Names, Uniforms and Badges Act 1935. In 1990, after slight improvement, it was registered at the Bureau of Heraldry under the Heraldry Act 1962. The registration certificate was presented to the school by Frederick Brownell, the State Herald at that time. The school magazine of that year includes an explanation of the coat of arms. Heraldic practice in English tradition is to depict the arms of unmarried ladies or widows on a lozenge, a diamond shaped shield. The lozenge makes a bold heraldic statement about feminism. By 1990 only three schools, Girton College in Cambridge, St Patricks Girls High School, Canada and PHSG were known to display their arms on lozenges. Nowadays, however, to judge from its website, Girton College displays its arms on a shield.\n\n\nIn August 2016 the school was accused of racial discrimination policies where black students were treated differently from white students. These were policies ranging from black girls being forced to straighten their hair, rules that disallowed afros to being accused of conspiring when standing in groups and speaking in their mother tongue. The black students protested at the school's annual Spring Fair, despite the presence of heavy security. Supporters were urged to use the hashtag #StopRacismAtPretoriaGirlsHigh. This led to a huge outcry on social media and solidarity from the South African public. South African Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa wrote on Twitter: \"Let us continue to assert our Africanness in all spaces so that we can breathe & be truly, fully ourselves.\" Patrick Gaspard, US ambassador to South Africa, also tweeted: \"All societies have rules. And sometimes those rules are biased and need to be exposed and protested.\" An online petition had almost 25,000 signatures within a day. Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi, met with the school management to address the issues. The controversy has been covered internationally by Al Jazeera, the BBC, teleSUR and others.\n\nGirls High alumnae are known as \"Old Girls\" and there are Old Girls chapters in South Africa, Australia and England.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2334190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334190", "title": "Maine Public Broadcasting Network", "text": "Maine Public Broadcasting Network\n\nThe Maine Public Broadcasting Network (abbreviated MPBN and branded Maine Public) is a state network of public television and radio stations located in the state of Maine in the United States. It is operated by the Maine Public Broadcasting Corporation, which holds the licenses for all the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) stations licensed in the state. MPBN has studios and offices in Portland, Lewiston and Bangor. \n\nMPBN's television network shows a block of standard PBS programming, as well as many documentaries including nature programs and other science programs. MPBN's radio network airs news and talk programming from NPR, locally produced news programming, jazz and classical music.\n\nMPBN's television and radio signals reach virtually all of the populated portions of Maine, and nearby parts of New Hampshire and Massachusetts as well as the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec. MPBN Television is also carried on cable television in part of Quebec and most of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, particularly via Bell Aliant Fibe TV.\n\nWhat is now Maine Public dates from the 1992 merger of WCBB, the PBS member station for most of southern Maine, with the original MPBN radio and television stations operated by the University of Maine System.\n\nOn November 13, 1961, Channel 10 WCBB signed on the air, based in Lewiston, as the first educational television station in Maine and the third in New England, after WGBH-TV in Boston and WENH-TV in Durham, New Hampshire. Licensed to Augusta, it was a joint venture of Colby College, Bates College, and Bowdoin College. Two years later, WMEB-TV began broadcasting from the University of Maine campus in Orono, near Bangor. Over the next decade, UMaine signed on three other stations across the state, as well as several translators. These stations formed the original MPBN network. One of them was WMEG-TV in Biddeford, near Portland (now WMEA-TV). However, it was practically unviewable over the air in Portland itself and mainly served communities from South Portland to York. The coverage area was improved when the station switched its digital channel on March 11, 2020.\n\nThe University of Maine System brought public radio to the state in 1970, when WMEH signed on from Bangor. Five other stations signed on over the next decade.\nThe two groups merged on July 1, 1992 to form the community-licensed Maine Public Broadcasting Corporation. MPBN's Bangor stations, WMEB-TV and WMEH (FM), became the flagship stations. The television stations adopted the on-air name \"Maine Public Television\", but dropped this in favor of \"Maine PBS\" in 1998. The radio stations became known as \"Maine Public Radio\". In 2005, both radio and television reverted to the \"MPBN\" moniker. On September 20, 2016, MPBN rebranded as \"Maine Public\".\n\nFollowing the merger, WMEA-TV became the flagship station for a secondary PBS service, Maine Public Television Plus; unlike the main network, this service expanded its over-the-air reach through the use of low-power repeaters—W39BQ in Lewiston, which signed on January 1, 1994, and W30BF in Bangor, which launched on April 16, 1994. Cuts in federal funding led to the elimination of MPT Plus on June 30, 1996; WMEA and W30BF then reverted to carrying the primary Maine Public Television service (though the latter station was sold in 1999 and is now JUCE TV affiliate WCKD-LP), while W39BQ eventually ceased operations.\n\nMPBN's radio service carries a mixed format of news and information from NPR, PRI, and other sources. Local programming includes \"Maine Calling\", an interactive radio program hosted primarily by Jennifer Rooks and produced by Jonathan Smith. Various guests, often from Maine, are invited to participate in the discussion and audience members are encouraged to participate through calling in or through other forms of media. Accompanying NPR's \"All Things Considered,\" is \"Maine Things Considered\", Maine's only daily statewide news program.\n\nIn May 2016, the Maine Public Classical service was launched on the HD2 channels of the primary stations, as well as several new transmitters. The main network was eliminating classical music programming, with a three-hour weekday block between 9 a.m. and noon switching to news and talk shows. But the new network was aimed at giving listeners who enjoyed classical music a channel devoted to it, along with some jazz and other musical genres not usually heard on commercial radio stations.\n\nMPBN's television service carries the basic PBS program schedule, along with a handful of local programs, such as \"The Maine Experience\" (a feature magazine series), \"Maine Watch\" (a weekly public-affairs program), and live coverage of the annual Maine state high-school basketball playoffs.\n\nIn 2000, the live Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts on Saturday afternoons, which had been a mainstay of classical music broadcasting for more than twenty years, was discontinued. Despite Maine Public Broadcasting's claims that the opera was being dropped due to lack of popularity among listeners, a citizens' protest forced the state network to reinstate the Saturday afternoon opera a few months later.\n\nIn the course of 24 months in 2000 and 2001, in what appeared to be a plan to significantly reduce local music programming, longtime classical music hosts Victor Hathaway, Virgil Bissett, Helen York and Dave Bunker left the station. Bissett retired, Bunker moved to southern Maine after his wife gained employment there. Despite Bunker's willingness to continue his popular morning music show from the Portland studios of MPBN, he was let go and Leitha Christie hired in his place. York resigned in protest.\n\nIn May 2005, Maine Public Broadcasting joined a few other PBS stations in showing the controversial \"Sugartime!\" episode of \"Postcards from Buster\". The program (a spinoff of \"Arthur\") is about a cartoon rabbit named Buster Baxter, who travels the country with his father and interacts with children from different cultures and in different family structures. PBS headquarters had pulled the episode from its national broadcast schedule after receiving a critical letter from newly installed Education Secretary Margaret Spellings, who was upset that Buster was visiting a Vermont family headed by two women. WGBH, the Boston-based PBS affiliate and original producer of the program, subsequently made the episode available to stations that still wished to air it on an individual basis.\n\nMaine humorist Robert Skoglund was host of a weekly jazz and humor program called The Humble Farmer on MPBN starting in 1978. The show was canceled in 2007 after a series of disagreements over whether some of Skoglund's comments were in violation of the station's policy of neutrality on political issues. In 2003, in what came to be known as the War Rant, Skoglund spoke about a \"weasely-faced war monger from way down south who didn't even get most of the popular vote,\" identifying the person as the author of Mein Kampf. In 2006, he read passages from Encyclopædia Britannica about Fascism under Mussolini. MPBN management regarded these to be veiled comparisons to George W. Bush and admonished Skoglund to refrain from political commentary. On November 3, 2006 Skoglund submitted a prerecorded program in which he read a letter from a Maryland listener who described the effects of tax cuts in that state. MPBN regarded this as advocating a position on Maine's upcoming Taxpayer Bill of Rights referendum question and chose to not air the program. MPBN VP for Programming, Charles Beck, then sent Skoglund a letter outlining guidelines and warning him that further comments perceived as political would lead to the show's cancellation. Arguing that the strict guidelines were setting him up to fail, Skoglund discontinued all commentaries, speaking only to identify songs and musicians. In 2007, MPBN required on-air staff to sign a revised policy agreement on political neutrality. Skoglund refused to sign and his program was cut June 13, 2007.\n\nIn December 2008, due to the economic crisis and lack of governmental funding, MPBN announced plans on temporarily closing down WMED-TV and -FM in Calais, and WMEF FM in Fort Kent, for at least six months, beginning January 2009. In addition, MPBN's radio and television stations would leave the air for five hours each night, as an energy saving measure. However, many viewers and listeners complained to MPBN for their actions. Another concern is for MPBN's role as the state's primary carrier for the Emergency Alert System, which will be hampered during the times it is not on the air, as well as in areas where aerial service has been discontinued.\n\nIn part of the response from viewers and listeners in the affected regions, MPBN delayed their closures until February 28, 2009, at earliest. On February 12, 2009, MPBN officially rescinded plans to close down the transmitters, after responses from its viewers and listeners, as well as stakeholders, legislators, and then-Governor John Baldacci.\n\nIn 2012, Governor Paul LePage proposed eliminating all state funding for MPBN from the budget, referring to such aid as \"corporate welfare\". The Republican-controlled Legislature rejected this proposal and instead passed a budget directing MPBN funding be changed to a fee-for-service model instead of a general appropriation over the next five years.\n\nMPBN operates 5 full-power television stations:\n\nNotes:\n\nMPBN also operates 3 translator stations:\nMPBN's digital channels are multiplexed:\n\nOn October 27, 2010, MPBN added PBS World programming to its .3 subchannel and in late 2014 replaced its SD feed on its .2 subchannel with Create. Both had been offered for several years on Time Warner Cable, which is available to a large number of subscribers throughout Maine. For the 2013 & 2014 Maine Legislature sessions, Maine Capitol Connection was on the .4 subchannel, replacing the PBS Kids children's programming.\n\nOut of the 5 full power signals operated by MPBN, WMEA-TV is the only one required to change channels as part of the repack. The only UHF full power signal will be changing from RF channel 45 to channel 36. The station is scheduled to be completed and on the new channel, by March 13, 2020.\n\nMPBN operates ten radio transmitters and four translators. Seven transmitters broadcast an FM signal and HD1 and HD2 channels. FM on those seven channels and HD1 is Maine Public Radio programming. HD2, WBQF, WBQE, WBQA and the four translators are dedicated to Maine Public Classical, which contains a large amount of Classical 24 and other classical and music programming.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "2334197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334197", "title": "Flunixin", "text": "Flunixin\n\nFlunixin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), analgesic, and antipyretic used in horses, cattle and pigs. It is often formulated as the meglumine salt. In the United States, it is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and may only be lawfully distributed by order of a licensed veterinarian. There are many trade names for the product.\n\nFlunixin is administered at a dose of 1.1 mg/kg. The full analgesic and antipyretic effects usually occur 1–2 hours following treatment, but there is often an effective analgesic effect within approximately 15 minutes. Despite its short plasma half life of 1.6-2.5 hours, effects can persist for up to 30 hours, with maximal effects occurring between 2 and 16 hours. This is likely due to accumulation of the drug at inflammatory foci. Flunixin is primarily eliminated by the kidneys.\n\nBecause it targets the inflamed tissue, flunixin is mainly used for colic pain, musculoskeletal pain, and ocular pain. It is also used as an antipyretic and to reduce the effects of endotoxemia.\n\nFlunixin is labeled for no more than 5 days of consecutive use and prolonged use increases the risk of toxicity. In horses, this includes gastric ulcers, right dorsal colitis, and nephrotoxicity.\n\nFlunixin is a prohibited substance under International Federation for Equestrian Sports rules, and its use is prohibited or restricted by many other equestrian organizations. At labeled dose (1.1 mg/kg) given IV, detection time was found to be 144 hours. However, drug recycling from bedding contamination by treated horses has been shown to potentially increase the clearance time.\n\nFlunixin may be given orally as a paste or as granules in feed. It can also be used intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV). However, it is very irritating to tissue and IM administration has been associated with myonecrosis in horses, so IV administration is preferred.\n\nAdministration of phenylbutazone to a horse also receiving flunixin has been shown to increase the risk of toxicity without improving analgesia. For this reason, concurrent administration with another NSAID is not recommended. Doubling the dose of flunixin produces no improvement in analgesia, while potentially increasing the risk of toxicity.\n\nIn the US, the only labeled route for flunixin administration in cattle is intravenous and pour-on. This is not the case in other countries; for example, in the UK, Allevenix is licensed for IV and intramuscular use, and a pour-on product also exists.\n\nIn the US flunixin is not labelled for goat use, however, flunixin may be used in goats in an extra-label fashion under appropriate veterinary guidance. Flunixin administered subcutaneously to dairy goats may carry a milk withdraw recommendation of 36-60 hours. Interestingly, when given subcutaneously to goats in that study, tissue injury, such as seen in horses with intramuscular administration, was not observed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2334208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334208", "title": "Our Price", "text": "Our Price\n\nOur Price was a chain of record stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland from 1971 until 2004.\n\nFounded in 1971 by Gary Nesbitt, Edward Stollins and Mike Isaacs, their first store was located in London's Finchley Road. Until 1976, the first six stores were branded \"The Tape Revolution\", by Bob Fowler of Fowler Coates Ltd and concentrated on selling the then-new compact cassette format and eight track tapes.\n\nFrom 1976, the chain was rebranded Our Price Records by Bob Fowler of Fowler Coates Ltd, in response to local demand for vinyl records over eight tracks. In 1988, it was rebranded again as \"Our Price Music\", as record labels began to distribute the new CD format. In 1993, the by then three-hundred-store chain was renamed simply Our Price.\n\nThe company's headquarters were in London, with an office above the store on Kensington High Street and promotional offices in Wood Lane, White City. It initially focused on the rock album buyer, with regular imports of \"cut-out\" albums from the United States, a remainder store on Charing Cross Road branded Surplus Records, and a mail order business driven by advertising in the music press.\n\nThese markets fell away as the chain grew from 1980 onwards, when the company purchased the chain \"Harlequin Records\". Thereafter, national expansion followed, with the 100th store opening in the Kings Road, Chelsea, the 200th at Stirling, Scotland, and the 300th in Brixton, South London.\n\nIn the first half of the 1980s Our Price established itself as the United Kingdom's second largest retailer of records and tapes (with Woolworths the largest). Brand recognition was driven by pun-rich radio advertising built around the \"Get Down To Our Price\" slogan, which later transferred to television featuring an animated carrier bag called Billy.\n\nA sister chain, Our Price Video, was established to capitalise on the success of the new VHS tape format, and some towns eventually had two or three Our Price branded stores. Our Price Video was later rebranded under the Playhouse fascia, but failed to establish a significant market share in VHS sales, and it was wound up by then owners WH Smith at the end of the 1990s.\n\nThe otherwise unconnected Silver Screen retail chain was founded on the same \"specialist movies\" principle in the early 2000s; it too foundered, and later closed down. The expansion of HMV by owners Thorn EMI in the late 1980s established a chain of newer, larger stores, which threatened and eventually overtook Our Price in popularity.\n\nIn 1984, Our Price was the first specialist music store to float on the London Stock Exchange. Two years later, it was acquired by WH Smith for £43 million, with Smith's Sound FX immediately absorbed into Our Price. Several members of senior management left the company in 1989 to create the rival MVC, which itself would eventually be bought by Woolworths.\n\nIn March 1994, WH Smith also bought a majority interest in Richard Branson's Virgin Music retail chain, a move which (with both Our Price and Virgin brands combined) would push them back ahead of HMV in market share. The next year, Virgin/Our Price increased profits by 10%. However, sales dropped by 3% in the year to May 1997, a contraction experienced throughout the industry.\n\nAround this time, WH Smith opened 23 new Virgin Megastores, while closing nineteen Our Price branches. Even though Our Price had more outlets, over half the turnover then consisted of sales from stores trading under the Virgin brand with their larger footprints in locations with higher customer traffic. Yet, in 1998, WH Smith sold Virgin/Our Price for £145 million to a division of the Virgin Group of companies in response to the stores losing £127 million in the year to date.\n\nAfter this takeover in 1998, the Virgin Group attempted to sell Our Price to its own management team, in a failed management buy-out. In August 2000, it was announced that the Our Price name would be dropped from 102 stores, mainly in South East England, in favour of the Virgin name, or VShop. \n\nDuring the announcement, Our Price's commercial director, Neil Boote, told \"Billboard\": \"There has been no real investment in the vast majority of (Our Price) stores for a long, long time. Environmentally, they're a long way away from where we'd like to be.\" He added, \"I'm sure Virgin believes that, if the VShop concept works, it has to have international potential. Frankly, Our Price was just too parochial a brand with no (particularly unique selling points). It epitomised the High Street record store of the '80s.\" Virgin had no immediate plans for the remaining 127 Our Price branded stores, until they saw how well the VShop chain would be received.\n\nFive VShops reopened on 4 September 2000, located in Kensington, Ealing, Notting Hill Gate, Hammersmith and Chatham. VShops continued to stock popular CDs, but would concentrate equally on selling an expanded range of VHS video cassettes, DVDs, and Virgin branded mobile phone products, with Virgin Mobile taking up 25% of floor space.\n\nThese reconfigured stores removed the bulk of back catalogue CDs from display with the hope that customers could order these instore for home delivery through dedicated computer terminals, which Virgin called \"Find & Buy\" kiosks. The so-called 'clicks and mortar' strategy aimed to combine high street shopping with emerging internet shopping trends.\n\nVirgin lost out to music and mobile phone competitors such as The Link, The Carphone Warehouse, HMV and MVC, while the increasing popularity of online shopping rendered the in-store ordering terminals redundant. Despite this, the Virgin Group continued to rebrand Our Price stores to VShop, and by April 2001, 100 Our Price branches had been converted, with the remaining 110 intended to be completed within the year. In addition, Virgin closed another 30 Our Price outlets between 1999 and 2001.\n\nThe early 2000s saw the Virgin Group start to scale down its entertainment retail division in the United Kingdom. In September 2007, it sold its domestic Virgin Megastores in a management buy-out, and they were subsequently renamed Zavvi. The group sold their remaining 77 Our Price branded stores to Brazin Limited in October 2001.\n\nBrazin was a major Australian entertainment retailer, which operated the 265 Sanity stores. It paid £2 for the Our Price stores and gained exclusive license rights in Australia for Virgin Entertainment, which had last traded there nine years earlier, under the co-ownership of the Virgin Group and Blockbuster Inc. Virgin Megastores were opened in Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nIn addition to the nominal £2 paid, Brazin paid £900 million to the Virgin Group while getting that exact amount back from Virgin for tax efficiency purposes. Brazin's CEO Ian Duffell said that the music market in the United Kingdom was one of the strongest in the world that year, and he expected a \"50 per cent increase in music revenues from day one.\" Further to the deal, Virgin would get 1% of all turnover in the stores, in conjunction with offering Brazin a £2 million loan facility. Brazin also made a commitment to restrict the size and proximity of its Sanity stores in the United Kingdom to ensure they did not pose a large competitive threat to Virgin's other music shops.\n\nEarly in 2002, Brazin experienced multiple delays in rebranding the Our Price stores due to difficulties with landlords, heritage listings, and negotiations with Railtrack. The company also moved the group's headquarters from the former Our Price central London offices to Alperton. The first rebranded Our Price store with Sanity's darker, urban look opened in London's Waterloo station on 23 April 2002, and the second opened at Paddington station on 9 May 2002, to positive customer reactions and strong sales. The Sanity/Our Price outlets were already starting to return on investments, and overall company operating profit rose to 32% in the year to 30 June 2002.\n\nIn July 2002, the Virgin Group announced that a select group of three VShops in Brixton, which had been Our Price's 300th store, Hounslow and Notting Hill would be relaunched again as Virgin Megastore Xpress, with a move away from mobile phone retailing and return to a larger number of back catalogue products. Another two VShop outlets in Reading and Colchester were relaunched as Virgin Gamestores, selling both gaming software and hardware. By November that year, a total of 18 former VShops were converted to the Virgin Megastore Xpress fascia, increasing sales by around 30% year on year.\n\nIn November 2002, Brazin acquired the remaining 41 VShop music and mobile phone stores, all former Our Price outlets, from the Virgin Group for £2 million. These stores were added to the network already acquired, in addition to the new Sanity shops being established by Brazin. The first of these new outlets opened in October at Conswater, Northern Ireland, and in November at Southsea, followed by Waltham Cross. By January 2003, the Sanity/Our Price/VShop network had grown to approximately 130 stores across the country.\n\nIn September 2003, even after increasing profitability across their store network, Brazin Limited sold all 118 stores of Sanity in the United Kingdom to Lee Skinner's investment company, Primemist Limited, for an estimated £9 million, citing higher expectations not met. At this stage, some stores were yet to be rebranded from Our Price; however, all VShop outlets were gone.\n\nPrimemist Limited struggled to operate the chain due to major credit limit reductions from suppliers, and had no alternative but to enter into administration in December 2003. Buyers for the entire business, or individual parts of it, could not be found. By April 2004, administrators BDO Stoy Hayward had closed all the Our Price stores, resulting in the redundancy of 400 staff members.\n\nThe final Our Price to close, in Chesterfield, hosted a closing day party. All the chain's remaining stock was sold to the shops of Oxfam.\n\nAn Our Price Records branded store was briefly seen in a Virgin Atlantic 1980s styled nostalgia advertisement, screened in the United Kingdom from January of 2009. The advert was created to celebrate 25 years of Virgin Atlantic, and ceased airing in mid-2010.\n\"www.ourprice.co.uk\" was a comparison website owned by Our Price Records Limited, which was established in 2003, and featured products which extended further than the music and entertainment industry.

In 1925, the Institute affiliated with Presbyterian Hospital, now NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, adding general hospital facilities to the Institute's psychiatric services and research laboratories.\n\nThrough the years, distinguished figures in American psychiatry have served as directors of the Psychiatric Institute, including Drs. Ira Van Gieson, Adolph Meyer, August Hoch, Lawrence Kolb, Edward Sachar and Herbert Pardes. The current director is Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman.\n\nThe institute was established in 1895 by the New York State Hospital Commission as the Pathological Institute of the New York State Hospitals.

The northern boundary of the Shire is located adjacent to the border between New South Wales and Queensland. \n\nThe Shire was established on 17 March 2004, when the Yallaroi, Bingara, and a northern portion of the Barraba shires were merged. The seat of the Council is located in the major centre of the area in the town of Bingara. Other major towns include Warialda.\n\nThe Mayor of the Gwydir Shire Council is Cr. John Coulton, who is unaligned with any political party.\n\nThe towns of Gwydir Shire include Warialda and Bingara, and the villages/localities include Bangheet, Caroda, Cobbadah, Coolatai, Copeton, Crooble, Croppa Creek, Dinoga, Elcombe, Gineroi, Gravesend, Gulf Creek, Gundamulda, North Star, Pallal, Riverview, Upper Bingara, Upper Horton, Warialda Rail, Yagobe, and Yallaroi. The locality of Myall Creek is split between Gwydir Shire (the southern part of the locality) and Inverell Shire (the northern part of the locality).\n\nThe first local government in the Gwydir region was the Bingara Municipality, incorporated to serve the town of Bingara in early 1889. The town of Warialda followed on 30 March 1900.\n\nWith the passage of the , which established shires all over New South Wales, the Yallaroi, Gwydir (later Bingara) and Barraba Shires were gazetted on 6 March 1906. The Warialda and Bingara municipalities amalgamated into their respective shires on 29 December 1924 and 17 December 1943 respectively.\n\nOn 17 March 2004, the Yallaroi, Bingara and Barraba Shires were abolished. Yallaroi and Bingara were fully amalgamated into the newly formed Gwydir Shire, while Barraba was split between Gwydir, which received (41%) of its area and 340 people in the former shire's north, and the newly formed Tamworth Regional Council.\n\nAt the , there were people in the Gwydir local government area, of these 50.6 per cent were male and 49.4 per cent were female. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.8 per cent of the population which is marginally above both the national and state averages of 2.5 per cent. The median age of people in the Gwydir Shire was 45 years; higher than the national median of 37 years. Children aged 0 – 14 years made up 19.0 per cent of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 22.6 per cent of the population. Of people in the area aged 15 years and over, 50.8 per cent were married and 11.1 per cent were either divorced or separated.\n\nBetween the 2006 census and the 2011 census the Gwydir Shire experienced negative population growth in both absolute and real terms. When compared with total population growth of Australia for the same periods, being 5.78 per cent and 8.32 per cent respectively, population growth in the Gwydir local government area was significantly lower than the national average. The median weekly income for residents within the Gwydir Shire was significantly below the national average. \n\nAt the 2011 census, the proportion of residents in the Gwydir local government area who stated their ancestry as Australian or Anglo-Saxon exceeded 92 per cent of all residents (national average was 65.2 per cent). In excess of 77 per cent of all residents in the Gwydir Shire nominated a religious affiliation with Christianity at the 2011 census, which was significantly higher than the national average of 50.2 per cent. Meanwhile, as at the census date, compared to the national average, households in the Gwydir local government area had a significantly lower than average proportion (2 per cent) where two or more languages are spoken (national average was 20.4 per cent); and a significantly higher proportion (96.7 per cent) where English only was spoken at home (national average was 76.8 per cent).\n\nPopulations for the Yallaroi and Bingara Shires (including municipalities) over time are listed below. Totals are not provided as it is difficult to quantify the component from Bingara Shire.

He was the elder brother of the renowned political leader Mohammad Ali Jouhar.\n\nShaukat Ali was born in 1873 in Rampur state in what is today Uttar Pradesh in India but later played role in partition of India on religious lines. He was educated at the Aligarh Muslim University. He was extremely fond of playing cricket, captaining the university team. \n\nAli served in the civil service of the United Provinces of Oudh and Agra for 17 years in British India.\n\nShaukat Ali helped his younger brother Mohammad Ali Jouhar publish the Urdu weekly \"Hamdard\" and the English weekly \"Comrade\". In 1915 he published an article which said Turks were right to fight the British. These two weekly magazines played a key role in shaping the political policy of Muslim India back then. In 1919, while jailed for publishing what the British charged as seditious materials and organizing protests, he was elected as the last president of the Khilafat conference. He was re-arrested and imprisoned from 1921 to 1923 for his support to Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress during the Non-Cooperation Movement (1919–1922). His fans accorded him and his brother the title of \"Maulana\". In March 1922, he was in Rajkot jail and was later released in 1923.\n\nWhile still a supporter of Congress and its non-violent ethos, Ali even surpassed some of his colleagues in also providing support to the revolutionary independence movement. To this end, he supplied guns to Sachindranath Sanyal. \n\nHe opposed the 1928 Nehru Report. Instead, he demanded separate electorates for Muslims and finally the Khilafat Committee rejected the Nehru Report. Shaukat Ali attended the first and second Round Table Conferences (India) in London in 1930-31. His brother Jouhar died in 1931, and Shaukat Ali continued on and organized the World Muslim Conference in Jerusalem.\n\nIn 1936, Ali became a member of the All India Muslim League and became a close political ally of and campaigner for Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the future founder of Pakistan. He served as member of the 'Central Assembly' in British India from 1934 to 1938. He travelled all over the Middle East, building support for India's Muslims and the struggle for independence from the British rule in India.\n\nShaukat Ali died on 26 November 1938 at the residence of Begum Mohammad Ali Jauhar, the widow of his brother, in Karol Bagh, a neighbourhood in Delhi. His body was buried in the vicinity of the Jama Masjid, Delhi on 28 November 1938.\n\nPakistan Postal Services issued a commemorative postage stamp in his honor in 1995 in its 'Pioneers of Freedom' series.\n\n"}

However Perumthachan is an important figure in the folklore of Kerala and many a wondrous structure and architecture that still stand are attributed to him.\n\nMany legends of Perumthachan are seen in Aithihyamala, the compilation of legends and folklore of Kerala written by Kottarathil Sankunni. Given that Perumthachan was a Vishwakarma his parents must also have been Vishwakarma Brahmins (Carpenters called as Vishwa Brahmins). After their marriage, they set out on a long journey. Each of them grew famous in their lives and many tales and lores were attributed, with them as the main cast. The eldest was Agnihothri, a Brahmin, whose place is Mezhathur in Thrithala. The others are Perumthachan (Master carpenter), Naranath Bhranthan (an eccentric philosopher who was perceived as a madman), Vayillakunnilappan (a child with no mouth, whom the mother wanted to keep with her) and so on.\n\nSince Raman (രാമന്‍) was raised by parents who belonged to the Vishwakarma ( Achary) caste, he mastered the art and science of carpentry, architecture, and sculpture to become a Perumthachan. He read the sacred texts and imbibed the ancient intellectual tradition. He was commissioned for many a great architectural project to build temples and palaces.\n\nPerumthachan was once assigned to construct a temple pond. But it so happened that a dispute arose among three Karakkars (local residents) of the place as to the shape of the pond to be constructed. One group wanted a rectangular pond, another a square pond and the third, a circular shape. Perumthachan agreed to construct a pond which would satisfy all the three conflicting demands. When the pond was constructed, the Karakkars from each of the sides were immensely pleased to see their desired shape for the pond. It was so because the original shape of the pond was none of these three but a highly irregular shape, which could create an illusion and fool the onlooker from each side.\n\nThe Shiva temple at Uliyannoor and the Valluvanad temples that still exist in Kerala are attributed to Perumthachan.\n\nPanniyur Sri Varahamurthy Temple ,situated in Palakkad district, Kerala preserve the chisel and measuring rod(muzhakkol) used by perumthachan.\n\nThe story of Perumthachan has been a source of artistic expression for various people. It has been the basis for a great Malayalam dramatic monologue poem of the same name by G. Sankara Kurup. The legend of Perumthachan was also depicted in a Malayalam cinema Perumthachan(Film) masterfully performed by the famous actor Thilakan. The movie script was written by M. T. Vasudevan Nair and directed by Ajayan (1990) and has won many prestigious accolades for its brilliant cinematography and direction.\n\nParayi petta panthirukulam\n\n"}

{"id": "2334278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334278", "title": "Transport Workers Union of Australia", "text": "Transport Workers Union of Australia\n\nThe Transport Workers Union of Australia (TWU) is a trade union with over 90,000 members throughout Australia. It has 5 main branches in Australia\n\nThe TWU is a union based on the organising model. It is largely progressive and militant. The TWU is affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the International Transport Workers' Federation. In South Australia, Queensland and New South Wales, the union is affiliated with the Labor Right. The TWU is considered to be one of the most powerful unions in the Labor Right faction of the Australian Labor Party.\n\nThe union has coverage throughout the many sectors of the transport industry including: \n\nWhilst technically having wide coverage, the TWU largely focuses on road transport, warehouse distribution, airline operations, bus drivers and the waste industry.\n\nThe TWU's coverage of gas industry staff extends from its amalgamation with The Federated Gas Employees Industrial Union (FGEIU) in 1997. South Australia is the only state to have an extensive membership in this industry as it was the base of the FGIEU. It is the only state to have a gas industry sub-branch.\n\nThe history of the Transport Workers Union is partly a story of the enormous technological and economic changes to the ways people and goods have been transported across the history of this country. Its main themes are belief that the free market cannot be relied upon to create a safe, efficient and viable transport industry; and that transport workers have stood together to better their pay and conditions.\n\nIn the 1880s, small independent unions of drivers sprang up in the colonies of Australia. Many of these unions were short-lived. It was an extremely competitive industry. A self-employed carrier could set himself up with a basic horse and cart for a relatively small sum of money, and drivers, too, were in chronic oversupply. Conditions were poor and wage-earning drivers worked very long hours for low rates of pay. Much of the available work was casual and seasonal.\n\nAfter the turn of the century, small specialised transport unions were established throughout Australia. These included separate unions of milk carters, bread carters, and fuel and fodder carters. Numbers of wage-earning drivers increased in the major cities during this period as carrying firms grew in size, stimulated by growth in manufacturing. Wharves and railway depots were also important sources of work for drivers. By 1903 it was reported that work had become more stable and less casual. However, conditions were still poor. Drivers could be expected to work up to 19 hours a day. Wages were generally between 25 and 35 shillings a week.\n\nGrowth in the transport sector provided a stimulus for carters' unions to reorganise themselves to make them a stronger force. This led to the federal registration of the Federated Carters and Drivers' Industrial Union in 1906. This union is the direct predecessor of today's TWU.\n\nWhile other parts of the economy experienced difficult times in the years 1914–1939, rapid technological change made road transport a dynamic and rapidly expanding industry. There was an explosion in numbers of commercial motor vehicles in Australia during the 1920s. Advances in truck construction and decreasing costs made road transport a serious competitor to the railways for the first time. These changes put the union in a stronger position to fight for shorter working hours and other improved conditions. However, the union itself had to adapt and make the transition from the horse-drawn era to the new world of trucks and cars.\n\nIn 1925, representatives of the Federated Carters and Drivers' Industrial Union, the Trolley, Draymen and Carters' Union and the Motor Transport and Chauffeurs' Association met to plan the establishment of a new union capable of representing all persons employed in connection with the transport of people or goods by road. This led to the Amalgamated Road Transport Workers Union becoming federally registered in 1928.\n\nDespite these attempts to create a stronger organisation, the Great Depression hit the union hard. The Queensland branch survived the depression best. Yet even there, award conditions couldn't survive the pressure of mass unemployment. It was estimated that many workers had their conditions returned to those of the 1880s. In Victoria casual employment had again become the norm with gangs of men waiting outside yards all day trying to get work by the hour.\n\nThe road transport sector picked up again after the depression. During this period the union's strongest sector was among oil company drivers. In 1937 these drivers were the first in the union to win a week's annual leave—benefits which flowed on to the wider membership in 1940.\n\nIn 1937 the union was granted the right to cover persons engaged in connection with the transport of passengers or freight by air as well as by road. These members—particularly baggage handlers and porters—quickly became a key sector within the Union. Their bargaining power won improvements in pay and conditions which in turn benefited union members in other sectors. To reflect the change in coverage, in 1938 the union adopted its current name, the Transport Workers Union of Australia.\n\nWorld War II saw major changes within the road transport industry, with acute labour shortages resulting in long hours and high wages for drivers. After the war the road transport industry was rationalised as smaller operators were forced out of the business by larger, more efficient firms. These larger companies introduced new methods of work, using specialised bulk tankers, forklifts and pallets to lower costs and increase productivity.\n\nThe road transport industry grew strongly after the war and the sophistication and size of trucks increased. By the end of the 1960s, large articulated trucks accounted for 56% of all tonne-kilometres performed by road transport. By this time waves of takeovers had reorganised the industry with small local firms being taken over by large national transport companies. By 1966 five conglomerates dominated the industry – Ansett, TNT, Mayne Nickless, Brambles and Alltrans/Comet. This rationalisation meant that the union also had to reorganise itself into a strong federal body, capable of operating in a nationally co-ordinated way.\n\nIn the early 1960s drivers won substantial wage increases as the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission recognised the changing nature of drivers' work in the road transport industry. Heavier loads, the increased use of high-powered, multi-axled articulated vehicles, and the higher levels of skill and productivity required of drivers led to labour shortages and provided the opportunity for the TWU to win large wage increases.\n\nSeeking to minimise their costs, many large companies increased their use of owner drivers to avoid paying award rates of pay to employee drivers. These subcontractors, increasingly discovered they lacked the bargaining power of employee drivers. Forced to negotiate individually with the large prime contractors, they found themselves progressively squeezed throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s as operating costs rose far more than rates. For the first time since the 1880s, owner drivers joined the union in large numbers. They had quickly found the TWU was the only serious industrial force that could stand up to the transport conglomerates.\n\nFrom the early 1970s, the TWU became a cohesive, centrally directed force with a substantial presence, actively recruiting members and training job delegates. The early 1980s were a time of strong gains in wages and the TWU was for a time the pacesetter, gaining higher wage increases for its members than any other union.\n\nGround was lost, however, as the recession of 1982–83 took hold. This downturn stimulated a major restructuring of the Australian transport industry as retailers and manufacturers turned to a system of contract distribution rather than maintain their own truck fleets or engage owner drivers. Contract distribution involved total responsibility for the pick-up, warehousing, distribution and delivery of goods.\n\nLarge companies used economies of scale, mechanised and computerised warehouses and close control of their workforce, to reduce costs and the number of employees and vehicles required. Restructuring such as this has led to considerable changes to the work of employee drivers.\n\nIn 1987 the TWU amalgamated with \"Motor Transport and Chauffeurs Association\", which gave the union coverage of the private bus industry in Victoria.\n\nWhen the conservative Howard Government came into power in 1996, the TWU faced new challenges. The focus of membership retention turned to a more organising focus as compulsory membership was made illegal under the \"Workplace Relations Act 1996\". Before this time, union members and organisers could pressure non-union truck drivers against entering union-dominated workplaces.\n\nMembership declined rapidly, but picked up in following years—almost every state increasing membership by 2004. Targeted recruitment and retention campaigns proved successful for the union, as well as increased co-operation between state branches.\n\nIn 2006, Federal Secretary John Allan resigned. He was replaced by NSW Secretary Tony Sheldon as Acting Federal Secretary. The head office location was moved from Melbourne to Sydney.\n\nNational Secretary Sheldon led the union to success in the 'Safe Rates' campaign with the passing of legislation to establish the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal in 2012. The union continues industrial action in the wake of the 2011 Qantas industrial disputes.\n\nA number of books have been written about the history of the TWU, including:\n"}

It was primarily broadcast on PBS stations during the afternoon hours on weekdays. It debuted on October 11, 2004, and was closed on October 7, 2013.\n\nThe PBS Kids Go! programming block was launched in October 2004. With the discontinuation of the original PBS Kids Channel (a revived version has been launched as of January 16, 2017) in favor of PBS Kids Sprout in 2005, PBS Kids Go! continued its run on PBS.\n\nIn April 2006, PBS announced that, in October 2006, a 24-hour digital multicast network called PBS Kids Go! Channel would be launched with additional content. Slated were several programming blocks, an evening Go! family block targeted at both children and their families, a Spanish language-programming block, \"PBS Kids Vayan!\" and a school block. \"KidsWorld Sports\", HIT Entertainment’s \"Wishbone\" reruns and \"Kratts’ Creatures\" were planned as exclusive programs for the network. These exclusive shows plus those from the PBS block would total seven hours of original programming. At this time, PBS planned on adding one or two new series per year. The network was to be fee-based, allowing those stations that subscript to place the network's exclusive programs on their analog channel if they order. A branded interactive club was also part of the plan, with stations working it into their existing club or starting a new club and branding it how they would like to.\n\nWith only one third of PBS stations affiliating with the network and half needed on July 6, 2006, the network was withdrawn. PBS left open the possibility to re-offer the network. Stations found that the sliding scale licensing fees were too high for what little exclusive programming they received, especially after spending additional funds for the PBS HD feed.\n\nOn August 7, 2013, PBS announced that the PBS Kids Go! brand would be discontinued and replaced by another graphic redesign for PBS Kids. The redesign was introduced two months later on October 7, 2013 with the launch of \"Peg + Cat\". PBS Kids Go! dissolved, as few parents and kids understood what the brand was about.\n\n\nPBS Kids Go! aired shorts, usually at the end of \"Maya & Miguel\", and in-between episodes of \"Arthur\", to fill time after long-form programming. These include \"Go! Figure\", \"WordGirl\", \"Oh Noah\", \"A Word From Us Kids\" and miscellaneous shorts featuring live-action kids talking about things they do; about their families' heritage; or other topics with Maya (Candi Milo) or Miguel (Nika Futterman) doing a voiceover.\n\nIn 2009, PBS launched the first contest called \"PBS Kids Go! Writers Contest\" to continue the annual writing and illustrating competition for children in Kindergarten through 3rd grade, which started in 1995 as the \"Reading Rainbow Young Writers and Illustrators Contest\". After 2013, it was renamed as \"PBS Kids Writers Contest\".\n\n"}

King Edward VII Preparatory School (KEPS), which is situated adjacent to the High School and shares its grounds, caters to boys from grades R to 7.\n\nMike Fennell resigned in 2012, and his successor was David Lovatt, who attended the school briefly but matriculated at Roosevelt High School in Johannesburg. \n\nIn 1902, when the Boer War came to an end, there was an urgent need for schools in the Transvaal. The Milner Administration, in search of suitable buildings in which to establish temporary classrooms, found a vacant cigar factory in Johannesburg, on the corner of Gold and Kerk Streets, which was chosen as venue for \"The Government High School for Boys\", also known as the \"Johannesburg High School for Boys\". Thus was born a school which ultimately became the King Edward VII School.\n\nIt grew so rapidly that, in 1904, it was moved to Barnato Park where it was established in the mansion that originally had been designed for the mining millionaire Barney Barnato, who died at sea in 1897. At its new location, it was referenced as \"Johannesburg College\" but, within seven years, the premises were deemed inadequate and, in 1911, the school was moved to its present site on the Houghton ridge where new buildings had been impressively-designed and specifically constructed for the school. The time frame, within less than a year after the founding of the Union of South Africa and the death of Queen Victoria's eldest son and successor, Edward VII, led to the proposal that the institution's name be changed to honour his memory, thus establishing the appellation, King Edward VII School.\n\nOver a century old, the school buildings of King Edward retain their impressive appearance and are considered national monuments. These include the school hall, the back facade, the front facade, the lecture theatre and library wing, the memorial wing and the cenotaph in the main quad.\n\nThey are also fully committed to fulfill their duty to the school and offer newly renovated classes, a modern and renovated lecture hall, one of the biggest libraries in Gauteng, three state-of-the-art IT centres with 110 computer stations, art centres, a museum, historic hall and theatre built by the Dramatic Society in previous decades.\n\nThe school has been involved in numerous rugby poaching scandals resulting in at least two schools (SACS in Cape Town and near neighbours Parktown Boys) cancelling fixtures against the school.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1838 and revamped almost completely by Aristide Boucicaut in 1852, it was one of the first modern department stores. Now the property of LVMH, it sells a wide range of high-end goods, including food in an adjacent building at 38, rue de Sèvres, called La Grande Épicerie de Paris.\n\nA novelty shop called \"Au Bon Marché\" was founded in Paris in 1838 to sell lace, ribbons, sheets, mattresses, buttons, umbrellas and other assorted goods. It originally had four departments, twelve employees, and a floor space of three hundred square meters. The entrepreneur Aristide Boucicaut became a partner in 1852, and changed the marketing plan, instituting fixed prices and guarantees that allowed exchanges and refunds, advertising, and a much wider variety of merchandise. The use of fixed prices replaced the system of haggling over prices, then commonly used in dry goods stores. The annual income of the store increased from 500,000 francs in 1852 to five million in 1860. In 1869 he built a much larger building at 24 rue de Sèvres on the Left Bank, and enlarged the store again in 1872, with help from the engineering firm of Gustave Eiffel, creator of the Eiffel Tower. The income rose from twenty million francs in 1870 to 72 million at the time of Boucicaut's death in 1877, at which time the management of the store continued by his wife, Marguerite Boucicaut. The floor space had increased from three hundred square meters in 1838 to fifty thousand, and the number of employees had increased from twelve in 1838 to 1,788 in 1879. Boucicaut was famous for his marketing innovations; a reading room for husbands while their wives shopped; extensive newspaper advertising; entertainment for children; and six million catalogs sent out to customers. By 1880 half the employees were women; unmarried women employees lived in dormitories on the upper floors.\n\nThe architecture of the store was very innovative for its time; the 1869 store was constructed by the architect Louis-Auguste Boileau. Alexandre Laplanche ornamented Boileau's ironwork technology. Louis-Charles Boileau, his son, continued the store in the 1870s, consulting the firm of Gustave Eiffel for parts of its structure. Louis-Hippolyte Boileau, the grandson of Louis-Auguste Boileau, worked on an extension to the store in the 1920s. \n\nThe building inspired the design of the Bon Marche store in Sydney, designed by Arthur Anderson, as well as the Galerias Pacifico shopping centre in Buenos Aires, originally called \"Argentine Bon Marché\".\n\nIn 1922, when the decorative arts were at their high point in France, the Pomone design and decorating department was established, following the trend of other Parisian department stores. From 1923–1928, Paul Follot (1877–1941) was its director, followed by René-Lucien Prou (1889–1948) and Albert-Lucien Guénot (1894–1993) up to 1955. Today's home-furnishings inventory primarily consists of brand names but not white goods.\n\n\n\n"}

It is situated about to the west of Morpeth. The population as of the 2011 census was 194.\n\nThe place-name 'Hartburn' is first attested in Charter Rolls of 1198, where it appears as \"Herteburne\". The name means 'stag stream'.\n\nThe village is on the Hart Burn river, which a couple of miles downstream joins the River Wansbeck, which flows through Morpeth and Ashington to the sea.\n\nThe Devil's Causeway passes the western edge of the village, just before its crosses the \nHart river (burn). The causeway was a Roman road which started at Portgate on Hadrian's Wall, north of Corbridge, and extended northwards across Northumberland to the mouth of the River Tweed at Berwick-upon-Tweed.\n\nTo the north of the village lies Hartburn Glebe, an area of woodland alongside the river Hart Burn currently in the care of the Woodland Trust . This small woodland has been described as one of the best British woods for views. A cave, known as Hartburn Grotto, was modified by an 18th-century Vicar of Hartburn (Dr John Sharpe) as a changing area for ladies wishing to bathe in the river. Above the tall entrance are cavities that once housed statues of Adam and Eve. Near the grotto there are postholes carved in the stone of the river-bed, which show where the Roman bridge crossed the river. Leading down to them is a sunken track called The Cut, which has been claimed to be the true line of the Devil's Causeway – its actual route through Hartburn is disputed. Possibly there were two routes through the woods, both now marked by sunken lanes, the western one pre-dating the building of the bridge, and the eastern one post-dating it.\n\nDr John Sharpe also built the crenellated Tower House that overlooks Hartburn Glebe. It was built as a village school, accommodation for the schoolmaster, and as a stable for the parish hearse in 1745. The north face of the house is built in an 18th-century Gothic style whilst the south face, with its stairs up the outside, resembles a large Northumbrian bastle house.\n\nThe Old Vicarage in Hartburn is at heart a Northumbrian pele tower, with later additions including an 18th-century library wing added by Dr John Sharpe.\n\nThe field opposite the old school and school house shows evidence of there being an ancient settlement, and old folklore says that the large solitary stone is what is left of the ancient village cross. Another local folklore tale is that the deep water of the Hart downstream from the Grotto is where the village baker secreted his money in a chest; to this day this deep pool is termed 'the Baker's Chest'.\nHartburn War Memorial was designed by renowned architect Sir Edwin Lutyens to his War Cross design. It was commissioned by Mr and Mrs Straker of nearby Angerton Hall, whose gardens Lutyens renovated in 1904, and unveiled on 31 July 1921. It is a grade II listed building.\n\nThe village church is the parish church of St Andrew, a Grade I listed building, Norman architecture with some medieval alterations. Marks perhaps carved into the doorpost by the Knights Templar, who may have used the church in the 13th Century, are still visible.\n\nAccording to the architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, in the churchyard there is \"the best collection in the county of well-preserved C18 headstones, many carved on both faces. Cherubs, death's heads and various mortality emblems abound.\"\n\n\n"}

The GT was introduced in March 2003 at the Geneva Motor Show. Production commenced on 28 November 2003, the GT was built at the Pomigliano plant, alongside the 147 and 159. A total of 80,832 units were produced. \n\nThe GT was based on Fiat C-platform (also used for the 156) with styling by Bertone. Initially, Bertone insisted to assemble the car at their own plant but after refusal from Alfa Romeo's parent company Fiat, the GT was assembled at the Pomigliano plant instead.\n\nThe bodywork is in a classic coupé style, but uses a hatchback two door style compared to the earlier coupés like GTV and some rivals such as the BMW 3 Series Coupé. Combined with a full rear bench giving five seats (rather than a 2+2 layout) the GT was advertised as being a practical sports car. Most mechanicals were taken directly from the 156/147 using the same double wishbone front suspension and MacPherson rear setup.\n\nThe interior is derived form the smaller 147 hatchback and shares many common parts: such as having the same dash layout, functions, the climate control system as well as having a similar electrical system. \n\nSome exterior parts are also shared with the 147 such as the bonnet, wing mirrors and front wings (from the 147 GTA). The engine range included both the 1.8 TS and the 2.0 JTS petrol engines, a 1.9 MultiJet turbodiesel, and a top of the range 3.2 V6 petrol engine. Luggage capacity is which could be enlarged to with the rear seats folded. \n\nThe GT was positioned as a sports car in Alfa Romeo's range, along with the Brera (which was based on the newer mid size Alfa 159). In October 2006, Alfa Romeo introduced a 1.9 JTD Q2 version with limited slip differential, and also added a new trim level called Black Line.\n\nIn 2008, the cloverleaf model was launched as a limited edition complete with new trim levels, lowered suspension, body kit, 18 inch alloy wheels and was only available in Black, Alfa Red, or Blue colours. The engines included the 1.8 L and 2.0 L petrol, as well as 1.9 L Multijet turbo diesel. Production of the cloverleaf ended on 16 June 2010.\n\nStandard features included power steering, trip computer, air conditioning, reverse assist, dual climate control, airbags (including 'curtain' airbags) with internal passenger sensors to decide remotely which airbags to deploy, side mirror defrosters, and cruise control, plus options like seat warmers, leather interior, ten CD changer, satellite radio controls and windscreen sensors for automatic wiper activation.\n\nThe GT primarily shared its engines with the 156. The layout and design of the engines is identical, although with some differences in power outputs, with a version of the diesel available and the quoted power output of the V6 slightly lower at instead of for the 156.\n\nReferences:<ref name=\"alfaromeopress.com/\"></ref>\n\nThe standard braking system consisted of ventilated front discs with at the rear. The 3.2 V6 model has ventilated discs at front.<ref name=\"fiatautopress.com/download\"></ref> The GT included anti-lock braking system with electronic brakeforce distribution and hydraulic brake assistance.\n\nOther features included VDC (Vehicle Dynamic Control) or Alfa's version of ESP (Electronic Stability Program), ASR (Anti Slip Regulation) or traction control, EBD (Electronic Brake Distribution), ABS, brake assist and later the Q2 System. The Q2 system is Alfa's limited-slip differential technology, for improved cornering, reducing wheel spin, and torque steer, to help mitigate understeer common to front wheel drive cars.\n\nReferences:\n\nReferences:<ref name=\"alfaromeopress.com/\"></ref>\n\nAt the end of its production, several special models of the GT were launched for sale in different markets which included the following.\n\nThe \"Special Edition\" 1.9 \"JTDm\" was produced for the British market, where it had to be preordered by the customer. Its unofficial name was \"quadrifoglio verde\" (cloverleaf). It had leather interior and Q2 system as standard.\n\nThe \"Run Out Edition\" 2.0 JTS (black only) was assembled in a run of 12 cars for the Dutch dealers only. This version had some specifications improved in respect to the creature comforts; the Boss audio system was connected to a multimedia USB and was integrated to the Bluetooth blue&me system. \n\nThe Run Out Edition has eighteen inch alloy wheels, painted brake calipers, black instruments with white backlighting, a black leather steering wheel and alloy pedals. Furthermore, the car is fitted with specific sized grey leather seats and interior.\n\nThe \"100th anniversary limited edition\" version is intended for the Australian and South African markets;, and coloured Rosso Alfa, Atlantic Blue, Black and Ice White. The \"100th Anniversary Limited Edition\" was produced in a limited run of 130 units: 100 for the Australian market and 30 for the South African market.\n\nFollowing an overhauling of the range in that market, GTs were equipped with the 3.2 V6 with the manual six speed gearbox. A \"Centenario\" version was made for the French market. It had a rear view camera, Blue & Me and the 1.9 JTDm 16V engine.\n\nThe \"Quadrifoglio Oro\" was a special model for the Japanese market and was limited to 60 units with specifications similar to the Dutch Run Out: 2.0 JTS engine, Selespeed gearbox, red instruments, alloy wheels, red paint. This was the last model of the GT to be made.\n\nA soft top GT Cabrio Concept was designed and developed by Bertone in 2003, it was unveiled to the public on April 6, 2011. The car was a four seat open-top version of the GT coupé, which Bertone hoped to get built at their own plant. The next generation Alfa Romeo open top car was instead built by Pininfarina, using the Brera coupé as a base. This move ultimately led to the bankruptcy of Bertone and it was bought by Fiat who restructured it into its operations.\n\nThe GT has been acclaimed for its attractive styling and purposeful good looks. The design by Bertone follows a history of collaboration with Alfa Romeo.\n\nIn 2004, the Alfa Romeo GT was voted the world's most beautiful coupe in the annual 'World's Most Beautiful Automobile' (L'Automobile più Bella del Mondo) awards.\n\n"}

Wolper and owned by A&E Networks since 1987. Each episode depicts the life of a notable person with narration, on-camera interviews, photographs, and stock footage. The show originally ran in syndication in 1962–1964, and in 1979, on A&E from 1987 to 2006, and on The Biography Channel (later Bio, now FYI) from 2006 to 2012. After a five-year hiatus, the franchise was relaunched in 2017. Over the years, the \"Biography\" media franchise has expanded domestically and internationally, spinning off several cable television channels, a website, a children's program, a line of books and records, and a series of made-for-TV movies, specials, and miniseries, among other media properties. \"Biography\" has won a Peabody Award (1962) and three Emmy Awards (1997, 1999, 2002).\n\n\"Biography\" began as an early 1960s syndicated television series produced by David Wolper and narrated by Mike Wallace. It won a Peabody Award, launched Wallace's journalism career, and became a standard in biography films, widely shown in classrooms. After a one-year revival in 1979, the show returned on A&E Networks in 1987. In 1990, A&E began producing new episodes, and expanded the show into a multimedia franchise. By the turn of the century, \"Biography\" became A&E's \"flagship\" program, winning three Emmy Awards, growing from one night per week to seven, and spawning its own cable television channel, several spin-off shows, a website, made-for-TV movies, mini-series, books, audio books, records, and even a board game. The show's ratings eventually slipped and its airtime was reduced to one night per week, then exclusive to The Biography Channel (now FYI). Production of new episodes ceased in 2011 and \"Biography\" was almost entirely off the air by 2012. In 2017, A&E relaunched the \"Biography\" franchise with a series of TV specials and miniseries.\n\nThe original \"Biography\" was produced by David Wolper and Jack Haley Jr. and narrated by Mike Wallace, who at the time was just beginning his award-winning journalism career. The show featured no interviews, consisting instead of a half hour of film clips, newsreel footage, still photographs and recordings.\n\nProduction began in 1961 and the show was distributed in syndication by Official Films, premiering in February 1962. The 1960s series profiled world leaders (Winston Churchill), contemporary U.S. politicians (Fiorello H. La Guardia, Joseph McCarthy), athletes (Babe Ruth and Knute Rockne), and other 20th-century notables, including generals, authors, scientists, actors, and all the modern U.S. Presidents.\n\nThe program became popular in syndication, and in 1962, won a Peabody Award (Television Education), the first of several for both Wolper and Wallace. \"Biography\" has been credited with turning Wallace's journalism career around, and in 1963, he left to join \"The CBS Morning News with Mike Wallace\", and, later, 60 Minutes. \"Biography\" stopped releasing new episodes in 1964, although some episodes continued to be used as educational films in classrooms, became standards for filmed biographies of the persons profiled, and it played for decades in syndication. The series was briefly revived for syndication in 1979 with host David Janssen, profiling Idi Amin and Walt Disney, among others.\n\nThe Arts & Entertainment Network (now A&E), a joint venture started in 1984 by ABC, NBC, the Hearst Corporation, and the Rockefeller Group, acquired the broadcast rights to \"Biography\" and began airing the show on Tuesday nights at 8pm beginning on April 6, 1987, with Peter Graves as host. In the words of one observer, A&E's \"Biography\" \"picked up where Wolper left off.\"\n\nIn 1990, A&E acquired the rights to the \"Biography\" trademark and library, and began producing new episodes of the show, which expanded the subjects from historical figures to contemporary figures, including political leaders and popular celebrities, and which changed the program from one that reported history to one that recorded it as it unfolded. A&E also added on-camera interviews to the \"Biography\" format.\n\nIn 1994, A&E expanded the show from one night per week to five (every weeknight at 8pm) and commissioned over 100 hours of new programming. Journalist Jack Perkins joined the show as an alternate host along with Graves. For the 1995–96 season, A&E expanded \"Biography\" again, adding a sixth night, \"Biography This Week\", which profiled someone from the previous weeks' news, such as Yitzak Rabin, George Burns, and Gene Kelly.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, A&E expanded \"Biography\" into a media franchise, including multiple cable channels, a website, a monthly magazine, home videos, books for adults and children, audiobooks, music CDs, CD-ROMs, several spin-off shows, mini-series, and made-for-TV movies, and even a board game called \"Who Am I? The Biography Game.\"\n\nIn January 1995, A&E launched The History Channel, followed in November by The History Channel U.K., which included a British version of \"Biography\" with a British host. By 1996, its tenth year on A&E, \"Biography\" had achieved its highest ratings yet, drawing over 1.5 million viewers, six nights per week, and received its first Emmy nominations (The Presidents Award and Outstanding Informational Series). A&E started producing approximately 130 hours of new programming each year, and expanded the franchise into other media. Barnes & Noble began selling \"Biography\" videos in its 400 stores. In the summer of 1996, A&E launched \"Biography.com\". In the fall, a Saturday-morning children's version, \"Biography for Kids\", was released.\n\nThe next year, \"Biography\" won its first Emmy Award (Outstanding Informational Series), and was nominated in two other categories. The same year, \"Biography\" was allowed to interview sitting First Lady Hillary Clinton for an episode profiling billionaire Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton. Also in 1997, A&E released \"Biography\" audio tapes, and replaced its eight-year-old \"A&E Monthly\" magazine with \"Biography\" magazine. Circulation started at 100,000 in 1997 and grew for several years (to 270,000 by early 1998; 367,000 by mid-1998; 528,000 by 1999; and, 700,000 by 2001). Crown Publishing Group, a subsidiary of Random House, began publishing a line of 200-page \"Biography\" paperbacks in 1997, beginning with books on Muhammad Ali, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Ronald Reagan, and Pope John Paul II.\n\nIn 1998, \"Biography\" was airing twice a day, six days a week. The episode profiling Ozzie and Harriet Nelson, aired on three separate time slots on Sunday, June 21, 1998, became the show's highest-rated episode up to that point. A&E released \"Biography Movies\", featuring subjects such as P.T. Barnum, Lillian Hellman, and Dashiell Hammett. Bill Kurtis hosted a spin-off show, \"Biography: American Justice\", and a series of \"Biography\" record albums by artists who had been profiled on the show, including Dean Martin, Judy Garland, Nat King Cole, Mel Torme, and Lena Horne, was released by EMI-Capitol Entertainment Properties. In November, A&E created a spin-off network called The Biography Channel (now Bio Channel/FYI) featuring historical figures and current political and social leaders.\nBy 1999, \"Biography\" had profiled 600 people. It won its second Emmy Award (Outstanding Sound Mixing For Nonfiction Programming) and was on television in some incarnation seven nights per week, including an \"international-figure-personality-of-the-week,\" \"Biography International.\" That year's episode profiling Ron Howard was viewed in 3.5 million homes, becoming a new \"Biography\" record. Journalist Harry Smith (previously with CBS's \"This Morning\") joined \"Biography\" as the primary host, though Peter Graves and Jack Perkins continued to appear on the show.\n\nBy the end of the century, \"Biography\" had profiled over 800 people, and on October 1, 2000, A&E Networks expanded its British partnership with Sky UK with the launch of a UK market Biography Channel.\n\n\"Biography\"s ratings declined 15% from 2000 to 2001, and another 17% from 2001 to 2002, before increasing 6% in 2003. Despite the decrease in ratings, by 2002, \"Biography\" won its third Emmy Award (Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series), and marked its 1,000th profile.\n\nA&E responded to the ratings decline by changing \"Biography\"s management personnel and launching a marketing campaign centering on photographs taken by photographer Annie Leibovitz of well-known subjects that had been profiled on \"Biography\", including Jerry Seinfeld, Muhammad Ali, Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford.\nIn 2002, host Harry Smith left to join CBS's The Early Show. A&E began reducing the number of nights \"Biography\" aired starting 2003, when Neil Ross became the show's final host, narrating episodes on Elizabeth Taylor and Elvis Presley. The growth of \"Biography\"s magazine circulation slowed in 2002 and declined 9% in 2003. In 2004, A&E scaled back \"Biography\" magazine from monthly to quarterly publication.\n\nBy 2006, Ross had left the show and \"Biography\" was airing only once a week, usually on Friday nights with three back-to-back episodes. A&E removed \"Biography\" from its lineup in August, making new episodes of the show exclusively available on The Biography Channel. Its first year on The Biography Channel featured 64 hours of new programming, including episodes on the Onassis family, Jamie Oliver, Russell Simmons, George Lopez, Anthony Hopkins, Grace Slick, Elmore Leonard and Olivia Newton-John. The following year, The Biography Channel was rebranded \"Bio.\" In 2008, \"Biography\" released a documentary, \"Johnny Cash's America\", together with a companion DVD/CD package published by Legacy Recordings containing an unreleased recitation by the singer entitled \"I Am the Nation.\"\nThe last new episode aired in 2011, and the show ended its run in 2012. In 2014, A&E replaced its underperforming Bio channel with The FYI Network and partnered with digital publisher SAY Media. SAY Media began operating Biography.com, while A&E continued producing short-form videos for the website.\n\nIn 2017, A&E Networks relaunched the franchise with a set of two-hour specials and mini-series for three of its channels, A&E, History and Lifetime. Biography returned to A&E on June 28, 2017 with \"The Notorious Life of Biggie Smalls\". A&E announced that it would produce up to 40 hours of new episodes as part of the relaunch, including features on John Gotti, Tupac Shakur, Vladimir Putin, Elizabeth Smart, Mike Tyson, and David Koresh.\nThe original, early 1960s syndicated \"Biography\" was narrated by Mike Wallace, who won his first Peabody Award on the show, and launched his journalism career. Wallace left in 1963 to join \"The CBS Morning News with Mike Wallace\", and later, \"60 Minutes\".\n\nActor David Janssen hosted a short-lived 1979 revival of the show on CBS.\n\nActor Peter Graves hosted \"Biography\" on A&E starting in 1987, and he was joined in 1994 by journalist Jack Perkins as an alternate host, when the show expanded from one night per week to five.In 1999, after reportedly trying without success to recruit Charlie Gibson (who was then leaving ABC's Good Morning America) to replace Graves and Perkins, A&E named journalist |Harry Smith, previously with CBS's This Morning, as the primary host of \"Biography\", although Graves and Perkins continued to have a role with the series.\n\nSmith left in 2002 to join CBS's The Early Show, and was replaced by Neil Ross. Ross left in 2006, and A&E produced \"Biography\" as an unhosted show.\n\n\"Biography\" has profiled over 1,000 subjects, ranging from \"Moses to Mozart to Madonna,\" in the words of host Harry Smith, and as of 2018, Biography.com claims to contain over 7,000 biographical profiles on its website. The most-watched episodes profiled Ron Howard, the Gambino crime family, Ozzie and Harriet Nelson, Andre the Giant, and Sam Walton.\n\nSince its first broadcast in 1962, \"Biography\" has profiled:\n\n\"Biography\" has been described as \"an undisputed phenom,\" \"one of cable television's most respected programs,\" \"one of the most popular series on cable TV,\" \"the belle of the Nielsen ball,\" and \"the most pervasive series of history films found in classroom libraries.\" It has been called A&E's \"flagship series\", \"signature series,\" \"strongest brand,\" and \"most-watched show.\" In 2002, a writer for \"The Hartford Courant\" asked, \"Is there anybody who doesn't like, or at the very least hasn't stopped to watch, A&E's \"Biography\"?\"\n\n\"Biography\" has won a Peabody Award and three Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Awards (Emmy) Awards: Outstanding Informational Series in 1997, Outstanding Sound Mixing For Nonfiction Programming in 1999, and Outstanding Informational Series in 2002. The show has been nominated for 16 other Emmy Awards: The Presidents Award (1996–1997), Outstanding Informational Series (1996), Outstanding Individual Achievement Informational Programming (1997), Outstanding Documentary Or Nonfiction Series (1998–2000, 2003–09, 2011), Outstanding Picture Editing For Nonfiction Programming (1999), and Outstanding Informational Series (2001).\n\nNot all reviews have been positive. The same \"Hartford Courant\" writer criticized the early 1960s version of the show for focusing on \"great men\". A \"New York Times\" writer described \"Biography\" as \"skipping easily, and often superficially\" from one subject to the next. \"Variety\" has reviewed some episodes as \"disappointingly routine...marred by errors and omissions,\" and \"suffer[ing] tunnel vision.\" An episode on Fidel Castro was criticized as having \"a distinct anti-Castro edge by Mike Wallace.\" The Dwight Eisenhower Presidential Library includes a copy of a 1962 \"Biography\" episode featuring Eisenhower with the notation, \"There are some simplifications of facts and condensation of events.\" A 2018 \"Salt Lake Tribune\" TV critic wrote \"the producers of \"Warren Jeffs: Prophet of Evil\" should have been more careful\" to avoid confusing the LDS Church with the FLDS Church \"through careless editing.\"\nIn 2002, the American Library Association wrote that Biography.com is an \"extensive site\" and \"the perfect source for anyone looking for background or historical and biographical information.\" In 2009, Biography.com was named a \"Ten Best Reference Website\" by \"The Sunday Times\". Biography.com has been cited as a source by \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", \"The Los Angeles Times\", \"The Chicago Tribune\", \"The Columbus Dispatch\", \"The Boston Globe\", and NPR.\n\n\"Biography\" has been a category on the television game show \"Jeopardy!\". In 2000, the NBC sitcom \"Just Shoot Me!\" did an episode called \"A&E Biography: Nina Van Horn.\" The episode was shot in the style of A&E's \"Biography\", and focused on the life of one of the show's main characters, Nina Van Horn. The episode featured interviews with the other characters of the show and multiple special guest stars, including Don Henley, Jerry Hall, Sydney Pollack, Pat Sajak, Vanna White, and Buddy Hackett. The episode also included an introduction, conclusion, and voiceover provided by then-host Harry Smith.\n\n\n"}

His father owned the Boy-Line Fire Boat Company, which included a line of passenger ships. Some were deployed in Chicago for use at the Chicago World's Fair there in 1893. However, the father's business and family were struggling, and the family homestead was lost to foreclosure. In 1899, the family moved to Detroit, Michigan.\n\nRolf's father died in 1903, and a year later he and his mother moved to Seattle, Washington, following the footsteps of his oldest brother, William, who had moved there a year earlier. By now Rolf's artistic interests were emerging to more than a part-time pleasure.\n\nHe moved to Chicago in 1908, where he later studied at the Art Institute. He then went on to New York, where he studied with Robert Henri.\n\nAfter a trip to Paris in 1919 to study at the Académie Julian, he returned to New York and established a studio. In 1921 he went to Minneapolis to study calendar production at Brown & Bigelow.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, his work appeared on many pieces of sheet music, as well as on the covers of many magazines, most famously for movie fan magazines such as \"Photoplay\" and \"Screenland.\" His work mostly consists of women; Mary Pickford, Bebe Daniels, and Greta Garbo are just a few of the numerous he painted.\n\nArmstrong's work for the \"Pictorial Review\" was largely responsible for that magazine achieving a circulation of more than two million by 1926. A year later, he was the best-selling calendar artist at Brown & Bigelow. In 1930, RCA hired him to paint pin-ups to advertise their products, and in 1933 the Thomas D. Murphy Calendar Company signed him to produce a series of paintings for their line.\n\nRolf Armstrong died in 1960 on the island of Oahu, Hawaii as one of the best \"pin-up\" artists of the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nIn March 1940, Jewel Flowers, a girl from Lumberton, North Carolina, sent a picture of herself to Armstrong in response to an advert he had placed in the New York Times. Armstrong, 50 at the time, had been based at the Hotel des Artistes on West 67th Street in Manhattan since 1939, and was looking for new models. He invited Flowers for an interview. On March 25, 1940, Flowers started modeling for Armstrong. Their professional collaboration and friendship lasted for two decades. The first painting, titled \"How am I doing?\", reportedly because Flowers, unused to modeling, repeatedly asked Armstrong \"How am I doing?\" during the modeling session, was first published after World War II had started. It was Brown & Bigelow's best selling calendar for 1942 at a time when the company sold millions of calendars in America, and it became one of Armstrong's most reproduced pictures. Flowers was popular with American servicemen during World War II, some of whom sent her letters proposing marriage. Armstrong's calendars and silhouettes of Flowers were copied onto bombers and other planes as nose art and painted on tank turrets. She became so well known during the war, although more as a famous face than by name, that a serviceman's letter addressed simply as \"Jewel Flowers, New York City\" was delivered correctly. For many American servicemen abroad, she represented the \"Why We Fight\" spirit. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's government enlisted her to help promote war bonds. The January 1, 1945 edition of TIME magazine included Armstrong's \"Toast of the Town\" painting of Flowers in an article about Calendar Art. The article noted that calendars with \"girl paintings\" were \"bought heavily by foundries, machine shops, auto-supply dealers.\"\n\nFlowers married in 1946. She and her husband lived in several places while he tried a number of business ventures, including Laguna Beach, California, Greenville, South Carolina, Reno, Nevada, where she reportedly worked in as a card dealer for a time, and New York City. According to Michael Wooldridge, coauthor of \"Pin up Dreams: The Glamour Art of Rolf Armstrong\", Armstrong called her a number of times during the period she was following her husband from place to place, to try to persuade her to return to New York and model for him.\n\nHer modeling career ended with Armstrong's death in 1960. He left a large proportion of his personal wealth to Flowers. In total, Armstrong created around fifty to sixty works using Flowers as the model.\n\nIn the January 1930 issue of \"Screenland,\" Rolf Armstrong chose sixteen actresses to symbolize different colors. Here are the original captions and portraits in the order which they appeared in the magazine.\n\n\n"}

When the music starts the players should dance to the music, the more spirited the better. The game master will then stop the music at a random point. When the music has stopped all players should freeze. The judge then walks among the players and watches to see who is still moving or doesn't stop fast enough, those people are called out of the game. Play continues until there is only one person left, who will be announced as the winner.\n\nIf the game starts to get difficult to call people out, the players should be encouraged to get more enthusiastic so that it is more difficult to stop on time.\n\nSometimes the game master can also call a theme for the statues, so that the players must impersonate something such as an animal or activity.\n\nIn the Philippines, the game is one of many party games played in parties. Lights remain on or may be turned off for the music, depending on the game master. The rules remain the same wherein a player is eliminated if he/she fails to freeze once the music stops playing. Another variation of the musical statues in the Philippines is the \"newspaper dance\" wherein players are grouped into pairs and given a page of a newspaper. The players dance around the paper until the music stops wherein they have to stand on the paper and remain so until the music starts again. As the game progresses, the paper is folded in half for each round and each pair must make ways to pass each round. A pair which steps out of the paper is eliminated and the last team standing wins.\n\nThe world record for musical statues was set on 16 August 2013. Over 1,500 students at Mansfield State High School in Brisbane, Australia participated in the event.\n"}

It is found predominantly in protists and in unicellular algae. It was previously known as pulsatile or pulsating vacuole.\n\nThe contractile vacuole is a specialized type of vacuole that regulates the quantity of water inside a cell. In freshwater environments, the concentration of solutes is hypotonic, higher inside than outside the cell. Under these conditions, water osmosis causes water to accumulate in the cell from the external environment. The contractile vacuole acts as part of a protective mechanism that prevents the cell from absorbing too much water and possibly lysing (rupturing) through excessive internal pressure. \n\nThe contractile vacuole, as its name suggests, expels water out of the cell by contracting. The growth (water gathering) and contraction (water expulsion) of the contractile vacuole are periodical. One cycle takes several seconds, depending on the species and the environment's osmolarity. The stage in which water flows into the CV is called diastole. The contraction of the contractile vacuole and the expulsion of water out of the cell is called systole.\n\nWater always flows first from outside the cell into the cytoplasm, and is only then moved from the cytoplasm into the contractile vacuole for expulsion. Species that possess a contractile vacuole typically always use the organelle, even at very hypertonic (high concentration of solutes) environments, since the cell tends to adjust its cytoplasm to become even more hyperosmotic than the environment. The amount of water expelled from the cell and the rate of contraction are related to the osmolarity of the environment. In hyperosmotic environments, less water will be expelled and the contraction cycle will be longer.\n\nThe best understood contractile vacuoles belong to the protists \"Paramecium\", \"Amoeba\", \"Dictyostelium\" and \"Trypanosoma\", and to a lesser extent the green alga \"Chlamydomonas\". Not all species that possess a contractile vacuole are freshwater organisms; some marine, soil microorganisms and parasites also have a contractile vacuole. The contractile vacuole is predominant in species that do not have a cell wall, but there are exceptions (notably \"Chlamydomonas\") which do possess a cell wall. Through Evolution, the contractile vacuole has typically been lost in multicellular organisms, but it still exists in the unicellular stage of several multicellular fungi, as well as in several types of cells in sponges (amoebocytes, pinacocytes, and choanocytes).\n\nThe number of contractile vacuoles per cell varies, depending on the species. \"Amoeba\" have one, \"Dictyostelium discoideum\", \"Paramecium aurelia\" and \"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\" have two, and giant amoeba, such as \"Chaos carolinensis\", have many. The number of contractile vacuoles in each species is mostly constant and is therefore used for species characterization in systematics. The contractile vacuole has several structures attached to it in most cells, such as membrane folds, tubules, water tracts and small vesicles. These structures have been termed the spongiome; the contractile vacuole together with the spongiome is sometimes called the \"contractile vacuole complex\" (CVC). The spongiome serves several functions in water transport into the contractile vacuole and in localization and docking of the contractile vacuole within the cell.\n\n\"Paramecium\" and \"Amoeba\" possess large contractile vacuoles (average diameter of 13 and 45 µm, respectively), which are relatively comfortable to isolate, manipulate and assay. The smallest known contractile vacuoles belong to \"Chlamydomonas\", with a diameter of 1.5 µm. In \"Paramecium\", which has one of the most complex contractile vacuoles, the vacuole is surrounded by several canals, which absorb water by osmosis from the cytoplasm. After the canals fill with water, the water is pumped into the vacuole. When the vacuole is full, it expels the water through a pore in the cytoplasm which can be opened and closed. Other protists, such as \"Amoeba\", have CVs that move to the surface of the cell when full and undergo exocytosis. In \"Amoeba\" contractile vacuoles collect excretory waste, such as ammonia, from the intracellular fluid by both diffusion and active transport.\n\nThe way in which water enters the CV had been a mystery for many years, but several discoveries since the 1990s have improved understanding of this issue. Water could theoretically cross the CV membrane by osmosis, but only if the inside of the CV is hyperosmotic (higher solute concentration) to the cytoplasm. The discovery of proton pumps in the CV membrane and the direct measurement of ion concentrations inside the CV using microelectrodes led to the following model: the pumping of protons either into or out of the CV causes different ions to enter the CV. For example, some proton pumps work as cation exchangers, whereby a proton is pumped out of the CV and a cation is pumped at the same time into the CV. In other cases, protons pumped into the CV drag anions with them (carbonate, for example), to balance the pH. This ion flux into the CV causes an increase in CV osmolarity and as a result water enters the CV by osmosis. Water has been shown in at least some species to enter the CV through aquaporins.\n\nAcidocalcisomes have been implied to work alongside the contractile vacuole in responding to osmotic stress. They were detected in the vicinity of the vacuole in \"Trypanosoma cruzi\" and were shown to fuse with the vacuole when the cells were exposed to osmotic stress. Presumably the acidocalcisomes empty their ion contents into the contractile vacuole, thereby increasing the vacuole's osmolarity.\n\nThe CV indeed does not exist in higher organisms, but some of its unique characteristics are used by the former in their own osmoregulatory mechanisms. Research on the CV can therefore help us understand how osmoregulation works in all species. Many issues regarding the CV remain, as of 2010, unsolved:\n\n"}

It is situated on the edge of Hemel Hempstead.\n\nWestwick Row today is a narrow rural lane in the village of Leverstock Green, part of it is within the jurisdiction of St Albans Rural District Council, and part with Dacorum Borough Council. It was originally within the parish of St Michael's, St Albans. It runs into the main St Albans Road at its most easterly end, at Corner Farm, and into Green Lane at its most westerly end, being connected to the main road also by Pancake Lane. At the 2011 Census the population was still included in the City of St Albans Ward of St. Michaels.\n\nIt was once the central lane of the medieval vill and Manor of Westwick, and indications are that it was not only the main thoroughfare in medieval times, but was also the main thoroughfare of the Anglo Saxon village and manor of the same name, and indeed was in all probability an Iron Age trackway. The line of the original Iron Age trackway continues at the westerly end via Buncefield Lane.\n\nSeveral listed buildings are to be found along Westwick Row, namely: Dell Cottage (early to mid 17th century); Westwick Cottage (Grade II* late 12th century/early 13th century with later additions); King Charles II Cottage (17th century); Westwick Row Farmhouse (15th century); Westwick Row Farm Barns (18th century); Corner Farm House (16th century); and Corner Farm outbuildings (18th century). Westwick Farm, known to have dated back to the Tudor era was in a poor state of repair and was demolished in the mid 19th century by the Earl of Verulam when the farm was added to the portfolio of his estate of Gorhambury. It was replaced with the present farmhouse.\n\nFrom at least the early 19th century to the early 20th century several farm labourers' cottages were also to be found along Westwick Row. These were gradually demolished in the 20th century when new housing was built in Curtis Road. Several good sized properties were further built at the western end of the Row in the early to mid 20th century, and a small estate of executive houses were built on the site of Handpost Lodge.\n\nEvidence points to a Great Tithe Barn, belonging to the Monastery at St Albans, which once stood along Westwick Row near to the present day Westwick Warren. This was demolished in the mid 17th century.\n\nEvidence of a Romano-British Villa at Handpost Lodge, Westwick Row was discovered in 1998. Other archaeological finds date to the Late Neolithic, Bronze & Iron Ages and includes a Bronze Age hoard discovered by Sir John Evans in the mid 19th century. This consisted of a looped socketed bronze axe, fragments of another axe and five lumps of copper. With the exception of one lump of metal that John Evans donated to the British Museum, the rest of the find is at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.\n"}

By June 2011 all of the platforms had been lengthened to accommodate the new and longer S7 Stock trains, that first entered service on the Hammersmith and City Line from the beginning of July 2012. These new trains are seven cars in length instead of the six cars of C Stock that previously operated.\n\nThe present station is situated on Beadon Road and opened on 1 December 1868, replacing the original station slightly north of here which opened on 13 June 1864 when the Metropolitan Railway's extension was built from Paddington.\n\nThe Metropolitan Railway operated a service from Hammersmith to Richmond from 1877 over the lines of the London and South Western Railway (lines that are now part of the modern District line) from a junction just north of this station via an adjacent station at Hammersmith (Grove Road) and a viaduct connection to Ravenscourt Park. Part of this viaduct is still visible from District and Piccadilly line trains west of the Hammersmith station on those lines. The extension closed on 31 December 1906 shortly after the introduction of electric trains on the line.\nThe Hammersmith depot is located just outside the station. It is used for general maintenance and storage of the S7 Stock trains which operate on the Hammersmith & City line.\n\nOn 29 August 1991, three incendiary devices, attributed to the IRA, were discovered under a seat at the depot. There were no injuries.\n\nLondon Buses routes 9, 27, 33, 72, 190, 209, 211, 220, 266, 267, 283, 295, 391, 419, 485, H91 and night route N9, N11 and N97 serve the station and the nearby bus station.\n\nThe station appears in the film \"Adulthood\" (2008), as well as an earlier version of the music video for Lily Allen's \"LDN\". Lily enters the station and boards a train with her red Raleigh Chopper bicycle, alighting at Ladbroke Grove station. The station also appears in the music video of \"Bravo Lover\" by Taiwanese pop singer Jolin Tsai.\n\n\n"}

The remaining one or two players (\"hunters\") move about the room attempting to encourage the lions to move. The hunters can't touch the lions, but may move close to them, tell things to them, jokes, etc. Any person who moves must stand up and join the hunters.\n\nSleeping lions is also sometimes used in schools as an exercise. All the children will play \"lions\" and the teacher will play the \"hunter\". Usually, in this case, the teacher will make no effort to make the \"lions\" move, because in this case the real aim of the \"game\" is to calm the children down after playing other exciting games.\n\nOther names for the game include: dead soldiers, sleeping logs, standing scarecrows, snoozing tigers and dead lions.\n"}

Percy Priest Dam is a dam in north central Tennessee at river mile 6.8 of the Stones River, a tributary of the Cumberland. It is located about ten miles (16 km) east of downtown Nashville. The reservoir behind the dam is Percy Priest Lake. It is one of four major flood control reservoirs for the Cumberland; the others being Wolf Creek Dam, Dale Hollow Dam, and Center Hill Dam.\n\nThe Flood Control Act of 1946 commissioned the construction of a project under the name Stewarts Ferry Reservoir. Public Law 85-496, approved July 2, 1958, changed the name to J. Percy Priest in honor of the late Congressman from Tennessee. Construction began June 2, 1963 and the dam was completed in 1968. The dam was built under U.S. Army Corps of Engineers supervision.\n\nIn 1979 the dam was attacked with dynamite, with hopes of providing cover for a crime spree by collapsing the dam and causing a massive flood in the area. The conspirators only succeeded in causing $10,000 worth of damage to four iron doors at the dam's base. Two suspects were later convicted and sentenced to substantial prison terms. US Attorney Hal Harding later claimed, in response to the fact a whole case of dynamite was used to little effect, that \"it would be almost impossible to blow up a dam even with a truckload of dynamite\". \n\nRising above the streambed, the combination earth and concrete-gravity dam is long with a hydroelectric power plant generating 28 MW of electrical power which is fed into the grid of the Tennessee Valley Authority. The TVA co-ordinates operation of the Corps of Engineers dams in the Cumberland River Valley. The dam has contributed significantly in reducing the frequency and severity of flooding in the Cumberland Valley. In addition to the far-reaching effects of flood control, the project contributes to the available electric power supply of the area.\n\nThe dam is easily visible from Interstate 40 where it crosses the Stones River.\n\nThe completion of the dam in 1967 resulted in the destruction of the last known population of the freshwater mussel \"Epioblasma lenior\", which is now extinct. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent elevations and hourly discharge information can be found at: https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Lake-Levels/J-Percy-Priest\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) reports all discharge information online viewable to the public.\nCurrent elevations and hourly discharge information can be found at: https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Lake-Levels/J-Percy-Priest \n\nIt has been found that if J Percy Priest dam is discharging up to it takes about 28 hours for the reservoir elevation to recede .\n\n"}

He is the patron of the Nkore Trust Foundation, an organisation that is trying to restore the kingship in Ankole.\n\nBefore his death, Barigye was in the middle of a divorce suit with his wife Denise Kwezi and mother of his four children. The case was before the Nakawa Chief Magistrate’s court. However, the court had advised the couple to amicably settle the dispute out of court to avoid exposing their affairs in public.\n\nIn his divorce suit filed at Nakawa Court, Barigye stated that he made several attempts towards restoring marital harmony, but his wife neither had the willingness nor the desire to resume the marriage.\n"}

They occur across a wide range of climatic zones, and include trees such as coniferous and holly in cold climates, eucalyptus, Live oak, acacias and banksia in more temperate zones, and rainforest trees in tropical zones.\n\nConiferous temperate evergreen forests are most frequently dominated by species in the families Pinaceae and Cupressaceae. Broadleaf temperate evergreen forests include those in which Fagaceae, such as oaks, are common, those in which Nothofagaceae predominate, and the eucalyptus forests of the Southern Hemisphere. There also are assorted temperate evergreen forests dominated by other families of trees, such as Lauraceae in laurel forest.\n\nTemperate evergreen forests, coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed, are found largely in the temperate mid-latitudes of North America, Siberia, Canada, Australia, Africa, Scandinavia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Amazon and Orinoco basins of South America, Himalayas and western ghats of India and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Broadleaf evergreen forests occur in particular in southern China, southeastern Brazil, and parts of southeastern North America. and in countries around the Mediterranean Basin, such as Lebanon and Morocco. Other examples include the wet temperate conifer forests of northwestern North America.\n\nTropical evergreen forests (or \"tropical rainforests\") are usually found in areas receiving more than 234&nbs of rainfall and having a monthly mean temperature of 20 °C or higher in the coldest months. They occupy about seven percent of the Earth's surface and harbour more than half of the planet's terrestrial plants and animals. Tropical evergreen forests are dense, multi-layered, and harbour many types of plants and animals. These forests are found in the areas receiving heavy rainfall (more than 200  cm annual rainfall). They are very dense. Even the sunlight does not reach the ground. Numerous species of trees are found in these forests. In some regions, some types of trees shed their leaves at different times of the year. Therefore, these forests always appear green and are known as evergreen forests.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2334499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2334499", "title": "Josué de la Place", "text": "Josué de la Place\n\nJosué de la Place (also, Josua Placeus; c. 1596 – August 17, 1665 or possibly 1655) was a French theologian who was born at Saumur. He became pastor at Nantes in 1625 and was professor of theology at the Academy of Saumur from 1633 till his death. \n\nPlaceus together with Moise Amyraut and Louis Cappel belong, as followers of John Cameron, to that theological movement at Saumur which in contrast with the orthodox Academy of Sedan sought to moderate Calvinistic doctrine by emphasizing the ethical and common human elements, without, however, departing from the fundamental principles. \n\nFrom the supreme value of the accountability of every human soul, Placeus especially drew the conclusion against the imputation of Adam's actual sin. In defense of the doctrine that the sin of Adam could be reckoned to his descendants only as mediated by the inherited sinful subjective state he pointed out that John Calvin knew nothing of an immediate imputation and that the same was denied by Pietro Martire and Daniel Chamier, but did not go so far as to justify himself by the view of Huldrych Zwingli that hereditary guilt was no more than the guilt of every individual. The national synod of Charenton (1644) under the leadership of Antoine Garissoles, representing the constituency of Montauban, opposed this assertion by adopting a decree to be subscribed by all pastors and candidates. Placeus issued later his vindication, \"Disputatio de imputatione primi peccati Adami\" (Saumur, 1655). The national synod of Loudun, in 1659, withdrew all threatening measures of discipline, but the Zurich orthodoxy did not rest content until in the Helvetic Consensus of 1675 it repudiated with Saumurism as a whole the mere \"imputation mediate and consequent.\"\n\n"}
